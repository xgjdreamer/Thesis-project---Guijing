S0421	cos i like english language but i feel like i might be able to do english language on my own
S0423	mm
S0421	i don't i feel like maybe i don't need a teacher for it i could probably
S0423	oh look there's where i work
S0421	oh mm
S0423	well not in there but
S0421	i could probably just read the book erm and get a good knowledge
S0423	yeah
S0421	and i mean you know like that that's kind of like the same with creative write but like i i could do that at home but erm be alright to do like a for the first year if i've get to do something might be quite good fun
S0423	yeah
S0421	but like french i couldn't really carry on that by myself because i'm not a good enough standard
S0423	mm
S0421	so like it's my extra subject i should probably pick something that i will benefit from from have a a guide thing
S0423	yeah
S0421	cos there's lot of book on english language and i feel like if i read those i'd be alright do it myself
S0423	yeah it would be good to kind of link it in to a relate subject wouldn't it to what you're study
S0421	and if i be study it myself when i'm in the english department anyway and i have some kind of a question that i didn't understand something i'm sure there'd be someone there to help me
S0423	yeah
S0421	and they have like erm you can do like world literature along with english literature but i don't really wanna do that because it's not like i don't know it sound quite interest but i don't think i want to do it it's like
S0423	mm
S0421	erm greek like i don't know what they do like
S0423	what from like classics
S0421	yeah i think so maybe not quite classics cos they do have a separate classics course
S0423	oh i think it would be er more modern world literature
S0421	no yeah it's like that old stuff
S0423	oh right
S0421	it kind of broaden your knowledge of like yeah i suppose like classical things it's not quite classics though because in classics
S0423	well go back to older like
S0421	yeah
S0423	literature
S0421	yeah in different countries because in classics you actually like learn the different languages and things and about culture and things so maybe it's just that aspect
S0423	yeah
S0421	i would have quite like to do maybe something like philosophy but i don't know what i'd do with philosophy and again that's something that i could do in my own time really
S0423	mm
S0421	cos i could just read i could read there's lot of book on philosophy that i could do
S0423	you could become a full time philosopher
S0421	yeah cos there's lot of work for full time philosophers
S0421	philosophise all day
S0423	be there a lot of work for english literature students
S0421	of course there be
S0423	be there
S0421	because you can go into anything
S0423	like what
S0421	like well anything that's not science and you can just get additional train for anything but like to be a philosopher like
S0423	well philosophers in theory should be able to go into anything as well
S0421	well yeah if you do a philosophy degree
S0423	yeah
S0421	but you say you could become a full time there's like no work for that at all
S0421	like there's no there's
S0423	well if you're good at it and old book then
S0423	i mean there's be somebody on tv who's a a pay full time philosopher
S0421	yeah there's like one or two in like
S0423	yeah
S0421	the world
S0423	yeah
S0421	i don't think students who go and do a philosophy degree be plan to go into be a full time philosopher they'll probably
S0423	well how do philosophers come about then they must start somewhere
S0421	yeah well may may i think
S0423	just cos we're in the modern world and we think we know everything doesn't mean
S0421	no but yeah there be load of modern philosophers but the thing be those philosophers probably don't just philosophise all day so like yeah they'll have a book but they'll also do like i dunno research and they'll probably
S0423	well they probably teach don't they
S0421	yeah they probably teach they they might even be interest in history as well do you know what i mean they they're not just like sit round like oh philosophise all the time
S0423	that would be good that that would be a good job
S0421	yeah yeah there be load of modern philosophy book not just all the old ones
S0423	yeah
S0421	but you wouldn't be i don't think it would be very rare for someone to be able to live on that full time i mean how many people be buy philosophy book
S0423	mm yeah they have to do other things wouldn't they
S0421	yeah but i think yeah so like i yeah if you do philosophy you could probably it isn't i think in term of kind of job prospect people might kind of recognise english a bite more than philosophy
S0423	yeah
S0421	in term of like employability even though like english isn't like necessarily gonna be use for the job specifically but english be like a good one a lot of people do it if they don't know what they want to do because
S0423	yeah
S0421	but i'm do it cos i like english
S0423	well i suppose it demonstrate your level of intelligence if
S0421	yeah
S0423	you have a degree in most things doesn't it
S0421	well philosophy be kind of quite useful to have like a bite of a knowledge for it cos sometimes i've read book and like i don't understand them because they're like philosophical novels
S0423	mm
S0421	and they've get like theories and things in them and i'm just i just don't understand them because i don't know anything about them like i read some camus and i didn't i didn't realise that he be like i just read it and i be like wow this be a weird book
S0423	who
S0421	camus
S0423	i don't know be he a philosopher
S0421	do you not yeah well he write like philosophical fiction
S0423	oh right
S0421	i don't know if he's get any actual like the pure philosophy things but yeah erm he's quite like
S0423	sound quite interest
S0421	existential yeah i read er the stranger or the outsider it depend he's french i didn't
S0423	oh
S0421	read it in french though just read it in english and i i remember i finish read it and i be like i don't really understand where this book be go or what it be try to show or anything
S0423	mm
S0421	cos it be really short and it be just really strange like well the story wasn't that strange but i don't know and i i didn't really understand it and i feel like if i read it again and read it up a bite more about like some theories that he be try to employ i think i'd understand it better
S0423	what be he be he come up with some philosophical ideas which be the theory of some philosopher which be a recognise theory or be he just make his own stuff up
S0421	no i think it's like because there be like different type of philosophers and i think because with the thing in like because it's fiction it's not kind of like erm like theories like write out it's kind of incorporate into the story
S0423	mm
S0421	and he's quite existential so within existentialism it's erm like about be and well you know like existence like what why be we why do we exist like
S0423	so do you have to understand a bite about that philosophy to understand the book
S0421	i think so yeah because i mean i kind of like even now know a bite more about cos i do i do some research and i do know a bite more about the different branch and things but it's i mean i have to reread the book cos i can't really remember it that well now but even with know that i think i'm still kind of think about think back to the book like not quite sure what he be do i think i'd have to read it again
S0423	i've read er voltaire
S0421	yeah
S0423	one of his novels
S0421	do you
S0423	and he's like a philosophical writer
S0421	yeah
S0423	isn't he
S0421	yeah
S0423	yeah but go way back
S0421	do you
S0423	to
S0421	understand it
S0423	no
S0423	so i didn't you know i don't i don't know whether i particularly enjoy
S0421	and like yeah no i read erm
S0423	but like i i mean that be do as i think that's kind of i think i would enjoy more er er read philosophy in a
S0421	yeah
S0423	er know that it be just
S0421	in in its purest form yeah
S0423	yeah well they they're
S0421	yeah
S0423	tell you about their theories indirectly rather than in
S0421	yeah
S0423	write in
S0421	it's quite good that
S0423	you you have to
S0421	yeah i've read like extract and things from certain book
S0423	yeah although you
S0421	and they're quite interest
S0423	have say that it probably be like anything of that kind of erm you know anything that's a bite academic it's probably very hard to get through it
S0421	yeah cos a lot of them as well a lot of them be erm like translate if it if they're from different countries and things and then there's like all these like debate over the translation and it's like no this wasn't accurately translate doesn't actually mean this at all and then other people be like no i think it mean this so there's
S0423	yeah
S0421	all this debate and i'm just like because it there be a bite that i read and then like sometimes i see quote and i'm like i need to see that in context so i see it in context and i'm like well i've not read the whole book i'll have a look what other people be say and then there's these people on this like forum or whatever like debate like no well this person say this then this person say that
S0423	mm
S0421	yeah i think especially some of the some of the newer ones would be okay to read i think like you can get like philosophy for beginners or like you know
S0423	yeah something like that might be more
S0421	or like quite erm they they like present it in quite like a
S0423	simple
S0421	a casual way you know what i mean like you know
S0423	yeah cos i think to read any of your original
S0421	or aristotle or something
S0423	yeah or even or modern ones or something
S0421	or plato
S0423	could be quite like
S0421	yeah could be yeah
S0423	erm be better to read a book that kind of explain it to you rather than read it directly
S0421	yeah
S0423	er what have you ever have you never read one a proper
S0421	i've never read like a yeah i'd quite like to i'd like
S0423	on philosophers or
S0421	cos i've read like extract and i've read all these be quite academic though the ones i be look at either extract and then i've read like a critic write about it or like a discussion on like erm a forum but these forums tend to be like quite high like you know what i mean they're not just kind of people like discuss
S0423	yeah
S0421	like they be they do know what they're talk about like discussions erm and i i'm quite i i i find those quite interest because even though the erm discussion itself be still quite academic it be easier for me to understand just read it in its its like
S0423	yeah
S0421	i feel like i'd need the book with kind of someone's like note next to me like don't understand that that's actually a reference to like you know whatever and i'd be like oh okay
S0423	mm so be you be you hungry yet or be you okay
S0421	i'm not that hungry be you hungry
S0423	no not at all really er cos this there's service here there's something about twenty odd miles i think
S0421	oh we can go to those ones maybe
S0423	erm cos after that well there probably be some further down this be the there must be some service if we're go past bristol area
S0421	yeah
S0423	erm so i mean if you're not hungry it's i don't know then again we don't wanna leave it too late do we cos
S0421	yeah
S0423	i'm just try to think if you take that thing out of er the what what's the first line on it
S0421	tiverton service area
S0423	tiverton
S0421	junction twenty seven
S0423	and that's two hundred and thirty one miles be it be there a time on that to the leave
S0421	ten eighteen
S0423	oh i think it's just time in each section
S0421	yeah
S0423	so not an overall time there er
S0421	no
S0423	each section
S0421	no i think you ask me this last time and there wasn't
S0423	oh cos i've not print out the whole thing so that's about two hundred miles that we've probably do
S0421	that's like a bite further down the page there's exeter so if you
S0423	well that's that's come too too far down that cos what's the total mileage so that's about the last two hundred miles of the journey isn't it
S0421	er exeter be two hundred and forty seven miles
S0423	yeah see that
S0421	and tiverton be two hundred and thirty one
S0423	yeah no we don't
S0421	so tiverton must be near exeter
S0423	yeah we don't wanna wait till that far down but it might be a bite soon yet i'm just try to think cos i suppose we should have a little break some time but erm
S0421	we could always buy like sandwich and then eat them later
S0423	yeah well we've probably travel probably a third of the way i would have think so it's take us about two hours to get here and two four six that would be right wouldn't it so let's shall we leave it another hour of drive
S0421	yeah
S0423	and then we've get probably half of the journey after that it's just sort of to break it up a bite it's probably a bite too early to stop
S0421	yeah
S0423	erm whether we're hungry or not we'll see what you fancy at the time i suppose we should so say probably not an hour probably forty five minutes or something
S0421	yeah
S0423	er before before half three
S0421	uhu
S0423	and then we if we have dinner about eight or something that that's alright isn't it it's not too late
S0421	yeah
S0423	it's it's a nice break a long break between it's not get too late in the day to be eat at that time be it
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos we we won't be eat six'll be too early we wouldn't wanna eat at that time cos we have to prepare what we're eat so i don't i don't know if we're gonna be go out anywhere by the time we arrive
S0421	yeah probably not
S0423	check in you want to spray the whole place down with the
S0421	disinfectant
S0423	antibacterial thing or i think i'd better do that
S0423	unless i'm go out for a walk while you do it have you bring a special mask this time
S0421	no
S0423	so we're the other side of birmingham now
S0421	oh
S0423	the next next town we're gonna come to be worcester
S0421	oh worcestershire worcestershire sauce
S0423	yeah
S0421	or be it worcester sauce worcester sauce isn't it not worcestershire sauce or be it worcestershire
S0423	i think it's worcestershire
S0421	oh
S0423	you can i think it's get either on it
S0421	whatever yeah
S0423	worcester sauce it think worcestershire no i think it's worcestershire
S0421	yeah
S0423	yeah i'll wait till i'm a little bite more tire i'm still not too bad drive on
S0421	what it's weird how worcester be spell isn't it it's like
S0423	yeah
S0421	cester it's quite
S0423	yeah there's few place name like that
S0421	a few yeah a few counties like leicestershire that's quite strange
S0423	yeah leicester be really yeah where you don't pronounce it
S0421	yeah
S0423	as it's spell and there's a few erm there's one go over towards hereford there's a place call to to say it as you see it it's spell leominster
S0421	oh
S0423	but people who be from that area call it leominster
S0421	oh
S0423	and it's weird cos it's such a different sort of spell l e o
S0421	yeah
S0423	m i n s t e r and they say leominster
S0421	oh
S0423	they miss out the o completely i'm try to think of one that another one that i've come across well there's load like that in like local areas and small place
S0421	yeah
S0423	well there's one just on the way just outside of on the way to on the main road there's just a little sign for the name of the area and there's a few house around there and it's spell so i be chat to the locals say oh yeah you know the way to
S0421	yeah
S0423	which you think it would they say
S0421	be it
S0423	yeah
S0423	they say you mean
S0423	oh right so that's what it's call
S0423	how do you know that
S0421	it just seem i don't know it just seem like it would
S0423	yeah you always seem to miss out one kind of extreme
S0421	yeah
S0423	letter don't you in these word
S0421	it's probably come from latin or something gaelic maybe that like whatever it be sound like
S0423	leominster
S0421	yeah that sound like it maybe have a
S0423	yeah they probably
S0421	a gaelic kind of thing
S0423	go back to a long long time ago don't they
S0421	but er english have erm all these silent bs all over the place like silent letter
S0423	oh right
S0421	because of latin because they have them
S0423	oh
S0421	so when people be like yeah we'll just put them in because latin have them
S0423	oh right
S0421	and then you know erm also erm the reason why we have a h after g in some word like ghost
S0423	yeah
S0421	be because erm
S0423	oh they just decide
S0421	yeah
S0423	okay oh
S0421	because because
S0423	somebody go through the to make a dictionary and they say oh no this be
S0421	no it it be
S0421	yeah it be the erm
S0423	because in english they use
S0421	the flemish
S0423	be a lot more simple didn't they
S0421	it be the
S0423	what be it
S0421	the the there be a lot of flemish people in the erm
S0423	oh right
S0421	print whatever
S0423	oh it as the print the wasn't it yeah
S0421	yeah so they all put it in
S0423	yeah
S0421	but it's not be retain in everything
S0423	yeah
S0421	just in some word so like english be like oh yeah just stick them in there
S0423	yeah
S0421	cos flemish have erm
S0423	that's right i know i hear something like that
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos er english it use to be a lot more see it be have you see it wasn't it
S0421	well they they
S0421	didn't have standardise spell or anything
S0423	no
S0421	so people just use to spell everything however they want to
S0423	yeah
S0421	and spell only become standardise in seventeen fifty five with the introduction of johnson's dictionary
S0423	really
S0421	which take him about eleven years or something to
S0423	oh
S0421	write
S0423	i know johnson's dictionary i didn't know he be the one to standardise it
S0421	well he be the first dictionary
S0423	mm
S0421	so that's only when cos then like people would kind of consult the dictionary
S0423	yeah
S0421	but then even when that come out there be still a lot of non standard spell because erm it wasn't widespread and you know like
S0423	yeah and they think oh why do we have to go with that
S0421	and there wasn't and you know like local people who like
S0423	yeah
S0421	not a lot of education and like things like that so it do take a while for it to become like standard but the introduction of that be kind of like the begin
S0423	yeah
S0421	of this be how you spell things and i mean if you look back at that dictionary it probably have stuff spell differently
S0423	well it will do like from that kind of time yeah be a lot of differences so i guess that's as it be when you're when you're kind of alive during time you don't realise how language be develop but you know when you look at it down the age you see you know so that be his dictionary yeah but language will change all the time
S0421	yeah
S0423	won't it
S0421	well i mean he make a i think he make more dictionaries over the years well like the oxford dictionary add a new word
S0423	yeah
S0421	when it's be in use for ten years
S0423	mm yeah so you get like things that be consider slang and will be enter into it at some point won't they
S0421	yeah
S0423	if it's still the common use
S0421	i really like etymology dot com and you can put in a word and you can find out its etymology
S0423	what do that mean its history
S0421	origins it's good it's a fun website
S0423	i don't think many people would say that but obviously have to who's interest in word and english would only say it's a fun website
S0421	dictionary dot com be good as well dictionary dot com be really good because it's not just a dictionary it give you like all sort of fun facts about language and word and like they have new article and things come up about word and stuff it's good
S0423	so do you sit in your room all night put stuff into that say oh look at that i didn't know that
S0421	and like i i read the article on on erm dictionary dot com as well they're really good all about how like word have change and
S0423	do you
S0421	yeah it's good word of the day on dictionary dot com
S0423	well i suppose you're put your free time to better use than just sit down and watch telly
S0421	i know yeah
S0423	or play video game
S0421	it's good entertainment dictionary dot com be
S0423	why do they get somebody on sing and dance on word
S0421	no they do have a a game on there though that i use to play i've not play it in age and it be erm it give you the definition for a word and you have to give the word
S0423	oh right
S0421	it's harder than it sound
S0423	it sound very hard to me
S0421	i use to enjoy play that
S0423	do you win
S0421	yeah i be like first in the world
S0423	be you
S0421	but probably nobody be play like
S0423	oh somebody's take your crown now you'd better go back on
S0421	probably yeah i be like first in the world for like that month or i don't know if i be ever first in the in the world world but yeah
S0423	yeah but can you cheat and look it up
S0421	well it's it's time
S0423	i don't think you can can you oh right
S0421	well yeah and how would you look it like you put the definition in like
S0423	yeah well you could google that definition and it would come up wouldn't it
S0421	yeah maybe cos i use to think something like scrabble would be good fun and scrabble's okay but i'm always really annoy with scrabble because i'm really limit by the word that i pick out of that pouch the letter
S0423	oh right
S0421	and it's like i could have fit a good word in there but i just don't have the letter it's just annoy
S0423	who you who do you play scrabble with
S0421	online
S0423	oh
S0421	it be good i do play quite a bite of scrabble for like a while but then i just get bore
S0423	who do you play against online just a computer
S0421	erm
S0423	or with other people like
S0421	no they just pair you with someone round the world
S0423	really
S0421	yeah and you just play it
S0423	yeah
S0421	i think it be through facebook or something
S0423	mm
S0421	and you like put in a user name and then you just like you can play with someone
S0423	yeah so you don't chat or anything like that
S0421	no
S0423	you just play
S0421	i think you can like able chat if you want but
S0423	do what
S0421	i think you can click like if you want to chat with people but you can just have an option to just play sometimes i would be play with someone though and they'd put in such like long complicate word then i'm just like i don't even know what that be never mind have the letter for that word
S0423	yeah but er be it be it all in english though
S0421	yeah
S0423	well how do you know it's a real word be that check by
S0421	because the yeah well the thing be you could cheat on scrabble like if you're play online cos there's all sort of anagram solvers and things that you can get online so
S0423	oh right
S0421	yeah i be i be properly against people cheat as well
S0423	well there's not much point really be there play if you're go to cheat against some random stranger
S0423	it's not really what's the point in play you can't come away think yes that be a great game
S0423	i beat that person if you just well i don't understand the satisfaction
S0421	yeah well they want to go up on the leader board
S0423	mm
S0421	i think cos like on the facebook thing you can like invite your friend to play with you or you can just be pair with like a random person who also want to play
S0423	yeah
S0421	but erm none of my friends ever want to play scrabble or like i'd invite them and they'd like take their go like a week later or something and i'd just be like
S0423	oh right not as interest word as you
S0421	no oh and do you know what else i come across and i didn't realise this be a thing it's like a pronunciation dictionary
S0423	mm
S0421	it i saw it in our college library and i be like oh what's this so i go to have a look and it's basically a dictionary but it it tell you the pronunciation in erm english english and american english
S0423	oh right i think all dictionaries do they not have a thing where it show you how to pronounce stuff
S0421	yeah it will yeah if you get a good dictionary then it do
S0423	mm
S0421	but this be just i don't know why they why that's what i be think you can you can get it in a normal dictionary as well
S0423	not american though it
S0421	yeah
S0423	i wonder why they have that combination
S0421	well because they're both english aren't they
S0423	oh right
S0421	they're very
S0423	yeah but the two
S0421	they're the two type of english you can get
S0423	yeah but i suppose if you're if they if it's publish in english in america i suppose but if it's just publish over here you're not gonna need the american one be you
S0421	no but you might want to for like purpose of have a look like get the change if you're like a linguist
S0423	you're not gonna go to well
S0421	no but if you're a linguist then you
S0423	if you're a linguist you should know already shouldn't you
S0421	well not necessarily if you're interest in linguistics then you might want to er it's quite good i don't know i quite want one but i don't think i need one i think just use my regular dictionary cos that have it in as well
S0423	you know you're not gonna need american
S0421	no
S0423	pronunciation be you
S0421	i might like to look at it for the novelty though
S0423	unless when you go over there on holiday you start talk american to everyone
S0421	it's quite good for the novelty of it although dictionary dot com provide me with both as well usually so and it even speak it out
S0423	do it
S0421	yeah so i don't need to learn the phonetic alphabet but i want to seem like a good thing to know
S0423	be it something you use
S0421	i think i would i'd use it when i'm when i'm do my dictionary surf and if i saw a word i could know how to pronounce it as well
S0423	dictionary surf
S0423	what's that
S0421	i don't know i just
S0423	do you have to go to the seaside for it
S0421	i just make that up then like people surf the the internet don't they i can surf the dictionary i think it sound quite good
S0423	yeah it's funny how you just accept expressions like surf the web
S0423	i mean i wonder where that's come from it's a bite odd really isn't it
S0421	yeah it's idiomatic
S0423	pardon
S0421	it's idiomatic
S0423	what be you call the person an idiot who think of it
S0421	but it's weird like they have them in other languages as well like these expressions and it's just like oh
S0423	yeah
S0421	and in french we learn some of them but i've forget most of them but there be like er it be like erm i've get a cockroach sit on my head and guess what that's a expression for
S0423	what in french
S0421	yeah
S0423	i don't know
S0421	it's erm it basically mean that like oh i'm feed up or bore
S0423	yeah that be quite interest other countries' use of expressions i mean that's just weird isn't it
S0423	why would anyone have a cockroach on your head when you're bore
S0421	or er it's rain cat and dog
S0423	well yeah
S0421	in england
S0423	yeah they're all strange aren't they
S0421	they have one that make sense like i'm er in french i'm i'm as hungry as a wolf or something
S0423	mm
S0421	that make sense but what what we would say like
S0423	i'm so hungry i could eat a horse
S0421	i could eat a horse yeah that's weird as well isn't it why would you be eat a horse
S0423	you'd think the french would say that though
S0421	yeah
S0423	they eat horse
S0421	yeah
S0423	we don't
S0423	we say it i guess cos it's quite a big animal isn't it a horse
S0421	yeah
S0423	probably where it'll be come from
S0421	i think the french one about the cockroaches translate directly to like i have the cockroach or something
S0423	oh
S0421	and it it's like basically like i think where it come from be like as though it's like oh i don't know it's so weird isn't it
S0423	yeah
S0421	do you want some of these
S0423	yeah if you're dish some out no wonder we're not hungry
S0421	i know yeah
S0423	they be tasty
S0421	you can't taste them
S0423	i say they're tasty
S0421	oh right we have a good thunderstorm not long ago
S0423	yeah i be rid my bike home in it
S0421	i be at home
S0423	probably not safe to ride a bike in a thunderstorm really
S0421	no you could have be strike grandma doesn't like thunderstorms
S0423	do she scream
S0421	no but she just generally doesn't like them and i'm like well it's not like you're gonna get strike down be you and she's like yeah but so many people do
S0423	so many people don't
S0423	some people do don't they
S0421	she's like they're so dangerous like they're not they're not that dangerous
S0423	it's extremely rare
S0421	i know
S0423	more dangerous cross a road
S0421	aren't you suppose to turn the light off when there's one i never do
S0423	yeah you're suppose to turn off electrical appliances cos
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos they can er be blow up can't they
S0421	i don't think many people do though they
S0423	no
S0421	i don't
S0423	cos it's quite a rare thing isn't it it's like
S0421	i remember when we be at the country house and there be a like a big thunderstorm and they're i really like them over there because you actually get the fork of lightning and over here you only really get the sheet lightning
S0423	well you do you get fork lightning here it's just they're probably not as common
S0421	probably and it's probably behind the cloud
S0423	you can't see it yeah
S0421	yeah so i never really see the fork lightning over here and over there you do and i'm like look it like wow and grandma's like get all the light switch off and like all the electrical things off and everything and she's like
S0423	do she do that the other night
S0421	no
S0423	oh do she not
S0421	no but she she she do it in the country house i think maybe cos she's worry cos there's load of tree there and a big forest
S0423	well yeah when you when it the sky be clear and it's lightning it's it can be spectacular and you do you people send photos that you get them show them on the news of
S0421	yeah
S0423	er so you do see them the fork lightning it's just like you say it depend on cloud and where you be and
S0421	can they not er get electricity from storm
S0423	erm
S0421	could they not
S0423	it would be just so unpredictable wouldn't it
S0421	yeah i know but
S0423	i guess you can
S0421	could they not sometimes
S0423	but it's probably just not worth it be it
S0421	yeah
S0423	what they would be able to get and store and the effort you'd put into something and what you'd get out of it
S0421	yeah
S0423	it's probably just not worth it be it what be you think like of frankenstein's monster when he
S0421	i mean
S0423	bring him to life with the lightning
S0421	that would be good wouldn't it people aren't really do experiment like that be they
S0423	ross on wye it's not far from hay on wye
S0421	oh
S0423	people what
S0421	aren't really do like experiment anymore be they well i mean if they do they ever do experiment like that try to
S0423	scientists be constantly do experiment a lot of them be
S0423	experiment for things like bring a frankenstein's monster
S0421	yeah no but he wasn't mean to be a monster though be he
S0423	i think from that era when it's er like victorian they do that have that kind of like idea or we'll
S0421	yeah
S0423	like and have that that idea of a mad scientist probably because they use to pick up body and things to
S0421	yeah
S0423	dissect them to understand your body
S0421	well i mean they still
S0423	i guess
S0421	like
S0423	well they use human body
S0421	yeah
S0423	just don't yeah
S0421	they just don't dig them up
S0423	just don't well yeah some
S0421	a legal way
S0423	well people donate their body don't they science and
S0421	yeah well my my friend be like oh why don't you sign up for organ donation and i be just like i don't really want to i don't i don't know i'm not
S0423	well in some countries it it's erm compulsory unless you sign out of it
S0421	oh
S0423	and they be think of do that in this country because there be so few people do it and it save so many live you know
S0421	yeah
S0423	erm
S0421	i don't know i feel like i want to but
S0423	so i've never sign up for it but i i'd be more than happy to give to donate any of my organs cos
S0421	yeah cos
S0421	it's good isn't it for like people
S0423	well yeah if somebody's in need of a a
S0421	an organ
S0423	a liver or a heart or whatever if yours be good but i've erm i mean i think somebody once say oh don't do that cos maybe they won't try as hard to save your life or i think some people think that you know they think oh they won't be if he die we can get his heart and we can have
S0421	they're like oh we can get all his organs oh
S0423	i dunno have you hear of like that i've i'm sure you've hear of like that exhibition you know where
S0421	yeah that awful one
S0423	the thing yeah i think we've probably speak about it before i understand people who donate their body to him
S0421	for yeah yeah if you say you donate your body to science then that could happen but if you've just donate your organs then they can't do that to you they can just take your organs
S0423	oh right
S0421	it
S0423	so they could use it for i don't think it it would end up be in his hand though cos it's not really scientific be it
S0421	yeah well i mean like supposedly
S0423	it's like a exhibit
S0421	it's a kind of
S0423	well yeah
S0421	educate the public but not really but yeah
S0423	not when he's pose and
S0421	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0423	play tennis and card that's doesn't stand up do it you know people just go out of morbid curiosity
S0421	oh i couldn't have look at it like i'm so squeamish like oh i couldn't have couldn't have do it but yeah if you donate your body to medical science like you could end up the person like students be dissect
S0423	yeah
S0421	but if you just donate your organs i think all they can have be your organs
S0423	yeah and now i guess cos you kind of think well why do they need body now but because we know so much about the body but
S0421	but it it yeah
S0423	they need to practise don't they
S0421	yeah
S0423	the students on
S0421	like future surgeons
S0423	they want for certain
S0421	i'd rather them be practise on a dead body than like the first the first time go into surgery and they've never see one before
S0423	yeah
S0421	but that must be awful like i don't know how doctor do that like oh oh
S0423	well everyone's different aren't they some people don't give it a second think
S0421	i couldn't even dissect a frog or
S0423	yeah it always seem to be girls that er
S0421	no there be a boy in my science class
S0423	yeah but they have that reputation of be more squeamish than boys
S0421	there be a boy in my science class who be like green in the face when we do the heart dissection i mean i just didn't look but he be like look and it look like he be about to faint
S0423	what kind of a heart be it a cow's organs
S0421	i think so yeah most of the class be like okay to look at it though
S0423	yeah i don't see why not
S0421	i i be like so surprise i be like how be you do that
S0423	it's not as though the whole body be there though
S0423	it's a bite probably harder to look at when the whole thing be
S0421	then again
S0423	be like
S0421	i'm the person who doesn't like touch raw meat so i don't even like to look at raw meat
S0423	well would you not be able to prepare it if you have gloves on or something
S0421	no like even look at it oh and it smell ah i hate
S0423	shall we stop at the next service
S0421	yeah
S0423	thirteen miles
S0421	yeah it stink i hate the smell of raw meat
S0423	maybe it's go off when you're you're
S0421	i don't think so i hate the smell of the butcher's it's horrible i can't go in butcher really
S0423	why when be the last time you be there i don't think you go
S0421	well
S0423	that often do you i mean obviously you've get the supermarket
S0421	no but even if you walk past even if you walk past no or like the deli counter oh
S0423	yeah i think there be something on the news a while ago say oh there be a butcher and he be tell by the the shop centre that he be in
S0421	yeah
S0423	because he obviously he have meat hang up in the window and stuff
S0421	yeah
S0423	but i supposedly it be upset children and he be tell to take it down
S0421	yeah
S0421	well like sometimes they have the whole animal hang there like
S0423	yeah but you
S0421	with the fur on it and
S0423	no not with the fur no
S0421	feather there be in
S0423	oh right
S0421	there as like rabbit and pheasants hang there

S0421	yeah
S0423	what do you fancy eat
S0421	oh i don't know
S0423	actually we'll have to see what's at this service
S0421	yeah
S0423	i bet they're not that good be they
S0421	there be a burger king at the last one
S0423	well do you fancy a whopper
S0421	well it's not a bad place to eat be it we usually go to the burger king
S0423	yeah erm there probably isn't one at this next one probably a different thing i don't like those er road chefs
S0421	no
S0423	not good
S0421	do you remember that really one that we stop off at
S0423	that be scotland wasn't it
S0421	well yeah i think so and then the next one
S0423	yeah with
S0421	we pass have all cool stuff in it
S0423	yeah
S0421	and we'd eat some really dodgy sandwich that be horrible
S0423	yeah it's cos we'd we'd go for age as well we'd
S0421	yeah
S0423	be wait and then
S0421	and then like the next
S0423	we think well we'll go in this one
S0423	cos we don't know where the next one will be
S0421	yeah
S0423	so many fifty mile an hour limit
S0421	what do you think's in that lorry
S0423	which lorry
S0421	that blue one next to us
S0423	oh i bet it's full of asylum seekers
S0421	could be smuggle them in what's coltons what what mm
S0423	it's an english lorry that isn't it
S0421	yeah oh
S0423	tate and lyle sugar
S0421	oh be that all tate and lyle do sugar
S0423	i don't know but it's colton commercials i don't know why they have work in partnership with take and lyle it could even be engineer stuff you know for their factories you know if they're work in cos sugar transportation they probably have it in massive containers don't they you know like you see these tankers they probably have raw sugar in or something
S0421	yeah
S0423	although that could be come from the factory and you know the bag of sugar
S0421	yeah go to the
S0423	it could be all
S0421	supermarket
S0423	pallets in there yeah or the
S0421	do you hear about that erm grain that i don't it's call something it's get a weird and it's like quinoa or something
S0423	yeah i've try cook it
S0421	have you well it it's
S0423	i think i overcook it it wasn't nice when i have it
S0421	it's rise in popularity in like the western world
S0423	yeah it's mean to be
S0421	recently
S0423	good for you isn't it
S0421	because it's suppose to be good for you
S0423	yeah
S0421	and everyone's be buy like you know all the health food
S0423	yeah
S0421	people be like oh it's really good and everything but the only problem be that in south america where they grow it
S0423	yeah
S0421	all the farmers that's like basically what their diet be make of
S0423	mm
S0421	and because the demand have rise so high erm the price be rise and everything and like the normal people there can't afford to eat it anymore
S0423	oh right
S0421	so like people be be encourage to like not you know
S0423	not eat it
S0421	yeah because we're all buy it we could be eat anything and we're all
S0423	yeah
S0421	buy this now and the people over there who have literally like nothing er that's like what they eat
S0423	yeah
S0421	all the time that's like their rice
S0423	yeah
S0421	and they can't eat anything because
S0423	well can't they grow something else
S0421	well maybe but
S0423	well maybe they're get more wealth out of it if if it's such demand and
S0421	yeah but like the
S0423	charge us higher price for it
S0421	but the the they're like the poor people
S0423	well no it probably doesn't go to those people yeah
S0421	yeah like the the poor people be like
S0423	mm
S0421	get nothing to eat
S0423	quinoa
S0421	yeah it's get it's spell weird it's like it's spell like quinoa
S0423	yeah q i n or whatever else
S0421	yeah
S0423	be in it
S0421	cos i saw i saw i see all these weird and wonderful things in holland and barrett's
S0423	mm
S0421	and i've see people write about it online and i saw this article and it's like yeah er i mean like obviously they do eat other stuff as well but like they're really like that that's where it grow for them really well
S0423	yeah
S0421	and that's just what they eat and then
S0423	well it's like in
S0421	yeah
S0423	our kind of food
S0421	in that other place like we would grow potatoes
S0423	it's potatoes
S0421	yeah
S0423	and if people around the world start say we want potatoes
S0421	from england
S0423	farmers would sell it to the highest bidder
S0421	yeah
S0423	and er we'd just have to start pay higher price although we we have so much variety here
S0421	yeah
S0423	we can eat anything
S0421	well yeah but over there like it it must be come from like poor place and
S0423	yeah
S0421	they're like well they probably have other stuff but that be like the main thing that they eat every day and then
S0423	yeah it's probably their staple diet isn't it
S0421	yeah and then we decide we want it
S0423	well yeah over the last couple of years i've hear a lot of like the
S0421	because it's a lot of people
S0423	publicity about it and you know
S0421	a lot of people who be eat it be like maybe like vegan or you know what i mean
S0423	yeah
S0421	erm and they're like all for like animal right and everything and it's like well it's hurt somebody out there so maybe you should er stop eat it find something else
S0423	mm maybe you're gonna start eat that now be you
S0421	no i well i i saw it at the shop i be and erm now that i know that i'm definitely not go to eat it if the poor people be starve
S0423	yeah i try it once and i can't remember why it's mean to be good for you but
S0421	might as well have rice or something
S0423	i think i overcook it i be gonna put it in salad and it kind of split and just it be kind of mushy i don't think it's mean to be like that so i think i i didn't do it again we must have pass those service cos i've oh no it's come up now seem like we've be drive a long time since we saw it this be down here where we do the bike race
S0421	oh
S0423	and
S0421	do you win
S0423	no there's about two thousand people race
S0421	yeah and there's all them professionals isn't there
S0423	yeah
S0421	what do you come do you do better than last year
S0423	well my time all of our time be better
S0421	yeah
S0423	but we do er a an extra lap so we do more lap this year
S0421	yeah
S0423	but we're still in a similar kind of position
S0421	oh
S0423	in a way er so i want to i wanna do some more cycle and get fitter so i can do even better next year i wanna be up there with the fastest
S0421	you wanna win
S0423	yeah well no i'm never gonna win but
S0423	but i be the i be the fastest in our team
S0421	oh
S0423	so that's good
S0421	yeah
S0423	that i be like the fastest in the team
S0423	that's always the challenge and we get a personal trainer on our team
S0421	oh
S0423	and he's pretty fit
S0421	really
S0423	yeah well he doesn't only do cycle so he you know
S0421	yeah
S0423	but he do other stuff you know and we miss a couple of lap cos 's bike break down
S0421	oh
S0423	and then erm he say oh i'm not he cos we say oh you can use one of ours and he say no that's it i've have it now just erm me and be talk and say oh we're gonna have to go out sooner and have less of a break
S0423	before the next ride and then the other rider this personal trainer come back in cos he go out after
S0421	yeah
S0423	and he say oh i've just crash and i'm i've have enough i'm not go out again
S0423	so there be just should be four of us and this be like in the middle of the night as well
S0423	just me and look at each other then cos he go to bed after he decide he wasn't do any more and say oh alright i'll borrow this other bloke's bike then i'll come out and ride so we we probably might have do a couple more lap which would have push us up a lot higher
S0421	yeah
S0423	but i think we would have do much better than last year if it wasn't for the problems and i i crash i come off once and another rider go into the back of me and crash into me
S0421	how do that happen
S0423	well the hill you're go down
S0421	oh right
S0423	and when i go out a little bite of rain and it be like a grassy hill which you can go really quick on
S0421	yeah
S0423	so i go really quick and get past this rider and then unfortunately though just out of sight at the bottom of the hill
S0421	yeah
S0423	it come to a bite of a turn
S0421	yeah
S0423	so cos you're go so quick you've get to brake then and er take it so you slow down and take the turn but cos there be a bite of rain er that wheel just slide like on the grass and cos i come off he have to brake behind me and then he go and slam into me fortunately my bike be okay and i be okay i think we must have just pass by those original service because
S0423	i feel like we've do more than thirteen miles
S0421	yeah
S0423	and it's only one mile away now gloucester service
S0421	oh gloucestershire
S0423	that sound like it should be a posh one
S0421	mm
S0423	gloucester service i should think
S0421	yeah gloucestershire that's not spell like that's spell weird
S0423	no that's the town gloucester oh right
S0421	gloucestershire
S0423	yeah gloucestershire be yeah it's another one where
