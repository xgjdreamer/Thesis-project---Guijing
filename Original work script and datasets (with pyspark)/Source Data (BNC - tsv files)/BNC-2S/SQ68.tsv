S0510	oh wow
S0509	so yeah erm yeah so quite long but er
S0510	yeah
S0509	we be do we be start on the ted hughes poetry in literature
S0510	oh great
S0509	so the book be on its way isn't it yeah
S0510	it be yeah should be i'd imagine it'd be here this week actually by the end of the week anyway
S0509	yeah yeah so we be look at that we we're look at one where there's lot of nature and that which i would've prefer to look at birthday letter which be all about her
S0510	oh the sylvia plath the yeah
S0509	yeah cos i've get that already as well
S0510	oh yeah of course
S0509	that would've be good but
S0510	yeah when do you get that be that a couple of years ago now
S0509	no i think you give it to me
S0510	yeah i know yeah it be be weird but i be just try to think how long ago it be
S0509	it be i don't know
S0509	a yeah year and a half ago
S0510	yeah
S0509	yeah
S0510	cos there be one year we we do get you lot of book for your birthday didn't we
S0509	yeah
S0510	and i think that be one of many
S0509	oh right i don't know if it be my birthday
S0510	or be it christmas maybe christmas
S0509	i i dunno i feel like it wasn't for a celebration i feel like you just turn up with it one day and be like
S0509	oh yeah here
S0510	ah
S0509	because i remember put it on my bookshelf and i'm sure you'd just give it to me in the doorway but maybe not
S0510	oh yeah let's go with that one yeah i'm just always like yeah inundate you with book
S0509	erm
S0510	have a book have another book yeah
S0509	that would nice wouldn't it
S0510	yeah
S0509	and then
S0509	yeah so we're do that oh my gosh i be do all these note round it and i need to develop some kind of system for annotate because my page be full
S0510	yeah oh oh wow really
S0509	i be look at erm room with a view and that as well
S0510	yeah
S0509	and erm they don't have that much room around the text for annotate it's like ah
S0510	well you know what it be you know all these millions of different post it note that you've be acquire
S0509	yeah that's what i'm probably gonna use little sticky outy ones with
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	quote on this theme and i'm gonna use lot of highlight and
S0510	yeah
S0509	cos i've see like people use different colour highlighters or different colour erm underline pen for different theme
S0510	right
S0509	or character
S0510	i saw that you do that for your timetable actually you know you sort of colour cod
S0509	oh yeah
S0510	but yeah
S0509	yeah i do i do all the subject everything
S0509	colour highlighters excellent
S0510	yeah that's the way to go yeah yeah
S0509	yeah so we be do that and we have we have a different teacher today she seem okay she be alright erm
S0510	oh do you find out from uncle the name of erm his friend
S0509	it be
S0510	it be just a
S0509	and i have get an english teacher call
S0510	ah
S0509	so i'm presume it's her
S0510	so it's just one and the same yeah
S0509	yeah which be interest
S0510	yeah
S0509	but erm oh yeah and then there be english language and what be we do in english language oh my gosh i can't oh yeah we be give us all this vocabulary about syntaxes and
S0510	mm
S0509	morpheme and well
S0510	who phemes
S0509	morphemes
S0510	well i i've hear of morphine you know but not morphemes
S0509	and like very different
S0510	what morphemes two separate word or
S0509	no morpheme so one word and a morpheme
S0510	i've not hear of that before
S0509	be the smallest unit of language you can have so it's like
S0510	oh right
S0509	it's like anti or dis
S0510	right
S0509	instead so it have a mean but it's the smallest unit of language and then you combine morphemes to make a lexical term which be just a word
S0510	oh you're blow my mind now
S0509	and then it and then it go on and on with like eight different step it's ridiculous
S0510	oh wow oh well you
S0509	yeah
S0510	you'll be able to er impress grandad with all of that or certainly uncle anyway
S0509	that's a good idea
S0510	yeah
S0509	i feel that like grandad would know about all of that
S0510	mm mm
S0509	yes and now i've gotta do an essay on erm what be it oh on different er prescriptive versus descriptive in relation to grammar
S0510	oh yeah uhu
S0509	like whether we should just be like this be how you use grammar or or whether we should be like this be how grammar be be use
S0510	mm
S0509	and we also watch this documentary
S0510	mm
S0509	on this amazon tribe
S0510	oh yeah
S0509	and they have this really weird language that they can whistle and hum as well as speak it
S0510	oh god i'd love to see that
S0509	yeah it's interest but there's only three people in the world who can speak it and one of them be this linguist who's do all this research into them
S0510	outside of the tribe you mean
S0509	yeah outside of the tribe yeah outside of the tribe
S0509	there's only three people who can speak it outside of the tribe
S0510	oh right
S0509	and erm one of them be a linguist who's do all this research on them
S0510	mm mm
S0509	and er he he's say they don't have they don't have word for colour or number
S0510	right right
S0509	or a past or future tense
S0510	oh that's interest i'm sure there's another erm group of people that i dunno whether it be the aboriginals or i'm sure there's another group of people that don't use a sort of past
S0509	mm
S0510	or future
S0509	but
S0510	yeah
S0509	the thing be there's this guy who's like the father of modern linguistics and he's make
S0510	right
S0509	that he think there be these grammatical rule that be inherent
S0510	mm
S0509	in humans erm and this idea of the can't remember what it be but it's there's a word for it and it's basically the idea that you can keep add erm it's like recursive or something and
S0510	yeah
S0509	you can keep add different
S0510	mm
S0509	clauses to sentence to make it longer and you can do that infinitely
S0510	oh right
S0509	but in this and he say you can do that in any language that's in build in humans but you can't do it in this language this guy's say and they all hate him for it
S0510	uhu oh right
S0509	but it's like be he tell the truth because there be only three people that can speak this language
S0510	can speak it
S0509	so you know
S0510	yeah let's the other two people on board too yeah
S0509	but but now they're all be modernise and it's really sad
S0510	oh er so be they amazonian do you say
S0509	yeah
S0510	so because of all the terrible sort of log that's be do with the amazonian indians and move them out of their
S0509	well not they no actually
S0510	no
S0509	they've have people go in instal a school and a health clinic and things
S0510	oh i see
S0509	that's a bite more positive
S0510	right okay
S0509	but it's still like they're now teach all the children portuguese and stuff which be a shame
S0510	yeah
S0509	cos they're they they're obviously that language be gonna change and they're gonna start lose that language
S0510	yeah yeah yeah absolutely
S0509	erm yeah oh and erm meet up with today and meet some other music friends
S0510	oh yeah you say you be go to

S0510	but do you
S0509	yeah i do and it be fine
S0510	oh
S0509	it's not that difficult i just you know do things
S0510	yeah yeah absolutely
S0509	like at the bank earlier oh my goodness
S0510	oh gosh well yeah that be a bite of a bloom palaver wasn't it
S0509	it be it be yeah
S0510	but then bank generally be don't you know but
S0509	yeah
S0510	yeah it it's just yeah process isn't it and it doesn't always work
S0509	yeah but how do you find about out about the hash key thing because they don't tell you that do you just discover it or
S0510	the hash key thing
S0509	yeah that skip you past the options and then you're like
S0510	ah right it's just one to remember yeah cos well i'd be on the phone to them earlier
S0509	right
S0510	and er generally most i mean yeah like like most sort of automate service have a way to bypass the erm the multiple options it's like the bank you know when my bank as oppose to yours they generally number nine for my bank to bypass all those stupid options
S0509	oh right
S0510	so you can just actually speak to a real person
S0509	i want to speak to a person
S0510	and your bank it's
S0509	see to be fair their automate system do work
S0510	the hash tag
S0509	they just give me a really weird message
S0510	yeah yeah well it wasn't very complete be it
S0509	yeah no
S0510	it sort of didn't really tell you what you'd be successful do
S0509	well no it just tell me something else completely and i be like have i press the wrong button
S0509	but erm no at least i didn't end up talk to the same woman as before and those people'll just be like
S0510	er yeah
S0509	me again
S0510	yeah mind you they they be massive call centre i know you say that it sound like
S0509	yeah
S0510	you'd speak to this woman before but it's probably it be the newcastle call centre and you know it's such a strong distinctive accent
S0509	mm
S0510	that erm you i i i don't like to say they all sound the same but you know
S0509	i do think
S0510	when you're not use to hear an accent it can be that way
S0509	yeah that's right i mean i i probably wouldn't be able to distinguish between italian and german i'm just pathetically uncultured you know
S0510	i i i think you would i think you would don't
S0509	well no actually between italian and german i could
S0510	yeah
S0509	but the you know the italian guy in my form
S0510	yes
S0509	we do one of those two truths one lie thing
S0510	oh yeah yeah
S0509	where people have to guess what the lie be and one of his things be er i'm i'm from spain i'm spanish
S0510	right
S0509	and we be all like
S0509	be he tell the truth
S0509	be that i be like be that it didn't it didn't sound distinctly italian enough
S0509	and i be like
S0509	be er be this spanish
S0509	i don't know i study it for like five years but i still don't know
S0510	you get an a star but you still don't know
S0509	yeah
S0510	oh
S0509	that's me
S0510	it's just that it's that element of doubt be bring in it's it's funny how you know you you're kinda convince about things and then if somebody just drop in that seed
S0509	yeah
S0510	where you start doubt yourself
S0509	yeah
S0510	it's crazy where it sometimes lead you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	it's just like yeah just have confidence in the fact that yeah
S0509	mm
S0509	i think mine mine be erm i have a scar on my arm where i burn myself on the iron
S0510	oh yeah
S0509	which be true

S0510	oh right yeah
S0509	really think out these line and
S0510	concoct yeah

S0509	yeah i know you're right
S0509	but i just go with all crazy ones so they have nothing to distinguish
S0510	oh so how many get it right
S0509	er well no they just guess wrong they just guess wrong twice
S0510	right
S0509	so it's kind of people just yell at you what they think be the wrong one
S0510	ah you're right it's right
S0509	yeah
S0510	oh well i hope there be prize involve you know like chocolate type prize or
S0509	no that would've be nice wouldn't it
