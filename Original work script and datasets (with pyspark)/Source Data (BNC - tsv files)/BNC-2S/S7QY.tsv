S0264	have you have pepper
S0265	yes thank you yeah
S0264	and er we need to decide about that tuesday about get there for i i'll already i'll already be there
S0265	oh right
S0264	i'm have lunch there and and then there's the dentist at four o'clock
S0265	right well that's that's fine i can i can get there easily
S0264	do you think these vegetables be overdo
S0265	erm
S0264	mm
S0265	no i think they're fine
S0264	i think they're a bite overdo
S0265	i think they're just right actually
S0264	no the cauliflower be too soft you're what about eat
S0265	erm well i haven't think about it really but erm i'm assume i can erm eat at lunchtime and then just take sandwich for for for the even
S0264	oh no
S0265	how do would you prefer to eat out somewhere
S0264	well i'd i wouldn't in a way because it's it's gonna be very inconvenient er find anywhere that's decent and erm we need to find somewhere serve pre theatre dinners
S0265	yes
S0264	and then i suppose it would be sensible to find somewhere locally well because you wouldn't want a tube delay or something
S0265	no no be a prom concert it's it's likely that everywhere be go to be very busy
S0264	yeah i've see erm but erm well any anywhere that's any any good but on the other hand sandwich would be horrible because they might get spill or crumb everywhere
S0265	well we can just erm if it's nice weather we can just go out and find a bench somewhere and eat them
S0264	it'll be dark by that time at that time of year won't it
S0265	second of september no not not at seven thirty i don't think surely
S0264	well there's the polish place on exhibition road but but i notice they've take the carpet away and it be the food be never any good anyway
S0265	no i don't erm
S0264	mm
S0265	yes i i remember that er polish place and i didn't think the food be particularly interest
S0264	there's a german place next door
S0265	oh be there
S0264	yes the goethe institute or something i'm not sure if it's open in the even anyway and it's nothing special i wonder whether the best thing wouldn't be a hotel somewhere
S0265	mm expensive though probably
S0264	er well there's that erm there's that bistro place that erm well when go to in near in piccadilly in the basement but that could be quite noisy but they're quite efficient
S0265	mm well if they're efficient that might make up for the erm for the noisiness cos we won't be there quite so long
S0264	and it's very popular well i'll check erm i'll check that then because it's sort of on the right line isn't it
S0265	mm
S0264	er
S0265	on the right what
S0264	line
S0265	on the right line you mean right underground right i don't know i don't know which do be be you talk about the one that erm go to oh that be an italian restaurant wasn't it
S0264	you haven't be there
S0265	no right oh okay so i don't know where it be
S0264	it's just off piccadilly circus
S0265	oh right actually i don't know what tube you get to the royal albert hall be it the circle line piccadilly line
S0264	or victoria
S0265	oh
S0264	i think erm or erm or piccadilly
S0265	mm
S0264	hang on it's not victoria it's circle or piccadilly so actually it's quite good
S0265	yeah that's right
S0264	i suppose we could eat at the barbican but i don't like i don't i don't think the food's any any use there particularly
S0265	no it's it's out of the way as well it's not it's not near be it so we'd have to eat early
S0264	no er yeah because you could take the circle line but it would take age and also it's very dangerous because if you change er if you get the wrong you could end up you could end up in kensington high street by mistake because some of the circle line do the strange things
S0265	mm
S0264	they don't all and they also they're quite slow i think go around
S0265	yeah so what sort of a day have you have
S0264	i don't know erm just nonstop as usual what about you
S0265	yeah it be erm i manage to catch up on on my email and erm i do quite a few admin type task
S0264	tuesday
S0265	yeah
S0264	your meet day
S0265	it wasn't too bad for meet it be quite quiet today but we have erm what we call erm a town hall which be erm suppose to be an hour and a half but be only and hour
S0264	where
S0265	this it be this afternoon it be via it telephone conference
S0264	what from your desk
S0265	i ask i i dial in from my desk but erm you have the option of go to erm a a large room erm and listen to it
S0264	i think the whole point be to go somewhere
S0265	well this it's it could it's run from the state you see so the presenter be in the in new york and it be just erm it be just go through a slide a a powerpoint deck and erm
S0264	be there any be they really any ever any good
S0265	yes they i mean it's just sort of information share and an opportunity to ask question i mean we do it we do also have erm one by meet by video conference where the presenter be actually up on large and you couldn't actually see them up on a large screen
S0264	er it wasn't this one
S0265	as i say it be just a telephone
S0264	telephone audio
S0265	mm
S0264	why be they try to save money on video cameras or something
S0265	yeah erm it's the it's the format that our particular boss prefer i suppose cos he's not he's it wasn't erm a company wide one it be specifically for our area which be more urgent
S0264	maybe the maybe the technical quality be actually better than the video conferencing i mean nowadays there's no excuse for not get a very good special phone line like broadcast you know when you have a a broadcast from a studio
S0265	yes
S0264	they have special line so they don't sound like telephone and when they do sound like telephone it's because somebody's use an ordinary bt phone or even worse a mobile or
S0265	mm
S0264	even worse that one of those skype things
S0265	mm well i think they're just ordinary bt line
S0264	well that's not very good cos
S0265	well
S0264	they could afford better than that couldn't they
S0265	they could do but
S0264	yeah
S0265	i i'm not complain because erm i can usually hear quite clearly i can hear better listen to someone down the telephone than i can sit in a room where
S0264	mm
S0265	the the sound be come out of speakers even though i can see them talk on a video screen
S0264	yeah but suppose they have a broadcast quality phone line whatever that's call you you might be able to hear better still
S0265	yeah maybe but i mean we we do have erm we do have some a very high quality video conference facility but it's it's in quite a small room so you can only have
S0264	google plus
S0265	can only have that with erm small group
S0264	how many
S0265	erm you could probably get about twenty people in that in that room
S0264	you mean they can all be see
S0265	yeah it's like one side of the room you can actually see erm a group of people er er on your the end of the line and see if they be sit on the opposite side of the table and they can see you
S0264	but be they really on the opposite side of the table
S0265	no
S0264	i mean what
S0265	no of course not but they they
S0264	no but i mean be they sit in a line
S0265	yes
S0264	then why don't they sit in a semicircle
S0265	well it be a semicircle actually yes you're right and i think there be about three cameras which er be train on you but
S0264	operate automatically or by a human
S0265	i think it's just automatic but what what's strange about them be that when someone's look at you they tend to look at you on the screen and not in the camera so when they're look at you they appear not to be look at you so that that's a bite confuse sometimes cos you're not quite sure if they're talk to you personally
S0264	yeah well
S0265	or
S0264	one of the students do something like that last week because they go to find a different classroom and then they phone up from a room that they'd find and one of them must have be hold the phone as a camera so you could see the face of the other one it wasn't possible that the person make the call be hold i don't think it wouldn't have be possible would it
S0265	i don't know
S0264	do you think the person make the call cos i saw their face the face of the person speak and i assume the phone be be hold by the other person because there be two of them
S0265	mm possibly cos i think it must be difficult to speak and think about what you're say and and and and hold it steady at the same time
S0264	and how do he know also how do he know that he be in the picture
S0265	mm
S0264	in the frame
S0265	i don't know cos
S0264	and then and then and then well cos he must have be erm the er the mirror image of erm of my situation where one of the students in in the room where we be be hold his hold the phone for me to see so presumably that be on camera as well
S0265	mm
S0264	so i could i couldn't see myself obviously i could only see erm this person in the other build
S0265	well we we've do some meet where we've use some application like skype where where you actually in the corner of the screen you get a a small picture which show you what
S0264	yeah we do that
S0265	people the other end can see
S0264	what for
S0265	it it show you what the people at the other end can actually see of it
S0264	well we have erm split screen for erm the speaker and any powerpoint that they're use so that when it's when it's broadcast or record but and play back later you can see both the speaker and the slide
S0265	oh
S0264	but that mean the speaker be often minute doesn't though
S0265	you
S0264	it shouldn't have to be minute but they be in one in the one i use today anyway the er this morning
S0265	mm well we have erm we've have meet where you where the presenter be go through slide and they tend to switch between him and the slide
S0264	yeah but that must be a that's the whole point that's what i suppose our system try to avoid because that could be quite irritate because you're not in control of when you switch from the from the slide to the speaker be you or vice versa
S0265	no we're not in control of it no but it's like when you
S0264	yeah so what if you're look at something and you haven't finish interpret
S0265	yeah that yeah well that's it exactly it's like when you're watch the news
S0264	yeah well the answer be not to watch it they you know it
S0265	that be quite difficult
S0264	it
S0265	try to read something anyway while they're speak cos i can't i can't read and take it in and listen at the same time anyway
S0264	well i doubt whether a lot of people can't i think cos the speakers be probably they don't stop long enough to let people take things in
S0265	no they don't no
S0264	so be it next week that your mother's come
S0265	no it's it's the week of the proms concert
S0264	so it's not next week it's the week after be it
S0265	it must be well let's work it out
S0264	i i don't need to work it out i've get my diary right here and it and so i don't need to i can just look it up if i want to
S0265	well the concert's three weeks today shall i shut this window now
S0264	yes please probably midges or insects that will come oh actually they're not come it's nearly three weeks
S0265	yes it's three weeks or just over three weeks
S0264	well thank goodness i'll be on leave that week sort of but i don't know whether i'll feel like eat much after a luncheon oh no that er the other thing about these trousers i really i i don't think i'm i can be bother to to either to take i i don't think the iron will iron out those things because they're probably steam or manufacture in it doesn't say anything i i look
S0265	mm you you could be right the they've obviously be do like that but for effect and
S0264	yeah
S0265	they're mean to to be ruck apart like
S0264	it's really annoy and i could take them back she say i could anyway er the the the assistant but but i need a i need a new pair of trousers anyway
S0265	mm
S0264	the trouble be they're not really suitable for work be they they're alright in the summer i suppose
S0265	yeah
S0264	but may but maybe not
S0265	though i think that make them look a bite too too informal
S0264	maybe i should take them back then
S0265	i think well
S0264	it's just a gigantic waste of time i only
S0265	you've get to take the other one back anyway aren't you the top be you take that back
S0264	i don't know do you do you want it
S0265	no no thank you
S0264	erm because i'm not even sure about the quality though i when i when i undo the button they didn't undo very easily i don't think it's be make with great care the button and the button hole be
S0265	well it's probably cheap clothe
S0264	yeah and that's what annoy me because if you can get it the same thing or similar from primark for a couple of quid i only go to get a a a a a card er a congratulations card
S0265	mm
S0264	and then we didn't need anything else and so but then i think oh yeah i'd use that coupon erm and i find out i could use it on clothe so i think i'll have a look and see if there's anything on sale and so that's what i i notice those two things but obviously really i would have buy erm a long sleeved shirt if i if there'd be one on sale but there wasn't
S0265	mm yes so have you try those trousers on
S0264	in the shop
S0265	oh
S0264	they're not not a particularly good fit
S0265	no
S0264	they're a bite big actually oddly around the waist
S0265	really
S0264	well they must make them bigger than they say
S0265	well a thirty two aren't they around the waist and it's
S0264	yes
S0265	mm maybe they shrink maybe they're the sort of cotton that shrink
S0264	yeah but then they won't be no it's more likely that they're like mark and spencer's they just make everything bigger than the than the size that they say they be i just want to go home early to carry on with this other work stuff anyway i just i want to get that's my task for tonight i want to get all of that do and dust and then that's out of the way
S0265	mm
S0264	and so i'd er you know i i didn't i just think it would be a quick trip on the way home but that's why when it when it mushroom into something complicate
S0265	i just put them by the door and then or keep them in the car and just remember to return them next time you go to
S0264	well
S0265	sainsbury's
S0264	i think i would forget it if i put them in the car boot cos i don't open it well it's still full of junk from when the house be tidy
S0265	oh right be that book
S0264	i don't know just general rubbish whatever couldn't go anywhere else have you be check zoopla
S0265	not not since i've get back
S0264	well you ought to look and then you could see that house that i've that erm that i mention and see what
S0265	yeah i'll have a look for it yes
S0264	i know where it be it's where it's that one where you road where you go under the railway bridge and you can't turn right and i think it's there of course they've photograph it so it look as if it's semi seclude and in a quiet road
S0265	mm yes well well
S0264	but you wouldn't do anyway it's too late now because it's be sell
S0265	it's sell right that's
S0264	and i'm not and like i say i'm not even sure that i want to go to the hassle of all and all the expense of move some somewhere further into this place i'm not even sure i like particularly like and the only that's the and these seagulls have be drive me mad this year
S0265	mm i've not notice them since i've be back particularly
S0264	yeah they've quieten down a bite
S0265	yes i think i think really it's it's time something be do about them because they seem to be get worse year after year and so it can't just keep go on can it
S0264	well it do it do in be it where they try to shoot them and then there be a big fuss about it
S0265	mm well perhaps there be other ways of control them like erm break their egg
S0264	poison put some fox up on the roof
S0265	okay you'll end up with fox as well
S0264	what's your evidence
S0265	i think well i just think i see i see them a lot
S0264	where
S0265	here
S0264	when
S0265	around and about i see them quite often well not not recently because i've not be walk at dusk but when it do get dark i've quite often see one walk across the the road and there's some that live in that little island
S0264	be there
S0265	or well they go in there
S0264	really
S0265	yeah and i've see them up erm up the driveway as well up the drive be it the drive
S0264	well that remind me i've get this thing to do and then oh yeah i've get to find another companion piece for that and then any day in fact i think i might come home and find this this other thing wait and then that'll be quite stressful and that's why i want to get this out of the way because if one of those come through the letterbox then that'd be that's it that's another thing on top of work
S0265	mm
S0264	and it mean you you know when it's a a nice even well you can't go out anyway unless you go for a run and then it's all over in thirty minutes or so
S0265	oh
S0264	erm oh say something erm nice today er she find erm apparently erm you know that do i tell you about that erm write up for erm didn't i that they use the paper in where be it that didn't go this year
S0265	i don't know i can't remember you even
S0264	they use it they use it as a an example of of er how to write up a report of your presentation
S0265	right
S0264	so they and and it's er and they put it online
S0265	oh this be your example
S0264	yeah
S0265	oh that's good
S0264	er but even better they've do all the all the work of put in little box and things say er this be this be this achieve the purpose of x or this be good because it's so they've label it all anyway and put little comment all around and it's on it's as a pdf i'll show you later
S0265	oh right yes
S0264	but i don't know where erm well presumably there's a link to it from the main site
S0265	mm
S0264	and that and that explain why i've be get these email from these people overseas cos i think i i just assume well i guess it be to do with that write up because of the subject cos the topic erm and so i assume that they'd be be present at the at the workshop
S0265	mm
S0264	but obviously well more probably they've they've just they weren't there at all but they they've find or see it online
S0265	yeah mm
S0264	so it just make you realise it's important but that blog i don't think a single person's look at it
S0265	be that where that thing be
S0265	where it's be that where it be on a blog
S0264	no of course it's not i'm talk about my blog
S0265	right oh your
S0264	nobody's
S0265	oh right and the other one you be write a few weeks ago
S0264	yes you've get to
S0265	mm
S0264	do it every week really and you've get to like link it and have twitter and all this stuff and oh i think it would drive me mad you'd you'd always have you'd always have to be engage and
S0265	yes
S0264	mess around and you'd probably have car accidents and things
S0265	mm i can imagine yes
S0264	and the other thing i can imagine be that you'd engineer situations to write about
S0265	in order to keep the momentum
S0264	yeah
S0265	go and
S0264	that wouldn't be very ethical would it
S0265	no
S0264	or erm at least erm you'd have to have your antennae out and be notice things all the time and perhaps you if you have the mm luxury of reflection and time to reflect on stuff maybe you could think back over your day and you'd and you'd pick out a few interest things to write about but if normally you didn't have time and you just go from one thing to the other then
S0265	mm well if there's if there's no activity on a on a blog people will quickly lose interest i mean i
S0264	but why would they they wouldn't why would they see it in the first place
S0265	erm i don't know the
S0264	you have to put a link
S0265	it yeah the they would be look for something in particular they would be look for something so they may do a hash search for something so
S0264	oh
S0265	you need to make sure that when you create your blog on twitter or whatever it be
S0264	it
S0265	it need to have hashtag doesn't it or something like that
S0264	i do put a hash thing i think but erm it's probably a meaningless one cos i didn't think about the consequences
S0265	cos i er i yes you do or because you have to you use it as a search thing so your your hash the
S0264	but that's twitter isn't it
S0265	that's twitter yes i've only use twitter
S0264	yeah but do you think the same apply to blog perhaps
S0265	i don't know
S0264	i don't understand it's all too it's all a bite i don't even i think google have do it on purpose because i have never succeed yet in erm sign out of that page
S0265	oh
S0264	i don't even know properly how to sign in i just have to mess around and suddenly it appear
S0265	oh
S0264	and then and then i have to crash out i just
S0265	so where where be the site be it erm be it an internal
S0264	it's no it's blogger it's google google blogger or whatever
S0265	oh right well
S0264	but i think they've make it like that on purpose so you can't escape so once you're in there you just stay there all day or
S0265	yeah
S0264	or have it open on your screen somewhere all the time
S0265	mm i don't know
S0264	you know cos you that that hotmail be do that at one time if you remember the the thing to log out be suddenly disappear or be make tiny and it be right up in the top it be where you don't didn't look well they make it almost invisible
S0265	mm
S0264	no i i think it must ruin people's eye cos they they make the screen so busy with different banners and colour and little bits and then they say oh you can always enlarge it and in fact of course there's a legislative requirement that you should be able to do things like enlarge and turn volume up because of disabilities
S0265	yes of course
S0264	but you can't you still it doesn't work because if you're try to read script if you're try to read text on er on the on the screen
S0265	mm
S0264	if you enlarge it a great deal then you lose you've always gotta be move the the page around
S0265	yes you're gonna use more
S0264	from leave to right
S0265	it's more it's more awkward yes
S0264	in fact and and that isn't the way that your eye would work with hard copy because you might be jump around with your eye i mean and then they'll stop you jump around the screen
S0265	mm
S0264	i don't think and there be this er we we watch this erm dot com presentation today which turn out to be far too long it erm i hadn't erm i hadn't notice and it be all on and there be a this speaker have a photograph of er her daughter and her friend in the kitchen of course it be it be north america and erm they be perch on these stool it must have be north america and erm they be all erm hunch over their mobile phone and texting somebody else so their body language they they're all they all have their back to each other and they just might as well have be on mar or somewhere
S0265	yes someone be say the other day that erm he say with all the technology we've get you you can go you can go a day without talk to anyone
S0264	yeah because you're busy texting
S0265	you're busy texting and it's you don't need to go into a bank anymore and you've get the atms and you do your shop erm
S0264	yeah but when you do go into a bank you've gotta make sure that you erm adhere to the the the scrap have you cut those plant
S0265	yes why
S0264	because i tell you there's er something on the windowpane especially when it be windy over the weekend
S0265	oh could you still hear something blow
S0264	scrap across the glass
S0265	oh right oh maybe it's grow back again but i cut it i do cut it right back
S0264	well maybe it's not that window maybe i can hear maybe it's that one
S0265	mm i'll have to have a look
S0264	have you notice next door hasn't put anything out in front of the window
S0265	what do you mean
S0264	they must have they must have do they put a concrete on where you know where we've get a flowerbed there
S0265	yeah
S0264	and they've get concrete
S0265	yes it's always be like that i
S0264	what it ever well in before they get there
S0265	oh no not not before they get there i don't remember what be there before they get there but they er i think it's more than likely that they redo it or they
S0264	what when they have the drive do you think
S0265	no i think it be before then
S0264	one of their little scheme
S0265	mm yeah it's
S0265	it's be it's be luck like that for some time why what what's the point you're try to make
S0264	that there's nothing there they're just be leave
S0265	oh yeah cos they take all their pot or most of them
S0264	most you mean they leave some
S0265	they leave they've leave some things haven't they
S0264	i don't know i haven't look i haven't want to look
S0265	yes i mean next door she's not do anything have she yet
S0264	no well thank it's good in a way but in another way it's a bad omen i think cos
S0265	mm
S0264	it mean that things be just go to slide and get worse
S0265	well she's not cut the grass cos there be a couple of fellas come round last tuesday be it last tuesday when i be work from home erm a couple of fellas and i think one of them be her father or uncle or something
S0264	do you mean she's not even employ anybody to do it
S0265	no i think she i think her family's do it for her
S0264	why
S0265	well she's work all the time
S0264	yeah but why but nag but er if she can afford why can't she afford to get one of the many many local landscape
S0265	well presumably because her family have offer to do it for her for free
S0264	it's a bite well a bite weird isn't it
S0265	not necessarily no that's what
S0264	i think it's weird because it look the whole house and just one person
S0265	mm
S0264	but that on the other hand it just show you how small these house be they be never mean for children for a start
S0265	no not for children no
S0264	no because they're not they're not large enough and that's why erm very there have be very very few in this place
S0265	mm
S0264	in fact it be a bite it's maybe that's why they've go from the erm corner
S0265	mm probably but cos they're get quite old probably those those children they're both teenagers now
S0264	probably
S0265	they do but they they create two room out of the out of your room they they create
S0264	do they how do you know
S0265	because i think we go she show us didn't she
S0264	no but no the bathroom be you not get confuse with because that's what they do with their daughter's
S0265	yeah they i know they do but i've not see theirs
S0264	oh
S0265	but it's we've we've see 's
S0264	but i don't
S0265	it's it's when she take us round the house
S0264	yes i but i that i i don't i don't remember what they look like er but i remember i think i remember 's
S0265	well i've never be inside 's so
S0264	cos that be quite cleverly do well i i mm i don't think i'm confuse the two house be you sure that you're not think about 's upstairs cos they do it very neatly with make wardrobes from those erm place under the roof
S0265	well maybe it be 's
S0264	she show us
S0265	no i'm i'm i'm pretty sure it be
S0264	but i don't think she give us a tour of the whole house she show us the bathroom and the kitchen i think but that i don't
S0265	and and she she use use she use that space under the
S0264	's
S0265	's as well
S0264	for what
S0265	cupboards
S0264	oh anyway it's a disaster because when eventually people be go to you know this er environmental categories what be it d or e or f or something
S0265	mm don't know d or e i think
S0264	so if you you know like if you have the choice if i have the choice i'd go for i'd go for a brand new in fact the the best thing would be to have one design properly from scratch and build from nothing you just buy buy some
S0265	mm
S0264	land build it properly like the one that i saw in near near park they use wood nowadays you know cherry wood and things and they have the solar panel and everything new and and clean and so on and erm none none of this horrible asbestos stuff and badly design roof and waste space you have it do properly from scratch i think that's the best thing and then okay so that would be an a presumably
S0265	mm
S0264	and then why would you expect anybody to buy this place when it's a d or e or something
S0265	mm if they're environmentally conscious conscientious then yes i quite agree
