S0421	i be like he be cos he be say it back to me in the english and i be like do you want me to say it in english i be like why do you like say it in and erm
S0423	he maybe just want to check that he have it correct and
S0421	and then and then he keep say say it again like after i'd say like two number and then he be like oh i think there be a one and i like 0 seven it start with 0 seven
S0423	be you sure you say it right in
S0421	of course i do i'm like the number of course i say the number right and i say them clearly as well and right and he just he be just like one and i be like zero doesn't sound anything like one
S0423	be that what you say back to him
S0421	no but that's what i be think
S0423	why didn't you just look at your phone when he be on the phone
S0421	because it doesn't come it be come up like plus four four or something i don't know
S0423	oh yeah
S0421	but on yours it didn't
S0423	you could've just put mine on loudspeaker and look at the number it would've be on the screen
S0421	yeah but he's he be use his credit and i could tell that he be like he be like what
S0423	oh
S0421	what be it cos i call you on my phone out of the packet and he be like what be it tell me so i be like i'll call you back
S0423	oh that's why he didn't understand why cos he be anxious about
S0421	no no because then i ring him back
S0423	oh right oh yeah
S0421	cos i be like i can't i don't know what this number be so i be like i'll ring you back do you know what i bet i bet what he be do now that i think about it be that he be say it back in english because as i be tell him he be tell the person who be write his number down cos he need to give it to them so i bet he be talk to me and as i be say zero and then they be probably write it down at like as he be say in
S0423	yeah he be probably have a three way conversation that's why he get confuse cos he's probably say it to them he come back to you and then they repeat back to him then he's probably
S0423	then they've say the wrong one so then he's ask you then well be it this
S0421	but yeah i hope he doesn't have to pay
S0423	no no the woman she just the second one she know what she's do
S0421	yeah
S0423	she's an administrator not a receptionist so the woman in the room
S0421	yeah
S0423	she just say erm she explain and oh i've get the card so that's all i need
S0421	oh right
S0423	then it say oh i'll have your passport as well just as an extra and that be it she say right she didn't even say don't worry no never mention it
S0421	anything about money
S0423	no you know that other one
S0421	otherwise yeah otherwise she would have say like oh we need this they like there's go to be a payment or whatever but
S0423	yeah there be no mention of i need this cos you have to pay
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos you just wouldn't say that you'd just say have you get it if you're say no i've get nothing
S0421	yeah
S0423	say well if you can't get that you'll have to pay
S0421	yeah
S0423	whereas this receptionist say oh this be very expensive this thing you know we can't just do it for anyone and if we do that everyone's go to be come over
S0423	you know just and obviously your grandad be probably get worry now literally it could be thousands of pound
S0421	yeah because they right they get that they get that letter and erm
S0423	well in the letter it's not clear as well
S0421	erm
S0423	cos it doesn't say if you're a visitor and you're in the eu it say if you're not a resident
S0421	yeah
S0423	and you can't prove you're a resident you might have to pay
S0421	yeah
S0423	so that's not very helpful either
S0421	no
S0423	it's only when i start think well
S0421	yeah because cos grandma and grandad be go to buy something but they're not now because they're wait to see if they have to pay anything
S0423	right
S0421	i don't know what it be they want to buy but they be go to buy something but now they're like no no cos we might have to pay
S0423	well you know i wouldn't stop them buy it cos if there be a bill they they're not go to be able to pay it i think it's go to be i think it would cost a lot of money that
S0421	yeah
S0423	for all the visit to the hospital for the i think it it's probably a surgical procedure that it's class as
S0421	yeah
S0423	and they don't very expensive to have anything kind of surgery i know it's not surgery but it's class surgical
S0421	yeah
S0423	then you know if he do have to pay he'd be back do refer it to his the health people of his country and let them
S0421	yeah
S0423	do it but he wouldn't have to pay cos
S0421	no
S0423	cos he didn't say anything and he have the card you know there's health restrictions on that card the reason they have it be because then they can contact the the right country and the right department that deal with
S0421	yeah
S0423	their citizens and they could claim that money back that they need to claim can't they
S0421	yeah
S0423	i mean they may not even do it that way they might do it say at the end of the year and get a feel for say
S0421	yeah like this many people
S0423	they may have do so many english people
S0421	yeah
S0423	and that'll that'll kind of counter out so much of the bill won't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	well i would imagine there'd be probably more over here than english over there but
S0421	yeah
S0423	plus i i think they've probably get a certain agreement because there'd be a bite of an imbalance in what that would cost in to what it would cost over here
S0421	yeah
S0423	it's a bite unfair if they even have to pay the whole english price for it
S0421	yeah
S0423	just show you if you're go to a non eu country it's worse isn't it
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	health insurance there's that plus cos you do i read anyway stories where people say they've be in the hospital and in certain countries they won't see them until they get their credit card out and pay
S0421	yeah
S0423	i don't think they'd ever do that in this country they'd always treat you if you're really ill
S0421	yeah
S0423	they will make sure you're you know you're treat afterwards
S0421	oh yeah what it be be that erm i think if you have a bill of over a thousand pound there they won't let you back into their country
S0423	oh it say that on the letter then you they'll consider not let you back in
S0421	yeah but they would treat you
S0423	yeah
S0421	but you probably wouldn't be able to come again until you pay it
S0423	i mean cos doctor they wouldn't refuse they take a an oath in this country don't they
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	to treat anyone that need medical assistance
S0421	to like erm do anything possible to like save the most live
S0423	yeah
S0421	but yeah like you be say in america the ambulance won't come for you if you've not get health insurance
S0423	yeah it's hard to imagine anyone who's involve in the medical profession not help somebody who need assistance and i think doctor probably would it's all these people in between
S0421	yeah well they like they would but then if like they help them then like who's go to pay for that
S0423	yeah it's like if you're on a plane and somebody's ill they say oh if you're travel say oh be there a doctor around or an emergency
S0421	yeah
S0423	the doctor doesn't say well yeah i'm a doctor but i'm not treat him until after he give me some cash
S0423	they pay they treat people don't they
S0421	yeah
S0423	they try to erm do what they can for them obviously if it's not urgent then they they probably won't they'd say well go and see a doctor
S0421	yeah if it's like ah i've have this ache in my eye like for the past month
S0423	yeah i imagine any anywhere you would think in the world that if somebody be there be an emergency then they would treat them wouldn't you
S0421	yeah but if like say if you be like on a plane though and someone be choke like they would help them or if like but if they have something that require medication like obviously they wouldn't have it with them so they wouldn't be able to
S0423	yeah yeah there's limitations
S0421	yeah
S0423	we're not far off now
S0421	mm
S0423	not too bad be it your grandad for a taxi it's probably even twenty five pound at least
S0421	yeah
S0423	or he could be spend two hours to get to get over on public transport
S0421	he wouldn't use public transport do you know what he do though right cos he go to to get that photocopier
S0423	yeah
S0421	that thing photocopy and he go to the bus stop and erm
S0423	i be go to say he didn't get a taxi to
S0421	no and no bus be come
S0423	yeah
S0421	erm they be all go to and
S0423	do he walk
S0421	yeah walk it take him an hour and he walk
S0423	yeah it's it's only a few miles isn't it it's not very far so
S0421	be you be that like a reasonable thing like i be like what he walk
S0423	well yeah to you're not that far
S0421	it's because there's not a straight bus go to from
S0423	oh really
S0421	yeah you have to change
S0423	well he you'd think he would have walk towards and then pick up the bus on the way wouldn't you
S0421	well like he keep look to see the other bus that come past him but it didn't
S0423	mm i suppose it i suppose he must be feel fit enough to do that if you're ill you wouldn't do that i don't suppose
S0421	yeah but erm i don't know because he be like they couldn't see a bus so he have to walk and i be just like should have just go to
S0423	yeah well yeah why why go to
S0421	he say he know a bite better than but he could've go to i be just like cos i be like why be he go so long cos then when he come back he be like oh yeah i find one really quick like somewhere to photocopy and oh and it's cos he walk that's why he be go most of the day
S0423	yeah and how do he know where to find one
S0421	he be just look in everywhere yeah
S0423	could've just go to the library
S0421	which one
S0423	well there's one in
S0421	be there maybe he's he
S0423	just you would've think there'd be one don't know if there's one in but you would've think there'd be one closer than that but maybe not
S0421	well because i i ask at the post office cos i ask the post office and i say do you know where i could find somewhere to photocopy
S0423	oh right
S0421	and she be like oh there's not really anywhere that do it now there might be a computer shop in that do it
S0423	oh right yeah
S0421	and i be like i say that to him but he didn't want to cos he think if he go to and it's not there then there
S0423	he could've to rather than
S0421	then there's not there's not many place in er
S0423	not
S0421	well it's the same thing
S0423	it's completely different one have a d on the end and the other doesn't
S0423	and there's a big difference in the place
S0423	one's a big one of the biggest cities in the country
S0421	so cos it be be a small place so he be like oh i won't go there i'll go to instead
S0423	mm yeah they use to it use to be good for photocopy cos they use to have them in all the newsagents didn't they two p or five p
S0421	yeah they've get in they've get a well they use to when we be there they have a photocopy one for the newsagents
S0423	yeah use to see them in most ah newsagents they must have stop do it they mustn't be do so good
S0421	people mustn't need it really
S0423	yeah it's not a thing thing people need very commonly be it
S0421	no
S0423	no it's a handy thing when they be in the shop
S0421	yeah i mean you've not even get a printer
S0423	erm no i know i should get one but i i mean i don't need it that often and when i do i can always get stuff print off in the library
S0421	yeah yeah i suppose it might be quite dear for you to run a printer and if you're like never really
S0423	yeah well no the only reason i'd get it be oh i want to start do photos on it and print them off and
S0421	oh you'd get a photographic printer or photographic paper
S0423	yeah that's the only one i'd get but yeah the that for a normal one it's not worth it i may as well just go to the erm library on the occasion i need it
S0421	mm
S0423	i want to be in the leave lane i think
S0421	where be this
S0423	this be
S0421	be it
S0423	don't you know
S0421	no
S0423	you've be to haven't you
S0421	i know of course i have but i don't recognise it
S0423	this be a new development all this be quite
S0421	oh
S0423	and they have a cinema and restaurants and
S0421	mm
S0423	so you wouldn't recognise this bite this be all new
S0421	yeah but like i don't even recognise and
S0423	i would've think maybe you might 's change a little bite since last time since they have the tram in make some change
S0421	i i recognise the bowl thing but other than that
S0423	yeah it look erm a bite of a mess at the moment really erm but i think they're start they're go to start do something similar to that you know a a shop thing with shop and cinema and stuff like that
S0421	oh right yeah
S0423	so it will improve in the next few years right we're just round it's just up the road from here it be
S0421	so why be it call this thing
S0423	no it's it's not hospital it's old road it's on
S0421	mm
S0423	so that's where this be so it's only up the road from but this be old road
S0421	oh right
S0423	if you go straight up that road it will lead straight to eventually
S0421	cos i be say to grandad and he be like even after cos i be like no erm it's in and he's like no no it's in it say it's in on road
S0423	that's what he say to me come here
S0421	yeah
S0423	and i say no cos i have the thing here that say oh it's road but he say no no
S0421	yeah yeah yeah
S0423	it's and i though oh right well i've i'll we'll soon find out
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos we're go to be in the wrong place
S0421	yeah
S0423	but it do it say cos i look it up as well on the on online
S0421	yeah
S0423	and it's old road so i don't know why your grandad be think old road
S0421	i i i don't and he look at it he read it to me and he be like see
S0423	really
S0421	and he be like yeah and he be like look at it and he be like yeah see it be road in
S0423	but do you then look at what he be read
S0421	no i i didn't look
S0423	oh okay
S0421	cos he he have it and i be like oh right i be like and he be like mm be like i be like
S0423	unless that be directions from somewhere cos there be a old road
S0421	yeah and he's like oh it doesn't matter cos if you put it in the sit nav it'll take you there and i be like yeah but but it would be good to know if you're go to or like
S0423	yeah cos that's what your mam say at first say it's i say oh i
S0421	cos that's what grandad come home say
S0423	oh right but he even say it today
S0421	no one no one no one yeah i know and then after cos you'd look at it and say
S0423	and then he give me and i say it's not and i say oh i'll take them anyway cos it's hard to get to from
S0421	yeah
S0423	so
S0421	but erm yeah like i even after you tell us it be and i be say to him no no and he be like no cos i
S0421	but you know before you'd look at it we'd not look at it and he just come home say and we be like oh right
S0423	oh right right
S0421	and then he's still say i don't know
S0423	and then when we get on this road
S0421	yeah
S0423	there's a sign say
S0421	yeah
S0423	and he say see
S0423	yeah i just
S0421	yeah yeah yeah
S0423	give up at that point
S0421	sometimes you have to yeah they're a bite like that
S0423	well here's a sign you can see it see the sign this way
S0421	yeah
S0423	so he must be think i be right it be
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	there's a sign we're go to now but it it's up the road just outside
S0421	i know yeah sometimes like i'm talk to them like either one of them and then they say things and i'm just like okay yes now next bite i'm
S0423	yeah i'm too hot what be i do with this coat on
S0421	i know i take mine off i be sensible even though it cost me a couple of second without my seatbelt on
S0423	that's dangerous behaviour that be surprise at you
S0421	yeah cos in those couple of second someone be go to crash into us
S0423	it take a millisecond you don't know what be go on behind you do you
S0423	some idiot all of a sudden before you know it he's in the back of you and then you'll be through the front window
S0421	yeah although no cos the airbags be come
S0423	oh right you could have black eye and bruise from the airbag
S0421	but yeah i would it i would anyway if i have my seatbelt on but yeah generally it's a good idea to wear a seatbelt
S0423	you know i'm surprise listen to you defend take it off
S0421	i mean it's not the worst thing but like i i'm sure there be one person who get like strangle by their seatbelt
S0423	it might have be a child and they weren't wear a seat
S0421	yeah
S0423	i think we're here now
S0421	although on children in general it can be quite dangerous to have a seatbelt cos it can crush like your rib and stuff
S0423	yeah but it's not as dangerous as not have one
S0421	yeah
S0423	you'd rather have crush rib can you imagine the damage of go through that windscreen you'd be travel at the same time as like the same speed as the car when you hit it
S0421	yeah
S0423	so the car stop and if the belt doesn't stop you you're do the same speed as the car
S0421	yeah
S0423	you know what i think i should've turn right back there
S0421	you know you know like if there's airbags can you go through the windscreen
S0423	not if they if they work
S0421	yeah if they yeah yeah but i suppose like you would be bash like back and forth wouldn't you cos if you didn't have your seatbelt so
S0423	oh you mean if you didn't have it would the airbags work
S0421	yeah
S0423	well well you know your momentum could possibly because you're go along at a bigger speed
S0421	go through the yeah
S0423	they're they're design really to have it on with a
S0421	yeah
S0423	seatbelt on so you you might end up you could possibly end up burst the the
S0421	do they have flour in them
S0423	no there be kind of a powder
S0421	yeah
S0423	it's probably an explosive powder isn't it
S0421	oh right great
S0423	well that's cos they it need an explosion to to kind of get them open instantly doesn't it
S0421	ah do you know flour be explosive
S0423	be it
S0421	yeah
S0423	like what when you mix it with something
S0421	no when you throw it in the air like if you yeah if you i'm not sure what it be exactly but if you throw it in the air like if you burst a bag of flour
S0423	oh no it be still further up i think i should have turn further back i recognise this inn we're nearly there now if you do what
S0421	if you if you burst a bag of flour and it's all in the air and there's like a a flame it'll all explode
S0423	oh right if you if you have a very high flame on you
S0421	there'll be an explosion not a high one you could
S0423	oh right
S0421	like you could do it with the stave on probably
S0423	oh right
S0421	if it be close enough
S0423	yeah that all like it's it mean it's combustible be it
S0421	well highly combustible
S0423	oh right
S0421	it be quite a
S0423	there it be do you want to phone your grandad tell him we're at the entrance then
S0421	yeah
S0423	erm ask him
S0421	i don't know what entrance it be though oh i'll just say we're at the yeah i'll know what i'll say yeah
S0423	just say which car park be should we meet him in
S0421	okay
