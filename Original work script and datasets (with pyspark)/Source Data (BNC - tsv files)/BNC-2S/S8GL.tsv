S0259	he he have his moments he have his days he can have
S0255	yeah
S0259	good days and then he just go silly again
S0255	mm
S0259	our english teacher ring me last week
S0255	mm
S0259	cos he weren't do like she ask in his lesson and he's like well i don't really care and
S0255	yeah
S0259	and i say to him well you do care cos it's english and it's one of those things that you've gotta have
S0255	you need to get your english yeah
S0259	and the teacher say well he can do it she say it's just stupid it's like take him ten minutes to get a book out
S0255	that's probably more frustrate yeah
S0259	cos he's do and i think why be you ring me about things like that
S0255	yeah
S0259	that's more control the classroom
S0255	yeah that's it
S0259	or the bunch of kid
S0255	yeah
S0259	than threaten to ring me
S0255	yeah he's not do anything that's actually that bad
S0259	no and i think
S0255	so she need to just work a way of say
S0259	mm
S0255	get your thing out do this do this
S0259	now you know
S0255	yeah
S0259	or leave the room
S0255	yeah exactly yeah to make it more serious
S0259	cos a not keep ring me with petty things like that she's only a young lass
S0255	yeah yeah
S0259	i don't think she's get her own bloody child if you ask me
S0255	no
S0259	cos a lot of em up there be in only in their early twenties
S0255	yeah
S0259	just qualify and straight in
S0255	yeah straight in and actually
S0259	they sorta look like they'd be better off with six or seven year olds
S0255	yeah
S0259	where they know they're gonna be naughty
S0255	yeah
S0259	do you know what i mean
S0255	yeah yeah
S0259	instead of like eleven to seventeen year olds where they're adults and they know they're gonna go
S0255	yeah yeah
S0259	yap yap yap yap
S0255	yeah cos it it's like be nearly qualify and your strength be geography so you want to teach that or your strength be french so you want to teach that
S0259	mm
S0255	when actually you've gotta have some life experience to actually be able to manage the teenagers haven't you
S0259	yeah they've still get you know it's you know i can teach but
S0255	mm
S0259	can you work with kid though
S0255	yeah that's the thing that's it
S0259	cos they don't actually do that in their train do they
S0255	no
S0259	go to school they're just chuck in
S0255	yeah yeah
S0259	off you go
S0255	yeah
S0259	and they're like woah

S0259	different from be children ain't they
S0255	erm it be one follow newly qualify teachers through their first year
S0259	oh right
S0255	and i only saw a couple cos it it actually wasn't that interest it be and it be but it it so i only watch a couple of them but one of the teachers she be new and she be almost have a breakdown and they be sort of say you know you've really gotta step up or you have to go
S0259	yeah
S0255	and one of the other ones find it really hard and he be up at sort of go midnight every night just mark and do a plan but he be determine and he get through it and he actually find ways of deal with it
S0259	oh
S0255	and do it and you know so it be just look at the two different ways and you think yeah i mean i wouldn't want to teach teenagers
S0259	mm
S0255	i i i don't i mean i i could probably teach i could teach primary school i think i could teach with that and deal with that but when you get to the teenagers you start think
