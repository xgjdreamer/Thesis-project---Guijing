S0012	yeah
S0013	and some of them be so good that include the two real ones
S0012	pardon
S0013	that include the two real ones
S0012	who who have the real ones
S0012	oh of course she would wouldn't she
S0013	yeah pen up outside they've be ever so good
S0012	well why didn't we go in for it
S0013	why what
S0012	why didn't we do a sheep
S0013	it's well be weren't we we get too busy with other things
S0012	everything happen at once doesn't it that's a real problem
S0013	some of them be very inventive
S0012	well we could have do a sheep i could have stand out there dress up as
S0013	some be just wooden head you know
S0012	yeah
S0013	and some be kind of well well there's so many different things there's even one just with a black bin liner which doesn't look very good but it's a black sheep
S0012	but i could have actually stand out there look sheepish
S0013	no no that's not the idea mind you there's one down road they've put a a boy's face on it which be not very nice
S0012	yeah well he look sheepish
S0013	yeah he look he's be hang hang over the fence i didn't like that one a bite creepy
S0012	no it's fun it's not creepy
S0013	yeah no that one be quite creepy
S0012	be it
S0013	you'll know what i mean mm it's like you're be the boy be be hang cos it be like a a woolly jumper on as well
S0012	that would have be a good one just hang a jumper outside there and a and a and a big high jump thing
S0013	a big what
S0012	a high jump right
S0013	mm
S0012	and then a woolly jumper
S0013	mm
S0012	on a spring
S0013	no head
S0012	no it's just a woolly jumper
S0013	oh gosh
S0012	god come on keep up keep up
S0013	i don't know if they check out these sheep before they go up they all have number and they all have letter and you have to collect up all the letter and rearrange it to make a say
S0012	a wolf in sheep's clothe
S0013	could be well that's a good idea isn't cos
S0012	that's brilliant
S0013	like someone be say it it really get you to see because they're talk about all the different roads so many different roads and so widespread
S0012	i know be
S0013	i mean to be right up here and right down er er down way
S0012	yeah
S0013	that's a lot isn't it
S0012	yeah it be a lot and it's you know you have one thousand and well over one i don't know whether it's one thousand three hundred or one thousand five hundred dwell and if if you put two people to each dwell that's three thousand people in
S0013	yeah it be quite big
S0012	so i don't know whether i'm right or wrong but i think there's about one thousand one hundred er dwell in
S0013	mm
S0012	that will still make three people two thousand two hundred doesn't it
S0013	yeah
S0012	but they think there's three thousand people in
S0013	right
S0012	well that's because if you think of two and a half people or three and a half people to one household
S0013	yeah
S0012	cos school be about five hundred pupils in that
S0013	mm
S0012	isn't there

S0013	yeah anyway she's seem very happy and that's oh it be really nice to have a chat because she erm i say oh hello she just say she catch me cos i'm just eat this great big cake
S0013	i say i'm just take a break i'm suppose to be do the er promote
S0012	take a break eat a cake
S0013	promote the er enterprise place
S0012	oh yeah she work there doesn't she
S0013	yeah so she's in her she get a top thing
S0012	oh right she work there
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	oh wow
S0013	so i actually i hold her up for quite a long time and they don't have her colleague have to do it all by himself
S0012	well that wasn't
S0013	by herself and so yeah she say oh you catch me sit down so i sit down cos she happen to be at the table which be kind of nice
S0012	well she would be eat a cake
S0013	no i just happen to be next to her stall i don't know
S0012	oh i see right yeah
S0013	it wasn't wasn't the cakey bite if you see what i mean not where they be sell them
S0012	oh right she'd already buy it
S0013	yeah
S0012	and take it to her table
S0013	yeah
S0012	ah
S0013	so i have a nice long chat with her
S0012	well she's a lovely lady
S0013	she be nice isn't she
S0012	yeah she be she's have a hard life
S0013	yeah oh she and she tell me about their dad as well she say he's come over to see them at christmas but er she cos because we're not connect now i think she feel like she can talk a bite more about that type of thing
S0012	probably yeah yeah
S0013	anyway because er you know 's a bite more reserve but still think he's the most wonderful person in the world and
S0012	well she would do because she's young now
S0013	well she would do yeah
S0012	yeah
S0013	but they they always they always get so excite when they find out he's come over to see them and then then it all go wrong and they're so disillusion and it all go wrong again and they sort of
S0012	well that's because they expect too much probably
S0013	probably be
S0012	i mean if you think of what these families that be separate have to do the bloke actually take people take their his children to cos never that's never the bloke that's that's erm get
S0013	it's sad isn't it not usually no
S0012	with the children no
S0013	yeah
S0012	so the bloke have to come along and he have to treat them doesn't he
S0013	yes
S0012	cos he only see them probably once a week or
S0013	mm
S0012	if he's lucky so he treat them and then he become the most wonderful person in the world
S0013	mm
S0012	because the others they're just the mundane life you go to school you get up in the morning you have to you have to get dress and you do all this that and the other and and you have the the ordinary bite of life whereas the dad come along once or twice once a week or whenever and treat them to a circus or a a zoo or a show and he get the best he get he get the point doesn't he
S0013	he do in general yeah
S0012	he get the point and you know they look forward to it
S0013	and mum have to say clean up your room
S0012	and mum have to say come one clean up your room get on with your life
S0013	help help us with the wash up and all the rest of it
S0012	yeah and they go oh dad isn't like that dad take us here dad take us there but the boot on the other foot would be mum take them everywhere and dad do the mundane job like er take them to school and get them dress and do all that business
S0013	yeah
S0012	you know it's just it's just
S0013	but in and 's case because he's in isn't he
S0012	yeah
S0013	and they get so excite and then it's he's he doesn't do the nice things like they're expect i suppose
S0012	well
S0013	he's not the wonderful person that
S0012	kid have get too much expectations anyway haven't they
S0013	yeah
S0012	i mean you have only get to think about christmas and they have all these wonderful wonderful
S0013	well it be like that with ordinary families isn't it
S0012	well it be
S0013	at christmas you think oh it will be great to see so and so again and that and then they either turn up bore or
S0012	yeah well that's like when we when you have party and stuff like that
S0013	yeah
S0012	i mean i go to the class of fifty nine nineteen fifty nine right and i go to this this reunion i know well i know about three people and all the rest of them be old and i look at them and think
S0013	mm
S0012	do i ever know you do i ever i i can't remember you i i i remember about three people because i've keep in contact with them since we leave school
S0013	mm
S0012	you know
S0013	otherwise it's a huge gap isn't it
S0012	that's a massive gap you you think of nineteen fifty nine to the year two thousand that's that's forty one years
S0013	and you're talk about from about fifteen
S0012	yeah
S0013	from fifteen onwards well you change dramatically fifteen to thirty don't
S0012	god you have yeah
S0013	i mean fifteen to twenty even
S0012	but there there there be one regret i have about that about not meet my headmaster mr who be an absolute fantastic bloke and er i want to thank him for what he do for me
S0013	mm
S0012	but of course i never get round to it you don't think of that do you until until it's too late
S0013	no you don't
S0012	it's like that's like tell your father you love him
S0013	yeah
S0012	which no bloke ever do
S0013	or or anyone anything anyone
S0012	or yeah you know
S0013	you don't you don't do it otherwise they think what's wrong
