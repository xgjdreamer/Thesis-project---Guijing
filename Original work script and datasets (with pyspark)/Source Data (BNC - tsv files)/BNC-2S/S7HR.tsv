S0618	that's funny
S0619	he's because he's just like he's just the sort of kid who would get hit by a car like he's just one of them
S0618	jeepers that's nut so in that chain of events you have a role to play there
S0619	i know i feel really really responsible i need to email
S0618	no
S0619	him this weekend and be like
S0618	sorry
S0619	sorry
S0618	no but don't though because
S0619	no i know i'm only kid like i know it's not my fault
S0618	i know he's a like creator of his own reality man and i wonder have he create that maybe that be sort of like the spiritual theoretical straw that break the camel's back
S0619	mm hm sorry sorry sorry sorry
S0618	as he just think right i'm not have this i'm not handle it any more
S0619	i know
S0618	i'm be pull to do nothing i want to just lay here for a whole and then low and behold he's create that reality for himself
S0619	uhu you know what though
S0618	that's nut
S0619	the the worst part of this be if the if a student miss more than a few class because they're ill
S0618	yeah
S0619	they have to have lessons
S0618	three isn't it
S0619	i can't remember
S0618	yeah and you have to do extra private lessons
S0619	yeah but i've get to go to his house cos he can't get out of bed
S0618	ah shit
S0619	so i've get to go to this kid's house
S0618	where be he be he far

S0618	i'm sure he will
S0619	and you know like
S0618	cheer
S0619	he be one of the weakest kid in that whole level
S0618	yeah
S0619	so
S0618	why be that
S0619	he's really lazy
S0618	oh well
S0619	and he's not very bright we
S0618	i think the kid who aren't very bright you know if you can get the opportunity for some one to one time that might potentially inspire them or where they could grow and develop from that opportunity then great but if he's really lazy then
S0619	mm hm yeah
S0618	you're not huh
S0619	yeah we're do this lesson once on different type of intelligence these eight or nine different intelligence blah blah blah some of them be like well i think i i've get this sort of scientific intelligence because da da da or i've get personal intelligence because i'm empathetic
S0618	mm hm
S0619	and he be like out of these ones i think sort of existential intelligence and the whole class and me just piss ourselves
S0618	poor guy no wonder he's create a car accident to get away from you
S0619	just bully him relentlessly
S0619	oh god no
S0618	isn't this just excellent coffee by the way
S0619	i've not try it yet but it look
S0618	you should have sit here so you can watch your man make it he just look like he love his job mm
S0619	mm hm good
S0618	bear to do this job
S0619	yeah there's a guy in krakow as well who do make really good coffee
S0618	mm yeah
S0619	and whenever erm he's not there i'm always like mm it's not gonna be as good
S0618	where's that
S0619	on the square it's call or
S0618	oh i think you tell me about that before
S0619	and i'm sad for you i'm sad because we couldn't sit and talk but obviously i understand and i hope tomorrow you will feel better to come to meet i miss you okay fine
S0618	i really think she'd say phew i didn't wanna go either
S0618	she might be jump for joy the other thing that amuse me very much about this tram coffee shop be the sex shop advert directly outside the window and a picture of there's a banana and a measure tape
S0619	where i know nice
S0618	i know yes
S0619	nice
S0618	we've twenty centimetres worth of banana cos we're metric here apparently i'm not sure what the the mean though
S0619	no i don't know what that mean
S0618	i'm go to google that
S0619	sure it's like erm an infinitive
S0618	mm
S0619	to something but i don't know what the word be
S0618	yes never your infinitive split
S0619	hm
S0618	hm
S0619	so
S0618	so there we be
S0619	that be my story anyway about my boy with break leg
S0619	for which i'm entirely responsible for
S0618	not at all
S0619	i could have push him under that car myself
S0618	oh well it's all good
S0619	yeah
S0618	mm
S0619	i really i you know i get quite attach to these to these kid not all of them but
S0618	mm
S0619	i really do and i've be stress all week about these shy kid and i don't know i think about a lot i think why be i think about these teenagers all the time
S0618	mm
S0619	and i think it's well it's just your job
S0618	mm
S0619	i suppose
S0618	yeah it's my perspective on that be that we all this free will thing and further from that we're all creators of the reality that we perceive so even these shy kid be have that experience in this moment for a reason
S0619	yeah
S0618	part of their sort of higher and greater development and it's not your responsibility and it's not necessarily your place to interfere with their free will creation
S0619	mm hm
S0618	that be obviously serve them at this moment
S0619	i know
S0618	hm yeah
S0619	i just want them to i want them to pass the exam and in order to pass this exam they have to put on this persona
S0618	mm hm
S0619	because they're grade on have not have this personality but how they interact with another person in this language
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	and if they don't have these social skills because they're too shy then they won't get the mark
S0618	they won't do it
S0619	and one of these boys he's try to get into this international baccalaureate class
S0618	oh yeah cool
S0619	he's in class at school and whereas 's in upper intermediate which be about right for fifteen
S0618	yeah
S0619	he do fce last year and get an a i think
S0618	wow
S0619	and he's in cae and he's fifteen so that's super high and mm there be no cae for school
S0618	yeah so
S0619	and no cpe for school so the higher you get the harder it be
S0618	so yeah i know he's get to have an adult conversation in his exam now about adult topics
S0619	yeah yeah and
S0618	that's difficult
S0619	he's mature and he's very good at english like his word that he use be really good and he's really consider and everything be perfect and there's no mistake but it's force him to have an opinion
S0618	mm hm
S0619	and even force him to have a conversation like oh you finish early just chat to your partner
S0618	yeah
S0619	like they just can't chat and i think when i be fifteen could i chat
S0618	mm
S0619	well yes but if it's with someone that i don't really know very well i don't know in another language
S0618	yeah wonder can you give him like i don't know
S0619	just issue cue card
S0618	a pebble or something and say right you know every time you hold this pebble in your leave hand you take on a different persona
S0619	mm hm
S0618	and you then have the persona of somebody who do know how to have a conversation so just a little something you can keep in his pocket and slip into his hand
S0619	yeah
S0618	when he need to you know sort of switch and access so it's a bite like that oh i don't know what to say and well but if you do know what to say what would it be
S0619	what would it be
S0618	so when you put the pebble in your hand you become a person who would know what to say
S0619	mm hm mm hm
S0618	just might be a little psychological trick that you can play with if he can be somebody else for long enough to pass
S0619	yeah yeah yeah yeah with this upper intermediate group on thursday like well text me afterwards and say like that's the most they've all speak er and all of them speak the whole ninety minutes
S0618	brilliant
S0619	because i be like

S0619	no which
S0618	i do like a poncho if ever i live in south america it'll be so i can wear a poncho every day
S0619	be that the only reason
S0618	huh
S0619	be that the only reason
S0618	well no i'm sure it's a wonderful country with
S0619	huge expansive rich culture to explore i do particularly like music i've get a friend who's explore erm cuba at the moment and she go to the buena vista social club yesterday
S0618	nice
S0619	which be like the music place of cuba and yeah years ago i saw the film buena vista social club and i presume half of the old musicians who be in it be dead now but it's a wonderful story about all of these sort of real erm guy from cuba and other part of south america who play their instrument exceptionally well and erm they be take to the state i think it might even have be vegas or new york or la somewhere glitzy jazzy erm to perform and they'd never really be out of their home towns and sort of explore wider part of the world it be just a sort of a documentary sort of follow them and their adventure it be really good great music yeah this erm austrian farm that i could go work at be full of south american people i think it's mostly south american own
S0619	mm hm nice oh spanish
S0618	yeah so i could learn spanish there and then maybe end up in spain rather than portugal at the end of the year and part of what attract to me to that place be they've get a picture they've get a power place in their garden which presumably be some sort of lay line type place but they've sort of draw out this grid in the land and sort of plant it into the landscape
S0619	mm hm
S0618	er just look really cool yeah i think a lot of place i mean yes i do believe in earth energies and you can feel these power place but i think also humans can build up the energy of a place through intent so if they've be focus on that energy of that particular place for years then
S0619	mm hm
S0618	it's gonna feel pretty powerful because of the energy they're put into it
S0619	mm hm for all the people
S0618	yeah so that could be pretty excite too some great review for there and i haven't actually hear back yet from this place in poland where i'm mean to have this skype interview this weekend so because i'm keen to get something organise before i leave poland i might just apply to some other place when i get home today
S0619	good for you motivation station
S0618	yeah well and as displacement activity to avoid pack
S0619	yay
S0618	for a little bite longer i'm do pretty well cos there's not that much quite frankly but it's decide what to keep in the van and what to take back to england and store particularly in light of it be my uncle's loft rather than the spare room
S0619	right okay
S0618	so yeah
S0619	mm it'll come together
S0618	it will it be it's good
S0619	yeah oh dear i just don't know what to do with myself
S0618	i just don't know what to do with myself be that dusty springfield
S0619	i don't know
S0618	doo doo
S0619	i just need to sort of just chill out a little bite
S0618	when's back
S0619	tomorrow lunch time
S0618	cool so you've get another night
S0619	mm yeah so i'm just gonna really take it easy
S0618	good for you
S0619	mm go to the gym in the morning and see how i feel just want it to be
S0618	have you get sun on your balcony at this time
S0619	only in the mornings
S0618	mm
S0619	until about two
S0618	be it in the kitchen yet hm
S0619	no
S0619	no oh dear nice dog
S0618	mm german shepherd
S0619	mm they're cute
S0618	i don't know why people need to hold their dog so close to the lead that's probably the least pully best behave dog that's walk past
S0619	mm hm
S0618	mm i really do feel for dog here it's such a different culture erm one of my neighbour have get a new puppy and i only know that cos it's outside yipping its heart out obviously miss its mother and miss contact with its siblings
S0619	oh
S0618	erm and they just leave it there and they're outside in the snow they're outside in the wind they're outside in the rain and a lot of them have kennel and shelter but i'd have call the rspca by now i call the uspca on one of my neighbour when i live in and have two he have two dog take away because of me fuck good job too the bastard
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	erm but that job that job that dog use to live out in the garden and didn't have much by way of shelter now to be fair to people here the difference be that guy just let the dog live in its own shit and never clean it up
S0619	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0618	and the condition be squalid and disgust and it be often chain up and not have an opportunity to even run around the garden where as here at least the dog that be outdoors in minus temperatures at least they get to run around a bite so i suppose that's something in a way but even so
S0619	mm hm i don't understand one of my students be tell me that she's get this german shepherd at home who live outside er and she be like it's such a nice sweet so gentle
S0618	well let it in your bed then
S0619	i say well yeah let it in your house hang out with it more
S0618	yeah
S0619	and she be like i be like well what do you use it for and she be like oh well to guard the property and i be like
S0618	you live in what be you guard
S0619	like no no one there's no crime
S0618	yeah
S0619	and two like no offence to you love but you work in the court you know you're not a judge she's not a lawyer she's in sort of administration what be you go to have in this house that's
S0618	that's nickable
S0619	that's nickable apart from like tvs and laptops
S0618	and why this fear of crime
S0619	every house in have
S0618	yeah so rather than get a dog that you ignore you're better off not buy newspapers or watch television problem solve
S0619	yeah yeah yeah you know and it's just like well
S0618	so crime isn't a problem it's the fear of crime i wonder if that's why all my neighbour have dog that live outside a lot of them have this pies sign on the cage when they look out there be pies yeah but erm
S0619	yeah but i well if you're worry about that get like a better alarm system
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	you know a light that come on
S0618	yeah so there's one german shepherd near me but apart from that oh there's one boxer apart from that they're all yippy dog yip yip yip i mean the worst that's gonna do be bite your ankle as you're kick it so
S0619	mm hm mm i suppose it wake you up and you
S0618	well i guess so
S0619	then you look out of the window
S0618	yeah and there's one house that at least have two little yippy dog which i feel be not so bad and actually near the bus stop there be two dog
S0619	yeah just play together
S0618	so they can play together and they do yeah and the two that be near me that play together in their front garden there's like a mesh bench and then there's another dog on its own in the other garden and i feel really sorry for it that it can't play with them as part of pack
S0619	ah like the boy in strip pyjamas
S0618	ah i know it's little doggy no mat but have get chicken friends
S0619	nice
S0618	so all my neighbour have chickens and duck as well
S0619	nice
S0618	so
S0619	oh i really miss dog
S0618	and there's another place i think that be in austria too which be just like erm these people take in all the unwanted dog and cat and duck and hens and everything
S0619	oh i wanna work there
S0618	so a big part of your job be clear up shit from animals which i'm quite up for erm and the review be hilarious because the review range from oh it's brilliant there's one cat that come and sit on your shoulder and you work away with it like it's a parrot and you stay there all day erm through to other review that have say oh there be cat everywhere it be disgust they be even on the kitchen table and blah blah blah so it's like
S0619	uhu
S0618	people's reactions to this situation be really quite different so i think i might like to go there be well
