S0192	what do you get sort today then
S0198	i start to build a i've separate my seminars next week into three separate document and i'm just paste over the quote that i think might be useful for that particular day
S0192	mm
S0198	some of them might not be relevant but i feel like at some point they'll be general discussion point
S0192	might be able to
S0198	that i can sort of bring up at any time
S0192	might be able to bring it up
S0198	erm just start to do that really organise my quote i've read through a few things quite a lot of information we've study so far isn't there
S0192	mm
S0198	we've study quite a bite
S0192	definitely
S0198	mm
S0192	erm well we've be do it for a few months now haven't we
S0198	but then i've get i mean the second language acquisition and research i've get quite a lot of specific things that i have to prepare before wednesday lot to do first it's all about introduction and define language and then complete this questionnaire and also he's attach this to it which be something completely different i guess these be quote to go along with what we're do here what be language how do we use it and things like that but
S0192	mm yeah all i've do so far be sort everything out do my library reference and print the things off i need i still need to erm do the things that they've set me to do
S0198	yeah yeah that's what i do
S0192	and do the read that they've set me to do
S0198	and just i haven't even finish organise those ideas yet i mean i've still gotta do i mean we've get today and tomorrow and also we've get monday and tuesday and you know it's not
S0192	no yeah
S0198	and what slightly concern be gonna start upload er er specifics for language variation until the day before or something cos he hasn't do anything for preparation for that week
S0192	no i email the language description analysis lady cos although she's give me a load of pre read she hasn't actually set us anything to do
S0198	no no
S0192	whereas pidgins and creoles and syntactic theory have both set me
S0198	yeah
S0198	don't really know whether to email him or whether that be kinda hassle him because
S0192	it might be hassle him a little bite
S0198	he do say yesterday he be upload bits by bite
S0192	i mean you're all in the same boat
S0198	yes exactly
S0192	so if he hasn't upload it for you he hasn't upload it for anyone so
S0198	and i'm sure like with the general general erm general read i've do it's erm even if he hasn't set anything as long as i go in there with a collection of quote about just copy over summarise what the basically the open sentence they include in introductions to socio linguistic book just have a bunch of them on there about language variation and what essentially it be
S0192	i mean
S0198	so as long as i can participate in that respect of it
S0192	he seem pretty chill to me
S0198	it's call an introduction anyway the first seminar so yeah he do seem pretty chill i wonder what they're gonna do about the erm the clash that i have on my timetable
S0192	yeah i mean if they're expect us
S0198	cos in my head i have three to six again
S0192	if these things be mandatory i bet you'll get away with it i bet you won't have to do it
S0198	i it's it's possible they might tell me that i can i just do the first two hours and i always lose the third hour or they might say we give this slot one to three but we don't actually they don't actually go on for three hours
S0192	what do you mean if it's two hours
S0198	well that i do one to
S0192	one to three be only two hours
S0198	oh then i do the first hour then
S0192	yeah so you just come in and do an hour
S0198	oh yeah sorry erm one to three be only two hours
S0198	they didn't yeah they obviously hadn't think that through or if we're lucky they'll look at the timetable for whatever reason it can be do earlier that day
S0192	that would be nice
S0198	but that would depend on
S0192	chance be they'll move your thing later
S0198	er what my language
S0192	second language acquisition
S0198	yeah i mean i suppose they can do can't they
S0198	but just for me that seem a bite mm harsh think about
S0192	it's not just for you it's for everyone oh
S0198	no it's not cos er most of the people
S0192	you're right unless they're require to go to these as well
S0198	but most people unless they're require to do something similar which they might be er might do
S0192	they might be mightn't they cos it's just general language and linguistics erm
S0198	ah i be quite look forward to finish at five that day but
S0192	well my
S0198	six seem so late
S0192	my timetable's mental
S0198	yeah
S0192	i feel like i've get quite a lot to do
S0198	with these add sessions
S0192	i've get four
S0198	every other week it's like you know that's like another module and you
S0192	well basically i'm in uni four days a week and out of those four days two of them i'm in uni well one i'm in uni for eleven till six another one i'm in uni from nine till three
S0198	mm
S0192	that's quite long days
S0198	mm
S0192	and i've get two full long days like that you haven't get shit that even compare to that
S0198	no
S0192	it's rubbish i'm not actually best please about that
S0198	but you can use that time in between to just study at uni
S0192	but it's a lot more work that mean i have to have the book that i need for class plus the book that i need to study with plus i need to bring my laptop on top of my food i don't see how i'm go to be able to carry all of this
S0198	well just take your laptop
S0192	when you actually think about these things practically it's not actually that easy
S0198	well i'm sure i know i understand that but er it's not easy but you're you're very organise you're very able i think that you can maximise this time quite successfully
S0192	i know it's just extra stress that i don't really need
S0198	yeah i know
S0192	i'm not
S0198	you'd prefer to come home obviously
S0192	i don't study do you want a cigarette by the way i've roll one
S0198	yeah okay i'll have a little of that one
S0192	erm
S0198	even if you just study the lesson that you er
S0192	i mean i've gotta deal with it haven't i i haven't get any choice
S0198	the lecture that you have that morning
S0192	i know i know
S0198	do the lecture and then do the seminar work that's set for the follow class or whatever
S0192	i may have to
S0198	do the seminar and just focus on one thing during that time
S0192	depend if she's put it up though isn't it because erm on wednesday i've just finish a pidgins and creoles seminar
S0198	you'll have oh okay yeah yeah
S0192	so she may not've yet upload next week's lecture and seminar
S0198	lecture whatever but i'm sure you'll have work to do
S0192	and i don't have access to a printer or anything and like
S0198	you can print at uni
S0192	then have to put money on that
S0198	mm i think if you just go to the library find yourself a little corner it's just
S0192	i'm gonna have to
S0198	just focus on one thing that day
S0192	i'm gonna have to take in my laptop and but it's just seem like a lot to carry and then i have to prepare i have to make sure i've get food ready and all that kinda it's just a lot more work for me
S0198	i mean yeah you do have to take food in those days don't you
S0192	yeah it's just a lot more work for me that's all but it can't really be avoid can it
S0198	mm
S0192	it just mean that next semester i may very well just do the core modules
S0198	yeah
S0192	depend on how i find this it's a shame cos i'd like to do phrenology and i'd like to do quite like to do world englishes as well erm depend how well i cope with this semester
S0198	cos world englishes be just fifteen
S0192	yeah i don't really understand
S0198	it's a post grad but it's fifteen
S0192	yeah so they don't offer it to undergraduates i guess
S0198	yeah okay
S0192	but it's still a lesser weight
S0198	i wonder why it must build on i don't know why they won't offer it to an undergrad
S0192	research in language and use erm i don't really understand how it work it's fifteen credit the same as pidgins and creoles yeah
S0198	yeah
S0192	except in pidgins and creoles they do two hours a week
S0198	yeah
S0192	and syntactic theory in research in language and use we do one and a half research in language and use be just two paper and the other ones i've get presentations and four paper
S0198	i know
S0192	they don't seem weight correctly you can't really call them both fifteen credit
S0198	i guess the er yeah i guess the research in language and use be just er the you know they put the minimum amount of credit they can to it or something
S0192	yeah i mean do say that it take more organisation to do the
S0198	yeah yeah she do yeah she didn't sound like yeah it be an easier option at all so just gotta see how it go i suppose just stay organise stay on top of it hopefully as you say after we've meet everyone yesterday you know people be gonna need guidance through this sort of thing aren't they i guess that's what these wednesday things be about i dunno
S0192	i don't know what that's about really why i didn't fully understand it we just listen to their
S0198	i don't know
S0192	hear about their research
S0198	i guess it's it's the they're try to give us ideas during that time
S0192	mm
S0198	dissertation ideas and how you go about do it i suppose so that we something
S0192	i be only in uni nine hours a week undergrad er
S0198	i know
S0192	twelve hours a week now
S0198	i know i actually think there would be less contact time erm than there be go to be certainly
S0192	ah it be a master isn't it
S0198	yeah
S0192	mm
S0198	guess you're pay for it
S0192	yeah you be
S0198	get as much out of it as possible
S0192	it's certainly not cheap be it
S0198	no
S0192	six thousand pound
S0198	could be more say his cost seven
S0192	oh do it
S0198	and i don't think he do i'm pretty sure he's at and not i'm not positive
S0192	i mean certain master cost different amount
S0198	yeah maybe because he do lab stuff and things like that
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah i know science master i i don't know how much do say how much his cost
S0192	eight yeah i think or nine or something
S0198	eight or nine at
S0192	i mean all the ones at the top ten unis cost eight or nine
S0198	be gonna be charge like eight or nine i can sort of appreciate you know i mean the cost be ridiculous regardless but i can sort of understand it slightly more for things that do require lab work and stuff but linguistics i mean i guess if you're will to cover cost of fieldwork but erm master like put it up to eight thousand
S0192	i think they do that because they know they be jump up the league table
S0198	yeah
S0192	this year
S0198	i mean it be a bloody good place can ah
S0192	they've go up quite a bite
S0198	i feel like people speak better at could you imagine go somewhere really high up
S0192	i think be probably high enough for us
S0198	it's probably a good choice for our niche
S0192	you could try and go to an even better uni for your phd
S0198	mm
S0192	because you're not really do that much contact and by that point you've get a erm i mean effectively you could go from a top seventy uni to a top thirty top twenty uni depend on where you leave it
S0198	how do you into do your phd your master
S0192	to a top ten well you effectively just carry on your research i reckon
S0198	yeah
S0192	if you've get a good idea for your master
S0198	start in our field
S0192	quite often people turn their master into phds
S0198	turn into phds continue that
S0192	yeah effectively
S0198	i do wonder at undergrad if i could turn my if you be allow to turn your dissertation into a master but i have a your master dissertation but no i don't think you can
S0192	
S0198	cos you've already get half the word count or all of the word count depend on
S0192	yeah
S0198	the size of your dissertation
S0192	it doesn't make any sense do it and you you've er your dissertation's gonna have to be base on what you're teach you know
S0198	i've get a feel that in history i think that the dissertations be ten twenty thousand a master not ten not fifteen or ten
S0192	erm they may well be
S0198	they may be weight to such a point that you be just because it's history you're
S0192	because you're not do field research
S0198	you're yeah i mean you're do what what else be they gonna be set you throughout that master other than to er to to prove
S0192	write a big piece of work
S0198	that you can yeah
S0198	whereas in linguistics you're
S0192	i mean the tefl one be fifteen thousand
S0198	yeah it be
S0192	the elt one be longer but i guess their field research be lower i mean they might not even have to do field research
S0198	i don't know it depend on er
S0192	they er they might just be write a long assed paper on second language acquisition
S0198	they might have to do case study
S0192	but it's harder for them
S0198	do say in erm
S0192	because they have to observe class if they're do it just base on tefl
S0198	yeah but he do say in that open thing that they have students there to be observe like
S0192	yep
S0198	you they have a language department that you can use
S0192	yep but how much be each person gonna be observe i don't reckon they probably have to do more than like five observation hours or something like that
S0198	yeah
S0192	do you know what i mean and then it's all set up for them they just go and sit in a class and it's all ready to go and then just observe it whereas we have to come up with an idea which can be a complete scope of absolutely anything they're not gonna be out there do research on the public about dialects and stuff in elt
S0198	mm
S0192	it's get nothing to do with teach english
S0192	erm so therefore their their process of research be already set up yes they probably have to decide what they're observe in the class but the class be already there so they don't actually have to set it up so i reckon our research proposal what we actually research be harder
S0198	mm
S0192	what we have to come up with
S0198	yeah
S0192	and therefore we write less word
S0198	i'm er concern as well i think slightly touch on it yesterday i'm sure he do about erm i don't know if it's when we be just talk to him but that you i feel like with language variation the big project that's due in after christmas you choose what it be that you're you're research you choose an area cos i say i say
S0192	yeah he say something about
S0198	language variation have get a huge scope and er blah blah blah and he say well that's why we cover these different point so that you can find the area that you wanna research
S0192	yeah do you have to do some kind of project
S0198	yeah well there's a five thousand word essay and
S0192	what's that on
S0198	and the er there there's only two assignments in language variation a literary literary literature review and er the essay so i assume you choose something do a literature review and then produce the essay for it so basically it's a mini dissertation
S0198	so in total that's like
S0192	nice though cos you'll be nice and prepare for dissertations won't you
S0198	well in the yeah i suppose by that point i've would've practise but
S0192	this be why for me
S0198	i'd imagine it's in a different area
S0192	i'd quite like to do first language acquisition but now i think about it more for the chance of what i'm gonna be do a dissertation on first language acquisition isn't actually that useful
S0198	that useful
S0192	erm whereas discourse analysis be
S0198	yeah
S0192	world englishes be
S0198	yeah
S0192	if i want to do er especially if i wanna focus on anything to do with our record
S0198	how many can we choose so we've get fifteen be it the same amount oh no dissertations how much be that thirty
S0192	erm thirty
S0198	oh do that come in the summer term
S0192	yeah
S0198	so it doesn't count towards our spring term credit
S0192	no no
S0198	so we still need seventy five
S0192	yeah well in the spring term we still do another core module
S0198	mm
S0192	which be like the one that we're do now research in language and use
S0198	yeah
S0192	but erm where be it
S0198	probably in here somewhere
S0192	oh you have a oh no it be hole punch
S0198	yeah
S0192	let's have a look
S0198	so world englishes be just fifteen credit so
S0192	yeah so
S0198	so you could yeah balance it out with something here
S0192	with another one of this i'd be
S0198	like semantics or phrenology perhaps would you do that
S0192	erm i'd probably go for phrenology rather than semantics
S0198	to complement yeah to complement cos then you'd have the you would've cover the syntax
S0192	if yeah if i could do yeah i mean i've get the core i'd like to be kind of what she be a little bite
S0198	mm
S0192	like i speak grammar
S0198	i see yeah
S0192	well
S0198	see i think i'm i'm probably more
S0192	know quite a bite about grammar
S0198	like perhaps
S0192	history psychology base
S0198	depend he seem more like he he could've you know could've just do a degree in history
S0192	i mean it's a field that you can do that in
S0198	yeah
S0192	so it's alright but
S0198	which be why i don't know whether er
S0192	first language acquisition interest me i find it quite fascinate what children do and how they learn languages and that may go very well with your second language acquisition
S0198	yeah
S0192	discourse and communication analysis i'm a little bite concern she's nice but
S0198	she won't take any shit i don't think
S0192	i reckon she's yeah i reckon she's she's very strict
S0198	and i think she'll be quite direct with you
S0192	yeah
S0198	that's the thing i get about er also he er i'm pretty sure he he'll just he won't he he won't like faff about
S0192	no
S0198	he'll directly ask you just out of hand
S0192	but he might yeah i mean he might have well if they do run like er certificate
S0198	yeah
S0192	and they know about celtas and deltas they've probably get more of that methodology with their
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	their way of teach
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	whereas 's just hasn't really teach so he's just gonna be like
S0198	yeah
S0192	you know what i mean
S0198	yeah definitely
S0192	so it's not a bad thing they might actually be better teachers for it but
S0198	yeah definitely
S0192	erm it will probably be harder but discourse and communication analysis if that be actually about you know like things that you've record and then analyse it that's gonna be useful
S0198	yeah yeah it would be pretty useful
S0192	and would go well with phrenology and probably world englishes so at the minute i'm lean on that
S0198	mm
S0192	but then that mean i have to do four modules again which mean i've come out and do quite a few modules if i come out with the degree that i've do
S0198	yeah well unless i unless we unless you just choose those two core modules then that's just er a lot of people be gonna be in that position i think
S0192	mm but i mean some i mean er by the sound of things people be just choose the the main modules weren't they
S0198	yeah
S0192	i mean what do she say she be do i mean if she be do forensic linguistics and the discourse so be do these two be she
S0198	yeah
S0192	so she's do four
S0198	yeah she be she's
S0192	so it must be fairly common but i mean if i do another four i'll've come out with eight modules that's quite a few
S0198	i don't know what 's do
S0192	plus the ma dissertation be another thirty well they run pidgins and creoles again
S0198	yeah they do
S0192	i mean you could do quite well in that if i've already fuck do it
S0198	yeah
S0192	like you could do really well in it how would they argue that we've plagiarise or not you be here while i study it and therefore learn about it yourself and now you've take a course in it i mean there's nothing wrong with if you already know spanish you can take a certificate in spanish that give you a qualification in spanish
S0198	no yeah that's true
S0192	so if you already know pidgins and creoles you can take a qualification in it
S0198	but i i don't know i haven't actually be
S0192	no but by the end of this semester
S0198	study with you
S0192	i will be tell you about it
S0198	yeah you could certainly help explain things for me
S0192	so i mean you could do pidgins and creoles and come out they might be like oh cheeky but
S0192	but you could come out with quite a good grade
S0198	i think it depend how language variation go for me and second language acquisition depend on what i'll choose next semester
S0192	mm
S0198	i don't when i'll we have to make these decisions if for example language variation's particularly successful then i might choose language even though it never initially appeal to me i can it might be something semantics perhaps
S0192	mm so what do we have to do research proposal
S0198	i wouldn't mind semantics discourse
S0192	semantics be quite tricky i think they say
S0198	ah
S0192	and it's very perceptive
S0198	yeah well that's why
S0192	research proposal this module will provide specific guidance for your dissertation to help you in the choice of a research topic type of research project and appropriate methodology will work in conjunction with the presentations give by the english language and linguistics staff during the year
S0198	yeah that's exactly it yeah
S0192	ah
S0192	it will also be so this have get some direct link into those things
S0198	and will work in conjunction
S0192	we've get those the whole year then pretty much
S0198	yeah
S0192	it's just part of the course they work you
S0198	and then the language class on top of that i have
S0192	yeah you do
S0198	we're gonna be busy
S0192	yeah basically we just have to just do this all the time
S0198	yeah
S0192	i mean friends have to understand that
S0198	yeah hopefully
S0192	if can your your friends can like imagine do all that work she do for her ma in one year
S0198	yeah
S0192	like and we still have to have a job and see people and go shop and clean and all the normal stuff
S0198	yeah
S0192	that everybody have to do that stuff take up time
S0198	take up a lot of time
S0192	do that one or at least she do
S0198	yeah
S0192	be this up to date now have it get
S0198	no it hasn't get in it
S0192	hasn't get in it at all
S0192	yeah it have
S0198	no but it hasn't in the explanation part
S0198	i don't think
S0192	ah they just copy and paste those
S0198	oh no they might be alright but there's an introduction from each of the lecturers and he's not there
S0192	so just do this oh no he do world englishes as well
S0198	yeah
S0192	interest
S0198	if you read his little blurb about him his that's his area
S0192	do he seem friendly though
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	yeah
S0198	i don't know who
S0192	what a great job they have
S0198	yeah
S0192	i can't wait until we can teach modules and like you know you focus on something she's like right i do the syntactics and pidgins and creole modules that's all she do on here she must do some other undergraduate modules
S0198	yeah yeah they do
S0192	but you just teach modules
S0198	she do she do
S0192	and you make a module handbook
S0198	english language
S0192	i'm i like to be organise this kind of thing would be perfect if i could lay out at the begin and go right student
S0198	yeah
S0192	there's your module handbook
S0198	this be what we're do this year
S0192	i've already plan it check on study direct because every week i'm gonna upload the next week's
S0192	cos that's basically what i be do with my blog like if i could've give them instructions every week and set them homework
S0198	mm
S0192	like if they have to do that i'd just upload it to that blog that i be do
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	and then
S0198	no i mean it's like if you're organise and you know what you're do then their job shouldn't actually be too bad
S0192	mm
S0198	because they i mean maybe all the undergraduates be a bite of a pain in the arse actually
S0192	mm they might be
S0198	but master you're just you're you're very much responsible for even undergrad you you're responsible to go and actually do the work if you don't do it you fail so
S0192	mm it's definitely gonna be strange be with a bunch of undergraduates by the sound of things unless one of these other people that we haven't meet yet have choose it or i guess somebody on a part time module have do it
S0198	mm
S0192	i could be the only master student in there
S0198	yeah
S0192	which might be a bite strange

S0198	mm don't know not till i start do them i suppose
S0192	we don't know do we bloody hell so much to do
S0192	we have to effectively just start and
S0198	erm what be we have
S0192	take time just print it all and get to and
S0192	do all this kind of shit
S0198	yeah exactly go to and from uni be time consume in itself
S0192	i think we just need to stop watch stuff in the even at least until we're confident that we're on top of things
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	erm i don't know get less sleep or something seven hours be a bite much isn't it i'm sure we can live off six
S0198	yeah i think that
S0198	that lie in bed i be think this be this be valuable time right here not fall asleep just yet
S0192	can certainly wake up early i'm in at nine but i mean if we wake up at seven that still doesn't give me that long
S0198	you have to leave at like eight to go and get the train don't you
S0192	yeah i do yeah so that only just just give me enough time
S0198	or quarter to eight
S0192	oh man it suck i basically have to get home and just crack on like immediately
S0198	mm
S0192	be so much nicer if i just wake up and could get on with stuff
S0198	there's days that i wake up at seven obviously gonna study admittedly i'm at home but i do i will be wake up at seven and i'll be in a classroom until eight pm
S0192	yeah and me
S0198	so i'll spend the entire day study or learn or something with no chance to like
S0192	and then what you're gonna come home and eat and then study again
S0198	i'll just get more and more tire and then study days i think tuesdays be gonna be quite tire
S0192	be tuesday the one with your language
S0198	language class
S0192	i mean it's a job isn't it effectively
S0198	mm
S0192	we're do a job overall it say
S0192	you're mean to spend about forty hours on it be that it that doesn't sound right
S0198	it be why once you've
S0192	it doesn't add up quite
S0198	once you've be work full time for a few years or whatever study seem easier
S0192	mm
S0198	than when you do it before because you do you like have
S0192	a hell of a lot to study though
S0198	you just apply er approach it as though it's an eight hour work day
S0192	when you actually think about the whole thing
S0198	massive break in between it yeah
S0192	and you're like we've get all this work to just to do the first semester
S0198	i know
S0192	we have to do a whole another semester
S0198	the amount of work i feel like i've do just to prepare myself for week one
S0192	and then a dissertation i know it seem ridiculous
S0198	i know still gotta just keep that ball roll for every week
S0192	for a year basically
S0198	well yeah
S0192	be you ready to work for a year
S0192	see how we go
S0198	iron in here

S0192	careful make noise around there it's a little bite close isn't it
S0198	oh four egg
S0192	we have four egg
S0198	it's a fine line isn't it
S0192	it's really hard to
S0198	i do have respect for people though that have just out of a moral obligation will not eat meat because of the way we treat animals
S0192	yeah
S0198	i think that's good but it's very hard to come across someone that's so passionate like so discipline that they don't eat egg or
S0192	yeah
S0198	cheese or drink milk or like
S0192	yeah
S0198	basically vegan i think
S0192	which still
S0198	true vegans be very difficult to come across
S0192	imprison the animal or erm lactate it put it in the
S0198	yeah and even like free range egg
S0192	oh free mm well
S0198	i mean er well what do you think the criteria of free range really be in the legal world
S0192	no no
S0198	cos i bet it's not quite as free as you think it be
S0192	no all it be be just the chicken's get a bite of space to move around in
S0198	they're they're not battery farm where they're stack up on top of each other
S0192	yeah
S0198	but i don't suppose they're run around in the field either they might be in an enclose pen
S0192	no well they'll have a bite of space but
S0198	but
S0192	they'll be able to stand up and move around but they're still be
S0198	yeah but to what extent they can still shuffle around
S0192	yeah
S0198	erm
S0192	right
S0198	but i do respect people that do try and try and to not eat meat cos i think it's bad we treat animals what about to eat

S0192	it's quite convenient actually although i'm busy i'm busy at the begin of the week because we can prepare on sunday
S0198	yeah
S0192	for erm
S0198	so monday tuesday wednesday
S0192	that's when i need to take lunch in
S0198	yeah
S0192	monday i have to take a lunch tuesday i don't i come no i come home at lunch so i'm gonna be pretty hungry i'm gonna need something because i don't finish till midday
S0198	so it'd be good for something to be prepare
S0192	so yeah basically monday tuesday wednesday i've gotta take in lunch
S0198	mm
S0192	bite crappy so i need a proper system go on here for have we get the correct tupperware necessary to be able to take some hummus in er maybe a boil egg some cheese some cut up veg

S0198	mm
S0192	you don't like do you
S0198	nah
S0192	just do one we don't wanna make this too big if it's go in a wrap
S0198	yeah er yeah
S0192	do that sound alright
S0192	do we do we have the tupperware
S0198	we've get some tupperware i think there's enough for you to take stuff in mm
S0192	gonna have to take in
S0198	yeah i think so i suppose
S0192	what about if you wanna take stuff in
S0198	the problem become when we're already use it to store stuff in the fridge cos some of that tupperware i need to just throw out
S0192	but we can't
S0198	cos not everything's get a lid like that's a good size for things but if we're already use it
S0192	i need quite small little convenient ones something i can like you know
S0198	we might need to grab
S0192	that just a bite just a little bite of veg like that
S0198	yeah the lid doesn't fit on that
S0192	another one that be kinda like
S0192	where can we buy tupperware
S0198	er
S0192	i need batteries as well for this record thing do we need to write this stuff down
S0198	oh what like er double a battery
S0192	double a batteries yeah where have the notebook go honey

S0198	tupperware
S0192	tupperware
S0198	not a lot just enough basically for you
S0192	yeah basically just a mini set for me
S0198	just a couple of containers
S0192	erm be there anything else
S0198	so that can probably
S0192	before monday
S0198	no
S0192	nothing you can think of
S0198	that can probably be be buy we're obviously we're go to aldi so
S0192	be there a poundland near there
S0198	there be a poundland
S0192	do they do tupperware
S0198	yeah i think so if you're just get a couple of little ones it shouldn't be
S0192	there be also that other shop near there wasn't there do you remember that weird little hardware store that you go into
S0198	oh yeah
S0192	they do like batteries and
S0198	oh yeah that's yeah
S0192	they probably do tupperware no
S0198	we'll go there first before aldi cos it's small anyway
S0192	it's on the way
S0198	and then er
S0192	but yeah we need more batteries for the record equipment i've gotta hear back from them i have to send them my detail i'm gonna have to send the invoice off in the next few days i would think cos i go to my parent at the weekend i can't be do it then
S0198	no
S0192	oh i nearly cut myself
S0198	how many hours have we get so far
S0192	we're gonna finish this month with about twenty five
S0192	i think it's like four hundred and fifty pound or something so we make the four hundred pound that we need to make

S0192	but no more
S0198	so hopefully we can both go home and get well no you'll be go home i won't be you'll get a few hours with your maybe with your family
S0192	that's the plan
S0198	hopefully i'll get a few hours with friends

S0198	and then hopefully when or or whatever come in october
S0192	yeah i don't know if we're still gonna make our target er i mean we might do
S0198	you could get

S0192	erm i dunno what do you think piece of fruit or something
S0198	mm
S0192	i don't really need anything more than that
S0198	an apple or something
S0192	oh apples would be nice
S0198	good carry it in your bag with all your book
S0192	do i write apples on the list or just we just remember
S0198	remember fruit erm how do you want this cut do you wanna
S0192	i'll just do it yeah be this knife clean have you be use it for something
S0198	what about oh yeah i use it
S0192	cool
S0198	what about er thursday wednesday thursday er dinner
S0192	oh what we
S0198	i think see as we're have mince now maybe chicken but cos we're have ragoût on monday tuesday and wednesday aren't we er monday tuesday
S0192	yeah we need more celery i think
S0198	so
S0192	let's not forget that
S0198	just a few
S0192	erm okay we just cook chicken
S0198	yeah but then we be gonna do beef
S0192	so either lamb or chicken i guess
S0198	yeah
S0192	be it just do you just put mince together if it's mince then
S0198	yeah i do put it a little bite together but i just put lamb or beef together
S0192	but i i could do like a i could do a lamb keema
S0198	mm that would be nice yeah have we have a keema since we've be here
S0192	no we haven't oh keema in a wrap might be nice
S0198	let's have a keema
S0192	i feel like if you make a nice solid keema wrap even if you could find the biggest wrap you could
S0198	mm
S0192	and then chill it that'd be tasty to take for lunch
S0198	yeah
S0192	and just take it already make cos it's just like it go quite dry so it shouldn't get too saucy if you cook it down properly
S0198	well if we make one on wednesday and could save a little bite you could take it for your lunch friday
S0192	erm probably not
S0198	no
S0192	i've get a bite of a hectic day on friday bite worry that i'm go to my family at the weekend when i need to be study
S0198	study yeah
S0192	but then i guess i can study on the train can i i mean i can at least read a book
S0198	yeah will you be take your do you know how you're get from to yet
S0192	i think my dad's pick me up
S0198	oh he be what time do you get into that even
S0192	erm i'm not certain
S0198	oh he finish early that day that's the problem
S0192	i'm only be pick up at yeah that's the problem i'm only be pick up at four thirty
S0198	okay
S0192	erm so i'll probably be in by about five i'm mean to be take him out for a meal as well
S0198	yeah i know
S0192	and obviously i've pay for my train back
S0198	oh that's good
S0192	erm
S0198	helpful
S0192	very bite worry that we're gonna overspend quite a bite if we're both
S0198	oh be we have curry wrap for dinner
S0192	i guess so yeah
S0192	ah there we go we don't have any meat that can go in this do we really
S0198	mm no
S0192	erm yeah so i don't know oh it's go in my eye
S0198	probably a good idea to always keep a pack of sausages in the freezer or something that we can use for want a bite more for lunch one day or something
S0192	or grab something erm i mean i would agree but sausages be that the best
S0198	yeah i dunno sausages
S0192	they're not the most versatile be better to just have a bite of pork again
S0198	yeah
S0192	just a pack of pork
S0198	yeah have we see any pork
S0192	i think they have them there's also turkey mince
S0198	yeah
S0192	erm
S0198	that might be a bite
S0192	turkey mince be quite common in england my mum use it quite a lot
S0198	yeah
S0192	that they need whisk into a thing
S0198	i guess it's for people that don't eat erm red meat
S0192	yeah
S0198	or er dark meat
S0192	put a bite of salt and pepper in it a bite of paprika
S0198	mm have we have any salt we're gonna buy salt
S0192	no we don't need salt
S0198	salt be we
S0192	yeah maybe write that on the list yeah
S0198	mm i've get egg on my hand let me
S0198	put it on the list salt
S0192	oh apples
S0198	apples
S0192	just think of what we don't normally get what else do we say we don't normally get we want some turkey mince didn't we
S0198	maybe yeah
S0198	have you see it at aldi
S0192	well yeah i think so how many wrap be you have
S0198	i dunno there's four leave
S0192	after this
S0198	no there's just four leave there's only eight in these packets aren't there
S0192	i suppose we don't have to have the curry with wrap tonight could have it with rice or something
S0198	yeah so do you wanna cuppa erm
S0192	be there anything else i mean we've get load of potato
S0198	oh we could have it with wedge or something
S0192	yeah we could make some wedge that might be quite tasty mightn't it
S0198	oh this be
S0192	there's not a lot in there though
S0198	oh those damn damn onions
S0192	what have you just do

S0198	oh have you
S0192	why do
S0198	you say salt and pepper about the egg
S0192	no yeah i put it in why do you do that we're not make a fry rice
S0198	that's fine it'll be alright
S0192	it's very very peppery that's i mean that be a lot that you put in regardless of what i put in
S0198	it's because i be turn and it wasn't come out come out
S0192	i know i just you shouldn't've start whisk it i could've get some out
S0198	it'll be fine
S0192	i'm sure it'll be very very peppery
S0198	i'm not afraid of a bite of pepper
S0192	well it's not where be the the paprika i can't even find it
S0192	it's not there though be it i've look
S0198	
S0192	can't see it use chilli
S0198	yeah
S0192	could use that
S0192	it be face the other way
S0198	be you cook these wrap as well or be you just have a wrap
S0192	i be gonna cook it

S0198	yeah i just drink some
S0192	why be there always a piece of wrap miss
S0198	because i can't help it
S0192	you really can't that's so it's a very strange thing you take such a small bite it's not even worth it
S0198	mm i know well a big bite would hinder the
S0192	it's just a strange thing that you do
S0198	can i pinch some of that
S0192	course you can
S0198	it look like a fairly nice day again
S0192	it's a
S0198	have that one night of rain since we've be here
S0192	i don't say i want rain but the nice weather just make you wanna go out
S0198	yeah i know
S0198	the cold stormy stuff cup of tea
S0192	i mean winter be come
S0198	yeah
S0192	you can't deny that be nice if they have a nice
S0198	it's not gonna stay warm be it
S0192	be nice if they have a nice clear winter i reckon it's gonna be really foggy at point
S0198	yeah
S0192	saw the fog the other day see past the train station
S0198	seem really dark and not be able to see across the campus
S0192	i mean you say the weather's nice but i be at home for a week and a half and it be pretty gloomy
S0198	yeah that's i say like since we move into the flat it's be nicer
S0192	yeah
S0192	i mean we've still have a few gloomy days but there's definitely be definitely be without a doubt
S0198	sunnier than expect
S0192	yeah what the fuck happen there
S0192	i don't know
S0198	something explode
S0198	this isn't
S0192	saucepan expand or something
S0198	this one
S0192	spoon need some cheese grate on that as well we're gonna have to buy some more cheese i take it
S0198	yeah get some in for the week
S0192	it's reasonably price
S0198	need to kind of get er
S0192	i'm so glad there's a shop like aldi around
S0198	yeah we can survive at aldi might not be the best stuff
S0192	i mean it's come from the eu right everything's from the eu
S0192	i mean they do you can't just lie about that so if it's from england there's a standard
S0198	yeah
S0192	it's just a cheaper shop because people cannot afford any more to shop at sainsbury's
S0198	sainsbury's all the time yeah
S0192	and place like that there be people that just can't afford and therefore it can't work you have to have some cheaper shop
S0198	cheaper shop yeah
S0192	cos the british public be not pay enough there be still plenty of people that go to tesco's and plenty of people who go to sainsbury's and all these place
S0198	yeah
S0192	some people just have to
S0192	so they've fill a niche i think it be over all the price go up didn't it and i guess people be just like crap and then these company come in
S0198	yeah
S0192	it's good that they be you know
S0198	yeah
S0192	compare to korea it's definitely cheaper
S0198	yeah it be
S0192	it seem pretty stable as well you can get a big yellow melon for seventy p
S0198	yeah i'm not expect anything to i mean some might go up by a few pence from inflation or something but i'm not expect the price of actually any produce to really change
S0192	no it shouldn't
S0198	think that they just have set price
S0192	well we get a good amount of the week's shop for twenty five quid
S0198	yeah
S0192	probably do have to go shop twice a week though
S0198	yeah but that's for er storage reason i suppose
S0192	yeah
S0198	it's not like people buy like freezer freezer load of produce or meat or
S0192	no really can't
S0192	which be a bite annoy
S0192	so we're gonna keep on with the three meals thing i think we weren't gonna do that
S0198	i mean
S0192	kinda have to it just make sense just too busy
S0198	it make it help out during the week especially see as there might be time like on a tuesday i'm not gonna eat dinner with you
S0192	no you can't can you
S0198	no
S0192	so i've gotta eat dinner on my own
S0198	and
S0192	what be you do for food in the interim what time will you be back that day
S0198	don't know i haven't check the time of the train come back
S0192	what time do it finish
S0198	eight o'clock
S0192	eight o'clock
S0198	yeah it finish at eight
S0192	so you do three till eight
S0198	yeah
S0192	on a tuesday
S0198	it's a long time to be in a classroom
S0192	yeah it be quite a while i mean thankfully you're do like beginners french
S0198	yeah
S0192	that's gotta be about as easy as it get really
S0198	and i suppose whatever happen happen i mean i'm not expect it to be too
S0192	i mean i think it's good i think it maybe look a bite bad that you're do beginners french but i think it look good that you be do it so you could travel
S0198	yeah
S0192	there's a genuine purpose to it
S0198	yeah rather than just
S0192	and you've travel quite a bite
S0198	yeah rather than dunno i feel like it look better if you try and go for something a bite unusual or whatever
S0198	but i don't actually but then the motivation for me learn it be purely that motivation rather than the one to that i actually need it
S0198	if i'm gonna do a language lesson in twenty weeks it would be nice for it to
S0192	yeah
S0198	so
S0192	i'll probably catch up with you in about a month of rosetta stone or whatever
S0198	yeah i know cheer
S0192	what well er just say cos i don't think you'll have much time to study outside of the class and how much can you really learn in a class i can sit down and grab a couple of those book and like just write it out and i'm pretty sure that i reckon i could learn quite a bite of french if i have the time in about six months i reckon i could be basically conversational like spanish in er six months
S0198	if you have six months
S0192	i have
S0198	yeah
S0192	like we have in korea where i could study for a few hours a day
S0198	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	like two or three hours a day on french or something
S0198	i mean they've do study to prove that second language acquisition be
S0192	you didn't even put this on you say you put it on
S0198	mm
S0192	what be you do
S0198	you can erm
S0192	this isn't ready now this be ready that's not ready
S0198	oh well i'll just have mine as it be
S0192	what great so cos you couldn't be bother to turn it on
S0198	look i think you be turn it on darling
S0192	what you say i'm turn it on and i say what already or something and then
S0192	yeah but you you still turn it on
S0198	we'll check it later shall we see who say what i do turn on anyway i turn it on at the mains
S0192	but you didn't actually turn it
S0198	i didn't start heat it up yet
S0192	which you and you haven't do the cheese what have you do
S0198	i've be clean we be make space
S0192	i ask you to do the cheese do you not remember

S0192	like now now we're ready
S0198	oh well you can
S0192	this isn't ready so we're wait on this
S0198	well why don't you you grate it onto it there immediately do you have to pre grate it then okay fine
S0192	so it'll melt oh for
S0192	i don't like have this that's happen to me every single time throw it out the window
S0198	no
S0192	it bother the crap out of me it have no purpose
S0198	i like it it do it
S0192	what for what purpose
S0198	and then you can keep it in the fridge
S0192	you never need to
S0198	throw things out the window for one it's not our garden
S0192	do you want any more
S0198	what
S0192	do you want any more
S0192	do you want cheese sorry
S0198	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0198	that's that's that's enough just make it a bite of a at some point
S0192	i'm mean to have two wrap here where's my other plate or be you just do them one at a time
S0198	yeah i guess the other one in the curry
S0192	shall we just eat this one first

S0192	that's dry enough isn't it
S0198	yeah it look good doesn't it
S0192	thing be that squeeze the erm
S0198	juice out of the tomato some more
S0192	it squeeze the juice out anyway so it's not too much of a problem thing be this thing's not hot enough so can't actually do it
S0198	yeah
S0192	cos you didn't do your duties your duties
S0198	i mean it'll just cook it slower will it
S0192	what will
S0198	or will it not sear it in the way you want to
S0192	erm
S0198	yeah
S0192	oh yeah
S0198	george foreman
S0192	yeah it will just cook it slower i guess
S0198	tea's hasn't it
S0192	it's get warm but er you might find it heat up quicker though if it's get two metal bits together than if it's get
S0198	something in between it
S0192	something in between it
S0198	yeah
S0192	but erm anyway
S0198	there's logic to that
S0192	there's logic to everything i say
S0192	i'm a logical person how much do you think go in here like two scoop
S0198	yeah
S0192	alright just hope that isn't too much this thing stay hot it look a bite like too much to me that that be absolutely gross

S0198	i mean how do it even get there what be it
S0192	i'm about to wrap my wrap after i've touch
S0192	what be it poo
S0198	it must be a bite of old food or something that's get squash somehow
S0198	very recently look like chocolate but

S0198	what do that bite don't know
S0192	no if only this be er chicken and not egg to fold it right over oh what that's the first time that's ever happen to me

S0198	or that can go on when yours go on and then i'll just eat this one
S0192	no put this on now i've get i've get two to go on i'll have to do mine at the same time really put it in the middle they cook quicker oh i'm disappoint can i have another plate your plate
S0198	do you mind if i just wait to cool down
S0192	yeah do you want me to bring that one through i'm just eat this one
S0198	no

S0198	yeah put it on there
S0192	i mean can you eat it cold what's it like cold

S0192	be a bite strange wouldn't it
S0198	mm
S0192	be that enough food
S0198	time for you run this crowd
S0192	yeah so be just a tma marker
S0198	mm
S0192	i think it's get some substroke influence on the niger congo languages
S0198	so what do that mark
S0192	past tense or modality
S0198	oh right yeah yeah
S0192	aspect progressive erm perfective
S0198	so do it only change accord to what it's like so to speak rather than what's what's actually be say it doesn't get so if it's past it'll be like for example regardless who's say it or
S0192	no that yeah they have a different marker for past a different marker for perfective and a different marker for something else
S0198	okay yeah
S0192	but it doesn't have any mean
S0198	no yeah
S0192	terrible
S0198	oh this cheese you wanna scrape up that cheese
S0192	yeah i know i need the spatula
S0198	yeah it's right next to it
S0192	i definitely wanna scrape up that cheese i'm a bite disappoint all come out
S0198	yeah
S0192	a whole horrible mess that one need a little bite more i think
S0198	that cheese scrape it off later
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah you don't wanna scrape the george foreman on er the metal
S0192	i'm not gonna scrape the george foreman
S0198	cheese fine
S0192	use the bread itself
S0198	mm mop it up
S0192	mm
S0198	do this need turn off or have you already turn it off
S0192	i've already turn it off i believe
S0198	ah something
S0192	give it a wipe not sure on the stuff external to the wrap
S0198	if it's necessary whatever it'll get eat it's in its purest form i suppose
S0198	no it taste good
S0192	do it
S0198	i like it tomato egg look at that chunk of tomato mm tomato
S0192	i think it taste too peppery
S0198	i don't think so do you actually
S0192	no mm that bite be a bite like a pizza
S0198	yeah with the tomato and the cheese
S0192	mm
S0198	mm
S0192	like tomato and cheese
S0198	don't get egg on pizza usually though do you
S0192	no bite of a strange pizza but it's funny that we've allocate certain things to certain things
S0198	certain things yeah
S0192	and then you go to korea and you're like no
S0198	don't put sugar on my garlic bread
S0192	no
S0198	but there's a good although things like if someone have put something else on your garlic bread like cheese you'd be like oh that's you know that's good
S0192	mm
S0198	it just depend what they put together or what be put together
S0192	i mean do you think strawberry yoghurt cornflakes and lettuce be a good mix
S0198	not really no
S0198	i think it be a bite odd
S0192	very strange
S0198	i'm not sure why
S0198	why that how that come about to be honest
S0192	strange people would do that but it's not that strange there's nothing strange about it
S0198	no
S0192	anything can go with anything
S0198	mm
S0192	and it's purely perception
S0198	what you think be good or not good
S0192	from years and years and years of not put yoghurt with lettuce
S0198	i mean yoghurt on salad isn't so strange it's the flavour crappy strawberry yoghurt on salad with cornflakes
S0192	with cornflakes that be laughable when you first saw that in korea it be just like what
S0198	what be this those time at school where you think you get your bloody fruit like they just get it backwards the fruit'd end up in mayonnaise and the
S0192	mm
S0198	salad would end up in some really strong fruit thing mm
S0192	very strange it's kind of a strange concept that we contribute to another society for four years
S0198	mm
S0192	when erm be a part of that society
S0198	make friends with people of the society
S0192	mm
S0198	hang out with
S0192	our families must think it's a bite odd
S0198	yeah where do you call home
S0192	do they really have any concept of what life's be like for us
S0198	no
S0192	i know they hear it from us but
S0198	it's hard to
S0192	i mean my mum and your mum get really nervous and struggle when they go for a job interview or something
S0198	mm
S0192	can you imagine them be that first day of our first school in korea be put up on a podium and er can you imagine them do this
S0198	not particularly
S0192	even find how to get to the school navigate the bus or the roads
S0198	how do you find out how to get to do someone tell you
S0192	yeah i think i be tell to catch the bus
S0198	yeah
S0192	other people get drive
S0198	yeah use to get pick up every day
S0192	mm
S0198	go to her class of six or seven children and then get drive home
S0192	it's cos she's a girl
S0198	what that she get pick up
S0192	i reckon
S0198	i think the teacher be just pass through anyway
S0192	mm
S0198	but maybe because she be a new girl to the country
S0192	yeah but i reckon teachers pass through me
S0198	yeah that's true
S0192	i'm pretty sure to a certain degree girls have preferential treatment i think it be a little bite easier be a girl not really worry about rape out there or anything apart from other westerners
S0198	some people'd disagree
S0192	you don't get treat worse cos you're a girl
S0198	people like people like definitely seem to have some bad treatment for be female
S0192	she's live in a big city now i mean i don't know korea's change as well 's change every few years
S0198	mm
S0192	there's a lot more port workers there now
S0198	mm
S0192	i imagine things be get less so but like i don't know i just think you're more trustworthy as a female teacher erm and when i first go into the elementary school they tell me be like you can't touch the children and like they'd've never say that to a girl
S0198	yeah
S0192	to have a principal be like yeah basically we don't like foreigners to my face i don't think they'd say that to a girl and that kind of stuff get away with you know what she do just cos she cry guy would've never get away with that
S0198	mm
S0192	we have to we have to do volleyball and stuff like that we have to girls can you know should but can get out of it
S0198	just as much as guy can volleyball's just i don't wanna er i think that just depend on the person
S0192	yeah but when you play volleyball there's no expectation you just have to stand there
S0198	i mean
S0192	as long as you're there contribute with us they're like spiker they get you right up there
S0198	mm
S0192	they make you play for the team they do all this kinda stuff you know what i mean
S0198	yeah they do if the girl's good at it i'm sure
S0192	and you probably didn't even have to do the female stuff so basically we have to do the male stuff but do you have to lay out the food or do anything like that
S0198	yeah i always do that kind of stuff
S0192	mm
S0198	always help clean up
S0192	but do you have to
S0198	otherwise i'd just be stand there do nothing i dunno i felt like i should
S0192	mm i mean it's different in the teachers' office but like when you come to the after thingy after volleyball thing
S0198	mm
S0192	be you set up the food then
S0198	yeah often i'd help yeah
S0192	mm
S0198	and go and bring the table in and
S0192	okay
S0198	mm
S0192	that's one thing do you not agree with me it's a little bite easier for a girl
S0198	i think it depend on i think other things
S0192	erm in the rural public school
S0198	i think the other i think there be other things that can make it harder to be a girl
S0192	i be talk about rural public school i mean i agree maybe it's harder for you to take control of your class
S0198	i think it depend i think it depend a lot on the school and your co teachers how that can be affect as well
S0192	as a guy i do have a certain amount of power over my female co teachers
S0198	mm
S0192	i think automatically
S0198	mm
S0192	even though i be foreign didn't quite work but i be the type of person to push it a little bite to test it so
S0198	mm
S0192	that's probably why i discover it
S0198	see if it do work
S0192	i mean there's a weird dynamic though cos quite a few of the co teachers be female and immediately a youngish female teacher doesn't really wanna be see hang around with a male foreigner too much
S0198	no yeah
S0192	cos rumour will start spread er they don't want that kind of stuff so i have to the point where co teachers aren't even talk to me come to me you know what i mean
S0198	mm
S0192	tell me something then walk off
S0192	i'm pretty sure some of it be partly because i be a guy and i be young and they all think i be handsome some girls couldn't even talk they'd just giggle i'm talk about grow women
S0192	the or whatever
S0198	yeah
S0192	be you make to stand up on the podium and give a speech cos and i be
S0198	i have to stand up
S0192	but you and weren't
S0198	i have to stand up and be introduce on the podium at sport day i don't remember talk
S0192	no we both have to give a speech to all the parent and the children and the teachers
S0198	mm
S0198	again that can be school specific
S0192	can be but there be four of us two it happen to guy
S0198	my school have a talk scholar as do as do er
S0192	's
S0198	as do 's yeah
S0192	yeah
S0198	talk scholars
S0192	it be only mine that didn't they basically make me do the work of the talk scholar didn't they
S0198	oh yeah in the afternoon class
S0192	yeah bastards
S0198	mm
S0192	i get pay more for it and if i have if i'd've roll over i wouldn't've do if i'm not the type of person i be
S0198	yeah
S0192	i wouldn't've get pay for that
S0198	i know
S0198	some people do though they're crazy it's really shitty that very few national holiday be actually real national holiday and can make you go in
S0192	yeah
S0198	like really chuseok be up in the air maybe maybe not that's ridiculous
S0192	you can't really call it a national holiday can you if it's er
S0198	i mean if chuseok's up for grab then any of them be right
S0192	yeah oh it's chuseok yeah definitely i mean that's
S0198	i mean get it off in the end but
S0192	there must be some people that don't
S0198	yeah
S0192	that's their thanksgiving that's their bloody christmas
S0198	who's send their children to school then too give them a break
S0192	mm do you want another cigarette

S0198	this whole
S0192	i have a really good time both time in china

S0192	i think we choose good spot i'd like to er if i be to live in china i'd like to kind of select a uni that be i'd like to see the pay go up though
S0198	in a place that you'd wanna live mm yeah be that what you be gonna say
S0192	yeah somewhere i'd wanna live
S0198	mm
S0192	like could you live in harbin all year round
S0198	no i dunno
S0192	it's a long old winter and
S0198	it wasn't a particularly pleasant town i didn't think it be fine it have a high street and that i suppose it wasn't that bad actually
S0192	yeah i mean down by the ice and stuff it be quite nice
S0198	it just seem treacherous try to walk around on the ice
S0192	but er the problem be that it's like scorch hot for half the year well not for half the year for like three months or something it get hot pretty quick there didn't it i remember look and it be still cold in korea but it be like
S0198	yeah yeah it be
S0198	yeah
S0192	it be a bite strange erm
S0192	i don't think i could live there all year round it be good to go for a month
S0198	i wonder what it'd be like when that river's flow be weird see it gradually freeze
S0192	mm freeze solid as well
S0198	yeah
S0192	i dunno where i'd live i think where erm what's her face be 's probably quite a good spot
S0198	yeah she's down in
S0192	she's i mean you're not
S0192	i don't know if it's a great spot actually she's probably if she doesn't leave that island too much it's probably an alright place to live it's the most tropical part of china it kind of look a bite like vietnam and like place erm so if she just stay there but all she's get really near to her be massive cities she's get zhangjiang where and be she's get guangzhou she's get hong kong macau they're all pretty close but that's kinda it
S0198	mm
S0192	it's like another twelve to eighteen hour bus journey up to like erm i can't remember the name of that state now it's get dalian in it and like you know those like limestone cast and go there that's not too far from them but she's another few hours from the coast i think china's humungous
S0198	mm
S0192	constantly have to do twelve hour train and not really cover very much at all
S0198	that's humungous
S0192	it's pretty good though the train that we take from erm
S0198	that squirrel's always there
S0192	where be it from qingdao to qufu
S0198	mm
S0192	that be get up to like three hundred and something kilometres an hour
S0198	that be quite that be that nice train wasn't it that be just a day train
S0192	that be a proper nice bullet train it wasn't that expensive be it it be like twenty quid or something
S0198	be that like five hours or something
S0192	take us quite far yeah
S0198	it wasn't a sleeper be it
S0192	erm and then we take a train from beijing to harbin what happen there wasn't there like a problem there be like no ticket how do we get a ticket there be no sleeper ticket
S0198	there be no sleeper ticket
S0192	even that far in advance
S0198	do we get one in the end though what happen
S0192	do you remember we book it ten days in advance and there be no sleeper ticket
S0198	so do we go by day
S0192	yeah we have to go by day and we get on a fast train again it be a pretty nice train again
S0198	mm
S0192	we go by day we arrive at night though it be already dark do you remember and we be like in that underground car park ready to take a taxi it be like really quite cold
S0198	do we still have even though it wasn't even though the time wasn't schedule for a sleeper do we still get a sleeper bed though or be we in seat
S0192	no i think we be in seat i remember see you could see erm you know like the other train that have a dial that tell you the speed
S0198	yeah
S0192	this one have a dial that tell you the temperature
S0198	oh yeah
S0192	do you remember cos we be like look at the temperature and see it get colder and colder as we be like
S0198	mm and then we get out cos it be night time that be the coldest night wasn't it when it get down to minus
S0192	it be about minus twenty when we arrive i think erm
S0198	yeah i think it get lower than that
S0192	be it no i think the next night be the coldest night or something and then it warm up for a few days i think it get down to like minus twenty seven or something i think be like the coldest we get to but it be actually on a bite of a mild patch for a couple of nights
S0198	that be a tiny little room we have there as well so
S0192	yeah freeze solid everything be freeze solid
S0198	oh yeah the windows outside
S0192	what a cool place you actually live in the ice like proper
S0198	you couldn't leave your shit on the windowsill cos it would freeze
S0192	no cos it'd freeze yeah the windowsill inside your room but the room be all hot
S0198	yeah they do heat them
S0192	we weren't cold
S0198	we be never cold
S0192	no inside
S0198	the only time be maybe the problem be er if the shower be hot they have a tendency to be boil do you remember
S0192	how much do it cost to yeah
S0198	and i get that weird skin shit go on on my legs
S0192	oh yeah
S0198	all those like dry winter rashes or something
S0192	the cold'd screw your skin up
S0198	it be hardy on our skin
S0192	how much do it cost them to heat that place
S0198	i don't know
S0192	it's minus thirty
S0198	i know
S0192	pound against the wall like try to cool down the place and they manage to keep it like toasty inside
S0198	yeah it's kind of amaze actually i mean surely that stuff do break and people just die or something it's not like you're in canada
S0192	no
S0198	in toronto deal with the temperatures
S0192	yeah definitely not you're in northern china you're about as close as you can get to russia and mongolia in in china really without be in the without be in outer mongolia i'm glad i finally understand the difference between inner mongolia and outer mongolia
S0198	outer mongolia mm
S0192	inner mongolia be simply mongolia
S0198	mm
S0192	outer mongolia be well use to be mongolia but china take it
S0198	erm shame that just like china just take to that and
S0192	it's pretty crap isn't it i mean yeah because they didn't want to be
S0198	yeah
S0192	be the problem
S0198	it wasn't a choice be it
S0192	no
S0198	and they be an establish
S0192	yeah one of the oldest civilisations on the planet
S0198	mm
S0192	i mean we meet the dalai lama
S0198	mm
S0192	how amaze be that didn't shake his hand or anything but we have a teach from him
S0198	mm
S0192	we be only
S0198	for the tea and biscuits
S0192	it be probably only like ten people
S0198	weird little shitty radio they make you buy for no reason
S0192	how how many people away do you think he be like ten people
S0198	yeah he wasn't very far away we be round the side
S0192	yeah i'd say he be about like ten people i think
S0198	yeah
S0192	maybe like ten row maybe fifteen at the most
S0198	no i wouldn't even say it be cos people er
S0192	we have a very clear view of him
S0198	cos when people start pray there there be quite a bite of room for them to
S0192	yeah
S0198	to squat and bend down so he ah see what that squirrel just properly yank something out of the tree then
S0192	yeah erm
S0198	it's a proper resident that one
S0192	we have to get a special id card didn't we to go and see the dalai lama
S0198	still have it
S0192	yeah i think i still have mine
S0198	in my bits and bob somewhere
S0192	i've get all those note and coin
S0198	yeah i've get i've get a thing under the bed of just er shite like at one point i be still collect bloody stub and stuff stop do that it get silly
S0192	i think before we move out of here another task that we have be to like sell and to get rid of stuff
S0198	mm
S0192	i'm gonna try and sell my cds after things calm down like in january
S0198	mm my parent message
S0192	ebay what those things your dad be sell
S0198	mm
S0192	fair what be he sell again
S0198	er some like vintage nintendo game things they're call nintendo watch i don't know if you've ever see one they're like little rectangle things that fold out and then
S0192	wear it as a watch
S0198	no no no it's a it's a little handheld it's er kind of like a game boy but like a nintendo a different version they're like there be like a donkey kong one and like different package and stuff they must've have a brief blip in the nineties or something because i never
S0192	how do your dad get hold of them
S0198	i think he get them from he's find them at boot fair he's have them for like
S0192	just cheap
S0198	he's have them for a few years he just hasn't he's just be wait until i've be home to sell them as though it's gonna bring me like hundreds of pound when it's really just gonna be like two hundred quid
S0192	mm that's not too bad
S0198	but i feel bad cos i know they don't have much money and i know my dad keep spend shit on me and i just feel like he should take at least half of it
S0192	be your mum bother about it
S0198	no my mum doesn't care she doesn't worry too much
S0192	i mean our parent haven't spend much on us in the last ten years really
S0198	no
S0192	so i guess if we're home now they might wanna treat us
S0198	be really good just for someone just to win a large amount of money
S0192	they probably want to treat you because they want to make you want to come home
S0198	ah can't think about leave yet
S0192	cos they wanna show you how easy it be to be at home and how your family can help you out and all that kinda stuff i reckon there's an insidious plan afoot
S0198	mm
S0192	
S0192	pickers
S0198	mm
S0198	winklepickers er that actor's really random
S0192	yeah
S0198	he's a really like good person do you notice though when he the episode where they get marry
S0198	the episode he marry sophie his parent be kind of in the background but you never see them or meet them
S0192	yeah
S0198	they're never he never interact even though he have mention his other i think that be weird that
S0192	mm
S0198	they obviously hadn't
S0192	hadn't use those character yet
S0198	hadn't didn't know how to work them into the plot
S0192	they probably didn't need to
S0198	whereas have an episode just about them visit
S0192	for christmas
S0198	give them a good breadth of character development
S0192	definitely it's a real jezing better go and answer that i wouldn't wanna jez it
S0198	mm
S0192	or do a mark all in my pant
S0198	they be funny parent
S0192	mark in my pant yeah
S0198	yeah ah poor jeremy
S0192	poor mark poor both of them
S0198	no mark be er as er dobby say you're a total dick
S0192	yeah yeah he kind of be do you think jez isn't then
S0198	well no i mean they're both dicks aren't they in their own ways but er not in a they're too funny to for it to matter
S0192	jez be
S0198	i think it's quite realistic in some ways
S0192	yeah i mean to a certain degree people be pretty crazy
S0198	yeah
S0192	life be a bite of a peep show
S0198	and life be a bite er just shit
S0198	sometimes
S0192	i mean obviously it's exaggerate
S0198	yeah and also er it's also they also that it be sort of self inflict to an extent
S0192	mm
S0198	because of er who they be and
S0192	yeah
S0198	the decisions that they make that things happen to them
S0192	yeah definitely
S0198	just need to
S0192	can't help themselves
S0198	definitely have the thoughts
S0192	kind of have a more nature than nurture aspect to it they be who they be and they can't really change
S0198	i wonder what the last season'll be like
S0192	yeah i don't know hope it's funny
S0198	yeah
S0192	i'm sure it will be all the other season before have be pretty damn funny
S0198	the last one well the baby'll be quite big
S0192	perhaps
S0198	oh another squirrel's come down to
S0198	come check out what's go on with his mat
S0192	ah yeah
S0198	er be there be there like just a chain of tree that
S0198	go round this area do they all live
S0192	oh you say a chain of tree what go around this area
S0198	oh do i
S0192	yeah
S0198	that's interest
S0192	which or that
S0198	yeah
S0192	yeah i presume so he's right come down what's his little mate gonna do
S0198	i dunno share be they friends
S0192	i don't know
S0198	he's gonna pop up the other side i mean i dunno i swear that fence down there be get worse
S0192	hopefully they'll have a fight yeah maybe do you reckon they're gonna fight
S0198	yeah where be he the other one
S0192	he know he's there i think
S0198	be that why he's move away with the food
S0192	yeah perhaps it's nice to have squirrels just well it's not our garden be it we don't actually have a garden but
S0198	no but it be a bite of wilderness none the less
S0192	mm
S0198	and the squirrel definitely help with the vibe
S0192	yeah
S0198	actually have a creature out there every day
S0192	and pretty much everyone's see it it's come over haven't they
S0198	and the fact that there's fruit tree and the fact that nobody use their garden otherwise we'd if if if somebody if they just use their garden a lot then we'd constantly be star at each other
S0192	we'd feel more conscious yeah
S0198	we'd probably have we'd probably end up talk
S0192	that garden's a mess this one could get use
S0198	i keep forget
S0192	but if they're not use it
S0198	that that garden next door
S0192	be part of our house
S0198	be part of our house yeah
S0198	you realise that i keep forget cos whenever we talk about them and the fact no whenever i come in i always talk about the fact that we don't know who live downstairs clearly they er that couple live there and that guy live there
S0192	surely and be gonna see this as proper terrace house
S0198	yeah yeah
S0192	this be how we do it
S0198	mm
S0192	like you've get
S0198	you get your little rectangle bite at the back
S0192	yeah
S0192	that we don't have access to
S0198	mm
S0192	there's like them them them them
S0198	yeah
S0192	them so how many neighbour do we actually have
S0198	someone's like when they realise they could turn these house into little flats
S0192	yeah
S0198	someone start laugh
S0192	and fairly nice little flats
S0198	yeah
S0192	yeah and then they've just do the whole thing
S0198	as say hers be a purpose build block of flats in and i quite like it i think it be quite nice like it be a proper flat like it you know it be fairly new and everything but erm she do say it be quite a bite smaller than this
S0192	mm
S0198	and i think it be
S0192	we have
S0192	six neighbour
S0198	yeah
S0192	six different households that be attach to us
S0198	yeah
S0192	that's insane
S0198	mm
S0192	like one two
S0192	four five six
S0198	mm with numerous couple or whatever in these
S0192	now that be terrace house cos normally in a proper terrace house if you own the house
S0198	mm
S0192	like a small little house like my mum have or something
S0198	you'd only have two people
S0192	then it's just your next door neighbour on either side
S0198	mm
S0192	that's just two
S0198	we've get them above and below
S0192	i don't think you can get any more than this there be no way of have more neighbour
S0198	no
S0192	unless your build be some really long shape that connect with a bunch of other build
S0198	no this be the only way it's like be in er flats i suppose you've get them either side of you but not what's nice about this this flat be that we get the front and the back of the build
S0192	yeah
S0198	i think there be some flats that we look at before that have come up where you just get one side of it
S0192	yeah definitely
S0198	they split they split it differently
S0192	definitely i agree
S0198	so it's nice that we go
S0192	across the whole build
S0198	so you've get a front and a back
S0192	yeah
S0192	i think this be a good find i really don't think we could've find much better than this
S0198	yeah
S0192	with what we be try to do okay we need to shower and get ready
S0198	yeah we do
S0192	okay
S0198	shall we do that now
S0192	yeah
