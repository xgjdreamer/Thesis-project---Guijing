S0456	there you go
S0465	so what be your second book about then
S0456	it's the phone ring
S0456	yeah the second book be very different from the first
S0465	yes
S0456	it have a very unexciting title because it's erm the erm use of of and to in multi word units
S0465	oh right
S0456	so
S0456	go away from from them just be prepositions erm or the to infinitive but look at where where be it use where be it use mostly they can be prepositions they can be to infinitives but yeah they're they be the things and that also vary between erm when it's be use when whether you speak whether it's you're deliver a speech
S0465	yeah
S0456	or whether it's in literature all the literature
S0465	okay right how be the first book how do it go the first book
S0456	well so far i've make something eighty five pound in total but
S0465	eighty five pound oh that's that's not it's really not
S0456	it's not harry potter
S0465	well er
S0456	but that's that's what you expect you you you're glad that it's out there erm
S0465	have you have you take anything for
S0456	but it's it it mean it mean i think the total sell now be two hundred thirty something like that
S0465	two hundred thirty
S0456	yeah once once it go over i think it be three hundred but i don't think they say like three hundred fifty once it go over three hundred fifty they'll they'll consider do a paperback
S0465	yeah
S0456	erm we'll see erm
S0465	which publisher be it responsible for it be it
S0456	it's palgrave macmillan palgrave for this one and the third book erm we have interest both from benjamins and from routledge but i think we'll go for benjamins
S0465	yeah
S0456	it's there's there's more in favour erm of that
S0465	okay
S0456	and we've get we've get just a the best of the best as contributors
S0465	yeah yeah
S0456	so but yeah that's that's that's just the kind of job that i'm give myself i haven't even finish this one i have not even finish this one then i start on that one
S0465	mm
S0456	so
S0465	i think well it hopefully it will it will be the the second and the third one
S0456	that'll be the the the harry potter beat no
S0465	i think it's gonna be difficult to know decide what be this
S0465	well how many languages have be translate i think it's one hundred or something like this
S0456	easily i mean if you look at all the kids' book they they it's eighty plus languages isn't it
S0456	there's there's there's even a latin version of harry potter i've see that in that er in london
S0465	oh really
S0456	so yeah it's it's if you if you're a scholar or if you want to teach latin at school
S0465	yeah
S0456	it's perfect isn't it
S0465	it be yeah
S0465	but but what be it popular now as it use to be latin study
S0456	well they're by now in britain there's hardly a state school leave
S0465	yeah
S0456	that do the classics and if they they do it no more than say beyond up to rather gcses
S0465	yeah
S0456	the ones who read classics at university tend to be public school kid
S0465	oh right what about universities they do they do they
S0456	yeah i mean liverpool still do it yeah er they certainly i don't know about greek but they certainly do do latin but i'm sure they do greek because obviously they've get archaeology
S0465	yeah
S0456	and erm both the history and the archaeology departments in liverpool be quite strong yeah so you you would have to have that as record erm
S0465	interest really
S0456	i know somebody who do archaeology and he he go to look at coptic which be different again
S0465	mm yeah coptic yeah
S0456	so
S0465	mm
S0456	talk about coptic the farsi speakers of persia in
S0465	mm
S0456	iran what alphabet do they use do they use the same alphabet as the arab alphabet or have they get their own
S0465	yeah er similar to no it be er i be gonna say exactly similar to the kurdish and arabic you know because we
S0456	mm
S0465	we have erm er sound and also we
S0456	mm
S0465	have a alphabet which isn't
S0456	mm
S0465	doesn't exist neither in farsi or
S0456	yeah
S0465	in er arabic you know for example
S0456	mm
S0465	zhe but in farsi
S0456	mm
S0465	i mean in kurdish we don't have zhe we have zhe but er
S0456	mm mm
S0465	arabic doesn't have zhe the sound of zhe
S0456	mm
S0465	but er we don't have er the sound of the in kurdish the
S0456	mm
S0465	but in arabic there be the sound of er of the pronunciation of the
S0456	mm mm
S0465	again
S0456	mm
S0465	the er doesn't exist
S0456	mm
S0465	in farsi so
S0456	so be it but be it just single sound that be different
S0465	single sound yeah yeah single sound yeah
S0456	cos you still have the if you look at say icelandic which
S0465	yeah
S0456	use the modern alphabet but have the thorn
S0465	yeah
S0456	for the thur but their thur sound be not a soft one it's sort of more harsh
S0465	yeah
S0456	don't know how it's pronounce
S0465	yeah yeah just again er in kurdish we don't have the sound of vur
S0456	er mm mm
S0465	but in arabic be vur well
S0456	yeah
S0465	it's use everything everywhere and in
S0456	yeah
S0465	again they don't have the sound of vur
S0456	mm
S0465	so i think kurdish more similar
S0456	mm
S0465	farsi than to arabic you know but i wouldn't say
S0456	mm
S0465	entirely different but there there be just
S0456	yeah
S0465	it's easier for kurdish people to learn farsi than arabic
S0456	right
S0465	the grammar or arabic grammar be
S0456	very different
S0465	difficult and
S0456	mm
S0465	er complicate erm but it's not difficult to learn it
S0456	yeah yeah but the the conference i be at in in there be at where there be two and one fairly average be unfortunately of the conference but he be from irani kurdistan
S0465	yeah yeah
S0456	and it be about yeah learn because he say the iranian constitution
S0465	mm
S0456	guarantee that kind of freedom so there's there should be no discrimination depend on what religion you have et cetera or what background
S0465	yeah
S0456	he say so that's in the constitution however if you then go by the curriculum the school curriculum things be not possible so he say that if you have kurdish bear kid in mix cities usually the border cities
S0465	yeah
S0456	they cannot explain er traditional festivities et cetera
S0465	oh right
S0456	because what they they have to then use farsi to explain it
S0465	yeah
S0456	which make it more difficult for them
S0465	yes
S0456	and he say it they're look at you know they do that be his paper they do the research on that
S0465	mm
S0456	erm and who that they can push the government
S0465	why who be they
S0456	he's he's very very he's very very supportive of the new regime and he say you know er the the group diplomats obviously that they have look after the the non nuclear proliferation thing erm he say he's he's very very impress he think he's one of the best diplomats erm but they they try to do these this research so that they can say these be the things that be happen and that be happen and they would be better blah blah blah so they can get a change in the curriculum so you have erm
S0465	yeah they haven't be successful
S0456	yeah
S0465	i think last week or two weeks ago
S0456	mm
S0465	they decide that
S0456	mm
S0465	they propose to the parliament that
S0456	mm
S0465	one of the top universities
S0456	mm
S0465	should have a kurdish department
S0456	mm
S0465	however that's gonna be difficult because the students
S0456	mm
S0465	who well the education system's in farsi
S0456	mm
S0465	you can't
S0456	yeah
S0465	you're not allow to er
S0456	mm use kurdish
S0465	like use your kurdish you know
S0456	yeah
S0465	so er that be gonna be a problem they haven't decide to basically sort the education system from like primary school and then
S0456	mm mm
S0465	college to university and the other thing be they haven't er not the government be not very keen on it
S0456	yeah
S0465	at the moment er i've have experience with the iranian kurds when they come here and er erm it be sometimes difficult for us to
S0456	mm
S0465	well i tell you the time
S0456	mm
S0465	it's difficult for us even to interpret and translate for them at the home office
S0456	mm
S0465	because they have be educate in farsi and then the especially those who be educate
S0456	mm
S0465	and then they they go to university and
S0456	mm
S0465	finish university they sit there and they when they start to talk er the half of the their er conversations or their speech be
S0456	mm
S0465	farsi and the problem with them they say to me they say then well i don't know the farsi the sorani word for it the kurdish word for it so
S0456	mm
S0465	he's gonna struggle
S0456	yeah yeah
S0465	so i someone like me from iraq
S0456	mm
S0465	i will find it difficult to
S0456	mm
S0465	translate for someone who's from kurdish from iran because he doesn't know the sorani word for the farsi
S0456	yeah yeah yeah
S0465	for those farsi word
S0456	because kurdish really would be a second language
S0465	exactly it would be the second language
S0456	yeah
S0465	so the majority of the time ninety five percent
S0456	mm
S0465	er we will cancel that interview and then we have to bring someone
S0456	mm mm who's a farsi speaker
S0465	who be the farsi speaker er a kurdish and farsi speaker
S0456	ideally yeah
S0465	ideally yeah because
S0465	the home office deem that if you ask for someone to er an interpreter from iran
S0456	mm
S0465	that's discrimination you can't ask
S0456	mm
S0465	or from iraq you can't ask for this so they have to be the language
S0456	yeah
S0465	and he say then well i need er someone who speak erm er for example arabic and kurdish or
S0456	mm
S0465	farsi and kurdish erm sometimes
S0456	mm
S0456	yeah because you you become well it's it's so specialise that it must be difficult to find these people yeah even as like crossover
S0465	yeah and we have we have like er
S0456	mm mm
S0465	one or two interpreters in northwest so basically they speak both languages but the the problem be
S0456	mm
S0465	i mean i we would still be able to to understand them you know what i mean er but it er
S0456	mm
S0465	it as you know the interpreter of the translations that you can't do it
S0456	mm mm
S0465	base on er guess you know sort of thing and especially if that's their future you know you you have to be precise
S0456	yeah yeah
S0465	and then you can't just have er every sentence you say can you tell me what that word mean you know the the it's it's not a professional thing you know so
S0456	mm
S0465	er we just stop the interview we don't we don't carry on you know they they always understand that explanation
S0456	yeah well because it be it be legal isn't it it's not just somebody go out to buy fruit and veg
S0465	yeah you're right yeah and then it's gonna cause some of these problems as well later because when
S0456	mm
S0465	if the application's refuse
S0456	mm mm
S0465	er the yeah they'll appeal and then they will go to the court and the independent immigration judge will say then well hang on
S0456	they will have reason to yeah mm
S0465	er er that be that that that's legally wrong you know what i mean so you should that shouldn't have carry carry on
S0456	mm
S0465	but we've see case in the past now they've they refer back the the the the the the the application to to the home office you know to reconsider then they interview them which be a little bite er it's costly you know so they they hope they'll get they try to prevent that you know i think
S0456	mm mm mm mm mm yeah yeah
S0465	mm mm
S0456	well it make sense give give that things don't become easier at least there be still rule and regulations in place that
S0465	yeah yeah
S0456	er
S0465	i mean er er the problem be with er with languages and and dialects especially in with kurdish it's a bite sometimes a bite complicate because er in my area
S0456	mm
S0465	there's not only kurdish irani
S0456	mm
S0465	we have hourani as well i don't understand any word of hourani
S0456	mm
S0465	how do you speak do they speak kurdish you know what i mean and then
S0465	half of half of half of them be they live in iran and the the er the rest live iraq in iraq
S0465	so it will be really difficult you know so they have to bring someone who speak hourani dialect and hourani dialect i think in er in the uk we only have one
S0465	one or two of them
S0456	oh god yes
S0465	yeah so
S0465	er er it be not easy
S0456	that look like my neighbour be back from their holiday which would be great because i need them to sign a piece of paper cos i remember that they that limousine well it's not a limousine it's a minibus
S0465	yeah
S0456	but he take the i suppose yeah four people two kid two adults
S0465	yeah
S0456	go to go on holiday for a while not just er it's cheaper be it
S0465	yeah
S0456	yeah i'm go by taxi back to
S0465	from
S0456	yeah it's late in the afternoon early even
S0456	yay it's them
S0456	probably asleep but i can always catch them later yeah they definitely catch the sun
S0465	yeah
S0465	yeah so you're gonna get there late night at
S0456	yeah early in the morning
S0465	early in the morning
S0456	er the plane arrive just after quarter past at night and erm taxi back so be in bed by about one and er eight o'clock the car be book in for the garage cos they er they and erm there seem to be an oil leak but there wasn't an oil leak they just overfill it
S0465	yeah
S0456	erm and he have it up in the ramp and we go underneath and he say yeah yeah look at this look this be like oh you've miss that one and it's you know where the the drive shaft be
S0465	yeah
S0456	with front wheel drive you have a rubber er cover
S0465	yeah
S0456	you know like a coat thing er and that protect the metal
S0465	yeah
S0456	bear inside erm from dust and everything and that one will split
S0465	yeah
S0456	over time just happen er but it need to be replace because otherwise it become seriously expensive
S0465	yeah
S0456	so that one need to be do and they they also saw oh yeah it's a tiny tiny hole in your exhaust but we can melt that it's like fine
S0465	yeah
S0456	erm and they say anyway er there there's a cheap pipe cos obviously for all the scandinavian cars they have special arrangements for the heat to get
S0465	yeah
S0456	get it warmer quicker
S0465	yeah
S0456	erm and i think all the cars have the same so and the old one be just sort of fall to piece so they take it out and they say er we don't have to replace it because it's summer
S0465	yeah
S0456	but
S0465	yeah
S0456	just
S0465	do you need the er car there er
S0456	yeah because otherwise you you you be get bore stiff
S0465	yeah
S0456	there be nothing there and you can't go
S0456	well you can cycle i mean my my mate's there cycle everywhere but erm no it's
S0465	but you don't need it for your work base in the university yeah
S0456	no erm even when i move away i still cycle to the to the amazement of my finnish neighbour because
S0456	obviously if it's snow you don't cycle it's like but
S0456	it's it's safe why isn't it if you can crash with a car
S0465	yeah it be yeah yeah yeah but will be totally difficult isn't it
S0456	well yeah it's a mountain bike and you know they they clear bits erm and the snow be not really the worst thing because usually it's cold enough so the snow be fairly hard
S0465	yeah
S0456	it be ice
S0465	ice yeah
S0456	er but that's also the bite that be difficult if you're in a car
S0465	yeah you're not plan come back er next year cos you've only get two years
S0456	the year after next
S0465	the year after next
S0456	erm i'll have to see i'm already i'm already cry my eye out that i have to leave now it's like i don't want to pack
S0456	apart from the fact that pack be always a disaster anyway
S0456	but
S0465	just er
S0456	plus plus there's there's always people that i somehow don't manage to see perhaps even here i mean if i can't go to to london and to london to to to scotland yeah at least it's a it's quite a trek but even around here it's like how do we not manage to go there
S0465	mm
S0456	but you know you always think oh there's load of time and then suddenly you know it's the last week

S0465	er but hope i don't think they will cause a problem
S0456	yeah oddly enough but i suppose even now it's still one of the whitest cities
S0465	yeah
S0456	which because if you think it be one of the first point of immigration but that wasn't really that much you know i mean there be free slave et cetera but the big wave in the sixties seventies didn't reach and if they do these people will have move away but you know you have like in yorkshire and the midlands
S0465	yeah
S0456	far more asian bear

S0456	and
S0465	there be some place like this yeah

S0465	mm yeah
S0456	the somalis they be very very upset about the new somalis come here
S0465	yeah
S0456	cos they'd settle
S0465	they'd settle yeah right yeah
S0456	and that happen time and again isn't it it's the old er
S0465	mm
S0456	generation of of or wave of migration that than think yeah we've we've just about manage to it's the resources we don't want other people to come in here
S0465	no

S0465	mm
S0456	it have never be as hot as last year's summer but most of the days it wasn't just twenty five degrees it be around thirty

S0456	and then very very cold winter but now and to the point where you know we have snow and helsinki have no snow in winter
S0465	oh right
S0456	so yeah it's probably not the place where you want to stay because
S0465	i think it's a bite cold i dunno i it er never appeal to me to go there
S0456	no no
S0456	why do i go there
S0456	i know why i go but yeah it's it's not the
S0456	the most appeal especially because i've be in greece and yeah if you have the choice where would you go greece this be why the germans hate it so much it's too beautiful
S0465	yeah
S0456	and it's
S0465	well temporarily be alright you be you're you be there aren't you for a couple of years three years four years god know you know but

S0465	it's your mood change
S0456	you have to take vitamin d tablets and now with with the change weather where where it's even dark in winter it use to be clear sky
S0465	mm
S0456	it's it's even worse let me just change that because i know if it go over forty minutes i can't send it to myself which seem to be the only thing i can do so i'll stop this and then carry on as a second one
