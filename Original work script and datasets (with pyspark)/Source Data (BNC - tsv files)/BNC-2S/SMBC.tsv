S0540	er bulgur wheat mm
S0541	mm no what's that
S0540	it just kind of like a few recipes of aubergines
S0541	mm
S0540	i think they apparently you know they have more recipes er or aubergines than anything else
S0541	oh really cos i love aubergine and i make the same aubergine thing all the time which be really bore and it's just roast aubergine with garlic and mint and balsamic vinegar and i i do that
S0540	mm
S0541	all the time
S0540	well yeah you can give it a twist and you know
S0541	mm i need to do something else
S0540	yeah
S0541	with my aubergine cos i do love them that's the only thing i make i need to i'm i'm in a real food rut again
S0540	also you know i think you know i love this this italian risotto recipe
S0541	oh
S0540	i use a new york chef and it be in this little leaflet that that be all about parmigiana er parmesan cheese
S0541	okay
S0540	so this you know er i think broccoli and peas be use
S0541	okay
S0540	but anyway oh this er risotto be the absolutely delicious
S0541	mm
S0540	not heavy quite
S0541	mm
S0540	light and fluffy
S0541	okay
S0540	and you can sort of er you know reduce the sort of the heaviness by not add too much parmesan cheese
S0541	okay
S0540	but i mean risotto you know it's so simple as a recipe
S0541	mm
S0540	just like the you know i use the broccoli water the the stock from boil the broccoli
S0541	yeah
S0540	and add that as the base for the chicken stock
S0541	okay
S0540	so there's a bite more depth to the stock and then you know i also and then you know need to add wine if you want to
S0541	oh
S0540	oh but i mean
S0541	mm
S0540	it's just i mean that doesn't even need any type of spice for any
S0541	mm
S0540	it's just so delicious
S0541	mm
S0540	just er broccoli and peas and and and and and the rice and you you know
S0541	yeah yeah yeah
S0540	the chicken stock and
S0541	mm
S0540	maybe a bite of wine and the parmesan cheese but
S0541	mm
S0540	i don't i didn't use parmesan cheese because you know it be a bite too heavy
S0541	mm
S0540	but otherwise i think it could be really cheap because just green peas and broccoli
S0541	yeah i guess i guess it's get the protein source in
S0540	yeah
S0541	pulse
S0540	yeah
S0541	i do get really bore
S0540	mm
S0541	of i get bore of them very quickly and then i and then i have i feel like i've get a dietary erm imbalance
S0540	yeah mm have you recreate your greek recipes like you know the ones that you have in crete
S0541	mm well i i do these like they do these kind of quite good lentil patties which be really good i don't know how they do them but i'm try to recreate them and i find a recipe in my leith's cookbook but it just but it didn't have any egg in it so they didn't really bind together
S0540	oh i see mm

S0540	so you deep fry
S0541	you know i've only get a limit amount of kind of like brain for cook it's just
S0540	yeah
S0541	quite a small piece of my brain and
S0540	i know me too
S0541	i it's just i can't sustain the interest in it
S0540	no
S0541	and and i'm so like do other things then i i'm i'm just really hungry and i have to eat
S0540	yeah
S0541	i'm not very good i mean i i do go through a thing of kind of plan and you know make my aubergine dish at the begin of the week and do like another vegetable dish even if it's just like green bean or something

S0540	oh you know
S0541	garlic
S0540	spanish paella by ottolenghi

S0541	also cos it's be summer and i've just be eat salads
S0540	mm
S0541	with and then i make my vegetable dish
S0540	mm
S0541	to have on the side and then i buy like that fish from waitrose you know the kind of mackerel or
S0540	mm mm
S0541	i some a little bite of chicken or i just eat lentils so my diet be really bore just really bore i seem to spend a lot erm on food though i'm like why be i and i think maybe it's just because i'm kind of here so you know when you go out like you have lunch out whereas now i'm like buy stuff to make my lunch you know so like i'm spend i'm aware that i'm spend more money
S0540	yeah
S0541	but i'm i'm only just buy stuff for lunch like
S0540	yeah
S0541	but i'm just like why be i seem to be constantly buy
S0540	yeah i know
S0541	food i'm like why why be i eat so much why can't i just kind of like survive off less
S0540	yeah if if you know yeah it it feel like erm it it magnify i guess if you eat at home a lot
S0541	if you eat what
S0540	eat you know eat at home magnify what you're eat
S0541	yeah it do yeah i guess so
S0540	or what you're cook or erm you know
S0541	erm
S0540	because you know you you can think about what you've cook and what you've eat er in a kind of continuous thoughts
S0541	and it take more time whereas
S0540	mm
S0541	if you're out you just buy something right so you're
S0540	well you forget
S0541	not prepare stuff
S0540	yeah and you can forget about it you know when you come home like you
S0541	i just feel too much time be take up with like buy food and like prepare it
S0540	yeah i feel the same sometimes
S0541	it's so bore
S0540	you i i think it's cheaper for me to just eat out you know have a singapore
S0541	for
S0540	or something at a thai place
S0541	well for lunch be probably be if you just go and have
S0540	yeah
S0541	at a pret
S0540	yeah even you know erm sometimes even er you know some readymade food from waitrose or mark and spencer's you know cheap enough
S0541	maybe god i don't eat that stuff anymore when i be work in the body shop i live off that stuff for three years
S0540	oh
S0541	i think that's why my stomach's in such a terrible state actually
S0540	oh no
S0541	cos i just eat prepare meals and i i be stress out for three and a half years and and
S0540	be you there so long
S0541	eh
S0540	be you there for three and a half years
S0541	yeah
S0540	oh that's such a long time
S0541	mm
S0540	you do so well
S0541	there's no point
S0540	to survive that
S0541	it's just pointless
S0540	really
S0541	it's just kind of like yeah it's just pointless
S0540	but erm yeah yeah
S0541	that's just pointless a pointless waste of time
S0540	no
S0541	mm i think my expectations about life be just too high you know i kind of expect to do interest work that's well pay i expect to have like a a kind of you know full social life these things just don't happen
S0540	yeah i
S0541	you
S0540	i i understand yeah well if you look from the advertise agency of course that's the norm isn't it and er but it's
S0541	i dunno
S0540	a kind of norm that last for you know a very brief period of time in your life and it's not a kind of think you want to to last be it though i mean you it work for ten years maybe not
S0541	i think i i blame yoga for a lot of stuff
S0540	oh yes
S0541	i think so cos like before i start do yoga when i be drink load of alcohol and not do yoga i be on a completely different level i be just on a
S0540	what do you mean level
S0541	just completely different a day to day superficial like not think about anything
S0540	oh yeah
S0541	just go from one thing to the next without think about it and now unfortunately i think about everything and cos i'm sober all the time which to me be not a big deal because now i'm like this be second nature to me now and i don't you know i mean people say to me like my hairdresser be like oh i don't know how i don't know how you can not drink and you know whenever i get stress out i'm like i have to have a drink and i couldn't cope without like a spliff or a drink and maybe you should start smoke marijuana again and i'm like well you know
S0540	there we go the hairdresser
S0540	i mean that i would not like the even take a pinch you of that what it yeah i mean it just it's it's
S0540	i mean that's just you know off an off a magazine that's not a a down to earth kind of advice it's unreal
S0541	no but i
S0540	unreal
S0541	but i i know but it's it be real cos it's what most people do so
S0540	no of course i don't i don't think most people do that
S0541	a lot of people do it
S0540	well yeah
S0541	a lot of people do it and it's good for stress relief you know it's stress relief isn't it cos it's just escapism so
S0540	you mean alcohol
S0541	yeah like any kind of substance you know mind alter
S0540	apparently women be er twice as much twice more likely to erm get depression than men but men be twice more likely to be alcoholic
S0541	oh
S0540	no so that's mean that you know women perhaps be more open to to admit they're depress as men just hide
S0541	get drink
S0540	and er resort to drink
S0541	yeah
S0540	so
S0541	yeah i mean you know i dunno the last thing i want be kind of like the last thing i want be to get drink i mean i just don't see it as a solution
S0540	yeah you don't wanna go there again it's like
S0541	it's not a solution be it it's not gonna make me feel better
S0540	you overcome what's the point of go back
S0541	yeah that's what i think
S0540	mm that's so defeatist yeah
S0541	that's what i think and even then i even i think oh maybe you know like maybe well it's more cos he say you know i can get you some weed and i be like oh do i want that and then i kind of and er for a minute i think maybe and then i think actually i've work so hard to not have any erm
S0540	yeah
S0540	substance abuse
S0541	addictions
S0541	i the only addiction i have now be coffee and chew gum there's my
S0540	er and you know
S0541	two addictions
S0540	that's really
