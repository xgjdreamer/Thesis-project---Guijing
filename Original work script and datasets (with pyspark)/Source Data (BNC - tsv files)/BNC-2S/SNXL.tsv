S0282	so anyway erm so what i'm hop be that an extra you will and use erm well not only from but from other place and in other contexts if you be advise oh well so let's say and and and from
S0289	mm
S0282	what what would you say be key things to be learn in set up and run an initiative of this kind
S0289	mm well i'll tell you what my start point be
S0282	mm
S0289	one be know what you want to achieve and why
S0282	mm
S0289	so you have a perfectly good i think that you and i have never write this plan before
S0282	no
S0289	but we write a version of what a business plan then i think be now i look back on it it be pretty good
S0282	mm
S0289	because we really test the water on everything and make sure if things could have that on the income after it be do
S0282	yeah
S0289	and what we do that be what be important be that we didn't start from the fact that we need money we start from the fact although undoubtedly we do we start to say how could this be a manageable and workable build
S0282	mm
S0289	that enough local people would want to use that it could actually we can actually say that it would be use we've do our work
S0282	yeah
S0289	and they would produce enough income to make it run because what be there before be a build with high aspirations and no way write all down would've ever pay for itself
S0282	no
S0289	they set it up
S0282	and it didn't
S0289	and it didn't
S0282	yeah
S0289	so i think that research we do do you remember what we do the er draft business plan we put in i think we even have a photo of every space that be leave there
S0282	yeah
S0289	we give page and under each one we miss it the local people who'd make inquiries to us about use enough space
S0282	mm
S0289	and that show and we have three or four under some of them some of them around by the time we finish the work
S0282	no
S0289	but then we be always one step forward say we want to have a look at it
S0282	yeah
S0289	and we could then check out that each of those that the bigger users be go to be viable
S0282	yeah
S0289	and could actually pay us the kind of rent it need to keep the build run
S0282	well yeah
S0289	so that be a really really good first stage analysis of local need and demand
S0282	yeah
S0289	and check that that could be add together to make a sustainable business plan so i remember our first projections of budget people like them those businessmen that come on board with us they would look at the whole business plan that they always start on the cash flow page even if it be the back page they'd start at the back because they would work back from that to know if we'd do our proper homework
S0282	yeah
S0289	which as it turn out we have
S0282	yeah
S0289	and so i think that that be the absolutely crucial first step we could've say our aim be to get enough money to keep the build go but that be that's a by product of have a well run build
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm and from be manageable we be tell that we didn't need a seven star
S0282	i know
S0289	we structure it so that we could do it on one and a half
S0282	yeah
S0289	or one and three quarter cos we do end up with a some of the time
S0282	yeah
S0289	but we have a half time admin a full time manager and eventually some box office but the box office be actually pay for by our tenant
S0282	mm
S0289	primarily because they be the ones who need people to in and get a box office
S0282	yeah
S0289	so we actually minimise the things we that be cost the most money which be and you have the doors and things and everything out in the build put such a way that you could let full time in some space and occasionally on others and others you would rent it out the entire space
S0282	mm
S0289	erm and you know that that audit be the first thing that
S0282	mm
S0289	check that the space be really need and want
S0282	mm
S0289	and that people who be need and want it i remember i be talk about the fact that we would have to check that each one of those be viable and a lot of them we do i know
S0282	yeah
S0289	i know when they come in you know erm the restaurant be viable
S0282	it be
S0289	erm and they have put together their plan properly and we could see it be but the cinema wasn't
S0282	oh be that what happen i never work out what happen to the cinema
S0289	what happen to the cinema be two one the cost of construction of the cinema be victoriously high because er erm the safety factor that you have to build in have never be update from when the only cinema happen all over the country and they be work with
S0282	oh it's just very flammable
S0289	and it be highly flammable so you have to all kind of protect that stuff when we could've spend our entire budget on turn that main room the conference room
S0282	yeah that actually
S0289	no it wouldn't we we
S0282	no
S0289	couldn't have do it it would've cost too much
S0282	mm
S0289	to do it structurally
S0282	mm
S0289	and the insurance would've be er the
S0282	yeah
S0289	as well and it be a silly thing to do you have to prove your case when you've get to across the road the business case be just not there
S0282	no
S0289	and it be when i don't know how you whether you i remember have a long conversation to about this cos i be be call racist because we weren't go to have the black cinema in because it wasn't viable and i say to be i be racist and he say er no you're just look at my business plan and say it won't cut together and we never mention black in it and half of the others that be gonna come in load of them be black and they present
S0282	mm
S0289	a case so
S0282	mm
S0289	it's get nothing to do with anything
S0282	no
S0289	but you will that be a card that people use if they want to make you flinch
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm so that's like be manipulate by basically be like he's say so that side we we have to check out each of our tenant could really pay
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm i think there be another church write help them look at their plan cos they have something like an after school club come into their church hall and erm their grant from their local authority to pay for the it be gonna be pay for by the local authority the let be gonna be completely cover
S0282	right
S0289	and so i say to the church hall committee whatever you do take the money in advance of their book about three or four years later they come to me say we don't know what to do the arts school club owe us twenty three thousand pound
S0289	because they keep say they're gonna pay their rent but they never do so we leave them in cos we keep hop we'll get it
S0282	oh
S0289	and of course it mean that they would never get it
S0282	yeah
S0289	so no you can't go there erm
S0282	aha
S0289	i don't of course they never do get it
S0282	yeah
S0289	what happen be the after school club spend their grant on all kinds of maths stuff
S0282	yeah
S0289	and not on pay the rent cos they're still in
S0282	yeah there the there's the worse group as well which i can't brave when you get so far stick into something you can't pull out because erm you've already invest so much that
S0289	mm
S0282	actually cut off and lose your investment
S0289	mm
S0282	that's so prohibit
S0289	mm
S0282	that you just carry on and that's what we do with cos that
S0289	completely
S0282	you just get to the point where you think if you sell them out you'll never see that money again
S0289	well one of the lessons if i be gonna look at it i wasn't involve in the board at that point but do you remember in the early days we have a set of point of about sixty percent let
S0282	mm
S0289	fifty three percent maybe
S0282	mm
S0289	if we be sixty three percent let we would er cover all our cost
S0282	yeah
S0289	we never want to be a hundred we never want it to we have to have it all let
S0282	mm
S0289	and then we say we would never allow a single tenant to have more than i think it be about sixty percent of the build
S0282	yeah
S0289	if we'd have forty percent come in from one tenant it would've make a lot of difference but do get about ninety percent
S0282	yeah
S0289	of the build
S0282	yeah
S0289	and that that break a rule we start with
S0282	i know it's actually in it's actually not
S0289	mm
S0282	so erm
S0289	and that i don't know where it come from but it be
S0282	and that be too many egg in one basket
S0289	it be it be a piece of wisdom we have in the early days so we should've stick to it
S0282	and we lose it yeah
S0289	mm
S0282	and actually it be we have to close that space and nobody's come forward and we have we be owe
S0289	i wonder what happen
S0282	oh hang on a second get introduce by didn't he by the
S0289	yeah
S0282	erm by the full proof base and then because we get ourselves into the same issue again
S0289	mm
S0282	er
S0289	mm
S0282	erm be stand there look like an angel well who be go to rescue us and give us all this money and be step there and then and start pay from tomorrow and we think do we do today or do we do tomorrow and we think let's do today cos you know tomorrow might not be tomorrow it might be next week next month next year erm and because we get ourselves into a mess again we just jump up and
S0289	so those be all that we have at the begin
S0282	yeah
S0289	if we'd stick to them we could've make
S0282	yeah
S0289	the years much more comfortable
S0282	yeah because that be the point at which he start think that that he should be turn to do not vice versa
S0289	and erm the main thing be at a default by one tenant
S0282	yes
S0289	it the entire project
S0282	yeah well he start
S0289	have he
S0282	he start to us he write to me i i i'm pay for all of this and therefore i should have the right to say how it go at it that it's never be tangible
S0289	i hear that before
S0282	so erm the
S0289	we set we set some interest principles there that we should've to
S0282	mm and would you say that you have manage to persuade all the other organisations at you've work with to take that kind of approach and they have be reluctant
S0289	no
S0282	what happen that they wouldn't
S0289	i haven't manage to persuade them because they all get into that moment like the enthusiastic term he say i can do this and they tend to believe him
S0282	mm
S0289	they don't actually do the thorough
S0282	actually it be true that i i don't know
S0289	no but
S0282	like an old because no no no too good to be true and it couldn't come off that's not right that's not true somebody's just turn up to him and say we're run an employment project erm it need to start in april they'll be pay the whole the whole year in advance in november probably space so they could hold it for them till november till they get their money and i'm so i tell him you know what that's not true he say no no she say it to me i say no er you'll find i think that that's not true oh no no no she's no she's very convince but i'm sorry but i'll go for what
S0289	it's the second statement of the year and the fact the best thing you can do be and they turn up with the money and they've get all the right reference from their bank then we'll consider them
S0282	mm
S0289	but to start consider them
S0282	mm
S0289	go by the board when you get a hundred pressure situations
S0282	yeah
S0289	it's easy to panic and go with something the other thing i find the church do be they've get a very enthusiastic champion of the project often the picker who have see other things succeed
S0282	mm
S0289	and be sure he can do it as well
S0282	mm
S0289	i use he on purpose he can do it as well erm actually he have no train and no skills to do that kind of consideration that we be look at
S0282	right
S0289	but he lead them into chaos
S0282	mm
S0289	or actually i know one moment he's do it too erm adapt the whole church or project that by the time the church open didn't exist but nor be there any replacements
S0282	no
S0289	like we have a list of people that we better properly before we allow a commitment erm it be a special need group that a large proportion of the space i would say about twenty percent of the build space be adapt for their special need
S0282	mm
S0289	and by the time the build have be do they have go to the wind and so they get a special need work area
S0282	i know about that
S0289	erm that there be no tenant for because
S0282	yeah
S0289	there's no one else that's kind
S0282	yeah
S0289	it's a bite like at the we nearly get we have someone try to convince us to install child size toilets so they could run a nursery in the crypt
S0282	oh no
S0289	do you remember
S0282	yeah
S0289	and we go into the business plan to er actually they get them from somewhere they get some they want to have fit when we fit the place up and we actually do the standard procedure at that time come back to us with your business plan and show us how you're gonna pay us this money they disappear
S0282	mm
S0289	so ask people to come with their business plan and their reference from their bank a letter say they have the
S0282	mm
S0289	be important
S0282	i think what we've do this time as well be we look at the status of their vacate and think these be derelict and nobody's gonna want them but how on earth can we do the math so we go in very defensively say oh do pretty crap but you know whatever and then we discover that actually most businesses fully recognise when they come in for a property
S0289	mm
S0282	they will do it up they will design it for themselves but they're erm
S0289	mm
S0289	mm
S0282	so actually they they can come in you know some come in and it will look like the worst pile of of of
S0289	of trash yeah
S0282	of trash you've ever see in your whole life
S0289	but they never use that bar anyway
S0282	and then they would never yeah
S0289	never
S0282	they gonna strip out the whole place out get to get it back to the to the
S0289	but do you remember we we install the bar in the crypt it cost us a thousand pound a metre
S0282	oh yes of course yes of course
S0289	and as soon as we get tenant they take it out
S0282	yeah
S0289	it then end up in the other end of the crypt for a while and then it move upstairs for a while and it be trash
S0282	yeah
S0289	and it cost that much cos the wall didn't fit it
S0282	yeah
S0289	it have to go down the bar
S0282	yeah
S0289	but there be no need for us to do that
S0282	no
S0289	cos once we get the restaurant in they want to design their own kitchen and
S0282	yeah
S0289	and everything else
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm so no fit out be not what you need to do
S0282	no
S0289	cos they'll put their own colour paint on the wall
S0282	yeah and even the school come in and come in with that kind of paint
S0289	mm
S0282	and paint this and once they paint it white it look utterly different completely transform
S0289	mm
S0282	that's all it all it need be to remove the wall back erm the the control room need a bite more work because there be i mean half of the we really don't know give what we find in there afterwards but all the electric etcetera they've be go on there
S0289	yeah
S0282	but erm so that you know that have to be sort of seriously strip out but erm strip out be the least of it really
S0289	yeah yeah
S0282	and in erm this erm they're not suppose that the lot in can can actually think about how it's gonna be pay for day to day and who's gonna
S0289	and part of it
S0282	carry on pay the rent
S0289	because she know of that be try to produce bigger things but they're not base on i don't know where he's get his project cost from in term of utilities
S0282	no
S0289	and things like that
S0282	mm
S0289	or erm i think what he do be calculate the cost and then say i need this much income
S0282	right
S0289	but that
S0282	he's very interest in our
S0289	he's
S0282	figure
S0289	good what he he understand and certainly
S0282	yeah
S0289	know that
S0282	yeah
S0289	so i do think that you look back and you realise from the begin i do the model for it actually which be really funny cos i wasn't into figure that much i be do my master in management at the time so i begin to understand it a little bite erm the very first cash flow projections we produce first of all on an annual basis in our budget in our business plan but as soon as we get nearer to run we do it on a monthly basis
S0282	yeah
S0289	and we could tell when the bigger bill be gonna come in in the whole lot
S0282	yeah
S0289	so we always know where we be the one thing that
S0282	we fill in our book on that basis to this day actually
S0289	and it's it would
S0282	what your annual account look be er be one thing but if you've get three months in the middle you have no money and you have load of creditors then you're gonna go down
S0289	yeah you be you be and so i try i've tell people that at endless train events
S0282	mm
S0289	some of them you will always find someone in the attend who's work in business enough to know why you're say it
S0282	mm
S0289	but a lot of people don't have a clue why i've say it
S0282	no
S0289	it's a a wing and a prayer for them erm
S0282	and to this day we don't have an overdraft
S0289	right good you don't need one
S0282	no i know but you know
S0289	it's a pain if you have one cos then it start yeah
S0282	yeah well that's just er yeah that's because they er
S0289	erm so i think i think all of that be that cash flow projection i remember all the board meet i be in where that be er that be what control everything we do
S0282	yeah
S0289	and it should
S0282	yeah it do now make my
S0289	the one thing i think we didn't do we probably never get in front enough but some place can i do their business plan oh and they're they be follow it two years later and they be do incredibly well
S0282	that's good that be good
S0289	erm what you need be to put into the bank enough money to hold you over when there be void
S0282	yeah
S0289	because in a build that's total you i mean you heat the whole thing or none of it
S0282	mm
S0289	that's what i mean by it's er it's a single unit in one sense although it's break up
S0282	yeah
S0289	you're still gonna have to pay the heat bill whether the people be in or not
S0282	yeah
S0289	er whether the big space be fill or not
S0282	no
S0289	all the little people still need their heat
S0282	yeah
S0289	so you still need to have money in the bank to cover the average length of the void
S0282	yeah
S0289	which could be six months or something
S0282	oh it can easily be six months by the time you
S0289	yeah
S0289	mm
S0282	i mean and we erm we do the maths recently and work out that if we weren't there and only the congregation be there it would still cost thirty six thousand pound a year to run the build
S0289	mm just to keep it open
S0282	yeah and that's without anybody actually be in any other part of the build apart from the church space
S0289	mm
S0282	because you would still need to insure the whole thing
S0289	mm
S0282	and although erm our friend from think that perhaps the insurance on a church as part of the build might be cheaper than the insurance on the rest of it so why can't they have a discount on their
S0289	the fact be it's er
S0282	contribution towards the insurance though it's not true actually the whole build you know the whole build be insure as a whole
S0289	mm
S0282	not er space by space by space likewise electricity bill likewise erm lightning rod maintenance gas certificate electric certificate water certificate blah blah blah blah
S0289	mm
S0282	then you add up a thousand here two thousand there
S0289	yeah
S0282	five thousand here twenty thousand for insurance whatever
S0289	yeah oh absolutely
S0282	get up to thirty six without blink
S0289	completely
S0282	and so when erm people like think do you know what we'll take it back and we'll run it ourselves they don't reckon on the fact that to stand still they have to raise thirty six thousand
S0289	yeah
S0282	to stand still
S0289	mm absolutely and i do think that be that in a sense summarise what we get right we do do all that work on run the build
S0282	mm
S0289	before we get into detail on design the build
S0282	yeah
S0289	we make it manageable first
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm and test out the management plan quite well which be manage and business plan in one before we then start say okay how would we now adapt the build cos we have to alter all kinds of
S0282	mm
S0289	stuff on the different level how the access it and the church space that they want to keep
S0282	yeah
S0289	which be actually a foyer
S0282	yeah
S0289	have to be cut off from the staircase
S0282	yeah
S0289	otherwise they be simply a throughway
S0282	yeah
S0289	but each space have to be individually manageable because we need to make it viable financially we do need to do one off let of an even or a weekend we need to do the majority of the build in permanent rent
S0282	yeah
S0289	and so get all that manageability right then we could say to the architect we need to redo the build to to do this manage structure
S0282	mm
S0289	to make this work erm and he he do
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm but that's the right way round
S0282	yeah
S0289	and he and er the architect and the quantity surveyor give us a sum of what they think they could do that for all modestly that would make the build manageable
S0282	yeah
S0289	and we didn't get any detail design do until we get the work we get the money do
S0282	yeah
S0289	so we figure well okay that's the minimum we will now go and look for where we could find that kind of money
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm and there be potential for that
S0282	and then but i guess how many what percentage of people would you say start with an architect
S0289	ninety eight percent
S0289	i haven't have any response
S0282	yeah
S0289	from at since i send him an e mail say i be work on the hlf form by the way be the architect appoint by competitive tender because the hlf would require that
S0282	mm
S0289	he's never answer because i think the way the diocese operate be an old boy type structure
S0282	i wouldn't be surprise
S0289	somebody in the diocese tell him this would be a good architect this would be a good project manager
S0282	yeah
S0289	and he's never they've never look at other people
S0282	no
S0289	and i think that he's probably sit there cos the kind of question i've ask him be ones he's never clever guy
S0282	yeah
S0289	who know a huge amount about quite a lot
S0282	yeah
S0289	but he's in his comfort zone actually even though he determine the project will happen but er there's no one he's deal with so he's give me no more contact where's that where's that grant thing he have to go to the local authority for community right to bill
S0282	oh yes
S0289	it become clear i fill in a form and send it through to him that he need to find out what the local authority be do with the community right to bill cos they have to endorse
S0282	mm
S0289	his bid
S0282	mm
S0289	and he can't act as someone in the council and basically they say to him oh no no no for goodness sake don't get us involve in that it's a nightmare
S0282	mm
S0289	so he me that response but what's he do with it
S0282	yeah
S0289	that have to be take up locally and the council do need to be involve with it
S0282	yeah absolutely
S0289	but erm they're very much on the route of start with the architect
S0282	yeah
S0289	like a nice community centre here and i'm absolutely all
S0282	they've do a fantastic draw
S0289	all
S0282	draw
S0289	all round the house they pay a huge amount of money to be architects over then he be like
S0282	but when
S0289	you know he be like but we must be able to get money from the big lottery they do community fund raise i say yes they do
S0282	no
S0289	but us they will only pay up to sixty percent of the due bill community hall next month the cost of the build be half a million
S0282	yeah
S0289	so he say well we we could work within that and that could be part of our sunday i say the big lottery doesn't work like that it have to be it
S0282	no yeah
S0289	it have to be the biggest funder so that they can control how you do it
S0282	yeah
S0289	they they don't play ball with what you want they'll never be a part or minor funder and in any case if they be just about one of the biggest where be you gonna get the other two and a half millions from in order to take up theirs so he say
S0282	well that's another four four funders isn't it er er
S0289	yeah and they're there but then
S0282	how could they nah
S0289	erm erm i have give him the right things which he should revisit their aim and that stuff but i think he's in that thing that you be talk about he get so down so far down the path that he spend so much money on it
S0282	yeah
S0289	that you can't back track and say let's start the design again
S0282	no
S0289	he theoretically have say to me well if we can't raise the money why don't we look at the design and go for something more modest we could go for a single storey for that and i'm fine i think he might be need to do that and if he doesn't hear back cos
S0282	no
S0289	he might not i think the the business part i think it's have potential
S0282	yeah
S0289	and one nearer and nearer but he won't do it without he won't get the gas work section do in six without the council feel they're achieve it
S0282	yeah
S0289	so it's it's it's work with the council work with business leaders so that they do a it's exactly like exactly
S0282	yeah
S0289	exactly like but far more money
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm but be that relationship which
S0282	but actually what's dangerous what's worry about it be the build be so much smaller i doubt that you can have more than one thing happen in there at a time one or two things happen in there at at a time and that mean that those things have get to
S0289	well that mean essentially café
S0282	yeah
S0289	on the plan but they don't know what kind of café
S0282	no
S0289	erm like i say all it what would excel er what kind of food be it like the restaurant or will you just be take their customers from it
S0282	in which case immediate drop from your local business community
S0289	yeah or and he say well it might be healthy eat and i say be there a market inside doors that have a healthy eat café and he doesn't know
S0282	no
S0289	no that's not where we be with the we have test all those things out and i think to go fundraise for them you actually have to ask for those things to be test out
S0282	yeah
S0289	and then the design will only valid in the context that but he's already start ask that architect to take the design forward to the next stage
S0282	mm
S0289	which be i'm think still that he should still be in the let's think about whether this
S0282	yeah
S0289	be the community audit which be entirely miss from there which be
S0282	yeah
S0289	that give the right business
S0282	yeah
S0289	to the business plan
S0282	what happen if you build it they will come it's so they
S0289	it won't
S0282	cos boat
S0289	mm
S0282	it could be peaceful and and you know on the day they're open people will flock towards it and they'd take it to their hearts and immediately become utterly well use by everybody who'd be queue up to
S0289	just occasionally that happen
S0282	yeah
S0289	but only by luck chance you find the right local budget but i'm not convince they find the right local budget you know
S0282	no
S0289	a lot of the project they want in there be probably entirely the right ones
S0282	yeah
S0289	but they need to go and see the project that's why i say to them well how be you gonna run these things how be we gonna know we'll have organisation come in and pay for the space
S0282	that's sensible
S0289	well who be they
S0282	yeah
S0289	where's their letter say they want this space
S0282	yeah
S0289	and tell you how many people they're gonna have and where and how
S0282	yeah and how much they're gonna pay or how much they can afford to pay you actually that
S0289	yeah or if one council cos that's a great local need erm do you need the seven that be on your plan tell me how you're gonna schedule the time er be the demand and all the time or do you actually need three room because over a day they'll all get use up whereas seven
S0282	yeah
S0289	will only be use at peak time do you just need to move your
S0282	yeah
S0289	and again it's the kind of things which look at things like you know he go glaze
S0282	yeah
S0289	cos he doesn't know how to think of it and that kind of develop the detail
S0282	yeah
S0289	but you have to
S0282	i know you have to i mean
S0282	yeah
S0289	give me years ago that i still use which be when you look at design and space you gonna start brief an architect if you know you get a group come in that's go to use your hall once a week or
S0282	mm
S0289	three time a week what be the average attendance
S0282	mm
S0289	and what be the maximum attendance
S0282	mm
S0289	occasional
S0282	yeah
S0289	well when i be a vicar i have a hall below the church that be use by a pensioner project probably twice or three time a year they have three hundred people in
S0282	mm
S0289	they be allow only because they have so many doors to be outside there wasn't really much internal space really three hundred but it's no good design the space for those three hundred when actually most days they only have twenty five
S0282	yeah
S0289	you need to do space to be able to work mostly for twenty five with
S0282	yeah
S0289	the occasional squash
S0282	yeah
S0289	so church then say oh we have four hundred people sometimes well actually it's once a year
S0282	yeah cos yeah
S0289	and alright remembrance day
S0282	oh
S0289	cos you
S0282	oh right
S0289	so all the army service be orient so everyone turn up so you don't design anything to service four hundred people or
S0282	no
S0289	when the four hundred people be there you design for what you normally have
S0282	mm
S0289	and you know the church on that same basis would say to me we've get to have a kitchen we've get to be able to cook here
S0282	oh
S0289	and then it turn out when you er that eighty thousand pound be suppose to have servery for about fifteen thousand
S0282	yeah
S0289	servery be a sink and dishwasher cutlery and that kind of stuff
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm
S0282	and a fridge
S0289	and a fridge yeah fridge dishwasher sink erm and then you say to them well when be you actually go to cook and it turn out it
S0282	mm
S0289	well do you want to pay eighty five thousand pound for a kitchen that get use once a year or do you order fish and chip service
S0282	yeah
S0289	or do you do something well we don't like carry food in well eighty five thousand be a lot of money
S0282	yeah
S0289	you could buy caterers a lot of time over
S0282	yeah
S0289	with that money
S0282	for that
S0289	yeah exactly so i tend to
S0282	well yeah sorry yeah
S0289	push hard to get the money use
S0282	yeah
S0289	to construct a servery but once they've get it it's always enough
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm there be one church i've be work with that erm have determine they have to have a kitchen because they want to have a project for the homeless
S0282	yup
S0289	er serve lunch every day
S0282	mm
S0289	every weekday
S0282	mm
S0289	er at you know community rate and so i know they press the number they have a legacy so they've get lot of money which be a dreadful shame and a couple of them be really really really push that they have to have a kitchen to do the cook in so i say i it's not my decision whether you have a kitchen or not but it seem to be an enormous amount of money to spend that you ought to justify to yourself
S0282	mm
S0289	oh but it's our mission so i say that's fine i think you need to do several things one of them be go to all the homeless project in the town and check out with each of them if there be a gap between demand and
S0282	yeah
S0289	supply
S0282	yeah
S0289	in other word er do you really need another homeless project i know you'd like it and you want to be do something
S0282	yeah
S0289	for people who be really poor but be there any really poor who be gonna turn up
S0282	yeah
S0289	be you go to install this kitchen and finally you get one or two people once a week and they they wouldn't do it they wouldn't do it they do never do the homework erm two of the people on the group very much want to the vicar wouldn't back them even though he know what'd be say be totally sensible cos his wife be one of the others who be we've get to have a mission to the homeless people
S0282	ah
S0289	and along with another person who i can't a bite mad erm
S0282	you haven't say enough to me who know who these people they could be anywhere in england
S0289	they could be anywhere in england that's
S0282	or even out of england
S0289	they could be out of england couldn't they erm but anyway because they get their own money they go on and have a kitchen both
S0282	mm
S0289	be build at the moment and it be it's a bite of foolishness because they've only get about twenty five or thirty people in the church they've get a number of pensioners who use be use it all voluntarily and it it just to keep the church go
S0282	yeah
S0289	who be not interest in turn up to make lunch every day
S0282	no
S0289	and they've not talk about how they're gonna get the money for the food and the ingredients and who's gonna be the manager and do the shop and all that it's all pie in the sky
S0282	mm
S0289	and they expect eighty thousand more than they need to to
S0282	yeah
S0289	have a servery
S0282	yeah
S0289	so
S0282	and actually they're
S0289	well that's
S0282	because actually do that with volunteer
S0289	you can't do it
S0282	you can't do it
S0289	in charge of the safety of the volunteer you need an expert in
S0282	yeah
S0289	control homeless people
S0282	yeah
S0289	so again it's a kind of thing that where be your market
S0282	yeah
S0289	how be you gonna serve your market how be it manageable
S0282	yeah
S0289	be it really there and i don't think there be one for them i never saw
S0282	no
S0289	a single single homeless person malinger around the church where i be go quite a lot of period of time
S0282	yeah
S0289	well that be an issue i think you would've see quite a lot
S0282	yeah
S0289	i'm sure if you be there all the time you see some
S0282	but then you've get to be careful as well because i mean round you know it's around that build you know there be a guy lie on the grass in the church yard have have a whole thing full of probably and be as they go up tenant and ask him if he be alright to see if he be dead or alive turn up he be alive but he claim the case and stuff like that erm what and you get a lot of in the church yard but you've get you've also then you've get to have something you to say couldn't do there's no point in you open the doors in your inner and let six heroin addict walk in and sit down i mean people complain to people you know there's be a chair of trustees plus the manager who couldn't tell because they have homeless people on their premise and they didn't stop them take drug
S0289	mm
S0282	and they weren't allow them to take drug and they weren't encourage them to take drug but they weren't actually
S0289	they turn a blind eye
S0282	them to take some drug and they both go to jail and i say and people go ho ho ho exaggeration you think er no you you know this be a every time er let somebody in to use the toilet or to have a cup of tea they still
S0289	mm
S0282	fortunately the you know theft cause by someone be an idiot so he actually get his money back the cos he sort of run and leave something in the toilet and didn't come back and check for a while erm you know and fortunately but other pocket
S0289	yeah
S0282	but you know but er you know they do let people in premise to get a cup of tea or whatever but you can't have somebody there you and you cannot leave a bunch of volunteer to supervise people who've get fundamental issue like heroin addiction and they're on the street
S0289	yeah
S0282	or they're take drug out in the open and then fall coma you know where they
S0289	and be your step
S0282	yeah
S0289	with their hepatitis and their aid and all the other things they're carry in their blood and
S0282	yeah
S0289	then the old ladies come to church and don't understand why it matter
S0282	yeah
S0289	yeah it's it's all of that stuff that people need to understand
S0282	and also how they're go to pay for example i mean this be a thing that what we have to we have to talk over and over again haven't we you've get to have or you can you've get to have some clients or some tenant who've get the money to pay something because you can't accept er quid pro quo you can't accept everybody's pay even people that you suspect and think to pay more and try and drive down to ludicrous level
S0289	what do you think about a group that have twenty five adults in it
S0282	mm
S0289	those people be probably spend five pound a day on alcohol and five pound a day on cigarettes
S0282	mm
S0289	and let alone the drug that be around various kinds so those people if they go to their pubs for their even out would spend the minimum ten or fifteen pound
S0282	mm
S0289	so when they come to do an activity in your build they can afford to spend ten or fifteen pound on the activity
S0282	yeah
S0289	per person
S0282	yeah
S0289	and so multiple that by your twenty five people and you've get quite a lot of money
S0282	yeah
S0289	and they still have a mindset of you've get to do things really cheap or give them away if you're a church
S0282	yeah yeah
S0289	and that's not true
S0282	no
S0289	you've get to be able to make the hard decisions
S0282	mm
S0289	erm some people some church i work with will understand that
S0282	yeah well if i could if i have quick turn up to me and say erm how can you or i think you be suppose to be a charity
S0289	mm
S0282	and then i have this man who come and see me who who argue that i couldn't really be a charity because we be all all earn our own money and charities don't earn money which must mean that we're project we must be a private company we can't be a charity because we're earn our own money that's to say erm but then you've get to set a
S0289	no
S0282	church er no i don't think so oh yes yes yes yes if you're earn money you've get to set a church
S0289	you're not trade if you're let space
S0282	no and then and then other people come to me and say well you know of course it's not a charity how can you be a charity charitable to you actually
S0289	do you remember who be set up the structure for i be absolutely determine i don't know how many of this be true i just think it's common sense i've be around the church but we we need to have a group who be guide officer body
S0282	yeah
S0289	that would make the hard decisions like if someone's not pay the rent we throw them out
S0282	yeah
S0289	because all of those people depend on come to some kind who can't bear to have a bad name in the community and so if you be really christian you wouldn't let me off
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm what's christian about let you off what you commit yourself to pay if you be a christian you'd pay what you agree
S0282	yeah
S0289	you'd keep to your contract
S0282	mm
S0289	if you didn't like the rent when you start why didn't you talk to us about it then
S0282	mm
S0289	but we've make a commitment to switch the heat on because you'd say you'd pay your rent erm and you've use that heat erm so where's where's a christian issue from our point of view because we'll let you off
S0282	yeah
S0289	when you haven't keep your commitment you know all that stuff but you know that's why when we i say we must have a group run it structure so that they could make the hard decisions i say people with teeth
S0282	mm
S0289	they're crocodiles
S0282	yeah
S0289	people with teeth who could bite the bullet and say i'm sorry no
S0282	yeah
S0289	and it didn't come back the vicar be suppose to be the nice guy and try to be both side at the same time
S0282	yeah
S0289	so you have to have a final decision make by someone who hasn't whose job wasn't about be
S0282	but that's really difficult i mean i still i get feed up of someone look at me and think you know what you're a
S0289	mm
S0282	and they're the ones who be on the board and you're actually think terribly where i by the fact that somebody's not pay us
S0289	at least in the begin at least it's it's one of the difficulties be both members be to change over the years and their reason for join might be various
S0282	mm
S0289	but you need the right mix
S0282	mm
S0289	and at the begin we certainly do get enough people but we to make sure they understand the business of what
S0282	yeah
S0289	we're try to do
S0282	yeah
S0289	but if the business of what we're try to do fail then the whole build fail and
S0282	yeah
S0289	the church would be go as well
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm
S0282	well actually what be quite interest there be somebody as well it's we be try to do various things and move on and do extra and erm the council for example want to know about the board
S0289	aha
S0282	and want to know how many of us be residents and how many of us be from different ethnic group and our age and our gender and stuff like that erm they're and they be interest that should should a particular demographic profile or whatever especially live in without reference to the fact that can we run can we run a business within us you know all we're say be that we want to run an asset and they're not ask us about what our businesses group be and who we've get on the board they're interest in how erm in how many people i've get or how many people i've get who be disable or whatever and they've sort of be actually it be difficult cos we've never and to kind of quantify our social value i mean we've never have to do that before because we've never have a grant we've never go down that route we've never be so useful so i mean to say well you know we've get to wash our face we've get to know this we've always get to earn more than we spend because otherwise the
S0282	yeah
S0289	mm i do think that that er that er i've try to stay out of that game on
S0282	mm
S0289	and i try to teach church for example again we be do it when we set up we would not have a board that be make up of representatives of the group
S0282	mm
S0289	because they've do that before and it fail because each of the
S0282	yeah
S0289	have the best in interest to not allow
S0282	yeah
S0289	the rent to be realistic cos
S0282	yeah
S0289	they want to pay less
S0282	yeah
S0289	you've get to have a board that do it on the basis of the umbrella
S0282	yeah
S0289	build
S0282	yeah
S0289	and to keep it viable
S0282	yeah
S0289	that's the sole basis for your field and that include co opt people for their skills
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm in fact you could just play a funny game with number you only have two number at the collective
S0282	mm
S0289	of the diocese of
S0282	mm
S0289	the rest of you be co opt members
S0282	mm
S0289	but you're co opt for your skills
S0282	mm
S0289	er which be fundamentally the structure we start with
S0282	yeah oh say to me the other day he say to us oh
S0289	we're not office we be
S0282	and i sort of say
S0282	oh no you can just carry on and no oh so it's obviously there's obviously something behind the question
S0289	well he he
S0282	but yeah
S0289	structure the only one he know be the broker church council structure
S0282	mm
S0289	which should be rubbish for run this kind of thing and
S0282	mm
S0289	i'm try to explain that to people that if you stay in the under the pcc certain amount as a subcommittee of the pcc with its own term of reference that allow you
S0282	yeah
S0289	not to be re elect every year that allow you to with skills and so on because it's the only way you could stay you cannot have new trustees once a year and expect
S0282	mm
S0289	to continue to make good decisions about
S0282	mm
S0289	that have to be base on be financially viable
S0282	yeah it's be quite difficult with some of those people the board anyway
S0289	i know
S0282	get what do you think and they say oh no how could we come up with that solution oh it's him oh him again him again with his decision make erm
S0289	but it it be that be exactly why we set up that complicate thing at the begin that erm mean that there be two share in the company
S0282	mm
S0289	because we know that the pcc be unreliable
S0282	yeah
S0289	and in a sense we couldn't trust the dioceses er to not pull the programme down because they get feed up with the hassle
S0282	yeah
S0289	cos it be hassle
S0282	mm
S0289	be a major nightmare they would've love to have be out of it but they do because it be and the public image they would've get to have
S0282	yeah
S0289	close the major church in
S0282	yeah
S0289	etcetera so if you give each of them a share neither of them could the other they have to agree on the way forward and i think that in the basis of our business plan and have a council of trustees who be make the hard decisions that the dioceses for the future would back it
S0282	mm
S0289	cos at the moment the dioceses from that structure point of view be more reliable than the parish
S0282	yeah
S0289	but there could come a point in the future when the diocese say we actually think we're gonna take this build over we've get the right to we're gonna turn it into the diocese's office
S0282	yeah
S0289	and er that would be a good idea er the pcc could say no
S0282	well i mean if that would be fine if they want to if they want to do that unless they you know preserve the build
S0289	yeah for the people in
S0282	yeah and
S0289	actual interpretation and
S0282	yeah
S0289	they would be a good tenant but they can come from in fact they would never do it because the staff wouldn't go to work in
S0282	they might just change it but and actually what be er what be extraordinary be that the two businesses be two keep businesses now their client group be really posh white young people
S0289	oh really
S0282	yeah you know
S0289	cos then have to do it for my when i do my master erm in turn of what make this a a successful redevelopment
S0282	mm
S0289	you know on the regeneration bite how what kind be there place you can't be generate
S0282	yeah
S0289	and that which ones be really susceptible to regeneration
S0282	yeah
S0289	where fit the susceptible to regeneration because it have a mixture of social group social class
S0282	mm
S0289	success in the past
S0282	mm
S0289	but ones that don't work be the things like the or
S0282	yeah
S0289	where they'd never be a a viable community
S0282	no
S0289	it's always be a and you replace it with small house that would become hatch for people that have no money to get outside them
S0282	yeah
S0289	and all that stuff if you're gonna have a mix a really mix community of all kinds then erm
S0282	and probably a mix house in that case as well they
S0289	yeah well and er er
S0289	but when they redevelop and erm they actually put in a mixture of house
S0282	mm
S0289	and only a proportion of it be welfare and a a a lot of stark home to buy and plus some big big private so that they would always have a mix there in the future
S0282	yeah yeah
S0289	and it it it be a chance they have a chance to get something start which could last erm it will take a long time to establish but it you know
S0282	yeah
S0289	and 's get it build into its fabric
S0282	yeah
S0289	and there be even when even in its bad days there there be always the artist community and the theatre stuff and all those mad people who use to be do you remember the business plan thing and some of those theatre group who think they could take over and
S0282	oh yeah erm somebody come somebody say to me the other day this bloke come out to where the be and he say oh i use to run this i say oh it who who be that who be that guy who be the one be we gonna do the one in or whatever
S0289	oh no
S0282	and there be some bloke who have a a mad theatre proposal and he be there i don't know he he be sell
S0289	there be a guy and there be a guy who use to come who get very keen on it to find out there be only three of them work together to make it viable he be convince he can manage and do the market someone else would be the director of programme he be really fat and i meet him about six years ago and he be tear and skinny
S0282	be he
S0289	i and there be no way i could ever recognise him he be
S0282	no
S0289	absolutely of another the planet but he get the right name and the right story so it have to be him
S0282	mm
S0289	but he come and say hello to me but they didn't work because of their business plan
S0282	mm
S0289	erm they actually hadn't get the ability to put on enough production to give themselves enough
S0282	yeah
S0289	income and they be totally dependent on well if utility can have the space we can apply to the arts council
S0282	yes
S0289	and get a grant
S0282	oh yeah
S0289	well the arts council do one year grant they're not there's no long term
S0282	no
S0289	in that
S0282	no
S0289	you have to find someone who be fundamentally viable the guy who end up be the guy who could make it commercially viable and then would've set to be the cream on the cake
S0282	yeah yeah
S0289	not the cake
S0282	no
S0289	er and that be something else there we we must've see ten theatres that
S0282	oh i know and actually there be one
S0289	well that's
S0289	the worst most angry that we handle there cos they
S0282	yeah
S0289	we need to do your business plan well he didn't know what a business plan be
S0282	no
S0289	so like uh it'd be really good
S0282	yeah what happen recently with this young man and they really really talk tough that we wouldn't let them have the space and i just say well actually to one line on your own business plan which say we have no money
S0289	well
S0282	as if i'd let you you set it yourself there it be you know you you give that to me
S0289	if we yeah and if we let you in you have to spare your deposit for when you move in
S0282	yeah
S0289	and you pay rent from day one
S0282	yeah and you
S0282	i have no money
S0289	you have no money so
S0282	yeah
S0289	we can't do it because
S0282	yeah
S0289	you can't put the heat on
S0282	yeah absolutely
S0289	you can't put the light on and can you run a theatre with no light and no heat
S0282	these people
S0289	too
S0282	mm
S0282	oh
S0289	colour
S0282	oh these be really really posh white people actually and they be so different because you know they're very entitle
S0289	and you're very ordinary look people how dare you tell posh people like them that they can't have what they want
S0282	yeah yeah they be they be very insistent but erm you know they'd do their survey how many young people in want the theatre and etcetera etcetera so er
S0289	there be some visitor it remind me of when i live in
S0282	aha
S0289	the old would give out ticket to certain kinds of events
S0282	oh yeah
S0289	so local people could go along
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm and there be a an event come along and i for some reason take out the ticket who do i go with you might've be my sister there's a play call the house of albina
S0282	oh yes yes yes er yes erm house of something alba yes
S0289	yeah anyway this little theatre company supposedly be put this on and we get to the theatre where the people there be about ten people in the audience and erm it be absolutely tragic absolutely tragic i don't know how you can make what be otherwise a successful play into anything so dreadful
S0289	and it get to the interval and erm we go to the bar and get ourselves a drink we be the only ones in the bar and i say to the person i be with i really don't know if i can face go back in but i i feel bad for of any audience and the guy behind the bar say well if the last this long nobody else would
S0289	and what it turn out be
S0282	oh my word
S0289	it be one of those typical type of thing cos i know the girl in the play albina alba or whatever her name be her father she convince him to pay
S0282	wow
S0289	for them to have to do their production in
S0282	oh right
S0289	no
S0282	oh
S0282	oh
S0289	in cos wasn't go quite so strongly then and erm have take it on and it never work
S0282	no of course
S0289	cos
S0282	actually that be probably the one who come to try to take the space the other year
S0289	probably be
S0282	and who run a small phone company or company and he be set her up with her own act school
S0289	it could've be easy almost identical if it's not the space but how could a father do it twice i can't imagine
S0282	well he didn't in the end cos he want to rent he want the rent he want period which he wasn't give so
S0289	wow absolutely
S0282	you know it's a vanity project i mean you can pay for it and i don't know how many vanity project might've spend
S0289	well absolutely
S0282	and then with the once it's all over it's a huge disaster after it months you just all walk out of the build and the
S0289	and have pay no money
S0282	and have pay no money after eighteen your eighteen month experiment to our expense so
S0289	i do find that there be on one community premise the church be nearly manipulate into let it happen the group want to move in and they be totally grant fund
S0282	mm
S0289	and they want erm a rent free period in return for have fit the place out and i say to the church why would you let that happen oh they're so nice
S0282	mm
S0289	blah blah blah
S0282	and they set the place out
S0289	well absolutely and i say but it's not their money they haven't not a single penny of the organisation's money have be spend on anything like that that be entirely grant money it's entirely someone else's so it's not their money and they're now out of pocket it's entirely separate
S0282	mm
S0289	cos their granny or somebody do it do you see what i mean so there's absolutely no justification for a rent free period
S0289	it's a silly sentimental
S0282	yeah
S0289	er unthinking
S0282	yeah
S0289	nonsense
S0282	yeah
S0289	absolute nonsense
S0282	but it's also be take by people actually it's also believe
S0289	yeah
S0282	whatever people want to give you when they turn up
S0289	oh absolutely
S0282	and take absolutely a face value and
S0289	yeah
S0282	and think and actually it's take me a long time to work out how people actually just lie to your face
S0289	well yeah they will lie to your face they will particularly tell you exactly what they think you need to hear in order to
S0282	yeah
S0289	push the button
S0282	yeah
S0289	and that be erm a certain ethnic group be more liable to do that than others
S0282	mm
S0289	when in the group
S0282	mm
S0289	erm simply because that's the culture in their where they come from
S0282	mm
S0289	who er i've be mention their name
S0282	turn up we be very much enclose to that kind of give a home to this club and then it well it come off and then then afterwards
S0289	yeah everyone
S0282	but that be ask you know it be like yeah you know all the actresses be really good i know you need to see this and this and
S0289	they promote people cos they can't do the job to department so you give people good reference when you have
S0282	yeah
S0289	so that you can get rid of them
S0282	yeah
S0289	it happen in governments
S0282	mm
S0289	i mean in local governments and all that
S0282	mm
S0289	because it's very difficult to get rid of people on the ground they're incompetent
S0282	yeah mm so what else would you say
S0289	okay so i think that's the first thing be to get your
S0282	yeah
S0289	your sustainability plan right
S0282	mm
S0289	your management your business plan your financial strategy and then all the things like
S0282	just to
S0289	your let rent and everything have to work to that
S0282	yeah
S0289	erm and then you have to test out your potential users
S0282	mm
S0289	if you're go to have anyone there all the time
S0282	mm
S0289	if it just regular lettings then you never let anyone come in until they've pay their fee
S0282	yeah
S0289	or you take a big enough deposit from them that they only get back if they've get all of that stuff you safeguard yourself when you do it
S0282	yeah
S0289	i think the second step be i be just about to tell you because we be have this conversation about formulate what i think by write a comment at the church time
S0282	aha
S0289	say there the second thing i think you do be to mosey around research all the potential source of the kind of capital fund that you need in order to make this happen
S0282	right
S0289	include your own resources
S0282	aha
S0289	so i think once you determine what be actually need and
S0282	yeah
S0289	how much of it and how you could do it in a way that be sustainable
S0282	yeah
S0289	so that's your market research really
S0282	yeah
S0289	or local audit in the charity but it be market research
S0282	yeah
S0289	your second step be to find out where you be go to what be a realistic amount of capital
S0282	yeah
S0289	that you could raise to adapt your build
S0282	yeah
S0289	to change
S0282	yeah
S0289	and that mean read thoroughly through the lottery source
S0282	yeah
S0289	again it be something that the people do need to do so that they understand why i'm say that it's unrealistic
S0282	yeah
S0289	er i like them so much this this circle and i love i love be there but i need to be there more often
S0282	well yeah
S0289	but then
