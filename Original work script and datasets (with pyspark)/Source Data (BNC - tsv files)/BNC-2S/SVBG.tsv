S0132	what should we start talk about
S0035	i don't know it's funny we've get lot to talk about
S0132	yeah
S0035	and then suddenly someone say can you talk
S0132	em library fin what do you think about the library fin i mean this lady that come to the desk she be she be ask for book to be recall the book that be recall recall on her account
S0035	yeah
S0132	do you think that they should pay charge on it
S0035	god it feel like you're interview me i think the library fin be
S0132	it's a bite hefty i mean if you're just not there
S0035	bite hefty
S0132	yeah but i think if they they need to be advise about the fact that they have to return the book and they have a certain period which might just go
S0035	yeah i think we could be maybe a bite clearer
S0132	yeah
S0035	as to as to in in advance that you they're gonna get fin
S0132	that's right because that lady that come today she i mean she she wasn't really aware of the fact that she
S0035	no
S0132	that's the reason why
S0035	yeah
S0132	and i have a lady come this morning and she say exactly the same thing
S0035	yeah
S0132	so
S0035	i haven't get anything to say about the library i just sit here and do it
S0132	i don't know
S0035	you've learn everything quicker than me i've be here for three years but
S0132	you think so
S0035	yeah
S0132	and you've just be do this job for a few months and now now you know more
S0035	hi
S0132	em i mean you can't arrange
S0035	no what arrange to go together
S0132	yeah unless if you speak to cos we have three people in the desk at eleven
S0035	yeah
S0132	and i can go off like for twenty minutes and just say students come to the
S0035	yeah we could ask her couldn't we
S0132	yeah
S0035	yeah shall we do a bite now and see how far we can get
S0132	yeah
S0035	and if if we can't then we'll
S0132	if if it get busy then we can just eh
S0035	yeah
S0132	speak to our manager and see what she say
S0035	yeah she'll say no
S0132	i can't even imagine it actually she's not in today
S0035	no she's not
S0132	no so it will be and be quite easy
S0035	be quite yeah
S0132	he'll go oh yeah yeah yeah go ahead
S0035	oh the library oh yeah
S0132	sorry em so there's em i have it em how do you how do you find use the library do you think it's quite advance now
S0035	em i yeah i think cos i go to leeds uni as well so i've kinda get a comparison and we've get much better machine and much better em you know like automate things like you know take your book out
S0132	that's right yeah
S0035	and bring them back and all that
S0132	do they have laptops in
S0035	i don't think so no
S0132	oh
S0035	it's quite old fashion but then the other thing be that they don't their sort of staff aren't on show so if you wanna
S0132	oh right
S0035	if you want to ask somebody something you have to actually go and find them
S0132	okay
S0035	so they probably don't get bother as much so it's the
S0132	the vd yeah cos they're sort of quite centralise by the
S0035	yeah craig say that didn't he
S0132	yeah
S0035	well he say that to me he say that oh sit in the middle and
S0132	yeah that's right em
S0035	yeah but then i suppose it's good cos we have a lot of international students that probably need a bite more help in term of find things and language and all that stuff so
S0132	and a lot of students say well especially the laptop they be quite popular for the students i think
S0035	yeah
S0132	like they like to just sit around different part of the library
S0035	yeah
S0132	and just use the laptop rather than
S0035	be you serious
S0132	go and sit in the computer room
S0035	at first yeah at first i think why why do we do laptops i don't i didn't really think we need them but then i think well if you actually build a room full of ninety computers it would take so much room wouldn't it so
S0132	send it through
S0035	yeah
S0132	and it take quite a while for those computers to load as well it take about twenty minutes
S0035	mm
S0132	for the pc to actually load our program yeah
S0035	oh do it
S0132	yeah but when you sign into a laptop it literally take a few minutes
S0035	right so that's probably why they like them
S0132	so they prefer to have that and obviously you can sit anywhere in the library
S0035	yeah
S0132	so em it give them that sort of
S0035	yeah
S0132	em i would i wouldn't mind actually i would i wouldn't really like to use em a laptop that other people have be use i would prefer to just bring my own in
S0035	yeah i've forget about like it's sort of hygiene
S0132	yeah
S0035	yeah that's true
S0132	cos you think how many people use the laptops here
S0035	yeah i'd probably sneeze all over it or
S0132	i know
S0035	oh
S0132	you'd have to get them clean quite regularly
S0035	oh god they probably don't wash their hand do they when they go to the oh
S0132	no they don't no
S0132	oh they never
S0035	sorry we're talk about
S0035	we're a bite off topic here alright okay
S0132	oh i think they need to be clean on a daily basis
S0035	yes
S0132	but then we would probably have to do that wouldn't we
S0035	yeah exactly yeah
S0132	i don't think i want to oh i don't think about that when i update the laptops
S0035	oh do you do that
S0132	yeah
S0035	oh sorry i've put the
S0132	yeah i have to yeah but no but no but no i i do think about it though i think about that
S0035	oh right
S0132	other people have be use it especially students
S0035	yeah
S0132	and they probably don't clean them
S0035	see if you'd not have i say it i would never have think of that
S0132	but it's the same with pcs as well it i mean you
S0035	that's true yeah
S0132	when they're use it a lot of students who come through my desk and say oh i really don't want to use my pc because it's get all sort of gunk or you know
S0035	yeah
S0132	people have be eat things and
S0035	yeah but yeah that's true yeah
S0132	so that's why i just i don't really know but i think the hygiene thing be quite a big thing
S0035	yeah germs
S0132	em i'd say if you be compare libraries i cos i use to read here at about five years ago
S0035	right
S0132	i graduate in two thousand and six and it's completely different
S0035	i think someone take your thesis the other day
S0132	my thesis
S0035	possibly
S0132	no there be someone else who's get a thesis
S0035	oh
S0132	which be the same name as me
S0035	oh be there another
S0132	yeah there be but it's not me
S0035	yeah cos i saw it and i think oh have somebody take sabina's
S0132	yeah that would be great but it's not my thesis
S0035	oh
S0132	i saw it on the em trolley and i think it be mine and then it it be someone else's
S0035	aw
S0132	it be a completely different title altogether
S0035	someone take 's out one week
S0132	i know i remember you be say yeah hi
S0035	yeah we don't have staplers that's an interest issue everyone want a stapler
S0132	yeah the reason why we don't have staplers be because students take the staplers or they break the stapler
S0035	yeah
S0132	so eh we decide that after as a form of punishment
S0035	students can't be trust with staplers
S0132	with staplers em we be look into maybe like a standard sort of heavy duty stapler
S0035	oh be we
S0132	but the cost of it be a bite much so
S0035	we should like chain them cos we've get these hole in the desk we should get like a chain and
S0132	yeah
S0035	chain them up
S0132	i mean they be available at the other sit if you go to
S0035	oh be they
S0132	if you go to or they have staplers and they have other stationery there
S0035	so that's why they always ask then i suppose
S0132	but because this library be open twenty four hours the students tend to just come
S0035	mm
S0132	and they either take the stapler
S0035	mm
S0132	or they just damage the stapler
S0035	mm
S0132	which just mean other students can't use it
S0035	well they take it somewhere else and hide it
S0132	that's right yeah
S0035	mm
S0132	so i mean it's
S0035	but they don't do it with hole punchers they seem quite
S0132	no
S0035	responsible with hole punchers
S0132	yeah like you you can't really do much with a hole punch can you
S0035	no and why would you want to take a hole punch you wouldn't really would you
S0132	no no
S0035	it's too heavy
S0132	that's true but do you you know last week do you hear about the graffiti in the
S0035	yes because that room be
S0132	that room be lock
S0035	not bookable yeah
S0132	well what happen be that em someone what do they put in on that i don't remember what they they write something on the wall or something like or something but it wasn't what be write that's not the reason why the room be lock it be because em want to make sure that students you know understand that when they use the room they need to make sure that they you know just like everyone else
S0035	mm so what
S0035	so be it clean straight away and then they
S0132	it be clean it be clean
S0035	yeah
S0132	but it be just a form of punishment for the
S0035	oh
S0132	students wouldn't wouldn't graffiti
S0035	oh that be quite interest what you say about that to em close the room
S0035	sorry yeah cos you say shut the room
S0132	yeah it's as a form of punishment
S0035	as a form of punishment right well that's it's a good idea kind of but you need to communicate cos people won't know that
S0132	well what happen be that the room be shut and then people who be book in that room be move to the the other new room
S0035	right
S0132	the ones we've get here
S0035	right
S0132	i think it's room six
S0035	right
S0132	and em there aren't any pcs in that room
S0035	right
S0132	so they weren't able to use it and they didn't
S0035	right
S0132	eh a few students come on friday and they be really annoy because they want to use the pc
S0035	yeah
S0132	so em what happen be that we have to open the room but then
S0035	yeah
S0132	give the go ahead and say they could use the room and then find out and he be annoy
S0132	so
S0035	but that be a good idea to this idea of like do something as a consequence of them do be a good idea but do they
S0132	they just don't understand why
S0035	no so you need to communicate that
S0132	unless they have leave
S0035	a bite better don't you
S0132	yeah they need us to leave a notice outside the room i think to say why
S0035	we're do we're do a record for the lady
S0132	the library em we're talk about the library
S0035	oh yeah
S0132	it's alright i've get them
S0035	that's the room so yeah i be say i say i think you need to communicate these punishments better because otherwise they're not go to work
S0132	they probably need to put a notice up i think
S0132	so they might so they should really should really put a notice outside the room
S0035	we're laugh cos actually we want to complain about somebody but we're not go to
S0132	i might actually
S0035	yeah get some grumpy customers i don't know we be moan about students weren't we
S0132	lecturers and students
S0035	lecturers yeah
S0132	we get some the students come to em the desk and they complain about fifty pence fin on their account
S0035	yeah
S0132	em and
S0132	you you're go to come down again
S0035	i hate it when they bring their their own computers in and ask you to work out what's wrong
S0132	i don't mind because i come from an it background
S0035	oh right
S0132	i don't mind do things like that
S0035	oh
S0132	it give me an opportunity to use my it knowledge
S0035	i obviously haven't get any it knowledge so
S0132	so i'm able to help them and they they be quite appreciative so
S0035	that's good
S0132	so i like that part mm but what what be the
S0035	so what do you do master
S0132	em well my master in library information management
S0035	right
S0132	my undergraduate degree be in business and it
S0035	right
S0132	so when i first actually when i first start work for the library it be only just a temporary thing
S0035	oh right
S0132	em and then it i
S0035	be that when you be an undergrad or
S0132	no eh i just graduate when i first start work here
S0035	mm
S0132	and em i remember i start work as a liaison assistant
S0035	mm
S0132	and i really enjoy the job so that's when i decide that i could go ahead
S0035	mm
S0132	and do the master in information and library and information management
S0035	so what be liaison thing what's that job
S0132	em liaison assistant it be just work for the liaison offices
S0035	right
S0132	em and it be a lot of sort of admin things and you know order things and
S0035	right
S0132	check on em what book students want and deal with student query and things
S0035	right
S0132	so very very sort of general things
S0035	right
S0132	em and then i get move into acquisitions
S0035	right
S0132	em about two years later because you know when project happen
S0035	oh no i don't know
S0132	you you be you not well
S0035	i'm not well i'm just not on the ball really with all this be part time i don't know really know what's go on
S0132	it be quite a few years ago but my
S0035	oh no i wasn't here i've only be here i've be here for about three years but
S0132	no it be before then
S0035	yeah
S0132	see i've be work here for about well it's come on to five years now
S0035	right
S0132	and it doesn't it feel a lot longer actually
S0035	yeah
S0035	not just no i don't know
S0132	what be we say work here
S0035	em we be talk about your em your yeah you've be here for five years
S0132	project headroom that we go through then
S0035	project headroom head yeah go on i don't know about that
S0132	so you don't know anything about that
S0035	no i don't know what that be
S0132	basically we there be a quite a few member of staff that be take basically lose their job
S0035	oh right
S0132	em and eh we they have to go for a restructure at the time but before i start like
S0035	be this when it and library become one
S0132	no it be just actually library and it come together
S0035	yeah
S0132	that's when tony lewis be here
S0035	yeah
S0132	and then we go through a restructure
S0035	yeah
S0132	and that be probably one year before i start
S0035	yeah
S0132	cos i remember this em when i start work for the liaison team
S0035	yeah
S0132	they be eh they they'd already go through a restructure
S0035	mm hm
S0132	so a year later em i think they need some more staff cutbacks
S0035	right
S0132	eh and that's when they go for project headroom
S0035	right
S0132	so eh and a lot of people take up em voluntary severance pay
S0035	oh right
S0132	which be different to what it be now and that's
S0035	oh right
S0132	em i get the impression that a lot of people like work for the library that work here anyway
S0035	yeah
S0132	cos they're most of them here for that long
S0035	yeah well i've work here for three years but i've be off for that i be off for nine months on maternity so really i've really actually do about two years
S0132	two years
S0035	yeah
S0132	altogether i've have a variety of roles i've work for eh em
S0035	you have do everything haven't you
S0132	i know i've work for liaison and i've work for em acquisitions but i also work for em it train team
S0035	right
S0132	the it train team as well em and then i apply for this job quite a few time
S0035	yeah well i remember cos be you be you sister in law to
S0132	no no eh yeah kind well no future sister in law
S0035	oh right yeah so you're
S0132	because my brother's her partner
S0035	your brother's her
S0132	that's right
S0035	i think her i think her brother be your partner well anyway
S0132	yeah
S0035	so your your brother
S0132	yeah so work for the library yeah work for the library
S0035	your brother be her partner
S0132	that's right
S0035	so that's so 's your brother
S0132	that's right
S0035	right i'm get the family tree in my head now okay
S0132	cos 's my niece
S0035	right oh i see right okay yeah
S0132	so it all make sense now
S0035	it's all start to make sense yeah
S0132	we have we have different people work in the library on the enquiry desk don't we
S0035	yeah
S0132	that have be work here for a long time
S0035	yeah
S0132	let's hope no one else
S0035	i be go to say it's go to get busy about eleven isn't it cos
S0132	yeah
S0035	they change over
S0132	of students yeah do you try and get the
S0035	yeah not here though in
S0132	in
S0035	yeah nothing relate to the libraries whatsoever so we can't really talk about that
S0132	so what what be what do you find that the resources at university be
S0035	i think there be more specific book and resources that i need em but then that's that's due to like the subject nature you know that i don't think that someone would study the thing here that i'm study at
S0132	yeah
S0035	so consequently they haven't get exactly the same book but there be more general book here actually so i do get out general book
S0132	yeah
S0035	there be more instructory book like how to how to research how to write your thesis how to do this or that or the other
S0132	yeah you see i i when i do my when i do it at meet em i find that the resources there they do have a lot of resources
S0035	yeah
S0132	but it be the help there
S0035	oh right
S0132	eh it slightly different because they have an information desk there
S0035	yeah
S0132	but it's all just sort of general query and i know our library be slightly smaller than that library as well
S0035	mm
S0132	and they've get libraries on different campuses
S0035	yeah
S0132	so i didn't find it as useful
S0035	right
S0132	and so when i be do that i be take book from here rather than there
S0035	do you yeah cos you be work here at the same time
S0132	that's right yeah
S0035	yeah
S0132	and i just find i've just find it much more convenient
S0035	mm
S0132	work here and em i be able to sort of work on my assignments and things like that
S0035	yeah
S0132	so and i could obviously cos we've get the facilities here we could use the room
S0035	mm
S0132	and the computer things and
S0035	yeah
S0132	if i need to if i need the group room i could do that here
S0035	yeah
S0132	again it be difficult there because they have so many students there
S0035	yeah
S0132	but they don't have enough facilities
S0035	oh
S0132	em to accommodate so whenever we try to book a room there em it'd be impossible
S0035	mm
S0132	because other students would've already use be use the room
S0035	yeah
S0132	so that's why but em yeah i think in comparison this library be do quite well in term of
S0035	yeah i
S0132	electronic resources eh that we provide as well
S0035	but i think they put a lot of money into the library cos i think it's be one of the things that they want
S0132	it's quite central isn't it to the university so that's probably why but em
S0035	cos it's i think it's one of the strengths that they're try to sort of play on isn't it of of the
S0132	they be and they do if you think about like during term time especially this site we do get a lot of students come to the library it's always quite busy
S0035	yeah
S0132	and eh whereas eh you find at
S0035	mm
S0132	it's normally during during the summer when it pick up
S0035	yeah
S0132	and you get a lot of students try to do
S0035	yeah cos they're all on work placements aren't they yeah
S0132	work placements and things em and obviously library which be just always quiet but i think that's more to do with the fact that because it's small
S0035	yeah
S0132	and the students there be not they don't really need much help
S0035	no
S0132	but a lot of students here
S0035	i like it over there though
S0132	yeah it's better
S0035	i do like it
S0132	i do like to work a variety though
S0035	yeah
S0132	i do like to work at all different sit
S0035	do you
S0132	yeah
S0035	yeah
S0132	because that way at least you experience all the
S0035	see 's manage to get herself over there full time hasn't she
S0132	yeah
S0035	she's do some sneaky trick there
S0132	she have yeah i think a lot of students people that go over there they do want to carry on work there rather than come back to this site because it's so busy yeah
S0035	yeah not surprise yeah i've only do one shift up there i be just like oh bliss love it it's like i've be on holiday
S0132	it be but here you just get a lot of foreign students come to the desk who be not quite sure what to do
S0035	yeah
S0132	but at the same time a lot of students which be business students complain about the littlest things like fin and you know
S0035	yeah well business yeah
S0132	you don't really get that you don't really get that at that site you don't
S0035	yeah do you not
S0132	get very many students complain no
S0035	do they not argue
S0132	no no at all
S0035	perform arts be chill out
S0132	very yeah yeah
S0035	business be like
S0132	and you can see it's true
S0035	stress
S0132	it really be it's subject relate and i wouldn't have think it it would have be but it be
S0035	yeah
S0132	and then you get
S0035	i don't know people be different aren't they depend on what they sort of choose to do in life i think yeah
S0132	choose to do yeah cos you get a lot of mature students at library
S0035	yeah do like nurse and that
S0132	nurse and things
S0035	yeah
S0132	and they be more than will to just come to the desk and just clear their fin with no question
S0035	yeah
S0132	you do get the odd student who will ask or have but they pay they must pay over sort of like twenty pound sometimes
S0035	yeah
S0132	because they on away on placement
S0035	yeah and they can't get their book in
S0132	yeah
S0035	and they're just relieve that they've get five minutes to get in aren't they
S0132	that's right yeah and they just want to clear whatever fine they have there on their account so
S0035	all sort out yeah yeah
S0132	so like and you get that quite a lot so
S0035	interview
S0035	it's like i've get to talk really naturally even though 's stand behind us wait to sit down
S0132	i know
S0035	i'm like you've gotta you've gotta stand there for two minutes sorry
S0132	no we've only get a few more minutes leave but we've do quite well with it
S0035	yeah
S0132	to talk about the library
S0035	we've be talk about this library for twenty minutes haven't we
S0132	i didn't ever think i'd be able to talk so much about it
S0035	and then sometimes 's on and then it's like bore and you just don't want to be here do you
S0132	yeah
S0132	em
S0035	right yeah so now we've get load of time
S0132	we won't find anything to say yeah i like the new i like the new i like the self service machine the new ones that they bring in
S0035	yes
S0132	the ones that em cos they look like cash machine i think when they first come well when they first put them in
S0035	yeah
S0132	em a lot of students think they be cash machine
S0035	i wish they be i wish we have cash machine
S0132	they get quite yeah they do look like it you still get students now come to the desk and ask where to return their book and they've even get sort of like blue light
S0035	yeah
S0132	which and it's get a return at the top
S0035	i don't like be leave to our own in resources
S0132	do you not
S0035	oh she's disappear
S0132	i know
S0035	cos then i feel like oh i haven't actually get anything to say about the library at all so have you get a proper like librarian qualification then
S0132	i have yeah i get the master
S0035	oh get you expert
S0132	oh well the library course be not anything to do with the library
S0035	be it not
S0132	no
S0035	say that actually
S0132	it's more to do with the em search and create sort of search engines
S0035	yeah
S0132	and like that em
S0035	oh right so be it actually like
S0132	we we've do some business matter business modules as well
S0035	right
S0132	it's be sort of variety of things
S0035	but nothing that you would use every day or
S0132	i can't really yeah i can't really think of anything i mean what i do my dissertation on the em library read list system lasu
S0035	right
S0132	which i think be quite useful at the time
S0035	yeah
S0132	but i'm not sure how how much students use it though
S0035	i don't know
S0132	and whether they find it useful i never cos i think on the desk before i start work i think you'd get a lot of students
S0035	mm
S0132	come to my desk ask about it
S0035	we do for a while actually there be quite quite a lot for a while
S0132	but then it's yeah it's quite
S0035	yeah
S0132	and it be work in acquisitions it be em they do it a lot actually with lasu
S0035	do they
S0132	yeah say em you know order book and things it's all base on read list system
S0035	but the thing be even if we even if they don't access the read list through the library site they they're still get book on the read list and they've get the read list on paper haven't they so we might not know that it's do you know what i mean
S0132	on the read list but that's why they go that's what it's
S0035	yeah but that that's what it's yeah
S0132	cos all the formulas and everything that we em order book be be base on the read list
S0035	right
S0132	em and the lecturers whereas in the past it use to be where the lecturer would give the student number now we have to work out the formula
S0035	yeah right
S0132	i say we but acquisitions have to work out the formula
S0035	what do that mean then
S0132	it's the formula that's give accord to the number of students
S0035	oh i see
S0132	that be on the course
S0035	right
S0132	so and that's how they order the book
S0035	so that's quite good cos i'm i'm do a bite of lecture at and i'm teach a course and it's all these different lecture on it
S0132	yes
S0035	and this one guy and he hasn't put he hasn't put his em read on the vle so they can't get it so it's just in the library
S0132	right
S0035	a hundred and twenty students on that course
S0132	yeah
S0035	one book standard loan so i be like i'm teach the course i've not even read it
S0132	yeah
S0035	so i'm like go i can't take this book out
S0132	no
S0035	cos all these students want to take it
S0132	no all the students yeah
S0035	yeah i've get to reserve it but it just seem mean doesn't it
S0132	well you get that you get but the some of the students will come and they'll probably be about thirty forty book
S0035	yeah
S0132	and there's a maximum i think twenty be the maximum of book that you can order
S0035	right
S0132	and i remember a few students come to my desk complain say that there weren't enough cos the students be borrow the book but actually the the book that be available in the library be only suppose to be for reference
S0035	right
S0132	if they've get core texts they need to purchase the core texts
S0035	yeah well that's true they forget that don't they yeah
S0132	yeah but they treat the core text and they'll they'll sort of think oh we'll just get it from the library and we'll just use it throughout the course but it doesn't work like that
S0035	yeah yeah no
S0132	and that's why
S0035	not if you've gotta use it throughout you've gotta buy it
S0132	no and that's why we try to advise them that you know whatever
S0035	mm
S0132	say core text the students really be expect to purchase them
S0035	yeah
S0132	especially when they're make reservations they'll be put reservations on
S0035	mm
S0132	some of the book
S0035	mm mm
S0132	and you know they'll come back and say why i want to use it for longer and you think well yeah other students want to use it too
S0035	yeah like when they go oh i've i've read it i've not have a chance to read it
S0132	yeah
S0035	and it's like really important
S0132	no
S0035	you're like well that's why everyone need it isn't it
S0132	that's right yeah why it's better to purchase it
