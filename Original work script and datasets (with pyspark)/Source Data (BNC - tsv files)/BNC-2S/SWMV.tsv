S0037	no chickens that'd be good wouldn't it

S0115	that be just 's joke that that my dad be have an affair with uh with the neighbour
S0037	auntie why do they call her auntie
S0115	i think it's it's partly funny because of the implausibility of of um
S0037	yeah well name
S0115	um
S0037	so funny imagine of your name be
S0115	cos uh it's funny that his name actually be um and he hasn't as far as we know he's not the same as the as the great train robber
S0037	might be might just be like a double bluff
S0115	and i saw a programme about him
S0037	might he might be it might be a double bluff
S0115	he be in brazil and they capture him and put him in a in a a sack put him on an aeroplane
S0037	yeah
S0115	and uh uh
S0037	but he be like out wasn't he cos he's not very well
S0115	then they then they put him on a
S0037	or be he alive still
S0115	what
S0037	he's alive still isn't he
S0115	i think so
S0037	cos be he not let out of prison cos he be die
S0115	i'm not sure
S0037	or be i blur two stories
S0115	so they capture him and then they sort of put him on a sort of go party in um on some caribbean island or something and then the the paper have get news of it um they be just they be just party on a yacht and then i don't know i think he somehow manage to get away at some point
S0037	yeah
S0115	um i think i dunno if he get into america or
S0037	there be some people involve in that robbery that that or that get away didn't they like even now
S0115	yeah um it's a it's a real like legendary robbery isn't it cos of um the the large amount and the success of it
S0037	they didn't know all the people involve be that whitechapel on tonight or be it on a monday
S0115	um
S0037	cos i watch it's so annoy like you know when you watch like uh er um a programme and then you realize that it's a two parter and you're like ohh like now i've gotta wait i've gotta make sure i watch the other part or i'll be really unsatisfied
S0115	yeah be it just that be it just that that that do that or be it another one
S0037	well it's happen load of time but that's the one i have get the other part of that to watch
S0115	i'm not sure it's sunday but um
S0037	i don't know when that be
S0115	but um
S0037	i be think maybe we should go and see
S0115	what be on sunday
S0037	maybe we should go and see the artist the film
S0115	yeah if you wanna i mean where's the where's the cinema
S0037	there's a few there's one at
S0115	well obviously this pub use to be a cinema didn't it
S0037	it do yeah there's one at there's one at the um there's one next to wetherspoons in town that's
S0115	oh yeah the uh
S0037	that's a picture house
S0037	next door to there there's one there
S0115	um yeah
S0037	and that's like a old sort of um
S0115	odeon or something a fifties one
S0037	yeah like you can uh like like sort of old like red seat and you know like the old style
S0115	yeah oh you mean
S0037	and then there's one near where i work too at the leisure park or whatever it's call
S0115	right uh yeah could see it it's get a lot of uh positive review but might be something even better
S0037	well jam bond's out this year i mean
S0037	hold the front page
S0115	what's it call d'you know
S0037	jam bond what
S0115	what's the jam bond film gonna be call
S0037	oh um oh i do hear it somewhere can't remember
S0115	um so it's another another daniel craig be it
S0037	yeah
S0115	he's good i like i like daniel craig as uh
S0037	bite pouty but yeah
S0115	well he's get a certain way of use his lips that make him look like he's he's pout and
S0037	i like him though
S0115	but that's
S0037	although i do like the
S0115	he's kind of he's really good i think
S0037	i do like the cheesy jam bond though
S0115	like pierce brosnan and roger moore and stuff
S0037	yeah or even the sean connery ones be quite cheesy
S0115	yeah well it's
S0037	he's really hairy
S0115	it's just it's not no it's not really as cheesy now be it but uh
S0037	no but he's like the innuendo's really really like heavy hand
S0115	yeah i mean it be it it it's very entertain but uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	but i don't have any on video but uh
S0037	they're always on at christmas though i i mean that's how you know it's christmas innit
S0115	yeah yeah the that's the traditional one isn't it um in the in christmas day afternoon
S0037	christmas day night yeah
S0115	after after you've eat your uh after you've eat your um dinner
S0037	yeah
S0115	cos there's gonna be a jam bond on queen's speech
S0037	i never we never have the telly on though never even put the telly on on christmas day
S0115	no i think that may be a good thing actually uh
S0037	too many
S0115	you've get family yeah i think it it it it's if you've get a lot guests then you're unlikely probably to to um
S0037	yeah
S0115	but if you've get a few and you're sort of sit there maybe it's not as good as if you're talk i think like um
S0037	yeah
S0115	jam bond be a be a bank holiday thing isn't it
S0037	so d'you think that your mam and dad and that be alright about you not go this christmas or
S0115	yeah i reckon i mean they'll come afterwards won't they and
S0037	yeah
S0115	they'll probably have to go and see
S0037	and we'll go before
S0115	they'll probably have to go and see won't they um
S0037	perhaps yeah
S0115	or or something so uh they may not like be available on the actual christmas day but then
S0037	yeah
S0115	they come and it it work well last year cos they come
S0037	they do yeah it be nice
S0115	they visit us on what be it twenty seventh or twenty eighth
S0037	um we come back here on the twenty seventh
S0115	we come we come on the twenty seventh
S0037	we'll have to check when me nana's have her party
S0115	literally leave in the middle of the party
S0037	i know that be a shame
S0115	go to a party for like two hours and
S0037	we'll have to double check that this time cos we'll probably come back on the
S0115	i quite like the idea of come back on the twenty seventh but i also like the idea of have a gap
S0037	nana's party
S0115	like have the box day off and then have a party on the twenty seventh
S0037	yeah me too
S0115	but
S0037	what do we do on box day do we just hang about
S0115	i kind of think that if that we should try and do it again like
S0037	what d'you mean
S0115	like go back on the twenty seventh again and go to the party
S0037	and miss me nana's party
S0115	we didn't really miss it sort of go to the
S0037	no i'd like to go
S0115	maybe we could so it's
S0037	maybe i could use
S0115	maybe we'll turn up and just come back on the twenty eighth
S0037	maybe i could use some
S0115	what we could do be we could come back on twenty eighth and have our parent come round on the twenty eighth
S0037	yeah might be quite stressful though
S0115	yeah
S0037	we'll have load of wash and like
S0115	but but i really enjoy have um those extra couple of days like
S0037	and if we get delay
S0115	i enjoy have like the thirtieth
S0037	yeah
S0115	free cos my parent have go back on the twenty ninth so i have the thirtieth free we be able to go shop and uh get some bargain
S0037	oh i might yeah that's true
S0115	and sort of
S0037	well i might take like cos i'm suppose to go back work on the third i think or the second i can't remember it's quite early but i might take a day off or something at the start of the yeah but like an extra day
S0115	you mean like um
S0037	well this yeah i have three days off at the start of the year at lucy's wed thing so
S0115	yeah that be a great wed really uh
S0037	oh yeah we be look at the picture on friday weren't we
S0115	yeah uh it's quite a few quite a few picture great wed um
S0037	really nice yeah
S0115	like be a big big house
S0037	i really like those you know those those antler light fittings
S0115	yeah there's some funny uh it's an old sort of manor house isn't wasn't it and um
S0037	and i like the sort of colour scheme it be like a lot of like green uh like dark green and
S0115	yeah
S0037	actually not too dissimilar to in here really
S0115	ay
S0037	not too dissimilar to in here really
S0115	well what've we get we've get like a
S0037	you know what i mean like
S0115	dark brown sort of
S0037	like the wood and like uh like that green on that wall over there
S0115	oh yeah yeah
S0037	they have that sort of colour didn't they
S0115	yeah it be well i remember it be quite cream there be quite a lot of cream
S0037	be there
S0115	i felt that there be um but it be
S0037	there be a lot of like nice light fittings and stuff and and that purple billiard table that be good although i i didn't really see that in person although i saw load of picture of it
S0115	oh yeah um there be always people play on it so yeah cos it be great cos it if you have the whole house to yourself and you've get different guests
S0037	yeah
S0115	they sort of spread out and do different things so have like a little bite of a dance floor but
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh do it i dunno if that keep on all night or if it sort of stop
S0037	yeah that's well they have the band in there didn't they
S0115	they have a band on for a bite but then i think they be just play they be just play record
S0037	think so
S0115	then uh so the dance floor bite and then they have like um uh there be the bar which be where
S0037	yeah which turn into a dance floor later on
S0115	later on they they get out some speakers and play some music
S0037	that be so like such preparation though
S0115	of the bar and the and the the staff have to sort of wait in the bar till like people have stop and they have to continue to serve us all through the night
S0037	cos what time do people go to bed like
S0115	four or five or something some of them some of them really want to make you know like big big party of it and really stay up to like four or five
S0037	yeah stay up the whole time yeah
S0115	um which which i think be great but i be quite tire myself
S0037	yeah i be
S0115	uh we go to bed at about three or threeish three thirty or something
S0037	yeah
S0115	um the whole the whole thing be great cos we have we have uh we have
S0037	i be so drain by then
S0115	come come on wednesday um we leave on thursday on thursday we leave to we go to huddersfield
S0037	be say that be his favourite night of the whole thing like
S0037	that wednesday when we just sit on the sofa
S0115	it's no i think think he be sort of slightly uh slightly joke then but uh
S0037	drink wine and just eat nice food no i don't think he be i think he be
S0115	that's pretty good um
S0037	he still
S0115	we have we have a couple of ciders and then no we have a we have a few
S0037	wine we have some wine be we not wine
S0115	three bottle of wine go uh
S0115	then then we crack open the cider
S0037	uh
S0115	um and then uh we get get slightly involve with with the vodka which we still haven't drink yet cos it's your vodka it's yours um if it'd be mine it wouldn't uh
S0037	i'm the very picture of i know
S0115	you you're good at keep you're good at keep uh
S0037	well i don't like it that that much that's the thing i think if it be like if it be gin or if it be whiskey i would probably have have more of it by now
S0115	you don't really like vodka yeah well
S0037	i don't really like vodka very much
S0115	it's not my favourite cos it doesn't have a flavour but
S0037	maybe i should try and flavour it
S0115	but that's what you're suppose to do you're suppose to like have it with uh things on flavour yeah make make a few break up you know make a few small ones out of it
S0037	although not the not the chilli ginger one
S0115	yeah i think chilli and um
S0037	chilli's probably a bad move
S0115	chilli and and alcohol be be uh
S0037	bite difficult but i find chilli and chocolate difficult
S0115	it's tough ginger though fresh ginger in uh in uh what like gin be it or vodka
S0037	no it be vodka that be when come before
S0115	put put fresh ginger in the vodka then you have that with lemonade and the fizz
S0037	yeah that's right
S0115	just ginger the ginger go up your nose like the fizz from it really sting your nose
S0037	i've get some ginger in the fridge actually i've get some ginger in the fridge
S0115	yeah we've get some fresh ginger so we're look uh look like the uh plan be form
S0037	no i've gotta go to work tomorrow maybe on friday
S0115	oh yeah no i just mean like to uh to put it in you've gotta wait a while haven't you to
S0037	maybe yeah
S0115	gotta wait for it to uh um
S0037	yeah maybe we should
S0115	uh perfuse or infuse or diffuse or whatever the word be
S0037	probably all of those hey where d'you wanna go on friday have you think any more or d'you wanna get something and eat it in
S0115	that's that's our anniversary innit um well there's split split between like
S0037	cos i do still i be
S0115	go out and we can go the algerian restaurant which be call uh al kasbah i don't know if there's any other similar restaurants to that on the the other hand
S0037	there's load down there
S0115	on the on the other hand might be able to get better ingredients ourselves and attempt to make something
S0037	yeah
S0115	good ourselves and then
S0037	cos that paella be really good i really i really enjoy that
S0115	could have like a lamb could like could make a lamb tagine
S0037	yeah because like we um you know for the like on valentines day for the money that we spend like you know if we'd go out and have like a three course dinner and drink and stuff we would have spend way more than i spend at the shop
S0115	yeah i mean um it's it's i think with restaurants the the the
S0037	but it be nice
S0115	the the advantage of a restaurant be that you you get the atmosphere and
S0037	yeah
S0115	get to be serve by the people and you can have drink and stuff and i mean you can then go directly to the pub afterwards a lot but
S0037	yeah and i think i think we should probably go out because it would be nice to be like we never go to mill road round there cos it's too far
S0115	well we we do sometimes i think that's it's me a different preference
S0037	yeah but rarely like
S0115	like if it be up to me i think i'd probably go more often over there
S0037	yeah but it's quite far though
S0115	it's just a different preference for us i don't find it i don't really mind that much because cos there be many pubs on the way back so you could easily break break the journey on the way back
S0037	i suppose
S0115	i mean there be a bite of a problem round here obviously be that a lot of the pubs here close at twelve so if you be go out late somewhere and then come back then you couldn't stop anywhere anywhere in this northern
S0037	on the way back no that's what i mean yeah
S0115	northern central ring of cambridge but there's a couple of place you can stop on in town in the centre of town
S0037	yeah but it's still like a fair old walk from there to here
S0115	well yeah but i don't personally mind
S0037	suppose you could get a taxi
S0115	but yeah of course a taxi back
S0037	but um
S0115	and that's what i think a lot of people would do that like but i don't mind walk really um
S0037	yeah
S0115	but yeah if we we go out and then sort of enjoy that sort of atmosphere that we've get a lot of a lot of different restaurants to choose from
S0037	so d'you think we should do that then
S0115	uh but uh but on the other hand obviously it's good to make your own stuff because then you can can get more more quality food perhaps than a restaurant
S0037	but i i think i worry that i would like i would get relax at home and like not want to go out or if we do i would just come down here or
S0115	well um well i mean once again that's up to that's up to uh personal choice like i think i
S0037	i wouldn't be like okay i've just have a giant meal let's walk all the way over into town
S0115	i mean i think i think i'd probably be more like that but
S0037	yeah but i know i mean me like i dunno if i would
S0115	yeah i mean it's it's it's up to preference isn't it um uh
S0037	dunno if i would quite lazy
S0115	but i think once again with a restaurant like if you've you've you don't wanna eat too much anyway because in a restaurant you're like if you go out for a indian and you have a whole balti or something
S0037	yeah yeah yeah i know what you mean it ruin your night
S0115	like all that sort of uh all the oil that's in the uh balti
S0037	that's why i don't like get like set menus cos i just think
S0115	whatever what's whatever your favourite indian be be a pathia or something
S0037	i like a pathia i like a dansak
S0115	dansak the persian one
S0037	actually i like i think i probably like the side better i think i would i would probably like just like maybe i should get like a be it call a thali tali
S0115	thali be um be like like a
S0037	cos then you get a few little
S0115	tapas style dish with lot of little bits
S0037	because then like i think i it's just i get i like it when you have lot of different things i like the side dish better actually sag paneer my ultimate all time favourite although
S0115	um so d'you check the battery
S0037	oh it's fine
S0115	cool yeah cos like sometimes like the battery go and uh uh
S0037	i know yeah no its batteries be charge
S0115	be talk for like thirty minutes and
S0037	no i can see the light the light's on
S0115	yeah uh just uh sometimes it just sort of
S0037	yeah
S0115	there's be a few time hasn't there when it's just a bite it's a bite unwieldy sometimes actually
S0037	i know cos you get lose in the conversation don't you no but um
S0115	yeah i mean so but you well i be say if you go out for an indian then obviously you can you can really fill fill yourself up
S0037	well we're go for an indian with your parent though aren't we we don't need to go for an indian on friday
S0115	yeah yeah cos when my parent come on um the the follow friday
S0037	the second
S0115	we'll be go out probably for an indian
S0037	day before steve's birthday
S0115	then then it's it would be better if we have more better thai meal thai place around here but i don't really know
S0037	there's a few though i mean we go to
S0115	yeah but we've be to two and um
S0037	why don't we go to that
S0115	i won't wasn't tremendously impress with either of the two um
S0037	why don't we go to the vietnamese place then
S0115	well yeah that'd be interest but but i want to go out cos it cos um i suspect that it that it won't be as good as it could be
S0037	expensive well how d'you know
S0115	cos the last two weren't very amaze
S0037	i think they be that one where he go in on green street with like they have like your parent have like a whole fish that be nice

S0115	i i i don't have a positive no no i don't have a positive uh recollection of that but uh the one in be brilliant i mean
S0037	i know but but that's probably part of the problem like
S0115	but uh the one in be uh be just amaze
S0037	just because we go to though that's like that's probably set the bar too high
S0115	yeah i mean it's a bite of a i think in general because you get that like smaller town the the the entrepreneur you know really want to put a lot of effort in
S0037	but as
S0115	whereas if you're here in there's a lot more money go around
S0037	yeah
S0115	um set up i think a lot of them be a bite more like
S0037	but even the
S0115	do you do end up with a lower quality sometimes when when you've get when you've get a high demand
S0037	yeah but that mai i think that that we go to it be nice wasn't it but it wasn't like amaze go there last year

S0115	it's good that they link it up in the isn't it i mean it make it like a like a you know a proper european city you know like a proper european city
S0037	proper place well before that
S0115	yeah i mean cos like i think that there's a lot of english towns don't really have
S0037	yeah
S0115	decent enough like public transport in term of train
S0037	but i remember like get the bus from when i be live with me mam like i remember get the bus from where i live to the x two i think
S0115	that this be the south side of
S0037	and it use to it use to take ah easily an hour and a half like it's not that far away
S0115	it's like a massive chunk of map that be innit
S0037	no not really
S0115	it's across the a to z
S0037	must be twenty miles or something
S0115	it's it's a big it's like go from wolverhampton to coventry or something
S0037	no it's not that far sunderland and newcastle and like fifteen miles away
S0115	wolverhampton and and solihull maybe ay
S0037	sunderland and newcastle be fifteen miles away
S0115	yeah but you be on the south side of uh sunderland
S0037	yeah but that's not like ten miles out of sunderland be it
S0115	no
S0037	it's like one mile
S0115	yeah i know okay
S0037	three miles maybe
S0115	um
S0037	maybe three miles
S0115	yeah so uh sunderland have a couple of chinese restaurants in it doesn't it chinese buffet and that's something that we're lack here in cambridge that we don't have a chinese buffet do we
S0037	oh yeah panda i think there's one actually down at the
S0115	all you can eat
S0037	um
S0115	i bet there's some on road bet there be
S0115	so traditional chinese buffet you go in pay eight pound fifty
S0037	ten ten quid yeah
S0115	and you eat one of everything that they've get apart from the the prawn with the legs on cos you're squeamish
S0037	ohh
S0115	and uh i'm talk about one and what one days
S0037	you don't mean me
S0115	um go get get sausage and chip with curry sauce and uh
S0037	and maybe extra prawn toast no you can't do that
S0115	which you can do in some chinese buffet and um
S0037	i know you can in the one in newcastle you could you could get like chicken dippers and that chicken what they call turkey twizzlers
S0115	turkey twizzlers uh jamie oliver be uh try to to uh try to make chavs eat salads
S0037	that be good though when they bring that hotpot out when they bring that
S0115	the humiliation
S0037	when they bring that hotpot out and i just couldn't believe how many chilli like dry chillies be in it like
S0115	oh yeah the that hotpot be
S0037	i be just bemuse
S0115	cos cos with the hotpot you also get access to the to the regular buffet as well don't you
S0037	yeah that be so good
S0115	it's like you've get the hotpot buffet which be like a obviously it's a raw buffet
S0037	yeah
S0115	get your hotpot turn it set it onto uh there's different settings
S0037	cook yeah
S0115	there's different like they like eighty degrees be like
S0037	yeah soup
S0115	tea or something
S0037	it be like soup yeah there be a like a soup button wasn't there
S0115	sorta like that and then um and it go up to like hundred and fifty or
S0037	yeah
S0115	two hundred or something be like a really hot set um put your hotpot on get your it's get its own well there be two part of ours wasn't there there be two two halve
S0037	yeah it be like a separate bite
S0115	and um one of them be really hot it have about fifty little dry chillies float in it
S0037	that be medium as well you know
S0115	it be tremendously uh like it be okay but as long as you didn't eat
S0037	the chillies
S0115	if if you eat a whole chilli then
S0037	yeah
S0115	that be quite painful and if you eat fifty of them or something
S0037	ah it be so tasty i can still remember like i've get the picture from it
S0115	yeah brilliant wasn't it
S0037	we take some picture of it
S0115	they sort of the broth that they have like
S0037	like the chinese folk be laugh at us like uh take picture
S0115	i think that um they be it be just us and a big table of chinese sort of students or something
S0037	yeah
S0115	and uh and i sort of suspect that that they be talk about us in chinese
S0037	they definitely be
S0115	and laugh at us for be
S0037	it doesn't matter though i don't really care
S0115	because the cos there there weren't any other english people like i don't think many english people have the hoptpot
S0037	it be like apartheid yeah
S0115	well it's brilliant because it's um
S0037	but we should have get it before like why didn't we why didn't
S0115	it's like a raclette isn't it it's like a swiss
S0037	ah be we with me brother
S0115	i really wanna get one actually i wanna buy a hotpot
S0037	well i look for them i look for them on um
S0115	like a stave thing
S0037	all you can see be like they don't have the stave bite they just have like the some some of them have like the pot that you can plug in just the pot but it's not in like a like a hotplate thing so i'm maybe down mill road they'll have them i'll have to go and have a look but
S0115	um
S0037	but it be really nice
S0115	yeah i know it be it be delicious uh ah and in fact it's my favourite meal of the year i think
S0037	that be last last year
S0115	if not of the decade
S0037	of the century
S0115	include the previous decade um
S0037	it be really good your parent would really
S0115	that's a good that's a good task actually i'm i'm like
S0037	actually no i be gonna say your parent would like it but i dunno if they would because like they they they get a bite funny about share like they're not like communal
S0115	na they don't like um my dad doesn't really like
S0037	d'you remember when we have the tapas with them and he be like horrify

S0037	no i think he be just wasn't what he be use to
S0115	he he he's very vocal isn't he but i don't know if he really hat it
S0037	but i suppose though like if they just go for meals where like it's just you know like they go for curry a lot don't they or like you know like like normal restaurant pub food and stuff like then it be gonna be if you haven't do that before cos i don't think he'd have tapas and that before have he

S0115	oh right um yeah well uh yeah so there be an angry old woman and then there be like the the mother be like really like essexy i would've think
S0037	yeah
S0115	like really sort of spoily spoily and then there be the kid who be some you know little winston churchill wasn't he
S0037	and it be like he be like mummy i want a lobster and she be like get me a lobster
S0115	little little round but um
S0037	but they be shout at the chef weren't they for something can't even quite remember now it be age ago
S0115	they be complain that he wouldn't give um the the staff be annoy actually but the staff really didn't like him but for some reason they be they they didn't throw him out or anything but
S0037	yeah
S0115	i mean it be borderline like if you be staff you might consider throw him out except for the amount of money they be spend uh
S0037	be it because they didn't have what they want on the menu or something
S0115	i dunno like there be they want all the lobsters for themselves for the kid right cos he's a little kid he's gotta have his lobster hasn't he
S0037	ohh
S0115	you know uh we be gonna have lobster but i think the staff didn't want give them all the lobsters but they force them to give them
S0037	yeah
S0115	like every single lobster
S0037	i don't think we be gonna have lobster
S0115	i would've i would have probably have lobster like but i mean perhaps it's overrate actually
S0037	i think it be no but i think we'd hadn't choose that menu option
S0115	it be it it be delicious but the funny thing about teppanyaki be that um be the way that the the chef obviously cook in front of you and he actually play with you like he he sort of he sort of uh
S0037	yeah yeah yeah with the egg catch the egg in the hat
S0115	he do a little dance with his uh with his trowel that he's get with his hotplate
S0037	oh yeah
S0115	he tap his towel trowel on the on the hotplate and he um chop chop up some of the stuff's already the vegetables be already chop but he chop like
S0037	be that egg egg thing
S0115	he get his he he put his oil on get a bite of yeah put his oil on and crack the crack a couple of egg
S0037	garlic butter and that
S0115	get them go and get some rice out stir them in with the egg then he then he get some garlic out get some vegetables get his soy sauce and he's get like this butter
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	with like herb butter and he's get like uh various sauce like they've probably get some kind of uh
S0037	like a vinegary one
S0115	uh vinegar base sauce and soy sauce and uh uh some other spicy sauce and uh
S0037	can you smell a funny smell in here
S0115	and he play with it he like what
S0037	like burn
S0115	a bite i think it's come from uh come something something go on the uh kitchen maybe
S0037	kitchen yeah probably
S0115	yeah it do smell a bite burny doesn't it um yeah and he play he play with it he he sort of like he he say come and cut this egg and make an omelette he make a sheet of egg and he fold it over then he say use a trowel to chop that really fast
S0037	oh that's right yeah and he make you go like ting ting ting ting like that yeah
S0115	chop the chop the omelette up and uh
S0037	do he not make you throw an egg and catch it in the hat
S0115	i do it he throw he throw bits of egg and you have to catch it
S0037	that's right yeah
S0115	bits of omelette and and you catch it and uh and he sometimes try to throw things in his hat
S0037	that's right yeah
S0115	the uh chef's hat and
S0037	i think it be really good fun
S0115	yeah it's uh it's pretty cool like but the thing the funny another thing about it be like if you're sit round the hotplate so there's there's there's probably about eight seat round the square hotplate
S0037	yeah i think it'd be really good if it be a group
S0115	so that mean that you're gonna share like if you've if there's just four of you
S0037	yeah
S0115	that mean you're gonna share
S0037	with us two
S0115	with at least one of the group
S0037	yeah
S0115	of people that you don't know
S0037	i suppose you would wanna get like eight people to go wouldn't you
S0115	which be a slight with situation similar to in a resort where you share a in a pool uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	cos i be look at villas in uh spain and uh
S0037	yeah
