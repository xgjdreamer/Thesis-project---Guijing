S0589	ready we're about to start the path and go
S0588	mm
S0589	you might get tire
S0588	i might get tire yes we'll see cos this it's quite something for me really but look at this stun day blue sky and we get to look at the water cos we be lucky there's a ferry
S0589	it's high tide again
S0588	look it's the same time as yesterday
S0589	the first one to see
S0588	a duck
S0589	a duck
S0588	well thing be if i have the clip on microphone i wouldn't have to hold this
S0589	look the factory still have all its produce ship in in down the thames
S0588	yep
S0589	and unload on that pier there be a big boat yesterday on it on the pier
S0588	it's good your mum would love this oh
S0589	yes oh
S0588	gosh it's lovely it it be though look at that absolutely stun so i do like industrial scenes from a distance cos i think they're quite cool
S0589	doesn't look too far do it
S0588	it doesn't no if we want to go to we'll have to catch that ferry but i think get the ferry would be quite fun but where you actually end up i know it's north but what be in north
S0589	nothing just that
S0588	just that
S0589	those three block and the factory
S0588	yeah but then then but then if you want to er anything along the thames that side that's what we would do otherwise there's no other way of get across a bite like when we nearly end up
S0589	the darling
S0588	in north
S0589	yeah that's what we would have have to actually
S0588	yeah the thing be i would have think that yeah we would have have to get the
S0589	no but we would have get the er the the the ferry
S0588	yeah
S0589	the cross the ferry
S0588	but er which wouldn't have be that bad but a bite erm unexpected but if i hadn't be with you i would have think oh it's
S0589	ah yes you would have
S0589	you wouldn't have know what side
S0588	yeah well they didn't do they
S0589	you wouldn't have know what side of the river
S0588	well i didn't know there be a big difference but then you don't until a you've be somewhere for a long time i didn't know for age and age
S0589	it would be quite funny if the the bus do get on the ferry and take as across
S0588	but we actually only really get to know by the end of our time there i think
S0589	erm well the bite towards
S0588	and it gradually seep into your consciousness doesn't it
S0589	the bite towards erm we never really explore much
S0588	and we have just start to really
S0589	but that wasn't worth it until until the last couple of years
S0588	yeah there wasn't really anything there
S0589	well two thousand and twelve i suppose
S0588	it's true
S0589	but i would have go a lot of time
S0588	but actually
S0589	to the brewery where do you remember we have that lovely
S0588	yes
S0589	pizza and beer
S0588	er but road didn't really exist in its form that it exist now do it until erm we'd be there for about five years or so
S0589	lovely sound
S0588	i mean when do we actually start take that walk through the park and then go to road
S0589	didn't we always do that dearest
S0588	no we i don't think we do
S0589	well when be alive we didn't really do much at all do we
S0588	no we didn't so what do we do when
S0589	we watch that mini telly in your bedroom and
S0588	yeah
S0589	make love
S0588	but we must have do other things but i remember be the busy one and then we didn't really do anything
S0589	never even go in the garden
S0588	we never even go in the garden no so what be we do
S0589	i just say watch telly and have
S0588	yeah
S0589	relations
S0588	and sleep
S0589	plus remember you be work
S0588	nap
S0589	till midnight weren't you so
S0588	yeah
S0589	probably didn't get up until
S0588	and then just sleep at the weekend
S0589	late afternoon
S0588	as well
S0589	yeah
S0588	oh well that i mean that be quite nice really
S0589	yeah
S0588	but not ideal because it's nice to have a bite of a life but the thing about work full time like that be it just you don't really get one
S0589	and then then we become briefly wealthy
S0589	relatively wealthy
S0588	yeah we do you know we act like we be
S0589	wealthy
S0588	wealthy
S0589	didn't save a single penny
S0588	and didn't and bloody waste it but it be fun
S0589	yeah
S0588	and i use to go to primark every weekend and primarni and spend all my money
S0589	not at primark darling you be constantly come back with things from whistle and
S0588	oh yeah at that time yeah it depend what period we're look at
S0589	when we be wealthy
S0588	yeah okay that one bloody hell i know that oh every week i be go to whistle
S0589	yeah
S0588	that's crazy
S0589	i think you want a new dress every week
S0588	yeah
S0589	and you get one
S0588	but i mean actually i don't think i look particularly better than i
S0589	can i look at the swim pool
S0588	do oh i've not see it
S0589	nor have i well you can't really see in can you
S0588	oh that's the children's one that's nice
S0589	for baby
S0588	oh it's a bite of a shame that look really nice it's go isn't it
S0589	how many be in the big pool it doesn't look very busy
S0588	no oh we should go there that's fun you could go in the baby pool
S0589	oh and on this walk darling we'll pass the bouldering
S0588	yeah
S0589	climb thing
S0588	but isn't there some art studios somewhere
S0589	i
S0588	yeah i've hear there be some art studios
S0589	i think i'm more interest in bouldering as a mean of exercise for us
S0588	yeah no i be as well but
S0589	be there a swim pool through there too
S0588	the crucial thing be have a nice a nice route to wherever you're go because what's i find so off put be for example see this leisure centre along that busy road i have not want to go
S0589	look there's another pool
S0588	but if there's another way of
S0589	oh that that's a
S0588	get in
S0589	that's for er little children but not tiny ones
S0588	for example you could go and come this way instead of the other way you could walk through the
S0589	darling where do we go now
S0588	i'm not sure oh that's a shame
S0589	you have to just go round the ferry
S0588	mm interest down the step
S0589	it's much bigger this place than you give it think it be what's through there oh that's be the gym
S0588	it's an enormous thing to knock down
S0589	yeah
S0588	consider they probably only build it in the nineties
S0589	yeah look darling that's the gym
S0588	what a waste of money it's a shame it's break up isn't it still let's see what happen we have never try it before so it's quite excite
S0589	want to go up there
S0588	oh
S0589	or can we turn there
S0588	can we go what happen if we go that way look that look like the waterfront again
S0589	i think we're just erm oh that's where
S0588	that's where what
S0589	you board the ferry as a oh no it's not
S0588	no yeah well so what be that er erm well it's all very excite

S0589	pedestrian coverway
S0588	oh we could get an ice cream and eat it on the way look there's the

S0589	it's just in front of that
S0588	oh i know yeah
S0589	you can't really make it out to be honest but it's the sort of place they'd film poirot

S0589	gate community
S0588	do we miss the latest yeah what happen
S0589	well why didn't they build a little thing there in the jubilee
S0588	yeah well because the problem be it's very disjoint isn't it
S0588	it do
S0589	now we have to have our wits about us now
S0588	yeah
S0589	what direction we're walk
S0588	well if we just keep head to the right and we know that the thames be behind us
S0589	must be funny to have a little house here
S0588	so if we keep the north behind us
S0589	yes you see you're get it now darling
S0588	sort of
S0589	sort of
S0588	yeah still i still don't understand when and you're okay the thing that traumatise me that man on hampstead heath that get annoy with me
