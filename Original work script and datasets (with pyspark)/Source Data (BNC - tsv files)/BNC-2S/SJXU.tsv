S0115	oh yeah like i've get i mean double play like eight hours eight hours like so you can get four film on one tape
S0037	yeah my nana do yeah yeah
S0115	two hours each
S0037	um and i use to like you know really use to like sort of the neverending story and
S0115	oh yeah i never watch that actually the um
S0037	land before time
S0115	never watch it but land before time yeah cos we we actually get to see that at school uh there be like a
S0037	watership down and
S0115	there be a trip at school like to the cinema
S0037	yeah
S0115	um and i i be excite cos my parent didn't take me to the cinema and i'd never be to the cinema before
S0037	oh really no mine didn't really
S0115	uh so i'd never be to the cinema before like not not ever and i don't think and
S0037	i remember
S0115	think that be my first ever trip uh that the school take but like there be two group of us and like the older ones
S0037	yeah
S0115	like get to see like like a pg rat film
S0037	yeah
S0115	um and the younger um include me go to see a u rat film which happen to be land before time
S0037	oh that's a good one
S0115	i think but but i think actually that be the better of the two like the the pg one be call mac and me
S0037	oh right
S0115	uh this would've be like nineteen eighty nine or nineteen ninety
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	nineteen eighty or ninety two or something but uh yeah i think we i think we do better to get
S0037	land before time be a good one
S0115	wait wait a minute no it be it would be younger than oh i can't remember
S0037	well
S0115	i've really really bad memory of my uh childhood to be honest uh
S0037	well it be a long time ago way
S0115	it's just black it's just black out like
S0037	no
S0115	uh it's there's too too many things that uh i don't wanna remember
S0037	i remember my nana and granddad my nana and granddad take us to the picture once and like me and my nana want to see one film and my granddad and our tom want to see another film so we go to see different ones and i remember think that be really like really good because like usually it would just be like with my dad or with my mam so you couldn't split it up and like i'd have to sit through like
S0037	transformer
S0115	steven steven seagal oh yeah yeah
S0037	but like me and my nana go to see little women and my nana be like it's amaze and i be like
S0115	what be that
S0037	little women come on
S0115	what be that
S0037	it's a book like you've read the have you maybe you haven't it's more of a girls' book
S0115	it sound to me like i think of uh big men be more up my street than little women
S0037	yeah maybe big men be right up your street
S0115	i think uh if if something be call little women i would would suspect that it might be like a romantic comedy or something
S0037	yeah it be a bite floppy
S0115	um no but i i don't romantic comedies
S0037	it's one of those classics though
S0115	i think we be talk about them a couple of days ago actually
S0037	yeah bridget jones
S0115	you're you you you don't like um you don't like them do you
S0037	no no but i mean
S0115	be that what little women be what's it about
S0037	well it's a story about some like four sisters and the dad's go off to the american civil war
S0115	alright fight the carpet baggers what side be he on
S0037	uh i don't know but they like do various things like there's like one of them who want to be a writer and she go off to the city to be a writer and then oh there's a man who live next door and he like them but they don't like him oh but just just
S0115	oh i think i'm gonna find myself uh slip slip into
S0037	it's like a it's like a jane no no no that's the end of the story it's like a jane austen esque but not as excite i suppose
S0115	oh right
S0037	but anyway it's um go to see that and but yeah but i didn't go to the cinema very much didn't really
S0115	i go uh i go for a bite like i get uh take get take by my parent a bite when uh when i be in like
S0037	i go on a like a date once to the cinema
S0115	ha ha
S0037	and i remember think it be the stupidest place to go because like
S0115	well yeah it be yeah it's it's one of the probably most common like child child date destinations innit
S0037	it's so bad and stupid but i be like fifteen or whatever and i go to see you know liar liar with jim carey
S0115	yeah yeah that's a that's a sort of typical
S0037	be quite a good film actually
S0115	yeah
S0037	but it's just like well it's totally pointless you may as well just sit on your own for an two hours it be entirely pointless
S0115	but it be a bite silly actually isn't it cos you basically just sit next to each other
S0037	you should never go to the cinema with anyone that you like because there's no point it's like you can you can't speak to them you can't see them if you whisper something to them everyone else get piss off
S0115	people do though don't they they always go look for like
S0037	like when we watch film i'm always like hey so be that the guy that's do this that's do that or what's happen then what's happen now like you can't do any of that at the cinema cos you piss everyone else off
S0115	no i think my favourite way to watch a film would be yeah to like to be able to talk through it and like pause it and like
S0037	yeah rewind it yeah
S0115	yeah let's watch this bite yeah yeah yeah definitely let's watch this bite again like and uh and in that bar i be talk about like you know my favourite my favourite bar in the world you know the the
S0037	yeah in berlin
S0115	there be next to it be a room call that they call the multikulti room
S0037	right
S0115	and they would put they they would screen film and you can do exactly that like
S0037	yeah
S0115	it not only be the best bar in the world but also have like
S0037	best cinema in the world
S0115	like a a good cinema where you could sort of i think the best for me like it's all about like the best the best bar the best cinema be about like you can do what you want with it you know like
S0037	yeah well i've quite
S0115	it's about it's about allow people to do it's about give people the the power and opportunity to do what they want
S0037	yeah
S0115	and uh and a lot of that doesn't happen in uh in bar and cinemas like you're kind of stick in like
S0037	no that's true
S0115	yeah with a cinema you're kind of stick there aren't you
S0037	cos like and like you know go to the loo be due you know in two hours it's natural that you would wanna at least pop to the loo once and like that's why it's sort of
S0115	yeah i mean it it's if your mat you would wanna get you and your mat uh quite a few of them and then just watch a a film like that you know in in one of your house like and that's the sort of thing
S0037	yeah
S0115	problem be like there's a bite of an incentive to yeah get talk about economics again but uh there's a bite of an incentive in the economy to to to against that you know what i mean
S0037	yeah
S0115	what be at fifteen have we do fifteen
S0037	nine
S0115	oh uh there's a bite of an incentive against do things yourself at home um and in favour of spend more money because of the need for for more for more growth and more money in the economy so that like maybe people like the kinds of bar i be talk about they're not not particularly profitable
S0037	yeah no no no
S0115	in term of the economy
S0037	well
S0115	um and a lot of that the bar thing would have an element of cash in hand ness about it and i think it do you know you when when you be say you'd keep some of the profit for yourself like the the the cinema screen thing that i be talk about be like that be free so there be no money in that so that economically speak they you know the government might wanna might wanna dissuade people from do that
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	from spend their time without spend money you know what i mean
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh and also in the bar yeah i think you would take the money for the beers and you be allow to keep a certain share of the profit and clearly that clearly that's cash in hand like i think you're not you're you're unlikely to uh i think
S0037	yeah pay tax on that and everything
S0115	i i i i'm not i'm not sure but i i imagine that you would collect all the money up and then like
S0037	yeah
S0115	i think you would no i i don't know actually i i suppose it's it's it would surely possibly be illegal to uh
S0037	well i don't know
S0115	to uh i just felt like it be like
S0037	maybe if it's a private institution like maybe it's
S0115	not tax um
S0037	something separate but i dunno
S0115	um no not i'm not sure about that actually i i guess they would have to write they would have to write everything down and therefore they could be liable for tax on that but but yeah be it it be a it be a it be a uni
S0037	yeah
S0115	bar so
S0037	well it's probably subsidize anyway
S0115	it may have some kind of yeah it may have so yeah no i don't think it be it be cash in hand like as much as i say but but i think it would've would've be subsidize yeah
S0037	yeah dodgy yeah
S0115	but i be talk about um you see how like economics be you know like all this sort of profit be great on the one hand but on the other hand like some of the better things sometimes the better things be
S0037	yeah
S0115	be not be you know best things be free aren't they you know sometimes
S0037	yeah i think i tend to do most of my
S0115	like uh you know you would record there's a problem like you record a film and then you just
S0037	yeah
S0115	pass it like you copy it you video it and you pass it round you're your friends and that
S0037	pass it round yeah i tend to do most
S0115	that's bad for the economy cos then they're not spend money on that film be they
S0037	no
S0115	you know what i mean so it's it's a bite of a there's a bite of a collision conflict between um
S0037	i tend to do most of my film watch at um christmas like tend to not really watch that many film not not recent film
S0115	yeah well we we're very lucky to have we're we're lucky to have like you know your your dad's fondness of dvds and he buy all these or he get them from on quite cheap doesn't he because he sort of temporarily get them or something
S0037	but he buy no but he buy them ex rental so
S0115	i see yeah so he get them quite cheap doesn't he
S0037	like he go to like you know blockbuster or whatever
S0115	i've hear of it
S0037	and um you know they have like you know they rent out dvds and well everything um game and that as well but they they rent out like dvds and stuff and um so once they've be rent out for however long
S0115	yeah
S0037	then you can just buy them for like two quid or something because obviously they've be like play load of time but well like my dad say like doesn't really matter how many time they've be play you know it's a dvd isn't it like it doesn't run out after a hundred play like
S0115	yeah i mean
S0037	they can't sell if it's if it doesn't work you know
S0115	you know like that uh bring me onto actually uh the pirate party a bite actually cos uh
S0037	yeah actually
S0115	it's it's quite big news in europe in german and like europe but no one yeah i've never hear the i've never hear them mention in england really like
S0037	i've never really hear much about it like you keep talk about it and like
S0115	but they're quite they've win like a they've win something in um in germany like the pirate party
S0037	so what be their value like piece of eight
S0115	i think they they don't really have any value apart from that you should be able to like
S0037	plunder
S0115	it's to do with get film like it's to do with pirate um
S0037	piracy
S0115	it's to do with like internet piracy particularly like film and and music i think and and they they believe that like film should be should be freely share after a certain amount of time or something
S0037	piraty
S0115	so they're perhaps have a certain they have an anti copyright uh agenda um which i find
S0037	but you can't get in like you can't win like something base on just one narrow
S0115	well no they don't just have one uh i mean essentially they're they're i think there's an element of like um you know an a a marginal anti capitalism or some kind of centre leave
S0037	yeah
S0115	vibe there that they have as well although i'm not sure they they're sort of i don't know actually like i think they've get a strong like liberal you know libertarian sort of feel about them like that they wouldn't want to uh to be honest i don't know um but i know that they be
S0037	cos you can't surely base like a political party on just one like fairly narrow um
S0115	yes you can uh
S0037	well like bnp ie other
S0115	but uh you you you can if people vote for you if there's a market if people if people will vote for a narrow one issue party then then that's what's gonna happen like and uh if if obviously
S0037	well
S0115	ukip be the be the sort of the typically might be describe as one one issue
S0037	oh i hate all those
S0115	one issue party um uh it's it's many they're just
S0037	no because and not stick up for ukip cos to be fair i think they're absolute donkeys but
S0115	i'll stick up for the british empire
S0037	no but they have like they what i'm say be though that their their spread of um value be a tiny bite wider than just piracy cos like uk independence or whatever the crazy
S0115	oh be there any more of that down there
S0037	no whatever the crazy uh sorry um whatever the crazy thing be that they're after
S0115	yeah
S0037	um it's slightly wider than piracy isn't it
S0115	um yeah no no they they have other things as well like they they have like oh but i i don't know i just know that they that it be like a new movement come out as a result of the the there be a bite of a problem isn't there in the the economy that that it's become very easy to to freely transfer any information so that would include any movie or theatre or or music or
S0037	yeah share things yeah well what there be that young lad who be extradite to the us wasn't he he have like a film share thing
S0115	i don't know i don't
S0037	he be a student he be from sheffield i think
S0115	oh right oh yeah maybe
S0037	and he be i can't exactly remember all the ins and out of it but
S0115	they they have a thing in didn't they they have in they have like a like a peer to peer um
S0037	oh
S0115	a peer to peer program that um you know some programmers that uh
S0037	oh it's yours
S0115	uh could well be my uh

S0115	you've read the wikipedia page no no you've spoil it man
S0037	no but you see you didn't wanna you say you didn't watch it anymore
S0115	i don't really like it though i it's in it's in the way of something else uh something more important like benidorm
S0037	yeah it be actually what be we do we should've watch
S0115	we're miss benidorm
S0037	but benidorm's on the plus one though that's the good thing we can watch it at ten
S0115	ah yeah well we'll we'll watch it on the we'll watch it at ten yeah
S0037	i'll just see i'll just check um yeah but i i just think
S0115	it's alright it get positive review
S0037	i didn't know i didn't know if i could commit to like to like ten more episodes of homeland i be get a bite bore of it anyway
S0115	yeah i think i don't think i don't
S0037	but i like the story
S0115	i don't fancy have to watch like like whole series of it you know like american twenty two episode series
S0037	but i like the i like the um i like the story though you know even towards the end
S0115	i felt it include i felt like a bite of turn into a bite of you know granddad but i you know like i felt it include a little bite too much sex
S0037	it do it be quite explicit but like not very much
S0115	uh to the extent that you you can't no i'm not i'm not a i'm not a granddad about about sex on the tv
S0037	mhm
S0115	but uh i felt that in that in the show it wasn't relevant to terrorism and espionage
S0037	no i i think some bits be like i think like the bits like where he you know like stuff with his wife where it be show that he wasn't adjust to be home
S0115	oh yeah yeah yeah if it's if it's if it's part of the story you know yeah just a total granddad aren't i uh
S0037	like i think some of those bits you're a bite granddaddy no no no by no mean like
S0115	if it's if it's part of the uh
S0037	but there be bits where like it be you know it be by what happen it be quite obvious that he hadn't he hadn't adjust to like to be at home um that's right over there now
S0115	uh
S0037	it's like the same colour as the carpet uh back a bite
S0115	oh yeah
S0037	yeah um so there be some bits where it be like quite obvious that it be it do say something about the story but there be other bits where it be just like yeah right like a bite gratuitous
S0115	a lot gratuitous
S0037	yeah so anyway
S0115	anyway that's not even that's not even apart from the granddad aspect uh
S0037	but yeah so i i think like
S0115	it's kinda implausible i think
S0037	i'd really like stop myself from watch all the rest
S0115	but the interest thing be that
S0037	uh sorry what stop myself from
S0115	the interest thing be it be originally um israeli and it it have like a it come from an israeli series that they'd already make
S0037	oh really

S0037	i read the wikipedia page and i didn't even get that
S0115	but it say it right at the begin
S0037	must've skim that bite
S0115	it's the the the israeli title mean something like um um it it it doesn't mean it's not call that in in in hebrew it's call like another word
