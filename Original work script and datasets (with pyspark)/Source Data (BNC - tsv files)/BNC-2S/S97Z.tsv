S0192	it's all go though mate
S0195	you must have live quite frugally in those two years
S0192	no we do we do live pretty frugally i've live frugally since since uni
S0195	yeah
S0192	and i'm still i've be a student the whole bloody time
S0195	and it's not gonna change throughout this year i wouldn't have though
S0192	we save fifteen k
S0195	yeah
S0192	and six grand
S0195	between you
S0192	no each
S0195	yeah
S0192	so fifteen grand each
S0195	so you be thirty grand
S0192	we have thirty grand between us but we put down so i'll just talk about my money cos 's do exactly the same i have fifteen i put down six thousand on the on one year's tuition for the ma
S0195	yeah
S0192	six grand i want to go to edinburgh but that change
S0195	so do the same
S0192	it to eight grand so she do the same
S0195	so that's twelve go
S0192	so that put me down yeah so six out of my fifteen i get nine
S0195	mm
S0192	i've already whack them about seven grand on the rent that's pay eight months up front
S0195	yeah
S0192	and basically and i be go to have about four or five grand leave for bill for live for it's enough for about a hundred pound a week each for the whole year basically
S0195	yeah
S0192	which be enough to live on and be comfortable but if i wanna start do shit
S0195	yeah which you will
S0192	like i need i need this money from this job
S0195	yeah yeah basically
S0192	so
S0195	and probably get a part time job as well
S0192	yeah but when we go to saudi after this apparently we can save double what we be save in korea in saudi
S0195	oh really
S0192	so i could i could save about fifteen grand in one year
S0195	really
S0192	er yeah man no joke
S0195	so what you must have be save then so what you've save fifteen grand in two years so you be save about five hundred quid a month
S0192	yeah it be about seven hundred but bear in mind
S0195	yeah
S0192	i've do i've be travel and do stuff
S0195	yeah exactly yeah
S0192	on in that time but i be save about seven hundred quid a month and apparently in saudi you could save about fifteen hundred a month
S0195	so what be you net then
S0192	er not very much i be only i take a bite pay cut in my last job so you know i be work at the uni
S0195	yeah
S0192	i go down i be on when i be at the public school i'd be there for a while so my pay be up at like two point seven million
S0195	yeah
S0192	which be about eighteen thousand pound
S0195	mm
S0192	i take a pay cut down to two point two million and i go down to about fourteen thousand pound
S0195	right
S0192	i lose my flight home i lose my renewal allowance
S0195	why do you take that though because of the cv
S0192	the job be better yeah for my cv
S0195	mm
S0192	and i didn't have any office hours so
S0195	it seem crazy though that the job's better but you're pay less
S0192	yeah yeah because it's more want it's more desire
S0195	yeah
S0192	and a lot of the people there do like extra hours like er i do some proofread so i get extra money for like proofread people's phd theses and all that kind of stuff
S0195	oh right yeah
S0192	but i didn't rake in much extra
S0195	no
S0192	so i reckon one year cost and i about four grand each like four five grand each
S0195	oh really
S0192	yeah take that job so that wasn't like a big pay cut
S0195	right so so you weren't save seven hundred a month then
S0192	no no i be save about five hundred and a half
S0195	four yeah
S0192	for that last two so more in the first year less in the second year
S0195	yeah
S0192	and we're gonna do a year here and then and then try and get to saudi i guess or somewhere
S0195	yeah and that's therefore you're get marry
S0192	yeah that's why
S0195	pure it's purely an administrative procedure
S0192	basically yeah basically
S0195	who say romance be dead
S0192	we have to sign the paper well that's why i propose you know what i mean
S0195	mm
S0192	cos and i be talk very practically and pragmatically about marry and like how we're gonna do it how we can do it cheaply why we need to do it and i turn around at this point and think that's not very romantic be it
S0195	no
S0192	you know what i mean we're gonna get marry but there's nothing else there i find her a wooden ring like online
S0195	yeah
S0192	and get it engrave with the day we meet
S0195	yeah
S0192	which be the same day i meet you actually
S0195	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	on the twenty fourth of september
S0195	yeah
S0192	erm and then i propose to her in the nicest place i could so
S0195	yeah
S0192	at least she get something kind of romantic
S0195	yeah by a bin
S0192	yes i know there be a bin there be a bin
S0195	that's the one i have to mention
S0192	yeah i know
S0195	by a bin
S0192	i couldn't
S0195	just in case it go wrong
S0192	couldn't photograph it be pretty apart from that yeah it wasn't too bad
S0195	yeah it be yeah it be a beautiful place yeah i love it mate
S0192	but if we get marry it would just be our you know what mean
S0195	and will you do it in england
S0192	erm probably in
S0195	yeah
S0192	it will probably just be my mum and my dad
S0195	this so this year
S0192	her mum and her dad
S0195	oh really and that'll be it
S0192	and it would be yeah in in in april or may next year
S0195	oh i wouldn't mind come along mate
S0192	yeah i mean i'll i'll have to see what's go on
S0195	yeah
S0192	at the minute we're kind of say cos the problem be i think well i've only get one full brother so like
S0195	yeah
S0192	he can come along but then if we say siblings can come that that mean 's get three brothers
S0195	yeah
S0192	and they have wive
S0195	yeah
S0192	and they have children and then it just start add up
S0195	and before you know it
S0192	load of fuck people
S0195	you've get a hundred people come to your wed
S0192	yeah so i mean i guess we could have my parent and her parent and we'll just sign the paper and then afterwards we could have a bite of a party or something with anyone that come want to come down to and do it
S0195	yeah
S0192	but it's not even definite because if and i don't go to the middle east if we get a job in kazakhstan or somewhere else you know what i mean
S0195	mm
S0192	then we won't need to get marry and therefore we won't so
S0195	oh really
S0192	in our eye we be marry you know
S0195	well yeah you've make all the same kind of commitments haven't you
S0192	well yes well we have a joint bank account
S0195	yeah
S0192	we've live together for ten years we've well almost ten years can you believe that
S0195	yeah it's amaze
S0192	almost fuck ten years yeah nine years
S0195	but do you get a joint back account for come over here or have you have it a while
S0192	actually i tell you a lie i'm just about to get one
S0195	yeah
S0192	i'm just about to get one because
S0195	and i have get one as well
S0192	yeah i the problem be when we're live
S0195	it's just easier
S0192	when we're live abroad and i do you want one another cigarette
S0195	erm yeah well i'll go for a a cigarette definitely
S0192	yeah cool erm so what be i talk about
S0195	erm
S0192	problem with oh joint back account
S0195	joint bank
S0192	so basically with the joint bank account while we're live abroad now they owe we another month's pay
S0195	right
S0192	they owe me my final i'm actually on vacation at the minute
S0195	yeah
S0192	so i'm get pay
S0195	oh right
S0192	so they owe me my august pay i do just receive that yesterday
S0195	yeah
S0192	and they owe me we get a bonus month's pay
S0195	right okay
S0192	in korea it's like labour law so you do twelve months
S0195	oh really
S0192	you get a thirteenth month free
S0195	oh really so like a bonus
S0192	yeah yeah it's just just as their rule
S0195	yeah
S0192	it's like their labour law saudi do it as well so it's pretty useful
S0195	right
S0192	so erm we erm i need a book or something so what be i say we labour law erm
S0195	joint bank account
S0192	joint bank account we owe we get charge about thirty to fifty pound every time i transfer money home
S0195	yeah
S0192	every single time and that's a bite annoy so if we have a joint bank account right now they could potentially put mine and 's money in one bank account and we only get charge once
S0195	right
S0192	but because we're separate we've gonna get charge both thirty quid for august pay
S0195	yeah
S0192	and then both thirty quid for the bonus pay so it's like a hundred a twenty quid in charge
S0195	yeah man
S0192	you know what i mean
S0195	it's really annoy
S0192	which we pay we pay like sixty quid a month in charge it's a bite annoy but yeah i mean once you take off rent rent's a massive
S0195	yeah and well you weren't pay that out there be you
S0192	no weren't pay any rent
S0195	it's a massive expenditure
S0192	we weren't pay yeah yeah weren't even pay bill in
S0195	so if you be pay rent you wouldn't have be able to save that money basically
S0192	no no no although rent be cheaper there than it be here
S0195	yeah
S0192	but you would have still take out some some more money for sure and like this last job we didn't even pay bill er nothing
S0195	no
S0192	no it be all completely comp we live on the university campus
S0195	yeah
S0192	we have fairly good size like kind of two room of this size next door to each other
S0195	yeah
S0192	and it be erm
S0195	i bet it's nice to get nice in the british culture which you've be out for a while
S0192	yeah yeah definitely it's change a little bite
S0195	cos it's a bite of a bite of a crazy culture isn't it in korea
S0192	yeah
S0195	particularly south korea
S0192	yeah no we
S0195	but so westernise at the same time
S0192	mm
S0195	but it they're just massive drinkers aren't they
S0192	they be really no a proper alcoholic yeah
S0195	proper alcoholics
S0192	i need to cut down cos it's be ridiculous
S0195	proper like salary men
S0192	yeah
S0195	know what i mean but if you look at south korea's economic growth over the last erm ten years
S0192	yeah
S0195	it's the most develop
S0192	yeah no it really be
S0195	country in asia like even it dwarf china in that respect
S0192	yeah yeah it's crazy how much they've come on in fifty years be insane because
S0195	mm
S0192	i mean fifty years ago it be the poorest country in asia
S0195	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	pretty much like korea and nowadays it's
S0195	it's now they've get the highest erm one of the highest anyway of gross domestic products
S0192	yeah
S0195	in asia
S0192	yeah
S0195	i mean china have get quite a
S0192	they export a lot
S0195	they export load
S0192	a lot of samsung
S0195	yeah
S0192	a lot of boat posco steelworks and all this kind of stuff
S0195	yeah
S0192	we get actually the amount of foreigners that be live there now be on the up and up there's a lot more people live there
S0195	yeah
S0192	erm they do some things right they do like if you go into a in korea mate
S0195	yeah
S0192	you will get a new card if you want one on the spot they will make it for you right there and then
S0195	really
S0192	you just get it it's none of this two weeks in the post bullshit you know
S0195	yeah yeah yeah and then they'll send it you separately and everything
S0192	you know you go to a cash machine you can transfer to anyone's bank on the cash machine like that you can pay all your bill on the cash machine
S0195	really
S0192	you can you can put a deposit physical money in the cash machine and like put it into your bank account
S0195	yeah
S0192	some of their service be better however some things they do be completely back to front
S0195	really
S0192	like just really retard
S0195	like what example
S0192	i mean you hear about these children die on this boat didn't you
S0195	oh yeah yeah
S0192	three hundred children die
S0195	yeah
S0192	they basically do that because the captain tell them to stay still so they do so three hundred children didn't move on didn't evacuate a sink ship so by the time the people get there to evacuate them they be still inside the boat have tip
S0195	stand still
S0192	the boat have tip over they couldn't get out the have they just think use a bite of common sense
S0195	evacuate
S0192	you know what i mean and evacuate like anyone in the west would have do
S0195	mm
S0192	they wouldn't have all die but they didn't
S0195	they be try to
S0192	they be follow order
S0195	calm yeah
S0192	it be part of their have you hear of confucius
S0195	no
S0192	confucius be this famous chinese philosopher
S0195	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0192	and and basically a lot of culture in asia be confucian
S0195	yeah
S0192	they believe in the hierarchy they believe like father to son you know mother to daughter teacher to student
S0195	yeah
S0192	all these kind of like roles
S0195	which be why it's sort of a very respectable society
S0192	yeah yeah absolutely
S0195	yeah
S0192	so unfortunately that have its negative and everyone die in a fuck ship
S0195	yeah it be a prime example
S0192	be one of them yeah it's pretty bad
S0195	but a positive of that i bet you get no shit when you be teach in school i bet they be have your devout attention
S0192	erm to a certain degree
S0195	mm
S0192	erm we're afford less respect as a foreigner than we be as a normal teacher so like i always make sure that i dress as smart as i could
S0195	yeah
S0192	so like that help with my respect and all that kind of stuff
S0195	mm
S0192	and obviously i be in a public school for three years
S0195	yeah
S0192	so it's a public school so there's obviously gonna be some bad i have a brick throw through my classroom window once
S0195	do you really
S0192	yeah they're they're quite unruly they're not as as well behave as you think they would
S0195	really
S0192	because i think i've tell you before they all go to like private school and stuff
S0195	yeah
S0192	so basically the students consider that private that public school isn't really worth your time you know you learn the real stuff in private school like after hours public school be just day care we're just look after the children so they
S0195	oh what so they all go to private or after the school
S0192	it suck mate the average high school student go to school at seven o'clock finish at six o'clock have a one hour break and then go to a private school until midnight or one o'clock
S0195	and then do homework
S0192	and they go to do homework go to sleep do the same thing every day they study for you know fourteen hours a day or something
S0195	there's too much that isn't it
S0192	it be too much
S0195	that be too much like there's only so much your brain can absorb
S0192	no absolutely
S0195	you know there's a there's a limit
S0192	and then they come to school and they fall asleep i mean it's do i tell you about the time
S0195	do they actually do that
S0192	no yeah do i tell you the time i have my first ever time i invigilate exams be in my high school and we be do the english exam and i be put with the head of english
S0195	mm
S0192	naturally he couldn't speak any english
S0195	yeah
S0192	but that's see he's the head of english and can't speak any english he i see this student about ten minutes into the exam have fall he's fall asleep on his desk
S0195	yeah
S0192	it's a two hour exam and i'm think there's no way he's finish his paper you know what i mean so i kinda look over at the the head of english and he he look at the student and i look at the student he give me a nod and he's kinda i understand he very slowly walk around behind the student
S0195	mm
S0192	stand behind the sleep student look at me again as if to get acknowledgement be this the right student i give him a nod
S0195	yeah
S0192	yeah it be he's he punch the student full force twice in the head
S0192	just in the fuck head the student go ah grab his pen start to write
S0195	and start write and what's he even write he's just pretend
S0192	i yeah just pretend
S0195	be you pretend to write
S0192	be you pretend to write
S0192	kellogg's crunchy nut pretty expensive as i recall we're not try to kill him we're not try to kill you just it sushi it's mean to be raw
S0192	i watch that one the other day
S0195	do you really
S0192	my brother have get into peep show he never like it before and i sit down and watch that in nine episodes with him in a row with with a bite of this and it be quite
S0195	yeah
S0192	it be quite funny he enjoy it
S0192	yeah
S0195	yeah it be nice beer
S0192	yeah yeah definitely i'm enjoy it i haven't have a kronen but you can't get these in korea
S0195	can you not
S0192	mm
S0195	i do like a kronen
S0192	actually that's a lie
S0192	more recently they've start stock them but i mean you're gonna pay like two pound a can for
S0195	mm
S0192	for this thing actually produce in korea can be ridiculous pick up a carrot okay it's a big fuck carrot
S0195	mm
S0192	but this can cost like two pound fifty for one carrot
S0195	no way
S0192	yeah
S0195	oh really
S0192	bag of the problem be that it's everything's really seasonal
S0195	yeah
S0192	i'm find in england it's fairly fix like year round but it change a little bite
S0195	yeah we you know we import it
S0192	but yeah but not too much korea you go for like one kilo of potatoes one month be six pound
S0195	yeah
S0192	six pound for a kilo of potatoes
S0195	mm
S0192	the next month it's like a pound fifty p
S0195	really
S0192	yeah
S0195	well actually mate our last winter there be four fail harvest the year before
S0192	yeah
S0195	cos the summer be the really bad and load of potatoes get like rot and stuff in the field erm so consequently last winter potatoes be almost like five quid a bag they're like four pound seventy or something
S0192	oh just
S0195	but just normal size two kilo bag of potatoes
S0192	the massive potato famine
S0195	oh my god i think i actually think of you i think if be in england now he'd be go spare over the price of potatoes
S0195	and cheese be relative cheap at the minute and all dairy in fact so i don't know why so you can get a big thing from tesco's for like a bite what be it be it two and a half litres or whatever of of milk
S0192	yeah
S0195	and it's a quid
S0192	that's pretty good
S0195	which be a bargain an absolute bargain
S0192	yeah it be i be actually quite impress because of how expensive korea be
S0195	yeah
S0192	when i come back to england and i think i go to lidl's with my mum or something and like okay the quality of product isn't as good there but it be cheap
S0195	yeah
S0192	you could get like a
S0195	yeah
S0192	five hundred gram pack of beef mince
S0195	and actually no
S0192	for like two pound or something
S0195	and the quality of product in like lidl nowadays be actually really good
S0192	it seem okay
S0195	my parent shop in aldi all the time
S0192	yeah i think
S0195	my dad absolutely love it
S0192	i think it's just whether that's all there's nothing wrong with it
S0195	no
S0192	so erm yeah i and i find the aldi up near erm or wherever it be
S0195	oh it's a massive mission
S0192	beyond the train station and then we don't have very good access to supermarkets
S0195	no i be think that
S0192	we have to go all the way down the hill i think we do when i stick it on a map but when you actually walk there's kind of things in the way
S0195	yeah
S0192	like the train station which
S0192	so with the we go all the way down you know to that main high street
S0195	yeah
S0192	what's the road call that main road that's get
S0195	er erm
S0192	be that
S0195	yeah yeah
S0192	run across where waitrose and all
S0192	waitrose be a bite pricey so we didn't go there
S0195	oh no don't don't bother
S0192	but
S0195	i never go there
S0192	we go we go down by the train station and down that road that go down under the train station
S0195	yeah
S0192	you know what mean and then that be kind of like a quite a bohemian look road that one i don't know what that's call
S0195	yeah yeah yeah very cool
S0192	and then we take a turn and there's like a sainsbury's erm an aldi
S0195	mm
S0192	and another one i can't remember what it's call
S0195	yeah
S0192	erm so we go shop there but yeah it's not that close for
S0195	yeah so if i be you and live here and didn't have a car or anything i would probably consider do my shop online
S0192	yeah i consider that what's it like shop online
S0195	i don't know i've never do it
S0192	no i've never do it
S0195	i've never do it and the reason why be because i've get tesco's quite close
S0192	yeah
S0195	and i actually if i can i do prefer to go there and pick stuff and look at sell by date so
S0192	get the fresh produce there
S0195	and you you know get what you want and sometimes there's random things but if you're on a budget it's actually quite good because you can control exactly how much you're spend and
S0192	yeah
S0195	you can put stuff back it's not like you're walk round the supermarket you're not really you haven't get a clue how much you're spend
S0192	no
S0195	do you know what i mean
S0192	yeah yeah definitely
S0195	so it's good
S0192	be it on the way on on there's a erm there's a sainsbury's superstore or something
S0195	yeah
S0192	apparently and that's only about a kilometre and a half from here
S0195	yeah
S0192	and i don't i haven't cycle it yet but it's on the way to the uni so i'm think maybe i can kind of stop off there after i'm hop to cycle to uni as much as possible if i can
S0195	yeah and it it's really accessible i mean the only time you won't want to cycle to uni be if it's piss it down
S0192	which be er almost every day
S0195	and then you can just get the bus cos you're on the bus
S0192	oh right
S0195	mate before you come back it's be lovely
S0192	yeah i know i come back
S0195	the weather's be so good
S0192	and it's just it's like autumn's kick in or something you know
S0195	yeah yeah it pretty much have
S0192	whatever actually to tell you honestly i don't mind the weather at the minute it's nice to be a bite cooler and er all the kind of stuff
S0195	yeah exactly yeah 's appreciate it obviously be heavily pregnant as she be
S0192	yeah she doesn't want to be like sweat ball or anything
S0195	no exactly that
S0192	yeah
S0195	no it's like er get another beer
S0192	you need to be in brighton of course you can mate
S0195	do you want one
S0192	er i haven't finish that one yet
S0195	oh right sorry mate i'm still a quick drinker
S0192	no it's all good i've only get four mate
S0195	oh have you oh i can always pop
S0192	i'll grab some more
S0195	oh cool yeah get some more there's
S0192	i think you wouldn't be around too long but you drink you drink fairly quickly so
S0195	well yeah that's it and you know as much as i try and not get drink at the minute you know
S0192	it's not as easy as it sound
S0195	be er get a yeah i you know i just don't wanna get absolutely shitfaced
S0192	no no of course
S0195	you know i don't mine er it be a bite tipsy or whatever
S0192	yeah yeah
S0195	but ideally i'd still like to be able to drive but it's not gonna be the end of the world if we have to get a taxi
S0192	no no get a taxi
S0195	as long as i'm compos mentis and the thing i have to ask myself if go into labour right now would i be able to deal with that full on fuck situation
S0192	yeah you have to keep say that
S0195	do you know what i mean
S0195	no
S0192	it's gonna be intense you're not go to do a and like pop out to the kfc or whatever i think i'll get a family bucket
S0195	no no definitely not
S0192	it's a good one
S0195	get to be there so we do this erm nct course which be the national childbirth trust and it's an antenatal course
S0192	oh okay
S0195	so you get a certain amount of antenatal course free on the nhs we didn't do those erm we basically pay a hundred and eighty quid for this course
S0192	yeah
S0195	which i think be a right rip off at the time i think there's no way i really didn't wanna do this course at a hundred and eighty quid
S0192	what can they teach you
S0195	well what can they teach you that the nhs one isn't gonna do
S0192	yeah or i can't pick up on the internet or
S0195	yeah i really didn't wanna do it really do wanna do it so as a compromise we do it
S0192	yeah
S0192	not much of a compromise be it
S0195	yeah i compromise
S0192	yeah basically
S0195	i compromise my position
S0192	i bet
S0195	but anyway we we go to this course and it be two full saturdays and one even and do you know what this course be absolutely brilliant
S0192	oh
S0195	it teach me so much yeah i be really ill prepare for and this course it it be it be excellent i can recommend it highly enough
S0192	that's good that you recommend it so highly
S0195	and if you think it about it actually
S0192	be you sure you're not a salesman
S0195	oh yeah no no i i think if you think about it a hundred and eighty quid for two people to go on a two full day course with one even
S0192	no it's pretty good
S0195	that's a good deal
S0192	yeah definitely what kind of things do you learn then
S0195	mm
S0192	what kind of wisdom can you pass on cos
S0195	we
S0192	and i be go to be well screw by the time we may eventually end up have children
S0195	well you'll probably be better off come back here to have kid wouldn't you anyway
S0192	yeah that's the problem like it complicate the situation quite a lot i've meet children that be from families that move around a lot and the the child though
S0195	they're pretty fuck up
S0192	well yeah i mean basically though the child may be on paper more intelligent and you know speak numerous languages and do these kind of things with regard to social interaction with people in their school or whatever i mean i meet a girl that in my in my upper school that be erm a compulsive liar basically
S0195	yeah
S0192	cos she'd be travel so much and she'd be around so much people couldn't call call her bullshit
S0195	yeah
S0192	which she hadn't you know what i mean you haven't be around
S0195	yeah
S0192	so and i have to take that into consideration if we wanna have children we need to settle down and then we have the problem of well i don't think we're gonna settle down for a little while so
S0195	therefore you won't have kid for a little while
S0192	we still wanna do a phd after we
S0195	do you wanna have kid then
S0192	a part of us definitely do like both and i like to experience things and have a child be a pretty big experience
S0195	it's well it's the ultimate one that
S0192	yeah it's massive
S0195	could obviously
S0192	yeah and it's a massive experience and nothing else cover it so we've discuss it and we kind of think maybe if we get to like forty i think
S0195	wow
S0192	another ten years of travel educate
S0195	well the thing be mate forty's too late for a woman these days
S0192	yeah
S0195	i mean it can be do i mean in our
S0192	my mum have one at forty seven
S0195	well yeah and there be a woman in our nct class who be forty four
S0192	mm
S0195	er but she'd get artificially inseminate
S0192	yeah yeah
S0195	so her egg weren't work so it's someone else's egg and his sperm
S0192	and this be the problem again when we've add what up what we need to do and then we decide that forty be the perfect age to do it and then realise
S0195	biologically it's not
S0192	's mum yeah hit hit the menopause at forty one so you know that stuff can easily happen quite young if you're a woman
S0195	yeah yeah
S0192	so then i guess we've decide that at that point we may just adopt i think
S0195	yeah
S0192	erm it would be
S0195	but that's not the same be it though
S0192	you've get a child that's not the same as you
S0195	it's not the same
S0192	but if you think about it adoption could be better if you wait and you adopt a child when they be eighteen years old and just about to go to uni and you pay for them to go to uni
S0195	yeah
S0192	and then
S0195	they'd just be like oh cheer mate
S0192	and then you you you basically have an agreement
S0195	mug
S0192	you sign a contract that say i pay for you for uni and for the next ten years and then you pay for me for when i'm like retire cos we may need help
S0195	that's not a very good deal
S0192	i think that could be a good
S0195	well for them it's not
S0192	if you set up single people with students around the country that don't have a
S0195	it's a crazy idea
S0195	it'll never get off the grind
S0192	so i don't think er i don't know if we will have children then cos
S0195	right
S0192	we haven't get enough years basically we're actually
S0192	senescence be really start to kick in
S0195	have you plan out your years until you're forty then
S0192	well not in so many word
S0195	no
S0192	but if i start count and i go okay well i'm twenty eight now i wanna graduate twenty nine but come on thirty
S0195	yeah
S0192	i won't be far i'll be in i'll turn thirty in saudi arabia i'll do a year there i definitely wanna travel africa for a year
S0195	i mean get so to forty
S0192	yeah i know
S0195	that's so depress
S0192	it's come around you're even closer as well
S0195	yeah man i know
S0192	you're even closer
S0195	it's like yeah eleven years
S0192	so then i mean saudi at thirty one i wanna travel africa for a year
S0195	mm
S0192	i then need to work for a couple of years to pay for a phd
S0195	yeah
S0192	a phd be another three or four years
S0195	yeah
S0192	you know what i mean
S0195	yeah
S0192	and then i'm like already thirty six thirty seven
S0195	yeah
S0192	then after i get a phd i need to get a decent fuck job
S0195	yeah
S0192	that actually pay alright i've get to be do research and shit at the time
S0195	yeah
S0192	so you're look at forty before i think i'll be financially and
S0195	yeah
S0192	you know life ready
S0195	emotionally and everything yeah
S0192	yeah to actually do it
S0195	tick all your box essentially
S0192	yeah basically because if i wanna be a uni professor in england i have to go through a quite a few thing few things before i can actually
S0195	yeah yeah there's a few
S0192	you have to have a phd
S0195	yeah
S0192	you have to have research you have to have
S0195	oh well yeah you need to be a professor and
S0192	yeah but in england you don't need to have much teach experience
S0195	yeah
S0192	the way i'm go around about it i might actually be quite a good teacher by the time i'm a professor
S0195	yeah
S0192	rather than just be a professor that doesn't know how to teach you know what i mean
S0195	yeah
S0192	some people they go from school to master to phd without ever get any work experience
S0195	mm yeah
S0192	and then they teach
S0195	yeah
S0192	and they teach in a uni
S0195	i know someone who's erm a professor he's only he's thirty six and he well he's a doctor actually
S0192	yeah
S0195	so he do what he's into at the minute pharmaceutical write
S0192	yeah
S0195	so he write for drug company basically a really well pay job it's like eighty grand a year
S0192	mm
S0195	basically but he be a doctor well within
S0192	yeah
S0195	and he's fuck so intelligent
S0192	my friend my age he be really clever at school
S0195	mm
S0192	he's already a research fellow
S0195	mm
S0192	at bristol university
S0195	oh really
S0192	he's like a top fifteen
S0195	he's do a he do his fellowship at in america somewhere at this drug company and he's get like patent on like certain drug
S0192	it's crazy
S0195	so it's mental isn't it so he get like royalties for these drug that he invent
S0192	and i think we wanna do our phd in america or canada
S0195	mm
S0192	the plan be if we can get a foot in the door with canada or america and we can spend three or four years and they have quite a bite of fund out there
S0195	yeah
S0192	or like as a foreign student you can get even more fund opportunities
S0195	mm
S0192	erm if we can get a three or four year foot in the door it's only another year to get a fairly solid green card which would mean that and i basically want dual citizenship somewhere
S0195	mm
S0192	so when we're older because i like england in many respect but quite a big one it fail for me
S0195	yeah
S0192	and that big one be land i don't
S0195	yeah no it's true it's a good point
S0192	it's unfortunately yeah unfortunately neither nor i come from a good enough background where we're gonna inherit something or our family can help or any of that kind of stuff
S0195	yeah
S0192	like most people i know pretty much be set at some point in our life
S0195	yeah
S0192	and i aren't if we're every gonna get on the property ladder
S0195	yeah
S0192	erm it's not gonna be in england
S0195	yeah
S0192	basically we can't afford to do it here
S0195	yeah
S0192	and we want a piece of i would rather have a bigger piece of land than a small house
S0195	yeah
S0192	do you know what mean than a bigger house and a smaller piece of land
S0195	yeah
S0192	i'd rather have somewhere where i can farm a little bite and just
S0195	do a bite of farm
S0192	and you know like this big
S0195	yeah
S0192	you know what i mean nothing bigger than here
S0195	yeah just there's only so much space you need really isn't there
S0192	so it would be maybe canada or america
S0195	yeah
S0192	i'm visit my friends in tennessee and like some of the house they show me be like a hundred thousand dollars and a hundred and fifty thousand dollars
S0195	yeah
S0192	maybe two hundred thousand dollars and they've get like a completely standalone
S0195	mm
S0192	detach they own part of the wood they've get like pond
S0195	yeah
S0192	they've get their own fire range i shoot like m16s and shotguns and stuff when i be there
S0195	yeah 's uncle emigrate to america
S0192	yeah
S0195	like about twenty years ago and he's live he's get a massive house and it's like with quite a bite of land
S0192	mm they do
S0195	and stuff so it be like he say he be like i couldn't afford to move back to england now
S0192	no
S0195	he be like he be like i'd probably get the equivalent of a hundred and fifty thousand pound for my house and he's like i'd get nothing for that over in england it's like he's get so much five bedroom house swim pool
S0192	it's crazy isn't it yeah
S0195	load of land it's mental
S0192	my friend's just buy my friend's father have just buy five hundred the size of five hundred american football fields' worth of land in kentucky
S0195	really
S0192	for like not very much i mean it cost a lot of money but it's not as much as you'd think it would be
S0195	yeah
S0192	where in england could you buy five hundred football field of land
S0195	no it doesn't probably
S0192	no it doesn't exist
S0195	not even that bite of land exist that's not already a national park
S0192	no you can't have it
S0192	so yeah
S0195	mm
S0192	so we're probably gonna have to do something like that
S0195	yeah
S0192	cos i can't see
S0195	but that's not a bad plan really
S0192	i can't see any other way that we're gonna get some land
S0195	yeah
S0192	and find
S0195	i want i wanna get me some land
S0192	basically
S0195	buy me a good woman
S0192	i'd really like to live in like argentina or something
S0195	yeah
S0192	just a big country but the problem with like argentina
S0195	politically quite unstable
S0192	yeah i mean oh it's such a beautiful country though like really friendly people you'd love it
S0195	well they're not like the best relations with the uk either
S0192	you like you like your coke you like coke you'd like it out there
S0195	yeah
S0192	it's all romantic tango music
S0195	yeah
S0192	european cocaine
S0195	mm
S0192	just whatever
S0195	mm
S0192	know what i mean
S0195	cheap cocaine as well
S0192	not i'm not i'm not say i do i didn't partake in any of that
S0195	cheap good cocaine
S0192	yes but from the the vibe around there be good
S0195	yeah
S0192	but erm the problem with live there be i'd need to live there first now their universities be not top notch
S0195	no
S0192	and the problem also and why i'm study in england now i can't i can't study at a university that's not in an english speak country my field won't accept it so and i want to go to holland we want to go to the netherlands
S0195	mm
S0192	and it be a top a hundred university the course be in english
S0195	yeah
S0192	they're basically bilingual but when i start i i apply to a few job and tell them look i've get this degree from this university
S0195	mm
S0192	and they basically tell me they wouldn't accept it that it have to be from a native english speak country
S0195	really
S0192	so the same with our phd we couldn't do one in argentina therefore the only way we get a foot in the door be by work there for numerous years but the pay be so low
S0195	be it really
S0192	in latin america it's terrible
S0195	yeah
S0192	it's terrible i mean you'll learn a little bite more in argentina than you will in say mexico or somewhere like that
S0195	yeah
S0192	i'd love to teach in these place
S0195	yeah
S0192	they'd be really chill really good lifestyle
S0195	there's no money though
S0192	and have a good thing but you i mean mexico you can earn about five hundred dollars a month you know what i mean about three hundred quid a month
S0195	yeah
S0192	you what you i'm not gonna do shit with that
S0195	yeah that's ridiculous
S0192	argentina you'll earn about a thousand dollars a month
S0195	oh really
S0192	but that's still only about six hundred quid you know what i mean
S0195	yeah exactly
S0192	and the country's not that cheap so
S0195	no
S0192	erm
S0195	no that's really true
S0192	so i have to i have to work where i can save
S0195	yeah
S0192	if because then i can just travel to these place but if i work there i can't save
S0195	yeah
S0192	and i have a job interview in chile
S0195	do you
S0192	yes it be quite sketchy it be a bite of a strange experience
S0195	really
S0192	when you're travel to have a job interview
S0195	yeah
S0192	we have to like i have to buy a suit and some trousers
S0195	do you really
S0192	yeah yeah
S0195	what be it a job interview for
S0192	it be at the british to teach english it be at the british institute in san diego in chile
S0195	oh really
S0192	it be like probably the best job we could have get in latin america
S0195	mm
S0192	it pay about nine hundred pound a month erm
S0195	not bad
S0192	so it be more it be the highest job i could find like the best earn
S0195	yeah
S0192	but the problem be sorry this be quite a long anecdote to go into
S0195	yeah
S0192	just natter like mad the problem be that we'd apply to this job about three or four months before so we actually
S0195	yeah
S0192	change our entire travel route and speed things up so that we can get to this people to have an interview with them
S0195	yeah
S0192	to take a job there in the future and we saw we didn't hear back from them we saw the same job advert in london
S0195	yeah
S0192	with the same specifications but you know all these benefit and all this kind of stuff
S0195	yeah
S0192	and i email the guy and say look we're still interest we're still come
S0195	yeah
S0192	can i confirm that this be the same job and he tell me yeah
S0195	yeah
S0192	when we finally get there and i buy a suit and everything we go for the job interview and i come out and just have share a bottle of whiskey on on some grass we find out there and just felt really deflate
S0195	yeah yeah
S0192	like it just tell us that we didn't wanna do that you know
S0195	yeah
S0192	you know we want to keep travel but basically he wouldn't give us the same benefit that he be give these people from london
S0195	really
S0192	even though we've completely fit the criteria be from london
S0195	you're already there
S0192	and we come to you ourselves
S0195	yeah yeah
S0192	you know he be try to haggle with me afterwards
S0195	yeah
S0192	over email and i basically tell him look you can't offer me what we're after you know what i mean
S0195	really
S0192	and at that point we realise that if you can
S0195	so they be try to get you for cheap basically
S0192	yeah it well it for cheaper he could have
S0195	yeah
S0192	give perhaps give us what he'd offer them and even if he do i think we realise at this point that it still wasn't enough it still wasn't as good as what we're earn in korea
S0195	yeah
S0192	and we be enjoy travel
S0195	yeah
S0192	so why do we wanna stop travel
S0195	yeah
S0192	and work
S0195	yeah exactly
S0192	when i could just and from that point er we book our ticket and a week later we fly to nicaragua and just travel
S0195	yeah
