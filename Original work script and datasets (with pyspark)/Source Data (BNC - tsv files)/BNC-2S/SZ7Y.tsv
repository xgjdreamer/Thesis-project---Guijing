S0041	mm
S0084	mm
S0041	erm this pizza be amaze if i ever try to buy a pizza again you say this be what you want
S0041	you know like they're suppose to be fifteen sixteen
S0084	mm mm they're like twenty five aren't they
S0041	and they're like even the things that they say and that i saw how hard your break with be as if it's life or death and like at fifteen sixteen it really wasn't i think that be just me
S0084	it wasn't but i think it felt like it
S0041	really
S0084	everything be really hard when you're that age though isn't it everything be really extreme like i think i think of the crush that i have when i be that age and they be so
S0041	mm
S0084	powerful and so extreme like i would say i blush now but then a boy i have a crush on a boy call for six and a half years
S0041	wow
S0084	yeah and erm if he even look at me i would go bananas i would go home and like call my friends and be like the thing be though we walk home halfway home together and we be talk about this like what do it mean and i'd be on the phone for like five hours like have a full debrief
S0084	it be insane and i think i actually miss that because everything that you be experience you be experience for the first time and all those emotions there be heighten because of
S0041	yeah
S0084	what you're go through
S0041	mm so i just gain two pound down there
S0084	mm two whole pound
S0041	wow
S0084	that's a tip
S0041	winner
S0084	this be nice have i see this be that your jumpsuit
S0041	this pattern
S0084	mm
S0041	it's trousers
S0084	oh i like
S0041	you haven't see them i haven't be able to fit in them before
S0084	have i not see them i like them though be it possible be that an option they
S0041	i've have my sex top tuck into them
S0084	lovely
S0041	i remember really this be a really nice memory actually erm and i be like off and on through school and i always fancy him well ever since i move school in year year eight i would always have a crush on him and we use to get on really well although my friends be always popular girls they be all really skinny very athletic not stunningly pretty but like i would always be the least out of all of us and then like in year nine ten while we be away do trident when you do do like work experience and i be like fuck this and really diet load and lose about two stone in two and a half months mm
S0084	that sound a bite serious
S0041	yeah but i don't know how
S0084	i think you
S0041	just i go swim twice a week eat salads that just
S0084	i i think that when you can it just come up and you just don't eat for a day
S0041	yeah erm and then i come back and then he really fancy me
S0084	mm
S0041	erm and it be like a swoon moment you know like in one of those teen film and it be like oh and then i be then i have him and his best friend fight over me and i be like ooh ooh ooh
S0084	mm i love it when that happen
S0041	then we go into sixth form and they all stay friends with me and then there be three of them all at it as well and i use to game teacher and they they be all take me out for drink
S0084	mm
S0041	yeah but i mean it take like it's it's a nice feel some of it take months of years and years of be take the out of because my friends be boys but like some of them if they find out that i'd fancy them then it wasn't nice like it wasn't oh wow fancy me it be like weird cos my friend fancy me do you know what i mean
S0084	mm
S0041	and i remember this guy call tom stanton and the worst insult i ever get be we be in year nine and he find out that i fancy him and he be say it to which be the worst thing cos like tell him to shut up when he say it but he say she's get a face like a bulldog bulldog chew a wasp yeah
S0084	but boys at that age be be cruel you know they say stuff not because they mean it but because they want to be cruel and make their mat laugh do you know what i mean
S0041	mm
S0084	like he's it's that age and i think the thing be the what the the thing that worry me when about that story be that you now marry the two things so you marry lose all that weight and the boys fancy you and i think probably what actually happen
S0041	mm
S0084	be you lose the weight gain confidence and that's what boys find attractive like they don't i don't think it's anything to do with the size that you be
S0041	no
S0084	and i think you're very self conscious
S0041	probably not
S0084	about that but actually boys be and girls you're attract to somebody who be confident about themselves and it doesn't really matter what size they be what their face look like what their skin look like ultimately if they're confident in their own skin that's a really attractive quality
S0041	mm
S0084	i think actually like if you look in the mirror now you be no you're a stun girl and you get if you think about it even just with your photo up on plenty of fish that you're get you've get message from really attractive blokes aren't you i mean you get
S0041	yeah
S0084	approach by attractive blokes in club and if you think about all the the boys that you've have interest from they've all be attractive like you can't really think that you're not attractive
S0041	but do you know what i think it be i think it's er a case of what's the word for it i can't remember the name of it like say girls that weren't pretty at school develop a personality to me if they
S0084	yeah
S0041	weren't pretty at school then now you might still be pretty but you're thick you know what i mean
S0084	mm
S0041	a little bite of an airhead there's not much up here i think it's probably a bite of a like a marry of both but even though that's one comment that stick in my head from school
S0084	mm
S0041	i see him now and i think why the hell do you even like him
S0084	mm
S0041	and he's not even that hot
S0084	mm
S0041	like if i saw him now i would love to go i be say i be think about go back actually when while i'm at home when we go for jubilee time
S0084	mm
S0041	tell that i'm go back so he'll be so excite to see me just to wipe it in their face
S0084	mm mm
S0041	like you know just for that i mean people i don't even care and he probably doesn't they probably don't even remember say it
S0084	no well that's the thing cos it's those sort of comment to those sort of people be just throwaway it but it's to you that it stick
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know the stuff that you get call when you're at school like that's why i would never go back to school ever ever you know if i if i could have my time again i would never go back because those last two years be so painful but i think everybody experience some level of torment at some point and i i think there's very few people who don't but erm i the stuff that kid use to say to me will never factor in their mind so they would never look back and think god
S0041	remember when i say that
S0084	i be a bite of an arse whereas i look back and i think sometimes god i be really cruel to other people because i be suffer myself and so i be mean to other people because it's all a social system so you're be shit on from on high so you take it out on somebody else
S0041	shit on someone else yeah
S0084	which be really it's i mean that's when you learn that's not acceptable behaviour but you're in all likelihood you're not in contact with those people anymore so you can't really make amend it's like my name be isn't it it go back and make it's always do and i quite like that idea like you learn that that's not really acceptable behaviour
S0041	do you know even if i really think hard i can't remember many girls that i be nasty about i can't really think of any i remember say look like a man but she be go to so i think that kind of count
S0084	mm
S0041	mm like one girl be a tart and well she be and i would call her it now
S0084	mm mm
S0041	i wasn't very vicious but i feel like i be now
S0084	mm
S0041	like i say to my dad when when he come down at easter we be sit in the indian and i be take the out of some woman's bingo wing she couldn't hear me though
S0084	mm
S0041	then it be some woman that have be mean to before
S0084	mm
S0041	so i be take the out of her what about him erm i say to him you don't think i'm really awful though do i do you and he be like no it's just good sense because i think you don't really know me very well and i hope you don't think that
S0084	mm
S0041	i'm just nasty all the time
S0084	mm
S0041	because i'm really critical now not not
S0041	i love it when travis try to throw himself out of the window happen
S0084	oh no
S0041	perfume
S0084	hilarious
S0041	there's so many one liners i think my favourite be when she say couch commando and i find myself use it and i always have since i've see this
S0084	what the hell do that mean like a a erm couch potato
S0041	mm the brother come in and start look at channel and she go who die and make you couch commando
S0084	oh i like it
S0041	yeah do i tell you my favourite from pride and prejudice be i'm not inflict the false modesty there's a one liner in it and she say erm i don't know if she's talk to mr darcy i think so oh no maybe her that that lady woman that's not very nice
S0084	mm
S0041	erm i'm not afflict with false modesty and i think
S0084	mm
S0041	we never use language like that now afflict
S0084	that's the thing about read the book i really like the book because they're so the the language be so rich
S0041	mm
S0084	and it's die out and i don't i mean i don't mind a bite of colloquialism but i mean it sound make me sound like a snob but like if i listen to the news now and they they don't speak correctly like they don't they they shorten things and use colloquialisms and they're like oh they nip to the loo and i think on the bbc news you should be encourage people to speak properly
S0041	yeah
S0084	and i know and i you know
S0041	no i agree
S0084	and if that make me sound like a snob then fine but i think it's i think it's important
S0041	oh no
S0084	get it in there
S0041	no i agree i find it quite i suppose we don't use it now because nobody do but i find it quite strange that at school you're not the teachers don't speak that way like somebody should and that should be people that be
S0084	mm
S0041	professors teachers bbc
S0084	mm
S0041	i think it should be like rp like
S0084	mm mm
S0041	you should just if you pronounce things properly then why aren't you use the
S0084	mm
S0041	i suppose people don't read so much
S0084	mm clearly well at nicky's first school which she's a primary school teacher her head of year be also the head of literacy and her opinion be it be fine for kid to read magazines as even if they weren't read book because at least they be read something
S0041	no
S0084	not not find a way to find book that kid would actually engage with and find interest and want to read more book kid naturally want to read most
S0041	mm
S0084	of the time and they like stories
S0041	nancy draw i use to love them
S0084	nancy draw fudge whatever whatever it be that they want to read there's lot of good modern stories out there and ultimately kid learn morals social structure language from read and it's really important and for you to say you can read like a dr who magazine well no they can't
S0041	no
S0084	ridiculous so and that's what's be encourage now and like it's a real
S0041	i'm shock

S0041	that be such a bad fall oh
S0084	flower he's go with oh look at him go
S0041	do you know actually that's really just remind me i be in year four i think when this come out thirty five three years six yeah year four in school and my friend best friend at the time bring a magazine into work er into school that have the lingo from this and the translation like
S0084	really
S0041	she be such a and what a be and all the different word i can't remember what they be now but i remember us sit there and learn it
S0084	really
S0041	learn it yeah who the hell we think we be gonna talk to i don't know
S0084	mm mm awkward
S0041	she's so sweet
S0084	she's absolutely adorable
S0041	i remember it so well like i watch it last week
S0084	that be always me it be always my mat cop off with the boys and that be always me on my own because i'm cool like that
S0041	my mat never cop off with anyone we always stick together do you use to have these party right where it be normal it be all like everyone from your school to snog like seven boys in one night
S0084	how what say again
S0041	i recall like when we be in sixth form that everyone and anyone turn eighteen they'd have party at the local rugby club they would hire it out and everyone do it every eighteenth birthday so every other week there be one erm and it be quite normal i remember have a conversation with my friend how many people have you snog tonight and my reply be seven
S0084	mm
S0041	and that be normal that be acceptable
S0084	right okay that be never at school i be never like that i be always a shrink violet when i turn eighteen and i go to uni it all change and when i be that age i think because school be a like really hard and i use to get really pick on then i be i just become more and more introvert so that be never i be never that girl grow up never ever but as i get a bite older and when i be at college and i start work and i be meet new people so i'd move to a different i'd go to a different college not my sixth form college and meet new people there and i i start work at the bakery in town so i meet new people there which be where i meet will my last ex way back when and my best friend at the time and we use to go out drink all the time and i have no confidence whatsoever er and it i think even now that this have a quite long last effect because i don't think i have much confidence now but certainly then i would never i would never have approach anybody and i be always frighten if somebody approach me and in fact i be now because there's i could probably count on one hand the amount of time that i've like somebody and they've like me back because it's quite a rare a rare event actually like to like somebody from afar and then to actually succeed and get them i could it never really happen and i don't know if that's a confidence thing or what it be but i mean i
S0041	i think so
S0084	i don't see myself as
S0041	like it shock me when we be watch that programme the other day what be it we be watch and you be like i i wish i have her dress and her body and her face and her
S0041	and i be like what the fuck be you talk about
S0084	well yeah but that but you would say that
S0041	like she she compare to you
S0084	well no because you think that because you're my friend and
S0041	no
S0084	no no because if you be to just look at the two of us like i'm more i always look a mess my hair be always mental my i never wear any make up and i wear run clothe
S0041	because you don't have to
S0084	because i can't be arsed
S0041	because you don't have to wear it
S0084	except i don't see myself as
S0041	if i
S0084	particularly attractive at all i never have and so
S0041	you're fuck nut
S0084	but but the thing be at the one the very few few time you've be question me on this i think well i've be me for my whole life like i know what what sort of reaction i get from people and like if we walk through town and nobody blink an eye like do you know what i mean like you're not turn head and some people be mean to and some people aren't and that's fine i just sort of find
S0084	not in life i know
S0041	yeah some people aren't some people no i see what you mean some people be make to turn head and some people aren't you're not a not
S0084	i be so much a not i'm the first one
S0041	you're not
S0084	no i be and i'm not say this for you to
S0041	no
S0084	to make me feel better and like
S0041	well i'm not say it to make you feel better but the first thing that we leave the house the first time she meet you and go wow isn't liz pretty
S0084	well that's very if that's true that's very sweet but
S0041	yeah honestly i promise you i just don't think you see it at all
S0084	phew i
S0041	like if i i walk into work once without make up and i'd only go there quickly to drop my bag sneak in the office drop my bag and go to the gym and eve go oh my god be you okay i go what and then i realise that's like yes fine this be what i look like without make up on and she be like her face be mortify that she'd offend me
S0084	yeah but i always think like when i see you in the morning and you're not wear any make up you be really like that because
S0041	oh
S0084	have you just chop your leg in half
S0041	yeah in half
S0084	i you know i i be that sort of person and i you know i think less be more and obviously when when you walk tonight and you just look a vision of beauty and just whatever bedraggle clothe i've be wear from work and you know i guess that's the thing and if i really want to do it if i really want if i could be bother then yeah i would erm
S0041	but that's nice though because when you get ready to go somewhere you look completely different
S0084	mm yeah
S0041	whereas if i put more make up on to go out really i risk look like a drag queen
S0084	it seem unlikely
S0084	why be she red
S0041	because she's fluster but i think basically she's just put blusher on that much
S0084	i don't know what's happen
S0041	oh i never check the car for my fricking id do i
S0084	mm
S0041	let me check that top drawer right keep everything cross

S0084	yeah i'm really look forward to it
S0041	like if it wasn't weird i'd love him and to get together
S0084	mm
S0041	cos they would just get on so well
S0084	mm
S0041	like she's she often often say that he's the nicest guy she's ever meet
S0084	really
S0041	in her whole life yeah erm and i know that she would be perfect for him cos she cos she know him so well
S0084	mm
S0041	so i'm scar that he's gonna meet someone not that they'll be after his money because he's not gonna have a lot but not not a user
S0084	mm mm
S0041	do you know what i mean and i don't think really anyone's go to be able to appreciate what he's be through in the past kind of three years cos you can't unless you know someone that have
S0084	yeah yeah yeah
S0041	because it's so strange
S0084	yeah
S0041	but i'd love for them to get together
S0084	but they're not relate be they
S0041	no
S0084	she's your she's 's sister
S0041	yeah
S0084	yeah
S0041	like
S0084	but they be like brother and sister
S0041	they could no they're not they weren't live close until all this happen
S0084	oh really
S0041	yeah my dad help her through her divorce by her divorce financially
S0084	yeah you be say
S0041	erm and she last weekend offer my dad money cos he's really get hard up now
S0084	right
S0041	erm and obviously he's too proud to accept it but we be on about go up to at er next weekend so that she can like take her cheque book basically so i say to her when i saw her at the weekend and i say i i know it sound really really really sad but i can only if anything like this would happen or anything would happen when he need something i'd be financially able to provide for him like he's always
S0084	mm
S0041	provide for me and it's just i hate that it's kind of happen five ten years before that table have turn enough for me to be able to do it
S0084	mm mm mm
S0041	you know have this happen twenty years ago in time clock back
S0084	yeah
S0041	then twenty five would be a suitable age to be expect to have a family home and be financially well off
S0084	mm mm
S0041	and i just feel so bad that i can't help him
S0084	but there's the thing you would never expect it do you know what i mean like
S0041	no
S0084	you would never i think even when you you be in that position your parent never see it they never would imagine
S0041	no
S0084	that that's
S0041	like you weren't even tell stuff now
S0084	what they be do yeah
S0041	at all
S0084	but i mean it it's such a fine balance though isn't it because like with my mum i often find that there's stuff that i know that she's hold back and i think on the one hand i'd quite like her to tell me or or at least feel she's able to tell me but at the same time i can appreciate why she might not want to you know ultimately you have to keep that parent child bond and keep that distance because you know she's get friends she can talk to about stuff just as i have and there be certain things i wouldn't talk to her about probably so erm so yeah it's
S0041	it's a fine line isn't it
S0084	it's a really fine line and you know you want to be there as a support for your parent when you're an adult but you know that i think that basically you expect that they're always gonna be the person to provide
S0041	mm
S0084	no matter what
S0041	even if they don't want to
S0084	yeah and like with my dad my dad's really proud and and my older brother be pretty well off financially because obviously like he buy my dad a a super deluxe lovely tv for christmas and never come to visit us but that's they don't but but i know that my my dad want to be the one to pay for dinner he want to be able to get the drink but actually you know he he's retire and michael's get quite a good income it should be michael that pay just as you know it would be me that would do it but i think it's different because i live here so i sort of take it all for grant
S0041	yeah
S0084	sort of back back to that oh it's so easy i'm just here for a cup of tea or whatever
S0041	yeah
S0084	whereas i think if you come for a visit it make it into a bigger deal
S0041	yeah definitely
S0084	but i suppose because they see each other less frequently
S0041	yeah like dad won't let me pay for anything at all nothing
S0084	mm
S0041	and like when he when he come before ordinarily i would have pay for dinner and and know that how break i be this month
S0084	mm
S0041	with the car and everything and she secretly give me forty pound cash and she say say you're pay for dinner cos he won't let me pay for it again
S0084	mm
S0041	because have pay for his meal
S0084	okay
S0041	so i pay for it erm and give it to the guy at the counter and dad be stand there and i say do you want to take your coffees over and i'll wait for the third one and he say oh no it's okay and the guy come over because i'd distract dad i be quick enough to give him the forty pound cash for a thirty nine pound bill that
S0084	nice
S0041	erm and he say what be you do and i say i'm pay for the dinner and he say well no cos i'll pay for dinner and i say no stop it because you always pay for everything and i just want to pay for one thing know that i be actually really pay for it
S0084	mm
S0041	erm and i say just say thank you and let me pay for just one thing out of everything please and he be like okay then and that's only because erm we'd leave the antique place and i'd choose this erm and i be go to buy it for myself and he say oh i'll get it for your birthday and i say oh you know i think do you not think sixty pound be a bite excessive for a birthday present really i say but why don't we go halve then because i would have buy it for myself anyway no no no i'll pay for it and i say well i i feel a bite uncomfortable actually if you pay pay that much for a birthday gift i i would really appreciate it you'd just let me pay half cos i just think that's a bite
S0084	mm
S0041	it's a bite ridiculous no he wouldn't have any of it he just won't he just won't have it
S0084	mm
S0041	even if even something that he he that i be go to pay for myself because i've have the cash for
S0084	mm
S0041	he wouldn't have it before he leave he give me forty quid cash for er dinner even though i know he doesn't have that money
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	he doesn't have it
S0084	yeah
S0041	and he come into my room before he leave and i be just write him an easter card to put in his case to say thank you erm for come down and he put the forty pound in my case and the the killer be i know he can't afford it because ordinarily he would have leave sixty
S0084	mm mm
S0041	do you know what i mean
S0084	mm
S0041	he would have pay he would have leave more money so i know he's skint and i know he's tell that he's down to his last three hundred pound in the world
S0084	god
S0041	yeah he's really really
S0084	he still want
S0041	bad
S0084	to pay for dinner
S0041	yeah
S0084	to provide for you
S0041	that part where he's i've give him every single excuse for him to be able to just say okay then i'll let you on this occasion he still won't do it and i say to him dad i say you're go to have to get over this you know because i wouldn't take the money off him and he put in my bag and on the bed i say what be you do i say no i say i want to pay for it and he say and he get and i put it in my bag and i say thank you i say but you're you're go to have to get over this you know i say because you know you come down here and you pay for petrol to get here you pay
S0084	absolutely
S0041	for your dinners when you get here and
S0084	mm
S0041	and i never have that expense because i don't call to you so the the least you can let me do when you come here be let me buy you dinner to say thank you for come
S0084	absolutely yeah yeah yeah
S0041	and say oh
S0084	it's just a pride thing
S0041	yeah because he's because he's provide everything all the time for twenty five years everything
