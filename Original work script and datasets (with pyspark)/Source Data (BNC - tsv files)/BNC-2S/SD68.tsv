S0115	so we're still on uh asian network then
S0037	i've enjoy it more than i think i would like i suppose i i didn't listen to that much sort of um asian inspire music you know current music
S0115	yeah um it it's something that i i hadn't listen to a lot before but uh obviously uh now um there's
S0037	it's better than like the pop like i'd rather listen to this than like one direction or something
S0115	it yeah it felt that there be um some of the ones uh be get too sad at at the at the far end of the um
S0037	which ones
S0115	at the far end of the of the list of um uh of uh
S0037	of the radio station you mean
S0115	station yeah like uh that it be get too it be get too sad yeah
S0037	well i suppose it's the night time like it's not get it like and it's like not like a friday or saturday
S0115	but these ones that that some of them be um put like this one's probably more sort of
S0037	yeah more upbeat
S0115	yeah but then well probably i suppose
S0037	but i'd much rather listen to this than like um you know like some of those band like the saturdays or like one direction or what that other one you know
S0115	well i mean i wouldn't have recognize uh one direction if if if it have come on so
S0037	no but justin byber or whatever he's call he's no he's not call that be he
S0115	bieber
S0037	justin bieber
S0037	i be in um uh primark the other day and they have t shirt with justin bieber's face on that say i love justin bieber on the front
S0037	like what so obviously like just for the thirteen year olds
S0115	he's uh he's a great performer uh
S0037	be he he's a great something
S0115	why why do no one like him i mean
S0037	cos if you just listen to him for like five second you realize he's like the most insanely annoy person in the universe
S0115	i don't know i mean
S0037	he's very annoy
S0115	no i don't think it's his his voice i think
S0037	no it's not his voice it's not his voice at all
S0115	no like if if it be like the voice or something like and you know uh you know
S0037	no he be a good singer
S0115	no i no i mean if you couldn't see his face then i think like you'd you'd probably like have a different you know what i mean
S0037	i suppose it's not just about like the song be it or him sing in fact because really if we're honest there's load of people who who be good singers like the thing with like be like a pop star if you like be about more much more than that it's about image and look and all that stuff isn't it i mean i i'm not interest in any of that anyway but he's very very annoy and i don't like his music anyway
S0115	well d'you think it's it's more just sort of his you know his his his his hair
S0037	well he's just a pop he's like a teen fluff pop star he doesn't offend us massively i think he's annoy but not angry at him
S0115	yeah i mean yeah he he be quite annoy uh on uh graham norton's show uh which i don't really like i wouldn't wanna watch that very often but uh
S0037	no i dunno it can be quite funny i like that thing where they tip people over the back of the chair
S0115	um no i i don't like that actually
S0037	it's quite funny
S0115	really
S0037	some bits be because you know what you're go into like you must expect to be like just flip over the chair
S0115	well yeah but
S0037	you know
S0115	fair enough
S0037	it's not like it's like tortuous for them people aren't force into it they're go into that fully expect to be like you know
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	think if you know what you're let yourself into it's not like they're just like gunging people at random or something gunge every time i hear that word it just remind me of like noel's house party
S0115	oh yeah yeah right yeah yeah he be annoy wasn't he
S0037	i use to watch that
S0115	noel noel edmonds
S0037	crinkley bottom and that remind me of like you know they open like a
S0115	yeah yeah the the uh dilapidate uh
S0037	blobby world
S0115	uh theme park do that theme park with the polo tower it's a big polo tower
S0037	ah poor old
S0115	ah no one still not enough people go there well it have a bite of you know there be a bite of economy go on like
S0037	well they're try to i mean
S0115	there be like during the you know in the during the sort of conveyancing boom um
S0037	yeah
S0115	the the construction boom or whatever like when i be work there um i mean the office the office space have gotta be quite cheap like but there be there be quite a few little little company um work there there be a bite of an economy you know and they have a bite of the like you know the sort of shop and things that you'd associate with uh with with people like people commute to you know uh rather than simply uh yeah
S0037	god yeah yeah yeah i i know what mean i think maybe they've do a lot since they like do the midland up
S0115	yeah i mean not not that there's anything wrong with um have it as a place that you commute from to but but i suppose it didn't look like that it look kind of like like it didn't look like a wealthy didn't look like a wealthy commuter suburb i you know it it be like a a decline
S0037	yeah just a bite sad wasn't it like yeah we sort of get lose there d'you remember i just remember like walk around like look for the the bus stop like in some of the back streets d'you remember
S0115	uh oh yeah that shouldn't have uh shouldn't have be so hard
S0037	sort of get lose what
S0115	it shouldn't have be that hard should it
S0037	no it shouldn't have be that hard but we do get back in the end we be just a bite lose
S0115	think we get on the bus eventually yeah
S0037	we do yeah yeah
S0115	no it it's actually an uh uh uh a nice i think it be quite a nice place an interest place and uh hadn't
S0037	i think i think be because they'd move the bus stop hadn't they like there be like they're do load of road work and they be like move to such and such a street but obviously we didn't know where that be
S0115	yeah i i i i quite um quite like it and uh
S0037	well i get to know it quite well i mean i pass me drive test in remember
S0115	oh right do you that's an easy place to easy place to do it
S0037	well it be and it isn't i didn't drive in my drive test in at all i i pass it in so i know the roads quite well
S0115	yeah
S0037	um do all of me manoeuvre and they've get some like really um some of those you know if the state where they have like those big sweep corner and those kind of victorian terrace where you have like those right angle to reverse round you know so
S0115	oh right
S0037	it be good but there's a lot of roundabouts i'm good at roundabouts well some of the time uh
S0115	yeah i guess uh ah it's age since i've drive i can hardly remember like
S0037	yeah it feel different like i drive so rarely now
S0115	get in get in this guess that lane and uh yeah it seem things that be that seem very easy when when you're use to it
S0037	yeah
S0115	it seem it seem really easy
S0037	you don't even think about it like
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	when like it's funny cos when you
S0115	it's sort of you say like you know go round this go round that like
S0037	yeah
S0115	like as a if you if you're start from scratch or or something then you wouldn't know when you say go round it like you have no idea how how to sort of um get the the curve right so that you're go round like a fat roundabout or a thin roundabout
S0037	yeah yeah yeah
S0115	uh but but if you experience it of course you you would just know how the curve how how to draw the curve out of the shape that you turn in the steer wheel so
S0037	yeah i know it's a funny one like you know when you know when you're learn to drive people always say to you yeah once you've learn like you just do it without think it and you can drive any car you can drive anywhere and and it
S0115	you never forget yeah well yeah i think i i i learn you know for and uh and i could've could drive at the time but uh i just have to refresh myself and it's a lot of uh a lot of time since i last do it
S0037	i think so i think it come back to you it be stressful though like like when we hire that car for 's wed like i hadn't drive for two years it's quite a long time and i do make some mistake
S0115	yeah but but you do yeah you do drive like for for quite a long time uh like two years um
S0037	do you yeah but that's still not a long time really not compare to some people
S0115	no i mean i i probably only like like a few months really uh that i have like of good decent drive um
S0037	but i i suppose it's like anything i mean like when we move here and i buy a bike i hadn't probably ride a bike since i be eleven like
S0115	yeah oh right yeah
S0037	you know like
S0115	that's yeah
S0037	fifteen years or whatever more than fifteen
S0115	yeah yeah i mean stuff should come back that i think like uh yeah
S0037	so
S0115	um
S0037	as gok wan would say it's all about the confidence
S0037	obviously it's easier to be confident on a bike than in a car
S0037	essentially on a bike turn your legs round go forward
S0115	yeah i think it be partly about confidence but um drink and drive don't go together
S0037	no definitely not
S0115	so it's also it's also about the coordination
S0037	but i can see why they don't like i mean even like drink and cycle don't really go like i i would cycle after two beers
S0115	i think no i i think that you can after after a couple uh
S0037	no no after two beers yes but i i've do it after more but like you lose all your inhibitions like i think like i suppose you don't really realize it when you're just pootling around or you're just walk you know you're walk to from place to place and mooch about you don't really notice but like if you have to like i'm like so sometimes on a friday i go for a drink after work and like i have two beers and i fly home i just like i just cycle so much faster and i'm so much more like dare and like
S0115	oh really yeah you see i i don't think i'd be um i don't i'd be like that if i be
S0037	you just think i wanna get home i wanna get home i wanna get home like your sort of mentality change even after just like a couple of beers
S0115	uh i don't think i'd be like that if i be um uh drink or uh i don't think
S0037	i dunno i think it's i think i think it's the exercise though as well
S0115	i don't think drink drink would make would make make me go really fast unless of course like there be no one in sight
S0037	but i think it's like the exercise of it like i think it's sort of it must drive it round your body faster
S0115	uh possibly yeah
S0037	like you know sit still and drink a glass of beer versus drink a glass of beer and then like give it some on your i mean it must pump your blood round your body dead fast if i think
S0115	yeah i i i think it yeah it drive it drive it through um
S0037	so it must like hit you faster
S0115	although
S0037	but i don't know maybe i'm just a lightweight now
S0115	i think it would
S0037	i'm always a bite cautious think i don't think i would ever i would don't think i would ever cycle after two beers after i fell off that time
S0115	i i remember a um i no i think that's cos that's not cos of drink that's cos of you be talk to someone else
S0037	i know but i think uh
S0115	so it's i think i think when you're talk to somebody you sort of focus you really put a lot of focus in the the other person like um that they they yeah
S0037	i know but i still get pain off that well it be there be just too i mean there be too many stupid things i do then yes i'd have some beer and yes we be chat away like two old ladies and like you know i try to do something ridiculous like i try to sort of move me bike light with me foot and then just get tangle in me bike and
S0115	yeah
S0037	um it be just like a series of misfortunes but i think it's make us realize that like if i hadn't have them beers i don't know if i would've attempt that like while talk while do you know i probably wouldn't have so
S0115	yeah
S0037	it be so painful it's still sore like it doesn't hurt it's not hurt us now but sometimes like it's painful
S0115	yeah ah well uh it's a it's a bad one i no but uh when when we when we go um
S0037	it's not that bad really consider we've be here for cycle every single day for two and a half years
S0115	that be a yeah it be a really quite unnecessary but you just you get yo get it from simply from play like from try to like you know stupidly kick a thing like it be it be absolutely not really even an an accident in that i mean not not an accident as in a a crash or
S0037	i know no nothing bad happen no no no
S0115	uh it wasn't a crash or a slip yeah it didn't have any external cause it be it be entirely your own
S0037	not cause by anyone else no it be entirely my own fault no no i agree it be
S0115	and and as such wasn't so much an accident
S0037	but look i've still get scar like i'm like like a seven year old with like scab on me
S0115	uh you have to scrub them though don't you when you're uh to stop them
S0037	no it's not it's just like the scar tissue you can't scrub your knee before you fall off
S0115	no i mean like before the like i mean when the when it's um the you know like if you get a graze proper graze you've gotta like scrub it haven't you and
S0037	i do i do i do everyday and i've put like i'm i rub like vaseline in it and
S0115	i guess they they'll go down eventually yeah
S0037	ah yeah it's just a scar now i mean it course it'll go
S0115	but um
S0037	i've get plenty
S0115	uh yeah
S0037	i have one on me face d'you remember when i like scrap all me face that's that totally go
S0115	that's go hasn't it yeah so uh but but no i mean uh i think it be it can be dangerous like with a lot of cars but i think if if i be uh like uh rid myself i would try and avoid um a lot of cars uh
S0037	i don't know i mean cars be like in most of it they're pretty good like because people who drive in all the time be really i suppose really use to like load of cyclists
S0115	you've tell me about load of things like like like near near um yeah things have nearly happen to you and you've have to sort of shelter people and stuff uh or like
S0037	some people be bad yeah
S0115	you've see accidents you've see like bump and stuff um
S0037	i have yeah i have yeah i saw someone get their front wheel bend like that be really bad they be alright it be quite a sort of slow and in the end it be quite a slow impact
S0115	yeah it's it's terrible when uh
S0037	but like the car just go into the wheel and the wheel be like you know bend sort of that way and uh na they weren't happy
S0115	um how uh how do that how d'that happen
S0037	so um i be i be wait at it be a it they're always tend to be at this one junction um and i be at this so i be come up to this junction and then um it's kind of a one where it's get three sort of um roads that fee into this roundabout and quite often it come to the point for some reason where there's because the the road so i'm come up i'm i'm sort of come towards the junction and there's a road come in from the right and there's a one sort of well both come in and go out to the right and also to the leave and on the leave that road's the road to the motorway so that's always jam it's always busy
S0115	yeah
S0037	so even though like so i'm come up to the roundabout even though you should give way to the person on the right the person on the right you can't give way to them if there's nowhere for them to go
S0115	yeah
S0037	so it's like a so you can go then cos if they can't if they can't go then you should go
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	d'you know what i mean if you if they're not gonna move then you should move but sometimes this end in like a weird stalemate like
S0115	yeah yeah i can imagine uh
S0037	where everyone's everyone's just stop at the roundabout and so then everyone go at the same time
S0115	but even
S0037	so it can be really dangerous but
S0115	but even so you can you've still get some sight of the person come at you haven't you
S0037	yeah so but what happen this time be it be exactly that so on the leave like it be it be block um the road go out to the leave be block and the road come in from the right they would just stop because there be nowhere for them to go
S0115	yeah
S0037	so the cyclist ahead of me just go round then the road come in from the leave they just think no there's no one come just go out and then just just they saw each other too late
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	and like they just just go into the cyclist the cyclist have their brake on and the car have their brake on but they just sort of clash no one fell off or anything but literally just bend the wheel like in half
S0115	yeah
S0037	and the cyclist be like you look what you've do to my bike rah rah rah
S0115	um and uh what what do you do if uh if that happen to your bike
S0037	sorry i'll just close that i don't know it's never happen to me actually i go into the
S0115	like you can't it you're not you're not insure you don't you don't pay road tax so you you you have
S0037	you can get bike insurance yeah
S0115	i i oh yeah i suppose like but you don't have all this like the same kind of uh
S0037	i don't know i mean you can though you can specifically claim i mean i've see i've see it advertise for like claim for that sort of thing depend
S0115	sort of thing be which which bike you drive i see yeah but it's not like car insurance where you can sort of you you you have to pay uh car insurance don't you
S0037	the other person's liable no you don't have to have bike insurance no
S0115	yeah
S0037	but um
S0115	but but if you didn't then but even if it be cause by someone else like what would you do if i mean cos i imagine if even if you don't have insurance of a bike not if it's someone else's fault they they would have to pay anyway wouldn't they so
S0037	i don't know i suppose you would have to like get the police involve like you usually need to have like some proof that there's be an accident like
S0115	yeah
S0037	um but i don't know it's never happen to me thankfully i mean i go into the back of another cyclist once and they snap off a bite of my um front um when i have my old bike my front sort of mud guard and i be really annoy
S0115	um they go into the back cos they stop and
S0037	but they slam the we be in a cycle lane a really narrow cycle lane and they have their
S0115	yeah so it's it's difficult there must be load of uh these kinds of you know like just like with cars
S0037	i know well they have their they have like a um a chip like a bike their bike lock um be on the back of the or or on the back or on the bike somewhere and it just fell off and so she just slam her brake on like didn't think so literally just like go from cycle quite fast to stop and so i just couldn't stop in time and my bike and i couldn't pull her like out of the way cos there be park cars on one side and traffic on the other so i just go into like just crunch into the back of her and i be like what what be you think like you just can't do that and she be like ah i'm really sorry and i be like you just snap off half the front of my thing and she's like yeah d'you want it back cos she'd pick it up and i be like grrr
S0037	but just one of those things but
S0115	yeah i guess you it's a much more because there's a lack of compulsory insurance uh uh and and also um well i guess that's how the compulsory insurance for cars start um but the the difficulty of uh prove um like like uh
S0037	i think so maybe i suppose the damage you can do liability
S0115	yeah i mean there's there's always like it's it's always gonna be you know hard to prove liability um but but i suppose we if you're look at car versus car then of course you've get the you've get the the evidence on both cars but whereas if it's car versus bike it may it may not have any evidence on the car
S0037	yeah
S0115	whereas the bike could be just be totally mangle or something like for but i mean uh if that's how like car insurance then
S0037	but you can get you can get bike insurance though
S0115	compulsory car cos you might've think well um we would we wouldn't we wouldn't have compulsory insurance instead we would just uh instead we would just find out you'd have a method of find out who's liable and then uh um simply make them pay you know when they when they have to pay you know
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	and no uh or or like yeah they they could have insurance if they want but they'd but you know but it's not compulsory so
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh but they'd they'd just take their chance and pay when they have to pay but i guess the difficulty be that you can't decide who who's cause it but then i suppose well they do decide who cause it so i mean perhaps that that's why they have it
S0037	well it's there's usually witness like if you have a crash like that where someone just like crash into your bike there's always gonna be people there
S0115	yeah
S0037	um
S0115	yeah i mean well it's it's it be it's different isn't it cos like
S0037	but i mean i've see like that that that one roundabout that i be talk about at road like it's really treacherous like there's um i once saw a chinese student i imagine student rid the wrong way around the roundabout and i be just like oh my god you're dice with death like
S0115	mind you though if you go the wrong if you go the wrong though it's like walk against cars you know they can see you really clearly so
S0037	that's true but they're genuinely surprise
S0115	you're you're you're probably probably a lot less uh likely to get into an accident if you if you're rid the wrong way cos they they can just see you and like
S0037	it be pretty bad though
S0115	i mean unless unless you ride directly into them but then that's like that's like rid directly into any inanimate object and then like
S0037	no no they didn't do that but but there's a funny bite after that like just as like if you're come from here to work like after you get over the roundabout there's a bite where it like filter down to so it really be only one lane like only one car and sometimes like most most cars and stuff like back right off and so they let you go through and then overtake you whence the once the road like broaden out again it's like a funnel sort of thing it really narrow and then it really and then there's a pedestrian cross and then it then it open and like
S0115	yeah just like a like a funnel like a egg timer
S0037	so if people back off i normally give them like a big thumb up like to say like thank sort of thing but sometimes people hassle you or try to like edge through at the same time
S0115	it's impossible yeah
S0037	and i've see so many people like just like tip off the bike there probably not really hurt but like just push you know like cars and vans and stuff just squeeze through and they lose their nerve and like just tip over onto the side and it's not very nice
S0115	mm
S0037	i'm lucky not to have have a big thing accident or anything i'm just gonna um get me wash out
S0115	alright shall shall i pause this uh
S0037	i don't mind i mean i just i've only get a few things that i want to get out but it's up to you
S0115	right
S0037	depend how it's go
S0115	uh well i'll i'll pause it and then do like an extra bite
S0037	what's it on
S0115	i don't actually know how to turn it off though it's on twenty two so i can do another another you know eight or something
S0037	okay
