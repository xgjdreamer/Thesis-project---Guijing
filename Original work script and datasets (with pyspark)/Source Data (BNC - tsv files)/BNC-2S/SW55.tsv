S0192	cool
S0227	and it wasn't erm ah
S0192	i'll have a look through it and make sure i've get everything
S0227	lloyds bank be that yours something about an overdraft facility or be that mine
S0227	no that's mine
S0192	yeah that's
S0227	or be that yours
S0192	mr yeah
S0227	no that's you
S0192	that's mine yeah er that's no mine
S0227	er
S0192	first aid train
S0227	so that's your university of
S0192	oh yeah don't need that that's yours be it
S0227	yeah that'll be mine so i think that's your your your your erm what's it's call so those paperwork i scan and send you be in that envelope
S0192	everything should be up here i'll have a look then
S0227	i've gotta download some photograph and send them to work
S0192	be that for work term and condition barclaycard oh it doesn't look any different i take it the pin doesn't change never get that money off barclaycard in the end
S0227	you mean what the ppi
S0192	yeah it just be
S0227	i think if you'd have press it you will probably if you have put it through a if if you put it through one of those ppi erm ambulance chase company they will take about a third if you're quite happy out of principle to say well i'll let you do all the run you'd probably get the money
S0192	yeah
S0227	they'd take thirty percent of it but
S0192	i be just it be make more complex by the fact i be in a different country
S0227	yep
S0192	have i have be here i'd have probably do that but er
S0227	well yes cos i think i think they've get a standard response in that it everyone send a letter they will contest it hop that er a number of these will fall by the wayside
S0192	yeah
S0227	and just accept it others will be more tenacious and they will carry on and they're the ones
S0192	well they be quite cheeky as well i'd actually just before this whole process ask them to up my credit allowance my credit limit
S0227	right
S0192	i think i be at about five grand or something like four and a half grand and i tell them i want more and they say no they deny me for an extension but then when i be apply for this they then send me a completely random thing through the post say congratulations i've be grant an extension and put it up from four and a half to seven seven
S0227	mm
S0192	so i get like seven thousand seven hundred
S0227	mm
S0192	so at that point i be i i really felt like they do that to
S0227	yeah
S0192	to kind of stop me
S0227	it
S0192	i can't be certain
S0227	it's nice to have that as a cushion
S0192	yeah i don't really use it and then if you don't use it they start try to take it away again and it's like why
S0227	mm
S0192	why take it away i mean i might use it
S0227	i'm try to use it yeah
S0192	i haven't do anything wrong
S0227	yeah now they're try to push you into it so that they you know they get the interest
S0192	so then my overdraft have be cut thank you very much so i mean all they've do by shut down this overdraft now be i'm gonna go and shut down this bank account
S0227	mm
S0192	so that they've just lose a customer basically
S0227	mm
S0192	it didn't cost them anything to allow me to
S0227	if i be you i would i would i would keep some i wouldn't close it down i've still get one that i have from royston that's get about twenty three p in it because you never know on a rainy day if you're gonna need it cos it's quite er a process to open up a bank account
S0192	yeah
S0227	so i'd just keep it there
S0192	yeah i mean i er yeah
S0227	cos if someone ever you know if you ever er prepare for a rainy day if someone whoever be come to look at your assets you can split your assets up and they'll think that you've only get one bank account why would you have two
S0192	yeah
S0227	so always it doesn't it doesn't cost you and it will you'll have to put effort to close it so don't just leave a couple of quid in there and let it run i've have a like i've say i've have erm a royston account for er thirty years
S0192	what do you think to erm have a joint account
S0227	erm yeah it's okay
S0192	and i be kind of gonna join our account or whatever you know
S0227	yeah well well er i'd discuss that funnily enough with she doesn't seem to want to go down that route herself
S0192	no
S0227	but that's her own neurosis erm erm in principle i'd say it's a good idea because you can save yourselves money like if you erm i say to her look join my premier because i she pay for gold and i pay for premier
S0192	yeah
S0227	fuse with mine and you save yourself the money of pay for the gold account
S0192	yeah i mean for us for and i every time we transfer money home we get charge about thirty pound and then we're send we're currently send it into two bank account
S0227	yes
S0192	and like i'm gonna get my final pay now and they owe me august pay and a bonus month's pay like my severance basically
S0227	yeah
S0192	so that's effectively four payments between the two of us
S0227	yes
S0192	and i be say to them look could you not just pay us august pay and my severance pay
S0227	yeah
S0192	into one bank account at the same time
S0227	yes yeah
S0192	therefore cost me thirty pound in fee but now i'm have to pay a hundred pound in fee no a hundred and twenty pound in fee
S0227	yeah
S0192	thirty for each of the four transactions
S0227	yes
S0192	it would just be easier if we
S0227	yeah well if she's up for it i would go for it
S0192	yeah i'm pretty sure she be
S0227	cos it's make financial sense
S0192	pretty sure she be yeah i need to fill out these form and then scan them in send them back to them yay
S0227	so you you'll be proofread i guess will it be something like that
S0192	proofread
S0227	what be it you're do for this er this little job
S0192	ah with the record
S0227	yeah
S0192	yeah i just explain to so cambridge university press
S0227	yes i never read any of the stuff i just know it say cambridge university in the in the
S0192	yeah it's not it's kind of do through them basically they're there's something call corpus linguistics
S0227	okay
S0192	corpus be body linguistics
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	language body of language they're erm they do a corpus about five or ten years ago and they collect three hundred million word from the british public in write down
S0227	mm
S0192	and then they use that corpus so you can come up with a phrase er let's think of er an idiom for example it's rain cat and dog
S0227	mm
S0192	we now all have these word in the database so any phrase that i wanna search the frequency of in the language i can type it in and it'll tell me out of one million word how many time do this occur what position do it occur in so they've now manage to find out like which word be the most commonly use
S0227	mm
S0192	all this kind of things and it's be useful for elt textbooks like teach english textbooks
S0227	mm
S0192	and all this kind of stuff
S0227	mm
S0192	and the learners like to hear you know that when they hear this version and this version do we say thank or do we say thank you well
S0227	mm
S0192	thank be seventy percent more common than thank you
S0227	mm
S0192	in british write language so now they're collect a speak corpus and they want something like a hundred thousand hours of record from the british public
S0227	right okay
S0192	so i'm get these it's pretty good pay i'm get pay eighteen pound an hour
S0227	that's good
S0192	for every hour of record i do be eighteen pound
S0227	yeah
S0192	now i have to at the end i have to go back obviously if i'm record friends get rid of anything incriminate
S0227	that's yeah
S0192	get rid of anything where there's background noise
S0227	yeah
S0192	in the car i record once in the car and it be the car be a bite too noisy so i'm hop that your car be a little quieter
S0227	well we have er do we have the windows open or do we
S0192	no we have the windows do up so it should be okay
S0227	oh right
S0192	outside be too windy to do it
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	so it i have to do some more work afterwards and i fill out consent form and all this kind of stuff
S0227	okay
S0192	but you know it's about an hour and a half's work for every hour
S0227	oh right
S0192	you get pay so it's not bad
S0227	no not at all well it's all all help doesn't it
S0192	i mean it's kind of the perfect job for when i come home really i don't have to go for a job interview or

S0192	oh wow
S0227	that's quite frighten isn't it
S0192	yeah
S0227	so if you go like here let's go to
S0192	do show you though that when you're a bite paranoid about the plane crash or something how many there be
S0227	yep so if you look at that that
S0192	oh there be a lot of plan
S0227	that flight there be you see it move
S0192	yeah it's pretty so find the one closest to fly over us now
S0227	that's er
S0192	indianapolis to to london
S0227	yeah
S0192	stansted
S0227	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0227	so it's outbound it's obviously gonna curl round
S0192	do a loop and land
S0227	yeah er er it's er oh no it's actually er what no that's it actually that's it should have land it's come in
S0192	yeah it seem to have go past the
S0227	yeah
S0192	the airport
S0227	so i don't know why it's do that er
S0192	maybe he can't land
S0227	let's see where this be go
S0192	there be quite a few plane's come in
S0227	yeah let's see where this one's go it hasn't get one for that one try that one
S0192	it's cos you're double click click once
S0227	oh right

S0227	yeah
S0192	surely that other one's to jfk too or somewhere in the state
S0227	yeah
S0192	yeah that's a nifty piece of software isn't it
S0227	that's and so i try to so what i do be i
S0192	presumably it's get like a five minute delay on it or something
S0227	i
S0192	oh uhu
S0227	load there and i be come over and and track
S0192	you be try to be you actually track my flight
S0227	i be try to find it but i couldn't with the number that you give me
S0192	no
S0227	cos you can use this type
S0192	like type it in
S0227	type to to to find the plane so i couldn't find it but you can see over this area there's not a great deal of plan
S0192	no yeah i come
S0227	like this one here be
S0192	i come on on that exact route i come up kind of across this way and then over that way
S0227	yeah
S0192	it's go to ulan bator
S0227	so it's go to
S0192	mongolia
S0227	yeah so it's go to um er it's go to incheon
S0192	yeah from from mongolia

S0192	not the it's get to somewhere and
S0227	yeah yeah god know
S0192	it's go to i have no idea where that one have you
S0227	no idea so it be quite a a cos like i say you could watch them and and you have this software like on your ipad and you're sit in the garden and you see a plane go over you can see what that plane be
S0192	mm
S0227	by erm just see that it's pass over us
S0192	it's pretty impressive isn't it
S0227	erm yeah i put my sit nav er when we go to france france i actually get it to work on the plane and the take off speed be about a hundred and seventy erm then you take off and it go quickly to three hundred and then it stay at three hundred for a while we go north then we go west and then we go south east which be the correct direction to go and er i think they be try to catch up on time because i lose it as we come to the english channel but the speed there be about five hundred and thirty five miles an hour but the towns be just literally go off i've get a five inch screen so it's just
S0227	they be just literally just move like that
S0192	and you're allow to have this on on the plane
S0227	yes
S0192	be you
S0227	yeah now they the the all the technology all they've get to do be put things it say you can use your phone and that just put them in flight mode
S0192	yeah
S0227	so er yeah
S0227	so you can use this er but i couldn't get a er i couldn't get lock on with er er when i come back from france i have it lock on at the airport but as it start to taxi to take off i lose the signal and i couldn't get it back
S0192	oh go
S0227	so that be it but i think i be er lucky that i be able to get it cos i'd try the year before and i i i think i'll give it another go erm and erm what i do be i'd actually lock up before i'd get on the plane i go in the plane you know and we be by the window so i could get it so that be
S0192	mm that's nice
S0227	that be actually quite interest because but be go ooh it'll break i say the plane could go twenty thousand miles an hour it's digital you see it's not mechanical
S0192	yes
S0227	for god's sake
S0192	she's think it's go to
S0227	yeah yeah the cog it'll break
S0227	bless her so that's quite funny mm
