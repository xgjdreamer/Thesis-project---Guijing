S0441	portugal
S0439	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0441	that be just that be really good actually that be nicely need
S0439	i be go to say you kind of get to this time of year with the sun and you're just a bite like oh my god i need to have some time off i need a break
S0441	i'm just so over people like this woman i mean fair enough she's she's obviously really really worry about her husband but he's get a a chest infection
S0439	yeah
S0441	and i won't see him before he be admit to hospital and i because she she she'd ring the gp and the gp be like not come out it's probably his medication and she ring me and be like we need to change the medication and i be like that's fine so we change the medication i go to see him and he do look he be like quite lethargic and sleepy sort of look in bed but because sort of i have it in my head that it be the medication he wasn't show any other sign really of have an infection so i just put it down to the medication anyway he's get an infection which be fine erm but i've get the feel she's go she she she's go to be a a real dick about it
S0439	because you didn't pick up the yeah
S0441	why didn't you pick it up it's like well why didn't you pick it up as well to be quite honest
S0439	yeah
S0441	cos you know anyway
S0439	but do you know like i've have a cold for like a week over a week now and like i'm still this like sniffy and shit today
S0441	mm
S0439	and i be like and someone be like maybe it's a virus and i be like mm i'd never even think about that like you don't know what's wrong with you and you
S0441	you don't and
S0439	you can't just put it down like be lethargic to an infection for fuck's sake
S0441	no and so he's get i i think he's get quite a bad infection
S0439	mm
S0441	but it sort of it sort of happen really quickly over a couple of days
S0439	where be the infection though
S0441	lung infection
S0439	oh oh
S0441	chest infection
S0439	but if he wasn't cough or anything like that then why would you assume he's get a lung infection
S0441	no well he be cough she not but not when i be there she say oh he's have this cough for like months and months and i be like okay fine
S0439	yeah
S0441	but
S0439	also you're not a doctor so it's not your job like
S0441	no anyway he's in hospital now which be fine so he's get look after and stuff but she ring me like when he's in hospital sort of i back off because that's not really my arena he's in hospital so he's be look after he's safe that fine so she be like i need you to change the medication again cos i think i i don't think it's help me cos he he's hallucinate and he's really slurry and i be like okay fine i don't think they'll be make any change whilst he's still physically unwell in hospital
S0439	yeah yeah
S0441	because he's physically unwell
S0439	yeah
S0441	so people especially older people react with hallucinate and slur of speech when they have an infection so i'm pretty sure it's still the infection
S0439	yeah same with a urine infection as well like it can really mess you up
S0441	yeah really mess you up so she's like oh but i'm i'm i'm really not sure i i think you'd be more supportive of me on this i be like well i be but i just i'm tell you now that i don't think it's go to help him all this medication change i think he should just stick to one
S0439	yeah cos like sometimes you have to get well not get over the side effect but you have to wait for it to settle down don't you
S0441	yeah but i don't really see what she want me to do she be like if have you ring the ward yet and i be like well no
S0439	mm
S0441	they're not go to tell me anything else from that that that they've tell you because you know i don't need to know really he's in hospital
S0439	yeah
S0441	and she's like well i i i say would you find it helpful if i liaise with the ward and she be like well yes i would okay well i i completely forget to do it today cos it's not it's not on my to do list at all
S0439	yeah yeah yeah if it's not part of your remit you're just yeah
S0441	so i be like shit i forget to do it so i ring her and it be her daughter and i be like i'm really sorry but erm i didn't get round to do it today i'll do it tomorrow morning and give give her an update call she be like oh well her mobile number be de de de if you want to ring her mobile and i be like well i'm go home now i didn't say that but i be like it's it's it's probably just better that i just you know
S0439	ring her with info yeah
S0441	ring her with an update not just babble on about that i haven't get an update god but she's just so like make almost make you feel guilty about it and it's like okay fine i'm really sorry that that your husband be unwell in hospital but he's in hospital
S0439	yeah it's the best place for him
S0441	it isn't like he's sort of wander around the streets be it
S0439	no some people when like when their like family be ill they become quite like
S0441	yeah
S0439	they lose not lose their priority but they kind of just they go a bite crazy themselves don't they
S0441	she's lose it i think i mean lose her sort of rationality a little bite
S0439	yeah just that obviously she must be a bite stress
S0441	and i i i can understand that it's probably
S0439	and it must be an awful situation
S0441	it's probably quite scary
S0439	but there's nothing you can do like
S0441	i can't yeah there's nothing i can do and she be like i'm i'm go to speak to the doctor about it yeah and i be like well they won't prescribe him anything different because it's not that isn't in their remit they don't do er psychiatric drug that for a a psychiatrist to
S0439	yeah yeah yeah
S0441	but she just doesn't even seem to understand that i don't know she's a bite manipulative actually
S0439	i get that impression from my boss this morning not this morning when be it one day last week she send out an email and we be basically our job have change and we've start take on a lot of of extra admin work because of our role change and then she send round this email and it be just like now i've be speak to blah blah blah the controller of erm this system we're use and she's say that our new process be work really well and you know we've just get a few tweeks to make but it's work really well
S0441	mm
S0439	and i message one of the other girls on my team i be like do she ask you if you be happy with how the new system be work cos i'm not entirely sure who have tell her that this new process be work well because it's really not
S0441	so she's just lie
S0439	she's just yeah she's just like send round this email be like oh yeah this program be or this new process be really work well everybody's get on board no we're not i haven't even use the new process yet because i'm avoid it because it's so shit
S0439	like
S0441	what an idiot
S0439	it's just like who do you ask
S0441	mm
S0439	to think that this process be work you just want to justify give us all this extra bureaucracy
S0441	mm
S0439	i be so annoy and then be just like she be like yeah i hate it i've actually mess up every time i've do it i be like well
S0441	yeah
S0439	yeah
S0441	it's that good silly woman
S0439	oh i know
S0441	oh no i speak to this man today it's really sad he's get his he's get his wife's get dementia

S0439	it's just part of the the illness isn't it

S0439	oh i see yeah
S0441	so that's go to be interest but we we we have get the same name so i think that's some good good grind

S0441	i think you she's feel a bite like she need children in her life at the moment so
S0439	what your mum
S0441	yeah
S0439	it's cos she's wait for you to crack out some baby
S0441	it's like i really can't wait for you and to have children that that that mean no rush and i be like hey
S0439	be you sure mum
S0441	be you sure
S0439	god do do like get broody or do think about children
S0441	he love baby
S0439	do he
S0441	absolutely love baby more than i do i don't even like baby really
S0439	that's true actually
S0441	he love them
S0439	do you think do you think he want them then
S0441	yeah
S0439	no but i mean like soonish
S0441	not now

S0441	let's hope
S0439	even longer even
S0441	my granny's devastate

S0439	and they're not
S0441	they're not
S0439	and they don't even feel ready for children and they're like thirty something or like nearly thirty late twenties early thirties so
