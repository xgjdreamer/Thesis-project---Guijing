S0041	oh god know it just show you the calibre of person that he's go for if they're will to introduce their kid to some randomer they've meet off the internet and barely know frigging nut
S0086	mm how's your chilli good hit the spot
S0041	i put it in a deceptive bowl though
S0086	quite a lot of it
S0041	especially consider it's my second dinner
S0086	it's not really your second dinner ham and egg be not really dinner be it nutter
S0041	and a fajita
S0086	no it's still not dinner
S0041	yeah cos i be think about it today i think actually i can't be hack with try to organise something to come
S0086	that you don't even want to have
S0041	yeah that i don't even want to have for people to come here and i'm go to be concern about what the hell he's be up cos i haven't have any part in it cos if i want to do it i'd want to decorate the place you know and put neon you know neon linen on the wall or something you know really do the place out
S0086	yeah
S0041	not some half hearted all my mat have a party at my house so yeah let's go
S0086	yeah weird and i think you know and have be on at me about have party i think you know we can have one in the summer but one that we've all organise one that we're all involve in not for your birthday be tell well that's what's happen
S0041	yeah i just i don't understand the logic behind it
S0086	i know it worry me and even you do fell embarrass get your mat over here cos you don't know what sort of person he's go to be invite
S0041	mm well i don't know who this mark be but if it's who i'm think of he be a weirdo
S0086	yeah i think he's that skinny little one
S0041	skinny weirdo yeah like and crazy horse be one thing to contend with but the whole motley crew
S0086	yeah and then that weird one that be with for a while and the fat one that be who we though be wasn't it
S0041	mm no it's just all too it's all too much to be honest i'd rather just go over the village for a few drink and then come into town
S0086	yeah well that's the thing it's your prerogative it's your birthday that's what you get to do you get to do you get to choose you don't get to be tell by your housemate you've get to have a chavtastic barbecue and like it
S0041	fuck
S0086	i wonder if grace be coo round to be like oh be you go i the house
S0041	to be honest i'd rather have her back than bloody
S0086	noisy feet
S0041	noisy feet upstairs what i be think actually be that they've we've start do package at the hotel for cocktail make and we go and it'll be that do it basically teach you how to make a cocktail
S0086	fun
S0041	and then or teach you how to make two cocktails and then he give you load of ingredients and split you into two team and you have to make your own cocktail and then he judge the winner and whatever one win be the cocktail of the week at the hotel
S0086	wow that's such a good idea
S0041	yeah and i think i think it's like twelve pound a head for one to have one cocktail each out of it or twenty pound head to have two cocktails reach out of it but we pay half price anyway
S0086	winner
S0041	cos i get fifty per cent off at the hotel don't i
S0086	that sound like a bargain do that extend to your friends
S0041	yeah i think i'd book it and pay for the lot
S0086	oh right
S0041	so as far as they're concern i pay for everything
S0086	it's all on your bill it's your bill
S0041	mm
S0086	ah well that sound pretty excite
S0041	so that would be fun thing to do
S0086	yeah it sound really fun even if it be at work it's whether you want to spend your birthday at work but even
S0041	yeah but we'd only be there for an hour or two
S0086	yeah and then you're well place you know for carry o the festivities
S0041	yeah so i think that would be fun
S0086	mm
S0041	something easy you know when i don't it's easily do it's not expensive and then
S0086	yeah and then and then you know cocktails aare always nice see where the night take us i can't believe how soon it's come in
S0041	i know
S0086	yeah we won't talk about date
S0041	no
S0086	i use to tell like when she be finish off her phd i be like don't worry there's only a month to go and she be like fuck like fuck fuck fuck stop say that obviously that mean you've only get a month to go and you've get to do all this work
S0041	mm no i'm not no no
S0086	i think just put your foot down
S0041	i'm gonna 's on holiday this week when she come back next week i'm gonna ask her and just make sure that we'll all get it all half price
S0086	yeah
S0041	cos they have like life if it's a a deal then you don't get half price or something i don't know i don't know if his count as an offer i don't think it be it's standard package i'll ask her
S0086	mm it's a good idea to do it at the hotel good little money spinner
S0041	have make a video to teach the f and b staff how to like shake the cocktail thing and all the trick swing it round
S0086	ah nice so what do do
S0041	everything he's the one that get run rag all the time

S0041	yeah could have be any anywhere in case there be two of you

S0041	right i think she might have come up when i google
S0086	yeah bitch
S0041	but i didn't look at her
S0086	i think we must be relate distantly because i know that sound mental but it's not a a common name so i think we're all like all the s and all the s which be my mum's maiden name we're all relate so it's all quite em quiet em em eh what's the opposite of common rare scarcer
S0041	rare
S0086	rarer
S0041	more rare
S0086	more rare
S0041	all the rare
S0086	not the rare so but yeah it's probably some sort of cousin great grandmother twice remove or something sound about right
S0041	ah when i run round earlier i get half way round i be like ah i've get a snotty nose ah i i look really attractive as you can imagine
S0086	mm mm there's nothing quite like go for a run to make yourself look horrendous
S0041	yeah come back in sweat and he's just quite normal buzz off
S0086	ah it's good for you
S0041	whatever so i figure i'm do nothing this afternoon yes i be so so tempt to pub so tempt to pub
S0086	really
S0041	yeah
S0086	good girl though
S0041	em
S0086	especially on a budget
S0041	yeah yeah budget would not stretch
S0086	mm mm
S0041	em and then it's go to have to be aqua tomorrow cos otherwise my legs be not go to move unfortunately
S0086	aqua aqua tomorrow that sound good and i might go for a little run after work cos what time be aqua six forty five or something
S0041	maybe
S0086	one of one of those things
S0041	maybe it's six thirty
S0086	oh that's fine so i'll still be home by five i mean be suppose to come over for dinner but i haven't hear from him he's in some sort of work crisis
S0041	oh that's a point if it's six thirty i might not make it in time will i
S0086	no i wonder if i can give oh cos you're not drive or walk
S0041	yeah
S0086	i could pick you up but we won't if it's six thirty we won't get there in time with the traffic we will have to check this i think it be you say it be six forty five but it might not be six thirty yeah i get the old mobile out in a minute
S0041	we might make it if i take my swim stuff with me
S0086	it's just get out of that's the only problem cos that time
S0041	mm once you get to here it's like ten minutes from here
S0086	but that that's the problem isn't it but then at least you know not that it would have be school traffic at the at time any way but the school aren't in but then that mean that the town traffic like shop close time that's go to be busy
S0041	yeah it didn't take me very long today cos i before i come home which time what time be i home for cos i text when i get in i get in at half six and i go from the hotel up road to see what time the sunbed be open till park the car get out walk round to the sunbed walk round back to the car and drive home
S0086	okay i mean it's just that you've get to avoid road but that's fine cos i guess form the hotel
S0041	oh i drive up road
S0086	oh do you be it alright
S0041	i go i go from it look bad because the traffic's at a standstill once it move
S0086	mm but it move quite quickly
S0041	but once it move you move go from the hotel down past where the police station use to be or still be up road to the other side of the bridge park go in the thingy back out again go down road up road
S0086	oh fine okay
S0086	bless you
S0041	so it might be possible
S0086	but to be honest em
S0041	or if i put my swim if i take my swim costume with me put it on under my dress that when we get there i just have to strip off
S0086	well that's fine if i if you walk i will run come home get in the car get you em and then this fine and i'll be at work be there somewhere that i can wait
S0041	yes you won't need to wait though but yes opposite the hotel there's little road that go behind use to wait down there cos otherwise it's theyou can wait on the driveway
S0086	but then they might try and park you
S0041	they might try and park you but also if another car come the can't get round you
S0086	well i'll try and time it that i'm there at six but i'll probably try and leave a bite early because of the traffic so if i leave here at quarter to
S0041	well i could probably leave early tomorrow if everyone else have leave again
S0086	that's true
S0041	might be able to sneak out
S0086	get the old mobile on the go when i'm on my way it's look pretty unhappy
S0041	look at that bad boy
S0086	i should have put it outside i know it's massive but it just i think it's go to really need repot and be outside but it's still a bite cold at night
S0041	do it know the temperature
S0086	it do know the temperature but the good thing be it's chillies so they grow in like desert and shit so in theory you don't you wouldn't need to ever water it which be obviously what i'm do
S0041	eh yeah
S0086	with that all that whole swim pool set underneath that there
S0041	yeah that little pool yeah
S0086	that little he yeah get a bite carry away
S0041	yep
S0086	so i might drain that away and give it a bite water actually that's a bite grim but there be like compost and stiff out there and flower pot so i'm think i might do that at the weekend
S0041	chuck them in those pot
S0086	yeah get a wash my bike cos it's pretty grim think about go to pound land and look for car shampoo
S0041	ah yeah that's good do you go into town thus afternoon then
S0086	yeah but i just take the stiff back to primark and then leave really quickly before i get distract by all of the things that i need
S0041	yes yeah that's wise
S0086	i be go to take things to the charity shop but as much as you know i'm in to charity shop i think if i go in i'll only buy more stuff if i'm go to car booty things even if i get a pound you know it's better than a poke in the face
S0041	i do like do the charity shop
S0086	yeah get some right old bargain but i don't need new things
S0041	no i'm gonna need a new dress

S0086	oh right
S0041	i be just like when he be on the phone before obviously he start talk about women canoodle and obviously that be all too too raw too raw eh i be walk home and i be say he say ooh when could all this take place and i've be through this for him a million time so if someone else drop out then i can in september that's the plan the likely hood of that happen be pretty slim but that's what we're hop for
S0086	yeah
S0041	he's like right okay and i say em and then obviously there'll be twelve week intensive train then after that it'll be more leadership base so i just have to get through the twelve week power on through cry every day
S0086	yeah
S0041	secretly cry
S0086	sob
S0041	sob secretly
S0086	defeat be tell me s story about how he have to get into bed like he couldn't move his arm because of the weight train for three days couldn't move his arm because he be be a pillock probably and do above what he should have be do and they're really really push him so he's like yeah of course i can do it of course i can do it because he's like a fuck monkey and eh he couldn't get it when he get into bed he have to get into bed like that like in the foetal position and then like try and hook the duvet up like with his knee over it because he couldn't extend his arm and then he have to get his leg and like get his leg to extend his arm and he would cry because his arm hurt that much that's what they're i just want out to be aware
S0041	i won't be have to do that
S0086	i would hope not
S0041	no
S0086	and obviously you will not be do ridiculous things like him like yesterday when he be like it's run a five minute mile and then he literally destroy himself twenty things
S0041	no i won't have to do that no no no no no no
S0086	it's mad so yes you'll have a twelve week intensive don't break your arm
S0041	death try not to break your arm don't let them see you cry
S0086	don't let them see you cry
S0041	want to kill yourself more or less every day
S0086	yeah don't laugh in their face also
S0041	yeah yeah
S0086	turn out they don't like that
S0041	not turn out i'm not sure i'll be able to hold that but if it's go to result in death then i think i'm one be more scar
S0086	iron your bed at night
S0041	if they seriously do that i'm just go to laugh like
S0086	that's what they do they sleep on the floor
S0041	that's the problem
S0086	they iron their bed
S0041	like if i have to go on with the kid if i have to go in with the kid i'm not go to take it seriously
S0086	yeah i know
S0041	they'll be shit themselves and i'll be like be you take the piss
S0086	have you be in the real world
S0041	yeah like eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five twenty six eight years i'll have on these people eight years of life and i'll be like be you actually have a laugh
S0086	do they pit you all in together then people go in as an officer and people go into
S0041	no officer be all together rat be all together but obviously you can't be an officer unless you've do you're a level so although you would be eighteen the likely hood of anybody that's eighteen years old get throughout interview bite at the end be very unlikely they'd probably minimum age twenty
S0086	oh good okay
S0041	so that's a bite more
S0086	that's more bearable that's only six years
S0041	yeah em
S0086	hilarious so your dad didn't really realise when you would be go then
S0041	no so when i say this he be like oh right and then twelve weeks train so
S0086	and i say yeah and then you get to come and see my pass out parade note me say you can come not if you can come cos i might not do it we'll go with yes i will yes i can and em he's like oh yes that should that should be about december time and i be like yes obviously by which time after all the run all the time every day i will be so fit i'll be walk round in a bikini and everyone will be say charlie but it's minus one and i'll be say do my abs give fuck
S0041	and he be like oh yeah i could he say of yeah i can shut see it now pass out day no one's on the stiff and you've get a bikini on to match your hat i be like yeah if you see a blue one while you're out
S0086	yeah i can just see that you maniac
S0041	like the photograph you have for your graduation except that i'm bikinied can you imagine do you think they'd throw you out for that
S0086	em i think they'd take it pretty seriously yeah it's a pretty big deal i think you know
S0041	i mean i don't think i'm go to tell them hat at the interview
S0086	i plan on just wear a bikini
S0041	yeah
S0086	i mean you say this now but i think you've forget how fuck cold it be when it's minus one so you might really want to be parade round in your bikini but em no you might actually you might actually be blue yourself from hypothermia so
S0041	match the hat
S0086	match the hat yeah and then the lips go blue and then you die so
S0041	yeah
S0086	mm that's wrong
S0041	probably didn't think that through far enough do i
S0086	mm well it's a plan it's a definite plan
S0041	my eye feel really dry like there's no eye juice in them
S0086	keep blink
S0041	it's like a rave
S0086	yeah disco disco i don't want to go to work tomorrow
S0041	i really don't want to go to work tomorrow
S0086	mm say it isn't true
S0041	ah ed be say we have an apple conference in last week obviously he do all the help around the people out there and i hide in the office em apple approach him to poach him
S0086	really
S0041	and they say you know we we very rarely do recruitment event co we just head hunt people we go to enough place to spot the people that we want eh how much be you on here so he lie and say twenty he's not he's probably on what i'm on
S0086	really
S0041	twenty okay well we can offer twenty one would you leave
S0086	nice and be he owe time
S0041	in the shop i think it's just a sales assistant job
S0086	oh okay you get a wear a t shirt say i'm a genius or something don't they
S0041	well yeah yeah
S0086	so that's pretty awesome
S0041	but em yeah once you're in apple apparently it's quite difficult get promote cos they're all very yeah we all love everything frigging nutters so they're all like there be all the people that be there be very brand eared like they're very we love apple we all want to progress in the apple
S0086	mm mm yeah that would cheese you right off
S0041	yeah wouldn't it
S0086	oh that's pretty excite though it us be nice to be headhunted
S0041	mm
S0086	we have em we have an email come round they do these things call announce i presume i don't know i've get this instant reflex where i delete it and then everyone's like do you read the announce no tell me summarise very quickly in ten second and i will have lose interest em within elt our business they they're very they have they've have two restructure in the two years that i've be there and then we're also in another restructure so we're restructure ourselves into the original structure that be destructured so we're constantly in a state of flux like no one's ever no one's ever really in one position at all you're just constantly move
S0041	yeah i love that
S0086	so that's nice that's you know fluid em and they'd create these three head of business like one for school book one for school publish one for adult book publish and one for exams publish but exams which be the list i work on be do its own rogue thing in the corner because they work with assessment but no one really understand what they do so there be three but the exams one be over the secret things
S0041	a bite mental secret squirrel things
S0086	nobody would go and talk to them cos they do their own secret thing so no one really understand that but it's fine
S0041	yeah assessment one of our biggest clients
S0086	yeah it's cos esol an just do what they like because we we need them so they go oh we're only go to pay you x amount of money oh okay
S0041	nice
S0086	but can we still use your
S0041	i be talk to somebody from actually
S0086	oh nice
S0041	his name's nig call
S0086	ah yeah yeah
S0041	but we call him in the office and i call him eh
S0086	the
S0041	the 's here not that i've ever meet i just speak to him a lot on the phone
S0086	yeah i don't know what he look like i don't think he i wouldn't work with me but obviously there's a thousand people on site so
S0041	well yeah that's what i mean i see the name and i think ooh liz might know him and i think how the fuck that go to happen
S0086	definitely go to look him up in connections tomorrow but em so they restructure this restructure about six months ago and em and obviously now we we're now in in the new restructure and one of them have be headhunted y the head of you know it's like an alternative to a level have be head hunt to be the head of she's go to go and work in but she's go to you know
S0041	what the fuck seriously
S0086	yeah yeah she's go to go and
S0041	how the hell do that happen
S0086	create their publish program in relation to the curriculum its fuck she's go to be on ridiculous money but she's only just be appoint as this head of em school book publish literally a matter of months ago so i read the i actually read this announcement one of the few that i actually do
S0041	which you hadn't delete
S0086	yeah yeah cos everyone be like have you hear 's leave i be like no hang on wait a minute let me get go through my trash em and they say yeah she's you know she's be recruit to be head of whatever and we're all very excite blah de blah okay wow it's amaze speak to it turn out the they that she work in education and i work in elt that their head of education be headhunted first she turn it down but say to her boss like the director i've be headhunted i want a better position and i want more money and they go okay oh my god right stay and we'll create this new this new role for you which be announce last week and now i know why because that that be her bargain chip cos she be the one who be actually headhunted she turn it down she turn it down and now 's get it but it's so good because i mean it's a it's a fantastic opportunity for anybody to be em headhunted at that level but it's a woman like it's a female it's really good it's really really good cos even though publish be a be a real female orientate industry the top job be still blokes
S0041	yeah it's the same in any industry isn't it i know it sound really old fashion but it's true you hot a certain level and then it's male dominate
S0086	well it's disgust and it shouldn't be the case so it's nice it's refresh actually cos even on our senior management team the majority position be hold by men and that's only middle management
S0041	yeah
S0086	so yeah it's really it's difficult
S0041	i think it's because men be men be easier at piggy back i've say this for years a good manager a good ceo be a good piggy backer they're not good at anything themselves but they're god a see who's good at the stuff and use people
S0086	yeah absolutely
S0041	and i think women and less incline to do that
S0086	yeah well you you sort of you take a lot of responsibility on your own shoulder i think that's she difficulty
S0041	or if you're in a team you want to work with the team not use the team and i think once you get to a certain level you've get to be able to extract yourself from it
S0086	yeah yeah yeah absolutely
S0041	and see even above the top line like my dad be say and i be debate go in as an officer or a rat i be like i don't really want to i want to be invoke with people and he be like no no no do you want to be give the order or take the order and i be like yeah but it'll be your whole if cos you'll be there all the time there's no go home from work and he be like yeah but you're still go to have friends there they'll just be on a similar level to you and i say but like he say well i never go home do i i be on the side i say but be you friends with them he say no i say well there you go i want friendships out of it and he say well i still go out with them but they're more acquaintances and for him it be very easy and it always have be he's always down the same job that
S0086	he could draw a line
S0041	yeah and i think i think girls naturally find it more difficult cos you don't i think girls like to please each other more than man do
S0086	yeah yeah absolutely yeah yeah or or you find that you get i think that's the problem that women then try and adopt male attribute in order to progress and they're either see as ah you know she's be a cow or women get it slightly wrong or they go a bite you know or they just delegate everything and they just piss on their throne we like one of our directors be female and she's just a massive twat she doesn't do anything she just delegate everything and the everyone end up really stress and motivate as oppose to feel empower to do stuff because they're be utilise for their articular skill set they're not there just become dig body de skilled and demotivated so
S0041	oh my god so today i go on the em website for the company i use to work for
S0086	mm
S0041	and before i leave i be try to encourage him to retain to work on his retention but he just he don't he want to do it but he just never really implement it and i say well i'm do all this market i need a bigger market base so every time somebody ask for a quote i should have their detail i should have their at least their email address whack on market list i say cos as long as it's relevant to them then we're not spamming them
S0086	yeah
S0041	he's like yeah okay so we should do that and then i say okay encourage people even just to leave their information if i put if i write some things to go on like a guide to a guide to translation or guide to search engine optimisation but in a foreign language even if it's just like a little bite of information for people that have never do it before so just like side of a four which some things some people already know but people don't know about like the software that automatically translate stuff like translation memory people don't know whether tis you assume they do cos we've be in this field for a long time and he's be in it for like twenty years
S0086	yeah
S0041	well usually people don't know that exist every time you send something to a translator they put it through a machine basically that remember it break down the sentence in smaller chunk and remember it so if one time you translate and there be and it come up later as you start to write it auto populate it and you can see and click yes or no which be great because especially if you work for say microsoft and you get stuff from them every month the way they phrase things their terminology be go to repeat through everything they do it's quicker for you to click yes than it be to translate it so it speed it up it make it more accurate and more consistent and therefore more cost effective cos you don't get charge for the repetition
S0086	okay
S0041	they charge you i think it's like five per cent of the unit price for any word that be repeat so in layman's term it take a long time to explain and he didn't really get it but i be tell people and they be like ah what's that then i be like you know like in word when you write the date you write the first two letter and it bring it up and you can put yes or onto that's basically it em so i write three three different things for him i say if we put them on the website people want to click to download their free information on whatever it be and then in order to download it you ask for their email cos they're get something cos they're get free information and we're get something cos we get their email go on the fuck website today leven's top tip for something or other my fuck write
S0086	oh god
S0041	as be as if he's do it
S0086	really
S0041	and he's edit some of it relay poorly and the font oh my god oh my god whoever choose the typeface the typeface isn't the same as the rest of the brand of the company
S0086	nice
S0041	and it it's all wonky like i don't
S0086	have they get a copy writer in to do it or would they just have do it themselves
S0041	publish it themselves
S0086	urgh
S0041	but we do have a typesetter like work on indesign how the hell she let that go through i think it's more of a a thing of taste as oppose to anything else
S0086	jesus yeah
S0041	but yeah as his own not even accredit or nothing
S0086	yeah not even a message to say thank again for this idea i'm go to run with it just fyi
S0041	yeah not even idea i'd write it
S0086	oh right its actually the text that you leave
S0041	i'd write everything yeah i'd write three separate things leave them with him
S0086	oh god yeah
S0041	and he's take part of one and part of the other and mosh it together and it's bad
S0086	ah
S0041	yeah but i be like what the fuck
S0086	yeah
S0041	gutted
S0086	that's shitty that's absolutely shitty

S0041	eh yeah
S0086	it's em i don't know
S0041	go to go with yeah
S0086	em yeah
S0041	although i haven't look for my card
S0086	you never have your card they know you now
S0041	i know but i remember it last time and then i forget it again and they get annoy at me
S0086	yeah
S0041	for forget it
S0086	they think you're ditzy
S0041	what the hell be it i wonder if it's down the side of the bed i think i'd leave it
S0086	it's probably in the bed everything's in the bed if in doubt it's one the bed
S0041	earthier be that
S0086	you know this now
S0041	but i remember last time i have it be when i go swim and i don't remember take it back out of my bag but it's certainly not in there now which might mean it's go forever
S0086	mm it might have it might be go then what will have to happen will they issue you with another card
S0041	they'll make me buy another card
S0086	maybe they'll just shoot you
S0041	i think that might be the option
S0086	you know that norwegian guy that kill seventy seven people last year
S0041	yeah
S0086	they find him sane
S0041	yeah
S0086	yeah he's have two medical assessments and the one last year say that he be insane and that he couldn't stand trial and now this one's find him sane but you do have to wonder be they just find him sane that he so that he can stand trial even though he's mental because anyone that kill seventy seven people and think because it's because they're all potential terrorists be probably a bite fuck mental so he he
S0041	he kill them all because he think they be all potential terrorists ah that's
S0086	he be on a crusade
S0041	wow that sound usual
S0086	yeah i mean the first one diagnose him as a paranoid schizophrenic so i don't know how you could get it so wrong
S0041	no
S0086	how can one one lot of people say yeah he's fuck insane
S0041	fuck crazy
S0086	and others be like no
S0041	he's fine
S0086	sound as a penny put him on trial and then shoot him no i don't think they have the death penalty in norway
S0041	they don't do that do they
S0086	i hope not i think it's just barbaric place like the us
S0041	mm
S0086	ah in a recent letter to a norwegian tabloid he say be send to a psychiatric ward would be a fate worth than death to send a political activist to an asylum be more sadistic and more evil than kill him say the crazy person
S0041	oh so the crazy person say he's not crazy he say he's a political activist
S0086	the crazy person think that it would be worse to send you to a psychiatric ward
S0041	well i suppose they would drug you all the time and keep you in under
S0086	and but he refer to himself as a political activist he's a murder kill seventy seven people
S0041	although i think i would quite enjoy be sedate for a little while
S0086	em yeah
S0041	think how relax it would be
S0086	yeah i mean who need be a brain come on lobotomy come on get it out
S0041	i often think that i should have lobotomy a temporary lobotomy you know just for like a day or two
S0086	just put it in a jar or something put it back in
S0041	yeah yeah you know like when you have a break up or you've get load go on and you just think oh for god's sake you know those days when you can't stop your brain
S0086	yeah you can
S0041	play scenarios
S0086	maybe not a lobotomy maybe an on off switch
S0041	mm that'd be easier than have the whole thing out and put back in again wouldn't it
S0086	just a bite messy i think bite fiddle some
S0041	mm
S0086	and they're attach like you know nerve end and stuff
S0041	mm
S0086	i mean unless we all you know have medical degrees
S0041	or that crazy guy we watch the other day we need to do eight minute abs i probably should have do that before i have the ice cream
S0086	man my abs today be really kill me have me do scissor kick and all kinds of shenanigans yesterday i have to do i do press up let's not get carry away cos i could only od one a time and then i have to collapse but he be sleek you're do really well you're do and whether he be just say that because he be like god she's she's a fool she can't do a press up but before he be it be really funny actually because i would like give him a bite of cheek like i can't do the number twenty ones like when i have to do like that and then that and then the full one ah i be really hurt i have to do that mean and i be like i can't do it and then he be like right we're go to do press up now and i be like no i can't do it and he be like right you've get to do ten now i be like no honestly i can't do press up well you've get to do twelve now no but everything be i've try to do press up before and i can't do them well you're do fifteen now i say well the thing be i'm go to start talk now cos you're go to make me do now and i i do ten
S0041	you manage to do ten real press up
S0086	yeah well i have i collapse between each one cos he be like just dig and actually what he be say be quite a good tip that i'd never hear be dig your toe in if you dig your toe in you've get a you've get something to help you up with because before i be like how do you or i don't have any upper arm strength so i just can't do it and what i find be i be always drop my bum which be why i have trouble swim i think i drop my bum rather than be like a plank rather than to be up down up down it would be more like that so i'd kind of go up as one and then drop and then down so it would be a bite it be never really even
S0041	i really want to try après up but i'm a bite scar now
S0086	it's really not a fun time it's really not a fun time so tats' why tomorrow i have to go run cos i didn't really do any cardio yesterday just go to bloody fish game which be shit by the way
S0041	fish game ah
S0086	on the row i always keep get eat big fish always come to eat me
S0041	hang on a second you actually have a game
S0086	on the row machine it's call go fish
S0041	no
S0086	you'd think it would be really fun but it's shit
S0041	yeah
S0086	basically what happen be the more the in theory what happen the harder you row your fish start off at the bottom and there be little fish that be smaller than you that you get to eat to accrue point but there's big fish that will eat you and then you die and then you lose point and depend on how fast you row you move up and down the the space on the screen so if there's big fish at the top you want to kind of slow it down so you fall back down the screen and then you get to eat the little fish but then there's a big fish come out the bottom you've get to speed up sp that's you're on the top in theory but even when you're go row like a fuck maniac you're not move very quickly so you just get really annoy co then you get eat
S0041	oh
S0086	but i it's quite it take your mind off the fact that you're row cos that's fuck bore let's be honest but
S0041	yeah i don't have that game
S0086	it's a really good work out
S0041	i really want to see if i can do a boy press up i don't think i can
S0086	mm mm i think i might actually die if i try to do one i'll try and do one in a minute when i've eat my from you but today man alive i try to get out of bed and i go ah cos he be get me to do ones for my top abs and one for my lower abs or something
S0041	what do this entail that's what i think i need an abs workout
S0086	it be quite good actually it be em sit up and we've get one of those ones where it hold your feet but you have to you're lie down so so gravity be sort of work against you so you have to work harder but it mean that your feet be be trap so it make it that bite easier in a way so it's it's a bite weird but i i don't really like do those i can only do like three set of fifteen on that and the we do ones one the mat but with em like a kettle bell and you've get to move your body from side to side as you sit up
S0041	ah yeah
S0086	and that be that be quite good actually i find that have something in my hand actually make it easier
S0041	ah
S0086	like as a sort of way to motivate your body to get up have this weight and then like put it down on the mat so that you're move your whole body cos what he's like you're move your legs you're cheat you're you're still you're cheat now so he come and sit on my feet which help it be put if you put it down on the mat you actually really make your body move so come and go mm yeah this be fine he's he be like yeah but your' do it wring okay fine
S0041	damn it
S0086	yeah and then there be all kind of press up occur make want to cry
S0041	really want to try it really bad i don't think i can do it through
S0086	mm what he be say he's get some pad for kickboxing i be like i really like kickboxing from when i go before he's like well i could take you and try it out for weekend for kickboxing
S0041	that sound fun
S0086	which would be really fun cos when we use to go the guy use to make us like run up and down the room and like do lunge and kick really fast and it be really fast pay and i remember when i use to come home i be really buzz i felt so energetic ad so just really buzz like really pump and even when i have like a workout now you know when you're have good run you sort of feel like yeah i could keep go i feel really good and then then you die
S0041	well yeah of course
S0086	i think like have that the difference with that be just do yourself and have a class with that person there to motivate you it really really help it's quite nice when 's there cos i just have a bite of a laugh like every time i laugh he make me do more so i try not to laugh cos he's a bastard mm but he do make me laugh so
S0041	sound fun yeah to be honest it be really nice have nick there today i realise that i would never want to go anywhere with anyone do anything ever
S0086	no
S0041	no never ever
S0086	i really would like a personal trainer
S0041	yeah
S0086	so expensive though
S0041	yeah if i could afford it i would certainly have personal trainer all the time
S0086	mm definitely mm
S0041	i'd love that
S0086	mm
S0041	hey ho i be think i've make no plan for the weekend actually i quite like it that way to be honest
S0086	yeah especially when live in a budget
S0041	yeah
S0086	mm
S0041	sound like a granny but i'm really look forward to sleep tonight i feel like i've not really sleep properly for age it's like kate's be get me up for do or i have a lie in at the weekend and it didn't feel good enough
S0086	i wake up i think it must have be 's boyfriend rattle the bike chain at five o'clock this morning if he's get to leave at that time then i just don't understand why he have to stay i mean to be fair i haven't hear him for age but it's not and he be i could tell he be try to be quiet but really i just think if you're go to be leave at five why stay
S0041	the thing that i don't understand be that he's an adult you're not a teenager you know you're not you're not a young person be a little bite selfish you're a fifty year old bloke have some self respect
S0086	yeah it's weird
S0041	you would never i don't know any man that would knowingly wake up a household i just don't i mean i just don't know those people be quiet or not i mean it's just so so childish tap around like that you just wouldn't degrade yourself in that way just have some dignity you're a fully you you're a fully grow man behave like one
S0086	it be like when we when we have the argument with he just slop of upstairs didn't he
S0041	yeah god you'd be so embarrass if that be your boyfriend or whatever wouldn't you and he behave like that
S0086	horrendous like i barely speak to these days
S0041	no me neither she be in here earlier and she barely look up
S0086	i just don't really have anything to say to her it be nice at she take craig that dinner though
S0041	yeah yeah i didn't expect hat
S0086	it be really nice but em i'm just think it i appreciate that he's really make an effort to be quiet but i you have it's always hop to wake us up cos it's a relay the wall be really thin and the bokes be noisy and if you be owe to be get up at that time just don't leave your bike out the front go out the back because i can hear in the kitchen she be up and that's what fuck you off like why do we wake up just because your boyfriend's stay and
S0041	no it's just no
S0086	and that's cos we're live on top of each other you know there's a lot of people in a house that be only really design for three so it's hard
S0041	yeah it drive me frigging nut
S0086	i'm not particularly careful like when 's round now not the he ever really stay the night but bertie beg your pardon just think i don't really i worry about his noise level
S0041	i never hear him never hear him
S0086	really
S0041	never have once hear him at all
S0086	that's good i usually do tell him off in the mornings if he be here because he doesn't have an inside voice but i notice that doesn't either cos when we get back from
S0041	doesn't
S0086	it's weird when we get back form last wednesday she be just talk like at this volume but it be one o'clock in the morning and everybody else obviously to talk quietly but no there be none of that so i be talk really like and show would just be carry on as if she must have think like why be you whisper or like she go to the toilet and she doesn't turn the handle so she slam the door behind her and then slam it again when she come out and leave the light on she do it all the time she always leave the light on i'm like em you've get to go in and turn the light on when you go in there we obviously always keep the light off it's just really the sort of thing that i can imagine her mum be really a stickler for stuff like that and i can see why her mum would get why they would get on each other's nerve cos the be polar opposites but then i guess because be really relax about stuff like that like it doesn't faze her she's just not bother about it which be fine but for people who be a bite worry about you know either save electricity or
S0041	save the planet
S0086	save the planet you know just i think that sort of pass her by and it's hard because she's so scatter like with her mum last wednesday her mum be like have you get the ticket now be you sure you've get the ticket have you pack the ticket cos be really scatter she's like yeah mum fuck's sake i'm not a teenager it be the sort of thing she would do be get to mine of get to norwich and realise she hasn't pack them
S0041	she hasn't get them yeah
S0086	so she do check like ten time though in her handbag and she actually make me check can you just check my handbag i've get the ticket i haven't them yeah no they're definitely there but it must be really infuriate for your mum not to trust you for your mum to treat you like a child because you be a bite scatty i think now she's so use to her own space it's the first time she's be live at home since she be what twenty one so it be go to em it be go to take its toll even though my budget's shit i really want to go wild this weekend
S0041	yep i definitely do
S0086	i feel like we're overdue
S0041	i feel like i'm i'm contain the crazy
S0086	yeah i'm on the edge i think that's the problem with today i really feel like i need to have a big blow out
S0041	yeah
S0086	and usually what happen when i feel like that be i get absolutely plaster by about eight thirty i've pass out in my own bed so so i be quite a cheap night out em but i guess your birthday's not so far away what be it the week after next two weeks this saturday like your birthday be two weeks today your birthday's two week today
S0041	oh no god twenty two again

S0041	she eh cos last night i get out of the bath and i didn't realise it be like quarter past ten when i get out of the bathroom maybe a bite earlier than that maybe it be quarter to ten i don't remember it be late anyway later than i think it be
S0086	yeah
S0041	and i be like oh shit i be glad i get in the bath and not a shower run for all that time
S0086	yeah
S0041	so i come downstairs sort my wash out em pin my hair up get my jamas on cover myself in moisturizer get into bed and then the shower go on forty five minutes after i'd be out the bathroom
S0086	no way
S0041	yeah so i'm try to get to sleep eleven o'clock at night half past eleven and she's run the fuck shower i be like oh my god
S0086	there's no need for that
S0041	it's not like she'd not be in and both of then get in so i don't know if it be hit on her or her on her
S0086	her on her maybe maybe that's what's occur they be pretty close
S0041	yeah i be like time people time
S0086	i think they a different idea of time don't they

S0086	yeah you've just get it's just who if you've get people in the house even if you have people there who be go who be you know it be still on british time on a different time to you you just have to be respectful and it's there's just none of that there's none of that courtesy
S0041	i can only say like stereotypical english people be very courteous but get the bathroom when people have get to be up for world at half past eleven at night be fuck ridiculous
S0086	yeah cos i often feel like at six thirty or whatever that i'm really take the piss if i have to have a shower in the morning cos i haven't can't be bother to have one at night but then at the same time they're up at four thirty in the morning so you can't really you can't really use that an you know you start to feel guilty
S0041	yeah like when i hear the shower go off at that time in the morning i just get on with it i'm like okay well people have to get up for work people don't have to get in the shower at half past eleven at night
S0086	no absolutely but the thing be the latest they come home in nine o'clock so it's not like they can't get straight in to the shower oh sorry love yeah that's my soup
