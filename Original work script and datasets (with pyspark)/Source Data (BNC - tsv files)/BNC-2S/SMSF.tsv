S0018	soup
S0170	right
S0018	parmesan and this be er garlic and herb er something
S0018	let me see oh it's call a garlic and herb roul√©
S0170	ah
S0018	soft cheese it's like boursin but cheaper
S0170	ah do you miss um like the cheese and that from france
S0018	no not really i never really get into eat load of cheese in france um but i miss the vegetables from spain cos oo sorry okay here you be um if you go to like if you go to the market
S0170	mhm
S0018	you could buy a trolley full of fresh fruit and vegetables straight from the orchard
S0170	mm
S0018	for about ten euros and that would sort you out all for all the week um and obviously here most of i don't there there just aren't any market they you've get the the bullring market in but
S0170	mm
S0018	i just don't like it it's so unappetizing it's a bite smelly um
S0170	the one the indoor one
S0018	yeah
S0170	yeah
S0018	so
S0170	for the meats and that it's not great
S0018	do you shop there
S0170	yeah well like to because he's cos it's cheap but it's not my favourite place like like you say it's a bite grimey
S0018	yeah so i buy most of my vegetables from supermarkets which i don't like do cos i know it's not ethical like if ever there's an offer on it's not the the supermarket that take the hit of the price
S0170	mm
S0018	it's the
S0170	the farmers
S0018	the producers yeah
S0170	well that's why in my family there use to be about eight farm and now we we the last one be sell about last year and it's because of supermarkets because they be all smallholdings they weren't large farm
S0018	hm
S0170	and they just couldn't keep up with the price that people be ask for meat and things like that
S0018	yeah
S0170	it be ridiculous
S0018	it's such a shame isn't it
S0170	mm so many smallholding farm have close because of that and they be pretty much organic cos that be the way things be do
S0018	mm
S0170	before
S0018	be you sure that's warm enough
S0170	the soup yeah
S0018	yeah
S0170	it be for me yeah
S0018	yeah
S0170	mhm
S0018	okay good it's not very pip i can't see any pip hotness come off it
S0018	yeah no in an ideal world i'd grow stuff in the garden
S0170	mm
S0018	obviously in spain that be easier cos it be fantastic weather and condition for
S0170	mm
S0018	they put
S0170	they don't have house that have garden though do they
S0018	mm in granada there weren't so many garden
S0170	mm
S0018	unless you live in the outskirts well here in moseley they've get fantastic initiative um for allotments
S0170	oh yeah my my dad have an allotment
S0018	and i've hear in in like dodgy areas of birmingham as well they've get er there's some charity that that um organize allotments for the neighbour and get them together to work together and apparently it's stop a lot of social strife
S0170	really
S0018	problems with gang relate issue and things i guess a a lot of people in those circumstances you know they're not work cos they can't find work you know they're very territorial any kind of territorial problems be just gonna come out with violence but if they're all work together
S0170	mm
S0018	they've get an objective and that objective provide them all food
S0170	yeah
S0018	it's it encourage a lot more collaboration and cooperation and
S0170	oh that's a good idea
S0018	my grandad use to have an allotment
S0170	my dad do i think to be honest we can say you can take the boy out of the country
S0170	out of the countryside but you can't take the countryside out of the boy
S0170	my dad his job now be he retire from office work and he's garden as a sideline
S0018	cool
S0170	just um a couple of garden a week to top up his pension
S0018	mhm
S0170	and to be honest i don't think he'll ever give it up even if he think i'm not make enough money
S0018	well it's nice to work with things when you can make them grow and
S0170	mm
S0018	especially if you can eat them after
S0170	and he have his allotment well he have an allotment then he stop it cos he say that nothing would grow it be one in and he say nothing would grow there even though he make his own um manure compost
S0018	uh huh
S0170	and um still say there wasn't that much luck and now he's move to another part of west brom er he's get a really good one

S0170	it's no it's not a relax sort of thing
S0018	well there's just so much to organize isn't there
S0170	mm oops

S0170	the salad
S0018	mm and the soup
S0170	parmesan's lovely
S0018	so when he grow his beetroot
S0170	mhm
S0018	because the beetroot that you get in can i guess that's all be treat and prepare no so how do how do he eat his beetroot or how do he prepare it
S0170	er you can just have it boil it or um mihal want me to make polish soup which be make of beetroot
S0018	oh oh be that
S0170	borscht
S0018	be that like borscht
S0170	mhm
S0018	oh
S0170	red borscht they have white borscht and red borscht i don't know what's in the white one to be honest there's some there be some lovely polish soup but everything's quite fatty
S0018	mhm
S0170	you know like use especially the winter food in poland
S0018	be it all the dodgy part of the animal like pig trotters and
S0170	there's one soup oh what's that one call i've forget what that's call and that be yeah it's like the furry er they have in spain though the same thing though the furry bite of the intestine
S0018	urgh
S0170	do you know what i mean
S0018	no i didn't know there be a hairy bite in the intestine urgh
S0170	well it look like hairy bite
S0170	it's get like um all little tentacle thingies
S0018	oh lordy
S0170	yep and it's that
S0018	stomach soup yum yum
S0170	mm mihal love it but he say anyone when they're cook it in the house it stink
S0018	really
S0170	mm
S0018	how far how far down the intestine do they go to find it
S0170	i don't know if it's the it's actually like the intestine cos it's like like in square and one side be like shiny kind of thing and the other side's like that and i think from what i remember of biology class that's the intestine
S0018	uh huh
S0170	i'm guess
S0018	but i imagine that the stuff that already pass through that part of the intestine
S0170	mhm
S0018	be no longer food
S0018	that's probably why it stink
S0170	just let's not think about this
S0018	it stink the house out yeah maybe not not a good idea
S0170	i have eat it
S0018	not a lunch conversation topic
S0170	someone's go get tire aren't you
S0018	be he sleepy
S0170	he's sleepy but he's fight it
S0018	aw it's cos he want to be in on the social event
S0170	mm
S0018	be the sun bother you
S0170	me no
S0018	no
S0170	no no nice to get some
S0018	i know i be just go to say
S0170	i'm i'm such a messy eater
S0018	don't you worry no it's be sunny both days that i've see you now
S0170	oh yeah
S0018	maybe i'll um arrange to meet you every day
S0018	just so the sun come out
S0170	and have some sun
S0170	mm today's lovely
S0018	it's amaze the only problem with this glass roof be that it be freeze in here when the sun's not shin
S0170	hm
S0018	and
S0170	yeah i can imagine that the heat would go straight out wouldn't it
S0018	i think it's a great idea to have a glass roof on a kitchen but if you have a glass roof on a kitchen you should at least double glaze it
S0170	it's not mm
S0018	no i think it's just single glaze
S0170	it's get plant come in
S0018	it's get what sorry
S0170	plant come in that maybe have grow from the bush on the side they're come in the top see
S0018	oh yeah
S0018	i could grow some salad up there
S0170	could grow load in here
S0018	could be a greenhouse yeah well that's what a greenhouse be
S0170	mhm
S0018	isn't it
S0170	be ideal any plant should do really well
S0018	that's not a bad idea
S0170	any plant that don't mind direct sunlight
S0018	hm
S0170	mm go to sleep go to sleep
S0018	be he go to sleep aw
S0170	this be good because i'm try to get out of the habit of breastfeed to sleep because it's gonna be a problem if i'm not there
S0018	bless you
S0170	bless you but they say like if i'm not there and there's a book the book say if you're not there they're adaptable and they'll find a way to sleep but it's like as if they almost need to be teach
S0018	mm
S0170	how to fall asleep
S0018	mm
S0170	or help over that kind of that i dunno threshold to sleep or something
S0018	mm
S0170	cos they just seem so reluctant sometimes to go to sleep
S0170	and the cry out method that say
S0018	what's that
S0170	just like leave them to cry so they cry them they tire themselves out and go to sleep cos they realize you're not come but then there be other people who say well that's not good because then they'll think you're never gonna come or they'll think of sleep as not a nice thing
S0018	mm yeah my friend's still have awful problems with her eighteen month year old eighteen month year old i say that last time didn't i
S0018	eighteen month old daughter and she's try she try to leave her
S0170	mm
S0018	um or at at least just go in and say there there it's okay and go back to sleep but then she just if she doesn't come
S0170	mhm
S0018	if she doesn't go back she just er stand up in her cot
S0170	mhm
S0018	and scream and scream and scream until she until she vomit which must be so traumatic
S0170	yeah that's why i'm i'm reluctant to do it i've try one time and he do the same he be so upset he vomit and
S0018	aw
S0170	i haven't do it since because i can't i can't know that i've cause him to be sick and it's just awful
S0018	well she say all the book say leave them they'll get use to it but she say you can't you know you can't you're the one who know your child best
S0170	yeah
S0018	you can't always do what a book say because
S0170	it doesn't work for every child as well every child
S0018	yeah
S0170	be different we're all different so but there's so many people in the same position that they don't want to do the cry out
S0018	hm
S0170	cos they say it affect their if you try it too young it affect their um confidence
S0018	aw
S0170	and be like um cos there's er the people who think wear your baby and then other people think like try to separate from the baby so the people say like for for wear baby so try to be with the baby as much as possible in the begin will make them more independent in the future because they're secure and they know you're there that when it's time they'll just go
S0018	that's interest i guess it's all yeah a lot depend on the personality of the individual baby but then again when they're so little their personalities haven't emerge
S0170	mm
S0018	it's difficult to know what they're gonna be like
S0170	yeah and it make me cry the one article i read about it cos they're say well then they're not the now they make signal cos they're try to tell you something like hungry be
S0018	mm
S0170	the hand in the mouth or tire be rub the ear
S0018	really
S0170	rub the eye
S0018	aw
S0170	depend on again baby that if you don't answer signal they will stop make it and they turn inwards
S0018	mm
S0170	and they'll be less communicative and
S0018	oh right
S0170	it's so many people say different things
S0018	yeah
S0170	it's really hard
S0018	it must be worry like when there's no little instruction manual that come with your baby but i mean you spend pretty much all your wake hours with him don't you so
S0170	yeah
S0018	you must be able to interpret his signal better than any expert could
S0170	mm i suppose breastfeed allow me to do it without people stick their nose in too much because they leave him and say oh he need feed and i'm the only one that can fee him so i can give him what he want and if anyone be to try and stop me go to him i'd get really angry i think so
S0018	have you ever have any problems out in public breastfeed i know that
S0170	i haven't but my dad say he be with his friend who say to dad to tell the lady to to not fee there and to take the baby into the toilet
S0018	in the toilet
S0170	mm
S0018	how be how do that go down
S0170	no my dad go my dad at first i think he be more to that way of think but have me preach to him about it like i'm not take my baby to the toilet why should i go to the toilet i'll fee him i think i should fee him wherever i want he's convert now
S0018	aw
S0170	so he wasn't very happy that his friend have say that be you not very comfortable in that
S0018	well it be completely natural isn't it i mean i know a lot of place in spain they be have er big problems with women not you know get tell to leave the restaurant and
S0170	really
S0018	yeah
S0170	there be a big thing when i be in granada about um domestic violence violencia de gen√©ro
S0018	mhm
S0170	there be all the advert on television and everything so it's a big problem do you hear about the woman who be on the show she be russian or latvian or something and she have meet a spanish guy and they be marry um she'd leave him because he be violent and then she be ask onto a talkshow didn't realize it be by the ex husband
S0018	huh
S0170	and he follow her after
S0018	oh no
S0170	and kill her in um
S0018	oh my life
S0170	in the entrance to her apartment build
S0018	that what he be also invite on the chatshow but she be there
S0170	he have he have go on there say he want to surprise his lady and and and ask her to marry him to take him back or something and um
S0018	oh dear
S0170	so she'd be bring on not know who be who'd ask her onto the show
S0018	mm
S0170	i'm not breastfeed you
S0018	and so she didn't know that she think that it be about domestic violence or something
S0170	no she think she wasn't sure who have it be like this person want to surprise you so she maybe think it be from someone in her life now
S0018	mm
S0170	must have not cross her mind cos if she have the suspicion that it might be the ex i'd have think she would have tell the show producers like if it's this person i don't want to be surprise by him thank you very much
S0018	well that's the problem with reality tv isn't it you sometimes get a big dose of reality
S0018	ooo ooo look at the colourful things ooo
S0170	ooo what's that what's that
S0018	what be it ooo
S0170	do he try and grab it then
S0018	grab it grab it no i don't wanna grab
S0170	there you go
S0018	then again think about you know when you fall asleep
S0170	mm
S0018	there's this kind of halfway between wake and sleep
S0170	mm
S0018	that actually if you're a baby and you don't know what it be it actually might be quite disorient like quite scary
S0170	mm
S0018	to
S0170	yeah
S0018	i mean
S0170	to feel on your own and your your that's happen it might be like help me mum help me
S0170	and i do it and then there be a thing like if he's fall asleep on me then when i put him down and he wake up it's like huh argh where be i
S0018	aw
S0170	especially if it's somewhere different that he's not use to be
S0018	mm
S0170	like if he wake up in his cot it's like okay i know this place
S0170	but if he wake up in the dark cos he'll have fall asleep in the light and i'll put him in the room turn off the light and then he's wake up in the dark
S0018	aw
S0170	that could must be quite scary
S0018	what be their memories their short term memory like memories like at this age so if he fall asleep in the while it's day
S0170	mm
S0018	and he wake up when it's night will he remember that when he fell asleep it be daylight
S0170	yeah i think so yeah
S0018	mm
S0170	i think their short term memory's quite good and they're get to remember people and stuff like i can see his different reactions to say my dad he's a lot you know he's very smiley with him he like he's okay with him and then when new people who he doesn't know he can be very quiet and
S0018	aw
S0170	and shy
S0018	how often do your dad see him where do your dad live
S0018	ah not too far away then
S0170	no but he's um cos he's semi retire he'll never retire my dad
S0170	he's apart from his garden i could watch not to grab knives and fork and stuff
S0170	i forget i'm so use to him be there and not do anything
S0170	that you can grab them now um and when be on nights cos stop nights he say i can't do nights um he'd come over every day cos i be find that quite hard cos he'd be sleep in the day and out work in the night i be just get him twenty four seven
S0018	very tough
S0170	and it be two weeks after come home and i be just stress
S0018	aw aw so your dad come over
S0170	yeah he come over every day and cook for me
S0018	aw
S0170	he's a very sweet man
S0018	and where do your sister live
S0018	ah do you get to see her quite frequently
S0170	after they make redundant
S0018	oh gosh yeah how's she
S0170	i've see her quite frequently
S0018	how's she get on
S0170	okay yeah she's she's go on a ski holiday
S0018	oh good good on her
S0170	well she have a bite of a payout plus she be make redundant so she'd be there for four years
S0018	that's a very good plan recharge her batteries ready for the horrendous job search
S0170	mm
S0018	urgh it really suck your soul out jobhunting and
S0170	it do interview
S0018	urgh
S0170	i've be really lucky with interview i've not have many formal proper interview to be honest the last few job i've have it's be very casual and they've be desperate so it's like when can you start i remember at the college where i work in the even they just they be desperate for an even tutor cos none of the daytime want to do it i go in and it's like oh there's this class you you can you do tomorrow's class and i'm like okay
