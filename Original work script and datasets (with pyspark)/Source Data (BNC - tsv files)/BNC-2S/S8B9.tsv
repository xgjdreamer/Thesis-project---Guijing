S0453	it be a bite hot yeah it's hot out there
S0454	yeah it doesn't bother me but
S0453	mm i mean it doesn't bother me either er actually ac
S0454	it's quite high now
S0453	ac in my room's too cold so i just put put it switch it off
S0454	yeah
S0453	it's too erm it's too too cold otherwise
S0454	mm
S0453	it's perfectly fine because the place be so ac you know invest in it it just stay er manageable anyway erm be you so can before we do this er be be you okay
S0454	no i'm angry with you
S0453	i know yeah
S0454	after yesterday i'm upset but maybe that be a good thing for write the list
S0453	yeah i think that
S0454	it be er i haven't hold back
S0453	yeah well that's good well i i'm gonna take a slightly different approach but i'll explain it to you cos er it might not surprise you to discover that i have another shift of direction from the list when i be think about it last night erm you you be eat okay and like everything's okay
S0454	just get on with it
S0453	okay okay well basically erm when i be put it together i i think why be i do this you know why be i this it's a bite it's a bite like a character assassination
S0454	yeah it be
S0453	yeah
S0454	i wonder what you be up to
S0453	yeah so i would rather not do that
S0454	okay good
S0453	okay but but it be
S0454	you've already do it now though
S0453	yeah i know i've do it for myself but so i'm i'm not go to go through the items but i what i'll i what matter be the the end result really and what it cos what it's
S0454	it sound like you just want an excuse
S0453	no i don't want
S0454	to end things
S0453	no i don't want an excuse to end things can i just finish
S0454	in which case
S0453	let me finish one second
S0454	this be pointless
S0453	no hang on one second i where it be helpful be in organise my own thoughts and just get to the bottom of how i feel which be obviously a problem for me erm because on saturday i be you know blow one way and then yesterday i blow another way but it it's true i've i'm not you know i've not erm be really in touch with how i felt and i've be poor at articulate it erm but what this what this lead me to the you know the items there what i find i be do be i be kind of you know i find that be prioritise stuff that involve us do things apart and things that and you say it yourself when you move here that you felt like you be in a relationship with someone who who want to continue live their single life
S0454	exactly
S0453	you know and and doesn't doesn't want to compromise and
S0454	yeah
S0453	there's probably and there's
S0454	like that first week i be here that be really obvious when i wasn't at work
S0453	yeah
S0454	and you didn't want to move your schedule even for one week
S0453	yeah
S0454	with your gym and football and this and that
S0453	or compromise yeah
S0454	you know it be really kind of like obvious you didn't really want me as part of your life you just want to
S0453	do my thing
S0454	do your thing in which case why do i move here we could have just
S0453	yeah
S0454	carry on what we be do before or just end it
S0453	yeah well i so what this have lead me to conclude now i'm tell you the two options because i genuinely don't know which one of them apply be either i've be alone so long
S0454	mm this be part of the problem
S0454	that unfortunately you get stick in your ways
S0453	yeah i've be alone so long and i've be not involve in a relationship for so long erm that i can't really do it and i all i know be and and it's make me selfish in a way
S0454	mm
S0453	because it's make me less
S0454	i put that
S0453	yeah cognisant of other people's want and desire
S0454	i put that too
S0453	erm but by the way you know no matter what you think and no matter not withstand that conversation yesterday i do love and i do care about you and the reason this be difficult for me as well as you be because of the upset that i'm cause you and the reason that i felt like shit for two weeks this be what i want to make clear be because i've make you you feel like shit and i know it and my endure memory be just see you really upset that be the last time i saw you that be the until until saturday even
S0454	mm
S0453	so that's that and so the reason i felt buoy at the start of yesterday when i when i go to work and i have lot of energy be because i be this be what i think be go on in my head be i be reassure that you're okay and i think thank god she seem alright that's what
S0454	mm
S0453	that's the what i think the a big part of the relief be
S0454	i'm always alright
S0453	i know you're resilient i know you're resilient but i also know that you're very you know er more than you'd like to admit you have get feel and emotions and
S0454	mm but i'm much stronger than other people i've realise a lot stronger
S0453	oh without doubt you're probably much stronger than me so
S0454	i be
S0453	yeah well anyway that go back to the options one option be that i've be alone so long that i've be i'm just i just can't hack live with someone and can't hack compromise and basically find that
S0454	not that you can't hack it it's you're not prepare to try it's this black or white there's nothing in between for you like it's gotta be like your ideal little world
S0453	mm
S0454	perfect relationship which of course doesn't exist for anybody anywhere beyond a couple of days
S0453	mm
S0454	or there's nothing there's no in between stage and also that you can't see that things be temporal that you can go through really really good time with someone
S0453	yeah
S0454	and then you can go downhill because something's happen
S0453	mm
S0454	maybe not even outside maybe just complacency make people lazy and then it can pick up again and that's
S0453	yeah
S0454	normal in a relationship it's not like a straight line a relationship
S0453	i know that
S0454	it's not even just you start really high and then you go downhill and then you plateau it's not like that if you draw a graph of it it's much more variable
S0453	mm i know well that bring me then to the second item which be when i be put together the list i wonder whether because i'm prioritise stuff that really involve time apart
S0454	mm
S0453	in one way or another in this list whether it might be specific to me to to me and you an incompatibility between us underneath that we've both really gloss over on the way because of the way we be
S0454	so you're prioritise you need to spend more time alone
S0453	well the one of it's alone one of it's some of it's with friends some of it's you know meet new people and do stuff
S0454	but this i've already tell you so many time
S0453	yeah i know
S0454	like cos i can see you're not make any effort
S0453	i know
S0454	you haven't make any effort to make new friends in this whole year
S0453	mm
S0454	you've meet no one
S0453	mm
S0454	and you haven't try
S0453	that's true
S0454	and i've ask you over and over again so many time make sure you put aside a day a week at least to see friends and make friends but you don't you put aside time to go to the gym alone
S0453	mm
S0454	for several hours you put aside time to go to football that's not a social event that's a sport event that involve no talk essentially other than pass the ball oh you dickhead
S0453	yeah
S0454	that's a that's not a social activity so that's three nights a week go
S0453	yeah
S0454	and then
S0453	i know but that's
S0454	we spend an even or two together
S0453	yeah
S0454	and then usually we see one of your friends you know which have sometimes become mutual friends now and and whatever
S0453	mm
S0454	six but that that other night
S0453	yeah i know
S0454	you you didn't make an effort any effort in a year i can't believe it and you say you're really sociable
S0453	you're right
S0454	but yet you've even when i've ask you you need to do this
S0453	yeah i know
S0454	and it's abnormal you don't know very many people here
S0453	i think the reason be probably deep down that i don't really feel a connection with
S0454	but this be a
S0453	i know
S0454	counterproductive thing
S0453	it's exactly
S0454	because you don't make
S0453	it's it's chicken and egg exactly
S0454	friends and you don't they don't invite you place
S0453	people i don't feel happier
S0454	and then you don't
S0453	absolutely
S0454	have new experience
S0453	you're absolutely right
S0454	then it just become like work
S0453	a vicious cycle
S0454	gym
S0453	yeah
S0454	home
S0453	and also part of it
S0454	maybe see and sometimes but it's just bore it's just
S0453	yeah and it's
S0454	you're not do anything new
S0453	no
S0454	even though they're nice people it's not that
S0453	no
S0454	they're lovely it's just
S0453	it's meet new people it's make the connections
S0454	you know them and
S0453	yeah and they
S0454	yeah
S0453	live in anyway
S0454	and they live in
S0454	and you can't see them every week
S0453	yeah no i can't well the other thing be erm the other thing be i think it's maybe with half an eye on move back home
S0454	yeah
S0453	and see this place as a temporary thing
S0454	yeah i think i felt that too here
S0453	i mm
S0454	that i haven't make a make a lot of effort in to make friends cos it be really excite and it be new and there be all these place i want to go and see and it wasn't the kind of thing you can do on your own like go to mountains or camp you just can't do those things on your own so i make a lot of effort and of course i meet people who you know eventually be similarly mind to me
S0453	mm
S0454	so like travel in the gulf and
S0453	yeah
S0454	in the middle east that be great that he like the stuff then i have people like who you know like slum it a bite and
S0453	yeah
S0454	but be really up for an adventure just get in a car and literally go leave or right until we hit the end leave or right until
S0453	mm
S0454	we'd find somewhere completely new and off the beat track but it be because i make the effort to meet enough people
S0453	to have that
S0454	that i run into people who
S0453	you like
S0454	i get on with and
S0453	yeah
S0454	they be fun and we have a lot of fun together whereas here i know my i be kind of think six months a year but that's not really excuse like
S0453	no it's not
S0454	i have really good fun the other night
S0453	you've get to enjoy yourself yeah
S0454	because i be just out meet new people and it be a nice environment beautiful place they're nice people
S0453	yeah
S0454	and i could just do that more it doesn't matter if there's any future in the friendship or not that's kind of irrelevant it doesn't even matter if we meet them again
S0453	no of course
S0454	just
S0453	just get
S0454	a bite of fun
S0453	have a chat yeah of course that's how i feel
S0454	and it be nice to have a drink and relax
S0453	that's i i enjoy it
S0454	yeah
S0453	that's i i talk to those korean dudes that be
S0454	mm
S0453	work on the project and we just have a really a really good laugh i be get tipsy very tipsy very quickly
S0454	mm
S0453	and i just keep say things like you're all call and you're all call
S0454	i know you tell me
S0453	yeah so this be this be where i be you know you understandably get frustrate yesterday because on saturday even i say one thing yesterday even i say something completely different and you be think what the fuck do this guy want
S0454	and it's all unilateral again it's like
S0453	i know
S0454	we discuss in the café
S0453	i know
S0454	for quite a long time a couple of hours there be plenty of time for you to say things it's not like we be shout at each other and you couldn't speak
S0453	mm
S0454	and we discuss things and we analyse and we talk about it and we come to you know at the end of two hours we've come to some kind of agreement and then the next day you have actually change the date and bring it forward which i be kind of surprise about cos i think we'd agree tuesday not that
S0453	yeah
S0454	it matter it's your flat i mean of course
S0453	i i think i
S0454	you're welcome any time
S0453	i work out the date wrong cos i don't different thing
S0454	so
S0454	and then the next day you be say something completely different without discuss anything again
S0453	oh well i i'd think about it in myself and i and i be fully intend to discuss it
S0454	but this be what i'm say
S0453	but i be fully intend to discuss it with you it's not like i be gonna announce it suddenly the reason the only reason i tell i didn't wanna say anything when i about it the only reason i say be cos you say about the cleaner
S0454	no you say about the cleaner in the morning
S0453	i know i i say because i didn't want you i i be at that point have second thoughts and what i didn't want you to do cos i just have visions of this in my head be you go round the flat and clean stuff and make it look nice and stuff and you know and it that make me feel really guilty because
S0454	but you be the one in the morning say oh i sleep really well i have a great night's sleep
S0453	because i do i do
S0454	oh i might bring forward my my time home a day earlier i hope that's okay
S0453	yeah that's how i start the day now i can explain all of that the sleep i do sleep better and er like be say it be because i be reassure that you be okay that that be the big reason why i felt like shit because i know that the impact that i have on your emotions not not not mm mm you know not out of spite but because of what i'd decide be be in our in in both of our interest even though you know obviously it be unilateral and in in your view we didn't discuss it we you
S0454	what do you mean in my view we didn't discuss it we didn't discuss it
S0453	no we didn't discuss it okay we didn't discuss it
S0454	it's not my view
S0453	no i know i mean no but you
S0454	that that's just a statement of fact
S0453	okay fine we didn't discuss it erm other than you know the breakup conversation
S0454	well that wasn't really a conversation that be you inform me
S0453	well and i inform you and then you er you say you say something the next day on this on er not the next day on saturday morning when we be you know you you talk
S0454	it be already announce
S0453	i know it be announce
S0454	there be no conversation about break up
S0453	i know but i know er
S0454	we break up and then there be fallout
S0453	i know
S0454	there be no discussion
S0453	let
S0454	at any point
S0453	let me just explain the good night's sleep be because when i saw you on saturday even that help remove a lot of guilt from me because it make me realise that you be alright and
S0454	mm
S0453	your life be go on
S0454	yeah of course
S0453	yeah so that that be where that come from and honestly i think that's the the big part of the reason why i felt like shit the the other thing when i say i might bring my be a combination of factor a because earlier in the day i be buoy and that cloud my judgement about the the fact that my guilt have go that be the real reason that i felt better it be because i felt less guilty but it wasn't because you know i be desperate to get back in here which be what the reason should be that's the reason i should be that's the reason i should
S0454	desperate no why would you
S0453	no no
S0454	feel desperate
S0453	not not desperate
S0454	this be an odd word
S0453	no not desperate not not desperate but because
S0454	you shouldn't feel desperate
S0453	mm not desperate but i should feel that i miss be here with you right that's how i should
S0454	don't you think it's go to if we move back in together it would be difficult for a while and it's natural that we all feel apprehensive when we knowingly walk into a difficult situation and set ourselves up for that whereas avoid stuff
S0453	i know
S0454	like you're do
S0453	yeah i i
S0454	be obviously easier even though we feel guilty about it so maybe in the long run the effect be the same you can't get away from these negative feel if you have any kind of conscience
S0453	i i agree and i agree
S0454	so it's not so much that you should feel desperate
S0453	no
S0454	to get back here or even excite as you say on the phone no why would you feel excite about
S0453	no i
S0454	walk into a difficult situation
S0453	but your your heart need to be in it and my heart
S0454	well yours obviously isn't because you just say then
S0453	no
S0454	i need to pay for oh so you've
S0453	yeah
S0454	yet again
S0453	i yeah
S0454	decide
S0453	yeah
S0454	before the conversation even though even last night you be say
S0453	i haven't
S0454	i haven't decide
S0453	no
S0454	i need to talk them through you've already decide
S0453	no i have yeah i have and and
S0454	so
S0453	let me explain so let me explain why
S0454	again this be pointless
S0453	hang on no let me explain what i've
S0454	really it's a waste of time
S0453	no one second can i just talk
S0454	yeah you certainly be
S0453	because because er you know for a relationship to continue it take two to tango
S0454	yeah and you clearly don't want to
S0453	mm not at the moment no
S0454	there's no at the moment i tell you i'm
S0453	okay
S0454	not wait forever
S0453	fine
S0454	for you
S0453	no not forever i i'm not ask for forever
S0454	not and er yesterday you be like oh we could wait for the summer
S0453	no yeah well that's
S0454	come on don't keep
S0453	that's that's the i
S0454	don't be ridiculous
S0453	okay well er
S0454	you expect me to put my life on hold for months for you because you can't make up your mind
S0453	okay well
S0454	you've have six months to think about it already you say
S0453	yeah and
S0454	and now you're ask for another three
S0453	no that's fine
S0454	sorry
S0453	look if you can't wait that's your
S0454	i'm not go to
S0453	okay well if you
S0454	because you obviously don't care and you're make
S0453	no
S0454	all these decisions on your own anyway
S0454	there's no discussion you've just come in have say this discussion be open end and you haven't decide anything you've now come in and say
S0453	i
S0454	the exact opposite
S0453	i know i'm
S0454	you've just trip yourself up
S0453	no no hang on i mean
S0454	no you do
S0453	believe me
S0454	you just say
S0453	believe me
S0454	oh i need to pay oh i only pay up till tonight and
S0453	yeah i know i have decide
S0454	i need to pay oh
S0453	i have
S0454	but then
S0453	i
S0454	on the phone yesterday you say the exact opposite
S0453	what
S0454	you say this discussion be open end and you need to weigh things up and see and blah blah blah
S0453	yeah i have
S0454	so
S0453	yeah but that happen in relationships sometimes one partner want something that another doesn't
S0454	yeah so you don't want a relationship so why be we have this
S0453	no
S0454	conversation what be the point
S0453	well
S0454	why don't you just
S0453	the the point
S0454	end this conversation
S0453	okay well this be what i be gonna propose because ultimately it what what it boil down to be the way forward
S0454	the way forward be there be no way forward
S0453	okay so
S0454	we've just you've just establish that
S0453	yeah er look
S0454	you don't want to have a relationship
S0454	you want me to wait indefinitely
S0453	the reason
S0454	but actually you've already decide
S0453	no not indefinitely not indefinitely not indefinitely what i be gonna propose be that both of us this be a suggestion okay it's you're entirely it's obviously your prerogative to reject it
S0454	mm
S0453	and to decide that that you don't want it but what i be gonna propose be be either either that when you get back from the uk in august first of all there's no contact between us because
S0454	okay that's weird
S0453	no but it's not weird
S0454	it's very weird
S0453	i need i need but i need think time
S0454	well you're not just gonna have think time you've get the rest of your life
S0453	no but
S0454	just just draw a line there
S0453	okay well it's either it's either that
S0454	there's no it's weird
S0453	what okay well all i'm tell you be i need space i can't make a decision now
S0454	well you can have all the space for the rest of your life that's fine
S0453	okay well er or that we end it now and and if we end it now then we
S0454	end it now
S0453	okay but
S0454	why keep me hang for months you've already decide everything else unilaterally
S0453	well what the the benefit of it be
S0454	for who
S0453	for well for both side
S0454	what you keep me hang
S0454	the benefit of that
S0453	that's one way of look at it but the other benefit of us be apart be that we get the chance to really reflect on what it's like to be without each other and i think
S0454	mm
S0453	i haven't
S0454	i don't need months
S0453	okay
S0454	to know that
S0453	well i haven't have enough time i really haven't because my judgement have be cloud by things like guilt at have that effect on you for two weeks and the reason i don't wanna come back here be that you should take it as i don't want you to take that personally it's not because i don't wanna be you know i don't enjoy be around or i love be around you but the reason be because i know what's gonna happen if i go in this come back this early my judgement's still cloud by all these things under the same
S0454	but don't you think you're you're when you're on your own your mindset be very unhealthy you get into a very odd think pattern a not very healthy think pattern you're actually not very good on your own
S0453	no i
S0454	most people aren't if they're even a little bite
S0453	i i'm
S0454	mentally unstable then it's obviously gonna make them worse be on their own
S0453	i i've be on my own most of my life
S0454	yeah it's not always very healthy though be it
S0453	possibly possibly that's possibly true but that doesn't mean that you you know you you enter into a relationship at any cost and you have to be
S0454	but we're not enter into one we be already in one
S0453	no continue or or continue a relationship at any cost
S0454	it's not at any cost any cost mean you know one of us or both of us financially destitute and we can't get work here one of us be abuse the other
S0453	oh i know
S0454	one of us be
S0453	but those aren't the only reason
S0454	i don't know steal from the other
S0453	no but mm
S0454	or whatever whatever it be those be at any cost those be extreme circumstances where yes i don't think it be worth continue at that point no matter how nice the other person be and how fun there be just no point
S0453	those aren't the only reason a relationship can't continue
S0454	but this be the any cost thing if you're gonna go down
S0453	no
S0454	that any cost route
S0453	okay okay well well well well
S0454	because we're not talk about these big things we're talk about some differences some character flaw
S0453	the
S0454	but no one's perfect and
S0453	no i just
S0454	and some things that can be fix and some things can't and that's what need to be decide be there too many things that can't be fix
S0453	that's my concern
S0454	but we don't know that if we don't try this be what i'm say you're not gonna know it by go away and think about it for six months
S0453	yeah i
S0454	or three months
S0453	well er
S0454	or even two months
S0453	in a way i be in a way i be because in a way that will give me the benefit of hindsight and i'll be able to look back and say how do i feel without in my life
S0454	well it won't matter how you feel because i won't be there any more
S0453	okay well then then i you know the the this be what i'm i'm say there's
S0454	you're string me along
S0453	okay well i don't want to
S0454	okay well
S0453	okay well
S0454	proposal over
S0453	because i at the moment i can't see a future with between us i can't
S0454	well then there's no point
S0453	and the reason the reason why i don't know i don't know if it's the selfish me be alone all my life not be able to adjust to a a long term commit relationship or whether it be that i recognise now that i've have now that i mean the only that be the the benefit of the list exercise be at least be able to get my head round things without be cloud by the fact that i love you and or by the fact that i enjoy spend time with you and actually look at things a bite more objectively and what i've that exercise have result in be i feel like there be some fundamental incompatibilities between us that aren't in the top five ten percent but they're in the bigger category than that that that's not in the realm of stuff that can be work on that's how i feel about it
S0454	this be what i mean you're just say these things without try to fix them that's how you've be approach this whole issue you've just be like oh there be some problems i'm gonna run away and stay in a different place okay i'm just gonna talk about the problem but i'm not gonna do anything about it
S0453	i
S0454	this this to me be like it's like research
S0453	mm
S0454	but you only ever have a hypothesis what do that prove
S0453	i
S0454	nothing
S0453	i agree
S0454	would you do scientific research like that
S0453	i
S0454	oh i've get this great idea for a drug it's a great idea well what do you do next
S0453	i know but
S0454	you test it
S0453	i know
S0454	then you refine it
S0453	i know
S0454	then you test it again and then you refine it this be scientific inquiry and then you might find at the end you know what this drug quite clearly doesn't work or it doesn't work well enough to make onto the market it's not different
S0453	yeah
S0454	you've get a hypothesis
S0453	yeah i i i know i just i look i
S0454	but there's no you're not problem solve with it
S0453	let me let me just say first of all that i agree with you that i shy away from the difficult emotional issue like i don't confront them that's not really be build into me because my parent be not
S0454	so what be you gonna do just repeat that all your life
S0453	no i'm
S0454	where's that gonna get you
S0453	okay that's fine er don't be a victim you're right
S0454	mm
S0453	okay secondly i have a real fear and i'm just gonna tell you what that fear be that if i move back here now even if it's to er to adopt this really sensible idea of try to give things a go for a month i worry that the same concern that lead me to end the relationship will resurface very quickly and i'll feel like that i've make a mistake and i'll feel like whatever chance this relationship have of end on amicable term will be throw
S0454	doesn't matter
S0453	in the sea
S0453	it do to me because maybe you don't care about be okay well i
S0454	not really
S0453	okay well i well that's your right to to that's your right
S0454	i don't think you've treat me very well so why should i what would i want to be friends with you for
S0453	and i can
S0454	just to remind me of that
S0453	and and and and in my and i i'm gonna acknowledge that in my plan to minimise hurt and sugar coat everything in a bid to hurt you less what's wind up happen
S0454	but be it be that only about hurt me less or be it really about you not want to have a difficult conversation
S0453	no it be
S0454	to have a chance to reply
S0453	no i be always i be always go to
S0454	to
S0453	i be always gonna
S0454	to see that you'd upset me
S0453	well
S0454	be it really about that
S0453	well it could be well it could be
S0454	you say it be about me but i can't help wonder be it really about you
S0453	whether it be about me yeah but
S0454	it be just you be selfish again
S0453	it could well be and and and now i recognise that rather than think rather than think oh you know her mum's just be i can't possibly end it now erm what i need to do be air those concern at the time
S0454	yeah
S0453	rather than
S0454	can you not see how much worse it be
S0453	i know
S0454	that you've string me along for six months
S0453	i know i know
S0454	and you tell all your friends about it and then you tell me last how humiliate that be
S0453	how how do you know i tell all my friends about it
S0454	because you tell me you do
S0453	yeah
S0454	how humiliate that be
S0453	yeah i know
S0454	how hurtful that be
S0453	yeah i know
S0454	and you say you do it to hurt me less it doesn't feel like that
S0453	and it have the complete opposite result
S0454	it doesn't feel like that at all do you think it's better to break up with me now be this a better time my sister's still get cancer it's gonna get worse not better i
S0453	i know
S0454	i need surgery now i'll be on my own
S0453	yeah i know
S0454	be it gonna be be it better
S0453	no it's not
S0454	wait six months
S0453	it wasn't better that be that be a lesson
S0454	i could have resign
S0453	a big
S0454	months ago if i'd want to do and now i'll have to do a runner if i'm gonna leave
S0453	that be a big well that place be fuck a six month notice period be fuck
S0454	but i'm still on the three you see until september so i could still resign cos i'm on probation still
S0453	well
S0454	so i've still get that as a get out option it's just it's not a september it should be a july finish it would be easier for me but these things aren't insurmountable
S0453	well i mean it's sound like we've lead to down a certain path you don't want to wait at all i
S0454	i don't want you to string me along any further
S0453	okay
S0454	i think you've string me along enough
S0453	mm
S0454	don't you
S0453	well that's probably right
S0454	you can't keep do this
S0453	no
S0454	and mess me around
S0453	i'm sorry
S0454	and it's hot cold hot cold it's not fair so
S0453	no it's not fair
S0454	that's that and i'm not sure i could ever trust you again anyway give how you've behave yesterday be the last straw you give people chance
S0453	i i didn't do that
S0454	you talk about open and honest
S0453	it's it wasn't out of malice i wasn't
S0454	you say all the right things
S0453	yeah
S0454	and then you do the exact opposite the next day
S0453	but it wasn't
S0454	without discuss things further you just repeat the same thing
S0453	no but
S0454	the same behaviour
S0453	but it wasn't malice it be because i didn't i genuinely i tell you my judgement be cloud i didn't i wasn't in touch with how i felt
S0454	and then you blame me i pressure you into it i force you that wasn't even true that be just an outright lie
S0453	yeah i felt i felt pressure it wasn't it wasn't fair to say that you pressure me and put blame on you but it but it be fair to say how i felt i felt like i be in a corner and not really able to just to choose
S0454	no you ask me

S0454	you ask
S0453	at the time
S0454	and then you be give
S0453	but at the time i be in the euphoria of first of all see you and secondly in the euphoria of see that you be okay because that's a big part of why i've not i've have sleepless nights for over two weeks because i feel like a a perpetrator of crime that's how i feel because of the effect that i've have on you even though i know i've not intend to hurt you but i have
S0454	of course you have

S0454	where's my money come from
S0453	what do i need to do for myself
S0454	how be i gonna pay the bill next week and that actually would have shake her out of it earlier on it might be too late now
S0453	yeah you're right
S0454	i mean she's be do it for fifteen years
S0453	and she's
S0454	never
S0453	thirty one
S0454	she's thirty one there isn't a whole lot of hope for her i wouldn't say it's impossible
S0453	no you're right
S0454	but while she's under the really
S0453	the yeah
S0454	oh while she's under this environment of you know this unhealthy environment she's live in with your parent there's not much chance of her break free and she'd have to be very strong and motivate to want to break free
S0453	yeah
S0454	and you're create it too
S0453	you're right
S0454	you pay all the bill and do everything

S0454	it's not like i'm plan on stay in contact with you anyway can i read it myself
S0453	no no because it doesn't make er it's do in like cos i've add to it as i've go along as things have occur to me okay in a strange way so first of all the first override theme be let go on both side that's what what i felt
S0454	mm
S0453	we both need to work on be we both
S0454	of each other
S0453	yes because we're both
S0454	mm
S0453	even though we might not like to admit it we're both a bite clingy about each other
S0454	mm
S0453	so i be in dominate everything and be really jealous and possessive and when you and do and stuff you know want to know where you be all the time which probably feel quite oppressive to you
S0454	mm
S0453	and i feel that you be with me examples texts if i'm texting a friend
S0454	mm
S0453	you're always like who be you texting you always ask me this question
S0454	yeah cos you do it when we're in bed together
S0453	yeah i no i know but that's
S0454	and that's kind of rude
S0453	well when be i gonna do it you know what be i gonna do get out of bed and do it
S0454	yeah but sometimes you do it inappropriate time like we'll just have sex and then you'll start texting someone right after i mean it's kind of rude
S0453	okay
S0454	so i be gonna ask you who be you texting
S0453	all i know be i've felt a little bite constrain by
S0454	but don't you think that's a normal thing to ask
S0453	i've just felt a bite er constrain
S0454	but don't you think that's a normal question to ask
S0453	it can be but but we trust each other
S0454	but it's not about trust it's just it's a normal question
S0453	i i felt
S0454	isn't it
S0453	it's felt a bite like a lack of trust to me
S0454	but i reckon you're most of the time of you're texting
S0453	no but there's others as well
S0454	yeah but i just think that's a normal question
S0453	yeah
S0454	don't you think you're read a bite much into that
S0453	well anyway i'm just all i
S0454	i just think that's a normal question if you're in a bed with someone and someone start texting to say
S0453	but i can't
S0454	who be you texting
S0453	but i can't make up how i feel
S0454	no i'm just say
S0453	okay
S0454	that maybe you're interpret this in a weird way and if you're in bed with someone texting
S0453	yeah
S0454	it be kind of normal
S0453	yeah well there's other situations
S0454	it's not like i'm say don't text
S0453	no i know okay then i felt you know the gym thing for example that's just part of my lifestyle
S0454	yeah but you be inflexible about it
S0453	i be because it's part of my lifestyle it's not something that i see as
S0454	and sometimes i really don't see you in the week because
S0453	i know
S0454	you don't compromise on the length of time
S0453	i know or
S0454	or even move the day sometimes
S0453	i know
S0454	when there's stuff on sometimes we can't move the events you could move your gym
S0453	i'm sure i have move my
S0453	but maybe not as often
S0454	not much
S0453	anyway
S0454	so then i ask you once could you not cut your gym session short sometimes so we can maybe eat together or go out to this event together or go for a swim together
S0453	mm
S0454	i've ask you to come to the gym here with me
S0453	yeah
S0454	and you've make excuse every single time how many time have we be to the gym here together
S0453	probably hardly any
S0454	once
S0453	once yeah
S0454	in a year but you won't compromise at all you see
S0453	yeah you're right
S0454	and you're like oh it doesn't have the right weight
S0453	i be
S0454	come on
S0453	i be
S0454	this be uncompromising
S0453	no i don't my no but i it's true
S0454	but this but it's about compromise
S0453	but for me i know it be
S0454	if the your reason you have to go be to mentally relax and you know do this to keep fit okay yeah i understand that but
S0453	yeah
S0454	you won't compromise at all on your
S0453	i know
S0454	routine it's just you and that gym at that time it doesn't really feel like i'm in a relationship with someone sometimes
S0453	mm
S0454	like it's not i don't understand the need to mentally switch off and
S0453	well for me
S0454	keep fit
S0453	it's not just switch off it's also yeah i mean it's it's stay sane mentally well stay less insane and in the uk there's all this incidental exercise when you walk everywhere
S0454	yeah i understand all of that
S0453	here there's none it's like just in
S0454	but that's what i'm say that
S0453	yeah
S0454	once a week it would have be nice
S0453	to do stuff together
S0454	to do stuff then like go to the gym
S0453	mm
S0454	go for a cycle ride
S0453	yeah
S0454	i mean we've do it so rarely because you insist on do your way it's always
S0453	yeah
S0454	your way it's not like i'm ask you to stop exercise to stop
S0453	you're right
S0454	exercise or to exercise less often
S0453	i be uncompromising
S0454	very
S0453	that's like my father
S0454	yeah very uncompromising
S0453	yeah and that doesn't lend itself well to relationships
S0454	no not if you're not prepare to change
S0453	no
S0454	anyway carry on
S0453	erm the other thing be erm keep in touch with friends that be something i put down
S0454	yeah this this really worry you that i don't keep in touch with friends very much
S0453	no not not just worry you about you but
S0454	oh i see about you
S0453	mm yeah it's just that i need time to do that
S0454	but you can
S0453	yeah i know but i feel sometimes like i can't
S0454	why
S0453	i don't know it's like the texting
S0454	sometimes you say i want time to email at the weekend and i say
S0453	yeah
S0454	okay and then we both go off on our laptops for a
S0453	and we do
S0454	couple of hours
S0453	yeah that's true that's true no it can be do that can be work around
S0454	yeah
S0453	that that's how
S0454	that can
S0453	that's more workable but
S0454	that other thing you can do be like not come home like you know stay at work and an extra half an hour so that you can make some call
S0453	do email that's true
S0454	and do email you know there be lot of ways around that if i'm if you feel interrupt at home because you know i start talk to you and you can't really focus and
S0453	yeah
S0454	that's a way around it there be ways round like things like that like stay at work to do work and that's something i could do not bring work home
S0453	yeah
S0454	be stay at work an extra hour and finish it off there
S0453	and then there's things like and this be where it get to the fundamentals
S0454	mm yeah this be all kind of nonsensical so far
S0453	okay
S0454	it's all kind of superficial stuff you know
S0453	the the stuff
S0454	you stuff that could easily be work on
S0453	yeah the fundamental be be for me that night at the at the garcia marquez event
S0454	mm
S0453	which first of all i have to be grateful to you for because i wouldn't have be there unless you'd find it
S0454	yeah
S0453	erm i really enjoy it
S0454	yeah it be a nice film
S0453	and and and then at the end i want to chat to people and i and i'll do and i could tell that you didn't and i think that
S0454	well i be probably talk to
S0453	no i know
S0454	well we talk to him for like twenty minutes
S0453	i know
S0454	while we eat that be nice
S0453	yeah i know and then when it become more generalise
S0454	and then after that i think we be gonna go
S0453	yeah i know
S0454	i didn't want to stay till we be the last people there we be literally the last people and you again you wouldn't compromise because i want to go you know just have something to eat and then come
S0453	well i mean
S0454	and that be fine that be nice and we know
S0453	yeah
S0454	but then you know it start to thin out and i want to go and i tell you that
S0453	yeah
S0454	but i wasn't allow to and again i feel like
S0453	mm well yeah
S0454	it be uncompromising
S0453	you felt constrain yes you felt constrain by me
S0454	you felt constrain and i felt constrain
S0453	and i felt constrain you we both felt constrain
S0454	yeah we both felt constrain
S0453	but this be this be this be where we get to the fundamentals
S0454	be this fundamental
S0453	i think it be
S0454	be it
S0453	i
S0454	that you want to stay an extra
S0453	no but it's not the extra
S0454	twenty five minutes
S0453	it's not just the extra
S0454	and i want to leave at that point
S0453	but it's more than just that event and the leave
S0454	yeah because neither of us
S0453	it's an outlook
S0454	can compromise on this
S0453	yeah
S0454	but don't you think there be
S0453	there be there i mean you know one of the things i be
S0454	there be solutions
S0453	yeah well one of the things i be think that could have could have potentially work be you know taxi together
S0454	exactly
S0453	or or you get get your cab but still for me i'm just tell you how i'd feel
S0454	and also for me we didn't plan that as a social event
S0453	i know we didn't plan no
S0454	so then for me
S0453	you weren't mentally prepare
S0454	i wasn't really mentally prepare i be tire
S0453	no
S0454	it be an after work thing
S0453	that's where you're
S0454	i think be nice we can watch a film have a bite to eat
S0453	that's how your mind prepare
S0454	yeah and you see i like to prepare for things
S0453	but mine doesn't
S0454	but you know that
S0453	yeah i know that about
S0454	i've tell you that before
S0453	i know that about
S0454	like it's i'm when i can
S0453	i know
S0454	prepare for things i'm okay about it it's when people like force situations of me and i do feel
S0453	right
S0454	force
S0453	and i felt force
S0454	to stay
S0453	i felt force to leave
S0454	but by that stage there be literally two people leave
S0453	no there be a few there be a
S0454	there be no more than five
S0453	there be a group no well yeah but i be talk to them
S0454	and five and four of them be people who'd organise the film
S0453	i know but i be talk to them and they and and then i have to i have to rush so the way the that that be a fundamental difference between us
S0454	yeah because you won't compromise
S0453	but no you
S0454	i already have compromise
S0453	i know
S0454	i think you'd see at that point
S0453	yeah
S0454	that yeah we talk to
S0453	i have yes
S0454	up until that point we be all want the same thing
S0453	yeah
S0454	be there we talk at that point
S0453	yeah
S0454	this be where the compromise start
S0453	yeah
S0454	now i think we'd already compromise cos i hang around
S0453	but i didn't
S0454	another fifteen minutes
S0453	it didn't register in my i know
S0454	and i'd say to you oh can we go now and you be like oh
S0453	now
S0454	no mm
S0453	now that now that you now that you put it in that way from your perspective and base on how your mind work i can see it as a compromise at the time my mind didn't register it as a compromise because i be so relax and you know
S0454	but you hear me say can we go now
S0453	yeah i know but i couldn't i don't know
S0454	but you ignore me
S0453	it's not
S0454	so then that be the compromise
S0453	well this be where
S0454	for me be stay fifteen minutes and then we leave but no you want to stay until everyone have leave
S0453	well this be well this be no i be just enjoy
S0454	and it and you might might not have occur to you but sometimes those people be hang around like the ambassador because you be there they couldn't be rude that's
S0453	no
S0454	diplomacy for you
S0453	no there be others er as well it wasn't just
S0454	but they be they couldn't leave before everyone do you not see what i'm say
S0453	yeah
S0454	like until everyone leave then they couldn't it be probably a very long day for them too
S0453	yeah
S0454	and they wouldn't have mind go home and
S0453	i but yeah but
S0454	have a drink and
S0453	but it isn't it's
S0454	just chill out for a couple of hours
S0453	but this be not just about that event
S0454	no i'm just say if you you don't really see this from my perspective you're see it all from yours that
S0453	but it's er
S0454	you weren't allow to have entirely your way but what you couldn't see be that i have already make a compromise and i be expect you to make
S0453	i know but i
S0454	some kind of compromise
S0453	and i
S0454	but you didn't
S0453	but i do i leave earlier i could have stay longer
S0454	come on they want to leave there be hardly
S0453	i'm tell you
S0454	anyone leave
S0453	i'm tell you how it felt
S0454	yeah and then you make me feel bad about it
S0453	and be still there chat no i didn't wanna make you feel bad
S0454	but you do
S0453	i know well i'm sorry then i don't wanna make
S0454	i'm sorry too but
S0453	i'm sorry
S0454	you didn't really try
S0453	no
S0454	to be honest
S0453	but i legged it out of there be still chat i want to chat and i say i've get to go i shout and i legged it to find where you be i i i be acutely aware that you weren't that you weren't that you be uncomfortable and there's no way that i would have hang around much longer okay so so
S0454	but you'd make me wait for so long already by then
S0453	i know i'm sorry
S0454	that's how it felt
S0453	okay well i'm sorry
S0454	and that's where the compromise be that you know when i say can we go now you sort of say do you mind if we just stay fifteen minutes and then stick to it
S0453	mm
S0454	instead you be like no
S0453	oh well i yeah i yeah
S0454	that's not very considerate of you
S0453	i know
S0454	no no and no timeframe nothing
S0453	yeah
S0454	so i felt i have to walk out cos it be the only way to make you go so i stay like fifteen minutes
S0453	yeah
S0454	and you make no sign of make
S0453	i
S0454	any move or say be you okay or check up on me in fact it get weird cos you start tell really inappropriate anecdotes about and the farc
S0453	yeah sorry
S0454	which weren't even correct
S0453	yeah that be
S0454	you actually make stuff up to make it sound like dramatic so i get to feel even more uncomfortable
S0453	sorry
S0454	because i be like it wasn't even correct it be actually a lie and it be really inappropriate to talk about that with columbians how do you know
S0453	i know
S0454	that woman hadn't lose her family to
S0453	that's true
S0454	people in the farc
S0453	yeah that's true it be
S0454	i mean god it be awful
S0453	totally
S0454	it be like
S0453	yeah i know and i
S0454	the one thing you know about columbia and you
S0453	yes you never bring up that stuff
S0454	yeah
S0453	i know i'm such a fuck
S0454	i felt really awkward and it be really inappropriate anyway even
S0453	i'm sorry
S0454	if she hadn't be columbian which she be though we didn't know her
S0453	her background
S0454	her background and her thoughts on that but probably weren't very positive
S0453	mm
S0454	and then you say they be friends he be friends with the farc which be actually wrong
S0453	yeah
S0454	it be a business thing
S0453	yeah
S0454	so it be completely wrong
S0453	sorry
S0454	and then
S0453	sorry
S0454	it be really odd even if she hadn't be columbian though it would have be weird because it be a story i tell you in private
S0453	yeah i know
S0454	a private anecdote and then you
S0453	just
S0454	come out with this stuff to random people
S0453	and you be uncomfortable in that situation anyway and then to it make it
S0454	so you make me feel really uncomfortable
S0453	i'm sorry
S0454	and even then you wouldn't leave you didn't care you know you'd say something you shouldn't and it be inappropriate and even then
S0453	i didn't know at the time
S0454	you do know cos
S0453	erm
S0454	as soon as we go to the car park you say i shouldn't have say that should i about the and the farc
S0453	i i no all i
S0454	and i say yeah because it wasn't even correct and it wasn't even true
S0453	but i just saw that you be really annoy and i i be try to work out what it be
S0454	but you know cos you say it yourself
S0453	i know the i know the bite about the yeah yeah but that's like
S0454	so
S0453	hey erm but the the the this be broader though than that
S0454	i know this be one issue but i'm just explain it to you from a different perspective
S0453	i know
S0454	and you obviously hadn't even consider it
S0453	i know
S0454	from another perspective why
S0453	yeah
S0454	that i might have be annoy
S0453	but i don't think you
S0454	that you hadn't compromise
S0453	well i don't
S0454	at all
S0453	but you didn't seem
S0454	like you didn't seem to care
S0453	but you it's
S0454	and then you tell this weird inappropriate story
S0453	i know i'm sorry
S0454	that make everyone feel uncomfortable
S0453	i'm sorry
S0454	that wasn't even a true story
S0453	i that's put my feet
S0454	you just
S0453	foot in it all
S0454	exaggerate and make up stuff
S0453	i have a tendency
S0454	to make yourself look good and it didn't it just look terrible and
S0453	i know
S0454	you know possibly make that woman feel awful as well
S0453	true
S0454	how do you know she didn't lose her brother
S0453	you're right
S0454	or cousin
S0453	you're right
S0454	i mean she might well have do
S0453	that's true i i have a tendency like my father unfortunately of put my foot in in it in social situations and basically end up offend people but but you didn't see what happen after you'd leave which be
S0454	no how could i have
S0453	no i know but erm i mean no i'm not say it literally i'm just just tell you what
S0454	yes so you have to leave
S0453	what what happen
S0454	yes
S0453	no no so so i be there one minute chat to people and then i be look around for you at the same time i be catch between the social situation and try to er
S0454	mm
S0453	make sure you be okay and where you be and then we you know we move onto another group of people and say let me introduce you to and i say i'm sorry i've get to go i have to be i have to literally say sorry i've get to go and i run
S0454	that's okay i mean there be hardly anyone
S0453	i know
S0454	there
S0453	but
S0454	it's not like you leave
S0453	but
S0454	at you know it's not like you walk into a party
S0453	no i know
S0454	say sorry gotta go after just eat the free food
S0453	i know
S0454	i mean you know what i mean
S0453	i know that but the way i felt
S0454	it it wasn't like that
S0453	no but the way i felt what i felt as oppose to the way you felt and we feel very differently about these situations be i felt like i be i be be pull away you felt like you be be subject to erm a very uncomfortable situation for longer than have be promise and
S0454	well the no but you didn't even when i tell you i want to go
S0453	i know
S0454	you still er wouldn't
S0453	i know
S0454	compromise
S0453	i know
S0454	this be what annoy me
S0453	but this be
S0454	that you didn't seem to care
S0453	this be where this we come to the crux of it this be where it's the fundamentals it's not about
S0454	but then that's you
S0453	about
S0454	it's all your way can you not see that that there be a middle way it didn't have to be all my way
S0453	yeah
S0454	and it didn't have to be all
S0453	all my way
S0454	your way it have to be in the middle
S0453	somewhere in between
S0454	we have to say
S0453	but
S0454	let's go within fifteen minutes and then mean it
S0453	i know but i no but i couldn't
S0454	what this be what i mean
S0453	because that's how our social life be
S0454	this be this be selfish
S0453	no
S0454	of you
S0453	no but
S0454	you shouldn't be in a relationship then
S0453	no well that's how i be maybe maybe what need to happen be that maybe you need to be with somebody who have
S0454	well i need to be with someone who care yeah
S0453	no i i do care
S0454	because it doesn't seem like you care
S0453	no i do
S0454	i that's what i felt that night you really didn't care about me it be only about you and you want that's how i felt and it's true isn't it
S0453	no that's not true
S0454	it be true you just say it
S0453	that's not if it be
S0454	i need to be with someone
S0453	hang on i no but
S0454	who actually care
S0453	no it's not care can i finish my sentence you need to be with somebody who have a a similar approach to those situations because it's gonna minimise friction between you
S0454	no
S0453	it's gonna minimise those situations yeah
S0454	you're i need to be with someone who care enough to compromise on what they want and meet someone halfway that's what i need i don't need someone identical to me
S0453	no not identical
S0454	that's bore anyway
S0453	but it it
S0454	and it's not good for you
S0453	no i do
S0454	i need someone who be prepare to compromise
S0453	yeah to
S0454	to meet me hallway
S0453	but
S0454	not to have everything his way
S0453	i know
S0454	and you do and it's unfair it's selfish and it's unfair and you can't have a relationship with anyone like that
S0453	i know
S0454	you say you don't want people to you know be a complete pushover with you and you don't respect them but the truth be they do have to be a pushover for you they have to do everything your way
S0453	you're probably right
S0454	what kind of relationship that will you be happy really
S0453	so in that case
S0454	will you ever be happy
S0453	i'd better not be in a relationship
S0454	well i think no the better thing there be to realise that you're go about things the wrong way
S0453	but i can't that's my personality
S0454	you can't no can't
S0453	it's my personality
S0454	can't that's not a real word
S0453	it's my personality
S0454	can't be something like you can't fly it's physically impossible
S0453	i know you wanna use this the you variant of that word
S0454	no
S0453	i'm anyway
S0454	but you can't change that's really defeatist these be only little things we're talk about that and it's it's how you be bring up your mum really spoil you as well she do that
S0453	well i don't
S0454	arab thing where she let you have your own way you know
S0453	possibly
S0454	take 's toy have everything your way
S0453	it's true
S0454	look what she's do to you as an adult
S0453	she's turn me into a lunatic
S0454	well she's turn you into a selfish
S0453	bastard
S0454	man
S0453	yeah you're probably
S0454	who can't compromise and realise that he can't have everything his own way that's what she's teach you
S0453	you're probably right
S0454	with er arab parent
S0453	how's that how's that gonna change after thirty three years
S0454	consciously consciously be you really gonna be
S0454	a victim all your life
S0453	no not a victim no
S0454	because obviously be
S0453	no i'm not but i'm not
S0454	be you too
S0453	no i'm not a victim
S0454	but you be with this you're say it can't change it's impossible of course it's not impossible
S0453	no but but
S0454	it's about recognise situations like that and analyse it and then think what should have happen there what should i have say what should we have say and next time when someone say it i'm go to try and remember okay i'm gonna say fifteen minutes i'm gonna say half an hour i'm gonna say whatever but i'm gonna say a number and then i'm gonna stick to it and not have a go at the person
S0453	i know but
S0454	afterwards
S0453	i know it's
S0454	for come to a compromise and drag me away no and realise that
S0453	but that's how i felt
S0454	but this be what i'm say
S0453	so well how would how would you have felt if i'd do this if i say the fifteen minutes cos when i when i socialise i don't i don't see the this time
S0454	i know we don't always put it as as a time but don't you see that sometimes we need to
S0453	i see it as open end yeah well you need to
S0454	or fifteen minutes twenty minutes half an hour whatever
S0453	you need
S0454	i'm just say fifteen minutes but
S0453	if we'd do the timer
S0454	i'm say a number
S0453	if we'd do the timer and agree it the fifteen minutes and then i'd find well i'm actually still enjoy this i so you know what why don't you go home but then it be my sort of well how would you have felt if i'd do that you would have felt like shit
S0454	i think that be rude
S0453	yeah but
S0454	yeah
S0453	yeah but then but then i can't deny how i felt i be
S0454	but yeah you can
S0453	enjoy be there
S0454	but that's okay i'm i'm just say that sometimes you have to compromise
S0453	yeah
S0454	you have enjoy yourself for let's say twenty minutes half an hour whatever the timeframe be we agree
S0453	mm
S0454	and at that point you think great i've have a really nice time you think about it that way
S0453	mm
S0454	not i have to stay you know another half an hour and do you know what i so maybe i'll go out tomorrow night i'm gonna make an effort to go out and meet new people tomorrow night as well with or without and i'll tell her that tonight
S0453	yeah but i still
S0454	i'm go out to a bar tomorrow i really wanna meet people
S0453	but yeah i know i know i know that's one of the things be that we need our definitely need to have our own social live
S0454	yeah
S0453	that involve meet new people and not be there together
S0454	yeah true
S0453	i think that be important for both of us
S0454	yeah and i do tell you to do that a lot
S0453	you do but i didn't realise its importance until now
S0454	yeah that's a pity
S0453	and then
S0454	cos i do tell you that you need to do it once a week
S0453	yeah
S0454	away from me and you didn't
S0453	the other thing be i do feel like we be around each other too too much like we be too
S0454	yes
S0453	do too much together
S0454	i agree but this be
S0453	we be force
S0454	again and again i tell you you need to go out once a week and you never do
S0453	no i know this be really important
S0454	and i know this
S0453	i'm gonna learn i'm gonna learn the lesson but
S0454	i do know that
S0453	yeah i didn't
S0454	that i need to make more effort too but not cos i really need to but i could see that you need to
S0453	mm and then
S0454	i really do ask you a lot of time to do that
S0453	i know you do and i didn't really i didn't realise and then erm you know erm sometimes there's you know there be hobbies and things that i've be do now well now on my own
S0454	yeah i think that's healthy actually
S0453	that i didn't have time to do when when when we be together
S0454	but you say you didn't have time but again it's
S0453	or i didn't make time
S0454	exactly not have time
S0453	i didn't make time yeah
S0454	be
S0453	yeah
S0454	be not true not make time so and also that you need to do those things on your own like you hardly ever go fish do you you've be like three time in a year you could have do that a lot more
S0453	yeah
S0454	or draw or whatever you could have
S0453	yeah
S0454	just drive yourself somewhere and
S0453	i know
S0454	start to draw
S0453	but
S0454	but don't you see that this be you
S0453	it
S0454	you didn't make time
S0453	yes
S0454	you didn't take make the effort
S0453	you're right
S0454	i encourage you to go fish
S0453	you do
S0454	to hang out with your friends
S0453	you do
S0454	and also we both need a wider circle cos you hardly know
S0453	we
S0454	anyone here and i know more people than you
S0453	yeah you do
S0454	but not not really as like close friends cos i'm hang out with the wrong people you know the walk group's nice cos it's here and
S0453	yeah i know
S0454	but
S0453	i think all of it
S0454	i need a a wider group you know to go out in a bar with people i actually like and well maybe i wouldn't like them but the point be a a wider group so there be a higher
S0453	yeah
S0454	percentage of me find
S0453	yeah
S0454	a probability of
S0453	of find people that you like
S0454	find people i i get on with
S0453	yeah and and i think that all of these issue could have be make better if both of us weren't the deferential type that would would you know kind of put up with things and not raise doesn't wanna er you know avoid conversations to
S0454	but now it's come to a head
S0453	yeah i know
S0454	what's amaze for me be you're just gonna go that's enough
S0453	no but there be
S0454	that's amaze for me cos to me we just kind of go through that list and say i'm sorry but there's nothing there really
S0453	no there be
S0454	that couldn't be
S0453	no
S0454	work on go on
S0453	there be
S0454	well you haven't get to it yet
S0453	that's it it's that for me it's the
S0454	because all of this seem to be kind of like you haven't have enough time to do things that's not actually true you haven't make enough time to do things
S0453	okay
S0454	solution you make enough time to do it
S0453	yeah
S0454	you don't compromise on your things that's quite serious
S0453	no but it's the character trait
S0454	and it's a problem
S0453	it's a character trait
S0454	well you say it's a character trait not be able to compromise
S0453	no no not the
S0454	but i don't think that be actually a fix character trait
S0453	no it's not not no that that's not fix but it's also just the difference between us socially okay that's how it be it's fundamental difference in character it's about it's not just about the not compromise there's more a bite more to it than that it's about our level of introversion and extroversion and how comfortable we feel around other people you're an introvert i'm an introvert but i'm an introvert that flit between extroversion and introversion depend on my mood
S0454	mm
S0453	sometimes i get a real buzz
S0454	yeah
S0453	from be around other people and i i
S0454	yeah i can see that but again we didn't have to do everything together and that's actually a problem do everything together so i think you could have
S0453	yeah
S0454	do some of this stuff on your own
S0453	i could have
S0454	and
S0453	although although although i do
S0454	that instead of try to do everything together
S0453	but i do there be
S0454	do you
S0453	yeah there be occasion
S0454	when
S0453	when when i'd meet friends that er at events that i'd invite you to such as and or even though you go to a lot of them erm there be that occasion when they go to play mini golf with a couple of friends
S0454	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0453	yeah but other situations as well where i felt i do feel like i couldn't really cos what i want be to involve you in my social life
S0454	mm
S0453	but
S0454	maybe a bite too much
S0453	well
S0454	that's not actually that healthy to be
S0453	yeah that's true
S0454	bite too much in each pocket
S0453	that's true i and i think that's the problem with
S0454	but actually it would have be good at least once a week for us not have be do stuff together
S0453	i mean
S0454	and i don't mean the gym i mean
S0453	yeah i know
S0454	socially
S0453	i you're right but er the way i felt about it at the time be i've invite her i know along i know she doesn't like these events so i have to respect what she want but i feel like there's something miss here
S0454	mm
S0453	and i'm wonder how she be feel even though that that wonderment wonderment be unfounded because you be perfectly fine but it it do it i still felt like there be something miss for me
S0454	mm
S0453	and i i and i think that and have get that problem because she's quite clingy and she want to be round him all the time he need his alone time sometimes he's tell me
S0454	yeah
S0453	he sometimes and she doesn't get it she's she see it as
S0454	but i do get it with you
S0453	you do get it yeah i know
S0454	i say it to you so many time
S0453	no you do get it you do get it
S0454	i do get it and then you didn't do it
S0453	yeah you do get it and i i know but
S0454	it wasn't like i didn't get it
S0453	but that but that doesn't change how we're underneath as people it really
S0454	you seem to want us to do everything together and you've just say that that's not healthy
S0453	it's not healthy but you do too
S0454	no i didn't want to do everything with you
S0453	that's true no you didn't
S0454	i would rather you have do some of those
S0453	other other things
S0454	stuff on your own so that i didn't have to go to those events like you know like or something i'm not gonna like those people
S0453	no
S0454	what what be the point you would have like it
S0453	that's true
S0454	and you would probably have like it more
S0453	but you but there be a
S0454	have i not be there
S0453	there be a talk though
S0454	yeah i know the talk be really interest
S0453	no it be interest
S0454	no i'm i'm just say things like that we didn't have to do those things together
S0453	and i'm really grateful and you know and i'm really grateful at the er for the events that you get me involve in
S0454	yeah i wish you'd do more of the things that i'd suggest and the
S0453	yeah
S0454	there be so much stuff that we could have do
S0453	there be
S0454	that would have be fun and we would have meet new people but you just always be like make excuse not to do it
S0453	yeah i know
S0454	every time i suggest
S0453	yeah you're right
S0454	er something other than a talk or a film you would like make an excuse
S0453	you're right
S0454	they be the only things you want to do and they be not good events for meet people i enjoy them but it have to be more than that
S0453	yeah you're right it have to be the premise have to be meet people
S0454	yeah or at least we have to alternate not always do the same thing
S0453	mm yeah and i i've you know i really i enjoy the cook together i think that be good
S0454	yeah that be nice
S0453	i think it be great and you really
S0454	that be really nice
S0453	get me involve and it be
S0454	yeah no i enjoy do that
S0453	me too erm and i enjoy the events that you get me to go to erm
S0454	yeah they be nice
S0453	the thing have be great
S0454	yeah
S0453	yeah
S0454	that's be really good
S0453	and you spot all the and that stuff it's great but you know i think i really think that my decision be erm
S0454	i think there's nothing on your piece of paper that can't be solve but you've already make your decision
S0453	there's well there's
S0454	so
S0453	there's two options
S0454	i don't really understand
S0454	this string me along
S0453	no okay well that's the thing
S0454	thing
S0453	cos there's there's there's two options there's we don't have contact and we see how we feel in three months you might come back from the uk and you might think you're a cunt and i don't wanna see you again so get stuff
S0454	i'll just think i need to move on
S0453	yeah
S0454	i can't hang on
S0453	i know
S0454	any more
S0453	i yeah i know that exactly
S0454	that's not fair
S0453	yeah i know it's not
S0454	so i just to just draw a line
S0453	i know
S0454	at least by the end of this month and say but there's no point wait until the end of this month because i'm go away for seven weeks like if you're gonna try and sort things out it need to happen in the next month and it's a good trial period it's perfect weather and a month be about right
S0453	i can't do that
S0454	and if you can't again
S0453	i can't do it
S0454	you see this word
S0453	well i can't i don't feel ready to do it and i i honestly i'm really and it's not just you know you say yesterday it's the fear of the difficult issue and i think do the difficult things it's not it's not just that it may be partly that it's not just that it's fear of this end in an undignified and a
S0454	it doesn't matter
S0453	it to me it do
S0454	it doesn't
S0453	i to me it do
S0454	why
S0453	because i love you that's why and and and i value
S0454	if you love me then you would try
S0453	no and i value the friendship you you don't seem that bother
S0454	but there isn't gonna be one
S0453	well yeah you don't seem that bother about it well i
S0454	because you're not a fighter and you don't really care
S0453	no
S0454	this be how i feel if you care about me really instead of some lovey dovey nonsense that you seem to be give me then you would fight for it at least try
S0453	yeah well maybe that's indicative then of my underlie feel that i don't see a future that the that's that maybe that much be
S0454	maybe that be
S0453	that
S0454	true
S0453	that
S0454	but i think your language
S0453	that much be clear
S0454	be be like indicative of that
S0453	well
S0454	yeah
S0453	that much be clear what's not clear be that that my reason why be it well the reason why in term of you know the character differences between us that i view as fundamental and you may disagree be be one aspect to it but why why i feel there's no future be it because i'm no good with relationships and i can't compromise and i've be spoil and blah blah blah and be alone alone so long be that it or be it us be it our
S0454	i think it's you
S0454	honestly
S0453	but but in but in either case in either case whether it's me or us erm no one be to blame here you're not to blame the language i've hear from you recently and and the language i'm still hear from you be be almost as if to assuage your guilt about about feel that you might not have do enough nobody's no one's do anything wrong here well you know there may be differences of opinion about that with you but you've not do anything wrong i don't want you to feel like you i don't want you to beat yourself up about things and think if only i'd do that and if only i'd do that that's not that's not that's i don't want you to think like that i don't want you to beat yourself up about things because no one's to blame here this be just this be just how our character have have interact for two years and and this be the end product it's not this be not you do things wrong and you do that that's what i really don't want you to think like that because then you're gonna be eat up by guilt in the same way that i be i've be i've be be eat up by guilt by for break up with you so you you can't think like that and if you do want to move on then you're gonna have to abandon that kind of think that's one
S0454	oh i'm very capable of move on don't worry
S0453	yeah i know and
S0454	so this be it like you can't keep string me on for months and months and months you've already do it enough so this be it there's a month to sort it out don't leave it till the night before and say the night before my flight and say oh actually i want to sort it out now no if you want to try and sort it out this be it okay then that's the chance go it's the window i need to move on with my life and not be leave hang any longer you
S0453	i
S0454	it seem to me like you don't want the relationship to carry on because you don't see a future that's what that really come down to
S0453	it it it's
S0454	whatever the reason be
S0453	i wouldn't i wouldn't have break up if i if i didn't if i felt otherwise
S0454	and why you seem to need to to plan this future ahead so carefully i find odd
S0453	what future
S0454	exactly we don't know what we're gonna be do in a year's time or where we'll be so why be you worry about it
S0453	i'm not worry about it
S0454	it's well
S0453	i'm not worry about it but i'm worry about string you along i don't wanna do what
S0454	string me along be
S0453	but
S0454	if you don't love someone
S0453	no but can i
S0454	and you don't care about them
S0453	it's more
S0454	and
S0453	it's more than that no it's more than that it's more
S0454	in 's case there's also that she really want to have children
S0453	be awful
S0454	and he's gonna stop her have children
S0453	be
S0454	and he's two time her come on i mean if that's not string someone along
S0453	two three four yeah he's be a
S0454	then i don't know what be
S0453	yeah
S0454	but be you like that
S0453	yeah 's a no i'm not i'm not like that i don't want to be like that i pride myself on not be like that
S0454	yeah you're not like that so
S0453	and that's why
S0454	don't you think that's not a fair comparison to yourself
S0453	no
S0454	that he's the
S0453	no but
S0454	you know
S0453	i don't wanna be like that
S0454	he's string her
S0453	don't want to
S0454	along in the worst possible
S0453	yeah
S0454	way
S0453	he be he's a selfish bastard and fundamentally after everything i've do to support him when his grandma die who do you think be the first person he call
S0454	yeah i know
S0453	cos he's get fuck all else
S0454	but i tell you this that he's a good friend while you don't need anything
S0453	yeah absolutely
S0454	and you just
S0453	i haven't speak to him
S0454	if you want someone to have a laugh with he's your man
S0454	he's gonna be but if you've get any kind of problem
S0453	something serious don't don't go for it
S0454	don't don't bother
S0453	yeah
S0454	that's not what he's for and if you need someone
S0453	you're absolutely right
S0454	who's a better friend then that then make someone who's a better friend
S0453	yeah
S0454	but
S0453	you're right
S0454	that doesn't mean you should drop contact with him you just need to recognise who he be
S0453	yeah
S0454	er what you're deal with and that he's not gonna change for you just because you do it for him mm he's not gonna reciprocate
S0453	you're right
S0454	he doesn't feel any need to
S0453	yeah you're right erm the
S0454	but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be friends
S0453	yeah you're right the other thing erm i just want to say be i don't want because we both have problems with trust
S0454	well yeah clearly
S0453	yeah we both have problems with trust and
S0454	but i think mine have be quite justify in this relationship to be honest
S0453	i i mean i mean i don't wanna say justify or not or look at look at
S0454	oh come on
S0453	causation and look at who's
S0454	you apply to
S0453	no i don't wanna
S0454	job in a different country
S0453	yeah
S0454	without tell me
S0453	fine
S0454	when we'd arrange a plan
S0453	but
S0454	that i would
S0453	the
S0454	move here and and the only reason i find out be cos tell me
S0453	okay but your trust
S0454	it's the same with string me along for six months
S0453	i know
S0454	the only reason i find out be cos i ask you outright
S0453	yeah but i tell you i be always plan to explain to you why i'd wait that long
S0454	six months be a long time come on
S0453	yeah it be a long time but you're your mum be here you didn't break up with when his parent be visit
S0454	no but that be
S0453	for the same reason
S0454	that be a week
S0453	fine
S0454	not six months
S0453	your mum be here a week no fine but then there be your sister's news and i felt it felt like the wrong time and i speak
S0454	but there be never gonna be a right time
S0453	and i suppose
S0454	when someone get cancer
S0453	i know
S0454	it you think
S0453	i know
S0454	she be gonna get better all of a sudden
S0453	no she wasn't but but it first break and
S0454	yes that would have be insensitive
S0453	yeah
S0454	but again but i mean again a couple of weeks or a month but not six months
S0453	i know yeah
S0454	it's be go on and on
S0453	i know that be look every everything be point to this desire to sugar coat everything and avoid confrontation and avoid difficult stuff be it actually have the opposite effect it cause way more problems than directly confront those issue
S0454	yeah
S0453	that's what i'm learn from this whole experience
S0454	but you don't want the relationship to continue so it can't that's the bottom line this nothing there that can't be work on
S0453	do you wanna give me my list
S0454	but the point be you don't want to work on it
S0453	i i don't feel that now be the time to work on it no that's how that's how i feel
S0454	this be the perfect time to work on it how
S0453	no
S0454	how can it not be
S0453	because i don't want us to i don't want us to end what's be a very fulfil and enjoyable relationship
S0454	be you scar again
S0453	yeah i'm scar yeah i'm scar i don't i'm
S0454	it's easier to move on if you don't like them actually
S0453	i that's how you view it
S0454	well it be trust me
S0453	to me to me because you don't you don't care that if we we lose all respect for each other just have a shout match
S0454	but don't you think i already have
S0453	yeah i know you've lose respect for me
S0454	i've lose respect for you for not fight
S0453	yeah well the the but this be how i if i felt different
S0454	so if you fight for it
S0453	okay but if i felt
S0454	i'd actually respect you more
S0453	but if i felt differently then i would be fight for it but you you what you need to recognise be this be indicative of how i feel
S0454	but you be say you love me on the one hand and you
S0453	i do
S0454	and you care about me
S0453	yes
S0454	and there be
S0453	and i do
S0454	so many things that be right about the relationship
S0453	there be so many things
S0454	but you you're not prepare you be able to then go through and see how things can be different on that list
S0453	yeah apart from apart from the fundamentals
S0454	well what you what you say be the fundamental be you can't see a future in it but you're not able to articulate what that mean
S0453	no the reason okay what that mean be i find i mean you know i find myself i find myself look forward as a as a take the columbian thing enjoy you know look forward more to these events and or you know spend time around these complete strangers than spend time with you
S0454	but that's because we spend too much time together
S0453	possibly er possibly i don't know that's
S0454	but don't you think that's normal in a relationship too
S0453	all i know be my judgement about things feel cloud and the reason why i that's not normal for me i'm normally quite a decisive guy i'm normally someone who doesn't beat about the bush i'm not someone who go in twenty four hours from blow one way to blow another i'm normally really decisive i never have problems with make decisions right but the reason i do be obviously because something fuck complex be go on in there and that complex thing be toy with things and on the one hand deal with the guilt of have end it with you and hurt you clearly and on the other hand you know try to try to get on with life but also give you know give you the reason why i feel the relationship er er need to end so
S0454	none of those be very powerful reason
S0453	not to you but they they be to me
S0454	none of those be very powerful
S0453	okay not to again not to you and not not to you but they be to me
S0454	they be all things that could have be sort out and they be all things nearly all of them be things i'd already suggest and ask you repeatedly to do
S0453	if i mean if if you plan
S0453	to come back to right
S0454	yeah
S0453	if your plan be to come back then what's wrong with have a hiatus that will allow us to reflect on things
S0454	i think i've be string along enough
S0453	okay
S0454	don't you
S0453	well that's how you view it then then we have to end it we have to end it because
S0454	yeah
S0453	i don't wanna string you string you along any more
S0454	yeah that's that then
S0453	i just hope i just
S0454	we've get to draw a line under it
S0453	yeah i just hope i just
S0454	you've already push me around over the last twenty four hours
S0453	i'm sorry
S0454	this way that way
S0453	i'm sorry
S0454	i'm not gonna wait
S0453	i know
S0454	until september
S0453	i don't want i don't you to intuit
S0454	well august and erm
S0453	okay i don't want to you to intuit
S0454	you know kind of hope and then you say oh actually
S0453	well this be the thing no no no this be the thing it would be wait with no guarantee that the position will change but it's to just give allow us both of us
S0454	i think you should know to be honest
S0453	but
S0454	you've think about it for six months if you don't know by now i don't know what's wrong with you
S0453	okay well maybe there's something wrong with me
S0454	you should know
S0453	yeah well i i
S0454	and you've also now have on top of that six months where you just didn't tell me
S0453	i eighty
S0454	and you be plan to break up with me
S0453	i eighty to ninety percent know but when you when you make a decision as big as this in your life right that
S0454	you sound like we're we're commit our we're not
S0453	no but look it's the hardest decision i've ever have to make it really be if i if it wasn't i wouldn't have this all this shit go on so it's the hardest decision i've ever have to make
S0454	well what's annoy me be you won't even try and fix these things that's what annoy me you're able to
S0453	well because
S0454	articulate some things that aren't right i agree with you
S0453	yeah but
S0454	those those be valid point but what you're not prepare to do be try that's what annoy me
S0453	couldn't couldn't yeah but
S0454	and when you're not prepare to try then there's no hope
S0453	the way i see it though be be that the fundamental incompatibility thing about how we be socially be something that can work
S0454	well let's give up then
S0453	can be well hang on can be work on to an extent but can't be resolve that's how i feel
S0454	can't but won't try
S0453	no
S0454	that's the what it come down to
S0453	no it's not that and i also don't wanna have a little bite of a go like this for a month when i'm still get a lot of really complex feel inside about this relationship the proof be the other night when i be in that bar and trade drink with those two teachers and they be out to have a good time i felt like dog shit and all i could talk about be our recent breakup and then it's like bring up their stories and they get so upset that they leave
S0454	mm yeah that be kind of inappropriate of you
S0453	yeah but that's how i felt i couldn't help it that's how i felt it would be wrong of me to come back here even though the time you as you say would have be great and blah blah blah it would be wrong of me in that state of mind to come back here with my judgement cloud about things and really know that i'm eighty to ninety percent feel that it shouldn't continue to come back try and give things a go still have those same reservations that i've
S0454	why be it wrong to try
S0453	no hang on at this time because i feel i feel like i'm still i've still get the reservations in my head i've still get a lot of complex stuff go on and i don't want i don't wanna do that to you i don't wanna that would be
S0454	this be worse
S0453	negligent
S0454	what you're do
S0453	fine in that case we have to draw a line and i don't wanna if you feel like take time out from each other for three months
S0454	don't string me along even longer
S0453	fine fine that's
S0454	you've string me along long enough
S0453	okay let's not do it then let's not let's we the
S0454	that's not fair
S0453	okay i i just hope
S0454	and you can't behave like that
S0453	and by the way the back to the trust issue the the trust issue i know that i've do stuff that's not inspire trust but your trust issue predate that as do mine and and i i just wanna say cos you do say this the other day when we be when we be talk about it you say i you know i don't i can't i trust you blah blah blah
S0454	i do
S0453	i know
S0454	up to a point once you do that thing with the job i never fully trust you again
S0453	okay
S0454	because you really deceive me then
S0453	okay
S0454	so to be honest yeah i never fully trust you again
S0453	well i'm sorry
S0454	that be a really big deal but i guess it be good that
S0453	there be some
S0454	i didn't trust you fully
S0453	there be stuff that be a big deal to me though
S0454	like what
S0453	which like
S0454	like i mean you still accuse me of sleep with and that's bizarre
S0453	no okay alright let's leave that now for for now
S0454	and i don't know how many time i can tell you
S0453	okay
S0454	tell you the same thing and i tell you
S0453	okay i'm sorry

S0454	where we've work out some story that
S0453	okay can i just
S0454	we'll lie to you and and you know for what purpose i'm not quite sure
S0453	can i just say what i be gonna say
S0454	go on
S0453	which be which be that that when i erm when i erm first tell you how incredibly unhappy i be at
S0454	mm
S0453	the reaction i be expect this be this be this be the truth the reaction i be expect be oh you know sorry to hear that you know i'm i'm really sorry to hear that you you're unhappy at you know what's wrong what's the problem what you know what can
S0454	mm
S0453	what do you think you can do to make things better the reaction i get be oh for fuck's sake you know you know oh
S0454	i still do feel like that
S0453	yeah
S0454	about it because
S0453	okay
S0454	you never speak to them about the problem what the issue be
S0453	it couldn't
S0454	you never you never give them a chance and some of it be quite minor stuff that they could have fix like there be an issue with where you be place in the office
S0453	it be it
S0454	it be so noisy and it be awful
S0453	well let me let me
S0454	and you can't possibly
S0453	no
S0454	do your work like this be
S0453	i'm really
S0454	kind of fixable
S0453	i i'm really no it be not can i just explain
S0454	the office thing be fixable
S0453	can i just explain that i'm so glad i leave that company
S0454	yeah i think
S0453	i would
S0454	you do the right thing
S0453	and i would never have be happy there
S0454	but i still think they have a right to know
S0453	and he do er tell me my boss's boss he say you should have tell somebody we would have make
S0454	yes
S0453	yes he say that and then i say but the concern that i've describe to you be fundamental feature of the way this company run it's
S0454	mm
S0453	it's how a massive us multinational work
S0454	yeah
S0453	if
S0454	and they couldn't have change that
S0453	and so i feel a lot of parallel with the current situation
S0454	i'm just say you didn't give them a chance and like you be not give me a chance now this seem to be your mo
S0453	give a chance
S0454	that you
S0453	give give a give something a chance
S0454	give them a chance to respond
S0453	yeah but give no okay
S0454	give at least
S0453	i wanna give you
S0454	they have a right to know
S0453	i know you have a right to
S0454	and i have a right to know
S0453	yeah you do have a definitely have a right to know
S0454	and i i didn't know
S0453	you do you definitely have a right to know and and that's something that i
S0454	and really i feel
S0453	i regret
S0454	deceive
S0453	do you feel like you've you've have six months of your life waste
S0454	yeah that it be all a waste of time
S0453	i'm sorry
S0454	i think one thing i think we be get on great and you didn't you be just act for six months
S0453	no we be get on well
S0454	you just say
S0453	yeah i know but but but i know
S0454	so it be all an act it be all a waste of time
S0453	what i want to get to be when you say i trust you before and i felt that the implication there be i can't i'm gonna struggle to er ever trust anyone or blah blah blah i really hope that you
S0454	oh it's not anyone it's you
S0453	i know yeah it's me i know but
S0454	because you've be really deceitful actually not just once but twice in the relationship so i hope you work on that
S0453	yeah
S0454	it's not fair on the other person
S0453	do you wanna give me feedback then about how shit i be
S0454	not really
S0453	cos it will help me
S0454	you're can if you want
S0453	why don't you tell me holy shit you've write a fuck
S0454	i write page okay so the first
S0453	you you've write a fuck
S0454	the first one we've already we've discuss a lot of this okay so it's not be supportive when i suggest network events like where we meet new people
S0453	mm
S0454	like meet up brunch camp drink and other blah blah blah
S0453	can i be devil's advocate sometimes
S0454	blah blah blah but yet you expect me to support you at your events
S0453	can i be devil's can i
S0454	okay go on
S0453	you keep say you know that about me and stuff it's true but sometimes
S0454	about this
S0453	no yeah about this this yeah
S0454	this point
S0453	yeah this point
S0454	you didn't know that
S0453	no i do know that
S0454	oh okay
S0453	yeah but hang on i'm just be devil's advocate
S0454	mm
S0453	you keep say that you should know that about me or
S0454	no it's not that you should know it's that
S0453	yeah you do know
S0454	you do know
S0453	yeah i do know but then there be still you assume that i'll know exactly what's go on in your head all the time and i don't
S0454	no i know that but in this particular case this one you do know about this
S0453	so definitely
S0454	and we do discuss it
S0453	compromise and
S0454	yeah
S0453	and be a bite more considerate towards other people's feel
S0454	but also that you would have enjoy these things
S0453	yeah but let me just say
S0454	you would have meet new new people
S0453	that's true
S0454	you would have like that
S0453	oh for sure but can we
S0454	it would have make our relationship better
S0453	it would have be more considerate towards people
S0454	yes
S0453	it's
S0454	support them
S0453	support them and exactly and understand
S0454	and meet them halfway
S0453	where they're come from exactly be something that i need to work on what i think
S0454	cos you didn't do anything social that i want to do
S0453	you're right what i think i need
S0454	we have here once that be nice but it be quiet
S0453	it be quiet she's lovely i really like her
S0454	she be lovely but we didn't do any of these things these group things ever
S0453	this be true so let me just say this be what i need to work on be compromise and meet people halfway what i think you need to work on be be more forthright about articulate how you're feel
S0454	i think i do say that
S0453	no i i know but what you do be you get upset or you know you internalise it and then you walk off where you with with whoever it be you have your next relationship with i think you need to be a little bite more bold and a little bite more direct about how you're feel inside so that that there's no doubt as to
S0454	mm
S0453	as to how you're
S0454	okay can we move on
S0453	that person that person have no doubt
S0454	cos this all about me now and
S0453	sorry
S0454	this be suppose to be about you
S0453	suppose to be about me
S0454	erm number two accuse me of lie about suppose
S0453	i'm sorry about that
S0454	relationships and
S0453	yeah
S0454	repeat accusations about the same person or people or situation it's not just once you say it it's repeat
S0453	this be true
S0454	over like more than two years now
S0453	it's insecurity
S0454	it's weird er get angry or upset if i don't explain where i be every minute of the day
S0453	mm
S0454	and then make insinuations
S0453	i'm sorry
S0454	like when i say i be at the supermarket
S0453	that's an
S0454	you then make insinuations that perhaps i be with some guy that's weird
S0453	mm i know the insecurity again
S0454	that's very odd okay er four be relate to this phone repeatedly when i don't answer instead of wait for me to call back again
S0453	yeah
S0454	because you be so insecure i mean
S0453	that's true
S0454	obviously i can see on the phone that you've call so there's no need to call me another five time
S0453	this be true
S0454	cos i can't either i can't answer the phone cos i'm in the middle of do something or i don't want to but either way i know that you've call and you've already send a message to say whatever can you call me when you're free that's it you don't need to do it again it's annoy and so all of er
S0453	and oppressive
S0454	so it's annoy and it's oppressive and it mean you don't trust me which doesn't make me feel good about myself er five be relate to
S0453	or about trust me
S0454	these be all about trust i've put that together
S0453	or or about trust me
S0454	trust yourself
S0453	yeah no or about you trust me
S0454	mm i didn't really see it like that it be just you don't trust me
S0453	okay
S0454	refuse to give me the internet password or see the bill for the house erm not let me pay the half bill half the bill as a result again it be about trust you don't trust me to have an internet password you give me various excuse
S0453	no the the bill thing
S0454	about it
S0453	the bill thing be chivalry it wasn't trust the
S0454	but don't you think it i want to pay them but i
S0453	i know you do
S0454	ask you a lot of time
S0453	i know
S0454	and it wasn't a lot of money come on look at the part of the world
S0453	i know you do
S0454	we're in where
S0453	i know yeah
S0454	you know water's dirt cheap
S0453	exactly that's exactly
S0454	i didn't mind if
S0453	well that's exactly right
S0454	i i pay half
S0453	yeah i didn't mind
S0454	and i would've felt more comfortable
S0453	i didn't mind if i pay it all
S0454	pay all of them
S0453	i didn't mind if i pay them all
S0454	i know you didn't mind but there be an inequality there and it wasn't very much money be it but anyway refuse to give me the internet password and not let me see the bill
S0453	yeah
S0454	never mind pay the bill
S0453	yeah the see the bill i've get them on a
S0454	it's a trust thing
S0453	phone on my mobile phone
S0454	you can email them
S0453	i check the
S0454	there's an email
S0453	no it's not it's a the bank app so i log in i go into the the little
S0454	it doesn't matter you can just show me
S0454	this be the bill when i ask it's not a big deal
S0453	i know but like it be
S0454	okay but the internet password thing
S0453	that's not a one
S0454	be weird that's weird i live here how do you think
S0453	but that's my password for email and i think it's
S0454	okay but again we establish that you can just
S0453	i could have change it
S0454	change the password
S0453	okay that's minor
S0454	so that's not
S0453	it's not a big deal
S0454	mm it doesn't make me feel
S0453	but the other stuff
S0454	very comfortable in the house though when i'm not allow to to see these very basic things relate to household
S0453	true
S0454	normal household run i don't really feel i'm part of the house
S0453	mm
S0454	i feel like i'm a visitor in the same way you wouldn't show your mother the gas bill because she's visit i felt like a visitor because of that
S0453	yeah i'm sorry
S0454	it's okay erm and the next one be the last one on the trust thing stick to me like limpet when we do socialise
S0453	yeah
S0454	and refuse to leave me to socialise when i ask
S0453	yeah
S0454	we would both be happier do that but
S0453	but you didn't tell me this
S0454	i do tell you that
S0453	when
S0454	and you say i can't i can't leave you
S0453	when do you tell me leave you
S0454	i tell a couple of weeks ago i remember discuss this for a start
S0453	couple of weeks ago
S0454	yeah and you say
S0453	that be when we break up
S0454	and when i ask you okay
S0453	that's when
S0454	three weeks ago i don't know
S0453	where be we
S0454	here in the house i think and you say i can't though i just can't do that i feel really bad and i say what do you mean can't
S0453	no i think you
S0454	of course you can
S0453	i no but i think that be mean as in you leave me at home and then you go off and do your thing
S0454	no
S0453	you mean at the social
S0454	yes
S0453	okay i didn't know that
S0454	you're like a limpet
S0453	i didn't maybe i be yeah you're right
S0454	anyway all of those i've put in a group call
S0453	trust
S0454	you don't trust me
S0453	yeah that's
S0454	and there's quite a lot of things
S0453	that's true
S0454	so if you don't trust me then
S0453	have you get a content page
S0454	no i put those together to make it easier though okay these the next ones be all relate to socialise so that be the first of the socialise one but it be also the end of the trust so on the socialise front dominate conversations when we socialise instead of allow me or others to speak
S0453	i agree
S0454	you do that quite a lot and the when you don't get to dominate the conversation you complain you're not allow to talk
S0453	yeah
S0454	but actually
S0453	i be the domineer
S0454	you be allow to talk
S0453	but you do that too
S0454	you know when we do that
S0453	when you talk
S0454	tap the conversation thing
S0453	when you talk it you it i think we can't talk to the same people at the same time
S0454	no but you know yeah that's true well i'm nervous
S0453	unless it's
S0454	i talk too much
S0453	yeah
S0454	as well
S0453	it just keep go it's like a way of fill the void
S0454	yeah that's overcompensate when i'm nervous though
S0453	but we doesn't well it doesn't happen with people like
S0454	no it doesn't happen with cos we both feel relax with him
S0453	yes
S0454	or or something
S0453	yeah exactly
S0454	that wouldn't happen okay discuss inappropriate and embarrass topics in front of other men with me
S0453	yeah that's true
S0454	they be all people i don't know well for example
S0453	yeah like the prostitute yeah
S0454	prostitution porn
S0454	wank your
S0453	yeah sorry yeah
S0454	previous sexual encounter
S0453	sorry
S0454	so those things make me feel very uncomfortable
S0453	i know it's horrible
S0454	and when i'm already feel a bite awkward you then make it a whole lot worse
S0453	mm
S0454	cos you don't show any consideration
S0453	mm
S0454	er nine share inappropriate anecdotes i tell you in private with random people this be like the the farc one with that be totally inappropriate
S0453	it be
S0454	erm and okay so those be the socialise ones that i've lump together
S0453	yeah
S0454	but you know talk about share inappropriate sexual things now you know go on from inappropriate anecdotes and talk about your previous sexual encounter discuss our sex life with your friends that's very offensive erm okay
S0453	don't you discuss our sex life with a close friend sometimes
S0454	er it's inappropriate especially if you expect me to meet them afterwards
S0453	no not meet them i mean i mean you know for example you know now you talk to a friend about the break up
S0454	no the breakup
S0453	what be this
S0454	that's okay
S0453	oh that's the breakup yeah
S0454	that's not sexual
S0453	yeah that's true what be the sex one
S0454	no you tell stuff that be really inappropriate
S0453	yeah that be yeah
S0454	and then say oh i'd like you to meet him
S0453	well
S0454	why would i want to meet him now it's embarrass
S0453	he tell me stuff about his girlfriend
S0454	okay but as we've establish
S0453	that doesn't two wrong don't make a
S0454	he's a wanker
S0453	he be a wanker yeah
S0454	so
S0453	yeah he be
S0454	yeah anyway okay so the next one i've star as very important
S0453	mm
S0454	dishonesty and yet claim to be honest as you didn't tell an outright lie for example apply to your job abroad and not tell me and the breakup so you say
S0453	this be
S0454	i would never lie to you you tell me that
S0453	well
S0454	so many time in the relationship i'd never lie to you i could never lie to you but you're lie all the time to me you're
S0454	you're lie by omission
S0453	i can't argue with that
S0454	that's really serious that be one that put all of those
S0453	i didn't see
S0454	other things
S0453	i didn't see them as lie
S0454	they're kind of like
S0453	at the time but they be
S0454	but they be they're very serious
S0453	yeah they be
S0454	they're very serious lie
S0453	they be
S0454	okay er twelve allow your family and friends to disrespect me and steal stuff from our home and then assume that money can just fix it

S0454	with she's mentally ill so we're gonna i'll let that one go
S0453	but with i would have
S0454	no i'm serious
S0453	i would have explode with
S0454	be
S0453	it would have descend into
S0453	shout
S0454	be mentally ill so i would have leave that one
S0453	she be
S0454	myself

S0454	yeah
S0453	two thousand six hundred rial

S0454	it be
S0453	i'm not bother about that
S0454	it wasn't even all yours
S0453	i know
S0454	some of that be mine

S0454	i bring it here
S0453	i'll compensate you for it
S0454	but this be what i'm say assume money fix it it doesn't
S0453	okay it's the principle of the steal
S0454	i don't care it wasn't you who take it
S0453	yeah that's true
S0454	if you have take then you would have pay for it
S0453	yeah
S0454	it's the principle and therefore that you don't stand for it you don't stand up for yourself and you don't stand up for me and this be my home too
S0453	yeah you're right
S0454	and he's just wipe out a cupboard we know he have and we know him before he leave the house

S0454	i go to make to make you a cup of tea
S0453	it's when we discover it in the yeah then i find out
S0454	and then
S0453	but before
S0454	you say where be it and you say i've take it all and you say oh that's alright then it wasn't alright
S0453	mm you're right
S0454	he'd steal the whole cupboard
S0453	yeah you're right
S0454	he would he could have just ask and you would have always say yes
S0453	mm
S0454	of course you would have or can you just take those
S0453	yes
S0454	because that's actually 's and she might like a cup of that later
S0453	it it's probably indicative of his underlie dishonesty
S0454	yeah and your family friend be very disrespectful as well

S0454	erm yeah this be a weird couple that i've put about belittle me these i've lump together when i live in you introduce me to everyone we meet within or then as a teacher even though i be not a teacher at the time so that be very weird i didn't understand that that's like me introduce you as a completely different job
S0453	when you be a manager at
S0454	it be really patronise
S0453	sorry
S0454	it be like you want to put me down
S0453	no that's not i wasn't
S0454	and belittle me
S0453	no hang on no that
S0454	why would you change my job title
S0453	no it as more that the sector and the profession that that be what your
S0454	but why would you say i be a completely different job
S0453	okay well what i
S0454	i didn't teach then
S0453	i know that i know that but no no this this be that be okay go to have to strike it off the list because
S0454	why it's weird
S0453	no that be not a conscious effort on my part to
S0454	why do you do it then
S0453	because what be i gonna say a a a manager
S0454	what's wrong with that
S0453	i know mm
S0454	sorry what be wrong with that why would you change my job title completely
S0453	you you think it's some sort of erm you know
S0454	you want to put me down
S0453	chauvinistic
S0454	yeah it's really weird
S0453	that's not
S0454	cos
S0453	that's
S0454	why would you change someone's it's not like you change it a little bite like you know i'm a team leader of you know so i only teach sixteen hours as oppose to twenty it's not like that
S0453	yeah
S0454	i mean this be actually a job where i never teach there be no teach involve
S0453	no
S0454	that be really weird it be like you want to put me down
S0453	well i'm sorry that's not i wasn't i
S0454	and you do it not just once but lot of time
S0453	yeah but that no but that wasn't a that wasn't erm
S0454	it may not have be conscious but you do it
S0453	i know
S0454	a lot of time and i find it really really weird
S0453	well
S0454	like why do you want to change my job title
S0453	i never have that that
S0454	but you do
S0453	intention okay
S0454	and it's really odd
S0453	it be just easier than say manager
S0454	really odd why
S0453	a manager of what yeah
S0454	why be that easier teacher of what
S0453	true yeah you're right
S0454	odd very odd it's like okay so
S0453	maybe it's cos i know you as a teacher when i first meet you than i know be anyway i wouldn't er honestly that one
S0454	so yeah the next one i've put together belittle me and put me down for example over the job that's how i felt about that that you want to put me down
S0453	okay
S0454	okay so the next one erm be about generosity where i've say you be very generous financially too generous but that's a a compliment not a an insult not a bad thing but you never you're not generous with your time or help around
S0453	yes
S0454	around the house
S0453	that's true
S0454	for example you never do a weekly shop you very rarely do
S0453	never no that's not mm
S0454	we do it once at the begin in the first week together together and after that you never do it you very rarely cook and only then when i call you on it and say it wasn't fair er you never replace like the booze you take for friends then you say well i don't drink it
S0453	no but i do no not not never
S0454	but you make a point of take it
S0453	no never be extreme i do go buy a vodka i remember
S0454	yeah because i insist that time and i go on and on and on about it
S0453	oh yeah
S0454	didn't i
S0453	maybe i need some guidance
S0454	and you say if it's about the money do you want the money i say it's not about the money
S0453	it's about the principle of replace it
S0454	it's it's never about the money you be very generous financially i i would never argue with you about money
S0453	it's about the active replace
S0454	it's the that time and help can't be buy with money
S0453	it's true
S0454	you've take something and use it all i don't mind though the expectation be
S0453	you replace
S0454	you replace it why should i have to go and do it why should i have to do all of these things i'm not your housewife
S0453	this be true
S0454	and also that you take something of mine
S0453	this be true
S0454	so yeah you think that money can substitute for that it doesn't
S0453	and it can't
S0454	it can't and it's not
S0453	you're right
S0454	the same thing okay and next we're back to socialise er again i think of new ones you force conversations into other languages for example that time we meet at the bar you know the german one
S0453	yeah
S0454	by chance er without even
S0453	yeah
S0454	bother to check if it's okay with me and he felt really awkward and he be check with me and you just carry on regardless but you didn't think about me you think about you you want to practise
S0453	yeah
S0454	you didn't ask and it's not the only time
S0453	and it make you uncomfortable
S0454	it make me uncomfortable
S0453	i'm sorry
S0454	exclude me from conversations socially by for example talk about your work or sexual exploit prostitution etcetera i'm not gonna be able to join in with these things so you're gonna make me feel really awkward
S0453	like what where
S0454	talk about your work like with like you start talk about work straightaway so i wasn't able to join in for
S0453	yeah but a bite of that be
S0454	twenty minutes
S0453	but a bite of that we can't help
S0454	but no you need to be
S0453	we hadn't see each other for a long time
S0454	considerate who be in the room
S0453	i know
S0454	you can't just do that
S0453	yeah
S0454	you have to say to her oh i'm sorry this be really bore for let's talk about something else we'll talk about that later if that's okay with you
S0453	i think we do that
S0454	you didn't you talk about work
S0453	the whole time
S0454	no i'm just say for the twenty minutes i felt really awkward cos i have nothing to say
S0453	okay
S0454	and you make me feel really bad
S0453	sorry
S0454	and i have nowhere to go
S0453	i'm sorry
S0454	what could i have do walk out it would have look so rude
S0453	i'm sorry
S0454	or with guy talk about prostitution
S0453	yeah that be that be bad
S0454	for god's sake
S0453	that be bad that be only one occasion
S0454	that be horrible
S0453	it be only once
S0454	that be only once with him it's happen with other time with other people
S0453	like who like when
S0454	i don't remember it's happen with
S0453	that be about him talk about him well we both know that he do
S0454	look you do this okay
S0453	yeah alright that's only two occasion
S0454	talk about work no there's two that you remember
S0453	no the work the that's two in two years
S0454	no it's not there's more i just don't remember them all okay
S0453	well i don't remember them either
S0454	i'm just tell you i remember these specific occasion
S0453	okay
S0454	okay the next one we're off erm back to the begin one complain when i'm not at home when you get home and then expect me to change my plan even though you don't change your plan
S0453	yeah
S0454	like that's not fair like i'll be go on a walk and you'll say oh do you have to do that oh
S0453	yeah one side you're right
S0454	yeah and er isn't it good for me to go and see these people
S0453	it be good
S0454	inappropriate sexual contact in public well i've ask you not to do that like the kiss and the touch too much like it's different in the house but
S0453	well i didn't realise
S0454	not in the street
S0453	it bother you
S0454	it do only because we're in
S0453	yeah i know
S0454	it wouldn't bother me if we be in any other country
S0453	mm
S0454	er so the next one be all about sex imbalance in sexual favour it's eighty percent about you so of course you're very happy with that
S0453	no that's not true
S0454	isn't it
S0453	well it's not eighty percent
S0454	what percentage would you say
S0453	no
S0454	be it fifty fifty
S0453	it's definitely the majority for you it's more sixty forty
S0454	the majority for me
S0453	the er majority as in you you be erm the one deliver
S0454	mm
S0453	but sixty forty i'd say sixty forty maybe sixty five thirty five but not not eighty that's that's an exaggeration because i be always quite particular even if you know we be
S0454	i reckon it's more at least seventy
S0453	no i would no it's not
S0454	yeah
S0453	no let's bring it down to sixty five
S0454	no it's way imbalanced anyway and it's imbalance and you know that so
S0453	i think we both felt
S0454	you're happy
S0453	fulfil
S0454	and i'm sometimes happy that's not really great be it
S0453	i think you be really oh i think you really like it
S0454	oh i do but there's give and take
S0453	yeah
S0454	it's not just take
S0453	yeah
S0454	there be too much take er not experiment enough with sex not be interest in try
S0453	that's true
S0454	when i've try stuff so you're fine about it so therefore i must be not necessarily i might be bore
S0453	yeah
S0454	all about you again you're happy so you're fine
S0453	that's true
S0454	okay i'm i'm off that one erm refuse to listen this be er a general guy thing i think
S0453	yeah
S0454	most men would have this for example the windscreen wiper fiasco
S0453	no i mean
S0454	erm behave very patronisingly towards me at time like not listen just
S0453	yeah decide things
S0454	yeah it's patronise
S0453	it be
S0454	this be patronise like that you just decide to break up and not give me a chance to say anything just disappear
S0453	well it do happen
S0454	er be inflexible we talk about this one ourselves before
S0453	yeah
S0454	be inflexible with your gym football schedule but expect me to change mine for yours so general inflexibility with that and we we mention that erm okay relatives and family and friends now not take care of your relatives when they come to stay except financially which you're very good at erm
S0453	like when

S0453	he he would keep lie all the way
S0454	go to wouldn't matter he need to be tell
S0453	and he wouldn't
S0454	and you'd feel better for it yourself
S0453	he wouldn't accept he wouldn't accept
S0454	doesn't matter if he accept it you know
S0453	mm
S0454	he know deep down it's right invite your relative to stay longer than agree er and either not ask and or not ask at all like your grandfather's second visit

S0454	i live here and you're not even look after him when you're when he's here so
S0453	mm that's true
S0454	that wasn't fair
S0453	the second the second visit be pointless
S0454	it be pointless cos you weren't prepare to
S0453	spend time with him
S0454	spend time with him so then
S0453	and i don't want him
S0454	he felt bad
S0453	and then when we talk to each other on the phone it's like he he you know he ask me if if i could sort out a visa for him to visit i don't wanna i don't wanna host him because i love the guy to bits
S0454	yeah but you've

S0453	i don't wanna have him over
S0454	mm i don't think you can do that entirely he be your grandfather he's not gonna be around forever
S0453	i know he's not but
S0454	he's not gonna be able to fly forever
S0453	exactly
S0454	so six every six months you can have him for two weeks
S0453	yeah but that's not how it work
S0454	you don't have him for longer
S0453	cos he get a visa for three months
S0454	mm
S0453	and then he spend time with my uncle and then i have to see my well that's the other thing i've promise be that i'm not gonna set foot in that house again

S0454	and put the bag right outside the door and then say sorry i've get to run
S0453	yeah
S0454	tell your grandfather before you go in that's what you're do
S0453	yeah
S0454	so he's not shock
S0453	yeah
S0454	okay anyway this erm about relatives that's finish
S0453	mm
S0454	disrespect my friends like and make no effort to get on with her except once when she invite you round to her house you be actually very rude about her in the past
S0453	er
S0454	that wasn't very nice
S0453	i know we just didn't get on
S0454	but you still don't have to call her a slut
S0453	i didn't call her a slut
S0454	you do
S0453	okay sorry
S0454	and some other nasty word which
S0453	sorry
S0454	be unpleasant so no wonder she doesn't like you she know not that i tell her of course but she's a woman this one i think be a big one make unilateral decisions in relationships for example break up blah blah blah blah blah
S0453	break up break up i can't accept because that
S0454	it be unilateral
S0453	it happen
S0454	this be the problem
S0453	i know but it happen
S0454	no but we don't make unilateral decisions
S0453	when you
S0454	you discuss it
S0453	when you leave be it be it not unilateral
S0454	that we talk it through and i didn't run away and i give him plenty of opportunity to respond over the next two weeks i didn't go anywhere er then i say i have to go i'm gonna be look for somewhere to move he have lot of time to talk it through with me lot of chance to respond he have that right
S0453	mm
S0454	and he might not be able to the second i tell him he be so upset
S0453	yeah that's true
S0454	so you know he need a bite of time you can't just say oh oh
S0453	yeah yeah
S0454	well what do you think
S0453	next
S0454	what do you think next
S0453	yeah that's true
S0454	run away this be relate run away instead of face up to things
S0453	no i won't
S0454	this be the first time in this whole breakup that you've come here of your own volition and sit down and talk about it so that's good you've do this but kind of two weeks too late you should have do this two weeks ago
S0453	yeah
S0454	agree to something then change your mind and blame me twenty four hours later
S0453	sorry
S0454	take responsibility for yourself
S0453	yeah for sure
S0454	don't blame me it wasn't true then yeah this be get a bite nastier now general weakness of mind this be like the thirty change your mind and blame me er paranoia
S0453	yeah i be a bite
S0454	like i'm see other people that i have relationship with people that i haven't tell you about an overreaction like if you don't know where i be every second
S0454	like think the worst like not that it's an accident's happen but think
S0453	possessive
S0454	oh you know she's off with someone
S0453	yeah
S0454	so that's very odd it's a weakness of character and you need to address it
S0453	i do
S0454	need your boss to fulfil your father role
S0453	yeah
S0454	and we've discuss that before
S0453	that's cos i've have a shit i have a shit a a shit dad but i can't believe you've
S0454	but it's not help you're an adult
S0453	of course
S0454	you're an adult you don't need a father like that any more
S0453	you're right
S0454	avoid all responsibility except financial and assume money make up for it it doesn't like with your grandfather you you need to be responsible and spend time with him
S0453	yeah
S0454	you didn't you assume
S0453	i mean i felt he be piss off and he leave early
S0454	if you pay for everything yeah that it be okay it's not okay
S0453	no
S0454	he didn't come because he's try to get freebies from you
S0453	no
S0454	any reasonable person wouldn't do that
S0453	yeah
S0454	and he's a nice person and
S0453	yeah
S0454	you make him feel bad
S0453	yeah that's true
S0454	that's just one example
S0453	yeah that's true
S0454	avoid difficult conversations er or work at things dishonesty as a result for example with me do you still wanna keep go
S0453	yeah
S0454	moan all the time about work your job not like it but not do anything about it because you're either too lazy or just obsess with the a salary it's not because you particularly like this place move on leave you don't like it

S0454	and you think cos i'm not cry er and sit around bawl my eye out and talk about it all the time
S0453	that it's not
S0454	people cope about with these things in different ways
S0453	yeah
S0454	and one of the ways that i've cop be by shut myself away more than i would normally
S0453	you mean about
S0454	there's be a cancer scare for me
S0453	yeah
S0454	stress move here without a job like i get that sort that yeah it's be stressful that one's a big one another big one arrogance you assume you're better and more successful than other people base on shallow indicators i mean like your job and money they're only two indicators of success there be plenty of others which be maybe better happiness happy family life fulfil relationships be honest be open about what you want know what you want
S0453	yeah
S0454	there be other things that measure success not that those things be bad but they're just two of a big range
S0453	more profound things
S0454	yeah so your family this be one star be lazy a lot of them spongers
S0453	mm
S0454	often mentally ill abusive some of them or weak the two tend to go together and you want me to spend time with them you know that be a big ask that be a big ask
S0453	with who okay
S0454	anyone anyone god
S0453	mm
S0454	look at them i mean look at that ridiculous charade it be worse than a soap opera your sister's behaviour
S0453	oh i'm sorry
S0454	you couldn't even put that on tv
S0453	it be
S0454	i mean you wouldn't be able to sell a soap opera with that kind of behaviour
S0453	it be awful
S0454	yeah you know it be awful and your mum doesn't do anything instead
S0453	no she do she tell her before they travel here she tell her don't you dare talk to when when you get there cos she know
S0454	but she didn't do anything
S0453	yeah
S0454	while she be here
S0453	yeah
S0454	so you know i just walk into that off a flight and

S0454	yeah it be terrible and i mean i don't want to spend time with people like that
S0453	no
S0454	awful
S0453	yeah
S0454	er your disapproval over alcohol and eat brunch mean that social life have be a lot more bore than i'd want and you've be more control
S0453	mm
S0454	it's be about you do it your way and i
S0453	it's true
S0454	that would have be a lot happier the next ones i've put big star for cos we're on the last page you're a quitter not a fighter you be more afraid of have a difficult conversation than lose someone you claim to love that still hold true you're selfish you ask me to move to once you get a new job yet you'd have never do that to me and you can't even be bother to consult me about big decisions like job applications abroad or break up with me you don't consult you inform er if you even bother to do that
S0453	you're right
S0454	you inform once you're ask outright that's not fair
S0453	no i be gonna inform you anyway but
S0454	at some point
S0453	no yeah i be gonna inform you and i have a date in mind i have a week before you be gonna go but i realise now
S0454	it's not good enough
S0453	that that be yeah that be that be actually a mistake and erm
S0454	you're emotionally illiterate you be unable to see things from others' perspectives
S0453	it's true
S0454	example you think i'm jealous of friends like when actually i just think she's a complete bitch
S0453	mm
S0454	ditto your other friends who don't always have your best interest at heart not all of them but some of them doesn't have your best interest at heart you assume i'm jealous of her
S0453	mm
S0454	i just know she doesn't have your best interest at heart like what she say about you at the opera house that time that make me realise
S0453	you didn't tell me then
S0454	i tell you saw her
S0453	i just remember that you come back after that event and say yeah i don't not sure i like her or something like that
S0454	yeah this be why
S0453	i didn't you didn't you should
S0454	i say she say something about you and you say what and i just kind of say a little bite of what she say
S0453	you didn't say
S0454	but i didn't tell you about the the usp thing and you know
S0453	what's the usp
S0454	just really undermine you unique sell point
S0453	yeah
S0454	that she say basically the only reason you've get a job at all be cos you speak arabic
S0453	even though
S0454	not because you're actually
S0453	even though ninety
S0454	any good at your job
S0453	even though ninety eight percent of my job doesn't involve any arabic
S0454	of course she's just jealous
S0453	mm
S0454	and therefore you wouldn't be able to get one at home because you don't have a a sell point any more whereas she have
S0453	what a what a cow
S0454	yeah really er and then i the this one not a star i mention it before though i hate it when you text in bed for example right after sex or even during
S0453	mm okay
S0454	like answer the phone you make me feel really cheap then you complain when i ask what who or why you're texting that's why it's rude
S0453	mm
S0454	er and the last one three star you string me along for six months and still be today and i can't decide be this a control thing or do you be just completely indecisive either way it's not good enough

S0454	how much be it there
S0453	two hundred and fifty eight dirham a night
S0454	yeah that's quite a lot
S0453	no that's actually quite it's extremely reasonable it's the corporate rate and i work out that over the course of the year it's ninety four thousand dirham
S0454	yeah my my colleague be say that
S0453	it's twenty
S0454	he's actually say
S0453	yeah
S0454	he when his lease be up on the flat
S0453	that's what i'm gonna do
S0454	he's gonna go and live in a hotel apartment
S0453	that's what i'm gonna do
S0454	because you can get them for as little as five thousand a month and he say my rent's way more than that
S0453	yeah that's what i'm gonna do
S0454	and it include all the bill and internet
S0453	yeah
S0454	and sometimes a five star hotel
S0453	it's five star quality almost er the room
S0454	yeah
S0453	there's wi fi
S0454	yeah
S0453	there's tv satellite tv i work out that in rent alone
S0454	mm
S0453	cos here i pay one one five
S0454	yeah it's probably cheaper for them
S0453	here i pay ninety four it's twenty plus thousand dirham cheaper that's
S0454	it's madness isn't it
S0453	two thousand rial a year but that doesn't include the save that i'd make on bill i pay
S0454	but be you include the tax be there a ten plus six tax there
S0453	mm none there's no tax
S0454	be you sure
S0453	yeah yeah
S0454	cos there's normally a ten percent and a six percent on hotels here
S0453	mm yeah well
S0454	you'd better check that
S0453	let me work it out well because two five eight time seven days it come to one thousand eight hundred and something be what i pay but let me just see what the tax be
S0454	but yeah that's what he be say he's do the maths and it be way cheaper to live in a
S0453	hotel apartment
S0454	hotel apartment he could go and live in the and use the gym and the facilities there every day and it's just over five thousand a month five thousand one hundred
S0453	wow that's really good
S0454	yeah you know the ones where your dad stay
S0453	maybe i need to look into that the ones on the side yeah
S0454	yeah it he say they
S0453	maybe i need to look into that
S0454	weren't great they be very
S0453	yeah
S0454	basic
S0453	my dad say that or the guy
S0454	no he say i mean we saw them remember
S0453	yeah
S0454	cos it's not really a kitchen you have there but the facilities be amaze
S0453	yeah two five eight
S0454	and he say
S0453	time
S0454	there isn't really wi fi in the room there
S0453	no
S0454	but there's wi fi in all the public areas
S0453	no tax that's the two five eight include the tax and everything
S0454	yeah that's good
S0453	it be good so it's ninety four thousand it's over twenty thousand dirham cheaper a year
S0454	yeah madness
S0453	and and it's then when you start count things like electricity and water bill
S0454	exactly
S0453	and internet and tv bill which be four hundred and
S0454	yeah it's not cheap
S0453	fifty dirham a month or something insane
S0454	yeah
S0453	it's it's actually more like thirty thousand
S0454	yeah
S0453	and things like cleaner cost
S0454	and then you wouldn't need to pay for the gym
S0453	cleaner cost they clean every day

S0454	it's so horrible even though i've get that awful commute in the morning
S0453	yeah
S0454	at least you can have a bite of a life
S0453	it what you could do be live near campus that wouldn't be a bad idea

S0454	yeah
S0453	that's not far from there
S0454	it's true
S0453	where you don't have a commute effectively
S0454	yeah
S0453	you just walk there and get in on
S0454	that's right
S0453	get on the bus
S0454	that would be nice
S0453	but the trouble be the noise like where i be i'm on the eleventh floor but it's noisy
