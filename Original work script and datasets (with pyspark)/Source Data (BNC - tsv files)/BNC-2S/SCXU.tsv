S0179	well we're normally on sixty two so whether that's actually it because i think that's a lot of that's well mostly commute drive that's pretty damn good
S0058	yes yeah okay er so i'll put it on shuffle excellent
S0179	wait roundabout
S0058	excellent nice cheery song for a saturday morning
S0179	yes indeed i hadn't enough room to get ahead of that lorry before he get in there so i'll make that
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	strategic
S0058	ah ha very good
S0179	i will quite happily undertake on this section because i'm not actually in contact with the road
S0058	yeah yeah sort of a separate bite
S0179	exactly so i can now relax so it's with careful plan i've actually manage to get into four in under twenty second
S0058	pretty good that
S0179	yeah
S0058	nice one
S0179	maybe i'm bore oh i'm sorry i now won't car jack you
S0058	yeah i won't ram into the back of you then never understand those
S0179	the thing be though generally use by appal drivers
S0058	yeah no exactly yeah i'm go to stick stick a sign in so
S0179	people sort of would would tail gate you themselves be it not for
S0058	yeah i'm go to stick a sign in the back to yeah so that i don't have to worry about how i'm drive so that you'll just stay away from me you know what i mean they're just
S0179	no no what i mean be that the people they're worry that other drivers be like themselves
S0058	yes yeah i mean yes like so there's one that we just drive past on the leave there say grandchildren on board and that's a bite different because that's kind of more of a joke like
S0179	yeah but that's a joke because of the other ones
S0058	yeah exactly that's what i mean so like dad's taxi in the back be different whereas yeah just have a baby on board keep your distance
S0179	the one that really annoy me little princess on board
S0058	ah ah well be she a princess be she actually the you know the daughter of the rule family no she's not so shut up
S0179	be they
S0058	be she little or be she obese be honest
S0179	what i be think more along the line of erm ones be that so what be you do about this so instead of take advance drive lessons or you know look to improve your road safety you put this you put a sticker in the back of a car
S0058	yeah or pick a very safe vehicle or yeah it's the er low cost low effort option to keep your kid safe
S0179	well no it's the
S0058	give the responsibility to other people you can imagine in court can't you well i have a sign in the back isn't it hazy
S0179	yeah still a nice day
S0058	oh no definitely well it i think it's like that you know if we get up on a morning it's really foggy it often turn into the nicest day
S0179	yeah hazy i'd still love to be out run
S0058	i think well you will be soon
S0179	maybe tomorrow we'll see i'll do some more stretch today
S0058	yeah i be go to say if you erm and you can er yeah these stretch will
S0179	i'm still go to be of that parallel park
S0058	yeah it be good stuff
S0179	so it be a tiny space up a hill and a really bad angle
S0058	you do it first time
S0179	i'll get over this i like a bite of variety
S0058	bite of shuffle
S0179	yeah
S0058	we can do a bite of shuffle on mine and on the last bite if you want
S0179	yeah
S0058	bite more of a mix bag
S0179	that's in shuffle of no mine be more of a mix bag
S0058	no i just mean erm like oh how do you audio we could have get in trouble it come with a chapter of brideshead
S0179	oh it shouldn't do erm there's a section on itunes for if you go to options you can put exclude from shuffle
S0058	yeah that's yeah yeah i must do that
S0179	so i'm do it on my christmas music for example
S0058	yeah i'll have to do that with er with that
S0179	well also unusually for all your it save from location if you just get the
S0058	yes
S0179	if you could get all albums to do that
S0058	can you
S0179	yeah
S0058	oh right cool i know that it would be quite as relevant because you wouldn't really want to come in half way through a song in the same way
S0179	yeah exactly that's why it's a default not to
S0058	yeah oh it's interest cos that's cos that's quite an old fashion way of look at music cos that's how a tape work but not
S0179	yeah
S0058	have a record or a cd work so it's not that old fashion just yet slightly unusual i use to love my tap
S0179	you see when i first get a dvd i be really disconcert because it didn't save your place
S0058	yeah yeah in some ways yeah videos be better for that cos it be a bite of a pain if you watch a film one night and then go back to it
S0179	but then of course you do have to be to it
S0058	yeah the thing be you you be i think this be the difference between us as children you rewound it when you be finish with it
S0179	yep
S0058	we rewound it when we want to watch it
S0179	yep
S0058	but if you watch something and you've get half way through you know and you
S0179	yeah you leave it then obviously
S0058	yeah
S0179	once you've finish you rewind it
S0058	huh ah bless
S0179	ah jesus i think that car's long
S0058	yeah hang on
S0179	oi
S0058	nice
S0179	i've never see a hummer range rover before
S0058	a limo really
S0179	sorry a limo range rover yes
S0058	ah it's the same
S0179	it be just crazy i think in the back that's a range rover
S0058	yeah and then it just carry on
S0179	i be like i be like well
S0058	it be like a weird perspective thing
S0179	yeah exactly
S0058	you can see the front and the back but the gap in between be bigger than you think
S0179	that must be a custom job
S0058	mm stretch it car stretcher machine
S0179	yes to be fair what i'd like to be do now be in an open top car through scotland rather than of the m25
S0058	yeah but you know
S0179	however need must
S0058	yeah it's fair to say and you wouldn't really want an open top car on the m25 necessarily
S0179	erm i wouldn't object to one
S0058	no okay i wonder if 's well enough to be er drive in the open top car yet
S0179	but if not we can borrow it
S0058	you're always think but er yeah
S0179	it's only a two seater though
S0058	it be
S0179	i think like i can just imagine see seventy top down four people in it imagine how much fun that would be just cruise
S0058	that's pretty cool just cruise yeah we'd all have to tap our finger and nod our head on the side of the car
S0179	some beers maybe
S0058	some beers i'll put music on some beers i can offer you shall we book then
S0179	erm i'm tempt i just with no cost
S0058	yeah and no cost in term of leave
S0179	yeah
S0058	which be quite valuable cos then at the end of the year we could have a couple days off before christmas or and you know and just have a bite more leeway with it
S0179	yeah i mean i'm against the idea of save up lot of leave for the follow year purely cos i think you don't
S0058	yeah just you just roll it over you would never use it
S0179	yeah
S0058	but it's nice to have it so that
S0179	that's my instinct to save it all as long as possible but then you would never take it
S0058	yeah no exactly i think it's important for us to remember to take leave but and maybe more importantly to remember to take holiday which be a key thing so
S0179	yeah well i think i'd get i'm more keen to not just use up leave as odd days here and there i'm keen to use it i mean
S0058	as proper break yeah
S0179	yeah
S0058	but if we do need
S0179	maybe we can go to alton tower one day say but
S0058	yeah yeah exactly i mean that kind of thing would be fun and i mean it's always i wouldn't mind just have a you know random day off go to london or something we could go to a matinee or you know erm but yeah or all the time i mean don't just use it in dribs and drabs
S0179	but then you don't properly relax i mean i'd be tempt possibly from a perspective to take a week off and just spend it around home just do things
S0058	yeah no exactly yeah i mean i think yeah there's definitely advantage just to have a bite of time off but yeah i think erm if we can have a holiday without use any it would make sense i mean we could take a day an extra day off but i'm not sure necessarily and we could have the thursday off and drive up to my parent's kind of thursday morning or wednesday night even erm and have longer there but i'm not sure if it's necessarily worth it
S0179	well i don't know it might make it seem more relax but yeah i agree for the moment i'm tempt not to do that
S0058	yeah i mean i think i could probably say that quite short notice at work erm i don't have anything that week i don't think so
S0179	that car look weird
S0058	what the schirokko
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah it do a bite
S0179	i think it be schirokko
S0058	i would say i would say say schirokko but it might be schirokko i don't know erm i haven't hear anyone say it apart from me so
S0179	okay
S0058	i don't know i haven't be on any car website in a while but erm yeah we should and do you want to ring them tonight or if you've get the number we could ring them
S0179	i'll do it from the car
S0058	from the car yeah or when we get there even
S0179	yeah we could
S0058	your mum seem determine that we go
S0179	i know i'm not sure we've get a lot of choice
S0058	really keen yeah yeah i mean i think that you know sound like a really nice plan if we take the erm the recipe book and we take the erm yeah and basically you have the hot tub and the recipe book and just yeah chill out watch film read walk about
S0179	champagne
S0058	champagne in the hot tub bite of that
S0179	lie in
S0058	pardon
S0179	lie in
S0058	lie in yeah sound pretty good to me live tv
S0179	yes
S0058	that will be nice
S0179	board game
S0058	board game
S0058	yeah and erm just yeah
S0179	maybe pop down the gym and do some weight
S0058	yeah just chill out i think that sound like quite a nice plan
S0179	no that sound a great plan
S0058	cool let's do that and we could maybe see our parent which will be nice
S0179	or we could consider to have them over
S0058	yeah i'll mention that to them
S0179	it's not that far if they can consider to join us for say a day if they want to
S0058	no yeah they could come over on the saturday whatever and just yeah yeah like i say i'll have to see what they're do with regard to erm when they have to back but yeah
S0179	another think be ah oh no we could cos the gym's get weird now isn't it the old gym that you can't just go in for like ten quid per session
S0058	what yeah it's erm you mean the hotel
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah it's fifteen for it's all day all the facilities for fifteen quid which make sense if you're go to be in there all day but it doesn't make sense if you just want to go down and faff about
S0179	oh well
S0058	yeah it's a shame but never mind they might change that i mean or we could make a case to them we could write to them and say
S0179	no that won't do bugger all because they're a national chain hotels do you know what i mean
S0058	no okay yeah i know but i don't think i think they do have some kind of autonomous individual deal and things like that i think they do make their own
S0179	okay
S0058	and through the website that's the impression i get and they sort of the way they market be very specific to the hotel so they might be able to alter price there's no harm in send them an email say we will literally never come in if you make it five pound to go in just in the pool for a pound an hour we'll come in
S0179	yeah
S0058	you know no harm in do that
S0179	bite difficult for them to regulate that
S0058	yeah true
S0179	so dad like the new gym
S0058	but they can't
S0058	and and he like
S0179	yeah
S0058	good he seem to be quite into it
S0179	yeah
S0058	what's a wall angel i i be ask you both of you for like a five minutes last night and nobody tell me
S0179	sorry erm i didn't hear that
S0058	yeah i be go what's the wall angel and then you carry on talk and i be like what's the wall angel
S0179	i'll show you in if you want
S0058	okay i'm imagine it involve a wall but that's as far as i've get
S0179	who's sing this
S0058	can't remember be it the cover or be it the original
S0179	oh no it's from the er er cd
S0058	yeah
S0179	erm what be i say erm yeah i've never see dad so happy i don't think what with him enjoy himself so much
S0058	what last night he be enjoy himself he be plaster
S0179	not to start with and didn't really change throughout the even
S0058	no no no true
S0179	but we i can't believe
S0058	so bad
S0179	that be ridiculous
S0058	oh my word so bad your mum be mortify i leave to go to the toilet do he get a tell off
S0179	no
S0058	huh oh your poor mother
S0179	i think retirement suit him
S0058	yes i think he do
S0179	i think it's a combination of but he's now retire and very very relax
S0058	yeah
S0179	and the fact that we no longer live together and you two get on very well
S0058	yes yeah he's relax and yeah you don't have to get on each other's nerve
S0179	exactly
S0058	dearie me the dog be very please to see us i think
S0179	i think it's it's nearest to the ideal if we just pop up occasionally
S0058	yes i think he's get better at just go oh they're here this be excite and they're go to go now and that's alright and you know
S0179	i'm go to so there
S0058	yeah i mean do you think he recognise the name because he be it be sort of be say quite a bite and it i do wonder if if he sort of link that or whether he's not quite or whether he know he's go away but in he but it's not the word maybe it's more that pack that he understand the visual
S0179	possibly but he still doesn't want to get into a car
S0058	no yeah he hasn't make that link yet maybe with dog it's what's immediately happen that's important and that the kind of expectation of long term
S0179	mm no but then that but that wouldn't work because so when you're pack box like that's what's immediately happen that's what's happen the next day
S0058	true yeah so he do know that so i mean maybe he just really really hat be in the car so much that it's never worth it
S0179	possibly
S0058	in his head it's never worth it and then he get there and go no it's alright really he's always a very happy dog when he get there
S0179	next door's baby sound lovely though
S0058	your mum's like obsess with her baby
S0179	yeah it's scary isn't it
S0058	it will go miss and she'll be like shh but yeah erm it do sound lovely very nice you get baby like that though which be just really nice well you know have a good nature and be quiet
S0179	she's right though she doesn't sort of like make a thing about children
S0058	well i'm
S0179	i think we have a very common attitude to children like some baby i find actually that's quite cute most of them be like yeah you're just a bite smelly aren't you
S0058	but a bite too small really aren't you
S0179	the thing that really annoy me be like it's unacceptable to take a dog into a restaurant but acceptable to tale a baby in
S0058	yeah
S0179	my dog's far more hygienic than a baby
S0058	yeah and better behave
S0179	yeah
S0058	it depend on the dog but then if you have sort of
S0179	it will lie under the table and be quiet
S0058	yeah sandy do just lie quietly erm whereas a baby be cry or whatever it will be much much more of a disruption but i guess it's easier to have a blanket rule and they've just sort of do it that way round rather than say you know but some place do say well behave dog welcome though and i imagine they would if your dog be run around bark they would say get out
S0179	yeah but i think sandy would very useful in just an exam hall so many people to go and see
S0058	so useful
S0179	yeah
S0058	i think he'd really enjoy it lot's of new people and they'd be lot of things he could sort of help with because they'd all be stress so he could and help them out
S0179	exactly yeah it would literally a question like who's the most stress here
S0058	yeah do you think he'd be able to smell who be the most stress
S0179	possibly yes
S0058	it's interest isn't it
S0179	he's very good at pick up on that
S0058	he's extremely good yeah it's interest how a nose can do something that we just really can't that you know they're just superior do you know what i mean
S0179	well he can also sniff out drug a lot more effectively than you can
S0058	yeah well exactly that's what i mean there's so many areas where the a dog be just better than a human at do things even in top human areas like yeah sort of fear and emotion and things and yeah worry and like that kind of thing that in fact a dog be better than a human in know how you're feel i think be just
S0179	or better about do something about it which be always what amuse me
S0058	yes yeah he know what to do huh nice excuse me
S0179	er what be i talk about
S0058	but erm talk about sandy and dog and how much he understand and go away to
S0179	oh yes about just about dad and enjoy last night
S0058	oh yes enjoy last night yeah i really enjoy my meal though i think i think it be a very pleasant er restaurant experience
S0179	yes none of my course be outstanding
S0058	yeah
S0179	dessert be the best bite
S0058	yeah
S0179	like the starter be a bite sort of
S0058	i i be so hungry though that i didn't really you have bruschetta didn't you
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah my starter be fine it be you know wasn't particularly special i mean cos
S0179	i mean that be my only comment it be fine the main course again
S0058	my main course be lovely but i think you maybe yours be maybe more standard
S0179	but no it's just a bite the pizza be just a bite dry
S0058	oh it's a shame
S0179	it be like a pizza base with the ingredients throw on top it wasn't really put together
S0058	right yeah
S0179	like the food in pizza express be several notch above that
S0058	right okay an oven yeah i mean it pizza express pizza's great but then if you if you know like i do like pasta and that be really very good pasta
S0179	okay
S0058	erm i've never have anything quite like that it be really really well put together so
S0179	i mean maybe i should think more creatively about what i have next time up there
S0058	yeah
S0179	cos i mean that's the thing you know er if it's you do love it i think the food be exceptional in there
S0058	it's really good yeah
S0179	yeah
S0058	oh i be think actually erm when we get back tonight do you want to pop into morrisons on the way back and get some interest for tea as in there isn't there isn't anything else so
S0179	i be actually think of possibly go to the cinema at the on the way home because we're go to be literally underneath it
S0058	yeah we could do
S0179	er so it might be fun
S0058	what and
S0179	cos the alternative be to go back by the m11 but i think that will be slower
S0058	be we go to see a film or just get some food or
S0179	i say go to the cinema
S0058	yeah
S0179	yeah i originally well just for in general oh just see a film you say
S0058	yeah
S0179	right erm
S0058	just literally go and see a film or go and have some food or i mean in some ways it might be nice to get back seem as we've sort of be out but
S0179	i don't know it just seem like quite a nice sort of chance to round off the day a little bite
S0058	yeah okay well well be there anything on
S0179	i'm not sure
S0058	i'm not i'm not sure what's out at the minute
S0179	i be go to check this morning but we didn't really have time
S0058	yeah i don't know sure what's out erm i watch the erm the first episode well first half of the first episode of the apprentice at work at lunchtime
S0179	right
S0058	and erm they use the music from the artist for one of the task and it just really annoy me such wonderful music from such an amaze film and they've get it accompany the
S0179	the what that rancid shit
S0058	what
S0179	the apprentice
S0058	the apprentice it's really bad yeah but you see why i like it it's really bad i mean it's embarrass for them like but they're mean to be you know i be the best at business and they're say things and you just think oh my goodness to me do you be you really this bad like genuinely
S0179	like what
S0058	well just the way they approach
S0179	problems
S0058	yeah like this this the first task there be sixteen people so you didn't really get to know them terribly well as individuals but erm the erm task be they have to buy sort of like completely blank items and put a design on them and sell them
S0179	right
S0058	erm and make a they they team that make the most profit win simple as that
S0179	well my solution would be i'm go to accept all of us now to work at our regular job for this period of time
S0058	huh yeah
S0179	and we'll earn far more money
S0058	i don't think you'd win the apprentice that way but yeah good think erm but yeah so the guy could they they be sort of worry about the figure
S0179	well it's a pointless task because cos they'll either know nothing about they don't have to be on the it's just not go to work
S0058	oh yeah yeah well entirely pointless yeah but i mean the the the sort of the there be sort of girls versus boys and the boys erm decide to buy these teddy bear and just stick a union jack on the t shirt and sell it sell it to tourists bore and the other one they make these
S0179	probably quite effective
S0058	well they want to sell them for fifteen quid for these tiny little teddy bear and it's like oh that's not go to work erm and the other one they have the word this be a and they're like a red phone box
S0179	right
S0058	i'm sorry no it be a bus i think it be a bus yeah a girl and the bus and this a bus and it be like well that doesn't mean anything what do that what what
S0179	yeah but many things don't mean anything
S0058	yeah i know but it be just a ridiculously bad and they print them really badly as well there be just yeah it's embarrass
S0179	that's a very small door
S0058	yeah a bus for slow people it's quite bizarre be that just a door that they can
S0179	i think so
S0058	how bizarre it's kind of weird only have one bike you'd think
S0179	the others could be inside
S0058	true yeah
S0179	that's obviously quite an expensive bike
S0058	mm
S0179	if you have a look at it
S0058	yeah the wheel look quite different i need to get some oil for my bike actually it's erm it's very the sort of the chain need er need some oil on it
S0179	it say caution on the back
S0058	leave hand drive
S0179	oh
S0058	ah
S0179	english and
S0058	english registration but how bizarre mind you there be only the one guy in there maybe he's go away by himself with his fancy bike and his motor home
S0179	maybe
S0058	you never know nice that golf that's hang on the back erm a bite bash up and it have you know the monster energy drink symbol
S0179	yeah
S0058	it have like a sticker of that on the petrol cover thing
S0179	how unfortunate
S0058	yeah don't put monster energy in it that's why it's break
S0179	ha
S0058	oh dearie me what be we just talk about oh the apprentice oh embarrass really embarrass some of the things they say though some of the things they come out with like i i be watch this the last series at the same time that i be go to job interview and i be like if i say that in a job interview they would laugh at me and throw me out for be ridiculous
S0179	like what
S0058	well just the some of the cliché they come out with and i'm try to think of a good example of one
S0179	they do select idiots for that
S0058	yeah well yeah exactly it's for entertainment purely erm none of them be any good
S0179	but in effect they don't realise this be the thing
S0058	yeah exactly they think they're really the best business mind the best business mind in the country and you're like well blatantly you're not so i mean yeah so the boys with this union jack on the teddy be like yeah i think that's really quite different that's quite that's quite quirky and unusual i be like since when erm and yeah just not think about the the girls be add up the figure once they'd already buy everything and it's like this couldn't you know really shockingly bad and i know i'm not exactly business mind but er very good television though
S0179	mm
S0058	not as good as masterchef because masterchef they don't bother with sort of it's not really about the personalities so much it's about cook and they do just cook for a long time in in different situations but they fundamentally spend an hour show you their cook which be quite nice you know it's interest whereas the apprentice just show it's an hour of them run around like headless chickens be pathetic
S0179	what be it hitler's chickens
S0058	hit list yeah
S0179	no hitler's
S0058	oh hitler's chickens i'm not sure if hitler keep chickens but i'm sure if he do they'd be er very regiment and white good egg layer
S0179	look how we now gain three lanes
S0058	yeah
S0179	it's weird fundamentally the most dangerous to put low fly aircraft next to a road
S0058	yeah very low fly aircraft next to a road
S0179	however
S0058	they obviously think you know whenever it's age since i've fly
S0179	you can always fly dear
S0058	ah bless yeah the last time i fly be i think i go to dublin in first year yeah that would have be the last time
S0179	i really don't want to go home and work again
S0058	yeah crazy
S0179	that's something i'm gonna bring up in my cos if i've now get quite a lot of things i actually want to talk about in my er appraisal
S0058	well that's great i mean go in with things to to bring up
S0179	yes
S0058	like it show you've think about it so be you go to talk about
S0179	as in what i'm do more or less be have a project to work on and have something sort of i don't know i feel like i've get little bits of things
S0058	right yeah
S0179	i also think i've possible the last month or so i think i've be quite tire
S0058	okay
S0179	and it's difficult therefore to put any enthusiasm into it which make it worse
S0058	yeah
S0179	erm it's a little bite self reinforce
S0058	yeah
S0179	but and i've get i love have cos in my first three months i be there i have quite a few client meet
S0058	yes
S0179	so at least i saw clients and i go to client sit
S0058	yeah
S0179	and i really enjoy that and i haven't do that since
S0058	right
S0179	and cos i find like bizarrely bizarrely i find sort of monthly team meet really interest and really motivational
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	and i can see what i'm do in the wider context
S0058	yes definitely
S0179	and i've have less of that which have be de motivate
S0058	okay so so you'd really yeah i mean you could say you'd really like to spend more time in client meet and meet and things and yeah that you'd like more of a project yeah more more have a project to work on yeah erm definitely worth bring up and i think i mean i guess everyone want to travel for work so
S0179	well no not really erm the more you do the less you like it apparently
S0058	true well i guess you get sick of it
S0179	well you see i actually love airports for their own sake
S0058	yeah well it's all nicely neat and self contain and
S0179	you see most people hate drive to work and i still love it
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	i actively enjoy the process
S0058	well yeah maybe worth mention then that you like travel and okay erm well that sound good do you know when it be yet have you get a date
S0179	er yeah i think so bizarrely it's the end of april
S0058	okay
S0179	which be interest in fact because i always assume you call it financial year end but er apparently not
S0058	mm okay
S0179	oh well we'll see
S0058	yeah so well it will be a good chance and yeah erm bring up everything i guess
S0179	yes i intend to
S0058	make a list yeah i get erm nice it never occur to me before this be five four
S0179	what
S0058	this music the time signature be really unusual as in it's five beat in a bar which be very unusual but that's why it sound so kind of odd but that bite isn't
S0179	ah
S0058	so that's why it sound it that it kind of yeah that's just normal but the erm the other bite be it's get an extra beat it's get a beat too many
S0179	right
S0058	so which be why it sound excite and sort of make you feel a little bite it's clever how music work like that it's very difficult to make a piece work in alter the time signature because people sort of you know what's happen i i can't clap to this but you can this be just so iconic it work
S0179	well it wouldn't always have be iconic
S0058	hmm
S0179	it wasn't always have be iconic
S0058	no i guess it work first and then it become iconic so people know it but erm
S0179	i wouldn't mind watch mission impossible twoi
S0058	erm i think i've see that one
S0179	i like bits of it almost in spite of it
S0058	i'm not sure be this the one where i watch it at the end i turn to you i be like i don't understand and you be like it's fine
S0179	no that's mission impossible one
S0058	that's mission yeah oh that be it i turn to you and i be like er story please explain
S0179	er mask and a train
S0058	oh god yeah
S0179	and that's well two things firstly that's why you should do a shoulder check before start to move rather than as you're start to move
S0058	hmm
S0179	mental note secondly that's why you don't undertake people fast
S0058	yes
S0179	cos you suddenly put yourself in their blind spot and they're not expect you but the second important point be there i do something that i could have do better and i want to improve on it next time
S0058	hmm
S0179	however
S0058	no
S0179	yes
S0058	ah busy still we're go the right way as in not carry on round be i think be er be the way to go isn't it
S0179	yes oh shit you be just undertake right
S0058	yeah
S0179	that's special in that case that be honestly special
S0058	yeah i see what you mean yeah
S0179	that wasn't that bad if you be just get out into lane but
S0058	huh no he be just yeah
S0179	so interestingly legally if i hadn't see him and we have hit him that would have be his responsibility
S0058	because he be undertake right
S0179	yeah because that would have be drive without due care and attention
S0058	right
S0179	because undertake be actually illegal
S0058	yes right
S0179	erm well at least not specifically it's frown on in the highway code it's a you should not do this but it will be prosecute as drive without due care and attention
S0058	yeah right interest
S0179	oh right erm
S0058	wow
S0179	yeah oh god i love that national speed limit and then two second after it
S0058	yeah i go to have to start think about erm what to put on for my ipod i'm not use to have my music collection with me
S0179	well you've now get everything now haven't you
S0058	yeah literally everything yeah erm be it alright if i erm yank some audio book
S0179	i have a lot
S0058	true i'll stick everything you've get on it cos then we can play it through the dock and all of the audio book
S0179	well no i still like mine on the dock thank you very much
S0058	no that's what we say the other day that's what i i couldn't remember talk about me have it in the car but you do say that we'd just put everything
S0179	no we didn't that be a joke
S0058	oh right okay
S0179	i still want my music collection on my ipod i don't want it on yours
S0058	fair enough
S0179	otherwise what's the point in mine
S0058	fair enough who's this
S0179	i'm not sure it's good though
S0058	oh but erm there be an audio book that we start i think it be
S0179	those boys don't understand the average speed limit check
S0058	no
S0058	but erm yeah what be i go to say erm oh i just think oh yeah that be it crook house i think it be we start and then never actually finish it so i'd quite like to finish that maybe when i've finish my book on the bus
S0179	i like it cos you can watch with your eye shut listen to them with your eye shut
S0058	yes yeah yeah
S0179	i still really want to go to lego land
S0058	let's go some time
S0179	i'm not sure that's acceptable i'll have to find a child
S0058	you can just go you're allow
S0179	be you
S0058	yeah they'll let you in oh i've get two for one in lego land i think and alton tower wh smith give me a voucher
S0179	right
S0058	so yeah if you want to go to alton tower in all fairness you can generally get two for one for alton tower without too much trouble
S0179	yeah pay for the price of alton tower
S0058	ah i wonder if they be any more or whether it be another short live things
S0179	i think it be unfortunately it be relatively short live
S0058	yeah
S0179	which be possibly as well
S0058	yeah
S0179	the best one be either the one in the taxi or the land economy one
S0058	i think my favourite be still the one walk to king's with the card i still like that one i think
S0179	oh yes those be good there be a whole range of those which be good that be possibly the best one
S0058	and yeah i i that be my favourite out of the boromir ones erm
S0179	boromir relate humour
S0058	yeah i love it there's a whole genre i love the erm the the tourist at john's there's a picture at the top and then gandalf you shall not pass
S0179	uh
S0058	huh okay weavey
S0179	okay let's get past you er
S0058	ah
S0179	what
S0058	i presume it's can heat good song
S0179	who by
S0058	jamiroquai
S0179	be it
S0058	yeah it be
S0179	okay
S0058	we can skip it if you don't like it
S0179	no
S0058	i quite like jamiroquai
S0179	this must be one of my run songs i have no idea i have this
S0058	oh right it's good i like it he he use to wear kind of stupid hat that be his thing
S0179	well as far as things go that's not too bad
S0058	true true i agree with the sentiment as well just dance problems er
S0179	it's busy
S0058	it be
S0179	we actually agree on this
S0058	i'm glad we both recognise the factual statement be true
S0179	i'm glad we both appreciate the traffic density for what it be
S0058	dense yes indeed
S0179	dense like your mother
S0058	ah dense like your face
S0179	just like your mum's face
S0058	ah
S0179	see what i do there
S0058	i do yes i do oh i'm quite excite about
S0179	yeah should be fun
S0058	yeah it's really nice it will be really different i think a different week for us so want to kind of be there
S0179	flirt
S0058	no not particularly i think it's because he hasn't see her since first year
S0058	i think that will be a very very bad idea
S0179	what
S0058	heather be there
S0179	i think that will be utterly hilarious they would destroy each other
S0058	yeah it would be a mutual black hole i think in all fairness though she seem much better like erm well as one of the comment she make when she be upset
S0179	right
S0058	erm she be she be like you know i be really upset when we you know we be talk about this in a bus stop and i be like i'm cry in public i haven't do this since i be mentally unstable last year which be a you know a nice bite of er
S0179	yeah
S0058	so she be annoy for be yeah for be kind of upset in public and do stuff that she have doesn't do anymore so that be quite nice
S0179	yes
S0058	but erm yeah i suppose so
S0179	right just make sure you take full opportunity with the fact she's live in your house and work underneath you to boss her about
S0058	yeah definitely
S0179	as in if the opportunity rise you boss
S0058	oh yeah definitely well no i i i'll decide
S0179	you be actually her boss
S0058	no no i be no entirely erm i'm her responsible person i believe it's know as erm cos she can't be manic cos she'll be she's not work
S0179	oh
S0058	but erm yeah no what i'm go to do be i'm not i'm go to make her think things through
S0179	give her all the shit job
S0058	well actually i've get a quite a nice timetable for her but i'm i'm gonna make her think things through for herself as in if she ask me something i'm go to say okay if i give you this bite of information i want you to go and think about it and work it out for yourself have a go you know just because sometimes you've get to do that at work
S0179	yeah
S0058	and and just try and get her into that way of think i mean she might do it anyway but if she do if she's a little bite dependant and a little bite sarah what do i do now i'll and i'm what i'm go to do it will be the first half of the week i'm go to give her lot of her task and and then say okay so you have a few things at the end of the week sort of you know appointments but then in the rest of the time i want you to organise your time and complete these task by the end of the week
S0179	yeah
S0058	and keep me update on your progress and yeah do time management basically erm i'm not go to tell you what when to do what
S0179	well to fair i'm never go to start on the first thing finish it and then the next thing finish it
S0058	well no but there there very much ongoing task
S0179	ah
S0058	and so i mean yeah some of them won't be finishable so i want to get what she feel be a reasonable amount do while also complete some task and have other task as background task same as cos that's how my work very much be a lot of it isn't finishable but you have to keep do it as a back as a side task alongside other things that you need to get do for a date you know so i guess recognise urgency and deadlines and prioritise and stuff i want her to practise erm just all that kind of thing that she'll be able to then talk about in interview erm and just have a go at do i think be important have that freedom
S0179	i have no idea what this song be
S0058	erm it's probably from that run cd
S0179	yeah i i
S0058	i i can't remember what it be call it's get spanish in it be the only thing i know about it
S0179	oh good i'm glad you've narrow it down there
S0058	erm yeah i'm quite look forward to it
S0179	oo
S0058	what
S0179	the guy ahead just swerve manically
S0058	i miss that i be watch the er motorbike
S0179	oh dear
S0058	oh dear
S0179	well at least we now have a wash up monkey
S0058	yes now wash now dance i wonder if she's fully accept the fact that she can't watch iplayer or 4od or itv player
S0179	at least it's unwise to try
S0058	hmm
S0179	at least it's unwise to try
S0058	yeah people don't get the whole tv thing
S0179	that's a fuck ugly car
S0058	horrible innit well it be a van it's not i don't think you can even call it a car
S0179	well it look like a if you look at the side it's actually a huge saloon car which have be add onto a top which be what amuse me
S0058	it's not attractive be it
S0179	you see that at the back
S0058	yeah i see what you mean yeah that big bite at the back what make be that
S0179	dodge
S0058	okay
S0179	it's american
S0058	yeah i be go to say it look kind of american in style big be basically what i mean by that
S0179	swell
S0058	yeah but erm yeah i love the fact that like in say even the sort of rubbish cars that all the sort of college cars be drive
S0179	be huge
S0058	be massive yeah really huge
S0179	yes well super minis just don't sort of exist in the same way
S0058	just haven't catch on just imagine drive a yaris around america it would be like ah
S0179	use your smart car
S0058	huh smart car look smart cars look weird in england so imagine what they look like in america
S0179	indeed
S0058	tiny and cute
S0058	no
S0179	feeder
S0058	feeder yeah sound like it's do in the song can't believe think word get around be better that performance cocktails just incorrect i be like i quite their first album i think that's cos i've cos i sort of listen to it a lot when i be on holiday when i be younger it be sort of one of the cds i always have with me erm
S0179	oh this would be in your cd player
S0058	yeah well i have a diskman and i have a case for it that you could put six cds in the front and zip
S0179	yeah
S0058	so erm so yeah you could take seven away with you and so you have to pick carefully so i generally have travis stereophonics and other miscellaneous pulp and then other miscellaneous things
S0179	oh dear
S0058	what
S0179	no rear wipers
S0058	yeah a bite unfortunate but then if you can't turn it off
S0179	yeah i be think that oh well ah tt look weird
S0058	doesn't look weird it's fine it's you know just not terribly excite female driver
S0179	yeah odd that
S0058	in a white audi tt
S0179	i don't understand how men can drive fast cars they very girly
S0058	they're quite feminine yeah
S0179	they look nice but they're sort of the other thing that possibly amuse me about them so at work both and have them
S0058	oh right
S0179	what ubiquitous fairly well earn women's cars then
S0058	erm yeah exactly i be like and they're both sort of talk about them and it's like well it always annoy me a little bite cos neither of you i imagine can drive at all
S0179	yeah they've get these
S0058	yet and yet you're sort of into so of like i would guarantee that i would be able to out drive you in this
S0179	yeah
S0058	sort of waste i guess
S0179	erm the best drive i've ever see occur in a nissan micra
S0058	yeah
S0179	it's not the car it's how it's drive
S0058	but who be that
S0058	yeah think so no exactly i agree it's entirely how it's drive and it help like a good driver in a good car presumably be a thing of beauty
S0179	erm to some extent but often it be so often limit by the road and the traffic condition so yeah
S0058	yeah yeah i guess that's the top gear thing isn't it well on a track yeah it drive like that but you never ever need it to be able to do that cos
S0179	no what you need to be able to do be interact with traffic and read the road condition
S0058	yeah and the the car need to be suitable i guess to do that and respond quickly enough for
S0179	mm it's actually bizarre i mean probably the best thing be something like er cos supercars be actually quite big
S0058	be they
S0179	which yeah they're but very wide
S0058	oh okay i never really appreciate that
S0179	yeah they be huge
S0058	oh right okay fair enough
S0179	erm which make quite unsuitable for a lot of road use
S0058	huh
S0179	i e they're not very good for drive around a town centre
S0058	right
S0179	they've get appal turn circle there
S0058	yes so but if on a very wide empty track great
S0179	well on a motorway or an autobahn yes
S0058	yeah yeah i guess yeah for get for get from a to b in germany great
S0179	that's what i would really like the c30 polestar fuck that's a good car they be go to produce
S0058	what mental engine in a very small car
S0179	they're go to produce it as a rival for the m3
S0058	okay
S0179	except it's four wheel drive and more powerful and smaller and bright blue
S0058	right
S0179	it's very volvo
S0058	yeah
S0179	it's volvo do nutty car
S0058	yeah volvo go mental for a minute they don't normally do mental
S0179	well it's not mental it's very like it clock up some ridiculous record on the nürburgring
S0058	right that's what i mean though like mentally fast and bright blue and sort of look at our stupid car
S0179	but they have a feature on the record attempt in magazine on like it be one of volvo's test drivers go to do it
S0058	yeah right cool
S0179	and he be basically say that i mean cos i mean of yeah it be really interest cos they've get like the reporter go round with him for the first few lap
S0058	right
S0179	and he'd like never do it before but he already get like a time which experience people do it a 911 would have be please with in the first attempt
S0058	nice nice
S0179	in an unfamiliar car
S0058	huh yeah
S0179	with a reporter on board and then ditch the reporter to save weight
S0058	right nice they tell the reporter to chop off an appendage of his choice and throw it out of the window to save weight
S0179	yeah
S0058	tell the report to take his clothe off
S0179	erm
S0058	oh dear
S0179	but yeah that be er
S0058	no that's cool
S0179	but it be interest that he apparently just have like didn't have any he didn't have any sort of ego at all it be just a really sort of a pleasure to watch him drive
S0058	what the test driver
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah that's good
S0179	he be very swedish about the whole thing
S0058	ah bless what kind of a shrug and a yes it be nice car
S0179	no no he be just like nervous about it rather than sort of arrogant
S0058	oh okay
S0179	bless
S0058	it be rather unfortunate the erm the ceo of volvo be german pronounce it wolwo oh
S0179	which be quite ironic that they know volvo's biggest rival be the german's
S0058	yeah oh i guess there's maybe too much difference if it's
S0179	can you open that do it one hand
S0058	yeah sure
S0179	suppose to open it or it
S0058	yeah i'm please you go with that option yeah er yes
S0179	anyway but er i
S0058	i can see you be ceo of volvo
S0179	i can't
S0058	no
S0179	i can see me be chief engineer
S0058	ah true yes i can see you be chief engineer until you get to sort of retirement sort of time i e about thirty five and then er think oh i'll be ceo for a year or two just you know
S0179	they wouldn't pay you very well
S0058	yeah
S0179	i have seriously consider work for them though
S0058	you mean with engineer they don't pay very well
S0179	well no i be yeah unfortunately i wouldn't be pay brilliantly unless you get to the
S0058	right right
S0179	i i have seriously consider work for them but i think you have to be really quite good
S0058	yeah oh i'm sure you would really love it that's the thing but would you need to move to sweden presumably
S0179	erm not necessarily although probably or germany or china actually
S0058	ah have you not
S0179	well i have objections to live in china
S0058	yeah
S0179	mainly because they actually you know kill people
S0058	do they human right objections not just like i don't like the food or you know with what the climate a slightly more serious objection their record on human right not so good
S0179	no in fact they be a er still a one party one party politically control state
S0058	yeah with a insane death penalty record
S0179	yes record be the word
S0058	yeah i've get some good news and some bad news the good news be you've get a world record the bad news be
S0179	er
S0058	everyone hat you for it
S0179	well it do raise question as to what can the state do because the concept of war crime which i always think interest right so but you're kill each other anyway i don't
S0058	you mean the idea that that
S0179	well the geneva convention set out which a lot of countries sign up to so even during war there be rule
S0058	right
S0179	which i find a very strange idea
S0058	that's bizarre isn't it so you're allow to kill each other but not too much not too effectively
S0179	well no so for example when you capture an enemy soldier you're oblige to you're oblige to look after him you have to fee him and house him and look after his well be
S0058	right right
S0179	you've but he also wasn't oblige to to reveal anything other than his name rank and serial number
S0058	right right
S0179	erm
S0058	and presumably torture be
S0179	yeah specifically if if it's torture
S0058	yeah

S0179	and that be in the fifties
S0058	yeah
S0179	it just doesn't happen anymore
S0058	yeah it's interest
S0179	it's funny when in this country how the nhs be like the third biggest employer of the world after the chinese army and the american army
S0058	yeah huh be the american army second i i remember read that
S0179	well the american department of defense so all of the american arm service

S0179	they're really smart
S0058	i don't know anything about it really cos they're not particularly often kind of out and about right okay
S0179	well you see that's my kind of thing i'm read no sorry i saw a little advert about india be now sort of emerge gradually as a sort of global superpower
S0058	mm
S0179	economically
S0058	yeah
S0179	er as in it's almost on a route to overtake china
S0058	be it
S0179	yeah possibly because it's huge
S0058	india yeah yeah
S0179	and and you you i i you'd actually much prefer it to china
S0058	yeah well i mean i think it's very corrupt in india
S0179	yeah
S0058	and there be serious problems with erm kind of caste type issue
S0179	massive wealth inequality yeah
S0058	erm but yeah it's probably better than china
S0179	yeah but to be fair it's
S0058	er i don't know with india i kind of feel i can talk
S0179	yeah and bear in mind this be a state
S0058	yes
S0179	but it still seem to be do quite well for itself as in there's no sort of er er extremist religious group well there's a few anyway
S0058	yeah i mean i'm sure there be problems but less you know less extreme than so many other countries
S0179	but you look at sort of discrimination america much

S0058	be you surprise
S0179	very to be fair in my situation i wouldn't be do that as in it's determine not overtake but actually there be a gap and it's not overtake so i'm go to assume it want to go slowly for a while
