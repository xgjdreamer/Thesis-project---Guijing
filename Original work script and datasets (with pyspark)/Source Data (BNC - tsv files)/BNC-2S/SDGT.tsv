S0618	yes indeed yeah so what you be up to
S0619	erm what have i be up to i be in the court this morning
S0618	mm how be that
S0619	my two little judge er one be you know he's quite young he's very handsome er his english be sort of very very good he's a real perfectionist
S0618	mm
S0619	and the other one be sort of a little fat dwarf man
S0619	he's like the toad of toad hall
S0618	chalk and cheese ah that's sweet
S0619	english be rubbish in an advance group there's only three of them
S0618	oh no
S0619	er and the third one be this really lovely lady who's er pregnant she wasn't there today and i sort of say be okay cos they she tell me she be pregnant
S0618	oh yes you say you'd get a pregnant judge
S0619	before the first
S0618	trimester thingy
S0619	before the end of the first trimester
S0618	mm
S0619	and she say i've not tell anyone else at work i'm only tell you
S0618	what
S0618	cos you don't have the language to gossip
S0619	well yeah the language but she's the second person who's tell me she be pregnant before the end of the first trimester
S0618	wow
S0619	er in this job so far i don't know whether it's because they're say it in a different language or because
S0618	yeah
S0619	er there be some kind of sort of distance
S0618	mm
S0619	in their brain it's okay to tell me but they won't tell their colleagues
S0618	yeah that's weird
S0619	so when i say to when i say to them oh be okay they sort of go oh oh oh and i think they don't know that i know she's pregnant
S0618	ah
S0619	wonder whether she's be off work for a long time cos something's bad have happen
S0618	oh shit
S0619	or you know all of these things and i can't sort of push it
S0618	yeah
S0619	cos they might not know that's why she's not at work
S0618	so they don't know that you know
S0619	exactly
S0618	but then you don't know for sure that they know
S0619	that they know so i sort of test the water a little
S0618	so you suspect that they know you suspect that they think that you won't know even though you know
S0619	yeah because the end of this first trimester be during winter break so she might've tell them by then
S0618	oh okay
S0619	er but you know the sad i might've tell you this before i'm not sure maybe i do last year i have a lady who tell me she be pregnant before the end of the first trimester she hadn't tell her friends
S0618	woah
S0619	she hadn't tell you know her extend family but then she lose the baby so
S0618	ah shit
S0619	i know so i think she sort of i don't know whether she regret tell me but then she have to tell me about it
S0618	yeah
S0619	and that be just the worst lesson i've ever have in my whole life
S0618	jeez i'm sure
S0619	erm
S0618	be it be that a one to one
S0619	mm mm
S0618	ah
S0619	yeah it be awful it be awful so i just sort of
S0618	and hard for her to express something so emotional
S0619	yeah
S0618	and so deep in her second language or third
S0619	i it be it be it be and then you keep kind of i don't know whether it make it not easier but it's this sort of distance it's not in your language you can really sort of distance yourself from what you're talk about
S0618	yeah
S0619	er you know and we have to sort of go through the vocabulary for the whole thing
S0618	oh
S0619	which be really not what i'd expect to have to do
S0618	yeah
S0619	er and i don't think well she didn't awful but i just like with this other woman now i'm just like oh god
S0619	i really hope
S0618	shit i hope she's alright
S0619	the same thing's happen
S0618	yeah

S0619	for the money for the money it's not bad
S0618	yeah and there be others that be something like two point two kilowatts but

S0618	not that imply that you're unproductive on other days
S0619	usually er chaotic no i'm just erm really into post it note at the moment so it make me look
S0618	good
S0619	far more organise than i actually be
S0618	post its be great as long as they don't fall off
S0619	they keep fall off yeah
S0618	mm
S0619	unfortunately your as nice as they be have very little stay power on the wall
S0618	yeah okay
S0619	these be terrible but they're really useful for spanish i just sort of write stuff down that i can't
S0618	oh good for you
S0619	if i can't remember
S0618	yeah
S0619	if i write it down it make it a bite easier but i've get just bits and piece to do catch up from sort of winter break and go oh here's a thing that someone give me that i need to find the answer for or
S0618	ah bitty bits
S0619	yeah and i'm really
S0618	that might take five minutes might take an hour
S0619	yeah er and i'm just a bite not piss off you know when you're you have your co teacher and you're do units of a text book or
S0618	uhu
S0619	especially like upper intermediate you have you part a and part b
S0618	yeah
S0619	and i do part b
S0618	yeah
S0619	she's just take like forever she's just start unit three it's
S0618	oh
S0619	nearly the second semester
S0618	shit
S0619	erm
S0618	and how many units be in the book
S0619	ten
S0618	oh
S0619	it's not essential that we finish the book but
S0618	actually it be second semester now isn't it
S0619	yeah it's like the er middle of february
S0618	doesn't it start this week oh okay
S0619	yeah erm we should've finish unit four i'm up to unit four but i can't do it because i need her to do part a before i do part b cos the grammar in it
S0618	ah shit
S0619	you need this part of the grammar to do
S0618	link into that
S0619	this part of grammar
S0618	can you start on five b and then go back to four b
S0619	well yeah that's what i think maybe if i just do all of the
S0618	or can you do a
S0619	all of the read and listen
S0618	you do a and she do b
S0619	yeah i might ask if we that's a good idea just swap
S0618	cos it's it's not a specific b isn't always read listen be it
S0619	no no no
S0618	so yeah so yeah you do
S0619	swap
S0618	a and she can do b
S0619	cos i'm just like ah
S0618	and
S0619	i can't do anything i'm just have to create like bullshit lessons
S0618	yeah
S0619	to fill the time for her to catch up which be fine because it's like lot of conversation or do things a little bite differently but it's not what i want to do
S0618	yeah
S0619	and i think we just have different approach my approach be do it fast and then review and review and review
S0618	mm
S0619	and hers be do it really slowly methodically make sure it go in the first time
S0618	okay
S0619	and i think we just have different style
S0618	different style yeah
S0619	cos i would you know fly through it and then just keep go back over it keep go back over it give it a couple of weeks review it give it a couple of weeks review it but
S0618	mm
S0619	which i think it i don't know i don't know which be best it might be better for them to do it so slowly
S0618	mm probably depend on the individual student i
S0619	yeah exactly
S0618	there's no right or wrong
S0619	to do it yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	but i'm just like in no man's land there's really just like waste time week after week
S0618	yeah
S0619	but
S0618	yeah see about that and then you can lumber her with the grammar hooray
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah or oh i don't know
S0618	mm
S0619	anyway just a bite like oh fine but apart from that once today's over then the rest of the week's plain sail

S0619	how many people be in the group tell me all about it
S0618	erm there be oh god i'm so unobservant i feel energy more than look around me so i think there be probably about five at the back six seven eight plus the teacher
S0619	okay
S0618	all women all kind of thirty to sixty
S0619	uhu
S0618	teacher woman i'm sure she's older than me but oh my god what a body and how fit be she
S0619	mm
S0618	she's amaze and the position she get her body in you think
S0618	that shouldn't be humanly possible
S0619	uhu
S0618	but it be she's so strong she's incredible anyway yeah so we have erm mat blanket big poof things
S0619	uhu
S0618	wooden block things strap and we be just do these hold and work with a partner for a time as well i work with an older lady call she's very nice erm oh i dunno how to describe it really but you're just kind of use muscle and perform
S0619	mm
S0618	action that you never perform in daily life
S0619	uhu
S0618	and she's very fussy about posture and about the action that you do
S0619	yeah yeah yeah your technique
S0618	and do it perfectly correctly which be great give you reassurance erm that she's a good teacher and nobody's gonna get hurt
S0619	mm mm
S0618	all all get out alive but erm yeah it be just a bite bizarre and hard work so yeah
S0619	good how many minutes
S0618	but it be good erm it's an hour and fifteen but
S0619	uhu
S0618	you do a lot of lay down flat on your back at the end with a blanket over you have a nice little rest and she do erm she's get erm sing bowl and things like that
S0619	oh nice
S0618	it's like a little sound bath to relax to at the end and i would guess that be more than fifteen minutes so it's probably about fifty fifty five minutes of
S0619	mm
S0618	strange position
S0619	mm mm
S0618	strange action ninja things erm and yeah and then lot of relaxation at the end
S0619	good
S0618	which be good
S0619	glad you like it i've only try yoga once and it be ninety minutes
S0618	ninety minutes
S0619	yeah
S0618	that's a lot
S0619	erm but i be just bore i think with because i see it as exercise i don't see it as a way to
S0618	mm
S0619	relax
S0618	yeah
S0619	the mind or whatever it's for me it's exercise and i didn't feel like i be get any result
S0618	oh okay
S0619	and wait for the next day you'll hurt tomorrow and i think no i won't because i wasn't really
S0618	mm and you didn't mm
S0619	i just didn't get it it's not for me i need exercise to really
S0618	yeah
S0619	you know to know that it's happen
S0618	you need to feel it
S0619	to push you to the limit yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	and it's like oh we i can't remember what even what we do lot of stretch lot of position handstands and all of this stuff and i just think well
S0618	yeah mm it's interest i just erm
S0619	it's not for me
S0618	i've be to load of class in different countries and erm
S0619	mm
S0618	different teachers obviously and i think with she's erm she's all about get it absolutely spot on and i think her wednesday morning class be kind of like a let's excel at these particular position
S0619	mm
S0618	and these particular movements that's the wednesday class what i normally do of an even be a lot more flow
S0619	uhu
S0618	and harder work erm and i'm not the whatever's on monday and thursday mornings be the same and i be gonna go tomorrow but i'm off to the funeral now so i won't
S0619	mm
S0618	erm and i yeah and i think mondays and thursdays be a bite more
S0619	mm
S0618	work i think wednesday be like the masterclass of perfect
S0619	mm
S0618	particular position so yeah but i'm think that there's a vinyasa flow class in in that you would love
S0619	mm
S0618	and that's erm on a friday night i can't remember the woman's name now but oh my god that be an hour of hell
S0619	mm
S0618	i i couldn't wait for the end of it and throughout the whole class i would be shake
S0619	uhu
S0618	sweat
S0619	uhu uhu
S0618	it's just really hard work but such a sense of achievement and the idea with that be that one move then flow into another move
S0619	mm
S0618	and you'd maybe hold that for a few breaths and then you flow onto another move so different bits of your body get use or rest
S0619	mm
S0618	at different time and it be design very well so that as you flow from one to the other you get a bite of relief on the bite that have be shake
S0619	mm mm mm
S0618	and work another bite it be really good
S0619	mm
S0618	i think you'd love that
S0619	yeah er that
S0618	be mostly younger fitter people as well
S0619	mm
S0618	so yeah
S0619	no well i don't know maybe one day i will try again
S0619	but at the time maybe it be just at the time it wasn't right but no gym today because you know it's the busiest day and er i
S0618	mm
S0619	if i go on a wednesday i just get a bite stress that i should be do something

S0618	sixty
S0619	you know it's like ten pound seventy five
S0618	which be which be one student
S0619	a session yeah
S0618	take he's the easiest
S0618	so for one hour a week can pay for all your personal train need
S0619	mm that's a good point
S0619	that's a good point yeah cos
S0618	yeah
S0619	i mean it's super expensive but if you say like it's ten pound for all of these sessions in england i be pay thirty quid an hour
S0618	yeah
S0619	so for er you like in that respect it's not so expensive but i
S0618	i don't think it's pricey at all
S0619	no
S0618	that's fine
S0619	it's worth it
S0618	yeah
S0619	like i'd pay more er and the but the judge today be tell me about this new policy it's like the child benefit policy
S0618	mm
S0619	if you have a second child in poland you get five hundred złoty per month for that child
S0618	right
S0619	er er dependent on your income er no no no not dependent on your income
S0618	oh okay
S0619	but if you have a high income er you don't get money for the first child if you have a low income you get money for the first child
S0618	mm
S0619	er and you know he be say er i mean he be like i don't need the money so it's a bite of a shame that they don't do it by income because
S0618	yeah
S0619	he be like i'm not gonna say no but they're give me this money that as a family we don't need and it should be go somewhere else
S0618	that they don't need yeah
S0619	erm and you know if you have three kid so you get or even if you have two kid then you get a thousand złoty a month he say that's as much as women get pay per month in poland
S0618	yeah
S0619	so they're gonna just stop work and start look after the kid
S0618	and have a baby yeah
S0619	and i just think that be like no money at all
S0618	yeah
S0619	per month
S0618	i know
S0619	for a woman's salary and er i didn't wanna say like what kind of job be you talk about
S0618	it's a hundred quid isn't it
S0619	well it's a bite more about two nearly two hundred quid
S0618	okay how much be it what's the złoty
S0619	er a thousand
S0618	a thousand okay yeah
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	yeah okay
S0619	he say between a thousand and twelve hundred be like the average salary of a woman
S0618	yeah
S0619	in er like nationwide
S0618	wow
S0619	but i don't know like what sort of job that would equate to
S0618	yeah
S0619	i mean
S0618	so you can understand how very well educate polish women come to the uk and work a
S0619	work uhu
S0618	fifty hour a week clean job for minimum wage
S0619	uhu uhu uhu yeah exactly
S0618	wow
S0619	erm and who be it
S0618	jeez that's amaze
S0619	well be tell me er i think he be i don't know whether he be talk about or he be talk about somebody and this person in poland have a friend who go to england to be a binman
S0618	mm
S0619	and i think they get double
S0618	binmen get quite a lot actually
S0619	double as a binman as a lawyer in poland
S0618	i apply to be a binman mm
S0619	it's must yeah i it must be good money mm
S0618	and i think it be i don't know if it be a gender thing didn't even get an interview but i be incredibly strong at the time
S0619	mm
S0618	could've do it easy
S0619	er but er but er we be talk about this and you know they be say that's why lot of people go to england for this sort of money
S0618	yeah
S0619	but at the same time it be like it's so wrong though if you're sort of try to encourage people to stay at home and look after their well not encourage but if you're give them the opportunity
S0618	mm
S0619	to stay at home and look after the kid it mean there's gonna be no women in industries and er
S0618	yeah
S0619	all of like er the majority of the industries already drive by by men be gonna be even more
S0618	even more so complete gender imbalance
S0619	yeah
S0618	mm
S0619	in the workplace erm
S0618	that be a lot of money if that's equivalent to a wage that's pretty crazy isn't it
S0619	well that's what they say and that's why er in england and germany it's not so much of a problem because there's a huge disparity between this sort of these benefit and wag
S0618	yeah
S0619	whereas here it's so similar that you can just swap one for the other
S0618	yeah wow
S0619	yeah so they say it's so stupid they should be put money into free kindergartens or free childcare for people
S0618	yeah childcare or whatever after school club
S0619	erm and they say kindergartens and nurseries whatever they close at four
S0618	yeah
S0619	here
S0618	but then i suppose
S0619	to match or reflect work time
S0618	yeah
S0619	but they should be open more so people can
S0618	but the new government be very religious and
S0619	traditional and conservative yeah
S0618	yeah and church drive so i suppose from that viewpoint you know to my mind erm i feel that christian dogma and catholic dogma in particular be at some level deliberately patriarchal
S0619	mm
S0618	and at some level
S0619	yeah
S0618	deliberately seek to suppress what i
S0619	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0618	would term the divine feminine
S0619	uhu
S0618	so that i guess be another step towards that you know potentially
S0619	it's very patriarchal as a religion
S0618	alienate women from other people who aren't women with children
S0619	mm mm
S0618	erm you know i'm not say you can't be a a divine feminine stand in your power goddess and be a parent
S0619	mm mm
S0618	of course you can but i'd say that's less likely if your social circle
S0619	mm
S0618	be more predominantly you know other mother
S0618	parent that i do know who have choose to stay at home and bring up their kid i'm think of in particular lovely woman work with her in furniture reuse for years at national level and she have a child and this child be her life and
S0619	mm
S0618	you know good luck to her if you like children erm but yeah i know it really do her head in sometimes and just want to have a
S0619	mm
S0618	an intelligent conversation
S0619	yeah
S0618	and find it very difficult to find the time and the people for that
S0619	and there's also this problem if you stay at home until your kid be eighteen and you stop get this money what then
S0618	mm yeah
S0619	be you gonna try be you gonna go back to work with er mm you know lose a lot of experience into a dramatically change sort of technological world
S0618	yeah very true
S0619	relearn skills relearn everything who's gonna wanna employ someone who's have a eighteen year employment gap
S0618	mm
S0619	erm i don't know strange
S0618	yeah i suppose it's particularly strange give our cultural upbringings
S0619	well yeah exactly
S0618	we be very different
S0619	yeah and and it's a shame
S0619	that my this female judge wasn't there today because you know she's the one who i be say yesterday er who have get this sort of well i'm just gonna get a nanny why should i
S0619	why should i put myself through all the stress you know
S0618	yeah
S0619	i'm important too i'm just gonna do whatever
S0618	good for her yeah
S0619	i be just like that's so great
S0619	like good on you for work hard you've get enough money and you're just like oh fuck it someone else can do all this stuff
S0618	yeah
S0619	she be tell me you know she be like i love read and whenever she be like and god kid be bore so i'm just like drive this toy round and like read my book
S0618	have she get children yeah
S0619	yeah she's get a boy he's like two or three and she's just like fuck it this be so shit like read a good book
S0618	jesus it make you wonder if you know in another world in another culture maybe she wouldn't've bother have children
S0619	she wouldn't yeah er she's so kind of er progressive i think and she's in this erm but sort of stick in this rather traditional world i think
S0618	yeah
S0619	and you know she live with boys at uni and she live with her boyfriend before she be marry and
S0618	mm
S0619	she live on her own erm
S0618	mm wow that's unheard of
S0619	which be unheard of so she's just like
S0618	yeah
S0619	no bullshit
S0619	er i think
S0618	yeah good for her
S0619	yeah
S0618	wow you know er you know everybody have a right to do what they want as they want i guess yeah but for me personally not have children definitely not want children and not particularly like children
S0619	mm
S0619	yeah it's all influence a little bite
S0618	i can really woo yeah all power to go for it so yeah
S0619	uhu
S0618	i'm quite grateful actually that there wasn't that pressure on me i do get a bite of that from grandparents and have you get a boyfriend when be you get a husband
S0619	mm
S0618	when be you get marry
S0619	mm
S0618	when be you settle down blah blah blah but yeah
S0619	i know i think i'm very lucky that i've never have that and no one in my family would dare to ask
S0618	mm
S0619	i don't know what i've do in the past but they just wouldn't ever
S0618	yeah
S0619	ever ever ask i don't think even you know at christmas and no one care
S0618	that's good mm
S0619	yeah but i be the only single one so tough
S0618	yeah but you know single be a phase you're still perfectly whole and complete
S0619	i be absolutely
S0618	and yeah and at some point you may or may not meet another person who be whole and complete and enjoy a relationship with them what's that beep oh i think that be your doorbell
S0619	no no no
S0618	oh
S0619	just er beep away
S0618	yeah
S0618	so i've be on diva date a bite more
S0619	mm
S0618	and i've be erm yeah er poland be so funny they're the women on diva date in poland seem to be about ten
S0618	they're so young oh my god and i think well er okay so i be young once but do that suggest there be no forty something lesbians
S0619	uhu
S0618	in the whole of eastern europe or what
S0619	think they must've go elsewhere
S0618	yeah i mean there be there be a couple of thirty somethings in krakow and there's a bisexual forty something in romania but you think ah fuck's sake you know
S0618	so yeah i kind of rely on er it's a bite like win the lottery and i think if you put that out there and you're gonna win the lottery you only need to buy one ticket
S0619	mm
S0618	and you'll win and it's a bite the same cos you don't need to be surround by attractive ladies
S0619	uhu
S0618	and you know when the time be right erm and when i'm right you know in the right place
S0619	yeah it'll
S0618	then it'll happen but yeah so so i change my location to erm on this diva date and erm yeah some very nice women on there
S0619	good
S0618	so erm yeah i've send a few message to
S0619	oh yeah that's good news
S0618	maybe i'll see when i'm drive through but then i think well actually you know i'm not gonna form any
S0619	so fleet
S0618	love commit relationship
S0619	of course er uhu
S0618	cos i'm fuck off back to poland again but
S0619	i think that's a good point like i think we probably talk about this before until you're in the right erm sort of state of mind or frame of mind yourself
S0618	mm yeah
S0619	i don't know
S0618	the outer reflect the inner and i think you almost need to get to that position where your level of self love and level of self fulfilment
S0619	mm
S0618	erm be such that
S0619	mm
S0618	you already feel like you have
S0619	yeah
S0618	you know all the love support and everything and then like attract like you draw more to you
S0619	but it's just and we've talk about this before it's just impossible here we've
S0618	mm
S0619	say you know the algorithms just do not work
S0619	an english speak person in a radius of this flat
S0618	yeah
S0619	who be attractive who be interest
S0618	yeah
S0619	who be not a complete dick and hasn't be sort of influence
S0618	yeah
S0619	by the culture in which he's grow up i suppose
S0619	and like the cross section of society be like zero people
S0618	i know
S0618	add in you know a reasonable level of age gap to that or er you you know reasonable age parameters
S0619	i think i need to go younger in poland for sure though
S0618	yeah
S0619	go older be not gonna do me any good
S0618	yeah i can't go younger i be i'm just look at these be all twenty somethings and i that would just really
S0619	yeah i know i can't
S0618	i mean i know age be just a number but i can't imagine be with a twenty something really it's just
S0619	i would er i don't know
S0618	mm
S0619	as a sort of teacher i would sort of draw the line at eighteen as that be the age of my students
S0619	but but why should i
S0618	yeah
S0619	it's legal erm but yes
S0618	mm yes and add homosexual into the equation
S0619	yeah i know
S0618	in a catholic country i'm fuck well i'm not but you know that's the problem no er yeah
