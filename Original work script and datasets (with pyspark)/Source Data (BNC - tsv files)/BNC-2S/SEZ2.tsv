S0451	erm yeah no i think with like i'm think forty pound
S0439	yeah like i
S0451	i i'm i'm yeah i need to email him and say that
S0439	oh god he's go to get two email from us now
S0451	have you email yet
S0439	yeah i already speak to him erm i send him an email last week i didn't go to my train session on thursday
S0451	yeah
S0439	cos i just i be sit at work and like i be really ill last week anyway so i didn't train at all and then after sit at work i be like you know what i don't really want to pay forty pound to go there
S0451	no
S0439	work out and know that i'm not go to be able to do another work out until next week
S0451	work out yeah yeah
S0439	because i just can't because i've get so much run go on
S0451	yeah
S0439	i just can't commit to do enough weightlift sessions and therefore i won't get any stronger and even though i know the technique i still won't build i won't be get physically stronger i think i've the the stay the same weight for like a good few months like i bulk not bulk up i get stronger
S0451	yeah yeah
S0439	noticeably stronger but the moment you stop train or you miss a few sessions your weight drop dramatically and it just it just isn't unless you really dedicate so much time to it you can't get any stronger
S0451	yeah because i i felt think with your run you've definitely lose like you've lose load of weight
S0439	i haven't lose any weight i've actually gain it
S0451	er i it doesn't i i think i cos i that much cardio but i erm no you definitely have
S0439	oh thank you i think i just like tone more like i know that i'm always go to have a big bum i've always have a big bum and i can accept that
S0451	that's a good thing
S0439	yeah but i don't yeah i mean i don't put it on really here as much as i like i obviously i have like a slightly i have a i have a food baby occasionally but like i normally have an okay stomach so i'm not too worry about it but that's the one thing i like about kim kardashian she's bring it big bum
S0451	yeah yeah and the in and the out
S0439	yeah she's bring in the small waist and the big bum that's the one thing i like about her everything else i loathe but
S0451	yeah yeah i don't i yeah
S0439	yeah
S0451	i don't mind her i think she's actually really clever with how she's make er so much money
S0439	oh yeah how she's like how she's manipulate the system and just make so much money out of nothing be a joke
S0451	i no i be really impress
S0439	oh yeah definitely but like i think i'd like to lose a bite more i'd like to lose a bite of weight but i always find that when you do like more exercise you eat more because you get more hungry don't you so but no i be really like i be really nervous about this half marathon and then i do this fourteen k fifteen k run on sunday and i do it quite easily like that's the longest i've ever do a
S0451	yeah
S0439	normally i've only ever run ten maybe eleven at a push
S0451	be you like dead after it
S0439	no i be fine actually i be quite good erm i be a little bite sore like my legs hurt and like it's really weird how you under bum hurt like the muscle under your bum
S0451	that's a good thing that's that's good though
S0439	yeah so i'm really i'm much more confident now about the half marathon and i think like i quite actually enjoy run like
S0451	amaze
S0439	so like
S0451	when erm when be it
S0439	thirteenth of september
S0451	shit
S0439	i know it's like four weeks away
S0451	that's horrible ah wait that's not thirteen weeks
S0439	four weeks
S0451	i i be like
S0439	thirteenth of september
S0451	i be like sorry yeah mm
S0439	yeah four weeks away
S0451	mm
S0439	and erm i think if i enjoy it and i do okay
S0451	amaze
S0439	i'll do it again but yeah it be like i think cos sunday be a really really nice day and i set out run with a friend of mine and we weren't like push it like i wasn't like i probably could have try a little bite harder but i just want to do the distance to be honest
S0451	i be go to say and so much better to finish the run and be like i really enjoy that
S0439	exactly yeah
S0451	i would like to do that again rather than er that kill me
S0439	exactly yeah so
S0451	wow mm
S0439	what be go on at the bottom of your protein shaker how many tablets do you have to take
S0451	that no they're just tablet like so when i erm eat something with like fat or calories in it
S0439	oh yeah
S0451	i need to take those otherwise my body doesn't digest it
S0439	okay
S0451	it's just like pointless but yeah and i'm i wouldn't normally have a protein shake after
S0439	yeah
S0451	fifteen minutes of cardio and foam roll but erm i'm genuinely more er like food
S0439	yeah
S0451	cos i i have erm this morning obviously after do like weight and things
S0439	yeah yeah
S0451	but erm i be expect to do a bite more than i do
S0439	yeah
S0451	i be just so dead i just i be just you know like when you know like i'll be go tomorrow i be like if i do too much now
S0439	exactly like
S0451	i won't do it enjoy it tomorrow
S0439	you shouldn't you shouldn't push yourself
S0451	mm
S0439	like well you should obviously push yourself but not
S0451	but not to the extreme where it's go to fold you the next day
S0439	yeah exactly you want to build it up so that you can train like more time a week and not kill yourself
S0451	yeah yeah
S0439	or be in pain so
S0451	maybe i'm just go to leave then for a while and cos if he's have an email from you and he know that we're
S0439	yeah exactly
S0451	like he might think that i don't know like
S0439	we've have a conversation well obviously we have talk about it but yeah it's not because of that
S0451	yeah so i'm just cos he just sort of think that yeah i'm just recover
S0439	yeah
S0451	erm so yeah so i'll just leave it for now and erm
S0439	yeah it's just so hard and like it it take a lot i've be think it for a while and then i be just sit at work and i be like you know what i'm really poor at the moment like
S0451	yeah cos that's like nearly like a day's work
S0439	it's a hundred and sixty quid a month and it's just like
S0451	it's a lot of money you know
S0439	and like yeah i earn a nice amount like i know i earn an okay amount but it's still like i've get to pay for my car i've get pay for rent i've get this month we have like a massive water bill which i have to pay for like
S0451	er
S0439	just little things add up and forty quid here or there really make a difference like
S0451	mm
S0439	and i don't go out and drink all the time like i don't blow my money on other things it's just i have more important things to pay for and and then also this month i'm go to barcelona and then i'm go to paris so both i'm do quite cheaply but still
S0451	but still and i think if you know if you can if you've find this love of run strange person
S0451	then then erm you don't need someone you don't need to pay someone forty pound to make you do it do you
S0439	no exactly or forty pound to work out which i do really like lift and stuff but i don't i can't i'm never go to dedicate enough time or care about my diet enough to build up muscle
S0451	yeah
S0439	never go to do it and i like i think unless you're really into it and you have the time to dedicate
S0451	yeah
S0439	and you have like no life
S0451	yeah no cos
S0439	that's the only way you're go to get like a perfect six pack and stuff like that
S0451	yeah
S0439	or you've just get really good genes
S0451	definitely i think i erm yeah i just i think if i get if you if i felt i get more for that forty pound erm
S0439	yeah no that's no that's what i think but like it's really good when you're there but he doesn't really do anything outside of that hour
S0451	and he say that he yeah yeah like erm so i think one program i get send but like nothing else
S0439	mm
S0451	like kind of
S0439	there's like no support there's no
S0451	no like with as like we erm like we go to costa and stuff after like train and stuff and erm it's just more i feel like that money be worth it
S0439	yeah
S0451	like my money be worth it with him
S0439	how much do you pay with him thirty
S0451	twice a week
S0439	okay
S0451	it be thirty five if you just do it once a week
S0439	okay
S0451	mm and so with him so it's not like i'm learn weightlift but i'm
S0439	get stronger
S0451	well to be fair dead lift same as with erm
S0439	yeah do you think you're get stronger do you notice it
S0451	like definitely erm yeah and cos so i be like get quite focus on cos i do want to get really muscley er it do mean sacrifice your life like a bite like
S0439	do you what do you have to sacrifice
S0451	erm alcohol really but to be fair i i don't really want to be drink anyway at the minute
S0439	yeah
S0451	i i still could and it's more that i want to get to the point where erm i'm like train for it's not as if i'm train to be a a bikini model or i'm more want it as a long term like
S0439	fitness like lifestyle yeah
S0451	exactly erm so once i get to the point where i want to get er
S0439	whey
S0451	it's fine erm but yeah
S0439	yeah
S0451	but i erm damage my nerve erm like my arm and i haven't be able to do any upper body
S0439	ah oh no
S0451	i be able to like on monday be my first day
S0439	yeah
S0451	but even that week of not do it you go backwards i'm like er
S0439	yeah you do you just muscle just go so quickly
S0451	and i've lose like it's so frustrate
S0439	whereas stamina like be it aerobic yeah anaerobic
S0451	yeah
S0439	which be the one that like run use aerobic
S0451	mm
S0439	aerobic yeah like that doesn't seem to disappear as quickly like i can have a week off run
S0451	exactly yeah
S0439	and i can come back and i can run just as long
S0451	yeah yeah no that be interest as well erm cos i'm start in september have i tell you
S0439	no
S0451	like so every er a part time have the trainer course
S0439	oh oh you do tell me yeah
S0451	like every other weekend so i'm really look forward to that and like so with erm like weightlift i think that's kind of like from to try yeah just slow down learn one thing at a time kind of
S0439	yeah yeah yeah that's what i think i think sometimes you just take on so much that you just get that's what i say to i be like i can't commit to anything and
S0451	then you end up with yeah and yeah you're go to end up like give something complete like stop everything
S0439	yeah so
S0451	but yeah
S0439	have to see how it go like i say i'd i say i'd contact him again in september after the run so
S0451	yeah well you that be a good excuse cos you're like well but we shouldn't be have to think of excuse anyway like if we don't want it we we're pay the money
S0439	yeah exactly yeah
S0451	we're young we can't like that's it be a lot of money
S0439	mm think of all the shoe i could buy
S0451	no but if you think about that for example that's what you should do be you should make yourselves spend at least half of that on something like as a treat
S0439	yeah
S0451	if you do your run
S0439	well that yeah that's the thing like i don't i don't treat me i don't have enough money to treat myself
S0451	yeah so that erm that's you can treat yourself nicely with that amount
S0439	yeah but it's really annoy when people be just like ah lose weight the first thing to do be cut out alcohol and go out i be like but i don't drink much alcohol i drink like one glass of wine a week not even that
S0451	mm yeah yeah
S0439	like i'm drink i'm obviously go to drink a bite on friday but erm

S0451	no no i do i'd rather i'd rather eat
S0439	yeah
S0451	like to make myself feel better i would rather sit and eat some
