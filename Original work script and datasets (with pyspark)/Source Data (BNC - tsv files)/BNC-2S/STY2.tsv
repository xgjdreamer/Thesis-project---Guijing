S0203	i'm not gonna lie play football play football
S0202	so what be the attraction like i can understand
S0203	right now not much but last night we be talk about it and there's a lot of fuck er in football like you wouldn't believe the amount of tactics and like think go into it
S0202	no i do believe that but it's so shit watch it
S0203	to the point where you would some players on here be like you can't just stick a team of eleven people that have all get a high work rate you've get to have some that have get a low they be they can't just teach eleven players that be all gonna be like run about everywhere and that mean everyone'll be out of position when i find that out last night i be like what like it's blow my mind
S0202	what
S0203	right
S0202	please explain please explain
S0203	football like that yeah you might be the quickest player just run everywhere all on the pitch and that's good for one player but you can't pick a team of eleven players where they're all like everyone
S0202	they're not a team they're not a team yeah
S0203	yeah they're not a team they're all run about everywhere yeah you wanna pick two or three players that be like that you wanna pick two or three players that just stay where they be all the time players
S0202	like defenders
S0203	yeah but it's all so tactical so much go into it you think they're all all these players be so much
S0202	i don't think they're stupid i just think the game be stupid i er i er
S0202	i understand that so much think go into any kind of skill and go into it but what i don't understand be why so many millions of people love it
S0203	it's a sport sport people watch it like er any anything like you like watch people dance
S0202	no
S0203	what do you like watch
S0202	i don't watch tv
S0203	mm
S0202	i like watch band and music and that's it
S0203	yeah so when you watch a band yeah
S0202	or movies
S0203	when you watch em live you think oh that's alright that's good that ain't it you don't realise how much think and effort have go into everything like songwriting practice
S0202	you do
S0203	to the gigs
S0202	i do personally
S0203	how much effort do you think i put into music yeah
S0202	a lot so you write you practice you erm write the chord
S0203	yeah
S0202	be that what they're call
S0203	yeah yeah but when i'm mum and dad be like fuck gigs and all day
S0202	yeah course you be i understand that
S0203	yeah but that's part of it the fact that
S0202	that's what no one notice
S0203	yeah
S0202	okay
S0203	all you see be the half an hour that i show you live i might you might enjoy it you might not but say you play crap like you don't like it you might think they're shit but the reason i've be shit that night be because i've have a bad night someone say like they don't like it they think it be shit so i can't perform as well one thing that's change and i might be shit
S0202	yeah i know that i understand that
S0203	and that's what make me that's what make it a good thing to watch cos sometimes it can be brilliant and sometimes it can't be just like football
S0202	yeah
S0203	one player can be amaze best player you've ever see and then one game he could have a terrible game because someone
S0202	then you make your opinion
S0203	yeah yeah
S0202	in that one game
S0203	there's er so much go into it i respect it i don't i don't particularly love football more than football's alright to watch i don't really watch owt else than football and music but
S0202	so you watch movies though right
S0203	yeah
S0202	no me neither
S0203	i've see a lot of film
S0202	i erm the other week i have a clear out cos obviously i have all my stuff from uni and i er i have all my stuff already at home and i have this chest this wide and this deep full of book that i be give away to charity like not even
S0202	well you wouldn't enjoy it like all the good all the
S0202	do you like mill and boon
S0203	i don't know
S0202	well it's it's like romance
S0203	yeah
S0202	you like that
S0203	course i will yeah
S0202	really have you read erm fifty shade of grey
S0203	i have i've only skim through it and it's not incredibly well write for me
S0202	that's mill and boon
S0203	be it
S0202	i have like a hundred of those book
S0203	be they formula
S0202	but no i point i buy them because you know er obviously cos i study english language and literature i study in depth literature like really old literature and most most of my year i'm study erm book as a profession so when i go on holiday i wanna read something that take no brain power and that i can just enjoy
S0203	yeah
S0202	for read so like if i read erm the hobbit or harry potter that would be a joy for me
S0202	you know what i mean
S0202	cos i've read it before but i love it and it make sense
S0203	you can skip page cos you know what happen
S0202	yeah exactly
S0203	you know it word for word anyway
S0202	and you and when you go on holiday when you do what i do so like your friends year read book as a live whatever like you don't wanna read something that be you wanna read something that mean fuck all that you can read and that's why
S0203	i would spend all day look for like easy music and then if
S0202	yeah
S0203	i know i know what kind of music i like but
S0202	yeah but do you wanna play hard music all the time
S0202	if you only listen to hard music you listen to it all the time no you wanna listen to easy go stuff right same with er book and that's why i have a crate as high and wide as this table
S0203	sit on the settee yeah both read book and look at
S0202	we'd be an awesome
S0203	like how far be you and you'd be like oh page a hundred and fifty and i'd be like oh i'm page a hundred and fifty two
S0202	i read four hundred and ten percent faster than the average person
S0203	really do you skim or do you take a lot in cos i tend to miss
S0202	both
S0203	i can kind of
S0202	i skim and take a lot in
S0203	i i don't buy that mean a lot and read book that don't mean anything like miss page
S0202	okay let's do a test there's actually a test there's a test online that see how fast you read and how much you take in like that
S0203	to calculate your
S0203	read test
S0202	this fuck ipad seriously erm this be the same the same one i take as i say i'm four hundred and ten percent faster so i'll give you the same test
S0203	i'll get
S0202	yeah okay so when you're ready
S0203	i wanna do it properly
S0202	okay start read
S0203	well oh i don't know about the people
S0202	go on tick it whichever one you think be right
S0203	i'm just i'm just tell you i'll have a guess
S0202	you be drink so
S0203	yeah yeah
S0202	maybe you should do it when you're not drink
S0203	mm
S0203	this be very interest
S0202	go on
S0203	i see i don't take in little detail like this i just
S0202	i think you're faster than
S0203	i wasn't take in enough then though like i think if i be maybe i'd see it better
S0202	you would
S0203	but i don't think i be read it properly
S0202	though can i just point something out i be read so i read four hundred and ten percent faster
S0203	yeah
S0202	than you're sixty one percent at the moment right
S0203	i've read i've read war and peace and it only take me about fifteen hours but i didn't really understand it all so i'm not read it right
S0202	so er the first five time i take this i be four hundred and ten percent of a book okay so i've have half a bottle half a bottle of wine let's see how fast it take you now
S0203	do it
S0202	so a hundred and fifty five percent faster after a half bottle of wine so
S0202	yeah well that's the thing
S0203	it's a it's a it's a really interest test as well though cos i reckon i could do a lot better than this but i don't think
S0202	yeah but you should do it when you've not have a drink
S0203	i think no i don't think i read quick as as quick as i think i would anyway like
S0202	it's not how fast you read it's how fast you take things in
S0203	yeah oh
S0202	you see but this be
S0203	nah nah i cheat
S0202	the thing be that i don't like
S0202	exactly the thing that i don't like about this test be that it they ask the same question you can
S0203	yeah you know like i reckon i read quick but i don't i don't think i read as much as i think i do
S0202	i tell you what yeah but
S0202	faster than the national average i want you to try this erm this test on here and it's it's erm it's what i do for a degree but erm be er erm
S0203	mm
S0202	and this be test now i i i've be to a few lecture all year blah blah blah i've not read any of the and i get a two one in my exam and this be fuck all and i'm not brag i think
S0202	maybe i would yeah erm i've literally from january to june i've be to three lecture read none of the literature and three hours before the exam i do a bite of revision and one and i get fifty one percent on one question and fifty percent on the other so i get an average of fifty and erm you do you know what a verb be explain a verb to me
S0203	a do word
S0202	okay so go more in depth than that
S0203	er
S0202	go more more in depth than that
S0203	it's a word that describe the action like er perform an activity so say er i be do do be the be the er the action word you know like the verb
S0202	go go more in depth than that
S0203	erm a descriptive version of a verb would be an adverb er
S0202	do you know what a verb be okay so
S0202	there you go well the thing be when i go to university i think english language be know the basics of a do verb a noun be a name
S0203	yeah
S0202	blah blah blah it really fuck isn't so
S0203	how many i be gonna say how many different type be there
S0202	erm let's have a look content oh no exercise okay so
S0203	really i just read the tiniest bite of and i be read a book and there be a little thing that say er
S0203	he buy me a lovely gift however he do not have much money he buy me a lovely gift although he do not have much money and them two things both mean kind of different things er straight away er that's the interest thing about the english language
S0202	let me just show you something else so that's the same app okay so erm ipa go so while that's download let's have a look at this right so this be my degree everyone think it's a mickey mouse degree yeah so this be english grammar exercise blah blah blah so exercise so let's look at do you know what a conjunction be or a preposition
S0203	er a conjunction be when you make er another word that's not a do word a do word i think
S0202	wrong
S0203	preposition i can't remember what a preposition be
S0202	let's click on this
S0203	no i know what a conjunction be
S0202	erm which one do you wanna do verb verb
S0203	sound easy
S0202	okay er
S0203	ah
S0202	erm that's just now
S0203	you be too drink to work

S0203	why give us the app if you can't do anything with it
S0202	no that's a pay thing
S0203	fuck me
S0202	go back to nouns er word pattern that's a free thing i think there you go
S0203	hey
S0202	so read that so replacement test okay so in this the replacement test
S0202	read that
S0203	everything so i have to replace
S0203	it's really interest as well though
S0202	erm yeah unless you're do it in a degree here we go
S0203	i would probably do this as a degree as a degree
S0202	okay so
S0203	right
S0202	common and proper nouns a a proper noun be someone's name
S0203	get it
S0202	okay
S0203	i wanna say white but i don't think it be this be the descriptive though i don't know if it be ah if it's wrong i'm gonna fuck
S0202	you miss one
S0203	oh roll yeah
S0203	oh oh i oh yes i i miss the second one and and it's roll ply and it's and then what else

S0202	imagine do
S0203	oh there you we go then
S0202	there you go
S0203	er
S0202	this be an active test not a passive test
S0202	leave the five there
S0203	think their examples be descriptive
S0202	try it
S0203	descriptive but be like a er
S0202	no it's a noun it's a name for something
S0203	it mean the act of do something if you i get what you mean it's a it's a noun
S0202	name though
S0203	but you're also you're also do something but you have to have oh right i get that facilities yeah
S0202	that's not bad though out of seventeen
S0203	staff i think i i think staff i think staff i weren't sure about that er i think nerve be a description of er gas so i don't know about that ah yeah that's one and
S0202	i tell you what
S0203	i tell you what one more one more
S0202	one more
S0203	yeah erm but it's just hard that's all
S0203	i'm gonna go with what i don't think it be
S0202	okay
S0203	yeah no no no no fuck
S0202	click there alright
S0203	well er ah
S0203	it's hard that though ain't it
S0202	yeah but that's my whole degree
S0203	it's really interest i could do that all day
S0202	like it's hard as fuck
S0203	that's really interest though
S0202	so like
S0203	i i know where i'm go wrong er as soon as they tell me where i'm go wrong as soon as it say like that i go yeah you're right
S0202	so like so like here look verbs adjectives adverbs phrase blah blah okay so if i go into word now it'll give me a list if i go into nouns it'll give me a list determiners give me a
S0203	i don't know a lot of these i don't know what a be a preposition a question so like something you're propose
S0202	no
S0203	no i don't know
S0202	so a preposition be so it's a determiner so say like the the be the determiner
S0202	determine something
S0203	yeah yeah yeah
S0202	a preposition be you would think it be a question but it's not so like erm it's of erm
S0203	right yeah get it straight away
S0202	so it could be a conjunction
S0203	yeah
S0202	a determiner or preposition depend on the context
S0203	mm
S0202	so they all have the same vocabulary but depend on the context that's use
S0203	that's why you're cleverer than me
S0202	no no i'm clever in a different way so
S0203	the fact that you can learn that stuff and remember it
S0202	look at the verbs what would anyway verbs present and past tense infinity participle finite and non finite main auxiliary auxiliary
S0203	i know the auxiliary i know the auxiliary stuff i know er i know be it something to do with erm erm i've learn all this like
S0203	i've learn all this like two years ago and it's it's in the back of my head but i can't quite express what i mean that's why you're better than me cos you can really clearly define what you mean but when i want to express it
S0202	i'm better at that than er you be but you're better at it than me music like how you can do music i have no fuck idea if i say
S0202	no listen okay if you could this be a quote but i'm gonna say it anyway if you judge a fish on how well it can climb a tree
S0203	yeah
S0202	that's it
S0202	no but that's it
S0203	yeah yeah yeah but all i'm say
S0202	if you judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree
S0203	you be mean you be mean to do so you don't even need to do
S0202	but if i if i judge you on your ability to do what i do
S0203	i would much rather do that though because once you do english you can understand everything you be far brighter than me
S0202	erm no
S0203	you don't realise
S0202	no that be a lie i'm sorry
S0203	the only way i would say i'm cleverer than you be by i be able to recognise that you're cleverer than me
S0203	i be i be clever enough to realise that you be much cleverer than me
S0202	ah this be i'm sorry i'm sorry for say that but i really do disagree cos
S0203	i think
S0202	no i'm cleverer you english
S0202	no but let let's just say i sit a music test and you sit an english test
S0203	yeah but
S0202	you would fail and i would fail
S0203	yeah but you've get the disadvantage of never have do music i do english for a while
S0202	yeah but it's not your speciality
S0203	it's not but i do it for a while
S0202	yeah but you've not do it at degree level so you would never know
S0203	but i could still get the basics very basic like noun
S0202	yeah
S0203	i know what a noun be like that's
S0202	a name
S0202	yeah but the thing be like you're judge yourself on something that you've not study in depth if i if i' judge you on your ability for english you judge me on my ability for music then we'd both be
S0203	no but i think i think i think i think english be a lot harder though like i've study it for a while and i
S0202	yeah you find it hard but i find it easy
S0203	that's why you're cleverer
S0202	no but some people be just better at some things than others
S0202	i'll be you go or be you go toilet
S0203	i would say you're cleverer cleverer than me
S0202	shut up no i'm not i'm clever in a different way
S0202	sorry
S0202	sorry i didn't do it on purpose
S0202	sorry
S0202	good job
S0202	i'll be kick out
S0203	erm
S0202	no but you're clever in a different that be you're clever in a different way to that i be
S0203	mark yours off you're better
S0202	yours be looser
S0202	not like my no but like i love that say like i know it's cheesy and cliché and and all that fuck shit but it's true ain't it if you if you look at all the students that go to university to study different subject if you judge them on on on their answer
S0203	music's easy though music be easy
S0202	yeah but english be
S0203	no it's not
S0202	to me
S0203	it's not i've do it
S0202	no
S0202	no but can i just say something it's hard for you because you don't have an english set mind it's like me say to a mathematician oh maths be easy cos i study it i know what it's about it's like a mathematician say to me english be hard but that's cos they don't study it they don't know it like i do you know what i mean
S0203	i think you're i think you're cleverer than me and
S0202	no i disagree i'm not cleverer than anyone seriously
S0203	yes you be
S0202	i'm fuck not cleverer
S0203	i've meet some stupid people and you be not stupid
S0202	i'm not stupid i have a lot of common sense but i be not cleverer than anyone i would never ever say that about myself ever
S0203	i think you definitely be i think i think you're the cleverest person that i know and i know that when we work at mcdonald's straight away
S0202	how
S0203	well because all the fuck managers be fuck retard i could tell that straight away
S0202	yeah they be retard
S0203	and i could tell that most of the people there have no aspiration to anything else and that's how you can tell the er the how people be
S0202	aspiration and ambition be different to
S0203	no i don't think it be because i think if you're if you're i put it there's nothing wrong with be stupid cos i've get a lot of stupid mat who be nice people yeah and i would take a nice stupid person over a clever dickhead any day
S0202	yeah and me too
S0203	i i would much rather hang around with stupid people that be really really nice people all day but erm there's a difference between erm be happy with where you be in life and have a shit er have a shit job and not really know where you be i would rather be successful and really really clever and be happy as well
S0202	yeah
S0203	but that ain't gonna happen i don't think i think you've er you've gotta be kind of you've gotta settle for a bite like i don't think i'm ever gonna be
S0202	i don't think you should ever settle
S0203	i don't think i'm ever go to achieve what i want to achieve
S0202	i don't think you should ever settle i think and this be me be cheesy and cliché or whatever or maybe be too optimistic but i don't think you should ever settle ever if you really want something then why the fuck should you settle you should settle for a little bite but then what's to stop you from go er it sound so cheesy but it's like if you get your degree and then you end up in mcdonald's manager right let's just say that
S0203	yeah
S0202	it be a stop gap job yeah what if you be if you stay there the rest of your life what would you do you'd be miserable
S0203	if i be happy if i be happy with it like some of em be
S0202	that's different though if you be happy it's different
S0203	i would much rather be the best at what i'm do and be really really happy but it ain't gonna happen i ain't gonna be the best at what i'm do i ain't gonna be
S0202	yeah but that's negative to think like that
S0203	i be a negative i'm very very
S0202	i be but i've learn that
S0203	some people say it's be realist yeah but i i just think i'm cynical anyway like
S0202	i be a realist i'm not optimistic at all but i just think that i should never settle for anything like if you really want something you should never settle you should always
S0203	i'm really really cold i'll tell you that
S0202	yeah i'm freeze
S0203	sit here shiver
S0202	i don't think you should ever settle i think if you're if you've get if you're in a if if you're in a job that's like a gap job
S0203	it it it depend
S0202	it's different but

S0203	look what you've do
S0202	like do you know what i mean
S0203	a lot of people go through their entire live do nothing that you've already do
S0202	but that that's what make it sad for these people these people who don't have any ambition i feel so sad for them
S0203	but if they're happy with it i don't begrudge them that at all if if i've get
S0202	no i don't but i feel bad for them it's like they don't have the intelligence to want more if that make sense
S0203	i i kinda do but if they're happy with themselves i can't say i can't say like ah you should be er aspire to more because like if they're happy with it if i be happy yeah i would i if i be happy with
S0202	no but i still feel sorry for them
S0203	yeah but if i be happy work at mcdonald's i would do it but i wasn't like you you could never say but but if it mean if i be work there like two days a week and i be earn a really good wage and have the rest of the day the rest of the week i could do whatever i want i would
S0202	yeah me too i would like my dream be to work erm three three days a week and have the rest of it off that be my dream and then in your that i can have a nice life not i don't wanna be i don't wanna be a millionaire i don't wanna be rich and i don't wanna be famous
S0203	i just support myself that's it
S0202	i just wanna be able to do what i want to do and have money in the bank that's it
S0203	and go on maybe have a holiday a er once a year or whatever
S0202	yeah exactly
S0203	go to america
S0202	maybe maybe
S0203	live the dream
S0202	the american dream but i'm i'm i know it sound bad my sister get erm pregnant eighteen months ago and my heart break i cry my eye out and i be devastate for her because i just think do you know what
S0202	you've never be no listen you've never be abroad you've never do all this and then i sit down and think about it and i think you know what she might not want the same things that i want
S0202	and her aspirations in life be different to mine so maybe me feel sorry for her be not what she want because she's happy how she be
S0203	be she
S0202	i don't know
S0203	how old be she
S0202	twenty
S0203	maybe maybe in a couple of years she'll realise that she might not want to do that like your but chance be when you've get a kid as well it change your whole like whatever cos i've get a mate who's twenty one i go round to her house sometimes and she's and she's like i wish i have a a a i'd've have a job and all that but then be like the best thing that's ever happen to her it sort her out it settle her down she's become a proper woman
S0202	yeah
S0203	so that be all that she be ever gonna do she do it and she now she's happy for it
S0202	happy yeah
S0203	so
S0202	see my sister have a job she have a life she meet a knobhead from a rebound get pregnant to him after they'd be together five years and then they've be together ever since and she isn't happy with him but she love the child which you always will do
S0203	and that's worth it yeah
S0202	but like you know when you look at someone and you just think i never want that and you automatically feel sorry for them because of your own aspirations that's what i look at her and think and when i find out she be pregnant i cry my eye out i my heart break because my parent have never take us abroad they could never afford it and i just think you've never be abroad you've never experience a holiday with friends you've never be travel you've never see all these things and i just think to myself well maybe she didn't want that
S0203	mm
S0202	maybe i'm look at her life how i would want mine and not how she want it and it it make me feel bad but i i i feel so devastate for her because like when i go to america she say to me she's like oh you're not gonna be back in time for 's first birthday and i'm like well 's not gonna remember me not be there
S0203	yeah yeah
S0202	like you're the only person that's gonna remember it even if you do remember it in twenty years time like it doesn't matter he won't remember it i'll see him after and i just and every time i speak to her she talk about decorate she decorate the live room or she's do this she's do that and i just think it's so fuck bore
S0203	yeah
S0202	but that's me that's
S0203	that that's her life though that's what she love like
S0202	yeah
S0203	that's her passion so you've gotta respect it to a certain point like
S0202	i do respect it but i still feel bad
S0203	i couldn't do it myself and neither could you but
S0202	but that's what make us special person there's not many people who have the same ambition be there like a lot of people amble through life and that's it
S0202	you need to go inside as well fuck freeze erm i'm gonna get another bottle of wine be that alright
