S0334	be you joke me
S0262	all you need be one of these
S0334	do they give you that
S0262	and then
S0334	to buy it
S0262	no but you could do it on your mobile phone if you have to
S0334	what be it three grand
S0262	no it's not i mean i buy it but erm this one he buy for other reason that we be do stuff together like film and everything
S0334	right
S0262	but you don't have to buy that i mean or they say in the guidelines that you can actually use your mobile phone don't know if you know but you've get kind of like a recorder
S0334	yeah
S0262	like a digital recorder
S0262	phone
S0334	yeah
S0262	a lot of people around the uk be use their phone
S0334	so seriously something i could do
S0262	mm yeah dead easily
S0334	d'you have to commit to a certain amount of hours a week
S0262	no
S0334	yeah
S0262	nothing it's just as when you want and when you can do it and when you know just when and when if you can do it you know no there's no pressure on you like i'm do mine monthly but that's only because we wanna earn a little bite of money but you know people might do it sporadically they might go oh i've have a really good conversation with my mum i think they'd quite like to hear that it's quite useful you know diary and conversation
S0334	mm
S0262	or it could be like you know i know you discuss your kid with other mums or
S0334	and so
S0262	that kind of thing
S0334	that's where i might fall down don't think they'd want conversation with me and every day would they
S0262	no
S0262	no unfortunately the child must be over eighteen
S0262	to give consent
S0334	mm
S0262	mm but can be there when he's in the room when you're in the room when it's the adults talk he's there
S0334	and you send that off to somebody who write it all up
S0262	mp3 file
S0334	yeah
S0262	and i do it in a dropbox
S0334	yeah
S0262	there's erm a consent form that you need to get somebody to sign you need to physically take that away with you first okay
S0334	yeah
S0262	and then the only other thing you have to do be there's a record sheet that say i be at my house with cross the box with some other people like my friends and family cross the box
S0334	mm
S0262	format
S0334	mm mm
S0262	you put in how many minutes the conversation last which you'll see from your mp3 file anyway and then you tick a few more box like be it about invite announce it's all very functional
S0334	yeah
S0262	it's
S0334	mm mm
S0262	and it might be like say oh we talk about school this that
S0334	yeah
S0262	job work it's just a basic kind of reference for them to know what the conversation's about
S0334	oh right
S0262	and that's it that's all you have to do that's all do electronically and then you put all of that into a dropbox and then away it go and you get pay your eighteen pound an hour
S0334	i could really do with the cash
S0262	yeah
S0334	and that seem like a way i could do it without

S0334	big thing
S0262	i mean first of all this be a massive expenditure of your financial cost even to try all that surround ivf secondly it's a massive toll on your body
S0334	yeah
S0262	thirdly you're try to keep the full time job
S0334	yeah
S0262	and you're be emotionally bully at the moment
S0334	yeah yeah
S0262	oh my god but she get through it she get lucky first first friend actually
S0334	really
S0262	she be will to go or they be will to go to
S0334	right
S0262	but she get lucky on the first one
S0334	oh ah
S0262	these lovely look
S0334	be she open about
S0262	yeah
S0334	to him as well i know he probably can't understand can he but
S0262	well i wonder i wonder how that's all gonna pan out with her
S0334	yeah
S0262	mm
S0334	i think as long as you don't like you don't have to go into detail
S0262	mm
S0334	too much detail do you but
S0262	mm no
S0334	kid can be quite accept and quite
S0262	they can be but then you know they can sort of they're
S0334	but i think it
S0262	but then lot of people might be single parent you know i mean as in no one sort of bat an eyelid these days
S0334	no okay
S0262	a single mum
S0262	or a single dad
S0334	but that's that's not uncommon be it i suppose the the the bite that be different be
S0262	mm no he be sperm donor
S0334	okay yeah
S0334	yeah that's the bite that
S0262	there must be some legal thing as well they're when he get to eighteen or something he's allow to
S0334	yeah
S0262	get information
S0334	yeah
S0262	about his dad
S0334	yeah
S0262	now whether he can go and meet his dad i don't know but he can certainly get out get information like his name
S0334	i would imagine
S0262	how old he be where he live
S0334	the guy can choose that can't he i i imagine when he make a donation
S0262	mm mm
S0334	that he say never or yes when they're eighteen i guess they've get that control haven't they
S0262	i think he i think they have to by law give basic information about themselves
S0334	yeah
S0262	yeah they have to disclose
S0334	mm
S0262	i suppose on the moral ground be that if the child ever do want to find his biological parent father that's the only way that well i suppose as a society we can't handle it
S0334	mm mm
S0262	otherwise what we're look at be a bunch of kid go but
S0334	mm
S0262	where what hello
S0334	yeah mm
S0262	you know what what happen to that bite you know with my dad you know why why i suppose but i don't know i i mean i can only remember this of course what she tell me
S0334	yeah
S0262	but erm but certainly my another friend of mine erm she be from a different crowd london crowd erm it's just funny how people use facebook these days right
S0262	so i get back from obviously spend six months on the road do this road trip around australia not use facebook a great deal at all

S0334	that's sad isn't it that you have to
S0262	it's different when you're away
S0334	mm erm i absolutely hate it but i i'm not addict to it but i
S0262	mm
S0334	can't get myself off it
S0262	mm i'm the same as you then
S0334	erm
S0262	i'm not happy about it

S0334	yeah yeah the thing i really hate and i don't i don't know about and i don't mean to offend you if you do this
S0262	no
S0334	but i just think it's all about validation
S0262	mm
S0334	it's all people want
S0262	right yeah yeah
S0334	and you see statuses and stuff and you think why why would you put that on there
S0262	mm
S0334	you know you're say how you're feel or
S0262	mm
S0334	something's the amount of people that have put on there about
S0262	crap
S0334	yeah and you just think what be you
S0262	yeah
S0334	after why d'you need
S0262	mm
S0334	twenty people to say be you alright honey
S0262	mm
S0334	what's the matter
S0262	mm mm
S0334	i mean i i dunno i dunno
S0262	the one that i really don't like at all erm erm be i just dunno why i don't like it i don't really have any specific reason just it jar me but erm people have these things about three things that i have to be thankful i would like to be appreciative for
S0334	right
S0262	even the other day do it like quite a long the other day about a month ago and he put you know er er i say first of all it's embarrass

S0262	tell me that that be lovely
S0334	mm
S0262	have know anything about it
S0334	no
S0262	but i really don't get why you're tell all these other people
S0334	yeah
S0262	when internally you're tell yourself why you're so appreciative of life you can share it with someone but why would you share it
S0334	yeah
S0262	with a whole bunch of people who don't even really know you maybe some people be your friends but they're friends from years ago i mean they're only hang about
S0334	yeah yeah
S0262	it's easy to be on on facebook
S0334	yeah
S0262	not like they're gonna give so but people do it
S0334	i know
S0262	i mean there's really different ways of use but that for some reason just lead to
S0334	mm
S0262	i dunno
S0334	yeah i also struggle with like the amount of like now a lot of people would've take photos of the food they're eat
S0334	of each other
S0262	yeah yeah
S0334	look where we be look what we're do and i just think just enjoy what enjoy the moment
S0262	mm
S0334	rather than take photos and and tweet about it or
S0262	mm mm
S0334	you know put it on facebook or whatever
S0262	mm
S0334	just
S0262	yeah
S0334	live it
S0262	just because just cos you can
S0334	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0334	and who care and
S0262	yeah i saw i go to this fascinate thing i know i know i'm gonna calm me down and
S0262	i go to this thing on yesterday morning actually be erm a workshop by yoga i've just start do yoga again
S0334	oh right mm
S0262	erm so i've sign up for i think it be forty pound for unlimited pass for one month
S0334	oh right
S0262	because i'm not work it basically mean that i'm go to
S0334	you're gonna live there day
S0334	no
S0262	yeah cos there's and then there's and i live in so be like you know ten minute drive away so it might be that i go to and then go to one of the even anyway
S0334	get you
S0262	i know
S0262	it's really good for the head yeah the body i'm kinda fold up my mind i'm like go wow this be really cool
S0334	mm mm
S0262	but this thing's call what be consciousness so this thing this lecture i go to it be in college it be lovely i'd never actually
S0334	oh
S0262	be in there and erm something like sixty people in the room i think i it be gonna be that important you know the guy who be hold it and erm he be talk about that cos he really allow lot of people to ask question and he be talk about you know instant online message instant online upload download
S0334	yeah
S0262	whichever way you wanna explain it
S0334	yeah
S0262	it be pretty instant these days i guess
S0334	yeah
S0262	and stuff
S0334	yeah
S0262	organise yourself a bite and then within five minutes everyone could see it and they've already like it
S0334	yes
S0262	obviously less than five minutes
S0334	yeah oh god second
S0262	no yeah second
S0334	second
S0262	yeah so so then you're not really afford you're give yourself the opportunity to live in the present
S0334	mm mm yeah
S0262	but you know what i use to do these class about thirty years ago and that be before the advent of you know all these online mobile instant technologies say even then it be hard to try to persuade people to live in the present
S0334	mm
S0262	but
S0334	yeah
S0262	he say now it's almost impossible to persuade
S0334	yeah
S0262	that that's it's even that it's even actually possible
S0334	yeah
S0262	to live in the present
S0334	yeah
S0262	most people go forget that idea
S0334	yeah
S0262	that's just a rubbish idea there's no way that you can live in the present
S0334	it's sad i find it quite sad
S0262	i suppose when you have kid though it do help to channel the present a lot more because you're attend to their need you know i suppose in a way it's and it's kind of excite and it's an adventure and
S0334	mm
S0262	you know big on this but
S0334	mm
S0262	the good moments you know it's really obviously really really aesthetic about euphoria in a way can imagine erm and i suppose the low mean that you know you're really aware
S0334	yeah
S0262	what's go on
S0334	yeah
S0262	you
S0334	yeah
S0262	so i don't know i just think with that i think be a parent yeah i live a lot more in the present
S0334	mm
S0262	you do quite worry about the future in term of
S0334	yeah
S0262	what your kid be gonna you know
S0334	yeah
S0262	but
S0334	yeah
S0262	but and i guess as they get older they they less about you know the idea of right well have little get you know whatever you know little 's gonna get it for himself hopefully
S0334	yeah
S0262	you know dunno but yeah and i think at certain stag of peoples' live he he be kind of explain that it's just almost impossible to live in the present you know he just feel like that for for what people tell him anyway he just feel that there be certain phase in peoples' live where or potential phase that can happen where people be far remove from the
S0334	mm
S0262	and then he say there's other time it's like an elastic band like i be i be think about when my mum pass away i i live every day as if it be the present you know for age because you you your emotions be just
S0334	yeah
S0262	make you in the present
S0334	yeah
S0262	there's like almost nothing you can do about it
S0334	yeah
S0262	you know it's just really full on erm but then of course that slip away
S0334	mm
S0262	and then you get into the or the past or the future
S0334	yeah
S0262	you know this sort of thing
S0334	yeah
S0262	i hardly ever really talk to people about it it's not one of those conversations that
S0334	it's not though be it that you
S0262	no
S0334	it's kinda deep isn't it
S0262	yeah and also people who be be optimistic they're forward thinkers they'll go oh so what be your plan like you might say
S0334	mm
S0262	to me oh for you and what be your plan or it be like you know another question can be so so what happen in why do you leave you know
S0334	
S0262	you know what
S0334	what do that make me
S0262	i don't know i'm sure that guy would have something to say about it
S0334	yeah
S0262	i'm just take it as
S0334	therapy
S0262	its face value
S0334	therapy
S0262	but it's like but they're all valid question though aren't they i mean it's it's future it's the past it's whatever but yeah i suppose now i'm kind of like i'm in no man's land
S0334	yeah
S0262	so be in no man's land be more important than the future than the past i know i have a past i know i have a future but
S0334	don't you think that'll make a difference if you crave your past though you know
S0262	something that i need to
S0334	yeah
S0262	gosh i meet up with an old school friend
S0334	bitter about things

S0334	yeah
S0262	but but why i mean firstly i'm not that type of person secondly i didn't know you all that well which

S0262	yeah
S0334	and i think it be gonna be a piece of cake
S0262	yeah
S0334	and he say yes fine no problem and i'll get everyone to sort it out so at the moment i'm have email all over the shop
S0262	yeah wrap up in
S0334	from from all his management from his
S0262	sort of pr and yeah and all that
S0334	like can erm can you give us a link to the video i be like oh shit i haven't do it yet

S0262	yeah that's right yeah
S0334	i didn't even know i just
S0262	yeah
S0334	think he'd say it's fine use it

S0334	how naïve be i
S0262	yeah cos there's so many level of
S0334	yeah i didn't realise how involve it be
S0262	yeah ah
S0334	so i have to do a video of erm and use his song so but it's good that i've like get permission
S0262	yeah that's great so it give you the impetus to do it as well
S0334	yeah
S0262	so that's wonderful
S0334	yeah but erm
S0262	so you gonna do like a thirty second thing cos the song's gonna be longer
S0334	yeah no erm
S0262	or it's just gonna be a bite of the song
S0334	i don't know you're into that any ideas
S0262	just just try to think what you're think of
S0334	erm i've look at some others and rather than speak
S0262	mm
S0334	people just hold a card
S0262	yeah
S0334	which have get write on there what they've do
S0262	yeah

S0262	yeah
S0334	that people've do recently
S0262	yeah
S0334	plus photos of the children
S0262	of the kid yeah and the what's the song about be there any sort of theme feel for the song like
S0334	no that's i do look through all his lyric and there isn't really anything that fit
S0262	but be the song quite
S0334	but d'you know chase cars
S0262	yeah yeah
S0334	that's the one that
S0262	okay
S0334	but it's emotive isn't it
S0262	yeah
S0334	and it's use on so many things
S0262	yeah that's
S0334	and it get so many hit
S0262	people really like it yeah yeah
S0334	which be why i go for that cos it's
S0262	yeah i think that sound good i think that sound good
S0334	i do look at some of his others that
S0262	yeah
S0334	aren't so popular and i
S0262	yeah
S0334	i think it's about if people be look for chase cars for any particular reason
S0262	they'd love it yeah exactly
S0334	they'll get that basically as well
S0262	see that be true
S0334	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0334	i mean fourteen million hit
S0262	yeah d'you know the best person to ask i'm really out of i'm really out of touch with all this stuff i tell you who i'll do i'll i'll do be i'll ask cos
S0334	what do do
S0262	he's spend
S0334	what be he do now
S0262	he be a connoisseur of the internet that's what i call him because he have literally spend since when he lose his job which be in august two thousand and twelve when we get back
S0334	yeah
S0262	after lose mum then as we be go way back to australia we have to divert to to new zealand
S0334	i remember you say
S0262	because his mum be on her deathbed but she didn't pass away and she's still alive
S0334	oh wow
S0262	erm but it be touch and go and then erm about two weeks after we get back he say to me they're make me redundant and i just think do yeah okay just pile it on why don't you
S0262	i'm just gonna go to the beach
S0262	i don't
S0334	oh
S0262	so yeah since then he's do everything and anything
S0334	right
S0262	he's like he's be dip in and out of everything like he's get such a curiosity it be incredible i don't have patience for it
S0262	so i go just give me the simple
S0262	and some of the stuff he do get and he like his apps he like all of his videos he like all his book he's do he's
S0334	right yeah

S0262	hang hang on i'll qualify that
S0262	it's not a it's not fiction any more you know it's like it's one of those self help kinda guide kinda book and erm i say okay so erm cos all through the six months we'd be think about change of career
S0334	yeah
S0262	change of lifestyle change of everything and it just go like that and then of course you get back to you know though it's not really gonna work out like that
S0334	mm
S0262	because there be parameters
S0334	yeah
S0262	within your life
S0334	it's normally money isn't it
S0262	yeah exactly and yeah and i suppose you know where you're gonna be what you're gonna do so anyway he say well one thing that you've be always talk about be write write write write write write and i be like yeah yeah i love write i love write
S0334	mm
S0262	and i be get piss off cos i've be do my master in education which i've just finish
S0334	right
S0262	and erm he erm i be go on a bang bang on about i've lose touch with the real sense of mean cos everything that couldn't you know write postgrad stuff
S0334	mm
S0262	it's all academic stuff that
S0334	yeah yeah
S0262	doesn't like turn turn me on
S0334	yeah
S0262	all that much so i be like well i just wanna write and er tell to an audience he be like okay how about if you write a book on small talk and i go
S0262	small talk it's hardly an inspirational thing
S0262	he go yeah but think about it you'd be really good at that
S0262	so i be like oh yes i have a couple of coupla days to think about that think actually yeah i could talk the hind er hind leg off a donkey
S0262	and anything i know about small talk i get from my granny you know
S0334	yeah
S0262	so i be think alright i can just write like a four or five page sort of you know chapter and you know and and and sort of get away with it a bite and then maybe you know yeah i'll i'll say i've write something anyway i and then six days later he's like have you write your first chapter yet write the first chapter i've do eight
S0262	i do sixteen thousand word
S0334	oh my god
S0262	with link to little youtube videos about
S0334	really
S0262	there's this one about those two guy who be really really famous erm comedians but they're they're more modern than like you know erm the guy that know but they do one about grunt for erm for cavemen and it be how small talk get start
S0334	right
S0262	right it's a great little clip it's a youtube video but so i put in bits like that and then i start go into sort of like the stuff i do know which be about functional language and then put it up and and he's find a cover photo and you know it's somehow we edit it and somehow it get into a a sort of a new book and then somehow it get be put on ekindle and somehow that's on amazon and somehow somehow somehow now
S0262	i've get twenty five review
S0334	really
S0262	like twenty three of them five star
S0334	wow
S0262	one of them's four star and the other one's two and a half star and he just say oh i just didn't have the heart to finish it which be sort of like fair enough least he be honest
S0334	yeah
S0262	dunno why you write a review then if you haven't finish it but but it and then it's like number one in its category and it it there be so many categories in amazon i've get to say that
S0262	but still it's at number one in that category and number five in that erm and he's jazz it up again make it look better so i'll have i don't know how much it's sell and i don't know how dear how much money it's make but erm certainly erm it's where you get this idea of passive income this be what people talk about
S0262	be you put quite a big thing like an effort into it
S0334	yeah
S0262	but then through a sort of amazon market thing which be what 's really good at do erm he's make a little website about social skills
S0334	oh really
S0262	he's make little tweet he's make little erm he's make like a little audio version now he think it need to be make into audio book on this app call so we're gonna get who's get this lovely sexy voice and her boyfriend actually
S0262	who's get a lovely sexy voice to to actually do the the dialogue in it the small talk dialogue that i'd actually create
S0262	so it's like that's just a little project
S0334	wow
S0262	and it really doesn't take much money and it doesn't take much
S0334	no
S0262	it do take time
S0334	time
S0262	but not as much time as one would imagine if if in a way it's like yeah write will take time edit take a bite of time
S0334	yeah
S0262	but if you've get like a little team of people
S0334	yeah
S0262	they're all just task with their little things so he's the 's the kind of guy who think internet
S0334	mm
S0262	social media
S0334	yeah
S0262	he know all these people now as well
S0334	yeah
S0262	do sort of stuff like
S0334	yeah
S0262	they're either try to get their businesses off the grind or they're try to do stuff for charities or do this and this and this i should ask him i should ask him for you and just go well you know if you be do thirty second which be what you be think
S0334	a minute
S0262	a minute okay
S0334	maybe a bite more yeah
S0262	through this song which be
S0334	yeah
S0262	really well know
S0334	yeah
S0262	what would you do you know and maybe he'll come up with some ideas cos i sort of know what you mean it's kinda like it make me think of that erm u2 video where they have they're on the on the car they've get the little card
S0334	i've not see it
S0262	that one
S0334	not see it
S0262	i'm pretty sure it be u2 they're on a so they've get like happy smiley face or sad face i think they've actually get photos of the other people erm who be come next in in you'd have to see it but it's really fluid
S0334	right
S0262	it's very fluid but there be card like white card
S0334	right
S0262	and the card have get smile face caricature whatever
S0334	okay
S0262	it's quite interest it's always change
S0334	yeah
S0262	erm so i i imagine it be something like that be that you know you've get people
S0334	yeah
S0262	because it's chase cars i be wonder whether
S0334	mm
S0262	you could sort of make some dynamic movement in it which be like kind of make me think of that u2 where there's
S0334	yeah
S0262	they're on the back of a car but it's move very slowly it mean that your scenery's change
S0334	yeah
S0334	yeah
S0262	it's change so i dunno but i'll ask
S0334	ah yeah
S0262	cos like i'm i'm like million miles away from this stuff
S0334	well it's so i find it so difficult to get my head round i mean
S0262	yeah
S0334	twitter i mean i it's probably not worth me have the account i do something maybe once a week people be do tweet
S0262	oh i know
S0334	numerous time a day
S0262	i know yeah
S0334	but what i have nothing to tweet about i don't know what to put
S0262	no no
S0334	if you're famous people wanna know what you've have for breakfast
S0262	yeah
S0334	but when you're not
S0262	yeah
S0334	don't really care
S0262	yeah the question to ask be particularly i suppose like what i've see with he's tweet when he erm want to tell people say for example he'll move the shift the price of the book around
S0334	right
S0262	so sometimes it can be four dollars twenty four cents sometimes it's one dollar twenty four cents sometimes it's actually free he can choose and pick and choose how to get people interest
S0334	mm
S0262	so it's never gonna stay at one natural price it's gonna be kind of like up and down and i've see him with the tweet he go in like reduce price one dollar twenty four for this book
S0334	yeah
S0262	then oh now reduce again oh get your free coffee if you be an amazon membership you can actually i dunno i dunno what he do but he use it so he give the little url link
S0334	yeah
S0262	to the small talk work

S0262	he say to me that small talk book you laugh in my face
S0262	you don't know anything about anyone who be anywhere you don't know anything about these people
S0334	that's true
S0262	you don't know anything about them they could be sit there sad lonely
S0262	like oh god here we go
S0262	my heart's really go out to these people
S0262	but literally you don't know anything about them so why don't you write for people as if you didn't know a lot about them write inclusively you're good at inclusive write
S0334	mm
S0262	you know you have that mindset that you don't want to exclude
S0334	yeah
S0262	and it's true the way i've write it i i really really work hard to make this not a gender specific thing or a he or a she thing or a black or a white thing
S0334	yeah
S0262	or a you know i'm really really i spend i spend most of the time just go oh i want this to everyone
S0334	yeah
S0262	if a if a fifteen year old pick it up
S0334	yeah
S0262	to a fifty year old who i want everyone to say i like this book and i can see the review come through and like people be so generous with their feedback
S0334	mm
S0262	i'm like you're a nice man you say some really nice things
S0262	and it be like i didn't even i didn't even see that in what i'd write you know and erm so that's now i understand that
S0334	yeah
S0262	i can't i can't anticipate that much from people
S0334	no
S0262	i can't expect things from them i can't expect high or low things i can't expect anything from anyone because there's so many people in the world so you can't
S0334	yeah
S0262	well you can talk to your neighbour or you can talk to your friend but maybe but but the person live the other side of the world
S0334	mm
S0262	or d'you know what i mean
S0334	mm
S0262	i just don't know so i wonder whether if you if you be interest in what you could do be like this be how probably would do it it go if you if you kind of like have a three pronged kind of effect which be cos i've always be get at you about this
S0334	mm
S0262	i know i have i've say it from the begin and i be like we all wanna know about and you be like no no no i don't wanna i
S0262	i just remember you go like not about me
S0334	still not about me
S0262	and you're like go no no no no so if it's not about then it's about the people who support the
S0334	the video
S0262	yeah it's about
S0334	yeah
S0262	people who support
S0334	well that's the only thing i could think of
S0262	yeah
S0334	it's not necessarily about them
S0262	yeah
S0334	i just need to be able to make a video all i could think of
S0262	yeah yeah yeah which be you know a good place to start i mean videos be very very popular
S0334	yeah
S0262	you know there's i suppose the thing be be that the way be cos he couldn't be bother to make a video see if you can have something that go laterally with it cos a lot of people like that guy who get really famous from you know those short that you be tell me about that
S0334	yeah
S0262	guy i think i know that guy who you mean but he didn't just make little videos he make like little resources
S0334	mm
S0262	you gotta download things
S0334	yeah
S0262	he he like have this like you know join up think and i i suppose if you're come in from wherever most people be try to say right there's something on twitter
S0334	mm
S0262	there's something on youtube
S0334	yeah
S0262	you know something maybe on facebook isn't right i don't think facebook work in term of sell stuff
S0334	no no it's not the best
S0262	he put he put put facebook and we get a nom de plume call okay
S0334	you get what
S0262	so that i i write under a nom de plume okay
S0334	okay
S0262	cos of my grandmother
S0334	right
S0262	and be because it be sort of 's great aunt or something like that as a surname
S0334	okay
S0262	and just one night we'd have a few drink he be like alright
S0262	it's still to this day
S0262	but erm but anyway so we put it all up that we be about to launch this book well he do anyway i hardly use facebook and a lot of our friends particularly ones who be far away from who don't see us like new zealand they just couldn't understand what be go on they can't understand why be advertise a book for somebody who didn't mean anything to them
S0262	be on a subject that seem a bite weird
S0262	and they can actually say to him all the time stop send us this book
S0262	we feel like we're get spam
S0262	we don't know who be until one of them the smart one say don't you know that 's
S0262	and then they be like oh right
S0262	and go like that i be like oh god i say please don't ever do that again on facebook don't don't do it
S0334	no
S0262	because it confuse our friends it's also like cos it's something we're sell it put a sort of slight edge on our friendships which i don't want to be push
S0334	down
S0262	people's throats you know well we're not push it down people's throats we're just ask for a favour he say yeah but there's favour and favour
S0334	yeah
S0262	that's not the sort of favour that i wanna actually ask anyone
S0334	no
S0262	say oh why not i just say because i just wouldn't do it i say
S0334	yeah
S0262	so
S0334	yeah
S0262	difference there but he he's agree facebook doesn't get you anywhere
S0334	no i agree
S0262	it doesn't get you where you wanna be but i think the powerful ones be like you say it's like youtube but what i think he would probably say as well be that they're all short erm yeah that's for me yeah thank you they're all short erm bits of information about the charity
S0334	yeah
S0262	it's what people want you know they thank you they they do wanna know they they wanna see a video but they also wanna see
S0334	mm
S0262	where's this come from why be there
S0262	what's it do you've get those you do your newsletters you know
S0334	yeah
S0262	you've get all of the stuff about how it all start where you be and milestones you know you've get like a kind of quite a er like a span now
S0334	mm
S0262	quite a long time
S0334	yeah
S0262	to show people that this isn't just a flash in the pan one minute charity that's you know here today go tomorrow this be something that's you know it's be around for a while and should be around for a lot longer
S0334	yeah
S0262	cos of the work it's do
S0334	and it and i think it's timely i don't know if you've hear about erm d'you hear about the charity beat bully they be give seven hundred thousand pound by i don't know if it be i think it be like the text santa appeal last christmas
S0262	right okay don't know if have
S0334	and they've go bust
S0262	they've get what
S0334	they've go bust they've get no money they're in financial erm difficulties and they've get erm they're be look at by the charity commission
S0262	why
S0334	cos they're question where that money's go where have seven hundred thousand pound go in a year
S0262	where do it come from the money
S0334	the people the public
S0262	from a national
S0334	from text santa
S0334	and you donate
S0262	alright
S0334	like five pound there be a thing on tv at christmas time and beat bully another charity which be er manage by them be two of the charities that benefit from all the money that be raise i don't know how much be raise in total but seven hundred grand go to these two charities erm
S0262	seven hundred grand
S0334	and now they're they're have to have erm what be they call erm people that go in and
S0262	yeah like erm oh i know what you mean i can't think either
S0334	do liquidation or something
S0262	yeah yeah
S0334	but you you know what i mean
S0262	investigate
S0334	they're be investigate
S0262	yeah
S0334	so i think people have lose a lot of faith in these big charities cos you kinda question how that how can that happen how could you spend more and be you know where's it go just where's it go so erm i dunno but that the problem be they have a reputation and they have to they do have credibility and all the rest of it when you
S0262	yeah
S0334	have a charity that nobody know
S0262	yeah yeah that's the thing
S0334	this
S0262	yeah yeah
S0334	people don't they'll always put their
S0262	yeah
S0334	faith in it but on the plus side people do want to
S0262	to give money
S0334	and make a difference
S0262	yeah yeah exactly
S0334	and know that it's go
S0262	yeah yeah
S0334	directly to
S0262	yeah yeah
S0334	and it's not get lose in you know other cost so
S0262	do any small charities erm i've i've never see it but in my mind i know erm that i'm a person who support individuals as in they head up a charity
S0334	yeah
S0262	you know a local charity or international charity but it's the individual for me that make all the difference
S0334	mm
S0262	erm because i need that kind of contact with the person to to understand
S0334	yeah
S0262	and to er not to understand but just to sort of feel like a human warmth right a kind of contact you know
S0334	yeah
S0262	erm and though i may never ever visit that particular place or the children or whatever but it would be lovely to but it's not essential for me because
S0334	yeah
S0262	in a way i have contact with the
S0334	yeah
S0262	individual
S0334	yeah
S0262	so that kind of mean that i get but i wonder because like when i think about people that be support and and their charities good charities i should say i'm always look for ways to i suppose thematically i be very interest in children you know the type of charities i support
S0334	yeah
S0262	be pretty much always student student
S0262	woo
S0262	my students i've be write this paper about bloody university students
S0334	yeah okay
S0262	so i wonder if there be like thematically you know erm a way of draw together the sort of the overall benefit in a world that when we have somebody like you know and your charities work in ecuador and and the surround environment and then you've get another person who's probably quite a standalone charity as it's really a one man band
S0334	mm
S0262	yeah you've get supporters and trustees but i wonder if there's narratives there i wonder if there's kind of cross section and this isn't for the video this be
S0334	mm
S0262	this be just me think off the top of my head that people could probably when they think about oh could actually give fifty quid to to could give fifty quid to
S0334	mm
S0262	but these two kind of combine their thoughts their ideas they could be one could be in africa and one in south america there's something about this idea of people see this sense of community
S0334	mm
S0262	and i don't mean it in a blah blah community
S0334	yeah
S0262	kinda way it's kinda like these be these be people who be work their sock off and how how do that link together that this be kind of an idea of erm synergy in the world cos that give you a good feel
S0334	mm
S0262	like if you've just a one man if you're just one person who only ever give money to erm children in need whatever it be and that all get syphon off to different charities
S0334	yes
S0262	apparently anyway it's like how do the little charities the lower charities whatever how do they actually compete
S0334	we don't
S0262	yeah
S0334	we can't
S0262	you can't exactly so you've get a different sort of message you've get a different way of explain why this be more or as important as than
S0334	but why as as joe public why would you choose over oxfam why would you i can't
S0262	well
S0334	i'm try to say well i i know what i would do
S0262	yeah
S0262	well this be why i think erm i i do choose because i i think i erm always look at the person and their their story i'm very focus on the stories like not story as in make up story
S0334	mm
S0262	part of the idea be that you know i know i know how get start you know i don't know anything about it now but
S0334	but if you if you didn't know me
S0262	yeah
S0334	and you be look to support something
S0262	well i know why i think this be what part of me be i wish i could bloody do that it's just like what i say to people like do what you've do when i say to people oh and i have you know i've give up my job at university we're go off on a six month tour round australia i'm forty my other forty year old something friends just look at me huh
S0262	gobsmacked and they go huh huh i'm really jealous
S0262	oh i would never do anything like that not ever in a month of sundays
S0262	huh huh
S0262	like this and i say course you could do it if you really want to do it if you really want to do it of course you could do it you could do anything you want in your
S0334	yeah
S0262	with your life you're privilege you've get money you can do this you've get
S0334	yeah
S0262	brain you know you can do anything you want you're really really lucky like i be i'm just make good use of it that's all in a sense that i wanna go out and live it
S0334	yeah
S0262	but i could easily stay here for six months and do a job you know
S0334	yeah
S0262	it's like choice and erm oh no it's not that easy it's like it's like people wanna learn how other people make that step that's the story for it's like when you tell me about how get it get start it wasn't like you know everything to start off with you didn't
S0334	no
S0262	know exactly how it be gonna be and this
S0334	no
S0262	be gonna happen and that be gonna happen it be like i have a a nuance of an idea we be gonna take a long time to get to where it get to to even become a charity
S0334	yeah
S0262	then when it do and take off so i think people be interest because in a sort of way they have maybe a dream a fantasy
S0334	mm
S0262	a kind of make believe world where they might think mm if i be a slightly different person
S0262	i could be like her
S0334	mm
S0262	but i know i'm never gonna be like her but i'd like to think i could be so that's why i'm interest i think there be sometimes quite a me kind of erm story people buy into other people's narratives cos they somehow want to
S0334	yeah
S0262	move that into their own live though there may be very tenuous very weak
S0334	yeah
S0262	connection they're something like go oh so i go to back in i know
S0334	mm
S0262	you be like yeah you do you see erm no
S0262	but you know it doesn't mean that
S0334	yeah
S0262	there's some kind of hook there's some kind of link and i think people would go for that because it's actually something that they could i think with oxfam you can't grasp it it's too big
S0334	yeah
S0262	almost it's so massive people get freak out about the the the problem be too big
S0334	yeah
S0262	even if you think about it from what oxfam be try to achieve and of course they're very good at little of narratives
S0334	yeah
S0262	but even then you're a bite bombard with the whole massive like world scale problem of
S0334	yeah
S0262	famine and x
S0334	yeah
S0262	y and z so at least with like smaller charities or you know like home grow charities it's like oh okay so this be quite a clearly define problem
S0334	mm
S0262	cos you couldn't obviously take on the whole of ecuador
S0334	not yet not yet
S0262	but but even this be quite a small problem this be how this problem's be erm this be how the question's be ask the problem this be how people be start to look at it
S0334	yeah
S0262	this be how people be start to try and answer some question
S0334	yeah
S0262	and this be the type of work that be actually go round you know try to answer these problems and question cos it be about question it's like
S0334	yeah
S0262	who who who you know would get there on the grind they'd think oh erm say if you be show a dignitary around erm er on the grind you know you show them around and cos they wouldn't
S0334	yeah
S0262	know anything about it so
S0334	no
S0262	you be like go here's the problem we know it's a problem because
S0334	yeah
S0262	and this be what we're do about it
S0334	yeah
S0262	and this be some of the result that we're get i mean i think that in a way small small charities be an easier job because i think they can be quite confine
S0334	yeah
S0262	as in
S0334	yeah
S0262	message message bore bore i go oh yeah if i give my fifty quid i'm not think about how much i can get for that fifty quid
S0334	mm
S0262	i'm think about that fifty quid it's for something that solve a problem
S0334	yeah and you feel like you're really involve in that don't you
S0262	yeah and you've get to trust in the other way that people be solve problems
S0334	mm
S0262	you wanna put your hand up and volunteer and say i can help you solve a problem that's up to you but
S0334	mm
S0262	at least you're say i'm put my fifty quid down because there be a problem there i understand it and these people be help solve that problem
S0334	mm
S0262	good
S0334	yeah
S0262	fifty quid there you go do five quid do what i can't stand with these big charities be the emotional erm the pathos behind it you know the pull
S0334	yeah
S0262	oh your heart string
S0334	yeah
S0262	and i hate the way they go so erm financial commercialist for one pound twenty four you'll be able to buy this for ten pound a month you'll be able to
S0334	mm
S0334	but that's that's really weird because a lot of people say to me i want to know what my ten pound will get they wanna they really do wanna know it's gonna buy so and so
S0262	do people say that
S0334	yeah
S0262	and d'you know how to answer that question yet
S0334	erm
S0262	truthfully cos i think sometimes i wonder how much oxfam lie about that or the other big ones they know the unit price for something they don't know the actual price cos you've get the flight in for the stuff you know all the variables it's like
S0334	yeah
S0262	okay they can say it's ten pound but the volunteer how much be they worth
S0334	yeah
S0262	if this be almost a it's a never end circle of a of i think if you go down that road it's hard for you to remain keep your integrity about it
S0334	yeah
S0262	cos price change as well
S0334	do anybody think about that deeply i think i can say to people okay your ten pound a month will
S0262	yeah
S0334	pay for erm can't even think like a week of meals one
S0262	yeah
S0334	day
S0262	yeah
S0334	that's just
S0262	yeah
S0334	an example
S0262	yeah
S0334	they wouldn't i don't think they'd then go away and think well that's gonna cost different in a week after because
S0262	no they wouldn't they wouldn't they wouldn't but in a way what you're do be you're mirror what the bigger charities do
S0334	yeah
S0262	and i'm have a pop at the bigger charities not at the concept of you say
S0334	yeah
S0262	but i do actually fundamentally ask the question why do we need to know exactly like an accountant who say that we have to think like accountants why do we ask these question who's tell us that we have to these question
S0334	mm
S0262	be it because i'm sit there actually have my coffee and go i could buy this coffee or i could now donate that money and put that coffee to i could
S0334	but
S0262	three pound fifty i'm gonna get
S0334	don't you think that turn it on its head and people would see that i'm waste three pound fifty on this coffee when actually look at how much you could do over there
S0262	yeah i i do think it be about that i think there be an element of that and er that make sense for some people erm what i think be be that yeah but erm er from my understand be charities get start like say for example be that you saw a real life problem with your eye
S0334	yeah
S0262	you've perceive you've sense it you've touch it
S0334	yeah
S0262	you've talk to those parent you've talk to those children this be real for you as real as it be for them it's a share reality
S0334	yeah but that's part of the problem though
S0262	yeah
S0334	other people haven't have that and aren't affect by that
S0262	yeah yeah
S0334	i i don't think you can ever
S0262	but but you're experience that you've be able to articulate and tell people that this be what the problem be you know i've put the question to myself what be the problem here and try really hard
S0334	mm
S0262	to answer it you can't raise money willy nilly for things but you don't
S0334	no
S0262	know what the problem be and even how to answer it you've have to think really hard about how to answer that problem and that be something you can communicate to your well wishers and supporters they can't lose sight money yes money be one thing it's a kind of erm to me it's like a triangle of money be just a part of why interest in charities
S0334	mm
S0262	what i'd like to believe be that people probably do have three level of erm connect with a charity one be the intellectual argument
S0334	uhu
S0262	another be probably emotional response
S0334	yeah
S0262	and probably the third one be about integrity it's the integrity of the charity
S0334	mm
S0262	and what it stand for
S0334	yeah
S0262	which still probably come round to the logic of what be the problem
S0334	yeah
S0262	and how be we answer it and what be the problems about try to answer this problem
S0334	yeah
S0262	you know question they're some of the things that people actually if they if they're gonna be more like a lifetime supporter i would hope that people engage with your charity like on the
S0334	mm
S0262	one of those
S0334	yeah
S0262	not two
S0334	yeah
S0262	but those people can just go oh yeah you know on that day three pound fifty oh yeah you're right i'll forgo my coffee and make myself feel better at
S0334	yeah
S0262	half an hour but i'm still gonna go and buy coffee
S0334	yeah
S0262	i mean those sort of people i i don't really understand because again
S0334	mm
S0262	but that doesn't mean to say they're not valuable because they be
S0334	yeah
S0262	cos they will get and give you money but it depend what your video be try to achieve i mean i would've think the the previous example like the emotion
S0334	yeah
S0262	the argument
S0334	yeah
S0262	the integrity of er of the charity these be things that make up
S0334	mm i guess it's how you put those things into a video though isn't it
S0262	you wouldn't yeah you wouldn't
S0334	but no you need to i'd want to be able to put a bite of that in
S0262	well animation's very popular and i wonder if there be something where you could have so you've get people who be and rather than write something on the little white card imagine that there be a person with the white card so you can see their face or whatever they do and then on the white card rather than have something write like the reality that you've write it
S0334	mm
S0262	you could actually have a little charity er sorry little animation play out on that white piece of paper
S0334	right
S0262	that these days there be software program
S0262	no no no i know
S0262	but no but you get the person to if they if they're interest
S0262	you could ask the ask the person say look erm i'm do a video i wanna make it more animate because i know that you know things that move
S0334	mm
S0262	appeal to a younger generation as well so you've gotta think of them erm and there be software er apps i mean i've play around with a couple you just put in they're little stick men
S0334	yeah
S0262	you just put it this be me with the little hair big blue eye whatever not even colour you don't even have to do that what do do well she go off to you know pick some apples off a tree you know you put tree apples and it just basically it just make the animation all for you
S0262	it's incredible and you can get quite specific with it but that i would say something which be a bite more dynamic
S0334	yeah
S0262	appeal to it it's quite nice because in a way yeah you would probably have to have someone who would edit it together but
S0334	mm
S0262	when you make a video anyway you still need an editor
S0334	yeah
S0262	regardless
S0334	yeah
S0262	and most editors do know about animation you know they would know how to put that on top of the white card you know you'd need somebody who isn't basic editor yeah somebody maybe a little intermediate
S0334	yeah
S0262	but you know maybe that's somebody that you know maybe somebody who could volunteer to do that minute it could be forty second
S0334	mm
S0262	you know you're not ask a lot from an editor you're you know you're talk about a few people perhaps
S0334	no
S0262	but i'm just think about some way to bring it to life
S0334	yeah
S0262	have a little dynamic colour sense to it so say there's zambathon a sorry a sunbathon
S0334	zumbathon yeah
S0262	you can imagine that in animation
S0334	yeah
S0262	you know little stick men women
S0334	yeah
S0262	dance whatever they're do you could see that it'd be quite funny to watch
S0334	yeah
S0262	you know
S0334	it's a really good idea
S0262	mm i dunno i'm not sure
S0334	mm
S0262	but there be there's stuff out there for free this stuff be good
S0334	yeah
S0262	you know i dunno just think off the top of my head but erm yeah you know and in a way you know the the message be what exactly and that's the whole thing about video be that
S0334	yeah
S0262	the ones that really resonate have get a really strong message like the purpose behind the video be very clear
S0334	yeah yeah
S0262	you know so
S0334	obviously i'm reluctant that heart string thing i don't think always work
S0262	no
S0334	but i dunno i don't know really i don't know i think you you wanna see some positivity don't you
S0262	you do you wanna see result and you know say if you be use a video as erm a little way to sort of draw in the community of together again you know it might be might've start to unravel a little bite over the sort of past couple of years and what we really just try to do be you know pull sort of er the crowd back in together erm and and get a little bite of oomph back into it you know kick
S0334	yeah
S0262	kick it into into touch a little bite more and so that would be quite plausible because then people would watch the video and go oh that's like 's friend i meet that you know or or that you know yeah i i yeah that's a little bite more about hold up a mirror
S0334	yeah
S0262	to people
S0334	yeah
S0262	i think people can engage with that but if say if it wasn't the message wasn't or the intention wasn't there it say it be about actually try to draw awareness to a whole new crowd of people that would be a completely different
S0334	mm
S0262	type of video
S0334	yeah
S0262	it would have you know different story it would have a different it depend really on what you're try to achieve with it i think the video idea's really good it's just about you know what's my purpose who be my key audience
S0334	yeah
S0262	that sorta thing
S0334	yeah
S0262	and it could be it could be that it's just draw the the supporters back in just say okay you know remember and we have these ideas now we're look for some new ones or you've already get new ideas but you're look for people to put their hand up and go yeah i i kind of that one resonate
S0334	mm
S0262	but me i'd like to do that one so these could be new card like write your own card you know it could be somebody at the end go you know in a year's time this could be on this this video it's kind like question mark you or you know or your own animation question mark or you know anything where you're actually say to someone the message be you can engage with me and the er charity you you can come towards me i'm open for you to come towards me and
S0334	yeah
S0262	and you know discuss your ideas or whatever
S0334	another good idea
S0262	dunno
S0262	have a glass of wine a coffee now so
S0262	kinda reach my peak there er it's gonna be downhill
S0334	no your peak's a lot higher than mine trust me
S0262	oh no
S0334	it's for me
S0262	yeah yeah
S0334	i do have to get crack though need to
S0262	why d'you feel like you have to get crack
S0334	just because of well maybe i don't but i want to do something by christmas
S0262	yeah okay yeah
S0334	it's a good time as well it's the time of year to
S0262	it be yeah
S0334	get people
S0262	yeah
S0334	unfortunately
S0262	yeah
S0334	that's true
S0262	yeah that's true and d'you think there would be something off the back of it that a bite you know like an event or something that's quite you know tangible
S0334	erm
S0262	that you could kinda ride the connection between video and or this be there be there any kinda like new kind of a something on the horizon next year that you can kinda tantalize people with and say to find out more about you know x you know i don't know you have all these ideas that you know you say that you're the trustees come and maybe maybe there's one or two that i really wanna put that in the video
S0334	yeah
S0262	cos i want people to see if it resonate with people
S0334	yeah
S0262	i wanna see people pick up on it so you can kind of like tease people but also you inform them but also kind of see if you can get a reaction from them
S0334	mm
S0262	too
S0334	yeah yeah
S0262	yeah sound like a lotta hard work
S0334	it do
S0334	a really good idea and
S0262	yeah
S0334	you can get carry away and there's so many things i've gotta do but
S0262	yeah
S0334	and i just think
S0262	gotta just pick one
S0334	can't do it
S0262	yeah well which be the easiest one to do though i mean if you be just to go okay i could i could actually do that one get it do by christmas maybe maybe the video one or be there
S0334	in my mind the most simple thing be to film a person hold the card
S0262	yeah yeah
S0334	i can do that
S0262	yeah yeah
S0334	so maybe it's a pretty poor attempt but as long as it doesn't well i dunno i don't know whether how it would look at the end of the day but
S0262	yeah
S0334	if it doesn't look too amateurish then it's a start
S0262	well what music
S0334	yeah
S0262	then i think i think i suppose the thing be that if they're that lot they're the record company whatever i suppose they wanna they wanna know what the content
S0334	yeah
S0262	of the thing's gonna look like
S0334	yeah
S0262	yeah so anything that's probably you know quite straightforward for them be gonna look great because then they can go okay this
S0334	mm
S0262	she's not you know
S0334	no no
S0262	so as long as you can sort of like you know tame their fear like whatever then you're gonna get the song and that's
S0334	yeah
S0262	gonna go a long way
S0334	yeah
S0262	it's gonna go a long long way
S0334	mm mm
S0262	so in a way maybe it be maybe it be more about that maybe it's more about that maybe it's more about the name or the song erm and just play around with it play around with that idea
S0334	yeah
S0262	d'you know anyone who's get that kind of edit technical kind of skills
S0334	well 's husband do a bite of it
S0262	yeah
S0334	erm i don't know what he use or what he do but
S0262	yeah
S0334	he do he's in a band and i think he do a lot of videos for them so yeah yeah i could get
S0262	good to just run things past and just see where their skills
S0334	yeah
S0262	oh yeah i could run that off for you you know you only want what fifty second
S0334	yeah
S0262	that will take me a couple of hours you've gotta get the footage
S0334	yeah
S0262	but for me to put it together and just put it to the right part of the lyric and so on
S0334	yeah
S0262	i mean to be honest with you i mean i know you don't have the time to do it but these days they edit so easily
S0334	mm yeah
S0262	really like probably in a few years you know 's gonna be able to
S0262	they've even get an app now right where you can get just any old bits of video from the phone
S0334	really
S0262	and it make it into a proper professional look youtube video not just a home movie style
S0334	oh cos facebook do something like that didn't they
S0262	yeah
S0334	they take all your photos
S0262	yeah
S0334	and
S0262	it's amaze
S0334	mm
S0262	it's amaze what these things can do i mean it's just
S0334	mm
S0262	you know the level of professionalism of just be
S0334	yeah
S0262	to look good
S0334	yeah
S0262	so imagine you know if you've get that app you will you might not even need to have i don't know
S0334	mm
S0262	but what i'm say be that there's so many free things out
S0334	yeah
S0262	there to use you just need someone to put you in the right direction
S0334	yeah and obviously i've never do it before so i don't really know
S0262	yeah and you just don't know
S0334	no no that's it
S0262	you don't want to spend hours
S0334	no
S0262	go through it you just want someone to say download that use that put that on there and then away you go bob's your uncle
S0334	yeah
S0262	you know well i'll certainly ask i'll say i'll say i'll you know if he's get any ideas
S0334	yeah it'd be interest to see what his thoughts be
S0262	yeah
S0334	well it's good to get people's perspective as well
S0334	when you're in it you can't always
S0262	yeah it be good to get people's
S0334	you know see what they should be do you know
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0334	that'd be cool erm
S0262	so wasn't there somebody who be out there for a little while though er wasn't there someone
S0262	no no there there be the triathlon guy wasn't there he do the triathlon
S0334	that be recently

S0262	that's it
S0334	be that it
S0262	yeah and how do that go

S0334	i would but i dunno i'd be worry about take them really worry
S0262	yeah
S0334	not until they're maybe i could take them till they're ten and know what's go and can themselves a little bite sound terrible
S0262	yeah
S0334	isn't it sound really posh but
S0262	no i'd like that
S0334	bite of a snob
S0262	i i no i i completely like that
S0334	they'd get ill they'd if i go now they'd get ill
S0262	yeah yeah yeah i've meet these parent who go oh no we just take them anywhere we throw them in the back
S0262	whatever i'm like
S0334	i don't know how people do it
S0262	i don't know how people do it actually i suppose they just go they they push back to society and say oh you know society say don't do that don't do that cos that's just too dangerous it's too risky and they're probably just rebel a little bite i dunno but i don't need to if i have children and i you know i be face with that kind of sort of decision to make to rebel i'd just go no
S0334	no
S0262	that's not worth it
S0334	i mean
S0262	my child's life
S0334	just a simple thing about travel
S0262	yeah
S0334	from the airport to the wherever you're go or i mean i've be the bus there and absolutely terrify absolutely terrify i there be one time i think that's it i'm gonna die this be it
S0262	god
S0334	so why would i then put my child in that position
S0262	no you wouldn't you know
S0334	there's no car seat there's no prams there's nothing
S0262	no it's it's really it's really it's really really bad yeah
S0334	it's just the simple things yeah
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0334	i can choose they can't
S0262	and that's the thing so you've get a you you know what it's like on the grind until you've really be there and do it and see
S0334	yeah
S0262	what it's like you you people have no idea i mean i wouldn't clearly from what you know you're tell me
S0334	mm
S0262	i've probably haven't be anywhere quite like that before
S0334	mm
S0262	so you know i mean i've gotta remind myself it be what the second poorest country in i dunno it move up and down a bite doesn't it
S0334	yeah
S0262	but i mean it's an extremely poor country
S0334	yeah
S0262	yeah so
S0334	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0334	yeah one day though one day
S0262	yeah one day
S0334	when they're old when they're old enough to understand it as well i want them to to really know what it's all about
S0262	well this be it you don't want them to go there and go
S0334	where's the beach where's the arcade machine
S0334	no it's not gonna happen
S0262	well that's right when they're all glue to their whatever it will be in a few years' time yeah right you lot bugger off
S0334	yeah
S0262	and you're not gonna bring any well you can but you'll see if it work like that cos it won't
S0334	yeah
S0262	but you can take your photos and videos and back to school tell them all where you've be
S0334	when you're bang on about get the latest
S0262	yeah the latest
S0334	train and everything
S0262	yeah exactly
S0334	yeah
S0262	it's good actually to have that up your sleeve
S0334	yeah
S0262	it be really good cos they'll be like well we better act up now crikey
S0334	yeah i don't think a lot of kid realise what it's like for other people today have no understand i be say to the other day the this christmas when get new toy he's give some of his old toy up and i'm
S0262	yeah
S0334	gonna tell him that he's gonna give them to other children who haven't get any it's like you can't do that oh yes i can cos he be three you can't tell him
S0262	yeah
S0334	that he's gonna give his toy away i say yes he can
S0262	yeah
S0334	he's not just gonna get an endless supply of toy and
S0262	no
S0334	not know the the value of them
S0262	yeah
S0334	or know that other people don't have any he's gonna understand
S0262	it's
S0334	i dunno actually be i be
S0262	no i don't think you be
S0334	not ask him to give away his favourite toy
S0262	no god no no
S0334	if it be one little action man or one little animal
S0262	no yeah
S0334	anything just it's just
S0262	yeah
S0334	the principle of it
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	i think that's good i think teach about sacrifice
S0334	yeah
S0262	quite an early age but why not cos it's real life and think he's gonna have to learn it at some stage
S0334	it's not harmful be it
S0262	mm better to have a concept of what that might mean now than to go oh at thirteen i can't have this this this this this this this this or i'm gonna have to get a part time job
S0334	yeah if i want it this be how i get it
S0262	well it's you know it's like but i've have all these years of have everything and now you're tell me that i need to work for it
S0334	yeah
S0262	it's like if you get start early they can kind of
S0334	yeah
S0262	get a bite of a better idea i would've think but erm but no i think that's reasonable i mean how many kid i mean how many toy do a child need
S0334	well exactly
S0262	in england you look at them
S0334	i know it's it be ridiculous
S0262	completely i mean i know i have lot of toy when i be a kid but
S0334	and you don't
S0262	they be second hand or something you know
S0334	we honestly car boot it's
S0262	yeah
S0334	amaze what you
S0262	yeah
S0334	can get everything they've get be from car boot
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0334	and why would pay forty quid for something that you could get for two pound
S0262	don't get it
S0334	just cos somebody else have use it first
S0262	just make these toy you know shop very very very very very rich you know that's all i can see
S0334	yeah
S0262	it's a bite odd like no i hear stories of parent and their kinds haven't
S0334	yeah
S0262	get erm people haven't get er friends of mine who don't have children
S0334	yeah
S0262	but their friends do
S0334	yeah
S0262	and you know always think there's kinda like oh god we be out the other day with with and she would know be jump up and down go i want the pink dress no not that one not this one all you know and it there's endless amount of these sort of stories
S0334	mm
S0262	and of course the single one or the one who hasn't get any kid go why do they let them get away with it
S0334	yeah
S0262	i be like well i think that's probably the reason why it's because it's really hard to manage
S0334	yeah
S0262	it's incredibly hard to manage
S0334	yeah
S0262	you know i don't think any parent really think they're go off great i can get all these you know toy and
S0334	no
S0262	i might not even agree with it but just to pacify them
S0334	yeah but when you look at the tv and
S0262	and how much market there be
S0334	yeah even on cbeebies right
S0262	yeah
S0334	i can't live without cbeebies like i swear to myself i be never gonna let my children watch it
S0262	yeah
S0334	but actually it's a saviour but luckily 's not into postman pat
S0262	oh
S0334	and all the ones that you can buy the
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0334	you know paraphernalia for he
S0262	yeah
S0334	like random program but
S0262	okay that's cool
S0334	they be they're most bizarre they they don't even talk they're just animals
S0334	but actually i can sit and watch those don't drive me nut but when you look at how much stuff there be
S0262	yeah yeah
S0334	and how it draw kid in and but it's real it's gonna be a battle it's it really be i don't know how you teach them to have their own mind you can't can you it's like with music i i would be devastate if they grow up like one direction
S0262	yeah
S0334	that kinda thing i would like be devastate but how d'you stop them
S0262	no i know
S0334	they wanna fit in don't they
S0262	yeah
S0334	they wanna be like their mat
S0262	yeah
S0334	and if they're not
S0262	yeah
S0334	then they're see as
S0262	i know i know
S0334	those qualities be things that people like when you become an adult
S0262	yeah
S0334	they like to see that somebody's a bite different and doesn't
S0262	yeah
S0334	follow the crowd
S0262	that's right yeah
S0334	when you're eight
S0262	yeah that's yeah that's a bad thing if you're not fit in yeah that's really really hard feel
S0334	yeah it be hard
S0262	yeah no it's
S0334	cos 's never have sweets
S0262	have he not
S0334	he's have chocolate
S0262	mm
S0334	but we go round to a friend's about a year ago actually and she be give her little boy fruit shoot which i absolutely hate
S0262	right
S0334	and lollipops like hard boil lollipops
S0262	yeah
S0334	and didn't know what it be and i think oh my god have i
S0262	manage to yeah
S0334	it wasn't it wasn't like intentional particularly
S0262	yeah
S0334	i just think it it's not good for him i don't want him to eat those
S0262	yeah
S0334	and it wasn't like keep everything away from him but then i think he's get no access to that unless i allow him to
S0262	yeah
S0334	as you you know it's my choice
S0262	yeah exactly
S0334	so when
S0262	yeah
S0334	people say he'll only eat this he'll only eat that well you're the one that give it to him
S0262	mm mm
S0334	yeah but he's never have sweets
S0262	mm
S0334	even now when
S0262	so it so he do he have one then
S0334	no i wouldn't let him have it
S0262	he didn't no
S0334	i say to erm to the mum i don't don't let him have it cos he's not have one and i don't want him to start really
S0262	yeah
S0334	but i felt terrible tell her that it's like
S0262	yeah
S0334	i be criticize her
S0262	do she get the do she get the hump
S0334	no she wasn't too bad
S0262	she didn't

S0334	yeah i know you can't do right for wrong really you're doom things whatever you do
S0262	god
S0334	yeah i i think it's gonna get a lot harder isn't it
S0262	i the thing i worry about the most be erm yeah this be what be say that erm as his kid be get older and they're expand their knowledge of how to use the internet
S0334	yeah
S0262	he's actually work on a program at the a build design whatever erm erm a one stop shop for parent
S0334	yeah
S0262	so they can have their mobile or whatever device and they know exactly what their child's be look at you know it sound very big brother
S0334	yeah
S0262	but my gosh it make sense
S0334	yeah
S0262	if your child's eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen you know up to a point you do need to be supervise what they're look at and you need to be able if they do come across something by you know genuinely by mistake and they see something that's just bizarre and they
S0334	yeah
S0262	just not get round what that be that they can actually then come to their to a parent or someone and say okay i do see something
S0334	yeah
S0262	or i do read something
S0334	yeah
S0262	i do wanna talk to you about it
S0334	yeah
S0262	there's nothing worse than go to bed or you know for days on end go dunno what i saw what be that what be that what be that
S0334	yeah
S0262	and be kind of freak out
S0334	yeah
S0262	so he's work on it apparently there isn't anything to this day
S0334	mm
S0262	in the world that actually do what he think it should do
S0334	yeah
S0262	there be sort of censorships
S0334	yeah
S0262	on your tv on your computer settings not something that you can pick up before i go to bed i'm gonna check in and just see what my kid be look at for about two hours of the day you know
S0334	why do you not do that on the device they've be look on why could you not look at their phone or look at
S0262	yeah yeah
S0334	d'you know what i mean you can look at the history of what they've be look at on the internet can't you and
S0262	you can yeah
S0334	but i guess as a parent it's not particularly and stuff
S0262	cos that's then say i'm take something of yours to actually look at it
S0334	no you can i don't no i don't agree with that
S0262	no sorta like er have a diary or something that's kind of
S0334	if my eight year old not that my eight year old would
S0262	no
S0334	have a phone but if they do that's not theirs
S0262	yeah it's yours you've give it to them yeah
S0334	i'm pay for it
S0262	yeah yeah
S0334	i dunno i dunno
S0262	yeah
S0334	i mean my nieces be one's twelve and one's ten and they've both get phone now and they have those constantly it's in her hand wherever she go
S0262	mm
S0334	it's in her hand and she's take photos it's constant and i don't think my sister would i don't know if she check it or not i don't think erm that would go down so well
S0262	mm yeah
S0334	at twelve
S0262	so what age d'you think it's hard to say isn't it because in those years all those things will change again so it's like you can't really answer right now because they're only weird nippers and you should have to see you know what happen what happen will happen i guess
S0334	i don't know don't know
S0262	it's really hard that one
S0334	the one positive thing be that i know be on the ball with her
S0262	yeah
S0334	and he would be able to monitor things and check things i know
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0334	at the moment but that's probably that all that can change too
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0334	but they might've chip children by then that's what i'm hop
S0334	so i know exactly where they be who they're with just oh there they be and like
S0334	beep across the screen they're not where they where they say they be
S0334	it's a minefield it really be
S0262	well in a way if children do go out with mobile phone you know constantly in their hand or whatever they yeah you know you can see that you can probably gps them
S0334	yeah
S0262	you know
S0334	yeah
S0262	i don't know whether that be actually possible it probably be erm but yeah i mean this idea of surveillance you know from parent i mean i don't think it's surveillance i mean it's you know it's not surveillance it's supervision you know which be which be fine some people some parent be very strict with supervise their children some a lot and i guess what 's say be that if he can build something for all different type of parent
S0334	yeah
S0262	where they can have quite a minimal kind of like erm supervision
S0334	yeah
S0262	of their child's devices some parent be very strict will wanna see a lot more information
S0334	yeah
S0262	or there could be real reason why there could be something genuinely go on with that child where they've be act a bite mm
S0334	yeah
S0262	like oh wow i hope he's alright or what's he actually be do now or what's he get into
S0334	do you see that programme erm i can't remember his name now they call him the paedophile hunter stinson hunter something like that
S0262	god no you see this all this be all happen since i've be away i
S0334	no this be really
S0262	oh have it
S0334	well it's only
S0262	like
S0334	come to my attention recently
S0262	okay
S0334	maybe last month i've hear about him
S0262	right no i don't know anything about him
S0334	i think he's be do it for a while but basically he go online pretend to be a young girl on these chat room or just generally out there in the internet erm he always like twelve thirteen always really clear about his age obviously he's lie to them but erm he get inundate with people with men that want to meet up and they talk about there's a programme about it they talk about what they wanna do to the girl and she
S0262	god
S0334	he but be say that i'm only thirteen erm and they're say oh honestly some of the graphic stuff they be say they want to do they're actually type it to this girl erm and then they'd arrange to meet and he'd be there with his cameras and erm the guy would turn up and he'd be film him and then it be all the information would go to the police and he's he have like ten convictions from it erm but it be a
S0262	god
S0334	it be a documentary not very not long ago
S0262	what's it call i'd like to see it
S0334	the paedophile hunter
S0262	the paedophile hunter
S0334	i think something like that
S0262	so if i be to put it put it on the google search
S0334	stinson i'm sure it's stinson hunter his name
S0262	stimpson hunter
S0334	you'll find it
S0262	okay
S0334	you'll find it it's really popular
S0262	paedophile hunter
S0334	erm there be
S0334	kind of a bite of like
S0262	be it american or british
S0334	no he's english
S0262	oh okay
S0334	but i think he's a guy that's have a er really difficult upbringing i think he himself have be sexually abuse when he be in care erm you look at him and he's like cover in tattoo and
S0262	okay
S0334	erm but everything he do be kind of above board he's not do anything illegal erm he doesn't he's not confrontational when the guy come through the door he's not aggressive in anyway he's quite really erm but you kind and there's a lot of kinda discussion about whether he be set people up and whether it be a fair thing to do you think
S0262	yeah yeah the ethics
S0334	fuck off be it fair what ethics
S0262	yeah yeah yeah there be yeah
S0334	that guy be intentionally go on there to look for a young girl
S0262	he's deal with people who who don't have ethics anyway yeah potential yeah
S0334	do it matter that you be right i don't know
S0262	that's right yeah right i would've think so
S0334	but it's just incredible the the guy's reaction when they come through the door
S0262	yeah yeah
S0334	well i'll she be eighteen she say she be eighteen no i write it i say i be twelve
S0262	but geographically how do these people even meet these young i mean young like and how would how would a twelve year i don't know how old do he say he be
S0334	he always say twelve thirteen under sixteen anyway
S0262	but these men be actually okay they really wanna meet these
S0334	mm
S0262	people in real life
S0334	yeah
S0262	i would've think that they're just get some fantasy out of it and that you know
S0334	they actually want to meet them
S0262	they actually want to meet them
S0334	they turn up at the guy's
S0262	and actually they wanna actually sexually abuse them
S0334	yeah those guy turn up there be a couple of guy turn up with bottle of wine cigarettes erm so intentionally want to get them drink erm it be just amaze
S0262	oh god
S0334	amaze
S0262	but how do the twelve year old get there if she can't drive herself
S0334	no no they come to her
S0262	so her mum be out the house
S0334	so so he'll say something like yeah he'll set it up basically so it make it easy for them to say my parent be away or whatever in the day time they're at work come round it's pretty
S0262	have they get no concept of the fact that their that the parent could walk in no this man sexually abuse somebody's daughter and and then nine nine nine and then he'd be he'd get catch
S0334	don't even think about it i don't know what go through their mind i i mean it's sick really it really be it's amaze how many people be do it so that a thing that would concern me and you know they either pretend they're honest about who they be and their age or they're not and they say they're a fifteen year old lad or something like that you know and i guess that's the worry isn't it about the internet you don't know who's who you don't know who you're talk to or who your children be talk to scary
S0262	oh god that's yeah i didn't realise it be quite like that i mean i i'm try to run through some stories in my of you know yeah there have be unfortunately like there have be yeah i mean the two girls i always i don't know why i call them the manchester unite girls because they weren't i think they be wear
S0334	oh yeah
S0262	i think something like that
S0334	yeah
S0262	erm
S0334	from surrey weren't they
S0262	yeah yeah and he intercept them somehow and and he get them to meet er him at erm a park or something like that and they i think they do think they be gonna meet fourteen fifteen year old boys
S0334	yeah yeah it be crazy world
S0262	because that's entrapment yeah it be you're definitely set out with an intention to you know trap someone and
S0334	yeah
S0262	then harm them yeah
S0334	yeah
S0262	so you be you're probably think about all the cleverest things that you can and then if you be doubly sick on top of that as in you're sick to start with but you're doubly sick on top of that then it's gonna happen
S0334	mm
S0262	at some point it's a probably isn't it that
S0334	yeah they're very clever they're very clever and very manipulative in how they do things and spend a lot of time groom don't they
S0262	mm
S0334	i just think he's he's do an amaze thing really
S0262	yeah there should be more like him
S0334	he's put his life in danger he's be run over he's be all sort of stuff yeah you should you should have a look
S0262	oh yeah i'll definitely go and have a look
S0334	yeah
S0262	god i mean i'm about it but i mean it'd be interest as an erm
S0334	mm
S0262	sort of documentary for me
S0334	yeah
S0262	you know how you how you do that
S0334	yeah
S0262	but at least he's get convictions i mean should become a detective or
S0334	well this be it you know there be a lot of argument about why the police aren't work with him or why you know they're not they work together in that he give them information but they be say why why have be not
S0262	why aren't they use his methodology
S0334	why why be it yeah why's this not happen
S0262	yeah yeah
S0334	and they do they say they do that kind of thing but
S0262	yeah
S0334	they don't have the manpower but he do this twenty four seven
S0262	that's his thing good on him
S0334	yeah
S0262	good on him
S0334	definitely
S0262	well that's impressive gosh
S0334	i i could do that
S0262	yeah yeah
S0334	kind of job i'd like to do i think
S0262	yeah
S0334	sound horrible doesn't it
S0262	yeah but i mean it's in the
S0334	like to do that but
S0262	yeah but i mean you've get a very strong sort of like yeah conviction to do it you know really see that's the thing people turn you know blind eye to these things
S0334	yeah
S0262	and then they go oh really i suppose in a way i'm a bite like that but but then again i don't read the newspapers i don't
S0334	mm
S0262	i i genuinely get my information in different ways so
S0334	yeah
S0262	but yeah i think i think there be a certain amount of sensationalism now with all the er what be it how many different people be bang up for underaged sex it's
S0334	yeah yeah
S0262	all those guy like the
S0334	yeah
S0262	older ones
S0334	yeah
S0262	all those lot
S0334	yeah yeah i know i don't know
S0262	well yeah i i don't know either because i don't know i don't know cos how how it would work that yeah i suppose you just don't trust the police you would just never
S0334	mm
S0262	have think to have go when it happen
S0334	and i hate to say but i think the culture be different then
S0262	yeah
S0334	think a lot of things be more acceptable
S0262	yeah
S0334	or seem to be acceptable i dunno
S0262	mm yeah
S0334	dunno really
S0262	so then so you're not work at the moment then but
S0334	no
S0262	you like you but you not obviously not but be you gonna think about you know eventually i mean not right now but
S0334	yeah yeah i don't know erm don't know what to do really
S0262	mm just see what happen yeah
S0334	it's just a bite difficult with childcare it's
S0262	expensive yeah
S0334	expensive i'd need to well if i be work full time and put two in nursery
S0262	no
S0334	really
S0262	no and then you'd yeah
S0334	they'd just limit what you can do
S0262	and then you don't get to enjoy them i imagine so
S0334	no so i don't think i'll do anything properly until we're in school
S0262	yeah
S0334	which be another four four years for both of them to be in school i'm not sure i'll be survive until then
S0334	it's really tough because you kind of i wanna do something
S0262	yeah you wanna you wanna do something yeah
S0334	i wanna get my brain work then cos it doesn't do very much at the moment
S0262	well that's what i suppose 's really good because that be
S0334	yeah but if i could get pay for that that'd be ideal
S0262	yeah yeah
S0334	but i dunno maybe i dunno
S0262	well you can do this you can do this
S0334	well this be what i be
S0262	yeah
S0334	think it's
S0262	yeah
S0334	erm
S0262	it's pretty easy
S0334	it's good money and it mean
S0262	yeah
S0334	not too tax
S0262	it's it's clean work as in you know it's just deal with people who you choose to deal with so that's nice
S0334	yeah
S0262	erm and yeah yeah it's really good erm so they're kind of limit to i think it's before it be fifty i could've go up to fifty hours per month which sound like a lot and it be
S0334	well
S0262	but because they have just like husband and wife or a couple or you know just talk like they'd literally just put it on all day it would be two and a half days straight
S0262	and of course that's like a good deal of money right if you're if you just keep it on
S0334	can you do that
S0262	people try it on
S0334	right right
S0262	and it skew the data so the project managers and the lead researchers go whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
S0334	yeah
S0262	okay we have to rethink this now so they limit it to sixty hours per person which be a cap
S0334	right
S0262	it's up to sixty hours but i mean if you think about sixty hours time eighteen
S0334	how much be that
S0334	my maths isn't very good six twos twelve one thousand two hundred roughly
S0262	bite extra pocket money so be you in every one i be yes and i send it to a few friends back at a while back and i say er i say look at this you you know just talk you know it's like brilliant job and er and then two of them get back to me in fact the only two friends the two friends who i send it to be like oh
S0262	no that that's not my thing at all and i be like oh sorry i think it would be but why not and they go like because just really don't wanna have to listen to the sound of my own voice
S0262	i be like but you wouldn't because you'd be have a conversation you'd be listen to somebody else yeah but you have to go back and review the conversation cos you'd have to pick out the topic so yeah you do i mean i fast forward it
S0334	mm
S0262	you know i'll go i'd go mental it sorta switch from facebook to this
S0334	yeah
S0262	but you do actually if you're do a good job
S0334	yeah
S0262	you do have to try
S0334	yeah
S0262	and yeah now i be get a bite of that strain on my kind of like you know
S0262	oh dear do i
S0262	the the worry the worst one be the way i talk to
S0334	really
S0262	with my friends i'm fine like i'm kind of like you know but i have no idea how i be come across to him
S0262	it's like
S0334	i don't think i'd do that with oh my god poor guy
S0262	yes i think that's probably a good idea
S0334	i'll avoid that anyway just stop it there
