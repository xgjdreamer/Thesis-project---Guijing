S0540	i'm really impress
S0541	it's amaze isn't it i'll just put there and look at it but i mean
S0540	yeah
S0541	they're not interest in the content they're just interest in the pattern of the speech so
S0540	pattern
S0541	yeah
S0540	oh my goodness
S0541	well i think so
S0540	how can they just pick up on pattern without recognise the content because something must be pattern
S0541	well they're interest in the language so i guess they'll be look for you know
S0540	verbs or
S0541	yeah like modern maybe it's just modern usage of how language be evolve and what's speak what people be say word they're use you know
S0540	so the fact that i'm japanese and erm
S0541	well that'll be interest
S0540	and you know i speak er english as a second language i mean that must count
S0541	presumably
S0540	well should i just er explain myself
S0541	myself
S0541	no no no i i i don't think you need to worry about that i mean
S0540	mm no and with
S0540	you know eighteen pound an hour i mean that's you know much better than erm you know a lot of the job we can take
S0541	tell me about it anyway let's move on
S0540	okay
S0541	to our subject and erm
S0540	yeah yeah sorry yes
S0541	so erm but er anyway so i come back and i apply for all these things and i get all these rejections and that's fine
S0540	yeah yeah
S0541	but then one of them come back and erm and it's basically it's erm so i've be a bite up and down with it really so basically it's this kinda content produce company
S0540	mm
S0541	and they be do this big project with google
S0540	mm
S0541	and google be write a erm erm basically they're they're write an entry on every single hotel in the world
S0540	oh yeah mm
S0541	do i tell you i tell you this
S0540	so they're not tripadvisor
S0541	no
S0540	but google's actually do that
S0541	well what they're do i think
S0540	mm
S0541	be erm i think it's obviously to get revenue so that people then can search for hotels by google and then the hotel will obviously pay them per click right
S0540	mm
S0541	and then they will probably get a percentage when if it go to a book so it's
S0540	oh i see
S0541	potentially quite a big kinda revenue earner
S0540	oh right
S0541	but anyway so this be a huge project
S0540	mm
S0541	and erm which be go on all over the world so they're recruit writers and content producers
S0540	oh fantastic
S0541	all over the world
S0540	mm
S0541	to do this so and i basically do like some test last week
S0540	oh wow
S0541	or last weekend or something
S0540	yeah
S0541	and kind of get through those and now
S0540	what do you mean the do a test
S0541	well they do they set like test for you to see you know
S0540	whether you can write
S0541	well the have like it's like basically load of instructions on different kind of and stuff like that
S0540	oh okay
S0541	so anyway so blah blah blah so i do that so i pass that and now i've get a week of train
S0540	oh
S0541	just start today tomorrow
S0540	where
S0541	from home it's all remote
S0540	okay fantastic
S0541	it's all remote so erm but then so anyway so i be kind of like and it's gonna go on for age it's gonna on for like the whole of next year and they want a minimum of thirty hours a week or twenty five hours a week or more
S0540	so that mean you know a proper full time
S0541	it's a bite of a nightmare and the pay's really bad but the pay's i think the pay be really really bad
S0540	but it's not
S0541	base on the test that i do
S0540	mm
S0541	cos i have to write some sample ones and they take me like about an hour each and i be like oh my god
S0540	mm
S0541	and the rate of pay be appal per hotel it's twelve dollars fifty
S0540	mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
S0541	twelve us dollars
S0540	oh my gosh yeah
S0541	so anyway so i be like i can't do this it's terrible
S0540	mm
S0541	erm and then they come back and like they so i write them an email i say look i don't know if i can do this because of the rat
S0540	mm
S0541	and then they kinda they have a table of kind of estimate kind of earn and stuff and i say well you know have you get this because it seem basically it's base on historical data but now i've kind of look at it a bite more i kind of think maybe erm maybe it's actually
S0540	it's a little bite it's
S0541	it's actually easier than i think
S0540	because you would able you would be able to kind of erm get get the knack of it and and
S0541	yeah
S0540	be much quicker
S0541	you're gonna turn into a robot i've turn into a robot with it
S0540	mm
S0541	but erm they're fairly short descriptions actually but the the time it's take in look at the information that's what what take up the time
S0540	yeah i see read through take in the information correctly
S0541	anyway it's really bore but
S0540	and who's gonna check it i mean what's the system behind it
S0541	well the system behind it be that they're then i mean i ask that as well so i say oh you know
S0540	well someone's gotta supervise it right
S0541	well they have all these editors i mean it's all remote it's all do via google so they're all
S0540	yeah
S0541	you we're all work on a google platform
S0540	mm
S0541	and kind of you know
S0541	it's an ambient ambient platform
S0540	yeah
S0541	meet in kind of google hangouts
S0540	yeah
S0541	and everything's like
S0540	in in the digital realm yeah
S0541	it's it's all completely in the digital realm erm
S0540	mm
S0541	and then apparently erm and apparently so then it's write and we put it on to the content management system
S0540	mm
S0541	and then it go live and then i think there's random quality control so i might end up look at somebody else's stuff and have to randomly edit it
S0540	oh so you so you you be involve in the edit process
S0541	apparently i might have to do some of that as well but the train week which be this week
S0540	yeah
S0541	which they're pay me like five hundred dollars for for like twenty hours twenty hours this week so you know whatever erm so i've i've be go through the stuff today and
S0540	it's better than nothing and better better than proofread er phd students you know
S0540	it's thirty thousand bloody theses mm
S0541	so erm so anyway so there be load and load and load of material and star guide and lexicons
S0540	yeah
S0541	and like rule
S0540	i just yeah maybe the first month or so might be you know
S0541	hard yeah
S0540	yeah but then you i i can imagine it should get easier if not bore
S0541	i think the only problem with it
S0540	yeah
S0541	be that it's gonna it's sort of thing that will drive me absolutely mental because it's very uncreative and
S0540	yeah
S0541	it's just it's just like be a robot
S0540	yeah yeah yeah
S0541	it's it really be be a robot
S0540	but on the other hand you would be actually get to know you know all the hotels out there in a way
S0541	i know but for what purpose yeah i dunno what the purpose would be
S0540	mm no i know
S0541	erm do you know what i mean
S0540	it be it be non creative you know
S0541	yeah
S0540	compare to what you you normally you know do
S0541	yeah
S0540	it be you know you can say it's not creative
S0541	it's terrible
S0540	but you know what i mean
S0541	it's soul destroy but on the on the plus side
S0540	yeah
S0541	it mean that i i'll have a guarantee a guarantee income so
S0540	yeah
S0541	i have a guarantee income
S0540	yeah
S0541	and it can be my safety net
S0540	yeah and that you know i mean i have say that know you in er me as a researcher and i do extremely tedious you know task you know go through all er extremely specialist book and pick out you know the bioprocessing and biotechnology and nothing glamorous about it and then you know i i write about it and i mean everything i do be you know if it's collocate into you know how much per hour it's just below minimum wage and
S0541	mm
S0540	you know it's erm just doesn't add up
S0541	no
S0540	at least everything you every hour you spend be actually you know pay in a way
S0541	yeah i
S0540	you know
S0541	i don't know i mean i i might go mad after like a couple of months
S0540	yeah
S0541	like literally i might not be able to do it
S0540	well but it's yeah
S0541	but we'll see
S0540	yeah it's
S0541	we'll see and there's be no work i mean i've have no phone call i'll have like
S0540	mm
S0541	phone call about stuff but there be
S0540	no
S0541	there be no work there be none so i mean i've i've meet
S0540	yeah
S0541	a woman an woman
S0540	mm
S0541	erm who be a a kind of very senior well she's creative director really
S0540	wow
S0541	and erm she's a very nice woman she's in her fifties
S0540	mm
S0541	turkish woman
S0540	mm
S0541	and she's do all the big l'or√©al stuff and all the big campaign and blah blah blah she's do all of this
S0540	oh yeah
S0541	and i be a bite like why do she want to kind of team up and the reason be be that she's
S0540	yeah
S0541	be freelance for over a year
S0540	oh
S0541	and she can't get any work either there be er there be no work
S0541	there's no work everybody i'm talk to
S0540	there's no work in the industry
S0541	and and then i saw a friend of mine and erm who i use to work with at the body shop
S0540	mm
S0541	and she do package erm
S0540	mm
S0541	package design she's older but anyway she'd be in her fifties but she say oh well and she have have quite a good theory for it actually and she
S0540	you mean theory for no work
S0541	yeah she have a really good theory for it and i think she's absolutely right and she that she'd notice this in the past two sessions that erm you know when there's a recession everybody get lay off and
S0540	yeah
S0541	there's quite a big pool of freelancers
S0540	mm
S0541	and then as the economy improve
S0540	mm
S0541	basically people start to recruit these permanent job again
S0540	mm
S0541	so that's why suddenly there's no and i think she's i think she's really right i think this be exactly what's happen i think the economy's better people be get into permanent job and suddenly there's no work so
S0540	oh
S0541	i i think that's it i think that be exactly what's happen
S0540	mm mm mm mm
S0541	because it's not a seasonal thing now
S0540	mm mm
S0541	it's happen all year it's nothing to do with the election it's nothing to do with budget it's
S0540	mm mm mm mm
S0541	anyway whatever
S0540	so it's the financial climate the economic climate the job climate
S0541	i think it's change yeah i think there be no freelance market any more
S0540	mm
S0541	or not enough not enough to actually erm base a erm i dunno if there's enough to base a
S0540	mm
S0541	live on basically
S0540	mm mm mm mm
S0541	so anyway so that's that so so that's what i'm gonna be do
S0540	but that's okay because you know you're not look for a freelance job particularly
S0541	well i mean you know i see if i get i might get the odd day odd day there and then i can move i can cut the stuff down to twenty five hours if i'm busy one week maybe
S0540	mm
S0541	or i i'm gonna have to work on the weekend cos i kind of wanna keep it go if i can
S0540	mm mm
S0541	in that it will see me through the winter
S0540	yeah i know
S0541	you know
S0540	but it save you from worry about you know the you know bread and butter
S0541	i know
S0540	erm you know erm you know financial things
S0541	yeah
S0540	and you know you have the skills to do it

S0540	anyway
S0541	it'll be easy for me
S0540	yeah
S0541	it really will
S0540	you're not go to struggle for sure
S0541	it'll be easy it's just a kind of you know i i don't know anyway i'm i don't wanna get kind of
S0540	i i you know
S0541	emotional about it you know i tend to get very emotional about my creativity

S0540	mm
S0541	i i've just be think about this whole thing of but i guess i saw the yoga as well and the kind of the whole kind of spotlight that it begin to throw on who you think you be
S0540	mm mm
S0541	your ego
S0540	oh yes oh yes
S0541	and er
S0540	identity yeah
S0541	and your identity
S0540	yeah
S0541	yeah and which be really funny and you know i kind of like you know the kind of loss of income and the it's it wasn't it's it wasn't even so much the loss of income it be more like you know it's
S0540	yeah
S0541	more like the death of the career
S0540	yeah
S0541	and the death of identity
S0540	yeah
S0541	for i think this be what's have me so
S0540	mm
S0541	kind of erm kind of frighten you know of like the
S0540	mm mm
S0541	the death of my like who be you know the death of my career of like be it all over like what do i do now you know
S0540	mm mm mm mm
S0541	and this fear of things
S0540	yeah
S0541	i think it's be about that really more than
S0540	yeah
S0541	more than a financial
S0540	yeah
S0541	although obviously financial concern be become very
S0540	mm
S0541	very worry erm but yeah so she write really kind of interest thing about kind of fear and you know and the the the and the the ego erm the ego feel that it's under attack and it's about to be annihilate
S0540	mm
S0541	you know by something and it's just
S0540	mm
S0541	kind of because we we don't live in a world of dinosaurs or
S0540	mm
S0541	you know it's like what what be the kind of what be you frighten of why do you think it's gonna kinda annihilate you
S0540	mm
S0541	you know
S0540	yes i mean a christian way you know people would you know interpret things like this as a test and how you know we should have god at the centre and therefore you know not worry about erm how you know you be go to be able to but anyway you know
S0541	and it be i think i think i think that be a comfort though
S0540	it's it's better i i don't really
S0541	i think that be a comfort there i think that be one of the great comfort of religion
S0540	mm
S0541	be the faith in a higher power
S0540	mm
S0541	that will rescue you come what may you know whereas
S0540	mm
S0541	the rest of us who don't who don't have faith and don't believe in a higher power erm we kind of you know i i i don't know i mean it's really funny you think it's just you know erm remember before you kind of say oh that thing of like be it you i don't know if it be you actually i think it be
S0540	it could be
S0541	yeah it be that thing of kind of like you know get older but feel you're go backwards not forward maybe it wasn't you maybe it be somebody else
S0540	mm backwards not forward
S0541	yeah but get older and kind of like it it i don't think it be you but
S0540	oh okay so so it's not about wisdom build build up it's more about
S0541	no
S0540	something else
S0541	what do you mean
S0540	cos i would associate age with wisdom
S0541	yeah i know but more in a
S0540	erm
S0541	kinda material sense of kind of you know you're get oh it wasn't it wasn't you it be this woman in this woman
S0540	oh mm oh
S0541	and she be have the same thing that she'd have this kind of very
S0540	mm
S0541	successful corporate career and then you know and she'd kind of like give that up
S0540	mm mm mm
S0541	because she be unhappy and it be make her ill
S0540	mm mm mm
S0541	and then kind of meet this guy in
S0540	mm mm mm
S0541	and erm be now over here and they now they have this kind of nomadic life
S0540	mm
S0541	you know but erm and we have like a long conversation about the thing of also be at a particular point in your life
S0540	mm
S0541	where it's like almost like the pinnacle of erm the the the point when most people reach a pinnacle of their success
S0540	mm
S0541	in like kinda mid to late forties you know
S0540	mm
S0541	cos they've get the kind of a nice house and they're marry and have get their children and they're at the peak of their career
S0540	mm mm mm mm mm mm
S0541	so this should be the most
S0541	empower
S0540	mm mm mm
S0541	time
S0540	mm mm mm mm mm
S0541	and profitable and rich in every sense of the word
S0540	mm mm mm mm
S0541	so to kind of feel like you're actually like you don't have any of that you're go backwards go backwards not forward you know it's a really strange sensation because we're
S0540	yeah
S0541	but we're we're bring up to believe in the west in well if you're of a particular kind of you know social class you're bring up to believe this
S0540	yeah
S0541	trajectory of
S0540	mm
S0541	success right
S0540	mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm yeah in a way yes i mean you know of course for women it's you know it sort of partly apply and partly not
S0541	part yeah you're right
S0540	but yeah i mean overall yes i mean
S0541	no i no i'm not speak as a
S0540	you know
S0541	i'm not speak as a mother actually but erm
S0540	mm but surely i mean you know of course my mother be you know exist and then she start take a part time course in education in her late fifties so that's quite a late start isn't it
S0541	yeah yeah
S0541	yeah
S0540	and er you know she's just be have her er you know just begin to have her life
S0541	yeah
S0540	that she she exhaust most of her twenties thirties and forties on just child rear
S0541	but what do she she have an education though do she have a degree
S0540	no she didn't finish
S0541	she didn't
S0540	no
S0541	so she
S0540	she be in uni she be at university enrol and maybe the first or maybe the second year and then she didn't finish
S0541	oh
S0540	because she have a child
S0541	oh
S0540	and then she have another one
S0541	yeah yeah
S0540	and then she have another one then she never manage to go back
S0541	and never go back yeah
S0540	so yes but i think for some mother you know they they they they realise suddenly you know their lose years
S0541	yeah i think that must be really erm
S0540	yeah
S0541	i i can't
S0540	i mean that be as alienate as
S0541	i can imagine
S0540	in a way you know and then suddenly you know husband go through midlife crisis and
S0541	yeah yeah
S0540	i mean that think of that be quite painful i guess erm in a way but it's not write you you know it's not write like society it's all kind of really get
S0541	yeah
S0540	behind the close door or each domestic affair so you don't actually like hear that much
S0541	no
S0540	you know like a you know like a class trajectory they they now exist i think
S0541	these erm you know the two women i meet in the two sisters posh women
S0540	mm
S0541	they be i meet one of them the other day erm for erm i meet her for breakfast and erm
S0540	mm
S0541	and er you know she have she's have er and it's a similar kind of thing you know get i mean they and she never go to they neither of them go to university
S0540	mm
S0541	i mean we're of the same age group
S0540	mm mm
S0541	they're like forty five forty seven
S0540	mm mm mm mm
S0541	erm and they're two posh girls so and i i i know from kind of
S0540	it's in the background yeah
S0541	i know from uni there be
S0540	yeah
S0541	some of the girls there not a lot them i mean a lot of them mainly we be all kind of fairly erm everybody be kind of fairly career focus
S0540	mm
S0541	but there be some who have come from kind of probably quite old fashion kinda upper class background
S0540	mm
S0541	where they be have an education
S0540	mm
S0541	but they weren't their families didn't actually believe they be gonna have a career
S0540	mm
S0541	so like you know you kinda go through the motion of go to university and
S0540	mm
S0541	one of them who i share a house with in italy actually
S0540	mm
S0541	i then and she er you know her father be a kind of like he be a real old duffer
S0540	mm mm
S0541	i mean a lovely guy erm but he be a he be older as well he be much older
S0540	mm mm mm
S0541	and so i think even while she be at uni he be he be he be probably in his late sixties kinda seventy
S0540	mm yeah
S0541	er so he would really belong to a generation which didn't believe that women really need to have a an education slash career
S0540	mm mm
S0541	and so she erm do her degree but then i come across her years later and she be a pa
S0540	mm
S0541	at so
S0540	oh really
S0541	so she yeah this whole thing of like her degree in italian and french you know she'd end up be a pa which i think be a terrible kind of waste you know
S0540	really
S0541	just quite bizarre and her family be so wealthy
S0540	mm
S0541	when her father drive out in his nineteen thirties roll royce to italy we have this amaze
S0540	mm mm
S0541	journey down the valley and this amaze picnic and they be very very wealthy kinda culture people but you know
S0540	mm
S0541	so very anyway but to go back to these two women
S0540	yeah
S0541	so both of these women i i be try to work out whether they'd cos you know how you try and work out from the clue from what people say
S0540	mm
S0541	or rather what they don't say
S0540	and erm they'd never kind of like and i just kind of think i know from both of them the two posh girls who have go to secretarial college and i i just know this and this be exactly what happen to them now i know but erm so obviously
S0540	you mean in switzerland or somewhere like
S0541	no no i think i well maybe i i don't know but anyway they hadn't go to
S0541	university you know they be kind of
S0540	yeah what be those secretarial colleges we hear about
S0541	they're they're for upper class kind of erm
S0540	secretarial mm
S0541	well i don't think anyone go there any more even kind of you know
S0540	but i think that camilla go camilla go
S0541	camilla
S0540	the erm duchess of
S0541	cornwall
S0540	yeah
S0541	well it's exactly the kind of thing she would've do
S0540	yeah
S0541	yeah that be a prime example of an upper class woman
S0541	who would've be send to secretarial college
S0540	mm
S0541	almost like a finish school
S0540	yeah
S0541	you know
S0540	yeah
S0541	of like have a learn a few skills a bite like
S0540	yeah
S0541	in the war in case like there be world war two and they might be need like you know to do some type for the war effort or something
S0540	mm mm mm yeah yeah
S0541	erm but anyway so both these two women who'd obviously kind of come from a really good family good london kind of quite wealthy erm and probably very beautiful when they be young the pair of them and kind of charm and all of these
S0540	mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
S0541	they'd both go to erm secretarial college and that be it
S0540	mm that be it
S0541	that be it
S0540	and they're marry
S0541	and then so now one of them her husband be leave her for
S0540	mm mm
S0541	another woman
S0540	mm
S0541	she's forty seven so obviously she's like
S0540	mm
S0541	never work
S0540	mm
S0541	apart from like twenty five years ago for like
S0540	mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
S0541	six months how frighten must that be
S0540	and how be she
S0541	well he's gonna pay for everything and like you know she's do all that and then erm
S0540	yeah
S0541	and then other one who's kinda more like my my kinda friend
S0540	mm
S0541	you know she's just now awaken from kind of sixteen years of parenthood
S0540	oh really
S0541	yeah and kinda want to do her own thing now you know
S0540	i think parenthood you know
S0540	weird
S0541	it's just so weird and like
S0540	yeah
S0541	i and i can't imagine that you know so she for sixteen years she's be down live in cos her husband have get a family old family business there
S0540	mm
S0541	that's where they've spend their life and she's bring up her kid that way
S0540	mm
S0541	and her whole life's be about bring up her kid and be a a wonderful
S0540	yeah so like my mother's yeah
S0541	it's crazy
S0540	it's crazy but it it you know it happen to some women who marry really young i think
S0540	before you know without a career well
S0541	it's wow it's it's just yeah it's crazy
S0540	yeah although my mother always you know she be very well read you know she she would always be read erm and pursue her interest and how would as within kind of the read kind of
S0541	yeah yeah so she be feed her mind
S0541	but anyway yeah so all these things have kind of you know it's i mean these these be erm yeah i look back at today in my life and i be like oh you know i er kind of all these negative feel of you know what have i achieve and i haven't achieve anything it's a typical midlife crisis of you know what have i achieve at the age of forty seven here i be kind of like you know do what write about crappy hotels you know this be the this this be the pinnacle of my achievement
S0540	but rather do you feel like you you could write a book fiction or non fiction
S0541	yeah maybe maybe
S0540	you know i be just you know read up on jeffrey archer's career
S0541	oh my god really
S0540	only because mary archer use to erm study on the seventh floor of
S0541	oh really
S0540	yeah she she mary archer be actually an erm photosynthesis scientist
S0541	oh
S0540	who specialise in sort of solar cells and things
S0541	oh okay
S0540	so anyway so and actually i didn't quite equate mary archer with jeffrey archer cos they're you know like a famous couple
S0541	okay
S0540	and jeffrey archer you know have a a a you know quite a tarnish career as a politician who then go to prison and write you know the best sellers
S0541	yeah yeah yeah but he write before he go to prison anyway didn't he he be a novelist before
S0540	he write in when while in imprison
S0541	but he be a novelist before he go to prison
S0540	be he
S0541	yeah he's write very
S0541	he's write trashy book for for age
S0540	oh really i didn't know but he be
S0541	they use to have these famous famous erm shepherd's pie party
S0541	wherever in the wherever they live they have some amaze like penthouse apartment somewhere overlook the thames and his
S0540	yeah yeah
S0541	his shepherd's pie party be really famous
S0540	oh i see but anyway yes if you be you know you have the gift of you know like a writer
S0541	yeah
S0540	yeah you're very lucky you can write
S0541	yeah i guess so
S0540	yeah
S0541	although it's just like so many things these days you know when i i study languages
S0540	mm
S0541	my headmistress think languages be really good and so do my mother
S0540	mm
S0541	it's like you could have a career in languages but the reality be language be so degrade
S0540	mm
S0541	like language a foreign language now
S0540	mm
S0541	be only useful as an accompaniment to a to another skill
S0540	mm
S0541	it's not as a primary unless you're work within the languages as a
S0540	mm
S0541	interpreter
S0540	mm mm
S0541	or translator but do you know how much translators get pay it's appal they earn like twenty five thousand pound a year
S0540	i don't know
S0541	just insane it's terrible it's it's like the whole thing be degrade
S0540	mm it's so funny because you know
S0540	it remind me of best my brother's best friend musician
S0541	yeah
S0540	who be a saxophonist
S0541	yeah
S0540	and er he apparently er be do a lot of translate job because that make more money
S0541	i mean well well that's a slide scale
S0541	so we know that musicians make zero big fat zero
S0540	and he you know he er do his album you know and it be review in the guardian newspaper
S0541	yeah
S0540	and you know in in jazz and he's a very well know jazz musician in the area it you know it's you know i mean he graduate first in erm you know in music and things
S0541	that doesn't mean anything unless you sell load of
S0540	but then he but then he's half french you know so and then he's apparently take on work you know translation interpretation job cos they pay more money it's just so
S0541	i dunno
S0540	so you i think you're you're you're use to be you know you be at the very high high up on the pay scale anyway so you look down on the average
S0541	i know that's the problem
S0540	you know
S0541	that's the problem
S0540	pay job you know it's just
S0541	that be the problem
S0540	it's just go to be you know i mean i'm talk about artists and musicians
S0541	i know
S0540	you know do do admire all these translate job because they pay better
S0541	i know and i'm like
S0540	i mean just
S0541	it's so true but i mean this whole thing have just be like such a journey of like discovery you know but in a really bad way i've be like oh my god this be so awful
S0541	yeah it's just be like i can't believe how much people get pay and people with skills like language skills you know like how can this be so badly pay
S0540	yeah yeah it's a commodity now
S0541	it's terrible
S0540	yeah
S0541	and that you know google no actually not google it's fine but obviously google they're invest a lot of money
S0540	mm
S0541	in you know in in algorithms to kind of like as a solution as a translation solution so they can eradicate like human be
S0540	problem be that people like the get hire you know a lot of money to come up with a generic solution for all you know what i mean
S0541	a generic solution
S0540	yeah so algorithm to to you know which can cater million million of case so
S0541	right
S0540	you be actually save a lot of money by eliminate the kind of manual labour but er er create er an intelligence you know
S0541	yeah
S0540	almost artificial intelligence
S0541	yeah yeah
S0540	to erm to to to have this kinda automate system to deal with mass data
S0541	yeah yeah
S0540	you know and that's more like that's the kind of approach we have now in anything any process
S0541	but
S0540	any any
S0541	don't you think though the it industry be kind of decimate everybody every other industry but it's like the the industry itself be get bigger cos obviously there's more people to kind of you know create these solutions that be decimate every industry so soon there'll be nothing everybody be gonna be clean floor or they're gonna work in it
S0540	no you can have artists
S0541	oh god
S0540	designers or you know the erm the problems
S0541	it's so grim and just
S0540	but you know but there there there have be some publications on what artificial intelligence cannot do and then what humans can do
S0541	yeah yeah yeah
S0540	and the difference be clearly say
S0541	yeah
S0540	artists cannot be replace by artificial intelligence
S0541	no it's true
S0540	it's rather so you you make cake
S0541	yeah
S0541	you know what i
S0541	more and more i think that cake make be the only solution
S0540	ice cream ice cream

S0540	mm
S0541	he couldn't give me one single thing
S0540	yeah i think you know maybe they're just go through this process of oh my god we've get to do something about it but we don't know what to do and we've get to you know talk to a specialist
S0541	it be the most bizarre brief session i've ever have in this
S0540	yeah
S0541	i mean they they be just like two men with like no kinda like social grace or awareness or no like he's a business guy you'd think that he'd have some kind of like you know
S0540	yeah
S0541	some kind of like kind of personable type of like but he have it be almost like they have asperger's or something
S0540	it's so
S0541	oh oh oh god i and then and then he so then he's like well you know can you quote us and i say i can't i say i can't quote you because i you know i say there's all this stuff all this other stuff down the bottom i say i haven't even look at this stuff there be like page and page and page of stuff like that he'd write just shitloads of it i say you know i have to go i say i have to look at it all and then i would spend like a whole day put everything off look at it
S0540	oh dear
S0541	before i even like you know i mean how can you rewrite you can't go about you've gotta look at stuff you've gotta examine it you've gotta think about it you've gotta have like an
S0540	yeah

S0540	oh yes
S0541	well you don't have a home at the moment so it's not of interest but in case you ever do they basically have a board in the white goods department with little card on it

S0540	mm
S0541	and erm so it's actually quite quite i use it when i first get it i be very frustrate by it
S0540	mm
S0541	cos i've just think you can't do anything with it but now there be more and more functional apps so you can actually do more functional things on it now
S0540	especially with the key key key erm type board i guess
S0541	yeah but i mean it's still nothin like a laptop
S0540	yeah
S0541	it's it be a consumer toy
S0540	but it i think it's really you know a you know useful like you can sit on the grass and then read
S0541	i i don't know i mean i at the time i think shall i get an and erm macbook air and i wish that i have do because you know you're look at four hundred pound for a toy which be basically an oversized phone next to
S0540	you know my brother be go to give me their old mac air
S0541	be he
S0540	mm maybe we can do a swap
S0541	why
S0540	er so
S0541	oh you want that for that
S0540	yeah er my brother say erm yes i could have his ipad no mac air
S0541	that's good
S0540	but old one
S0541	yeah
S0540	yeah but i prefer a pad
S0541	i've get an old one actually but it doesn't run anything i don't think any more
S0540	you mean mac air
S0541	no an old ipad like first gen but it won't run anything i don't think
S0540	oh i see
S0541	i don't think it will erm cos it you know they they just they've get inbuilt erm obsolescence basically i should've sell it on ebay
S0540	oh you mean you don't update it you don't update the os
S0541	it's get inbuilt obsolescence so it will not run erm
S0540	oh so you can't update your os
S0541	well you can but i after two and a half years
S0540	yeah
S0541	i couldn't update it any more so it have a lifespan of two and a half years
S0540	oh that's outrageous
S0541	it be outrageous for something that's four hundred pound
S0540	that's absolutely outrageous
S0541	yeah it's really bad so this be kind of this i buy last year so i'll be lucky i mean maybe i'll get another year out of it they're terrible they're absolutely that no it i don't any more
S0540	i mean should you shouldn't you take it to the app store i mean i've never hear of
S0541	what do you mean
S0540	that software relate obsolescence
S0541	yeah it's deliberate so you buy the next model up
S0540	but that doesn't happen with laptop or iphones
S0541	no but it happen with iphones
S0540	no you can update it
S0541	i know but you can't run half the stuff on it if you can't once you reach the point where you can't it won't run the the new operate system
S0540	oh yeah yeah
S0541	then you can't update any of your apps right
S0540	yeah i mean i that's the stage my phone be yeah
S0541	yeah you can't run anything on it any more and it's not compatible with any other apple thing it's such a rip off the whole thing be i wouldn't get one if i i mean i i like it it's it's an indulgent toy that's what it be it's an indulgent toy
S0540	mm
S0541	but erm and it and it's kind of like even i mean it's a consumer gadget
S0540	i know but i'm just say it's so useful
S0541	it's useful for kind of not do anything
S0540	i would be read a lot on
S0541	i do i read a lot of crap on it and i watch a lot of yoga videos
S0540	no i'm talk about document here lot of pdfs paper like journal paper
S0541	yeah
S0540	cos i have all my data in in in in digital file you know
S0541	i know but it's not it's not a good way to store them either i mean now there's a drive and you can store things on it but
S0540	no because i have the old you know the in everything in icloud include under my icloud i have everything in dropbox folder so i can connect it to this
S0541	mm
S0540	and then access my you know journal paper
S0541	but you can't connect anything to that
S0540	can you not
S0540	because you
S0541	well you can get an app you can get a dropbox app but you can't put a hard
S0540	yeah
S0541	disk you can't connect a hard disk to that
S0540	no so erm erm obviously i mean this be just an extension to what i you know my computer
S0541	yeah
S0540	yeah i wouldn't use this as my main kind of device but er
S0541	no but even in term of like what you can store on it you're even limit to a certain degree to the type of file that you can store on it
S0540	mm
S0540	same as phone iphone
S0541	it's not it's not kind of it's not build for business like it's not build for not business but it's not build for professional usage for file kind of i i dunno there's certain file that it won't allow you to store it's really frustrate
S0540	really
S0541	well it's only now it's only recently allow you to put pdfs on there but for example
S0540	really that's outrageous
S0541	well no no no but for example like what have i get in my cache
S0540	cos i can store pdf on iphone
S0541	no you can pdfs you can but
S0540	mm
S0541	in in your drive so the cloud drive so so then i try to put pdfs in here it won't allow me to store anything in here right
S0540	well that's annoy
S0541	so i can only put all the pdfs on the upper level of it
S0540	mm
S0541	and then here i can put spreadsheets that's fine
S0540	mm
S0541	but then and then word document i can put in page
S0540	mm
S0541	or they convert it to page es
S0540	mm
S0541	and then if i then if i open that on a mac
S0540	mm
S0541	it will convert it to word
S0540	mm
