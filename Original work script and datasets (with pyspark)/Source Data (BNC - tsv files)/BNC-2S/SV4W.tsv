S0439	no no no literally and cos they're australian they've come over and they're only over for a certain amount of time they're try to like make the most of be in europe so they're travel they do a lot of it so they've be to greece they've be
S0444	yeah have you get any set plan and date
S0439	er like they've do quite a lot thank you erm and they want to go to barcelona and they be i be like well do you mind if i come next time you know if you're go and she literally ring me on thursday and be like me and be book these flight if you want to come you know you're welcome to
S0444	yeah yeah
S0439	and they and i ring and be like shall we go to barcelona and she be like yes so we randomly book flight like that night but it be really weird they've go for the flight on the afternoon of the friday at four o'clock and they're come back the afternoon of the sunday so they're literally get a day and like a day and a half there
S0444	i mean i've do that i have do that it be like feasible but it you've just get to choose what you want to do
S0439	yeah but exactly but me and we book the flight cos i have the day in lieu anyway so i'm take the friday off and we book flight on the thursday night and they be like thirty quid cheaper to go on the thursday night and to come back on the sunday
S0444	so why wouldn't you go then
S0439	cos you'd have to take a half day or a whole day on the friday anyway because
S0444	yeah exactly where be you fly from
S0444	yeah you
S0439	but you have to get to for what like one o'clock two o'clock and if the flight's at four you know you still have to take like a half day and stuff so i be like me and just we're just like it doesn't make any sense and like yeah we have to pay for an extra night
S0444	but
S0439	but extra night or a more expensive flight you know so yeah i'm go to barcelona
S0444	nice i love barcelona
S0439	i have never be and i'm so excite
S0444	i mean i be not your template of what to do in barcelona so
S0439	i don't want to know what you get up to in barcelona
S0444	no i i just drink sangria and have tapas sit on the beach and walk
S0439	that's what me and be go to do apparently the beach isn't very good
S0444	i quite like it
S0439	be it nice i really want to see the sun go down
S0444	mm
S0439	sound really sad i realise but
S0444	no that's quite oh the let me know when you're well obviously you let me know when you're go but i think my guide book be hide somewhere but i will try and root it out but you know there be there be lot of kind of cafes and things by the beach and then there's like a cable car that you can take
S0439	i've hear the cable car yeah
S0444	that's good because the cable car if you take it from the beach side over to the park you go near a rooftop bar that's actually quite nice cos you can see all obviously but you land pretty much there
S0439	yeah
S0444	so me and be like oh let's take a look at what this bar be like and it be actually alright so it be like
S0439	love a rooftop bar
S0444	you know and you just look over the beach but you see the rest of barcelona so it's like oh yeah that's that one that's that one that's that one
S0439	that's cool
S0444	cos obviously we didn't have we have what like a day and a half pretty much there
S0439	yeah cos that's why so me and have two and a half days and then i think in a way we're kind of happy that and be come the next day because like we're not sure really what they want to do and we want to see some more cultural things and we're not sure if they just want to go and get drink or
S0444	yeah it's the kind of thing that if you want to go and see the gaudi or you want to see some of the art museums then you can do
S0439	yeah which i want to do
S0444	like that be the bite that i couldn't do
S0439	yeah
S0444	like i manage to see some of the stuff but not all of it i still would really recommend go and see the fountain
S0439	be you which fountain
S0444	the i can never pronounce it but it's the one with the light and the
S0439	ah i love a good old flash erm fountain
S0444	it's it's better than vegas
S0439	i'm so sad really
S0444	yeah
S0439	oh okay i'm go to see that
S0444	erm basically what we do be go like six o'clock we go on the cable car drink on the rooftop bar walk through the park to then find the museum where there's all the kind of waterfalls and fountains and then at the bottom of those cascade it's the big fountain and then all the cascade
S0439	i'll have to have a look at it and do it go off like
S0444	yeah regular like every half an hour fifteen minutes something like that so
S0439	regularly okay
S0444	so yeah it's constant pretty much
S0439	yeah
S0444	it's tourist mad
S0439	yeah i can imagine i can imagine it's ram it would be quite nice to go at like eleven o'clock though like at night when it's not as busy
S0444	yeah yeah and it's actually cos like you know all we saw a few place that they're use to people come at ten like and i eat pizza at at one in the morning
S0439	yeah i can imagine i really can imagine but like me and get there really late on the thursday we get there like eleven o'clock
S0444	that'll be fine
S0439	well that's what i think and me and be like well we're go to be tire but at least we can have a lie in the next day and just explore and then and will arrive at like eight or nine o'clock the next day and stuff so we have the whole day to ourselves and like to chill and drink and just relax and so i'm really excite about it

S0439	yeah and i be just like okay and then he's like yeah i'm move in with my girlfriend and like and he be like oh yeah i tell her she be really brave and i be like some would say brave others would say stupid
S0444	say stupid
S0439	each to their own and that be you know be the last thing he say cos he be like we're not all cynical like you i be like i'm not cynical i just it's to nothing to do with cynicism i just don't trust people who give me a reason not to and i just leave it at that cos it's basically just like i don't trust you
S0444	yeah
S0439	so
S0444	and if there's and if you're go to be friends can you really be friends with someone you can't trust
S0439	it's just i just feel so sorry for his girlfriend like she's move in with him and everything and then he's just like flirt with other people
S0444	i don't yeah i can't believe she move from australia she's move in with him like i don't know
S0439	it just it just make me feel a bite embarrass for her
S0444	yeah but also not be funny but she's be with him for how long now
S0439	not even a year
S0444	but long enough to be able to see through things
S0439	yeah yeah
S0444	it's long enough to pick up a vibe
S0439	like no no
S0444	and you don't know this girl and you don't know whether she's his equivalent
S0439	no not at all
S0444	like you know what i mean like you just don't know
S0439	mm you just yeah it's kind of one of those things like if if my if i be see somebody and they be send ex their ex text message that he be send me even though none of them be horrendously explicit
S0444	yeah no
S0439	i still wouldn't be happy
S0444	be be still like i remember like on the night that he ask or the day that he ask me out like the night before be 's birthday so it be the kind of thing that come up oh so and so have a birthday so i be like click on the profile it be like oh i shouldn't have do that like have a look through it but i be like er okay whatever
S0439	yeah
S0444	and i be like do i send a message because i've never go a time without send a message but i don't want to
S0439	and it's and because because facebook highlight it kind of one of those things that if i don't do it
S0444	yeah but it's one of those weird things
S0439	it's so obvious
S0444	so i look through the profile then decide not to but i kind of tell and he be like er why do you why do you check it and obviously start think why be she worry worry about her ex or whatever so
S0439	yeah
S0444	so you know it's that i don't know like
S0439	exes especially for like how long you be go or you be see how long i be see like they're always go to be important i think
S0444	yeah if
S0439	but
S0444	like i be think like you know if if they be ever in trouble we would try and help them but
S0439	yeah of course
S0444	we've both kind of draw a line and be like no i'm never go back there again i think like
S0439	yeah that's actually i
S0444	we've both move on
S0439	on yeah and in harper lee's book it be in like her new one it's really good erm there's one line that say erm the other woman have turn into the psychiatrist's couch or men make men make the other woman a psychiatrist couch and i be like
S0444	yeah that's true
S0439	that be so right
S0444	that and that be what you be become like
S0439	yeah exactly be literally just come to me with his problems and ask me to solve them
S0444	that's not your job

S0444	and i be like wow that's a bite of a change but what be it that you know and she's kind of like well i need to get these grade and i be like well have you look at these unis or have you google this search term or this search term and i be sit with her with all the university stuff and it be really it be really good and she have get a really level head like level head on her shoulder which be really good but i have no idea what's go on with so basically
S0439	yeah what be go on with
S0444	so she's say i didn't have a clue that's why i be try to kind of figure it out but like the guy be there and it be like well
S0439	so weird so she be see some other guy so how long ago that be like two weeks ago
S0444	right so she's be she's be like no so she's she's still with the guy that she be with a couple of months ago or a year ago or so she she's still with him obviously off and on
S0439	yeah
S0444	but they get back together after their big break up and what have you and blah blah blah
S0439	yeah
S0444	and then all of a sudden she's she through facebook reconnects with this guy who be her friend from school
S0439	okay
S0444	turn out he's live in london great so they meet up they live in they when she go to london they have a great time he come to oxford they have a great time erm and then you know she's be talk to me and she's like i think i'm fall for him i be like okay

S0444	and er but then obviously her boyfriend be still in the picture and then it's like okay then and then so this guy turn up they'd be skyping like every day and talk to each other all the time that they can so obviously like they like each other erm and i think everything be go well like not as in like i don't know i didn't know whether they have cross those line or not or whether they be just hang out but everything seem okay he seem he seem like a nice guy he do all the wash up he say hi he's talkative
S0439	mm so be that the guy who be there tonight
S0444	yes so erm and and he get on with the kid like i think it's just like you know he's just my friend and i've get that's fine
S0439	yeah yeah
S0444	erm and then when she come back in that's why i be a bite like okay erm cos obviously it look like she'd be like cry and i be like okay and then when i walk out the first time the guy be there and i be like alright what what's go on he's still around but he's a bite i don't know and then like when i come back in she be in the kitchen and i be like be you okay she just start cry she be like i'm just so tire
S0439	what tonight
S0444	yeah as in like when i be come back to get the wash cos i be like she's not okay and the kid aren't in i i hope that it's not you know nothing like
S0439	major yeah
S0444	major erm so that be
S0439	so be she over with the boyfriend
S0444	no i don't know what the status be with the boyfriend
S0439	this woman get so much action it's ridiculous like how like she's a very good look woman but still wow
S0444	but it's like i be like i be think it's such a it's such a hard thing if you've get like a man and this be the case i be think this earlier like and one of the other girls that i go to uni with absolutely stunningly beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful but they can never find the right guy because the guy that throw themselves at them and they're so adore of them that they will mistake that for love or something different and then you know it's always hard to tell but yeah so i i don't particularly know what's go on cos she just go i'm so tire and start cry and go i'll talk to you about it later i be like alright you know where i be but you know obviously she won't come and talk to me about it
S0439	oh no no welcome to like go and have a long chat with her don't worry about me
S0444	oh no but she she won't no but she probably won't do if he's still stay
S0439	oh yeah if he's stay over yeah
S0444	i don't i don't know whether it be to do with the boyfriend i don't know whether it's to do with the guy i don't know whether it's to do with
S0439	but she kind of no offence but she kind of always put herself in these predicaments
S0444	oh she so do like
S0439	like she doesn't help herself it's just like
S0444	this be what i be think i be like you know but i can understand it though because you know she be beautiful she's very talkative she's very sociable she's very chatty she's very amiable and she know how to work people
S0439	yeah
S0444	erm
S0439	charismatic
S0444	very very very charismatic and you know i just i just don't know but i just hope that she's okay i'm just like she doesn't half run herself through the emotional mill like
S0439	yeah
S0444	you know she be finally start to get on her feet like she be make redundant and whatever
S0439	yeah have she get a job now
S0444	yeah yeah yeah she's work at the university and that's go really well but
S0439	oh cool
S0444	it's it's the kind of thing where you know she's really put her back on her feet she be like no i'm go to focus on me i'm go to focus on the kid i'm gonna be a better mother i'm go to be this this this and i be like cool alright
S0439	yeah
S0444	so we'll just we'll just see i hope she's okay but it's probably just one of those things that'll blow over maybe it's not maybe it will be but i've i've be through the wave enough time
S0439	yeah i can imagine
S0444	yeah okay
S0439	drama
S0444	but you know it it doesn't mean that you care about that person any less and you'll still go with them through any dramas that they will be but
S0439	yeah yeah of course
S0444	you know i'm just it's just you know and you've say this yourself it's hard to see someone in a situation where they're just go to hurt themselves but you know so we'll see but i don't think she probably won't confide in me or say anything until he's go
S0439	yeah no yeah course yeah yeah
S0444	you know we'll see
S0439	but how be you and mr how's that go
S0444	ah
S0439	be it all good
S0444	yeah he's he's good we're we're much better have time apart be actually really good
S0439	yeah cos i know obviously the last time i saw you you be have a bite of a rough day with him
S0444	oh that's the yeah like yeah but i think we've kind of i think that's just the kind of thing where like i be still struggle with like you know what be an expectation of a relationship what be a relationship what what isn't a relationship you know
S0439	yeah
S0444	but erm
S0439	i think a relationship be whatever you feel be comfortable for you and them at the time isn't it
S0444	yeah exactly and to be honest we haven't really we haven't really figure it out or more to the point we didn't you know we understand that it would be different but we didn't understand how it would be different and it's the kind of thing that you know with communication it's like well i'm go to fly off the handle or like you know
S0439	yeah
S0444	or you know and i think it's that kind of thing just be like actually all so the expectations that you have get rid of them because they're not in the situation it doesn't mean that you shouldn't aim for things or you know want things but all the expectations or baggage that you have from somebody else get rid of them
S0439	yeah
S0444	you know cos it's the kind of thing that like oh this be be different a lot of the time it wasn't like i be be clingy but i be constantly aware that at some point might turn around and not want to be with me especially when i get really quite erm
S0444	yes please

S0444	no no by everyone else who do
S0444	like media research and market design be still in the same place as well
S0439	i guess it's because media research be so small they didn't really know where to dump them then i guess actually project management be really small and they move them
S0444	mm do you talk to the team much
S0439	mm yeah i still contact i speak to a bite cos i also have him on chat so i occasionally apparently be in a relationship with this guy so that's good
S0444	which guy
S0439	i dunno just a guy she meet i think he's quite old but
S0444	oh okay
S0439	you know each to their own erm everything's all tick along apparently they're not erm re recruit for the project managers they're just leave the three that there be and then they're go to let them literally just whittle down
S0444	mm great
S0439	yeah
S0444	what about the ones in
S0439	erm ones in erm that's still a big team but it's more corporate like they do all the corporate products they don't do products like like educational products they do like big like corporate project and stuff like that so i have no idea
S0444	would you like some more chip
S0439	i might nick a chip in a moment yes
S0444	okay cos i'm go to pour them on my plate but
S0439	i'm i have literally annihilate this
S0444	just just grab
S0439	i didn't even think i be this hungry so
S0444	mm
S0439	movie tonight be we movieing
S0444	maybe watch a movie i don't know how full we would be
S0439	mm
S0444	we'll have to choose something off netflix
S0439	mm
S0444	er because my dvd player doesn't work
S0439	to be fair netflix have a lot of choice go on so i think we'll be fine
S0444	unless you want to watch celebrity masterchef
S0439	strangely enough that actually sound really funny
S0444	i actually do love celebrity masterchef
S0439	i really like masterchef i'm always in denial about it but i really like it
S0444	i love it i watch four episodes this week
S0439	really
S0444	mm well what else be i suppose to do i'm not allow to go to the gym
S0439	true
S0444	i can't go out massively socialise
S0439	oh my god your social butterfly like inner self must be die
S0444	yeah but it's the kind of thing that on some level i know it's good for me
S0439	mm definitely
S0444	but also i know that this weekend would be busy so
S0439	yeah with all of us awesome people descend upon you
S0444	i be think that though just right before you arrive it's just you know how lucky i actually be you know i have a nice group of people here but then you know friends like you and
S0439	me
S0444	that be will to travel and my clan and you know obviously but i'd never know what to class he's not family and he's not a friend so
S0439	he's your boyfriend
S0444	oh he's my boyfriend oh damn it
S0439	boyf
S0444	i still get have to get use to that
S0439	the boyf i think i have mini panic attack every time i think of be in a relationship i'm twenty three i can't deal with it
S0444	to be honest i i mean i be no expert and by no mean do i think that it's perfect but
S0439	whenever relationships be never it's people who think that relationships should be perfect always the ones who be complete like morons
S0444	yeah i mean at the moment i make him happy he make me happy we still have our own kind of live it's the kind of thing where a lot of people be like oh so when be you go to move in together it's like actually no we know that at some point we have to stop be completely separate people and have a life together but that time be not now like
S0439	no
S0444	obviously we're together and we enjoy each other's company but it's i would never want to stand in the way of his career he would never want to stand in the way of mine
S0439	yeah no
S0444	he would never want to stand in the way of my friends and you know and i think that's the thing like it's a lot to do with the fact that like the expectation it wasn't even say it be kind of like oh i have to see you every week
S0439	yeah exactly you definitely don't have to see that person every week
S0444	and it's like oh like and that's what i mean like we talk a lot but it's the kind of thing of know you know actually you know we go four weeks without see each other
S0439	mm
S0444	and you know it wasn't brilliant but
S0439	it's not as bad as you think
S0444	we be okay as soon as we saw each other we be you know we be okay and i mean i wasn't with it half the time anyway so you know you can't really judge but it be you think like we be both just like actually you know now that be know we can survive it
S0439	i really enjoy have like time apart from people
S0444	it can it's more you know and it actually it's better to see people when you want to see them rather than when you feel like you have to
S0439	yeah cos then it become an obligation
S0444	yeah and it's the kind of thing that i'm just like actually yeah to be fair when be you suppose to see your friends like you know he doesn't have as many as me or you know meet them as often cos you know guy friendships be slightly different but
S0439	yeah no but that's what say to me like when i say to him like i'm not you know something isn't work he's like no i agree something really isn't work but he turn around and say but i would still like to be your friend cos i actually don't have many friends in i be like that's fine you know like i'm happy to be your friend i don't find it awkward you know like that's why i say to him i be like do you still want to go to this comedy thing together cos we book it when we be date and he be like yeah i'd love to go and he come out on saturday because i think people kind of don't really understand the importance of actually have friends
S0444	definitely
S0439	like i erm it be really good actually like my housemate and like my best friend from school we obviously live together and like i we're have a girls' night next friday we're go into town we're go out to dinner and she's go out into town with her some work colleagues
S0444	mm mm oh okay
S0439	and they're have a cocktail make session at but a lot of her work colleagues be like old so they're go to be go home quite early and she's still out and i be like well why don't you come out with us you know come out with me and my girls you know like let's have fun have a girly night you get to meet you've never meet her you know you get to meet the rest of my friends and she be like yeah
S0444	but maybe that's a little bite intimidate though
S0439	well no no cos be like she just doesn't do anything like erm last weekend her entire weekend be be erm the big weekend it be three days of music festival chill you know you sit in a park you eat drink just chill with people listen to music have fireworks and be over for one night and they didn't do anything they just go they just sit at home and i be like come to the big weekend there's fireworks it'll be a really awesome experience you know you and can get out of the house and she be like no we could but no and i be like okay fine and then i kind of i maybe be a bite sharp with her but i do it in a funny way i be like come out with us on friday because you know like you all you do be sit in your room and talk to you know like reality if you and break up
S0444	what would you do
S0439	what would you do you know you don't want to get back into that rut that you be before when you be go out and then you break up and you kind of like she become really sociable again cos she didn't have a boyfriend and then the moment they get together she suddenly be like no no no i'm back with him i don't need my friends and i be like
S0444	yeah so what do she say to that do she say anything to it
S0439	she didn't she be actually i think she be go to go really angry about it actually but then the next night she come downstairs she sit in the kitchen with me for like a good two hours we have a really good nice like bond we have a really nice chat she be like oh yeah okay so next friday you know i'm i'm really up for it i'll come out and meet your friends you know like we'll get a taxi back together it'll be really fun and i be like yeah this be my best like this be my friend i genuinely felt like i be lose her cos all she do be sit in her bedroom and talk to her boyfriend and it's just it's so nice to think that like you now that you you appreciate the fact that you actually sometimes it's nice to have space and it's nice to just spend time with your friends
S0444	and he say the and this be the thing he say the exact same thing not that either of us felt specifically but we be just like to be honest when we when we come into this neither of us want to you know give up our live that we be have yes maybe less gallivant for me would be good
S0439	mm
S0444	but it's like i regularly have you know the think that you say to your friend which be you know if i break up with would my friendships still be the same
S0439	yeah
S0444	it's kind of well actually you've get to put the work in
S0439	yeah
S0444	like you know and it's like you know my auntie and uncle in i haven't see well i haven't see them in age cos obviously when i be stay in i be stay with because you know he be a bite like oh why would you stay with them and not me but then he kind of understand it's like but they're my family like i have to see them
S0439	yeah yeah
S0444	and i go so i i wasn't after you ring i be feel fine and then all of a sudden it be like oh not feel so good
S0439	yeah
S0444	so i kind of stay in bed most of the afternoon and i be like i'm just go go to my auntie's cos i can rest there and then i'll go to from central in the morning you know so it all kind of work out in the end
S0439	yeah i'm so sorry about that
S0444	no no no i'm just like i think it's more i think it be like i say to you i be like i'm so because i'm be tell not to overdo things
S0439	yeah
S0444	or not to push through or not to do things i'm really hypersensitive to when other people say it so i be like don't like especially when it's things like your back i'm just like no cos if you ruin if you ruin that you could be ruin for months
S0439	yeah i couldn't drive they day i do it like push the clutch down be so painful i try basically to i nearly have to call someone to come and drive my car home for me i be in so much pain it's better now like it's a bite sore and a bite tender but i can move

S0444	it's all about the context it's like
S0439	yeah why do people order coffee at the restaurant but they won't drink it at home and i be like i drink it at home so it doesn't make sense but for other people i don't know
S0444	it really do though cos i will not choose to drink coffee
S0439	no
S0444	unless i'm really really tire

S0444	yeah oh my auntie's go to the alexander mcqueen i think it might be tonight actually
S0439	cos yeah you send me that link they're extend it aren't they cos it's so popular
S0444	yeah and they're do a twenty four hour kind of open which be fab
S0439	they must be make so much money out of that
S0444	yeah but you can imagine how much money it actually cost to put on as well
S0439	i be think that do they get like the clothe donate to them or do they have to pay there to exhibit them
S0444	erm could be a bite of both
S0439	yeah
S0444	for particular piece it could be a but usually stuff be like on loan
S0439	yeah
S0444	that either they get their name publish in the or you know there will be some deal and barter go on but you know it's the kind of thing that
S0439	yeah yeah definitely it be actually an amaze exhibition wasn't it
S0444	it's such a i be try to i be try to explain to it my auntie cos like you know i be like i'm no fashion expert but
S0439	no
S0444	the way that the exhibit be stag like i be try to explain it to her that you know as you go in you think mm really
S0439	yeah
S0444	monochrome be a bite kind of basic but then as it go on it get more and more sophisticate and you'll go from one minute be in a room full of skulls
S0439	yeah
S0444	to the next minute be in a really really bright red drive traditional more normal look clothe
S0439	mm exactly
S0444	and then you'll go through to the big finale which be obviously the cabinet of curiosities
S0439	yeah
S0444	and like i be a bite like there's there be too many people in there
S0439	there be they let in too many people
S0444	to enjoy it
S0439	i can understand why the want to get so many people through because so many people want to see the exhibition but
S0444	it be full i'm not be funny but i be be funny it's the kind of things where it's like people with prams don't do it
S0439	yeah no people with people with prams there be so many place they should not go
S0444	i mean like i you know
S0439	you can't discriminate but
S0444	definitely you should go but that with that many people
S0439	but why would your kid even yeah why would you take it it's just
S0444	well i suppose you have to but
S0439	yeah
S0444	it's the kind of thing where it's like let them in at a time when there's not so many people walk round cos it's not just that you're kind of have to move a pram it's more like what if somebody trip or elbow or you know it's just not safe
S0439	yeah
S0444	but like
S0439	they do let too many people in but it be a stun exhibition wasn't it
S0444	although my my auntie's niece on the other side of the family erm be do her phd in fashion like kind of history more textile kind of thing
S0439	yeah
S0444	erm but she do a lot of work with the v and a and we be and she doesn't really talk that much but she definitely start talk about the exhibit and we actually have quite a bite of a conversation about it and it be great but you know erm
S0439	yeah it's it's just a really
S0444	it's a really really good one i hope
S0439	stun one
S0444	but i honestly don't think it would have be as good if it hadn't have be in the meet cos it be the meet over in america
S0439	yeah
S0444	that have stag it all and then we just nick the stag so it be the kind of thing that if we hadn't have do if they hadn't have do it first we would never have come up with something so elaborate and so dramatic in a way
S0439	no no it be that box of that box of curiosities at the end wasn't it that be intense that be you just walk in and it felt like a creepy children's film but beautiful at the same time
S0444	and also yeah and also the bite that be just after the kate moss thing where
S0439	yeah that be stun
S0444	that be so cool
S0439	that be so clever
S0444	and then like you know i'm all about like i'm not really about the skulls or the random head of things or
S0439	no and like that wildlife one you know like the african one i be a bite like no i would wear any of those
S0444	that be a bite like i'm a bite freak out right now i mean
S0439	yeah i don't think i would wear any of those clothe really but
S0444	no you wouldn't wear anything it be the most weird kind of dinosaur shoe that's like dinosaur egg shoe that's the only way i can describe them
S0439	you can understand why lady gaga like him so much
S0444	oh yeah
S0439	can't you definitely right up her alley
S0444	yeah but it i honestly think that you know i think this be this be what it say anyway in one of the kind of texts be that you know those and it be like i be say to you before it be like those people be on such a different creative plane
S0439	yeah
S0444	that no wonder they feel so isolate or so different or just on a different level it doesn't mean it's any better but it's a very different way of think and approach things which be great
S0439	no mm
S0444	but it also mean that you know with great power they be
S0439	yeah cos he obviously be so not mess up but there's something so bad
S0444	obviously so in turmoil like you know
S0439	yeah yeah so sad that something happen like cos he kill himself didn't he it's just
S0444	yeah yeah
S0439	it's a really sad thing oh my god these look amaze

S0439	obviously everybody like you
S0444	but you know they be a lot better to me than the market department they be much nicer to me in term of when i get back all of them be instantly on chat like once they see i send an email to one of them oh my gosh you're back what be we go to do without you like this be this be crazy we don't want you to leave ever
S0439	mm
S0444	or like you know it's the kind of thing or like all of them kind of email me and when be like hey hope you're rest up and feel better they don't know what be wrong but they know that
S0439	that something happen
S0444	yeah and erm
S0439	shit go down

S0439	mm
S0444	erm and then you know it be kind of they be like oh my gosh it be only when you be go that we realise how good and how quickly and how well you do things
S0439	yeah
S0444	because the stuff that we you would usually get do in a day it take two or three meet for other people to get their head round like what be that
S0439	also not just stop you well stop you but that couple who sit next to us be the weirdest couple what be
S0444	they be odd
S0439	they be really bizarre like he spend the whole time on his mobile she look like she'd rather be like anywhere but here oh he's come back wait there stop talk stop talk
S0444	like please please please stop
S0439	yeah anyway yes yeah but you be really good at your job and i think that's what they need to be like tell didn't they
S0444	well like get it not so much but
S0439	do and stuff still work there
S0444	yeah er have just be promote
S0439	tattoo
S0444	tattoo
S0439	what's he what's he get promote in
S0444	digital service manager whatever that be
S0439	do that cause a bite of tension between him and at all
S0444	i don't know because nobody really want that job
S0439	oh
S0444	and they all get tell that they should apply for it and everyone be like meh erm be pregnant
S0439	oh the ginger haired woman who get marry a few years ago
S0444	yeah and he's alright i think he just want more money which be fair enough
S0439	everybody want more money yeah
S0444	no but it's fair enough after like five seven seven be it seven years
S0439	yeah wow he's be on the same salary for seven years
S0444	not the same subject but the same
S0439	no the same salary kind of thing
S0444	well it would keep go up i'm assume but not very much
S0439	yeah but not very much
S0444	and what be interest be that this restructure it be like no i don't believe in give people pay rise within their roles like not as in like substantial ones i i believe they should just be pay for their role
S0439	who say that
S0444	the über market director
S0439	bollocks
S0444	in which case i one of my question to them be be you go to make it transparent what the salary band be because i know that i deserve to be pay a damn lot more than i have be because i would argue okay yeah maybe i'm not do the extra project that other senior execs be do
S0439	you're busy as hell
S0444	but i be busy as hell and i'm do a lot more than some of them have be do
S0439	yeah
S0444	i mean everybody be über busy and flat out right now which be you know there's no comparison but it's not like i think i should be promote i just think i deserve a little bite more money to make it feasible erm you know or at least an inducement to stay so i think if it be the kind of thing that i be like right i've get this job offer what do you want to do
S0439	i think you should leave anyway
S0444	oh yeah i know
S0439	i don't you're not happy and it like you obviously now you're get a bite better and you be work too hard but if you be cry in a car because you didn't want to go back to work you should not be spend your twenties cry in a car hat your job
S0444	yeah exactly do that no of course not but it's also that kind of thing that it's more that i've get to i feel that i've get to prove that i'm well enough to do the work that i've get
S0439	yeah of course you do yeah
S0444	and feel comfortable within it myself but also from that lesson be like no i'm not do that
S0439	yeah definitely
S0444	and it's one of the things that i'm like right okay you've get this restructure but what be you want me to do because i will tell you flat out if it's not if it's too much
S0439	yeah
S0444	you know i'm just like i will tell you flat out if it's too much and you've already get the warn of why that's not a good thing so you can't do that again anymore you can't just pile it on and expect me to be okay with it
S0439	yeah
S0444	if you do you know and market be blame which wasn't fair at all they be like oh they put too much on you and i'm like it's not them it's actually you
S0439	yeah you've do this to me
S0444	you're the idiots who've do it
S0439	yeah
S0444	but you know like i feel less i feel so much less bother
S0439	yeah
S0444	about it not in a bad way not as in like i don't want to do well or i don't want to do my job i still you know enjoy my job i'm good at it but i just don't care as much anymore i'm not as invest or like feel that it's all on me
S0439	yeah it's not all on you yeah
S0444	well that's what i mean it's that kind of thing i'm just like actually now it's like you know the reason why i don't really want to look at the job that the recruiter's give me it's because it's for a technology company that deal with different porous materials that's not really me
S0439	no
S0444	but it's wait for that right opportunity to come along the er the the market execs library job look good but i'm i wouldn't feel right apply for a job when i'm on sick leave or when i'm just come back from sick leave
S0439	no not at all
S0444	that would be okay some people would be like yeah that's a wise move but but i would feel dishonest be like yeah i can
S0439	yeah of course
S0444	i can go for a full time role but i've just be off work
S0439	but i've just be ill yeah
S0444	yeah it's it's just not
S0439	no
S0444	it's not a good thing it's much better for me to be like yeah okay there be one period of illness that i have while i've be work over the last three years er i get the help that i need i put the tactics and the management skills in place
S0439	you've learn from it and you're sort
S0444	exactly do you know what i mean that's a much more positive story to give rather than i'm still on
S0439	yeah
S0444	you know if i be go for any job like supermarket retail office you know temp job
S0439	yeah definitely
S0444	it'd be alright but no i want a job that you know i'm interest but i know that i also need to scale what the job's go to be and if i don't get myself
