S0486	on yes right so we're record now i'll put that in the middle of the table there and we be go erm we be go to talk about the door weren't we
S0489	yes so we've get the exist open and the requirement be to have a nice door that fit in with the same style as the door that we've take out but with two large glass panel instead of one large plywood panel
S0486	yeah and you agree that that leave the er most of the glass plain will allow more light to pass from the erm from the study into the hallway
S0489	yes that's get to be the main aim what we can do be try and get erm if i look up the standard dimension of door style we can work out what the window open will be and then you can make your glass panel to suit that's probably
S0486	right
S0489	the easiest way
S0486	yes well i think you you mention earlier something about the glass be erm the right thickness to go inside the
S0489	yes we've get
S0486	the frame
S0489	to make sure that the er that the glass be be the right thickness but probably more importantly than that be the fact that it's nice and flat because if the glass be a little bite thicker than the original plywood panel would have be we can er adjust that with the bead that we've put in on the inside but if it's not flat that's much more difficult to accommodate er you know you can't really build it up with putty or or anything like that so it's it's it's get to be fairly flat
S0486	i think you're gonna have to give me a measurement of the erm thickness of the glass that you want i know it'll be er probably vary in place
S0489	yes
S0486	but we need to know what what the thickness of the glass be go to be
S0489	yes well you know you're you're gonna start off presumably with a flat sheet of glass erm and it'll get a bite distort in the fire be that be that the likely route
S0486	well here's er here's a piece of here's a piece of glass that we
S0489	yes
S0486	make before and i believe on this one erm i'm pretty sure what happen we have two piece of float glass one on
S0489	yes
S0486	the top and one on the bottom and in the middle we put various colour
S0489	oh yes that's right yes we do
S0486	can you see it
S0489	yes we do yeah
S0486	erm i
S0489	so it be a complete sandwich in fact
S0486	well can you just feel that and tell me whether
S0489	yeah
S0486	you think that that be that sandwich in between do you think
S0489	er
S0486	we certainly
S0489	maybe it be just maybe these piece be just put on top
S0486	on top
S0489	but either way they've they've melt down to a pretty uniform thickness
S0486	yeah and those be stringers
S0489	yes
S0486	you know where there's just a very thin bite
S0489	but the the bite that side which be against the mould be actually dead flat that's no problem at all that that edge there be dead flat
S0486	yeah but here you've get a bite of variegation
S0489	that's not a problem though but
S0486	no
S0489	the the the the the the edge aren't a problem but the flatness be there so if the if the piece of glass be mount on something flat in the kiln all the way round it wouldn't be an issue at all
S0486	no well that's what i'm plan to do
S0489	yes yeah
S0486	erm and erm
S0489	and if this if the glass be a little bite smaller than the wooden frame then that's great erm if it isn't small if it it actually won't quite go in the hole then we can always machine out the wood a little bite
S0486	mm
S0489	around to make up that difference
S0486	well we've get to take into account the fact that we'll need some extra glass to go round the side erm to erm sort of fit into the hole provide erm
S0489	yes the the well it
S0486	to yes
S0489	yeah it won't be part of the design be it
S0486	exactly
S0489	yeah yes
S0486	so we just leave a ridge of plain glass all the way
S0489	yes
S0486	round the outside
S0489	yes
S0486	because actually the actual pattern of the glass will be virtually and place in the middle of the two panel
S0489	yes
S0486	erm that's where the most of the thickness will be
S0489	yeah yes the the the horizontal piece that go across the sort of whatever it be two thirds of the way up or or one third of the way up whatever we choose that's obviously go to break the design but you're go to have it as if that's just a sort of shadow across and the design flow through from one side to the other
S0486	er yes
S0489	yeah
S0486	it it erm i'm start at the bottom with a lavender
S0489	yes
S0486	erm a sort of go er over to the right er a bite like look at a paint brush really
S0489	yes
S0486	so it's flow like a paint brush erm and then the i there's a slim chunk of the erm canadian maple tree will come up the middle of the glass and then there'll be the rebate go across
S0489	yes yes
S0486	and then it will continue in the next section
S0489	yes
S0486	go up
S0489	yes
S0486	and there will be
S0489	so what i'm say be the rebate sort of just hide that bite of the picture
S0486	yeah
S0489	as it be the picture be continuous
S0486	yes
S0489	beyond that rebate yes
S0486	because when i do the when i do the when i do the cartoon for the project i will make sure that erm i do two separate section of glass which and i i i'll draw the whole thing and then just cut it in half
S0489	yes yes
S0486	and so mm mm these two panel could be fire at different time or
S0489	yes
S0486	at the same time depend on how depend on how much er much scope there be in the kiln really
S0489	the other thing of course be that if we get the a new door make i haven't get to mess around try to fill in the door handle and the
S0486	no
S0489	hole in the old
S0486	mm
S0489	the keyhole in the old door or the hinge i would still have to fill in the hinge and the lock plate on the door frame that's in place but that's that's less work and the other thing we've get to remember er of course the switch will be on the wrong side of the door so i'll have to move the switch to the other side but i think i can do that by put a piece of wire across the top of the door as it be and down the other side
S0486	right
S0489	and sort of use the exist switch as a junction box
S0486	right
S0489	er it's not ideal but i think that's much preferable to have to take up the erm carpet on the land and and knock a hole through the ceiling which be much more work
S0486	yes yes i understand that
S0489	so i think that's i think that's a fairly neat way of do
S0486	yeah
S0489	because you obviously need the switch on the correct side of the door otherwise you can never get to it
S0486	no
S0489	with the door open
S0486	no i see okay and then of course there's the matter of the other erm extra panel for the wall in the hallway
S0489	oh yes
S0486	erm
S0489	yes
S0486	i think erm fifty
S0489	well
S0486	by a hundred er in size
S0489	hundred's quite tall isn't it
S0486	yeah but if you look at that i think
S0489	yes
S0486	that's nearly
S0489	could be
S0486	a hundred tall
S0489	erm i think it's a little bite less than that but but it could be taller certainly and there be space there
S0486	yeah
S0489	to do it yes
S0486	and then erm i be think along the line of a red sail and a jetty
S0489	very nice
S0486	erm and er you know erm a bite like when we go on derwent water
S0489	yes
S0486	where we be watch the boat and the the grass be and and the tree be grow right down to the lakeside weren't they
S0489	yes absolutely and and the a bite of green bite of blue er bite of grey and then the bright red sail to sort of
S0486	yeah
S0489	mm really stand out
S0486	and i be think of have the jetty go from the foreground to a vanish point
S0489	oh yes that's very er
S0486	erm
S0489	er
S0486	go off to the side
S0489	yes
S0486	and then have the sail sort of halfway down and then the background of the green tree
S0489	sound good that's a very
S0486	i think i'd make the jetty almost almost like a sort of lemony creamy colour a bite like hockney swim pool type erm idea
S0489	yes that sound good that sound good there's plenty of composition scope there with a vanish point and whatnot for the jetty yes that sound good
S0486	really quite stylise you know
S0489	yeah
S0486	erm
S0489	that sound good
S0486	so erm
S0489	that sound very good
S0486	how long have we be speak for
S0489	er then we've get the issue of light it up where
S0486	yes
S0489	as i say i've see these light strip in maplin's which be lengths of flexible almost tape that have get little leds embed within them and you can use those for sort of put behind glass or erm it may even be mount them on the wall and stand the glass off from the wall i don't know there be lot of experiment we could do there to try and
S0486	you can
S0489	er see the most effective way
S0486	i mean you can get some a really lovely you can buy them from the glass manufacturers these really lovely quite outstanding erm chromium erm fix
S0489	yes yes we've see some of them haven't we
S0486	oh they're absolutely fantastic
S0489	yes
S0486	and i'm sure they're expensive
S0489	yes yes
S0486	and you get those from
S0489	yes
S0486	and then if it stand out well i'm sure there's a plate a light that's like a plate that you slip behind
S0489	there be you can get them for actually room light a sort of an lead panel
S0486	yeah
S0489	i suspect they're probably go to be a bite bright for that but i don't know we could look at it erm
S0486	well we may not need to i mean
S0489	no
S0486	we may not need it
S0489	well i think you
S0486	i mean the other thing you could do possibly be to have a light above it erm
S0489	yes
S0486	or a light or a light under it
S0489	it maybe you can sort of put a a piece of translucent just plain translucent glass behind the the artwork and light that up as it be
S0486	mm
S0489	something like that i dunno it need a bite of experimentation doesn't it it's er
S0486	yeah i mean if it's a very bright panel
S0489	mm er maybe it doesn't need any more
S0486	erm what we've get there at the moment be erm rather dark and er
S0489	yes we could er we could aim one of the spotlight directly at it or directly at the ceiling above it or something or other and maybe maybe that would be enough
S0486	yeah yeah so erm what erm what what else be we go to get on oh yes the fence panel tomorrow
S0489	yes well we're do quite well aren't we we've do erm we're just come up to eleven and there's six to go so er we can we can bash on with that that's about erm er well it's three er three or four days' work
S0486	yeah
S0489	at our present rate so we should have that do before the weather change
S0486	and you'll be back by about quarter to two
S0489	yes
S0486	erm erm erm and i should go out er after lunch and erm paint a whole lot of er more more
S0489	yes
S0486	more panel
S0489	and i can
S0486	to put up
S0489	do the vacuum and and we'll be able after an hour or so or an hour and a half we'll be
S0486	we'll we'll have a enough to put up
S0489	we'll be able to meet up and carry on with it
S0486	yeah okay well there be erm there be other things that we should talk about to do with with the house at the moment the other thing that we could possibly discuss be the erm raise bed down in by
S0489	yes
S0486	in in the second garden
S0489	yes
S0486	erm they be so you've get you've get some timber leave over haven't you you've get some timber leave over haven't you
S0489	a rooftop a rooftop vegetable garden as it be except it won't be very high
S0489	yes we've get enough enough timber to erm do something like that quite easily i think
S0486	i have reservations about cut down a lot of the rosemary tree because i think
S0489	yes
S0486	it's really nice and
S0489	well that's okay we don't have to do what we've get to look out for be a be a steel or a erm a metal er tank type thing to form the top
S0486	right
S0489	that's what we really need we need a thing about the size of this table but eight or nine inch deep
S0486	yeah
S0489	something that that's waterproof really
S0486	yeah
S0489	er i mean i suppose it could be plastic but we could encase it in timber all the way round but it need to be waterproof
S0486	it do yes
S0489	erm and sort of
S0486	those erm those mm unfortunately those rather thick chunky offcuts that you have aren't tall enough be they
S0489	erm
S0486	the ones you've get in the erm in in the workshop you have them
S0489	no they're probably not no
S0486	but they're really i mean they'd make a really good garden bench
S0489	yes
S0486	if we could just find
S0489	yes
S0486	a nice piece of wood to go on the top
S0489	yes
S0486	like that chap use down in
S0489	yeah we could
S0486	we could put
S0489	we could we could find something like that we could find
S0486	just a plain
S0489	but we've get to concentrate on find the tank or the the the waterproof i suppose it doesn't have to be one big you know tank it could be three smaller ones perhaps and that start to lead you with the idea of plastic box but erm the and you'd probably have to cut them down a bite but something like that that we could make erm two or three separate you know patch together maybe i don't know
S0486	i don't think we're think along the same line there but never mind we'll
S0489	well we've get to think of something like that
S0486	er i
S0489	i er or we could just make it out of wood and line it with plastic sheet but it's never so good be it it need it ought to be a rigid
S0486	no i
S0489	rigid
S0486	i'm i well i know what you mean by a tank you mean like a
S0489	yes
S0486	it's like a swim pool on
S0489	yes
S0486	legs
S0489	yes that's right
S0486	and that would be full of full of earth
S0489	yes
S0486	and and therefore it won't make the timber rot
S0489	absolutely
S0486	because er it'll be erm be barriered by the plastic
S0489	yes
S0486	i can understand that
S0489	yes
S0486	so that's quite interest right so i think we'll just go on for a few more minutes talk about this
S0489	uhu
S0486	erm be there anything else you want to say oh what about take the old fence panel up that's a
S0489	yeah well i think that's that's okay we can we can start that er and the important thing be to work steadily along and er dig out the soil get out the root and put the protective barrier in and put the soil back in free of root i think probably we need to buy a riddle or something to get rid of the the the plant matter as you put the soil back in but anyway the the that's the objective and do it gradually all the way along
S0486	yeah well we need to go up to the garden centre and find out what sort of soil these plant
S0489	yes
S0486	this really dislike
S0489	yes that's right yes
S0486	because they're go berserk and they're just grow everywhere
S0489	of course some of the length we're go to do with gravel aren't we so
S0486	yes
S0489	erm
S0486	yeah
S0489	we can put down the piece of plastic a piece of polythene sheet and then put those yellow chippings on top and that's easy there's no
S0486	well
S0489	no issue there
S0486	if it's how yeah but how how why do you see that gap be you know from the from the new fence into the garden how wide do you see
S0489	oh just
S0486	two two foot
S0489	yeah mm maybe not quite that much but
S0486	but
S0489	something like that yes
S0486	you know what they're like they can come up under that
S0489	ah but
S0486	cos they've already
S0489	if we put the plastic erm er roof edge piece down into the grind so
S0486	mm
S0489	three or four inch into the grind
S0486	yeah
S0489	they shouldn't come under there
S0486	no
S0489	but even if they do they then have to negotiate er eighteen inch of barren soil under a plastic sheet under the gravel i don't think they'll get past that
S0486	no well
S0489	i should have think that be fairly erm
S0486	i
S0489	fairly secure
S0486	i hope so erm
S0489	well if they do they're more likely to be transmit by seed i would think under those condition
S0486	yeah
S0489	airborne seed than than penetrate root
S0486	right
S0489	it's interest that metal barrier there that i dig up
S0486	mm
S0489	they didn't seem to be any sign of the root go across the other side there weren't plant spread across from the other side obviously there be some the
S0486	mm
S0489	other side but i don't' think they've do
S0486	well maybe
S0489	that they've
S0486	it's a special metal they don't like
S0489	mm well that's possible i think it's
S0486	because
S0489	i think it's simply a barrier and it
S0489	stop the root go through
S0486	no people who who put the garden in originally be really keen gardeners and didn't she do a course at college and she be really up on propagation
S0489	yes i think she be
S0486	and plant
S0489	yes
S0486	and i'm sure they would have think about the voracity of the
S0489	yes
S0486	erm of of the plant
S0489	well that's possible but i i i still think the fundamental thing be a physical barrier
S0486	right
S0489	and it provide it doesn't deteriorate i don't think it really matter what it be
S0489	make of
S0486	no okay well i'm we'll leave it there then and i just give
S0489	okay
S0486	my reference erm my reference for this record be bnrbh001 bnrbh001 thank you
