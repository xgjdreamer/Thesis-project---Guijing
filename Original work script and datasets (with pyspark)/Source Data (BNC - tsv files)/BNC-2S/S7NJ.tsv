S0588	yeah it wasn't a tube though it be the overground
S0589	that's not a tube but i think it be on the tube
S0588	so they'd have to get to the overland basically which mean where's the nearest place to catch the overland from here
S0589	no fuck idea
S0588	would that be camden camden road or something
S0589	no there'd be a better way than that
S0588	yeah there would that's the only way i know gosh i mean you think oh i'm just gonna come and visit london but two people two set of people you're visit in the same city and it's like go to two different cities really
S0589	yeah that's a lot of travel
S0588	yeah
S0589	do you give them instructions how to find this place
S0588	well i've say go you can't go wrong so long as you get on the right train and it's woolwich arsenal and i've say to call when they get here and i'll come and find them because but i say to call and describe where they be cos i don't know what exit they're gonna come out of so i'll just have to try and find them i wonder what exit they'll come out of
S0589	oh
S0588	no we don't know do we
S0589	just depend just depend which escalator you get
S0588	well yeah it's random really
S0589	yeah i never know where i'm come out and i've be do it for years

S0589	oh good
S0588	so do i look alright er i do a little bite of transcribe but not very much i mainly just do the house how come you're start late do you just arrange that at the last minute so you could go out tonight
S0589	mm yeah and there's no point finish early if i just have to go round to 's
S0588	no there isn't it's true
S0589	and i finish too late anyway for to hang around for a drink and i don't have any other friends
S0588	ah so yeah that's quite sensible then creamy garlic portobello mushroom on sourdough
S0589	what
S0588	creamy garlic portobello mushroom on sourdough
S0589	yeah i say that
S0588	well i'm say it now mains which be the veggie
S0589	be that what you'd have be it
S0588	there's hardly any vegetarian options
S0589	there's only that pearl barley
S0588	yeah that's a bite weedy really i think we should probably go for pizza you say that too didn't you
S0589	do they want to eat
S0588	yes
S0589	or they've probably never be to a wimpy
S0588	yeah all day breakfast's probably still go
S0589	or would they like the italian eritrean that might be nice and fun
S0588	it probably would that's very vegetarian isn't it
S0589	yeah
S0588	be that the one with the dip
S0589	or pizza
S0588	more comfortable in the probably cos you could have a beer in there you can't have beer in can you
S0589	they have eritrean beer
S0588	do they be it nice beer
S0589	i try every single one
S0588	of course you have how many beers do they have then
S0589	i think they have three
S0588	i mean that's more londony if we do that
S0589	you've get to remember we've get to sell
S0588	yeah we do
S0589	to they will go back and they word all over all of europe will be
S0588	yeah exactly it's all down to us rest on us really the good name of in norway
S0589	there do you want to play a board game darling whilst we wait
S0588	yes
S0589	to sharpen your mind
S0588	what's there to play
S0589	also i mustn't drink too quickly like i do last time
S0588	oh it would be nice to go to the
S0589	what darling
S0588	it would be nice to go to the
S0589	oh they're play scrabble
S0588	there's a scrabble
S0588	not too much i'm already learn i've get enough on my plate with geography lessons
S0589	oh let's shall i teach you how to play mancala
S0588	yeah okay oh that's probably ours do we give that away
S0589	no well borrow it and never bring it back
S0588	be this a game that use your brain
S0589	yeah but i've never quite work out how
S0588	be it it's er it's a bite bore otherwise if it doesn't er i want brain exercise
S0589	okay so let me try and just think how you play it you pick up any one you like and then you put one in each thing and at the end of the game you see how many people how and it's over when you've free up your whole thing and you've get nothing leave i think that's right but here's a particular thing say you pick up this and you go one two and it's your last one and it go opposite in an empty one you capture all of those
S0588	and what's the object of the game
S0589	to have most things in here
S0588	to have all these things in one of these hole
S0589	yeah we'll just play it and then you'll pick it up
S0588	in there
S0589	just help me put four in each again okay you may start
S0588	do i have to start in any particular place
S0589	go clockwise no start where you like oh hang on if you end like this if your last one go in there you get another go
S0588	can you work that out or be that
S0589	well yeah cos it's
S0588	be it more random than that
S0589	it's easy now cos you know there's four and that's one two three four and you'd get another go later on when there's load it's difficult to work out
S0588	i'll do that then
S0589	so one there's one on each step this be call mancala really and it can be play on the beach with just stone with
S0588	it's pretty bore
S0589	well how do you know you've only go once
S0589	your go
S0588	er where do i pick up from now
S0589	anywhere on your side of the board
S0588	anywhere i want
S0589	yeah
S0588	it isn't go in order then
S0589	no you can do what you want sorry what's the object again
S0588	just to get as many stick in here as you can just play and it'll make sense as you go along
S0589	and how do you how do you get them in there again
S0588	every time you go past it you drop one off in there
S0589	also i should point out when you're finish you get every all the ones that a other person have leave that's important to remember all so i can do the same as you look one two three four i get another go four four
S0588	can i pick up one of these
S0589	yeah
S0588	do what you want
S0589	any of these
S0588	oh then i wouldn't go very far there either what be that opposite thing again
S0589	put it into one if i be to end up with one there i'd capture your one opposite
S0588	can't i oh but you could oh no that's yours right i don't there's strategy but i'm not know it
S0589	it won't become clear until you know how it work so we'll just rush through this first cos i've kind of forget too
S0588	so far it's very bore
S0589	oh no next stop right you could capture load by do a move so if the last one be a empty one you capture everything opposite so it so there's two move you can make to effect that no three no you've
S0588	er i've get those
S0589	no but if you'd go one you would have win all this
S0588	i have get one there
S0589	no no the last one the last that you put down
S0588	oh
S0589	fill an empty one and you you capture
S0588	the last one you put there
S0589	you capture everything on this side
S0588	oh
S0589	too late
S0588	this be stupid
S0589	stupid come on ears hang on let me see if you the instructions
S0588	i'm bore
S0589	oh yeah go on quick
S0588	so you like play this game
S0589	and i like play and there's that great picture of
S0588	and
S0589	lose to
S0588	like the shiny red ball
S0588	oh i don't know be that in there
S0589	no it wasn't have another go cos i finish there so i have to move these
S0588	why
S0589	otherwise your next go you'll go one two and capture the rest
S0588	be it greek
S0589	er i think it's more
S0588	how do you find out about this game
S0589	you see it be play on one's travel
S0588	yeah it's that sort of thing oh good be it nearly over yeah
S0589	no that's that's your go i don't think we're go to have another game yeah no carry on carry on
S0588	alright there's four of them
S0589	no that's alright
S0588	i think there be three
S0589	no but then you go again
S0588	oh why cos the last one go on there
S0589	yeah and then you can go again by do another move when
S0588	er don't i get that
S0589	no
S0588	why
S0589	cos your last one go over here
S0588	oh oh can you only go to your adjacent
S0589	just your ones
S0588	yeah but can you only go to there and you go you can just skip one
S0589	no you can't skip one
S0588	no of course you can't do you get those ones as well
S0589	it's my last one and i'm opposite yours
S0588	you get you get the opposite and you get the ones that be in your
S0589	yeah
S0588	hole
S0589	use them all up another go
S0589	another go
S0588	i wanna do that thing where you nab the opposite it's not happen yet
S0589	you've do it
S0588	i've get another go
S0589	have another go go there and then you get another move
S0588	what from there to there
S0589	no there and then it's the last one
S0588	one two three and i can get that one or just one two
S0589	correct
S0588	one two could go there
S0589	i've get nothing leave so i capture
S0588	oh
S0589	all of yours and visually we can tell that i've win
S0588	yeah
S0589	alright play once more
S0588	no bore
S0589	it be bore
S0588	be there anything more interest than that
