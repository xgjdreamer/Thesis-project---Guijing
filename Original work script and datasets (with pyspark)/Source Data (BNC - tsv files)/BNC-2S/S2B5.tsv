S0024	look there's the bus again i'm so glad they find my phone that's so funny
S0144	yeah what do she say she'd er sell it on ebay
S0024	yeah but that only work because i didn't have the answer machine message on the phone
S0144	yeah
S0024	otherwise it would have just ring three time like because i keep ring it and ring it and ring it somebody have to pick it up eventually because like they couldn't stop it from ring
S0144	yeah
S0024	that's the only reason it get pick up because otherwise it would have just keep go on to answer machine and they would never have find it underneath the seat or whatever they find it
S0144	yeah yeah yeah who find it
S0024	they must have find it on the back of the bus and run it up to the bus driver cos she be still drive
S0144	yeah
S0024	well she wasn't still drive she be pause at a roundabout or something she shouldn't have pick it up really
S0144	well it be nice they give it then cos
S0024	i don't understand how i drop it in the first place

S0144	so do you have a nice time with and
S0024	yeah we walk the dog around the
S0144	mm mm
S0024	around the bite i get really confuse actually cos when when i walk up there i think i could cut through the and walk round the back way but of course that's the way i use to go when i go to school there
S0144	right
S0024	and you go through the school and go round the back of the sixth form and end up in the field where we use to do cross country
S0144	right
S0024	but of course that's the way i go when i go to school so i walk up there and i be like i can't get through that footpath anymore because you have to i think it be a public footpath but you have to walk through the school to get to the back so i walk all the way back again and around and eventually catch up with them and lucky have run lucky run away again she hadn't take him off the lead since last time
S0144	do he be he not very er he's not very train
S0024	no they she say they've train him
S0144	he come back with a pheasant doesn't he
S0024	well no he start chase rabbit because we go past this field and there be there be just rabbit run about everywhere and then he start run miles away miles away and there's run back and forth lucky lucky
S0144	oh no
S0024	and try to do her super whistle and i can't whistle very loud eventually he come back but get it she take it quite personally that he won't come back to her
S0024	i don't know why
S0144	well
S0024	but last time they go for a walk they go for a walk and she end up phone erm 's mum
S0144	mm
S0024	to come and help her get him because he'd literally go in these woods
S0144	what he just legs it do he
S0024	and it wouldn't come wouldn't come back couldn't get back
S0144	our dog use to do that he use to be he use to be a nightmare he use to erm like if a cyclist go past that be it he be off
S0024	yeah
S0144	and he would he would like jump at the bike and
S0024	oh that's not nice that's not nice at all
S0144	it be horrible it be embarrass take the dog for the walk and he use to god he use like just crap everywhere like you'd take him for a walk around the block and he'd take a big dump outside someone's like driveway
S0024	and then you have to just walk about with your plastic bag
S0144	well this be in the nineties no one do that
S0024	oh that's horrible
S0144	so i just have to kind of leave it
S0024	no
S0144	and if someone be well i have nothing on me you know
S0024	oh no
S0144	and if someone saw you the look she give quite rightly so as well
S0024	quite rightly you don't want that on your door step
S0144	yeah but it be i use to hate take that dog for a walk i use to hate it he be just so out of control but you can i mean how old be lucky
S0024	he's only young he's young
S0144	i mean you you should be able to train him
S0024	she be talk today about put him towards some more train
S0144	but but because they find him though be a stray dog wasn't he
S0024	yeah but he be a puppy he be very little
S0144	yeah but no they're the dog we get as well but because they'd have a a bad upbringing they be difficult to train
S0024	but it be he be little he'd be abandon
S0144	yeah exactly i mean these these dog be a bite mess up psychologically i think
S0024	yeah
S0144	they're not you know if if they'd be bring up in a stable upbringing
S0024	you'd have think if they have be abandon though they'd want to cling to their new owners quite well and not leave them
S0144	yeah yeah they be more difficult to train
S0024	it's his breed as well i mean he's a he chase everything
S0144	yeah
S0024	i mean he's a hunt dog really
S0144	hmm
S0024	but hunt dog get train so that should be should be possible i don't know
S0144	yeah yeah you need to know what you're do don't you
S0024	i think they should take him to a school
S0144	we try that with our dog and he be just useless man he be just useless
S0024	some dog you just can't can you
S0144	but also like our house because i don't know it be a bite of mess really i can understand why he didn't learn anything
S0024	hmm
S0144	because it be a bite of a dysfunctional kind of environment for him
S0024	the thing be with with both both of and 's dog they've kind of they've be a bite soft on them
S0144	mm
S0024	so er when move over from she felt quite sorry for lucky and lose the cat and everything lose his like little companion that he have all of his life she they start let him sleep on the bed at the bottom of the bed and do the same when when erm her other dog die she start let larry sleep on the bed and now both of them have get this massive problem of try to get the dog off the bed
S0144	mm yeah mm
S0024	like every night i mean can you imagine every night the dog come and sleep at the bottom of on your bed
S0144	yeah i've have the same thing not on the bed but on the on the sofas
S0024	i just think no no yeah but on the sofas that's different that's not in your bed
S0144	yeah he do use to come up on the bed though but only when we be out the house and then you'd get back and he'd be like run down the stairs look really sheepish
S0024	well there you go he know that he's do wrong whereas they've kind of let him
S0144	yeah and he'd have his tail between his legs
S0024	and say you know when they change house and stuff when when everything's a bite more settle for him they'll change it but i i don't think you can
S0144	no you can't you can't teach an old dog new trick
S0024	mm yeah
S0144	you can't you have to you have to really put it in them when they're young
S0024	yeah well i don't know i think they've yeah they've make a bite of a mistake there
S0144	he's a nice dog though he be a nice dog
S0024	yeah but can you imagine every night have the dog on the bottom of your bed
S0144	no i wouldn't want that cos it stink as well and you get the hairs
S0024	and then go out and fancy a little cuddle with the dog and like you know have a little cuddle oh come here lucky in the bed no i don't like that idea at all it's horrible
S0144	yeah
S0024	it's bad habit like what be they go to do when they've get kid they'll have the kid in the bed and the dog in the bed and urgh no it's not nice
S0144	mm well they're think about live in a caravan so
S0024	oh they be talk more about caravan today
S0144	be they
S0024	yeah try i i don't know if she know all the laws because she be talk about the static static house
S0144	yeah
S0024	but i be say now i think i think they change the law so you've get to have plan permission for a static house now as well
S0144	really
S0024	think so i think so
S0144	you need plan hang on you need plan permission for a static house
S0024	yeah i think so it's not how it use to be
S0144	it depend on the dimension depend how big it be
S0024	mm mm
S0144	when a shed become a house because you can have shed with plumb and electric
S0024	well that's the well
S0144	but you you've get these little sit though with the erm with the temporary home on them
S0024	yeah but i think those temporary home i'm pretty sure now you have to have some sort of permission to go them you can't just put them up anywhere
S0144	do they have but you can but they're not build though be they you can drag them around
S0024	no they're not attach yeah but you still i think you still need permission nowadays
S0144	do you
S0024	oh i don't know but she's get all these romantic ideas about what to do and i don't
S0144	no she's get a great well they've they've both get great ideas they want to do the right thing
S0024	they be good ideas i'd love to do what they want to do but they're romantic ideas they're not practical to go
S0144	they be yeah well they they've get no kind of back up that's the problem
S0024	i mean think it's well funny cos there's these campsites that they want to go on and there's there's different kinds of camp different not campsites caravanish sit or trailer sit or something like that and like some of them you have to be over fifty five and no pet to go on them like there's certain type
S0144	mm right so they don't tick either of those box
S0024	well that's those type or the other type of site isn't the type of site they really want to go on because they're a bite rough they need like a a middle one
S0144	well yeah they well maybe there's a market for that then because you've get your your old age pensioner sit and you've get your gyppo sit maybe there will i think they will that's a good idea actually
S0024	yeah yeah yeah
S0144	especially at the moment there there's definitely go to be you know no one can buy a house
S0024	cheap accommodation sit hmm
S0144	people who want to buy just a temporary residence or a
S0024	yeah but like in a nice
S0144	yeah
S0024	but how how would you
S0144	well you'd have to buy
S0024	how would you test people on say that whether they're nice enough or not you can't can you how do you test people in say they're nice enough
S0144	no but you just need to market it a way that suggest that that's a really good idea actually
S0024	mm it's not bad
S0144	if you buy a bite of land and try and target the people that you'd like to live on it
S0024	but i think you probably have to have plan permission
S0144	what to turn it into a site yeah you would
S0024	yeah
S0144	hmm i think
S0024	but yeah you target people like them and like us who who yeah can't afford a house or don't want to go into the mortgage just yet and just want to live together in a community but not in a commune kind of thing a community not a commune
S0144	i think that's the way forward though yeah yeah mm no well i think i think a lot of people be get turn off with mortgage as well and quite rightly i think
S0024	yeah
S0144	i don't think again like what we be say earlier you get this this way of condition where you think that's that's the only route to take
S0024	mm
S0144	like in france they don't buy their house they they only erm they they only rent them
S0024	what
S0144	yeah it's
S0024	well some people must buy them
S0144	but a lot of countries they don't actually buy their house like they do in this country and you don't even now like you don't buy the house you've get your mortgage and you're just pay a long term rent aren't you
S0024	well what do they do in france just rent
S0144	yeah i think so
S0024	well who own the land
S0144	i don't know but who who do own the land anyway
S0024	that's what yeah cos rob be say the other day that that scheme remember that scheme that scheme he be talk about how they they want to sub let land and they would help you buy land it be really confuse
S0144	mm yeah
S0024	and i be say rob ultimately the queen own all of the land and he be say he be say once this scheme be into place ultimately that company this new company would own the land
S0144	yeah mm
S0024	and i be think what be the point of that i don't
S0144	hmm you have to be careful because
S0024	he he's get really catch up in all of that because it's a new age idea or something
S0144	yeah
S0024	and it's try to get away from the big company and the big but that's go to become big company just own all of the land
S0144	yeah well yeah
S0024	so you can't get around stuff like that because even if it start off have good intentions as soon as the money come in people turn company turn everything turn
S0144	mm mm yeah yeah
S0024	they get their big zombie eye and start look at those number go up in the bank and
S0144	yeah
S0024	and start think oh we own all this land now
S0144	yeah
S0024	and like might have start it might start with good intentions but i don't believe that it's sad be i a realist i'm a realist
S0144	yeah but be it not worth get in on something that's start with good intentions and then move on later
S0024	well no i'd rather have my own land thank i don't really want
S0144	yeah but how do you have your own land like really
S0024	you buy it
S0144	what either you buy it like outright
S0024	see also they think right they think you can dig dig a massive well get somebody to come around and dig a massive well and live off your water and i be say no you can't because the water board still own any water that run under the grind
S0144	mm no you can't do that well they say they will if if they know you've dig a well they will put a claim to it
S0024	exactly and they say they say you just keep it on the quiet no no no if you're not buy water from the water board and you've get a house they're go to
S0144	well that's very well
S0024	very well
S0144	say that no it's very well say that but as soon as you if you get some sort of community develop the water board would be right on your back
S0024	no it won't work yeah the water board even if you've only get one house the water board will be why why aren't you buy water from us there's no well in your area and then they'll just come around and they'll see that you've dig a well and then they'll say and then they'll charge you money
S0144	yeah well they probably wouldn't yeah that's true yeah yeah mm mm
S0024	well i don't know that's accord to my
S0144	well
S0024	well that's accord my dad i do tend to trust what my dad say about those kind of things but you don't them for sure
S0144	well no but but they look into all that when they build their house so i mean they do know quite a lot about that kind of thing
S0024	hmm yeah
S0144	even though that be what twenty thirty years ago
S0024	twenty
S0144	twenty years ago so you know it would have change since then but you have to be very careful
S0024	mm
S0144	but i think it it be a brilliant thing to do and i've get a respect for them do that cos that be the way forward to get away from all this
S0024	hmm
S0144	i mean god that home under the hammer programme that do my head in like every person
S0024	i quite like i like it sometimes
S0144	every person on there oh yeah this be go to add to my portfolio of twenty house you know
S0024	yeah
S0144	that just every time i hear that it just kick me in the ball
S0024	yeah it's not nice be it it's just like them buy more and more and more i think there should be a limit
S0144	like there's just this huge divide be drive this huge wedge be drive in this country between land owners and those who do not own land
S0024	mm mm yeah
S0144	and that it's all very well if you if you've get some kind of property fine you're laugh and if you've pay for the mortgage you've pay it off
S0024	mm
S0144	but if you haven't like us you're screw
S0024	yeah that do get me as well i think they should have a limit on the number of properties one i don't know they should have some sort of limit on how many properties you can buy and rent out
S0144	yeah or there should be some sort of incentive incentives scheme for first time buyers
S0024	cos yeah well it's just
S0144	even though that would be abuse because people who earn load of property would just put the other their sons or daughters as the first time buyer you know so it's really complex it's a really difficult thing to get sort but
S0024	yeah yeah they do that but they can't do like they can't say you're only allow to buy three properties or something because then they just class it as a business and then if it's a business then it all turn out differently and that's your business be to have lot of house
S0144	yeah
S0024	but i don't think people should be allow that business to be honest i think three house you can rent out two if necessary but no more no more than that
S0144	it be really it's difficult yeah but if it's a business that's their business
S0024	yeah but that should be enough business that's enough business you don't need any more money come in than two houses' worth
S0144	yeah but once you start say that kind of thing though then you're kind of limit progress aren't you or you've
S0024	no i think there should be a limit what kind of progress just progress on people buy house
S0144	in that sense but you have to apply that across the board i mean once you say okay that's enough you've do enough there you have to stop i mean that kind of stunt growth doesn't it
S0024	mm mm no i don't think it do
S0144	it's i i don't know what the solution be with that but i'm definitely not go to be buy a house
S0024	i'd like to buy some land i really would
S0144	i'd love to i'd love to but i won't be in the foreseeable future
S0024	that's cos you don't want the mortgage at all
S0144	yeah no i'd have to buy it outright
S0024	yeah but you can't it's not possible
S0144	well anything's possible
S0024	it's not possible
S0144	yeah it be i think i think the house market be go to crash further i don't i mean this revival in the house market i don't i don't believe it because it if you look at the interest like say from the eighties what i be do on the computer the other day
S0024	mm
S0144	how much a house cost now to how much it do cost and then
S0024	what be you do on the computer
S0144	i don't know i i i get the house price over like twenty years and then i look at the interest rat and the inflation and put that into the house price and they're still way way way over price
S0024	oh yeah yeah mm yeah yeah i know i don't understand how how like some people be say oh wow the mortgage be really good now now be the time to buy and i'm think no it's not
S0144	yeah because because they've come down yeah no it's not because they've come down in price
S0024	the mortgage might be low but the house price aren't
S0144	yeah and the interest rate set near zero
S0024	mm
S0144	that's just to tempt people in but i think it's just to tempt people in before another crash to be honest it's go to wipe a lot of people out
S0024	yeah well they be still too high i'm not go to buy one
S0144	they're not if you look at some of this crap
S0024	they're high they be high
S0144	what a hundred and sixty grand for a just a some really you know really tiny terrace house with no garden i'm not pay that no way
S0024	yeah for a rubbish i i be look around here there's no no
S0144	no
S0024	no it's terrible i mean there's hardly any garden in it either and i'm really really against buy a flat
S0144	mm if you look at the average wage price mm
S0024	i'm really against buy a flat
S0144	yeah
S0024	how do people want to buy remember those people that we meet who be they who be who be that who be erm buy some flat in some eastern european country
S0144	yeah that be in bulgaria
S0024	and they have never be there they have never see it it be all over the internet
S0144	yeah well that be a big trend yeah
S0024	and they be just they be just watch it on the internet be build
S0144	yeah yeah the trouble be that's lease hold as well they don't own it they they get it for like a hundred years and then it get give back to the erm estate or whoever
S0024	mm yeah
S0144	so it's dunno i'm not into that that that's maybe short term profit you could make
S0024	mm
S0144	but
S0024	yeah you could make some money i suppose
S0144	yeah
S0024	that's another thing we need to work out what we're go to do with that money
S0144	what in erm
S0024	share we've get to buy
S0144	waterhouse td waterhouse
S0024	yeah
S0144	erm yeah because in april they say if you haven't get five thousand something or other in the erm account you're go to get charge some administration fee
S0024	we need to work out so what be we go to do
S0144	well either we put i think you can put that money in the day before and then take it out the day after and it will be fine
S0024	really
S0144	or we can just take it out and pay the fifty pound withdrawal fine erm or
S0024	but we haven't even use it
S0144	i know but i think it would have crash before that be the problem i i be certain it be go to crash before two thousand twelve
S0024	yeah
S0144	erm but i you know i i still really believe that it's go to the market go to crash at least this year
S0024	well me too but we've get to be careful with that i mean what's what's that money do i mean they've change their and everything
S0144	well it's not do much be it
S0024	no it's just sit there
S0144	yeah but if it be in a bank it wouldn't be do much more with the zero point zero one percent interest
S0024	no it would still be sit there but the thing be we're not i don't know i mean it doesn't seem like a bank it seem like something fictional
S0144	yeah i know what you mean so either i don't know maybe we should just put it into some mine company
S0024	yeah
S0144	or withdraw it
S0024	i would like to i think we should look again
S0144	you want to gamble it or because it be a gamble basically
S0024	we've get to really look and well i don't want to gamble it all
S0144	but it's a gamble base on a bite of knowledge
S0024	yeah but if you put all that money into something then that won't be include in the five thousand pound that you need to have the
S0144	yeah it will
S0024	it will
S0144	yeah you have to have five thousand or so in your portfolio
S0024	oh yeah oh oh what do i read the other day scotland
S0144	mm
S0024	you know they want independence and everything
S0144	mm
S0024	scotland be reopen some old old mine and i want to have a look at what mine they be open
S0144	mm right there be a lot of mine that be reopen in the uk yeah
S0024	tin and copper tin and copper erm i think it be tin and copper
S0144	mm mm
S0024	and there be a gold mine as well
S0144	yeah
S0024	and i don't know it be just like why do you know why be they ask for independence now be it because they find load of gold
S0024	i don't know maybe
S0144	they wouldn't be able to keep that a secret
S0024	oh they would if they want to
S0144	they wouldn't they wouldn't
S0024	well if it's a possibility isn't it
S0144	but i know the tin mine be reopen in cornwall
S0024	yeah
S0144	because the tin price have go right up
S0024	mm
S0144	i think the gold mine yeah there be some in scotland wasn't there
S0024	mm yeah yeah
S0144	and wales they've get silver
S0024	and they're open them up and they they want to i don't know if they find again it be gold because it be gold that there be a
S0144	yeah there be this guy i think i saw the same thing
S0024	no because i didn't watch it with you
S0144	there be a guy on the on the stream like sift it
S0024	yeah but i didn't watch that with you i watch that with mum
S0144	oh okay well i saw that as well
S0024	really
S0144	he be there with the old erm the sieve
S0024	yeah
S0144	like sift away the gold
S0024	yeah he be collect his only little piece
S0144	and that be his own project every day he would go down there and
S0024	freeze
S0144	but he'd make quite a bite i think the price of gold at the moment you know and it's only go to go up as well
S0024	yeah
S0144	which be why i think
S0024	i be just wonder why you know why do they want i don't know
S0144	mm
S0024	i can't think of any reason why they want to separate from us really
S0144	well i don't know
S0024	i think they get quite good benefit from be with us
S0144	i think they've get a very good deal actually from be part of the uk
S0024	yeah from be part of the uk me too
S0144	they've get free education they've get have they get free prescriptions or something or
S0024	i don't know but they seem to have a lot more
S0144	they've get a lot more than we do
S0024	no yeah they seem to have a good deal i don't but maybe they don't i don't know i don't blame them if they want independence fair enough give them independence but i just i don't know maybe it's to do with their gold that they've find in some random place
S0144	they've find all of these millions of ounces of gold
S0024	yeah so then i be think well we should look into some scottish company and see if there be any that we would like to invest in
S0144	well i yeah and i know some
S0024	because then it's kind of invest close to home and it's not
S0144	i know some of the uk mine company
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah i write them down somewhere
S0024	so we'll have a look at them that will be that will be funny to have a look at them
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah why not
S0144	yeah cos when you're invest in gold you need to look at the politics of a country to see how stable it be
S0024	yeah
S0144	the safety of their mine operations
S0024	and they be very safe there i've i look at all of their safety
S0144	yeah well yeah europe would be okay i mean when you go to place like chile or china
S0024	oh do you know what be on the news today
S0144	what
S0024	brazil brazil have up us on their billions of erm e d no what be it e d p no their their annual figure
S0144	gdp

S0144	yeah
S0024	and brazil have like really take off in their economy
S0144	oh okay
S0024	and they be they be they be go to do they be go to do a big thing about it today actually i might have a look when i get back cos they be gonna cos they have a look and then they be look at what export brazil have brazil have oranges that's one of their main export
S0144	mm wood
S0024	oranges i have forget no it wasn't wood i can't remember but they be all good products and then they be look at the uk
S0144	belly dancers
S0024	no and then they be look at the uk and they be say manufacture be our big
S0144	manufacture be our biggest export be you kid me
S0024	that's what they say on the bbc news yeah
S0144	and what manufacture be that then
S0024	i don't know i don't have any idea what kind what do that mean
S0144	manufacture
S0024	it be manufacture and administration or something like that something stupid
S0144	yeah well it's financial products and pharmaceutical and weapons
S0024	yeah financial they didn't say pharmaceuticals or they didn't say weapons either but i guess they'd keep that quiet
S0144	well they never do
S0024	yeah but you know brazil be export oranges and they're do better than us
S0144	well look at the size of brazil the amount of people and the resources they have
S0024	yeah oh they be look at they be look at the amount of people as well
S0144	yeah but the resources they have they're way ahead they should be way ahead than the uk
S0024	and their job yeah yeah their job be better as well like they've get less people unemployed than in england which that seem crazy that we've get more people unemployed than brazil
S0144	yeah yeah yeah that be crazy yeah the only the only reason why we're do better than brazil be because we're still rap africa basically
S0024	mm
S0144	because we've still get all our finance the city of london the power be immense
S0024	yeah
S0144	and they're basically just that's where we get most of out money from that's the only way we've get our standard of live the way it be
S0024	mm
S0144	be because we're fuck other countries over i mean the empire be still alive people think the british empire be dead
S0024	no oh but jamaica want to separate from us
S0144	but it's not yeah well this be the thing people be start to wake up to this
S0024	jamaica want to separate and who be it the other day oh well it be cos they want the falkland islands back on the other argentina want falkland
S0144	yeah
S0024	be it argentina that own the falklands
S0144	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0024	yeah they want them back but now jamaica want to separate from us and they be go oh oh prince harry be over there at the moment or something
S0144	yeah well that's good time isn't it
S0024	he look really beady eye
S0144	he be he's a lizard
S0024	he look like a lizard he really do it look oh i don't know i don't like it he walk with his head down just like prince charles you know like with his head stick out
S0144	yeah it's horrible
S0024	with his beady eye look weird i don't like it
S0144	yeah and
S0024	erm but anyway what be i say they erm yeah he's over there try to strengthen our relations but god know how he's go to do that
S0144	strengthen our relations be he really do that or be he just create an illusion back here
S0024	no he's try to save it because no but jamaica be say oh well we'll separate from you but we do we do like have your support so we'll still treat the queen as exactly the same she can come and visit they say she can come and visit and she'll be treat exactly the same the prime minister of jamaica say that
S0144	yeah but do you think the average jamaican be there go oh brilliant prince harry's come over oh god i love england
S0024	no but they do they do say well have a relationship with england have help us we get advice and we get this and you know we get support when we want it
S0144	yeah
S0024	but seriously i mean so if they separate from us
S0144	yeah well that's over that's with them over a barrel with a gun to their head
S0024	if they separate from us what's like everybody's separate from us
S0144	everyone's split up this be the the trend at the moment all these countries be become smaller
S0024	yeah
S0144	it it's quite interest actually cos i think it be go to become very erm because like globalisation things be just become into one big mass which be what i be scar of
S0024	mm
S0144	but a good thing at the moment be there seem to be a trend that countries be actually separate up into smaller group and things be get small and devolve
S0024	yeah they be i wouldn't call it devolve i would call it evolve
S0144	well yeah evolve but that's what it's call devolution
S0024	but it's not devolution in my eye
S0144	no no but it's a negative word give for that purpose
S0024	mm
S0144	but like belgium have split in two hasn't it
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	and i think this be go to be a
S0024	sudan just split in two
S0144	yeah i think a lot of place even like you think of somewhere like china which be the the epitome of oneness you know when
S0024	do you remember when we be in china
S0144	yeah exactly
S0024	and they they have that north south east west divide didn't they
S0144	they have a huge divide they hat each other
S0024	they be all just slag each other off
S0144	they hat each other
S0024	yeah
S0144	and you think china be just this big communist kind of mass of work together as like a machine but you've get tibet you've get taiwan hong kong and you've get all the different state you've get outer mongolia who be very unhappy with the regime you've get the whole of the the west which be not reap any of the benefit that the east coast be get
S0024	mm
S0144	and that that's you know that's a huge problem it's go to break up like russian do i think in our lifetime
S0024	really i don't know it seem
S0144	which i think be good
S0024	i don't i can't predict anything at the moment it all seem really here and there
S0144	mm but then you've get you know there's that big debate who's go to be the next super power india or china i always think china because because of the oneness
S0024	mm
S0144	but i never really think india because they've get so many religions and so many distinct variations in their country that
S0024	they almost always have to stay together because of their differences don't they
S0144	i mean they've they've get eight hundred and fifty odd languages
S0024	yeah i know but they can't separate into little tribes they have to stick together
S0144	well yeah but they it be such a dysfunctional country wasn't it in a way
S0024	mm well yeah in a way yeah
S0144	in another way not i mean very together in another way but when you've get that many languages and that many religions all conflict with each other i mean they they be in harmony in some place but in other place they weren't
S0024	yeah
S0144	and i remember in erm darjeeling you've get the whole gorkhaland
S0024	oh god do you remember that do you remember that
S0144	they're try to get independence go on strike
S0024	yeah independence
S0144	i mean and that be and you've get that in tamil as well in the south erm in the south east who be kind of together with sri lanka that's a completely different culture
S0024	we never go there do we never get there
S0144	no no but you've get so many i mean the hill tribes basically well the people who live in the himalayas be completely different to the people who live on the lowlands
S0024	yeah well you've get
S0144	just the mentality be completely different
S0024	and because you've get so many tibetans live there as well all change the communities
S0144	yeah and you've get that yeah and then you've get the desert you've get rajasthan
S0024	mm
S0144	and then you've get yeah down by sri lanka and then you've ah
S0024	yeah but isn't that what they they love their diversity there
S0144	yeah and so they should but it's not a great recipe for economic dominance do you know what i mean
S0024	mm yeah i suppose yeah it's weird do you want to play the game again
S0144	er yeah in a minute i'll just have a little bite more of my beer
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah i speak to my brother last night
S0024	oh yeah what do he say
S0144	erm yeah he's just work he hasn't play ice hockey for two weeks cos he's do his ligament in in his knee
S0024	mm
S0144	hmm and i be tell him i'd rip a tendon in my foot so but he be go down the gym like he's obsess
S0024	what he what he's rip a ligament and then he's still go to the gym
S0144	yeah well he's he's do upper body stuff
S0024	well i suppose you can
S0144	because he's desperate to play cos i think he's realise that like i say
S0024	he's get on a bite
S0144	yeah yeah and i say you have to be really careful because if if that ligament go that's six months at least
S0024	yeah to heal
S0144	and that's probably the end of his career really and you know they don't have the the physios that footballers have
S0024	mm
S0144	and he have he still have to go work where he's lift heavy weight all day so he's not go to get better and he have to do it
S0024	yeah
S0144	he can't say ph my leg's hurt and i won't i'm not i can't lift that because they'll just rip the piss out of him do you know what i mean it's expect of him
S0024	i just realise the time so i'm go to text mum and dad
S0144	okay well you know that clock's backwards yeah
S0024	yeah so be he alright though when be we go to see him
S0144	erm yeah but he's do alright but then i be ask how 's back be as well because you know she's break her well break her back but it's like a hairline fracture or something
S0024	god she's sort they're in a state why be everybody in such a state
S0144	i don't know but he be say that she have to spend some days just lie in bed because she can't move but he reckon it's because she keep do this figure skate and keep try to do these arch when she's be
S0024	she keep try to
S0144	yeah she keep try to
S0024	why
S0144	when really she need to give up skate completely
