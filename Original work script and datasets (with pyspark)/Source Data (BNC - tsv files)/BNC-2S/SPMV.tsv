S0144	so how be you make toothpaste
S0024	i'm gonna make it up i read on the internet cos i borrow some bake soda and i know coconut oil always go in toothpaste but that's really salty so i'm mix some peppermint tea and fresh basil leave to try and make a nice taste
S0144	mm
S0024	cos you don't want any glycerine in it apparently glycerine and fluoride be like
S0144	yeah
S0024	stop all the stop you develop cavities or whatever stop you no no stop stop you get cavities get it right they're the i dunno the
S0144	fluoride stop you get cavities
S0024	no fluoride make fluoride's bad for you
S0144	yeah
S0024	and glycerine sit on your teeth for erm weeks and weeks and weeks and
S0144	mm
S0024	your teeth can't remineralise themselves so yeah yeah here we go i start this one but that's just wanna try it
S0144	what be that
S0024	it's really salty
S0144	er it's real salty
S0024	yeah i need some more but that's why i need to i'm wonder whether do you think cornstarch would bulk it out a bite
S0144	probably
S0024	i don't i don't really know it's an experiment
S0144	can you neutralise the salt with a bite of sugar
S0024	no cos sugar's bad for your teeth
S0144	oh yes
S0024	so i've try to use this these basil leave cos they're sweet basil the ones that be green
S0144	yeah
S0024	they're really really sweet so i might get a little bite of that juice look at it it's brown
S0144	doesn't matter what colour it be
S0024	no
S0144	long as it doesn't stain your teeth
S0144	brown teeth
S0024	rescue my teeth with turmeric i've take a before picture gonna make sure i don't use any toothpaste and
S0144	yeah and i be say to say to someone the other day that you know turmeric's really good for your teeth and it whiten them up
S0024	yeah
S0144	and erm i be say maybe that's why indians have get such good white teeth
S0024	yeah they do
S0144	and they say well isn't that cos they've get dark skin
S0024	no
S0024	they didn't really
S0144	yeah cos of the no i mean the
S0024	the contrast
S0144	the contrast
S0024	mm i don't know i always think they have good teeth
S0144	no i i'm sure they do have good teeth generally
S0024	but they use some they use load of different herbal products and you can't buy them i be wonder if you can buy them on the internet taobao or something
S0144	yeah
S0024	even in i couldn't find it
S0144	mm
S0024	you know that herbal toothpaste that i buy the menthol one that's still get glycerine in it
S0144	yeah
S0024	right do you reckon cornstarch be gonna ruin this toothpaste or not
S0144	guess that's just cheaper isn't it i don't know do it say have you be read about it
S0024	no i'm just make it up now
S0024	cos i don't have the ingredients
S0024	i don't have anything sweet so i be just look in the cupboard for something sweet and i find a basil and peppermint basil leave and peppermint tea now i'm just make it up
S0144	it's like george's marvellous medicine
S0024	i need some coconut oil we didn't even get it from that organic veg and coconut oil
S0144	yeah
S0024	that'd be good it's just in this one this i don't think it's gonna be thick enough this this this bake soda's too salty
S0144	hundred percent virgin coconut oil be that it
S0024	yeah yeah but look i've nearly run out
S0144	where do you get that from
S0024	i use it
S0144	do it not go here
S0024	use it all the time now erm i don't know i'm hop the internet i'm gonna have a look it's difficult to tell here with the chinese
S0144	well you don't know what's in it do you
S0024	no no it have to be this this one the virgin coconut oil and it go rock solid when it it's usually rock solid it's a bite it be rock solid all winter and it's liquid
S0144	oh
S0024	cos of the heat so our toothpaste will be harder
S0144	and how do you get it
S0024	i read it
S0144	how do you get it out in winter then if it's rock solid
S0024	well i couldn't so i didn't use it for age
S0144	mm
S0024	and er be use it so much look i've use nearly use it all up i be gonna buy some don't know i didn't get enough yellow green toothpaste be that alright
S0144	mm
S0024	look it's not it's too runny
S0144	erm okay what else can we put in it then
S0144	what would er bulk it out a bite
S0024	but that's why i think the cornstarch but maybe cornstarch need to be cook doesn't it maybe i should cook it
S0144	yeah yeah cook it
S0024	look it's only a tiny bite though
S0144	yeah mm
S0024	cornstarch you usually cook in sauce don't you
S0144	yeah
S0024	maybe it need to be heat to thicken i don't know but i should've do some more research before i get start i just have to have more bake soda it'll have to be salty but you're not suppose to have bake soda all the time every day cos it's a bite coarse
S0144	yeah
S0024	it's a bite of an abrasive for your teeth like be you gonna try this first or me
S0144	well i think you should
S0024	i just want it to taste good though mm with the peppermint oh
S0024	no
S0144	do it
S0024	it's too salty

S0024	mm
S0024	it's like a biscuit that bite oh my god super
S0144	super
S0024	super power microwave look at that it's get a
S0144	that's cos
S0024	it's cos the bake soda have make it kinda like a cake

S0144	no i think i'll leave that actually
S0024	well it's get all good stuff in it
S0144	okay after you
S0024	well i'll wait for the microwave to stop cook cos it cook for a minute afterwards doesn't it mm well it can definitely thicken up maybe i just need to heat it slightly
S0024	it's like a biscuit
S0144	yeah a few second probably would've do it
S0024	oh crack
S0024	crispy right i'm gonna try a bite of my toothpaste biscuit
S0144	right
S0024	taste really salty can't taste the coconut oil it's disgust

S0144	it's a learn curve
S0024	i'm gonna leave that there i can't even be bother to tidy it up
S0144	mm
S0024	oh oh it's really salty you can't have toothpaste like that no i'm gonna have to do some more research
S0024	maybe some orange peel or something
S0024	they've get they've put erm er er they've put erm er orange essence not er essential oil into
S0144	mm
S0024	or peppermint essential oil but i didn't i use peppermint tea it's not really strong enough be it for a nice minty taste
S0144	i think it'd be quite simple to make toothpaste or be that the glycerine that make it easy
S0024	the glycerine like you can't make the consistency but then i'm not really bother about the consistency it's like she just use olive oil
S0144	yeah
S0024	i'd just use i'm just happy to use erm just coconut oil or olive oil
S0144	yeah
S0024	or i and then once a week bake soda
S0144	yeah
S0024	and once a week turmeric i'd be happy to do that
S0144	yeah
S0024	i don't think we should buy that toothpaste any more look my teeth be wear away and i know i drink a lot of coffee see
S0144	no
S0024	they've get thinner at the end there they're just thin
S0144	oh they're a bite clearer yeah
S0024	yeah they're clearer and they're and it's start to show
S0144	mm
S0024	gap wise yeah so
S0144	that what that's because of the toothpaste you're use or just cos you're get older
S0024	both i suppose
S0144	what's that hum noise
S0024	i don't know
S0144	be it the air con machine
S0024	that's not on
S0144	be it the tv
