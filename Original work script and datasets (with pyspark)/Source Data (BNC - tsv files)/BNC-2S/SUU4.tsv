S0463	how's the home
S0456	well i er who teach german pop in yesterday and she be say oh yeah you probably won't hold that and it's it's closer to hers because she's opposite mine they have this wonderful idea to build a four storey house or block of flats in the car park of an exist block of flats which must be very nice for the people who live there because they have be there for years i think and where do they park
S0463	mm
S0456	erm but she say nobody know when it start might be in two years who know
S0463	but it's okay so far
S0456	the new dog
S0463	the move be the move be smooth everything be go
S0456	yeah yeah so far so far only one late wash machine so you notice the difference though because suddenly you can hear the traffic
S0463	yeah
S0456	yeah that's that's bearable so
S0463	so what be we to do
S0456	we be to talk guess guess you can guess what er what ask me the other day whether i'm corbynised and i be just er you know why
S0463	ah i see he should have ask me
S0456	yeah hasn't he
S0463	er i might not have see him since then but pretty obvious i be
S0456	yeah he introduce himself as now you see me and then you don't because i i tend to retire gracefully it's like everybody expect you to retire disgracefully but er
S0463	be he in today do you know
S0456	mm
S0463	be he in today
S0456	i've see him yesterday i haven't see him today
S0463	i'm do the course with him next week
S0456	there be things on this week i mean even before officially we start the course we be be teach erm i'm glad that i didn't have to start this week it's another it's another week to go before i have to face the music
S0463	well we have to mourn the footy for a week
S0456	yeah go on tell us about the footy
S0463	do you not watch it
S0456	no
S0463	it be dreadful i somehow didn't care so i be there i've write this season off
S0456	well you know it be the first loss
S0463	i know i be just it feel like he's a dead man walk
S0456	well the the i think be the best the back four have basically yeah table football about mobile
S0463	yes yeah
S0456	it's it's
S0463	i'm vote by the way i've become an affiliate member
S0456	have they not check you out yet
S0463	no cos i've never be a member of any other party
S0456	yeah
S0463	and i have vote labour
S0456	but i mean it's it's fine you can vote labour because they can't be
S0463	but i've never vote any anything other than labour
S0456	they can't really check your vote record i think they just go by
S0463	well apparently they have be do check electoral register
S0456	but obviously if you be if you be able to vote in britain and er but yeah it's usually on party ground isn't it make the hoo the hoo ha about it it's that's that's only a small proportion of how many people have the labour party now four hundred thousand
S0463	yeah six hundred
S0456	six hundred thousand i mean that's about sixty time as many as the tories cos they're all dead
S0463	or die
S0456	i mean it's a it's a it's a party of dead men walk i mean even my my surrogate mum have leave them for ukip because they be so dead in birkenhead
S0463	where be she in birkenhead
S0456	this be well she be the youngest she be now sixty six sixty seven the youngest
S0463	the thing that's most peculiar be that the core vote have always be essentially the age population obviously and those in the countryside and what do they offer people in the countryside the infrastructure bill be basically say we can wherever we want to
S0456	mm yeah well it's it's
S0463	it seem to me that they're alienate the
S0456	subsidies no end isn't it but you have to be a big landowner
S0463	no but it seem to be that they're alienate the core voters yet the be still vote for them
S0456	yeah well because they've never vote anything else you know just cos why would they would vote for an industrial party erm
S0463	but labour's no longer an industrial party that's time
S0456	yeah but that's their sort of i mean the the i think that's that's something they haven't get
S0463	yeah but you're right it's the country that isn't
S0456	they haven't get er policies for the countryside what they the only thing that they have which i can remember from the manifesto might be about erm access via bus which be relevant but it's not the core issue
S0463	labour labour create the green belt
S0456	well that's probably not er very helpful for farmers because you know the the the it just mean you can't sell your land for more
S0463	no but it's helpful for in term of preservation and conservation
S0456	oh yeah that be
S0463	which you know give the name of the conservative party have it's root in conservation
S0456	yeah well it's the conservative and unionist party and that's very
S0463	you be honest with you it's i i i i can only see the appeal of the tories to erm corporate people
S0456	oh yeah i mean it's it's blatant i suppose it's the spire in the castle or whatever it be it's it's the local know face and they just don't move
S0463	mm
S0456	erm
S0463	well this be why this be why you always it's always difficult to feel sympathy for farmers isn't it even though they're struggle like hell right now and by all right we should feel a certain sympathy for them but
S0456	yeah
S0456	that's i mean that's the other thing they er and it go for everything the complete non engagement by the tories you know if you want to have better deal for farmers for fishermen all your core constituencies you want to be engage in europe i mean just say oh that's europe and then put people i mean i don't even know who the foreign minister be i mean who care with this lot could be anyone it it could be where's wally
S0463	well we but we know who hilary like now
S0456	what the qatarian
S0463	drink my water
S0456	oh sorry sorry i just saw it wave at me i've get my own water that's my own
S0463	yeah you get you get some you get a change of register then at least for your tape
S0463	no we know who hilary like now anyway the charm david do you read that
S0456	no i didn't read that
S0463	david miliband
S0456	well you know he's isn't that what everybody say when erm when he go over the state that he er erm you know he be the equivalent to erm one of the big democrats who would be let in and would get zillions of dollars in because he's charm everyone
S0463	mm the prince over the water
S0456	mm er but the thing be i suppose there's there's no way back for him into britain it's it just doesn't work in britain i suppose it work in other countries but
S0463	in new labour circle wasn't he regard as a disappointment someone who'd be over promote by blair and someone who they find intellectually lightweight that be my impression at the time
S0456	yeah he be definitely push a lot by blair you know he be the the the in the in group the builder back of the labour party
S0463	i know but his his career path do stall at one stage the idea be that when he be he be become one of the policy chiefs erm that he be actually find out er in that he have nothing to say and it be all platitudes
S0456	yeah but yeah i mean that be the thing i mean i'm sure ed miliband have things to say and they just didn't
S0463	they get lose
S0456	come over and it be it be unfortunately if if you go by the bits and piece that come out it sound like erm kinnock you know there be all kinds of bright young things around who want to be modern be electable but they be they be even wonkier in in both sense of the word than miliband and yeah it it lack substance it just be too easily expose
S0463	it do i and i totally agree but i still think with erm if they have have a blair type of figure in term of charisma erm present that suite of policies i suspect they would have win
S0456	mm
S0463	erm the government so much of it be down to his personality even though i agree with what he say
S0456	well if you look at what be it it wasn't in the time be it what paper this be
S0463	well labour increase their vote in the england
S0456	yeah yeah unfortunately it increase it mostly where it already have er the secure seat
S0463	i know but
S0456	but no the this this this in depth survey that they do rather than ask load of people when they do the focus group erm former labour voters that vote tory order them in twenty fifteen probably twenty ten erm and there's a big residue of positive feel towards blair cos the the main issue clearly for the people on the leave be the iraq war
S0463	mm
S0456	which drown out everything else
S0463	poison the well
S0456	yeah well of course for for joe bloggs he's not really interest in politics but he's interest in mortgage repayments whether they've get a good job whether they've get money in their pocket or feel like they can spend money
S0463	mm
S0456	of course you know the blair years be the the the same thing as the clinton years things be look up all the time
S0463	i know i know i know i know and there be even a brief window very unusual in modern british history when we be at peace with the world
S0456	yeah yeah
S0463	before nine eleven and before iraq even cos afghanistan be not quite so big i don't think but mainly what i mean be what he inherit be between the trouble in ireland
S0456	yes
S0463	and the foreign policy adventurism be a window of security and stability
S0456	and the amount of effort that be put into northern ireland i mean it's like this lot nothing you know they're just like oh we want to cut and you can go hang
S0463	oh party before country that's that's everything with this lot
S0456	yeah yeah
S0463	yeah
S0456	but yeah he's he's he's i mean mandelson have return have mo mowlam there who who's the people person but himself and spend so much time and energy and
S0463	mm i know he's not give much credit for that because of major i'm not say whether that's right or wrong i don't know how far major have get but i think there's an issue when people look back
S0456	yeah
S0463	it's colour by the idea that major have do a lot of the work
S0456	yeah
S0463	which blair himself acknowledge actually
S0456	oh yeah yeah i mean the groundwork be there but as you can see now yeah
S0463	he be commit i agree with you
S0456	yeah you cannot you can't you cannot just let things slip and er yeah i don't know if he be like i remember that be in the first year and people like blunkett at the conference they just look tire really really tire because the the amount of work that they try to get through in a relatively short time and this lot be just do so much but nothing really happen that be positive erm and there's nothing be really think through whereas you know certainly the early blair years it be try to involve they have the whole thing with stakeholders erm
S0463	be you sure that wasn't just rhetoric
S0456	no because
S0463	because it disappear very quickly
S0456	well the it it just be probably see as as as a stupid word but it do work as in try to get all the party involve before things be actually enact legislation apart from the things that be come from gordon brown you know the massive surcharge on the utilities which be just a master stroke
S0463	i i think there be some real cynicism at that stage not that everything be bad by all mean you know i'm not as perhaps as anti new labour as you might think
S0463	erm i'm certainly you know compare to this shower
S0463	you know give me blair every time erm but i think i remember the kind of ideological thing that be go on in the kind of third way at the time and the language that be use around communitarianism and stakeholder community stakeholder societies and it be abandon very very quickly and my own experience professionally of the use of the word stakeholders be that it be a way to bypass democracy
S0456	mm
S0463	because these people be already citizens and voters and constituents and what you actually have be sift a few people who be a favour few at the top of these communities with no mandate er and take power away from the local authorities and call these new people stakeholders which be in essence quite anti democratic
S0456	mm mm
S0463	and i do have a real problem with this democratic centralism blairism
S0456	yeah
S0463	because it wasn't anything new they you know they be carry on on a path from thatcherism which be take power from local authorities and i think that be a big mistake
S0456	democratic centralism that bring me back parent but this be the father and i'm sure the card carry tories of a student that i have and he be tell me that he student politics and he say he be work extremely well with the president of the union be marxist but it be democratic centralism so it be
S0463	mm mm mm
S0456	and erm somebody else who use to be very very briefly a labour councillor in liverpool then of course militant everybody be out he wasn't militant but you know everybody be out the whole lot erm so yeah he have he definitely have this burn feel of injustice there but he say i never trust any of the north eastern lot because they be all democratic centralist marxist and of course mandelson blair the whole chunk
S0463	mandelson yeah yeah and er john reid
S0456	yeah doctor john reid
S0463	defend all his move
S0456	yeah yeah what be it it be sociology but i can't remember what it be on
S0463	yeah so
S0456	but he be he be definitely a bruiser and i don't know he he clearly
S0463	he still be isn't he chairman of celtic
S0463	have you not know him through your own
S0456	i don't know
S0463	he do have a position like that and he's just offend everyone still
S0456	what have you
S0463	he he's the type of guy who would cause an argument in an empty room
S0456	he be he be i mean i have never meet him in person but everything that i hear from people who who know him yes scottish politics it be a small country after all
S0463	mm
S0456	it's yeah it's you wouldn't want him as your father in law ah yeah
S0463	yeah interest time anyway
S0456	so you're your favourite borini be off to sunderland he seem to be so much happier now just in the promo picture
S0463	well i'm glad it's good for him it's good for the club it's cash
S0456	yeah one million for
S0463	get seven million for borini
S0456	no the we buy him for seven and sell him for eight
S0463	no no no we buy him for ten
S0456	ah
S0463	and sell him for eight it's alright
S0456	well at least if the loss be not massive so balotelli will be on half wag
S0463	i didn't i wasn't impress by all that leak of detail about balotelli to the echo
S0456	what be
S0463	you know about how bad he be in train and how he be distract other people and stuff like this because the reason i wasn't impress by it be one you keep these things in the house and two he's still our player
S0456	yeah
S0463	we should be look to keep his value up there's just no sense in leak stories
S0456	yeah
S0463	but the club seem to be i can't work out whether it's just the time we live in where everyone be leak in brief it's just the kind of way to be or it be the current regime at the club who foster this atmosphere but it's not good
S0456	yeah it be it be the oddest decision ever and it it just never work full stop erm
S0463	but leak in brief be no good anytime
S0456	no do you think do you think load of old new labour type start put liverpool for it's like of course this us
S0463	well they they they didn't invent spin no matter what people try and say
S0456	yeah
S0463	bernard ingham be a master he be thatcher's master of spin
S0456	mm oh yeah
S0463	it's always be there
S0456	and yeah just read i mean they he he's definitely look back at very very early twentieth century and obviously when there be no mass media spin didn't really matter because you know you would just have you're your house correspondence and it be all just via word i mean the the thing that it didn't matter how much jfk sleep around because it be just never an issue that the press would touch full stop
S0463	i know i know i've read er palimpsest
S0456	mm
S0463	and and i have no idea until i read that about
S0456	his connections
S0463	well no not just that about candy's ill health
S0456	yeah
S0463	he he have potentially two years to live anyway
S0456	yeah it's it's interest isn't it it it's for him it be the war that probably do it for fdr be it childhood something he have
S0463	he have polio
S0456	yeah polio
S0463	yeah
S0456	and obviously it do kill him i mean it be the war would have kill him probably with with the kind of responsibility and anxiety and stress but
S0463	mm
S0456	you know it's it be quite amaze if you see a lot of people erm who you know the old the seventies generation of labour mps who be drag out because thatcher refuse to pay up because she know that she can eventually win by just kill labour mps that way this be why you know in the seventies they have to drag them in
S0463	yes yes
S0456	for vote because she refuse pair at one point not long after she become a leader a pair system and of course if you have
S0463	i never quite understand and this what the pair system be
S0456	pair be if if an mp cannot come because of other commitments there would be an equivalent mp on the opposite side of the house who would also stay away
S0463	oh okay
S0456	so you would have you would still have the equivalent of rater vote
S0463	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0456	and it be very much a gentlemen's agreement and of course it come to a tough lady and
S0463	well she no she she be no gentlemen
S0456	no erm
S0463	yes because it be because one labour mp couldn't get there wasn't it it be on his deathbed basically
S0456	yeah
S0463	but i didn't but i didn't know she have end the
S0456	yeah no denis healey write and speak about that as well because you have you have to imagine they be people even if they're not your friends but people that you would see
S0463	yeah
S0456	and obviously in the seventies she have a lot of people who who would be there until the last days they will be in safe seat there will be no reselection or anything
S0463	oh my whole theory of thatcherism be that it could only have emerge when it do because it be at that time when those who have fight in the war be vanish from public life it couldn't have emerge before as a mass political movement because of those commitments to erm those who have fight in the war be so profound be so felt
S0456	mm
S0463	erm she you know erm his time come
S0456	hence the title of the david hare play on kinnock the absence of war and then the soliloquy the kinnock character talk about the he will he wish to be back in that time or the the common solidarity
S0463	i can't stand it any more i can't stand him any more
S0456	kinnock
S0463	he's a weasel absolutely he's so such a wannabe tory these days he's such an apologist i don't know if you hear him on he be on a number of radio four documentaries last year
S0456	no
S0463	er talk about the cabinet paper that release in the eighties from eighty three to eighty four
S0456	no i have miss all that you can tell me now
S0463	oh he be just an utter weasel
S0463	you know somehow you he support er what thatcher be do and know what she be what she be do know what lawson be do support what lawson be do to his own political end you know if they flop over the miners all the time
S0456	well yeah she be no he's in the box suppose to
S0463	yeah just and you know what he be say about militant in liverpool i dunno
S0456	yeah comrade kinnock
S0463	yeah no time i have no time for the man you know i know he could deliver a good speech and he be right about certain things but erm seem to me that we're live through a period now where erm everyone can see that actually thatcherism be wrong
S0456	mm
S0463	cos we can now see the result of thatcherism
S0456	yeah
S0463	because everyone make the link don't they between thatcherism two thousand and eight
S0456	well i think
S0463	it's a it's a historical block
S0456	i hope hopefully but really i don't know not everyone we can see it but
S0463	i think increasingly people can now i think as more and more scandals emerge erm as more and more kind of financial trauma's kind of
S0456	plus the whole thing with paedophilia
S0463	well that's what the scandal be yeah yeah
S0456	and the cover up yeah
S0463	and they be a a you know corrupt bunch
S0456	yeah and of course house be well
S0463	you might think
S0456	at the end of the crisis house price go up again and it will be that night be osborne's
S0463	yeah
S0456	er be it lawson
S0463	yes it be lawson
S0456	yeah
S0463	erm but again you know people be now say perhaps right to buy wasn't such a good idea
S0456	mm
S0463	you know and you couldn't have have this conversation this wasn't part of the discourse
S0456	mm
