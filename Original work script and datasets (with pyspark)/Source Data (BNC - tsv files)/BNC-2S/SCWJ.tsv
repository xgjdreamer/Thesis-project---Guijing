S0518	yeah and like and have a brief chat and say you know should we renovate it should we put a new kitchen and bathroom in and stuff my feel be because it's it's date you know it's get like this avocado bathroom suite
S0518	but erm my feel be that erm we should just empty it clean it and then it's an empty shell for someone to come in and yes they won't like the pattern carpet oh no actually that's go oh no it's plain in the hall stairs and land it's still pattern in the lounge although they won't like the pattern carpet although they won't like the avocado bathroom suite they will come in and say
S0517	they'll want to do their own yes yeah
S0518	just gut it they will somebody's die it's a house with no chain or whatever you know up a chain and it's empty and if it's just empty and clean then people will see the potential in it
S0517	yeah
S0518	and they will
S0517	yeah and they'll want to do what they want with it you know if you choose a a new bathroom or kitchen suite
S0518	i know they will
S0517	it might end up get rip out again cos it's not the choice of the buyers
S0518	well that's what i think and be say no no but say just put like a bland just plain white one in i say yes i know but the thing be then someone else else come in and i say
S0517	and want a wood one
S0518	yeah
S0517	yeah
S0518	or you know in the bathroom they don't like those tap fittings or they actually
S0517	yeah
S0518	want to make it into a wet room or something you know
S0517	it might be worth get the advice of the estate agent
S0518	yeah i say
S0517	because they they must they must come across us all the time and they must know whether
S0518	yeah
S0517	whether the expense you'd go to
S0518	mm
S0517	would be worthwhile er but frankly you've get you've get to be there manage it
S0518	i don't think he will and i say who's gonna do that
S0517	and you you're not local
S0518	no i say who's gonna do it i say i'm worry about just clear the place out let alone anything else
S0517	yeah
S0518	and erm
S0517	you've gotta be there for quote and people come round and the workmen be there
S0518	i know
S0517	it's just
S0518	i know well just get the hall stairs and land be bad enough but
S0518	you know i i my feel be
S0517	mm
S0518	that yes you can do things to sell a house you can put in erm neutral bathrooms and et cetera et cetera
S0517	mm
S0518	you can do that but when it's a property and somebody have die and this be it's get it it's a desirable property
S0517	where be it
S0518	it's in erm it's on the edge of north london
S0517	okay
S0518	so it's all of the house round there be be big they're very expensive erm a lot of them have be modernise and the one opposite be modernise and it and it go up for sale and it sell for five hundred and something thousand pound but i think it have five bedrooms and it have get a new bathroom and
S0517	mm mm
S0518	et cetera and new double i mean it's all double glaze it's for central heat and everything so it's not in bad repair but the decoration be old fashion
S0517	you might they find though that by the time they've finish empty it and go through it all they just want rid
S0518	yeah i know
S0517	but that that in itself be gonna be so time consume
S0518	i know i know
S0517	that by the time they a four bedroomed house with a garage and an attic and a shed oh
S0518	mm
S0517	that's not even your stuff
S0518	i know
S0517	you oh no that's gonna be so time consume for them
S0518	mm
S0517	they might just want rid by then so i shouldn't even worry about it until they've do that first step
S0518	on
S0517	cos that could take
S0518	i know
S0517	weeks
S0518	i think it be just them in their talk you know like
S0517	mm
S0518	you talk about stuff don't you and they be just
S0517	yeah
S0518	oh oh you know do you think we need to god we're gonna have to sell the house do you think we need to
S0517	yeah
S0518	decorate it do you think we need to refurbish it i my feel be just no
S0517	no do your do your own
S0518	yeah as as sell it site as see people buy it will know
S0517	mm
S0518	there be no upward chain the person that live here have die it be an elderly gentleman it be in good repair the kitchen's only a few years old and that be just a very neutral cream kitchen
S0517	it's all it's all it'll be all cosmetic anyway the you know the refurb won't it so
S0518	well it will and i just think because it be in a desirable area and it be a desirable property potentially anybody buy it probably want to totally modernise it i don't think they'll want to just put a new kitchen and bathroom in
S0517	no
S0518	i think they will want to erm
S0517	yes
S0518	yeah just
S0517	make it their own yeah
S0518	do everything
S0517	oh gosh so where how long be he go down for now do you be it be his be his dad's affairs in order will that be straightforward at least

S0518	mm yes definitely
S0517	oh good
S0518	definitely erm i've be run with not stalker i've be run with stalker twice a week
S0517	oh stalker
S0518	that's another story and erm he say to me er he say i can't tell you how overjoy i be he say to see such he say you're like a different person and i be i feel
S0517	feel better
S0518	yeah
S0517	good so be they be all the side effect still there as bad as they be or have that have it get better
S0518	no that's why that's why i feel better
S0517	oh that's good
S0518	because erm have say that last night i be struggle to get to sleep cos i felt like i couldn't breathe properly and er today i say to i feel really on edge really apprehensive really panicky but i think that be because of the situation and because he's go to for three days and i know why he's go and
S0517	mm
S0518	i don't know i know you're use to be without but i i'm
S0517	er well it's take a little while to adjust to it when he first start work away it do so i can understand that
S0518	you feel like the weight's on your shoulder don't you
S0517	yes yeah you've gotta keep everything
S0518	yeah
S0517	everybody in the right place at the right time and they yeah yeah
S0518	yeah and the children seem okay but what if they're not and
S0517	yes
S0518	you know what
S0517	yeah
S0518	anyway but that's er i wasn't actually think about that but i wonder be that part yeah
S0517	subconsciously be that yeah
S0518	yeah
S0517	bother you
S0518	but the panic attack the palpitations erm the nausea all of that be greatly reduce
S0517	and do you think that's just cos he change the dose
S0518	yeah
S0517	he didn't change the tablet do he
S0518	no but he's change it
S0517	oh well that's good news though
S0518	it be the strongest amount and he's halve the strength and it be every day and
S0517	yeah
S0518	he's put it every other day so it's effectively he's quarter the amount
S0517	right
S0518	the the downside be that most well quite a lot of nights i have wake up in really bad pain erm that's come come back erm and for the first week when i be on the reduce dose have absolutely massive swell up eye like really
S0517	oh really
S0518	yeah
S0517	do he say that might happen
S0518	no but erm they've go down and the tummy ache have become less so every night he be wake up at the same time between four or five o'clock really really bad pain like he be in labour that sort of strength of pain
S0517	oh gosh
S0518	not be able to get comfortable just have to take painkillers lie up the stairs lie on the you know that just for a couple of hours or whatever till morning really and erm and that be because where the where it be on the strong dosages of drug it be help that but even the other things so reduce it that come back
S0517	that come back but the side effect go
S0518	but yeah but ly i be so much better wasn't cry all the time you know
S0517	mm
S0518	's dad have die i've cry about that but it's be appropriately upset where i be just cry about everything
S0517	before yeah
S0518	you know i couldn't stand anybody hug me or touch me could i and erm i have to just go take a deep breath when want to hug me like this be my child it's okay but
S0517	yeah
S0518	when it be like come near me i be oh keep away keep away keep away you know and all of that couldn't stand it but erm so that's all
S0517	so that's
S0518	normal yeah but i erm i i oh i don't know you might not want to know the detail of this
S0518	er er basically i have a constant period for the whole of the time
S0517	how many weeks be that
S0518	weeks and i've have like a few
S0517	since since you have the the the operation or since the since the drug
S0518	no no since i've be on the well yeah no i didn't put two and two together cos i just think
S0517	oh okay okay
S0518	oh bloody hell on top of everything else like this oh must be my age
S0517	right
S0518	and i know i joke to you and say i've put on load of weight when i've be off and you say no you haven't you've be eat lot of lunch or whatever it be
S0518	and these tablets have put on weight but my tummy have be really really have be bloat and then obviously this and it hasn't cause me any distress other than oh for goodness sake
S0517	yeah for weeks and weeks you don't need that and have they say that's another side effect of the drug or they don't know cos they're new
S0518	erm well i yeah i hadn't think about it but then i go for this smear test and it be like well when do i book it in
S0518	don't
S0518	you know
S0517	oh yeah
S0518	and it so the nurse say well we'll just have to go you know
S0517	just do it
S0518	yeah and to see what happen so then she say to me i'm not really happy about this because she say i don't think it be your age she say i think it's erm she say do you say when you saw the consultant and you tell him about all the other side effect do you mention this i say no cos i think this be my age she say i don't think it be she say i think it it might be because of these drug and she say erm i'm if you'd've say it cos it's a new drug she say if you'd've say and it would've be note down and then someone else have say it and someone else that's how you build up what the side effect be
S0517	yes yeah
S0518	so she say i want you to do i want to have some blood test and discuss it with the doctor she oh poor you this be awful i say well it isn't actually to be honest it isn't awful it isn't that awful
S0517	well you're use to it but i mean you know you're use to get a bite of a break aren't you like weeks and weeks of it's a pain
S0518	yeah and i don't have any problems and i don't stop run and i don't stop swim
S0517	no
S0518	and just carry on
S0517	yeah yeah
S0518	and i don't have mood swing and anything like that
S0517	so
S0518	but obviously my i just feel like my tummy's constantly really stick out and and and that's just keep happen so erm i
S0517	so have she send the have she take the blood
S0518	no so she
S0517	oh
S0518	say book in so then she do the smear test that i have a letter back say that be normal and no untoward cells or anything so thank very much come back in three years' time then the very day i get the letter the surgery ring me and say oh mrs have you erm have your letter back regard the smear test result i say yes and they i say say it be normal and they say well yes the cells be the normal but we have find a few other things i be like oh no
S0517	oh no
S0518	so the doctor want to see you i be like oh god so she say show that you've get thrush i say i've never have thrush before in my life i say what will the symptoms be because i have no symptoms so she tell me what they'd be and i say oh i definitely haven't get those symptoms so she say well it it's show up and the doctor do want to treat it so
S0517	so be that another possible side effect of the drug oh my goodness
S0518	yeah yeah because i go to the dentist on thursday and they say oh like your gum be bleed and normally i have like really good teeth and gum and you're not take any medication be you at the moment i say well i be actually and then of course that have maybe cause thrush and then
S0517	oh gosh
S0518	he say what be the medication and i tell him and he say it's a nerve stimulant and it's for your gut and he say anything to do with the gut relate to the mouth
S0517	do it oh
S0518	apparently so he say mouth and gut be relate so he say i wouldn't be surprise if this be all relate so now have blood test on wednesday and then i've get an appointment to talk through the doctor with the doctor because they've say we don't know whether it's affect your thyroid so these drug whatever they be
S0517	oh gosh
S0518	be horrible they're horrible
S0517	it do how many people be on these drug
S0518	well i
S0517	i mean i know you say they be new how many people have they tell you any of that
S0518	no
S0517	cos that do sound
S0518	but
S0517	that's a lot of that's a lot of side effect
S0518	you know if you go to the doctor and you say oh i'm take penicillin or antibiotic or i'm take
S0517	do you say you're take this and they've not hear of it
S0518	they go oh
S0517	and they get their book out
S0518	they get the book out and look all through and then they'll so they they don't really know what it be and then they find it now it's list in the two thousand and fifteen book so it's list and this book come out every six months but then there's a great big erm sheet of paper paper that you can print off and erm they print off the computer and it's also inside my drug and basically when i go back to dr and he prescribe it he say i'm just gonna have to check on these on this drug he say cos i know it's get a side effect but i can't remember what we know of it so far erm and one in ten people which be quite high one in ten people experience these commonly palpitations nausea panic attack erm headaches
S0517	oh
S0518	vomit
S0517	god
S0518	haven't have vomit luckily erm so one in ten be quite high
S0517	i think that's high
S0518	and it
S0517	ten percent
S0518	and it's because normally it's erm if you look at normal they list all the side effect but it's like one in ten experience heart attack due to this or one in a hundred experience this or
S0517	oh
S0518	one in ten thousand experience this
S0517	experience this
S0518	but on this it's one in ten experience
S0517	ten experience
S0518	quite serious side effect
S0517	a lot
S0518	a lot of side effect
S0517	so how how long do they i don't suppose we know do we how long do they test it for before they say
S0518	well i think it's test it's test on erm but it say this have only be test and be only available for use for erm women of a certain age group which be my age group it cannot be use on young young people or younger women as it's not be test on them yet and it can't be use on men
S0517	well i wonder if that's because it would affect their fertility i mean if you've
S0518	don't know
S0517	yeah if it's obviously upset your cycle isn't it
S0518	yeah
S0517	er it might affect their fertility if it be younger women perhaps i don't know
S0518	it might do it might do i mean it do it do say don't take if you're pregnant or breastfeed but
S0517	cos you wouldn't you wouldn't entertain the idea though would you if you be pregnant or breastfeed but erm
S0518	no but and also would you be in my i don't know when it say my age group i don't know what the age group the age group might range from thirty five to fifty five so you might be come to breastfeed at thirty five i don't know
S0517	yeah yeah
S0518	but erm so it's very good because normally when when nerve be dead they're dead and this drug obviously have be prove to be able to help
S0517	to stimulate
S0518	which it be
S0517	yeah yeah
S0518	but alongside of that
S0517	you've get all this
S0518	mm
S0517	so so the the blood test you'll discuss with the doctor but what about the consultant that's prescribe them
S0518	okay
S0517	don't you need to go and back and see him
S0518	oh er january i've get an appointment with him but i've he's write a letter erm after our two hour i tell you all about that
S0517	yes yes you do
S0518	and he's write a letter which he's send me a copy of which be a very nice letter and it say in it you know have experience really bad side effect so what i've do be and he's explain and he say i want to persevere on these drug because there be some evidence that they be help however erm he say i don't want her to continue if the side effect continue to this degree and and we may just have to go back to square one erm in the background though there be a lot of other things and i don't know whether this be also add to it
S0517	mm
S0518	erm so he's list and he say to the gp which you may or may not be aware of and he list all these various other things erm you know stress relate things such as erm she have elderly parent who be not well who be reliant on her they can't spread the burden with her sister cos her sister's erm er a blind diabetic
S0517	also
S0518	erm effectively erm her father in law's recently be take seriously ill he live a distance away and erm
S0517	yeah
S0518	she's not very settle at home at the moment so erm there's also
S0517	there's a whole load you can't just take it on its own can you and say
S0518	mm
S0517	like the drug be do this and this because there's so much else
S0518	yeah
S0517	go on
S0518	yeah so
S0517	mm
S0518	you know i want to persevere on the drug because there be some improvement now he's change the dose i obviously feel mentally a lot better there be obviously some other stuff go on but the blood test that they're do be very specific which will say be it the early onset of menopause or it it it it these test will tell you whether it be or isn't
S0517	oh okay okay
S0518	erm apparently and also they're do anaemia because of just yeah
S0517	constant blood loss i assume
S0518	and erm and some very specific thyroid ones because she say i'm not sure whether it's actually affect your thyroid just because
S0517	i'm never really sure what your thyroid be do
S0518	well on jeremy vine i be listen
S0517	oh
S0518	they be talk about anaphylactic shock and things that cause people to have anaphylactic shock to things and then they be explain that the whole body go into overdrive
S0517	mm
S0518	not just like if you have an insect bite i'm allergic to it and then your adrenaline rush to that spot and create a reaction and that's why i get that massive huge blister and that's erm what be it antihistamine isn't it your natural antihistamine reaction
S0517	yeah yeah
S0518	well in anaphylactic shock your whole body react and then they be say it's it's like an exaggerate version of somebody that's get either an overactive or an inactive thyroid so so with somebody that's get a problem with their thyroid it's like their body attack themself and i be like oh
S0518	really okay well i hadn't really realise that but
S0517	no
S0518	that's what they be say it's just like er
S0517	oh
S0518	your own body react to against your own self
S0517	against it
S0518	yeah
S0517	well you don't want that do you
S0518	no so
S0517	gosh there's a whole list of what a
S0518	i have to say i wish i hadn't bother i wish i'd just stay as i be for
S0517	do you
S0518	yeah
S0517	do you though
S0517	oh gosh
S0518	well i couldn't because if you remember
S0517	no you couldn't you be in a lot of pain
S0518	well and the thing that start it off be that day at work
S0517	yes
S0518	when i be put with and you i tell you and say you need to go to
S0517	er yeah yeah
S0518	because imagine if that have be something far more serious
S0517	oh absolutely you do need to go to the doctor and at least
S0518	mm
S0517	well when be that though how long have we how long have we how long have we be go through this process now
S0518	since er january i would say

S0518	because i remember
S0517	mm
S0518	go to see mr for the first time in february so i have to see the consultant then obviously have to get er
S0517	yes yeah
S0518	an appointment
S0517	see it's a long i mean it be a long long time i suppose once they've and and that and i think that's probably why they won't send you back to work yet because they're they're still do all these test i mean and also they've you don't wanna go back to work and then be off off for a funeral off for blood test
