S0405	yeah it should sound fine
S0402	what be i say oh yeah so the older you get
S0405	yeah
S0402	the more useful it be to say that age and experience mean that you're like better place and more intelligent than someone because you're gonna be older and more well older than the majority of young people so
S0405	do you think like youth be naturally incline to be obnoxious
S0402	yeah to be i mean we don't know any better but sometimes we know better than the people that be older than us but because we're younger people generally dismiss us as quite unexperienced and foolish when we we do genuinely know it's like
S0405	so you
S0405	yeah
S0402	it's like teachers in school right who be best place to judge how well a teacher teach
S0405	students
S0402	the students
S0405	yeah
S0402	but there can never be a situation where students can judge teachers because the everyone
S0405	they're not yeah
S0402	er think that we're too inexperienced we're too stupid we're too immature to make the decision when in in actual fact most of us aren't
S0405	so do you think that so you do or don't think that intelligence bring that that that experience bring intelligence
S0402	it do but they say that like for everyone that's older than you be definitely more intelligent than you be wrong
S0405	right
S0402	because there be some people that be older than us who be stupider than us
S0405	yeah yeah
S0402	but because they're older we have to show them like more respect for their intelligence and experience when it's less than ours and and just to just to say because we're younger than them that you know it mean that
S0405	do that annoy you
S0402	yeah
S0405	sound like
S0402	yeah
S0405	it sound like it annoy you
S0402	sometimes you do know know better than people that be older than you but you have no no power or influence because you're younger than them
S0405	do you think we should have a right to tell them
S0402	we do and we exercise that but people will still dismiss it because we're younger than them it's not like we don't tell them like we try to get rid of
S0405	well
S0402	dr like try to get rid of dr like years ago
S0405	oh yeah oh my god
S0402	well everyone just dismiss it as oh it's a kid that's just angry that just doesn't like the teacher rather than the teacher be genuinely poor
S0405	no but that's because it be as well
S0402	it be sign by like forty people
S0405	yeah i know
S0402	it's just
S0405	so to go back to the to kill a mockingbird story of er the lady that hat hat colour people
S0402	yeah
S0405	and er atticus tell him not to say anything cos she be old and she didn't know better
S0402	yeah
S0405	do you think do you think that be the right thing or do you think they should have tell her that she be wrong
S0402	well one if if jem just tell her that you're wrong she isn't gonna she isn't gonna listen because she's older than jem and therefore she must know better or something right but
S0405	so cos it's pointless be that right
S0402	it's pointless but that's not how why atticus be say er atticus be say you know you should be better and respect respect older people when in fact the surely the er the the most respect you can give a person be to try and teach them and make them better so i think jem should have give his opinion it might not have change anything but he should have give his opinion
S0405	yeah but do you think that the truth be always the best thing
S0402	the truth be the ultimate pure er a completely undoctored truth be like it's like you know perfect but people don't wanna hear the truth people can't accept the truth people look at the truth in different ways so
S0402	it's much easier to put a slant on the truth and then to give it you know full flush that this be the truth
S0405	so what if a lady in her die days on her deathbed you have unconclusive proof inconclusive i dunno proof that god didn't exist or that something that she believe in didn't exist or that there be an explanation for it would you tell her so that she could live know the truth or would you but that say and say that wouldn't make her happier that would make her sadder
S0402	yeah i get where you're come from but
S0405	i think that's one of the few place religion play be a really positive role
S0402	yeah i mean
S0405	not not few place er
S0402	yeah people deserve the truth but people don't want the truth people people know the truth it's like if you ask someone would you much rather i tell you the truth about something or lie to you about it they'll say the truth all the time right
S0405	yeah yeah
S0402	but they don't wanna hear the truth because
S0405	i know no
S0402	the truth isn't what the truth they wanna hear the truth they wanna believe they'd much rather listen to something else and i would say and that one that that woman if you ask her do you want the truth about stuff yeah it's in your die days you you want the truth right she'd say yeah er i definitely want the truth the truth be erm yes go on then but the second you tell her that you shatter the truth that she's the the truth she's live with in her in her world and you shatter that and you take away what she's build up before erm
S0405	yeah
S0402	yeah that that would be a completely hard one because
S0402	er
S0405	what's the er karl marx quote you know religion be the opiate of the people or the opium something like that cos the people
S0402	yeah
S0405	people get quite addict to their religion and they don't want they don't wanna refuse it
S0402	yeah
S0405	you know they're addict to it but then michael caine say in the the dark knight rise
S0405	sometimes we should let the truth what do he say i dunno after you know he tell that man that erm that the letter
S0402	yeah
S0405	that that that that girl write him he burn it or whatever and it's like sometimes you've just get we should start try to outsmart the truth i dunno something like that it's bad to take advice like that from film
S0402	well no cos the the end of the dark knight the er it be the like the most the the the best er that's not i think that's the thing that people should draw through about what the truth be and and how it should be the er where where he say that you know he kill harvey and all those cop and that it be his fault and that he he should be hunt down because he say something like people deserve sometimes people deserve more than the truth erm people deserve better er better than they can be give and er so he'll he'll he'll take the hit for it because he want to give people hope and and make them feel better erm if you ask people would you want the truth er er of of gotham they would have say yes but it would have shatter their world now it it's a different question if you you ask them if you want a truth er it's a it's a er a real truth but it's gonna shatter your world it's gonna destroy the foundations that it's build on then they then then it give them a problem of whether they accept something they say be pure and brilliant and that that they'd win just like five second ago or or do they do they wanna save what they've build for themselves already and er
S0405	i think everyone have their own like role in gotham city though cos then there be there be a system of you know there's workers there's there's er italian er boss mafia
S0402	yeah
S0405	boss there's there's the rich and the aristocrats like bruce wayne's family
S0402	yeah
S0405	and everyone live but it's only when it start get unfair and worse for people obviously the people at the bottom like you know they always talk about gotham's underbelly it's when it get worse for them that's when batman choose to do something other time you know he doesn't or er at least that's probably what thomas wayne felt you know that's how they get that's how the city run
S0402	well didn't he
S0405	or in or or like in gotham er you know erm jim gordon's mean to be you know the symbol of absolute er
S0402	yeah
S0405	good good morality but yet in the end he choose to allow falcone to live on because the city need him
S0402	yeah
S0405	so that's be pragmatic that's be smart about it that's erm er
S0402	but the world the world need two type of heroes one
S0402	it do it well one
S0405	the ones it deserve and the ones
S0402	no no the the ones that that will give the world the people of the world hope right the figure right
S0405	yeah
S0402	so your mandelas your er your martin luther kings your your er
S0405	gandhis
S0402	your gandhis yeah people you you need that right people that be absolute right they might not have the greatest change sometimes their action may be negative but at the end of the day they're the they're the the be all and end all the absolute figure of of good right
S0405	yeah
S0402	and then other time you need people that be gonna do the dirty work that the people that at the end of the day aren't gonna be look on as heroes because their action aren't inherently heroic when you look at it erm cos you need those kind of people because at the end of the day those be the ones that be gonna get stuff do
S0402	i mean it's all good well and good give speeches and stuff but unless you you you have a you act upon it it's meaningless right
S0405	and which of those do you think be batman
S0402	well batman be not the absolute hero
S0405	no but i think he i think he make a transition from er dark knight he choose to do
S0402	yeah
S0405	the dark that people didn't want him to do
S0402	mm
S0405	you know he be the dark knight whereas er two well harvey dent be the white knight
S0402	yeah
S0405	and then in dark knight rise he end up become a symbol because
S0402	yeah
S0405	he hasn't be there for so long a symbol of what's right
S0402	yeah
S0405	erm but people know that you know but he become the point be he become the symbol of evil to people cos people have think that he kill harvey dent
S0402	yeah
S0405	but people like orphan and er and er and some of the good cop they know that batman be really
S0402	yeah
S0405	the good person and you know he stand for a symbol as much
S0402	yeah
S0405	and er yeah and then you go back to batman begin and i think the reason why er er bruce wayne be first say he be gonna take on the batman be cos he have become a symbol
S0402	yeah
S0405	for more than more than just go out and fight crime
S0402	yeah
S0405	and obviously alfred prefer that cos he'd get less hurt and stuff erm
S0402	yeah i know but but erm do the way batman the want to become a symbol be that er not a symbol of hope he never never try to be a symbol of hope more erm a symbol of of fear to to inspire fear within the criminals so that they wouldn't
S0405	right
S0402	they would never again erm
S0405	yeah i suppose
S0402	do do do wrong but yeah obviously in the end he become a a symbol of of hope but originally er yeah that's why you know
S0405	maybe at the end of the third movie when he's finally sacrifice himself
S0402	yeah
S0405	and they do that statue of him
S0402	mm
S0405	maybe that's the the final only time when he
S0402	yeah
S0405	become hope
S0402	yeah
S0405	i think superman's mean to be the symbol of hope
S0402	yeah superman
S0405	but he's so much more bore and placid and dull
S0402	it be yeah that's it he's he
S0405	cos that be it
S0402	he be the ultimate be all of end of all of good you know he he do
S0405	at least batman admit he have fault
S0402	yeah
S0405	superman mess up all the time too doesn't he
S0402	yeah and and yeah
S0405	yeah so why do more people root for batman cos he's a more awesome hero or because they actually stand for what he he stand for more
S0402	er i dunno i mean
S0405	it's just cos he's more popular
S0402	yeah he's get so much more depth
S0405	yeah
S0405	his villains be better his city be better his alias be better
S0402	he get better writers
S0405	yep
S0402	better movies
S0405	yeah
S0402	i mean the way he's be i mean like any character which have multiple writers he's be portray differently like every time
S0405	yeah
S0402	which be which be nice but like the dark knight return be a really good one
S0405	oh yeah
S0402	if you if you read or watch that
S0405	i actually need or watch it properly
S0402	watch it watch it it's really good
S0405	oh right yeah
S0402	because he go from be like a symbol of like nothing because he he's be go for ten years to become not like a well it's you know a symbol for hope rather than a symbol for fear
S0405	yeah
S0402	and er
S0405	cos he's old
S0402	yeah
S0405	do you think it's gonna it's not gonna spoil any of the superman versus but i know that they say that the superman versus batman film be its own independent story that the writers create and it shouldn't be look at like with comic book history at all or something they're basically try to cover themselves
S0402	well basically sell the exact same fight scene that they're they're gonna lift from
S0405	right
S0402	from er dynamic and
S0405	i think they should like separate themselves from
S0405	they're just try to move er the idea of cos they i dunno they're try to pretend that they're better than marvel movies
S0402	yeah
S0405	cos marvel movies have become i really like them but they've become really mainstream
S0402	yeah cash out but
S0405	yeah and like like comical and erm like one of main dc people be just like yeah we're gonna make a film that stand for yeah it be on the suicide squad panel
S0402	yeah
S0405	you know like we're gonna make a film that stand for the value that dc film stand for erm faithfulness to their comics erm like good plotlines and good character or something like that
S0402	oh i never read
S0405	i can't
S0402	read marvel comics but i can't see why they wouldn't achieve that
S0405	i know most of the time i hear that oh i know i know i know most people feel that dc comics be better write though
S0402	oh er yeah
S0405	right or it's just the character be better
S0402	the the character be better and they're better write
S0405	then why can't they make a successful dccu
S0402	because erm because they they look at what they think work and they they look at what
S0405	in their field
S0402	at how what the yeah they look at the dark knight and see how like dark it be compare to the
S0402	the marvel universe
S0405	that's really bad
S0402	er er and they've look at at what they wanna be as in comparison to marvel and try to differentiate themselves erm
S0405	too much though
S0402	er and and then they completely overshoot
S0405	yeah i think i think they've get the wrong end of the picture the success of the dark knight film
S0402	well yeah which be which be why the suicide squad trailer look so so dark and bore and and no comedy
S0405	they just need to come out with a really funny movie
S0402	yeah be good
S0405	maybe they try it with green lantern but they just didn't put enough time into it
S0402	yeah
S0405	you know so they try the flamboyant you know proper
S0402	yeah
S0405	marvel like movies like green lantern and fail they they try it with serious dark knight and it be the biggest like
S0402	yeah
S0405	box office they'd ever have so i can see why they're do it didn't really work with man of steel though do it i mean
S0402	yeah that
S0405	do you see that that video of like the the different colour tone they have
S0402	yeah
S0405	like that be probably exaggerate but it's make so much sense
S0402	yeah yeah yeah like it be what they're try to go for
S0405	yeah
S0402	and i
S0405	just don't want them to f it up
S0402	yeah it look that way
S0405	so so what's arrow like do you think be that like serious
S0402	well it it it it's oh what they be clever enough to to make it serious but have load of comical elements of it
S0405	yeah okay
S0402	so it's not you know like dark knight but you can't achieve that level of darkness just with
S0405	just by create it
S0402	one hour slot you need to the whole thing about a movie be that you build it use sound cinematography throughout a consistent sustain like two three hours
S0405	yeah yeah
S0402	er and and you use that to make people you know feel a certain way and and respond a certain way and you can't really do that as well with a series because it's it's break up you can you can try
S0405	you have more time though to develop the character like
S0402	you can develop a character which be be great but you can't
S0405	but not yeah yeah
S0402	it's really hard to sustain erm an emotion a run emotion of someone or or make them feel a certain way or use
S0405	mm
S0402	use like erm filter or cinematography or or the the way light shin or whatever to to make it look like you know use that to tell a story because
S0405	yeah i get you
S0402	it's not sustain
S0405	yeah i get you apparently the action scenes be amaze though
S0402	yeah they're really they're really well do
S0405	yeah
S0402	but it's get to the point where it's a bite of a joke though
S0405	really
S0402	yeah cos it's just like it use to be like really like oh wow that's amaze but then you do it all the time and so
S0405	what and you get use to it
S0402	yeah and and then then you start you see it so so many time that you start pick the fault in it
S0405	oh yeah
S0402	there's this one scene where where he shoot an arrow up into the sky right there's nothing there there's no build or whatever he just grapple away
S0405	what
S0402	he just shoot
S0405	yeah yeah
S0402	he just grapple something
S0405	so it's pretty cheap cheap
S0402	no you you
S0405	cheap trick
S0402	you can you can see as well like my
S0405	yeah
S0402	and it it show from series one till three like
S0405	that's why i dunno but i really want gotham to work
S0402	i don't think
S0405	i think if season two they're gonna really find themselves
S0402	i've watch just a lot of cop cop erm series
S0405	oh right oh right oh right
S0402	yeah it just it just
S0402	it fit straight into there it's like nothing different it really isn't
S0405	yeah but it's in gotham
S0402	yeah i know but you can you can just move it somewhere else but it's the same thing it's like it's
S0405	nah
S0402	you basically every every episode be just oh there's a crime a a completely unrelated crime to the main plot let's go and solve that
S0405	i i think they really do it pretty well i mean some episodes you completely disjoint but
S0402	yeah i know but
S0405	others they be like
S0402	it be too much
S0405	it be lead to the penguin thing
S0402	it be too much just like a cop show like erm
S0405	i i be pretty invest in penguin and
S0402	yeah i i i i know but but the like the bulk of the show the bulk like seventy percent be just a cop show
S0405	yeah
S0402	it be like oh crime here let's go oh that guy's a stereotypical guy that's probably do it
S0405	yeah
S0402	so we'll go and put him we'll question him oh wait it this evidence say it could be
S0405	i know but
S0402	him
S0405	they only have like forty minutes as well like
S0402	oh no there's this creepy guy
S0405	an hour
S0402	who be walk around let's go find this creepy guy he be the murderer now let's chase him through a load of oh he's shoot at him oh no he he he punch bullock in the face oh and then in the end gordon say gordon say but hang on and they arrest him and they get the man
S0405	so what do you think they should what do you think they should try and find themselves as as a show
S0402	move away from the
S0405	i think they're gonna get more into the villains which er more in depth villains than you know the balloonman or a goat or a a professor pyg or whatever
S0402	yeah i
S0405	cos they didn't they didn't really
S0402	i just don't i don't
S0405	the whole dollmaker thing didn't work that wasn't long enough
S0402	yeah i just don't really form that thing well
S0405	yeah
S0402	because people have see it too many time but i really think they
S0405	i'd see it again though
S0402	you you you never watch us office but the first season they they try to copy exactly what the first season of the original office be
S0405	yeah
S0402	and it be awful
S0405	oh
S0402	it it be completely terrible because
S0405	be that just cos it be american though
S0402	yeah because it be an and it be a it be a load of americans try to copy what the british have do so well right
S0405	yeah
S0402	it be try and test comedy but they try to do it the exact same and emulate it and it be awful
S0405	wasn't that just because like americans and british people have different humour though
S0402	not but but the well my point be that they would they they try to copy something that be try and test
S0405	right yeah
S0402	right erm and it end up just be so bore
S0405	yeah
S0402	because of that er and in the second season they do so they they they create a series that be completely different from from the er
S0405	god
S0402	the british er british season er series and it be it be almost apart from character and the the of some episodes some classic episodes it be unrecognisable in comparison
S0405	well it remind me of er when they try to do the er oh shall i tap out
S0402	yeah you've gotta tap
S0405	oh right and so it remind me of the inbetweeners when they try to do the inbetweeners in america
S0402	that's it now or
S0405	either
S0402	yeah yeah
S0405	yeah when they try to do er the inbetweeners
S0402	yeah
S0405	in america it be awful
S0402	yeah
S0405	awful
S0402	that always happen cos there's this stupid cos the americans be all big and flamboyant and that really work for them and it be it be quite funny right
S0405	yeah
S0402	but the second they try and use the british humour and do it it be awful
S0405	yeah
S0402	like steve carell be hilarious but the second they try and make him do british humour he be just terrible
S0405	yeah how be you
S0402	but then the second they let him do his own thing he everyone love
S0405	that's why ben affleck have to be an amaze batman because we're gonna be invest in
S0402	yeah
S0405	for at least another two movies oh oh
S0402	yeah i really hope they they don't go oh erm heath ledger the joker best emulate him christian bale will
S0405	i don't think he's do that like suicide squad i don't think he's do that
S0402	but also
S0405	i think he's try to just stay as far away from heath ledger as he can
S0402	but also don't go the other way and make it so far away from him because you're scar of of of go anywhere into his territory that
S0405	i know yeah
S0402	it's just it it it's no longer the character that you be you be look for that's why they should just make it funny right cos cos like i get that it's really hard to be funny
S0405	oh yeah
S0402	like really hard but
S0405	it's it's hard for me
S0402	so maybe that's why
S0405	i still do it i manage
S0402	but maybe that's why they try and stay away from it but it's not that hard they i'd rather they give that a shoot of that than try and be like dark funny
S0405	yeah
S0402	cos heath ledger be like a one time thing and
S0405	be you get the er forty one yeah
S0402	the one
S0405	er the forty one get off at er
S0402	it'll be it'll be it'll be the same time for me that oh be you get off at
S0405	no cos then cos erm
S0402	the train will be come through
S0405	there's other train that run just from
S0402	oh right erm the ones that will be stop at that'll be stop at here as well though so
S0405	oh
S0402	so but be that go to
S0405	yeah
S0402	oh right okay er oh yeah you get on that one i'll get on the
S0405	alright
S0402	the eight fifty i'll end it now yeah
S0405	alright
S0402	bye bye
