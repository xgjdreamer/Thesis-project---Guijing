S0261	so it's get good sound i'm go to turn it up okay so let's just see how this go so erm i i think that he have a very round message that er have some interest things in it that one could explore
S0262	mm
S0261	and you know when you see some of his picture and think erm you know with interest in in and that kind of thing
S0262	mm
S0261	and outfit that she work with him for but erm i would have think in some kind of fashion erm they have an interest in all that kind of stuff that kind of exposure and presumably they come across these people
S0262	mm
S0261	erm i'll be surprise if it's all do in isolation
S0262	i mean it's a network isn't it
S0261	mm
S0262	so i think they actually call it network in the title
S0261	they call it traffic one's call traffic and the other one's erm erm trace network
S0262	mm
S0261	mm
S0262	this be exactly why i say do you want to sit here
S0261	oh do you see that come
S0262	yeah so anyway it's all gonna be on your
S0261	mm
S0262	on your
S0261	i'm interest to see how it pan out
S0262	mm
S0261	so i mean the idea of follow along with someone who do that type of thing and a kind of a erm well a photo journalist way or something like that
S0262	i wonder if he work in geography or their their people do
S0261	yeah
S0262	cos they must have they must have photos cos that would be one way of document their work
S0261	mm i check i check out erm trafford the other day erm and it's it's a network that it's it's be around for a while and it's global erm and so that kind of area be run out of
S0262	mm
S0261	erm and then there's the traceman group and and that be run out of edinburgh erm and and that be more of a kind of a scientific basis thing dna track and stuff like that i i presume of of species and wildlife traffic and stuff like that
S0262	yeah
S0261	so erm how how it work i can't imagine that they've get any particular power to do anything they probably have they probably document evidence in some context which then they put forward erm so that one just seem quite er it's like one particular guy and he seem to be the man who the traceman group it so people must work for him but he's not expose to something else there's a a group of a lot of people
S0262	i'll just see where this coffee go
S0261	mm what happen
S0262	oh he's gonna bring it
S0261	right so what do you think what do you think about
S0262	well erm yeah i mean you know he's erm he's an interest talker i mean he thank you
S0261	thank you mm mm
S0261	i think
S0262	no i think because i want to get his message out there erm i wonder how he actually the whole you know national geographic get its own editorial staff it do what it do
S0261	well he he kind of make that clear
S0262	yeah
S0261	that it's conservative that
S0262	and maybe his way of you know fight to find an audience find out who be his stuff i mean there be quite a lot of people there today
S0261	mm
S0262	so
S0261	yeah
S0262	mm but other than that it's appear like well do he go to school do he go to i mean how do he what what else do he do to support his kind of message you know like how do he communicate to a big big audience a worldwide audience that's not a national geographic you know cos otherwise
S0261	yeah well i mean the work that he do be i mean sure he do assignments for national geographic but he he's effectively his own man he's effectively freelance i would have think
S0262	yeah
S0261	he's not own by the magazine he's not work for the magazine
S0262	no so he's he's basically he's you know he's a freelancer
S0261	mm
S0262	but i mean yeah he'll be take commission now i would have have think that be up his street
S0261	yes
S0262	so he choose kind of what he think be the right kind of assignment for him
S0261	yeah mm
S0262	but essentially they're not not fully his assignments as in be he drive that idea how be he how be he like put it together where do that go to
S0261	well he's simply tell i need a photo of this so he'll carry out whatever research he need to to understand how he's go to do that with support of a logistics team and contact with scientists erm to get out there erm get the shoot get what's important for the magazine somebody else be write a story about it they could be work with him they could be independent they could be operate out of a library they could be at a university talk to scientists i don't know erm but it would kind of make sense that somehow the people he's work with and people who be write the story
S0262	well i suppose he write his book doesn't him that's how he communicate with the with with the
S0261	yeah and clearly you can see that erm by do these kind of forums and things like that he's probably think longer term that he can't be out do hefty assignments all of the time and his message kind of sound like he doesn't like be away from his family but he's do it
S0262	mm
S0261	so he have to balance that whether they're here now with him or not i don't know but
S0262	well i don't think he be cos he say we're go to come back because of them so
S0261	mm
S0262	yeah
S0261	i suppose the assignments themselves can be for months on end you know they could be a long journey mm
S0262	i mean he have he he didn't really talk about it in in concrete term but you get the impression that he could be away you're right it's not just about be away for a month he could be away for months but you know his wife get to go with him on some occasion but then who's look after the kid and that kind of thing but then he he say kid do go with him sometimes so
S0261	mm
S0262	wherever he can he's make a but also there's risk attach to that because just as he get dengue fever and blah blah blah and so could the kid so
S0261	yeah exactly he take on some considerable risk
S0262	he do erm and i think that's probably what i admire most about him be that he's a dedicate risk taker
S0262	he's commit to take risk i like that
S0261	to get what what matter yeah mm
S0262	someone's gotta to do it it's him and people like him
S0261	mm yeah
S0262	you if you want to
S0261	oh you won't find me climb up a a a sixty foot tree with no rope
S0262	i don't think you'd find me tree
S0261	and you won't find me sit on top of a hot air balloon
S0261	when it's really hot
S0262	no but if you want to take photograph of of wildlife then you could do it that's
S0261	yeah
S0262	so what do you fancy do after i've show you the the giro thing
S0261	erm
S0262	do you wanna walk back or get a train if we get a train we could go well doesn't matter what i be gonna say be we could go past aldi but we don't need to go to aldi cos we go shop on saturday
S0261	we don't have any onions
S0262	well if we walk back we could pick up some onions
S0261	if we take the train we can go to aldi and get some onions if you wanna walk i'm happy walk no big dig
S0262	yeah we can do that
S0261	mm okay so you'll show me whatever this particular special thing be

S0262	yes right
S0261	okay i come to look at this a while back with
S0262	yeah
S0261	this stuff in here yeah it's 's what what be it
S0262	it's a piece of string it's a piece of string that's all it be
S0261	that and that's just go in a wave
S0262	yeah
S0261	it's not actually spin round oh it be spin round as well it's sort of go in a helical wave and then there
S0262	it's just a white light
S0261	so then it be too so oh that's interest so then be what create an impression of the different colour
S0262	mm
S0261	or something like that
S0262	but look inside you can also see like the projection of the string you can see you know
S0261	yeah yeah it's like a shadow
S0262	yeah
S0261	and it travel yeah
S0262	sound you can see more than one you see like the string in the middle and then you see like the and you see the string right in the middle then there's the shadow behind it
S0261	mm
S0262	so you can see kind of like two or three line well two line
S0262	pretty nifty isn't it
S0261	well that's quite cool
S0262	well that's just a normal fan
S0261	yeah that's just a modify fan
S0262	a fan that be
S0261	attach a piece of string on it and project some light in it light in a box
S0262	yeah
S0261	wow
