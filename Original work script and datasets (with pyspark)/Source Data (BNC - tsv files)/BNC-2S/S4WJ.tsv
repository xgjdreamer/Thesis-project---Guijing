S0441	good shoot though water well do actually i won't open it now i'll have some coke instead
S0439	yeah she's just
S0441	be weird
S0439	be yeah but oh well oh so what do you get up today how be work from home
S0441	it be actually quite it only get stressful towards the end because i have to ring someone and sort something out then it sort of become stressful when you're not there to just go and talk to people
S0439	yeah yeah
S0441	like to be fair that's what my job gonna be to the new routine so
S0439	really
S0441	get use to it i suppose yeah so we'll see
S0439	how many days be you gonna be work from home
S0441	dunno we haven't really get really a base so
S0439	oh okay
S0441	we have get a base but they're cut down on as er instead of cut down on staff they're cut down on pay for
S0439	rent
S0439	build yeah
S0441	so there's gonna be like a team of sixty with space for twenty so there's not gonna be any room for anyone so we'll be work remotely quite a lot
S0439	i guess as long as you do the job it doesn't matter where you work though do it like
S0441	it just make it a lot more difficult when you haven't get people around you all the time
S0439	mm
S0441	people that perhaps i don't know think that they can do it on their own and that that's where it could get a bite dangerous really
S0439	i think monitor people be gonna be dangerous
S0441	mm
S0439	it's gonna be hard because at work yeah i do fuck about sometimes and do like online shop or check the daily mail and stuff
S0441	mm
S0439	but i still do my work
S0441	yeah
S0439	if i be at home i would think i could be so easily be like oh it's lunch break let's watch an episode on netflix
S0441	mm
S0439	oh let's have another episode on netflix
S0441	have to be discipline i suppose
S0439	yeah you have to be really it have to be a lot of self discipline doesn't there
S0441	mm i suppose the difference be be that if i don't get something do then someone could be like harm i suppose as
S0439	yeah
S0441	as a result
S0439	yeah
S0441	i mean i probably wouldn't work probably wouldn't go home if i have visit on the day probably wouldn't go home if i have visit on the day
S0439	yeah
S0441	because oh the fuck table's
S0439	oh god
S0441	so wobbly
S0439	i know god
S0441	erm because there'd be no point really
S0439	mm
S0441	i'd imagine it would be so you'd probably fit all your for the first couple of days and then catch up with yourself in the weeks
S0439	yeah
S0441	in the days after probably
S0439	yeah
S0441	at home quite enjoy it though today
S0439	how much be you gonna be do you say like two days a week or three days a week or something like that next year to do
S0441	don't know
S0439	or
S0441	how it'll work
S0439	mm
S0441	we'll see
S0439	i'd love to work from home a few days but
S0441	quite enjoy it i mean i can i i i could work from home as as i want really but it wouldn't really be beneficial for me i don't think
S0439	no and also go to work you get the social side of it as well like
S0441	yeah exactly
S0439	i like the people i work with
S0441	mm
S0439	it's a really nice team i like go in and see them and
S0441	yeah
S0439	build that relationship with people like and then i'm more likely to get something people be more likely to do something for you or you're more likely to do something for somebody else if you're there on the spot they come up to your desk they tell you to do it
S0441	or they know you already
S0439	or they know you and they're like can you do this for me you're like
S0441	mm
S0439	yeah okay and you build that relationship with people like i if i'm like if you have a like solely email relationships with people it's quite difficult
S0441	people don't really have that bond do they
S0439	no and like well even even if you just speak to someone on the phone you get across a bite of your personality and
S0441	mm
S0439	you know what type like if you're a bite chirpy or how you say things so
S0441	yeah
S0439	i think it's really important to meet people face to face

S0439	take a bite out of my own arm
S0441	to be fair we'd be limbless wouldn't we really
S0439	we we really would because that i mean cos you could only literally be stress four time in your life unless you eat your toe and finger as like starters
S0441	maybe yeah yeah yeah you'd do that first

S0441	fourteen
S0439	twenty

S0439	yeah and doesn't it hurt i don't know
S0441	they don't have nerve in their legs i don't know
S0439	i mean they must
S0441	they probably don't
S0439	they must no they must move them so they must have nerve
S0441	mm true
S0439	so what do you two do on a friday night well we ponder the live of
S0439	octopus be it octopi octopi octopuses octopi fuck it octopi
S0439	oh
S0441	octopi
S0439	i don't think it be octopi be it octopuses octopus google it
S0441	i think it's just octopus
S0439	octopuses what so
S0441	it's an octopus
S0439	a group of octopus
S0441	yeah
S0439	like sheep
S0441	yeah
S0439	okay
S0441	plural of
S0441	oh it's the first thing that come up
S0439	oh really plural of octopus what be it please tell me it's like not something completely stupid
S0441	it's latin
S0439	latin latin version oh latin
S0441	octopuses
S0439	octopuses
S0441	yeah
S0439	that sound really wrong it sound like it should be octopi
S0441	hang on hang on
S0439	hang on be that some stupid person like say this octopuses
S0441	it be often suppose that octopi be the correct plural of octopus and it have be in use for longer than the use anglicise plural octopuses in fact it it in fact originate as an error octopus be not a simple latin word of the second declension but a latinise form of the greek word
S0439	oktopous
S0441	and its correct plural logically would be octopodes
S0439	octopodes oh
S0441	other word end in us show a very vary pattern like octopi the plural hippopotami be general generally take to be either funny or absurdly pedantic and the er but the usual plural be hippopotamuses
S0439	hippopotamuses could it be er it be hippopotami isn't it
S0441	no
S0439	oh hippopotamus er oh good god okay fun fact of the day
S0441	common usage appear to indicate the slight preference for termini rather than terminuses but syllabuses rather than syllabi
S0439	well yeah we say syllabuses
S0441	mm other usual form include cacti
S0439	mm
S0441	gladioli
S0441	and our file at the dictionary department show scarcely any examples of nucleuses or funguses
S0439	fungi
S0441	so it's nuclei
S0439	and nuclei
S0441	and fungi omnibi be simply a joke
S0439	yeah cos omnibi sucubi incubi they're all like horror creatures aren't they
S0441	be they
S0439	yeah cos in that i think you know buffy the vampire slayer when she meet giles and he get out the book and he be like incubi sucubi
S0439	no just clearly
S0441	no
S0439	i remember that episode i think they're like demons or like monsters or something incubi and sucubi
S0441	among word end in um it seem worth draw attention this be really interest
S0439	yeah
S0441	worth draw attention to the word curricula the plural of curriculum a warn against confusion with the adjective curricular as in extra curricular
S0439	oh okay
S0441	so curricula
S0439	cos er cos people say curriculums don't they you
S0441	it's curricula
S0439	curricula what curricula do your school do
S0439	so people wouldn't be say which what curriculums would your school do school do
S0441	mm
S0439	the english language be so peculiar
S0441	it's so hard feel sorry for people learn it
S0439	i know seriously there's this really interest poem but it's a really long poem actually
S0441	i think i've see it before
S0439	yeah and it's like all like
S0441	really difficult things about the language
S0439	difficult things to say
S0441	yeah
S0439	that you're try to work out how to say them and just how they look the same but they sound different and
S0441	mm
S0439	god even like we do it in the office and even people in the office be like i've get no idea what some of these word mean or how to even pronounce them they be really simple like they look quite simple but be like
S0441	they're just so hard
S0439	like be it this be it that i don't know
S0441	want to know what the plural of moose be
S0439	moosi moo
S0441	it's moose not moo or meese
S0439	meese
S0441	well i suppose geese
S0439	yeah no it just make sense though isn't it like geese meese
S0441	meese imagine why be the here's a question
S0439	uhu
S0441	why be the plural of moose not meese want me to read it to you
S0439	yeah please do i want to know why the plural of moose be not meese
S0441	i think it's the same thing as the octopuses which be good but very
S0439	that it originate from a different place
S0441	no i mean the same site
S0439	oh i see yeah
S0441	as the
S0439	uhu
S0441	as fit as it might sound the plural of moose be not and never have be meese
S0439	i love the way it's like it never have be so don't say it
S0441	and while it's tempt to switch oo for ee the plural of moose be simply moose though you may occasionally see or hear the word moo the confusion be understandable if you consider the word goose with the plural geese give that both animals that give that both be animals and that the two word in their singular form rhyme with one another it's a bite confuse why they don't share a plural change as well so why don't we say meese
S0439	why don't we do tell
S0441	simple the simple reason be that it's a loanword all nouns that be borrow into the english language from their plural with this with the standard plural end s retain the plural end of the donor language eg phenomena algae the phenomenas algaes
S0439	okay
S0441	all remain unchanged in the plural it be also quite possible for the same noun to employ more than one of the above type of plural formation the word moose have its origin in the native american algonquian
S0439	oh god
S0441	algonquian languages adopt into english by british settlers of north america in the early seventeenth century
S0439	so basically it all depend on where the word originally be steal from
S0441	you if if it's from another language you can't change the plural
S0439	mm okay so geese or goose be an english word
S0441	but why then do we say geese instead of goose
S0439	oh good god why do we
S0441	after all geese be an obvious exception to the standard plural in english the reason go back a millennium
S0439	oh good god
S0441	and a half
S0439	there be geese in like a millennium and half ago
S0441	in the beginnings of old english and to a sound change know as mutation define as a change in the sound of a vowel produce by partial assimilation to an adjacent sound
S0439	that go straight over over my head what do that mean
S0441	all that linguistics background might sound pretty complicate
S0441	but it be just answer all your question
S0439	it be this be just like know what i'm gonna what i'm gonna say
S0441	but it but what it boil down to be that goose be one of a relatively small close set of nouns in old english which form their plural in this way
S0439	oh
S0441	the number of such nouns be never large and it have grow smaller over the centuries because the tendency have be for these nouns to take on more common plural end
S0439	like s
S0441	however beside goose there be still a few of these nouns leave in english today which become the mutation plurals can you guess me any quite obvious i mean like you would say these word in real life
S0439	oh crap okay no i can't think of any
S0441	tooth
S0439	teeth
S0441	teeth
S0439	yeah that's true
S0441	and foot
S0439	feet
S0441	feet
S0439	that's true
S0441	the curiosity of moose and meese be just one of the several strange plurals date from old english other word with similarly confuse plurals include child
S0439	and children what about mouth mouse and mice
S0441	true
S0439	they're completely different
S0441	that didn't come next
S0439	oh okay
S0441	shall we google that though
S0439	why be the plural of mouse mouse mice
S0441	well i suppose louse be lice
S0439	yeah
S0441	what else be there house be hice
S0439	but then die be dice
S0441	isn't that a yes hang on
S0439	not douse a douse doesn't become a dice it's a die become a dice or be it a dice become a die no there's one die and then multiple dice
S0441	for more difficult plurals check out this place
S0439	oh good god this be like the app for us seriously
S0441	bacterias bacteriae bacteriums sort out the ignoramuses from the cognoscenti
S0439	whoever know this must be off their head
S0439	it's just ridiculous
S0441	it's in oxford dictionary though
S0439	oh fair enough fuck oxford dictionary
S0441	okay erm okay er many plurals of nouns in english be straightforward to perform
S0439	okay
S0441	in most case all you need to do be tack an s onto the end of the singular so shop become shop donkey because donkeys i'm not gonna go all the way down this pizza become pizzas but then that that surely would be because it be an inherit word
S0439	yeah it should be an it be an inherit word it technically shouldn't have be leave to its oh no erm
S0441	yeah
S0439	then adopt the
S0441	just the s
S0439	yeah the s
S0441	or stay as it's
S0439	as it be yeah
S0441	as it be
S0439	doesn't become pizzai
S0441	pizzai
S0439	or pizzium
S0441	but then that mean you could surely say have some pizza yeah you say have some pizza no but that could be still plural or the singular i just buy
S0439	have a piece of
S0441	lot of pizza you would say that wouldn't you
S0439	you would yeah yeah i've just buy lot of pizza
S0441	mm
S0439	er well you wouldn't well you would say i i've buy i but you say i buy some pizzas
S0441	mm
S0439	you would say i
S0441	no i would say i've buy some pizza
S0439	i would only say i buy some pizza if i'd buy one pizza
S0441	mm
S0439	if i'd buy like three i'd be like i've buy some pizzas
S0441	mm
S0439	but then i would say have some pizza imply have multiple slice
S0441	mm you wouldn't say have some pizzas
S0439	have some pizzas
S0439	i think it's because it when you use the word pizza the pizza refer to the whole thing
S0441	mm
S0439	it doesn't prefer to it refer to it when it's be separate or cut into slice cos they become slice of pizza don't they
S0441	mm
S0439	you refer to it as a whole same as cake though isn't it
S0441	mm true yeah i just buy lot of cake
S0439	or i've buy lot of cake
S0441	mm anyway
S0439	mm weird
S0441	so geese the
S0439	seriously this be what we do on a friday night it's just
S0439	this suck well not suck but this be like the most ridiculous thing for twenty four year olds to do
S0441	it's like i'm nearly twenty five that's my excuse
S0439	you be nearly twenty twenty five
S0441	unfortunately the singular form of some of these common english word now seem to be cause difficulty there's a recent trend to use the plural spell women as a singular noun
S0439	what
S0441	no oh this mistake crop up in all type of write i've i would never do that
S0439	i've never do that i'd never be like oh that the that women
S0441	this be this be what this say eileen be a lovely women
S0439	no one say that
S0439	a single women can have a child now
S0439	you say single women can have children now but you wouldn't say a you wouldn't say a single women can have a child now it's stupid
S0441	old norse egg and italian pianos that's the next title one of the main cause of plural puzzlement lie in the fact that english word be full of word that have be borrow from other languages
S0439	yeah
S0441	erm oh old norse give us freckle and egg splinter and gherkin oh no splinter and gherkin be dutch sorry
S0439	oh okay
S0441	hazard and alcohol be arabic
S0439	erm the irony be that they don't drink much alcohol
S0441	yeah once absorb into english most noun loanwords word behave in the same way as other english word when it come to form their plurals hazard freckle splinter etcetera the main categories of borrow word that can cause problems for english speakers be when be those which be source chiefly from latin ancient greek french and italian
S0439	mm
S0441	so form accord to english rule piano hang on you can't blame anyone for be confuse i be a bite confuse then
S0441	in effect there be no hard and fast rule as to whether as to whether the plural of such word be form accord to english rule so you've get piano pianos virus and viruses form accord to the rule of the parent language criterion become criteria bacterium become bacteria paparazzo become paparazzi
S0439	paparazzo
S0441	that's the singular i would imagine of a paparazzi
S0439	i think people use the word paparazzi now to mean the singular
S0441	yeah
S0439	i or unless there's like paparazzi
S0441	if there's a paparazzi yeah form accord to either english rule or those original language cactus cacti or cactuses virtuoso virtuosos of virtuosi
S0439	what's a virtuoso
S0441	dunno
S0439	okay
S0439	sound like something from harry potter
S0441	chateau become chateaux as in a french spell or chateaus with an s on the end
S0439	no that look ridiculous
S0441	it do er as before the best way to ensure you're correct be to check a good dictionary
S0439	like the oxford dictionary not that we're sell ourselves by the way guy
S0441	no
S0439	you don't have to buy us but we really think you should uhu uhu
S0441	but this be all go on about octopus again now hang on
S0439	we already know about octopus okay
S0441	we've learn about
S0439	it's just such a peculiar language
S0441	do it say about mice i'm gonna i'm gonna google it right now why be the plural
S0439	and even just like even just like look at the coke bottle you've get a mix such a mixture of like plurals and non plurals so you've get diet coke no calories no sugar
S0441	mm
S0439	so there's one plural one singular but then you have with sweeteners
S0441	mm
S0439	so there's like so sugar in that sense be a singular but then sweeteners be a plural imply a
S0441	you do say sugar don't you
S0439	yeah sugar yeah which imply different type of sugar
S0441	mm
S0439	mm crazy well it's not really crazy at all but it be maybe interest mm ah it's cos there be multiple sweeteners in it well two actually
S0441	well it's not gonna say
S0439	no no it say here it say aspartame and
S0441	no i mean what's that say no sweeteners
S0439	no it say with sweeteners
S0441	so that wouldn't say with two sweeteners
S0439	no no but
S0439	well yeah just with the one sugar and then it's like they use two sweeteners
S0441	mm
S0439	to replace one sugar mm oh they i saw this thing on the it be the daily mail so don't judge me but it be like say out how much sugar be in can of coke and stuff like that
S0441	mm
S0439	and i think in one country i be read in england there be like ten teaspoons of sugar in
S0441	mm
S0439	in one can of something you're just like fuck my life
S0441	crazy
S0439	ten teaspoons of sugar in one three hundred and thirty mil can of something be horrendous
S0439	you can understand why like in america they have such a problem
S0441	uhu
S0439	but apparently the japanese have some of the sweetest drink but they're like tiny
S0441	what do someone's be to japan recently one of my friends at work and she say what do she say it's become a problem now but i can't remember what she say it be because they obviously eat all the same food like every day or like all
S0439	mm
S0441	for breakfast and for dinner eat a lot of like rice and
S0439	yeah
S0441	something else but she say sure it be something to do the with that they're begin to import sort of westernise foods and things
S0439	yeah i can imagine yeah
S0441	i watch a documentary about india as well where the middle class they can they're the only ones that can well obviously and upper class but
S0439	yeah
S0441	middle class especially can afford to get like all the fast food and stuff so erm they do basically and they're become
S0439	yeah yeah
S0441	really big obesity problem in children
S0439	in china as well same problem
S0441	yeah really really bad be it not but that's not what what their body i suppose be use to
S0439	yeah yeah it must be so different for them like us go to china and stuff it or like go abroad it even just go abroad to like i'd never go to barcelona and stuff it still like it still make your tummy go a bite weird
S0441	mm
S0439	because like i barcelona we eat so much carbs like we have like bread and stuff for breakfast you have bread for lunch you have you know like rice for dinner like that be so much more carbohydrate than what
S0441	yeah
S0439	or a different form of carbohydrate to what we're use to here like they just eat so much like they're really predominantly heavy carb meals which true people in england do but it's just different type of carb
S0441	mm
S0439	yeah
S0441	yeah
S0439	like i always find when you go on holiday you never eat as many vegetables and stuff as you should do but
S0441	no
S0439	but then in turkey like i didn't have too much problems but erm they do they they fry a lot of their food like deep fry it in lot of well not deep well yeah they do deep fry but they also fry everything in like oil
S0441	mm
S0439	like a shitload of oil
S0441	yeah
S0439	but
S0441	weird isn't it
S0439	mm but then i guess their food probably isn't as like not not that's not what i mean but you know like process as ours maybe
S0441	mm maybe
S0439	anyway
S0441	who know
S0439	well all i know be that i don't think i eat too badly sometimes i do don't get me wrong i'm definitely not say that i have a good diet but i think i have a better diet than a lot of people
S0441	oh yeah
S0439	like there be some days obviously where i eat cake and shit like that but if i do i don't eat like a lot of it
S0441	mm
S0439	so it's like yeah it's like when like with the whole breakfast thing with like it's a fry up so a fry up must have a least like er eight hundred calories or whatever in it which be fine if that's like the main meal you have that day but like don't get me wrong i'm like very jealous like the amount of food can like stuff into her and not get bigger like she she must like she's get she's get like normal size thighs and everything but and like that's the thing where her weight go but she's like on top she's tiny like what the fuck
S0441	mm
S0439	if i eat anything it's like just go to my butt and my legs and my
S0441	she might have a lot of visceral fat though
S0439	true i just think er she also must have a very good metabolism
S0441	yeah
S0439	mine's just shit my metabolism it's so like slow
S0441	so be mine
S0439	not that i'm blame that why i'm a little bite tubby but you know what i mean so i just can't i couldn't be arsed to be somebody who calorie count though it's such an effort
S0441	life's too short for that
S0439	mm tell me about it
S0441	it's go quickly
S0439	i know i be think that as well i be like for fuck's sake i'm gonna do my bedroom and then i'm then i'll get in the clean mood and i'll come down here erm
S0441	well i'll start in here doe
S0439	i've gotta do my iron so i might as well do the live room and i'll do the iron downstairs
S0441	the live be actually fine isn't it really
S0439	mm
S0441	all things consider
S0439	just get to sweep it i guess don't we
S0441	dust it i suppose
S0439	bite of dust
S0441	excuse me
S0439	it's just this room it just look messy but it's just because it's just such a dreary colour like the white be like this dodgy off white the floor genuinely look
S0441	filthy
S0439	filthy
S0441	to be fair though it must have be like this when we look at it and i don't remember think god this kitchen's filthy
S0439	that's true
S0441	so i think it would be as i say people have like rise tint glass on don't they when they look round house
S0439	mainly cos most people just wanna get in don't they
S0441	yeah we do
S0439	yeah we do that's true we just couldn't be arsed to look round any more
S0441	we be just
S0439	house hunt be so
S0441	so bore
S0439	painful i remember didn't we only look round two or three do we look at
S0441	i i look round one you look round one i look round this one with you
S0439	when come up
S0441	that be it
S0439	yeah and
S0441	oh no we look round do you look round on your own
S0439	oh yeah i do yeah
S0441	yeah
S0439	and it be really small
S0441	yeah
S0439	it be really small
S0441	those three that i forget about the one that be a really good effort wasn't it
S0439	really which we didn't even try it's cos just so bore it's such an effort
S0441	to be fair this be absolutely fine when we find it
S0439	oh yeah
S0441	so what's the point of look at any more i can't
S0439	exactly
S0441	be bother
S0439	exactly
S0439	even just think about it make me wanna cry
S0441	it's oh
S0439	like
S0441	god
S0439	we do not to do any more no more house hunt well until like in a few months
S0441	yeah
S0439	i need to go and look for like a cheap room somewhere
S0441	that should be easy though surely for you because
S0439	yeah it's just a spare i'm just gonna er have a look on spareroom i don't need a house do i i just need a room oh well i'm look for maybe about four hundred pound a month something like that
S0441	yeah get a good one i mean she's obviously in but hers be four hundred pound a month and she live with like a really nice girl
S0439	mm yeah
S0441	it's quite a good one
S0439	i just wanna rent a room hopefully just maybe still in just because of the netball and stuff like that and it's just
S0441	nice
S0439	bite more convenient like i do like but i have my car and everything so if i move to i wouldn't need the car and then it kind of like become a bite redundant have a car
S0439	no i'll just have a look and find somewhere nice then it'll be fine
S0441	surely there'll be people in that
S0439	exactly yeah exactly
S0441	mm
S0439	so and it's only gonna be for like january to june or something january
S0441	mm
S0439	to may so not the end of the world mm
S0439	yeah just and also at the moment i just hate it that i just like literally live for payday i just
S0441	i know i i'm already think about the next payday
S0439	so be i
S0439	i mean i've get two weeks to go and i've something pathetic like a hundred quid to last me
S0439	just i know exactly where my money go well this month i know where my money's go but i think after this i'm go to try and save more
S0441	i say that every month
S0439	i know
S0441	it's so ridiculous i always think right this month be gonna be the month i'm not gonna spend money on stupid things oh wait
S0439	i only just buy a jacket today
S0441	that'll be why
S0439	i know and it's like not gonna be spend any more money oh this jacket's really nice
S0441	oh but it's really
S0439	dunno why dunno why i do this to myself but no to be fair genuinely everything i'm do in october have already be pay for
S0441	yeah
S0439	both my holiday in november have already be pay for and i'm there's fuck all to do in like december
S0441	no
S0439	all i've get to do be go to like maybe for a weekend or to go the christmas market it's like i never spend money at the christmas market because it's just full of crap the only stuff i buy be food
S0441	yeah same
S0439	so
S0441	hot chocolate and mull wine
S0439	so hopefully december and especially if we don't have to pay rent here
S0441	mm
S0439	hopefully december i should be able to save like a good five hundred six hundred pound maybe
S0441	uhu
S0439	so that would be good
S0441	hopefully you'll be able to maybe ring up the electric people on if
S0439	well that be what i'm think if when the moment we find out i will ring the electrics erm i will ring the water and i will fill in a form for the council tax and tell them because then we could get would reduce council tax maybe probably not maybe i don't know but no but you have to fill out a move out
S0441	yeah
S0439	form anyway so
S0441	i'm gonna as well because they they literally just disconnect you on like the day that you ring up so i'm just gonna i'll ring when on the day we move out
S0439	what for the internet
S0441	yeah
S0439	yeah uhu
S0441	i be think as well it'll actually be less than two hundred pound when we get there
S0439	by the time we go yeah i guess yeah
S0441	cos he be he be calculate it from yesterday so
S0441	yeah i think that as well yeah
S0439	that would be two months less so i don't know i'll be like a hundred and fifty or something
S0439	mm
S0441	er less than that cos it's sixty sixty quid for two months
S0439	it won't be the end of the world
S0441	no
S0439	but yeah but if we get to if we move down in december that'll be two months' rent technically save
S0441	yeah which be good
S0439	which will be really good
S0441	really handy
S0439	that's like eight hundred quid save seven hundred and fifty quid which obviously i have to spend like on petrol drive and stuff or well that wouldn't that's not too bad
S0441	yeah but it be it wouldn't be like you be then miss it from the other money though
S0439	no exactly yeah so yeah that's true and i could try and like yeah i i might stay for a few nights i'm not too worry about it at all it's only for a couple of weeks
S0441	yeah fine yay
S0439	yay
S0439	probably just yeah just er move out in december just mean we wouldn't have to pay over christmas when neither of us be here
S0441	yeah a waste of time
S0439	exactly a waste of time waste of money waste of everything really anyway we'll hammer this out tomorrow
S0439	well just
S0441	helpful
S0439	just a nerd i'm a massive nerd
S0441	what do you keep on there
S0439	erm so what i have i have move out day first or second week in december we be flexible and happy to move out early december erm kitchen include dishwasher wash machine table chair cooker fridge obviously but erm live room drawers shelf bookcase tv stand cos we want them to know that they're gonna have to buy a sofa and a tv and
S0441	yeah yeah yeah
S0439	stuff like that erm bedrooms drawers build in wardrobe and then i write single bed currently in neighbour's garage but as we buy our own two double bed bill outline how much we pay each month
S0439	that's all they need to know and then like at the bottom i think i just say like it come to something like five hundred quid a month
S0441	mm
S0439	which be like which isn't bad so yeah so i'm a massive nerd but it doesn't bother me
S0441	they'll they'll be appreciative if it's
S0439	no they won't they will get in the car and like they're fuck weirdos
S0441	what's wrong with that
S0439	it's an information pack
S0441	shall we hand them out at the door when they leave
S0439	well you know i would like to know how much i would be pay in bill
S0441	yeah
S0439	if i move into a place
S0441	well we be pretty like unaware weren't we
S0439	yeah
S0441	i mean it be a nice surprise but it could have be a horrible surprise
S0439	mm yeah when she be oh it's like how much do you pay in council tax like obviously i think she must have be pay something different to us because
S0441	what be she pay again something
S0439	like two hundred pound a month or something
S0439	it's like
S0441	they really do her over
S0439	yeah like what the hell be you why be you pay two hundred we don't even pay two hundred pound a month
S0439	and there be two of us like what be you on
S0439	about love
S0441	she be weird
S0439	she be bless her heart wasn't she but you'll be you gonna keep your bed or be you gonna try and sell it or
S0441	my bed i'll keep it
S0439	mm
S0441	i prefer that bed to the one that's in the spare room at home
S0439	oh i see so be your mum gonna get rid of that one do she think
S0441	she's gonna put it indoors somewhere
S0439	i'm gonna talk to my parent a be like can i move cos the thing be 's bed need to go like it's shit so i think i'll just suggest them like get rid of 's and they have this one at their house
S0441	good idea
S0439	when i go back oh oh no i forget to tell you mum be gonna be make redundant
S0441	she be
S0439	yeah shit they what they've offer her be to apply for a job that she can't apply for because she hasn't get any of the skills to apply for it
S0441	right
S0439	so they're offer her i think it's like a lump sum of thirteen or fifteen thousand pound
S0441	oh great
S0439	erm a pension because she might want to retire at fifty eight years old cos even though she's still get like another what six years leave seven years leave with so five hundred pound a month pension and fifteen thousand pound lump sum
S0441	thank guy
S0439	yeah
S0441	thank for all that support
S0439	yeah
S0441	that i've give you yeah
S0439	yeah so that's that's like just over a thousand pound a year redundancy package they've give her and she's be there for like ten years so yeah it's a pathetic amount and she's not she when you get make redundant you're not allow to look for another job or
S0441	why
S0439	start another job within three months of your redundancy package if not it's forfeit and you don't get the money so she's get to be out of work from december through till march i think
S0441	she's gonna be a real pleasure to work with in that time
S0439	oh i feel so sorry for my dad
S0439	i'm not entirely sure what she's gonna do but she's get to do something
S0441	have they keep on thingy then
S0439	i don't know i don't think they've keep on anybody well not anybody but i think they've get rid of a lot of people like i don't think mum's redundancy be completely confirm like it's not like she's have the letter that's i think that's
S0441	that's what she know
S0439	yeah that's like
S0441	well more fool them
S0439	exactly what a joke oh yeah let's get an academy and fuck everybody over
S0441	what morons
S0439	mm
S0441	well good luck to them
S0439	yeah be just gonna go up its own arse really isn't it
S0441	yes
S0439	dunno who's gonna be organise the exams now
S0441	exactly who's gonna be do that shit
S0439	but yeah so
S0441	be they they i think that they can just get someone else then i guess to do it
S0439	yeah someone else in cheaper though mum wasn't quite i think a big salary for an i think she be one something like twenty six or twenty seven so for an admin person i think that's probably
S0441	that's quite a lot of money
S0439	quite a well not admin but you know like she wasn't a manager and everything but she be a high end admin basically
S0441	why couldn't they just have reduce her pay
S0439	dunno i just don't know but either way she's gonna be make redundant i think and they're just gonna mum and dad be just gonna have to work it out thing be though it's not like mum can't do anything else like she's get the skills she could easily work for someone like or
S0441	do she not want to get another job then
S0439	i don't know i don't know what she's she'll have to she can't sit at home for the next forty years can she
S0441	as you've discuss no she cannot
S0439	like well maybe not forty years
S0441	she'll waste her years away
S0439	yeah
S0441	on candy crush
S0439	yeah thirty years leave she can't sit at home and like do nothing for thirty years can she dad'll dad would leave her i genuinely think that would end in divorce like it's be touch and go over the years anyway
S0439	i'm not entirely sure how my parent be even still together but erm
S0441	this could break them
S0439	this could break them so i mean not at the moment but i think if she be off work for a long period of time it would
S0441	why doesn't she become a freelance cake maker
S0439	not good enough at cake
S0441	no
S0439	she's more like a cooker than a baker i think she should just get like a i thing be though i say to her why don't you have a look at cie so cie be basically like an international version of ocr or aqa right and it's who we work really closely with and like they have exam things all the time like why can't she just go and work for an exam board
S0441	mm
S0439	i i be like well you could move to cambridge mum you've always want to move to and she be like would you live with me and your dad if i move to i be like sure
S0439	why not mm
S0441	i love her little ideas that she
S0439	i know she'll be we're move to he'll be like what the fuck
S0441	yeah
S0441	we're off
S0439	we're off what's happen mm er i think dad would like to live in be a nice place but i don't think that's in his ideas at the moment
S0441	not when she's just lose her job probably not
S0439	no
S0441	oh that's really really bad
S0439	it be bad er luckily dad i think dad's dad earn enough to support them both at the moment
S0441	yeah
S0439	and obviously because they don't have a mortgage or anything they have
S0441	yeah that that help
S0439	it's like his whole salary it's not like it's his it's not like a salary that load of bill have to come out of
S0441	be the house finish yet

S0441	but he he probably get that mortgage think it's alright i've get a steady job
S0439	yeah he be like i think he be really quite well pay like he'd work his way up he be like head of upper sixth or something yeah
S0441	he wasn't even teacher be he
S0439	no he just work his way up he be like quite successful at it i think but erm yeah weird
S0441	weird
S0439	so he i don't er he wouldn't get much of a redundancy package he's only be in the job for what like four years
S0441	no yeah
S0439	yeah but like you kind of think oh yeah a lump sum of fifteen grand that isn't that's not gonna get you very far
S0441	not really if you're use to have a particular salary every month
S0439	that's a grand a month for a year
S0441	yeah
S0439	just over a grand a month for a year
S0441	do you get tax on redundancy but
S0439	no
S0441	no
S0439	you don't get tax on it so it be a it be a lump sum but well and she get five hundred pound pension so for for a year she'll have fifteen pound fifteen hundred a month and after that she'd be fuck you would hope she would get a job within a year obviously but
S0441	finger cross
S0439	i mean how do people live on five hundred pound a month
S0441	well i suppose people be under the impression that you're a pensioner so you don't do anything
S0441	seriously that's what i think that they think the amount of like the stuff that like stupid because they end up give people these pension i suppose state pension
S0439	mm
S0441	then people realise that they haven't get any money to do anything so they get feed back into the system and their care you know they need care and stuff that the government
S0439	yeah
S0441	have to pay for and it's just like ridiculous it's it's a really stupid system
S0439	and the people like who doesn't spend anything can just hoard money like
S0439	fuck the rothschilds
S0441	it's like bank
S0439	really
S0439	every time i speak to dad it's just like just keep get bigger and just like well that's great isn't it
S0441	where do she get it all from be it pension
S0439	erm no it's when so when grandad's brother die he get i think like it's twenty odd grand and then grandad have save and life insurance i think and then they accidentally like years ago put something like fifteen thousand pound into a save account and forget about it so now there's something like seventy grand in there
S0441	jesus
S0439	yeah
S0441	i'd like to be able to forget about fifteen grand
S0439	i know oh yeah just chill in a bank somewhere it's like yeah chill for a fuck long time grandma and then i think my dad put load of her money into you know recently the government bond they have like really good interest rat for government bond but you have to leave them in there for four years or something like that so i think he whack a load of her money into those and he say to my auntie beforehand he be like do you need any of 's money to buy a house because want to move and she be like no no no we're fine we're fine we're fine so he put all of this into erm a government save bond which you can't take out unless you have to pay a penalty and then she come to dad and be like oh yeah i need ten thousand pound and dad be like well tough you can't like
S0441	too late
S0439	yeah you have to ask er we we can't get it out of the bond without her and go to and tell her that dad wouldn't give her any money and dad be like what
S0441	surely she wouldn't have believe that
S0439	yeah no i don't think she do
S0441	not her
S0439	not her
S0439	her boy her light of her life boy
S0439	dad be like no i didn't go away stupid sister
S0441	mm
S0439	oh one day one day i'll marry a rich man and won't have to worry about any of it
S0441	wanna live a life of luxury
S0439	we be like the other day someone say i'd love to be a keep woman how much you how much would your husband have to earn for you to be a keep woman and i be like hundred odd thousand maybe and they're like no he wouldn't that's a lot of money i be like okay a keep woman to the standard i want to be keep
