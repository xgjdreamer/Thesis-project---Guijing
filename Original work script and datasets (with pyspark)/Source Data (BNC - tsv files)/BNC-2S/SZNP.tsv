S0266	so as i'm cut your hair
S0268	oh yeah
S0266	do you want to tell me about erm the new phase of your business plan or or the troubleshoot of your business plan
S0268	well i've yeah i discover that there's another erm element to things not just the standard area that i'm do which be the bull
S0266	no what i what i mean be that how be you go to overcome this problem of the string break at the bottom of the racket your latest i suggest the pva glue you've slightly poo pooed that
S0268	well they're well i didn't really erm the problem with that be that if you just use the glue then i don't think there's any much protection really there's not a lot of protection so i think it's belt and brace i think you need the glue and the tape and then the tape would be quite difficult to get off
S0266	but i think you say the tape be no good because they pick it off
S0268	well i think they would they could well pick it off
S0266	so what's what's this new
S0268	well the new thing be these you have to put so to to protect the frame to protect the string it's to eh somehow put cable tie around in a way that we lift the racket from the grind by about a millimetre only a millimetre i think
S0268	and these cable tie be that's all the thickness they be they're about a millimetre two millimetres and by put a series of cable tie around the top then it's go to be protect the string be go to be protect the string be go to be protect and that should do the job the only problem be that it take quite a few of these cable tie per racket i think maybe six or seven and even though these be very cheap to buy
S0266	why six or seven if they surely they're only hit the end
S0268	well well yes but they're hit well as you look at the racket what i've find be that from the the string go mainly between eleven o'clock and one o'clock as you look at the racket okay but quite a few go between ten o'clock and two o'clock so if they go between ten and two o'clock that mean you need more tie more of these cable tie to protect a a a larger perimeter so i mean you could just say right all the damage be go to be right at the end it's go to be between eleven o'clock and one o'clock and then you can get away with four or five tie if you extend that slightly to ten from ten o'clock till two o'clock then you need two or three more tie which mean more work tie be very very cheap so it doesn't really matter about the tie at all then the cost of the tie cos they're ridiculously cheap it's just
S0266	well how what what erm cost would it racket
S0268	well i've look on well i look on the internet and i think you can get a hundred for sixty p so so if they're that cheap
S0266	oh right it's minimal
S0268	well it's it's very little it's less it's less than five p a racket
S0266	but what about
S0268	and then so you're charge for the labour
S0266	yeah what about the labour
S0268	well that's the next stage i've get to research because the i've be on the internet and where you can get the cable tie from you can also buy these machine eh they look a bite like a gun really like a staple gun but you you put the tie into the gun erm the eh i think you would have to put both end in oh no no it's it's a way of tensioning the tie so hopefully the the machine get near enough to the edge of the racket so it can tie it fairly tight so they won't sort of move around when the the racket's be swing they should just be tight enough not to move when they're they're be play with like this one here be move
S0266	but but
S0268	but the this be not move
S0266	i can't look because i'm cut your hair
S0268	okay right
S0266	we should be have conversations about holiday if i'm the hairdresser not about
S0268	okay but it's yeah it's fine well this be much more interest
S0266	be it
S0268	but there's only these ones that put on the other day there's only one that's very loose the rest be all quite tight or tight enough so i think that might be the answer to the answer to the problem
S0266	but what about change the erm eh aerodynamics of the of the racket
S0268	well that's that's i just think that they're just so like these things i don't think it'll make any difference at all
S0266	have you play with one
S0268	no i haven't but i will do that's a very good point so what i'll do tomorrow when i'm go to badminton i'll put five on mind you there's a lot of difference between
S0266	it might improve your game
S0268	there's a lot of difference between the badminton i play and school badminton because my racket's a lot lighter than school racket you might i might notice it but i'm still that's still quite a good idea i could put five or six on and see whether i can still play it also the other thing we'll see if anybody notice it there see whether you know or i could actually say can you notice anything about this racket i think they would because they they do stand out a bite but if i put some very small tie on like these erm not invisible ones clear ones and you could show it to someone and say can you see anything notice anything about this racket and it could well be the case that they won't see anything because they're clear they can and from a distance and see as they're they're all get on and their eyesight be not that good
S0266	who's who the
S0268	the the players that i play with
S0266	what they can't see
S0268	well yeah they can actually a bite of a joke now
S0266	mm
S0268	but
S0266	sorry i miss that
S0268	you miss that but i think they could they could erm they'd have a job to see once it's like more than than the racket's more than about two or three metres away from you i don't think you can see them if you're close up within a metre or two metres you'd see them but further than that you wouldn't so erm but i think it's a good idea to to play with one it's a very good idea
S0266	i'm just go to put the light on so i can see actually see what i'm do
S0268	so i can i can do that for tomorrow it's a very good idea play with one and see see if it i i'm pretty sure because erm i'm not very good on weight but i would think that one one of these tie would weigh probably about two grams maybe less i think the shuttlecock weight about five grams so if this weigh only erm so say it's a gram or gram and a half i reckon each tie that would be you would be put like seven grams seven or eight grams on the racket and the racket weigh eighty grams so you're actually increase the weight by a nominal ten percent something like that and that should be
S0266	yeah but for aerodynamics that can
S0268	well it could be that you'll notice it yeah it could be i'll notice it but
S0266	could be quite serious
S0268	but for school be doesn't really matter i don't think i don't i don't think that you know that i that isn't an issue in because most school players be not club or county players they're not particularly good they wouldn't notice it i'm sure they wouldn't notice it but but what maybe well they they wouldn't notice it when they're play but it's a question of whether the teachers will accept it as an addition or there might be a slight health and safety issue aswell i think you mention that to me before
S0266	why
S0268	well these things protrude don't they slightly if they're tight and be keep inside but i i think they can still be revolve you can still revolve them around you see what i mean you can still so kid will probably do that
S0266	yeah but they can't pick them off
S0268	they can't pick them off they be tamper proof exactly
S0268	there's no way you can get those out except with a pair of erm tin snip
S0266	so who who have this idea
S0266	really
S0268	mm
S0266	what do he immediately
S0268	cheese me off really that he have the idea and i didn't
S0266	mm
S0268	he he he mention cable tie first and i i couldn't quite see what he be get at and then he explain it and then he he then i go to his house didn't i go to his garage and then he he get all these cable tie out and we have a look at them all and we take some into the kitchen and then we spend about half an hour three quarter of an hour experiment he out these on and he also do this as i say this thing with a pipe but that's i think if anything's loose or slightly erm vulnerable the kid will find it out that's why the table cable tie be such a good idea cos they cos they cannot be take off at all there's no way they can come off except with a tool so the two things that we do that we get quite excite about neither of them be student proof so we'd go back to the idea of just put the tie on with nothing with them hold nothing on the racket whatsoever so you just have the raw cable tie
S0266	so
S0268	five or six of them and and that will lift the racket far enough off the floor for them never to for the string to never come in contact with the floor that's that's what it's all about
S0266	so be you do a erm a sort of eh trial trial at that school
S0268	yeah i think i will i think i will i think i'll say it to him that i've get a better idea or i've eh potentially
S0266	what what have you give him at the moment to try
S0268	why that's a good question i've give him three type of racket and they're all colour cod one be just with pva glue which be which be your idea
S0266	sorry ear
S0268	so one have just get glue on and i've colour cod it on but it two well colour cod it and also mark the racket in case the tape come off i it's double indemnity er another one be erm pva glue and then allow to dry and then tape put on the pva glue and the third category be pva glue and immediately put tape over the pva glue so it's put on when when wet so there's the three type of our trialling he know all about that
S0266	and when be you when you go back to
S0268	well i'll leave it a few months i think it's it's get to be over time hasn't it but i can i can actually get it i think i've get plenty of racket in the garage i can give him a couple of these or maybe more and say could you could you erm keep this in your fleet of racket as it be
S0266	fleet be that what it's call a fleet of racket
S0268	well it's a fleet yeah they use the word fleet not just taxis you get like wind turbines a fleet of wind turbines yeah
S0266	yeah mm
S0268	yeah fleet be use quite a bite as a compound
S0266	fleet of cars
S0268	fleet of cars fleet of taxis fleet of lorries so fleet of racket
S0266	no
S0268	well
S0266	be that you or
S0268	well i'm i'm i'm christen our return here
S0266	your turn it's not an official
S0268	well i think you can use it feature practice
S0266	have you hear it before
S0268	no
S0266	well i think you're make it up as you go along
S0268	well i be yeah but i think that i think it's an excellent use of the word
S0266	right
S0268	so if i give him like three of these racket three or four or i could just go back and say which racket be go i'll mend them and then i'll i'll put this this device on cos he's up for it he say it's a good plan and he's will to help
S0266	be he not the stress out teacher
S0268	he probably be a stress out teacher but he's at least get time to email me occasionally so he can't be that stress out
S0266	primary school
S0268	pardon
S0266	primary school be it
S0268	no no it's a secondary school
S0266	oh
S0268	second of course it's
S0266	mm
S0268	but it's in so yeah they you you wouldn't have the problem in a primary school because a the kid don't play badminton in the same way that they do in secondary school and b if they and and that assume they're play the majority won't play badminton in a primary school but those that do play they the level would be very low and they they wouldn't be swing the racket around on the floor like they do in secondary school which be where all the damage take place so it's it's purely a secondary school idea this primary school you can do the erm you can do the the of the racket and not that's what i do with be that alright
S0266	what with her school
S0268	er yeah well with erm she give me i she give me i think she give me something like thirty hockey stick and about thirty racket and not one of those case do you think well obviously not for the hockey stick but for the tennis racket not one set of string have go it be just pure erm grip that need replace so have she go to her catalogue and get erm tennis racket new which be what she be go to do they would have they would have cost anywhere between nine and fourteen pound and i i give a special rate but i mend them for under three pound okay so she be very grateful so
S0266	so that prove to you that primary school don't same problem
S0268	well i'm pretty sure because i mean that school do a lot of sport and they they do tennis they erm i don't think the badminton racket would ever wear out really unless they play every day with them but i'm sure they don't i've just actually give thirty two racket so erm but i i'm confident that they won't wear out because i i know the way that badminton be teach and she use ball as well so i i know that they won't be it's just a completely different ball game as it be
S0266	i've cut your ear you know there's blood there
S0268	dreadful
S0266	i'll just get the tissue
S0268	how do you do that
S0266	i don't know they must be very sharp the scissor
S0268	oh well i i say
S0266	i say i nearly cut your ear
S0268	i say be careful but you've get three lot of scissor here four lot of scissor and you've probably choose the sharpest one
S0266	i i suppose you could sue me really
S0268	no i wouldn't do that so go back to this now you know quite a lot about the whole thing would you would you say this be a good solution to the problem these
S0266	i yeah i think it be
S0268	right well that's good
S0266	i just i think it's the best you've have so far
S0268	yeah
S0266	look best
S0268	it's just you need quite a few of these tie i think you need probably seven
S0266	i don't
S0268	just so that be a bite labour intensive isn't it
S0266	well you'll just have to up the price
S0268	yeah well what you do you'd explain it it's future proof i think that's quite a good term future proof you're future proof the racket and you'd have a guarantee that if they go to the if the string go to the top within say a few months six months then you would do the job for nothing you would and you're not lose anything there cos i'd i'm pretty sure they would never go they and they don't go in the middle i know that from mend about three hundred racket
S0266	but if you get okay let's imagine you get all this sort out
S0268	mm yeah
S0266	erm what about your market be that get lot of order
S0268	no not get very many at the moment i've get to have a i've get to have another campaign on market cos i a lot of a lot of flyers have go out but not many people have erm
S0266	that's that's sorry that set on that trimmer be that's just shave the whole head
S0268	i know
S0266	i didn't want that i need a number
S0268	well you know you've get to get to put these on
S0266	well can you put it on you usually do that
S0268	it's this one i think
S0266	it'll have a stripe up the back cos it's take all the hair off
S0268	well that's great
S0266	i cut your ear spike in your hairdo
S0268	oh oh dear what about that then
S0266	not well you need
S0268	that's about right
S0266	mm
S0268	not that
S0266	okay
S0268	alright
S0266	i'll do another stripe
S0268	well don't cos you
S0266	i'm afraid bald bite there i've cut
S0268	could you start at the other end sorry how do that go
S0266	it's not it's not short enough
S0268	not short enough okay give it back
S0266	it's not
S0268	well that's that's as far as it can go
S0266	can you take your glass off
S0268	yeah sure
S0266	right sorry i distract you what erm you you be talk about the market
S0268	market yeah well i think maybe i've just get to concentrate on local school and just pick the racket up that's something doesn't seem
S0266	it doesn't seem to want to power through
S0268	why be that
S0266	maybe it's too short for i just cut the hair quite long quite short i mean
S0268	well maybe that's it maybe
S0266	and there's a load of hair in there could you
S0266	eh don't you're put it all over the floor now
S0268	well give that a whirl
S0266	can you pick up that bits of hair
S0268	but i think
S0266	sorry yeah go on
S0268	well the thing be to to convince school that they would be save money and if they're
S0266	yeah but how be you
S0268	well in two ways to mend to mend their
S0266	oh it's not this thing isn't switch on
S0268	oh right
S0266	that's why i haven't get the power right we're in business now
S0268	oh
S0266	sorry i keep interrupt you yeah go on market how be you go to get customers
S0268	well i think the main the main market really be the practicality of the idea and the economy of the idea if i can convince them that would they would save like hundreds of pound a year on racket then i think it's a give that they would they would go for it but one idea might be to actually talk on the phone to not the pe department but the bursar or the person who pick up the phone who's in charge of money and say i can save your school a hundred two hundred pound a year every year by a very simple measure would you like to hear about it how would that be
S0266	well i don't know anything
S0268	because if they if the string go then they have to replace the racket which would cost them anywhere between five and ten pound okay and that's what school do they don't they don't mend them so i mean that school the other day that erm they'd get in touch with me when we be on holiday they they he say he think it be a very good idea but all these racket have go er and then i go over when we come back from holiday and i pick them up and i have a look at them all and they have all go in the same way in the same place and then i get back in touch with him and i i explain exactly what have happen erm and that's when i think of use that school as a kind of erm
S0266	guinea pig
S0268	guinea pig research project and he be very will to take part in it but things have move on so we'd move on from glue to tape
S0266	so be you charge him for this stuff or be you
S0268	well i i say you know in because you're go to help us with this project i'll do these racket for nothing he be very will to pay for them but i the trade off be that he's go to take part in this project
S0266	well that's good
S0268	so i think well that's that's mean it's free from he think he's get something for nothing and i think i'm get something for nothing or very little so if he keep an eye on the racket i've colour cod them and mark them so i'll know exactly what's happen so he can see whether the ones that i've give him be you know have more protection and i'll slip in four or five more racket into his fleet
S0266	fleet
S0268	fleet of racket and and see what i will actually phone him up eh in after half term and say have you get any racket and i'll put these this additional measure on and see whether it work the best solution though as i explain to you be to have the racket make properly so that the string don't protrude
S0266	well that's a huge business project
S0268	well it's a good project that that mean a trip to or you've get contact in maybe you could chat up some of your contact
S0266	mm
S0268	have you
S0266	well i don't think they'd be much good at make racket
S0268	well they might be able to introduce me to the people who might be able to do it or at least do some research in their own language no
S0266	mm well it would cost you so much money to pay
S0268	i know but but but it solve the problem that's and maybe they're aware of it and they just want to carry on with these racket know that they're go to keep come back with repeat order because the string be go to break maybe they know all about that maybe they're very canny or maybe no maybe it's just one of those things they never bother to address
S0266	but it's be happen for years hasn't it
S0268	i presume it will be
S0268	presumably it have they just need protection that's where the cable tie come in it's like such a good idea but i i think there might be something that you can put some kind of guard that you could put and lock on so it be tamper proof which would be one operation well one operation as oppose to six or seven operations
S0266	no but why you you just need to mm
S0268	that's all i'm say
S0266	you just deeper groove don't you
S0268	well that's yeah no ideally that's what they need deeper groove exactly but there might be something that you can clip on cos you you say that you can remember when you be play tennis at a high level that you use to clip something on to your racket plastic and i i can
S0266	yeah a guard but it affect it affect the play that's why
S0268	well yes but you're you're a very advance player you see so
S0266	oh yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah
S0268	well it's a very good question to ask but i will i will do that erm it's it's worth cos you've get to experiment haven't you you've get to do your research
S0266	yeah
S0268	and know that like they will stay on they won't rattle about and eh they won't after their play so i'll do that tomorrow i'll put the very light ones on i think not the these ones be smaller see these these be narrower and shorter
S0266	yeah
S0268	so they they're even better maybe
S0266	erm so yeah can you just make this machine go so that i can do a
S0268	i need to put my glass on for that
S0266	well they're erm a shave without any number
S0268	oh i see i see what you mean have you finish
S0266	no i've just get to do the back of the neck
S0268	oh right okay well that's what i mean but you can still do it look alright
S0266	it's too short and you've get a bleed ear but otherwise it's very good
S0268	oh ah otherwise it's fine yeah well that's good i'll come back to this salon in future then
S0266	sorry about that but i don't know what happen really
S0268	that's alright mm
S0266	right erm it's okay i'll just do this last bite
S0268	yeah that be a good idea to try it out first but if i can get these racket in the hand of these kid erm the next half the next half of the term i'll have a really good idea about how they work maybe i'll put different type you can actually get quite thick ones so if you have
S0266	sorry can you not move and look the other way it's like it's like look slightly to the right
S0268	oh right okay so it's possible to have thicker ones but that's quite a lot more expensive
S0266	can you look that way thank you
S0268	so
S0266	head that way but down no that's it
S0268	you can have like double double the width but it's interest obviously the the more plastic they put in the more they're go to charge you so
S0266	and the other way thank you
S0268	and the other thing be the more plastic you have at the top of the racket the erm the heavier it's go to be and erm anyway it could be it's a dragon's den type of idea but i don't think would go for it do you know he use to coach tennis that's how he start make money
S0266	who
S0268	he be a very good tennis player
S0266	oh the dragon's den man
S0268	yeah so when he be fifteen or sixteen he coach tennis for money and that's what put the entrepreneurial bug into him i think
S0266	mm
S0268	that's how he start make money he's a big tall bloke isn't he
S0266	mm
S0268	so maybe he'd go for this idea
S0266	right that complete the hairdressing don't look in the mirror cos i don't think you'll be very please
S0268	oh thank you very much what be i'm balder now
S0266	a bite
S0268	really
S0266	well you shouldn't have let it grow so long erm and then it would have be easier somehow to cut or i need to go to even class in haircutting
S0268	so what
S0266	it it be so long that it i have to cut with scissor
S0268	why don't you ask she's or she hasn't get who's get level three you go to
S0266	well you'd have you'd have you'd have to go the salon and pay twenty five quid
S0268	's get level three so
S0268	so or maybe i should go there do you think she'd do
S0266	well yeah and pay and pay twenty five quid
S0268	be that how much they charge
S0266	no you'd probably get about fifteen
S0268	but even so i can remember pay no when i be about i think two shill be about the go rate
S0266	anyway mm
S0268	and that's what ten p in today's money
S0266	mm time have change haven't they and i need i need a big tip as well ten percent
S0268	really do you do you tip when you go to
S0266	yep
S0268	do you and
S0266	yeah
S0268	well don't they build that into the price
S0266	no it's an english tradition to be a hairdresser anyway that's enough for now
S0268	well they should do ah right have they get a fleet of scissor
S0266	i don't know
S0268	there we be
S0266	right
S0268	so be you be you supportive of this idea do you think it's go to work
S0266	yeah i think you should just try it out and see how it go
S0268	well i will do
S0266	and with a new haircut you might
S0268	i'll be aerodynamic
S0266	yep
S0268	so in some ways you know that that's good because the total package mean i'm probably lighter even with the tie in the racket
S0266	yeah
S0268	but i haven't get as much hair
S0266	erm if you're approach business men in discussions they'll probably prefer the shorter hair cut
S0268	mm you reckon
S0266	maybe let's let's take the positives
S0268	well i don't i think you do it sort of you butcher me a bite
S0266	mm best not to look in the mirror
S0268	mm okay
S0266	okay i'm go to turn off the machine now
