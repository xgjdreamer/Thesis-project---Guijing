S0115	like uh in a bar whatever
S0037	i don't know i dunno why i didn't wanna do anything else like
S0115	what d'you mean you didn't wanna do anything else
S0037	like i didn't wanna just stay i suppose i dunno why i didn't wanna just stay at home on a saturday cos i go to college all it be when i be at college
S0115	yeah
S0037	go to college all week
S0115	well cos you want to have the i mean you want to have your own money didn't you
S0037	yeah that's true
S0115	you want to have your own money didn't you
S0037	yeah that's true
S0115	you want to apply things in um and that's something that i should've do more myself should have do more work myself um
S0037	well
S0115	so it be it's good to have to have people uh do work like that you know
S0037	yeah i mean
S0115	cos my cousin's um do it who's uh how old be she like eighteen or something cos she's do
S0037	who uh
S0037	ah that's what i mean and
S0115	yeah you get the name mix up mix up don't you uh
S0037	what be she do a tiny bite
S0115	she be work i think in a shop or bar and and or it's like and um
S0037	well be yeah 's a waitress now
S0115	age about eighteen i think and uh
S0037	no it's she's she be um she's go to uni this year isn't she
S0115	yeah so she's um yeah no make that money and like uh on top it be really good it's good to have that sort of that extra sort of cushion and that extra money and then can do more stuff but also yeah
S0037	yeah
S0115	if you if you're make more money then you can save it as well so you can have can save up for uni and like i know i know people who like go to you know like friends who go from america to um
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh to to london you know so they work very hard with like load of hours like two job
S0037	yeah
S0115	um
S0037	i be the opposite like
S0115	for for to collect money for the for the for uni adapt
S0037	i remember like be really look forward to like get a interest free overdraft like
S0115	yeah that's the so call pink debt isn't it um but like that's like a lot of people have get overdrafts haven't they but uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	but uh
S0037	be you alright
S0115	but a question of whether they're like in the long run cos you may end up pay a lot lot lot of interest but uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	obviously the the bank must make a profit with them otherwise they wouldn't uh otherwise they wouldn't make it so easy
S0037	well i think so cos they you keep like i suppose they keep them as customers like you know what i mean
S0115	yeah i mean that sort of thing's become more popular recently
S0037	and then like you get a mortgage with them or you you know get an isa or
S0115	yeah well the bank have have a lot of trouble recently haven't they with the whole crisis thing so they they're not they're not like everyone's favourite but uh
S0037	they have no
S0115	um
S0037	i can
S0115	no i think i
S0037	i be gonna say i can smell your sandwich that sort of smokiness i i still don't understand what
S0115	hopefully hopefully there isn't something on fire uh
S0037	i hope i haven't
S0115	yeah
S0037	no no i mean like i could
S0115	it's funny i can smell smoke and it's get hotter
S0037	no
S0037	you've leave the window open in here
S0115	i only it's only open a crack it's not like
S0037	don't open the window
S0115	it's only open a crack though innit
S0037	yeah but it's like
S0037	nineteen degrees in there
S0115	oh right no but it's twenty one in here so it's not too bad
S0037	you haven't i think you haven't haven't you haven't open the bedroom window have you
S0115	no no that's totally close
S0037	very naughty
S0115	i just like to have a bite of fresh air come in
S0037	well i know but like if it's cold
S0115	uh so now i think i think the overdraft the free overdraft
S0037	yeah
S0115	be good in some ways but in other ways um it it do cost in interest so but it it do give it sort of do give you like perhaps um you know that sort of freedom and
S0037	well
S0115	uh
S0037	yeah i mean
S0115	like
S0037	i remember i remember spend mine before i even go to uni
S0115	if if you use it properly yeah you could uh
S0037	i remember like buy stuff for uni out of my overdraft
S0115	oh right yeah
S0037	it's bad isn't it
S0115	yeah so i have the overdraft and i have uh yeah and of course you have a student loan which everyone have and also the uh there's the fee which be introduce with like i mean
S0037	i think i've get like
S0115	so there be i mean and of course they're increase that aren't they uh that's a big thing in the news isn't it that they they dramatically increase
S0037	i'll have to work out how much fee yeah
S0115	i read that i have the little german uh article from der spiegel
S0037	yeah
S0115	um talk about student fee and um
S0037	yeah
S0115	like uh um and um yeah so like uh
S0037	sorry student thing
S0115	i do they do mention like that it be in you know in german from a german perspective but they didn't mention how britain have get massively higher but it it's worse in like america america's like america's pretty pretty hardcore for fee for uni fee i think or they seem to suggest
S0037	yeah that's true actually
S0115	um i uh yeah i mean um i i i do think that that they should've maybe prevent them from go up like if they be gonna raise them to if they're gonna like take away the government contribution that's that's one thing i mean that's not that's not great but
S0037	yeah
S0115	it it's one thing but then to to allow unis to raise their price
S0037	yeah
S0115	even further like um like three thousand on top of that uh
S0037	well i think like me like me granda's point be like he be say that like he couldn't go to uni because you have to pay and then then after that you could pay like sorry then after that you didn't have to pay but like all the politicians now who be in be ones who be like they they be all the ones who have free university education it's just so rich that they like ah so like they have free education but we can't have it now
S0115	yeah well this be the sort of thing that people get you know get really um
S0037	my granda get so angry at it i mean he he be angry in itself like that even i have to pay i mean which i didn't have to pay actually but cos the my situation but
S0115	yeah neither do i because of yeah because of my my family wasn't earn as much at the time uh no i just yeah i mean i always get a bite sort of uh um i do get a bite like anti fee sometimes because i think the the the the country need basically the county's gotta spend the government's gotta spend money to to improve the to improve education in a big way
S0037	yeah yeah yeah
S0115	but a lot of that be uh be also secondary school education
S0037	well yeah that's true
S0115	which be which i think a lot of people be just go to school and just waste the opportunity
S0037	yeah
S0115	or the school aren't good enough and and that's so that's a problem but yeah i think in a better in a better country you should get like should get more should get more like opportunities for study in a better country than um
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh like the i i i just i would like to live in a country where where education be free basically and it be at uni
S0037	well uh be it free anywhere then
S0115	but but there be a lot of um sorry
S0037	be it free anywhere
S0115	um
S0037	in the world like what about in like the middle east like
S0115	you mean totally free well it use to be free here didn't it like
S0037	well yeah yes and no no it be never free free like it be never like
S0115	it be
S0037	well well yes a while ago but i don't mean like recently
S0115	it it be blair who introduce the fee wasn't it
S0037	yeah
S0115	it be free before that
S0037	yeah that's true
S0115	so if you think about it even even thatcher didn't do that
S0037	no it's pretty bad
S0115	uh so yeah they people say though don't they they're like even thatcher didn't x like that that the post office like
S0037	i can't believe she's still alive like how old be she now
S0115	hate keep a person alive uh
S0037	well i know
S0037	how old be she now
S0115	uh that's quote's from uh hate keep a man alive be from uh ben hur
S0037	ah oh
S0115	irrelevant film facts
S0037	uh we watch that on a sunday once i remember
S0115	it's a sunday film and it might just send you into a post stuff coma
S0037	it might do too many roast potatoes and a bite ben hur be
S0115	uh yeah so like um what be i say
S0037	d'you wanna a cup of tea or anything
S0115	i be gonna say i be gonna say something about fee wasn't i yeah and i but i haven't see like a full on comparison of fee across the world but i i'm pretty sure that within europe place like
S0037	what about in paris
S0115	you're gonna probably find that in scandinavia it's free
S0037	d'you think so
S0115	you're probably gonna find that it's better in many of the european countries
S0037	be it true that that in like
S0115	i'm fairly sure that it's better in german than it be in in england
S0037	be it true that in france like that you have to go to your your nearby one be it that you can go to your nearby one for free but you have to pay if you wanna go to a different one
S0115	i don't know but there's something like that in america isn't there about state like if you if you wanna go to a different state
S0037	yeah
S0115	you have to pay quite a lot more i think which be seem to be a bite bite annoy but
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh but british unis be make a lot of money from foreign fee because
S0037	well
S0115	it cost
S0037	apparently
S0115	it cost you more as a foreign student in certain place
S0037	now like fifty percent of postgrads in the uk be foreign fifty percent i mean that's a lot
S0115	well i think that's good i think it's it's an it's an export isn't it
S0037	no i don't think it's no i don't think it's a bad thing but obviously it's uh
S0115	they're bring in money to the country
S0037	yeah yeah i've be hog the sofa d'you wanna sit here for a while or
S0115	uh no i'm alright with this uh armchair i like this chair

S0037	no sarah lancaster's no that's not her
S0115	right um uh from she be from corrie wasn't she

S0115	the man be
S0037	the mam
S0115	he's he's liverpudlian i think pretty sure he be from
S0037	the mum the mum the mum be
S0115	pretty sure that the male guy be from brookside wasn't he
S0037	um

S0037	she's the drive force
S0115	and like a like like an anecdote uh

S0115	you can't i know it's a shame a shame you didn't get pay by the word isn't it
S0037	ah i should've i should've commission
S0115	i think you if you shouldn't maybe in some ways it's better to get pay by the word i suppose because then
S0037	well
S0115	but then of course you'd have to wait until like
S0037	but she doesn't talk particularly fast i don't think no faster than i do
S0115	ah it seem like
S0037	it's more like it's just a no no no it's just a very feel like a very long time cos her stories be so inane
S0115	seem like a lot of word come out well it's
S0037	it's like and then i be in morrisons and i say have you see these fishcakes and your auntie turn to us and she say i haven't
S0115	ah start to feel sleepy i feel like sleep i think i'm about to fall asleep actually

S0115	you know she's also a big fan of steven seagal as well isn't she
S0037	she love steven segal
S0115	that would be something worth talk about
S0037	i could be like nana what film have you be watch and she'd be like
S0115	she like steven segal probably like as well
S0037	i can imagine she's be like i've see that avatar i don't know what all the fuss be about
S0115	i like avatar so i don't
S0037	no but i i just like the idea that my nana watch she's not i mean she doesn't half like a bite of you know um howard keel and and a bite of doris and a bite of
S0115	he's i don't know howard keel
S0037	oh you do he's in calamity jane
S0115	um i'm really not that much of an expert in that film
S0037	so in calamity jane there's like wild bill and then there's like the captain and he's like so bill he's like a bigger like he he's get a bite of a sort of a shape like you like a he's like tall and
S0115	i don't cos i i just don't i saw i saw i saw it but it's one of them musicals that's sort of massively um anachronistic and
S0037	what d'you mean
S0115	you know it's it's anachronistic be it
S0115	no i'm just say you know it's a bite like it's it's base on something but it's very liberal with like uh the facts
S0037	ah but isn't yeah but a lot of things be i mean
S0115	uh yeah
S0037	well you should see seven brides for seven brothers have you see that
S0115	that's not that doesn't that wouldn't mean that it's a bad film
S0037	have you see seven brides for seven brothers
S0115	no oh um bits of it maybe
S0037	that's a great one
S0115	yeah i should maybe should investigate some more musicals
S0037	seven brides for seven brothers i watch that the other morning that's a sunday one so seven brides for seven brothers there's this guy and he's call like ah what's i don't know anyway he's name begin with an a
S0115	i don't think it would my like my favourite film of all time
S0037	and he live up in the mountains right and he come down to the he come down to the town like
S0115	oh yeah he seem to like mountains in this one musicals and mountains go together
S0037	it's like a wild west sort of town and he come down and he's
S0115	brokeback mountain
S0037	he's sing about how he want to find a wife and she's gotta be just right and
S0115	oh so not brokeback mountain then
S0037	he look at all the other women's in the he's sing these songs and gotta not be this and not be that
S0115	would've be funny if brokeback mountain be a musical
S0037	and then he and then he see through the window this woman and she's like she be run the like cook house like the you know the café if you like and um all these men be give her grief and she's like bat it back at them and she's get real feistiness um and so then um he decide that she's the one for her for him so
S0115	no i don't it's it's alright i'm just
S0037	be i get nana jean on ya be i do a really long story
S0115	no no it's alright i mean
S0037	so
S0037	alright then anyway i'll try and cut the story down so he end up marry her take her home
S0115	this be uh i i i'm on a comfortable chair so
S0037	take her home
S0115	yeah
S0037	then he then she realize that like she's be really romanticise the idea then go to live in the mountains la di la then she realise that he's get these other six brothers like call like bob like everything a b c d e f like you know what i mean they've all get like bible name he's like abraham like
S0115	like babraham cabraham
S0037	like you know cain daniel like
S0115	dabraham eabraham fabraham
S0037	no you know what i mean like
S0115	yeah
S0037	he's get all these brothers and then they've like get really bad manners they're like a pack of wolves and then she eventually she whip them into shape and then she tell them how to like find a woman like how to woo a lady and they go down to town and they find girls that they like and blah blah blah anyway it all take a bite of a sinister twist when they actually uh kidnap the girls and bring them back to the mountains
S0115	yeah
S0037	and cause an avalanche on the way
S0115	i think
S0037	so they're stick there for the whole summer
S0115	this be
S0037	what
S0115	sound like a pretty excite musical yeah
S0037	oh you're try to you're try to stop my story
S0115	no i'm just like
S0037	when i'm like in forty years time i'll be nana dembry and then i'll just be tell you stories
S0115	i know yeah think there's some similarities definitely
S0037	well that's my nana introduce us to that film anyway okay i'll not i'll not tell you any more detail but it's really good
S0115	no no i mean it you you be yeah you be you be talk about uh something about jean yeah
S0037	alright so boys kidnap the the girls from the village so they can't be rescue so then the original the original woman in it the main woman get really angry at the original the main guy in it cos he sort of tell them to do it encourage them
S0115	that's not very nice
S0037	so he go off to the mountains meanwhile she have a baby meanwhile the woman like first of all they hate the men who've capture them but then
S0115	yeah you would wouldn't you
S0037	but then after a while they warm to them and realise actually that they do love them then spring come the pass thaw the townsfolk come up to the the mountains to get to reclaim the women and there's like a big chase like fanciful sort of silly where they're chase around and stuff and then then they hear a baby cry and then they say whose do that belong to and then all of them say it's mine so then they all of them get marry to the brothers because it's not theirs it's the other one's
S0115	oh
S0037	you look so bore
S0115	no no no no i'm fine uh no it sound like a
S0037	aw it be good
S0115	it's a no it sound it sound good um
S0037	no it doesn't stop lie it sound stupid i tell it
S0115	oh no i like um i like i like i like west side story so
