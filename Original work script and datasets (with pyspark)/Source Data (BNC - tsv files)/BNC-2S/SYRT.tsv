S0454	perhaps they be worry you would sue
S0455	you don't know do you and the thing be she work out it wasn't actually anything wrong with me i think obviously cos you're
S0454	yes
S0455	try not to make a fuss and really it's play havoc with you that length of time
S0454	yes
S0455	so
S0454	yes not very good
S0455	so she get she say she think there be a bite leave and then it become infect so i have to take antibiotics for a while
S0455	but when she saw me the second time she say i think i would advise you not that we don't go for surgery because she say it's extremely unpleasant and she say if you're lucky the little bite of that's leave onto the gum won't bother you you know again
S0454	ah well that's good
S0455	yes and 's have the same thing just say leave it

S0454	yes my students go there
S0455	ah
S0454	and they come back say how freeze it be and i tell and he say it's not freeze
S0454	colder than here though anyway
S0455	yes well i guess it's like if here people say it's very wet in this part of that annoy me cos we're live here
S0455	and it might be true but i don't really want to hear it
S0454	no
S0454	at least you don't have to water the garden
S0455	no and i also think it's wetter in than here because
S0454	yeah it's cos of the moor
S0455	yeah because when i come back might be rain a lot there and er all you can say it's a lot less here or perhaps there hasn't be any
S0454	yeah
S0455	but then people in will tell me it's much wetter in than
S0454	mm

S0455	and you know they'd've only be plant
S0454	oh right mm
S0455	eight years say before that so it's good

S0454	ah yes it's quite a way isn't it to the market from here
S0455	yes
S0454	yes but you can see it's be well lay out
S0455	yes i think we're lucky so we could get it back
S0454	yes cos
S0455	i think it's good
S0454	it's a sensible garden how they've do it
S0455	yes
S0454	its not too many bed be it

S0455	yes yes i suppose he's try to do a garden programme with a difference
S0454	yes
S0455	to the one next week then to see whether that's contrast
S0454	yes but i mean you could find hundreds of sob stories couldn't you and do their garden
S0455	yes mm but i i've only watch one it be years ago but i'd like to see them when they do one with a garden that the size you have
S0454	yes that's useful
S0455	and how they create a haven
S0454	i don't think mine can have that many things in it though can it
S0455	no but you can make it absolutely beautiful small
S0454	yeah you could have a patio and erm you know a little seat area couldn't you
S0455	yeah yes yes you could would you like a patio
S0454	i'm not go to cos it's go to take up room
S0455	right
S0454	all they're go to do be put in one pave slab outside the you know er one pave slab wide outside the patio doors so that you don't get soil on the
S0455	oh right okay yeah
S0454	but they say you could extend it

S0455	mm
S0454	and then she be always sort of a secretary but she's very bright so it would've be bore for her
S0455	yeah and i think if you be live some people manage it successfully but i think a lot of people you just grow apart

S0454	not tea caddy the containers
S0455	container yes
S0454	for the tea
S0455	don't you call them tea caddy
S0454	tea caddy isn't that just like a tea cosy
S0455	i don't think so
S0454	oh
S0455	i think it's what you store tea in
S0454	be it oh i didn't know that
S0455	yes a tea cosy's just a tea cosy
S0454	oh
S0454	yeah it's complicate
S0455	yeah
S0454	no
S0455	lessons
S0454	no i don't normally teach that
S0455	mm yes i've get those red ones and i'm go to keep those for them but they're not actually as good as the other ones
S0454	not as big
S0455	erm i don't mind them not be as big but they chip easily there's two or three have get a chip
S0454	ah
S0455	and i haven't have them long and then the sugar one doesn't keep the sugar dry
S0454	oh that's annoy
S0455	really annoy
S0454	mm why do you change them
S0455	cos i be tire of them
S0455	i want to just brighten up the kitchen i think it be a bite dull
S0454	mm
S0455	because i in a way it could do with be bring up to date
S0454	the kitchen
S0455	yes the cupboards and the
S0454	oh i think it's okay
S0455	the yes it's okay that's why we didn't do it we
S0454	i like that oven
S0455	erm yeah i quite like it but i think we
S0454	get lot of character they'd be expensive to buy
S0455	yes they're very dear
S0454	yes
S0454	oh lovely
S0454	oh i haven't get shoe on otherwise i'd come
S0455	erm but we decide you know so it doesn't need do leave it for another ten years which be sensible cos you can go on forever can't you
S0454	yes yes it's silly
S0455	what i would like but i don't think we'll ever have it do be just to open all this up so it be all glass
S0454	ah
S0455	that'd be really nice but some things be so expensive you've get to think be it worth it
S0454	yes be it worth it
S0455	yeah
S0454	probably not
S0455	cos another thing i think of do but i don't think it's worth the expense be block off the door into the lounge to make it more private
S0454	yes
S0455	and then make the kitchen bigger which i'd quite like and open it into the din room with an archway
S0454	ah right
S0455	but i don't know how much you'd gain in the end by do all that cos
S0454	no
S0455	it's a lot you know be it worth it cos you're gonna have to lose cupboards and put them somewhere else
S0454	yes i don't think it be
S0455	and you're private in the kitchen so onto the front you wouldn't be as much would you
S0454	no
S0455	that's it you sort of could spend a few thousand to actually have not that much benefit
S0454	that's true
S0455	and there be erm plan for an erm conservatory when we come right across the back here
S0454	oh really
S0455	mm
S0454	oh it's big enough isn't it the house
S0455	well it be well yes i mean
S0454	for two people
S0455	oh yes it's big enough and you'd er spoil the lounge i think
S0454	yes
S0455	i think that be the pity because you lose the light don't you with and that's lovely that lounge
S0454	yeah so that be a shame
S0455	yes that's what i mean you spend thousands but not really any benefit that's it
S0454	no it's not like you need extra space be it downstairs
S0455	no i would
S0454	there's plenty
S0455	yeah i wouldn't mind a bigger even lighter kitchen though and
S0454	yes
S0455	really have the garden but i don't think that be worth the expense
S0454	no
S0455	have that door be a good help anyway
S0454	yes
S0455	have you see some house now where instead of have doors like this
S0454	mm
S0455	it they literally sort of roll back so the whole wall
S0454	oh right no i haven't see that
S0455	go back so you're sit outside in your lounge
S0454	yeah that's good then the problem then be insulation as well though isn't it
S0455	yes it won't be as good will it
S0454	no
S0455	no
S0454	it's never go to be as good and security
S0455	yes
S0454	i mean no one's go to break through the wall be they
S0455	no they're not
S0454	but that kind of door
S0455	yes
S0454	even if it's double glaze
S0455	yes
S0454	it's not go to be that difficult to break through
S0455	no and the thing be a lot of the time it's winter isn't it
S0454	yes it's dark anyway
S0455	well exactly and there be
S0454	there's no difference
S0455	no and there be a lot of light in that lounge isn't there
S0454	find a frog
S0454	in the compost heap
S0454	oh right well that's nice
S0454	ah yes
S0454	oh that's good
S0455	mm
S0454	might find a snake one day in there
S0455	oh yes you might
S0454	them
S0455	yes
S0454	cos they like to keep warm
S0455	well that would certain save me ten pound a year on compost but it's also
S0454	good
S0455	comment about three years ago three or four how ridiculous it be
S0454	it be madness yes it be madness
S0455	oh yes it be
S0454	but it be a bite of a nuisance to dig them out
S0455	be it
S0454	well you have to remove the top third usually to get at the compost
S0455	ah right okay
S0454	but now dad's do that
S0455	okay
S0454	and if he want to he could do the other one take the top third off and then empty
S0455	okay
S0454	empty the other one
S0455	yes
S0454	but anyway it's good he's do one
S0455	so when what year do you think we should open the garden to the public cos er each year it's a little bite better
S0454	oh yes i think the tomatoes could exhibit from next year
S0454	now you've have a trial run you know about the wind
S0455	oh right okay
S0454	yes and maybe you could go in for those competitions where you grow the biggest something
S0455	ah yes okay
S0454	biggest pumpkin
S0455	yes yes
S0454	i still think you should grow pumpkins
S0454	cos they be amaze you know they grow over a foot overnight
S0454	not the pumpkin the the thing it grow on
S0455	do they really
S0454	well more than a foot i've see them grow over a foot in a night
S0455	but if you don't like pumpkins
S0454	pumpkin soup you'd like
S0455	oh right okay
S0454	you like carrot soup don't you
S0455	yes
S0454	same sort of thing
S0454	little bite sweet
S0455	yes okay and when do you think i we should open the garden you know for the flower and and tree and things generally next year

S0454	ah that's good
S0454	be it full
S0454	oh that's good yes
S0454	yes
S0455	it'd be interest to see who would come mm advertise cream teas
S0454	yes
S0455	invitations out in the village
S0454	i think all the old women would come cos they're nosy
S0455	yeah that's it they'd come up to see what it's like oh i've never see the garden of this house
