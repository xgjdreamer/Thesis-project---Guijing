S0364	in a scottish accent
S0420	so you use so you well aye but you use twitter quite a lot don't you
S0364	yeah yeah load load
S0420	but like but be it more for like personal stuff or or or or for work or for both or what
S0364	ah personal stuff i do it a bite for work er so i tweet some some of my work account things but no mostly mostly personal news sport
S0420	be that what they say be like a primary source or d'you think
S0364	crazy stuff erm
S0420	like throughout the day
S0364	erm d'you know i'll go in and have a look at night i don't sorta look at it in the morning as much now
S0420	no
S0364	i've get
S0420	not like a breakfast thing or
S0364	in maybe weekend but during the week during the week i'll go on the bbc
S0420	yeah
S0364	the bbc news app i'll check that instead and then pick up stuff from like pick up stuff from the radio and that so it's more it's more in the in the even actually and like if there's a football game on
S0420	yeah i can never understand that how d'you follow something on twitter
S0364	erm
S0420	cos i know you've get hashtags and stuff but like how d'you follow a game or follow a a conversation
S0364	well you you well you can you can search on the hashtag so if you you search on hashtag hmfc i quite often do that actually i've get a save search on that and you'll just see anyone anything that anyone have hashtagged that and you'll see
S0420	but
S0364	so then you'll get lot of hearts stuff
S0420	i so
S0364	erm
S0420	you put something back you have to do the same hashtag
S0364	yes
S0420	in order for other people
S0364	yeah
S0420	to find it
S0364	so like during the world cup there be
S0420	so it's quite organic how it how that happen then
S0364	yeah yeah aye there be load of hashtags during the world cup that be like they have a three digit code that's it aye so like basically the three initial from each of the team
S0420	uhu
S0364	and it would just be hashtag so and so v so and so
S0420	okay
S0364	and you could basically follow the game what everyone be say so you could look at photos
S0420	and be that like in different languages as well
S0364	yeah yeah well aye yeah absolutely during the world cup yeah yeah so quite a good way of see what's go on quite often i'm on twitter there'd be game on sky that i'm not watch but you can keep track of it
S0420	but d'you not find that sometimes sometimes people just post it's like be in the middle of a cloud and people everybody shout at the same time
S0364	well kinda yeah kinda yeah yeah but it's if it's yeah yeah i've never do it when i've be at an event i've never be at a sport event and sort of do it as well but
S0420	like be it not the equivalent of like be in the middle of a crowd and everybody shout
S0364	yeah yeah yeah yeah aye i suppose if you're if there's a penalty shootout for our team that i'm close to or interest in then the just by have my network base on all the people that be interest as well it's erm it be kinda like that yeah yeah i've you know if if a team score a goal i've maybe see twelve fifteen tweet of that team have score you know
S0420	and the news the same like get get news
S0364	what's that erm yeah well you'll get lot of different sources'll have their say but of course for that like i'm only
S0420	d'you follow d'you follow like commentators or like
S0364	a few of them aye a few of them
S0420	columnists or something
S0364	a few of them a few of them yeah yeah not so much with er not so much with the news actually i more just keep it on reliable news outlets but in the sport yeah yeah some decent sport journalists like a lot of the scottish lot of the and bbc like sport journalists so
S0420	and do they do they use it to break stories as well now
S0364	yeah yeah absolutely aye aye so
S0420	like attract interest like
S0364	yeah
S0420	breadcrumbs to to that story
S0364	both both stories but then also controversial statements that they probably could put in their stories things like that
S0420	also like they can be a bite more personal about it
S0364	yeah yeah oh aye absolutely absolutely they you know so rangers get a lot of hassle they get you know they get rip into quite a lot erm by the journalists
S0420	so be it be it be it d'you think it make it a danger or a create a danger of the news become very subjective then
S0364	yeah could be but then i dunno
S0420	er yeah if yeah if people like
S0364	yeah
S0420	yourself use it as one of the primary source of get news
S0364	yeah
S0420	d'you think that that pose a danger at all
S0364	well sometimes
S0420	or or or be it even better cos it's so open
S0364	i dunno it's quite open isn't it cos well newspapers have still get a role in set the news agenda hey so this almost well twitter er no it doesn't i don't think it set the news agenda but quite often you'll see journalists use tweet in stories
S0420	yeah yeah
S0364	you so and so on you know so you will see stories that be just oh so and so and so and so have an argument on twitter and it will just be quote from that
S0420	no see i'm not i'm not a fan of
S0364	so
S0420	not a fan of that kinda stuff
S0364	mm mm but
S0420	like the the have your say section at the bottom of article
S0364	yeah yeah
S0420	and stuff or when they do a just send us your
S0364	yeah yeah
S0420	erm text in tell us what you think it's like well if i that i'd speak to one of my mat i wouldn't
S0364	mm yeah yeah
S0420	necessarily to shout out at one time
S0364	no interest aye that's a point but i mean yeah you could say that you could say that but i dunno news be subjective anyway huh i think
S0420	well it be it be but it's it's always be see to be objective
S0364	mm
S0420	whereas twitter be sort of by its very nature subjective isn't it
S0364	mm aye
S0420	well that's what they want they want sort of er personalise opinions
S0364	yeah no no absolutely well aye and there's the whole thing about like a re tweet isn't an endorsement eh cos it i would never re tweet anything dodgy
S0420	well cos it open up to
S0364	ah
S0420	to accusations doesn't it i mean
S0364	some people aye there's quite a lot people have that as a what's the word a little disclaimer
S0420	yeah
S0364	you know personal view only so a lot of bbc journalists will say not the view of my view view not those of my employer
S0420	yeah
S0364	and then also like re tweet doesn't mean an endorsement
S0420	yeah
S0364	cos it could just be try to generate a debate this be
S0420	yeah
S0364	what so this be what someone say not i agree with that
S0420	and so for work though i mean erm obviously like for an education that people raise issue and chat about things or
S0364	mm mm
S0420	maybe er we have like a group
S0364	mm mm
S0420	erm every wednesday at twelve o'clock we go on twitter
S0364	right
S0420	and we'll erm
S0364	yeah
S0420	and and and for that hour everybody'll tweet use that certain hashtag to discuss a particular topic d'you ever think anything like that in in finance or communications
S0364	oh right yeah yeah erm not in my not in my job cos it's internal but erm and i'm try to think if we've have people no we've have people on erm the guardian website do like online conversations we do it internally with staff but not on erm
S0420	all the type of all the type of webinar kind of
S0364	yeah yeah oh but i'll like do i i do a webinar just not me personally but i be a part of organise a webinar on tuesday this week yeah yeah so i do that sort of thing all the time and we do
S0420	and be that through twitter at all
S0364	no not it's all see the ones that i do be internal and therefore it would be use our own intranet but yeah we do an online conversation where it's like right this senior leader someone who's an expert on something
S0420	feel free to post and like like a q and a basically
S0364	aye yeah yeah yeah aye online q and a i quite like them we've not we've probably not do enough of them i quite like them it's a little bite different to cos the one i do earlier this week be a webinar which be good you know but it's a little bite more traditional eh someone talk through
S0420	yeah
S0364	slide take question depend what the erm content be eh
S0420	depend on the i guess on the users' or or the presenters' comfort zone in the technology as well
S0364	yeah
S0420	cos
S0420	twitter twitter's a different kind of
S0364	yeah yeah
S0420	kettle of fish in some ways
S0364	yes well you can get if you do a webinar you you're in control of the question and it's sequential eh right
S0420	yeah
S0364	question next question
S0420	and you get your presentation first and
S0364	yes
S0420	yeah
S0364	whereas yeah when we've do these online conversations it's like people have their question write in word beforehand and they just copy and paste it in
S0420	ah
S0364	you know bite three paragraph question
S0420	yeah but you've you've also get the risk of someone try to someone try to monopolise the conversation or or
S0364	yeah yeah
S0420	steer it in a certain way which
S0364	aye totally
S0420	maybe doesn't really interest everybody else
S0364	yes yes no no absolutely absolutely so no no but not not so much on twitter and i'm try to think if our if our guy have have do that we've not have any leaders do it but we've get erm social media team who be
S0420	yeah
S0364	like we've get account where customers can ask question and we will like answer them back
S0420	yeah
S0364	erm
S0420	yeah but i try use that with scottish power didn't happen
S0364	mm
S0420	that be facebook not twitter but erm scottish power say leave a message
S0364	ah right
S0364	never work
S0420	cos they haven't respond in a week
S0364	aye see that's not that's not good that's not good yeah yeah
S0420	it give you a negative impression of of them
S0364	yeah
S0420	if if they're gonna have that service
S0364	aye
S0420	then they've get
S0364	yeah
S0420	to man it or they've get to have someone
S0364	absolutely
S0420	sort it out yeah
S0364	absolutely yeah yeah we i've i've use our web chat service a few time it's pretty good
S0420	yeah
S0364	but they're the the worst thing be when you go to try and use it and get aye you know it's like oh chat to an agent and then you click on it and it doesn't work
S0420	yeah yeah
S0364	it need to be it can't just be technology for technology's sake it need to work as well as or be as convenient if not more than pick up the phone or visit a branch or
S0420	yeah just have a twitter
S0364	yeah yeah
S0420	badge on your on your website doesn't
S0364	no no absolutely not absolutely not erm so but no no i mean we you know we've get our press office have get a twitter account and i re tweet a lot of their stuff so you know there's enough bad news out there so that if we get some good news out it's good so we
S0364	have couple of things we well we introduce the first ever it's like a a way for blind people to tell what's a credit card and what's a debit card cos erm
S0364	well if if you think if you if you have a your card in your wallet and you
S0420	yeah
S0364	couldn't see it right you probably couldn't tell what be what
S0420	yeah you'd have to stick a sticker on or something
S0364	yes you'd fail so this be now in now some sort of way they've get braille on these card so you could tell which card's for what account yeah so that's something we've just manage today so there be a story that we would break you know we would refit into media traditional and we'd have a we'd also play it on twitter so like the royal national institute for blind people re tweet it
S0420	blind people okay yeah
S0364	money save expert re tweet it so get quite good coverage you know erm
S0420	maybe more so than a few like couple of column inch at the bottom of a
S0364	well yeah yeah
S0420	of an ft article or something aye
S0364	yeah yeah money save expert a hundred and seventy thousand followers
S0420	yeah so you're gonna get
S0364	it's like massive
S0420	you're gonna get some coverage
S0364	absolutely
S0420	so i guess it's get some benefit huh
S0364	yeah yeah totally
S0420	i've just find erm try to promote like i i've i've have people teach website
S0364	mm hm
S0420	through twitter but i find facebook far more effective
S0364	right for
S0420	for er
S0364	for that
S0420	for erm for promote er a page or promote a
S0364	okay
S0420	service or promote something i find twitter's good once you've get an establish base
S0364	right right
S0420	to maintain a conversation but i think facebook's better for sort of start that conversation
S0364	mm okay
S0364	see i tend to keep i keep facebook more to my like my friends and family i've try to be keep them quite distinct
S0420	yeah
S0364	my facebook be just become like my twitter with like all my football club and sport team and so i've keep it really strict like
S0420	yeah
S0364	i follow hearts on facebook but not erm maybe barcelona maybe juventus but that's about it
S0420	see i just yeah
S0364	cos i start get i start get all the update for all of them on both which be like
S0420	there's too much
S0364	gotta choose
S0420	yeah
S0364	yeah yeah yeah absolutely
S0420	well see d'you think there will come a point where people have to choose which one they spend their time on or or be people just quite happy to do it i mean i see the guy next to me at work
S0364	yeah
S0420	and he's get both page both tabs open
S0364	open
S0420	on his browser the whole time at work
S0364	you you could be right cos they're just try to they they start out differently right but they're increasingly try to do the same thing
S0420	yeah keep people in touch with
S0364	yeah erm
S0420	service and
S0364	both of them you can now put your location in there
S0364	both of them you can now add photos twitter never use to have photos
S0420	yeah
S0364	you i think twitter now you can tag people in photos never use to be able to do that cos twitter start out really basic hundred and forty character what be you do right now and it's you know there's no way it's what be you do right now
S0420	no
S0364	any more
S0420	no it's so it's discussion group doesn't it
S0364	you know i've have some good answer to question that i've pose on twitter
S0420	but then there's the whole
S0364	what do you know about this and
S0420	yeah
S0364	you know you
S0420	but then there's the whole thing with troll and fake account and
S0364	mm mm mm mm yeah but i how to prove how d'you prove an account be real you know i saw someone ask that on twitter and he have to get a photo from him on the team bus for the next game to prove that it be him
S0420	right
S0364	cos someone be like it's not really you but it presumably it be
S0420	so why why should they feel under pressure to do it why why even bother
S0364	so mm
S0420	create an account if you're gonna feel
S0364	yeah yeah it's a tricky one it's a tricky one for footballers eh i've see a lot of them come on and then leave cos they just like the troll as you say for for for all the positive stuff they get from their own fan the trolling's just insane like
S0420	you just open yourself you're just open to to abuse basically
S0364	yeah yeah yeah i mean i have
S0420	that's a sort of anonymous abuse in some ways
S0364	i've see hearts players in trouble for like go to nando's for tea you know they go out for dinner oh you get beat at the weekend you should be train you don't grudge a guy have his dinner you know but but that's
S0420	might like to might like to smile whilst he's have his dinner
S0364	no that's it yeah yeah exactly exactly
S0420	i i i
S0364	celtic player who get be it a celtic player or a rangers player i can't remember they lose a game and then he he take his kid out to the funfair or something over christmas oh it be a rangers player after they get they get by hibs and he be like say that he be away out a nice day and get in trouble and he and he be rag cos he say you know my work life and family life be
S0420	that be two different things
S0364	separate
S0420	you wouldn't you wouldn't get angry if like a a salesman lose an account and
S0364	mm
S0420	he just happen to well take his kid to the supermarket or something
S0364	exactly exactly but you know as a footballer you you're not mean to be a normal person you're mean to just go and hide for the night you know
S0420	well aye aye you're see through very different eye aren't you
S0364	absolutely
