S0417	yeah so he get the distinction
S0415	history thing but it be oh what be it call conflict in the modern age or something
S0417	oh right
S0415	all about warfare and the war cold war and that kind of craic
S0417	yeah
S0415	my god i'm only slurp tea now
S0417	long as you don't shupple shuffle
S0415	how do you get these book off the shelf on purpose
S0417	yeah cos you're quite you're just go to get if you forget about
S0415	it's insane
S0417	well i be go to talk a bite about
S0415	oh what be you go to talk about tell me what you're go to talk about
S0417	be careful of be careful of that
S0415	unseat the record device
S0417	yeah not knock it all the time and flap page too much erm anti age do you know much about it
S0415	like erm gerontology
S0417	erm i didn't know that's what it be call
S0415	yes you do you're the one that tell me oh no he didn't sorry isn't geriatrics like isn't geriatrics treat illnesses relate to oldies eh old oldies old age
S0415	oldies but isn't gerontology prevent old age
S0417	you've get something on your leg
S0415	be it still there
S0417	no no i would have think gerontology be the study of geriatrics
S0415	no
S0417	illnesses
S0415	sorry what do i say yeah geriatrics be what do i say it be
S0417	for old people geriatrics be old people
S0415	yeah but geriatrics be the study of or be treat illnesses relate to old age gerontology be the prevention of things that come out of old age
S0417	mm
S0415	so it's like stop your age
S0417	oh i i didn't know that
S0415	least that's what your that beard men say on the ted talk
S0417	oh okay yeah there seem to be a sort of a few different ways people be try to i don't know cos they cos you go on about
S0415	about what
S0415	at the end of erm erm tell me well people that have longer generally tend to think not they age slower but it's kind of like i've hear one person
S0417	you you know you don't have to do all the talk
S0415	i don't have to do all the talk
S0417	soon as oh god it would be really hard and you're like soon as i try and say something
S0415	why be you complain why be you complain you want me to talk i'm talk
S0415	like or i'll be run out of things and you'll have to take over
S0417	this be my topic though
S0415	but one thing it say like like analogies like one of those little things at the end of your shoelaces that stop them
S0417	yeah
S0415	so instead of application like eventually you're isn't a lot of age to do with imperfect copy of your cells be make
S0417	yeah
S0415	so like kind of prevent that so long as they be better look younger and all that
S0417	well eventually they run out as well don't they
S0415	that's just one thing
S0417	don't know how how long that's go to be
S0415	over to you
S0417	yeah but he be go on about that but it seem that even if we do that i think naturally only put in like five to ten years even if we erm
S0415	it help it's not
S0417	i think it be more than that actually yeah
S0415	but that guy call out seven major things we'd have to do
S0415	but as well
S0417	yeah
S0415	his whole theory be that it would be kind of edit didn't say that right but it's like so as long as you get on like first day they add five years then ten years and then they'd keep enhance those techniques till eventually they'd be add on hundreds of years and it's like
S0417	i suppose what you'd hope you'd hope though it's that the thing that get add on to your life like for example tell you you might then die of something unrelated to telomeres so you want whatever therapy
S0415	but you can always get run over by a bus
S0417	yeah i know do you think though cos i be try to imagine this be something i be also try to do imagine a world where you could live for two hundred years and what cos i think if you could live for two hundred years people would value life more but maybe i'm wrong
S0415	well
S0417	and we would be more safety conscious with more care about people
S0415	well in some ways safety conscious be surely be like i mean even if you go up to a hundred now if you want to live to a hundred then i'm go to die at twenty so
S0417	well i i really when i go to
S0415	mm
S0417	one of the things that strike me it just felt like life be cheap life be cheaper people expect to die earlier so people be take risk that be quite shock sometimes you know it's just
S0415	oh i see what you mean kind of i'll be dead soon so what do it matter
S0417	well i suppose they weren't think like that i suppose most people just want to survive and live as long as they like but there seem to be a kind of
S0415	well if you want to to coin a phrase literary predictive
S0417	mm
S0415	literary predictive kind of model like in science fiction but that's there be major recur theme in science fiction and it's often prove to be very predictive when it come to the ways societies evolve and and it drive things in science that but like a lot of them there's a couple of things like where first of all you've get to move from like a scarcity model to a post scarcity model like at the moment everyone's fight over resources and things because resources be kind of get scarce you need to get to a stage where you've get basically abundant cheap energy cos once you've abundant cheap energy then you can grow load like then you start move out of a scarcity model into a post scarcity model where everyone's attitude begin to change because the same dynamics aren't at play in the sense obviously people be still human there be still the same kind of human characteristics but in term of geopolitically like
S0417	mm
S0415	if you didn't if everybody could have as much food and energy as they want as much stuff as they have well then you wouldn't have to fight over those things
S0417	yeah
S0415	and then you could like you know devote your time to more purer pursuits and but that's you know but yeah i've always want since i be very very young i want to live forever and people people would go why do you want to live forever that's just nut i be surprise cos i think everyone want to live forever but it's like nearly hardly anyone i talk to go no like sorry hardly everyone nearly everyone i talk to go no i've never come across somebody who's yeah i want to live forever too
S0417	mm
S0415	so i'm kind of go what the fuck alright for me it's just like it's like when you read about history and you read about all the amaze things that have happen over the last ten thousand years i mean can you imagine be a spectator at all of that
S0417	mm mm yeah
S0415	and like and then if you look at what's go to happen in the next ten thousand years and what you might see and experience
S0417	yeah
S0415	on the other side if you're the only one who's live forever then everyone around you be die or pass away and there's a lot of that's why kind of you need a that's why it become very difficult unless you have a everyone else live for a long time but then in another science fiction you've get or if you live so much people get bore and they just kind of want to go out they kind of they go into virtual worlds and hibernation or whatever wake me in ten thousand or wake me in a hundred wake me in five thousand years and if it get excite kind of
S0417	mm
S0415	but i think it would be amaze brilliant just think who the hell wouldn't want to live forever you're just nut if you don't want to live forever
S0417	yeah
S0415	maybe not forever forever but at least an awful long time
S0417	yeah well i suppose if these technologies be around to let other people live longer than at first they wouldn't be available to everyone would they suppose depend who make them
S0415	no there'd probably be eh kind of for the rich would be live forever but when you think of it like well what's the statistics about like whatever you know something like this be not exactly the one percent of the world own ninety nine percent of the wealth kind of thing
S0417	yeah
S0415	the world be already pretty fuck up like that
S0417	so you know some people think that telomere be might be the key to age in cancer erm
S0415	in what way
S0417	stop the process by which cells so especially cancer cells lengthen their telomeres erm
S0415	what do you mean by shorten them and make them go away be it cancer
S0417	cancer cells when they replicate very prolifically erm oh yeah and then if yep so if their if their so if their their ability to hold on to their telomeres be disruptive to the cancer cells then you can only ever grow so long so they just won't be able to grow it and like they grow at real really fast rat
S0415	isn't that dangerous cos you could accidentally do it to the rest of the the erm the cells in your body there's something in this diagram here that i remember read before oh yeah apparently in a thousand years from now most word currently speak will be extinct
S0417	most word
S0415	yeah due to the rapid evolution of language no single present day word will have survive a thousand years' time
S0417	but we're speak word that have be use two thousand years ago
S0415	no we're not they're all different slightly if you look at look into like google and say define word like frippery there be frepe and all french that turn into frippery and then fripper they're constantly evolve and change a lot of them be have origins of old word but
S0417	mm so they might be they might be able to understand it or would we be able to understand it but it just would be
S0415	don't know do you ever watch that movie cloud atlas
S0417	yeah
S0415	do you know they all speak in a funny kind of
S0417	that be quite isn't that by that fella he live here
S0415	i don't know but do you know
S0417	i reckon he's tach he's tax dodge
S0415	what
S0417	why would he go to live in
S0415	why would he live in the wonderful country you're currently live in be it
S0417	yeah
S0415	with with the people who be from that country that you're now just suddenly trash
S0417	well i
S0415	smart move there
S0417	yeah but why would he move here
S0415	why would who move here
S0417	the fella whatever his name be
S0415	what many people really like this country it can be a bite bore but it's just for like celebrities love this country cos lot of house like sarah jessica parker have a house up in and nobody bother her
S0417	mm
S0415	herself and matthew whatever his name be they just come over and people go how's it go and that's it like you know
S0417	mm
S0415	don't tell but that's an unusual example but there be load of celebrities who've put house like tuck away in and west of ireland and and that stuff but like the tax exemption thing too now but that's only up to forty grand or something a year per person no
S0417	be it
S0415	remember we look that up i be look for artist exemption for my amaze tax avoidance scheme
S0417	oh right oh maybe you look it up then
S0415	but
S0417	where we be both go to be painters
S0415	mm
S0417	still good
S0415	it's yeah it's amazingly incredible erm legal
S0415	spin
S0417	with horse horse and write
S0415	what
S0417	no i'm
S0415	it's it's work well it's it's any kind of work like it can be sculpture oh
S0417	be horse it's race
S0415	i know but that's that's you see charlie haughey make the entire industry tax free they didn't even have to submit a tax return state what they be earn right
S0417	really
S0415	so it be like just mint it right and but now now it's still that way but i think they actually have to submit tax return but it's still fuck ridiculous one section of the thing get off of the population get off tax free
S0417	so what else do they say in like a thousand years be that to show us in the future
S0415	ah this be a timeline of our future ah erm in two thousand years greenland ice melt ice sheet completely melt with extreme global warm cause it to sea level six metres high now
S0417	so will it mean
S0415	you know that comet hale bopp that be around in nineteen ninety seven
S0417	yeah
S0415	that's not come back for another two thousand years
S0417	mm
S0415	two thousand three hundred so if you miss that tough
S0415	like mm say here in a thousand years from now twenty nine percent of twentieth century carbon dioxide will still be there thirty percent
S0417	oh right
S0415	here's one that's in ten thousand years' time the earth's axis will have reverse summer and winter months reverse northern hemisphere suffer more extreme weather due to high percentage of
S0417	mm
S0415	eighteen thousand eight hundred and sixty years from now the lunar islamic calendar and the solar gregorian calendar will share the same year eighteen thousand years
S0417	i wonder what it would be like actually do you think any of our will actually remember us or even bother to find out about us
S0415	yeah because we can put all videos on youtube which be go to be archive and catalogue forever more
S0417	but do you think they'd bother
S0415	not every single one of them but i think it will become more culturally interest to there'll be video archive of all your ancestors and families go back that's why in some ways social media be very important in a sense if you want to preserve something for your descendants
S0417	yeah but the only video the only video of me be one do the irish game over the hurdle and fall on my face
S0415	well that doesn't even have a name on it so they won't know but my point be that's why in some ways it's a really good thing and not a narcissistic thing to put stuff up on social media of yourself and your family especially video cos imagine if you're ten thousand years from now or even a hundred years from now or two hundred years from now and you're look back and go oh my god that's my great great great great great great look at her there talk and like i mean imagine if you could do that for people who be five hundred years ago now like be go wow that's amaze look what they're wear
S0417	yeah
S0415	like
S0417	but i suppose it wouldn't be amaze to them cos they'd be use to it use to be able to see it as for us it would be amaze
S0415	no the concept wouldn't be amaze but i still think actually see for the first time cos you're not gonna wake up and be a baby and then see all your ancestors go back like a thousand years in one day or anything
S0417	mm mm
S0417	be weird to sort of see like you could probably see your great great great great great great great what if you look exactly like one of them
S0415	mm
S0417	though you'd have a you'd have a lot to choose from though that thing go back in family tree
S0415	yeah you would
S0417	if you go through your direct line even
S0415	just be excite
S0417	mm at least they'll be reduce road accidents
S0415	mm half a million years' time they'll into these reactors to show five hundred thousand years woah
S0415	take a million years for glass to decompose
S0417	really
S0415	i suppose it's photodegradable be it be glass photodegradable or be that plastic probably glass as well sorry it would have finally dissolve
S0417	oh dissolve yeah cos it will just get into fine piece dust glass dust
S0415	i don't know how true this be but it say in five million years' time the y chromosome will have weaken to the point of crumble make men impossible don't know what the hell that be but
S0417	five million years
S0415	yeah i don't really have to worry about it
S0417	that's basically just because it's it be a kind of anomaly in the first place isn't it
S0415	mm
S0417	the y chromosome
S0415	be it
S0417	yeah it be suppose to be x x and then something happen like an anomaly and that's what make men women be here first
S0415	in fifteen million years the mediterranean will have vanish
S0417	something mm
S0415	in fifteen million years the mediterranean will have vanish africa will collide with eurasia
S0417	it's still quite a long time for it to collide
S0415	mm mm
S0417	but then won't the water have rise anyway though so much bigger maybe italy will disappear
S0415	don't know
S0417	global warm
S0415	say what
S0417	do you know
S0415	no i didn't
S0417	do you know about telomeres
S0415	maybe i do
S0417	but erm do you think they just get shorter through age
S0415	i think it be sorry be this a like a question or a quiz
S0417	yeah it's a question not a quiz
S0415	do they not get shorter the more time you replicate it
S0417	yeah but erm people seem to be bear with different
S0415	lengths
S0417	lengths
S0415	yeah
S0417	erm i think newborns have eight thousand base pair and about three thousand base pair in adults
S0415	mm mm
S0417	and only fifteen hundred in elderly people
S0415	right
S0417	but erm this person erm i think she be erm criticise for it she i think she win a no quite a lot of award for her work scientific work but she she look into how stress affect telomere
S0415	mm mm
S0417	and erm she look at chronically ill children erm and their their mother mother who have chronically ill children
S0415	yeah
S0417	compare to the mother who didn't erm and the more stress they be there be more people who have chronically ill children erm and erm their telomeres become shorter lifetime than you would have expect
S0415	god it's just so
S0417	so and then it say that and they say when i i don't know quite how long it take or how bad it the worst stress it be an extra decade on their life off their life
S0415	god
S0417	mm
S0415	so if you're stress me i should just say get out of my face
S0417	yeah i be think the other way round actually
S0415	or i'll die the the other way round well vice versa it's suppose to be
S0417	mm mm god
S0415	actually you know erm here so like this be go to be hard to describe mm
S0417	what be you talk about
S0415	it's too much like kind of data and information
S0417	what be that thing about live longer though that look interest
S0415	things that affect live longer life quit smoke and things like that
S0417	mm god
S0415	oh my god these be like common common misconceptions
S0417	oh okay
S0415	do you see what i do there
S0417	go in to
S0415	no miss conceptions
S0417	be that suppose to be funny
S0415	i don't know i think it be funny anyway it's vikings' horn helmets vikings' horn helmets never actually exist create by a costume designer in the nineteenth century in the wagner opera
S0417	you go ahead you go ahead and laugh
S0417	it's funny cos
S0415	completely make up
S0417	do they erm do they have viking helmets in viking years
S0415	nope
S0417	be it try to be authentic do you think apart from all the naked naked amaze people
S0415	i would imagine it be i would imagine it be try to be authentic as any show would try what do you mean naked people authentic
S0417	naked lady just take a very hot bath
S0415	take what
S0417	in the sea last time
S0415	sea that be a symbolic thing where she be
S0417	yeah right
S0415	wait a minute
S0417	i didn't think didn't think
S0415	it be the philosophy that's that's my point in term of the story she participate slave so it be a symbolic thing where she go into the lake a slave and come out a free woman and change her clothe
S0417	yeah that's what
S0415	the fact that she be you know bitchingly hot and sexy
S0417	amaze good body yeah
S0415	just completely incidental to be honest
S0415	oh medieval chastity belt be not anti adultery devices
S0417	they weren't what
S0415	the medieval chastity belt they weren't prevent adultery they be actually invent by british people to prevent kind of what do they call it dangerous masturbation
S0415	there you go
S0417	bite weird really
S0415	do you know shark get skin cancer
S0417	shark
S0415	yeah
S0417	no
S0415	they do
S0417	like so much that they die i mean bad skin cancer
S0415	they get do this mean that shark don't get cancer they do particularly skin cancer
S0417	mm
S0415	so yeah
S0417	you know if you listen to this back you'd be talk a like about analyse or if they be analyse male to female kind of you'd be totally dominant the whole time for like ninety percent talk
S0415	yeah
S0417	and when and when i when i talk they're usually probably it's that wouldn't guide the conversation sometimes and not even be respond to
S0415	yeah what's that
S0417	very funny
S0415	what be you say
S0417	not really very funny at all
S0417	yeah it change depend on where i sit
S0415	yeah it's it's kind of like
S0417	be it the be it the leave ear this time
S0415	it's it's kind of what be it
S0417	it's usually the right ear
S0415	so hang on i'll coin it well it's psycho selective aural disruption
S0415	peace out
S0417	so you could say it in poncy ways be it
S0415	mm
S0417	incredible what do you think the life expectancy be like i don't know erm in classical greece
S0415	in classical greece for who
S0417	erm for everybody
S0415	er be i go to be shock or kind of be it or could it be something i expect
S0417	just have a guess
S0415	forty eight
S0417	twenty eight
S0415	fuck
S0417	see the trouble be this almost all of these take into account infant mortality
S0415	oh i see so there be tonnes of
S0417	it skewer load
S0415	so basically if there's a high a very high mortality a skew of the figure
S0417	yeah
S0415	but so then like the average people the average age of people who didn't die before five say be probably like fifty
S0417	mm mm yeah
S0415	or sixty or something
S0417	yeah should be like after the first like couple of years
S0415	i see
S0417	mm god i didn't realise like the palaeolithic time be say thirty three but that at age fifteen life expectancy be an additional thirty nine so it's like fifty five
S0415	i see
S0417	i would have think some palaeolithic people live longer i can't quite get my head around them be jump up that much
S0415	what really what about better medicine nutrition shelter less war less
S0417	yeah but i would have think some palaeolithic people might have good shelter and enough to eat
S0415	that's why it's inept it's not it's not a
S0417	mm i see well they say for example they say they look at english aristocracy for example back in medieval britain the life expectancy then guess what
S0415	for the aristocracy
S0417	no for general and then for the aristocracy
S0415	include mortality rate
S0417	erm at birth yes it would
S0415	forty two
S0417	thirty
S0415	fuck
S0417	that's that's really low for medieval time isn't it
S0415	yeah but it's still probably yeah infant mortality
S0417	but if you if you be like if you'd survive till age twenty and you be a member of the aristocracy and you be a man
S0415	mm and you be a man
S0417	yeah you could expect
S0415	cos basically have children kill you
S0417	i don't know i suppose the figure they get would have be but erm er yeah maybe as well erm from twelve hundred to thirteen hundred just sixty four years
S0417	and thirteen hundred to fourteen hundred forty five cos the bubonic plague
S0415	i see
S0417	and then from then time on like around seventy so for age blokes have be live till seventy if you're you know but we've add on quite a lot of extra but you would have think the aristocracy could have have load even more than us maybe it's medical care that they really lack
S0415	in the present
S0417	i mean they have load of food and servants and warmer house and things didn't they but maybe they just didn't have good medical care
S0415	mm
S0417	i wonder what it be what it be then and what's the where do you live longest which country do you reckon in the world
S0415	japan
S0417	yeah and which
S0415	nail it
S0417	like load of countries in africa it's at forty five fifty thirty five whatever i forget it's pretty low
S0415	oh yeah
S0417	i suppose it take into account infant mortality the lancet say that japanese life expectancy be due to
S0415	the what the lancet
S0417	the lancet
S0415	as oppose to the lancet
S0417	i be say i be
S0415	you're in ireland you don't have to be posh like
S0417	i i be actually make a joke
S0415	oh i see i see that be lose to me
S0417	yes erm japanese life expectancy due to
S0415	fish
S0417	diet and public health and
S0415	take care of the elderly
S0417	equal opportunities
S0415	in japan
S0417	yeah
S0415	they treat women like shit traditionally in japan in workplaces and things allegedly
S0417	do they
S0415	yeah apparently
S0417	oh well the lancet say equal opportunities
S0415	but it's their diet really lack red meat in a big way
S0417	have load of fish and that kind of thing
S0415	god look at all the sugar sucrose lactose fructose glucose
S0417	you know the oldest confirm report age of a human be
S0415	a hundred and twenty one
S0417	very close a hundred and twenty two
S0415	ah god imagine like if i be on some quiz
S0417	that's very close
S0415	like for a million euros
S0417	yeah yeah
S0415	and i be ah be like that be of some woman be she french
S0417	yeah i think so jeanne calment
S0415	calment the rubbish in my head
S0417	yeah
S0415	do you know this thing about diuretics apparently the diuretic effect of caffeine be offset by the amount of water in the caffeinated drink
S0417	what no erm
S0415	sorry i didn't mean to
S0417	yeah
S0415	yeah it doesn't say in the bible that satan rule hell stun silence
S0417	well i suppose if he be a fall angel do he set up hell or do he just go there i can't remember
S0415	but i don't know enough about the bible but i do believe
S0417	you're a catholic
S0415	i do believe that
S0417	so be i
S0415	yeah so
S0415	withdraw that accusation cos it have no relevance but i do believe that
S0417	you go to church more than me
S0415	be the seraphim angels
S0417	but he be an angel wasn't he satan
S0415	no seraphim s e r a p h i m the seraphim
S0417	mm i've no idea
S0415	they're maybe they're all angels but i just think the fall angels be the basically who live in hell continue didn't they rise up against god
S0417	yeah well at least if eh the the angels fell down go to hell or form it
S0415	mm mm
S0417	i don't know but i suppose it's probably always be there or be it not be it the garden of eden but then adam and eve just i don't i'm confuse now cos adam and eve
S0415	angels be not human
S0417	i know but adam and eve there be be a bite like they be say that everything be lovely and abundant until eve eat the apple that's when all the rot start
S0415	but what's that get to do with satan and the seraphim and all that
S0417	yeah i be i be wonder what it have to do with that cos it's like a thing over hell
S0415	oh i see i think it could be something the seraphim well you know maybe seraphim be fall maybe they're not the demons they're what be they not fall angels who want to save humanity against god's wish or something
S0417	mm
S0415	or when they be cast out down to walk the earth forever i could be mix up a whole load of crap probably in fairness

S0415	mm mm
S0417	but unfortunately he die erm i bet he's i bet he's get to get his brain his head freeze
S0415	see yeah er well i still believe maybe some kind of amber resonance put the whole lot in there see if you freeze things you get this crystallisation process in the in in the kind of liquids of things and the thread to cell membranes
S0417	oh science fiction
S0415	so like then you'd nanites as well to replair repair all that shit as well as defrost and things but
S0417	mm
S0415	that's why i'm more go maybe for just some kind of quick do you know what's the thing they do in food where flash freeze but you can't have freeze just say
S0417	yeah
S0415	just have to be kind of hermetic be that a thing
S0417	he spend twenty million dollars try to clone a dog call missy
S0415	mm

S0417	god the project be call missy missy
S0415	erm okay but what be he try to do what be in it for him

S0415	percentage of the world's oceans that have be explore
S0417	two percent
S0415	no but in the right kind of vibe
S0417	they're huge aren't they
S0415	five percent
S0417	in the middle of the oceans they be just so deep and every big mountain range be
S0415	er yes
S0417	the plat move apart and all the bubble volcanic activity have make a huge amount of
S0415	basically all continents be surely just big mountains pop out of the water
S0417	yeah but in between them you know like in like in the middle of the african america
S0415	yeah
S0417	they're move apart all the time
S0415	oh right
S0417	do it matter so where do where do you want to go for a one night's break with me
S0415	one night
S0417	could be two could be really really
S0415	play my card right erm i don't know
S0417	you don't like go away at all do you
S0415	it's not that i don't like go away it's just i'm the worst person in the world in that sense like leave to my own devices i'd quite happily go on holiday and just kind of work on project and things that i like
S0417	you're autistic
S0415	cos the
S0417	do you have holiday in your head
S0415	no no just not see i don't subscribe to this it's not the actually go to exotic place can be very interest and kind of erm what other word with inish inish enjoyable but like i think i don't subscribe to this sole view that like people be obsess okay go on holiday oh we have we have to go away we have to go somewhere and look it so there's a guy at work now he's go on holiday with two young children only one and three for two weeks down in okay that's fine you know it's but like it'll be hard work and it would be very but for me like this there's more to to go on take holiday or vacation should be about more to do with do things that you like to do that you you don't get time to do when you work and not necessarily just travel to somewhere different cos it should be about enjoy the time that you have to do the things that you like not this kind of mad arm race we must go somewhere let's go oh i haven't be there yet like you know no no
S0417	if you if you weren't work would you be interest in go to other place just anyway
S0415	if i be independently wealthy and kind of have all the time in the world then yeah i'd spend a portion of that time go to other place because they could be very interest but as well i'm also
S0417	say if you retire would you would you go away every now and again
S0415	lot it would depend how much money i have
S0417	yeah
S0415	but but as well like i think some people be a bite mad i mean like mad too like in the sense that we talk about risk earlier on like
S0417	yeah
S0415	a lot of part of the world be extremely dangerous to be honest like you know
S0417	yeah
S0415	most part it's like you know the fact that
S0417	but you usually love take risk
S0415	the fact that the
S0417	you you drive fast
S0415	i don't drive fast you're you're the worst you're just you're scar get into a car you're you can be a judge of someone drive fast or not when like you know you're terrify of be in a car
S0417	i know but you generally like take risk
S0415	i wouldn't agree with it but like i when i'm drive i don't take risk
S0417	yeah
S0415	when i'm on that motorway there i would go a hundred and twenty kilometres an hour which be the speed limit and not feel that that's fast cos all the other traffic be go and it's kind of build for that kind of thing but like there be drivers drivers take risk or do crazy things like they try to overtake
S0417	yeah
S0415	in crazy situations
S0417	no i know you don't i know you don't
S0415	i'll never do anything like that like i want to live in that sense like but but anyway
S0417	but you you take the mick out of me sometimes for not take risk so
S0415	ah yeah but you you have to wait for a green man to cross the road and that's kind of
S0417	what's the what's the problem with wait for the green man
S0415	because cos no but but our our our like
S0417	but we pay but we pay for this safe system
S0415	come back to your to your to your to your erstwhile imminent friend doctor or whatever his name be
S0417	i i do cross the road without a green man
S0415	like
S0415	that's what i say well i say but close enough
S0417	mm yeah
S0415	like if he be measure it in morts i'm sure he'd be go actually you know what cross the road without the light be green be like you know little or no extra risk
S0417	actually say he doesn't erm yeah he doesn't take huge amount of car journey cos car journey be up there
S0415	we're talk about cross the road
S0417	with the risk i'm not that bad cross the road i manage to cross roads that i there be no roads i don't manage to cross
S0415	i just think like i just think like as an average barometer of whether someone be risky or not you're the wrong judge i think because you tend to be very risk averse
S0417	mm okay i don't but but yeah no i be just anyway back to the
S0415	back to the holiday
S0417	yeah before you start beat me with the risk risk whatever it be
S0415	i think you i think you'll find you start it by accuse me of be a very risky driver to which i take great umbrage to
S0417	no i don't say you're a very risky driver but you do
S0415	drive fast
S0417	you do drive fast you
S0415	on a motorway
S0417	you you like be a a well like in the trampoline you're you you do you're you like jump high
S0415	yeah yeah yeah okay but
S0417	you like run fast
S0415	but i think you're like i would never in the trampoline consider do a flip or anything like that
S0417	yeah i know no i know that
S0415	like
S0417	i'm not i'm not actually be very critical
S0415	i know but but i think that there's a nuance to it in the sense no i know you're not be critical
S0417	yeah
S0415	but there's a nuance that okay i just use the trampoline for bounce in a very straightforward way i've try to bounce as high as i want but i don't use it for do flip or anything ridiculous like like
S0417	no
S0415	i think ah i i'll do things within the confine of the regulations of
S0417	mm
S0415	like you know i like go on roller coasters
S0417	yeah
S0415	there's a sense that because usually they're very well
S0417	usually apart from yesterday
S0415	but eh but that's one of the few accidents you've ever hear of like
S0417	i know
S0415	give me like they usually the big ones usually very good safety regimes very well design
S0417	yeah i would have think alton tower be probably better than the piers
S0415	and i still can't figure out how fecking you can have a crash on a roller coaster when there's only one set of cars go at a time
S0417	well see maybe they be like they release a second set say by accident
S0415	yeah but then safety feature build in that kind of
S0417	at the wrong time
S0415	within proximity things and all kinds of stuff
S0417	yeah
S0415	that's why but anyway back to the holiday thing you see i i'm like at odds with the vast majority of people
S0417	but you're
S0415	where they like for me for me a holiday in invert quote right or be like
S0417	mm
S0415	time off to do whatever the fuck i like that's a holiday right now i think it possibly in the strictest sense of the word a vacation or something like that's another word do mean actually travel
S0417	mm
S0415	or some but that's different the like i don't if holiday mean actually the the original word but like so it's i like
S0417	but we get like a night or two with me
S0415	but that's different that's not that's the but that's take time apart
S0417	and that's there that's apart from our our other holiday
S0415	that's take time out for ourselves that's not say that's kind of different in a way to a holiday in my mind like you know what i mean
S0417	mm
S0415	like in no can be there can be both my point be like they're not necessarily erm have to be
S0417	you're not go to be miserable be you you will enjoy it you will enjoy it
S0415	erm
S0417	oh
S0415	do i generally tend to be miserable if we're away
S0417	sometimes you can sometimes you can be
S0415	careful now careful less than enthusiastic
S0417	yeah
S0415	see i think that reflect as well though i mean you're an you've kind of always be an avid explorer and traveller like and you really really enjoy it i'm probably i could probably look i love history and things like that and i but i could probably take it or leave it it's no reflection on you it's more a reflection on
S0417	yeah but even if we're say do things like eat lunch that kind of thing isn't it just nice do that with me anyway wherever we be
S0415	do you remember that dara o briain thing where he'd go no actually that be more i'm more it's a trap like eh obviously it's go anywhere with you be a splendid what's the word eh
S0417	opportunity just to
S0415	not opportunity splendid kind of splendid
S0417	you can't even think of the word
S0415	no there's a particular kind of it's just a splendid thing in itself
S0417	you know
S0415	it's kind of erm
S0417	there be one you could i be there be some place you could go where you say you can do kayak as well that kind of thing
S0415	eh see this be what i'm say about you you're very conscientious about what other people want to do
S0415	yeah
S0417	like
S0415	of course cos i want you to enjoy yourself too
S0415	yeah but but you see strange kind of like like no no and and that's actually sweet like there's nothing wrong with that but i mean it's
S0417	mm
S0415	kind of eh erm it's in some ways it's like no i wouldn't normally worry about that kind of thing if i want to go kayak then it's up to me to go kayak in my own time when i want and it shouldn't be down to you to fuck wrap it into your holiday just cos like just cos i'm too lazy to get off my own ass and do it like
S0417	it's more like i know you're not always the easiest to kind of feel like you've be if i know that you're do one thing that you'll like it kind of make me feel better it do actually help me as long as you go go along with it feel alright about it
S0415	mm yeah see i don't really i just think people overthink all these things
S0417	but i know that before say if i've go away then erm i find it a bite of a burden in the end know that there's not a lot of things we're do that you really like
S0415	so you've go away or we've go away
S0417	we've go away together and then in the end i quite like be able to do one or two things that i know you like cos it actually just make me feel a bite better
S0415	mm
S0417	otherwise i feel overburden so you could just do it for me
S0415	so
S0417	to just help me enjoy myself
S0415	like hang on so to make you not feel guilty you do things that i enjoy but i can just do them to make you happy
S0417	yeah
S0415	ah doesn't isn't it essentially contradictory
S0417	it's just
S0415	i want you to enjoy yourself but i want you to do it to keep me happy
S0417	yeah because you no no i don't use it and then i just and then i do end up feel overburden and then it do take out my enjoyment if it put in a kind of clearer way
S0415	yeah but maybe this be the core of my point about things and it's not necessarily a very think out point or something that i will go to war to defend right but this blend of different objectives which again isn't necessarily a bad thing right but like it's kind of like okay take the holiday and spend time together and do activities like yeah it's amaze if you can blend all those three things together but like sometimes need it for yourself no not for yourself like like i think sometimes people put themselves under too much pressure to try and get them all together rather than kind of go allocate different time to those different kind of activities it's like oh my god
S0417	mm
S0415	it's like now when people get marry no we have to have the best wed ever we get to have this we get to have that we get to do this funky crazy dance that everyone think be cool
S0417	yeah mm
S0415	like you know rather than just now i'm not say that can't be amaze and brilliant at a wed
S0417	yeah no i know what you mean
S0415	but like i suppose my key point
S0417	your key point you're so funny sometimes
S0415	my key point really be that i think people be very different to each other often i don't mean the couple necessarily i just mean in general and sometimes it can be easier to just understand and work with the differences rather than try to make them rather than try to get rid of the differences try to say
S0417	i suppose it depend on it like so if you be never go to go away together then i don't just end up go away with other people all the time and in the end it would just actually it would kind of cause problems so i think there be some things that would
S0415	cos you'd be off shag around the world be it
S0415	okay but let me rephrase that so okay but what if we okay but okay but here's my point but and again i'm not actually trite about you say that i'm more go
S0417	mm
S0415	if we never go away travel together and you always have to do it yourself and we never have time where we go off and just have some nice time with each other
S0417	yeah
S0415	like what i'm try to say really be that if you have plenty of time where we go off and do something nice with each other but we didn't travel together possibly that and i don't mean you i'm just this be just an example
S0417	mm
S0415	possibly then that would be fine but it's where you've get the absence of both where it become problematic
S0417	yeah
S0415	do that make sense
S0417	oh yeah i mean i don't think
S0415	whereas obviously if you can do them all together that's even better still but
S0417	yeah i mean i suppose if we be one of the couple right which a lot of people be where they they they feel like they have to do everything together and they don't do anything apart then probably wouldn't be here now would we because there's plenty of things that we we do independently you know we're relatively kind of independent like that probably more unusually than most cubbies be couple aren't actually as as independent so
S0415	yes so what you're say be basically we're just a bad fit for each other
S0415	that's the nub of your point then be it
S0417	erm well we could go down that road if you really want to oh you're flap page load
S0415	apparently the average global life expectancy in nineteen hundred be thirty one and in two thousand and eleven it's seventy that's shockingly alarmingly progressive
S0417	yeah that
S0415	be basically slowly run then it's kind of if it's that kind of curve that would tie into the whole extend life and gerontology thing this be how i bring this conversation from where it start all the way back
S0417	no no because yeah but you'd already be like fifty five or something to seventy five really
S0415	but my point be the curve be accelerate
S0417	erm yeah but not as much as you'd think because the infant mortality be lot of baby be stillborn
S0415	oh you're say that's skew the figure
S0417	yeah
S0415	say now we've get a very low infant mortality but yeah
S0417	i mean women be have like eight children and expect you know a couple of those to die in their early years which be kind of
S0415	so we're actually not live longer it's just that
S0417	we be live longer
S0415	yeah we be live but to the extent that the figure say it's more that more all the baby be survive
S0417	yeah
S0415	that's what the
S0417	i mean it's amaze
S0415	i let you win that point
S0417	but it's amaze isn't it i mean like erm baby bear a few months earlier be even survive now but the sort of the
S0415	mm mm
S0417	they're increase the infant sort of expectation of survival as baby expectation of that that's like that's probably go off the curve isn't it so accelerate a lot
S0415	god four and a half million years ago the earth's temperature exceed the melt point of iron which be why all the iron turn into liquid flow to the centre of the planet heat into lighter elements such as and then form a sort of mantle crust
S0417	i know it's a very hot volatile place isn't it now i think we should get erm assess
S0415	assess
S0417	yeah not as in kind of you know hello and who be you and
S0415	assess for what
S0417	i don't know
S0415	assess under what criteria
S0417	i suppose there's a few things we could either i've rise away like if if there be endless money and load of time we'd be hear his speech and erm like his little autistic tendencies but they're all
S0415	cut to the chase and have you research this and do you know what the options be already cos usually you have and you do
S0417	yeah i have some it's just i mean
S0415	okay and if you be to
S0417	i don't really know which one
S0415	okay but probably you've probably narrow it down to three into part and fuck ridiculous research behind it so of those three how much would they roughly cost and where would they be
S0417	erm
S0415	cos i know you know i just know you know
S0417	you you know that that you use for last time how much they cos i look at them and they didn't seem to have that whole
S0415	mm
S0417	well they have some list of test they didn't actually have a speech kind of testers place maybe assessments so i don't know how much it will be
S0415	sure it's like use to work as an ot she use to work down in
S0417	yeah
S0415	she she say to me one day they be better like she be better but then she would
S0417	what the ones in be better
S0415	yeah but i i don't know anything about it
S0417	be they be there one in the city as well
S0415	be there
S0417	i don't know they do a erm like a autism test for two hundred and fifty euros but it's just it's not really erm it's just a
S0415	do you get a cert say autistic not autistic
S0417	no i know you don't you
S0415	or do you slot it on a spectrum
S0417	it's more of a kid of a erm a parameter i don't know
S0415	but be there like
S0417	it's not a diagnostic test see i don't know about his hear but there could be something in his hear i mean i i don't really think there's huge problems with him really
S0415	no but he need to talk within the next months in a big way or then we'll kind of be worry
S0417	i just think this i think he will i think his speech be delay and well i don't know whether
S0415	you should try that you be look for icons the noun project dot com
S0417	mm oh i actually do find load of icons free on the web but
S0415	but anyway
S0417	well i do know i mean i suppose there's two things of think we could just wait and in in all i think i think if we wait and do nothing i think he'd be kind of alright but then if there's a possibility he's get something mild then we might be able to help him a bite more i don't know
S0415	mm mm
S0417	cos it's only it's so hard so hard to say isn't it
S0415	sorry how much do she say do she say how much it cost
S0417	it's two hundred and fifty euros for the test
S0415	you don't get a free kind of consultation where you're in for ten minutes cos they think
S0417	yeah i see yeah yeah
S0415	do you usually get refer
S0417	and see if i go to the doctor again i think it would be too i don't know if
S0415	the doctor's clueless
S0417	the doctor and you know those nurse or whatever they completely they haven't even get back to me to do his two years' assessment even though i've ask twice
S0415	mm mm
S0417	and and they be i don't really have load of faith in but i mean that's another
S0415	that's another hour's conversation
S0417	that's another yeah that's another avenue you could go down say look i think his speech be delay blah blah blah and they might refer us to somebody and then like erm
S0415	but yeah there's a there there's a downside there's worry refer us to three more things that cost us a fortune that really i don't know it'd have to be balance
S0417	mm yeah
S0415	probably can't hurt to have a conversation with with a
S0417	well
S0415	i mean i'd quite happily ring them and have a conversation with them on the phone
S0417	yeah but i think to be assist in any of those that would still cost money but yeah yeah yeah maybe you should do that
S0415	no just they might go well you know what bring him in for ten minutes and we'll tell you whether we've have any whether we think he should have an assessment you know they might just say something like that
S0417	mm mm yeah
S0415	you know what i mean like it's very hard like cos i presume people be generally refer to them
S0417	i suppose so but even then they probably need to be a team of i mean yeah maybe you're right but they probably need to be a team of people to be able to think anyway
S0415	yeah but they have the different people in there and things like erm
S0417	mm i suppose what we probably need probably isn't there but yeah maybe that's a good first call if you just call them
S0415	yeah but at least they could go yeah we've see load of kid we're not worry about him
S0417	well i'd i imagine last few wouldn't be that worry about him but part well i suppose part of me be think a little bite if it be a question of money and we just miss you know we miss a
S0415	you're think you're think of early intervention
S0417	yeah or maybe
S0415	the importance of
S0417	yeah couple of years off school and erm
S0415	yeah but like if we try it like i definitely think like spend two hundred quid now to get be better than spend have to spend more or do a lot more or do a lot more work
S0417	yeah
S0415	when there's more damage do
S0417	yeah yeah
S0415	once like this what i think you know none of us be seriously worry
S0417	but yeah yeah
S0415	he's special but special in a sense that like
S0417	no i'm not really worry
S0415	but like
S0417	and the amount of like like even in the past week he seem to be get things like no and look he know what look he know what a lot of things mean so erm
S0415	and as well like he's interact like in the last month or six weeks with every night like in the playpen
S0417	yeah he bond really well only with a few of us but he's not i can't imagine not be i mean somebody who's severely autistic for example would be like not want to have people anywhere near them and have eye contact and not
S0415	yeah he's very cuddly and
S0417	yeah and so i don't think he's severe in or somebody who's severely deaf would have would not be yeah
S0415	like he's funny and humorous
S0417	not be able to say something if somebody with severe speech think whatever one of those he's not
S0415	but he can say every word under the sun
S0417	yeah
S0415	he just doesn't couldn't be arsed
S0417	yeah but i i suppose part of me cos i be wonder whether sometimes i think with maybe i should have get him assess earlier maybe maybe it be nothing too but i think sometimes i struggle on where somebody you need a bite more with than other people and be a bite like that but in different ways like the things that he he's doesn't quite get that other kid can get i mean i think they're both really enjoyable
S0415	and this obsession with scream when people be talk
S0417	yeah he's really sensitive to sound and erm have to do quite a lot of things again and again with him like the alphabet again and again and again
S0415	well
S0417	yeah but you know he's quite he's he's extreme that way but erm i think he's break out of it now but hopefully erm but he like order things but yeah i'm not really worry about him just just maybe it's better to give him give him a kind of head start i don't know i mean there there's this this group that i've erm i've find which be be a little bite of a mad american group full of mums whose kid seem to be like learn phd phds
S0415	hyper legacy dot com
S0417	yeah hyper legacy and they're all full of kid who can read early but they're all all obsess or interest in number and letter early but have speech delay so they're they're like just like
S0415	do they all speak eventually
S0417	yeah see a lot of them be say you know they be diagnose autistic and they be erm and then it just all those autistic tendencies just kind of disappear after like the age of seven
S0415	i think dissipate be a nice word
S0417	dissipate yeah and there's some people who seem to have kid who be autistic and it there's no there's not really so much out there he can tell a lot between them mm
S0415	so
S0417	and there's some kid who just seem to be like that but they didn't have speech delay they be just normal and they just weren't very bright erm
S0415	indeed
S0417	ah ah we do well
S0417	erm but anyway so be that erm so a lot of them be sort of fight for it to be a distinct erm that i mean i don't really understand how like just need to be kid really early and they'll be
S0415	yeah
S0417	but he seem like he be he's have quite a lot of difficulty either that or she be
S0415	mm
S0417	really go overboard with how much time she spend with him
S0415	oh my god it's five to ten
S0417	oh well so anyway
S0415	so so matter of fact job do
