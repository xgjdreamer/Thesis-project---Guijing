S0525	it's go like massive everybody have it swear by it
S0615	steroids
S0525	yeah it's probably ban over here
S0615	mm yeah
S0525	probably contain too many strong ingredients but it work anyway how's your eczema do
S0615	it's fine
S0525	you haven't get any more
S0615	at the moment
S0525	cream
S0525	i be in boot
S0615	have to sterilise fifty thousand time a day with my pump any more
S0525	oh i see you're do more with that i go over to boot today after i'd be into next and erm
S0615	mm
S0525	i though oh i'll see if they've get any thermometers like the little stick ones we use to have
S0615	oh yeah
S0525	they're all dead expensive state of the art
S0615	that's what i think yeah
S0525	thirty quid
S0615	yeah
S0525	i i think
S0615	cos i have a look in asda and
S0525	what happen to the little stick things we use to just put under your arm and it just have a read on it
S0615	no idea
S0525	these ones i'm i didn't even see
S0615	like digital ones
S0525	yeah i didn't read how it work because the the print be too small i couldn't read it
S0615	mm
S0525	but i don't know if you this be even the non contact i don't know if you'd have to touch the baby or just do something
S0615	oh be they like cos what do they do oh they put it in their ear just in their ear then out on in hospital
S0525	be that what it be something like that maybe but
S0615	yeah no in asda it be like forty quid for one and i'm think well i'm not get one of those yeah
S0525	and it's just instant to yeah well you can just tell if they're hot i think can't you
S0615	mm
S0525	i couldn't believe i well i just assume you can still get the stuff that we have like i say it be a little stick that big with a with a digital read on the end
S0615	i haven't see them
S0525	and you put it under your arm and you wait for it to beep which probably take about thirty second to a minute so you but you know you can you can hold it there they're not bother when
S0615	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	and then when it beep you just read the temperature on it and that be it
S0615	mm
S0525	no i think that be ridiculous i didn't ask because i have a handful of things and there be a lot people at the at the till but i be gonna if i go in again and it's quieter i'll see if they do anything like that
S0615	mm okay
S0525	that's cheaper any more cos i be amaze i wonder if do superdrug and place like that do anything like that
S0615	don't know they might do
S0525	might go online and see but er the erm hopscotch
S0615	yeah that's great
S0525	be by the door what do you do with that
S0615	put it out
S0525	yeah and
S0615	i might get him to do hopscotch and chant time table
S0525	oh right
S0525	oh i see
S0525	have you get a plan for today then
S0615	em yeah ish
S0525	have you get a test again or not
S0615	no not a test no too little no point
S0525	and they're both do it together with you
S0615	yeah i'll just see how they go and
S0525	yes two and four so how how old do that make them six and eight
S0615	yeah i think one of them's just the older one's just about to turn nine so i think the younger one be seven already think that's by now
S0525	okay but the younger one's clever or more advance in a
S0615	well for her year
S0525	yeah okay
S0615	but erm yeah they're probably on about the same level mum say but
S0525	but do she want you to concentrate on the older one be that really who she want
S0615	yeah
S0525	the help for
S0615	she just want the younger one to sit in so
S0525	right
S0615	i won't worry
S0525	like a babysitting service
S0615	yeah i won't worry too much what she's you know how she's do i'll focus on the
S0525	yeah what you look at
S0615	thermometers on amazon
S0525	oh right
S0615	they're about yeah about ten pound so better than
S0525	there must be different varieties you can get which be more
S0615	yeah
S0525	basic
S0615	they've get the ear ones and the underarm ones
S0525	cos it's not like
S0615	forehead

S0525	such as what what do you mean to get together
S0615	well yeah just cos we haven't give her her
S0525	birthday present yet
S0615	birthday present or anything yet so don't know
S0525	no
S0615	but not yeah as far as i'm aware of
S0525	mm
S0615	didn't realise i hadn't tell about erm the the petrol so i tell her this morning she be er horrify but it be quite funny
S0525	oh you hadn't tell her
S0615	no no that be quite funny this morning
S0615	and er she be ask what we be the plan be on her birthday cos she know that we've be oh that we've be erm er invite over there haven't we
S0525	er
S0615	on the saturday
S0525	for 's
S0615	sunday
S0525	yeah sunday
S0615	sunday yes er for his thing but erm just say well er whatever erm we're do i'll just say whenever you want us around at the appropriate time that i need to leave because i need to be somewhere else so
S0525	yeah well that's fair enough isn't it
S0615	that's what i would say because that's what that's what happen to us on weekend and they've get to be place
S0525	well they only stop half an hour don't they and then they go
S0615	yeah so
S0525	mm that might be funny
S0615	they've get to be somewhere else so
S0525	well like i say whether we organise something here but if we do it'll probably have to be takeaway cos i i won't be we won't get in till midnight the night before
S0615	yeah that's fine
S0525	or if we go out that's fine as well
S0615	yeah
S0525	but can somebody remember to include nan
S0615	yes
S0525	let her know well i'm sure it'll be alright with but
S0615	yeah
S0525	invite her anyway see if she want to come over
S0615	i'll remember
S0525	yeah i suppose she'll be leave soon what time be it there now where be we it's just thursday morning
S0615	mm mm
S0525	yeah so she'll get yeah i suppose she's get another twelve hours or so twenty four hours maybe she
S0525	she leave
S0615	okay
S0525	cos i suppose she'll be get a flight from to auckland this time as well cos when she land her and spend a few days in auckland and drive
S0615	oh okay
S0525	to
S0615	oh
S0525	but it's erm you could do the drive in a day
S0615	yeah
S0525	if you could easily do it in a day really but erm it it's it's a fair way we
S0615	mm
S0525	we break it up but i imagine she'll get that internal flight cos there's an airport just down the road from
S0615	yes well
S0525	so she'll have to go auckland auckland somewhere in australia there to dubai
S0615	dubai and then back to
S0525	and dubai birmingham
S0525	as long as it's not like last time we come back ten hour delay on the grind
S0615	mm yes
S0525	she be panic over that cos
S0615	that wouldn't be fun by yourself would it
S0525	well not when we have to stop over in dubai but she'd've be fine because i mean she's business class and they be
S0615	yeah yeah
S0525	they weren't herd around like we be they be all give the nicest
S0615	mm
S0525	nicer hotel and put on the first available flight whereas we just get something later
S0615	yeah
S0525	erm
S0615	that'll just yeah should be fine
S0525	but i'm glad we do cos i would've hat to get up at the crack of dawn again cos we be so exhaust after all those and it'd take us the best part of twenty four hours to get to dubai
S0615	yeah
S0525	so without proper sleep i'd've be exhaust to
S0615	mm
S0525	it be crazy
S0615	yeah go straight off again
S0525	yeah cos it be i think it be a fourteen or a seventeen hour flight from melbourne to dubai
S0615	yeah
S0525	and then we'd have the flight from auckland which be only about three three three and a half hours but of course we spend ten hours on the plane already before we take off
S0615	mm
S0525	so you'd have your thirteen hours
S0525	before you get anywhere oh yeah it be a long long time
S0615	travel
S0525	i remember get on the plane at dubai the follow day and and we rock up to our seat
S0615	yeah
S0525	and that the girl and i be sit with be so cross that in the middle section of the plane where you've get the four seat
S0615	yeah
S0525	she'd get one and next to her be free and she'd get a baby lie on it
S0615	oh yeah
S0525	and all the stuff all around her for the baby
S0615	yeah
S0525	and we say well we you know these be our seat she go well they can't be i be tell
S0615	oh
S0525	that these seat be free when i book this when i book this journey i've come all the way from erm sydney
S0615	oh
S0525	and i've get and i say look i'm really sorry i say but we should've be on a flight twenty four hours ago we're actually twenty four hours delay at this point
S0615	yeah
S0525	we're not too impress either
S0615	yeah
S0525	but after that i be fine cos she she clearly be really tire and
S0615	yeah
S0525	we'd have a sleep and i be just hold the baby for her after a while on the flight anyway
S0615	yeah
S0615	mm mm
S0525	er well she she'd specifically ask and then of course they're just load the spare seat up with all of us
S0615	yeah
S0525	and you can understand it but
S0615	mm pain
S0525	we never get any compensation it doesn't er
S0615	travel
S0525	the lie they tell you
S0615	yeah yeah
S0525	because we know that be mechanical failure cos they tell us on the plane
S0615	mm
S0525	that a part have fail all these light have go on in the cockpit and they be fly a part in from sydney
S0615	yeah
S0525	to repair the plane and then by the time we'd land in dubai they say well there's no compensation it's it be due to bad weather
S0525	i say it wasn't due to bad weather
S0615	no
S0525	yes yes it be due to which be beyond our control if you look in your term and condition
S0615	mm
S0525	and and they that's what they stick with and absolute rubbish
S0615	yeah
S0525	i should've record the captain
S0615	yeah yeah definitely
S0525	but you don't know because you just assume that they'll pay up some sort of compensation
S0615	mm
S0525	you don't think you have to go to those sort of lengths i we could've pursue it but we didn't bother
S0615	well they just
S0525	they're just gonna that that be their story
S0615	say what they need to say
S0525	bad weather
