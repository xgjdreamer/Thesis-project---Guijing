S0679	so what have we get plan for supper
S0680	well there's fill pasta spinach and ricotta
S0679	mm mm
S0680	with some variety of sauce
S0679	what what do you think you've get
S0680	erm tomato and basil
S0679	mm mm that's a good standby
S0680	sweet tomato erm tomato and sweet pepper
S0679	that's probably my overall favourite
S0680	i don't think i've get a vegetable one
S0679	oh i don't think i have that one be that the one we have in the summer
S0680	possibly
S0679	which you no that be a that be a curry one i think
S0680	oh we have the curry one yeah we i don't know if they make that anymore with the lentil
S0679	mm that be very tasty i enjoy that one and erm mm so if we have that today what have we get for tomorrow
S0680	we have some erm cheese and what be they cheese and leek plait
S0679	oh yeah linda mccartney well mccartney ones
S0680	cheese and leek plait yes linda mccartney ones the cheese and leek plait with erm a random selection of sauce and vegetables
S0679	oh 's steam vegetables
S0680	my steam vegetables which will be be root parsnip carrot er i haven't get any celery unfortunately parsnip carrot there might be leeks certainly onion tomato er what else do i put in there mushroom
S0679	oh
S0680	i quite often put the odd bite of slice potato in there
S0679	but not on this occasion
S0680	i could do we haven't get any
S0679	that that little yes that do rather limit the range or so somebody inform me earlier
S0680	i think i've use them all up haven't i
S0679	so nice
S0680	yes no i do reserve a couple and then i think i use them yes so possibly not potato on this occasion but those erm new potatoes be very nice steam
S0679	mm
S0680	i don't think i have any courgette
S0679	it's not really the season for courgette be it
S0680	well there's still quite a lot about but they get a bite marrowy
S0679	yes that can easily happen in the garden with inattention
S0680	mm so unless you buy the erm expensive little ones
S0679	mm
S0680	so that kind of thing if you fancy
S0679	yes that
S0680	i don't have any cabbage
S0679	one other meal one other tea leave
S0680	well if i can buy some staffordshire oatcakes
S0679	oh oatcakes
S0680	we could have erm cheese tomato mushroom
S0679	you could save a little bite of the sauce the pasta sauce
S0680	with a bite of pasta sauce
S0679	we've do that haven't we
S0680	yes we could have that erm you still haven't have erm scramble egg and
S0679	oh no i've get a whole box of six
S0680	bean on toast because i i only need a few egg to erm
S0679	mm
S0680	do cook
S0679	mm
S0680	cakey cookie things with so i won't be use for eat
S0679	i may have to not have one of the other meals then
S0680	no you might have to stay longer
S0679	no i can't i i'm go i'm go back
S0680	stay longer to er finish up your dinners
S0679	no just think of those men on the station they well where be she she's not sit there she's not in either of the seat what do i do
S0680	yes
S0679	they'd probably get a black mark if they don't have a passenger
S0680	they might do
S0679	although that that guy who didn't have to assist me when we come up seem to be quite happy the fact
S0680	oh yeah he be he be quite happy yes he didn't have to do it
S0679	although he keep us company didn't he
S0680	oh yes
S0679	he think he would entertain us if he couldn't assist us
S0680	yes yes yes he entertain us on the way
S0679	though he only have to go quite a short distance i feel back to his erm information point
S0680	well if you have be in original coach b
S0679	mm
S0680	he would have be halfway to practically cos that platform's ever so long
S0679	mm
S0680	if you think of the alphabet from b to
S0679	oh yes a probably
S0680	no
S0679	there isn't an a
S0680	no
S0679	so the engine
S0680	yeah well it's not usually the a on that train it's b and it go to i think it probably go to m and lot of number lot of erm lot of letter so it be quite a long walk when you get in b so he might have think he'd get
S0679	but you have more than one platform presumably
S0680	what
S0679	the information point perhaps there's an information point at the end of each station
S0680	well the i think when you go to the information point it's probably the one that's next door to mark and spencer's
S0679	oh it's somewhere just inside the door
S0680	because otherwise you would have to go through the barrier to get to him
S0679	yeah but you've virtually get on the train haven't you by then
S0680	yeah
S0679	and i'm have assistance from other
S0680	mm
S0679	although how you're mean to get assistance from other
S0680	mm
S0679	to the information point be largely in the lap of the gods
S0680	mm
S0679	but i know how it's go to happen on this occasion
S0680	yes
S0679	and indeed i can probably manage myself
S0680	cos the thing be if you get drop off by a taxi i'm not entirely sure you can be drop off at that entrance
S0679	oh oh isn't that where we get the taxi from
S0680	we get it from but they all park in that road and come round
S0679	oh
S0680	to pick up people
S0679	mm
S0680	it's for pick up i'm not entirely sure
S0679	oh
S0680	if it's for drop off
S0679	obviously
S0680	but they might be able to drop you off there cos originally that be the only exit but now erm they tend to drop you off at the back of the station
S0679	mm
S0680	and you have to walk you know where the ticket er the long row of ticket offices be erm
S0679	i wasn't pay attention
S0680	well as you come out as we head for the exit to get the taxi off to the leave and it's a bite chaos at the moment
S0679	mm
S0680	because they're erm get all that build work go on but if you go off to the leave there's about sort of at least eight or ten ticket windows and you have to go past there and then down the stairs or the slope and there's all the restaurants and things you know and what be the information office that's no longer open the erm you know the one and then you go out of a door at the very far end there which be the back of the station in street
S0679	mm
S0680	as in the river
S0679	yes
S0680	you know you know the hotel that's part of the station a big white build well
S0679	you know i've not be
S0680	vaguely white cos there's
S0679	yes
S0680	opposite where the station be
S0679	mm
S0680	the station run from behind it it must be very quite noisy stay in the hotel that white build or
S0679	mm
S0680	it's whiter than it use to be erm take up that block more or less a lot of that block
S0679	mm
S0680	and the station be down the end of that and you go down and around a little roundabout to the back so it's quite a long way
S0679	mm
S0680	difference that's why if somebody's pick you up you've get to sort of tell them to go to that because if you're come out on foot you tend to come out you and catch a bus you tend to come out the front
S0679	pick me up didn't he that be you
S0680	that be from the back
S0679	you you and him
S0680	yeah that be from the back
S0679	that must have be about two thousand and seven or eight seven
S0680	about mm
S0679	i come up to that day conference about
S0680	yes because you arrive early
S0679	texting
S0680	because you'd already you'd already get out onto the front there hadn't you you be wait by the car park be you i think you be wait by the twenty minute car park
S0679	i think you'd get there early too but maybe wait somewhere else i'm not sure well it all it all end happily
S0680	we meet up yeah
S0679	without any difficulties
S0680	be that when i you be at my house and i have i drive you
S0679	you drive me and dump outside the er
S0680	drop you in the university
S0679	yes and then i go to that day texting conference
S0680	and then when you finish you you just get down to the station didn't you cos you be quite near the station there
S0679	erm
S0680	i didn't i don't think i pick you up
S0679	no
S0680	i i can't remember if you walk or something
S0679	i get taxi or whatever
S0680	mm cos we weren't quite sure when it be finish
S0679	mm
S0680	i might have be at work or something
S0679	well we don't know don't know but that be all about well how you use text message
S0680	well that be a while ago
S0679	well no we still have text message
S0680	no i mean when they first sort of come in
S0679	well it be about how you use them to get people to appointments cos people have start experiment with students
S0680	oh like the
S0679	yes
S0680	doctor buzz you and send you more than you
S0679	i mean doctor didn't do those days
S0680	no well they overdo it now you get get two
S0679	oh
S0680	in rapid succession
S0679	oh mm well how you could have buy them and you'd buy them in bulk the message
S0680	yes
S0679	and then you send them out and i think they say that boys you know men
S0680	mm yes
S0679	students
S0680	yes
S0679	be four time as likely to come to their counsel interview or their
S0680	yeah
S0679	you know
S0680	mm
S0679	have to see somebody i think we're talk about further education maybe but i don't know
S0680	yes
S0679	whatever if you send them a text message to remind them
S0680	yes
S0679	than if you didn't which obviously help because of the waste an awful lot of appointments i think girls be better i can't remember about girls
S0680	yeah
S0679	the hospital's still send fun message that i think should be receive on i think they're probably for a mobile phone but they erm send them out
S0680	think they're go to an iphone
S0679	well they don't know and they say press something and wait and oh and then they say we'll phone you again and they phone again
S0680	oh i just get a text message
S0679	oh
S0680	say you've get an appointment at at either your doctor or hospital be what the implication be they don't actually
S0679	oh
S0680	they don't send they're not particularly specific they're not
S0679	oh no
S0680	they're just general
S0680	these be general
S0679	yeah come from and the hospital definitely come from the hospital
S0680	yes it's
S0679	and
S0680	it's more like you have you have an appointment with a whichever trust it be you know
S0679	mm
S0680	or your gp so you've get to remember which it be yourself to some extent it's not very clear
S0679	i think it's a good idea in theory you have to get the time right i think the the doctor's one oh the doctor's one always use to email as soon as you make the appointment
S0680	yes which be not it confirm you've make it but it's not very helpful to to remind me
S0679	and i'm not sure now it might do it a day before or it might do it both but you see when i have my doctor phone me she doesn't put an appointment in the system
S0680	no she do it off her own bat
S0679	i think she just write a note on her desk to phone me
S0680	yeah
S0679	cos on a couple of occasion i phone up to check about the time
S0680	mm and nobody know about it
S0679	and they say oh we'll just write the name down although she's very good at remember who she have to phone but we'll add your name onto her list
S0680	yes
S0679	but it's always work she phone here quite a lot in the summer didn't she
S0680	yes
S0679	which be very good of her well i suppose we could try to resume activity in the kitchen
S0680	i be just think which
S0679	mm
S0680	erm hopefully we'll remember at work
S0679	mm
S0680	take my well i think and he should have my email address because
S0679	oh yes
S0680	he have it but he take my email address again so that when he send notification of what work there be
S0679	oh yes
S0680	he can send me it
S0679	oh be that what happen last time
S0680	which might have when he didn't no he didn't send me an email cos he didn't
S0679	no
S0680	know my thing and he he phone me up
S0679	but do it not happen last time
S0680	no cos
S0679	but be he intend to send it but didn't have your email so he have to ask you separately
S0680	but always always use to ring me you see which be what he do
S0679	mm
S0680	or text me to ring her erm so i say remind him that if he send me an email i i be unlikely to have read it
S0679	email and text would be better wouldn't it
S0680	so i say if you send me an email can you just text to say you've send me an email
S0679	mm
S0680	which be what my neighbour do and then i'll make an effort to find a computer to look it up on
S0679	mm mm
S0680	so it's not very helpful have email
S0679	no but it's
S0680	unsolicited
S0679	it's better than not have the possibility of look at the email at the same time isn't it
S0680	yes cos didn't keep texting me about other things but she didn't text me to say she'd send me that email
S0679	no well maybe she didn't think it be an action email
S0680	no but she'd
S0679	well i'm go to switch off this record now
S0680	and we better go and do something
S0679	yeah
S0680	do something practical
S0679	yeah
S0680	yes
S0679	what do you think we might do
S0680	can you get out of that chair
S0679	yeah i can probably do it
S0679	i be just generally relax for a moment on the way
S0680	yes
S0679	so er let's have a look er that's what i'll do
