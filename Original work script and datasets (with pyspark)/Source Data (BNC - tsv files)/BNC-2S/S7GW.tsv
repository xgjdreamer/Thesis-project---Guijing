S0618	yeah actually when i be erm actually a a few boyfriends ago he be a really nice fella too nice actually erm his sister be marry to a guy who work for british steel and live in thailand so we go out and stay with them for a bite and have a bite of a tour of thailand on holiday while we be there which be nice and erm yeah i remember we go to the british club and get a massage there and they tend to employ blind thai people because the theory be that they be better at massage and the massage be amaze i have a probably a better one from a a rather rotund thai lady on a beach for about a tenth of the price as well erm but yeah so that be an eye opener but you know the very fact they have this british club and these ex pat er community gather and ex pat events and yeah it didn't really dawn on me at the time but i think now be here every now and again on facebook it flash up about ex pat blah blah blah and i think actually i think you mean immigrant it just seem to have such negative connotations but i'm an immigrant and i think i will be an immigrant for the next few years actually whereevr i move in
S0619	mm mm yeah so they be straight mm absolutely yeah yeah and i be say this to yesterday he be like oh i be read up on you know polish on the polish mm political system at the moment and i be gonna ask you about it and i be just like well you know from my point of view i don't want to be in the country anymore where immigrants aren't welcome because i'm an immigrant as much anybody else
S0618	mm yeah
S0619	but i'm okay because i'm white because i'm here to sort of help the economy rather than hinder it in the sense that i'm help you know polish people do whatever it be and learn this necessary skill i don't want to be here if you know i'm not not tar with the same brush that's not the thing that's not what i want to say but erm do you know what i mean it's like
S0618	yeah yeah mm yeah mm why be you okay
S0619	yeah why be i okay i don't want to be here if if immigrants aren't welcome then i don't feel welcome either
S0618	and somebody from syria for example isn't yeah yeah
S0619	erm and i've felt like that since this new government be sort of bring in i just think oh i'm not interest anymore so goodbye
S0618	i think it be there before the new government it be there before the elections actually interestingly one of my students this week start on about the all these syrian immigrants come over here rap women and i hear that even before i move to poland about erm the perception of particularly syrian refugees be rapists
S0619	mm mm mm mm mm yeah mm it's not syrian refugees it be well there's the statistically it be erm migrants come from north africa erm and i be listen to something on the radio about this last week and it's lot of different reason why this be happen er one be that people be come to the west and they're not be educate as to what be right and what be wrong in this society now that's not say that well it's it's okay to do it in north africa obviously it be not okay but erm here the repercussions you know in germany and scandinavia the repercussions will be much more serious erm so they be not be educate enough you know etiquette and manners and what be right and what be acceptable here er and it's to do with society and gender issue and all these things erm but it's not a syrian refugee thing it's a north african migrant worker thing
S0618	mm mm yeah mm yeah mm oh interest accord to my student this week it's syrian muslim refugees who be come along and rap people
S0619	mm mm yeah
S0618	erm it be also actually no it wasn't it wasn't syrian specifically i'm think there be also a woman i do my celta with erm a polish woman and i stay with her when i drive over here er before i get to i stop off with her she just live outside of and i have a bite of a disagreement with her as well erm for her it be refugee muslim rapists and
S0619	mm mm one of my students say this in my class as well and i say in the class er this be not because of their religion or the colour of their skin or where they come from this be a man versus woman issue and it be like don't ever forget that these men fundamentally be rapists because they be men not because they be muslim and he be like
S0619	and i be like look if you be gonna if you be play with fire in my lessons
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	i'm just go to like pin everything on you
S0618	be you sure you want to open that door come on walk on through it yeah
S0619	so yeah horrible
S0618	but i also wonder you know how much of an issue be it because the the general perception that i have from er the woman that i stay with and from the student be that this be an enormous problem and that it's the majority that be rap people and i you know i don't believe that's the case for a minute and i say to her it's interest i haven't hear half so much about that from er uk media i've see a lot on uk media about people be welcome in particularly erm have erm local organisations where immigrants refugees be welcome and be help to integrate into the community in denmark i think it be denmark one of the scandinavian countries be desperate for young workers they be welcome refugees with open arm to boost their worker economy so you know it just look very much to me like the media in different countries for political end decide to put a certain
S0619	yeah mm i think just you know no mm mm mm yeah focus on different things
S0618	a certain focus on it
S0619	erm so yet two things the first one i read a lovely article from work erm and it be about a er a woman in her thirties who need a roommate or a flatmate erm and a refugee from syria who need somewhere to live er and er the state would pay the rent for him but it need to be a private landlord and blah blah blah and so he move in with her erm and you know her family be go well what about all of these you know all of these sexual assault and do you not feel threaten and she be like oh god i didn't even that didn't even cross my mind i be worry whether it would mean that i would have to drink less alcohol in case he be offend or whether you know he would be offend if i be eat like bacon on a saturday morning
S0618	mm yeah yeah yeah don't offer him a game of card at christmas
S0619	yeah you know erm so and it this be they've be live together for a few months now erm and about their sort of relationships he's learn english and he's er help around the house and put up shelve and all of these things erm and on halloween she go dress as jeremy corbyn and he go dress as david cameron with you know like a conservative rosette and erm you know quote attribute to david cameron sort of pin to his body and there's this picture and she's you know white face with huge ring around her eye and grey hair er you know and there's
S0618	mm that's scary oh my goodness that's some cultural integration for this guy
S0619	yeah and he's go to er he's go to he go to her family's house for for christmas and she live near the coast and you know he just have such a lovely time erm and you know he eat the turkey er even though it be halal because you know it's be bless because it's a you know it be a christmas dinner so the food have be bless maybe if it's bless by somebody it's you know it's okay for me to eat
S0618	mm yeah yeah yeah that's interest
S0619	so it be just really a lovely read
S0618	yeah i i guess what sort of strike me about that story be you be talk about two individual human be with their label strip away you be not talk christian or muslim or male or female or syrian or north african or english or anything you be talk about two human be who you know find they have plenty in common
S0619	mm mm mm mm mm yeah have be bring together and they're you know have quite a nice time of it
S0618	yeah yeah that's lovely
S0619	yeah i will try and find it and send it to you but it be really just a nice thing to read
S0618	mm i think the bottom line for me be people be people and i think all humans wherever they be want the best for themselves and for their family and first and foremost that mean a safe place to live where you be warm you be comfortable you know you've get shelter you've get food you've get community you've get relationships you know you feel part of something bigger than yourself perhaps be that family or community or whatever and yeah i mean there's so much that divide people and it be really be divide and conquer as far as i'm concern while people be still fight each other and poor be fight poor in the and not focus on more things
S0619	yeah mm yeah mm mm i don't want live here and like my main problem with this sort of racial racial problem be be how can people here feel so strongly about this potential threat when there isn't even a threat no refugees want to come here because they know they won't be welcome and there's the economy be not strong enough for them to get a job erm how can you feel so strongly against you know someone if you've never meet anyone from a different culture
S0618	mm mm yeah i know yeah mm yeah he's a person that you don't know
S0619	how can you feel so strongly against muslims as a whole if you've never meet anyone who be not like you white i just don't get it it just doesn't even like register in my brain i just don't understand how you can have these sort of preconceptions like so er and be so easily influence by what you read in the newspapers or what the government tell you to think how can you even think like that without be question
S0618	yeah yeah yeah it do not compute yeah i suppose that yeah i agree it do seem to be you know quite a big issue here
S0619	yeah
S0618	of mainstream media manipulation
S0619	but at the same time the people who vote for this political party and this party who have get the majority vote the the voters be people who i never encounter they be older very religious people and i never meet old religious people here i don't teach them like you know i don't talk to them
S0618	yeah mm yeah yeah be they have you ask your students do you vote for them
S0619	no but i think that's the like the the voter be that person
S0618	yeah okay because you see i think the same about when cameron get in again i think holy shit i don't know anybody who's vote for this arse
S0619	mm no
S0618	and i'd express that when i have a trip to england actually it be before christmas it be before oh no it be when i be on my way to poland actually it be september last year and i be say i have no idea who vote for these people and then my brother say actually i do and my niece say oh and i do because my father do and then my uncle say well i do and my aunt say well i do and i say i don't know you people
S0619	yeah mm yeah that's i know you get i be so surprise when this government get in because it be like everyone that i interact with
S0618	yeah yeah abhor everything that cameron stand for
S0619	yeah absolutely it be er and it be because i mean you know i be selective with who i'm friends with on facebook and twitter so i just have it in my mind that absolutely everyone
S0618	yeah yeah yeah yeah nobody vote for them
S0619	think the same politically and socially as me
S0618	i know it really pull me up short
S0619	yeah yeah
S0618	and then you go oh bloody hell no they don't it be just that i've just handpicked this group of friends to be around and we all have a similar interest but the rest of the you know the country isn't like that i be like how weird be that
S0618	yeah exactly who be very much like you yeah yeah yeah i know i know you could have knock me down with a feather i just think my god we share the same blood i'm relate to you i can't believe this so
S0619	you just think you know and what you think be be true isn't you think god i be so wrong yeah there's a wider world there's a wider world out there than you certainly than your own sort of friendship group i suppose
S0618	yeah yeah so i think we've do quite well to get away from cameron and his policies just leave the country so job do this be where we have end up
S0619	it's a lot worse
S0618	yeah to an immigrant and refugee hat country instead so oh well try spain
S0619	i don't know i just think wherever you be gonna encounter these problems and as bad as er england be and as bad as cameron be it's not as bad as the government here who be do everything they can to change the constitution without agreement from anybody yeah
S0618	yeah yeah and so be cameron if you look at the legislation but anyway that's a whole other barrel of fish slippery eels
S0619	slippery eels
S0618	yeah i do wonder though historically or if we sort of look back on this time of i suppose for me thatcher and reagan be the begin of the end they be the epitome of everything that suck they kick start the sort of neoliberal capitalism that's bring the world to its knees really but i do wonder if you need a certain amount of that selfishness before the rest of the world go hang on a minute this really isn't right and i look at corbyn come through now who seem like i don't think we've see a politician like him since possibly john smith who i think be probably murder and then also erm you have get that fella in the state bill sanders who have basically say erm you know i can win an election but i'm not go to change anything it be up to you all the people to stand up and fight for what you believe in erm i can do what i can to take the corruption out of politics and to start change the system from within but it be down to you take some fuck responsibility and i wonder if corbyn be go to be a little bite like that as well so i do wonder and actually i suppose if you look back at the end of the eighties and the collapse of communism it be almost like it need to get as bad as it can possibly get erm and that that sort of that particular branch of communism get as bad as it could possibly get and then it just crumble erm in no time and i be talk with about this the other day
S0619	yeah mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm yeah we need to rebuild it
S0618	yeah i do wonder if you know this particular form of capitalism and this particular form of ho ho democracy have reach as bad as it's gonna get and it's just gonna fall in the come years maybe five years come in ten years will it last that long but i do think sort of economically socially and environmentally the world be on its knees now something have get to give it be interest
S0619	mm mm mm mm yeah it be really er quite frighten i suppose
S0618	i find it excite rather than frighten
S0619	i think it's take over do you
S0618	yeah i do i think it's an amaze time to be alive
S0619	it can only get better yeah but i suppose every every lifetime be a great time to be alive i don't think this be any better or any worse than any other time
S0618	yeah i guess so i suppose there's sort of peak of activity i just can't help but feel that there's a sort of a you know a world regime that's gear towards economic outcomes with the environment and society be sacrifice and that seem to be the theme of the moment and the theme of the last thirty years or more but when that collapse and that shift i don't know it just seem like a momentous thing i do see humanity become more love and more open and i wonder in a way if the refugee issue be get people to address their own prejudice and to start think in term of human as humans rather than religion
S0619	mm mm mm yeah if it really star you in the face you've get to address it in some way
S0618	yeah
S0619	even it mean unlearn everything that you know
S0618	yeah yeah exactly it's tackle belief systems
S0619	mm yeah
S0618	a lot of which particularly in this country people would have be bring up with with a very heavy church influence heavy influence of dogma i do come back to a lot i do think organise religion have a huge amount to answer for in the world that we see today
S0619	mm mm yeah well when i be talk to yesterday he's he's get the impression that after go to england next week she might start plan to move erm she just need to sort of take the this first step of go and see how she get on because i mean he's he's get the impression that she's she doesn't want to be part of this she can't find her place in polish society because she doesn't sort of agree with so much of it
S0618	mm yeah mm i can understand that
S0619	mm
S0618	yeah she hasn't express that so overtly to me but read between the line i could see how that could well be the case i think she's particularly excite about this job which you can potentially do from any country
S0619	no she hasn't to me mm yeah yeah exactly
S0618	i think it it sound like it be not very well pay so she might want to reconsider go to england so maybe live in a country where she doesn't need so much money for rent and food
S0619	yeah no i don't think it would be a full time thing and she will always earn you know she can speak three languages completely fluently like there will be opportunities for her and as sad as it be i suppose who move last year she's work in the body shop and she's probably earn way more in the body shop than she be work as a teacher in
S0618	that's true mm yeah yeah i'm sure
S0619	so
S0618	i think the polish teachers of english don't get pay even as much as the natives
S0619	twenty twenty five
S0618	jesus
S0619	my friends last year they be it be their first year teach at and they get twenty an hour or twenty for forty five minutes
S0618	wow this be polish people
S0619	mm yeah because it be their first year and if you be teach kid in elementary and your language level be lower you don't get so much whereas if you be up there teach like proficiency and cae you get pay more because you've get to have a better level of english but you've get to work through the system and it always make i always question like why she's stick to teach like pre intermediate and why she should be teach like the top i suppose it's just like years those years that you be in the company i guess and have be teach for fifteen years so she teach proficiency
S0618	yeah a different level mm mm yeah yeah yeah why mm maybe she enjoy it i don't know yeah wow i suppose if you be happy
S0619	yeah
S0618	and you don't aspire to earn more you don't need to earn more you love what you do it doesn't matter
S0619	and the lower level you teach the earlier that you finish whereas when you teach the highest level you finish later
S0618	mm mm oh yeah half eight or whatever yeah
S0619	yeah and if you have get a family or you just want your own time then
S0618	yeah oh i keep mean to ask you i've give all of my students notice that i'm stop teach at the end of february do you want my private students sixty up to an hour forty five for forty five minutes
S0619	mm yeah do you have to do any sort of real preparation
S0618	no
S0619	or just chat
S0618	chat
S0619	do you plan anything that you be go to do
S0618	a little bite erm i've get erm have erm english file upper intermediate second edition and be on third edition but i've get second edition pdfs and i could email you those erm he's like well for his first few lessons he like to work out of the book and i tell him straight off don't oscillate about grammar talk to your polish teacher about that don't ask a native so he be fine with that but we tend to as the time go on use the book really as ideas for topics but now that we have get to know each other a bite better the last couple of lessons we haven't even look at the book so i've have the pdfs open at the right page the teachers book and student book ready to use if he want to but he hasn't want to so i've just be kind of follow his lead all i do for all of my students be i've get a sheet of a4 divide into three section which be erm the first section be error corrections so i will write down things where i don't want to interrupt their flow and bring them up at the end of the lesson and they correct them the next section be new vocab so if we come across something like i don't know probably an idiom or something like that er the rat be desert a sink ship whatever it might be i'll write that down what the mean mean if it's come up in conversation and the final section be erm pronunciation and we go through the pronunciation and i get them to write next to it how it sound to them
S0619	mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm yeah yeah yeah
S0618	i think use the correct phone or whatever
S0619	phonetics oh
S0618	yeah but others just write it as they'll remember it and understand it and they take that sheet away with them so all i'm do throughout the lesson be on the spot correction if it feel appropriate if it doesn't feel appropriate just note note it for later it's easy it's easy money
S0619	mm mm yeah mm yeah no it be easy yeah i use to do it in three section which would be error correction pronunciation and then the third one be things i like that you have say
S0618	hey that's cool
S0619	but i really like it when you say this
S0618	that's a good idea
S0619	but yeah new vocab as well because they just tend to write write it somewhere separate but if i have it in in an organise way
S0618	mm yeah yeah
S0619	yeah
S0618	so as the lesson go through i'm just jot things down but really we be talk about everything i mean they be all sort of my age or thereabouts so we talk about music and about things that i don't know old folks talk about but i'm sure you will find plenty in common with them as well yeah never short of conversation
S0619	yeah mm mm mm yeah yeah i notice
S0618	yeah never short of conversation with this
S0619	i'm really lucky with my one to ones i hat one to ones last year i use to really dread them er but i've get a fifteen year old boy who just be happy to do whatever whenever he want er i've get this girl who's erm do her medical interview so it's just every week go so how do you feel about euthanasia talk for eight minutes
S0618	mm
S0619	i be like this
S0618	be this the one in aberdeen
S0619	abortion how do you feel yeah
S0618	have you manage to get her to express an opinion yet because you be have trouble with that
S0619	no she's fine she's fine at everything yeah
S0618	oh good good who's the one you have difficulty with one of your students express an opinion
S0619	oh yeah the daughter the daughter of my other one to one erm and she just who what music do you like i don't know what do you mean you don't know come on

S0618	yeah
S0619	even if the word be the wrong word in the wrong order as long as your your mouth be make a noise
S0618	yeah it's all a vaguely coherent sentence yeah
S0619	and the woman i have last night this fashion designer woman all we be do and we have be do it for two weeks be read an article that she print off on the internet about the next biggest trend i be like by the time we finish this article these will not be new trend in fashion these will be last like season but it's really difficult word difficult vocabulary because it be write for a music a music for a magazine and there's only so many ways that they can say this be a groundbreaking coat
