S0454	mm
S0466	liquid
S0454	really
S0466	yeah it go kind of
S0454	but
S0466	syrupy it go more viscous
S0454	ah
S0466	but it doesn't freeze
S0454	but wine would blow up wouldn't it
S0466	yes because it would freeze
S0454	ah cos it's not a high enough
S0466	not strong enough
S0454	alcohol content
S0466	yeah
S0454	so what's that cut off point
S0466	i dunno i only do sort of forty percent type spirit
S0454	oh that's really clever mm
S0466	and that's usually fine it's nice cos then you don't need ice
S0454	oh that's a good point
S0466	and i quite like it
S0454	that be clever
S0466	mm
S0454	right
S0466	bon appetit
S0466	oh oh yeah i've get some sake too
S0454	mm mm nice
S0466	mm
S0454	very nice mm
S0466	mm
S0454	mm so be the lasagne the no cook sort i mean not no
S0466	yeah pre
S0454	no boil sort
S0466	no no precook
S0454	no precook
S0466	which i think i be standard in the uk
S0454	be it
S0466	i think so
S0454	mm that's annoy when you have to do that stage
S0466	cos i go to when i i cook a lasagne in korea we have a lasagne night
S0454	mm
S0466	and i buy the lasagne sheet in korea
S0454	mm
S0466	and it mine be a disaster cos i didn't precook the lasagne
S0466	i didn't even know there be an option and then it be all really hard
S0454	so everyone make a different sort of lasagne
S0466	yeah we have two
S0454	that's quite cool
S0466	two or three different ones
S0454	yeah that's cool
S0466	mm
S0454	mm very nice
S0466	mm i like it with spinach
S0454	mm it's nice so that you boil first
S0466	yeah
S0454	the cub to make them come back to leave
S0466	mm
S0454	mm clever
S0466	just for five minutes
S0454	that be clever and then you do it in layer
S0466	layer yeah
S0454	mm
S0466	and use one box which be perfect
S0454	mm and then the sauce you put on the top or do you layer it throughout
S0466	layer it
S0454	mm
S0466	but you don't have to do the well the sauce be mix with the beef
S0454	oh okay you mix it
S0466	yeah you can you can mix the spinach in too but i didn't just layer it
S0454	no i just layer it yeah
S0466	erm yeah and that's it
S0454	mm
S0466	but only layer so you ensure each lasagne layer have er liquid
S0454	yeah
S0466	so the it's in the liquid
S0454	mm mm yeah the spinach be nice
S0466	mm
S0454	yeah it's a good idea keep spinach in the freezer like that
S0466	i know cos i wouldn't well actually we do often buy bag but
S0454	mm
S0466	nice to just keep some reserve and
S0454	mm
S0466	freeze fruit although could just pick the fruit
S0454	pick the fruit
S0466	mm like blackberry and then freeze them which be quite good in the autumn
S0454	mm
S0466	yeah
S0454	yeah mum do that
S0466	oh do she
S0454	yeah she still do that i like do that and they've have quite a lot of soft fruit this year so they've freeze some of that
S0466	mm oh they've pick that from the garden
S0454	yeah some of it
S0466	that's good do they some
S0454	some of it they didn't pick
S0466	just a waste
S0454	mm
S0466	oh such a shame
S0454	mm
S0466	they should put a poster up on like or something and say well we've get surplus fruit come round and help yourself
S0454	but they don't like people
S0466	no they don't no
S0466	such shame though cos like somebody would and that's really good for a family
S0454	yeah it's true yeah
S0466	mm or dad could employ someone
S0454	mm
S0466	and then sell it
S0454	i don't think he like that idea either
S0466	no people
S0454	yeah
S0466	oh i don't like waste though
S0454	next year when i'm there
S0466	yeah you can
S0454	then i'll do it
S0466	you could organise
S0454	yeah
S0466	yeah i don't like waste
S0454	no
S0454	especially food
S0466	mm
S0454	they're say in the paper i think that one i be read today yeah about britons be the most wasteful nation for throw away fruit and vegetables and we throw away like a quarter or a third or something
S0466	that's terrible
S0454	mm
S0466	that's really bad
S0454	mm
S0466	every time i throw something away which isn't that often i feel really guilty even milk cos it's almost as cheap to buy twice as much as
S0454	yeah and now you know what to do with milk
S0466	yeah
S0454	and you can make cheese
S0466	or freeze half of it yeah
S0454	or freeze it yeah
S0466	freezer's good
S0454	and the other thing be to make soup isn't it out of any
S0466	old veg and
S0454	leftover veg
S0466	yeah it's fine you can
S0454	or bread you can
S0466	oh
S0454	add bread to thicken it
S0466	to soup
S0454	instead of potato
S0466	oh
S0454	so that's what 's mum use to do
S0466	that's quite a good one
S0454	mm
S0466	stale rather than mouldy
S0454	cos obviously it's like yeah
S0466	yeah
S0454	it's flour isn't it so it's gonna have
S0466	mm
S0454	exactly the same effect
S0466	that's true then it's get some substance to it
S0454	yeah
S0466	that you
S0454	and just add it at the end and then blend it so you get a smooth consistency
S0466	oh okay
S0454	so you don't need to cook it
S0466	that's good
S0454	mm
S0466	yeah i can imagine we waste so much part of it i think i don't think it's good all these multi buy offer at the supermarket
S0454	no
S0466	it just encourage you to buy too much
S0454	mm
S0466	i think it would be better if everything just have flat price
S0454	this geography teacher i work with cos geography teachers be often a bite sort of leave lean but he like i have to observe and teach he be my mentor
S0466	oh
S0454	and i remember him tell a story about how he'd go to the supermarket to buy a bag of potatoes and as he get to the checkout the checkout girl say oh they're buy one get one free so you you can go and get another one from erm
S0466	mm
S0454	and bring it back and he say yeah but
S0466	don't need another one
S0454	i don't need two i only need one
S0466	doesn't mean anything
S0454	and she's like no but it's free so you can get two and he's like yeah but i don't need two i only need one
S0466	mm
S0454	i can only eat one
S0466	uhu
S0454	and she say yeah but it's free and like
S0466	oh well
S0454	she couldn't like
S0466	she didn't get it
S0454	get it yeah although i think like he hadn't really think that through cos what he should have do be like give it to his neighbour or
S0466	yeah yeah yeah that's right
S0454	anything yeah it wouldn't really matter
S0466	mm
S0454	yeah but we're not very good
S0466	that's
S0454	with our neighbour in this country
S0466	no we're not
S0454	that's be the nice thing about where i be i've get to know quite a lot of people through that walk group
S0466	oh yeah yeah it's good to do a local club
S0454	not literally neighbour but
S0466	no but
S0454	within five minutes' walk
S0466	locals oh right it's a really local walk
S0454	it's very local yeah
S0466	mm
S0454	it's just like tower block so it's like a different tower block to mine
S0466	mm that's nice
S0454	mm
S0466	nice to know somebody really close you can always
S0454	mm
S0466	if you're ever in trouble or
S0454	yeah and actually when i have that hospital thing they be really good
S0466	oh yeah
S0454	they be the ones who come back yeah
S0466	mm
S0454	mm
S0466	oh that's nice
S0454	check up on me
S0466	mm yeah it's
S0454	yeah and i i just need to make an effort like i mean i guess like in mum and dad's case they try with the neighbour and she doesn't want to be friendly but you
S0466	oh really
S0454	you can try and then give up i guess can't you like they've do
S0466	yeah yeah you can always try
S0454	mm
S0466	mm which neighbour's that the one
S0454	erm
S0466	or both
S0454	the one who just get cancer actually who's
S0466	oh that one
S0454	terminal
S0466	mm
S0454	yeah that's a shame
S0466	mm
S0454	mm but yeah grandma and grandpa be always like that weren't they they
S0466	mm yeah
S0454	their neighbour be really really friendly apparently
S0466	so they
S0454	and try a lot of time to like you know
S0466	invite them in and
S0454	friends invite them in but
S0466	they didn't want to
S0454	no
S0466	or maybe i don't know maybe grandma do
S0454	no but even now
S0466	oh yeah
S0454	cos go round last week and have a glass of wine with them
S0466	oh that's nice
S0454	mm
S0466	oh cos they quite like er i think i think they know
S0454	mm okay
S0466	some of the children
S0454	oh that's nice
S0466	mm
S0454	yeah apparently they live all their all their life in that house so they know all the history of
S0466	mm
S0454	highlands and that's kind of cool
S0466	yeah that be cool
S0454	so say she'd email us all and tell us about it
S0466	oh yeah
S0454	that's kind of cool isn't it
S0466	yeah i'd love to see some old photos or like you know the stories
S0454	yeah at least know the stories
S0466	what yeah cos it's so grand it must have have quite a thing
S0454	yeah all those stable and
S0466	something like nobility yeah
S0454	yeah and the servants like
S0466	yeah
S0454	i wonder where the servants live i don't really understand that
S0466	er
S0454	do you think they live out cos not all servants live in do they
S0466	no
S0454	do doesn't really seem like there's a servant's room you know like servants' quarter
S0466	no there be the room the bell come the bell come through into the kitchen didn't they
S0454	yeah so that suggest actually
S0466	they hang around
S0454	the servants didn't live in the build because in like lanhydrock when we go there they have bell the servants' quarter in the bedrooms
S0466	oh yeah okay
S0454	so they'd know if they be ever need
S0466	yeah
S0454	but yeah the only small bedrooms be the ones next to the bathrooms aren't they
S0466	yeah but then they seem a bite close
S0454	they're
S0466	to the family
S0454	that's what i think i think they're too close
S0466	cos they're normally separate out
S0454	yeah and then it's obvious the stable have never be convert into room
S0466	mm mm and there's the coal shed but that wouldn't have be a room that's
S0454	no
S0466	i think that's pretty much a coal shed
S0454	yeah so i don't think they do live in they probably
S0466	no
S0454	live in the village didn't they
S0466	yeah and then come up for day shift
S0454	yeah which be nice i guess they have a bite of privacy
S0466	yeah have you do you have you watch downton abbey
S0454	no
S0466	oh
S0454	i keep mean to watch it though
S0466	it be good i that's a shame i've probably just delete all the
S0454	oh
S0466	copy i have i be run out of space i need a bigger hard drive
S0454	mm
S0466	but it's very good and you can get it on like netflix or
S0454	yeah
S0466	one of those things
S0454	yeah yeah i should yeah i mean to download load of stuff on my laptop before i leave but i haven't whoop
S0466	mm
S0454	never mind
S0466	no it's really good i've watch all of them quite addictive
S0454	yeah i get a bite more into tv this time cos i i watch erm
S0466	what in
S0454	all of humans do you watch that
S0466	oh i just saw an advert on a bus be it channel four
S0454	yeah
S0466	no i haven't see it what's it about
S0454	it's finish though
S0466	oh i could get it on 4od anyway
S0454	oh okay there's only like six episodes
S0466	oh
S0454	so it's quite cool because a lot of sci fi focus on technology
S0466	mm
S0454	and it's a bite sort of techy isn't it but this be quite cool cos it focus on the humans
S0466	uhu
S0454	and their reaction to technology so it's basically about androids that they're robots but they they've be design to look exactly like humans
S0466	oh
S0454	so yeah and the
S0466	that's
S0454	so the father you know the typical family the mum's really busy she hasn't get really time to do everything the house be a mess
S0466	uhu
S0454	and they never get to spend time together
S0466	uhu
S0454	so the father without speak to his wife like go out
S0466	oh
S0454	and buy this robot
S0466	oh
S0454	and the kid be really excite the little kid's really excite and of course the robot come home and do everything brilliantly
S0466	mm
S0454	like everything's clean she work out how they like their coffee and she remember it
S0466	okay
S0454	and just everything's perfect and the wife react really badly of course cos she feel
S0466	yeah that's fair enough yeah
S0454	she doesn't have like a purpose
S0466	okay
S0454	in the house and she object to it and then the teenage daughter's really anti robots just on principle so she hat it
S0466	right
S0454	and try to hack it and be like
S0466	oh
S0454	basically abuse this robot except robots don't feel do they
S0466	no
S0454	so what's the problem
S0466	yeah
S0454	and then yeah the son end up fancy her
S0466	oh okay
S0454	like the fifteen year old son cos she's really beautiful
S0466	mm
S0454	er so he get really upset about how it's be treat
S0466	oh right okay
S0454	anyway yeah they get they take it back to the shop cos the family don't agree but the son get so upset that he like chase after them and nearly die in a car crash
S0466	oh
S0454	but somehow the robot save them
S0466	that sound quite good
S0454	yeah yeah
S0466	mm
S0454	so this it's nice it's look at the human side and then it turn out it's not a normal robot it's one of like only five in the world where they're sentient and they can feel
S0466	oh it's like a
S0454	so they're like yeah
S0466	oh
S0454	they've be abuse this robot so then
S0466	mm
S0454	how do that change the dynamic that's like a person
S0466	quite different
S0454	yeah no the police be after them
S0466	oh
S0454	why be they after them yeah it's quite cool
S0466	oh i i wanna watch that
S0454	and i like the fact that they focus on the human relationships
S0466	yeah
S0454	yeah cos it's different it's very few things have do that have they
S0466	that's right one film though which if you like that you'd like we watch it
S0454	mm
S0466	at the begin of the year it's call ex machina
S0454	oh okay
S0466	and it be quite similar it's erm no it's different but it's it's a new robot it's be develop its artificial intelligence
S0454	mm
S0466	this guy and and he get and employ for his company to fly out
S0454	mm
S0466	and he just just to interact with it for a week
S0454	yeah
S0466	to test it
S0454	okay
S0466	erm but it's smart it's a bite like that you know it's self learn and so on
S0454	yeah
S0466	and it's really just i won't ruin the story but follow their interaction and
S0454	mm
S0466	he he start to fall in love with it as well
S0454	oh
S0466	and but it be all the machine be very clever cos the machine didn't fall in love back but imitate fall in love back
S0454	right
S0466	as a ploy to escape
S0454	oh
S0466	it's a very clever erm
S0454	that's clever
S0466	show how the machine you know be one or two step ahead and
S0454	yeah
S0466	you know
S0454	yeah
S0466	so yeah
S0454	but yeah it's good
S0466	oh it's a good one but it's a good film
S0454	mm
S0466	i like it
S0454	that's cool and then i watch erm this programme reality tv which i normally hate but this one be quite cool because it be a cool concept it be like people who get to like late thirties forties or early thirties even and hadn't find love
S0466	uhu
S0454	and then they have to they put their faith in these erm like scientists psychologists and they're suppose to match them to someone
S0466	oh
S0454	through psychological profile dna analysis and all of this just science though pure science
S0466	be this the one where they get marry
S0454	yeah and they have to get marry
S0466	oh yeah
S0454	without have see each other
S0466	what do you think
S0454	oh it be cool
S0466	i watch one episode
S0454	i think there be only three episodes ever
S0466	i couldn't believe they be get marry
S0454	oh they do
S0466	but i didn't but you can nullify marriage within like
S0454	yeah
S0466	two months can't you
S0454	yeah exactly so that's what they do
S0466	yeah
S0454	so they have five weeks
S0466	oh okay
S0454	to and then if they didn't like each other yeah it would basically be i don't know if they have to divorce or it be annul or what
S0466	just yeah cancel yeah
S0454	mm
S0466	but so how do it go cos i only saw the one episode they be start
S0454	yeah
S0466	explain it
S0454	disastrous they be
S0466	all of them
S0454	in the end they only they have millions of people apply like
S0466	yeah
S0454	tens of thousands
S0466	couldn't believe so many
S0454	and they only match three pair which sound rubbish doesn't it like
S0466	really out of that many
S0454	yeah they only match three
S0466	oh
S0454	so that be
S0466	but they they have to be a really high
S0454	yeah
S0466	success rate
S0454	they go really really high to to make it work and then of those three couple one pull out before the marriage
S0466	oh
S0454	cos the girl kind of get cold feet and her family didn't approve so she be that be out
S0466	when she when she meet him
S0454	no
S0466	no
S0454	they weren't allow to meet before the wed
S0466	at all yeah
S0454	so then there be two couple leave and they do go through with it but yeah one be disastrous and
S0466	yeah
S0454	there be the the husband he just stop communicate with her it be just all an act
S0466	oh
S0454	like the wed look really good and it look like they be get on in the honeymoon
S0466	then he just
S0454	but then he just
S0466	go back to his true self
S0454	as soon as yeah and then it turn out
S0466	yeah
S0454	he be like on tinder look
S0466	oh no
S0454	for a new partner and her friend find out
S0466	oh
S0454	and tell and that be the end
S0466	yeah
S0454	and they never even say goodbye
S0466	oh okay
S0454	so that be really bad
S0466	yeah
S0454	and then the other couple get on fine and they be still together at the end after five weeks and they
S0466	oh really
S0454	that's how they end it
S0466	oh
S0454	i think that be the last one in the series
S0466	wow
S0454	but i guess they'll do another series it be quite cool because
S0466	yeah
S0454	you know in the middle east like arrange marriage be
S0454	still the way it's do but it's not erm blind like that normally
S0466	okay
S0454	like they do normally meet like normally it's the parent and the brothers and the sisters be out kind of look for a man like the girl will say i wanna get marry
S0466	yeah
S0454	and then they'll all kind of look for someone suitable amongst their network
S0466	yeah
S0454	you know like someone's cousin or a friend of a friend
S0466	yeah
S0454	and then they kind of vet him like secretly from afar so they'll like ask question
S0466	yeah
S0454	and then
S0466	if they're
S0454	if it's all okay then they invite him to the house and the girl's invite into the room and they this normally in very strict families they wouldn't even get that but yeah they'll get a chance to kind of talk and then
S0466	yeah
S0454	in more modern families they might be allow to communicate by email or even phone
S0466	oh okay
S0454	but generally not in the gulf
S0466	oh
S0454	and yeah but she's still allow to say no she can
S0466	oh right
S0454	even when they meet she could say
S0466	it's
S0454	i don't like him so it's not a force marriage
S0466	find another one yeah
S0454	yeah and then they'll just bring another one and that can go on for age
S0466	yeah
S0454	but what's a bite nasty in the gulf be it's link with money
S0466	i be gonna say i think inevitably it's gonna be link to status and money
S0454	so well there's dowry payments so
S0466	oh right
S0454	the guy have to actually pay and the
S0466	oh
S0454	the girls like for whatever reason or maybe it's the family i'm never quite sure go for the highest bidder
S0466	mm
S0454	so then that's nasty
S0466	that's not good
S0454	that become something else then
S0466	yeah
S0454	but i i don't like that idea it's not about them as a person
S0466	no i think if it's arrange like that but not to do with money
S0454	mm
S0466	you know i can kind of understand it work cos it happen all the time you introduce friends oh you'll get on great with this person
S0454	yeah i think you do it informally anyway
S0466	and it can you often pull people together
S0454	yeah
S0466	yeah
S0454	yeah and it's not force that she can say no but yeah the money thing i think i've talk to a lot of guy about that and then say oh you know i'm gonna get engage and then it wouldn't work out and i'd say why and they would say it be usually the money they just
S0466	mm
S0454	ask for so much like they're really greedy
S0466	who and who get the money the family
S0454	the bride get it
S0466	the bride
S0454	but i wonder how much be actually give back to her parent
S0466	yeah
S0454	yeah it seem quite dodgy
S0466	cos if the bride get it and then they get marry don't they have fifty fifty anyway
S0454	no it's all hers
S0466	oh they get sort of
S0454	yeah so that's kind of cos in the past when there be no welfare state if they be divorce or if the husband die
S0466	oh
S0454	she would have be leave penniless
S0466	oh yeah with nothing
S0454	and possibly with kid to bring up so that be her way of
S0466	it's a security
S0454	her way of survive
S0466	yeah
S0454	like a divorce but nowadays that doesn't make sense because there
S0466	no
S0454	there be welfare and the state wouldn't let you know you starve to death
S0466	no
S0454	but yeah the money's hers it whatever happen
S0466	oh no it seem so weird though like it's well pay
S0454	it's not it doesn't in the past
S0466	and then to the highest bidder that's kind of weird
S0454	yeah it have a reason but now it just seem to be like money grab for money's sake
S0466	mm
S0454	and then like the divorce rate's really really high in the gulf
S0466	be it
S0454	and you're like yeah well that's part of the reason cos you go for the highest bidder not like
S0466	yeah
S0454	the one who's gonna make you happy
S0466	do you think that's do you think some people be just go for the money and then get the money and then get divorce cos they get to keep the money
S0454	i wonder about that
S0466	some
S0454	yeah
S0466	and be it just doesn't work out and because you know
S0454	yeah i wonder that
S0466	they didn't go for the person they like yeah
S0454	and they don't get the chance to really get to know each other in most case in the gulf
S0466	yeah
S0454	like it be literally like they walk in a room oh he look nice
S0466	yeah
S0454	he's get quite a lot of money
S0466	yeah
S0454	and it's just do on that not like i mean i guess in an ideal world they'd get to like court wouldn't they
S0466	yeah
S0454	but yeah they weren't really allow that
S0466	yeah
S0454	i don't know if it will change the divorce rate be really high like
S0466	i'm surprise i didn't think it would be so cos
S0454	yeah you wouldn't think so and they never publish their divorce figure
S0466	oh right
S0454	like but yeah it's crazy crazy high mm
S0466	mm
S0454	yeah it's weird i reckon a lot of them though the family pressure them to get marry the boys and the girls so they get marry to keep them happy know they can get divorce within like a year or so
S0466	yeah
S0454	and then they can kind of be with probably the person they've love all their life you know they've get someone else in mind
S0466	in the back of their mind
S0454	until they've do for the marriage then then they're not gonna be allow to marry them
S0466	yeah
S0454	i reckon that's what
S0466	and get the money
S0454	really happen
S0466	and the
S0454	yeah
S0466	that's a shame
S0454	yeah yeah and there's a lot of cheat like it's really rife with the guy
S0466	men and women cheat or
S0454	i don't know about the women
S0466	yeah
S0454	i don't think so with the woman cos yeah that would be really
S0466	i can imagine that would be
S0454	shameful
S0466	very yeah
S0454	and that yeah
S0466	yeah very
S0454	but with the men oh it's really awful
S0466	oh okay
S0454	just
S0466	just can't
S0454	but they don't love their wife they marry her for kind of family reason and
S0466	yeah
S0454	they don't really get on a lot of the time you know when
S0466	it's strange
S0454	yeah
S0466	live together
S0454	and then they might not
S0466	it's strange isn't it
S0454	want to get divorce because of the sort of stigma
S0466	yeah
S0454	and maybe they've get load of young kid
S0466	yeah
S0454	yeah it's not very nice
S0466	yeah a bite bizarre
S0454	mm and then i suppose if you just segregate the sex then you can't really expect people to have like a normal marriage afterwards you know
S0466	that's true
S0454	cos they don't know how to relate to each other
S0466	oh cos they're segregate you mean just with social situations and yeah
S0454	yeah so then the first time they have a like a non family member it's their wife if they've never spend time with
S0466	yeah
S0454	so then it's gonna be awkward isn't it
S0466	yes it be very strange yeah
S0454	for both side
S0466	yeah yeah
S0454	especially in the uae where it's even more segregate at least in oman secondary school education be mix
S0466	oh be it
S0454	so even though they didn't really talk to each like you must
S0466	at least see they you be around them
S0454	passively like have to like observe and see like okay they're not alien and
S0466	yeah
S0454	you know there'd be something wouldn't there
S0466	yeah
S0454	but yeah if you don't even have that
S0466	that be strange
S0454	yeah then you've yeah it must be really weird
S0466	yeah the money thing's weird i think have to pay some payment like a a dowry er with get engage
S0454	really
S0466	yeah
S0454	be you serious
S0466	i be so sure of it well i i don't think be joke she say like
S0454	mm
S0466	the the the dad
S0454	maybe it's a west african thing
S0466	yeah the dad want a farm but he end up buy a herd of cow instead something like that so maybe it's more
S0454	oh
S0466	it's not like you have to give me this but it's probably maybe good practice to get a like a gift or something
S0454	oh that's really interest isn't it
S0466	yeah i'm she tell me that and i don't think she be joke
S0454	yeah yeah i think it be common in a lot of culture still
S0466	mm
S0454	but yeah you kind of think that should end
S0466	yeah
S0454	like that's a
S0466	it really be
S0454	outdated practice
S0466	to be
S0454	and it's gonna be abuse these days
S0466	yeah
S0454	very interest
S0466	it's funny in life though how much like cos you think we don't live in like split society of money or whatever and everything's equal and all that
S0454	yeah
S0466	but really it's not like
S0454	no
S0466	i mean it the world be open to anything
S0454	mm
S0466	but like at work i look around and like people who i work with be my age and a hugely disproportionate number of people be from private school
S0454	really
S0466	oh yeah
S0454	me and yeah we be
S0466	er yeah
S0454	talk about that like how
S0466	and
S0454	some industries it's still so close isn't it
S0454	even in the uk
S0466	yeah or or i think they're just you know the money just prepare them for
S0454	mm
S0466	interview and be extroverted and all that kind of thing which
S0454	or even just apply have the confidence to apply
S0466	yeah exactly
S0454	because can you remember be in a secondary school and someone say to you you could be a doctor or a lawyer
S0466	no the school
S0454	no one ever say it to you
S0466	really oh
S0454	but i think it's maybe the expectations be so much lower
S0466	yeah
S0454	and that's ridiculous because you've get
S0466	yeah
S0454	students who be straight as
S0466	yeah that's
S0454	like you be
S0466	really bad in school
S0454	and you never get take aside by the career advisor and
S0466	no and say oh you need to do this
S0454	say you need you need to be think about these career
S0466	yeah
S0454	this be what you could be earn do you know what that mean
S0466	yeah no nothing i i think the school's be awful actually
S0454	yeah it be ridiculous
S0466	it be terrible and i've say that in front of dad cos i think it be really bad
S0454	mm
S0466	erm like my work experience i work er because i want to be a programmer i work in a stationary shop just cos they sell computers i mean what work experience be that
S0454	yeah
S0466	it be like nothing else be even available or yeah it be just poor i think
S0454	yeah and maybe they should force you to set your own up a bite more like
S0466	yeah yeah
S0454	they should say like this be the list we've get available or you can contact your own and probably
S0466	yeah like give you advice how to do that and stuff
S0454	yeah and that's quite useful like business skill
S0466	mm
S0454	in itself isn't it
S0466	mm
S0454	how do you approach a business like the write a formal letter or a formal email
S0466	yeah
S0454	erm yeah that kind of stuff
S0466	but yeah the expectation of school be just like
S0454	but that's the main thing
S0466	you're gonna go and work at tesco basically er
S0454	yeah the expectations be low
S0466	and it be rare if you say you want to go to uni most people wouldn't didn't say that or
S0454	yeah
S0466	didn't didn't plan to go
S0454	that be sad and like say like in journalism it's all private school it's ridiculous
S0466	oh really
S0454	and like those be the people write the news
S0466	yeah
S0454	but they're not
S0466	such a skew view
S0466	yeah yeah
S0454	yeah they're not representative of anybody like just this very narrow even the tabloids it's the same it's not just the broadsheets
S0466	oh right
S0454	so like yeah that's about politics another one like
S0466	oh yeah sure
S0454	it's suppose to be broader now but i mean look at it like it's clearly not
S0466	well i mean look who
S0454	there's more women sure
S0466	yeah
S0454	but that be about it isn't it they
S0466	yeah i mean look look at the powerful people in government you know george osborne david cameron
S0454	yeah all
S0466	boris you know
S0454	oxford
S0466	they're all from yeah
S0454	eton
S0466	the same club
S0454	yeah
S0466	it's not good
S0454	yeah that's weird
S0466	yeah
S0454	but yeah they need to
S0466	it's sad the way that it be now
S0454	to push people more
S0466	yeah
S0454	in cambridge when i go there that be ridiculous they be all from like local private school and daddy this daddy that like
S0466	yeah
S0454	yeah pity but also that we're quite we're not very good at let older people move sideways into new job even though we work for so much longer like there's not many job where they actively encourage older people to retrain
S0466	mm
S0454	and they need to teach be one of the few where they will be quite happy to see someone who's work in say engineer move across into teach
S0466	mm
S0454	and they think that add something but most
S0466	yeah yeah
S0454	it's gonna be impossible for you
S0466	yeah
S0454	because of the cost involve
S0466	yeah
S0454	like
S0466	and thirty years of experience you've miss
S0454	yeah yeah but they need to have more like kind of like apprenticeships almost for
S0466	oh yeah for
S0454	doctor or engineer at a different point in
S0466	yeah yeah
S0454	people's career so yes
S0466	yeah
S0454	you you don't deserve to get a full wage obviously
S0466	no no but still
S0454	when you're train but obviously you've get to eat and live so you're
S0466	yeah
S0454	gonna need a minimum wage job and that
S0466	yeah
S0454	yeah
S0466	and and you'll learn quickly and you'll contribute
S0454	you're gonna learn
S0466	in other ways from your other career
S0454	yeah
S0466	yeah
S0454	i think so
S0466	yeah oh i think that like well i notice my job it's really like well i don't mean in term of private school but like once you're in the industry you're in the industry and that's the club and there's no there's no like civil engineer come in from
S0454	mm
S0466	design build you can't get in
S0454	yeah that's worry
S0466	once you're in
S0454	isn't it
S0466	yeah well it's kind of nice for me cos you get these job and things oh we need someone with offshore experience i mean great but
S0454	yeah
S0466	it's strange
S0454	it be weird
S0466	i don't see the need engineer yeah they'll have to catch up and stuff but
S0454	mm
S0466	you've still get the same core skills
S0454	yeah it's very narrow
S0466	mm
S0454	mm so do you think you'll stay in engineer
S0466	i don't think forever no
S0454	no cos you've get your business ideas
S0466	no i don't have any ideas at the moment that's the problem
S0454	oh
S0466	like property and stuff but
S0454	yeah you should talk to i think cos kind of someone who's be successful and
S0466	yeah
S0454	move out of a good career
S0466	mm
S0454	and make you know another good career
S0466	yeah
S0454	and do something he
S0466	something he be more passionate about
S0454	exactly he be more passionate about
S0466	yeah that's the issue it's like i i like my job and stuff i'm not that passionate and i want
S0454	yeah
S0466	i want a job that i'm quite passionate about
S0454	mm i mean i guess ideally you want consult but that take years before you can get to that point doesn't it
S0466	yeah yeah
S0454	that's the ideal world where you don't really work that long on project
S0466	yeah
S0454	and then you just take six months off
S0466	yeah that's right
S0454	go and live somewhere cheap but yeah that's not easy to arrange
S0466	no so i think sometimes i do really like engineer and i think like oh that could be quite good and
S0454	mm
S0466	enjoy it but then other time like i think my core engineer isn't as good as it could be but i think it's just cos i'm not that interest in like do all the maths and stuff
S0454	yeah
S0466	you know er yeah i think i'll certainly keep go for another few years
S0454	mm
S0466	i think business idea and kick start it off in the background part time
S0454	mm yeah that's a good idea
S0466	i think sort of thing
S0454	yeah that's the way to do it isn't it
S0466	uhu
S0454	start it off and see how it go and then
S0466	yeah
S0454	yeah if you lose that money okay it's annoy but
S0466	it's not the end of the world
S0454	it's not the end of the world
S0466	no do you want some more lasagne
S0454	er no i'm full actually but thank you be you gonna have more
S0466	no
S0454	no it be nice really good
S0466	mm
S0454	mm very nice
S0466	yeah
S0454	meal
S0466	it amaze me how there's so many people from private school i think it's mad
S0454	yeah
S0466	i have someone in the canteen a few weeks ago and he drive me nut he be so annoy he be like he be he be from scotland and er he be basically try to show off at the table he i wasn't eat with him he be on the next table about how like he's he he build he build it himself you know it be it be him he do it er but basically this be the story be he go to private school his mummy and daddy give him they pay for his backpack afterwards
S0454	oh come on
S0466	and buy him and pay for the deposit he be like yeah after that i just do it all myself and that's what i want for my kid it's like most people don't have that it's ridiculous
S0454	yeah that be ridiculous
S0466	i mean so annoy
S0454	yeah
S0466	i mean we we're lucky too cos we get through uni and most people don't
S0454	yeah
S0466	and yeah but some people have handouts for a long time like you know for property buy for them
S0454	yeah
S0466	that sort of thing yeah
S0454	that's true
S0466	i don't think that's need but yeah it's quite a split world isn't it
S0454	yeah it be and it's get worse like the rich get richer and the
S0466	yeah
S0454	well i don't know if the poor get poorer but definitely the rich and the poor the when you look at graph
S0466	split
S0454	and it's not just the uk be it like the us be terrible
S0466	oh the us be awful oh well especially the whole top one percent thing
S0454	yeah i don't know what they can do about that
S0466	mm
S0454	i mean cos they'd say if you tax them more then they'll just go elsewhere
S0466	mm
S0454	which be always a risk
S0466	yeah
S0454	too bad
S0466	yeah
S0454	mm
S0466	it's erm i think it's only set to get worse because
S0454	i think so
S0466	if the
S0454	it feel like it whenever there's a credit crunch the rich never
S0466	seem to do well
S0454	really suffer in fact if anything they do better
S0466	cos you
S0454	more people rent
S0466	cos they take advantage of
S0454	or like you know yeah take advantage of people like okay your house be be
S0466	or the situation
S0454	repossess
S0466	get it on the cheap you can afford to invest and
S0454	yeah
S0466	yeah
S0454	that's right
S0466	yeah
S0454	it's a good time to invest
S0466	yeah
S0454	yeah that's true
S0466	yeah but i think well with technology there be two train of think one be that well we won't have to do any kind of bore manual work great that'll all be provide for free but the other train of think which i think be more true be that those who can own the machine and the technology will do really well cos they don't need to employ people
S0454	mm
S0466	but then there then there would be no job there'd be no low skilled job
S0454	and that's in a way have already happen
S0466	and that's happen you look at an
S0454	there's
S0466	an amazon warehouse they're
S0454	yeah
S0466	you know
S0454	or swindon with the car factories where
S0466	oh yeah
S0454	you use to employ like hundreds of people and now it employ like less than ten on a shift and it's
S0466	it's crazy
S0454	these massive robots and that's be go on for age
S0466	yeah
S0454	but i remember go in there and them show us
S0466	oh
S0454	and it be really impressive it's not men any more like stand in a line and do one thing after another
S0466	it's just a machine
S0454	it's just a machine do it
S0466	mm
S0454	and someone operate it
S0466	it's inevitable but yeah only the rich corporations or rich people can own these machine or
S0454	yeah but then what happen like mass unemployment
S0466	yeah then there's the few people ceos as you see get pay you know five hundred million a year
S0454	yeah
S0466	or whatever stupid sum and there's just this huge yeah and i think with technology anyway well the like of all these web company and stuff
S0454	yeah
S0466	they they basically have a market that reach the whole world
S0454	mm
S0466	the ceo of you know facebook
S0454	true
S0466	er say yeah
S0454	yeah it's interest you wonder what will happen
S0466	it's so global it just need like one person and you can sell that for
S0454	mm
S0466	they be rich enough to invest or wise enough yeah i don't know
S0454	i don't
S0466	i don't know what'll happen don't see it get much better
S0454	no although at the moment labour be cheap enough in some part of the world that the technology although it's there
S0466	yeah yeah
S0454	it mean not yeah like in the middle east they could mechanise a lot of stuff but they don't because they know
S0466	mm
S0454	it's cheaper to have the man go and turn the sprinkler on and off
S0466	yeah
S0454	three time a day
S0466	yeah
S0454	than to have an automatic system
S0466	bother do it
S0454	with a timer
S0466	yeah
S0454	because that cost money and
S0466	mad isn't it
S0454	that guy doesn't cost anything and he's replaceable
S0466	yeah well that's good for labour and if they're treat well
S0454	yeah i'm not sure they be
S0466	no i'm not sure they be
S0454	but yeah i guess that will take quite a long time before in some part of the world
S0466	yeah
S0454	like people get replace
S0466	mm i think our world like we've all we've all be use to live in a richer country for years
S0454	mm
S0466	you know the western world but er i think that's gonna be it's go downhill well it already be i think
S0454	mm
S0466	cos i think well there's you know i think the only reason some of these countries have do well be through not exploit but through use of cheaper labour or
S0454	yeah well yeah
S0466	that's fine it's business
S0454	definitely well britain's definitely go down
S0466	yeah and it's get load of
S0454	look at our manufacture
S0466	yeah exactly
S0454	like our clothe be make in bangladesh but
S0466	yeah
S0454	we all know like they're not exactly get minimum wage be they
S0466	no
S0454	and the safety condition be terrible
S0466	but that advantage be disappear
S0454	mm with mechanisation like
S0466	yeah yeah but also these countries so we you know we we use to be high tech and develop these things at high cost and make high profit that's be our model for
S0454	yeah
S0466	twenty years i suppose but now that that's go as well
S0454	yeah
S0466	and can make the high tech stuff just as well so
S0454	yeah that's true
S0466	and we've lose
S0454	but china's yeah i see what
S0466	lose our identity a little bite
S0454	but there's still a lot of develop countries china can't really be
S0466	yeah
S0454	be call a develop country
S0466	oh no no no that's right
S0454	in the past we use to say like develop develop
S0466	yeah
S0454	but it's too simple now
S0466	yeah
S0454	there's like things in between
S0466	scale
S0454	or what do they call them like the brics or the rics the
S0466	i think brics
S0454	like recently industrialise
S0466	brazil russia and india
S0454	yeah
S0466	yeah
S0454	yeah
S0466	yeah i mean
S0454	so it's too simplistic
S0466	brics mm
S0454	yeah there's ric and there's bric isn't there i think bric be the
S0466	what's ric recently industrialise country
S0454	yeah and then i think it include russia india china with the
S0466	ah
S0454	and then
S0466	and then there's bric it's brazil
S0454	brazil brazil yeah
S0466	yeah
S0454	mm but i dunno like with farm there's always be two school of think about farm and overpopulation like if the world population keep on increase
S0466	mm
S0454	then we're gonna have mass famine
S0466	yeah
S0454	because the world can only support x many people
S0466	yeah the
S0454	that's call the malthus there be this guy call malthusian principle say that
S0466	okay
S0454	and then there's another school of think and that's pretty old that's like hundreds of years old that guy's
S0466	right
S0454	er hundreds of years ago and then there's this other woman interestingly who come along you know eighteen hundreds and say that's wrong
S0466	oh
S0454	boserup this be and she say technology necessity be the mother of all invention
S0466	mm
S0454	and technology will surpass every time the the like the world get to its carry capacity for food versus
S0466	oh it resolve it
S0454	population it will resolve itself because it's a necessity and that will breed innovation and to date
S0466	mm
S0454	she's probably be right like india be say to have this mass famine accord to the malthusian model
S0466	okay
S0454	and it never ever happen
S0466	they manage to
S0454	because the green revolution come along and then they have all these like dwarf varieties of wheat which
S0466	oh
S0454	grow much quicker and they have
S0466	oh okay
S0454	fertiliser and they have this and it's not without problems cos they've also have pollution
S0466	yeah and and we innovate now with gm and everything
S0454	yeah exactly and now
S0466	i mean you can do you can grow meat
S0454	yeah so we've get the this be the green revolution and now they're call this one the g revolution
S0466	ah okay
S0454	but the inevitably there'll be something else won't there
S0466	yeah
S0454	and all of these have problems but we've never reach a point of global starvation and i don't think we ever will because look at like the capacity you have even in cities for urban farm which people be experiment with like
S0466	ah
S0454	use rooftops to grow food or warehouse there's such a lot of empty space
S0466	yeah the city could almost be self sustain
S0454	it could like
S0466	almost
S0454	if you look at the rafter
S0466	there's a lot of space
S0454	you know in house like everyone's get that space for nothing
S0466	yeah
S0454	and that could grow mushroom say
S0466	oh right yeah
S0454	or water where you know the japanese have much more intensively do aquaculture
S0466	oh
S0454	and grow mussels and oyster
S0466	oh
S0454	on just little raft
S0466	okay
S0454	float on the sea but the turnover be phenomenal like so if you just want to produce protein
S0466	you could could you
S0454	you could in a very small body of seawater
S0466	oh
S0454	so yeah
S0466	yeah
S0454	i kind of feel like we'll never reach carry capacity and it's nonsense to only talk about farmland disappear
S0466	space yeah
S0454	because even in the desert now with like where there's no soil it's all like hydroponics right
S0466	right
S0454	and it's cheap it be economical like there a bunch of herbs be ten p here you'll pay at least one pound fifty for the same bunch
S0466	oh right
S0454	and that's grow in soil so
S0466	oh that's interest
S0454	there there be a kind of
S0466	yeah
S0454	you know it's not an economic argument to say that it can't be do
S0466	no you put yourself i think by use technology like all hydroponics and stuff
S0454	mm
S0466	the risk be that you you put yourself in quite a precarious like food like food be available i mean but it's more precarious like it's reliant on technology
S0454	yeah
S0466	so if one's er something go wrong everything fall down kind of thing
S0454	mm
S0466	whereas if we're just grow on farmland it's not really interconnect and so on
S0454	but it's interconnect in other ways like bad weather
S0466	yeah
S0454	whereas you could say in a greenhouse
S0466	yeah true you can control that
S0454	that can be more control so you
S0466	yeah
S0454	you don't really have a a bad weather year
S0466	no
S0454	where the apples fail but
S0466	yeah
S0454	but yeah i guess technology could fail and the greenhouse i dunno
S0466	yeah
S0454	break or whatever and like yeah and obviously
S0466	yeah
S0454	in the desert that would be disastrous if your cool system didn't work
S0466	yeah
S0454	then it can't be do
S0466	yeah
S0454	but it be amaze
S0466	see you're more
S0454	the
S0466	like mm
S0454	the greenhouses now we've get in the uk like east anglia they grow them like vertically tomatoes
S0466	oh
S0454	and it's just phenomenal like the turnover
S0466	and how quick they can do it
S0454	yeah
S0466	oh wow
S0454	yeah like just mass and mass and like
S0466	that's cool that
S0454	machine for harvest as well
S0466	very well yeah industrial farming's be industrial for age
S0454	yeah it have in a way it be probably the first thing that get industrialise wasn't it
S0466	yeah
S0454	but we're still deal with the fallout from that
S0466	in what what way
S0454	like farm farmers not make money
S0466	oh
S0454	and like
S0466	mm
S0454	yeah it get so cheap to mass produce that
S0466	yeah i see what you mean
S0454	small farmers get push out
S0466	yeah
S0454	and it's now just sort of big agro business isn't it
S0466	yeah yeah huge interest there's erm i don't know where i saw this it be on tv some documentary er about the human race the human brain
S0454	mm
S0466	and it periods in history where it's know there's be a huge issue like the ice age or you know a huge a threat to the human race they find that the human brain erm or the skull have increase in size
S0454	oh that's interest
S0466	there's there's a direct correlation
S0454	mm
S0466	so it's an increase er well they think an increase in brain power essentially so when you need to survive when there's a
S0454	yeah
S0466	real threat your brain kind of accommodate it and it get bigger and they get more intelligent
S0454	that make sense that's very boserup kind of
S0466	oh be it
S0454	extend
S0466	yeah yeah like yeah
S0454	you know idea about necessity and invention but also a necessity in evolution yeah i remember read
S0466	it's quite interest
S0454	you know traditionally we think of evolution happen very slowly which it probably do
S0466	but it might be more spurt
S0454	but there seem to be yeah it seem to be that the main like mutations have actually occur when a serious threat's occur
S0466	oh really so there's a theme there
S0454	yeah
S0466	yeah
S0454	which make sense doesn't it
S0466	i don't know do it i don't know how do that fit into random mutations though
S0454	cos there be always random mutations but
S0466	yeah
S0454	but perhaps there's no advantage to have
S0466	oh that's true
S0454	a random mutation so there's no reason for it to be select naturally select
S0466	that's true but when there's a threat
S0454	but if say there be a threat
S0466	ah
S0454	and you randomly mutate and that one's smarter
S0466	yes
S0454	then you're more likely to get through that and there'll be a sort of bottleneck where
S0466	that's true
S0454	anyone who's a bite thicker and couldn't work out how to do it
S0466	doesn't get through
S0454	die off
S0466	yeah
S0454	yeah that kind of make sense to me
S0466	that make sense and if let's say you know seventy percent of the population die during those threats
S0454	yeah
S0466	that make a lot of sense cos the the thirty percent with that mutation will go through and then suddenly that's a whole population
S0454	yeah
S0466	that's like succeed right
S0454	yeah no it make sense to me
S0466	it do make sense yeah
S0454	mm a kind of bottleneck like an evolutionary bottleneck
S0466	yeah
S0454	mm
S0466	i do my dissertation on genetic algorithms
S0454	do you
S0466	yeah
S0454	oh oh that's cool
S0466	really interest it be
S0454	oh
S0466	it be on so genetic algorithm be a an algorithm but you it's basically it's a you have a problem you want to solve if
S0454	mm
S0466	you let the computer solve it through natural selection
S0454	oh okay
S0466	of the population of random initial solutions
S0454	yeah
S0466	erm that's er er so that's cool so you kind of have to your chromosome and stuff so i i i be interest so be my lecturer on how it how you could apply it to civil engineer problems so
S0454	oh
S0466	they're normally multi objective or multi erm yeah multi objective problems
S0454	mm
S0466	where like there's no just simple formula
S0454	yeah
S0466	so i think what's a good one and i think well tidal turbines
S0454	yeah
S0466	but a tidal of so a whole fleet of thirty underwater wind turbines basically
S0454	mm
S0466	and there be so many factor in what in what essentially be a profitable one it would be the speed of the water the interaction on one to another
S0454	yeah
S0466	local effect even the length of cable that you need so it's such a
S0454	yeah
S0466	complex thing and and they all interact with each other so it be a really good one so so i have the gene be just make up of i think it be just the turbine the x on my coordinate and that's all you need
S0454	mm
S0466	so so the software generation number one just create a whole load of random coordinate and just stick a load of random turbines in the water
S0454	oh
S0466	then it would measure its fitness essentially through the mass that be what you can code be you know like cost of keep it and all that kind of stuff
S0454	yeah
S0466	and and it sorry its the first population would have a population of like say a hundred
S0454	yeah
S0466	and they would they would erm mutate
S0454	mm
S0466	and reproduce
S0454	okay
S0466	so the next one you'd pick it would would you pick the best yeah you'd pick the top fifty percent
S0454	oh okay
S0466	and then and then erm they'd breed together and then a one random mutation and then that go through to the next and so on and so on and so on
S0454	oh that's clever
S0466	and it's cool cos you could watch it on the screen and the turbines would slowly move and they would slowly line up cos that be an optimum reduction in cable then
S0454	mm
S0466	or they'd space themselves apart so there's no interaction
S0454	wow
S0466	cool
S0454	that be cool
S0466	really neat yeah
S0454	wow what's go on
S0466	dunno sound like a fire truck
S0454	yeah it do actually
S0466	yeah i find that interest
S0454	mm yeah it's cool yeah the food one interest me a lot but at the moment people talk about like the crisis but we're still throw away so much food that
S0466	well like a third or a fifth or
S0454	yeah it's
S0466	something
S0454	some crazy statistic that
S0466	yeah
S0454	it doesn't really make sense to talk about a food crisis erm in term of production
S0466	no
S0454	there be other problems like distribution sure
S0466	yeah
S0454	like but that's a localise problem
S0466	yeah
S0454	and maybe we've just get people erm in the wrong place really
S0466	mm
S0454	you know if the climate's change
S0466	well maybe
S0454	and there's drought there then that area be no longer sort of able to support a human population naturally
S0466	yeah yeah
S0454	so we shouldn't have huge megacities like
S0466	yeah like
S0454	perth or something
S0466	right
S0454	you know like that's gonna be
S0466	yeah
S0454	people need to move and it's only develop
S0466	yeah
S0454	countries that can afford
S0466	yeah
S0454	to keep people there
S0466	if you've get the money
S0454	whereas like say sudan or something
S0466	they'd never live there
S0454	they need to move those people need to go somewhere
S0454	but the problem be where do they go
S0466	yeah
S0454	but it will happen naturally like migration
S0466	yeah and it do happen
S0454	and it be happen
S0466	yeah
S0454	the migrant crisis
S0466	mm
S0454	yeah
S0466	yeah
S0454	and that will be interest to see how we cope because refugee have a very narrow definition in law like what make a refugee but we're now get the point where we've get environmental refugees like
S0466	what's that
S0454	er where
S0466	oh like flee from yeah
S0454	for example your
S0466	the condition
S0454	yeah like low lie islands in the pacific be actually be flood
S0466	oh yeah
S0454	because of local climate change but they don't actually fit our definition
S0466	no
S0454	of a refugee
S0466	but i suppose they be though
S0454	who have to be yes of course they be
S0466	they need
S0454	but the law need to change to support that because then they could claim asylum
S0466	yeah
S0454	i mean their homeland
S0466	because it's unsuitable to live
S0454	have actually be destroy
S0466	yeah
S0454	but that's an extreme example where you can show their home doesn't exist
S0466	yeah
S0454	like obviously they have to go
S0454	somewhere else but what about where it become so dry or so hot
S0466	yeah
S0454	like at what point do you say this land be no longer able to support the size of the population
S0466	yeah
S0454	and people have to leave
S0466	it's quite a hard definition quite multi
S0454	yeah exactly because it depend on a lot of factor doesn't it like
S0466	yeah
S0454	be you able to import food so then it's about economy
S0466	yeah
S0454	like it yeah
S0466	yeah cos otherwise you could claim asylum from perth
S0454	right
S0466	and it's couldn't you right
S0454	yeah
S0466	although er although actually the government would provide everything
S0454	it would have to
S0466	if you didn't have
S0454	determine it in term of food security i suppose like
S0466	yeah
S0454	but then food security could be short term problem
S0466	yeah
S0454	right like civil war but
S0466	yeah
S0454	but yeah i guess that's already cover under war the
S0466	mm
S0454	droughts aren't usually permanent they're cyclical so then at what point do you say like
S0466	how long do you live through it or
S0454	how long do they have to
S0466	should you have to for it
S0454	yeah
S0466	or yeah
S0454	mm
S0466	oh complex
S0454	it be yeah mm but urban farm i think that's a really important area like all of us should be develop like
S0466	yeah
S0454	it's still so small scale like exeter's get this really cool project where they collect coffee ground
S0466	oh yeah
S0454	this company or charity i'm not sure which from like
S0466	yes
S0454	from like coffee shop for free you know a lot of it and
S0466	and get rid of the waste
S0454	will give it for free and then they put into kind of like er sort of a sandbag kind of thing but a bite bigger
S0466	mm
S0454	and they've cut hole in the side and
S0466	oh
S0454	they
S0466	do you plant them
S0454	they plant the spores of oyster mushroom in them and they just hang them on hook in this kind of like warehouse
S0466	mm
S0454	and then they grow and they sell those back
S0466	oh cool
S0454	to supermarkets locally so that's really nice it's cyclical
S0466	yeah
S0454	because their input material be just waste
S0466	yeah
S0454	and their output be something they can sell
S0466	that's good so
S0454	and it doesn't taste
S0466	it pay for itself
S0454	yeah and as it happen they're use an empty warehouse but theoretically i guess you could use any dark place
S0466	yeah
S0454	like a ceiling in a house or
S0466	oh yeah yeah
S0454	you know in a factory where there's like rafter and
S0466	yeah
S0454	you just need like to be able to walk around and be able to harvest them but yeah i guess you can't live off mushroom but
S0466	no but you'd have many many things
S0454	yeah
S0466	yeah
S0454	i mean that's particularly good cos it doesn't need light i guess you don't have to make any conversions
S0466	yeah
S0454	to you know like most things
S0466	oh yeah
S0454	would need light
S0466	that's true
S0454	so it's not really practical to retrofit you know glass ceilings or whatever
S0466	no yeah
S0454	but lot of place have flat roof don't they like industrial units that potentially could be
S0466	cool as well
S0454	yeah a garden like school often have flat roof don't they
S0466	mm it's such a shame we don't use our roof space
S0454	yeah
S0466	isn't it
S0454	that's a waste isn't it
S0466	it's a huge space
S0454	it's a really dead space
S0466	yeah
S0454	and then you see really cool house like in scandinavia where they grass over the roof
S0466	oh i like that
S0454	as insulation
S0466	yeah
S0454	so it's a very thick layer of insulation
S0466	that's true
S0454	yeah that's cool i really like that idea
S0466	yeah
S0454	mm
S0466	in korea they do use their roof quite well there there would be garden and stuff
S0454	oh that's good
S0466	yeah
S0454	yeah and in the middle east they be you know
S0466	have of
S0454	build strong enough to not so much
S0466	oh
S0454	but they're strong enough that they put water tank and stuff
S0466	oh yeah
S0454	but they're strong you can walk on they're design to be walk on
S0466	oh that's good
S0454	whereas ours usually aren't be they
S0466	no
S0454	but
S0466	yeah
S0454	yeah i guess we just need to but that's a huge amount of space isn't it
S0466	yeah
S0454	and then there's this cool project in london i saw where they have a supermarket and they grow there's a community garden on the roof
S0466	oh right
S0454	and then they sell the produce downstairs in the supermarket
S0466	that's cool
S0454	so that's nice like really like zero
S0466	local
S0454	food miles
S0466	yeah
S0454	yeah yeah
S0466	mm i hate erm there's so much waste with like people you know everybody want a brand new kitchen every seven years
S0454	mm
S0466	and you'll so much waste i mean i do it as well in the flat but
S0454	yeah
S0466	so why it's a shame we can't reuse or recondition stuff a bite more
S0454	yeah
S0466	or put new front on rather than whole thing and all of that
S0454	it's true mm but you wonder if it's deliberate they make it like that
S0466	oh it be
S0454	so that they get more money
S0466	well ikea
S0454	if things be modular then
S0466	yeah
S0454	it
S0466	ikea deliberately make well they they basically convert the furniture market and make it something cos previously people who buy a nice wooden table and it would last
S0454	mm
S0466	like twenty years ikea make it cheap and such that it's fashionable so therefore it's in fashion and then out of fashion like
S0454	yeah
S0466	clothe right
S0454	that be good yeah
S0466	and then you have to even though they're not break you're buy new ones every three years cos they're out of fashion
S0454	yeah
S0466	they've do the same thing with their furniture
S0454	yeah
S0454	that's true yeah
S0466	you you look at old ikea stuff from ten years ago it look awful
S0454	yeah
S0466	doesn't stand up yeah
S0454	oh
S0466	the style
S0454	doesn't stand up yeah
S0466	doesn't stand up
S0454	yeah i think it's really nice the pine i like it
S0466	yeah i i just think it last
S0454	be it pine or beech
S0466	i think it's pine yeah
S0454	mm yeah it's nice yeah
S0466	erm
S0454	it look solid so these be
S0466	yeah
S0454	from a charity shop
S0466	these this be from gumtree
S0454	oh okay yeah it's really nice
S0466	these be from a charity shop
S0454	yeah
S0466	the bed be from a charity shop
S0454	oh okay
S0466	you know i like charity shop
S0454	and do you have to arrange delivery
S0466	i put this in the car
S0454	from the charity shop
S0466	but no they erm the charity shop offer delivery
S0454	do they cos there's one by
S0466	mm
S0454	bus station actually
S0466	ah
S0454	how much be this
S0466	er how much do i buy it for
S0454	mm
S0466	this and the four chair be sixty five
S0454	okay
S0466	but i'll sell
S0454	yeah
S0466	the four chair for thirty and this this be thirty five
S0454	yeah mm
S0466	and these be seven fifty each i think
S0454	okay but they'll arrange delivery if you want what for free or
S0466	no so i get
S0454	no
S0466	the bed frame and the that sideboard deliver from the same shop
S0454	mm
S0466	and the i think that be because it be third floor and it be fifteen pound for any number of items so that's quite good
S0454	ah that's good
S0466	but fifteen's not bad i think
S0454	i think fifteen's okay
S0466	cos they're carry it over here they're carry it up the stairs and
S0454	yeah
S0466	that's fair enough
S0454	no i might do that there be quite a good one i notice by the bus station yeah
S0466	and there's a really good one in call and it's for homeless people
S0454	ah okay
S0466	and and they pick up people's unwanted furniture for free
S0454	mm
S0466	and then yeah they've get a huge warehouse
S0454	oh nice
S0466	cos if you look in the charity shop there's often not much you've just get
S0454	mm
S0466	two or three items and you can't really just go there and get five things on one delivery
S0454	yeah
S0466	but this one a huge warehouse and you could pick up just you've get a choice of fifteen sofas and
S0454	oh yeah that's good
S0466	ten din table
S0454	mm
S0466	yeah you could get a lot
S0454	mm yeah pine's a nice choice though
S0466	yeah it last
S0454	i like wood
S0466	it's fairly timeless
S0454	yeah
S0466	isn't it
S0454	it's very timeless yeah
S0466	yeah
S0454	it can work with other colour
S0466	yeah
S0454	and it's a good idea to have a theme i think in the house like
S0466	do it's similar
S0454	don't you think if it's a
S0466	yeah
S0454	smaller space then it's easier to have
S0466	it's a bite
S0454	one theme like
S0466	yeah
S0454	just pine because if you start go dark wood
S0466	like
S0454	and then you move into pine
S0466	that's true
S0454	then it's not a big enough space to really carry it off
S0466	that's true and sometimes you want to actually move furniture between room occasionally
S0454	yeah that's true
S0466	or if you ever move
S0454	yeah i might try and do that keep it light
S0466	yeah
S0454	and pine be a nice light wood isn't it
S0466	yeah i think it always look nice
S0454	yeah
S0466	yeah
S0454	or i can
S0466	what
S0454	just buy from ikea in bristol and bring it down
S0466	you could the ikea's nice in a way cos you can put it all the car and
S0454	yeah it's flat pack
S0466	it's just quite simple isn't it and it look nice but i find i buy in that other flat an ikea table and
S0454	mm have you get ikea here in
S0466	yeah
S0454	oh that's good
S0466	but it er it erm it mark really the cheaper stuff mark really easily
S0454	oh okay so you know
S0466	so even now a year on it doesn't look great
S0454	yeah
S0466	erm yeah
S0454	mm
S0466	i like i like the charity shop cos you can get good stuff
S0454	yeah and this be actually
S0466	like i
S0454	treat isn't it cos i think yeah
S0466	yeah
S0454	the cheap ikea stuff i've buy before it hasn't be treat
S0466	oh okay
S0454	the pine so it stain like if you put a little glass and it's get water on it
S0466	it'll mark
S0454	wood will stain
S0466	yeah
S0454	whereas this won't stain
S0466	no it's varnish and everything
S0454	yeah yeah that's it they haven't varnish it i guess you could do it yourself but
S0466	yeah you could
S0454	bite of a hassle
S0466	cos i think i've kitted i'll have kitted this whole place out for do it second hand er about six hundred pound
S0454	yeah
S0466	get everything
S0454	that's good
S0466	which if you if you buy a sofa new it would cost you six hundred pound
S0454	i know
S0466	just a sofa
S0454	sofas be ridiculous
S0466	but second hand they're good like the one i nearly buy somebody get it before me and it be a hundred and ninety for a really nice really good condition
S0454	mm
S0466	leather three seater and an armchair i think that's pretty good
S0454	yeah that be really good
S0466	although yeah i'd have have to pay for forty pound delivery but
S0454	mm
S0466	cos it wasn't from a charity shop so i have to arrange my own
S0454	yeah yeah that's pain
S0466	yeah
S0454	mm
S0466	yeah he do that worktop must have be treat once but it's a bite wear but because it's real wood i can just
S0454	yeah
S0466	sand it down
S0454	you can sand it down
S0466	and retreat it
S0454	yeah it's alright
S0466	yeah so it'll be fine when it's redo
S0454	yeah i think it look quite nice do that chop block come with that or
S0466	yeah cos i think it's make from the worktop
S0454	yeah it look like it's make from it yeah
S0466	yeah
S0454	i think so look at the sandwich
S0466	this big table you see that big piece of wood behind the chair
S0454	yeah
S0466	that be this kitchen table
S0454	oh really
S0466	and they've shape it
S0454	oh
S0466	to fit the wall
S0454	oh wow
S0466	but it be just too big cos it come out to here
S0454	yeah
S0466	all the way like this
S0454	and you don't need it that big
S0466	no and you
S0454	it's a bite silly
S0466	and you couldn't sit the other side so it end up it be just three chair face the wall

S0454	yeah
S0466	and then you just pump it and off you go
S0454	yeah that's really cool
S0466	really nice

S0454	yeah
S0466	yeah
S0454	yeah i think so i mean it be really immoral like
S0466	yeah
S0454	you know rich people go off and trophy hunt
S0466	it's so bizarre because i don't get it cos they don't even keep the animal or stuff they just get a photo and that's it do
S0454	yeah
S0466	it's weird
S0454	no it's it's unpleasant but
S0466	i mean it's not even proper hunt though they
S0454	no
S0466	cos half the animals be breed in like half in captivity for the
S0454	yeah but don't you think that's the same with hunt here like grouse hunt where they're
S0466	no that's true yeah
S0454	they're raise and pheasants and all those bird they're like
S0466	yeah
S0454	raise aren't they and then release and shoot and
S0466	yeah
S0454	oh it's hunt like it's not really hunt be it
S0466	cos you've just suddenly let a few go and
S0454	yeah and like they have grouse beaters don't they like drive the grouse
S0466	oh right towards
S0454	out like walk in a line so that it flush them out and then they shoot them and you're like
S0466	yeah
S0454	well i don't think that's really proper hunt
S0466	not really no that's true
S0454	no
S0466	elsewhere yeah
S0454	yeah yeah
S0466	like some
S0454	it's unpleasant because they're endanger as well so
S0466	yeah
S0454	you know what's he do like
S0466	yeah
S0454	but yeah i mean obviously he's have death threats and stuff so
S0466	yeah well he's have to shut down his whole livelihood the dental practice hasn't he
S0454	yeah
S0466	yeah
S0454	but yeah he be stupid for do it just a pity he's be hound
S0466	yeah
S0454	mm
S0466	it'll die down but
S0454	but there be an argument
S0466	so
S0454	like a conservationist from that park come on tv and say look it's unpleasant but the fact be they bring in a lot of money
S0466	mm
S0454	when they do it legally trophy hunt to
S0466	which allow them to
S0454	and maybe this one wasn't legal but
S0466	yeah he say he think it be
S0454	yeah but it do bring in money big money and where where do people think that money's come from
S0466	yeah and like be that money what's that money spend on maybe not necessarily animal welfare but it's come into the country
S0454	well yeah that's true i suppose that's another thing
S0466	yeah
S0454	mm
S0466	i watch a louis cos you tell me about it a louis theroux
S0454	oh yeah do you watch that
S0466	i watch one a few months ago on this exact topic
S0454	oh really that's funny
S0466	yeah before before this dentist guy and it be interest and yeah he be go around with the crew in the van like so he's like so it's erm you know just you've just stumble across this by chance or
S0466	and then it turn out that they be feed they there be this feed spot they just know exactly where it's gonna be so it wasn't hunt at all
S0454	that's terrible yeah he's good and i like that what's he call jamie oliver
