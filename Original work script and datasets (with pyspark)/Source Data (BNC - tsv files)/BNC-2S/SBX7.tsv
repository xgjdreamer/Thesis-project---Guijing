S0625	should my cv go on to three page be that alright
S0624	yes er can you shrink it down a bite
S0625	yeah i might have to actually
S0624	if you don't the i think the best way to do it be through the margins if you make the margins
S0625	or four page four page
S0624	if you make the margins if you go layout
S0625	yeah i don't i'll just gonna do save cos i don't need anything
S0624	okay go back to your layout
S0625	yeah and then just make the
S0624	and then go
S0625	margins small
S0624	and to make them narrow
S0625	like that
S0624	yeah
S0625	that's better
S0624	but it's still on four page
S0625	yeah i know but i can i've i've spread it out a bite because
S0624	okay
S0625	erm yeah so what i could do be i could take i could take that out there
S0624	also mum just think
S0625	mm
S0624	erm maybe in here if you're apply for kinda the arts base ones you need to say something
S0625	mm
S0624	about be creative
S0625	yeah
S0624	erm i be creative erm erm i i'm a erm i like and maybe something about i'm a part time artist cos you be
S0625	mm
S0624	like i'm a part time artist and i'm highly creative
S0625	yeah yeah
S0624	maybe that should be your final sentence i be a part time artist with erm er with i work with
S0625	creativity be my middle name
S0624	you know what i mean it be i i'm an artist
S0625	yeah
S0624	i'm an artist comfortable work in erm most media erm and i be highly creative
S0625	so i work well under pressure and consider myself intelligent kind and understand
S0624	i'd just put it as the final sentence i'd just make it as the last sentence erm erm
S0625	erm
S0624	i'm a part time artist
S0625	no i've just you just need to put about creative erm
S0624	but you be an artist
S0625	well i be but they can see that when they read it but if if
S0624	yeah do you have do you have a section on your
S0625	i be artistic and creative
S0624	yeah that's good
S0625	that's it file save
S0624	have you get all your have you get your cartoon stuff in the background
S0625	no
S0624	you need to i would put that as present
S0625	what do you mean
S0624	so from like maybe whatever date it be there's probably about like ongoing erm
S0625	mm
S0624	cartoon artist pay private pay commission
S0625	if i take these little things out here if i take that out there and then
S0624	i definitely would have a whole
S0625	that's alright yeah so that's bring it onto two
S0624	you could take it down what font be it
S0625	i don't know
S0624	what font size
S0625	eleven
S0624	oh you could definitely take it down to ten
S0625	could i
S0624	yeah i'd take it down to font size ten and then i'd put in an extra paragraph after say which just say ongoing erm and say freelance artist
S0625	erm
S0624	but i'd make that a whole separate thing that'd be it'd be your second one if you take
S0625	bring it on to three page now so that's good
S0624	but now you're about to put it back up again
S0625	huh
S0624	now you're about to put it back up again
S0625	what do you mean
S0624	if you put in go up
S0625	erm
S0624	and have go up go up go up go up go up go up go up go up go up yeah i definitely think after that one you should put ongoing and then it should be freelance artist and then you say freelance commission portfolio on request
S0625	yeah okay or perhaps i could put that in here though i'm artistic
S0624	no no because if you put it in under employment it's cos it be mum it's like it's like be it's like you you do it as you get pay for it sometimes
S0625	mm
S0624	and it be kinda weighty enough that it should be i think you should
S0625	so what in here
S0624	i'd put a a whole new thing before just ongoing
S0625	okay
S0624	and say over erm since the since the whenever it be over the past forty years or whatever or you don't even need to say how long you've be do it for sort of freelance commission work in a variety of media erm often caricature but sometimes sort of full scale sort of set piece
S0625	mm yeah okay and take a picture of the wall here as well
S0624	yeah and like er like greet greet card
S0625	yeah yeah
S0624	blah blah blah
S0625	yeah yeah yeah will
S0624	i'd definitely treat that as a whole separate thing cos that's weighty
S0625	okay okey dokey
S0624	so
S0625	right so do file save erm
S0624	and then do you want me to have a do you want be it helpful to have a read through in general
S0625	what this
S0624	yeah
S0625	erm
S0624	maybe not
S0625	no i think that's alright that should that do make a difference put it down to ten
S0624	you have log out of online bank why have you log me out you shitbag
S0625	right i'm gonna leave that now
S0624	do you want me to have a read
