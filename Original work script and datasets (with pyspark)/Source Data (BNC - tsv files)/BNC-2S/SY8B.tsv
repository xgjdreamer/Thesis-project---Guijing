S0589	i dunno
S0588	why be a colt a colt and not a pony

S0589	there's probably a more powerful motor in there
S0588	no it wouldn't blend it darling you can
S0589	i could have have
S0588	try it if you want
S0588	but actually we never use it because you always use the hand blender for soup

S0588	walk dead's quite good cos you can leave it for a while and then go back to it and it
S0589	there's no complexity
S0588	you don't seem to have a
S0589	of plot or character that would leave you confuse
S0588	well also they're fairly self contain episodes as well
S0589	yeah
S0588	they're always a little bite self contain so which be what i think work about it they always start with a little story within its own right
S0589	flashback counterstory
