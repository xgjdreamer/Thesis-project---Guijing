S0179	so that's the er the start of it it's very erm that section's very enclose
S0058	yeah well the the the whole park's in a big dip
S0179	yeah
S0058	so
S0179	well no but i suppose the whole bite of it's call be
S0058	mm yeah fair enough but yeah it's erm it's get a large feel to it it's quite nice in a way but it's also slightly odd
S0179	to it
S0058	erm oh tune and it's just the feel of the main be be my dad's right it's slightly odd it's not nowhere near as nice as so it's like erm sorry erm
S0179	you need to keep your head back for this bite here
S0179	what be you say
S0058	er hang on what do you just say
S0179	just one disk free
S0058	mm mm
S0179	yes still disk one
S0058	or what you've do before
S0179	i'll be very smart
S0179	okay
S0058	okay
S0058	yeah like i say erm so be a very modern style of do park as as like it's it's all sort of do to look slightly natural but with plastic in it easy accessible nature whereas be very much a victorian don't you think very victorian style of park
S0179	yes
S0058	sort of little walk and little hill and a little pond and it's it's it's yeah definitely oh
S0058	erm okay so yeah thank you very much for bring me i think it's be a really good visit
S0179	yeah i like that
S0058	yeah well i i think my parent have be the ones that's make the difference today ironically of course
S0058	yeah yeah i didn't realise quite how stress about everything
S0179	yeah i've become quite use to all of this
S0058	yeah i'm sort of use i think they're maybe more well i think they think i'll be more bother by the fact he's a bite confuse but just from the you know the
S0179	well it's a not bad confuse
S0058	exactly yeah and i think he's do quite well and if if he ask me the same question twice i just answer it twice it's not it's not a big deal
S0179	yeah less than five time be good
S0058	yeah yeah erm i mean my gran say as well that he be please to see us so like i say if you sort of if that's one thing in his head that's a good thing and it's in his head be a a really nice good thing and he's remind of it then that's that's fine but yeah i think er
S0179	because if he use to know cars
S0058	yeah the band can go in it yeah if the balloon go in that odd thing because it's the the back windows be black out it can go in there
S0179	well no any car
S0058	oh yeah yeah fair enough
S0058	but yeah erm thank for do the drive i think it's be really worth come even though we didn't see him very much
S0179	well i think it's er the gesture's important
S0058	yeah
S0058	you can see up on the side there where all the cars have go up on the edge to get around into that lane
S0179	superb
S0058	yeah
S0058	it's funny in there isn't it
S0179	that really annoy me
S0058	what
S0179	we all pay road tax
S0058	oh right yeah but it's stupid i mean
S0179	it doesn't help the car traffic flow at all and i'd just like to know what other vehicles
S0058	i mean sort of bus name yes i'm not sure yes i mean
S0179	possibly but i think it's literally just taxis
S0058	mm
S0179	i think that's slightly offensive
S0058	well because yeah if you own a taxi
S0179	and it's a car
S0058	that's yeah you can use it as a car though
S0179	oh i see what you mean
S0058	so you could just be drive in your taxi so like erm you know i've i've get i've get friends whose dads be taxi drivers and you know drive us about in them and you know that's a taxi i be go
S0179	the hill's over there
S0058	right yeah i always feel like there's like i've forget something probably not
S0179	my glass
S0058	yeah
S0058	yes i've get
S0058	shit i've forget my house key
S0058	yeah it's handy have my old house key on as well it's just you don't need to remember to bring anything different when you're
S0179	how you can
S0058	i've i've still get them on the same key ring yeah well cos they be on originally and i just put the new ones on but actually it's it's quite handy have them
S0179	oh you see i've get a whole set on my key in my pocket
S0058	yeah i'd say i don't have them in sort of trouser pocket so it's not so bad oh actually car just go past then
S0058	yeah it be silver but it be cover up with duct tape
S0179	oh right
S0058	so it kind of complete the colour but it look sort of wiggly and wrong
S0179	duct tape
S0058	mm yeah
S0058	i get a text from this morning apologise for the texts
S0179	yeah apologise and those be the texts we want to see do he do anything
S0058	no
S0179	of course not it's a good opportunity
S0058	well it be
S0179	and you shouldn't go out with someone in your team
S0058	no well
S0179	that's just lead to say you shouldn't but not casually anyway that could lead to all sort of problems
S0058	mm yeah yeah i think erm yeah er yeah he say what to do and i say well ask her to dance so i think it be the ceilidh erm i say ask her to dance and he say he do but it wasn't take in a romantic way oh
S0179	how do he know
S0058	presumably yeah
S0179	ooh hang on
S0058	oh yes sorry i should have er
S0179	no it be just instinct
S0058	mm
S0179	force of habit
S0058	oh a coach for london
S0179	cool i bet that take a while
S0058	i'm sure i've look into this because i be look for you know when i be sort of come down to see you a lot
S0179	yeah
S0058	and it's not that cheap to get from to and i be look for sort of cheaper ways of do it erm and i look into coach but the problem be it be something like eight and a half hours but that's cos it stop for three hours in
S0179	well we could have come and get you from
S0058	yeah and it wasn't that cheap actually if you book it a long way in advance it be a lot cheaper but if you're book it erm sort of you know at at the you know kind of very short notice it wasn't that much cheaper than the train and i think well it's easier for everyone and i may as well pay the extra ten quid you know it really wasn't any cheaper
S0179	yeah well it'd cost anyway
S0058	exactly that's what i think erm whereas if you book it a long time in advance then yeah it would have be cheaper but i think it would save the effort you know well in other word
S0058	yeah
S0179	what be you say
S0058	erm yeah one of the nicest ways to do it be to get the sunderland to london train so that's a really nice train erm it's quite fast as well
S0179	and then come out again
S0058	and then come out of london yeah but and that have the advantage that it's a fix price so if you're book in advance don't do that because it's quite expensive if you've book on the day you can literally get on the train and buy a ticket on the train and it's not horrendous you know because we do that one time and we get we buy out ticket on the day and it be horrendously expensive
S0179	who's we
S0058	us two we erm we be come down from
S0179	oh yeah yeah
S0058	what what be the situation we we be get a
S0179	holiday
S0058	yeah
S0179	which be we have to go back to get the other car
S0058	yeah oh right yeah we have to go down yeah
S0058	and that be ridiculously expensive get them on the day but yeah so this particular sunderland train you can get on the train and buy it on the train which be also a key to sort of urgently but it's still gonna be like sixty quid which be really good and it may be more than that now but yeah
S0179	of course what we could have do on that day be go through to sunderland and get the train
S0058	mm
S0179	but then of course you actually want to get off at
S0058	i be gonna say that that doesn't stop after york so it would have be sort of newcastle sunderland sunderland to london london to which would have be a pain
S0179	i see
S0058	yeah i miss the sea
S0179	yeah
S0058	we'll get to see it next time we'll do this next time we'll do that
S0179	what like yesterday you mean
S0058	well no it's just sort of today we've be say you know erm i'll have to go to next time and we'll have to what be it it be something else we say as well yeah we'll have to go down to the seafront next time
S0058	mm
S0058	yeah erm sound really please that we be go i think he's look forward to see us which be nice maybe he feel a bite out on a limb
S0179	yeah
S0058	and of course he doesn't have any money so travel up around
S0179	be his job pay well
S0058	he's pay i think it be a job but erm i feel very certain it's not pay him an awful lot
S0179	well no it's almost a certainty
S0058	yeah well he's probably minimum wage but have say that i don't know if he's pay very he won't be pay very much rent or you know that kind of thing he he might be contribute because it's his family it's it's not like he's gonna be pay commercial rent so it's not go be quite as bad as be
S0179	no who seem to be do okay in her new situation
S0058	yeah well she's actually stay at erm and she be say when she be you know when she be look for job the first time around straight out of uni
S0179	initially work out very badly
S0058	yeah it wasn't really
S0179	i don't know if you realise that
S0058	yeah no i do because be also talk to simon on the simon no i realise that
S0058	yeah
S0179	erm i do actually end up just get into that conversation
S0058	yeah
S0179	erm but
S0058	yeah
S0179	er and you to me
S0058	well i'd go out and i i'd be move down one i think
S0179	yes but for whatever reason
S0058	yeah
S0058	yeah sorry it didn't work out necessarily very well for you
S0179	no you just didn't spend
S0058	sorry erm
S0179	it initially
S0058	yeah
S0058	erm what be i go to say yes erm so i think so anyway she be say when when she be first apply for job and there be one erm in hull which she go for the interview and everything and she the feedback be basically we'd really really like you but and we'd love to give you the job but unfortunately you just don't have any experience erm
S0179	what
S0058	but well exactly
S0179	give me something
S0058	well apparently there be somebody else they realise who have experience and it wasn't that they didn't like her it be just you know couldn't just with her but and so anyway but she's this job
S0179	this be in hull
S0058	have come up in hull yeah but this job have come up again and erm she ring the woman and who'd you know have give her this feedback and say right so if i apply for this job i've now get a year and whatever how many months of experience in this industry
S0179	yeah
S0058	what be my chance and the woman say well i'm actually leave before the interview happen but i will be erm pass on my er my recommendation and my kind of my my thoughts to all do the interview erm you know and just say that i think you'd be an excellent choice
S0179	that's cool
S0058	well it be cool
S0179	so obviously not
S0058	yeah they've take the top off that's really good
S0058	yeah yeah sort of windmill shape as well that's really cool
S0179	so anyway so this
S0058	so anyway yeah so i think she yeah erm i mean i didn't know how keen she be in this one at basingstoke which presumably she's more keen on the one in hull
S0179	well what be her job
S0058	i think it's very similar but probably slightly better pay erm
S0179	so so yeah so
S0058	so so i think it's market yeah so a similar sort of thing i think just promotions erm and that sort of thing i'm really please that she's manage to make inroads into it because it could have be a bite of nightmare
S0179	yeah
S0058	but she's yeah i think a lot of people like as well seem to be make inroads into theatre which be impossible so i think he's do really well
S0179	start place
S0058	yeah
S0179	so difficult
S0058	it's difficult yeah
S0179	middle class basis thing as in he do have family which support him while he do it
S0058	yeah yeah sure yeah he's abled to kind of not earn very much and he can't yeah
S0179	look because he's find yeah but his parent have work hard to give him a a chance
S0058	yeah
S0179	and that's how life work
S0058	yeah i mean there's only so much you can i mean i i do think it's unfair to because the whole thing about internships in erm be it in government where it be like six months unpaid internships in central london so the only way you could do it be if you have parent who
S0179	no but that should just be
S0058	well no exactly
S0179	i think they should be well you can't have work experience over two weeks unpaid
S0058	well that's what erm this whole hoo ha be about with erm because of david david cameron's work experience scheme be it tesco's
S0179	oh yes
S0058	pull out because it be say we can't take slave labour we can't not pay people to work for us
S0179	well because it be only like twenty five thirty hours a week wasn't it
S0058	mm yeah but it be for quite a long time wasn't it
S0179	the idea be employment benefit
S0058	yeah erm but they be basically say we can't accept this work i think be what they be say erm yeah but i think the point be they have to do this work in order to get their benefit which kind of make sense because it's give it's help them essentially you know but it i think they be say they be expect to sort of work as in like staff
S0179	well two things firstly i
S0058	mm well
S0179	people most of who secondly oh dear
S0058	mm
S0179	there's bentley that just go past behind us erm
S0058	mm i think fifty eight it be fifty eighth birthday
S0058	but anyway yeah erm yeah i mean i don't kind of know how i feel about that because to a certain extent
S0179	you've get sort of
S0058	make them yeah i mean as you say make them go to work would really help them because that'll help them back into employment in a way that so many other things won't but also yeah there's i mean there's that have they're they're you know why would you
S0179	oh dear lord
S0058	mm
S0179	behind us erm
S0058	oh right
S0179	stop
S0058	yeah sorry erm yeah the the work experience thing erm yeah but i think
S0179	but the purpose annoy me about that a caveat which say that placements before it's complete they forfeit benefit
S0058	mm
S0179	which
S0058	yeah
S0179	they could be really really badly treat
S0058	yeah because
S0179	you know to have a family emergency
S0058	yeah erm i mean that's yeah that's it seem a bite you can see what they're try to do with it but there's so many people just wouldn't bother and they'd just drop out of it and you need to have some kind of reason for finish i e cos they won't get any benefit personally i don't know
S0179	but you can't small
S0058	mm
S0179	minority to
S0058	yeah
S0179	to effectively do the majority that's not work
S0058	yeah exactly i mean you should have the right to leave employment
S0179	without
S0058	even if yeah
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	change
S0058	yeah lovely yeah i think they might have to er rethink it all but i mean it it's hard to know how easy most people find it because i think it be actually quite a bite you have to do to get it but i mean maybe that's because i be
S0179	you need to do an activity and another activity erm erm look at a job website
S0058	yeah yeah exactly whereas i be write down sort of you know you have to do four things or whatever so i be write down erm august yeah
S0179	why do people see work
S0058	they're lovely aren't they they're so elegant i think they look great
S0058	yeah i mean that's ugly there isn't it
S0179	yeah when do you last see a coal fire power station
S0058	yeah exactly if you want and they don't do they
S0058	i be gonna say kind of it's a bite of a
S0179	documentary make apparently
S0058	yeah
S0179	release in the cinemas about it which community where
S0058	right
S0179	and they be say like or like but it's drive me insane
S0058	well no you be be you be kind of
S0179	well basically they're say vibration and like
S0058	right
S0179	the shadow from the window or whatever and people
S0058	yeah
S0179	or to er you know
S0058	yeah well exactly
S0058	yeah under an airline under a flight path
S0179	you know it's not maybe worth it
S0058	obviously you have to build them to be considerate to people you know
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah exactly and still be a part of the
S0179	we don't you here
S0058	mm
S0058	yeah where where be you plan on get your power from and for company to get to make all the things that you like and use you know i mean there seem to be plenty of it the natural thing let's use it
S0179	cool
S0058	yeah erm i be listen to a record of some students and their project be to get a erm like a tidal turbine but it fix onto an exist erm wind turbine out at sea
S0179	yeah
S0058	erm which be quite a neat sort of as in if you're gonna have all the instructions about you can sort of build in a tidal thing so
S0179	yes er it's probably not tidal it's wave
S0058	oh sorry yeah sorry wave yeah i forget erm but that one that people really be talk about the erm footballers alan shearer erm oh we be sorry you weren't there sorry no erm a bite of er the area where footballers live shearer live anyway
S0058	yeah shearer live in park
S0058	yeah yeah
S0058	yeah yeah but it's sort of the same idea look very posh
S0179	that's probably where that bentley be go to
S0058	yeah yeah
S0058	yeah that's alright
S0058	why do they have country roads just cheaper
S0179	i'm not sure
S0058	sorry
S0058	yeah but i mean
S0179	it be a huge mistake
S0058	yeah i mean a lot of people who be it depend most likely to need it in the sense that they don't have any work experience on their cv the sort of the fifty plus who be find it hard to get into work they have get often obviously very good experience it's the age that's the all of them work all their life in one area and don't have any sort of different things so yes they could work but i just think that that would be a more useful thing for the younger people to do whereas the older people might need help with cv write and apply for job where to look for job and stuff you know the kind of things that have move on since they may be start and in the one company twenty five years ago
S0058	i mean that must be awful if you've sort of work all your life do all this occupation the company's go bust and now you can't get a job because of everyone you just older and people don't want to take you on or you've do something very specific for a long time and people don't yeah it must be very hard i guess retrain and stuff if you can
S0179	actually
S0058	yeah
S0058	yeah i mean i'd say it's more useful than i mean so what if i hadn't erm get that job when i do i'd be i would have be on benefit long enough to have to go and do like erm erm be it a session thing and i think it be a sort of erm yeah help you get back into work sort of session help you get into work whatever erm
S0058	yeah i mean i'm not sure firstly that be no help to me and it waste my time and secondly just to give someone a lesson people who haven't necessarily excel at accept information in a school set
S0179	yeah
S0058	it's stupid i i kind of feel like give them placements be more useful and maybe do and enjoy do it
S0179	cambridge university service
S0058	yeah i'd basically say they they sort of you know they mention as well and it's like well you know oh no that be it i'd get the job but i wasn't start it erm
S0058	so from yeah and they be like well if you want to receive benefit for that time or whatever you've get to go along but i it be some for some i think what they manage to do be i say well i can't do this session because of x so can i get book on to the next session
S0179	yeah
S0058	yes which be after
S0179	after
S0058	which be after when i start the job which be how i get around it and they certainly know what i be do but yes i basically say look i've get this job you know i'm not lie i'm not just mess about and they believe me i think i look different to a lot of the people in there
S0179	transporter bridge
S0058	yeah and then there's a funny shape
S0179	bridge be in the er what do you call it
S0058	the transporter bridge
S0179	yeah it's in er
S0058	it's in auf wiedersehen pet isn't it it's in billy elliot as well have you see that film
S0179	no
S0058	you might actually like it it's not it's and you know it it's it's kind of about dance but there isn't that isn't really the the point of it it's about sort of
S0179	it's about dance all about dance
S0058	about dance yeah erm but it's yeah it's it's funny and it's it's get a lot of really good erm good scenes in it and it i think you might enjoy it
S0058	picturesque
S0179	not usually
S0058	you're not you're not a massive
S0179	as in i've see more picturesque place in my time
S0058	yes the biggest thing oh i'm sure the energy n r g
S0058	because durham have a campus in teesside you know durham university
S0179	why
S0058	have a
S0179	i didn't know that
S0058	i think it's stockton there's certain course be teach here it's really weird and i think sort of the slightly more vocational ones
S0058	mm that's that's the point i think durham's get to teach them but on a sort of separate bite so you're not part of the kind of college system
S0179	yeah so it's not a problem
S0058	so it's not no exactly it's slightly weird
S0179	that be weird
S0058	erm so i think yeah so there's i think erm i know somebody that do sport science at durham but it be in teesside you see you don't really win in that regard but teesside uni be sort of relatively popular with people but not for you know if if you're gonna go to teesside you may as well go to sunderland kind of thing if you're from sunderland i mean
S0179	yeah where's teesside again
S0058	teesside be kind of this area and i don't know where the actual uni be it's just call teesside uni
S0058	we know it well and i do feel sorry when i do that erm that thing at with the career event i felt really sorry for some of the kid erm you know and just it must be hard to to get go when you're worry about the kid i mean there be some of them who weren't interest but some of them you just think ah i really hope it work out you know well it's twenty one to thirsk which be where we come off
S0179	why would you go if you weren't interest
S0058	well i don't know just some of it be it be hard to yeah they be quite enthusiastic i mean i think they've probably just go along because it be an event at you know i guess it's a step in the right direction go to a career event erm but it be quite sad you know for for both side it be sad because people who you know really want to work and this thing have happen to them and they sort of you know in the middle of it and as well it's sad for the ones who just i felt sorry for how they be gonna bring their kid up
S0179	yeah i don't know it be like a lot of the problems with erm i think it's very it must be very embitter to work in that sort of area so er work in an unemployment centre
S0058	yes very
S0179	but that mean when it's not it doesn't provide a very good service to people like you
S0058	no i know exactly and i imagine most of your time be spend with people who aren't interest in work so then yeah for me who really really be do everything i and say yeah possibly could to get any job as soon as possible yeah it it wasn't they weren't helpful and and you know but i i be able to look for help in other place and i know where to look and i get it you know
S0179	well a bite of service
S0058	well sunderland career service be actually really helpful erm they felt like they have less of a erm a kind of a a party line
S0179	yes well that's the problem with many time but they don't have a very difficult job
S0058	no they don't
S0179	therefore justify their existence
S0058	yeah exactly
S0179	and that's
S0058	yeah they have a very strong party line about what's what's what they recommend for cvs and stuff whereas the sunderland one felt a lot more flexible erm and they they listen to what i be say and sort of say well we can help you with this and just be a lot more open basically the the cambridge one wasn't very open but i guess that's because i be a very very standard case for them english two one look for sort of job you know erm not really stand
S0058	yeah they weren't helpful with that at all which like i mean you know whereas the sunderland one would just i think they be helpful where i want them to be helpful which be great which when i go with sort of interview practice and just sort of say oh i'll need to get over this final hurdle you know i'd i'd be to all these interview and haven't get the job can you help me to erm
S0179	the interview skills so much as
S0058	no
S0179	as it be just erm the experience that you
S0058	i think it be confidence which they help me with to they sort of yeah take me erm just yeah take me through some of the question and help me think about a little bite more and and help me to be more confident in my answer maybe and say i can do this you know which be be good and you know just they be just a lot nicer about the whole thing to be honest erm but it be the reason i get on to them be because erm my dad work with somebody whose partner be one of the staff there
S0179	i still can't understand why they help you
S0058	er because i be a student from the area or sorry a graduate from wearside they help they they help they work slightly differently in that they yeah i i be i be live in sunderland where i be from sunderland and i have a degree and be look for job so they be fine to
S0179	that's weird
S0058	it's very weird yeah and i don't think they bend the rule at all either i explain the full situation you know
S0058	it be quite weird actually erm when i be look to put erm job advert up recently erm i be i go on the career website to have a look at the format and stuff and all my old search be still save
S0179	job advert
S0058	so the job for recorders
S0179	oh right
S0058	erm we be gonna stick it on there and see if any students be interest so erm
S0179	only cambridge
S0058	yeah or any other university yeah so i erm you know i log in to to have a look at the format and sort of erm see what kind of information we need to put up what erm and you can't see the advert unless you log in so yeah so i log in and it be my old account and it have all the old search and all the old job that i apply for that be still save
S0179	yeah
S0058	which be very weird and sort of and then be look at it from the other side as well
S0179	yeah
S0058	it's weird
S0179	i can imagine
S0058	i be register with all kinds of sit and in the end it didn't really come down to that you know to find job on weird internet sit it come down to go to a company's website and look for it and er apply they've get load of erm ecm information in the er foyer to the university centre
S0179	
S0058	yeah and i be erm that's where the other day and they're obviously try to get more undergraduates interest
S0179	well there's quite a lot of the engineer department actually
S0058	yeah where do you find that by the way be it list events
S0179	i think i just google it
S0058	be that how you find it
S0179	yeah
S0058	oh right
S0179	and subsequently
S0058	right yeah remember if they'd sort of if you know if if so if you've come across them somewhere or whether you'd go right i want to help me do all the work
S0179	well it it be just quite an easy way of do it so
S0058	no it be great
S0179	information about
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	erm and it be but it be fantastic
S0058	no
S0179	because we don't have success figure as such because
S0058	no exactly
S0179	job that they be only gonna earn money if they place me and i
S0058	yeah
S0179	actually attempt it so accept
S0058	yeah there's no point in them not you know they need to look at the areas you're interest in and
S0179	yeah
S0058	listen to you properly and stuff yeah
S0179	so it's certainly interest
S0058	it sound like it be a great service
S0179	yeah and see what sort of interest what else would be available in the areas
S0058	now that you've now that you're in this position and what you could
S0179	maybe in a year or two continuously re evaluate this one
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	er i mean i think i've come to the conclusion that i don't want to i'm not go to reapply for post
S0058	okay okay
S0179	erm yeah that's sort of organically happen and of course that be an option
S0058	yeah yeah definitely
S0179	but i'd need to be sort of apply now and i don't feel like
S0058	i mean it seem to me that you've get more to gain from this you know you sort of
S0179	yes and the problems i have with this sort of aren't i don't think about the job in a lot of ways lifestyle
S0058	yeah
S0179	but it's change anyway and that's not come back so
S0058	yeah
S0058	exactly it wouldn't be it wouldn't be go back to uni as such it would be
S0179	no it would be
S0058	i mean it seem to me as well that you i mean
S0179	quite dark
S0058	it's dim isn't it yeah
S0179	sorry what be you say
S0058	erm you know it seem to me that that the project management aspect of it which you haven't really kick off with yet
S0179	no
S0058	it's something that you'd really enjoy so it's kind of worth stick in and get you know wait until you've get some of that
S0179	be very fascinate to see how this
S0058	yes but when when do this all happen be that six months
S0179	end of the financial year
S0058	ah of course yeah
S0179	which will be
S0058	and yeah
S0058	but that'll be very interest yeah
S0179	but that'll be a very interest indicator of where
S0058	yeah i mean it sound like they're quite happy with you to talk quite openly about them so talk openly to them about salary and promotion and stuff so see how that one go and then you can maybe discuss it it sound like that you can be quite frank something about your expectations and
S0179	i think
S0058	be a woman
S0058	oh clearly well do for it's horrible isn't it it's really come down
S0179	well i think
S0058	the cotswolds it's actually erm further south it's london it's sort of south of thirsk so
S0179	be it
S0058	yeah yeah so we'd have come more
S0179	erm no i'm gonna find that very interest
S0058	yeah
S0058	definitely yeah and like i say i think well i think when you've enjoy what you've be do i think i can't help think the best be yet to come sort of thing
S0179	yeah and i think
S0058	a bite more interest than what you're do now
S0179	i like be noisy and do i look at sort of er action project as i prefer work
S0058	yeah
S0179	just sort of go about work on strategy and stuff
S0058	yeah
S0179	i love that
S0058	exactly and i think you should stick at it until you've get some experience with that and and then see whether you want to you know which direction you want to go in erm but like i say that's the only but i think you've enjoy what you've be do but imagine that combine with you know some project management
S0058	yeah
S0058	yeah it will yeah
S0179	but experience and learn again it's learn about stuff
S0058	yeah that's really good erm
S0179	i be actually use
S0058	and that be what you want wasn't it this like kind of intellectual
S0179	yes
S0058	have to work things out that that way which
S0179	yeah
S0058	i mean
S0179	as in i'm still
S0058	yeah so that particular aspect of it yeah
S0179	well i i think that possibly have yeah
S0058	oh yeah didn't you say there be something you'd work out and somebody else hadn't be able to work out how to do it
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	it's difficult
S0058	yeah
S0058	no i mean that's really great that's the kind of thing that's gonna help you get erm get on as well
S0179	yeah
S0058	if they feel that you're an indispensable thing you know part of the team with skills that they don't have or that you're better at those skills
S0179	yeah obviously it be sort of
S0058	yeah
S0179	very good to work with
S0058	but they've yeah they always come out you mean
S0179	well possibly yeah erm erm erm
S0058	people skills
S0179	no just yeah i mean
S0058	sort of you mean like the sort of nine to five
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	which be sometimes
S0058	yeah i guess it's it's sort of that transfer as well from the union because you be so very good at the uni plan and get so into it and you kind of get it down to a fine art i guess it's then hard to transfer to a to something so very different in term of pace
S0179	yeah i mean i like
S0058	yeah
S0179	department
S0058	yeah a very different kind of like a different kind of pace i guess
S0179	yeah
S0058	and a lot more autonomy for individual sort of oh i feel like do this now
S0179	i mean i've still get a huge no i can still do that but it's
S0058	that's what i mean you can't just get up and say oh right i'm go for a walk too much
S0179	no but you see first
S0058	erm yes we're not so we're not far away now it's erm possibly erm six miles to the town and it'll be the junction four first erm and we'll go through a roundabout but then we go away from thirsk
S0179	roundabout i trust then
S0058	yes yeah erm well yeah no sorry we're gonna come off at the junction and then we hit a roundabout
S0179	right so it's a slip road and do a roundabout
S0058	yeah
S0179	this be a really quite civilise way to go about the country you see more
S0058	yeah it's very nice
S0179	and at least drive condition be more relax
S0058	yeah it's very pleasant sunday be always the er good time
S0058	lovely green field
S0179	yes
S0058	very english
S0179	it appear to me at some point in the near future we should holiday
S0058	
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	but i'm plan on not take any until this er end of year review have go through because it look better
S0058	yeah what do that mean you can get over a hundred percent project time for it you see there's the turn off for castle howard and that's brideshead
S0179	okay
S0058	and so
S0179	the world of jam herriot
S0058	yeah
S0179	how
S0058	you see we could have a day and we could go to castle howard and the world of jam herriot and that would be brilliant let's do that okay so this be the turn we want
S0179	scarborough we want this turn
S0058	we want this turn yeah a61
S0179	and i need warn
S0058	i know sorry okay sorry
S0179	as in we'd pass the end of the slip road when you tell me about it and i need to know this be the next turn
S0058	yeah sorry i
S0058	and go straight over this roundabout so towards
S0179	okay
S0058	oh hang on no sorry we're gonna go er
S0179	so we're go leave
S0058	right hang on
S0179	i need to know now
S0058	we're gonna go right
S0179	right be you sure
S0058	right yes
S0179	not
S0058	not there no no not ah
S0179	right
S0058	okay i've
S0179	okay work it out quickly
S0058	erm
S0179	we can't keep do this you need to work it out
S0058	i know erm okay erm yeah if you go straight over and go to northallerton
S0179	right so not towards thirsk on the a61 and i need to go to the next exit here
S0058	yeah
S0179	right you need to get your finger out
S0058	i mean we should yeah we should come to another roundabout where we're gonna go right
S0179	right how far be this roundabout
S0058	oh shit no that wasn't the right junction that's why
S0179	right
S0058	oh no erm
S0179	where be we now
S0058	turnaround yeah
S0179	okay
S0058	so erm if you take the next go on the leave
S0179	this road
S0058	yeah
S0058	i think that junction come out too early that be why i didn't give you more warn because i wasn't expect it then
S0058	yeah if you go back to that roundabout erm rather than go back onto the bring you back onto the you can take the second exit onto the a61 then go up to that back down and yeah sorry about that sorry about that
S0179	it's a pity you can't just drive south on roads like this you could actually
S0058	yeah it would take you longer i think
S0179	because that happen to be where we want to go to
S0058	mm yeah yeah because that be the other way
S0179	yeah alright so we're come up to
S0058	so so we're gonna take the second exit a61
S0179	yeah we don't need the
S0058	no i mean i mean the third exit the third yes
S0058	okay
S0179	south kilvington do that sound right
S0058	er yes that's right yeah so we carry on through south kilvington erm and yeah so we're go to we're on the a61 now and we're gonna come to the roundabout that i be aim for anyway erm yeah at which point we're gonna take the first exit and that should be signpost sutton colesly be in the a one seventy
S0179	i'm not detail
S0058	okay sorry yeah
S0179	so where be we come up to
S0058	erm so erm the next thing on the map after this town erm we've get about another mile then there's a right hand junction which we don't want and then so we stay on this road until we come to the roundabout so erm
S0179	so basically we're come to a roundabout
S0058	yeah in about a mile we're gonna come to a roundabout
S0058	mm
S0179	it's yorkshire then
S0058	yeah
S0179	what county be we in again
S0179	jam herriot no it's not
S0058	the herriot centre it's the home of the herriot centre anyway
S0179	it could be the home of the author
S0058	oh yeah well probably but the book be it it's possibly where he be bear birth place get obviously
S0179	jam herriot audience it might be
S0058	probably yeah it isn't
S0179	right a useful piece of knowledge about that then the priority of roundabout
S0058	yeah definitely
S0179	be we in the high street
S0058	scarborough a170
S0179	right so leave here
S0058	get to the leave here yep great and we're now on that road head due east
S0179	the one you want to be on
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	do you want to get my ipad out
S0058	yeah i'll erm mind you flaxton be on here
S0179	okay well you can try just use that
S0058	yeah i be gonna say yeah i'll i'll use this and then once we're in flaxton it seem like it should be really obvious yeah no i'm happy to stick with this to be honest
S0179	yes i know i say why be it
S0058	why why
S0179	right
S0058	mm it do seem odd that be that little bite there this be sutton bank or approach sutton bank anyway
S0179	right so navigations and tell me what's come up
S0058	erm yeah so now there really isn't anything come up erm we will stay on this road erm it go through the town and then yeah then we get to sutton bank which be erm and yeah
S0179	
S0058	steep
S0179	what do you mean steep
S0058	there's a steep gradient bite that caravan aren't allow on
S0179	oh right
S0058	erm
S0179	it might be a bite more scenic if we go this way
S0058	yeah yeah definitely but i mean erm i think my dad doesn't like sutton bank because it be one time we come this way in the old polo and he be really worry we wouldn't make it up erm but yeah caravan aren't allow on it erm yeah it's because they're not
S0179	there's many many place caravan shouldn't go but do
S0058	the roads
S0179	yes plant pot cheap cheap plant pot if you're gonna put those three word on it
S0058	yeah
S0179	it's a better order please
S0058	yeah so yeah this bite isn't very erm very excite
S0179	well there's some nice view
S0058	it's lovely yeah but actually in term of directions you just just stay on the road
S0179	well this'll be north york moor
S0058	er yes they be yeah north york moor national park
S0058	yeah they're not quite as i don't know they don't seem as threaten as the erm like the the moor that the erm hound of the baskervilles be on the spaniel of the baskervilles
S0179	what now
S0058	the spaniel of the baskervilles if it be on the north york moor
S0179	yorkshire terrier
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	small but fix
S0179	a bite more drive around as well
S0058	yeah yeah
S0058	if this be sutton under whitestone
S0179	if we can find it
S0058	yes
S0179	this be where be that
S0058	this be erm sutton under whitestonecliffe all one word
S0179	brilliant
S0058	maybe it's whitestonecliffe it's very picturesque isn't it
S0179	yeah
S0058	lovely
S0179	i'm not sure i'd want to live here
S0058	no you can smell the erm real real stoves or real fire rather
S0179	that's weed
S0058	nice beaver furniture amaze can you imagine a team of workers he's get out at the back
S0179	alright lads there's some nice bamboo for you
S0058	nice
S0179	bizarrely if you want to get a lot of tree chop down it would probably be quite a good idea to just employ a lot of beaver
S0058	be it employ
S0179	well yeah just get a load of beaver
S0058	get a load of beaver yeah
S0179	fence them in probably be quite happy
S0058	mm it's not cruel because they like fell tree i assume
S0179	well give them something to you know you take like fifty percent of what they fell but you could food that seem fair
S0058	mm it seem fair
S0179	build their dam
S0058	yeah
S0179	position of dolphins to give advice
S0058	oh yeah i don't know how i feel about that
S0179	but they're they're non human people i don't there's a difference between be cruel to them and not keep them in captivity and give them human right
S0058	yeah
S0179	because they're not human but
S0058	no yeah that's the flaw
S0179	they might be intelligent they may even be more intelligent
S0058	and yeah so don't keep them in tiny pool don't mistreat them and
S0179	don't harm them and don't
S0058	don't exactly yeah
S0179	fine but i don't see why that be synonomous apply
S0058	you'd probably have the human right and not to be leave out in the ocean you know cos that's not suitable for humans you know whereas actually
S0179	and if we treat them that mean they're accountable for action as humans be so that mean that so a human
S0058	so
S0179	so a dog
S0058	yeah if they kill another animal do that make them murder
S0179	if they kill another dolphin or
S0058	yeah
S0179	so a dolphin yeah exactly
S0058	it doesn't really work
S0179	no it doesn't work at all i hadn't think about it before
S0058	no
S0179	because dolphins be a dolphin be not very nice well not very nice but they be quite vicious
S0058	well they're animals yeah that that's the point they they hunt
S0179	they're quite good as predators
S0058	mm and they're clever
S0179	as be we
S0058	and they like play but you know
S0058	your favourite car
S0179	what
S0058	that motorbike
S0179	it's not my favourite car don't you say that
S0058	oh i'm only joke
S0179	do you find that funny
S0058	i just like tease you it's just cos i don't like it
S0179	sorry
S0058	it's just cos i don't like it very much
S0179	ah low gear no shit sherlock
S0058	yeah
S0179	be this sixty oh over there
S0058	oh ho feel it on the legs feel the burn as they say in body attack
S0058	yeah that's the way to do it only ever come in at the top yeah they've get the idea
S0179	that's hilarious
S0058	yeah well i be look at the rain i be a bite like oh sutton bank and i think oh there's no reason not to do it it's fine to drive
S0179	it's just i've never hear of
S0179	shit i've never hear of this this be a bite special
S0058	i think cos we've this be maybe i should have search sutton bank
S0179	i've literally never hear of it
S0058	yeah it be quite erm i think maybe it's because i've be spend more time in north yorkshire you've never really do north yorkshire whereas we've drive around here a bite yeah and like i say we use to drive around here in a car that my dad wasn't confident would have cop well
S0179	wow
S0058	nice isn't it
S0179	it's a bite unnerve actually drive uphill
S0058	yeah
S0179	yeah
S0058	oh
S0179	because you could slip back quite easily i should not be look
S0058	no
S0179	oh
S0058	okay
S0179	yeah but
S0058	right at the top
S0179	well that be a a good experience because it go
S0058	yeah yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	well if you can then er
S0058	yeah fair play to you yeah
S0179	well i wouldn't want to try
S0058	mm not so much no
S0179	i really lose out on that
S0058	yeah nice
S0179	start on that
S0058	nice yeah while you're do your drive test from the thirsk centre right sutton bank
S0179	actually i'm very glad you know after that time in 's old car in wales with four people in it
S0058	oh yes it be really struggle
S0179	try do anything like that
S0058	yeah
S0179	and we'll get out and walk
S0058	yeah
S0179	see you at the top right so where be we come up to now
S0058	erm so yeah so er when we get to the end of this road which be kind of
S0179	so gosh be that a single gradient mark or a double gradient mark on the map
S0058	double
S0179	good well i be gonna say if that be a single what the fuck's a double
S0058	okay so erm yeah so when we come to the end this road be kind of erm the turn off for the b125 one erm it it's on the erm on the map it's kind of the erm the a170 do a sort of sharp leave bend like a right hand bend so it might well be a a sort of a t junction or a a kind of a cross like a
S0179	so there's a turn off to the right
S0058	to the right for the b152
S0179	how far
S0058	erm in about four miles
S0179	four miles okay
S0058	we must have a look at the erm the last bite of the
S0179	don't miss the turn
S0058	okay
S0179	the perception be where you might be able to overtake to get into speed
S0058	yeah
S0179	look at that bite it be like a plateau
S0058	mm
S0179	it's like a
S0058	yeah
S0058	yeah yeah yeah
S0179	it make you think that it could be
S0058	yes yeah
S0179	what's that steep bite call again
S0058	sutton bank
S0058	okay
S0179	yeah
S0058	erm it could well be it erm no no that's fine
S0179	it's a minor road anyway
S0058	yeah
S0058	er yeah it be an actual b road fall be where erm jam brody go it's a very posh catholic college by run by monks a very exclusive sort of school
S0179	how can it be exclusive when it's run by monks
S0058	er well as in you have to erm it's a kind of a catholic thing and a lot of people go into the priesthood i think it's all quite erm
S0179	wow
S0058	but jam brody be quite unusual he's quite erm
S0179	unusual
S0058	do you know what i mean he never he never seem like you know you could imagine him not go to a normal school he didn't seem sort of like he'd be to a normal you know your comp around the corner
S0179	no i suppose i have a moment in my head as mr university challenge
S0058	yeah
S0058	picturesque
S0179	yeah
S0058	i guess the turn should be come up pretty soon
S0179	picturesque panoramic
S0058	mm we're come down off that er land that time forget plateau
S0179	it's not
S0058	oh right so i think it's where that that's where the the the road bend around so we want to go right
S0179	right
S0058	there isn't no
S0179	scotland this terrain
S0058	mm
S0179	it's just wild
S0058	yeah
S0179	this feel like there could be a town over by the next hill
S0058	mm it's not as bleak
S0179	yeah exactly it's it's it's not bleak but it's still remote
S0058	yeah mm so yeah so this road bend right round actually erm
S0179	wow
S0058	more than one actually more than that anyway sorry yeah so we want the the leave hand one here
S0179	i certainly don't want to go to
S0058	sorry no we want the right hand one
S0179	yeah yeah i know
S0058	yeah
S0179	if you be keen and it be clear how quickly
S0058	mm
S0058	okay
S0179	i still unfortunately
S0058	er yeah we're not go er towards them yeah
S0179	we're go towards
S0058	we're go towards morton yes that's that's correct yeah so basically now we're gonna stay on this b road
S0058	yeah as far as one can tell these things we're gonna stay on this b road until we get to a town call
S0179	oh look at that

S0058	fair enough
S0179	towns in a bite
S0058	yeah erm so yeah it's not we've just go over the sort of bridge there and so we've kind of half a mile it's not far along that erm it's call erm yeah carry on through the town erm i think it'll be just once we get past the town but i'll give you shout you know

S0179	it's not a cup of tea
S0058	yeah which be give her something
S0179	she didn't do any work
S0058	and she doesn't particularly like
S0179	it's about like me give up use a vibrator
S0058	okay so accord to this it'll be the next right hand bend these be just that's just a drive drive
S0179	right here
S0058	yes it's this this one here yes
S0179	that be a turn and a half
S0058	okay and now we carry on down to sherrif hutton erm which i reckon be six miles
S0179	oh right so we're now on the actual
S0058	this be the minor road that take us down to flaxton
S0179	okay i'm interest get there
S0058	yeah
S0179	ah wibbly wobbly
S0058	this be potticar bank which seem to fit with the er
S0179	yeah it's topology yes
S0058	yeah
S0179	there's a lot of situations that if you can make road a little
S0058	mm right
S0179	pedestrian
S0058	yeah
S0179	jesus it's bumpy
S0058	mm
S0179	we might have a jaguar
S0058	i be just about to say about the jag ironic
S0179	not really
S0058	no i mean the a jaguar be quite a fast animal
S0179	oh right yes the car be however particularly jaguar often
S0179	right so how far be down here
S0058	how far
S0179	down here be it
S0058	erm so erm so from where we turn off
S0179	yeah
S0058	erm we go kind of just three miles so we're not too far off
S0179	three miles
S0058	erm well so then the road erm it kind of veer around to the leave and then we wanna take a right turn and carry on towards sherrif hutton so it'll it'll be signpost
S0179	and presumably you'll tell me where that turn be
S0058	yeah
S0179	i don't think that the next road we're take it might do yeah overtake tend to go a bite faster which make life more difficult
S0058	yeah
S0179	so that's wilkinson's law of overtake
S0179	ooh smoke it's a lot
S0058	hmm okay so erm
S0179	it smell good
S0058	mm in sort of maybe slightly less than a mile
S0058	yeah in slightly less than a mile we're go to erm yeah accord to the ipad this road be gonna veer around to the leave quite sharply it could be a t junction
S0179	right
S0058	depend on what
S0179	less than a mile
S0058	yeah
S0179	okay that's original
S0058	yeah so either this road be gonna veer around to the leave or there's gonna be a t junction where we wanna go leave then very shortly after that we're gonna take a right it's just like it's stagger across
S0179	and a more powerful car
S0058	mm
S0179	and if he wasn't sort of over the line
S0058	yeah
S0179	oh dear and we're here yes here
S0058	oh right so this be probably the yeah
S0179	right two turn
