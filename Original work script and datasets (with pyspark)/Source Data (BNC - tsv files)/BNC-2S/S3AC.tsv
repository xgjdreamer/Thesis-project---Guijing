S0423	shall we stop for some dinner at inn
S0421	i don't know what inn be
S0423	caribbean
S0421	be it like an inn still
S0423	must be an area probably
S0421	i mean i maybe there be an inn like or there be
S0423	do you think they've name it after the book
S0421	no i think the book be base on the area
S0423	have you read it
S0421	no i've get it though
S0423	have you
S0421	yeah i mean i've just tell you that
S0423	i always think it be kinda some pirate story base in the caribbean
S0421	no it's erm
S0423	well it sound like that
S0421	yeah i'm not sure what that one's about but it's not
S0421	i don't think that's a very daphne du maurier thing to write oh it's a red road again and then it's go grey
S0423	be you like some aficionado of road surface then
S0421	no i'm just wonder why imagine if it do go yellow oh off to see the wizard the wonderful wizard of oz
S0423	nice clear road this be
S0421	be the wizard of oz a book or be it a play
S0423	i don't know
S0421	cos i think it might
S0423	it be a film
S0421	yeah but i think it might be a novel but i think it's a play
S0423	no i'm not sure if i be to guess i would say it's a book
S0421	mm
S0423	that's there
S0423	we're drive alongside isn't that where the hound of the baskervilles base
S0421	oh yeah oh we be talk about this it might be i'm not sure
S0423	or do i say it be
S0421	well one or the other i be read erm the sign of the four
S0423	oh yeah
S0421	yeah but i get i keep get really confuse because
S0423	i think you'd read them all
S0421	well i have no i've not read all of them i've read quite a few of them but i always forget like the story because they're quite when i'm read them they're quite difficult to like understand exactly what's go on cos i think i feel like i've lose when i've read them before i feel like i've lose a lot of the key detail and not quite get the full effect because it well cos you've you've read them and you don't like they don't like the kind of the mystery be like this one person narrate like so like sherlock holmes and dr watson have go to meet this person and then this one person be like say like all the story and then there's like direct speech within his speech and then sometimes i get confuse like be he talk about his father now or be this him talk or be he talk about someone else or do this happen like do do you not find that
S0423	oh i don't remember be any confusion but i i think it be quite er for like an old style read i think it be fairly not too bad to follow along really
S0421	yeah well the the the storyline i've always like be fine with the kind of what's happen in present day but when it get to these like really long monologues i'm just like
S0423	maybe i just didn't look at it too detail like you be
S0421	because like i be reread the sign of the four cos i've read that one before and like i be read that and i be like right so this man
S0423	you mean when the person who's say right this be what happen but you're go back
S0421	yeah and then sherlock holmes be like oh how interest do you know what i mean cos like sherlock holmes be investigate he's go down to i don't even know where it be now erm but he's he's talk to this person and this person's give him all this like information about erm oh yeah cos they they go to meet with this mary she get a letter say to meet if she can bring a friend but not the police and they then sherlock holmes and watson go with her and then they're talk to this person who's talk about like cos her father's die and they're talk about her father and this other person in the sign of the four like group or whatever and i'm just like and this one person do narrate everything and this one person may not have even be there and they're just like narrate it to them
S0423	well it's so he's he's tell them what he know about them
S0421	yeah but it's just confuse cos there's like direct speech within that and it's not it's not put out it's like just put up in this like really long block
S0423	mm
S0421	cos i remember in erm cos i when i read a study in scarlet it be all good up until the point where it be kind of like part one and then there be like part two and then all of a sudden it be talk about this farmer and his daughter
S0423	yeah i can't remember now
S0423	i know i have read book where they just go off like that and you think what
S0421	yeah
S0423	and what's go on here
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	i don't remember detail
S0421	yeah cos i yeah cos i read like quite a lot of them a while ago and i remember like enjoy them but not kind of like if someone be to ask me like afterwards oh what do you think i wouldn't remember because it didn't kind of sink in enough
S0423	yeah
S0421	cos of the way it's do cos it's kind of almost like they just drop all this information on you and it's like er
S0423	well i don't think he necessarily write it as a novel type thing do he
S0421	no yeah
S0423	they be really make for a magazine and they they be a series weren't they
S0421	yeah
S0423	so that probably have an effect on how it come across in when it's all put together in a book
S0421	yeah
S0423	erm it's for a slightly different purpose than the probably the book he he didn't really write it with the idea of do one story of the novel you know although i guess the write go it's similar cos you kind of
S0421	yeah
S0423	you just go through it in chapters i suppose just break it down to series to be read in the magazine but yeah i don't remember it be a particularly difficult read but cos i i just cos certain some of them be quite short aren't they i just get a book with them all the stories in
S0421	yeah that's what i do
S0423	yeah
S0421	and i just kind of go through
S0423	yeah
S0421	and then now but like because of the way it's write it's like it's not kind of the sort of mystery that i can engage in and kind of try and guess it's very much like wow look at sherlock holmes how do he do that like i didn't see that at all
S0423	well you know it's it's just different
S0421	yeah
S0423	to other kind of murder mystery things
S0421	so then like so i'm like read it now and i'm like i want to kind of try and understand like what's go on properly and it's quite it
S0423	i don't know whether it there be the death there be it that you want to in that way
S0421	yeah it's not there
S0423	well yeah i don't think it really be there no cos it wasn't write as that kind of a book
S0421	yeah
S0423	it it there's clever little things in there you know
S0421	yeah
S0423	and some of them you think well you know
S0421	it be well do yeah and like i think erm
S0423	er and that's what i like about it my some of the things he come up with and like i i always like that that separate
S0421	yeah i like him like sherlock holmes like kind of the stuff he he say
S0423	he he eliminate everything that's like impossible or whatever
S0421	yeah
S0423	i quite like when i read that sentence that stand out cos it's quite
S0421	yeah
S0423	just cleverly put together to explain it how he work
S0421	yeah
S0423	and then there's other things where like in the film as well where he say little bite of a hair there you think well
S0421	yeah
S0423	you know
S0421	yeah yeah it's good
S0423	it's a bite far fetch some of it like you know you wouldn't be able to figure that out but it's still
S0421	yeah i quite like the conversations like when dr watson's like but how could you possibly know this and sherlock holmes be like well my dear friend i shall explain and it's good i like that kinda thing
S0423	yeah the explanations they make sense don't they although it's still of a bite kind of which make him kind of special cos you know you know people who'd be able to figure it out from that but
S0421	yeah
S0423	erm i don't the book or one of the film or series you shave by a window or something and he say how do you know that and he be say oh because of the way you've shave you couldn't see your face right cos the light be shin on that side and
S0421	yeah
S0423	stuff like it be good the way he figure it out isn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	not that you could necessarily figure it out from that but
S0421	yeah
S0423	the way he explain it you're think
S0421	yeah it's like wow
S0421	you probably couldn't to be honest
S0423	well no but
S0423	but it would give you the idea of how determine you be
S0421	yeah
S0423	you can put the clue together that
S0421	yeah
S0423	and that's kind of what he do so
S0421	i like in this erm sign of the four one they be like oh but how do they get in the window and the the window's lock and the door have not be you know what i mean and it's like they must've come through that place in the roof and it's like it's good
S0423	well i bring the sherlock holmes that
S0421	oh do you
S0423	just in case you want to watch them i know you've see them before but erm
S0421	the new one's out the you know that one that one that look quite good on the trailer
S0423	oh right yeah be it out now
S0421	yeah
S0423	yeah it might be interest that mightn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	he's he's like in old age isn't he
S0421	yeah
S0423	and be he a bite forgetful about
S0421	i'm not sure i can't imagine sherlock holmes be forgetful
S0423	yeah
S0421	cos his mind he say it's he's it's like erm an attic and he imagine it like an attic and he only keep the things that he need which be why when watson's talk to him about like the solar system and he's like what he doesn't know anything about it and then watson's like how can you possibly not know and he's like well cos i don't need to know why do i need to know that
S0423	be that the
S0421	yeah i think it's in i'm not sure which one it's in but yeah erm any he's really shock like
S0423	yeah
S0421	and it's like you you have to keep only the things that he want and like he forget the things that he doesn't need
S0423	yeah
S0421	and it and it's like how can you forget something that you don't want in your head but yeah that's how he that's how he can remember so much of like the things he do need
S0423	yeah yeah he's quite a unique character i suppose that's why he's so he's so confident
S0421	yeah
S0423	like ahead of his time it be write
S0421	but it's it's strange that like you could think him up do you know what i mean if you weren't a similar sort of person
S0423	yeah
S0421	it'd be quite hard to write that i think
S0423	mm
S0421	i don't really know if arthur conan doyle be that way incline or anything
S0423	i don't think he be
S0421	no
S0423	friends with have you hear of houdini
S0421	yeah
S0423	and he go once i think be he interest in spiritualism or something and he really want to disprove
S0421	maybe
S0423	that it exist cos a lot of people pretend to be
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	to contact the dead then
S0421	yeah there be load of like fake then
S0423	trick and stuff yeah and houdini cos he be a magician he manage to you know all the reason how they do this stuff
S0421	yeah
S0423	or be i think of lewis carroll i can't remember if it's arthur conan if it be arthur conan doyle
S0421	well lewis carroll be erm like a mathematician
S0423	oh be he
S0421	yeah he do maths at cambridge
S0423	oh right that's very unusual isn't it
S0421	i know
S0423	the stuff he write
S0421	yeah but i've get a book that i've not have chance to explore properly and it's about alice in wonderland and like er like an analysis and about like maths in it
S0423	mm
S0421	and there be there be like some mathematical things like hide in it
S0423	oh right
S0421	but i dunno yeah you it's like you you you just generally don't imagine writers to be any in any way like mathematical or scientific it's like
S0423	mm
S0421	like i mean he write like alice in wonderland that's so it's like surrealist isn't it
S0423	yeah
S0421	doesn't really seem to be any maths
S0423	although they say er to be you know if you be really good at maths you have to be quite creative
S0421	yeah
S0423	be creative er
S0421	yeah but einstein be scientific and he be like imagination be more erm what be it knowledge er i i use to know this quote something about knowledge but then it's get imagination encircle the world so i don't know what the knowledge bite be i think it's like knowledge be important something along those line
S0423	imagination be erm
S0421	yeah more so and he's like if you want your children to be intelligent read read them fairy tales that's what he say
S0423	see all those fairy tales i use to make up for you
S0421	well could they be class as fairy tales
S0423	yeah
S0421	if you make them up i mean like yeah you can write your own i really like cos i do that project on fairy tales
S0423	mm
S0421	er and like although fairy tales be like be originally you know like
S0423	well know when einstein say fairy tales he just mean a really good story kind of thing doesn't he
S0421	he mean stories yeah although he he he i mean he be german so he may well have be
S0423	strange fairy tales
S0421	reference the grimms there
S0423	i think he germany
S0421	yeah i know but that but back then back then it it would've probably be mainly fairy tales that be tell
S0423	yeah
S0421	but what else would they be like to children they would be or like folk stories
S0423	yeah
S0421	that's what they would've be tell them that's what the grimms do although i don't know how long ago be einstein it might've still be mother goose's household tales or something
S0423	well he be probably bear in the nineteenth century and he
S0421	yeah
S0423	his work be kind of like early twentieth century wasn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	that it become well know for relativity and so on theory of relativity
S0421	it might not have be it might've be grimms by then
S0423	why who's the other one
S0421	hans christian andersen no but i be just say like the time
S0423	what be they be before grimms
S0421	no they be about the same time
S0423	well he be danish wasn't he
S0421	yeah no but he i mean like erm cos i be say the book the book of grimms' fairy tales it might've be still the tale of mother goose
S0423	well grimms do they make them up or they they're historical tales that they just write down
S0421	no they erm well they they collect them but they edit them themselves
S0423	well yeah so they they didn't make them they're kinda folk stories aren't they
S0421	yeah they well they be they be folk stories but erm
S0423	but it's i always imagine they're original work by them that they'd write
S0421	well well they although they do go around germany and get the stories from people the
S0423	they add to them and
S0421	they have be change a lot like through the years i don't know like the first edition might have be more the first the very first edition might have be more true to the originals but i do imagine that like they would've change them anyway themselves
S0423	yeah they they've not come up with any original story though
S0421	er no but so then the
S0423	hans christian andersen be his original like the ugly duckling and stuff like that i think it be wasn't it
S0421	i think it be yeah
S0423	he he be a storyteller his his stories rather than rework fairy tales
S0421	but but the erm yeah yeah i know but i don't think i think a lot of them now like the ones we know now erm they be change a lot the grimms change them quite a lot cos they use to add in like different things that they want to and then the publishers insist on different things in later editions as well so whether they can be consider like you know like fairy tales any more
S0423	yeah
S0421	like they be kind of very much a product of grimm
S0423	yeah
S0421	but yeah no i think hans christian andersen write them
S0423	yeah i think he be original tales aren't they stories
S0421	yeah but like the grimms in term of like they're probably older because they're like
S0423	i've not be look where we're go i don't think we would've pass it yet would we
S0421	no hopefully not
S0423	poison
S0423	oh
S0421	poison imagine where be you from oh i'm from poison
S0421	i think erm cos there be a french person er i think he be a no like a writer i don't know if he collect the stories but i think he write them himself he's call charles perrault or perrolt i don't know probably perrault but if not perrolt
S0421	oh
S0423	do you see the language there
S0421	no
S0423	say something in another language it must be
S0421	oh no he write like little red rid hood and that's like the first instance of it in print
S0423	yeah but he didn't write that do he
S0421	yeah but he might've do i don't know
S0423	i think that's a folk tale again
S0421	maybe i don't know if he write it or if
S0423	to make children beware of wolves
S0421	but we don't know if we he he write it or erm he just write it down he probably just write it down
S0423	and he's french
S0421	yeah that's the first record instance it be i think
S0423	what time be that
S0421	erm just before grimm
S0423	when be they
S0421	dunno like sixteen hundreds or something
S0423	really
S0421	seventeen hundreds maybe i think perrault might've be sixteen or sixteen
S0423	yeah it be kinda the time i imagine or seventeenth
S0421	yeah
S0423	whatever it be i didn't think it be too recent
S0421	yeah and i think he do cinderella as well oh what do you know no cos cinderella i'm sure that's french
S0423	er it do sound yeah it do seem like french
S0421	yeah so yeah cinderella i think he do cinderella first and then but grimms have get cinderella as well
S0423	do we not go off at
S0421	doesn't say anything about
S0423	be on the coast probably around there
S0421	we might've pass this
S0423	really
S0421	although no that be and we need to change at the that's gonna be
S0423	oh be it we're there
S0421	although what no isn't here but i saw it just there like a turn off

S0421	yeah they both say thirty four minutes
S0423	be it say how far away till we turn
S0421	no cos it doesn't know where we be
S0423	well how can it know how long till we get there
S0421	it doesn't it doesn't know what road we're on so it doesn't know where we're gonna turn cos it it think we're in the middle of that field over there
S0423	yeah but how can it know how long we're gonna arrive
S0421	cos it know where we be but it doesn't think we're on the road it think we're in that field over there
S0421	accord to this map that's where it's get the arrow over there in that field
S0423	that doesn't make any sense though
S0421	that's where it be
S0423	oh
S0421	sheep yeah look
S0423	eh
S0421	think we're in that field look
S0423	oh well it's rubbish then isn't it no point in us depend on that satnav
S0423	queue ahead
S0421	doesn't seem to be queue
S0423	no maybe there be rush hour or something what what be i look for the be it
S0421	at hill branch leave
S0423	yeah
S0421	then at roundabout take the third exit onto the
S0421	yeah so you're gonna branch leave before you go to the roundabout
S0423	that thing on my phone's not say to go leave
S0421	no
S0423	oh look at all these queue but why we have to go forty mile an hour along here it's silly
S0421	that's probably why there's queue oh there's no queue
S0423	exactly
S0421	wow look at that lake
S0423	i think it be some massive thing
S0423	not very big be it
S0421	quite big
S0423	so have anything happen on mine
S0421	no oh we're on the road
S0423	be we on the road now
S0421	yeah
S0423	how long do it take
S0421	thirty three minutes
S0423	oh right shall we just follow this
S0421	yeah shall i turn this one on
S0423	yeah
S0421	it'll be use your thing
S0423	yeah do you know how to get it off
S0421	yeah i just close all windows do you want me to look at this message
S0423	no you don't have to check message instantly you know i i i'm not
S0423	eager for a a i i'm not a surgeon that need to attend a major operation i'm on holiday
S0423	probably from the phone company tell me something
S0423	not look cos it's stupid if it be something urgent somebody'd ring me do you respond to message immediately
S0421	if i see it then yeah but if not then no you might have an sos message
S0423	off who
S0421	dunno anyone sos
S0423	who's it from do anyone say
S0421	i didn't look now you're think be it an sos message
S0423	i've never have an sos message so i'm not likely to get one
S0421	neither have i but you never know might be sos stop please help stop
S0423	could be why be you not at work think you're suppose to be on holiday get get back here
S0421	that's how they use to on the telegrams isn't it they always put stop
S0423	yeah cos they write it kinda shorthand
S0421	cos you have to pay per word didn't you
S0423	well per letter probably possibly character or
S0421	per letter and they they they wouldn't use like function word they they just like put like i shop tomorrow do you know what i mean instead of i be go to the shop tomorrow
S0423	well yeah that's why
S0423	at the end of a sentence you'd have to
S0421	well there wasn't any punctuation
S0423	well yeah sentence yeah
S0421	that's why they put but stop that's four letter be that really
S0423	no they they'd put a they don't mean like a full stop
S0421	no they would write stop
S0423	how how do you know that
S0421	cos i i i know stuff about telegrams
S0423	no they wouldn't write stop
S0421	they would
S0423	well you mustn't be charge for that word
S0421	well maybe that's what they'd do cos there be no punctuation
S0423	oh right
S0421	it would literally so stop so you'd know where the sentence stop
S0423	oh right
S0421	because you would have to type it out on like a morse thing wouldn't you
S0423	well before telephone yeah
S0421	yeah
S0423	and then they they they would have a they just only use to have telegramming but they have telephone and they wouldn't use that
S0421	oh
S0423	they'd they'd still type a message out and have deliver it which'd be a telegram so the original telegrams yeah you'd be do it by telegraph
S0421	yeah that's what i'm on about
S0423	yeah so well you'd still have the same thing in existence even when telephone exist
S0421	so how do they do it on telephone
S0423	well you ring them up say i want to send er a telegraph
S0421	oh and you'd tell them and they'd write it down
S0423	yeah so they hand deliver it
S0421	oh
S0423	erm
S0421	i don't know about that
S0423	to the person you know
S0421	i only know about the morse one and i know that you use to have to write stop
S0423	oh right right
S0421	cos you can't cos obviously you can't put full stop that mean something in morse cos it's dash dot
S0423	oh i see what you're say yeah with the original er
S0421	so you have to put stop
S0423	telegrams yeah oh for the telegraph that's a telegraph message isn't it like that
S0421	yeah
S0423	yeah so you'd you'd have you'd er also a service telegram you hear of a telegram
S0421	yeah
S0423	so you could ring up and give your message and then they would hand deliver it
S0421	oh like a sing telegram
S0423	er you know if something urgent if if well
S0421	yeah
S0423	not necessarily that but yeah that be kind of that come from it but if you have an important message that need to be you know it's usually for emergencies or if there quite often bad news so if somebody say you've get a telegram
S0421	oh yeah
S0423	what's happen have somebody die or something
S0421	yeah i do say i say telegraph but then you start talk about telegrams
S0423	oh right
S0421	so then i think oh it must be call a telegram cos i always get those two mix up yeah
S0423	no the telegrams yeah that that be before telephone wasn't it it be er before telephone be invent a way of communicate yeah they'd use like morse code for that
S0421	yeah
S0421	but that'd take age wouldn't it because it's like three dot or like three you know what i mean it's quite a lot for one letter
S0421	isn't sos dot dot dot dash dash dash dot dot dot
S0423	well you you i don't know
S0421	i think sos be the only one i've ever learn and i think that's what it be
S0423	well yeah i i know what it be but i don't know what it be now well yeah the person who's do it would be really quick and quite skilled wouldn't they
S0421	yeah yeah we we be teach they teach us the er brownies and we all have to stand in the room and send message with our torch
S0423	oh right
S0421	and they teach us sos and tell us to remember that one because if we're ever strand on a hill we can get our torch and call for help that's what they tell us that like ever since i be like oh better remember that
S0423	but now mobile phone be invent you don't
S0421	yeah no but you might not get erm
S0423	signal
S0421	yeah but i i mean i'm sure there be mobile phone when i be at brownies
S0423	yeah you're on a hill and you'll be flash your light in the distance say oh what's that light
S0421	oh yeah
S0423	shut the window shut the
S0421	no one's gonna know that like probably wouldn't even see it unless you've get a really powerful torch
S0423	it's good on to be do stuff like that
S0421	yeah but
S0423	extra knowledge on that kinda thing i hope we come to a garage soon sos
S0423	do you think there's a thing there dot dot dot that you can
S0421	oh can you imagine if that's what the breakdown phone be like you have to send it in morse
S0423	well this be slow us down quite a lot
S0421	but didn't you see them didn't they at one point have when a telegraph be come through it like the machine would punch hole in a piece of paper or something
S0423	no that's a teletype or something
S0421	oh
S0423	that's a different thing cos have
S0421	no i think i saw it on a film
S0423	not sure right
S0421	be that so the person wouldn't have to listen so carefully
S0423	i've no idea i don't know what that's gonna be i don't know how could somebody interpret it
S0421	cos it would be a dot or a dash
S0423	oh right
S0421	i don't know
S0423	like braille
S0421	maybe oh it's so cool and like it'd be so cool to read braille cos like i always on like box of like medicine or like cream or whatever not always but on most of them have it in braille and i'm like oh like touch it like oh
S0423	well
S0423	it's better that you can actually read it rather than touch it
S0421	and erm on the i i've i realise that you know the erm stop button on bus they have braille on that i always wonder what the little
S0423	oh right
S0421	and i i i be like i it never kind of click and then one day i press the button and i be like oh it say it in braille
S0423	mm yeah i never really notice that but now you mention it
S0421	and also you know like before you're about to cross the road and they have all those like knobbly tile with the dot and they're not nice to stand on that's so
S0423	yeah
S0421	blind people know that the road's come up
S0423	yeah
S0421	i be i be like why do they have these
S0423	yeah
S0421	that's probably why it be
S0423	suppose unless we need to know we don't really pay much attention
S0421	yeah
S0423	oh look hill in the distance
S0421	where
S0423	they've go behind
S0423	tree
S0421	they've go they run away
S0423	yeah that turn off's still not come up have it strange
S0421	basically just carry on and don't bear leave
S0423	just keep go straight
S0421	thank for that
S0423	what road be we on be we on the
S0421	yeah oh wind turbines hey you know that book erm the curious incident of the dog in the night time
S0423	mm
S0421	that title have come from sherlock holmes hound of the baskervilles
S0423	oh really
S0421	yeah because erm it's something like i can't remember the exact exact quote erm it be something like oh it be a curious incident and watson be like what be so curious about it and then sherlock holmes be like nothing happen or something like that
S0423	mm
S0421	it come from there and cos i cos i be read that book and there's like all these like sherlock holmes reference in it as well
S0423	oh right yeah it's be make into a play that win win load of award
S0421	but like it be it it didn't click like the title didn't really click until i be like oh there's sherlock holmes in this and then like i didn't realise i didn't make the connection yeah i didn't really enjoy the book very much
S0423	do you not
S0421	no have you read it
S0423	be it no it's not a be it
S0421	yeah
S0423	oh we're only nineteen miles now
S0421	i think it be quite interest erm like his perspective be quite interest but
S0423	yeah yeah it's quite famous isn't it
S0421	mm
S0423	yeah i should make the effort to try and start read some book some kind of book that be have interest for me cos i tend to see a i'm gonna read a book i'll just go for something that's cheap
S0421	yeah then they're just rubbish
S0423	yeah well they're readable
S0421	yeah
S0423	they're not page turners
S0421	but if you go for erm some classics if there's some classics that be interest you they're usually you can get them so cheap
S0423	from where
S0421	amazon
S0423	oh really
S0421	yeah like
S0423	okay
S0421	some of them like what have i get i get erm like if you get like the the paperbacks some of like the really plain look ones they're quite cheap
S0423	actually you know classics be there be quite a few that i think but you know i've read some as well like
S0421	yeah
S0423	classic you know i've really love you know famous stories and some of them just they can be quite
S0421	slow
S0423	well you have really have to labour don't you you don't you don't always get
S0421	yeah
S0423	the satisfaction out of it that you cos you kind of
S0421	like a page turner
S0423	yeah depend what you're read for doesn't it you know i've be interest in load of it it's good read them but like i've get moby dick and
S0421	oh even yeah but other
S0421	even among classic readers moby dick be
S0423	i think i've read a a certain amount of page but
S0421	like people just er don't go for that one
S0423	the thing be the book the prose be really thick and the word
S0421	it's basically a guy that have to hunt whale basically
S0423	yeah but i could find it
S0423	you know i could see why that might have its interest but again it probably be worth labour through it
S0421	do you think
S0423	but the word be the book i've buy for really cheaply
S0421	really small
S0423	and the the word be tiny so i really struggle to kind of even read it so i need to yeah it it probably would be best maybe intersperse some classics with some good book you know
S0421	if you enjoy sherlock holmes you may may like the moonstone by wilkie collins
S0423	oh right
S0421	it's like one of the first kind of proper like detective novels i think
S0423	what be it an old one
S0421	yeah
S0423	oh right
S0421	it be like i'm not sure that yeah it be like a it's about erm i think it's like i know it's about a moonstone in like i think it's from india or something
S0423	it's about what
S0421	it's about a
S0423	what what do it say turn now
S0421	take the take the fourth exit at the roundabout but there isn't one
S0423	maybe i should've turn leave there and it didn't tell me
S0421	er oh
S0423	this satnav why do i trust it
S0423	so my phone on we're only twenty miles away unless what's it do now look it's lose us
S0421	i know it think we're in the field
S0423	yeah my phone put it on travel by car it should have a voice thing on shouldn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	oh it's back on now be it fourteen miles maybe i should just follow the sign
S0421	yeah
S0423	tell me where to turn off then go back to that
S0421	yeah
S0423	when we get close to it
S0421	no it's back here
S0423	look there's a leave turn here what's it say there i bet i have to turn leave back there didn't i
S0421	probably yeah
S0423	but it didn't say turn leave do it maybe this be quite a new no it's not new it be a new road recognise it maybe section of it've change what's that b road i think it say to go up that i've not see that thing on that sheet at the end of the road
S0421	what
S0423	that where we have to turn off leave
S0421	hill
S0423	yeah what's the b road you go on to
S0421	er that's right at the bottom that's
S0421	at roundabout take second exit onto way
S0423	that's further down
S0421	but that's after you've turn on to
S0421	that's quite a while
S0423	look more wind those
S0421	oh wind turbines
S0423	there's the service as well
S0421	oh yeah
S0423	service
S0421	i always call them windmills cos you call them windmills
S0423	why why didn't i go in there for some fuel no you say wind turbine before
S0423	what
S0421	yeah yeah because i'm consciously like decide to call them turbines because i call them windmills in my french
S0421	i call them windmills in my french lesson when we be do erm global warm and stuff and people be like windmills what do you mean because i look up i look up windmills in the dictionary and get the french word
S0423	cos i think
S0421	and it's a turbine it's not a mill it's not a mill it's not a windmill it's a wind turbine but it's a completely different word in french so it be really obviously
S0423	oh right
S0421	and people be like why be you go on about windmills and i be like cos windmills they're like no it's wind turbine and i be like oh and i get that from you
S0423	er do you
S0421	yeah you you always call them windmills
S0423	oh right
S0421	so i i like call them wind turbines now because
S0423	yeah a windmill it it it the old flour and so on and stuff
S0421	it's a mill yeah it's essentially the same thing though i mean
S0423	well the operation the wind turn the sail doesn't it i think try my phone that satnav and i don't know where we're up to on that sheet there so and as we get into i need to know where we're come a different way from that i can get a bite lose
S0421	right shall i turn this other satnav off
S0423	you may as well it doesn't seem to work right do it
S0421	yeah right we're off we should be there in seventeen minutes
S0423	really be it on voice thing now
S0421	yeah well it say i click on the settings then it say mute so i'm guess it's on loud
S0423	alright yeah i don't know if my volume be up
S0421	oh right yeah it's up loud
S0423	just about have enough fuel to get here be about ten pound worth leave in it
S0421	they look like volcanoes over there
S0423	yeah look at those hill they look really weird
S0421	yeah
S0423	like kind of point aren't they
S0421	and they've get like a bite of white on them like
S0423	yeah
S0421	ash or something go down the side why don't we have any volcanoes in this country
S0423	i don't know
S0423	it's to do with where you be in the erm in the world isn't it they have the the fault seismic fault run through
S0421	oh yeah
S0423	and you have to be on that line i guess don't you
S0421	oh yeah we don't really have any do we but it's funny because
S0423	i think i know earthquakes be affect by that i don't know if volcanoes be the same kinda thing affect by not sure
S0421	yeah because isn't it like
S0423	they're only in a certain part of the world
S0421	yeah because i think like hill be form something like where it's be push together isn't it like the land so
S0423	or it's be by the river
S0421	yeah
S0423	over billions of years the river
S0421	yeah
S0423	create a valley but i i don't know if something like the himalayas be that create be that kind of like push up wasn't it
S0421	yeah i dunno
S0423	can we turn leave here
S0421	duh duh duh duh duh er
S0423	gotta figure out what the sign mean leave for
S0421	i think so
S0423	look like it
S0421	er right there we go erm yeah
S0423	be this it yeah be this that turn off we be suppose to be look for yeah look how long it's take to get here it say it like it be right away
S0421	hill yeah shall i turn this off cos we can just use the paper again
S0423	no leave it on cos we're not far
S0421	use the leave lane to take the ramp
S0423	the ramp ramp
S0423	be it american that voice
S0421	i don't know i don't think so
S0423	like where where be he now third
S0423	yeah
S0423	sign anyway
S0421	one two three me and mummy always count the exit
S0423	why
S0421	to make sure we get the right one
S0423	i can't believe it it it start like we have to straight after
S0421	yeah it be like boom
S0423	wait i should've ask you how many miles between well we're only nine miles away
S0421	buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh
S0423	i'm get quite low on fuel like
S0423	we'll have enough to get there i think
S0421	we'll have to call your pick up out
S0421	your
S0423	what do he say do now
S0421	in point three miles
S0423	we're come up to something take the fourth exit no first exit
S0421	oh be it
S0423	that's what the sign say what's the sign gonna say
S0421	it should say it again
S0423	it should tell you there now be it straight on
S0421	it it's show you there don't know what that be
S0423	that's not
S0421	be it the third
S0423	well that say
S0421	mm mm mm mm oh yeah we to take the third
S0421	oh well it'll redirect you rerouting
S0421	yeah
S0423	this seem like this seem like it should be the way we should've go
S0421	yeah
S0423	well it might take us a different way you know for the camp
S0421	yeah
S0423	be it say any different time or anything
S0421	no fourteen minutes
S0423	be it
S0421	yeah me and mummy always count the roundabout stop to make sure we get the right one
S0423	yeah
S0421	cos sometimes it's not clear do you not count them
S0423	i kind of in my head just look at them
S0423	i don't go one two three and all that just do it in my head can't i
S0423	but you yeah you just pay attention which what you're go past and what you're come up to
S0421	be that a these bend be a bite sharp aren't they you can't even see what's come round the corner
S0423	mm
S0421	all the cyclists that could be you
S0421	yeah that must be so scary to all of a sudden hear like a car vroom vroom that be he gonna knock me over
S0423	you know he's not cos he's he can see you the driver's not blind be he get an open road there so you have to ride with confidence if you're nervous then that's it you've have it you you're more likely to
S0421	oh i like those bush
S0423	yeah
