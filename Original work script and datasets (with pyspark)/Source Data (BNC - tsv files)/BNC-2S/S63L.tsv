S0261	okay if you wanna put it that way
S0262	can i ask you a question please i don't understand i do understand what you're where's you're go but i'd really like to know what be it that you wanna do with your life cos this be all about you change career you know you know when you say i don't wanna do engineer any more which be fine have you now figure out what it be apart from just grow a business but what what's what be you passionate about what what be gonna get you up in the morning and go great i'm gonna do this and i'm gonna do that what be it that you like
S0261	okay well er well er well well part part of this go back to the discussion i have with
S0262	yes
S0261	okay
S0262	yeah
S0261	i'm gonna ask the same question and and it's a case of what can be align in such a way that you and i work together do things that we be interest in that provide us the lifestyle that we're interest in that's what i
S0262	but i don't know what you like you know what i'm like you know i love i be passionate about education
S0261	i i know you er you're make a point but you're actually cut me off
S0262	but i don't know what you're
S0261	you're you're cut me off so you're not hear me out
S0262	i've hear it twice
S0261	yeah
S0262	i we're align with each other
S0261	yeah that's right okay so what can we do right that we have skills in that we're interest in i'm a visual person i like photography i'm interest in video stuff it's feasible that we do erm some kind of element of erm er not film base but documentary base information that could be delivery of whatever product in that media digitally online to whatever audience okay
S0262	so what's that call then as a as an overarch word
S0261	as a er er well you could say a documentary maker or er a digital product maker producer
S0262	mm digital producer
S0261	a digital producer
S0262	mm
S0261	so erm you you've get er
S0262	mm
S0261	you could you could call it media
S0262	be be that what you're do now digital producer
S0261	well er well er
S0262	be that an example of digital production
S0261	that that that be an example of of produce digital content which be call web design and web development
S0262	right
S0261	okay so that's create a an a a web page that that also combine erm er online retail business yeah erm and er and an element of also erm bring together exist systems and create new systems
S0262	so be that still digital producer if you're create new systems
S0261	it it's in the context of a digital producer
S0262	or be you a systems engineer
S0261	you're not forget er forget systems engineer forget the systems stuff
S0262	right
S0261	i'm i'm create digital products which be be present online and the digital through digital media in a digital way yeah it's all digital okay
S0262	right okay so let's just say
S0261	so i'm think i've er i'm i'm learn new skills that one should be build on yes
S0262	okay i i you see i need i need i need definitions and i need i need title
S0261	yes
S0262	i can't i can't work without know who you be and what you do yeah
S0261	yes that's right
S0262	cos that's so much easier that's why we say teacher teacher what do a teacher do
S0261	mm
S0262	definition right okay get you so let's just say you're a digital producer right now okay what do a digital producer do can you summarise it for me and i'll take note and try and summarise it yeah
S0261	erm i don't know whether there's such a thing i just i just come off the tongue i don't know whether there's a er that's the normal way somebody call it
S0262	but this be your definition
S0261	my my definition
S0262	yeah be
S0261	of of that be erm er it's er a producer of digital content
S0262	mm
S0261	er that digital content can be break down into image visual digital image and that can be erm film video photography
S0262	et cetera et cetera right okay
S0261	yeah we've get er web page web design web development so graphic design erm there's the project management
S0262	oh
S0261	as part of it
S0262	right i be hop you be just gonna stick on the definition of digital producer
S0261	well i think that be part of it
S0262	okay
S0261	yeah
S0261	okay
S0262	mm
S0261	erm er so erm there there be erm er social media social media erm internet market erm we can call a subset be be search engine optimisation seo that'll do for the moment
S0262	okay
S0261	okay
S0262	so what i would do be i would take that write it
S0261	i'd probably refine that
S0262	yes
S0261	mm
S0262	work on it and send it to and get his review on what you think it be a digital producer do cos when you go out into the market place
S0261	you need to be clear about what you're call
S0262	and then you call yourself a digital producer and everybody else be like this isn't what a digital producer do or yeah yeah that's exactly what a digital producer do so when you be create what that actually mean cos there might be such a thing as digital producer exist already in the world i like the name of it i think it's fantastic but i think you need a second opinion whether that's actually mm accurate
S0261	well i've just put together the skillset that i'm start to learn that's all
S0262	exactly
S0261	mm
S0262	but we know from what 's work be be that he already tell us there be people like this and they've get job title and they might be freelancers he work with freelancers quite a lot if you look in his linkedin you'll see all the creative title that people give themselves as freelancers
S0261	yes
S0262	so i be just say if he's get some time and you write it up nicely and get you get some word go in there might give you some better word to choose to describe it yeah so that it's really accurate in term of what a digital producer do and then you can pick and choose whether that's what you want inside your own definition
S0261	so i see that er as as part of a tool to er lead into this
S0262	yeah yeah yeah fine
S0261	yeah
S0262	yeah fine
S0261	it's a tool
S0262	yeah
S0261	it's basically a series a set of skills that you can use as a as a tool to to get to to to do something that's relate to that
S0262	right okay and then i'll tell you what bits i quite like the idea of as well okay
S0261	mm but you see i don't actually think that in the bigger picture that fit that
S0262	well you don't you don't know yet
S0261	mm
S0262	cos you don't actually know what this be
S0261	it fit what i want that to be
S0262	ah well this be what i've be ask you what do you want to do rather than what want to do
S0261	right yeah well that's what i'm do at the moment yeah
S0262	so this be
S0261	at the moment i haven't get a real tangible vision of what i want to do but i can see there be things there that interest me on the in the context of as long as i manage it i don't do it yeah
S0262	okay yeah
S0261	so it's the where the the the producer be
S0262	yeah
S0261	so what i'm say be i'm try it out at the moment get a certain basic skillset and then manage others to bring together a project
S0262	only if you have some project of some size if you didn't have a project of some size you wouldn't need somebody else to do it
S0261	mm well if you have a quantity of project of of of x size you would have somebody else do that work
S0262	absolutely
S0262	i would suggest though that you're gonna be do a lot of this on your own to start with as you're grow the business
S0261	yes i know that
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah yeah yeah but er but i'm of the point of view that er that as long as i know a bite about how that work then i can outsource that and get others to do it and simply
S0262	mm okay
S0261	you're deal with the margin while you're allow yourself to build your time to build other things yeah because other people have a lot more skill than i do that stuff there's no point in me spend x amount of time try to skill up on that to a level where i could operate like they would
S0262	okay er that's something i don't know anything about and you i think you'll need to really take advice on that at the begin point of business you really do need to find out whether that's you know viable cos you have to pay someone you can pay yourself
S0261	yeah yeah yeah but i mean you wouldn't enter into that unless you you know you know a plus b equal c you know
S0262	right it's quite hard to get a and b together sometimes you know to get c but anyway what i think be that if if we work within this context i can see what you do and i can see and i can see that you know you can you can grow this whichever way you want to grow it but i can see why you would be a digital producer in this day and age
S0261	right okay
S0262	yeah
S0261	so what what mention be in in context of my interest in that your interest in education he simply say the idea might be that you could make go and make documentaries as an example of whatever erm and they're products that you would then sell as content to educational body to support any of their educational need right
S0262	there you go
S0261	educational what
S0262	consultant
S0261	yes mm mm yeah
S0262	and what i do best be i go in to the client me myself and i i find out what the brief be okay i put the brief together and then i give it to you
S0261	er yeah yeah fuck that
S0262	and then you go and design it
S0261	yeah i don't
S0262	and then i go back and deliver it
S0261	mm yeah i er i i i understand that but i i want to work at that top level as well
S0262	well you see that's the thing
S0261	mm
S0262	it's not obvious that we're gonna be able to work together on that top level someone's gonna have to
S0261	yeah but there's no
S0262	play second fiddle
S0261	there's no reason why you can't treat it as two different stream yeah
S0262	cos you always need to go and talk to a client and who's the person who's gonna go and talk to the client
S0261	well if it's er if it's if it's er er project or or products to to be produce in a certain way that both of you can do that because what what you've do by present it like that effectively be be be that erm you're at the top level and i er so so you're operate at the the top managerial level i'm the delivery guy and what i want to learn as a part of this process be how to own and operate business that's one of my main drivers yeah
S0262	yeah so maybe we leave me out of it until you've learn that and then we work together cos er that's what your driver be be that you want to be at that level and that's when you will be able to work with me cos we'll then be at the same level
S0261	yeah i understand it in the context of if you be start out and there be that disparity that's fine but i expect to learn out of that
S0262	i know
S0262	but you'll be learn from me
S0261	which be absolutely fine as long as it's quick learn and then you're on the same level you see
S0262	yeah well that's the thing be that if you
S0261	cos you don't wanna take age to do it
S0262	it's it's
S0261	this be i'm i'm very much about shortcutting things to to try and get somewhere fast
S0262	i know it's it's whether it's whether you can really catch up and learn really quickly
S0261	yeah well that's part of what this be about this be where i be go from and to yeah
S0262	well we're not start from the same point so you can't possibly catch up me
S0261	no well no that's what i've present here yeah
S0262	yeah so your logic doesn't work
S0261	no no what i'm say be over time that that be where the meet happen yeah
S0262	oh i see
S0261	er yeah over time that's where the meet happen so at the moment i'm do this learn whatever skills such that when you meet there you're actually operate in the same business as partner rather than a differentiator and what would be better be that you're both work at that level and you have others that be work at the other level yeah
S0262	so when i originally ask you the question why do you put me somewhere around about here then
S0261	erm because because in context of that i could deliver that right
S0262	well that's all i think i'd simplify for you by give you that
S0261	no yeah but that er i don't this this to me be a different conversation this be this be about something specific and i didn't really tangibly see where it be go
S0262	no you didn't you didn't see it
S0261	or what the purpose for it be
S0262	but you still give me the answer that i be look for which be how your mind work
S0261	that be in context of that right okay
S0262	yeah so draw me
S0261	but this be a whole different thing this be forget that forget that
S0262	er no no i'm not forget it
S0261	mm
S0262	because i think it be worthwhile
S0261	right okay in context of this they're not the same
S0262	well i beg to differ i think they're very much the same thing cos it's a project it's a project
S0261	yeah but we're not talk about operate a project we're talk about run a business
S0262	well i think yeah er the the
S0261	mm
S0262	the thing be be that normally you get a client first you go great we've get a fuck client
S0261	mm
S0262	and then it become what i'm call a business be that it start to actually earn some money over a period of time and that's what i call business but first project and then you grow business gotta get a project first
S0261	yes that's right and you've gotta deliver a project and
S0262	yeah
S0261	you've gotta prove that you're of x and you've get certain experience and then you can market yourself et cetera et cetera et cetera
S0262	yeah
S0261	so erm er er a part of this be you you know there's a lot of learn together along that timeline yeah to get to the point where actually things be in place such that this can exist
S0262	i know i i just i just think that because we're not both we're not really both educators i can't i i don't i can't really see how er you know
S0261	you're an educator
S0262	yeah but we're not both educators mean
S0261	mm
S0262	you know er it's not necessarily erm you know an industry that interest you i don't quite know why you'd
S0261	mm
S0262	come into that industry unless you'd actually be sort of vaguely interest in it
S0261	okay so if you've get if you've get
S0262	cos a digital producer be you could go and work for a company like
S0261	yeah but what i'm try to connect together be the two things that we be interest in right like that
S0262	but what be the two things we're interest in i don't be you interest in education
S0261	yes i be
S0262	what sort of part of it
S0261	well one thing i'm start to realise be that i do quite like teach things to people
S0262	okay
S0261	you know and i think people have tell me in the past that i'm i'm alright at explain stuff to people on a step by step type thing you know
S0262	mm mm
S0261	which be what i just produce today
S0262	mm
S0261	for somebody who have no real experience in something
S0262	mm
S0261	and for me that's very straightforward to explain that to teach somebody like something i can adapt to a variety of different people to teach them stuff okay
S0262	mm
S0261	erm and it be through talk with about some of the stuff that i've do in the past as part of my engineer thing
S0262	yeah
S0261	be that as a manager you're teach others other stuff
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah so and i'm and i quite like sit down and take this be how it work and da da da da da
S0262	yeah
S0261	so if if you consider the idea of erm education be er the product you be produce an education base product that help people learn something and that you need to deliver that product and that you're gonna deliver it in a digital medium and that let's say you have an understand of what the educational product need to be and the tool that be need to be produce to help somebody to learn
S0262	potentially yeah
S0261	yeah and that in the context of the way that erm the modern world be head a lot of that be the visually base output
S0262	true
S0261	and so if you have the digital skills be that you can make the film you can make the text you can make the imagery whatever the audio to put all of that stuff together that you can create that and you can publish it and you publish it through digital output and so the stuff i've be talk about as the digital producer be that you know
S0262	okay i'm gonna this be my theory and when i start teach i be here
S0261	mm
S0262	from about early nineteen nineties okay
S0261	yes
S0262	then i learn how to create erm resources for learners in word document
S0261	be there any more of that
S0262	yeah then okay start start like maybe play around with tape cassettes and and and and record my voice so that others could learn from my voice for pronunciation
S0261	mm
S0262	then er image and i become more interest in photograph and teach students to describe photograph and get their own photograph and then i'm move into this area now of well i've always love use film
S0261	mm
S0262	as an audio visual tool
S0261	exactly
S0262	erm and er i'm think that by the time i'm by i'm pretty sure maybe about fifty five
S0261	mm
S0262	i'll be back here again
S0261	mm
S0262	but i'll probably will be hang around this area for quite some time possibly might be something slightly different go on here between forty and fifty five
S0261	mm
S0262	but i don't see what that could possibly be now
S0261	right
S0262	i just can't think
S0261	mm
S0262	what else there be in the world that's gonna be any different from these things yeah
S0261	yes mm
S0262	if you can that's where you're gonna make a lot of money but i think i'm gonna be sit there at the age of fifty five and i'm gonna be sit down with students and i'm gonna be
S0261	go back to square one
S0262	yep
S0261	mm
S0262	and i'll be
S0261	because it become the social interaction that's important not the technical interaction
S0262	we're gonna be so bore of see people like everyone talk on audio visual on the internet and never really get to meet them and we'll just get we'll just run out of er enthusiasm for it yeah
S0261	interest yeah erm well it'll just become it'll become a tool that be actually only use when er when there's a focus output for it
S0262	and this be why i'm
S0261	
S0262	so interest in 's research because what he's suggest be it doesn't matter what er technology be do at any point in time the pattern social pattern
S0261	yes
S0262	and there be a language connect to that i'm i'm not talk about languages in a er french or german or english
S0261	mm
S0262	there's a there's a there's a something else language
S0261	yes
S0262	it's kind of like a design language
S0261	right
S0262	so designers when they talk to each other they have some sort of way of communicate you know
S0261	mm
S0262	or maybe when you design software you have another slightly different language whatever
S0261	yes
S0262	and i'm not talk just you know something go on be go on people create this at the moment and they're just pull this in but the people who be gonna actually have power will be the the ones who'd actually thoroughly understand how this work and can just basically create like you say a template i think it's not quite the right word but let's call it a template for the moment and basically can reproduce that template again and again and again and again in many many many many many many social contexts
S0261	yes
S0262	around the world
S0261	er i mean you i er i and so i'm i'm interest in what you tell me about this stuff yeah er i'm i'm i i have a interest in listen to what that be about okay so my point of view be be that erm whether it's a case of i'm an operator of the visual device that create stuff or whether i manage that to be do to the the output that we want it to be yeah and and still be a part of operate a business and that's just part of it right that's where i want to kind of connect with some of that kind of stuff
S0262	okay
S0261	so that's kind of the digital producer stuff but also you're run the business part that go with it alright
S0262	yeah and and yeah
S0261	and er part of that be bore
S0262	mm
S0261	but i mean it be er there be er a fundamental need to know how that work
S0262	the to me my definition of run a business be simply the ongoing activities of a business mean of a day to day go concern that mean one day you'll have to do your account the next day you'll have to pay your contract erm your erm you know for your for your internet connection
S0261	your cost and all that kind of stuff so
S0262	right that's just business for me
S0261	that's right
S0262	that's that's all it mean okay
S0261	mm
S0262	the stuff in your heart be the stuff that you're actually try to reach out to a customer or er or a
S0261	that's absolutely
S0262	and most of the time you're you're provide a product or a service
S0261	mm
S0262	so the stuff in your heart be the product or the service
S0261	yes that's right
S0262	the business be just how you keep that all go
S0261	yes that's right mm mm
S0262	so for me
S0261	so the thread be the business
S0262	the thread be the business yeah
S0261	yes
S0262	but but the stuff in my heart where i wanna be
S0261	mm
S0262	be i wanna be in that area
S0261	yes
S0262	okay because i've explore these different areas and i like them all
S0261	mm
S0262	and i've get some knowledge of them
S0261	right
S0262	but i'm not gonna be somebody's fuck audio visual bitch and just keep make fuck film for people or whatever there's plenty of fuck people out there to do that i don't mind outsource these people
S0261	mm
S0262	i have no problem with that when we find talented people
S0261	yes
S0262	but this be the mastermind stuff this be the stuff that most people who aren't clever enough to fuck think about it and how to grow it won't be able to do it and that's why they stay here
S0261	yes that's fine
S0262	okay
S0261	that's good and er it's exactly what er one would hope to achieve and and have as a direction
S0262	and that's what do when he do social media
S0261	he he find that core
S0262	mm
S0261	right yes mm
S0262	so i feel like i've find a core
S0261	right that's fine so that's good so
S0262	yeah but be that a core that interest you if we er er if we unravel it together and find out what it mean be there something maybe potentially you could go i'm open mind enough to unravel this a little bite more and then i'll see if something about it grab my attention enough to pursue it for ten years or eight years
S0261	however it go yeah
S0262	well you've gotta commit
S0261	of course of of no of of course
S0262	you er you you you you can't swap and change your products and service or you know you've gotta
S0261	er er er er er absolutely so what i'm try to identify be a core path that both of us can buy into and operate on
S0262	i know and that's what i'm try to do but i've tell you what my core be and i'm not gonna change it
S0261	that's great it's good to hear
S0262	but do you have a core that you can add to my core or be you gonna go with my core first and then change it into something else
S0261	what what what what kind of products do you
S0262	no there aren't products
S0261	there aren't
S0262	at the moment this be all totally theoretical
S0261	righto so so if you point point the fact that these different things exist as a part of that
S0262	mm
S0261	right they're a subset
S0262	mm
S0261	that that you do create things on the basis of this
S0262	mm
S0261	and they're a start when this come on board that's when you you change your attention to all of that so it's that you're produce something that make money
S0262	oh yeah
S0261	
S0262	and what you're tell em will tell em what you do normally with these two with er this type of thing be er er where the top dollar be always gonna be be on sell know how that's top dollar money yeah content be not top dollar yeah because the content be a product it's an output
S0261	so er it have a finite lifetime
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah so you're say sell knowledge
S0262	no cos knowledge and know how be not the same thing know how in business be a very specific term
S0261	yeah so you're you you you're demonstrate a mechanism by er er erm er something that somebody can learn to do
S0262	yeah but not too much
S0262	so that they don't get it for themselves and then just go away and reproduce it and then you've lose your core
S0261	but that's exactly how like some of these relationships work that i'm a part of now that that location rebel be effectively an old product and the guy who own and operate it have already move on to start his other stuff which he's interest in
S0262	right right
S0261	but this still work as a as a as a as an income earn stream of business
S0262	yeah cos
S0261	but his input into it be different because he's put somebody in between him and it who be now the person who's do the day to day operation of it
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah he still own it
S0262	he's grow he's he he he's grow as an individual
S0261	yes that's right
S0262	but so have the world grow so he's grow with it
S0261	mm
S0262	and that's what i'm tell you be that what i keep pick up on from my research from somebody who's apparently apparently one of the most erm visionary people in term of erm learn at the moment
S0261	yes
S0262	be
S0261	yes
S0262	okay
S0261	mm
S0262	and there'll be others around like him in the world
S0261	mm
S0262	but they're onto something and it's gonna be really really really big
S0261	so have you get a a context of how that might be realise in the real world
S0262	well yes because there's two things that you that you and i absolutely love we love design
S0261	yes
S0262	so i've never study architecture in my life but if i put this in front of the word architecture
S0261	learn
S0262	architecture mean not learn about architecture mean er okay er
S0261	the the learn architecture
S0262	the architecture of learn
S0261	the architecture of learn yes that's so that's the structure of how do one go about learn yes
S0262	and what be eventually gonna come out with maybe in a couple of years time be he's gonna come out with some really good clue for the rest of us to pick up on about what what okay what this actually be this be a new theory be bear right now
S0261	okay so er that as you've explain might be the context of of individual learn plan such that people can as independents of of a system find a mechanism to learn what they want the way they want to do it and so it become highly individualise and hint erm of benefit to everybody who want to be involve in that system
S0262	it's an evolution
S0261	but but er so er do you see that evolve in the context of our the exist way that education need to be
S0262	no
S0261	deliver not deliver what i mean be the the the fundamental value that education be provide to everybody
S0262	oh fuck yeah yeah
S0261	yeah so so so
S0262	education for everyone
S0261	it become an alternative mechanism to deliver that
S0262	yeah
S0261	education
S0262	yeah
S0261	but do you think that the context of the way that education be deliver and the way that governments control that stuff the budget and the money that this type of learn would become day to day normality
S0262	yeah but it er it will be about
S0261	twenty years
S0262	seventy when that happen
S0261	yeah it's a long time where it become the norm
S0262	yeah
S0261	however your example in sydney of somebody who be be of some outfit that be actually try to operate on this basis now
S0262	oh research yeah
S0261	they're they're carry out research
S0262	yeah
S0261	but at a at a at a er at a place where real people be learn real things in the way that they want to learn them for themselves
S0262	no they haven't get to that stage yet they're use people like us who be the er who be the the collaborators and they're try to learn how we use language and how we create in term of learn architecture so er we have we have educational designers we have learn advisors we have erm you know a number of of cool people who he perceive to be the people of the future as soon as these people understand how to efficiently collaborate with each other so that creativity be become efficient they will get much better at get blueprint or templates together and those people will be pass on the templates to the people who need it the most i e the individual learner
S0261	right so
S0262	and by the way there be lot of things in between school primary school secondary school universities
S0261	er er all of that
S0262	yeah
S0261	at different level so er be it feasible in a way i mean in be it er feasible in a way to provide somebody with that service in advance of a lot of research in your own mechanism
S0261	if you're think about people who operate at a certain level
S0262	yeah you could give it you could give it a go you could yes yes if you if you could give it a go as a bite of an experiment
S0261	mm
S0262	not necessarily as a business yeah cos
S0261	no but er you you your own r and d would be
S0262	yeah
S0261	take ten people
S0262	yeah
S0261	over a period of six months
S0262	yeah
S0261	and that you operate with them
S0262	yes
S0261	on such a level that you try and learn this together with these people
S0262	and i document it yeah
S0261	and you document it
S0262	yeah
S0261	and then you actually
S0262	yeah
S0261	try to run it as a business where you two people
S0262	yeah
S0261	the context of if you've get enough money
S0261	you can pay us
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah if you've get enough you can pay us
S0262	yeah yeah
S0261	like an individual tutor
S0262	yeah
S0261	however we will teach and we can demonstrate that the learn will be a lot more individual focus now you've get to have people with the freedom of mind to connect with that idea
S0262	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0261	and that's part of the problem because
S0262	yeah
S0261	they've be institutionalise throughout generations and over lifetimes
S0262	well no you just find a whole lot of different people who haven't like she'd be brilliant as er as one of them you know erm but remember when you're sell er literally when you're sell top dollar okay as an architect as a as a traditional architect the thing that cost the most amount of money be
S0261	the way that it's do the blueprint
S0262	er er er aren't they cool blueprint you spread them out and you look and
S0261	yeah of course of course yeah it's the tool and
S0262	think how fuck how much work have go into a blueprint that's why it cost so much
S0261	yes because somebody have to develop it right and if you're in it for the real business of it
S0262	mm
S0261	you would develop your own and you would hold that tool
S0262	mm
S0261	and you would use that tool to your advantage
S0262	mm
S0261	erm and that's when you start work with er business other providers to to use your blueprint to demonstrate something
S0262	you'd be work with some very clever people
S0261	yes and but there's i mean as an outsider effectively i don't see the context of of unless you're on the inside of all of that why anybody else would want to work with you because they'd go well i can do that myself
S0262	no they can't how the fuck can they do that on their own
S0261	no i'm talk about the people who be in on it
S0262	oh yeah but then not everyone's get the same reason to be in on it
S0261	yeah yeah okay
S0262	not everyone want to be an entrepreneur
S0261	no that's right but er what i see there be be er be a long period of time
S0262	yes
S0261	right so if if you say that's kind of at some point in the future in order to be able to do some things that build towards that you have to have a variety of step
S0262	yeah
S0261	a strategic kind of direction and
S0262	yeah and the research and development take a long time
S0261	that's right so if you say that that need to happen you need to be do something else that's still allow you to operate and bring an income et cetera
S0262	yeah
S0261	which could be go back to the bread and butter
S0262	well yeah exactly
S0261	you know that kind of thing
S0262	well that's not bread and butter that that's not bread and butter this bite be the bread and butter it's whatever you choose to do for the next you know how many however long it take to be a research and developer this be you here say this be the er the point where we go to the market with a blueprint we've get we've gotta bring on board people at the right time we've gotta get the right people on board we've gotta get the right developers in on time i mean we're talk about some big stuff here this be what you're good at do this be why you've get to go out and find people
S0261	yes that's right and that's true about build a team and bring the right people on board et cetera
S0262	yeah
S0261	so i appreciate i appreciate that erm
S0262	do you really know enough about software and how it's develop though this be the thing
S0261	well the you see the thing be er i don't i'm not convince you need to know how it's do
S0262	no you don't but you need you need to
S0261	but i i think you need to
S0262	you need to defend or attack software at the right time
S0261	er when you say defend or attack what do you mean
S0262	so if you have a blueprint and erm you use some tool
S0261	yes
S0262	to develop the the blueprint
S0261	yes
S0262	and somebody ask you why do you use those tool to develop the blueprint
S0261	mm
S0262	you could actually argue your case why you use these tool and not those tool
S0261	well and and part of that be be aware of
S0262	you need to know about software
S0261	er well it's about be aware of of the technology er software development of software where things be shift to in context of tech yeah so erm if i use an example i talk to about what he's do with his brother
S0262	yeah
S0261	neither of them really be computer people
S0262	yeah
S0261	his brother just sell shit in it
S0261	that's it's it's it's er he sell telephony service
S0262	right
S0261	you know so he's not an it guy
S0262	yeah
S0261	he doesn't make stuff
S0262	he's a salesman yeah
S0261	yeah but they have erm they have an idea and as long as you can bring together the idea with the right people erm and you pay for the right people to produce the products that you need produce like an app like er er a web app erm whatever you're just hire certain people with certain skills to do that
S0262	yeah
S0261	so you don't need necessarily need to know that you just need to know that i'm gonna hire x person of x quality to produce x yeah
S0262	okay okay but but but but sorry to cut you off but guess that a project manager have a fair bite of knowledge about all of these things
S0261	er over time yes
S0262	that's why you get experience and get good ones in so they actually know what the fuck these fuckers be do
S0261	yes that's right
S0262	and they can give em a fuck kick up the arse
S0261	that be right so you need er i mean er you know one way to manage it be by by by erm hire outfit that can demonstrate they have the the credibility so you pay top dollar for that or you you you you come across people who who have work for those outfit but no longer want to
S0262	mm
S0261	who offer who be actually try to do their own thing start out
S0262	mm
S0261	and that they don't cost so much because they they've gotta kind of but they have the skills and the quality et cetera and the awareness of how it do work
S0262	like a sort of thing he use to work for saab or whoever and he do something you know guy next door to us in
S0261	yeah yeah yeah exactly
S0261	yeah
S0262	and and
S0261	mm
S0262	when he go out on his own and become and he become a plumber but you know
S0261	of of course and they're people with very good skills
S0262	yeah
S0261	who you can rely on who
S0262	like
S0261	mm yes mm
S0261	yes exactly of course
S0262	so yeah there there be load of em knock around
S0261	yes of course so they're the people that you would try and work with
S0262	and they'll be about the same age like you
S0261	yes
S0262	mid mid change of career
S0261	yes but
S0262	yeah
S0261	but they're they're the kind of people that you would try and bring on board
S0262	yeah
S0261	but they're they're you you're just get them in at the right part of the process
S0262	yeah
S0261	to provide you a certain part
S0262	but do you agree with my assumption that to be an effective project manager you would need to know a fair bite about these things
S0261	well that yes and that and that be what make the difference between a top notch and whatever blah blah blah blah however the good one be somebody who be continuously learn and and hence there will be things where they need to learn different things within these things or that the rule have change and all of that
S0261	and they pick that up as they go and over time grow with that
S0262	well this that that well then that's you that's perfectly you
S0261	yeah
S0262	yeah that's why you can do that job
S0261	i mean it's not it's er yeah of of course because you can pick it up and learn it as you go
S0262	yeah but you're manage
S0261	mm
S0262	so you're do the people work as well
S0261	yeah
S0262	not just quality and lifelong learn like take an interest in their work
S0261	mm
S0262	but you're actually go mm i don't think he's really put as much effort into that as i think he should've do
S0261	yes of course and and and
S0262	and i won't get him to do more for me for the same
S0261	look i'm very able
S0262	yeah
S0261	to be able to find out put two and two together and say well do that equal what i want it to equal because it doesn't take much to find out enough yourself very quickly and it doesn't take much to connect with people who do know what the story be yeah
S0262	well fuck then that's good because you've get a bite of a talent for it then from what you're say
S0261	so you you yeah you just go well look i'm be deliver to the this be it right if er if you don't feel in your gut that it be right then you go to somebody else and you say would you mind have a look at this or can i ask you some question about this and you'll get a a an appropriate and i can usually pick up something look at it and go dunno about that you know i'll ask a few question you go back to the person you ask a few question
S0262	yeah but
S0261	all of that
S0262	remember you put experience in that area
S0261	yes
S0262	start a whole new subject from scratch it's like you've be put back at the age of whatever age it be you start in
S0261	that's right
S0262	university ah just think how long it take you to be able to do that in your subject area you think you're gonna be able to do the same in a new subject
S0261	yes of course
S0262	but what's the accelerator what's actually go to speed you up so it doesn't take as long as it take to in engineer
S0261	i be er no er the well the your point erm go back to the core of what a project manager be
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah and that er er er the the prince two side of project manager be somebody who generically have skills who can work in a variety of different things regardless of their background their their their core skill
S0262	mm okay
S0261	and they can operate in these different level in these different do different project right so what they be try to present be the idea that project managers that's a skill in itself er be a project manager the argument in certain outfit with things be that as a professional as a professional project manager in engineer you need to be an engineer and you need to know how things be build right that make common sense whereas if you be work as a project manager you could go along and you could work with people in the service people who who do er electrical infrastructure and you could probably operate that to a certain level by employ certain people with certain skill to ensure that they carry that yeah
S0262	okay
S0261	but
S0261	it's another one
S0262	yeah
S0261	right it
S0262	yeah
S0261	right i don't know how to put together er a a computer system but i know how to i'll probably be able to procure the right people to do it and make sure that they do what i want them to do to a certain amount and that's exactly what these people in the highway's agency be do they be certainly say we don't know how it's suppose to work we know what we want but we hire somebody to tell us what we want er
S0262	be it efficient
S0261	and then
S0262	do they run over budget
S0261	well erm in some case of course you do because er er some things be unknown however a well run operation do not go over budget
S0262	okay so as a as a project manager erm this would be equivalent in the film industry would be a producer and this would be er call a production manager
S0261	mm mm
S0262	and erm work as both erm you know you can imagine that's sound and that's you know wardrobe and that's you know you whoever and that's cater or whatever and like yeah fair enough i don't need to know a fuck of a lot about it but yeah i er i'm run with your argument a bite er that you you you you know in principle how it's mean to work yeah you've get er enough quality assurance control to be able to go you haven't do it right go back and do it again yeah and er you erm you be really a people person you know you be able to get the right type of contribution from the people at the right time
S0261	mm
S0262	when you need it
S0261	yes
S0262	and you can kick arse when it's not fuck happen right
S0261	of course
S0262	and you have to er but i still do think that go to film school and have work in these departments with people
S0261	you're you're ahead of the game
S0262	help me a hell of a lot to know what it feel like to be one of them
S0261	yes that that's true
S0262	so i know what it's like to be a caterer
S0261	yes
S0262	i know what it's like to er hold that fuck boom thing i know what it's like to be hang around with camera people and fuck cable and shit
S0261	yeah mm
S0262	i know what it's like
S0261	yeah so you've get a good gut feel of it
S0262	yeah yeah
S0261	yeah that's that's fine exactly
S0262	i'm not a specialist
S0261	and so if you be try to do this for new what you would do be you would put yourself in situations where you could ask the right question and learn about the stuff pretty quickly right so let's say that you bring together a team of people that you've never meet before and you've ask them to do something right and you've give yourself a week to say these people will do what they do you're say they're the right group of people to work collaboratively together and you say you need to do this simple whatever get the right team of people together and you be there work with them to do that stuff in that one week and you will learn a huge amount in that one week by put your time into that have that all together in the same place
S0262	okay okay and for a new era that's not a bad way of do it
S0261	yes
S0262	because we be talk about things that have be professionally be do for years and years and years
S0261	er er exactly
S0262	but if you be in a new area of design i say era sorry era
S0261	era mm
S0262	of design then potentially yes you be actually even the blueprint be not just the actual thing that you sell the know how
S0261	mm
S0262	it's the get together of the right creators and contributors
S0261	and er exactly so
S0262	but these be new people
S0261	yeah
S0262	on the block
S0261	so if you consider what i'm try to do at the moment and i have this idea in my head that i want to have a certain amount of things do i want to outsource them one thing i need to know be how how the fuck do you do outsource alright i don't know but what i can do when i'm away be i can meet up with two or three different people who actually do it and talk to them and find out in a short period of time a gut feel for how it work right
S0262	okay what i like about what you've just say before that and i agree with you for the at the er what you say be ask question sorry ask people question at the right time to get the most accurate
S0261	presentation
S0262	impression of what's really go on and what need to be do
S0261	yes of course
S0262	and by when
S0261	yes
S0262	so that's a project manager's remit
S0261	yes of course
S0262	okay now er er outsource to me it's just still like find your team yeah you're create a team
S0261	er absolutely of course all all i'm talk er i i don't like the word i'm go to call it remote work i don't like that either but it's
S0262	can't we just call it create a team
S0261	yes okay yes alright
S0262	okay so when you go to er when you go to countries you select to go and have a look
S0261	yes mm
S0262	there be the cultural things and observe business and all those sort of things that's great but another
S0261	the foundational things you need to understand
S0262	okay foundation be culture yeah you're right
S0261	yes
S0262	cultural way of do business you know all the way to how they shake hand and everything you try and soak it all up
S0261	yes
S0262	and erm but then on the other level you be think right shit if i be a project manager and i have to create a team er what be the step that be require to do that
S0261	yes
S0262	that's i think what you should do
S0261	exactly of course
S0262	yeah okay
S0261	right
S0262	good
S0261	so you ask that simple question and and over over dinner you can find out the answer to stuff
S0262	yeah
S0261	it's it's straightforward
S0262	yeah you need to get a thingy on
S0261	okay
S0262	but yeah if if you do that in asia but also definitely talk to
S0261	who sorry
S0261	yes yes er erm to ask question
S0262	and also talk to erm er anybody else we can think of
S0261	yeah and i think that what we wanna do now be actually write down who we think those people be
S0262	yeah okay
S0261	we be erm talk about create a team and have a understand a cultural foundation so when we consider in the future you want to create a team and if you look at the bigger wider context of you want to be try to create a business where you have the flexibility to live where you need to live or where you want to live and operate that business with freedom of move around from location to location right so then you can maximise erm things like if you want to go and hang with your dad for three months you could go and do that wherever or and then you could say well i want to go and hang here with somebody else for a period of time or you could just go to a certain location because that's where you want to go right so you create a team which can still work with your business and they can be locate wherever they want to be so they're a remote team
S0262	mm
S0261	yeah so part of what i'm think about be this the the context of the outsource that i'm talk about be that if i create er some kind of business stream that er that bring in some money which i'm work in an outsource context and put together all the thread that you need to work with to be able to operate that future business on that on that way
S0262	mm
S0261	right so you're say you you're do all of the the nasty things that you have to deal with which be find the right people make sure they can do what you want try some stuff out and then get people on board create a reliable relationship such that they erm continually deliver things for you to the quality that you want and the time that you want yeah erm and the more that you get to do that you're learn how to do that and also you're learn the skills to be able to sell that as a product to other people so that you bring business in from other people which you then outsource so you're provide you're the conduit to allow them to be outsource and you take a middleman's fee on it
S0262	and you run run that all past see what he make of what you're say
S0261	mm
S0262	cos i actually have get no clue what you're talk about not er not because i don't understand the english just that i none of this i've ever do i i've not read anything about it i'm not
S0261	right
S0262	aware of how it could operate i don't know how the money come in and how you get capital to pay people and how you pay people and er you know that's the things that i don't i wouldn't know how to do you know
S0261	right okay yeah well there be some guy out of these outfit that i be be listen erm listen to who operate businesses solely provide outsource service in the philippines for instance yeah and that they make good business out of that so they go and live in these place they make the right connections they get quality people to work with them and then they sell that as a product to people who need that particular skill set
S0262	no no i get that i get that
S0261	yeah
S0262	it's just that
S0261	all of that
S0262	for for your reality
S0261	mm
S0262	of how you put that all together erm and i think the biggest thing you've get to be think about now be money how do you finance that
S0261	yes exactly so if if i simply take what i'm what i'm just do now which be web design and development yeah if i'm if i can see that it's a worthwhile exercise to to to compartmentalise some of the things i've be do and ship those out and get clients first er you've gotta make the things fit together nicely in a box but if you can get clients' work in ship that stuff out get it back and you're allow yourself enough time to make sure that you're provide them exactly what they want how they want it to be do so you're probably do some work yourself but not all of it
S0262	i think i think i think i think erm i think for the first crack at this i think you're on er quite a complicate level and i think you need to seek business advice before embark on this a proper businessman who would understand how how do you deal with creditors how do you deal with debtors how do you you know what currency be we talk
S0261	well there be there's international stuff that you need to deal with
S0262	yeah so er
S0261	yeah
S0262	so talk to
S0261	contractual et cetera
S0262	er i'd say yes but get a lot of advice before you start run that yeah
S0261	yeah and and and the first thing i do i'm just gonna go on the location rebel community and ask them a bunch of question and say i want to talk to anybody who's get experience in do this stuff in asia and i want to hear the different stories and try and cherry pick out the key point that i can put together as these be a bunch of question i'm gonna ask some bigger point about
S0262	absolutely you see if you just go into your remit for the next you know if you set yourself a course about about always always always get that what you want
S0261	yes
S0262	get these answer yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	and if you can actually go i've get eighty seven percent success
S0261	yes
S0262	yeah on get answer that i think on your hunch or gut or whatever it be that you've use in the past
S0261	mm
S0262	if you can actually rate yourself and rate the answer
S0261	yes
S0262	then yeah you're you be find out how to create a team
S0261	mm that's right
S0262	absolutely yeah
S0261	so as an er example what i be think er of the other day which be slightly towards that but erm i be think i've gotta create a video out of the the stuff that i get for and
S0262	yeah
S0261	from and right
S0262	yeah
S0261	i've get to create that so i go on on on to fiverr dot com
S0262	yeah
S0261	cost five dollars
S0262	yeah
S0261	look for video editors
S0262	yeah
S0261	see what they can do
S0262	yeah
S0261	for fifteen dollars i can get three different editors to do three different things you've get three different creative products for fifteen buck
S0262	mm
S0261	and you go okay for fifteen dollars i've test who i want to go with
S0262	yeah
S0261	right and then you go back to the other person you say okay well i can see what you can do for five buck i'll pay you fifty dollars to produce something for me
S0262	yeah
S0261	i want something that's two minutes long out of this content and erm we want to have er something at the start and something at the end and some of these guy do animation and stuff like that so
S0262	yeah
S0261	mix and mix and match it and make it something fun this be the brief
S0262	yeah
S0261	and these be the thread that i wanna see in it put it together
S0262	yeah
S0261	and
S0262	but the i the the thing about this be this be all really good and all the stuff you've just say but again er i i really would like to know how you're gonna finance it when you pay somebody fifteen dollars or fifty dollars that's not not not necessarily obvious to me where this money be come from
S0261	no no that's right so so in in in that context the money er be come in in that i'm be pay to do this job right
S0262	er yeah this be doesn't
S0261	so it's an expense
S0262	yeah it doesn't work like that
S0261	it's an expense right
S0262	you need capital to before you get pay that capital
S0261	well
S0262	will see you through until you actually get pay
S0261	yes that's right
S0261	yeah i know that and i've get capital cos i've be pay two thirds of the job i've get that sit in a bank account
S0262	oh i see
S0261	yeah
S0262	oh
S0261	i've already get that i've already be through part of the process to get to the point where i'm try to finish something off
S0262	okay so
S0261	i decide base upon my effort and time that rather than me do it i get somebody else to do it
S0262	okay that's fine
S0261	yeah
S0262	er that's fine i didn't understand that so what you're say be be that the money that you get from
S0261	yes
S0262	be what you're call seed money
S0261	yes
S0262	to give this a go
S0261	well i'm call it in context of just what i talk about the bigger picture stuff erm yes i could call that that sorry i er i think we've go two different directions slightly
S0262	okay alright here's er here the thing be be that erm
S0261	in the context of what we've just talk about i could argue you use the money that's sit there fifteen dollars go out of that pot i've already get yeah and then i and then i choose somebody and i pay them fifty dollars and so i've create an expense yeah
S0262	er i think
S0261	which i can then claim back in the final invoice
S0262	i think you really need to go and do a a a a business er just a little short short cos
S0262	what you're say really doesn't work like that doesn't you really need to know how it work before you start play around with this with your own money but you need to ask that cos you won't believe me but ask a businessman and see if he understand what you're talk about
S0261	well what be you look the some of the stuff's very obvious to me right you need capital up front to fund something to be able to get it go right you need that money from somewhere okay and and you need to plan out with that pot of money what you expect it to cost to get to somewhere right try to meet a certain end before the income come in cos you need to provide yourself that er that float before you get into get income in
S0262	i think you need to break it up into manageable chunk
S0261	yes i yeah yeah yeah mm
S0262	yeah i think you just need to go to asia
S0261	mm
S0262	and fuck don't worry about revenue for the moment okay don't even worry about capital just just break it up into er one small thing
S0261	yeah
S0262	then come back
S0261	mm
S0262	and then just think about the next step er this be not gonna happen overnight
S0261	no i know that
S0262	capital need to come from somewhere
S0261	yes that's right
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	and you while you're go to asia and you're do what you're do you will start think how the fuck be i gonna get the money together to start do all this
S0261	mm mm
S0262	and that that'll be you solve that problem
S0261	yes that's right mm
S0262	but you don't have the answer to it yet
S0261	well once you put together a coherent plan in theory you can go to the bank and go er give us some money if you want to yeah or we can say we're gonna get this money from somewhere which pot of be we go to come bring this from if we see that there's value in it
S0262	yeah
S0261	or then you can do what's call bootstrapping and you can go and find a small job get some income in set set some of that aside as you receive money to go into your capital pot and do several of those till you build up your capital pot and then you carry on with what you do and that's what i suggest that before this this kind of get on the right thread do a series of things first to try and put that kind of mechanism in place so you're get an income stream that be help to then provide the seed to carry on with the bigger plan
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah so if you can come up with two or three income stream for different things that aren't large amount of money but they don't require a lot of your work online and there be things that you can do that don't require a lot of input but you don't get a lot of financial input either that's something that's quick and easy to do and you get pay five hundred to a thousand dollars to do it
