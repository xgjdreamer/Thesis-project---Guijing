S0115	it's that's unusual for the sixties to have well you have motown didn't you
S0037	yeah but that's sing mainly we didn't you didn't really get like women guitarists for a long time
S0115	oh yeah no no no that be when there there be there haven't be that many sort of female like guitar rock star with guitars have there
S0037	no
S0115	i mean big yeah i mean you could say like cheryl crow or something
S0037	yeah but i don't know if she's in the same sort of some country ones yeah a lot of the
S0115	yeah i be in alternative you have like uh uh um p j harvey and uh
S0037	everyone love a bite of dolly parton p j harvey yeah
S0115	uh the majority of female singers seem to just be tend to not have guitars like that i mean
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	uh
S0037	get trousers on and everything like
S0115	they have like proper sixties uh haircuts though
S0037	i like that i think i could uh revive that one that nice sort of curly one
S0115	um be that like
S0037	actually the i like sort of i like the sort of shorter ones that be bigger
S0115	what d'you call that it's like a what d'you call that haircut there
S0037	um i don't know but i quite like it maybe i should get one i'm sick of my long hair anyway
S0115	it's kind of round and like big at the top so like a beehive like
S0037	it's a bite like a a bite like a beehive yeah but it's also like ur um like a lego man's haircut a bite
S0115	yeah these the saturdays
S0037	oh yeah
S0115	kind of hear of them but
S0037	these be on uh ones that be on like a talent show one
S0115	oh do they
S0037	i still don't understand what be happen on the voice last night like what be that i don't understand the like the premise do you do you hear anything about it in the
S0115	all all i know be that it's be like you choose base on the sound not the performer
S0037	yeah but how pardon me but how do they get on there anyway because none of them be like terrible so they must've be like
S0115	must presumably they just apply and then maybe they get filter down but i don't know
S0037	yeah
S0115	um i could have a little look on the
S0037	no it's alright
S0115	smartphone to to to uh clarify that but uh no i don't
S0037	be the be the window open
S0115	i mean it's it's a good idea but also they start britain's get uh talent as well but i don't really like that very much so i didn't watch it
S0037	be it simon cowell that you don't like though
S0115	partly
S0037	cos david walliams be on it now and he be like
S0115	the simon cowell element yeah i think david walliams be i find a lot funnier than simon cowell
S0037	no but he's a bite i just watch a bite of it before this morning when you be still in bed and um he be like david walliams be say things like that's the most excite thing i've ever hear in my life and load of and i'm like be he take the mickey
S0115	ah but it's it's from the comedian's irony isn't it comedian comedians you know if you're a popular comedian you can just talk as much crap as you want and people will just say oh he's be ironic or whatever
S0037	yeah but i suppose
S0115	uh it's a bite like ricky gervais do ricky gervais do bad joke
S0037	it be a bite annoy yeah
S0115	it's like this be a bad joke i'm ricky gervais and i can tell bad joke
S0037	oh he's terrible ricky gervais i really don't like him
S0115	no i don't like him
S0037	oh i really don't like him
S0115	like um um
S0037	it's like he's make not funny like load of money out of not be funny
S0115	there there be an element of like maybe overratedness maybe go on there but uh he's popular so
S0037	he's stupid
S0115	yeah you can you can make you know you you can achieve a lot by uh by kind of not be that talented i think or
S0037	nah i really don't think he be i mean i can see like why people like the um the office and stuff i can understand why they like it
S0115	yeah but there's there's also extras isn't there
S0037	and extras yeah that be quite funny but i think i saw that what's it call what be that about be it about science like he do a stand up thing
S0115	oh yeah he's terrible as a stand up isn't he that's his worst thing that's his worst skill
S0037	it be just like it be just so painful to watch
S0115	he's very popular though but just can't stand
S0037	oh excuse me i didn't find anything funny about it at all like
S0115	yeah science be pretty bad actually but his stand up be really bad and
S0037	but why do people go and see it like
S0115	i don't know he's he's on twitter isn't he uh
S0037	be he i haven't i dunno if i've get him
S0115	but i don't think you'd find it very funny yeah
S0037	well i don't
S0115	i think there's like load of like random like world leaders and stuff like like mahmood ahmedinejad be on twitter or something
S0037	be he be it him though or be it a spoof one cos the spoof ones be my favourite
S0115	well i probably think he he have he have like a like a main official one maybe
S0037	there's like a well i know i've get like president obama on twitter but it's obviously not him it's like
S0115	be there be there like steven hawk
S0037	uh i don't know
S0115	oh yeah like the official one i i imagine that he he have one you know run by you know run by his his government run uh like an official government tweet
S0037	i've get like um arnold schwarzenegger just cos i think it be funny
S0115	like kim jong kim il kim il sing
S0037	but then my favourite thing be like the ones where you get like um a spoof one so like you know when harry redknapp be involve in all of that scandal and then there be all the like um what be i gonna say all of that uh or whether he's gonna get the england job and stuff and he obviously he speak with a like a really strong sort of east end accent doesn't he
S0115	oh yeah
S0037	and like there be load of like load of like you have a laugh
S0115	oh yeah it's good yeah yeah yeah
S0037	like load of like really excuse me load of really funny tweet like from someone who's pretend to be harry redknapp
S0115	yeah and there's a lot of like anything in football you're gonna get lot of spoof
S0037	yeah
S0115	um so it might be like um and on facebook it might be actually hard to tell whether it's a real celebrity or if it's a spoof i mean
S0037	yeah that's true
S0115	i think it would be fair that everybody should have the right to their own uh name you know to their own
S0037	well you can get it validate i think
S0115	but of course some people have
S0037	on twitter like you can get it like um you can write like accredit like stephen fry's one be like get like a little badge the ones that be like they've get like a little badge in the corner to show that it really be them
S0115	oh yeah i see
S0037	so you can get it like especially if you
S0115	the best thing i saw about twitter be you um
S0037	so there's the that's one i've get like from cheryl cole it's call cheryl kerl k e r l
S0115	chery kerl so it's do by someone from the northeast who know like who know the uh newcastle accent
S0037	there you can read it
S0115	uh april fool's day oh right yeah april fool's day but nobody get us uh cos i just sit inside the joke proof tent that simon send us till twelve o'clock simples pet okay uh
S0037	it's stupid
S0115	um
S0037	that's crazy i watch this last week
S0115	what's this what be it
S0037	um it's about sandhurst so it's about like
S0115	oh oh yeah yeah we'll probably put some uh put some music on
S0037	no i'll find something else but it be quite interest but i don't understand why people would wanna go in the army and just be like shout at in the face
S0115	hopefully kick it over
S0115	oh yeah there be a girl there wasn't there and
S0037	yeah and there she be like you're not up to standard and she be like ugh like try not to cry pop power list celebrity splurge
S0115	fair enough
S0115	yeah what d'you think about celebrities d'you think it's moral or like a bite dodgy to have like pry cameras in celebrities' live and everybody get really interest about things that have go wrong with celebrities you know or d'you think that's a bite like unethical maybe
S0037	i think like it i well i don't think anyone should be like spy on people
S0115	yeah obviously like within the law and uh
S0037	i don't think like if you're inside your own house
S0115	it's a bite of a gray area for the law isn't it because um because like if if you uh you know if you're if you're if you're sit outside someone's house every single day but i mean it be very gray with area with that sort of thing and also private detectives like
S0037	yeah
S0115	how much monitor be they allow to legally do like can they stand opposite your house in on the road where it's a public road they could just stand there and basically just stand there and basically just spy on you in your windows and every time you ever come out in your garden that they'll they'll be there to take a photo of you
S0037	it must be horrible i know or like you know when you go on holiday they just they just go on holiday with you
S0115	personally i think like um they should ban uh paparazzi from certain distance
S0037	yeah but but then also like people do things on purpose don't they people encourage you know
S0115	yeah and that's bad as well like but if you wanna have an interview and a press conference in your in your bedroom when you've get up in the morning then that's up to you but i mean
S0037	yeah i know but
S0115	i mean if that's if they if they want to use it like
S0037	be the problem not though people
S0115	i would ban i would definitely ban paparazzis from go within a certain distance of people's house
S0037	be the be the problem not though like well you can get long lenses though that doesn't matter do it
S0115	well i'd ban any like any take of photos of um
S0037	be it not the people who buy the picture and therefore the people who read the magazines and that that's the problem really
S0115	oh yeah you know you can ban i mean i would basically ban any paparazzi photograph in the house that weren't authorise basically
S0037	yeah
S0115	i think i would probably do that if i rule the world be that still go cos it would be rather a bite irritate if it uh
S0037	yeah yeah no no no it's fine
S0115	yeah but um
S0037	no cos usually it's like like me and i just press the wrong button
S0115	no no no no uh like it sometimes just it just die doesn't it
S0037	well i just put new things in so
S0115	what it should do be it should make like a bleep like when it's die
S0037	yeah yeah like bee bee dee dee like if it be close down
S0115	um a charge my alarm but uh it um doesn't do it
S0037	oh there's i have get ricky gervais on twitter look he's tweet a picture of his cat
S0115	genius comedy genius he he do look a bite like your uh your friend doesn't he actually particularly in that photo
S0037	oh i suppose he do a bite round the eye
S0115	he be actually quite a good look guy in his in his younger days though
S0037	i don't think would be very flatter with that uh comparison so perhaps don't point that
S0115	i dunno no ricky gervais have a be quite good look in the old days wasn't he
S0037	well
S0115	when when he have that bowie
S0037	the david bowie thing
S0115	he's always have a david bowie obsession hasn't he uh i think he may be go a bite thin on top
S0037	think so
S0115	i'm not sure that's a that's a nice look cat look a bite like a persian one cos it's like white and black
S0037	i wonder what your your mam's new dog's like be she gonna send you a picture
S0115	be that sort of siamese be it what's the type of cat that's get like white with like a
S0037	i dunno a black face i dunno i'm not very i don't really like cat so
S0115	so we're definitely not get a cat then
S0037	well i'm allergic to cat
S0115	unless you stop be allergic we could get one at first and if you get allergic then we'll take it back
S0037	that's not very nice on the cat though it like get reject
S0115	no just we'll just um yeah but but there'd be there'd be lot of good owners wouldn't there
S0037	well
S0115	so but you don't wanna get a dog you wanna get a jack russell don't you
S0037	um i haven't necessarily fully decide but i think dog be better than cat because dog do things like cat just like do
S0115	cat do stuff as well
S0037	cat just turn their nose up at you and just like scratch things and
S0115	no no no they don't always turn their nose up at you they they can be friendly you know like they be talk on that programme yesterday or whatever it be uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh they come in you know they come on your bed and like they share like they you can share stuff share food with them and they sleep on your bed and
S0037	that's not nice that's not a nice idea if i've make some food i wanna eat it
S0115	well it's like a fluffy like mobile cushion isn't it
S0037	well i like cushion
S0115	you don't have to really do much to take care of it apart from fee it
S0037	yeah but why have a pet if you don't have to do anything to it like you may as well just get sort of like a plant
S0115	it's it's a mobile cushion
S0037	yeah but
S0115	that heat self heat cushion
S0037	if you could eat it at the end that might be better
S0115	if you could eat it well you can eat it but um
S0115	most people view it as a friend and like they wouldn't like eat a friend if a friend die
S0037	no i wonder
S0115	if i die would you eat me
S0037	well it depend how hungry i be
S0115	be that legal i don't think it be
S0037	eat another person
S0115	yeah be that legal
S0037	mm no i don't think so i have a horrible dream
S0115	cos um if i donate my organs to um so i could donate my could donate my muscle to uh
S0037	to my dinner
S0115	to to your to your dinner
S0037	i wouldn't eat you that's horrible
S0115	might be tasty
S0037	well
S0115	mind you i'd be a bite old bite old and uh
S0037	let's hope so
S0115	old and uh you know
S0037	grizzly
S0115	nasty um no but perhaps uh it hopefully soon you know in term of science they will actually they will actually invent um
S0037	yeah i'll just keep your head in a jar
S0115	like they will they will be able to grow um artificial they'll be able to grow uh meat you know the muscle by themselves uh so you don't have to kill uh like a whole animal you can simply grow these muscle so they don't have any
S0037	cow yeah but they've do it haven't they they've do it with cow it be just really expensive
S0115	they don't have any pain i i think i think they i think they have do certain things like i would expect there to be some progress hopefully within the next hundred years or so yeah
S0037	well i think definitely by then
S0115	um in the direction of like perhaps of remove the need to um to to kill animals for uh for food like by grow the muscle tissue
S0037	stupid interview put it on uh
S0115	what show be that one on kerrang
S0037	ah adele it's annoy
S0115	lot of adele isn't there
S0037	be that some sort of jibe
S0115	no no i didn't oi no no i didn't mean like there there's a lot of adele like in a certain in term of mass and um spatial like volume as well
S0037	that's not very nice
S0115	uh several metres square of adele
S0037	although i sort of don't really like her when she be go on about like whinging about have to pay tax it's like oh poor you you and your ten million pound probably ten billion pound
S0115	metres cub i don't know what do they get like fifty or forty five or forty percent tax or something um
S0037	well they've just change it haven't they recently but yeah but it be fifty
S0115	they've slightly they've they've do something to lower it slightly for wealthy people
S0037	but it be fifty percent tax
S0115	um
S0037	but if you're gonna make like ten million pound then it's five million pound be much the same ten million pound i imagine
S0115	ah well i don't know i mean i think it it do go i mean it's not it's not great to to have to take that much of someone's money but uh
S0037	yeah but i think i think it doesn't matter
S0115	you you probably would be benefit from you know from the tax in certain ways but uh
S0037	yeah but i mean
S0115	yeah i mean ideally the the there there should be more i think that the the government should make more of a profit by itself without have to tax people although that sound nice on paper but i don't know the extent that uh we would be take about state capitalism um so i don't know what they it's like
S0037	i don't have a problem with tax people who've get millions of pound half of it
S0115	uh well yeah it's it's controversial isn't it because obviously they're gonna they're gonna say well i uh i've get if i earn um a million pound a year and you're take half of that that then
S0037	yeah but that's more than enough to live on
S0115	they they would feel they're not they're not get as much back as like as other people be i suppose i mean it be controversial but i guess they of course they're free to leave though they're free to leave the country and if they don't if they don't approve of it then they uh
S0037	do it not work do it not work that like you get tax normally up to a certain rate and then whatever you earn over that you get half of
S0115	um i'm not i don't know much that much about it
S0037	it be man like so i remember like if if you're earn under something you don't get tax if you're earn like the majority of the population earn between i think
S0115	well they have different rat d'you mean different rat for different income
S0037	yeah so
S0115	yeah the progressive taxation increase the percentage increase as you get more yeah
S0037	yeah so like most people be tax whatever it be twenty five percent or twenty percent or i can't even remember
S0115	yeah i mean the problem be it's like it's like a big system isn't it the the government and you know the people be sort of a bite confuse sometimes as to where the money's go and how efficiently it's be use
S0037	thirty percent yeah but a but for most people like a hundred thousand pound a year be more than enough to live on
S0115	i've hear comment come from your direction that you you believe that you pay uh rather a large amount of tax
S0037	i do i hate it
S0115	and you you only pay like uh you know the the sort of the more the lower rate isn't about twenty five for you i guess
S0037	i know it's annoy yeah it be and i hate it i hate see like i've get like eight hundred pound out of me
S0115	um so if if you can see their point of view you're like obviously you're only pay twenty five but adele you know poor old sean connery be be pay like you know fifty percent on his on his uh income and stuff but uh
S0037	yeah i can i can but yeah but that's probably like but it's probably enough to live on isn't it
S0115	i think some people just don't seem to mind and others really hate it they think tax be theft so
S0037	but
S0115	that's what you hear from the you know sort of you know sort of centre right or libertarian type of people
S0037	yeah but you know i be a student for a long time and i've get grandparents who get pension and stuff so i suppose we've just get to live with it everyone
S0115	all the the sort of the the main strategy of government be to sort of keep things more or less the same unless unless you have to change something um you generally keep don't mess with something you know if it ain't break don't fix it sort of thing but
S0037	yeah
S0115	they wouldn't make too many change but they do they have make some change they have lower slightly the like some they have lower tax for wealthy people uh that's that's that's sort of the the the uh the the the doctrine that uh you know that um
S0037	that's just tories isn't it it's just their it's just their like
S0115	yeah the like the sort of uh of the of the of the economic liberal people who who would obviously they believe that if you lower tax then you encourage uh global business and that view be espouse by you know like the economist magazine
S0037	it's unsurprising that they should do that
S0115	so the latest magazine uh the economist's front cover that i saw be um
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh cameron's budget for global uh for what be it cameron's budget for you know global business or something like that
S0037	yeah yeah yeah
S0115	and there be a picture of like basically compliment and
S0037	his big yeah
S0115	actually it be actually osborne and you know compliment osborne and cameron and sort of mock the vince cable um but uh they the the suggestion on the cover be that uh osborne and cameron be welcome foreign investment basically into the country use the incentive of lower tax but but obviously it's not it's not just about tax be it i mean that's it's it's in fact yeah
S0037	yeah well of course i mean i i'm not no but i'm not suggest that i've get a like a massive global standpoint on it all i'm say be like in my opinion we should tax them because
S0115	the best thing the best thing with this be
S0037	i be try to say ten million pound be as much as say five million pound like
S0115	well that's clearly not the same be it
S0037	no but if you're just a person like the salary that i get
S0115	well that be a hundred million pound the same as fifty million um well do it be it be you do like a like a linear relationship
S0037	well yes in term of what you need no but like it's just extra stuff isn't it after that really you need a house to live in you need some food you know like it's just it do they don't need ten million pound for that you need like i dunno
S0115	oh yeah no i mean i kind of see i kind of know what i kind of see that point of view uh but obviously if you're an investor that you know they these guy like the there's a lot of there be a lot of injustices in the world that's for sure but i mean i mean there's a lot of
S0037	yeah
S0115	the problem with there's a lot of problems with money i mean cos like if you you know you can get money from from not do anything so i mean that be the whole like if you're talk like the sort of marxist idea which be to sort of you you want to connect uh money with with labour
S0037	mhm
S0115	uh so therefore i suppose that uh that that that a marxist view would criticise uh have you know the the ability to sort of invest money and then to receive money back
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh for an individual without actually do any labour
S0037	yeah
S0115	um but the reality be that the individuals and investors do tend to they will choose lower tax over high tax a lot of them but it's more complicate though because
S0037	well i mean
S0115	it's a bite like uh you know if you wanna britain and america that the so call anglo saxon system be to be more liberal and like lower the tax and like um allow the the free business whereas european model who be like germany and france would do uh more supposedly more like statey
S0037	yeah
S0115	and more like regulatory and i think a another example be the bank um regulations cos there be a big fight over this there be a big bust up within the eu in between you know it be when cameron veto it and um
S0037	yeah
S0115	and then for example you know mr wetherspoon put like pro cameron like in stuff in in wetherspoon's so mr wetherspoon be an example of these type of people who want like he's not call mr wetherspoon he's call he's call tim he's call tim martin and uh and he be an example of the sort of person who want the anglo saxon model and they want lower tax you know lower they want less red tape they want less state interference
S0037	i know he's not i like i like his name
S0115	i mean he's it's not a coincidence that he's that his pubs be base on george orwell's idea of a good pub and you know he he will have read george orwell presumably because he dislike state interference
S0037	but one of the best things yeah one of the best policies that i read though be about like in norway i think it's norway one of the scandinavian countries where like it's they set it so that it's not possible for people at the top to earn
S0115	yeah this be the redistributive redistributative um redistributional uh model
S0037	okay well it's not
S0115	in the in the scandinavian countries yeah
S0037	yeah so it's like they set it so that wag at the top can't be i can't remember how many time like
S0115	yeah
S0037	eight time or five time or something more than the minimum wage like
S0115	yeah i mean that's kind of yeah that that's sort of point that i be that i be gonna mention before
S0037	that mean every uh that drag everyone up like that seem like a better idea
S0115	well yeah i mean like those kind of countries be what might be call socialist by american um like americans
S0037	that seem a bite more marxist
S0115	but yeah that be the point i be gonna make it's like i be talk about the european bust up and like uk be like germany be gonna be try to force and like eu be try to force england to to to you know reel in ring
S0037	to what
S0115	reel reel in its bankers a bite like to to restrict its its bank
S0037	ah reign in
S0115	yeah i be try to come out with some word there uh yeah the eu want to impose like certain restrictions on bank and you know on trade but britain be get all like classical liberal you know adam smith about it and say you know you can't interfere with the banker cos you'll scare them off and they'll all go to america and you know london blah blah blah be the world's one of the three so call financial hubs or whatever they're call financial centre of the world along with tokyo and new york like if you if you start to you know put red tape in now like you're gonna drive all them they're gonna go out of london and you know leave the gherkin and leave the canary wharf
S0037	yeah yeah yeah capital yeah yeah yeah yeah i know what you mean yeah ah empty gherkin
S0115	you know that's what we but they're gonna leave the gherkin leave the leave the canary wharf leave the citigroup
S0037	yeah
S0115	whatever they're all gonna they're all gonna go uh to gonna go to america and shanghai and they're gonna make us look like a right bunch of losers uh compare to germany but the yeah the point i be gonna make be that germany have a quite a big bank and company and capitalism industries itself
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	even though it have more tight regulations so like it's not uh always as simple as like just say
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	if like there have to be a kind of national pride amongst businesses within countries like in like if you want good investment a lot of it's gotta be there's a an element of nationalism about a lot you you've get uh like german bankers that be stay in germany rather than go to london perhaps
S0037	yeah but i think that's more loose here like do you see that do you see that mary portas programme
S0115	there's it's company cos they they're proud of their country you know what i mean i don't know who that be
S0037	you do man she's she's a lesbian she's get ginger hair
S0115	ginger lesbian
S0115	well i know one ginger lesbian i know the the woman from uh sex and the city

S0115	she's uh uh a ginger haired lesbian to to put it rather bluntly
S0037	no not her she's um she's get like a very distinctive haircut very gingery she's quite tall sort of slim she go round and like tell people who've get shop what they're do wrong
