S0265	that be that erm well you know where portree be on skye it's that that place where we
S0264	oh yes it be
S0265	we stay at
S0264	it's because we didn't go to the water much because it be rain all the time

S0265	mm
S0264	yeah we do walk we walk down to that one that's paint white cos i think it's be repaint pink now
S0265	well there be a all i remember at portree down by the harbour be that row of terrace house
S0264	yeah
S0265	all paint in bright colour
S0264	yeah well that they weren't all you're you're get confuse with tobermory that's what this row here be er these card be probably decades old
S0265	could be
S0264	like that like those ones that we get from like say ninety three
S0265	mm
S0264	i wouldn't have send those if i'd realise and look at that little place there what that nobody could live there
S0265	mm
S0264	maybe it's a boathouse
S0265	i don't know i can't quite place it
S0264	yeah cos we didn't walk that oh i know that white place be actually a hotel and i think maybe the pink place be to the leave of the picture where it be sort of pinky it's all depress i don't i don't know what people saw in apart from those mountains that look they look quite nice from that island what be it call
S0265	yes erm well we go past on the boat they look very dramatic didn't they
S0264	yeah it look they look better from er from those other islands be it mm
S0265	erm er i can't remember be this erm and wasn't it
S0264	yeah but we didn't go there we go to the other one
S0265	no we go we sail past them
S0264	yes and we go
S0265	and then be on the
S0264	but as we be
S0265	the right hand side
S0264	yes exactly and and so you could see the mountains but then
S0265	mm
S0264	when you actually get to you couldn't see anything
S0265	no not where we go you know it's a bite of a funny shape island wasn't it it be like
S0264	there be a play on the radio actually set on erm raasay i think it's call
S0265	mm
S0264	that that long thin island
S0265	raasay yes yes
S0264	about somebody who'd build a road by himself
S0265	yes
S0264	on what do you know about that
S0265	yes erm i think you mention them about this build this road all the way around the island or something
S0264	i don't know about all the way around it be probably to the to the ferry port
S0265	where from
S0264	i don't know from where they live i suppose
S0265	i don't think there's much on it anyway
S0264	no it's probably like that one we go on last of all opposite oban
S0265	mm
S0264	that be a bite of a waste of time
S0265	oh yes yes
S0264	i wonder if they will i don't suppose they'll take the initiative and vote for independence
S0265	who would
S0264	scots
S0265	well
S0264	i look at the map and it be much smaller than norway but maybe the population be roughly the same size
S0265	mm i think it be about the same isn't it it's about
S0264	which
S0265	be it four million or something
S0264	well probably
S0265	very small
S0264	i don't see what that's get to do with it i don't i i don't think they'll do anything that's interest i suppose anyway
S0265	i can't see them vote yes
S0264	why not
S0265	well i can't really see any any strong argument
S0264	well i can't see any strong argument for not vote yes quite honestly apart from negative ones i be surprise by that bloke on the boat do you remember do you talk to him
S0265	no you speak to him though
S0264	i think his er reason be very childlike childish too actually
S0265	mm
S0264	do you erm do you feel vindicate or do you feel embarrass that we didn't get in the car
S0265	oh erm er that chap from st andrews
S0264	yes
S0265	no because i i wasn't erm party to that conversation be i
S0264	yeah but be you happy that be you still happy when we saw him again in portree that we hadn't accept the lift or do you feel guilt
S0265	no i didn't feel any guilt no i well i mean why should why should i feel guilty i mean yes he he he offer to give us a lift erm but we have every right to say yes or no
S0264	i keep on
S0265	and and and we be quite happy just take the bus so
S0264	i keep remember a bloke in munich offer me a lift to vienna when i be mm on a trip from my from actually
S0265	mm
S0264	and i think that's look back i think that's highly suspicious
S0265	yeah i think when you're by yourself you've get to be more wary
S0264	exactly but he seem all very very pleasant at the time i happen to say i be go vienna next erm and erm and then and then he say er he be go there on sunday and he'd give me a lift
S0265	mm
S0264	it be quite tempt cos i think i don't know how i know but i think he seem to have quite a nice car anyway the i think the main reason why i didn't be because i have an aeroplane ticket and i i fancy go by plane
S0265	mm
S0264	yeah it be quite horrible think back think like what would have what might have happen if i have accept
S0265	mm and and the other thing be when when you're travel in in someone's car you feel oblige to make conversation all the time which can be quite tire and probably impossible for me with my hear cos i can't hear very well in cars as you know
S0264	well he he just didn't seem a terribly social person to me so i couldn't imagine how he would enjoy it
S0265	no mm good point
S0264	i mean it's a funny thing to do as well to go for your holiday on
S0265	yes he be he be just kind of
S0264	drift
S0265	drift yeah take it as it come like it be very strange
S0264	but what do you think about that other bloke that artist that furniture person be that drift
S0265	mm i can't remember his
S0264	the
S0265	background but why
S0264	the yes
S0265	he he be do something that he'd do several time before
S0264	plus he'd hire a cottage or he'd be lend a cottage or something near mallaig
S0265	oh i can't remember that
S0264	outside mallaig he have a car he have a car as well i think and there be other people that be gonna join him so it a bite of a different kettle of fish i think it be family or people be come up do i tell you that i i write and erm review his website and he write and thank me
S0265	no you didn't
S0264	ah a cursory acknowledgement and erm that be a but you i don't i'm not surprise because probably people don't like to be give feedback on their websites
S0265	mm
S0264	cos you it's odds on it's quite likely you'd say the wrong thing
S0265	so do you do you so you you email him
S0264	yeah i tell him
S0265	mm
S0264	he need some i think i probably say what what i say on the boat i think i i say you he need some text i mean all that i could see unless he'd send me not the correct link be picture i think he call it a blog i or i wouldn't i didn't see how it be a blog
S0265	mm
S0264	i probably say all the same things that i say on the boat that he need to offer some tip and tell people something like how he choose his raw materials or how he approach a project just to give people an insight into what
S0265	mm
S0264	he do
S0265	yes and how long ago be be it when you send him that email
S0264	oh i don't know probably when we get back
S0265	oh
S0264	the nineteenth of june
S0265	well maybe he's change it
S0264	i couldn't well i haven't get time to don't even know where the car or anything where not interest
S0265	mm
S0264	you can go you can check if you want
S0265	well if if you can give give me the website and i can have a look
S0264	be you really interest
S0265	no well sort of
S0264	you wouldn't know it if
S0265	but but i wouldn't know what's erm what it look like before
S0264	no oh well yeah but you would know if there be any text there
S0265	yes
S0264	anyway i i'd be very surprise cos i i don't think he's the kind of person that take advice from people
S0265	mm
S0264	i think i think would and that prom that i hear on the radio the other night i think he must but yeah i think maybe he go for richard strauss cos i turn it on when i be eat it must have be the weekend and i cos i catch the end of er like elgar's second symphony but it be conduct by some russian and i do think it be a very strange interpretation i think
S0265	oh i don't know the second symphony i don't know much elgar at all
S0264	you you would well you'd i think the dream of gerontius be your favourite piece
S0265	yeah yeah that's about the only
S0265	elgar i know well apart from the really popular
S0264	well i think you'd recognise
S0265	pomp and circumstance
S0264	well i think you'd he say that he hear that er play in a church in sicily when he and be there on holiday
S0265	what dream of gerontius
S0264	er
S0265	which one
S0264	pomp and circumstance
S0265	oh
S0264	he think it be for a wed he think it be very inappropriate
S0265	mm
S0264	do you think he mean the land of hope and glory bite do you be that what he mean do you think
S0265	i don't know there be several of them aren't there
S0264	well i don't know
S0265	so it depend
S0264	i think that colour your thing cos he dismiss the second symphony and i say it's actually quite poignant because it's a sort of farewell to empire cos it's all very well say er it it might pay lip service to those time that but i think the the very spooky end i think be an an acknowledgement that it's all over
S0265	mm
S0264	you well you'd you you would recognise it i'm sure you'd know what
S0265	mm i think
S0264	it's a hardly it's hardly a triumphant end quite the opposite
S0265	mm yeah i'll have to listen to it at some time it's probably on youtube
S0264	everything be on youtube i don't see how they can be on youtube actually must be illegal on phone in people's pocket
S0265	yes well all that copyright business seem to have just go by the wayside
S0264	well i'm sure that i'm sure if people want to they could they could get in touch with youtube and get these things take off couldn't they
S0265	mm i don't know
S0264	i'm i'm sure you i'm sure you can
S0265	mm i don't know it it's how how it how it work whether it's just when one person that have to request it to be remove or
S0264	no well it it would be whoever be the copyright holder if it's a piece of art in the case of a concert i don't know maybe it's the concert organiser the promoter
S0265	mm
S0264	but that that could include the copyright holder i mean suppose elgar's get family do they er be elgar out of copyright it's seventy years i suppose he would be do that mean that people can just print the music copyright doesn't last it's finite you know
S0265	mm well the copyright be
S0264	i think it's different in
S0265	acquire by the publisher isn't it
S0264	what you mean normally
S0265	and and it's probably fifty years or something like that be it
S0264	be you sure it's acquire by the publisher because i think it be the author look here's a book
S0265	i always think it be the
S0264	copyright stephen pinker so it's
S0265	oh
S0264	so it's the author and it say nineteen ninety four anyway i think it's probably life plus some years
S0265	mm
S0264	but then i'm sure things pass to your heirs
S0265	mm i don't know no idea
S0264	and also it's different in the usa i think actually it's shorter there
S0265	oh be it
S0264	i think so i've get the word i've get the figure seventy seventy years in my mind for the uk but i don't know if that's music or everything must read all this stuff
S0265	mm
S0264	and it would be a good thing as well like if tidy up all these all these book off the table
S0265	yes
S0264	do you see about those seagulls in rome by the way attack er when the pope
S0265	no
S0264	you must have read it it's on the bbc there's a thing on the bbc page
S0265	oh that'll be on youtube
S0264	well it might be but they they release two doves and a seagull attack one of the doves and what i didn't realise be they eat them
S0265	oh gosh
S0264	so they're beyond the pale as far as i'm concern now they hit the the seagull get the dive but by er tail feather and so the dive escape minus a few feather but then the second dive be kill by a crow
S0265	oh gosh
S0264	imagine the symbolism of that i mean how and it's very embarrass as well imagine you're the pope and you're and you're there presumably on the balcony or whatever it be and this thing happen in front of what be you suppose to do
S0265	mm you'd think they'd have people to take care of that sort of thing and make sure there be no bird around
S0264	how can they
S0265	well
S0264	but yeah apparently that's
S0265	scare them off or something
S0264	that's a point of this report by a journalist bbc journalist whatever or a correspondent that it rome have be overrun with these wretched what be they call mackerel gull herring gull
S0265	herring gull yes yes
S0264	which be which be what these be
S0265	these be yes
S0264	they're horrid vicious things and you can tell about the way they're scream and they're they've get slightly better but they're still ridiculous
S0265	mm
S0264	and anyway so i've get no just feed up with them now that i know that they kill other bird like that i mean some other bird i know they don't they they just ignore them cos i've see them i've see jackdaws or crow and they just ignore the seagulls i mean
S0265	well i've i've hear that seagulls don't like crow and they will stay away so if the if the the crow be nest they will keep their distance
S0264	not much though cos the on campus there's a there's a rookery and
S0265	really
S0264	they've both fly there
S0265	mm yes well they i'd i i think what's happen be that that cos there use to be a rookery up i the for years
S0264	have it go
S0265	yes
S0264	why
S0265	i don't know they probably just move on and i think it's since they've go that we've get the seagulls
S0264	but it isn't yeah but the it isn't just in the close that they're nest they're nest
S0265	yeah they're probably nest in the vicinity or they be
S0264	well it's a very large vicinity because on parallel streets they they be around and i doubt whether our little tiny rookery be influence a couple of roads away or a couple of streets away er have you have you think about the implications if they try to nest on the roof
S0265	mm
S0264	you have those flat bits
S0265	yes yes well i mean lot of people they end up put barb wire or mesh up don't they to to keep them off their chimney stack and stuff like that they like to nest between chimney stack
S0264	i don't cos er cos when i run past that house by the path into the park at the sort of bottom of avenue i think why have that household holder allow cos they they must be able to nest up there cos they're always guard they're always perch up on those roof have you see have you see them
S0265	yeah which house be it
S0264	oh it one it it's it's near the path into the park
S0265	right
S0264	er it
S0265	it right next to the path
S0264	it's before the turn in the road go
S0265	oh right
S0264	haven't you notice them
S0265	no no
S0264	anyway i don't know how that householder house owner tolerate them there
S0265	mm yeah i don't know
S0264	but it isn't just me cos i've have i've have a conversation with one person that obviously live in the next street or live around there about them oh that be about another lot that be that be there nest in a different street but i've see people who look up anyway about the ones that we're talk about so i think it's a lot of and er rubbish be one thing but cos they're peck into plastic bag aren't they
S0265	mm oh they will do yes they create a lot of litter as well
S0264	well that's certainly
S0265	a lot
S0264	i've that's what's happen on the campus i'm sure that they be there's load of junk junk food and i think they can make a concert effort to get rid of them maybe put some poison down or something
S0265	i think they have to do it more humanely that that well it the best thing be to er break their egg isn't it
S0264	well that's i suppose what happen that year that that ridiculous seagull build the nest on the flight of step
S0265	mm
S0264	and they be the flight of step be cordoned off but eventually the nest i they disappear and i imagine it be a fox or some other rodent because it be just on the grind so
S0265	mm
S0264	what other what other apart from fox well it could be any wildlife in that area be it stoats and weasels
S0265	mm i dunno
S0264	they all maybe they all go for egg
S0265	yeah
S0264	but it's er something's get to be do because as one of my colleagues say you be encourage to shoot rabbit it's your duty well we all know that but the seagulls be protect
S0265	mm
S0264	well that doesn't seem to make sense i'm not say it's the seagulls' fault it's obviously cos human be have be
S0265	well it's it's the human
S0264	mess
S0265	i think it's a human
S0264	yeah because
S0265	that we cause it
S0264	yeah probably by take too much fish out of too many fish out of the sea so they've get nothing to live on where they should be live on them and so they've move
S0265	yeah and and we we leave too much too much food out rubbish and they scavenge
S0264	but that doesn't give them an excuse to start peck and kill other bird
S0265	well that's just their nature that's that's they've probably always be like that but they be very vicious
S0264	reptilian yeah i wouldn't be surprise if they're around after human be have go
S0265	mm and maybe they could be quite adaptable as a species
S0264	maybe their stupidity be less stupid that human beings' stupidity in a way
S0265	mm
