S0441	okay it's pretty nice weather er all the way through apart from monday
S0439	okay
S0441	so it's okay to mow the lawn i feel a bite bad that we have that that thing look so ridiculous
S0439	oh yeah we should cut that yeah
S0441	how be we gonna cut it though
S0439	scissor
S0441	scissor
S0441	it'll take fifty thousand years
S0439	it's better than nothing what do you want me to do oh i could ask dad to bring some secateurs over

S0439	and possibly some varnish and and a sander no i'm kid
S0441	yeah i'm not weed fuck that they can weed themselves if they want to weed that badly
S0439	yeah also at least it mean like if er if the house er er if more tenant move in obviously we'll have to take our bed down which be fine but they'll have to they'll have to like renegotiate with and see whether they can have the bed in his garage
S0441	shall we take it out of his garage
S0439	erm
S0441	i think we probably should because there'll be an inventory won't there
S0439	i think we should
S0441	there'll be i'll bet there'll be an inventory check er oh
S0439	there will be an inventory check
S0441	there seem to be all these things that be mean to happen but
S0439	i would feel more comfortable leave it back in the house and then
S0441	oh yeah
S0439	them figure out themselves yeah
S0441	yeah we could explain to them that's what happen in the past but just put it back i think
S0439	yeah yeah definitely erm well the guy who come round last time do the inventory check like when i have that
S0441	the i i think he must've be the same guy
S0439	they say he be like a tall older man
S0441	mm
S0439	like quite not old
S0441	glass
S0439	but yeah that be him
S0441	with a camera round his neck
S0439	i don't think he have a camera this time
S0439	oh he might've do
S0441	he have a camera i guess to take photos of
S0439	but he see he be fine like he be like it's all good condition it's fine
S0441	i guess they're just look at stuff that's like proper break aren't they
S0439	yeah we probably should tape up the fridge with some clear tape instead of some colour tape
S0441	yeah yes we should cos he's gonna look in the fridge
S0439	but also if they try and charge us for anything i'd just be like i'm sorry but you be
S0441	utterly ridiculous
S0439	you be appal yeah like you be actually the shittest estate agent and we have to clean if they try and charge us for a house clean
S0441	no we're not do that
S0439	i'll be like i'm sorry no when i move in it be it be disgust
S0441	it be in such a bad state
S0439	and we have to spend time and money and clean products we have to spend our own money on clean products to clean it
S0441	mm
S0439	to a satisfactory er state so
S0441	cos it be not satisfactory
S0439	so i'm sorry er you're not i'm not you're not charge us for a fuck clean look i'll clean it myself
S0441	yeah we'll clean it
S0439	but i'm not er gonna pay someone else to come in and do a shittier job than i could do
S0441	and i'm not go all out either
S0439	no
S0441	we can clean it to a acceptable standard but
S0439	yeah i'm not gonna like scrub all the skirt board and stuff no way
S0441	it be so shit when we come
S0439	it be disgust yeah
S0441	it be so horrible
S0439	like i'll wipe all the drawers down wipe the oven down and stuff
S0441	yeah like common courtesy stuff
S0439	yeah vacuum but i'm not go to go above i'm not gonna clean the top of those shelve bet they're disgust
S0441	er
S0439	and the light
S0441	those light be rancid
S0439	they're disgust we probably should maybe try and clean the light
S0441	they're so dusty those light they're horrible
S0439	but i wonder if they like they get a if i wonder if they message the estate agent tonight and be like we want it
S0441	they could do
S0439	yeah maybe just yeah whenever you send an email to be like a few people look round
S0441	know their name be
S0439	oh yeah true yeah shit
S0441	if they rob us then
S0439	yeah
S0439	they be like whoever whoever ring up oh no they didn't book in do they book in still or do they not at all no okay
S0441	i don't know cos er surely they they must've do just in case we didn't let them in
S0439	yeah
S0441	that would be stupid wouldn't it
S0439	so just be like whoever book in at eleven fifteen at the weekend come to see the house tonight
S0441	come come already
S0439	erm and then tell they yeah just be like we also if they want to move in in december we'll move out by december
S0441	okay i like pack that's weird isn't it
S0439	i go round to 's yesterday cos hat pack cos she's go back to she be like i walk in and she be like i be like what's wrong she go i don't know what to pack and i be like well have you er categorise your clothe you know into like just t shirt trousers something like that she go no
S0439	so we be like what we'll do be like literally she be like a pile of t shirt pile of trousers pile of dress and then just put them in the suitcase and i be like see how easy be that and she be like yeah
S0439	yeah so i be like how do you get yourself in such a state over pack she be like i don't know
S0441	oh dear
S0439	i be like you be not a qualify packer
S0441	nah i love it
S0439	i do quite enjoy pack
S0441	quite satisfy
S0439	like not like holiday pack i'm really lazy with holiday pack
S0441	yeah
S0439	i just like vaguely plan it and then throw everything in and hope for the best because with holiday pack you know that wherever you go apart from maybe like a bloody jungle or somewhere you can buy whatever you need
S0441	you can
S0439	like a towel body wash you name it you can probably buy it
S0441	see i don't like that idea though i prefer to have it
S0439	oh i wouldn't i just i don't care
S0441	see
S0439	like if i've forget it i i've forget it there's nothing i can do about it
S0441	that really really really annoy me
S0439	there's nothing you can do about it if you've forget it
S0441	and then it's annoy
S0441	it's only my fault that i er haven't get it so
S0439	i think it i think i'm in that mindset because of hand luggage because i only take hand luggage bag with me i kind of have
S0439	yeah i have to limit what i take so like especially if we go to like a hotel i'm like well they're gonna have towel i don't need to take a bloody towel
S0441	see i really don't care what i pack when i'm go to my grandma's house cos i know that she'll pretty much have anything i need so
S0439	yeah
S0441	she's just that type of person what the hell be that
S0439	what the hell be what it's a spider
S0441	be it
S0439	think so
S0441	think it be an ant
S0439	oh maybe cos that bin really smell
S0441	i know why
S0439	i don't know it smelt the other day it be just i i i empty it i be like oh god what be that
S0441	that's only a new thingy though isn't it
S0439	yeah this house be just so warm like
S0441	that's probably why just
S0439	i'm so confuse to why our electricity and gas bill be so expensive
S0441	god know
S0439	when we don't even turn like we haven't have the heat on since like
S0439	may
S0441	not even may i'm sure it be like april
S0439	mm
S0441	maybe early may perhaps i can't remember now
S0439	but no but once if someone i assume someone will sign up this weekend for this house then
S0441	well we should yeah let's tell them then soon
S0439	we should contact the bill company
S0441	yeah
S0439	and be like erm we're move out
S0441	well yeah
S0439	on this date
S0441	if we can
S0439	if you can just put like organise like a final bill
S0441	if we can arrange for them to be able to move in december
S0439	yeah yeah
S0441	i want to know what this bloody woman be call er what her email address be i don't wanna email
S0439	yeah cos 's shite why won't she just be fire for be the shittiest estate agent in the world
S0441	she hasn't even get back to me like she didn't even email email me back like she's get someone else to ring me
S0439	like i genuinely want to just complain about her
S0439	but i actually look on their website for complaints and you i didn't i couldn't find it
S0441	that say a lot doesn't it
S0439	yeah i know
S0441	er let's just see if i've she er email me
S0439	maybe when you speak to her on the phone just be like can i have your email address so i can just
S0441	yeah
S0439	confirm what we say cos i don't really feel safe not confirm things
S0441	i don't either
S0439	no
S0441	that's why i want her to confirm it with me when on the email mm
S0439	she's shit
S0441	if i save this then that's the number she ring me from
S0439	yeah and then if she doesn't call you tomorrow
S0441	i'll just ring her
S0439	er call then just ring her back and like hi this be we have some burglars come round last night
S0441	don't
S0439	no offense but that if that girl come in and try to burgle us
S0439	you'd probably just have to throw some mud at her and she'd go
S0441	yeah but she wouldn't do it she'd just be report back
S0439	send the boy round
S0441	or her gang
S0439	her gang her gang of thieve and thugs
S0441	she's just she's just like the main woman and she ring up and say i've see load of really good stuff in this house that you need to pick up that's what she do
S0439	but also we know they're not burglars because there isn't even like a sign on the door say to let like they'd have to like scour websites all day
S0441	true
S0439	look for people who be just move out
S0441	true
S0439	and also why would they ring the estate agent and get like an appointment and stuff that's burglary go too far
S0439	that's excessive burglary
S0441	in fairness burglars could do that anyway couldn't they
S0439	yeah
S0441	come to like like an arrange let give false name
S0439	yeah exactly
S0441	steal all your stuff and then be do with it
S0439	yep yeah i wouldn't worry about it too much
S0441	we use to do that at uni anyway go to a house look round
S0439	just rock up
S0441	hi guy
S0439	how's it go we're gonna burgle your house
S0441	we be actually fight for a house
S0439	really
S0441	not not literally
S0439	yeah
S0441	but really nice house and we really want it so we literally like we the estate agent actual build be like the other side of so we literally all trudge over there
S0439	yeah oh
S0441	like take us age and as soon as we get there this big group of girls have just get there
S0439	oh no
S0441	and and and sign it we be just so annoy
S0439	do you wanna have a look on the internet and see if the house be list and how much it's list for
S0441	oh yeah good idea
S0439	i wonder if it's list for like eight hundred and fifty quid or something
S0441	that would be lol wouldn't it
S0439	like
S0441	er what be we look at rightmove
S0439	rightmove yeah rightmove dot com
S0439	i wonder what photo they probably just use the same photos as last time
S0441	it's seven seven five
S0439	oh really they've put it in the same exactly the same
S0441	there's only one photo oh no there's eight photos yeah seven seven five that's probably why it look even more
S0439	why haven't they put it back up at eight i wonder why they wouldn't put it at eight
S0441	dunno look how nice it look
S0439	cos she definitely could get eight for it
S0441	definitely could get eight for it
S0439	er the only reason we we go in lower cos we be be cheeky
S0441	yeah it look so nice now
S0439	really
S0441	be so shit
S0439	let's have a look
S0441	i think that's false advertise
S0439	that's massively false that look the kitchen look amaze
S0439	and that bedroom look amaze
S0439	this be such false advertisement
S0441	that's when it be probably like she'd just
S0439	her house yeah
S0441	yeah her actual house that she like care about now it's a shit heap
S0439	that look actually really nice doesn't it
S0441	yeah we be lure in as well
S0439	i love how they say oh it look better now than in the photos
S0441	
S0439	like what the fuck be you look at
S0441	to be fair i i don't like that lounge very much anyway
S0439	no but still
S0441	it's too clutter
S0439	can
S0441	i think our lounge look better
S0439	yeah i don't like clutter
S0441	shit what about the mirror that fell off the wall
S0439	should we replace it
S0441	well she didn't say anything about it do she i mean he didn't
S0439	well no he didn't actually that's true he didn't even mention the mirror
S0441	no
S0439	should we just not
S0441	not mention it
S0439	mention it see what happen
S0441	i don't think yeah see what happen i mean if the worst come to the worst they'll ask us to replace it won't they but
S0439	yeah we could just go go to home bargain and get one
S0441	just buy buy a mirror i can't think of anything else that's break apart from the fridge really
S0439	the fridge we can just sellotape up and say it be shit to begin with
S0441	yeah yeah exactly
S0439	because it be shit to begin with like it's an old fridge it's fall apart
S0441	and it's get just pack with ice
S0439	i wonder why fridges do go icy
S0441	i think it's the fact that they can't i think it's to do with the energy i'm sure
S0439	oh be it oh okay
S0441	and that they can't regulate themselves properly cos they're old
S0439	yep so basically the whole fridge need to be new
S0441	it really do yeah
S0439	this kitchen yeah it just look just like all like the doors be slightly fall off and
S0441	just peel away it just look shit
S0439	it look so like not ill that's not the right word
S0439	if it be a person it would look ill
S0441	if it be a person it would definitely look ill
S0439	it just look er
S0441	it just look batter
S0439	yeah it look unloved doesn't it
S0441	yeah it do that's what i think the risk of have an estate agent be that doesn't live near do you know what i mean
S0439	mm
S0441	cos they actually can't clap eye on the place it's all very well have that guy to come but i dunno what what must he be look for
S0439	i don't know
S0441	like proper proper damage
S0439	yeah that's what he be like like he be really impress with the level of like cleanliness we have but he wasn't really like look at the little things
S0441	cos surely if i be a landlady i would want him to look for
S0439	everything like mark
S0441	i wouldn't i wouldn't be happy like i mean i don't care cos i'm not live you know it's not a family home or i'm not live here for years but i wouldn't be happy with like that level of sort of finish would you
S0439	no no
S0441	if this be like a you know long term home like for example if i i guess they're maybe they're like this be their first home together probably
S0439	i think really they need to like just repaint the place
S0441	they do top to bottom
S0439	and just repaint the cupboards cos the cupboards just to be more white they look look like a bite of a weird yellowy mank colour
S0441	mm
S0439	the floor need to just be i think the flooring's just grim
S0441	rip up
S0439	thing be we genuinely have like we mop this and every time we mop it it look grimy
S0441	yeah
S0439	it's like
S0439	oh that's the problem with like who's
S0441	my grandad
S0439	ah okay
S0441	hello
