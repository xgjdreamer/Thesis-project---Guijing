S0386	no i've get that on tuesday i've get this
S0187	right
S0386	alright yes pretty good thank you yeah yeah be fine okay that's that's great thank okey doke thank bye
S0187	yeah it just sound like a massive massive chore
S0386	cos i've gotta well the post office be shut now i gotta box that up and get it to the post office
S0386	it's not very heavy just
S0187	big box yeah the size of it'll still matter painful anyway these morons at the back 's about six foot two just he's not well he be fat but he's like just a standard a standard middle not middle age but get towards middle age he's probably older than that get towards middle age erm he's definitely older than that he's probably in his forties erm middle age man so he's heavy and this other lump who get take off i think at half time who i'd never meet before but be awful i've get these guy at the back in a back three and we've get wing back of who's who's seventeen or eighteen he's he's one of our better players he's so skinny like he's my height but he be he be weedy as anything
S0187	yeah he joke at me i think what it i can't remember what it be he's we're in a we're er warm up before train of like before christmas and he say summat about be embarrass cos i knock him off balance or something and i start laugh and literally just get me arm and just go like that and throw him and i be like be you have a laugh cos he weigh nothing and i think he just think that i be in the same boat as him but i'm light but i'm not weak but erm yeah the i dunno who be right right wing back but yeah these guy the three slowest centre back i've ever see like be probably about as pacey as a regular centre back at this standard but he can't judge a ball and doesn't know what he's do so this ball's come down it's drop i'm think right a proper centre back's just gonna head that away easy head it away or bring it down do something with it he go to it and then go shit no back off
S0187	let's the ball bounce so then it's bounce up he's off balance the striker's think i've strike gold here he just go and nick if off his head not and flick one on to his other strike partner who just gas our other two slow centre back they run through and score second thing i go mental at like why you let a ball bounce like even if you lose the ball from head it somewhere don't let the ball bounce cos it put you in a whole world of trouble like two minutes later we lose the ball it go back into them dunno what happen but the ball go go through they get outpace again
S0187	keeper miss it keeper look like but like a neo nazi version cover in tattoo like all down his neck all over his body he look so scary he miss the ball i dunno what he be try to kick but he miss the ball then he go through score two more goals pretty much exactly the same me and be look at each other in centre mid we're in centre mid cos they put we have a five men midfield and they just put the best five players in midfield basically cos me and be play upfront but he play really well in centre mid and i think they just want a strong a strong midfield and erm we be play well like we be do really well but every five second they go and attack it be like they be gonna score and they score four manage to score one we make quite a few chance he could've have he could've a hat trick he could've have have four maybe but we're in a situation where we literally if we don't take every chance we get we'll lose cos the defence be so bad we'd benefit load i think if go at centre back cos he head a ball like no one's business and he's a he's a good footballer so he can judge a ball he's quick like he's everything you would want at this level in a centre back but he's waste at centre back cos he score goals and yeah set up attack and stuff it be it's just minging hate it so much know that there's nothing nothing i can do no matter how well i play or someone else play we're gonna lose we haven't get a game for two weeks now but
S0386	mm
S0187	we're erm it's just yeah it's just crap there be two lads that use to play for us but they leave wherever they go i should've go but they turn up to watch the game and they every so often they come and turn up and watch the game erm even though it's now a completely different team to what it be when they leave erm and they be sit in the car after the game and i be like yeah he be like what do you think of that i be like yeah and they start laugh and er i be just like the back line be ridiculous they start laugh their head off and then i be like yeah so if you know of any er defenders that you know might be knock around cos they both play one play leave back another play no they both play leave back actually but one can play in centre back be just think we lose game last year but the talent in the team be just we have a crap manager the talent in the team last year be completely different to what it be now it's like play for
S0386	do he still play football
S0187	yeah say i think couple of weeks ago he play against a the the teachers but he's still captain of he's still captain of the reserve i don't think he's play for the firsts i don't think he's get a sniff for them at the moment erm especially be captain i always have captain of the reserve you don't really wanna lose your captain to have him play for the firsts but yeah i think he play for 's every so often when he hasn't get a game but he's in wales at the moment so
S0187	yeah i don't know either i text him last night and just say i hear you're in wales he say yeah first day be pretty good but these glass be break
S0386	be they where
S0187	they're come apart the lens be come out oh no it's not
S0187	my er
S0386	i think somebody sit on that up there pick up
S0187	frame's bend
S0386	yeah the come off
S0187	mm brilliant what a ball that be
S0386	have actually get four pair of glass because
S0187	you've only get two eye dad
S0386	well i get two pair last time and i get two pair this time when i go two years ago or three years ago however long it but i can't see any difference there obviously be a difference or maybe there isn't maybe they just charge me because
S0386	i go
S0187	it be a different prescription
S0386	er yeah have another eye check and stuff
S0187	mm
S0386	and he say here glass but he never say to me you know how be it any worse he
S0187	mm
S0386	he say to me cos i read the fine ones he ask me to read the thing i read i could see them clear at the bottom
S0187	mm
S0386	and he say well that's strange because normally people can't read the ones at the bottom
S0187	yeah
S0386	erm
S0187	so your eye be fine
S0386	but it's just for close i can read for a distance but i can't
S0187	yeah
S0386	it's a bite blur when i get close when i get the glass i bring them home and i can't see any difference between the new ones and the pair i have before
S0187	mm
S0386	there must be a very very slight difference if there be cos i can't look into them i can't see any difference
S0187	it might just
S0386	so i've get so i've get four pair
S0187	it might just be a case of you can't see a difference but they're look after your eye in term of the little fine differences that you can't see
S0386	yeah they're probably there erm
S0187	it prevent
S0386	there obviously be little difference between them
S0187	mm
S0386	but i can't physically see it so i've get four pair of glass
S0187	mental
S0386	i've get one at work that be in the car
S0187	mm
S0386	there be that pair
S0187	get glass like erm you know that picture i send labyrinth
S0386	mm
S0187	yeah those be sick he's get a pair like that but they're just see through like fashion things they're not proper ones but i yeah i dunno why he didn't go for them cos the ones he's get he look well geeky

S0386	yeah and that's what she's do so i haven't get get a problem
S0187	yeah fair enough any chance of me live there when i come back
S0386	but it might be cos
S0187	i do i do think about it but i mention it and go what about you live there like have you ever think about live there when you
S0386	yeah
S0187	finish
S0386	pay the rent
S0187	well no yeah i have to i'd have to pay rent obviously but i think it's not a bad shout which mean i'd have to live in grantham but
S0386	erm there's get a couple of issue like the fire the fire the smoke alarm he say he say they leave a smoke alarm there but it's obviously be older he say the fire service come round go round all the house and put fire alarm up smoke detectors up
S0187	yeah
S0386	and they last reckon they last a couple of years
S0187	mm
S0386	and then one of them two of them keep go off i say just wear the batteries out they say no we've put new batteries in but just every so often they just go off in the middle of the night
S0187	yeah brilliant
S0187	brilliant
S0386	so they get angry and take them down and chuck them away i say why don't you ring the fire service
S0187	yeah i know
S0386	they say ah so i'm gonna go and buy a couple of smoke alarm and give them to put up
S0187	no just ring the cos you will get them for free they'll just they'll sort out whatever issue it be cos i ring them up for grandma didn't i and i'm sure they're er dunno whether they even bother fit or not but
S0386	for grandma
S0187	yeah cos they their things be go off both of them be go off
S0386	yeah i know i say to him once i go there i say to him these why doesn't somebody do something about these but anyway he
S0187	yeah yeah i get the
S0386	but i also wanna put a carbon monoxide monitor in the house
S0187	why
S0386	because they've get that back boiler thing
S0187	right
S0386	and they should have one in there especially so the guy say it be leak slightly
S0187	mm
S0386	so i'm gonna go and check it and they say they'll they'll maybe replace it completely but i'm not sure i'll put a back boiler i might just do a combi boiler
S0187	yeah
S0386	trouble be there's nowhere in the kitchen to put it
S0187	yeah i haven't see that see that place in years
S0386	haven't be there for years use to drive past and have a look
S0187	mm check it's not burn down
S0386	to check it's not board up
S0187	yeah
S0386	but er
S0187	what's the place in swindon like
S0386	haven't be there for years either that's
S0187	be it make any money
S0386	it's
S0187	cos you say it make money when it when it's full but as soon as it's not it's
S0386	when it's full yeah it's erm i haven't decide what to do with that it's not really that profitable cos happily i would've happily i would they've just change the erm they've change the agent the agency that be do it sell up to another be buy up by another company
S0187	mm
S0386	and that other company's actually charge me less
S0187	it's
S0386	erm
S0187	it's decent
S0386	company's do and they're actually do what they're suppose to do cos
S0187	mm
S0386	i ring the water board say they keep they wanna go and check the meter and they keep ask me could they fix up a time for them to come in cos they think i live there although they're send mail here and like and bill here
S0187	mm
S0386	i ring the i ring the people and say to them look thames water wanna come and check the meter could you arrange a time so that somebody could be there either one of the tenant or one of yourselves so that somebody could be there
S0187	mm
S0386	to sort it out and could you ring thames water and sort with them and he give me all sort of crap of why they couldn't erm they couldn't guarantee that there would be somebody that i say well get one of the tenant to be there
S0187	mm
S0386	just ask one of the tenant roughly when they're gonna be home and arrange or something they'd be there and they give me all sort of crap but they never go
S0386	cos they we could never every time they ring you know i say well in the end i give them the i ring up and give them the agency number
S0187	yeah
S0386	but since this since this erm company's be charge they've take over they've actually they go and read the water meter and go and read the electric meter
S0187	mm
S0386	and i haven't pay electric for any electricity for two quarter because they couldn't get in they be estimate the bill
S0187	right that can well that can go one of two ways then
S0386	well yes
S0187	can't it
S0386	it could go very badly
S0187	mm
S0386	but i've obviously be overpay which be better than not pay enough
S0187	yeah
S0386	so they know the gas both the gas and the water for the last two months in quarter
S0187	do they take it off the bill that you would pay
S0386	yeah last two quarter i haven't pay any money
S0187	good we've get our water estimate
S0386	i've get it here actually be it
S0187	our water estimate be for a four bedroom house cos no not four yeah be it for a four a three or four bedroom house be our water estimate
S0386	a hundred and thirty quid in debit
S0187	a hundred and thirty quid oh so they owe you a hundred and thirty quid
S0386	mm
S0187	decent yeah we've get gas electric be obviously we pay on a meter but have the choice he be like you either pay do we get a meter for your water and you pay as and when base on that or we'll give you an estimate and pay that but the house be register as a three or four bedroom house
S0386	mm
S0187	despite there be seven of us live there
S0187	so we pay nothing in comparison to what we actually should be pay
S0386	mm
S0187	and we don't pay council tax cos we're students so decent say that i don't pay it but there be a water bill come up by the way not that you pay not that you see it but
S0386	this be the gas bill three hundred and fifty seven quid in debit
S0187	they owe you three hundred and seventy quid
S0386	so they owe me five hundred quid
S0187	jeez
S0386	altogether there be an issue with the gas because i somebody be in the house and i get a massive bill i think who who's use who's use all this all this gas
S0187	mm
S0386	and i think it be because somebody new have move in but when i do check the bill it be an estimate bill
S0187	right
S0386	and i keep tell people let the gas people in try to let them in to read the meter
S0187	just sort it out yeah
S0386	and i keep say but it's funny cos they have some company ring here and ask if erm hey penalty
S0187	absolute nightmare defend
S0386	ask me if wanna change the agencies
S0187	yeah
S0386	so they obviously know i be we be get complaints from other people just touch him and go over
S0187	it's the first time i've see him play he still talk to every so often apparently
S0187	they be just shout chelsea reject at him
S0187	people be so rich
S0386	like footballers
S0187	it's insane the
S0386	oh yeah the on the erm
S0187	the lower league ones aren't but
S0386	this and the rich list whatever it's call the top twenty three quarter or footballers or half the footballers or something
S0187	really
S0386	they be say the other night i i just get a glimpse of it something i be watch i didn't really pay i wasn't really pay attention but then when they say three quarter of football i just register that's what they say but i didn't really
S0187	yeah well it's not surprise if you think in they like this be championship football they get a decent wedge
S0386	who's gonna spend a hundred and seventy on a week
S0187	yeah but you have an amaze house which you then have to heat and whatever and
S0386	obviously not gonna spend it be you
S0187	depend how nice your house be
S0386	well if your house be that nice it wouldn't cost you anything to heat
S0187	er true i suppose it'd cost you lot to buy it though
S0386	because it'd cost a lot to buy but i mean you buy that's it you you will never have a mortgage
S0187	yeah
S0386	erm you'd have it insulate properly so
S0187	so you don't pay yeah
S0386	and
S0187	solar panel and whatever
S0386	yeah whatever be even without solar panel if it's well insulate and you have underfloor heat
S0187	mm
S0386	it it erm it's so much cheaper than these bloom things here i tell you we have up in that farm i know somebody in the in the farm there i remember i this be all next year we have some lamps they've get heat lamps that heat the we still have to use them when we the first room first go to heat the room up
S0187	mm
S0386	well we have some heat pad we buy some heat pad put in the in the bottom of the for the pig to lie on they're not very hot they're not as hot as lamps
S0187	yeah
S0386	obviously neon but it's make such a big difference to the quality of the pig erm i haven't measure the but i'm sure it's a lot less electricity erm use the heat lamps
S0187	yeah
S0386	cos a lot they don't it's not as hot there's not a lot of waste heat
S0187	can you use halogen lamps
S0386	yeah you can use halogen lamps
S0187	cos they're suppose to heat the don't understand how they work but they don't they heat like the body rather than just heat the surround air or have i misunderstand that
S0386	i dunno they're halogen lamps isn't for heat they're for light
S0187	yeah but i've hear they they're they don't yeah they don't get hot but they're warm
S0386	no like you can touch the bulb they don't they don't er
S0187	yeah they don't emit heat as such but they
S0386	that's why they erm all of all the erm the new replacement bulbs on on the farm gonna be they're gonna be halogen
S0187	halogen yeah waste as much energy
S0187	they they yeah they're just they're painful it it's a lot of money that they've get to throw around
S0386	mm
S0187	cos if you think like a premier league footballer obviously they're talk like the top players but you mean phil jones i know he's a manchester unite footballer but he's on fifty grand a year that be a quality a wage for a quality salary
S0386	fifty grand a year
S0187	no he earn fiftty grand a week sorry fifty grand a year be a quality salary for anyone but he get that every seven days
S0386	mm
S0187	every seven days
S0386	also they can't spend it because a lot of the stuff that ordinary mortals they go and buy they get give
S0187	mm
S0386	they get sponsor their boot be free their clothe be free
S0187	yeah they don't have to pay for anything football relate they don't have to pay
S0386	erm they would probably get a car give
S0187	yeah
S0386	you know a lot of these land rovers they go and buy one because especially a lot of these four by fours and stuff these guy run around in they're give
S0187	mm barcelona have a apparently messi and iniesta speak to alexander hleb when he go from arsenal to barca they have like a deal with it be either audi or mercedes and hleb basically go and get the most expensive mercedes he could
S0386	mm
S0187	because he could do and they be like no that's not how we do things over here
S0187	you get get this one but yeah it be a free car
S0386	mm
S0187	so he just get like the most flashy one he could
S0386	yeah they give you even in cricket in cricket erm these people that play for these these
S0187	ipl and
S0386	yeah but the the county county cricketers get give cars
S0187	yeah
S0386	because it's advertisement for them
S0187	yeah yeah
S0386	you see run around in a big four by four everybody who get a little bite of money and that could afford would go and wanna go and buy one
S0187	yeah
S0386	cos he's get one
S0187	put you in the same bracket as him
S0386	yeah so they don't they don't they're not gonna spend it
S0187	and one one car to them isn't an isn't a big deal
S0386	no they're not gonna spend it
S0187	yeah i the only thing that you can kinda go well alright be the fact that their career's so short
S0386	mm
S0187	which be the trouble for lower league footballers because they've gotta find something they have to find something to do after football to earn money like a league one or league league two footballer have to have something come out of football whereas frank lampard's there like yeah i'm on plan a lot so i write book and i go to the publisher and he publish my book
S0187	something to do when i finish when i finish football it's like well he doesn't need anything

S0386	mm
S0187	he won't be on he won't be on millions he won't be on probably won't be on hundreds of thousands work for them but be on a fair whack like yearly for them lot so he's earn a good live just from and he's get that for as long as he want really i suppose
S0386	mm
S0187	cos it's not something that age be gonna dictate but yeah it's erm you've gotta you've gotta have your your wits about you i i think rooney's one of them where he's come on leap and bound in term of his eloquency like i mean his eloquence when he's talk he use to really struggle
S0386	mm but beckham be the same beckham as a lad he could
S0187	yeah

S0187	but now yeah he's he's brilliant he's an ambassador for things he's talk in front of people and he's brilliant and yeah rooney be
S0386	it's cos people like him you see he can talk all sort of shit and nobody will
S0187	i don't even listen to them i just stare at his face
S0386	really criticise too much what he say until
S0187	the guy make me sick
S0187	but yeah like like rooney's just a very good talker now and so he he'll have they've get him in when he retire
S0386	mm
S0187	they'll get him in to talk ex england captain bore
S0187	like and they'll give him money for it and it's just like it's just painful like i think about how much i'm gonna owe in term of tuition fee and all my all my university fee it'll be forty grand plus which be absolutely nothing to them they'll have watch which be which cost that much
S0386	mm
S0187	it's insane
S0386	doesn't bear think about
S0187	yeah
S0386	pure madness
S0187	the thing be i suppose like with that you give yourself you they will still have pressure like money pressure at time but i think that i i think if i have that much money i would have a really great house i wouldn't have a ridiculous house i would have everything to the point where i never have to worry about money i wouldn't go excess to the point where right i'm earn two hundred grand a week but i'm pay out a hundred and ninety five grand like i'd keep a spare hundred grand every week just sit it in
S0386	you know even if you do that if you do that for a month you couldn't do it for every you couldn't do it every month what you gonna do you're gonna
S0187	yeah but then you gotta think
S0386	you just start you start buy stuff you go on a spend spree you start buy stuff by the end of the second month you think well what be i gonna buy this month
S0187	what's there leave to buy yeah drake say it in one of his songs like before christmas one of them be what be it just just trade two just spend two ferraris on a new bugatti just cos it's something to do
S0187	cos he's yeah he make he's sponsor by sprite him and rihanna be both sponsor by sprite and he i don't know how much he earn but dare i mention them in the same bracket but they're they're both i know they're both sponsor by sprite sprite they can make like what twenty million in a month worth of show like on a just a road trip on a road tour and he's like yeah it's just something something to do you get bore
S0386	yeah it's
S0187	but i'd rather have that much money than than not have it and have to worry about it but then if i if i be earn that much money i would have something set up so that when i leave football i always have something to do oops so i'd set up a business or something or a charity or something that would keep my attention and keep me good have a purpose

S0187	but yeah i know but like just in term of
S0386	oh the advert
S0187	yeah like

S0187	it's not if you think how much and get pay for have get a thing she's get a thing come up erm in the summer she's gonna be on tv talk about beauty products on one of the like shop channel erm i think she say it's around a grand or something she'll get pay for each one just for go there and talk for a bite and look good you like like that's nothing and then if you're a big celebrity imagine how much they're gonna actually pay you so yeah it's it's mental if you think about the business and stuff i speak to my tutor have a a meet with him on thursday he be ask what i be do i be tell him what i be think of do and er
S0386	so what's up with do
S0187	no he love it he's a he's a lefel level one coach erm anything football relate he look over at me and whatever he always talk about football in his lecture he shoe horn it in somewhere football and sex like pretty much involve in every single one of my lecture on a thursday in some capacity this week it be it be rape i think we be look at sun stories and rape come up but he's obsess erm yeah he he he love football he be talk to me about it we spend the first fifteen minutes of the thingy talk about that and he be like do you think it like do english would've benefit you in anyway towards that i be like yeah in bits we speak about it but he say i need to go check out nottingham properly
S0386	mm
S0187	and i've just i've be think the last couple of days about sponsorships as well
S0386	mm
S0187	if i can get hold of a sponsor a decent sponsor to give me five hundred quid for the year or whatever just for me to have them on their ooh just for me to have them on my kit and stuff
S0386	mm
S0187	i dunno who i dunno who erm who i could be able to get kind of thing but a bite of just to like help me out and stuff every time i think about it i've i do it in bulk i don't think i don't do anything with it for a couple of weeks and then i'll spend like till the early hours of the morning look at stuff i need to actually get into nottingham and see what things be like
S0386	mm
S0187	and i'm not really pressure with it but think in term of availability of picture and stuff like that people have for the new season people'll make block book at the start of the season where they wanna train or whatever from a certain time to a certain time and in which case i need to get in there early so i can get hold of the facilities which'd be like august time or end of july it's not that far away and obviously get in contact with school and stuff it's worry
S0187	yeah i've already get one erm go in and have thing be things need to be sort because i need to have a it need to be a case of right this be a business this be set up it's register blah blah blah blah i wanna do this with your school will you let me do it rather than go i'm think of do this and whatever cos i've do that before i do the i send letter and i ring up and send email to people and school in fish ponds erm think at the end of the first year just to see if i can go round and do sessions with them no one get back to me
S0386	mm
S0187	erm so i think a need it'd be a case of ring up and have a meet with somebody and actually be able to show my face there and win them over
S0386	yeah cos you can probably get so many
S0187	yeah exactly and the some of them be like yeah we've already get someone that do do football for us we've already get someone that do whatever for us do you do cricket no well okay then then no so it's like that it's a bite it's a bite of a stinker cos there be there be a lot of people who i know there's there's guy in lincoln that do it they've start do it at uni at lincoln uni and have get a business go erm they do various sport i think around school and they do it in school time and whatever they've get that thing set up and they're do quite well off it erm i meet them on a night out once some really arrogant guy but do well for themselves so it's definitely something that's be everyone's do but it's not what what i wanna do anyway i just need a bite i need like access to school every so often just to put the name out like
