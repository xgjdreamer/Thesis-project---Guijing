S0655	i'll definitely need wash up gloves
S0653	erm sometimes that do happen yeah
S0655	and then you can't
S0653	or if you've get something sharp that you're wash up then it kinda can make hole in the wash up gloves but yes we'll get some wash up gloves for both of you
S0655	gloves
S0654	more wash up gloves like children er wash up gloves

S0654	and can you erm when it's go to be can you have a word with them please
S0653	i
S0654	to tell them i that sometimes i get really really upset and really really really erm

S0655	don't knock it till you try
S0653	yes it be an expression yeah an idiom i well no it's not an idiom but yeah it be an expression
S0655	uhu whenever someone say it's an idiom i think it's an idiot
S0653	i don't know what knock it till you've try it kind of actually originally mean what other weird phrase do we know
S0655	erm my teachers say i be young once
S0653	that's not a weird phrase be that because you can't imagine your teachers be young
S0655	i get that look
S0655	i and the main character say
S0654	or like girls can
S0655	like when at some erm people say things they don't mean when grow up say i be young once
S0654	like i'm
S0654	i'm i'm like i've get a good idea i've get a good idea
S0653	mm
S0654	erm if you if you give up you cannot try if you give up you cannot try
S0655	no that work
S0653	that do work baby
S0655	cos if you give up do something
S0653	be you try to do the yoda thing
S0654	if you try mm try mm try give up do not

S0654	mm
S0655	there be no try
S0653	that's right
S0655	just
S0653	do or do not there be no try that be the yoda thing
S0655	yeah it mean just go for it
S0653	what about get catch red hand that's a a phrase isn't it a bite funny
S0655	that's weird
S0653	i think it come from when criminals be catch for steal they use to mark people's hand with a brand so it would be red
S0653	so you would you would so you would actually see
S0655	for the rest of their life
S0653	yeah i'm pretty sure that's it what about rain cat and dog that's an idiom isn't it
S0655	mm an idiot
S0654	it's rain cat and dog
S0653	which mean it's rain heavily and i think
S0654	oh be there a labrador
S0653	i think either there's two versions like when animals use to go hide in the eaves the inside structure of a house then it rain really heavily they use to kind of drop down
S0653	that's what one theory be but the other theory be that sometimes you do get strong rain storm which lift things up from one place and put them down in the other so there be a time where it be rain frog cos frog be and rain fish rain fish
S0655	yeah i remember rain frog
S0653	yeah
S0655	er because they like
S0653	so i think that's where it come from
S0655	be all whisk up and then fell down i would hate that i do not like frog
S0654	mm
S0653	well i think they would be very surprise frog
