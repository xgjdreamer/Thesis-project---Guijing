S0455	oh yes
S0454	do you know how to do that dad
S0452	yeah erm
S0454	you pick your own offer

S0454	no but d'you know how to do it for mum
S0452	well yeah with her card
S0454	yes
S0452	yes
S0454	cos they're not link be they your card
S0452	no
S0454	no so then mum could pick her offer
S0452	yeah
S0454	yes
S0455	what do i have to do
S0452	erm go on their site
S0455	yes
S0452	then probably log
S0455	log in
S0452	log in
S0452	and then it's call that business be call my offer
S0455	call what
S0452	my offer
S0455	oh right okay
S0452	and erm out of their whole menu what they sell they put a little mark by an item if it's eligible
S0455	okay
S0454	aha
S0452	so erm bell's whisky you probably wouldn't get it but
S0454	but if you want waitrose whisky or some other one you probably would
S0452	it it might well do it might well do yes because erm one of the ciders be on
S0454	oh that's good
S0455	can you get ten of the same thing or not
S0452	no because you only need to mark it once
S0454	cos it's every time you go mum
S0452	every time you go you get twenty p off twenty percent off that item
S0454	so if you're always buy lamb
S0455	yes
S0454	then every time you buy lamb if you select that offer you'd get twenty percent off every time
S0455	what for unlimited
S0452	erm i think until they change till they change them
S0454	yeah
S0452	which'll be i think they say the end of do this for the summer and it will change in the autumn
S0455	okay
S0452	but but they don't do things like fresh meat
S0454	ah right
S0452	but like erm alpen
S0454	yeah that's good
S0452	i get one today you know it be like mum like that and that's like seventy p off a large a large packet
S0454	oh that's quite a lot yeah so you want something where it's a couple of pound normally or more don't you because then you'll get a a bigger save
S0452	oh yes yes that big bag
S0454	for something you buy quite regularly
S0452	yeah that big bag so it's
S0454	yeah
S0452	it's only three fifty
S0454	yes
S0452	and you get seventy p off
S0454	yes it's good
S0455	i don't erm with i know they've do it for a reason the arrangements it be a whole lot of fuss find it quite annoy
S0454	yeah
S0455	erm and then you know you've gotta go and ask the machine
S0452	you have to go to the till
S0455	yes i
S0452	any till to get to yeah
S0455	yes i suppose that there's another way round it
S0452	i i suppose
S0454	take your own mug
S0452	well
S0454	and then go to the machine
S0452	actually by the machine they've get some quite you know those travel mug with a lid
S0454	yeah
S0452	they've get like a bite erm a special polythene thing you know
S0454	yeah
S0452	ones that you can buy for about three pound
S0454	ah right
S0452	er so that you do reuse it all the time
S0454	oh so you could do that
S0452	i think so yes
S0454	oh that's clever expect they've already work that out in
S0455	seem all a bite
S0452	yeah i suppose it
S0454	yeah if you're go to do a generous offer then there's not much point try to claw it back be there
S0452	no
S0454	it's one or the other just don't do it otherwise
S0452	i suppose though you're have too many people fill
S0454	yeah
S0452	who didn't spend a penny
S0455	cos if they could work out a bite of a system
S0452	yeah yeah i agree
S0455	i'm sure they could
S0454	yes
S0452	yes
S0452	yeah because an easier way would be have the drink machine
S0454	outside
S0452	and have the cup there
S0454	yes
S0452	take away and you take your discount
S0454	thirty p
S0455	thirty p
S0452	it be large latte latte be it
S0454	yes yes
S0452	one purchase oh no you only have one card didn't you
S0454	yes we could've have two card

S0454	yeah mine hasn't come i do order it it's annoy
S0452	oh yeah so it'll come in the post
S0454	yeah be interest to see when the house be do how long it take for the post to arrive
S0452	oh yeah
S0454	i think yes the because the solicitor say it's all register at the post office so maybe straightaway

S0452	yes
S0455	complain she want to buy an older one but
S0454	yes no it be sensible she buy a house didn't she
S0455	spend money on spend money on repair

S0455	that be probably
S0454	yes but she do well
S0455	erm yeah it be good
S0454	yeah
S0455	think it be very near the sea
S0454	yeah
S0452	i remember it be
S0455	yeah
S0454	but she say it's change now it's all build up
S0452	apparently there's a bigger development
S0454	it's all basically now they've build all the way out there
S0454	mm
S0455	
S0454	oh right oh i don't remember that yes well that's a good idea isn't it
S0455	we do talk about move from her present house quite a bite but i think now she's get more

S0455	yes it
S0454	quite a way there's a garage
S0455	yes half of it's the other side of the apparently
S0454	ah right and the train station that's useful
S0455	yes that's very handy well be very young
S0454	ah yes he say that to me too
S0454	it's quite a good university now it's better
S0455	it's not too far away
S0452	what sort of
S0454	no
S0452	subject be he interest in
S0455	erm i think sort of thing
S0454	yeah
S0455	science
S0454	perhaps he should go into politics
S0454	start young
S0455	or something like that it's very
S0454	yeah
S0454	no
S0452	yes it yeah
S0452	yes it be yeah
S0454	yes it's much better
S0454	yes well it's in that russell group isn't it
S0452	i think it might be
S0454	think it's one of the russell ones for some things it's the best in the country
S0452	sorry for some things
S0454	yes for like arabic study or arab study
S0454	oh right
S0455	it's better
S0454	yes but
S0452	they didn't do they
S0454	ah well she didn't have much choice in that
S0454	yeah
S0455	and then should come under maths it's under maths i think
S0454	well she still probably could cos you know the pgces they're so short of maths teachers they let you do a conversion course
S0455	yes
S0454	and actually because she's get the a level
S0454	then she'd get on it wouldn't she and then
S0452	yeah
S0454	just do that and then you can do the pgce and
S0452	yeah
S0454	well she probably wouldn't want to be a maths teacher but there be a way
S0454	yes yes i think she prefer adults
S0455	yes there yes there be ways but when you really want to do something
S0454	yes
S0454	i wonder how much they really check the universities to be honest when you apply for grant so it's about prove you're resident isn't it but that could be a bank statement how can they know
S0454	no oh i do hear a lot yes
S0455	but she be go to spend year
S0454	oh yes that be crazy
S0455	and then there be another one where and every summer she be go to different european capital and then
S0454	oh yeah
S0455	yes and then be very worry
S0454	yeah
S0454	yes you need a stable job
S0455	i think so
S0454	no
S0455	cos anyway she
S0454	no that be good ah
S0452	that's a nice view that
S0454	it's lovely yes
S0454	it's very nice yes
S0452	it's get a little pond there
S0454	yes
