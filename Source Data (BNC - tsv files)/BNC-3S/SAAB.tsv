S0521	i don't know i wonder what 's like with two daughters he's always be quite protective hasn't he
S0519	mm but i i think
S0521	and christian
S0519	i don't know
S0521	i think you may be make an assumption there
S0519	maybe but
S0520	in most case once your child have leave home you now they're they're consider able to make that type of decision aren't they
S0519	yeah that's right but erm no i be just mean i think i think it's be actually a bite much
S0520	yeah fair enough
S0519	it's a seriously expensive restaurant
S0520	be it
S0519	which be really absolutely fine but erm
S0521	well choose it
S0519	choose it but you know to then start add other people into the whole scenario
S0520	yeah randomers effectively
S0519	randomers
S0520	young randomers
S0519	that's not you know i i i don't
S0520	yeah no that's the other thing isn't it you want it to just be the familiar people
S0519	mm
S0521	mm
S0520	and what about
S0519	yeah she hasn't get a boyfriend so he's not come unless she's get one in the next three weeks
S0520	no just i be wonder if she have one
S0519	no she doesn't at the moment
S0520	she's a teacher isn't she
S0519	mm
S0520	mm
S0521	yes
S0519	they're lovely girls
S0520	yeah they always be
S0519	but no i i be kind of she just drop it into the conversation oh by by the way we've invite erm 's boyfriend
S0521	what do say that to you
S0519	yeah erm hope that's okay but they've invite
S0520	well maybe he's a boyfriend from school that she's be with for years
S0519	yeah i don't know
S0521	could be
S0519	i think it be inappropriate if my dad hasn't meet him then it's not appropriate
S0520	mm
S0519	anyway
S0520	yeah
S0519	er too late
S0520	too late
S0519	so you can't say it afterwards you can say it before can't you
S0520	mm afterwards
S0519	erm we be wonder whether it be appropriate to invite 's boyfriend how do you feel
S0520	yeah
S0519	that's alright
S0520	i do understand i mean you know you do accept the boyfriend of your children girlfriend of your children into the family don't you because they do matter a lot to your child
S0519	yeah
S0520	so i think that's like a gesture probably to him as well isn't it but yeah fact be that it's erm
S0521	didn't i hear that he be a local he be not a student at
S0519	oh i don't know so if that's true that could be then that he's a long term
S0520	could be that he's on the scene for a few years yeah local resident
S0519	a man
S0520	a man yeah oh be she at be she
S0521	she's at
S0520	what do she study
S0521	er film technology i think it be
S0519	film and
S0521	or film media study
S0519	film and journalism
S0521	film and media study
S0519	yeah something like that
S0520	cool
S0521	apparently she's quite
S0519	it's creative anyway very creative
S0520	yeah well that's quite vocational isn't it it's good
S0521	she be er she's already get a job or something already get a
S0520	mm
S0521	a connection which
S0520	love
S0521	they're go to make a film and i think the the class be approach for people from to help
S0520	groovy
S0519	mm
S0521	yeah i think it's this clapperboard stuff you know director's sit in a stool and
S0520	yeah no people like it
S0521	yeah
S0520	i think it's get a little bite more fashionable to do i mean media and film in be you know a grow subject anyway cos everything be on
S0519	mm mm
S0521	video yeah
S0520	video now and the phone and everything but also you know to be a bite more technical have technical skills and have more vocational skills i mean if you're go to pay nine thousand pound a term be it
S0519	mm
S0520	for your university education maybe anthropology be not that key
S0519	a year
S0520	to
S0519	no it's kind of they're suppose to
S0521	it's a very narrow mind idea
S0520	no i know it's narrow mind but i think that people think more like that now than they use to because it's not just like you guy have a free
S0519	i i do no mm
S0520	education at university so it seem more justify
S0519	and it be see as an education and it be a ticket to a job
S0520	liberal arts yeah
S0519	whereas now it's not
S0520	whereas now you have a degree and
S0521	thank the labour party for that
S0520	oh really yeah no that's impressive and
S0519	but also not well be it ten percent of the population five percent go to university
S0521	it be tiny
S0519	it be it be tiny percentage
S0520	now everyone go
S0519	now it's forty percent
S0520	well not everyone but erm if you do go you have to seriously think about it because you're go to end up with a very large debt at the end of it and it have to be worth it doesn't it and the thing be that during the recession so many students graduate and couldn't find employment so it doesn't feel very optimistic it's better to do something where you say okay i train as a
S0519	mm
S0520	plumber and i'll have job because then
S0519	i be really surprise cos my friend in have a son just do his sort of advance highers at and they'd expect and hop that he would get sufficient grade to do you know some kind of engineer sciencey type thing in edinburgh or glasgow and he and he didn't in his highers
S0520	mm
S0519	he he get you know far too low his grade and so instead of do advance highers he's do his highers again
S0520	mm
S0519	but in fact he's change to a lot of arty things and cos his parent have say there's no point just do the same thing again and fail again you give it a good shoot choose some other things and they're have all sort of problems but i be say look you know erm he like history
S0520	mm
S0519	i say well do history and then go into recruit and she's really good at her job it's a very good job and you know that's
S0520	mm
S0519	and she say i don't think we could cope with him do an non vocational degree
S0520	bad parent sentence i don't think we could cope so
S0519	erm well maybe that's not quite how they put it but he won't be do that
S0520	yeah yeah
S0519	a vocational degree at our expense
S0520	i mean fair enough i i do understand that at our expense
S0519	well you know i i'm fill all the naughty gap in but
S0520	no well fair enough
S0519	but they don't even have to pay in scotty land
S0520	he just might do really if he doesn't what he want that's the thing
S0519	that's what i think
S0520	mm
S0519	that's what i want to say
S0520	you don't have to pay in scotty land so what's the deal well it's just a tougher market isn't it
S0519	erm
S0520	mm
S0521	yes it be because there's
S0520	would you like strawberries and yoghurt
S0521	a scottish thing
S0520	erm
S0519	or cheese and biscuits or
S0520	ooh ice cream
S0519	ice cream
S0521	ice cream
S0519	magnum
S0520	mini magnum
S0521	delicious ice cream
S0519	mini magnum
S0520	we be quite target in our shop we didn't like get anything good we just get biscuits and magnums
S0519	we do a biscuits and magnums that's alright and chocolate
S0520	er i agree with you
S0519	and red wine for dad no wine for me
S0520	mum's off the wine
S0519	i'm go to have i've i've pour the last of that bottle and oh just make sure that bang that's it
S0520	mm
S0521	yeah
S0519	i'm just go to have a couple of days off
S0520	mum's on the
S0521	oblivious
S0520	that's the word
S0519	but i'll be back on it soon enough
S0519	but i think i'll i'll just try and go for a one a night
S0521	so what's the then
S0519	once i've i have a couple of days off and then go back to one a night but this be my one for tonight
S0520	okay
S0521	be that the long term plan for you
S0520	almond classic or white
S0519	almond please thank you
S0521	be there one white one plain leave
S0519	erm
S0521	classic please sock it to me
S0519	i think er long term ought to be none in the midweek
S0521	none in midweek and how long do that last
S0519	er it doesn't tend to last very long
S0521	and how long be the midweek be it wednesday or
S0519	monday to thursday
S0520	i think have a glass of wine with dinner be all respectable isn't it
S0519	mm mm
S0520	it's what the respectable french people do
S0520	healthy cholesterol french people and the eyeties
S0519	mm
S0521	yeah
S0520	it's always the difficulty
S0521	yeah they have to water it down as well
S0521	the french
S0520	excuse me so it's austerity be it no austerity be never the way to just have healthy habit don't you
S0521	cycle as well you know
S0519	thank you darling
S0519	will do
S0521	mm
S0520	yeah it's a real
S0521	it be your idea in the first place
S0519	you always steal my ideas and then go for them further than i do
S0520	them
S0521	get up early and go to the paper shop you say every morning
S0520	well mum do get early but she's just one of those type
S0521	mm
S0520	i read an article about erm can't remember some academic have do research into sleep pattern over er different age group
S0519	mm
S0520	and his discoveries be that erm the natural internal clock for erm different age group be be be naturally different because of the chemical balance you know so for instance it's it would be natural for a teenager to wake up at nine be
S0519	mm
S0520	and then so it start off early and then teenagers obviously always wake up late but it's not like he be try to say it's not because they're lazy it's because they have their internal clock be transition and it's go it's move to a later phase and then mid mid twenties be like some slightly different to forties and then you kind of go back an early morning clock after the age of sixty
S0519	early mm
S0521	right
S0520	but he be suggest that it would be more productive for instance to allow people in their early twenties to start work at ten be instead of eight because
S0519	some school have change to ten o'clock
S0520	have they
S0519	mm
S0520	because they're go to be more efficient
S0521	yeah
S0520	if they're because they're you know be you if you're suppose to wake up at ten and you have to wake up at eight and have that kind of horrible dull couple of hours you know where you just can't your cognitive function be just aren't on
S0519	dull feel yeah well it's really
S0520	i have it i mean i'm i mean and you also have like morning people and night owls it's a typical stereotype but it be true i mean i can just see in people people that get up early have always get up early and will always get up early
S0521	mm
S0519	mm
S0520	and vice versa you know if i'm leave to my own devices
S0519	mm
S0520	i'm quite nocturnal always and if i'm i can do like a a enforce routine and it doesn't bother me particularly but as soon as i stop have to get up
S0519	that's like dad
S0520	i just erm gravitate towards late nights and late mornings
S0519	mm
S0521	mm
S0520	it's funny isn't it i wonder what that's about i mean it's all hormonally control isn't it
S0519	mm
S0520	but he be yeah the research be suggest that we should alter our structure accord to these things and it would be more efficient i wonder how easy that would be though
S0519	but it's just the year before i finish the year that i finish i quirk of the timetable be that our fourth years which be exam year
S0520	mm
S0519	get their maths lesson first thing every morning
S0520	mm
S0519	erm the top set group they it it say it it didn't appear to affect them and the lower set group the teacher say she couldn't notice any difference and i have middle group and i would honestly say it be an absolute disaster
S0519	they didn't want to be there
S0520	mm
S0519	and they be naturally respond to the fact that
S0520	they'd rather be in bed
S0519	it be half past eight
S0520	that's really early
S0519	and that's really early half past eight to half past nine be the lesson
S0520	mm
S0519	and even the ones who want to try their best be still you know like this
S0519	and they be just dull you know they be just dull just like you say that numb feel
S0520	mm
S0519	when you're awake and you're try to do it but it's just harder
S0520	it's just too hard yeah
S0519	and i think what i notice be cos for them maths be hard some of them didn't want to be there but quite a lot of them want to try
S0520	mm
S0519	it's just really hard
S0520	mm
S0519	so the subject be hard and it be really hard to get themselves awake and of course as the year go on quite a lot of them be late as well
S0520	yeah
S0519	so they miss the first quarter of an hour
S0520	oh dear
S0521	oh oh
S0519	and so cos we'd change the way our school work which be a disaster as well
S0521	disaster
S0519	but we instead of have registration at half past eight you can sympathise with this and lessons start at twenty to nine we have to share sixth form study with our another local school
S0520	oh yeah i remember
S0519	and they have to bus between them
S0521	oh oh
S0519	and so it help if we start at half eight and do our registration at break time
S0520	oh no
S0519	and so registration be at break
S0520	so no one be bother
S0519	and you know people have be use to not turn up till twenty to nine and miss registration and not care and now they be have to be in the build at
S0520	i be never on time for registration
S0519	half no and so now half eight be the begin of the lesson
S0520	and i be
S0519	mm
S0520	meet and cycle together to school

S0519	i'm do with today's treasure
S0521	oh right
S0520	this be mum's ongoing job now
S0519	i have to erm the hideous report that i should have write before we have our meet have to be do the monthly report but i'll do it tomorrow morning ching
S0521	tomorrow morning
S0520	what's our opinion of the floor then
S0519	i'm think i might like to ask about the top coat
S0520	i think that the problem with it be the grey ones like the other ones look really nice
S0519	mm bite too the others be nice
S0520	but the grey ones look like they've be
S0521	they've be
S0519	they've be scrub without be
S0520	partly concrete by a mistake or something
S0520	it's just like
S0519	no they're not nice
S0520	that's the that's the unfinished look about it whereas these ones look really nice
S0519	you can live with mm
S0520	i think you probably should do the top coat
S0519	you can live with a couple of grey but not so much
S0521	not to mention the oily ones in the hallway
S0520	that one you should go with the
S0519	i no yeah but the edge of it er have get a crack all along where the grout be as well so that might have be where his machine have try to level it cos he he use his machine to do a bite of level as well
S0520	i don't think you should be feel a bad you know if you at least ask them about it if they have any decency they'll say of yeah we've miss that off
S0521	they've get a good they've get a good explanation that's fine
S0519	mm
S0520	and if they don't then they should come back and do it you can't you know they you you pay a decent price so
S0519	huge price
S0521	we pay the full whack
S0520	you pay the full whack and to miss out a tile be a bite much isn't it
S0519	mm
S0520	i'm pretty such it's not do it look quite different to the other ones
S0519	i don't know mm be there be another one like it it'd be
S0520	and i also i think i just think when i when she be leave she really didn't want to be stick on the other side of the cycle race
S0519	yeah and i totally understand but she rush
S0520	but she rush and she i she you now i could see that maybe she would see that it's not do and then just say i'm not go to mention it i'm just go to get out of here do you know what i mean cos she be scrub it right at the end erm really quickly you know and she have five minutes or so to get out of the house so i mean i felt for her cos you don't want to be wait for three more hours
S0519	yeah but she should have say i'm go to come back but then it's probably an hours' drive so there be lot of things play in her head
S0520	yeah but that's the thing isn't it yeah
S0521	that's not our fault
S0520	no
S0519	no no i know
S0520	no i agree with that
S0519	i'm not try to say that i'm just say
S0520	i'm just say i think you should just before it become too long to say anything you should say something do you know cos after a while it's like er why be come back to me now

S0519	you can have the van one way can't you
S0521	yes but if if yes so either we do it on a different day somebody i drive there and back or we do one way but then we'd have to coordinate come down

S0520	and erm i mean i be 's go to delhi on the fifth
S0519	oh
S0520	of october but er so i be think about go around that time but i'm not in a rush erm so i'll i haven't speak to him yet so when he's here we'll have a little chat
S0521	so october in delhi what's that like well you're not go to stop there be you
S0520	not for even a second personally
S0521	you're just go to go pass through
S0520	's get to be in pushkar for the month really
S0521	pushkar
S0520	pushkar and jaipur which be where we be last time it be erm rajasthan so it's erm he do all his new collection at this time of year so he go with the design get sample make erm revise the sample you know get like an example of each of the collection make so that he can supervise that it's of the quality that he want it to be so and then meantime he do all kinds of other things but that's the main purpose of him be there and then there's like a big fair in delhi in the middle of october like a huge huge fair of all artisans from around india where he can find new you know new people to work with potentially or new particular jewellery that he want to so the idea be that they have a like a new collection every year yeah
S0519	mm
S0520	so that it keep interest so that's his purpose and my purpose be just to be waffle about by his side really i mean last time it be quite fine and nice it's quite a nice place and we just work in our separate work during the day and then in the even you know we can have fun together so it's quite nice
S0519	relax
S0521	interest the the stan bite in the name there's a lot of actually there be a lot of stans but they're sort of north of india not
S0520	you're right i think it's a moorish thing
S0521	there's not any stans in south india be there
S0520	no i think it might be a moorish thing dad
S0521	a lot well i don't know because a lot of the the old soviet republics be stans as well
S0520	mm
S0521	round turkmenistan and kazakhstan
S0520	no but weren't they originally weren't they originally conquer by the moor all of those
S0521	be they
S0520	think that be their kind of migration route i don't know certainly there's a strong muslim influence in the north of india but it never make it very far south so you find there's actually a very big muslim population in india one of the biggest in the world but you find it's concentrate in the north gujarat be very muslim so i don't know where that be cos i think that they come
S0521	well google it
S0520	well definitely google it they i think that they come down pakistan as well
S0521	there be lot of stans
S0520	there you go
S0519	mm

S0521	it's an ongoing story
S0519	bring it to the live room and we can all do some print
S0520	agree
S0521	i think the quick way be to turn the turn the extender off

S0521	well it do last time
S0520	i'm i'm sit next to it virtually though be that proximity to the router
S0519	no it's the something's go on with the extender
S0520	the booster bite
S0519	stop it yeah
