S0326	so the guy's like oh he's he's he's regret sort of go to teach there and he's on his go to summer holiday he's go to back to sydney and he stop off in some town in the outback and
S0381	yeah
S0326	can't escape cos he's sort of get do some gamble lose all his money he get on go on a sort of drink but it's like a really sort of straight square basically but within like half an hour the outback town just like turn him
S0326	but the outback look the outback look cool
S0381	yeah we didn't see that that be one
S0382	no never see australians though
S0381	they seem very straight forward
S0382	well i i like and also i think they're sort of much less you know sort of there's much more natural equality between it seem to me
S0381	but
S0382	but
S0381	when you be say that to he be like
S0382	i know but they because there be there's this classic image of australia as full of these super grossly macho people
S0381	oh oh right
S0382	but which be true there be these surf club where they have horrible
S0326	cricket team
S0381	yeah that's true
S0382	and that's all true but then it also have a massive gay community all in all react against erm and there be a specific but those be extremes apart from that they're very straightforward wonderfully irreligious
S0381	yeah
S0382	erm
S0381	and it's a law it's a law to vote
S0382	mm
S0381	that's a good one that it's er it's illegal not to vote i think that's
S0382	oh yeah that's cool
S0326	i know but then still that guy get in
S0381	yeah that's well the our australian friend
S0382	but when when do he
S0326	tony abbott sort of
S0381	but i think he get in
S0326	probably a year and a half ago
S0382	right
S0381	i don't be it a
S0381	be it a vote a popular vote i can't remember
S0382	they have a yeah but it but you know it be a leave wing government before
S0381	mm
S0382	mm it may well be you're right
S0381	yeah maybe it be a popular vote well that's what our australian friend be say that yeah it's to make people vote but there be also almost exactly the same to any other western country like it's not
S0382	what
S0381	there's no big difference the pattern
S0382	oh between leave and right
S0381	of who get in yeah
S0382	not much
S0326	but i find it difficult to believe that in if everybody vote in this country that would be the same
S0381	i know
S0382	but
S0381	i mean that's what i think he be say you think it might be different but
S0382	erm you'd in america there's no question
S0381	yeah
S0382	the democrats would go up wouldn't they
S0326	yeah

S0381	er do you be you
S0382	indie band
S0381	be you into music at all
S0326	no
S0382	that's so weird
S0381	you use to be
S0326	yeah
S0382	you should get back into it
S0381	do you play
S0326	no
S0381	guitar or anything
S0326	i play the piano some occasionally
S0382	well it's always there that's so weird i think there's a very intense music type but mine go on i didn't you be like really intensely involve in it and so be er sort of just be
S0381	yeah 's not either
S0326	just not that good er i
S0382	there be what
S0382	there be so much good music
S0381	i be not that into music
S0326	i mean there's good music but it's not like there's no good music now so it's like well there be but it's not like in fact there isn't really that
S0382	well there's but i mean that's doesn't matter about new music there be
S0326	yeah
S0382	more great music than you could ever listen to in a lifetime
S0326	yeah but do it i think it it's like the i get tire of that old music really quickly and you i and then and then
S0382	you can't there's too much
S0326	it's not but like when you listen to the those songs you will think about like in your life when you first hear them and stuff and they've be in like 's sort of get them all off the internet and i be like fourteen or whatever and listen to them but i don't don't have any attraction
S0382	i think that
S0381	there's no connection maybe
S0381	you know
S0326	well there be er in with okay a few songs but it's not really like it's not
S0382	there be lot of factor here cos in the old days you didn't have much money and you buy an lp and you listen to it a hundred time and you love it and
S0381	maybe they be just more common
S0382	and you'd really really think about what you'd get and you couldn't listen but nowadays i think the fact that all you need be a be what be it nine pound subscription or even free
S0326	it's free yeah
S0382	you can just get
S0381	oh to
S0382	anything you want at any time
S0381	what be that call
S0382	spotify
S0381	mm
S0326	well it's free on it's all on youtube as well free
S0381	yeah
S0382	erm
S0381	do you and your friends listen to have music on
S0382	i think it's destroy i think you're
S0381	in the background
S0326	at party and stuff yeah but not like
S0381	but it's not like you sit together and you say hey let's listen to this new album
S0326	no no way
S0381	see we even in my generation
S0326	like some of
S0381	we use to do this
S0326	some of my friends quite like
S0382	well of course you're pre
S0326	music they like sort of like blue and they'll put it on at like dinner just quiet
S0381	yeah
S0382	you're
S0326	and stuff
S0381	yeah
S0382	you're pre internet still
S0381	yeah yeah i guess maybe that have something to do with
S0382	and it's no
S0381	it be an activity
S0382	i think it's it you're right so you know i kind of print imprint on bob dylan things deeply and forever and you know i have two of his albums couldn't buy could only buy about one a year or something actually maybe it's mm it's unique and it's over
S0381	yeah i guess it be
S0382	it's just destroy something i reckon and you the idea be you there be things you listen to over and over again though weren't there er
S0326	yeah but i don't well don't really listen to them now
S0382	mm
S0326	don't really er yeah but i don't listen to them now like er i
S0382	so cos one of the things i've be do be like music be there be things you know and you love and you have no idea how to find them and you i remember find an old song in and i want to hear it
S0381	well there must be other things like that now but just not that
S0382	no everything's online
S0381	i don't know
S0382	book any old book
S0381	that's true
S0382	in the world you can go on advance book exchange and you'll find that it exist in some second hand bookshop in which be great
S0326	yeah it work with book though if if you
S0326	if when you find something that you you go into a second hand bookshop and you find something you didn't know you want
S0382	mm no book
S0381	yeah
S0382	no the the internet with book be really positive it mean every little bookshop in the world cos can be
S0326	yeah but that mean they have to sell them at one p then
S0382	what oh
S0326	you know if you if you go into a second hand bookshop on amazon that that store's probably sell their book for one p but not they're not in this
S0381	mm
S0326	they'd rather do all their through the store and charge you a pound
S0382	well if you go online for the kind of the more difficult book they're still charge reasonable price that make it really worth their while do i ever tell you about there be this children's book i have and i which i could not read beyond a certain page for
S0381	oh yeah i know you do tell us about this
S0382	cos it be so frighten
S0381	and so didn't you find it
S0382	and
S0381	and you couldn't find
S0382	i wonder for years what it i know what it be call and i you know in the end i find it and it be in a bookshop in and actually it be a well know author so it wasn't that big a i mean i erm and it i send off for it and it come and it be the same colour and it be a war a book print in the war therefore on crappy paper and it have all hardboards and fade and and then i read it and then i couldn't even see which be the bite that i be so frighten i couldn't go on
S0381	maybe something else happen
S0382	i do work it no i work it out in the end i or at least er rather there be a most plausible bite oh that's the intensity of childhood but that be erm or it i think yeah this be the big thing about be on your own so you always have i always think it be comfort to have your brother in the room all the time don't you think when you be little
S0326	no
S0381	yeah
S0382	i be on the
S0381	maybe once you've get to be
S0382	i be on the
S0381	a certain age

S0381	oh he would snore
S0326	not snore but we i'd would like try and i think if i

S0382	it could not possibly be i wonder whether
S0381	see i feel like you open it down here
S0382	well i wonder whether i kind of
S0381	because you say
S0382	because i want to protect it
S0381	i say what's that
S0382	whether i
S0381	and you say it's a present for
S0382	er i might've shove it in a bookcase just to protect it and then oh god
S0381	oh my god my eye be i wonder if it's from that dog
S0382	what
S0381	i'm have
S0382	oh allergies
S0381	yeah
S0381	oh fuck
S0326	what's sperm war
S0381	what really
S0382	oh that's really interest
S0382	so all the little sperms be fight it out
S0326	you have to get a book about this
S0382	what well it's really interest cos it's one of the natural
S0381	do you look through all this stuff like
S0382	i don't know
S0381	i mean she could've easily stack it up there because if she be she clean
S0382	what happen to all the cookbooks when i where do i put them
S0381	you put the cookbooks in there
S0382	in where
S0381	i think in that cupboard
S0382	oh oh god
S0382	you really don't think it
S0326	yeah i don't
S0381	it wouldn't be in the window
S0382	in what window what do you mean oh er i it would be so stupid to put it there but that doesn't rule it out
S0382	of course
S0381	you didn't put it in the bag of things for by mistake
S0382	no you
S0381	
S0382	yes
S0381	you didn't put it in the
S0382	no i really don't think so no i didn't cos i empty that out
S0381	oh
S0326	why be there what's the theme for this bookcase
S0382	mm what
S0326	what's the theme for this bookcase
S0382	the theme be well there's er travel and then er interest oddities er most of these book be in your bedroom when you be a kid
S0326	maybe i should er take that
S0382	oh yeah why not why not that's a good idea that's always useful so i can't see it
S0326	they've only get two line on the metro
S0382	what oh it might how old be it
S0326	i guess that's a problem with a city like i remember erm read about them try to build a tunnel under the bosphorus and they can't get anywhere because every time they dig a metre they find like something else that need to be excavate
S0382	something beautiful
S0382	oh excavate yeah that's something i have no idea when this be
S0326	i learn about sort of why everything end up in constantinople because because it be found as a christian city all the sort of old the reason why certain emperors didn't take statues out of certain sit be cos it would be sort of against the you know
S0382	who didn't take them out
S0326	well you know nero would do what he want but he's not gonna take the cult statue of zeus out of olympia
S0382	no
S0326	because er
S0382	that's true that's true
S0326	but when you constantine's do it he can take whatever he want cos he doesn't believe in it
S0382	he doesn't believe in it that's true
S0326	so everything go to constantinople
S0382	right and what happen to it after that
S0326	they well then it sort of just like they put it up there they have so many war and
S0382	yeah what yeah er those cities
S0326	half of it
S0382	those
S0326	half of it probably get turn into cannonballs
S0382	oh
S0382	those cities in in asia minor like ephesus be just vast rich and i can't see a date here i mean it could be like it could be like really old no rough guide haven't be go that long
S0326	how can it not have a date it's such
S0382	i can't find it it's it's not good they all should always be very clear i'm just blank i'm really surprise it's not by my bedside just
S0326	i think they always have to have like
S0382	yeah i think they do i'm mystify maybe they maybe they don't cos they don't want they want people to buy it think it's the latest one even though it isn't
S0326	doesn't even have a sort of isbn number

S0382	yeah i do yeah mm i can't believe i've break my the first time must've drop something heavy down
S0381	oh be that oh oh
S0382	fall apart here no no no it's too weird
S0382	so
S0381	mm
S0382	he just send me a paper
S0381	that he write
S0382	he's just write it about why things like believe that all be one or or believe in panpsychism make people feel good so
S0381	oh
S0381	well why do he think it make people feel good
S0381	i don't see why panpsychism be gonna make people feel good
S0382	no nor do i really but
S0381	i can see why believe all be one that might seem like
S0382	i don't think it make me feel better
S0381	peaceful or
S0382	and i don't really
S0381	unity there's a like everything
S0382	well it
S0382	there's this classic paper call positive illusions and it just prove that if people have certain about themselves or
S0382	be happier and but i just think if you you have to go for the truth and accept to be less happy
S0381	yeah
S0382	my belief
S0381	i know
S0326	but that's that thing in the you remember that bite in the matrix erm
S0382	oh
S0326	it's not in the first one it's in the i think it's the second or third one when they're try to get that guy to come back and
S0381	oh yeah and he's
S0326	he's eat the steak
S0381	yeah
S0326	and he's like
S0326	i don't care that it's not real
S0381	yeah
S0326	just make me forget
S0381	mm
S0382	oh yeah
S0326	you see i don't care that it's not real
S0381	yeah cos it's really interest because there's be sort of a change in er that's a classic think experiment in philosophy and that's erm be do for decades and it use to be that all the students want to know the truth they they didn't want to
S0326	yeah
S0381	just live in the
S0382	oh my god
S0381	and now it's change and they're start to think
S0382	virtual reality
S0381	yeah no i'm happy to be in the
S0381	in the illusion
S0382	well there's also this paper do i ever send it to you it's like very short which argue that it's almost certainly true that we're live in a simulation by run be run by alien or
S0382	it's much more likely
S0382	than anything else
S0381	oh
S0382	no there
S0381	kind of a fuck up simulation
S0382	jonathan glover do
S0382	jonathan yeah exactly
S0326	why do they have to make it so fuck up then
S0381	i dunno
S0382	well
S0326	it like beggar belief how fuck up it be er so it's hard to
S0381	yeah
S0382	well
S0326	it can't like be wilfully design like that
S0381	well maybe there be some maybe there's some
S0382	no he could've just put in a lot of
S0381	parameters and then
S0382	a lot of initial condition
S0381	yeah
S0382	and then he just let the whole thing run
S0381	yeah
S0382	there be these
S0326	he he
S0381	yeah
S0382	that's what you know dawkins use to do with these evolution program you just put in a very few very simples rule and you watch how they evolve prefix yeah so glover have this version where a whole family decide to go on the
S0381	oh yeah
S0382	experience machine
S0381	yeah
S0382	and it's all like integrate so they all live with each other they're real
S0381	yeah
S0382	and they're live a coherent life and then on the machine they just er the the parent decide to have twin so they have twin in the fantasy world and the twin everything go on and the twin be four or five and then they think i think we should go back to the real world now and then they realise the twin won't aren't real so there's this terrible dilemma
S0326	there be that
S0381	that's quite a good twist
S0326	they do that in a film what's that film erm like one of those it's like one of those actors it's like a british film that have all those actors that be always in those british film
S0382	what you mean
S0381	the five british actors
S0382	you mean the sort of four weddings and a funeral people
S0326	yeah well this be i think it's like mike something or
S0382	mike something michael caine
S0326	no he's like oh what be
S0382	mm
S0326	what's it call
S0382	not the not the what's be it inception
S0381	mm
S0382	where they keep dissolve on the
S0381	yeah but it's not that one
S0326	it's like when this guy
S0382	do you know what he's talk about
S0326	this guy the dad
S0381	mm
S0326	he really like charles dickens or whatever and er he's be able to sort of go back in time in his life and then he get to give his power to his son
S0381	no
S0326	but then er yeah something to do with him have a kid and i think he he go and fix something and he he go back to the present day and his kid's not like a little boy anymore it's a little girl or something cos he do something different
S0381	he's change it yeah
S0382	that's better than so er have i ever ask you if you have the if you have the option for time travel but you can't
S0381	mm
S0382	come within a hundred years of your own time would you go would you be more interest in go forward or back
S0326	er back probably
S0382	me too there be so many things i know about that i'd like to see what they really be erm also i don't think i doubt i'm not sure we'll last another hundred years
S0381	oh that be bullshit
S0382	no it's not bullshit
S0381	but that be not why you don't wanna go forward a hundred years
S0382	no it isn't
S0381	that's just some other little
S0326	like
S0381	thing you're go on
S0326	well it's all fuck over and that's it
S0382	i be just try to give people an i be just try to give a kind of killer argument
S0326	but i think it depend how it work cos like life would be really like it's not really gonna be that fun to like

S0326	i find out a way to get a good way to make money next january
S0381	how
S0326	it's erm they have
S0326	this sale cambridge university press they can't i guess they can't afford to employ someone to check book for damage when they fall off the forklift in the warehouse or something
S0382	mm
S0326	so every time a book a box of book fall off a forklift they sort of put them to one side mark them stamp them say damage and then sell them in a sale where paperbacks be three pound and hardbacks be seven pound
S0381	jesus
S0326	but some of those books'd cost like eighty quid
S0381	yeah
S0326	and the most of them be in perfect condition they're just
S0382	mm so what's the
S0326	you go there you go there and you buy a bunch of book and you put them on ebay or i mean on amazon
S0381	yeah
S0382	amazon yeah and what you have to do be
S0381	amazon's
S0382	er undercut

S0382	oh bite of meatball in my
S0326	and she's on the battle wall sort of and all the old men be just say oh she's pretty and then she tell them who be who
S0382	well i know but she's like watch the
S0326	well yeah she's i mean it's quite interest cos she be in the
S0382	bite like
S0326	when she er when you meet her she's weave the she's weave the story of the trojan war she's a quite interest metapoetic figure cos she's do the sort of she have a sort of she's she's a central figure of the war but she's also detach like an detach observer she's
S0382	cool
S0326	something like a poet
S0382	she be the cause of the war
S0381	yeah
S0326	that's
S0382	mm
S0326	that's
S0382	well
S0326	see that's what the the essay's about sort of be she
S0382	oh i see
S0326	i mean er or be it's cos the it's not it's complicate because for the greeks they can't
S0382	she love
S0326	they can't be the she can't really be er cause responsible
S0382	no no
S0326	cos then she's not worth it

S0382	ah i buy them both i buy one anne oh you which one here
S0326	yeah these be all
S0382	oh yes yes yes yes i mean there's so much it's like dope
S0381	erm
S0382	oh you you didn't offer it to
S0326	i'm alright though i'm full
S0381	he doesn't want any
S0382	he's alright
S0382	i know
S0381	again
S0382	he live in it's much posher than here
S0382	it's amaze isn't it with
S0326	yeah
S0382	well be kind of cripple in the i mean i don't really want it to get better but it's because be so close high street er high street have the wholefoods the pizza express
S0326	i know it's weird because er
S0382	the waitrose
S0326	it's not it's
S0382	the mark and spencer's
S0326	there's a
S0382	what have we get lidl
S0326	yeah but it's you've get a pret a manger
S0382	what
S0381	we've get what
S0326	you've get a pret a manger
S0382	chicken cottage
S0381	what
S0382	we get one that's our in the
S0326	yeah but there's no pret a mangers in the whole of
S0382	have they be resist
S0326	well i dunno it's just the sort of thing you don't find
S0382	and be that be that a source of pride
S0326	no not really but you don't it's the difference between like you don't
S0382	yeah we've get a
S0326	find them there
S0382	have we get a pret a manger or just a costa
S0326	no er you've get a pret a manger on erm high street
S0382	okay so that so that's
S0381	what do that mean
S0382	pret a manger
S0381	cos we've get all the crappy
S0382	ready to eat it mean it's the one
S0381	i mean i take it
S0382	it's the one slightly more upscale than
S0381	oh
S0381	oh
S0382	pizza express try but then
S0326	but you only have to walk for two minutes
S0382	i know but that's the point that's why be go to be preserve because
S0381	it's like in a bubble
S0326	high street's too close cos er
S0381	and then once you've pass you get to and then that's all nice
S0382	exactly so there be just isn't
S0381	so our whole area will continue to stay crappy preserve as
S0382	well we like it
S0381	a crappy
S0326	that doesn't really make sense because basically as it get more expensive people will just move to cos it's a little bite cheaper
S0382	well that's true but then will they need to build another
S0381	it's not cheap though
S0382	market
S0326	yeah i know it's not cheap
S0381	no
S0326	but it's not you know it's
S0382	no but it's very
S0326	cheaper than
S0381	mm
S0382	but i think it have more council house so it have a really strong base
S0326	yeah but that's all gonna that's like in the those council house a lot of them be sort of in private hand erm anyway
S0382	oh well i
S0382	i don't think but these big estates they're that's not happen i don't think
S0381	they should demolish them well i like
S0382	well
S0381	the one over there that the nice big one
S0382	they're not the worst by any mean
S0381	but be they
S0326	but where be everyone mean to live
S0381	i just think they should build a prettier one
S0326	but they do that they basically they what they do all er they're do all over london be they say they're do that and then they can't get people can't get back into them
S0381	oh
S0326	and they get ship out and er it's
S0381	yeah
S0382	but you and well we've talk we've probably talk about the lovely kind of
S0381	oh that's a bummer
S0382	do you know about that
S0326	what thing
S0382	that new build right by the
S0326	oh yeah that's erm yeah yeah
S0382	oh i saw a
S0381	that's that's
