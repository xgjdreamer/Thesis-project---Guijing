S0013	the weekend
S0008	and it didn't work
S0012	didn't work
S0013	mm
S0008	mm yeah but then
S0013	so i don't know whether
S0008	this sort of cheap stuff be always a bite of a gamble
S0013	yeah
S0008	whether that work or not isn't it
S0012	yeah it be innit yeah that be yeah
S0013	i don't know whether to take it back and see what they say or
S0008	mm that's like
S0013	mm
S0008	er do i tell you i buy a new computer for christmas
S0012	no
S0013	oh
S0008	i'm sure i do have your memory go
S0012	probably probably
S0008	but it be a refurbish one
S0012	oh yes you tell me yeah no it's all tick in now
S0008	and er yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	but it be a you know get a
S0012	yeah
S0008	good performance and
S0012	yeah
S0008	stuff and of course when you know i be sort of load up all of these program on get go and make sure it's work alright you know register the number and all this sort of stuff
S0013	mm
S0008	and the hard drive be graunching away do i tell you that
S0012	yes you do yeah
S0008	and it be sort of like graunching and thing stop and then graunching and you sort of i sort of think well it will probably work alright it'll probably be fine but it's graunching
S0012	yeah
S0008	or i could get a new hard drive for it
S0012	you could yeah
S0008	and you see then
S0013	yeah
S0008	but then it's er rather give over the point of get a second
S0012	yeah
S0008	a refurbish cheap computer
S0013	yeah
S0008	when you've get to start spend money on it
S0012	money on it yeah
S0008	and then you're like in the end otherwise hardly i i don't want the problem about the hard drive sort of suddenly give up the ghost and then i've get to recover all 's stuff off it
S0013	no
S0008	and er so i've buy a new hard drive for it which cost set me back forty quid
S0012	yeah
S0008	i mean for a five you know half a terabyte you know
S0012	half a yeah i know
S0008	cos like you know you sort of think
S0013	mm
S0008	you could but the the terabyte ones be be cheaper than the half terabyte ones
S0012	yeah why be that
S0008	well because
S0013	mm
S0012	i notice that
S0008	modern
S0012	you know
S0008	cos er you know er in when i buy it they be the terabytes be quite a little bite more expensive you know a couple of quid
S0012	yeah
S0008	so i think well i don't need i'll just go for the
S0012	you don't need the bigger and you
S0013	yeah
S0008	and cos at the moment they only have a two hundred and fifty in you see
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then today i look and i the one terabyte ones the seagate barracudas right
S0012	yeah
S0008	i mean they're only about forty quid now
S0012	wow
S0008	it's incredible innit
S0013	yeah
S0012	that be innit
S0008	and
S0012	that's like i've tell you our first er well one of our computers be an ibm that be four
S0008	mm
S0012	four gigabytes and
S0013	mm
S0012	when we buy that the bloke say you will never need
S0012	any more memory than
S0008	yeah
S0012	thirty two megabyte memory
S0008	uhu
S0012	and four gigabyte hard drive you will need anything
S0008	yeah
S0012	more than that he say so that be
S0008	this be like
S0012	future and
S0013	yeah
S0008	this be salesman's pitch isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0008	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	future proof and and oh god
S0008	but anyway i've buy this also i buy for about fifteen quid this this er dock gizmo
S0012	oh right yeah
S0008	so i just stick that in and and clone the drive bang it in bang the way it go
S0012	do it good
S0008	really successful
S0012	right
S0013	yeah
S0008	but the funny thing be be that the old hard drive which i take out be half the weight and size of the new one i put in
S0012	oh
S0008	incredible innit
S0012	it be isn't it yeah yeah
S0008	you know sort of how these how these things come on
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos you can get these ultra slim hard drive
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know the things they put in these ultra slim er
S0012	yeah
S0008	laptops
S0012	laptops yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	laptops they have the
S0008	and they have like you know the terabyte stuff on them
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	that's a
S0012	how do they do it
S0008	dunno
S0013	yeah
S0012	it's
S0008	cos i be think of put a put a erm what they call a hybrid drive in
S0012	oh right
S0008	which you know the first half be solid state
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then the main bite be so it's like have the solid state and a thing all in one
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	but that would have be an extra twenty quid and i don't want to
S0012	oh right
S0008	i'll save that for do mine
S0013	mm
S0012	i remember when when we first have one i come up yours and we put in that norton thing didn't we
S0008	mm
S0012	and these little like that that be put er all the file in one place weren't it
S0008	yeah
S0012	and that be go along and we sit there watch it be mesmerise weren't it
S0008	yeah
S0012	watch this thing work
S0008	well it's like in the early days when you use to pay spider
S0012	yeah that's it
S0008	the card would go
S0012	ding ding chink
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0012	yes that's right
S0008	and now they go
S0012	yeah

S0012	yeah
S0008	you know he should have a nature blog
S0012	yeah

S0012	it's fantastic innit
S0008	i be sort of try to explain
S0013	yeah
S0012	to that you know even if no one look it wouldn't be waste
S0012	no
S0013	no
S0008	but i think he's get something in the back of his head that
S0012	yeah
S0008	he want
S0013	mm
S0008	to be able to do like be able to do it on his website
S0012	well he can do it but he's get to have the he's get to have the software to be able to
S0008	well i
S0012	load it up
S0008	but i still use that old dreamweaver that you give me
S0012	yeah
S0008	years ago
S0012	yeah yeah yeah that's good enough yeah
S0008	it seem to work but anyway what i be gonna say be i've be mess around with 's website
S0012	yeah
S0008	and now i've get a bookmark link on my bookmarks right
S0012	oh right yeah
S0008	so when i click 's website almost instantly i get this page come up this be reset the you know the server settings be reset do this please try again i click the try again and it come up
S0012	oh right
S0008	so what's that any idea
S0012	and you'll your yeah i haven't get any idea about it but i've have that as well
S0008	yeah
S0012	and er sometimes the server be down
S0008	yeah but this have happen over in the last two or three weeks and i keep check it and
S0012	yeah
S0008	always come up it's it's right what you say sometimes the server's down or sometimes
S0013	mm
S0008	the server be
S0013	we get that on other sit don't we
S0012	be update
S0008	be update
S0012	yeah
S0008	but it never happen before i start mess around with it
S0012	oh
S0008	and another thing i want to ask you you know when you it give you your file
S0012	yeah the one the website yeah
S0008	your file right
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	what's the www folder for
S0012	well you've get one haven't you you've put one you make it do you
S0008	i don't know cos the thing the only as far i'm i can see the only one which be actually work be public
S0012	er
S0008	html
S0012	yeah so have you click on your ww folder
S0008	yeah and it's full of everything it's like a a a complete copy of the public htm
S0012	that's it yeah
S0008	cos what happen be be that i think that be
S0012	i think that's the backup folder which
S0008	i'd forget which be how to do it right
S0012	yeah
S0008	so when i renew these file i stick them in the www right and then nothing be happen
S0012	oh right yeah
S0008	and then but it weren't no it wasn't nothing would happen i forget that it it wasn't work properly you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then i suddenly sort of start look it up and oh public that's the one you want
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then do them all in the public
S0012	well i make a www folder so that
S0008	mm
S0012	i could upload it when i want but that's completely useless
S0008	it doesn't do anything
S0012	it doesn't do anything
S0008	mm
S0012	and i tell you i'm get rid of it but it think well
S0008	well i don't wanna get rid of it in case it do start
S0012	if i
S0013	yeah
S0012	if i get rid of it
S0008	yeah
S0012	you can put it in another place and if that don't work then
S0008	mm
S0012	you can bring it back can't you you don't put it in the in the well you can put it
S0013	mm
S0012	you can put it in the in the bin and then restore it if it don't work
S0008	mm
S0012	but i get one exactly the same ww folder and i think
S0008	yeah
S0012	well do i make that one
S0008	but i be look on this sort of you know the sort of what be
S0012	yeah
S0008	blah blah blah and er it say something about your web load from your public html
S0012	yeah
S0008	or your www
S0012	so that might be a backup
S0008	i don't know i didn't know whether it be something to do with the fact that cos when i first start do this i'd put i be put the folders everywhere
S0012	yeah
S0008	and i'm now i dunno which ones be
S0012	that's right
S0008	be valid cos you've get
S0013	yeah
S0008	you know on your on your remote folders you've get all these vti folders
S0012	that's it
S0008	a whole list of them
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you think what do they do you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	and what be all these other folders and stuff and you think oh
S0012	well indeed no i think well i be work on site and i think well i've get all this stuff on my computer
S0008	mm
S0012	i don't really want it get rid get rid get rid get rid rid rid rid rid go to have a look at it again on you know cos you can click on
S0008	mm
S0012	on your not
S0008	yeah
S0012	on your internet but not on
S0008	yeah
S0012	live nothing there
S0008	and you get rid of the wrong ones
S0012	oh god
S0012	i can't upload them any more so i have to download from the remote folder back down
S0008	uhu
S0012	into my local folder
S0008	but that's the the whole point of the isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0008	the get put like
S0012	that's right yeah yeah you can
S0008	but i don't know how like i've get on on on on the my computer i've get a folder call 's web
S0012	yeah
S0008	and that's get everything in it
S0012	yeah
S0008	and it's you know all all the folders they're all interlink and everything you everything the website need
S0012	yeah
S0008	right well theoretically cos once you get you know your site 's web and
S0012	yeah
S0008	your folder come up theoretically you could put that all
S0012	all on
S0008	into public html
S0012	you could yeah
S0008	but i dunno how do you can't cos there ain't a sort of select all be there and if you just try and you click the folder and put it over the just the folder go over doesn't it it's
S0012	yeah you can go on into your c drive
S0008	mm
S0012	right and look at your properties in the c drive
S0008	mm
S0012	and copy that folder and put it look for your web folders
S0008	mm
S0012	and put it in there and that'll work
S0008	what just drag and drop it
S0012	yeah well you'd need to
S0008	once you load it up
S0012	you'd need to drag yeah
S0008	yeah er yeah i know you can drag and drop it but in your c drive
S0012	you you'll go
S0008	that's what i'm say it's already put there now
S0012	oh
S0008	you know cos that's 's web be in the
S0012	yeah
S0008	c drive
S0012	that's in your c drive
S0008	and but
S0012	it's not on your desktop or anything like that
S0008	no no no it come you know when you on dreamweaver you get your what do they call them one be remote folder
S0012	that's it
S0008	which be on the
S0012	and local folder
S0008	local folders and it come up it show you
S0012	yeah
S0008	it's 's web local
S0012	yeah
S0008	folders so like two screen 's web and
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	right
S0012	yeah
S0008	but i don't you know it's cos to make it all
S0012	right
S0008	you know if you change everything
S0012	yeah
S0008	you you could put everything across all at once
S0012	you could yeah
S0008	but i dunno how that work
S0012	well
S0008	i think all it's er
S0012	the main thing about the the er your folder when you when you open it up on the net when you're when you're actually on the net
S0008	mm
S0012	you're open up either er the index file which be the most important one or someone we'll call another name oh i can't think of it i'll go and have a look in a minute and they're the two important file which will open up
S0008	mm
S0012	all the rest of the file
S0008	yeah but the index be the one that it look for isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0008	be the most important
S0012	yeah and then everything will work
S0008	mm
S0012	from that index file
S0008	but i still can't understand why when i try and link on it it come up with this server be not connect
S0012	weird
S0008	it be weird and i be think that perhaps it's something to do with the link on my computer right
S0012	yeah
S0008	or maybe link to this server be not but i'm not i don't know
S0012	oh i don't think
S0008	maybe the i might have a look in a minute and
S0012	yeah
S0008	see if it how it link to you know google or something
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	yeah be you still do erm
S0012	i'm just go to the loo
S0008	fabric picture
S0013	mm
S0012	no yes no
S0013	i should be yeah
S0012	yes she be
S0008	cos i've still get load of this material right
S0013	oh right yeah oh i'm always

S0008	they be build house everywhere
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er but since then it's be it's be a bite stagnant
S0012	but i mean when they're when they're allow to build house everywhere they usually like er we get some down down the bottom in they usually fiddle it somehow because them they build they have plan for be it thirty eight house
S0013	i don't know i can't remember
S0012	and they they put in forty one
S0008	mm
S0012	and because they put in forty one house they have to squeeze up the footpath
S0008	oh right
S0012	wide
S0008	yeah
S0012	so there's no
S0008	but sometimes they do that and they don't tell anyone and no one notice
S0012	no
S0013	no this be what it happen
S0008	yeah
S0012	this this be what happen yeah
S0013	no one know
S0008	yeah
S0012	no one that it happen
S0013	no one actually go oh one two three four
S0008	yeah
S0012	so all the
S0013	you've get too many
S0012	down there
S0012	have get to cross the road to be able to push a pram or a pushchair
S0008	yeah
S0012	or take kid for a walk cos you the footpath be literally
S0008	mm
S0012	eighteen inch wide at the very most
S0012	you know
S0008	yeah well
S0013	and none of the garage you can't get a car in can you
S0012	no none of the garage
S0013	you can't
S0012	can get a car in
S0013	you can't get out with the car
S0008	who park in a garage though that's what they say
S0012	well that's right
S0008	don't they
S0012	yeah who park in garage
S0013	yeah
S0008	and while cars be get bigger
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	but if you get the car in the garage
S0012	if you get the car in they they get
S0013	you can't get out the door
S0012	this up
S0008	yeah yeah
S0012	so you drive in you can't get out the door
S0013	oh dear
S0008	but there's yeah well i mean it's like how they reduce the size of the room
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they reckon britain be sort of below european standards
S0012	standards
S0008	on the amount of
S0013	yeah
S0008	live space
S0012	live space yeah
S0008	in our house
S0012	yeah
S0013	but then
S0008	cos the room be so small
S0012	well when you go into some of the kitchens
S0013	then like they've be knock the wall out like the
S0012	yeah
S0013	the kitchen diner's
S0008	mm
S0013	huge
S0012	you go into a kitchen and i mean you even see it on the on the television on home under the hammer and place like that you see the kitchen have well he she she do she say look i can touch each side of the wall you know both side
S0013	mm
S0012	and she's just like that
S0008	mm
S0012	and you get the the sink the cooker
S0013	yeah
S0012	and no room for anything else
S0008	well my sister live in a house in which be a private house
S0012	yeah
S0008	and but it be sort of like one of these sort of mass produce type things and there be sort of the terrace and it wasn't very old but her kitchen be like that
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know there be just enough room to walk between the the two you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	the the units and you could just about turn round
S0012	but two people wouldn't work in it
S0008	and some of these fat people wouldn't get in there
S0012	no that's true
S0008	and like like you say you could probably touch the wall both side
S0012	yeah and that be allow
S0008	but the
S0012	obviously
S0008	funny thing be be that all these new house that they build like that you know they the advert still show a kitchen this big don't they
S0012	they do yeah
S0008	you know
S0012	they do yeah
S0008	you know it's like this sort of like this standard kitchen
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	in in in any old little house
S0012	but if they want to build these
S0013	but it's get to be camerawork hasn't it most of it
S0012	yeah that be camera work
S0013	it have
S0012	they use these wide angle lenses
S0013	but everywhere be so big isn't it
S0012	don't they as well
S0008	yeah
S0012	cos you can see the wide anglican lenses
S0008	mm
S0012	that bend the doors
S0008	mm
S0012	like that and bend the wall but
S0008	mm
S0012	if i don't think that any house builder have learn anything more than they do in in the twenties and thirties when they be build house like it because if if you take into account a caravan builder people who build caravan if they want to build a smaller house they should fit it like a caravan be fit
S0008	mm
S0013	yeah
S0008	yeah that's right
S0013	yeah
S0008	i know yeah i dunno i can't understand the house they're put up
S0012	i mean it's these these wonderful new caravan they're so fantastic
S0008	they be
S0012	i mean these cupboards come down from everywhere and
S0008	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	and you can
S0008	and they just fold out
S0012	fold out this and fold out that
S0013	well
S0012	surely if they want to build flats they could build
S0008	mm
S0012	flats exactly the same as that can't they caravan standard flats
S0012	or stick caravan
S0008	well
S0012	on top of one another
S0008	or build a house
S0013	well they do do those pod don't they that actually
S0012	oh they do them pod
S0008	they do yeah
S0012	yeah
S0013	that they actually transport the whole
S0012	yeah
S0013	a whole house
S0008	oh right
S0013	and just stick it on top of one another
S0008	yeah well i reckon that erm premier inns do that with their bathrooms
S0012	with the yes
S0008	you know they just like
S0013	oh right
S0008	cos they're all sort of like a unit aren't they

S0008	i'll just survive as i be before
S0012	that's how i feel cor that's a nice chocolate innit

S0008	mm
S0012	all the time drive right up behind you and you're do thirty and you think
S0008	well i don't understand lorries cos they have they're suppose to have a tachometer aren't they
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	which be suppose to record their speed and that so how come on the motorways they're all do
S0012	seventy mile an hour
S0008	seventy five
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah yeah
S0008	you know
S0012	and i suppose they get fifty on them haven't they on
S0008	have they
S0012	on the back
S0008	i think it's sixty
S0013	don't think they have any
S0008	i think i don't think they're suppose to do more than sixty but they definitely aren't suppose to do seventy
S0012	no they're not
S0013	mm
S0012	but on on the back of most of these lorries there there be er how be i drive

S0008	but i mean they wouldn't get anywhere
S0012	sixty kilometres
S0008	if they be do fifty would they
S0012	no they wouldn't no
S0008	i mean it be ridiculous i mean there's no reason why they shouldn't do sixty five on the motorway
S0012	and yeah that's true
S0013	mm
S0012	and there's no reason why they shouldn't just have that one lane for them
S0008	mm that's right
S0012	the lorry lane if you like
S0008	and there be
S0013	yeah if they didn't keep weave in and out

S0008	and then eventually he'd go oh and he'd get on and scrabble up
S0012	we watch it
S0008	and then i'd go and cut that branch off and see what he do next
S0008	and he'd go down that branch again and he you'd see he couldn't get down and then he'd sort of like hop on another branch
S0013	yeah
S0008	and that branch would sort of like come up and he'd go along the edge the you know the thinnest bite of wood you'd ever imagine
S0012	yeah
