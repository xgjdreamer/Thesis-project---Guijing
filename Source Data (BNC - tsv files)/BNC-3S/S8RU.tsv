S0538	that when become a solicitor they obviously know erm they would know him you see
S0537	mm
S0538	from years go by and connections those sort of connections
S0537	mm
S0538	so he be probably it's probably he be probably 's solicitor
S0537	mm i didn't know that erm 's sons be involve up there though
S0538	
S0538	well it sound like 's sons have take over the whole thing
S0537	yeah
S0538	but will be get on a bite now he'll be in his sixties
S0537	yeah
S0538	and it's far too much to have to do three milk three hundred cow night and day
S0537	mm
S0538	when you've get three young sons
S0537	mm
S0538	who be keen
S0537	mm
S0538	obviously they're go to take it over
S0537	they well they need to expand don't they there's not enough farm for three of them
S0538	no but they've a big contract business
S0537	do they
S0538	yeah
S0537	mm
S0538	they do a
S0538	do a heck of a lot of contract beside farm
S0537	mm i didn't know
S0538	so there'll be plenty of work for
S0537	well there will but they're always race around in summer aren't they i must say
S0538	plenty of work for three of them
S0537	on big machinery
S0538	with quite a sizeable farm plus a big contract business i'm sure there's work for three of them
S0537	mm
S0538	well in fact there must be more than work for three of them because they do i think they employ
S0537	do they
S0538	down there as well
S0537	wonder if that where they've extend the farmhouse if that's a sort of a separate unit
S0538	well well probably one of their sons
S0537	yeah cos they
S0538	they'll have three house then
S0537	yeah
S0538	it'll be three house
S0537	and three parent and three sons
S0538	well we're still one short for a son
S0537	we're still one short true
S0538	at at some at some stage
S0537	mm mind you we don't
S0538	we'll have to find another
S0537	with all that development up at 's i suppose they'll get one of those won't they
S0538	there's possibilities
S0537	probably be handy new build
S0538	it's a possibility
S0537	mm
S0538	i mean i don't know what whether or if any well i think one must be marry the 's sons
S0537	mm mm
S0538	's son er because that's already occupy with a young child of in this end that they do first the end that they develop first
S0537	oh you think they've get one they've get a child
S0538	now whether the other one whether one of the others have be marry and
S0537	mm
S0538	and they're develop the other end of it they be develop the other end but whether it's for him or not i don't know for for one of them
S0537	mm
S0538	i don't know them that well but er anyway they seem to be do quite well down there
S0537	they do don't they they've make more of it than you would've expect really i think
S0538	well yeah they've it's not an ideal farm but er i suppose if you've get quite a lot of 's land now
S0537	mm
S0538	which go with it and if there be two hundred acres there
S0537	yeah
S0538	plus their own
S0537	mm
S0538	they obviously have quite a bite of land to go at
S0537	mm
S0538	that will help them and they just don't let the cattle the the milk cow out anymore they just zero graze zero graze the cow
S0537	they zero graze them all
S0538	the milk cow be all zero graze
S0537	oh it's a shame isn't it
S0538	they like it better that way
S0537	oh i think it's er it's well it's a shame when they don't go out in the field at all
S0538	they don't get lanes yeah they're all hobble about in
S0537	i wonder what i why i be i's never be cow on that on that lane anymore
S0538	they don't get
S0538	they don't get er lame in the feet the same mucky gateways and things like that they erm they're much better in indoors milk cattle be be prove beyond doubt
S0537	no but they can't enjoy it as much
S0538	they do enjoy it more it's under
S0538	they're under cover they they can walk around they're not tie up
S0537	yeah but in summer they'd prefer to be out it can be hot and stuffy and horrible
S0538	well i think
S0537	surely
S0538	but i think probably when they're in calf for a period
S0537	mm
S0538	they'll probably take them take them out onto some of the the higher grind that isn't as wet
S0537	mm
S0538	and they probably have a er a month or two where they where they graze out but the bulk of the time er they're indoors
S0537	mm
S0538	zero graze
S0537	mm
S0538	everything's cart to them to the head
S0537	yeah but i didn't like any of the christmas tree down there
S0538	no
S0537	they're a bite say they be scratty weren't they they be scratty tree
S0538	yeah they're not
S0537	they really be
S0538	i don't think really suitable
S0537	i think we might look at
S0538	we've be spoil
S0539	mm
S0537	i think we might look at an artificial i think we might look at an artificial one this time
S0539	no i like a real tree
S0538	an artificial one be be the most sensible thing to do
S0539	there's nothing like a real tree though be there
S0537	i know but it's the heat floor they don't survive
S0538	yeah and it just take nine months to get all rid of all the blink needle that fall from them take twelve months to clean up after it it just isn't worth it and that and these some of these er artificial tree be very very real look
S0537	well there's
S0538	and they're very good
S0537	mm
S0538	they're very good now
S0537	mm
S0538	they use to be bite of a excuse for a tree but they're they're not anymore they're very good the trouble be it's a bite expensive we've just er we'll be find a nice second hand one
S0537	i don't think so
S0538	but it's not the really the right time of year to be find it
S0537	no i don't no it's not er
S0538	easter might be better
S0537	no we're definitely not get a second hand one
S0538	perhaps we should wait till easter and put the tree up then
S0537	no
S0538	we shall might find a
S0537	we're not we're
S0538	a bargain
S0537	we're not have a second hand one i can tell you no
S0538	doesn't matter do it
S0537	yes of course it well the new ones be much so much better those feel feel real ones they do look really realistic you know
S0537	and at least the needle
S0537	mm
S0538	really good one second hand
S0537	no
S0538	would be ideal
S0537	definitely not
S0538	well mm that's my take on it
S0537	there's somebody there's somebody come up from as far away as to sing at social club at christmas
S0539	goodness me
S0538	mm it's go to be on the map
S0537	gracious yeah

S0537	mm mm
S0538	a six months old a six month old baby er of their theirs who be now orphan i mean madness you can't get your head round it no sense nor reason to it
S0537	mm
S0538	it's just absolute madness it's like they get possess
S0537	mm
S0538	and i don't know i don't understand how you can actually fight someone that's get that sort of er mentality you don't you can't i think you can't see it you can't it's not a war as such it's it's personal independent people just jump up and just go create mayhem
S0537	well they're not independent
S0538	if they start do that in america it's go to be very simple because they're right gung ho over there there's no problem get gun in america it might be more difficult here but in america it's not there's no problem get gun
S0537	mm
S0538	there's gun and bomb and all sort of of er
S0537	well i'm sure anybody would
S0538	kill machine in america that be available to the the general public
S0537	i'm sure anybody who really want a gun can get one here
S0538	yeah but it's
S0537	obviously
S0538	the harder you make it the better it's america it's just simple
S0537	mm plenty of bomb around here anyway aren't there
S0538	just go just go down the high street and buy yourself a gun and off you go
S0537	it's easy
S0538	you can't here
S0537	easy enough to make bomb here isn't it you can get all the
S0539	yeah definitely
S0537	mm
S0538	eh
S0537	easy enough to make bomb here
S0538	oh yeah i mean you can make bomb if you're
S0537	and now they can make those 3d gun can't they
S0539	i haven't hear about them
S0537	but i don't but i don't understand how that work but they can get erm instructions off a website on how to make a 3d gun you know make a 3d gun out of i don't know
S0538	well i don't know that sound a bite stupid to me
S0537	mm
S0538	yeah
S0539	what like a cardboard one a cardboard cut out
S0537	well no it won't be it it'll be a little bite heavier
S0538	no that's no good
S0537	it would be a bite apparently they can work they can make them like that off a sort of with these new 3d they have these new 3d things er
S0539	yeah like the print machine
S0537	yeah
S0539	yeah i don't
S0537	3d print machine somehow they can make one that will work but i don't understand it
S0538	it's an awful carry on anyway awful carry on
S0537	mm
S0538	i mean unless you're gonna hide yourself away erm if you're go to hide yourself away everybody's go to hide themselves away they they've actually win haven't they it's the end of er civilisation as we know it
S0537	yes but then again i think you've get to you've get to be aware of sort of likely hotspots haven't you when you're take children
S0538	well what like er a disability school
S0537	mm no well well no no
S0539	mm could happen anywhere
S0538	that's that's not exactly
S0537	but surely
S0538	that's not exactly a hotspot
S0537	i mean i cannot understand that at all
S0538	well that's what i mean it that's not exactly a hotspot
S0537	i cannot understand it
S0538	be a café a hotspot
S0537	well central paris you can understand a little bite more
S0538	you can understand big gather
S0538	you know football match and
S0537	mm
S0538	big stadiums of whatever
S0537	mm
S0538	but i mean if you're gonna er anywhere's a
S0537	mm
S0538	anywhere's a possibility the way they carry on er they just don't have any er i mean there's nobody nobody singularly er nobody particularly single out matter whether kid
S0537	well why do they pick on that school because he'd work there or what be it in the end
S0538	they're not bother who they pick on that's what i'm say
S0537	yes i know but i'm say do they do they simply just randomly pick on that school
S0538	well yeah they would know the layout and they think they could do a bite of mayhem there because they know their way around didn't they
S0537	or be one of them have one of them work there or
S0538	yeah
S0537	i haven't i haven't hear haven't read a lot about it
S0538	think so
S0538	it be his er
S0537	mm
S0538	yeah i think he do didn't he i think he work there but i mean it be easy access then wasn't it cos
S0537	yeah
S0538	the face fit
S0537	but but have he stop work there have he get the sack be there
S0538	no they'd be they'd be oh he wasn't he wasn't he wasn't exactly work there but he be involve in
S0537	be there some extra
S0538	he be involve in some sort of an institution that be connect to it
S0537	mm
S0538	and er through that he'd be invite to it so i think they'd put in an attendance they'd have an he'd have an argument with someone there
S0537	mm
S0538	and leave
S0537	mm
S0538	and then come back in all the armoury
S0537	mm
S0538	and then just willy nilly
S0538	start shoot everybody
S0537	disgust
S0539	mm
S0538	mm but i mean the intention
S0537	unbelievable
S0538	the intention of do something like that have obviously be there because they be all armour up and they'd get body armour and everything
S0537	they be ready to attack somewhere
S0538	yeah probably not that day but er that just spark it off
S0537	but that er just fuel
S0538	and er
S0537	that fuel it
S0538	that be that which be a terrible carry on
S0537	mm
S0538	but they've get to be god i don't know it's hard to it's hard to understand how you could be so merciless to i mean it's the first time of anything like this have ever happen i mean war be nasty i mean the the irish that be a nasty old time but
S0539	mm
S0537	yeah
S0538	the kill of a lot of innocent people but they be they it wasn't like as mental as this
S0537	mm
S0538	this be this be against all the western world er er er the rest of the world basically isn't it i mean it's even against it's even against a lot of their own kind it's even against a lot of muslims
S0537	mm
S0538	be this isis it's just a brutal organisation that somehow spring up where they seem to be able to recruit followers for it which be unbelievable really
S0537	although it's not i mean it's because it's face to face isn't it that make it more shock and it's not er you know it's face to face and they're kill people at very close range where but it's not that long since we be do that be it it's not that long since we do that in war
S0538	no but it's the reason for it it's the it's
S0537	i know it's the reaons for it as well
S0538	difficult to to find out what the reason for it be
S0537	but it it feel more brutal because it be face to face and and drop a bomb from an aeroplane doesn't feel as brutal
S0538	i think the only reason that
S0537	although the end result be i suppose
S0538	i think the only reason their their their excuse for be like they be er the sympathisers be the fact that you're bomb bomb innocent innocent er people in syria innocent people be be kill
S0537	mm mm
S0538	and they're lose hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people
S0537	thousands
S0538	through not not purposely but because of it so they think why shouldn't why shouldn't they create some mayhem and death here that's the only way i can think that they can think like they think
S0537	mm
S0538	cos er they're not bother who it be they kill as long as they're not their own but
S0537	but there be that what be the train camp in the lake district
S0538	i think that
S0537	they get on a farm that
S0538	i think that be that be
S0539	oh yeah well there be a big there be a big camp on this farmer's land
S0537	mm
S0539	and the police go round to have a look at it but they couldn't erm question anyone at that time because the laws be different but they ask the farmer about who these people be and the farmer say oh they're my taliban
S0539	and it turn out that they be involve in the nine eleven bomb
S0537	bomb yeah but they be they plan an attack on london from there
S0538	mm it be a train camp
S0539	yeah
S0538	mm
S0537	yeah it be a train camp
S0538	but that that be er they they be bad enough the taliban
S0537	mm
S0538	and al qaeda and all them but these be just a a league above them
S0537	mm be they be they worse
S0538	well yeah i mean this behead and just
S0537	oh
S0538	and i mean even even you know like pick on people that that be do charity work and that sort of thing and try to help and
S0537	i know
S0538	try to help the syrians go over with aid and all this sort of thing and then just
S0537	yeah
S0538	this capture them and behead them i mean
S0537	oh dreadful
S0538	it's just merciless it's just
S0537	mm
S0538	beggar belief
S0537	mm
S0538	so they're they're worse than they're the worse lot i mean the the whole bloody carry on be chaos isn't it cos there's that many factions of one another want to kill one another within that region or within those regions it's unbelievable
S0537	mm
S0538	i mean i don't know who's that's the problem you don't know who you're if you go over there to help you wouldn't know who the hell you be help
S0537	well i don't think you'd be in rush i don't think you'd be in a rush to go over there because
S0538	no but as a as a country go over to help another country
S0537	yeah
S0538	er like who do you who do you i mean that's the problem who be you back
S0537	yeah
S0538	you don't know who you're back erm i mean they're just say that er assad be basically as bad as isis so russia be help assad it's a mess and then there be other er er there be other factions that er be all fight against one another and can't possibly live with one another they're all involve in similar areas it's just it's just chaos that's religion for you absolutely barmy we're better off without it
S0537	well it's very sad that it's misuse in that way but it's very helpful to a lot of people isn't it
S0538	well it's
S0537	it's help a lot of people religion
S0538	it bloody kill a lot and all over the years hasn't it
S0537	but it's it's be misuse a lot too
S0538	well it have over the years
S0537	yeah
S0538	on the back of on the on the back of religion
S0537	mm
S0538	i i don't know how you can i i don't know how you can be say they're god fear and followers of god to create and and support that sort of that sort of carry on it's just just er it's just nonsense hypocritical nonsense horrible carry on
S0539	mm
S0538	and i would ban religion
S0537	well i don't think you can actually
S0538	that's the first thing to do
S0537	i don't think you can actually do that can you
S0538	ban all religion
S0537	religion's help a lot of people isn't it and there's all those erm study be do to show that people who be part of a religious group actually have better mental health than those who don't they er it have support and help a lot of people
S0538	well
S0537	it do do a lot of good i mean it's a big social thing in this village isn't it although i wouldn't say all the
S0538	it isn't a big social thing at all in this village it's virtually dead
S0537	well for for the for the churchgoers it be they have they have there's quite a few people go to go to the church
S0539	well there's more go to the church than the pub now i think
S0537	yeah well that's because of the landlord
S0538	well that's not say much be it
S0538	that's not say very much
S0537	yes if this landlord leave then we might have greater attendance
S0538	i think the pub would probably have a better chance of revival than the church actually if it get a decent landlord
S0537	mm mm
S0538	but i don't think it would happen the same if you get a decent vicar i think the church be basically finish
S0537	no there's you can load of people go to that church load of them they have all the different little group they stop invite me though they do
S0538	load of people don't go to that church
S0537	mm
S0538	and i don't see how you've
S0537	mm they do
S0538	they do not
S0537	yes there's plenty of people go to that church they've get the little group there there's er there's plenty go but you wouldn't mix with the people who go normally
S0538	why
S0537	well because of your attitudes towards it
S0537	i don't think they'd want to mix with you
S0537	but they're all people who be mm i think there's a lot there tend to be more women i think go than
S0539	yeah there do
S0537	than men and they have their little mothers' group don't they and
S0538	i don't know what they
S0537	they have the boys' group boys' brigade quite a few lads attend that
S0538	yeah i think that's be reasonably popular have boys' brigade
S0537	mm
S0538	but on the whole it wouldn't be a big loss wouldn't the church
S0537	mm
S0538	it certainly wouldn't for me anyhow
S0537	well it would to a lot of people in the village i or to some people in the village it would
S0538	yeah well i'm a i'm a great believer in live and let live but erm
S0537	yeah
S0538	but it's er overall
S0537	i mean
S0538	it's be a it's be a big cause of lot of problems over the centuries
S0537	i mean there be a there be a lot of hooha when the vicar stop christen children whose parent weren't regular churchgoers there be a lot of upset about that people still like to have the children christen there and they still like to get marry there but then there be the insistence come in that they have to be regular churchgoer to be able to use the church
S0538	well i suppose it be a bite hypocritical to want to have your
S0537	it be a bite but everybody's
S0538	child christen if you're not religious
S0537	yeah i could never understand people want to have their children christen when they didn't go to church but but then again you know it's tradition isn't it and see as a lot of people see it as a thing to do
S0538	well i suppose from the church's point of view if they do christen them there's no there's no reason to say that that child might not be be er be a religious sort of person when it grow up
S0537	no i think they
S0538	and they might take a dim view of the fact that they weren't allow to be christen
S0537	well they can be christen later i mean i think
S0538	well they can
S0537	i think they should make their own mind up when they're older really
S0538	well it's probably a better idea
S0537	mm but it's nice to get marry in your local church isn't it in many ways i think a lot of people prefer prefer that still
S0539	mm
S0538	see they're talk about knock religion out of school but er
S0537	mm
S0538	i think people should have a chance to form their own opinions about it but
S0537	mm
S0539	what they're not go to have religious study anymore
S0538	well i think er you know you can't have school be bias can you and you've get er to be able to
S0537	mm
S0539	no but the whole point of religious study be that you learn about all different kinds of religions
S0538	well that's that's okay if that's adopt that's sort of to to so that you know you're aware of all other sort of religions but
S0537	mm
S0538	but on the other hand you know school you're limit time for you've get a limit time in school for for teach kid i don't think too much of it want to be waste on teach religion but you see you start go to
S0537	well yeah
S0538	you start go to
S0537	yes but there's so many link aren't there
S0538	start go to christian school and they've open now they've open muslim school
S0537	yeah mm
S0538	they're not gonna start teach other other sort of religions
S0537	no
S0538	they're not gonna do it
S0537	i don't think so but we never know
S0538	they're not but they should be
S0537	mm
S0538	if you're gonna teach religion it should be all religions not just one
S0539	yeah mm
S0537	i know always say that with do his english degree that he do find that he miss a lot of the link or fail to pick up link to religion in erm english literature or other you know other areas when erm he didn't understand what the what the reference be to
S0538	mm
S0537	so he felt he'd miss out in that way although he do go to a church of england school and there be some discussion about religion there there obviously wasn't it didn't make up for him not attend church or sunday school so he felt he'd miss out in that way
S0538	well i can't ever remember be too much religion pump into us in my day
S0537	well that's because you didn't go to
S0538	i do go to school
S0537	you didn't go to sunday school when your father send you that's why
S0538	oh well i mean that's that's different i mean that it wasn't in school hours be it
S0537	mm
S0538	that's different i didn't prefer to go to that but there wasn't much religion teach at school there be some religion teach at school but there wasn't that much there wasn't that much of other type of religions talk about at school
S0537	do they
S0538	there wasn't much
S0537	no
S0538	about other religions
S0537	no
S0538	speak about at school
S0537	but you go to you'd go to church from your school would you at easter and christmas and things
S0538	well yeah you have a bite of church go and the vicar use to come to school
S0537	mm
S0538	because it be a church of england school
S0537	mm
S0538	but i don't believe in that you see because that that in effect be bias isn't it you're
S0537	mm
S0538	you know they're they're push their well they're push their own religion
S0537	mm
S0538	if you're gonna if you're gonna teach kid about religion you should teach them about all religions and then if they want to be be be religious
S0537	mm
S0538	it's their choice
S0537	absolutely
S0538	who they
S0537	as they grow older
S0538	who they go with preferably
S0537	mm
S0538	none
S0537	mm
S0538	my opinion but that's just my opinion
S0537	where do your mum and dad get marry do you know
S0538	probably here probably at
S0537	probably at yeah

S0539	no
S0537	seventy four
S0538	i've get to the age where i've forget my age
S0537	seventy four this year
S0538	which be only a pup these days i don't think
S0537	mm
S0538	i'll play football again this season though
S0537	no
S0538	i might well unless i go into defence
S0537	no golf tomorrow
S0538	there won't be any golf tomorrow
S0537	mm
S0539	why
S0538	lucky if you can stand on your feet tomorrow
S0537	weather warn it's er heavy rain and high wind
S0538	there's a big there's a big erm
S0539	oh great
S0537	not go anywhere tomorrow
S0538	there's a big storm come through
S0537	yeah
S0538	it have a name but i've forget it
S0537	have they name it now because they hadn't name it just a little while ago it wasn't name
S0538	and er in it's red alert
S0537	yeah
S0538	and in it's amber
S0537	ah
S0538	cos it give
S0537	red alert again
S0538	mm
S0539	what do red alert actually mean
S0537	oh very very high risk
S0538	well very dangerous eighty mile an hour wind and
S0537	but they've get heavy
S0538	they've already
S0537	the
S0538	have flood and
S0537	yeah they get heavy flood in already
S0538	mm
S0537	but the river be very high today wasn't it
S0538	where
S0537	you know the little where we when we've cross over the
S0538	that wasn't high it be low in fact
S0537	oh it wasn't low
S0538	it be
S0537	rubbish
S0538	it be halfway down the
S0537	it wasn't it wasn't
S0538	it be i just think it's how low it be for how much rain we've have
S0537	do you
S0538	yeah it be very low
S0537	oh i think it be quite high i think it be touch the top
S0538	no the be very low that be nowhere near
S0537	mm
S0538	no i be surprise how low it be really to be i'm not just say that
S0537	mm
S0538	but i be surprise how low the water be
S0537	mm
S0538	cos we have have a lot of rain but it it go up and down quite quickly nowadays like the river it's er it doesn't stop up like it use to do it's all the it's all the dredge to the estuaries and things that and the also the the leak off the contributories
S0537	mm
S0538	be so much quicker so it flood come up quick and go down quick
S0537	come it come down off the fell very quick doesn't it
S0538	yeah so it flood quick but it go quick
S0537	yeah
S0538	whereas it use to stop up a twice as long when
S0537	yeah
S0538	when i be younger remember them stop up and i remember stop up for like four or five days it would be out for four or five days but now you're one day and then er down the next
S0537	mm
S0538	so it isn't i suppose in some respect it's be a good thing as regard properties and things flood but it's a bad thing when you're talk about get fish into the rivers
S0537	yes it's do a lot of damage hasn't it it's do a lot of damage as well
S0538	you can't take three foot out of a river and expect it to maintain fish cos
S0537	no
S0538	it just doesn't work like that plus
S0537	mm
S0538	also pollution come into it cos you know you drop an egg cup of water into a into a cup as against a bucket there's a big difference isn't there
S0537	mm
S0538	so er
S0537	well still
S0538	overall it's a very bad thing
S0537	but they still have a lot of flood up in the west they're have a lot of flood up in the west in but there's nowhere to you know it's so flat up there isn't it
S0538	well you'll always get it on the plain won't you
S0537	mm but very bad
S0538	that you don't get more sort of in when you know cos that that's flat
S0537	well there's all the flood defences isn't there in
S0538	well there's stop
S0538	there's tidal defences but it's it's it must it cop
S0537	mm
S0538	it cop i don't know it cop all the way up the do it i mean we don't know whether it come out in the further up the
S0537	well there's some areas there's some there's some there's some areas that they've agree to flood that they shouldn't let flood aren't there
S0538	yeah but i don't think that's anything to do with the
S0537	but well there must be areas on the that they let flood
S0538	no
S0537	we'll have to look it up
S0538	i mean they've talk about areas like er you know and
S0537	mm
S0538	er
S0537	mm
S0538	but that's nothing to do with the
S0537	no
S0538	but i mean they they restore a lot of that land from flood in the first place
S0537	yeah
S0538	so it's not too difficult to
S0537	it's just go back
S0538	revert back to floodland
S0537	mm
S0538	to er easy to let it do it now what they're do that way be to relieve the pressure on coastlines in other areas isn't it
S0537	mm coastlines in other areas
S0538	yes where it's erode the coastline if if they let the flood flood plain flood it take the pressure off the coastlines it's the only way you can get release the amount of water come up tidal water so let it go into the flood plain rather than try and defend it
S0537	mm well they're just let some they're let some of those
S0538	coastlines go
S0537	coastlines go
S0538	yeah the lower coastlines
S0537	mm
S0538	go to protect
S0537	and even the higher ones
S0538	wherever there's there's flood plain wherever they're near to the flood plain it
S0537	mm
S0538	they're like er they act like lagoons
S0537	well where where be the where be all those house in the north east then aren't there aren't there house in the north east that they're let go they're not
S0538	don't know
S0537	i think there's some area up there where they're not defend it they're just well the house be topple off the cliffs
S0538	i've get no idea i mean it's they be consider a lot of wetland
S0537	mm
S0538	which er they try and keep dry they're wonder whether it'd be as well to let it let it go back and not it's quite expensive in some areas to keep it dry
S0537	mm
S0538	i think er some of there er some of those areas be be seriously consider let it go
S0537	see that's what with isn't there they've let all the drain areas go back
S0538	oh yeah it's not particularly boggy in they call it but in fact most of it's get quite a hard bottom
S0537	have it
S0538	and all that that be keep that be keep because it's on the sea level
S0537	mm
S0538	that be keep dry because of the railway the railway track go through it that's quite high
S0537	mm
S0538	and they build big pump to pump it on the other side of the railway which be go onto the shore and they keep all that dry with big pump
S0537	mm
S0538	which be quite easy to keep dry but it isn't actually all that boggy
S0537	mm so how long be it since be use as a dock how er how long be it since that be a dock
S0538	well it's many hundreds of years ago isn't it
S0537	be it be it that long
S0538	mm i say so but it would come virtually up to at one time with the tidal flow cos there's not much there's not until you get come up the rise into like or and
S0537	mm mm
S0538	those flat lie areas be be not much different to er be they
S0537	i think it stop at
S0538	well it might've do
S0537	well it must've do cos that be
S0538	but probably
S0537	where the dock be
S0538	er er before that er before even
S0537	yeah
S0538	it would be flood plain up here
S0537	yeah
S0538	but er yeah i mean it er it be use as a dock cos they find some old er remnants of old boat there didn't they
S0537	mm
S0538	when they start quarry it
S0537	yeah
S0538	and then there's all there's all the er that would be a mass amount of water when you think of erm come up right through the level with the
S0537	yeah
S0538	river right up to
S0537	yeah
S0538	that's all very flat that'd go
S0537	and gravel
S0538	that'd be all flood plain
S0537	that's why all the gravel be there
S0538	yeah
S0537	that they take out
S0538	yeah that would go right through all virtually up to
S0537	but the same with that would've be that would've
S0538	yeah
S0537	be
S0538	all would be
S0537	right through and that'd be right through to
S0538	yeah well be a port wasn't it
S0537	be a port as well i think
S0538	well that would be the river whatsit come out wouldn't it
S0537	that's the
S0538	no there's the there as well isn't there
S0537	where's that one come out
S0538	past er erm what do they call the big castle er
S0537	big castle place
S0538	er big house at
S0537	that's the
S0538	no
S0537	you mean
S0538	no
S0537	oh
S0538	the
S0537	yeah the
S0538	that go past the the the er the
S0537	yes
S0538	go through the paperworks
S0537	it do and past through and out
S0538	i mean at at
S0537	yeah
S0538	at go get other the other side of what's the river that
S0537	mm
S0538	go past
S0537	oh
S0537	oh
S0538	that's that's the river
S0537	er be it
S0538	mm and that go that go right up er up and up and where do it go to
S0537	well it go out to the estuary at doesn't it
S0538	yes but i i'm just try to think how far
S0537	go into the estuary at as well
S0538	inland it go it's quite a go quite a way
S0538	well the fall those fall that you we go and see sometimes the waterfalls that's the river that's not
S0537	the water oh you mean the erm
S0538	mm
S0538	where the salmon jump
S0537	yeah the salmon jump yeah
S0538	have rod on there hasn't he it's the isn't it the river
S0537	i don't know be it
S0538	think so but yeah all the way up to all all the way up to there's very little there'd be very little stop the water from right through up the to would there
S0537	no
S0538	at one time there might've be parcel of dry land
S0537	yeah yeah just parcel
S0538	it'd be a big area of water when you think about all
S0537	it would it would
S0538	the all this side of and way up to
S0537	yeah it would soon flood wouldn't need
S0538	big areas of water
S0537	it wouldn't need much would it
S0538	no
S0537	well look at that look at that time i go through the flood
S0538	where
S0537	that just come out of the village and down and it use to flood a lot there but i could always get through and then there be the day when er i get through but the car engine blow up do you remember
S0538	oh go way
S0537	oh no i be go down the main the the i be go down the road out of the village not way this yeah that the yeah that village road
S0538	go towards go towards i mean not
S0537	oh right go towards down the road yeah
S0538	go towards yeah that be at wasn't it
S0537	so oh well it be block like that for years wasn't it
S0538	yes cos they find a big boulder in it or something
S0537	do they that have be just leave
S0538	well it have drop in or cave in and it it be er
S0537	yeah
S0538	a big soon as they clear that out it hasn't it have it have flood since but it go
S0537	well yeah
S0538	now
S0537	but i know that day i be try to er although the engine be bang i be try to find a way to crawl the car back home and i go round every way i could think of i i can't remember how i actually get back home cos everywhere be flood the whole lot the the water be race
S0538	you probably get tow in
S0537	tow in no i didn't i finally manage to get home didn't i
S0538	your car conk you
S0537	oh be i oh
S0538	jam it all up blow water
S0537	oh yeah
S0538	like a lot of stupid people do they go in through it too fast
S0537	ah i follow your instructions and they didn't work
S0538	no you don't
S0538	i don't think most people
S0537	i do go slow and steady i go slow
S0538	haven't see anybody go through that that go through steady you know
S0537	i go slow and steady and what happen
S0538	you have to go very very slow very slow
S0537	my car blow up
S0538	in fact your gear aren't low enough you've get to ride the clutch
S0537	the trouble be the trouble be
S0538	and rev and rev your engine
S0537	the air filter on that car be too low that be the problem
S0538	it be on that cavalier i think wasn't it
S0537	oh it be a yeah it be
S0538	be it a cavalier
S0537	it be a cavalier
S0538	what do we do with it do we repair it or
S0537	yes
S0538	who do it
S0537	who do it
S0538	i can't remember have it do
S0537	yes it be
S0539	what it happen on the vauxhall
S0537	it happen do it happen on the vauxhall
S0538	yeah some of the air some of the air er intakes be low
S0537	oh
S0538	in the car
S0539	yeah i know but i think it happen
S0538	happen
S0539	when you be in the bmw
S0538	no i don't think it happen in the bmw
S0537	no it be the vauxhall bang bang bang bang bang
S0538	yeah it just it just up and all the cam shaft's go
S0537	yeah yeah
S0538	where the water
S0537	all the bottom half of the engine have to be replace
S0538	water water won't er condense it er just lock your engine solid
S0537	mm yeah
S0538	and people people think they can go through well it won't bother me i can go it's not gonna come into this car they don't realise that
S0537	well that's what you tell me but you be wrong that's what
S0538	mm
S0537	just go slow and steady
S0538	it doesn't matter how actually if it's
S0537	you'll be fine
S0538	if your air if your air intake
S0537	mm
S0538	be at the water level it doesn't matter how slow you go and how much you rev it you're gonna get water into your er your intake
S0537	yeah
S0538	and that would
S0537	that's exact i go
S0538	that'll blow your engine
S0537	i go slow i rev it steady
S0538	i don't think it be that low on that car
S0537	it be that low it be that low otherwise i wouldn't've blow up
S0538	but anyway we'll always beg to differ on that point
S0537	mm
S0538	and er i don't think there be any witness to prove it any different so we'll just have to take your word for it
S0537	no
S0538	however
S0537	mm
S0538	i er won't be er i'll never be convince
S0537	yeah i follow your instructions to the t
S0538	mm
S0538	that's the problem people don't generally go slow enough through the water
S0537	i'd be through that flood load of time and i'd always get out the other side
S0539	what so what do you do differently then
S0537	the water i didn't do anything differently it be the water that be deeper that be the problem
S0538	oh you say you'd be through it many a time like that
S0537	i'd be through i'd go through slow and steady
S0538	so obviously that time you you you you didn't do it right do you
S0537	i go through slow and steady every time and i always get through
S0538	you see
S0537	that time i go through slow and steady and i didn't get i do get through but i be bang all the way home
S0538	see usually truth truth will out usually
S0537	yeah
S0538	truth will out usually
S0537	no it be just that bite deeper that day
S0538	i don't know you didn't go with the measure stick
S0537	sadly i didn't if i'd have a measure stick if i'd have somebody
S0538	actually it'd only get to
S0537	if some man have walk in front of me with a measure stick i wouldn't've do it
S0538	actually it there be only one depth it could get to because once it get to a depth it run through the fence
S0537	yeah
S0538	so it would be no deeper that day than any other day
S0537	it would've run away it be it be deeper that day
S0538	unfortunately you be just a bite lapse that day and you go a bite too quick
S0537	it be no it be definitely deeper that day
S0538	mm
S0537	it be
S0538	oh well you'd have to come up with some
S0537	mm
S0538	good excuse
S0537	i should've take the warn
S0538	especially when you've blow your engine off
S0537	i should've take the warn from the car on the other side of the flood that be pull up by the side i should've note that and think he's stop for a reason
S0538	oh there's some reason for this
S0537	there's some reason for it but i didn't
S0538	could it be the water
S0537	i think no i'll follow 's instructions go slow and steady he obviously hasn't go slow and steady have not go slowly and he's not rev enough and that's why he's have a problem i'll follow the instructions and i'll be fine no
S0539	but surely if you rev you'll suck the water in
S0538	no er
S0537	no
S0538	it's it's to stop any water go up your exhaust pipe
S0537	yeah
S0538	if it's blow it out it can't go up can it
S0537	believe you me i be rev like hell
S0539	oh yeah
S0537	rev like hell
S0538	if it's blow the exhaust out it can't go up your pipe
S0537	yeah it start bang when i be er
S0538	and your air your air intake's another thing and it's er er i mean
S0538	er in some cars they they be poorly design they have them too low
S0537	i
S0538	they have some of them behind their bumpers
S0537	mm
S0538	which be absolutely crackers
S0537	start bang when i be about halfway through i think i hope it make it to the other side because my footwear wasn't suitable for paddle i can tell you
S0538	i think yours on your car's
S0538	quite high up
S0537	mm
S0538	but er they be on these others but on i mean you see these land rovers with a spout up on the top of the
S0537	yeah
S0539	mm
S0537	yeah
S0538	off roaders that's the reason they have them up there
S0537	i don't know why they put them so low down it's really it should be a bite higher up shouldn't it
S0538	well they're bad design some of them
S0537	yeah they're badly design the air filter should be higher
S0538	i think it's renaults er that be or use to be
S0537	mm mm
S0538	quite just behind the grille
S0539	have decide what he's do with his land rover yet
S0537	keep it
S0539	be he
S0537	mm
S0539	do know
S0537	yeah
S0539	what do he say about it
S0537	nothing
S0539	really
S0537	mm he decide it wouldn't be worthwhile he he couldn't justify keep he couldn't justify get a brand new one and it didn't matter because they've get a wait list for them anyway
S0538	why would he have ever think he could've justify have a brand new er land rover
S0537	i don't know he have his
S0538	he's not a farmer he doesn't go off roading
S0537	he be in possession he be in possession
S0538	he be only go to lose money at the end of the day
S0537	he be in possession of a brand new defender for a while wasn't he
S0538	oh in possession
S0537	yeah yeah but never
S0538	well
S0537	mind he's get load of them hasn't he so
S0538	i think it's a good er a good decision he's make really although
S0537	mm
S0538	if he live long enough
S0537	he would've make money
S0538	specially if he buy the last defender off the er off the off the er assembly line
S0537	mm
S0538	it could be worth thousands and thousands a few years well the last one off the assembly line could be worth thousands now if you ever
S0537	well er
S0538	manage to get the last one
S0537	i think if they've get mm
S0538	and evidence of it be the last one
S0537	if they have so many people wait to go on the wait list then you would think that those defenders will make money as soon as they you take ownership rather than lose money you'd think they'd start make a bite of money immediately
S0538	well they probably
S0537	well they use to you know
S0538	they probably won't lose money
S0537	oh what be what be those wooden cars the erm
S0538	morris minor
S0537	no
S0538	estate
S0537	no no no no ah what be they that that sport
S0537	the sport car oh that be make out a lot of wood in them it's a sport car
S0538	oh the erm
S0537	hand build
S0538	mm quite a few hand build ones
S0537	yeah
S0538	morgan
S0537	morgan
S0538	the morgans
S0537	those morgans increase in value as soon
S0538	oh yeah yeah yeah like because they're one
S0537	as soon as you have possession of them
S0538	they're one off
S0537	but then they're think that'll happen to defenders well i don't know
S0538	yeah well it probably will
S0537	do you think so
S0538	mm
S0538	well it's surprise how many people collect land rovers now you know the mark one land rovers
S0537	mm
S0538	and they're worth a lot of money now well the
S0537	mm
S0538	they're worth more money now than what people give for them new
S0537	mm
S0538	so that'll happen but as i say it'll be a lot of years before a defender become
S0537	mm do you remember that land rover leave up on your yard
S0538	mm that now that be a
S0537	with a that be worth that would be worth a bite
S0538	that be worth quite a bite and that be an old mark one
S0537	yeah have a tree grow through it in the end
S0538	if you er if you look after those er some of those cars they er
S0537	mm
S0538	they do become very valuable but you've gotta keep them in good nick that's the secret
S0537	mm
S0538	if you keep these some of these old cars and they're immaculate they're worth a lot of money
S0537	mm
S0538	a lot of cars old cars that bing bring big money
S0537	well 's m5's start go up now
S0539	have it
S0537	mm
S0538	once it become
S0537	obviously that'll never make big money because he's erm
S0538	once they stop make them
S0537	because he's drift it a lot so it's be
S0538	become like a collector's car to a point then you get
S0537	mm
S0538	it get like er er in years go by a lot of the cars rust away people never use to bother about them
S0537	mm
S0538	you know they like go to scrap yard and one thing and another
S0537	mm
S0538	and then you'd have some old lady with pride and joy sit in the garage with a an old an old an old oldish car hardly ever run it just do a few miles and then they come onto the scene and they pay they make big big money because they're they're in good such good order
S0539	mm
S0537	mm
S0539	that's what should've do
S0538	yeah well i dunno that would've take years and that probably
S0537	yeah
S0538	that type of car it wouldn't've
S0537	oh no wasn't worth anything be it didn't have any redeem feature
S0538	that hybrid i don't think i don't think be some of the old some of the old citroëns
S0539	no
S0538	do make money
S0537	do they
S0539	she could've get a collectable though
S0537	mm
S0538	but they're old ones they're they're you know in their fifties
S0537	like to
S0538	nearly all old nearly all old cars er have quite good value if they're in good nick
S0537	like to erm be in possession of her money doesn't she she like to be in possession
S0538	mm i don't know whether you could say that really when they can buy a new car and blow twelve thousand on it in two years
S0537	yes but but it be only a cheap car though i mean she could've
S0538	well it be nineteen thousand
S0537	she could've afford a
S0538	not exactly
S0539	nineteen thousand for
S0538	new
S0539	that
S0538	yeah
S0539	goodness me
S0538	which you never ever get back
S0537	mm
S0538	so it have all sort of silly extras on it it'd only do five thousand something like that seven thousand at the most er and it have lose it finish up lose over ten thousand quid didn't it
S0537	mm
S0538	it's not really the way to
S0537	mm
S0538	to suggest that you like like your money if you spend it like that you obviously haven't much regard for your money
S0537	mm oh phone er leave a message before
S0539	do she
S0537	yeah their house sale's fall through so they've have to take the deposit off the new house so they're really disappoint
S0539	so they're not gonna get the new house
S0538	no
S0537	well they can't till they've sell their house
S0539	oh no
S0537	the people know that they're still very interest and want it
S0538	but they've have two people look at it since
S0539	why have it fall through
S0537	cos the woman who be buy theirs her sale's fall through you know on their property
S0539	oh
S0538	that's what happen chain it's like a pack of card
S0537	yeah the chain collapse so they're very disappoint cos that be a
S0539	i bet
S0538	the only chance well they still have a good if they can get a buyer think the other house be still there isn't it cos i don't think they're any in any rush
S0537	well they haven't get probate through yet
S0538	no
S0537	so it's bind to be there a little while so
S0538	so they're still
S0537	i mean what what they'll have to decide be i mean they really like that house it it's a lovely lovely position great position for the kid isn't it lot of room round it and garden round it
S0538	well it appear to be
S0537	right away from the road
S0538	and they be you know 's keen and they be
S0537	oh yeah really keen
S0538	seem to be the right area for them erm
S0537	so they they'll have to decide whether they want to try for a bridge loan or not
S0538	oh they're expensive aren't they
S0537	i know but that's what that's the decision
S0539	what what's a bridge loan
S0538	well it tide you over until you sell your house
S0539	oh
S0537	yeah but they'd have to pay interest on a bridge loan
S0539	yeah
S0537	you see unless they decide that they want to keep the house they're in as a buy to let and try and let it i mean house round there get let very quickly
S0539	mm
S0538	depend how much money they need to put down though doesn't it
S0537	so well they'll have to well he's i think they've get they've get a pretty good deposit they'll have to decide what they want to do if they want it that much they'll have to have another plan won't they cos those
S0538	sound like it
S0537	those house be let be let very quickly in that area
S0538	they they they have say they've have two look
S0537	yeah
S0538	right away
S0537	yeah
S0538	at the house again so there be er always a chance yeah
S0539	oh that's good
S0537	yeah
S0538	you never know
S0537	yeah
S0538	it seem to be an area where they do sell reasonably quickly so
S0537	oh yeah
S0538	it might possibly go up in time for them
S0537	it's yeah well it's ideal for er
S0538	anyway there's no harm do in a way
S0537	i be go to say for anybody who commute need to commute it's ideal isn't it
S0538	yeah
S0537	you know
S0539	and where be the new house go to be where where be it at
