S0240	yeah
S0478	and get them deliver to and then have to bring them down
S0240	i mean we've get
S0240	you know because because morrisons be so handy we i tend to go there and then just find the stuff the cheaper stuff within
S0240	morrisons and the price have go down actually in morrisons but if you do go to lidl and stuff it be a lot cheaper
S0478	oh yeah
S0240	on the other hand i don't particularly like the meat
S0478	but you can't do all your shop

S0479	and the meat's not very nice
S0240	the meat's not very nice either
S0478	oh no
S0240	so we don't buy it so we're not
S0478	no
S0240	we end up with a load of stuff without the meat and then you actually haven't get anything to cook so
S0478	mm the trouble be you just can't well you could spend your whole life do it and then to be really please with yourself but then what's that
S0240	oh
S0478	that's not life be it
S0240	no hardly

S0478	they have some nice steaks
S0240	the sausages be
S0478	and erm you need to be careful what you buy cos they
S0240	they don't have free range do they
S0478	adulterate a lot of it you know they put like some sauce
S0240	oh do they
S0478	already which i don't like but the some of their steak's really good actually
S0240	really
S0478	i quite often buy a small steak and chop it up
S0240	yeah
S0478	then just fry it quickly and then put it on a salad or
S0240	they probably
S0478	erm
S0240	have different stuff than than they do
S0478	they have free range chicken and
S0240	oh do they
S0478	yeah
S0240	oh they don't in the one

S0240	ours be not very good for meat and also
S0479	and it's just a smaller shop
S0240	it's much more expensive it's more expensive as well you know
S0478	and salmon
S0240	the wine's quite good
S0478	the stuff like milk's much more expensive because
S0240	yeah
S0478	it's handy for
S0240	wash up liquid's much more

S0240	yeah
S0478	mm
S0240	i
S0240	yeah i would er quite like to
S0240	and well we could do that while they're
S0478	what do you think
S0240	still around get up you know
S0478	they'll be age get up won't they
S0240	yes
S0478	and so i'm go to have to do this exercise three time today
S0240	oh
S0478	and well and others i should do as well mm
S0240	yeah i don't think they'll be up i mean we if we could wake them up if if we want to
S0478	what time do they wake up
S0240	wouldn't wake up till at least midday would he
S0479	no
S0478	how's he be get go and
S0240	i don't know
S0478	and do anything in life
S0240	i i don't know i really don't know
S0478	i mean he's not alone at all
S0240	no no and i and i have try you know the more you try the more he resist it so i've just tend to leave him now but i do every morning get him you know try and get him go but it's just impossible
S0479	no it's cos he go out really late and then
S0240	he go out late and he's not into a rhythm of stay up you know be up in the night and but i think it's really unhealthy cos he doesn't really get go like he have the days when he could be look for things you know but he doesn't you go in there and he's do some he's not he's not actually look on anything he say he'll do it later and then doesn't get round to
S0478	he's not he's not motivate to do anything
S0240	at the moment he's not i think he's a bite confuse about what to do to be honest
S0478	oh i'm not surprise
S0240	you know
S0478	i'm still confuse about what to do in life
S0240	i know
S0478	but seriously though i mean you know
S0240	yeah no i know
S0478	some days i think shall i go out and get a job or shall i not or
S0240	mm i know i feel the same because
S0478	and what do i want to do what what what do i want to be in life you know
S0240	yeah and we're come up for
S0478	i think erm
S0240	sixty and we're still
S0240	think it
S0240	i know i but i think it make you realise that if you if you think that now if you do want to do something you have to get on with it because
S0478	well i think if you like
S0240	it all go
S0478	want to be a doctor or a dentist there's you've get something specific to aim for but i don't think any of us be like that
S0240	no we weren't maybe we didn't get enough of that sort of well it never
S0478	no no i just don't think we ever want to to be
S0240	it never enter my head that i could be a doctor or a
S0478	no
S0240	it just didn't enter my head but i don't
S0478	no
S0240	remember ever have conversations about what do you want to be apart from at primary school when you say you want to be an air host or
S0478	oh yeah well
S0240	whatever you know i don't remember
S0478	no i don't think we we at we didn't get any career advice
S0240	no
S0478	at all
S0240	no or later
S0478	and er and just in at in the sixth form it be just erm
S0240	just
S0478	you know like they like
S0240	aim high and
S0478	to print in the paper ninety seven percent of our girls have go to university
S0240	yeah
S0478	and didn't want to be one of those i want to ruin their statistics
S0240	but you still do it so you still go
S0478	no but i didn't go the first year i do it on my own
S0240	oh that's right
S0478	mm
S0240	yeah
S0478	mm and career woman be she be this huge woman
S0240	pass me the crust
S0478	i remember her
S0240	i'll eat the crust
S0479	do you want
S0478	with
S0240	oh
S0478	a huge woman with huge great breast and obviously
S0478	no experience of life at all
S0478	she'd just work in a girls' school all her life
S0240	yeah
S0478	mm she be the one advise people about what to do and
S0240	mm
S0478	you just think hang on a minute
S0240	well i don't think they're much better now because otherwise they would
S0478	and she have her favourites you know
S0240	mm
S0478	and erm she'd know them since they be you know come in the first years of the school so if you come in the sixth form like i do you stand no chance
S0240	i don't think people know what the possibilities be i mean i i find it difficult to well with i can tell him different possibilities and that but he sort of reject them all for some reason
S0478	well cos it's you
S0240	all of
S0478	cos you're his mother
S0240	i know do you think that's what it be
S0478	yeah totally oh totally yeah
S0240	in that case yeah so in a way it's better not to present things cos each one each time you present some possibility it get rule out so you're you sort of do a worse job than if you didn't suggest anything really
S0478	yeah yeah yeah it's probably even more difficult
S0240	yeah but you don't feel like that do you
S0478	between mother and daughters normally than mother and sons
S0240	but it's for us it doesn't seem to be do it
S0478	because it's not come to the crunch point yet
S0240	what what crunch point
S0478	but also yeah
S0478	well i mean er 's not leave school or anything not in the same position as but it it be a crunch point when you've get to decide what a level to do but
S0240	i don't know i mean
S0478	it be for really difficult yeah i mean
S0240	it be really difficult yeah because it's not
S0478	but parent be not the best people to
S0240	no
S0478	to help
S0240	but the trouble be
S0478	at all
S0240	you know university now for for he see it as a very untempting proposition he see it as more study which he doesn't particularly like anyway and then he see it as this massive debt he's gonna incur for do something he doesn't really want to do so erm
S0478	but therefore he need to do an apprenticeship or something but they
S0240	well that's what he that's what he's gonna try and do
S0478	do you know we have some brilliant people to do some job around the house that need do erm like you know the the sealant on the shower and that sort of thing upstairs and electrical job and
S0240	mm
S0478	erm and he be say about the government be just cut back on all the apprenticeship opportunities
S0240	they're mean to be
S0478	they say they'd love to have an but you know apprentice to work with them
S0240	i think they be do the opposite i think they be increase
S0478	mm
S0240	the number
S0478	well well they're make
S0240	they're gonna they're aim for three million
S0478	i mean and we have to have an electrician recently to do something and he's he be say exactly the same be that erm it's there's just disincentives to do it
S0240	erm
S0478	i know they're say that they're do it but they're not
S0240	no
S0478	actually do it it cost small company too much to
S0240	to have someone
S0478	yeah
S0240	yeah and the government don't want to put any money into it cos they don't want to put any money into anything do they
S0478	well exactly and i think i think also it it you know it if you say you've get to go to university to study to be an electrician or a plumber it kind of devalue it in a way
S0240	mm
S0478	because what they really need to do be be out on job with people
S0240	yeah but that's not the sort of apprenticeship want anyway
S0478	well no i know but
S0240	he want to get into market and business erm business management and market
S0478	he need to erm
S0240	go to university
S0478	he need to do an mba or something
S0240	and he can't do that until he's do a degree so
S0478	no
S0240	erm i think he will find something
S0478	well he could get try and get take on by an employer do something and then they could
S0240	yeah and then they
S0478	a lot of employers do
S0478	pay for you to do a degree and that sort of thing
S0240	yeah
S0478	i mean it be just a bite unlucky that they
S0240	cos they would or something
S0478	didn't pay for her to do her ma
S0240	they might have do in this job
S0478	mm
S0240	but then she wouldn't have get the job if she hadn't be
S0478	well i i know so
S0240	mm it's lovely this bread isn't it
S0479	yeah really it's delicious
S0478	do you want some more
S0240	erm mm i don't do you
S0479	i'm fine thank you
S0240	no thank
S0478	mm i don't know
S0240	we could slice a piece off for cos he won't know how to
S0478	he won't be able to cut it himself
S0240	i don't well not evenly and if you don't want it hack up i think he'll probably find it difficult cos we
S0478	doesn't really matter i'll i will cut some more bits
S0240	mm so have we do ten minutes
S0479	yeah
S0240	have we stop it then
