S0519	listen to this i don't know i haven't even look at the house yet i've and it can't be that good cos it's seven two five
S0519	offer excellent value
S0520	seven two five be your budget isn't it
S0519	we don't like value with no chain locate in a truly beautiful and tranquil location set in ground of just over an acre and ten minutes' drive from village centre
S0520	where's
S0519	a four bedroomed three bathroom five reception room
S0520	what do you need five reception room for
S0519	well we need to two for the piano and accoutrements that's far enough away
S0520	two for the piano
S0521	it just mean downstairs doesn't it
S0519	mm love it so we'll view on a map
S0520	where be
S0519	south cheshire south west
S0521	very close to
S0520	what do it mean by five reception room it's just a
S0519	five reception room it's probably erm a bite modern
S0520	utility and
S0519	and other things that we don't want so i'm not go to get over excite
S0520	yeah erm be your budget about seven hundred then or be it like as in
S0519	no you go normally in england you offer below erm
S0520	oh really
S0519	yes so it if you would go up to about say seven fifty or maybe a bite more so that you could come down to seven two five from there
S0521	i've hear this theory before
S0519	this be the idea
S0520	i've not only hear this theory i've actually see it in action it's the ever increase budget of the house search no but it's a bite different this time isn't it cos you don't want a mortgage
S0519	no
S0520	or be that a decision
S0519	that's a definite decision yeah that's right
S0520	well at least if you live down there you'll keep this house i'll be happy
S0519	yeah that's right
S0521	if your piano be of low value and you don't mind how it's move a man and a van should be okay if your instrument be of value either sentimental or instrumental it be wise to use the correct method of transportation we be work blind use this method of book so if your piano be of high value and you require specialist mover equipment please make this clear
S0520	that's you dad in the second category innit
S0521	yeah extra charge for stairs and obstacles
S0520	that's actually a good thing in your house it's probably quite it's quite a dream for a removals company isn't it cos no no narrow staircases and there's no like weird annoy doors
S0519	it's it's no no double for the piano it's a double door through to the kitchen and a double door out
S0520	mm
S0519	to the garden and then you that's your one step
S0520	i remember them move the piano where do i remember that in holland maybe from the first to
S0519	there be one where the the grand piano come
S0520	upside down
S0519	on its side on a little trolley
S0521	a trolley
S0519	with two little guy in a
S0520	heart attack
S0521	little white van
S0519	i be terrify
S0520	yeah well they're notorious aren't they pianos for be tricky to move and unhappy to be move
S0521	mm
S0520	you have get it tune don't you straight away i also remember the little piano be replace by the big piano
S0519	i know it's funny isn't it
S0520	how old be i i be young i be traumatise
S0519	yeah you be just a little squidge
S0520	i remember not enjoy play the big one for age
S0521	oh oh
S0520	cos we be so use to it
S0519	such a different feel wasn't it
S0520	yeah and also you could just kind of go and hide in that little room and play practice and stuff whereas with the grand piano you have to kind of er
S0521	can't hide with the grand mm
S0520	give a performance every time you sit down
S0521	mm
S0520	so what's the er what do it look like
S0519	it's a bite modern and huge rather than you know cosy and
S0520	characterful
S0519	characterful
S0521	mm
S0520	erm the one
S0519	the garden look stun
S0520	mm that's really nice to have
S0519	and the location be fabulous well i don't know that the location be fabulous
S0520	i wouldn't want to be that close
S0519	yeah
S0520	i mean not because of
S0519	it's probably half an hour from but it's a modern house which be not what we have in mind
S0520	mm
S0519	it's a very lovely look house
S0520	you should just start go to see things cos you're not go to be able to tell until you kind of start to erm be there in the flesh and respond to the different type of thing
S0519	no you're right
S0520	the one that you have a pamphlet of upstairs both of you the favourite one have an amaze kitchen
S0519	yeah
S0520	it be absolutely beautiful and that's what i imagine and it have it have an aga though
S0519	me too
S0520	which be lovely sound but nobody want to cook on it
S0519	no but that no but that they you can even have gas and electric agas now so you don't know until you
S0520	you don't want to be stoke coal into your oven before you cook your bake potato
S0519	no no usually if it have erm an aga
S0520	i have one in if you remember and er i didn't have a normal cooker so i didn't really use it at all it be just like
S0519	mm no that's right
S0520	it be a gas aga though but it be still you know you need and ancient knowledge of the of the er i dunno physical nature
S0519	yeah the wisdom of agas
S0520	the wisdom of agas yeah to get it work i just use the microwave a lot er you want an option anyway but yeah it be a really nice kitchen it be kind of erm mint a sage colour
S0519	road sound rather major doesn't it
S0520	it could be and it couldn't be you know sometimes those be erm
S0519	nineteen twenties
S0520	really old
S0519	arts and craft country house with spacious accommodation in six acres with beautiful view
S0520	love mm be that within the budget
S0519	seven hundred
S0520	bargain i mean the good thing be that you don't have a have to have massive house
S0519	mm
S0520	you know you can erm you can downsize
S0519	mm that's right
S0520	and have more land or better quality instead
S0519	what we need be better quality and
S0520	layout
S0519	bigger downstairs or a studio or a you know something special that it that be close enough to the house so that we could either extend to it with a conservatory or something like that
S0520	mm
S0519	and then have the piano room as a sort of garden room separate that would be my ideal
S0520	i like the idea as well yeah nice and spread out and the other thing that be nice about that house be the set the set be kind of exactly how i imagine your house
S0519	mm mm
S0520	it be mature tree all the way round so you have that really secure feel
S0519	yes yes that's lovely isn't it
S0520	and the lovely garden and the beyond that obviously nice countryside but the you know it be very kind of enclose
S0519	mm
S0520	erm with the tree and stuff it be really pretty
S0521	well it's give our address as north
S0519	we be in yeah i don't know why don't know why
S0520	your address
S0521	yeah
S0520	think you be
S0521	erm it's isn't it be part of must be
S0520	mm so have you have any developments with the buyers or be you just wait for the paperwork
S0519	no tomorrow they're suppose to go and see the house erm er no sorry they're suppose to have a a survey do on the house
S0520	mm
S0519	but i do think we would have get the the paper by now it's quite a major er
S0520	these estate agents be not the most efficient people i've ever hear of
S0519	pretty slow aren't they
S0520	yeah and do you have a survey down before you put it on the market
S0519	you have to have like a a general survey
S0520	general one yeah
S0519	but then they can choose to have something more detail
S0520	mm i can't imagine there's any issue
S0519	no er oh in fact for their mortgage apparently they have to erm have a
S0520	certain type do
S0519	a a survey
S0520	construction
S0519	probably yeah
S0520	just find lot of bird nest everywhere so how's it be with the bird have they come back
S0519	here
S0520	yeah no
S0519	no no it's be really good
S0520	excellent
S0519	but do we tell you do dad tell you he get like completely free the loft insulate he just ring the gas company for their advice cos they it it say you know british gas give advice about loft and insulation
S0520	oh yeah
S0519	of your home and so on and i be like oh for goodness sake you know as i usually be for dad and his erm i you know
S0521	i miss that i miss
S0519	his er free free for nothing bargain
S0520	mm
S0519	and the this guy say yes it's free to everybody in britain the government have decree it's not mean test
S0520	cool
S0519	erm and we be just what be think we'd do it ourselves but we need someone to tell us what to put in there
S0520	mm
S0519	and two men come and completely re erm lag the whole loft both side and then they but what i be why it remind be i dad have stuff cloth into all of the eaves to stop the bird be able to get in
S0520	mm
S0519	but they say the eaves be there for air like there's no air brick and you can get moisture and condensation
S0520	mm
S0519	build up and so you have let some gap
S0520	mm
S0519	so they'd have have to pull it back from stuff right in and they recommend like wire mesh
S0520	to stop the bird from come in
S0519	to stop the bird come in so erm
S0520	well that's good advice isn't it
S0519	but we didn't have any yeah but it be great wasn't it
S0520	that's probably a really smart move in their part cos it's all energy efficiency isn't it
S0519	that's right that's right that's what it's all about isn't it
S0521	so erm i'm just look and it's about a hundred and fifty the increment in the edinburgh company's quote for a piano
S0519	i don't understand that really increment
S0521	well he he he give me a price with and without piano and then you add tax and insurance to it so i'm i'm sort of think if they can if we get a piano company for four hundred
S0520	just do it separately
S0521	do it separately
S0520	i think that sound wise as well
S0519	yeah
S0521	what do you think then you'd be sure that
S0519	you've still then get to have that piano deliver
S0521	well no they're quote me price of four hundredish
S0519	for the storage
S0521	for everything removal plus storage
S0519	nobody's gonna i'm mm i
S0521	sorry
S0519	who be quote you removal and storage erm three hundred miles
S0520	for the just for the piano do you think that's too low
S0519	and and delivery to your new home i'm talk about maybe that's not so remove it from this home store it for six months and deliver it to your new home all for hour hundred pound
S0521	yeah
S0519	i'm very concern frankly
S0520	i like this mentality i know what you mean although if it's three thousand five hundred for the whole house it it kind of make sense to me that that would be the price
S0519	yeah you'd imagine just the you know we want to hire a van how much be it go to be for us two eejits to hire our own van
S0521	hundred and fifty
S0519	a hundred and fifty this be to hire to van and this be not to remove and store and redeliver
S0520	mm
S0521	they've get their own vans they don't have to hire them
S0519	i know but what i mean be i just want to put it in the context of erm
S0520	no but if you put it in the context of the whole house
S0519	it's hardly more
S0520	that be like you know where what be it a web quote or be it a phone quote
S0521	it it's like a lot of it's sort of an agency
S0520	mm
S0521	and you you tell the agency what you want to ask for and they distribute it to all of their
S0520	oh yeah yeah like a compare dot com almost
S0521	and then each each one individually send in a quote
S0520	ah
S0521	i've get three for the piano and they're all between four and five hundred
S0520	well that must be the case then
S0521	if if they do offer a professional service
S0520	if they understand the
S0521	and store it in an air condition room then i would
S0520	agree take that out of the equation and then get a good deal on the whole
S0521	prefer that i'd prefer to have that and then take the the best offer for the rest
S0520	mm and what else do you have in storage the sofas and mattresses bed book
S0521	bookcases
S0520	yeah nothing
S0521	bedside table coffee table
S0520	be you go to bring the big coffee table here mum
S0521	everything except the kitchen really
S0520	the one the the main one no it's too big
S0519	no
S0521	you're think of bring the big one here be you
S0519	no
S0521	no
S0520	would be a bite dominate
S0519	the little
S0521	din table din chair
S0519	the little one the erm one from the gallery be like these sort of oak colour
S0520	oh yeah yeah i know what you mean mm
S0519	and erm the little oak
S0520	yeah the
S0519	television table quite a lot of the picture we may as well hang them here even if we take the others later erm

S0519	tell me it's not on the a51
S0521	a51 be whitchurch
S0519	nobody's mention the a51 so far
S0520	yeah they don't tend to this house be conveniently situate
S0519	on the a51
S0520	on a major road
S0521	you can actually see the m6 from the bedroom window
S0520	sometimes you do
S0519	highly seek after location cheek of it
S0520	well it probably be a highly seek after location i mean it's good if you're communise to be on the a like near a big road isn't it
S0519	no you don't nobody call the a51 highly desirable
S0520	be it
S0519	street view be not available that's cos they couldn't stand on the a51 cos the traffic be whiz by
S0520	oh dear
S0519	wonder why it be look so nice
S0520	be it literally on the road
S0519	it doesn't say so i'll keep go and just get the description of how to get there and it say go down the a51 and bob'is your uncle
S0520	you don't need a
S0521	remind me of that survey that we have for the for our house and they the comment be erm the gutter be visually inspect from the grind and be find to be satisfactory
S0520	what do that mean
S0519	with binoculars it say
S0521	so how how much that actually tell you about the state of the gutter i'm not sure
S0520	not a lot mm i personally would hate to be able to hear a road from my house
S0519	me too
S0521	yes
S0520	that i be retire that be one of the nicest things about this house
S0521	we're quite strong on the road noise agreement be there
S0519	that's the that be the
S0520	it's so unsettle
S0519	the one thing i won't i it devalue our house for me
S0520	yeah
S0519	in two ways the garden it be too cold but the garden it wasn't enjoyable any more
S0520	mm
S0521	there's a slight catch twenty two of course here
S0520	mm
S0521	in order to get to a house you need a road
S0519	you need a road
S0520	no there's a road come to this house as well but do you ever here a road noise
S0519	yeah you here the
S0520	you hear the odd tractor you hear more cow that you do anything else i mean that's what i'm say you can't here the a sixty what have you whatever it be there
S0521	no that's true
S0520	a66 be it
S0521	a66 yes that's right
S0520	erm you know that road noise it's fine even if it's on a little road
S0521	yeah
S0520	you know that there's occasionally a car trundle along you just don't want that you know like that constant
S0521	well okay we're we're we're quite quite erm we're unanimous aren't we
S0520	yeah
S0521	unanimous
S0519	mm
S0520	yeah
S0521	about the road noise
S0519	absolutely
S0520	that's erm disturb the peace isn't it or water some i mean in a completely different way run water
S0521	yeah it's an interest one that what about water
S0520	it's slightly different
S0521	would that be soothe or disturb
S0520	well some people really like it but i i think to live there
S0519	i wouldn't like rush water i think that's it's too frantic
S0520	on a river yeah
S0521	babble brook
S0519	erm a
S0520	a little brook
S0519	a a tiny little brook would be gorgeous
S0521	slight babbler
S0519	a little mini babble
S0520	mini babbler
S0519	but not a rag torrent
S0520	i don't like be too close to the sea for that reason
S0521	ah
S0519	noisy
S0520	i find it difficult to sleep
S0521	the sea well they they give they give our tap of the sea to relax you
S0520	i know it's funny well some people really like it but i find if it's constant shh shh shh it's just slightly a restless noise
S0521	mm i know what you mean
S0520	but i mean some people yeah they they that's their dream isn't it there's that house that's on the eden erm next to cave that's on that
S0521	yes
S0520	dam and
S0519	yes i couldn't cope with that
S0520	that would be much too
S0521	the weir
S0520	er the weir yeah and it's a lovely look house and i've see the family erm i don't think they live there but they come there and erm i've always think erm it must be really hard to sleep there cos it's quite a strong like it's a bite of a waterfall isn't it
S0521	right
S0519	so that be look quite interest until i realise in be on the a51
S0520	well you don't know that you could you should ask
S0519	i'm pretty sure
S0521	have you establish that it's on the a51
S0519	i've look at the view on a map
S0521	and
S0519	and
S0520	that little pin
S0519	the pin be on the a51
S0521	be that yellow thing the a51
S0519	yes
S0521	oh my god
S0519	and so you can zoom in
S0521	mm
S0519	and you get tiny little roads then show
S0520	mm
S0519	but not for this house it's get as if it's further and further away from the a51 there's no road to it
S0521	oh my god
S0519	so it's on the a51
S0521	oh oh
S0520	not cool
S0519	so that's nay good
S0521	dad be show me the pics from your vacation
S0519	yes and i he be me too and it they're lovely and but we have to remember to please turn the set from two photos to every click
S0520	be that what it's do
S0519	yeah so we it then if you've take three of the same thing you have to watch it six time
S0521	get six
S0520	yeah there be some repetition
S0519	zoom in and out
S0520	but i be surprise by the shropshire photos it be really really pretty
S0519	it's beautiful isn't it
S0520	mm all the purple heather and
S0519	but that's a bite south
S0520	too far south
S0521	that be south
S0519	from where we would need to live
S0520	yeah that doesn't make sense do it
S0521	north shropshire
S0520	well it make sense it's fine
S0519	the price now make sense here six nine nine nine fifty
S0521	six nine nine fifty bracket a51
S0520	would be eight fifty
S0521	i wonder whether it make that much difference
S0520	i think so yeah
S0519	oh absolutely huge the number of time you watch a property programme it's huge
S0520	be it
S0519	and they say well i'd really like this house but in a different set
S0520	the road thing be a big deal move it mm
S0519	and they they just say and then it wouldn't be in your budget
S0520	yeah people have to be realistic don't they
S0521	oh my god
S0519	it's a huge
S0521	another catch twenty two
S0519	that'd be another hundred thou on top if it wasn't on the a51
S0520	a hundred thousand maybe not that much
S0519	fifty thousand then big it's big
S0520	you pay a premium for good location for sure don't you
S0519	yeah location be
S0520	location location location
S0519	mm no it look quite nice
S0520	and i mean people who want to move to the countryside it's precisely what they don't want be to hear a road
S0519	hear a road
S0521	a lot of low fly beam
S0520	i don't like low fly beam
S0521	have you get to care for my state of my head
S0520	i really don't i just it's so not fun
S0519	no
S0520	to be duck and i hit my head all over the place in this house
S0519	no i agree
S0521	it be romantic it's romantic have beam everywhere
S0520	mm briefly
S0521	but it's
S0520	i don't necessarily like how it look if they're too if it's too beamy either like there's an ideal beam ratio erm
S0519	no the the a little bite of beamage be nice
S0520	a little bite of beamage but you know there's some place be a bite overboard aren't they
S0521	then you have the faux beam which be just add for show
S0519	oh no
S0520	no what's that about
S0521	modern modern editions to make it look supposedly older
S0519	suggest we have somebody in to erm look at at whether the cross beam in the room upstairs be structural
S0520	this room
S0521	he's get a thing about that beam hasn't he
S0519	yeah but it do it go mean there's quite a bite of that room be half be awkward at to say the very least
S0521	you know when they come they move the bed
S0520	this room or that one
S0521	your room
S0520	oh that one yeah you're right it's in a quite an annoy location isn't it
S0519	mm
S0521	when they come they move the bed to the opposite end of the room
S0519	no they sleep at the opposite end of the bed they couldn't be bother to move it i don't think
S0520	what because of the beam
S0519	they didn't want to be under it
S0520	it's not that threaten be it
S0519	some mm
S0520	bite claustrophobic
S0519	yeah sleep under it
S0520	i don't notice it at all when i sleep
S0519	i don't notice it but the be where you be you couldn't have two people one each side of the beam you feel like a bite of a barrier
S0520	hallo yeah i guess so erm but
S0519	but he's right you could
S0520	yeah it's worth ask
S0519	if it's not structural or if there's a
S0520	why would it not be structural why would it be there otherwise
S0521	they just put it there for show
S0519	no it it be how how it be
S0520	well it's virtually through the middle of the room though isn't it it's not like near the ceiling it's kind of chest height
S0519	no but but it's erm it do go to the wall and onto the bricks but it it doesn't go further
S0520	how do you know
S0519	well because it doesn't come out the other side
S0520	oh
S0519	of the of the wall into the hall into the land
S0520	mm that's true that's true
S0519	and so therefore if it's structural it's structural in rest on that wall
S0520	mm
S0519	which go up from the kitchen
S0520	mm
S0521	mm
S0519	so that must be maybe then a load bear wall
S0520	mm
S0519	maybe they all be in this house and if and if that's true then maybe you can't do anything about it but it's possible you could have it erm tie in some other way with like a metal tie higher up and take the beam out or something like that
S0520	mm mm
S0519	you don't know but you could ask a al engineer to look at it couldn't you
S0521	a shropshire engineer
S0520	a shrupshrual engineer
