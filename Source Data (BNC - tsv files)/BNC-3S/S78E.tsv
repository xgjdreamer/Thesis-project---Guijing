S0230	yeah a little
S0198	oh yeah there be wasn't there
S0230	yeah
S0198	don't think i ever go up there
S0230	the people that be in our house in that's where they move
S0198	oh really
S0230	to one of them yeah
S0198	oh the people before you
S0230	yeah
S0198	oh cos they go from council to council
S0230	mm
S0198	so have you eh not to have much money or in your property by the time you retire they they could put you into old people council house
S0230	yeah well they don't force people though
S0198	no no i mean if you ask to be put in something smaller
S0230	s parent have recently move into a little bungalow
S0198	ah they bungalows up there
S0230	yeah because they obviously they can't do stairs can they as they get old
S0198	ah i didn't realise
S0230	and then she desperately want them to to move into one of these
S0198	yeah
S0230	i mean it's right near where they be before anyway but oh you know old people they get so stubborn when they've live somewhere all their live
S0198	yeah they don't want to move
S0230	no be keep go into hospital keep go into hospital
S0198	yeah i know both of them do be that what her parent be call
S0230	yeah
S0198	and
S0230	yeah
S0198	aw that's classic
S0198	and
S0230	she do manage to erm persuade them in the end with a bite of help from care managers and because they you see because they've always be in council
S0198	mm
S0230	they haven't get a lot of money they get all the help
S0198	yeah i bet they do
S0230	care managers and tenant allowance it's different there's look there's another lane filter in from here
S0229	yeah
S0198	you be better off in not care but in
S0230	not have any money when you're older
S0198	sometimes aren't you i mean it depend there's a fine line
S0230	there be a fine line
S0198	which be with everything in our society really isn't it and there's that fine line between what be
S0198	erm what's what get you quite a lot of help from the government and then get you none at all
S0229	same
S0198	yeah it's the same brick again on that house
S0230	mm
S0198	which make me wonder ah maybe it be council unless it's some more just private house development
S0230	yeah i mean i don't because they don't actually there's not a lot of council properties now they're all house association
S0229	yeah
S0198	oh right be that different then
S0230	yeah
S0198	but the house association provide government house doesn't it
S0230	yeah cheap house
S0198	cheap house yeah because it be on the news this morning wasn't it about ah how much landlords be charge i think you've go up to the shower mum and it be use as an example
S0230	yeah yeah
S0198	and something call a half studio so not even a full studio flat but it's a studio it's they eh show a picture it's a one room with your kitchen in there really small room and your shower be next to your kitchen and it's really tiny and it be in for like eight hundred pound a month
S0229	just crawl out of the bed to get into the shower
S0198	and they be just say that that now you they need to something need to happen where they start regulate price for landlords because it's just become ridiculous
S0230	mm
S0198	and people want you know there be some people slightly will to pay but and apparently the argument be well if you can afford eight hundred a month for rent then you can afford a mortgage but
S0230	disable use gate four
S0198	problem be that
S0229	oy
S0198	you need a massive deposit to have a mortgage up front don't you
S0230	of course you do don't you
S0198	so you need save which people don't have
S0230	yeah
S0198	so it's just become they're say that the house association and what not need to step up and provide more cheap rent accommodation
S0230	accommodation yeah
S0198	it doesn't have to be council or government just cheap affordable rentable accommodation because at the moment the landlords be run the lot
S0230	but accessible to all because at the moment the house association you have to more or less sort of be unemployed and things like that to get
S0198	to even qualify anymore yeah because it's so in demand
S0230	yeah
S0198	so yeah it just need to be more yeah
S0230	or single parent
S0198	yeah
S0230	they get it
S0198	it's just another problem altogether isn't it
S0230	mm
S0198	yeah there need to be a separate bracket that's just affordable accommodations
S0230	i mean because you know and really could do with a bigger property couldn't they
S0198	yeah
S0230	but they can't afford to rent on privately
S0198	no it's a shame isn't it
S0230	they can't doesn't earn enough money for a mortgage
S0198	i didn't realise they weren't in council house
S0230	oh didn't you
S0198	it's i know they get i yeah i didn't i mean i yes i do because i realise when i think i just i guess i hadn't think about it before
S0230	mm
S0198	but because they're in private that mean they're not entitle to the same things be they when they get older
S0230	yeah
S0198	because they're not in council
S0230	no
S0198	but yeah say he's seem pretty set that he's go to probably stay there now though they'll move the girls into the bigger room they'll grow up there and then that'll do
S0230	yeah
S0198	seem such a shame though to spend your entire life rent a property
S0230	mm
S0198	it just seem like such a waste of money
S0230	mm well it be isn't it
S0198	well i i feel like the eh at the end of so many years the landlord should be like oh okay then you've you've you've pay my mortgage now so you can have the property
S0230	aw
S0198	never will will they
S0230	no course they won't
S0198	i'm not my but i mean they could already own the property
S0230	oh yeah they probably could because they they they it's not just they don't just have that one house then his landlord
S0198	no exactly
S0230	they've get more than one house
S0198	yeah
S0230	that they rent out
S0198	most landlords do now don't they
S0230	yeah
S0198	or a lot of them do make a business from it and even though a lot of them be buy up you know it's that when you and dad buy your house when people start really buy their own property didn't they
S0230	mm
S0198	which help the boom you could get house much much cheaper then i'm sure a lot of people have make a tidy profit from it
S0229	they're all come out of the thing see the mud up on some of them wheel
S0198	they already finish do you reckon
S0229	well some come a couple of days before stay and then they go home and you'll see the mud look
S0198	yeah that's true some could've come stay last night couldn't they
S0229	have enough of it because of the wet weather and look it's go to go right up
S0198	god
