S0571	yeah it be very good
S0517	so she have also suggest to and he have follow through that he apply to for his work experience i tell and just go what why there's no real reason for that but the reason that have say that be cos it's a male environment and she want him to be expose to like the banter and the i almost want to say sexism and she just think need to be expose to a bite of rough stuff so that's what she's do she say it'll just be you know carry bits of wood about and sweep the floor
S0571	it won't give him banter cos won't speak
S0517	no won't speak no it won't be
S0571	he'll be bore out of his brain
S0517	and they won't chat to him no
S0571	they won't they'll just ignore him because he doesn't interact
S0517	yeah
S0571	and they might actually be quite mean to him
S0517	well either way she think it'll be a good experience
S0571	might ask him to go and
S0517	thank you
S0571	thank you
S0571	yes thank you
S0571	they might ask him to go and get a can of tartan paint or
S0517	yeah
S0571	a glass hammer

S0572	oh
S0517	oh what
S0572	yeah cos oh no cos it would smash it with like
S0517	yes it will
S0572	look do you think
S0571	or go and ask for a long wait
S0517	yeah
S0572	yeah i get that one as well cos you have to wait for a long time
S0517	that's alright then
S0571	this yes that's great cheer
S0572	yeah that's me thank you
S0571	so i don't think it's a good idea
S0517	anyway that's what he's do at the moment so i don't know where else to apply although she's still very very keen for him to come down to whatever and i say to her that 's probably gonna go to the where there be nowhere for them to stay and they'll probably have to be put up by the manager or possibly a staff caravan
