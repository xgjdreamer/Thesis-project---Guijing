S0012	you're like us
S0013	yeah we're not very good be we
S0152	i mean at the moment my phone be in the only get four hundred and fifty megabytes free
S0012	have it oh my goodness
S0152	but my sim my smart card that's in my phone have get twenty eight gigs free
S0012	twenty eight gigabytes wow that's
S0013	mm
S0012	more my computer
S0152	cos i get a thirty two gig card in here
S0012	wow
S0013	right
S0012	well that cost a fortune that do
S0152	no
S0012	that
S0152	nine pound
S0012	what for for a little old well well you if you try and get them for for a computer they're a lot more expensive
S0152	nine pound for my phone
S0013	oh
S0012	how do you manage that
S0152	tesco's just go to tesco's
S0013	oh gosh
S0012	better get a phone
S0013	dunno
S0152	tesco's
S0012	i mean it's a that's such a job to take photos with our phone innit
S0013	yes yeah
S0012	and that only take two two er what be it thirty two megabytes i think
S0013	five it be
S0012	five
S0152	five
S0013	five erm
S0012	five
S0013	no five oh
S0012	gigabytes
S0013	no
S0152	er
S0013	yeah
S0012	pixels
S0013	pixels
S0012	yeah
S0152	five erm five meg
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0152	i mean most of
S0013	which be not
S0152	like most of the file size on here be one gig no sorry er no not one gig most of the file size on here be two meg or three meg depend on what the quantity of the picture be
S0012	yeah
S0152	erm five if i do one of those let's just that one out let's find the detail of it erm that's nearly one meg so it's point eight eight of a meg
S0013	mm
S0012	well they ain't very big then be they
S0152	mm no
S0012	do they print out any good
S0152	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0152	yeah but what you've get to what you've get to remember be that depend on what the picture be so a normal picture if i take just take a normal picture that hasn't have any enhancement that like let's take the church picture the church picture be nearly two meg and its resolution be two two thousand six hundred and eighty eight by one thousand five hundred and twenty
S0012	wow that's big that be innit
S0152	alright focal length three point eight aperture f two iso rat a hundred and twenty five exposure time one four hundred and thirty seven
S0012	oh wow
S0152	auto white balance contrast so i can change all that on my phone
S0012	yeah
S0152	and it will also tell me where the gps latitude be and longitude

S0152	yeah
S0013	mm nice yeah
S0012	that's a lovely picture
S0013	mm
S0012	megabytes seem but because er er small megabytes you you've get er a bigger pixel rate haven't you
S0152	yeah well this be sixteen sixteen meg
S0012	yeah
S0152	my phone be sixteen megapixels
S0012	yeah
S0152	remember it's not your it it's not the it might be a sixteen meg camera or it might be a thirty two or whatever the sensor be
S0012	yeah
S0152	it doesn't mean the the image be gonna be that large
S0012	no no
S0152	what you've save it as
S0012	no
S0152	because the megapixel on the camera be how many colour that it
S0012	yeah that's right
S0152	it pick up erm but no they print out the print out alright i be talk to the man in the newsagent's cos he er if you don't know if you go in the newsagent's i only go in to get the lottery and occasionally if i'm pass er lot of the that i haven't get but he have two picture on his door and i've always wonder who who take them

S0012	they be lovely though weren't they they be
S0013	oh yes they be
S0012	they be lovely people
S0013	very friendly and nice but you'd think these place would get well they must get check out
S0012	they do now
S0013	as well no they must have do then
S0012	well i don't know
S0013	must have do mm
S0152	yeah they all get check out don't they so but you can always put that thing on to to actually say you know erm when they come and inspect you
S0012	yeah
S0152	isn't it
S0012	well they use to inspect us when we be child mind anyway didn't they
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0152	yeah but
S0013	that's little bite different
S0152	there's people be different aren't they
S0012	yeah
S0013	children you know
S0012	yeah
S0152	you you know you wouldn't you wouldn't
S0013	mm
S0152	just put that up for the inspectors cos they can come back at any time
S0012	they can yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0152	mm so
S0012	mm
S0013	mm
S0012	so what's your criteria for the half term then or the term full term just
S0152	what next when we go back
S0012	yeah
S0152	erm we've get thirteenth be the close date for consultation period
S0012	yeah oh
S0152	for the job
S0013	mm
S0152	and then after the thirteenth decisions will be make then you've get to apply for a position
S0012	you get you gotta reapply
S0152	yeah
S0012	what's the idea of
S0152	show show show an expression of interest
S0012	well what's what's the idea of that
S0152	cos they've gotta make some people redundant
S0012	oh god there'll soon be no teachers they're advertise for teachers or on the television and and make people redundant as well
S0152	yeah
S0012	but er the people they the new teachers come along will get about fifteen to twenty thousand pound and the the older teachers be on a better pay
S0152	well it say between twenty and twenty seven thousand
S0012	be it
S0152	but you get a they but they're also give you a bursary if you're train
S0012	oh i see mm
S0152	but there's there's er i mean the it's i dunno what they're do really i mean our place she's decide that she doesn't want any instructors
S0012	oh what have they all gotta go wow
S0152	so no instructors so they'll all be proper teachers
S0012	oh i see right
S0013	mm
S0012	so do that mean they have to go in for some kind of exams again
S0152	well and instructors have to you have to have your teacher qualification
S0012	yeah
S0152	so so what they're gonna do be turn all those instructors into cover supervisors
S0012	right
S0152	which be what some of them start off as
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	but because they couldn't get staff and they be prepare to stay the power that be make put them on instructor pay rather than
S0012	teachers' pay
S0152	er rather than cover supervisors' pay
S0012	oh right be there much different
S0152	mm yeah probably
S0012	mm
S0152	yeah so
S0013	so what do instructors do
S0152	the same as teachers exactly the same
S0013	oh
S0152	but you can you can pay them less
S0013	right
S0152	there there
S0012	mm yeah
S0152	there be two pay scale
S0013	yeah
S0012	mm
S0152	yeah
S0013	but they're not qualify so
S0152	no
S0013	shouldn't get the same
S0012	no
S0013	mm
S0152	so but it's one way of cut your your cost you see
S0012	yeah it do yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	but atl the big union that don't strike or anything like that load come out today er from their conference absolutely load come out
S0012	yeah
S0152	something like sixty percent of teachers in the first year quit
S0012	do they
S0152	of all new recruit quit
S0013	mm
S0012	crikey
S0152	erm too many too many cover supervisors be be use as in permanent position because they can't get members of staff
S0013	yeah get to
S0152	cover supervisor be suppose to be there for a day's absence of two days' absence
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0152	not for six weeks
S0012	a
S0152	or
S0012	no
S0152	maternity cover or things like that
S0013	mm
S0152	see what happen so there's a there's a fair bite happen in in education at the moment there's a fair bite happen in about education
