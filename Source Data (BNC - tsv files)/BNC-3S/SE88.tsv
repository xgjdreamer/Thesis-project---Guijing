S0083	some of the things that we're gonna have record
S0084	well
S0083	it's really
S0084	don't worry about it
S0083	well i do a little
S0084	well don't
S0083	mm it's all very well you say that
S0084	i i need the money
S0083	tut huh
S0084	work my master plan
S0083	tut well
S0084	to leave the country
S0083	you've be a bite extravagant huh
S0084	what oh recently
S0083	um um with er your money
S0084	well yes but only because you know it's that time of the year where it's birthdays
S0083	yes
S0084	mother's day easter
S0083	i know
S0084	er weddings
S0083	oh i know
S0084	i don't really have a choice and i don't wanna you know don't wanna do things on the cheap all the time
S0083	no no i know i know
S0084	so
S0083	i know it get er it's a pain
S0084	yes
S0083	not have any money
S0084	it's
S0083	i don't like it at all
S0084	very very annoy
S0083	it be
S0084	which one do you want the daffies in
S0083	um i don't know they're a bite big for that i might have to find something else hold your horse
S0084	er nope that's fine just try to help
S0084	i think i get that tax rebate because from it be from work in waterstones they'd take too much tax
S0083	oh that's right
S0084	so i get
S0083	they always take at least two years to
S0084	yeah
S0083	catch up with you
S0084	and they'd um well it be september last year so it would've be for the previous financial year which be when i be work at waterstones
S0083	okay
S0084	so it just take them five months to work it out
S0083	right tut
S0084	um
S0083	it take them about two years to give me my tax back
S0084	some of er some of it be some of it do take that long i think cos obviously you can write to them and say look you er you owe me this money from this job and
S0083	yeah
S0084	um on this date
S0083	yeah
S0084	and they can sort it out more quickly but if it's just a case of you wait your turn
S0083	yeah
S0084	till they get to you then
S0083	yeah
S0084	no it do take a long time
S0083	i suppose that's it
S0084	so that be quite nice
S0083	i'd forget all about it so it be a nice um
S0084	and i wasn't expect it
S0083	bonus
S0084	i just assume that the tax be correct
S0083	yeah
S0084	which obviously be foolish that be a hundred and thirty pound rebate
S0083	mm
S0084	so it could be that i earn this money now and maybe i see some of it later on or i don't i don't know i mean i i speak to our finance team and they say no that's just how much it be
S0083	mm
S0084	you just have to pay tax and national insurance and all the rest of it
S0083	i know
S0084	so it just seem like er you know you you do this work and then you only get half the money for it it's er simply unfair
S0083	well you you don't get half the money you get more than that i mean what what what band be you on tax band
S0084	six four eight nine
S0083	oh no no i don't i don't know what the number mean but you know it's just
S0084	well you can earn up to seven thousand pound basically per
S0083	no no no sorry um you're on the lower rate of tax aren't you
S0084	yeah because i only earn
S0083	yeah
S0084	twenty three grand so
S0083	yeah that's right so
S0084	so you pay twenty per cent tax
S0083	yeah
S0084	but you also pay national insurance on top of that
S0083	yeah
S0084	and student loan
S0083	yeah i mean the thing be you've get several things come out of yours so er
S0084	well out of my salary i've get my
S0083	it just feel like it
S0084	i've get yeah i've get tax national insurance pension and my student loan
S0083	yeah well
S0084	so i've get the my contributions to my pension and and the contributions
S0083	yeah
S0084	so yeah it's a bite um you don't see an awful lot of it even so we think they'd er
S0083	no
S0084	er they'd calculate it incorrectly but no unfortunately it be correct
S0083	mm
S0084	tut um what be you gonna do at least it's better than a poke in the eye and all you're do be record your own conversation so
S0083	fair enough huh
S0084	until it get to the point when people just refuse which er it's not er that far away from now
S0083	mm
S0084	originally it be suppose to be the end of march but they've extend it until the end of april
S0083	mm
S0084	cos they find they have more money to pay people or pay for the record so they've um extend the deadline
S0083	well it give the transcribers a laugh doesn't it
S0084	yeah well i go round to see and last night and 's be one of the transcribers and i do
S0083	oh really oh my god
S0084	i do sort of i just warn him and say if you get any of mine it's basically just me talk about boys the whole time so
S0083	or
S0084	and booze
S0083	or racist joke
S0084	or racist joke
S0084	please don't judge
S0084	please don't judge
S0084	they know me well enough though fortunately and then the people that don't know you well they don't know you
S0083	true
S0084	i'd only be embarrass if it be and i've say to can you er if at all possible make sure it's not
S0083	mm fair enough
S0084	so yeah so er you know it be it's really help
S0083	good huh
S0084	just huh you know luckily be here to help me with my maths when i be work on my master plan huh
S0083	okay
S0084	cos i'd work out that i could only save two hundred pound a month and she work out that it be actually four hundred and ninety eight pound
S0083	oh my god
S0084	or four hundred and seventy eight um
S0083	oh that's really good
S0084	so to round it up to five hundred i'll just have to use the car less so i be budget for my loan go out and food and spend money and
S0083	yeah
S0084	petrol and i'd say to fill up the tank a month be sixty pound so if i only put fifty pound in and don't use it as much
S0083	yeah
S0084	then that should be fine
S0083	yeah
S0084	and quite a lot
S0083	i mean you don't need to use it as much and it's the summer
S0084	i don't need to yeah
S0083	so you should be cycle more
S0084	er yeah i i be and i'm gonna leave the car in the garage on a sunday night rather than you know be lazy and leave it on the drive and then it come to the morning and i think oh i'll just get in the car
S0083	no i think you should put it away
S0084	i'm gonna put it away so it's out of temptation
S0083	absolutely
S0084	plus i work out that my route to work be three and a half miles
S0083	right
S0084	so every day i cycle seven miles
S0083	that's very good
S0084	so per week that's thirty five miles so
S0083	well that's really good
S0084	so that's really good so i need to get back into it
S0083	that's very good exercise for you
S0084	it's really really good yeah er because i never think of it as be that far but er you know it be
S0083	it be
S0084	so yeah so that's good
S0083	it be
S0084	so i need to do that more really stop be lazy huh
S0083	mhm well er er you know if you just drive to work once a week
S0084	yeah or er or the days when i'm go out in the even that's when it usually be
S0083	yeah
S0084	if i'm go out somewhere or if i've think oh i'll come round here for lunch
S0083	yeah exactly
S0084	or whatever
S0083	yeah
S0084	i'll just
S0083	that's different isn't it
S0084	try and not do that really i saw on wednesday when we go to
S0083	mhm
S0084	and she's book her ticket to australia do i tell you
S0083	really
S0084	yeah
S0083	so she's definitely go
S0084	she's definitely go she's go well her job be always gonna finish in june cos she's maternity cover
S0083	right
S0084	it's really cheeky actually the way they've do it cos the woman who go away leave obviously a year ago
S0083	mm
S0084	so she get all of the summer off last year
S0083	oh right yeah
S0084	and then she'll come back and only do half a term
S0083	yeah
S0084	and then have it off again so who have work all year doesn't get um doesn't get pay over the summer but she have to do all the report because she's be work there most of the year
S0083	mm
S0084	so it's pretty pretty unfair on her so she's book her book her ticket for the tenth of june i think she say and then she's off she's fly into of all place i think because there's a tenuous link to somebody or other there
S0083	mhm
S0084	um but that's where they have the flood you know when i be there
S0083	yes they do they certainly do
S0084	so

S0084	huh
S0083	she's an amaze woman
S0084	she be and she take er and i think cos be say you know she's really her mum be be a bite pathetic about the whole thing and i be say well it probably bring back you know horrible horrible memories of of of who know what go on
S0083	yeah
S0084	um when they be in and you know it probably whether she deal with those issue or not er professionally or not i don't know but it's very unfair for to judge her and be someone who will always forgive you know
S0083	yeah
S0084	no matter what um what's go on that you know she do go round
S0083	she's and she's not
S0084	and she do take him card and look after him and she take him
S0083	she do
S0084	in when he have leukaemia and
S0083	i i know and she she doesn't she doesn't want to she want him to just go away but
S0084	yeah
S0083	he won't so she will carry on deal with it
S0084	and he be
S0083	but she'd rather he just you know
S0084	oh absolutely
S0083	disappear
S0084	but she's not gonna ignore him
S0083	no she can't do that she's too good
S0084	mm and er well i think he actually do call the house from the airport um to say i'm here can someone pick me up but er say she didn't wanna put that on and really
S0083	right
S0084	cos he's you know he's er he he's should be able to look after himself you know who's the child in this situation none of them be children but you know who's the who's the parent
S0083	yeah
S0084	so yes
S0083	i expect he just think you know er er er he's do everything er and but i don't the thing be
S0084	he doesn't want to have to be ask
S0083	your grow up children then you know um will do things like that for you
S0084	mm
S0083	but not if you've be
S0084	if you've mistreat them and haven't earnt their
S0083	abusive and er you know
S0084	well er have always say
S0083	er a really crap father they're not gonna feel like do it be they
S0084	well particularly because you know it's really highlight with and you know
S0083	yeah
S0084	that she and her dad don't have a great relationship and it's really difficult with him in the house cos he hat kid and obviously there's three of them live there you think
S0083	god just she should just tell them to go
S0084	just well she should tell say to julie take him cos they're rich and they've get load of space
S0083	i know
S0084	tut but she never would and that's that's really highlight to she say always say you know if if it be ever necessary er she would never take in
S0083	no
S0084	and why should she feel oblige to just because he's her dad he's never in her eye she's not he's not earnt the right
S0083	no i know and that's er it come down to
S0084	i don't know er um what and would do
S0083	and you so you know er he might expect his grow up children to look after him but they're not go to want to do it
S0084	no they might feel a sense of duty er or or maybe not
S0083	i think i think er probably would
S0084	certainly take him in and she certainly be the one to deal with his his mania on a day to day basis so
S0083	yeah
S0084	and you think she's get a family of her own it probably do put quite a lot of strain on
S0083	it do
S0084	her and 's relationship
S0083	i'm sure it do
S0084	so huh yeah it's just er i mean he's it's always gonna be a mess
S0083	terrible situation
S0084	as far as he's concern and it's amaze that he's even still you know still lucid in any sense you know he's be drink for what thirty years so cos he's younger than dad isn't he
S0083	he's have cancer twice
S0084	he's have yeah
S0083	huh er
S0084	they've basically say their goodbyes to him twice when be move to er that be when he have his last health scare when he have
S0083	yeah
S0084	er the cancerous cells and he be say well that's it it's my time which be er an abominable thing to say to your children because then they do prepare themselves
S0083	yeah
S0084	um it's yeah it's it's nasty and er
S0083	oh dear huh
S0084	and of course there's no rule book on how you're suppose to feel i think that's it she she beat herself up about feel a certain way and her and your opinions change you know she she judge her mum quite harshly and then er other time you speak to her and she's she see it more from her mum's point of view and obviously it's always gonna be
S0083	i mean her mum be a certain kind of character tut
S0084	yeah
S0083	that you're probably not gonna get anymore i think she's probably a one off
S0084	mm

S0084	she's a very good person yeah i think er cos be say well i dunno i've get to the point where she now
S0083	and a bite selfless
S0084	now stand up to him what do it have to take to kick him out the house and i say well she's just not get it in her nature
