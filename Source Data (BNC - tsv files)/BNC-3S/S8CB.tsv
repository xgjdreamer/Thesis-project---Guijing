S0592	right so basically er he he be the which
S0592	i i know it's it's italian cos like he be in the mafia basically
S0593	oh okay
S0592	and and what the what the do it's really cool erm because there's two no there's more than two side in this game but for simplicity we'll say there's two side
S0593	what's the game call
S0592	town of salem
S0593	oh yeah you've be play that for years haven't you
S0592	no not years for a while like
S0593	but that's that's the one isn't it where you you have to like hunt out who be do the murder or yeah i know
S0592	yeah and it's fun cos each time you play the game you get a random role so you you know what your role be but no one else do and no one else know each other's each other's roles except members of the mafia and vampires
S0593	yeah okay
S0592	erm but basically what a do be it's like it's like the mafia's version of the investigator because the investigator be a town role
S0593	yeah
S0592	and the investigator what they can do be they check a target each night and they can find two or three possible roles that that target be so for example if a target be a serial killer see there's load of roles but if the target be a serial killer the investigator would get your target cover in blood they're either a doctor a vampire or a serial killer
S0593	oh charm
S0592	so you you have to guess which one they be base on like other people get information erm but the what they can do be they can get the exact role
S0593	yeah
S0592	so they they're more powerful than the investigator but they're also on the bad side so
S0593	ah not so good
S0592	but they can
S0593	didn't you always use to get kill off in this though really early
S0592	not not all the time i i have bad luck yesterday though i i have some weird game i have one game where they're i think they be use bots or something
S0593	use what
S0592	bots
S0593	bots
S0592	yeah
S0593	as in robots
S0592	yeah so someone be use a bot or something and they be do something weird like i dunno if they be hack or whatever but they be do something weird with the game
S0593	mm
S0592	and basically there's this role call the mayor which might be obvious cos it's a town but erm what the mayor can do because when the investigator investigate the mayor it come up as mayor godfather or vampire hunter and if you know people generally they want the major to reveal themselves cos otherwise they're likely to be the godfather and the godfather's a member of the mafia
S0593	it just seem like one role have so many different roles within it
S0592	no not really what what's confuse you
S0593	everything
S0592	okay
S0592	well i i don't i don't i don't see how you think one role have load of different roles what
S0593	well you've just say that something come up and it can be the three different things
S0592	yeah erm that that's the the investigator the investigator investigate the mayor
S0593	yeah
S0592	the mayor will appear to the investigator as either the mayor the godfather or the vampire hunter because the mayor doesn't get the exact role
S0593	okay
S0592	which be why the major have to reveal themselves to prove that they're actually good and not the godfather
S0593	okay so what's actually what's the best role to have
S0592	oh it it it depend on what you like to do erm personally i like to be the spy the spy be quite fun
S0593	be it
S0592	what the spy can do be they can read mafia chat but they can't actually see who the members of the mafia be cos that would just be overpower
S0593	be that like helpful at all
S0592	it be it be helpful erm because you can if you're if you're quite good i think i'm quite good as be the spy but you can kind of see how people type and then compare it to people type during the day
S0593	yeah
S0592	so if you if you think someone's type a certain way you think oh i've be read mafia chat this person type exactly like someone in the mafia i think they're a member of the mafia
S0593	yeah okay
S0592	that have work
S0593	yeah
S0592	also some people be a bite silly probably cos they're new and sometimes they end up say their name not realise that there's a spy in the game
S0593	have you ever do that
S0592	i've i've do i haven't do that i have do something stupid though erm
S0592	erm basically one time the godfather get jail the first night and i go oh no the godfather's jail and there be a spy and they say whoever you jail first night be the godfather i'm like
S0592	i be like i i i shouldn't do that again i should just have a poker face and not say anything
S0593	i think what you be say about erm watch how people type i think people do type and text in in their own style it's almost like erm their voice
S0592	yeah i
S0593	they're voice but in
S0592	yeah
S0593	text
S0592	yesterday yesterday be funny because erm i be actually an executioner and the executioner be
S0593	boo hiss
S0592	the executioner be a neutral role but the a neutral evil role so
S0593	how can you be a neutral and evil at the same time
S0592	because because erm i'm try to think the the executioner can win with anyone as long as they get their target lynch but the target be always a member of the town that's why they're evil
S0593	okay it just seem a bite screwy to me but go on i'll i'll
S0592	they they they're neutral because they don't really have allegiances with anyone in particular just they just have a vendetta against that one person that they want to get lynch
S0593	okay
S0592	erm that's why they're neutral and that's why they're evil at the same time because they're try to get a member of the town lynch yeah but i i be an executioner and i notice that someone have spell their name wrong in the game and then i look cos when when people kill they can leave a death note
S0593	oh right
S0592	that appear
S0593	yeah
S0592	erm and i notice that in the death note they have spell something incorrectly they spell only as onely basically
S0592	i don't know i don't know i don't know if their first language be english
S0593	well maybe not
S0592	maybe not but
S0593	maybe they're more dyslexic than i be
S0592	maybe but i i be half joke but half not joke and i basically say i basically say oh you know they misspell this in their death note and this person can't spell their name coincidence i think not erm and and and some people be kind of with me and then someone say that that's a stupid you know stupid what what's the blueugh phrase i'm look for
S0593	theory
S0592	no it's a stupid line of reason that's what i be look for
S0593	oh okay
S0592	and i didn't think it be erm but then that person the person i be accuse get kill by a veteran erm and then it turn out they they're with the mafioso so i be completely correct even though i be completely bullshit
S0593	yay
S0594	oh yeah er by the way er
S0592	yeah
S0594	just just just a warn just in case my mood be shit for the next i don't know how long while the side effect of the antidepressants kick in
S0593	okay
S0594	so yeah er sorry if i'm a bite moody
S0593	be that what she warn you might happen it might get worse before it get better
S0594	yeah i mean that that's what happen the first time i take them
S0593	mm
S0594	er the subsequent time i take them it wasn't so bad but this be the biggest gap that i've have between be off them and on them again so
S0593	okay so what what warn do she give you about it
S0594	she say that er
S0593	cos it sound like quite a new med
S0594	it it's exactly the same type of med that i be on before
S0593	yeah
S0594	erm so it i i don't think it work any differently
S0593	yeah
S0594	erm yeah she just say that i might feel a bite nauseous in the first few days which didn't ever actually happen to me before and that erm er my level of you know agitation and anxiety will will probably go up er i think
S0593	yeah so it's gonna get worse before it get better
S0592	yeah
S0593	okay well
S0592	but that should only last a couple of weeks if if that
S0593	just just be aware that you know if you're be a complete and utter pillock that you will need to be tell to calm down
S0594	oh yeah i know
S0593	and you know to go up to your room not send up to your room like a naughty little boy but somewhere where you can calm down so hopefully you'll be on top of it by christmas
S0594	hopefully it's only
S0593	yeah it's gonna be
S0594	it's only nine days
S0593	yeah it's gonna be erm
S0594	need to get some wrap paper actually
S0593	oh yeah but i can't see any that i like
S0594	mm dunno where have you look
S0593	sainsbury's
S0594	yeah
S0593	get some didn't you
S0592	wrap paper
S0593	yeah
S0592	well i pick it i didn't buy it
S0593	no i know you didn't buy it i think erm possibly bhs normally have nice wrap or it do last year anyway have nice wrap paper
S0594	have to have to have to ask dad to fund that cos i've get no money i'll have some next week hopefully
S0593	well that'll be plenty of time won't it
S0594	when the come back in
S0593	yeah that that'll be in time he's gonna send me some money for a taxi tomorrow
S0594	that's good
S0593	well it be it would have be better if he'd have just be able to drive in the morning but he's out for his christmas do with his friends so
S0592	yeah but that doesn't mean that at least he's give you a way to get there instead of just
S0593	oh yeah yeah no no that's fine he's go to pay for a taxi for me so you know
S0592	that's yeah that's fine
S0593	yeah that's that's fine
S0594	yeah yeah that's fine yeah yeah that's fine
S0593	but it doesn't look that difficult to get to on the bus actually
S0594	what to you'd probably have to change bus wouldn't you
S0593	yeah but i mean all tell the journey take about forty minutes if the bus and that turn up on time
S0592	i would just take a taxi personally
S0594	what do you do do you get do you get the bus into
S0593	oh no i'll take a taxi tomorrow i i won't take the chance then
S0594	what what what do you do do do you get the bus into and then change there or get on the number four
S0593	no erm opposite way bus into
S0594	oh
S0593	and then get the bus erm i think it say the bus head towards of all place
S0594	oh okay
S0593	erm the bus bus go into erm oops into so but yeah no i will definitely get a taxi tomorrow i'm not take chance of be late or what have you or like a drown rat when i get there
S0592	mm
S0593	but i be speak to you your dad about you know when i go back to work have help to get there and back because it be no fun stand at bus stop at minus eight degrees in the morning
S0592	ah no no no
S0593	no i i you know it's dark and its cold and there's snow on the grind and i use to go i use to have to get the bus from out here about ten past seven no before that i use to leave here at five to seven get the bus at seven and then i'd get down to and i'd have wait half an hour in minus eight degrees with erm snow on the grind for the next bus to turn up then when i get off at the other end i would have to walk ten to fifteen minutes up the hill to get into work that be
S0592	that that be
S0593	but it's
S0592	sound like it suck
S0593	it do suck it be hard work and then on the way back because the bus stop run in the village at seven o'clock and i didn't finish work until eight i'd have to walk about two or three miles i think it's three miles from erm the care home into wait at the bus stop for twenty minutes at the erm bus er bus stop in hope it turn up on time and then get get back here so it would take me about an hour to get back to get home in the even
S0592	mm
S0593	so it actually be about forty minutes all tell on the bus include all bus journey you know completely
S0592	what this one now or
S0593	the the one now
S0592	okay
S0593	yeah so it should actually be quicker
S0592	yeah isn't even though it's further away isn't it
S0593	erm no it's just it's slightly further away but even so it would be nice if erm if your dad could manage to just get out of bed a little bite earlier cos even though it mean he's get out of bed a bite earlier it also mean that i can stay in bed half an hour later and when you've be do twelve hour shift on on your feet all day that extra half an hour make a big difference
S0592	mm i mean i know i haven't be do twelve hour shift or anything but that's one thing i'm gonna miss about live on campus second year be the fact that i can have extra sleep and it only take me fifteen minutes to get to to my lessons at most but when i'm gonna be live off campus i'm gonna have to get up early actually walk to the bus stop wait for the bus get a bus there and then i'm not go to just be able to go back in between lessons to have a nap
S0593	yeah or or just grab your lunch or something no that that be a nice thing cos i remember work work live in the nurse home when i be work at and it be nice to be able to just go back and get what you need you know have your lunch or have a half an hour's kip between
S0592	yeah
S0593	you know your shift and what have you if you have time to have that because it be often so busy on the ward you often didn't actually get a break
S0592	yeah
S0593	you know i mean legally you we're suppose to have a break but you often didn't have a break there's erm an in house joke about nurse have bladders like bin liners because they wait so long to go for a pee cos they never get time to go
S0592	no
S0593	you know so you you go hours and hours and hours i know that i have go on duty and i've be there at half past six in the morning because of the way the bus have be run down the road i've be there at half past six no at seven to start at half seven i think it be and it's be some some days it's be like two two o'clock in the afternoon before i've even get near a toilet
S0592	mm
S0593	you know i've be bust to go but you just get kind of use to it i suppose
S0592	yeah probably
S0593	but then sometimes you end up with pain in your tummy you know those horrible pain you get in your tummy when you you need to go
S0592	yeah
S0593	when you're bust for a wee
S0592	yeah
S0593	it and then other days other days you're like no i can't wait any longer and you've just get to go
S0592	mm
S0593	but yeah so hopefully anyway get backtrack to what we be say hopefully your dad'll help me out get there and back
S0592	hopefully
S0593	because when when you know like on bank holiday and what have you when the bus weren't run that early in the morning i use to have to pay about fifteen quid to get to get to work
S0592	that's a lot
S0593	it's a lot of money to get to work that's like three hours' pay
S0592	mm
S0593	you know so i might as well i say to them i say i might as well just not come in until ten o'clock
S0592	weren't they alright with that though didn't didn't they say that be okay
S0593	no no no no you can't you can't do that they be alright for me to get in erm and a a sunday erm the bus be they start late but i be only oh actually how late be i no i i i end up about half an hour late
S0592	oh okay
S0593	erm on on a sunday and they be okay with that but a lot of the time somebody would see me stand at the bus stop that be drive there and they they would pick me up
S0592	mm oh okay
S0593	erm and get in the car but sometimes i wouldn't get a lift it be sometimes i wouldn't actually get in the car because there be a lot of erm there'd be too many people in the car already and most of them weren't strap in or you know even if there be room in the car a lot of the they didn't strap in and i won't get in a car where people be not wear seat belt
S0592	mm
S0593	you know it it's dangerous very very dangerous so i won't but yeah hopefully we'll see
S0592	mm
S0593	we'll see what happen i haven't get the job yet
S0592	no but it's good to think ahead maybe try and think more optimistically
S0593	i have be so optimistic i mean i've be for interview and one one man say to me he say you've handle he say thank you for be very open and honest about what's go on he say and you have handle yourself with complete grace and dignity which i think be a really nice thing to say
S0592	yeah
S0593	guy i speak to on the phone didn't get that job erm but i think i didn't get that job because i have too many skills
S0592	what so they think you're overqualified
S0593	i'm definitely overqualified even for this one i'm overqualified
S0592	yeah it kinda suck though because i i appreciate that employers don't want people who be overqualified cos maybe they feel that they won't be challenge enough or something like that
S0593	yeah
S0592	but er obviously they're look for a job they're desperate for a job if they're look for position where they're overqualified so i i don't know it it feel i i understand but also feel not that fair either
S0593	yeah because you also know that they can do the job
S0592	yeah and instead you're gonna
S0593	yeah and they would be good at it
S0592	instead you're gonna be hire someone who isn't as qualify but you think maybe won't get as bore i don't know if that's their think
S0593	actually you know that's that's a very good point because the guy that i be just tell you about he say to me when he employ somebody there's get to be a two way street he say you you have get to have something that you can offer us he say and i'm not go to even go to insult you ask you what skills you have he say because your skills be obviously in abundance he say your skills be come out of your ears he say you have more than enough skills to do this job he say but the other side of the coin i have to have something to offer the erm offer you
S0592	yeah
S0593	other other than a job
S0592	yeah
S0593	and he say and i don't know what i've get to offer you
S0592	i know i mean i don't know i i i think it be too late to apply for any temporary job here anyway so i haven't bother erm but you you you know how people say oh no one's too good to work in mcdonald's or something like that
S0593	yeah
S0592	i mean i mean there's an obvious reason why i wouldn't but
S0593	i've never hear that but carry on
S0592	i i've hear it a lot of time i mean there's there's one obvious reason why i wouldn't work in mcdonald's now erm
S0593	you're not spotty enough
S0592	erm that's not what i be think but
S0593	slap my wrist
S0592	yeah but but but okay yeah okay
S0593	i i be only joke i be only yeah i didn't mean it
S0592	but i would i would feel i would get so bore
S0593	yeah
S0592	if i be to work in mcdonald's i i don't i don't know it's not that i think i'm too good er er that might be a bite of a lie but erm cos obviously a job's a job and if you work in mcdonald's you know you're earn money
S0593	see now that's the way to look at it and that's the way i have to look at it with do these care home job you know a a a job's a job and if it bring you in a bite more money and a bite more freedom you you've just get to deal with it haven't you until something better come along
S0592	yeah but i yeah i don't think i would work in mcdonald's though i wouldn't apply to work at mcdonald's
S0593	sometimes you have to start right at the bottom and work your way up
S0592	i know i'm just say i i would apply sooner to go and work in a grocery store rather than at mcdonald's
S0593	i would be actually quite happy to work in a grocery store
S0592	why don't you apply for job at grocery store
S0593	cos i do one of their stupid online assessment things that say to me no
S0592	oh oh i hate i hate
S0593	actually i should get you to do the tesco's one with me
S0592	you that's not well you're not mean to you're mean to do it on your own
S0593	yeah i know that but
S0592	no no but the thing be right i do it one time do it fine you know i get the interview at
S0592	i be think i be think that's sainsbury's erm i get i get the interview at the one at obviously i didn't get the job erm i don't know why i don't know if i do something wrong or cos he be say that he didn't want me get too catch up try to work and also study so maybe he be consider that as well
S0593	i i actually would agree with you on that one i think he be because he do sound to me like he be erm look at what be best for you as well
S0592	yeah it be a bite disappoint but i'm over it but anyway i then later on i apply for one erm like a little express store and i apply for one the answer from the questionnaire have be save from my time before so i just put those in
S0593	yeah
S0592	and then they say oh you haven't reach the interview stage cos your question weren't good enough my
S0593	yeah i i've read online about erm about their interview things but
S0592	it it
S0593	one one girl say that she send in those answer so many time and she change her answer so many time and you know so they be completely different and she still didn't get get in yet her friend who put the same answer get in
S0592	it it's stupid they must do it randomly and that that that that's unfair though because oh i i don't know it's it's just frustrate because i know they need some sort of filter system so they don't have so many people come for interview and things but just because i might have fail this questionnaire doesn't mean that i'm gonna be a bad worker
S0593	exactly
S0592	but all i don't know how they would combat that but besides the fact that i get an interview with a set of question then enter the exact same set of question and then fail be a bite fishy
S0593	it's ridiculous yeah it's ridiculous isn't it
S0592	i i don't know what they expect people to do if they get an interview with one set of answer and then get reject with the same set of answer well what do you want what do you want from me
S0593	i know i know
S0592	i think i'm just gonna try and get do some volunteer or try and get an internship
S0593	yeah
S0592	you know psychology relate try and get experience with that rather than look for particular for a pay job because i'm gonna need experience erm and a lot of experience if i want to try and apply for a postgraduate
S0593	yeah
S0592	so i
S0593	i think actually i think that's a very sensible idea
S0592	i i i need to focus on that first
S0593	yeah
S0592	erm i mean i do see a few that be quite cool do i tell you about that one about the brain erm the it's a shame because it look really interest but i don't think i'm experience enough for it
S0593	i think you mention it yeah
S0592	one about erm someone i i don't remember the exact thing they be do neuroimaging
S0593	mm
S0592	and f m fmri i'm not sure what fmri be erm but it's a way it's a way of i guess image the brain or view the brain
S0593	yeah
S0592	but they say one of the requirements be that you need good knowledge of the anatomy of the brain and i don't
S0593	well you have haven't you
S0592	no n i'd love to learn it and i could look in my biopsychology book and try and remember things cos i remember when i be do one of my web base assessments erm i look at the biopsychology book i be look at the page and i think wow this be really really interest
S0593	mm
S0592	like i get you you know
S0593	yeah
S0592	the developmental one be okay but developmental psychology really isn't what interest me i just find it really interest when they be talk about the areas of the brain and like how different things be connect
S0593	yeah and that's why you wanna do neuro yeah
S0592	yeah that's why it's interest me
S0593	do you think do you think you'd be more interest now than rather than cos when you go into this you be all for the sort of counsel side of it
S0592	mm
S0593	in help particularly people with anxiety depression stuff like that do you think now you because you're more interest in the neuropsychology that you would be more interest in the research
S0592	i think so
S0593	yeah
S0592	because yeah even now i wouldn't be well i i i could be work directly with people actually because i would need participants for the research but you know research can do a hell of a lot of good in help you know erm one of the lecturers i think yeah one of the lecturers he he do a lot of research into alzheimer's and you know he be he be tell us about his research and i think that's interest you know and it's quite valuable the research they're do into alzheimer's because they've they've kind of figure out the mechanisms of why people get alzheimer's so they're obviously they're still work on a way to prevent it and they're develop drug but the fact that they know why people develop the symptoms be good
S0593	oh yeah and what why be that then
S0592	er i'm try to remember exactly what it be i know that there's these things call beta amyloid plaques
S0593	okay
S0592	basically er there's a protein i can't remember the name of it though it it i think the the abbreviation i think be app let me look it up app amyloid precursor protein that's it erm
S0593	okay
S0592	and
S0593	i have no clue what that mean but
S0592	it's it's just it's just a protein basically erm what happen be that i can't remember i can't remember the different enzymes and i should because i learn these but i can't remember them at the minute basically normal people without alzheimer's erm an enzyme er chop up app and then the fragment get transport out or like like they're they're not stick in the brain but with people with alzheimer's a different enzyme chop the app protein and that cause different shape fragment that can't be break down properly and so the
S0593	so where do this different component come from to what make that change
S0592	oh i don't know i'm sorry
S0593	okay well no i just wonder if if this have already be find in the research you be say your tutor whatever he be be do
S0592	i i don't i don't know exactly where the other protein come not other protein other enzyme come from so that's what happen
S0593	yeah
S0592	the fragment can't be break down and so they kind of aggregate together and form a pack and that prevent signal
S0593	from get through
S0592	get through effectively so that's one thing
S0593	so why i wonder then i'm not ask if you know the answer to this i'm just wonder now i wonder then how that affect people be stick in the past you know when when they get like dementia
S0592	mm
S0593	how you know a thing be because they it's like their short term memory
S0592	yeah
S0593	be non existent but their long term memory's fantastic
S0592	yeah i i i think that's what it be i think i don't know why but basically their short term memory's severely affect but they're they're still very very good at remember long term events so that's probably why they think or they act like as if they're in the past because they can't remember what happen recently but they can remember what happen years and years ago
S0593	yeah some of them can't remember what happen five minutes ago
S0592	oh
S0593	you know they they have no no idea and it also i don't know how true this be but when i be erm when i be nurse i get tell or we we get teach that one of the really sad things about it be it can completely change a person's personality
S0592	yeah it can
S0593	so like if you get somebody who would normally be very sweet and very kind and very gentle can actually become quite violent and it's just not like them and that obviously must be
S0592	yeah
S0593	very very distress and uncomfortable and it it must be heartbreaking for families to live through this
S0592	yeah
S0593	because they're memories because they get stick sometimes way way back they don't always remember even recent people in their live like their children or their husband or what have you i work with erm look after a man and his poor wife be like a saint
S0592	mm
S0593	and he know she be his wife but he think she be his first wife
S0592	oh okay
S0593	and that must have be really hard for her
S0592	mm
S0593	but he use to tell me all these stories scotsman he be and he have this really broad scots accent and he use to be a shepherd up in the hill and he use to play the bagpipes and he say the sheep love the bagpipes and he say that they use to follow him round like the pied piper
S0592	mm
S0593	and he's go home and he'd take the sheep back to the house with him and all the sheep would be like come in and in the lounge and things like that and his mum'd be go mad say all tho er all these sheep be shit all over my
S0593	all over my floor get these bloody sheep out of here and you know it he use to tell some very funny stories but yeah occasionally he he recognise his wife for who she be but a lot of the time he think she be his first wife
S0592	mm
S0593	you know which be i i find very sad
S0592	yeah it be sad it it make sense that people's personalities will change or might change obviously they don't always have to but consider the fact that signal be be block they can't go through properly it make sense that there's go to be change to her personality there's also another thing within the neuron in the brain you know what a neuron be yeah
S0593	yeah yeah i know what a neuron be
S0592	well i'm just i'm just
S0593	yeah no that's fine
S0592	i'm i'm not try to patronise you or anything
S0593	no just carry on
S0592	but i i just want to make sure we're on the same page before i start explain things
S0593	no you on sixteen and i'm on thirty four
S0592	that's that's you're imply that i'm stupid
S0593	yeah go on carry on
S0592	right erm within the neurons there's erm microfibrils i think i pronounce it correctly microfibrils erm which i don't know how to explain what they be but basically they help transport erm materials throughout the neuron
S0593	okay
S0592	erm like they transport help transport signal and different the different what's the word ions i'd say that generate action potentials throughout
S0593	yeah
S0592	throughout the neuron erm these micro fibrils they get the
S0593	easy for you to say
S0592	it's one it's one of those weird word erm
S0593	one of those ones you can say quite clearly in your head but you just cannot get out pass the tip of your tongue
S0592	yeah
S0593	yeah
S0592	but these i i'll try and say it again micro fibrils
S0593	yeah
S0592	no i've mess up the end oh well erm
S0593	never mind those things
S0592	those things
S0593	yeah
S0592	they get tangle and so things can't be transport properly
S0593	well with a name like that it's quite understandable isn't it
S0592	ah they they get tangle and so
S0593	yeah
S0592	materials ions and proteins they can't be transport properly i i feel like i can't speak english today erm they can't be transport sake
S0593	properly
S0592	properly ha they can't be transport throughout the neuron
S0593	uhu
S0592	and so the neuron end up die
S0593	oh
S0592	so there's billions and billions of neurons in our brain but you know if they start die
S0593	well it depend at you know you might well think oh there's billions and billions and it's gonna take an awful long time for you to get through billions and billions but it depend like how many die at once doesn't it
S0592	yeah and also
S0593	if if if you say they start die and they start die like one one at at a time one an hour
S0592	oh i i don't know the rate
S0593	it it it might be like they're die by their thousands
S0592	i i don't know the rate at which they die i i mean i assume i don't know because alzheimer's and dementia be be slow slow onset
S0593	yeah it's insidious yeah
S0592	so so i don't think they must die thousands and thousands at a time but they must die at quite a quick rate for you know there such to be such a deterioration over the years erm yeah so
S0593	and there be stag to it as well
S0592	yeah yeah we do erm we be look at alzheimer's in a seminar as well and we watch some videos on it that's that's how i remember about the different like the beta amyloid plaques and the er i think i can't say the word i know it in my head but i can't say it properly neurofibrillary tangle
S0593	okay
S0592	i i don't know what it be about that word that i just can't say you just get word sometimes don't you that you just can't say properly
S0593	you do you do and then you know in a day or two's time it might just trip off your tongue
S0592	yeah yeah
S0593	no but it what i could never understand be why alzheimer's and dementia be different
S0592	because
S0593	i mean the effect be the same
S0592	yeah but i think it's cos you can get dementia or alzheimer's oh i'm try to think alzheimer's be like a cause of dementia but you can get dementia from other things as well as alzheimer's
S0593	yeah
S0592	so i i i guess i guess that's the difference because just cos someone have dementia doesn't mean they have alzheimer's you can the
S0593	so so many erm contribute factor and different type of dementia as well
S0592	yeah i mean the the main difference with some type of dementia and alzheimer's in that alzheimer's be irreversible but you can get some type of dementia where if there's a particular physical symptom that you can identify you can reverse it
S0593	can you i didn't know that
S0592	yeah no there be some type of dementia where that be the case i i i find that interest actually erm
S0593	oh i i do not know that
S0592	erm but not with alzheimer's cos alzheimer's be specifically what be i talk about with the amyloid plaques and things
S0593	coconut oil be mean to be erm and see the thing with coconut oil be a lot of people speak very very highly of it and what it do for your body and your mind and blah blah blah but there aren't there hasn't be actually any proper in depth study do on it
S0592	yeah just
S0593	but however it be actually mean to some people have say erm to have a great effect on reverse the effect of dementia
S0592	i'm not so i'm i'm read up i'm read up on it now this be a website call alzheimer's dot org dot uk so i trust it because it's get org in it so that's
S0593	dot uk yeah
S0592	yeah er that that's what we be teach in primary school if it's get org in it it's a trustworthy website erm
S0593	right
S0592	so i i think so basically it say that there have be some claim that coconut oil could be use as a treatment or even a cure i doubt it
S0593	no i'm not say a cure
S0592	but this be just what the website be say
S0593	yeah
S0592	erm for alzheimer's disease however there be currently not enough experimental evidence to back up these claim
S0593	which be exactly what i've just say isn't it
S0592	i know i'm just reaffirm what you be say
S0593	yeah
S0592	erm it it be say the claim be base on the theory that the neurons erm in the brain of people with alzheimer's disease be unable to use glucose to produce energy properly and therefore starve and the theory be that coconut oil might act as an alternative energy source but there be not enough scientific evidence to know for sure whether this be the case erm and there be a clinical trial be conduct in the us
S0593	oh
S0592	it say the result of this clinical trial be due to be announce in mid two thousand seventeen
S0593	oh oh
S0594	be be be the dog not get any tea today
S0593	er i suppose we do say we would take the dog out so you really need to get dress and you need to take her o u t down the road

S0592	they're quite nice they're yeah it's nice not have to worry about get my jeans dirty
S0593	mm
S0592	oh shall we shall we go back to talk about the game cos
S0593	if you wish
S0592	erm
S0593	yeah no that's fine
S0592	erm i'm try to remember what point we get to though before
S0593	i can't remember because as always as in any conversation we end up digress
S0592	yeah well that's fine erm oh what do we talk about i maybe i'll i'll talk er oh yeah i think we talk about how get a good role that he his thing
S0593	oh yeah
S0592	glitched and that be really annoy because it be a it's a really fun role the
S0593	say it say it again
S0592	i think i think that's how it's pronounce
S0593	i have no idea it just sound very cute
S0592	yeah erm most people they abbreviate it to which be easier to remember
S0593	understandably
S0592	yeah erm which be a shame but then the next game he get he be a jester and the jester's a bite weird cos the jester what they're try to do
S0593	be right up 's street then
S0592	i be i be give tip on how to play it but he say no no i can't do that no cos i think he be bite self conscious erm basically what the jester want to do be they're the ones who want to get lynch so basically what they what they want to do
S0593	why why would somebody want to be lynch be they depress or something
S0592	no they're crazy erm basically what what the jester be mean to do be they're mean to trick the town into think that they're a bad person so they get lynch and then what the jester do be once they've be lynch they can haunt someone and kill them
S0593	no no no that's not good
S0592	it's a fun it's a fun role to play it's so great when people actually think your bad and then you get lynch and then ha ha screw you guy and then you just kill someone
S0593	can you can you only kill one person
S0592	yeah and they have to they have to
S0593	so do you do you always want to kill the one that's get on your nerve the most
S0592	there be there be this one person that i'm try to remember exactly what happen erm oh i'm try to remember what my name be in this game because it's quite pertinent to the story erm i think i think my name might have be lamp i might have call myself lamp in this game
S0593	do you change your name every time
S0592	yeah you can if you want erm for some reason i like to call myself piece of furniture like i've be chair i've be lamp i've be table
S0593	weird weird girl
S0592	yeah some people have weird name weirder than mine
S0593	i have a weird daughter
S0592	it's fine erm but i think my name be lamp and i get very lucky actually i get very lucky with the circumstances cos what have happen be i think people be suspicious of me anyway i don't know why i can't remember why but they be suspicious of me anyway but they didn't really have much evidence so what happen be the werewolf attack me but i get heal by a doctor so i didn't die but what what happen be cos i need to explain what the werewolf do what the werewolf do be they attack someone and then anyone who visit the person they attack also get kill so for example because the werewolf attack me the doctor visit me visit me to heal me and so the doctor die because they visit me do that make sense
S0593	okay so you're a bite like a virus
S0592	kind of basically they just attack anyone who visit their target as well erm and but also what the werewolf can do be stay at home and then anyone who visit them get attack
S0593	okay
S0592	and so basically what happen be i get attack by a werewolf but i get heal by the doctor so i didn't die but the doctor die instead and i think a sheriff or someone else also die because they visit me to check me and what it look like it look like i be a werewolf who star at stay at home and then kill the people who visit me
S0593	yeah i be gonna stay
S0592	and so people people be like oh you're obviously the werewolf and i tell them the truth i say oh maybe i get heal by the doctor and the werewolf attack me i be actually tell the truth but i be tell it in a way that make it sound like i be maybe lie or try to bullshit them
S0593	yeah
S0592	but i be tell the truth though but erm what happen be erm i say you know guy you know doctor heal me it's not my fault the werewolf attack me i'm not the werewolf erm and this one person say lamps be trash they do they they just yell out lamps be trash and i say oh lamps be trash be they well let's see how you like this and then i end up kill them
S0593	oh
S0592	cos they lynch me
S0593	no no no i think i think you're a secret psychopath
S0592	it's fun it's fun be the jester i do like it it's always annoy though because sometimes you can get kill at night and you're not mean to get kill at night as jester cos you don't win that way you have to get lynch erm you can get kill at night by the mafia or a serial killer or even a werewolf like one of them try to do erm but i think the werewolf might have end up win that game actually which be good erm cos they help me out unintentionally but they help me out
S0593	yeah
S0592	erm oh what be i just
S0593	just turn the light on can't see you
S0592	what be i just say oh
S0593	erm you be say
S0592	oh no i be talk about get kill at night wasn't i
S0593	yeah
S0592	it's annoy as jester sometimes because you can get kill at night without actually have a chance to get yourself lynch and that's just annoy that's just bad luck it happen
S0593	seem to me like all character have get their good and their not so good point to them
S0592	yeah oh i have such bad luck yesterday cos i get the werewolf like three time i think
S0593	mm
S0592	erm and werewolf i find werewolf a fun role and one time what i'd manage to do be lay low the entire game because i have just stay at home and no one have visit me on full moon so i didn't attack anyone so no one know that there be a werewolf in the game so i just
S0593	so do they not have the same character in each each game
S0592	no erm cos there's this game mode call all any and basically the role be just there's any so there can be any combination of roles
S0593	oh okay
S0592	so erm that's my favourite one because you can get so many different combinations it's quite fun
S0593	yeah it make it a bite more challenge wouldn't it
S0592	yeah erm but basically no one know that there be a werewolf in the game because i have hide so well and i just act like a survivor and a survivor can win with anyone so there's no reason to kill me if there's there's no reason to kill a survivor even though a lot of the time they get kill anyway which be a shame some people hate survivors because they think oh the survivor's do a vote with the bad team so therefore we need to get rid of them erm and then also if there's other roles in the game claim survivor can be quite dangerous even if you be one erm
S0593	yeah
S0592	you know which suck but basically they think i be a survivor at the end it be me leave i think with a member of the mafia and a serial killer
S0593	yeah
S0592	and it didn't really matter which one i get rid of erm because i would have win anyway
S0593	okay
S0592	so i could have get rid of the mafia first or the serial killer i think i end up go for the serial killer because i felt like if i accuse this other person that they would just get me back
S0593	yeah
S0592	and there be more evidence against the serial killer so i just you know i say i'm a survivor trust me you know this person's a serial killer they be the
S0593	i'm a survivor de de
S0592	yeah they they be the serial killer we lynch them and then it come up with the werewolf win and everyone be like what we have a werewolf this game and i be like yeah
S0593	yay go me
S0592	i be try i be try to do the same thing just stay at my house and hope no one visit me but what happen be these stupid vampires these these
S0593	damn those vampires
S0592	no because this this happen twice i believe actually no it didn't it it happen once but i be think of something else erm what happen be like vampires i don't know it's quite obvious they bite people to try and turn other people into vampires
S0593	uhu
S0592	but certain roles be immune to be bite so they so the vampire will know that if you try to bite someone and they're immune they'll get tell oh your target be immune to your attack and roles that be mutual not mutual roles that be immune
S0593	yeah
S0592	to erm vampire bite be members of the mafia werewolves serial killers executioners and arsonists i believe
S0593	seem like quite a few
S0592	yeah i mean yeah there be quite a few that be immune but basically what the vampire'd do be they try to bite me night one and i didn't know they try to bite me cos they didn't actually say that i get attack or anything
S0593	okay
S0592	erm they try to bite me night one but they fail obviously cos i be a werewolf and i couldn't be turn it would be funny a werewolf turn into a vampire erm i i couldn't be turn
S0593	a vam wolf
S0592	and the vampire have write in their will cos when you die you present a will erm someone have write in the will oh this person be immune to me bite them and everyone be like oh what what be you why why be you immune to the vampire bite you i say i i'm a survivor i use my vest that's why i be immune because survivors can use vest to protect themselves
S0593	yeah
S0592	but apparently er even if a survivor use their vest they get bite and they turn into vampire anyway i didn't know that i be try to cover myself didn't work and i get lynch so
S0592	yeah but that's
S0593	so when you be play this with do you kill him
S0592	no erm the first time when when he be a he be erm i be on the same team as him anyway so i couldn't have kill him erm i be a member of the mafia he be he be just say oh this suck so much i can't even do anything i can't click anything and i say i say i would encourage you to leave but if you leave and you've still get a chance of win then you'll get time out and you'll have to wait until you get the next game
S0592	yeah
S0592	so i say just wait it out erm we end up win anyway really easily erm we be on the same team and then and then i think when he be a jester i think i can't remember what i be when he be a jester i think i be a good role but i can't remember what no no no what be i i think oh i can't remember what i be i think i be a good role though erm he be a jester but i be just try to give him advice on how to oh i remember what i be a doctor but i get kill night one
S0593	oh
S0592	it's annoy cos cos cos doctor can heal themselves once i be just frustrate that cos i didn't think i would use me heal for myself in the first in the first night but they end up kill me so you know suck erm ah yeah
S0593	soon boo boo
S0592	but i i be tell i be tell this be why he this be when he be say oh i can't do that no i won't do it i tell him to accuse some random person of be a member of the mafia erm because then
S0593	see at least one of my children have get scruple
S0592	no cos that
S0593	one of my twinnies
S0592	that's that's that's just the way you get lynch cos they think that he's an executioner if you just accuse someone random with that much evidence they'll think oh this person's obviously a really bad executioner we should get rid of him and that as i say that's the simplest way to do it be to just accuse some random person of be a member of the mafia have i have have some time though where i've accuse random people of be roles and have end up be correct and then people have actually believe that i've be a sheriff of something i'm like no lynch me i'm not a sheriff i'm not on your side
S0593	i remember you use to get quite frustrate on on this game sometimes you'd be like no no don't kill me don't kill me don't
S0592	it be it be frustrate sometimes cos you do get some you do you do get some people who be a bite dim and they throw away a an obvious chance to win and i'm not say i've never do that obviously cos i have at some point you know what seem obvious to other people wasn't so obvious to me but there have be instance where there have be some really really really obvious chance to win and someone have just throw it away because they weren't think or they didn't read something properly
S0593	yeah
S0592	erm what be i think of and also you sometimes get people who cheat in this game where they're on a skype call
S0593	no
S0592	no i know
S0593	really
S0592	yeah
S0593	people cheat in game
S0592	yeah no basically
S0593	wow
S0592	what people do be they'll be in skype call and i know i be talk to but i wasn't actually tell him outside information that would really affect the game
S0593	yeah
S0592	erm i wasn't tell him information that would influence the game or give him an unfair advantage i be just try to help him out with his role
S0593	as you should
S0592	but you get but you get some people who will skype each other and they will tell them outside information
S0593	yeah
S0592	that they shouldn't know unless you like that they shouldn't know about unless they be tell outside erm and you know sometimes you get people who be members of the mafia who rat out their teammates to their friends who be like a town role erm and say you know this person this person know all the members of the mafia erm and we wonder how the hell do they know that because one of the mafia tell them who we be erm and then i think one of the game i play yesterday the veteran he say oh i've get two roles and like that's not possible you can't have two roles he say oh i've get two roles i'm the investigator and the veteran he's say oh you can't be the investigator and the veteran i think he be use two account to play and cheat that way erm
S0593	yeah well maybe
S0592	but you can't do that that's that's cheat but
S0593	no
S0592	erm you know he he find out that someone be the godfather and he have no way of know that unless someone else have tell him and so yeah we all report him though and there be also a vigilante erm he be a town role who basically just shoot try to shoot bad people sometimes it doesn't end well cos they'll end up shoot a town member and then they die afterwards cos they die of guilt erm
S0593	uh die of guilt
S0592	i think they kill themselves
S0593	ah
S0592	erm but but yeah and then this vigilante somehow know how somehow know to shoot me even though there's no evidence against me i'm like that's suspicious how do you know to shoot me in particular if you just randomly guess like i don't
S0593	yeah you you could just er maybe use a good random random guesser but however
S0592	however there be so many other people he could have shoot you know
S0593	maybe he just doesn't like lamps
S0592	i don't think erm actually my name might no my name wasn't lamp that that round it wasn't no
S0593	what's that other game you use to play that always look fun be that erm one with the bubble where you have to go round collect more bubble
S0592	oh agar dot i o
S0593	yeah
S0592	yeah it's fun
S0593	cos that that they use to you use to be so funny watch you play that
S0592	it's it's it's quite
S0593	go away go away no no don't come near me no go away right i'm go over here i'm hide over here
S0592	always
S0593	no don't follow me go away come here i want to eat you no no go away
S0592	yeah it's a fun i haven't play it in a while actually yeah hopefully i can play a game with today if he's will i think i don't know i cos i like the game and i want i've want to play it with for a while
S0593	mm
S0592	erm cos it it's a fun game town of salem
S0593	it's nice isn't it when when you've get something that you actually really enjoy and you want to share it with somebody that that you love or somebody who's company you really like
S0592	mm
S0593	and you just want to share the same fun and get them to have the same fun and with you or what have you you know that that's always nice i think i always use to find it quite disappoint when other people just didn't wanna play the same game as me
S0592	yeah
S0593	you know
S0592	and he he do seem interest cos he be ask me question about how to play it and things like that so it's not as if he be completely fob it off or anything i think he be just a bite confuse and maybe a bite self conscious cos he didn't want to mess up i warn him i say you know this be the internet if you make a mistake just be prepare for some people to call you an idiot because i've be call a idiot countless time on that game even though it it make it make me mad because sometimes i appreciate that i've make mistake i'm like okay fine you know i mess up but a lot of the time the mistake that i make weren't necessarily my fault like
S0593	okay
S0592	but cos one time i be play i be play with people on a stream because the community manager of the game do a stream twice every week and so i like to play with people who be on that stream what have happen be i be the transporter and what the transporter do be they swap two people around each night
S0593	right
S0592	so let me try and explain this so let's say mafia target person a i decide to swap person a with person b
S0593	okay
S0592	so instead of person a die person b die cos i swap their place
S0593	okay
S0592	what have happen be i be a transporter the bodyguard and all protective roles be dead and the jailor be still alive so i be try to protect the jailor and what i do be i swap the jailor with a member of the mafia so that the mafia would kill themselves
S0593	okay
S0592	do that make sense
S0593	yeah
S0592	what have happen be there be a vigilante in the game who i didn't know about they have not reveal that they be a vigilante what happen be the vigilante be plan to shoot the mafia member that i swap the jailor with and so the vigilante end up kill the jailer and so the vigilante die because the vigilante be not mean to kill town members they kill themselves out of guilt
S0593	right
S0592	and i get blame for it because i move them but i have no idea i have no way of know that he be go to shoot that guy then people didn't seem to acknowledge that
S0593	right
S0592	do you understand where i'm come from
S0593	yeah i do
S0592	i cos i i have no way if he have tell me all he have to do be whisper me and say i'm go to shoot this person do not move them i i would have be like fine i won't move them i will move them with someone else
S0593	right
S0592	but he didn't he neglect to tell me and then i get blame for it and i i i be like this be unnecessary you know i it's not even my fault but the thing be be the that the vigilante be the person run the stream so i don't know if people be a bite aren't will to point like point out or criticise how he be play i didn't know he i didn't know it be him at the time and i be criticise him and i be say you know you should have tell me that you be go to shoot him i have no way of know you know he say he say oh the transporter screw me over i'm like no i say how be i suppose to know that you you be go to shoot him you didn't tell me you give no indication that you be go you be go to do anything so how would i know that
S0593	yeah and what do he way
S0592	erm i mean i can't i get a bite upset then because people
S0593	do you
S0592	people be call me an idiot and basically say i ruin the game for them which be unfair because i i would say it be both of our fault but it be more because he didn't communicate to me what he be do but like you know i didn't think i didn't i didn't know what he be
S0593	it's easy isn't it i mean you would think that with an online game and with with people that you've never meet before in your life that you would be able to not let their comment and things get to you but you do
S0592	i think i be i i think
S0593	you do
S0592	i think i be feel quite down as it be
S0593	yeah
S0592	and i think i be feel a bite over sensitive and i i be play that cos i i like to watch the stream to cheer myself up and i be play it to cheer myself up and they kind of ruin it
S0593	yeah ah
S0592	because they be basically just call me an idiot you know say i ruin the game for them even though i hadn't it be also the vigilante not think about tell you know the obvious transporter in the game what they be do
S0593	yeah but look back on it be it actually worth be upset over
S0592	oh i don't i don't know i think what what the person say there be one person in particular who be like really really call me an idiot apparently though they be an executioner and they be try to convince people to lynch me they be say oh this person's an idiot you know and they need to get lynch you know for the good of us and i be like you know you don't need to do that that's not necessary you know if you need to insult people to try and get them to get lynch you're a bad executioner
S0593	yeah
S0593	it's kind of sorry
S0592	okay
S0593	be you alright
S0592	yeah
S0593	yeah
S0592	sometimes when i talk too much my throat get dry and then i end up cough
S0593	yeah so do mine do you want erm a drink shall i get you a drink of water
S0592	no i'm okay
S0593	yeah no it it can be very very hurtful even with people that you know you really should think oh i really don't give a rat's ass what you think
S0592	i think i be also get mad because i be get mad and upset because they weren't see it from my point of view they they're they're only think oh this transporter mess it up because the vigilante be shoot but they didn't consider that i have no idea what the vigilante be do i have no way of know
S0593	yeah
S0592	it's like if i have a way of know he have if he have tell me and i do it anyway then i would understand why people call me an idiot
S0593	yeah
S0592	but there be no indication what he be do
S0593	oh
S0592	so i
S0593	but look back on it you you know i'm sure you can kind of look back on it and think why on earth do i ever get upset over that
S0592	i mean yeah and you know later on cos i be say you know i i don't appreciate that you know i've be call an idiot for this because i didn't i have no way of know
S0593	mm
S0592	you know i be kind of say that you've kind of ruin my night now because you've just keep call me an idiot you know even though it wasn't really my fault
S0593	yeah
S0592	and it wasn't the person on the stream by the way call me an idiot by the way he's nice i think he just also get frustrate because he wasn't expect me to move erm the people and you know erm but he say he say don't worry you know you do the best with the information you have and you didn't you know he admit that he hadn't say anything so
S0593	perhaps erm he just have a plan in his head and it didn't go the way he want it to go
S0592	obviously
S0593	and he didn't like it you know so
S0592	but you you you know it's a it's all good and well have a plan in your head but if you don't tell people who might affect your plan what you're do things like that happen
S0593	well tough luck really isn't it
S0592	yeah yeah but
S0593	have you see these things on facebook it say if you could sit on this bench and chat with only one person past or present who would it be
S0592	er i've probably see something like that
S0593	who would it be
S0592	oh i have no idea erm
S0593	no neither do i
S0592	i i don't know i don't know anyone past who when you say past do it imply that maybe they're dead
S0593	they're dead i suppose that's what it imply but it doesn't have to be it could just be someone you know in the past
S0592	maybe i don't know i don't know who i'd speak to i don't think there's anyone in the past that i'd particularly admire or want to speak to
S0593	no i i have to say i'm i'm the same
S0592	or maybe i'd talk to someone when they be younger maybe if they be quite old now maybe i'd speak to them when they're younger i dunno
S0593	oh that's a different way of look at it
S0592	oh i don't know if they're not dead maybe they're just old now and then you could go back in the past and speak to them
S0593	but it could be somebody that you go to school with
S0592	maybe there's no one in particular that i go to school with either that i would speak to not that i don't still speak to now
S0593	well yeah i'm exactly the same i kind of think i have there be no one particular person that i would want to sit and just chat with
S0592	and then it say then do it do it say future
S0593	no past or present
S0592	no oh i be about to say if it say future that doesn't make much sense do it cos how how how would you know who to speak to in the future or i think maybe i'd like to speak to robin williams
S0593	oh now that's a good one
S0592	cos he you know be quite funny and yeah
S0593	yeah and he's quite he's get quite a lot of wisdom as well have
S0592	i do i do yeah it's a shame isn't it what happen
S0593	it be a shame what do he kill himself because he's get parkinson's
S0592	i think he be also depress
S0593	which kind of come hand in hand with parkinson's
S0592	yeah
S0593	yeah i be a bite concern about your auntie because you know with this stuff she's get go on and even a neurologist isn't a hundred percent sure what it be she's get
S0592	mm
S0593	i actually think she's get more than one thing go on and but the way she walk be very very much like somebody with parkinson's however the neurologist hasn't pick up on it so
S0592	mm mm don't know
S0593	do you know what i find interest about the fact that you're interest in the neurological side of things
S0592	what
S0593	i want at one point to do further train in my nurses' train
S0592	mm
S0593	and do neurology
S0592	i i mean i i do find it i find it very interest i think maybe cos i'm more i think i consider myself quite a scientific person anyway
S0593	yeah
S0592	erm i do yeah and
S0593	you're quite you you're quite intuitive as well so
S0592	yeah
S0593	don't lose your intuition
S0592	no i no i won't there's yeah there's be countless time i i i'm kind of go like there's be countless time in the game where i have felt something really strongly but have not act on it cos i be afraid that i be gonna be wrong but actually i be correct
S0593	yeah but you're quite intuitive in life as well
S0592	yeah i i be just give an example
S0593	yeah you know so you're more you're more spiritual than i think you'd like to admit because you don't want to people to think you're a bite cuckoo
S0593	yeah be i right or wrong
S0592	maybe a bite
S0593	yeah you get to you get to a stage even if it take you fifty three years where you think i really don't give a monkey what you think this be me either like me as i be or walk away hurt sometimes especially when people throw you know when when people be cos everybody have get their gift right and regardless of whether it's academic or spiritual or metaphysical or whatever everybody have get their gift you know erm and when people have rely on you and your particular gift or gift to get them through things and then they throw it in your face tell you that you're you're egotistical or you're you relate yourself or what have you that hurt
S0592	mm
S0593	that hurt you know they damn well use that gift enough
S0592	yeah
S0593	that damn well hurt you know
S0592	i mean but it's not
S0593	but you do get to the stage where you think i be not gonna allow you to have me feel like this
S0592	it's like when erm it's not it's not it's different than yours but it's not like people have use it you know the fact that i'm quite academic
S0593	yeah
S0592	and you know especially in secondary school i'm i'm pretty certain there be a group of girls in particular who think i be a snob because i do like i work hard and i do well they think i be up myself you know i think i be up myself think be better than everyone else
S0593	that be probably true
S0592	but but i i i never give any indication to that i never you know treat anyone badly i never say oh you know i'm better than you you know cos i
S0593	no
S0592	but they they seem to assume that and i i didn't think that be fair because they have never actually speak to me or see what i be like and the fact
S0593	yeah well you know what happen if you break down the word assume don't you
S0592	yeah make an arse out of you and me yeah
S0593	yeah well that's all they be do isn't it
S0592	i know but i don't i don't think that be fair
S0593	but it do hurt and it's not fair i i agree with you it do hurt and it it isn't fair but at the end of the day as you get older this get easier you have choices to make you can either let their pettiness and what you know be wrong to get to you or you can say well you know i'm sorry i know the truth in my heart i know the truth so i'm not gonna let your misconceptions your misjudgements get to me
S0592	mm
S0593	erm you know it be something that be hard to do when you're younger but you you can as you get older and you practice it you can do it you it it be possible to do
S0592	yeah should probably go and get dress now
S0593	i'm just wonder if it's worth it
S0592	i don't think dad will be happy if she's not
S0593	w a l k yeah
S0592	be he be he come back this even
S0593	no he won't be back till tomorrow afternoon
S0592	oh
