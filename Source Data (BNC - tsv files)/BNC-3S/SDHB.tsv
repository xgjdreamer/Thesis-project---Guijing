S0008	that's tax free cash in your pocket
S0012	that's right
S0013	right
S0012	yeah
S0008	which you could be live off and then

S0008	when you die you know this two million pound house less the half a million equity release less a couple of hundred thousand
S0012	that's it yeah
S0008	you know interest
S0013	mm
S0008	be still worth over a million quid
S0012	yeah

S0012	yeah
S0008	right cos basically they get sell the money on it i mean they're get a good deal out of it right
S0012	well of course they be yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	because
S0012	isn't it the government that er
S0008	no no there's different company who do it
S0012	oh right yeah
S0008	and what they do they depend on how old you be you know they they'll let you have cash for the proportion of your house right
S0012	yeah
S0008	and erm the older you be the more cash they get you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos they've gotta work out that say
S0012	mm
S0008	you know say a house like mine would probably be worth about a hundred and sixty thousand cos i'm mid sixty six they'd probably let me have a third of it cash
S0012	yeah
S0008	right so they'd give me whatever a third of a hundred and sixty thousand be say
S0013	mm
S0008	fifty five thousand quid
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they wouldn't charge me any interest you know yearly
S0012	no
S0008	but it'd be charge up combine on the fifty thousand so the next year
S0012	so it would be
S0008	you owe them fifty five thousand or whatever and then the year after that it's fifty eight thousand
S0012	i see
S0008	then the year after that it's sixty thousand and the next year after that it's sixty five thousand you know and it just keep go
S0012	oh right yeah
S0008	until you die really
S0012	yeah and then they
S0008	but i mean they charge something like six and a half percent
S0012	yeah
S0008	annually right
S0012	which be dead cheap really innit
S0008	which you know
S0013	mm
S0008	yeah i mean they work out that if your house didn't increase in value you know they could probably go you know twenty years
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then you'd die and then they'd get all your house right
S0012	they do yeah yeah
S0008	because that cover because they allow the
S0012	yeah of course they be yeah
S0008	you know they get first choice of the money
S0012	yeah
S0008	but on the other hand you know if your house be go up in value every year
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know er you know i mean recently
S0013	mm
S0012	they've be go up over five percent a year so
S0012	so i hear yeah yeah
S0008	yeah
S0012	and yet
S0013	mm
S0012	hasn't sell his yet have he
S0008	you know the the flat in london i don't know if i tell you how much they pay for it

S0012	yeah
S0008	when they buy it two years ago
S0013	yeah
S0012	and now

S0012	wow
S0013	oh right
S0012	we do that
S0013	yeah

S0008	mm
S0012	and this developer be so big they've get millions of pound behind them they can do anything they like can't they really
S0008	yeah
S0012	and er through some kind of loophole they'll get permission
S0008	yeah no doubt but i mean it's in 's interest as well it's in everyone's interest

S0013	but they reckon the school can't cope you see the school can't cope doctor can't cope it's quite big now this village
S0012	yeah
S0008	i know but i mean what'll happen be
S0013	this
S0008	be that they'll just

S0013	mm
S0008	portakabins in with the school i mean

S0012	they do
S0008	from the old one

S0012	of course they have yeah yeah perhaps they do yeah they use to go round with a
S0008	round the
S0012	great big blanket and just
S0013	mm
S0012	people use to chuck
S0013	do they
S0012	half crown and two bob bits you couldn't chuck a pound in it cos that use to float
S0008	not that you would anyway
S0012	not that you would
S0008	mostly pennies
S0012	yeah
S0012	mostly pennies mostly pennies well they weigh something didn't they they be copper then and about
S0008	that's right yeah
S0012	that big weren't they
S0008	mm
S0012	and they be real copper now you
S0008	yeah
S0012	now you've get tuppences and pennies be all steel now
S0008	that's right
S0012	and just cover in copper plate
S0008	that's right and if you collect them and you can pick out the steel ones with
S0012	with a magnet
S0008	a magnet
S0012	yeah
S0008	and the other ones be worth more than
S0012	more than the face value
S0013	mm
S0008	more than the face value in copper
S0012	yeah cor and there's us the that's really weird how how time
S0008	yeah it's strange that when when i be read these stories of when europe get rid of all the currencies and go
S0012	yeah
S0008	over to er the euro
S0012	yeah
S0008	apparently like in germany you know they sort of collect all the old coin together and they use to have the pfennig
S0012	yeah that's right
S0008	with this the five pfennig and the ten pfennig i think be they be all sort of and nickel
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they collect them and they have so many it be a glut on the market and i think they dump them in old coal mine
S0012	what
S0008	it's funny isn't it ay
S0013	yeah
S0008	you'd think they'd be go to dig them out now
S0012	yeah
S0008	and sort of like use them you'd think they must have some sort of value
S0013	mm
S0012	well yeah well that's like when they change change ours in nineteen seventy one i think
S0013	mm
S0012	from from pound shill and pence to
S0008	decimal
S0012	decimal they take in all the money and lot of that be solid silver
S0008	well the whole what be it pre
S0012	pre twenty one twenty one and
S0008	pre twenty one yeah
S0012	yeah pre twenty one be be nineteen twenty one be silver
S0008	i don't think they be solid silver be they
S0012	they be solid silver
S0008	cos there be some if you be you have to some be half silver
S0012	well some nickel silver
S0008	and then if you go back a bite further they be
S0012	yeah
S0008	solid silver
S0012	well we get
S0013	mm
S0012	a pound
S0008	well i can imagine
S0012	a pound each for our half crown coin
S0008	yeah
S0012	so that they must have be silver
S0008	mm
S0012	because we wouldn't get we wouldn't have get a pound each for them would we
S0013	no
S0012	that's when we buy the land
S0008	yeah
S0012	a pound each
S0013	mm
S0012	we have eight didn't we
S0013	mm
S0012	and go through all our money
S0008	yeah
S0012	and find all this
S0013	yeah
S0008	it's funny old old coin be er gain in value now

S0013	always the dream isn't it
S0008	a lot of ifs ain't there
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah a lot a lot of ifs and buts i mean
S0013	yeah
S0012	crikey
S0013	mm
S0012	the things we could have do if we'd have do them
S0008	yeah
S0012	then if
S0013	if you'd get
S0008	and it's like that
S0012	where we would have be now
S0008	it's like that woman that irish woman who win the lottery
S0012	she spend
S0008	last week
S0012	oh oh i don't know about that
S0008	no not the scottish one this irish woman she win last week and she win about sixteen million it weren't a massive win
S0013	not a massive win
S0008	and she say oh yeah i'm gonna all all i'm gonna help rebuild all the youth centre round here she say all these kid all their place have be
S0013	ah
S0008	er fall down and all the money's be take away
S0013	mm
S0008	from them and stuff like that
S0012	oh right
S0013	yeah
S0008	and she say she she say well it's better to have a youth centre rather than hang around on the streets you know they've get nowhere to go and she's gonna spend all her or a big chunk of her money
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0013	won't take long do it
S0008	on on er
S0013	that's the sort of thing i would like to do
S0012	well i mean
S0008	yeah
S0012	er in
S0013	mm
S0012	they have
S0013	if it ever happen
S0012	they have a youth centre up at the church room
S0008	mm
S0012	the kid use to reckon that they'd go on to the youth centre they never go they use to hang out er outside the fish shop
S0008	mm
S0013	just stand outside they just stand outside and sit on the pavement
S0012	or just stand outside
S0008	yeah but the thing be
S0013	they didn't have to pay then
S0008	the thing be a lot of i mean i think that happen a lot
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you know why
S0012	because the vicar come in and say goodnight
S0013	cos they didn't wanna have to pay
S0008	what
S0013	cos they didn't have to pay then
S0008	yeah but i mean like if a lot of these youth centre be run by these sort of
S0013	oh religious
S0008	worthy individuals
S0012	that's right yeah
S0013	yeah mm
S0008	who try and organise and they're the big i be and stuff like that
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	and the kid just aren't interest
S0012	no they're not
S0013	no
S0008	whereas
S0012	well they use to have to pray at our youth centre
S0008	yeah well they aren't gonna do that be they
S0012	course they're not
S0008	no
S0012	oh that's stupid innit
S0008	and then you know every now and again they get sort of wreck don't they
S0012	they do yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	and so people say oh well you know we're not have this any more you know we're close it down
S0013	yeah true
S0008	if they can't pay a proper attention to it and all this sort of stuff
S0012	yeah well er our youth centre they use to have er kid from come and wreck it
S0008	mm
S0012	and the same the actual kid use to go up to
S0008	yeah
S0012	you know all that stupid rivalry weren't it but they've get wonderful place now
S0008	mm
S0012	haven't they i mean they they do a youth centre up there and that's be really
S0008	well you see this be it if they're run by if you can get some young adults
S0012	yeah
S0008	to run it
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know what i mean
S0012	yeah
S0008	er who and you know you could sort of
S0013	mm
S0008	get people who actually live around
S0012	yeah
S0008	in the village to run it
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	and but you've get to find people who
S0013	mm
S0008	get the incentive to do it
S0012	and and
S0013	well the guy
S0008	because nowadays you know they could you know with this sort of idea that you know you can't get job and you need cvs and you need this that and the other
S0012	yeah
S0008	i think that would be a bite a bite of an incentive to you know kid to get involve wouldn't it
S0012	that would wouldn't it yeah
S0008	you know it could look good you know er on their sort of leadership thing
S0012	apparently we've get a very good youth organisation in in they they even write up in in the paper
S0008	mm
S0012	the kid write
S0008	yeah
S0012	bits in the news and er one of them one of them write the other day that er people be get not not take any notice of the youth and they think that we're we're make trouble when we stand outside the street under a light in the street or something and that and we're not we just want to meet
S0008	mm
S0012	you know and and talk like we do when we be kid
S0008	well of course i mean the er this be sort of like nothing new about any of that be there
S0012	no
S0008	you know i mean people always have be wary of young people
S0012	well yes
S0008	but in in in in germany they use to have youth centre right every village would have one
S0012	yeah
S0008	and usually it be sort of a big old house which have all be give over
S0012	to the
S0008	there's no adults
S0013	yeah
S0008	involve with it
S0012	no
S0008	and they're sort of like adults they're young adults
S0012	yeah
S0008	and sort of like they've be there as young kid and
S0013	mm
S0008	they've sort of grow and slowly sort of it until they sort of get cheese off and go but they use to have all sort of things go on in these youth centre
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they use to have a bar and stuff like this as well

S0008	and they use to
S0013	yeah
S0008	have band in there they use to have sort of table tennis stuff and but they have the main place of bar sort of place

S0008	be just like a big sort of place with where you just sit and hang out
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	and you could either play game or watch telly or whatever you like you know or just sit and chat and
S0013	yeah
S0008	like every time there'd be like three responsible adults
S0012	yeah
S0008	to open it
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	and they would sort of like be run it
S0012	yeah
S0008	but you could always get plenty of people to volunteer to
S0013	mm
S0012	well
S0008	work in them
S0012	we use to bike from to to go to their youth
S0008	mm

S0012	well that be about four hours away weren't it
S0008	something like that
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	still there you go if we do come to a nuclear war well we wouldn't go know anything about it anyway
S0008	that's right
S0012	anyhow we ain't get much longer leave have we
S0008	we'll be alright
S0013	i hope so
S0008	i don't know it's a rum do isn't it a rum do
S0012	yeah it be so we be talk about pension the other day when do you say be go to get hers
S0008	sixty seven

S0012	that's disgust
S0008	it be
S0013	yeah
S0012	i mean what
S0013	that a long time innit
S0012	especially when she's sort of like so knackered now
S0013	yeah
S0008	all of the time
S0012	well i mean didn't
S0008	and this would be the time where she could really appreciate
S0012	a little bite of her
S0013	yeah
S0008	have a have a sort of basic
S0012	life yeah
S0008	basic
S0013	yeah
S0008	amount of money come in you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	i mean i can work through it
S0012	i think that's awful
S0008	it be
S0013	yeah
S0012	i think it's that's i mean er
S0013	yeah
S0012	the people who make these rule have get plenty of money
S0008	yeah
S0012	and they'll always have plenty of money cos they're always on the fiddle anyway aren't they
S0008	that's right
S0012	they're always claim their bite of
S0008	yeah i mean they make a fortune out of be a member of parliament don't they
S0012	well of course they do
S0008	and all these er
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know extra payments that they get
S0012	they get load
S0008	expense and stuff
S0012	expense
S0013	mm
S0012	oh two house they have don't they
S0008	well you you
S0012	half of them
S0008	yeah but or it the ones you know even the ones who say you know who do it all by the book you know you know when they get a extra house cos they need one
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know either they have a house in london and have to have one in the constituency or
S0012	yeah
S0008	vice versa they then get all the money to pay for that extra house
S0012	house yeah
S0008	to be do up
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	you know
S0012	mm
S0008	and and for the and for the mortgage
S0012	yeah
S0008	when you and then you know after a certain it become theirs you think well
S0012	yeah
S0013	that's not right
S0008	take up why don't they say
S0013	it's not right
S0008	if you want a extra place you've gotta rent somewhere and we'll pay the rent
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	that's why it would be fair wouldn't it
S0012	that would be very fair that would be that would be a lot better if if
S0008	but then what they'd do be they'd get the someone in the family to buy a house and rent it to them
S0012	well yeah
S0008	and that rent
S0013	yeah
S0008	would then pay the mortgage and all the upkeep
S0012	but the what they should have be a place like down street where it's on a temporary house for the time they're in
S0008	mm
S0012	they're in er so if if
S0008	there's six hundred and thirty of them ain't there
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	so they'd need a lot of property
S0012	well they would but i mean wouldn't it be
S0008	put them in a dormitory
S0012	yeah
S0008	put them in the barrack
S0012	well they get
S0008	cos that's right they own chelsea barrack
S0012	chelsea er barrack yeah
S0008	just round the corner
S0012	of course they have yeah
S0008	and they sell that ain't they
S0012	yeah
S0008	to some kuwaitis
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they're gonna turn it all into
S0012	multimillion pound empty house
S0008	yeah

S0012	all fall down
S0008	i can't remember the name either but i
S0012	now you see
S0008	mm
S0012	if the councils have the power like they've get power over us they can compulsorily purchase place can't they
S0008	mm yeah but they ain't get the money have they
S0012	well
S0008	and these place i mean each
S0012	they look at
S0008	one be worth like ten million innit

S0008	mm but the land be
S0012	the land be worth a
S0008	yeah
S0012	absolute fortune innit but that's a whole street which be
S0008	yeah
S0012	which be fall down in london
S0013	be it actually fall down though
S0012	well
S0008	well it's

S0008	it be you could just see a little bite of a lift
S0012	oh could you oh well you're
S0008	it be just pass
S0012	just in you be just in

S0012	oh that's
S0008	but each
S0012	each yeah yeah
S0008	you know cos
