S0439	how much do oh god how much extra money be nan gonna make out of this bond
S0481	well well she's get some in she's get some in her long term stuff which be in that i don't touch
S0439	yeah it's not like grow quite a lot
S0481	it do quite well yeah but
S0439	yeah
S0481	but i've leave it here there there's no point in and she's get nine thousand pound in which er stay as nine thousand pound and she just get a a nominal interest but
S0439	mm
S0481	she like that and the interest so there's no point in say it
S0439	yeah
S0481	so and then she's get a small amount of money in an isa with the build society
S0439	mm
S0481	and about twenty thousand pound in bond
S0439	mm she's get quite a lot go on
S0481	she's get about a hundred and twenty five thousand in cash well near
