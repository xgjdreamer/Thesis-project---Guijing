S0475	mm
S0417	on my own it's just too much so erm
S0475	so be the girls go
S0476	will you spend the night at
S0417	no
S0476	mm
S0417	because i'm gonna erm go straight to they actually can't erm
S0476	can't accommodate
S0417	they're they're go away the next day
S0476	mm
S0417	erm and up to the highlands so and erm i think i haven't see my dad in age so actually i'll probably
S0476	yeah
S0417	better the first one be a lunch and then you know we can suss it out for the next time
S0475	mm yeah
S0417	i mean i feel a bite bad it can't be longer but you know i be gonna go up longer in easter but then i won't be able to get up there until quite late so
S0476	mm
S0417	er to and then i won't see them so it's just er kind of it's and i can't go earlier because 's here and erm
S0476	how long will you be in then
S0417	mm
S0476	just one two days
S0417	erm one night in
S0476	mm
S0417	cos then they're go off to erm on holiday themselves and then er erm mm i'm go to take off i think for a couple of days on our own i think that'd be really nice
S0475	that actually would be really nice
S0476	yeah you won't have
S0475	mm mm
S0417	yeah i think it'd be really i mm
S0476	will you have there
S0417	no i won't have
S0476	no
S0475	so 's fly back from be he
S0417	no 's fly back with the girls from he's not go up at all
S0475	oh he's not go up
S0417	no
S0475	oh
S0417	the original plan be that he would come up and maybe like one of the girls or something but that it just didn't get arrange soon enough it be all kind of
S0475	mm mm
S0417	and actually erm and be go to give us their house for a few days when they go off
S0475	yes that's what i think it be yes
S0417	yeah
S0475	mm
S0417	and then perhaps put us on the insurance on the car and
S0475	mm
S0417	but it just because the flight back from be all aer lingus and not ryanair
S0475	right
S0417	if you leave them any erm even like one or two girls that add on we suddenly have to get like a a big car then and spend another
S0417	i mean it's it be quite expensive for them even on the ryanair flight here it be er
S0475	mm mm
S0417	three hundred euros plus for them to just come to
S0475	it's a lot of money that erm yeah erm
S0417	and that's not include and and who pay full price as well
S0475	of course he's over two two now that's right mm
S0417	mm yeah so anyway we think that this be the kind of erm the easiest way
S0475	do he do you pay two half price or just
S0417	no
S0475	do children go
S0417	no he pay full it's just full price
S0475	they're all full price
S0417	yeah
S0475	children don't get a children's ticket
S0417	no no not on ryanair no
S0475	oh my goodness
S0476	because they take up a whole seat presumably
S0417	yeah
S0476	that's the concept
S0417	and when they sit on your lap there be a kind of flat fee of thirty thirty quid or something thirty euros
S0476	mm
S0417	so they even pay then
S0475	it's erm it get so complicate i be so glad really
S0417	yeah yeah
S0475	that i don't have to sort of erm even go near that side of life erm
S0417	yeah
S0475	it be bad enough try to take all of you up
S0417	yeah
S0475	on a train once a year
S0417	yeah
S0475	when you've get the family railcard and each child go for a pound
S0417	yeah
S0475	er return it be fantastic
S0417	yeah
S0475	but erm but no erm
S0417	yeah no i've get i've i have to buy a family railcard anyway just for these journey
S0475	of course mm
S0417	cos even just go to
S0475	mm
S0417	it would've cost nearly seventy pound just for just for one journey with us and the girls
S0476	mm
S0417	but it i mean it could cost nearly that if we buy travel card for them even with a rail card it'll cost thirty eight pound for that rail card and 's an adult too so she er she pay
S0475	of course mm i think i make a mistake with
S0417	oh yeah don't yeah don't worry it's a month before isn't it
S0475	on my calendar and then and then i flick it over to august i think
S0475	nineteen
S0417	yeah
S0475	i think but that there wasn't a a number beside that and i think i've miss her birthday
S0417	yeah yeah
S0475	so i scribble off this card

S0417	or do like the girls use to be able to have those options but erm but erm so she didn't have the money and she also just spend the money she do have all the other girls like seem to like hold onto it i suppose they don't really go out and do much
S0475	mm
S0417	but erm so i don't know quite how it happen but they erm her mum's boyfriend
S0475	the one that she have this
S0417	yes

S0417	even though he move up with local boys from the primary school they've they've not remain his friends
S0417	and funnily enough for somebody as sociable as and as open he hasn't make as many friends as you'd think and i i it probably isn't his fault it probably be the kind of just i don't know whatever's whatever the kind of scene be

S0417	yeah
S0476	because he's get at university which be expensive
S0417	oh yeah
S0476	cos er although you see he be er earn quite a lot last year
S0417	yeah
S0476	and of course the the amount you have to pay for your children
S0417	yeah
S0476	depend on how much you be earn last year not how much you're earn this year

S0475	mm
S0476	and erm so er he er er erm give up her job she
S0417	come away from the tv
S0476	but but she now

S0476	she she and so she take a course in english as a foreign language
S0417	yeah
S0476	and er she
S0417	i hear of that and i think what an enterprising you know
S0417	me feel quite proud of actually
S0476	and she she she she
S0475	absolutely we do
S0476	absolutely she's about five years younger than erm
S0417	but you know lot of people would not pick themselves up and think about what they can do and just go
S0475	yeah
S0476	by the time by the time by er she's get a job in
S0417	
S0476	which be er in the in germany
S0417	oh
S0476	the industrial part of germany
S0417	oh right
S0476	erm the part which we be bomb the hell out of during the war
S0417	right
S0476	and erm she she be erm she she er she er and so basically they've get to see themselves over
S0475	for five years five or six years
S0476	until until er all the erm
S0475	pension
S0476	pension come in you see
S0417	so they've get five year sort of period
S0476	er he his his state his state pension be go to come erm when he's erm er sixty five and a half
S0475	mm
S0417	yeah
S0476	actually they're
S0475	they're they're they're stagger the er the
S0476	erm they're they're stagger the change in
S0475	the change
S0417	oh
S0476	in in age
S0475	because it use be sixty for a woman sixty five for a man
S0417	oh right oh right oh i see
S0476	so he's get he's get not quite
S0475	now they've both they're both now
S0476	but of course she be significantly younger
S0417	yeah
S0476	erm she's about five years younger than him i think
S0417	yeah
S0475	i think so mm
S0476	and so erm if she erm when they get all their pension come in
S0417	yeah
S0476	er they'll be fine
S0417	okay
S0476	they'll they'll be better off than we be at the moment you know but erm
S0417	i suppose that's nice for them to know they're not in this kind of my god we've get years and then what do we then
S0475	mm mm
S0476	er but they've get they've get to fill fill up the the time in the meantime
