S0627	experience with immigrants be not a new thing
S0624	yeah
S0627	they're like bad anti
S0624	i'm really worry about what david cameron say today
S0626	set them on fire what do he say
S0627	oh my god i know me too
S0624	yesterday
S0626	oh
S0624	so bad about give
S0626	english as a second language
S0624	yeah the test but
S0626	integration
S0624	test for muslim women
S0627	no no but know what he say
S0624	so fuck up
S0627	he say give
S0627	he say give muslim women the opportunity to learn english because so that it's so that they could so that they could erm
S0624	he say it's empowerment
S0627	that they could they could minimise radicalisation that's what he say that's what he
S0624	it be like he be just like he be just like make all these shit
S0627	record
S0626	it's fuck
S0624	i forget about that we're we're it's good material guy keep go
S0626	erm
S0626	go on a big twitter rant about it and she get ask on channel four news actually
S0624	do she quite right
S0626	yeah but it's it's fuck abhorrent absolutely abhorrent
S0627	it's outrageous
S0624	also what a fuck awful thing to say as
S0626	cos at the end of the day there's generations of people that like even like those that come in like the fifties like the erm you know indian pakistani families that come in the fifties in the first wave
S0626	who never learn english
S0627	yeah
S0626	and you know how many fuck things do they blow up
S0624	i like hat that he's claim it as empowerment as well
S0627	but it's also like it's also it's also like
S0624	that be what be so pernicious about it
S0627	it's also like an it's also like an insane it's insane like target of like of of a group of people when actually there's a an er huge amount of people that live here that can't speak english so like why be you like specify like muslim
S0626	and also
S0627	and also why the fuck be you link it to to like radicalisation like it's like outrageous
S0626	cos everything have to be link to radicalisation
S0624	it's just opportunism
S0627	yeah i know
S0626	further the ideas of integration rather than multiculturalism but in the tradition of
S0627	i don't think i don't think that do i don't think that do like aid like integration that say things like that
S0626	no not him say it but you know like the
S0627	oh yeah the idea of it sure
S0626	in france there's like
S0624	yeah
S0626	france have always be an integrate society you're french before you're anything else you denounce your er any
S0627	yeah yeah yeah
S0626	whereas in britain we've always celebrate like you know
S0627	the diversity
S0626	yeah diversity and like culture and things like that
S0627	yeah
S0624	well the thing be like
S0626	and part of it's like and i think that's more for the better like
S0624	but one of the interest things be
S0626	it's less it's less
S0624	there's like isn't there the same number of like you've get the same problems in both societies
S0626	yeah
S0624	and that be quite interest like i think it's like i think it's like we have to stop be like i think it's like it's not about how well people have be integrate it's about that people be lose
S0626	and disenfranchise
S0624	and like yeah disenfranchise and like
S0626	and uneducated and
S0627	and i also think it's i also think it's
S0624	yeah
S0626	mm
S0624	no to get like
S0627	i also think it's i think it's i think it's simplify it by be like well you know like by either say by just say like embrace embrace where you're from the racial difference or the flip of like embrace the fact that you're in this new place like just because you're part of a group doesn't mean you feel like you're part of the group right
S0626	yeah but the thing be that even if you even if you hold on to like your pakistani or er like whatever identity you should still be very happy with the fact that you're british like the idea of
S0627	but i'm but my point be be that i'm say like i'm not i'm say that it's stupid to say that one system be better than the other
S0626	mm
S0624	i know but
S0627	but they've both both like some some people might deal with one system some people might into the other
S0626	what integrate people
S0627	but there's always gonna be people that
S0626	mm
S0627	that don't don't fit into either
S0624	i think but i think it be important
S0626	but the thing there's more posh people i can't understand than pakistanis
S0627	mm
S0626	there's more posh people i can't understand than pakistanis
S0627	yeah of course

S0627	she's you know she's like i'm a like er i'm a i'm a minister like my sister's a lawyer
S0624	i just think
S0626	's mum that new labour mp whose mum didn't speak a word of english to be fair actually hold her back but because the
S0627	yeah
S0626	state wasn't will to recognise
S0626	the fact she didn't speak english so she be in prison for years
S0627	yeah
S0626	because er nobody would actually she could only ever speak in her
S0626	's a new labour mp in er basically her mum be in an very abusive relationship
S0627	oh
S0626	and she murder her she kill her partner and it be
S0627	fuck
S0626	murder but then for years and years and years she be in prison be hold well past her parole date
S0626	in the uk yeah and be in
S0627	why be she hold past her parole date that's surely a breach of
S0626	because no no she be no her release date her parole date so erm she be just cos er she'd never do like any she'd never do have any bad behaviour she be
S0627	yeah
S0626	the perfect criminal she
S0627	i see okay
S0626	but she never show remorse in the eye of the parole board because she be speak in her second language
S0627	ah
S0626	so
S0627	so she couldn't
S0626	even though she speak english well she couldn't
S0627	empathise
S0626	well no in fact she couldn't articulate the empathisation so
S0627	in the way that they want yeah yeah yeah that's so interest
S0626	so if people go do you kill him she's like yes i kill him like do you think it be the right thing to do yes where she couldn't articulate the fact that yes i think it be the right thing to do because i be in an abusive relationship
S0627	oh god
S0624	that's so interest
S0626	i didn't want my daughter to abuse be abuse so i kill him
S0627	wow
S0626	to save our family and it be also a self defence thing so actually 's mum be one of the people that go to see her and analyse her for the first time and she say erm
S0624	that's amaze
S0626	and her mum come up and say this be ridiculous absolutely ridiculous er speak to another dude and he be like this be absolutely ridiculous the she's very remorseful and and like the circumstances be so mitigate anyway
S0627	also like why
S0624	yeah
S0627	why why do it take so long for for like
S0624	and then what happen
S0626	because people confuse her cos they be like you must speak english you must speak english you must speak english
S0627	oh my god
S0626	and she do speak english she speak good english but she couldn't
S0624	i just think it must be really
S0627	that's so fuck
S0626	bilingual people emote in one language over the other
S0627	yeah for sure
S0626	so like people who be bilingual actually very good at erm distance erm distinguish themselves from emotions in in decisions
S0627	yeah right
S0626	so when so if you wanna distance yourself from an emotion say you're make a big business deal even if you're do the deal in your main language you'll think in your second language
S0624	that's so interest
S0626	it's cos you be naturally more emotive in one language than the other
S0624	that's so interest
S0627	but why if but if even if you're do it in your in your first language why would you emote in the second language
S0626	you well you think in your you'd think in your second language which then distance yourself like emotionally cos you don't ever you you flip between the two but you're more emotive
S0627	oh right
S0626	if you don't wanna be emotive where it's subconsciously er
S0627	then you can then you can
S0626	then you would just be in the other language
S0627	that's so interest
S0624	it's just so it's such a strange kind of it's just like it's so like it's just so i really think david cameron need to read some book like that's what i wish he'd do cos he's like show total lack of understand and i be like i hear this really interest about this like
S0627	i don't think if he read any book
S0624	family
S0627	i don't think he'd
S0624	but like you like as you say it's just understand
S0626	do you send a message to my phone
S0626	oh oh right yeah sorry that be last week
S0627	hilarious
S0624	erm
S0627	go on the what family
S0624	er yeah he like both so they'd come over from ireland or something like the family
S0627	mm
S0624	and they be like and er it it be i think no it wasn't where where be they come from wasn't from ireland at all it be from it be like in the fifties it be like it be just the daughter be talk about it and she be say like it be really her parent could never cope with the readjustment because the kid could speak english
S0626	yeah
S0624	and the parent couldn't and it suddenly be this really weird and very poisonous
S0626	yeah
S0624	dynamic then for the family it be difficult because like
S0627	cos you're cos you can keep things from the parent
S0624	he like and like the the but they also have like no that's it it be my friend and they come over from vietnam that be right
S0627	oh god
S0624	and no sorry i remember
S0624	no no i just couldn't remember
S0626	why what be the original
S0627	another story we be talk about and she be like
S0624	no shut up
S0627	she be like ah there be this family that come over i think it be from ireland
S0627	i think i read about it
S0626	yeah that dangerous country where they can't speak english
S0624	sound stupid i think
S0626	oi top of the morning to you there
S0624	ireland
S0624	it be so they come and like they go er they move over to france and he be say it be really really difficult for erm for his parent and his grandparents
S0626	mm
S0624	cos his grandparents like like be very stick in their ways and they be like in their you know forties and fifties and they couldn't readjust to it and they find
S0626	yeah
S0624	like the whole thing really traumatic and stressful
S0627	yeah
S0624	and like they didn't pick up but the kid pick it up and there be this kind of like strange so poor relationship and you have to understand like the complexity of human be go through that sort of shit
S0626	mm
S0624	like families leave syria who never want to leave in the first place
S0627	yeah yeah yeah totally
S0624	and like even if you're leave for economic reason and like you've have to move because you're like people don't actually often particularly wanna be here
S0626	people don't wanna leave home they don't wanna leave home families yeah
S0627	there aren't yeah there aren't
S0624	they don't wanna leave home
S0627	yeah you're right there aren't
S0624	yeah and it's just like it's so inhumane
S0627	there aren't that but there aren't that many there aren't that many people that that er that that yeah i mean in term of the amount of people that come
S0624	economic migrants economic migrants learn
S0627	there aren't that many people that come through choice
S0624	like because they have to and they learn because they have to and if you're an economic migrant who can't speak english then you're fuck like if you're a romanian who can't speak english then you're not let on build sit and then
S0627	i also think yeah i also think i also think
S0624	and then if you're if you're here because you need to be and then like there's so much complexity in that like try to learn a language at like twenty be hard try to learn it at sixty be like next to impossible
S0627	well it's also it's not just
S0624	like
S0627	it's not just the language be it it's like it's like the cultural differences right kind of
S0626	mm
S0627	it's like that way like i mean it sound really stupid but i like i always forget that thing where like i have to like get over it when people that aren't british don't say thank you when you give them stuff i know that sound ridiculous
S0624	yeah
S0627	but like but you but you forget that like you forget that stuff you forget that like
S0626	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0627	that isn't that inherent in other culture
S0627	like immediate like gratitude
S0626	the absolute and the absolutely over thankful
S0627	yeah even if you yeah like you know if i make someone a cup of tea at work like they might not say thank you to me and like at first i be like bite rude
S0626	fuck foreigners
S0627	yeah bite rude
S0624	yeah
S0627	and then i be suddenly like oh it's you know but it's like those like tiny nuances but imagine
S0624	yeah
S0627	if you can't even speak the language then you learn a language and you still don't get the social
S0624	have you work have you work out there be like that here come the romanians be the
S0626	yeah yeah
S0624	have you see it
S0626	yeah
S0624	be it like the first
S0627	there's another one there's another one that do
S0626	really funny
S0624	it's so funny
S0626	yeah
S0624	but like i love like i love the like wry observation how weird it be
S0627	here come the romanians
S0624	come to the uk
S0626	yeah
S0624	like the guy the guy who come he be he live in that like mad house with like seven or eight or nine kid
S0626	yeah yeah
S0624	and he come over and he be like what the fuck be go on here
S0624	it's a really that's what i think be like so clever about it be that it shin a mirror back up to like how weird it be come from
S0626	yeah cos we consider it to be normal but at the same time it's
S0627	thank you
S0624	sorry thank so much that be really nice thank
S0626	i erm i watch a cheer i watch a erm film for erm the the second world war and it be by the make by the americans it be call know your ally

S0626	and one about the british as well and it be really interest cos obviously it be
S0626	it be really positive as well
S0626	cos it be the war and everything be positive
S0626	erm but it be really interest to see that perspective on british
S0626	like analysis of british life from
S0626	through a
S0626	foreigner's lens
S0626	and i'm read this book er i've get this book i've not actually start read it but i've get this book it's by a hungarian guy on how to be a brit it's

S0626	
S0624	and dialogue over the top and he's like
S0626	that's really good
S0624	he's like an he's he i think he's gay and he be like experiment and he's like a real like he's like like rant about thatcher blah blah blah but like i watch it with a lot of my spanish friends

S0624	like very suburban but like brilliant and like i don't yeah it's just it just there's something about it and i can't put my finger on what it be
S0624	but if i be teach someone like what england be about i'd be like you have to watch this
S0626	you'd show them that i'll give them a watch

S0624	but it be almost like it be cos the thing be that it's about england cos he's like look at like england
S0627	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0624	and it's a social history so it's get all but like the way that like it's more than that it's nuanced of like how it's put together and its form which make it so fuck
