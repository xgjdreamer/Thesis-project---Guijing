S0654	mercury venus earth mar jupiter saturn uranus neptune
S0653	mm yeah so why what be you do in term of planets
S0654	well she just want us to remember
S0653	but why
S0654	i don't know
S0653	when i be little we also learn pluto but they've get rid of that now they say it be too small to be a planet
S0654	pluto
S0655	i be alive when it be
S0654	it be when you be bear pluto
S0653	it be the think of as a planet
S0655	for a while
S0653	when i be little
S0655	because i when when i be about maybe three years old i have a big erm solar system thing
S0653	oh you do you do have a big chart about it yeah
S0655	yes and there be pluto on it
S0653	mm
S0655	although now we've discover planet nine i think well we haven't but there be certain sign of it
S0653	mm
S0655	either that or 's make it up
S0653	oh i don't know in our solar system
S0655	in our solar system a ninth planet or tenth planet include pluto which i think
S0653	that seem a bite mean doesn't it to
S0655	yeah just take take a planet
S0653	i don't know how they decide
S0655	out of the solar system
S0653	you know that it be too small and it couldn't be a planet but anyway yes so that chart be wrong and all the book that they'd write about planets be wrong so
S0654	do you know what erm a pin size thingy of a blue planet of a blue planet erm be the same
S0653	a pin size thingy
S0655	have yeah i've tell you this the empire state thing
S0654	yeah
S0655	of the pin head size blob
S0653	of a
S0655	oh
S0654	what be it
S0655	you know the matter of star
S0654	matter of erm matter of a star weigh erm the same as three empire state
S0653	three empire state build so pretty heavy
S0655	yeah
S0655	yeah but not actually of a star of red or blue
S0654	yeah a huge planet
S0655	which be a star but it's
S0653	it's what
S0655	it's much bigger than the sun and much more powerful it's blue which mean it's extremely hot
S0653	so that's probably what will happen to our sun one day then
S0655	what it will turn blue
S0653	sorry if a what
S0655	turn blue
S0653	well i guess so if it's burn up
S0655	the red ones be the coldest
S0653	it will get hotter and hotter the sun
S0654	mum shall i tell you something you might not know
S0655	when it destroy the moon how hot will it get
S0654	the blue ones be the hottest and the red ones be the coldest planets
S0653	mm planets or star
S0654	planets or star the size medium sorry
S0653	be you talk about planets or star in term of blue and red
S0654	erm planets or star depend
S0653	well a star be sort of burn it's slowly it's die that's what a star be
S0654	once they die they create a black hole
S0653	and sometimes the star that you can see in the sky be already dead but they be sort of still you know the speed of light and all i can't remember exactly now but it mean you can be look at it here but you know a million miles away where it live it's actually die out already which i think be pretty amaze
S0655	mm although there be i can't although
S0653	mm
S0655	in my it can't be true book
S0653	oh yes
S0655	be wrong cos it i'm not sure if it have pluto as a planet
S0653	i don't think it do
S0655	but it definitely doesn't have planet nine

S0654	you can also get recorder and i think drum practice
S0655	erm yeah you might be able to
S0653	i don't think you can get drum practice
S0654	no cos i remember like in summer time last year before last year
S0653	mm
S0654	erm a drum a drummer come in

S0653	what the in 's year
S0655	no
S0653	oh okay well if it come up again
S0655	you'll sign me up
S0653	yeah possibly it might be a bite easier from the the one that we use i mean i really like my drum teacher
S0655	they have three cymbals on their drum
S0653	be there a school drum kit then
S0655	yeah
S0653	yes i do ask about recorders but i forget
S0655	unless bring his in
S0653	mm i can't afford everything though and so you're do brownie's at the moment
S0654	yeah i might do erm recorders when you have time to get me in
S0655	erm i might want to do run as like practice or something if you can
S0653	the run club yeah
S0655	yeah
S0653	well the thing be you'll be able to do load and load and load of things when you're older i'll have i'll have to check about piano lessons as well next time that come up
S0654	i also want to do piano lessons and recorder lessons
S0653	yeah but the thing be i can teach you piano and you're teach yourself anyway
S0654	yeah mm
S0653	the thing about lessons be that you can learn the basics on your own at home well you can with me but if you're go to actually have lessons with somebody you have to be determine enough to bother to practice outside of the lessons not just the songs and things the piece of music but to do the the kind of the practice the scale
S0655	yeah do
S0653	and things
S0655	repeat some of the step load and load of time until you perfect them
S0653	yeah but you're not even do that very much all the time for a drum for drum and that's fine because it's fun at the moment but if i be to pay regularly and when you're a bite older if you're really in really keen on the drum and you want like fortnightly or weekly lessons then i'll try and make it work but you would have to practice every day
S0655	oh and mum ps do chest cost any do chess cost any money
S0653	no
S0655	good cos i guess they be do well chess help you with your school work
S0653	mm
S0655	and concentration
S0653	it's cos it's run by parent that's why it doesn't cost money but i you know and the thing be you know it's all very well if i sign you up for piano lessons now but you don't really do the practice if you wait a few years until you're ready
S0654	yeah
S0653	then you'll learn just as much as you would do
