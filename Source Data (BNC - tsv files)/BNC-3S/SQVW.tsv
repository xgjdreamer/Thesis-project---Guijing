S0525	be you gonna speak to them
S0656	yeah
S0525	mm
S0656	and i'll mention it to the recruitment consultant who might then pass it on to

S0656	yeah
S0525	i'm pretty sure they would you know
S0615	probably
S0525	i'd certainly try it cos it's a you know it's a lot of money for you
S0615	it be yeah
S0525	but it's not for them
S0656	no
S0525	and they're gonna get the benefit now
S0656	so they may do i mean they say the well the money that i've gotta pay back be for my exams and a couple of the course that i go on
S0525	right
S0656	and they've always say they're gonna send me on those course for the next exams anyway so they're gonna pay for them
S0525	oh
S0656	yeah
S0525	be gonna
S0656	be
S0525	send you on
S0615	mm
S0525	those course
S0615	yeah
S0525	yeah
S0656	that won't be a problem will it
S0525	oh well if that's the case i'd yeah yeah a good idea go through the recruitment consultants i'd forget that's
S0656	i'll just mention it to her and say that they're be a bite rubbish about me leave
S0615	what be you gonna do first then

S0525	yeah
S0615	yeah

S0525	hopefully you'll be yeah i think you'll be successful
S0615	yeah yeah i i don't think you'll be
S0656	unless they take it out of my pay packet rather than make us pay it back cos then i'll have to pay tax on it

S0615	mm yeah yeah i suppose
S0656	for nothing
S0615	oh it's just
S0525	i reckon 'll take it on
S0615	yeah
S0525	i i think i think they will
S0615	well you'd think with the amount of money that they've get
S0525	they're be difficult aren't they
S0615	oh they're just be horrible but on you know
S0615	if we weren't in the position that we're in i'd be a bite more like oh well
S0615	you know you do sign a contract to say that
S0525	it might yeah
S0615	yeah so
S0525	oh they've get themselves cover and they're lawyers aren't they so they're
S0615	oh of course they be yeah yeah yeah
S0525	they're not they're not gonna not have it cover
S0615	no absolutely and know at the start of the job if he cos

S0615	you always say that didn't you if i er do leave halfway through i
S0525	yeah
S0615	i be gonna have to pay back for my exams
S0525	cos i have say to you i'll see if you if they take it out the pay packet if you can pay it back see if they're entitle to take it

S0525	how would you get down there then
S0656	dad
S0525	oh would he take you down
S0656	yeah
S0525	that's good
S0656	that's er
S0615	yeah
S0525	cos we're go
S0656	he'd be off work won't he so
S0615	uhu
S0656	it's mid week
S0615	yeah
S0656	mm
S0525	it'd be it'll be good and then he'd have the car seat
S0656	so he'd have to pick us up
S0525	yeah and then be the ones from east midlands much more
S0656	about a hundred more
S0615	i think they be about a hundred pound more weren't they
S0525	in total or each
S0656	each each
S0615	each mm
S0525	a hundred quid each
S0656	about two hundred return each
S0525	yeah
S0615	whereas the wizz ones be a hundred each so definitely do that with er
S0656	mm
S0525	and we'd get in similar time because ours leave about five twenty or do it or five yours leave at five twenty
S0615	ours leave at five twenty if we book those ones yeah
S0525	ours would leave at five so that so we'd all be at the other end
S0615	uhu yeah
S0656	yeah
S0525	we'd have to hire get a car
S0615	uhu
S0525	a people carrier
S0615	yeah
S0525	and get a car seat
S0615	yeah
S0525	and i'm wonder cos we'll have the whole day i'm i'm think we should erm we should perhaps get down to 's
S0615	yeah
S0525	on the first day the supermarket
S0615	yeah on the way uhu
S0525	and erm well we don't even have to go on the way it's up to us cos it depend on
S0615	okay yeah
S0525	how how
S0615	yeah of course yeah
S0525	from from the journey
S0615	mm
S0525	cos it's a really early morning so if he's grizzly
S0615	yeah
S0525	erm
S0615	well it would probably be better
S0525	but we can make erm
S0615	cos he would probably just sleep
S0525	yeah we can go on the way erm but we'd probably do er like a big food shop as well for the week and we could
S0615	yeah
S0525	buy the cot
S0615	uhu yeah
S0525	we could buy a travel cot
S0615	yeah
S0525	i'm think
S0615	uhu
S0525	cos otherwise erm i mean i could ask and but
S0615	yeah
S0525	i'm a bite kind of i dunno if somebody have say to me straightaway oh can we borrow
S0615	yeah yeah
S0525	when it's you've buy it for your baby
S0615	yeah i suppose
S0525	i'm sure they would
S0615	yeah of course they would
S0525	i didn't
S0615	well i mean they've even say to you haven't they but
S0525	have they
S0615	do er didn't you say that they say oh we've get all the stuff out there if you ever need it
S0525	oh i think it think it be more me say oh i it'll be i'll have it off you
S0615	oh oh i see
S0525	when you've finish with it i think even before you'd get pregnant
S0615	mm
S0525	erm the first time go out there two years ago
S0615	oh okay
S0525	and i say say we'll we'll be buy all this off you or something when
S0615	mm
S0525	you've finish with it
S0525	but obviously yes it's all erm and but i dunno but if if we couldn't get one
S0615	yeah
S0525	i could contact them and see if we we've get a whole day i'm think
S0615	yeah it'll be fine
S0525	or the other option be you have the double bed and he have to lie in the middle of you for the first night
S0615	yeah
S0525	you know or something like that until we get it sort
S0615	oh i think he'll be fine
S0656	but we'll have all day won't we
S0525	but we'll have all day cos we're get there early that's right
S0656	yeah
S0525	so we only really need the one supermarket trip there
S0615	yeah
S0525	erm we're only take a suitcase one way we're not bring
S0615	right
S0525	cos you have to pay for the case
S0615	yeah yeah of course well we'll obviously need
S0525	yes
S0656	well hopefully one of them will take bag for us
S0525	cos er
S0615	yeah
S0525	i'm take erm
S0615	i think with a baby you can have your change rug's extra but er we'd have to check on wizz we'd check
S0525	well i'm take our i've get two cushion for the patio chair

S0615	you won't get a double duvet in be you
S0525	well if it if it's already if it's in the package you don't take it out the package it's

S0615	mm
S0525	a cover and two pillow case and i want to buy two a and duvet cover and pillow case for the single bed
S0615	why
S0525	just because those white things be horrible and they're get tattier and horrible now and
S0615	why don't you just buy cover why do you have to buy the
S0525	what do you mean
S0615	yeah
S0525	i'm not buy the duvets i'm buy just duvet cover

S0615	oh yes of course you you
S0525	many moon ago
S0615	yeah you use to
S0525	it's just yeah it's easier just to have i'll what we'll have to do be we'll go and we'll look at the size of it and we'll make a decision on whether we can get it out there and if i need
S0525	and er it'll be nice i mean we've get the flat screen tv out there we've get the
S0615	yeah
S0525	nice patio chair we've have the one new bed
S0615	yeah
S0525	erm
S0615	oh yeah especially when you go out for the amount of time you do it's definitely worth

S0615	mm
S0525	as well to go under the but i can't carry that out there but there might be one at 's
S0525	oh the other thing i want to be to update the erm hand towel and bath towel cos they're all fray around the edge they're look really tatty but i
S0615	well you can do that out there can't you towel

S0656	forty six
S0615	mm
S0656	that's not too bad then

S0615	no no we'll take those
S0525	take take those out

S0615	yeah what would you do so i mean obviously he'll be on his food three meals a day
S0525	yeah
S0615	by then
S0525	and he'll still be have his formula milk so you'll be able to take the formula milk
S0615	would you take the powder and then do what though

S0656	have to buy a filter get a brita filter
S0525	like a brita filter
S0656	traveller a travel filter

S0656	and then either put the bottle water through it or
S0615	yeah
S0656	tap water through
S0615	do you remember when drink the tap water in bulgaria
S0656	yeah

S0615	yeah
S0525	cos that's nice and soft and we can cook

S0525	that he like that we could put on pasta
S0615	uhu take those

S0615	yeah yeah
S0525	by use a fork
S0615	yes it's only you know a week it's gonna be easier to plan what he's gonna have and
S0656	and just take
S0525	even if you buy
S0656	seven of the bottle
S0615	take what
S0656	seven of the big aptamil bottle or
S0525	well you yeah you could do
S0615	yeah you could do that
S0656	rather than worry about it
S0615	you just don't want it to leak in the case
S0525	that's probably a good idea actually
S0656	rather than worry about the water
S0615	yeah
