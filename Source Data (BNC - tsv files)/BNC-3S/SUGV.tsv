S0653	what do you think would make you most happy then guy or what do you think make people happy cos you'd often you be talk about the lottery yesterday do you think if we you win a million pound would that make you happy
S0655	yeah
S0654	no
S0653	right so
S0655	why if you win a million pound and you could buy whatever you want why would you not be
S0653	no well no no let's hear her first let's hear her first and then let's let her let's have your opinion first cos
S0655	yeah i think you'd probably be happy cos er you have just become a millionaire
S0653	but why would that make you happy
S0655	cos you could buy load of awesome stuff
S0653	you could buy load of awesome stuff yes and
S0655	and for some reason er materials make people feel happy
S0653	true why do you think it might not make you happy
S0654	because i would like feel bad for all the people who lose the lottery
S0653	would you
S0654	yeah because they've be try their their they've be try so hard try to get that and they might be quite poor and they might not have much food
S0655	but
S0653	but you could but you could use some of your money to for the good you could set up a charity couldn't you
S0654	yeah
S0655	you could give all the money to charity if you win like sixty thousand million
S0653	you could yeah
S0654	i'll feel bad and good people have lose and weren't happy and good that i could set up a new charity to try and stop cancer
S0653	but do you think anyone else that win it would think about the people that lose
S0654	no cos they might
S0655	barely anyone do believe me
S0654	cos they might think
S0654	cos they will definitely i think they will definitely think yay i win so i'm gonna get all this fancy stuff a mansion a really a really fast car and
S0655	what like a lamborghini
S0654	yeah
S0653	well you can buy lot of er expensive things but what good could you i mean 's right you could buy anything you want we could buy any lego we want
S0655	oh
S0653	and we wouldn't necessarily have to worry about money again which would be nice but er you don't have to just spend it on yourself you could spend it on your friends or people who need help
S0654	yeah but
S0655	mm
S0654	but what if my friends enter the lottery as well and they all
S0653	i think you need to be stop worry about the other people that enter the lottery
S0654	yeah
S0653	really
S0655	cos they might have win it before
S0653	i would like to have a bath of jelly we could do that with the lottery
S0655	oh yeah
S0654	mum we could just
S0653	cos we've want that for years haven't we
S0655	mm
S0654	we've want we could actually just erm like save up and buy to buy jelly
S0655	we'd have to have a normal bath first
S0653	hang on hang on hang on hang on right so
S0654	we could basically just like save up our money to get jelly
S0653	we could i know but it would we would need a lot what be you gonna say
S0655	well you would have to have a normal bath first
S0653	why
S0655	cos you could eat the jelly cos it would all the jelly would go mucky
S0653	well if we be if we be millionaires we could employ someone to bring a bath er just for jelly and then take it away again er why do you think people think money have money would make them happier you don't know
S0654	mm well
S0653	well some people not everybody enjoy their job so if they didn't have to work any more they would feel that they're probably happy but why do you think not work might make somebody unhappy in the end
S0655	because then they wouldn't be able to see their friends at work it would mean that they be just they would lose a lot of money
S0653	they wouldn't lose a lot of money if they have millions but i think they'd get bore
S0655	yeah
S0653	do you know there be
S0654	i wouldn't
S0653	there be no you probably wouldn't there be a man that win the lottery a while ago he be nineteen and he'd be in and out of prison and i think he win two million pound or something like that and he spend it all all of that money
S0654	how on what
S0653	he race cars he buy a big house he have lot of party and people all of his neighbour didn't like him because he be really antisocial and he have lot of noise and lot of people come in and out but anyway he's lose it all and i think he er then he go back into prison for a bite so obviously didn't make him very happy do it
S0655	no
S0653	so i think it depend on the kind of person you be if i have a million pound i would give lot of it away to charity and i'd probably set up my own charity and i would give lot of money to our friends that need it and i would buy an aerial hoop and lot of jelly i would have an i would have a little studio with an aerial hoop in it just for me
S0654	and we would go and we would find it and just jump on your hoop
S0653	you would jump on it
S0655	yeah and we'd
S0653	well you'd hurt yourself
S0655	and we'd erm er make somebody cushion all the wall
S0653	right
S0655	and er make
S0653	you could have a bouncy room
S0655	yeah we could have like this entire we could pay the neighbour to move out
S0655	and then we could and we could whack down all the wall
S0653	do you know what it make me laugh that even if you're still talk about stay in this house yes okay so let's design our dream house if we have millions of pound so i definitely would like a swim pool and an a circus room er and a zoo
S0655	i know exactly what we could do
S0653	okay
S0655	erm all the neighbour next to us and all the neighbour in front of us pay all of them to move out
S0653	so we'd have this whole strip of nine house

S0654	have ten eleven
S0655	maybe people erm load of people
