S0612	oh i'm so proud of you
S0610	my boss be so gonna be like erm can we chat
S0612	well what can she say like
S0428	you might get you might get fire and then that's quite good cos your decision's
S0610	yeah
S0428	make for you
S0612	just can't tell her though erm
S0610	it's just a bite of work on the side though isn't it
S0428	i just
S0612	be you maybe it's just that i need to just tell them and say look i'm do some freelance work but like i get this out of the blue like i i wasn't gonna go and ask their permission to go and do it like you know i just i dunno it seem a bite weird i wonder whether i should put it in though
S0428	it's not like it's not at all kind of compete against
S0612	no absolutely
S0428	it's not direct competition
S0612	it's absolutely not and if i ask they'd be absolutely fine with it i'm just wonder whether
S0428	i think it's fine
S0612	's so erm be now a manager she's get an assistant now she's i mean she's just very fortunate to be in where she be but anyway and erm she's say things about that like i'm just like dude this be what we've always complain about be like with us like she's like so be do some freelance work and she just tell me she didn't even ask me and i be like so and she's like okay like like fuck off be this what happen to everyone when they they have an assistant they feel like they own their live
S0428	mm what do she work in
S0612	erm who she be on our team but she be restaurant editor
S0428	so what do that mean
S0612	she be in charge of all restaurant menus and everything
S0428	oh that's why she want to do this side business of she's
S0612	cos that's what she do already
S0428	yeah
S0612	and
S0428	well that's really cool
S0612	she's just very fortunate especially like the restaurant business she's she's on the restaurant business side and i'm on the media on media so because of that erm so because of that they have a lot of money cos the restaurants be earn shitloads of money so she ask for she ask for pay rise and she get it whereas we just don't and then like she's get work come in she get an assistant you know and like when she get an assistant i be so bitter cos i be like at the time i be do magazine like i have so many project and i be like that's so fuck unfair cos i work so much harder than you do and you're get a an assistant and i be like and she's like and i'm gonna ask for load of money if i'm manage someone and i be like it's so unfair
S0428	mm
S0612	i guess now it make sense
S0428	do you start at the same time with her have she be there longer than you
S0612	no a shorter time but it's because she be she's be she's do a different so
S0428	yeah yeah yeah it's just totally different
S0612	i be employ as i'm on i'm i'm on in the media i don't wanna be in a restaurants and she be employ as a restaurant editor so even though up until recently we both be earn the same amount of money we're both on the same level even though her title be better
S0428	or better what do better mean
S0612	oh cute have share it have like it
S0428	ah
S0612	have comment on it
S0610	sorry obsessive

S0610	yeah
S0428	it's so lame
S0612	remember us when you're like a bite star but then i be like but if somebody read that like your boss then they'd be like

S0610	okay so just be normal yeah
S0428	probably best to be not cos if you if you be then to like stop yourself it would be really even more awkward
S0610	yeah
S0612	and
S0610	so it's and i've meet before
S0612	you have
S0428	i don't think i have
S0610	who who have a room when and i be stay that time when we stay at 's be that

S0428	she's all over facebook isn't she
S0612	oh god

S0612	i i think she's nice but like the same thing like she always have to have an be you friends with her on facebook
S0610	i i don't see anything i don't see anything from her so no
S0612	you're probably not then cos she's so opinionated and i appreciate she be an intelligent girl she's get i mean i i agree with a lot of her opinions
S0428	and she work in politics so she's obviously around those kind of people
S0612	yeah
S0428	all the time and i no i always agree with her
S0612	i agree with her but it's like you're be opinionated and the other day she write an opinion like what be it oh yeah so when er the syrian airstrikes get pass through the house of commons and there be that awful house of commons debate when it be just like gentlemen's club like oh yeah like everyone like yeah let's bomb them you know like all this like ridiculous and i think obviously there be an uproar on facebook and everyone be like i can't believe we're bomb blah blah blah and her her status be erm while i do agree that i would probably erm have my opinion er like i would probably have vote against er bomb syria erm due to the lack of any er long term plan er this she say something like erm people be say that this isn't a majority vote but actually a lot of the country be for this so but i she say it and i be just like you be just put this down to have a different opinion to everybody else
S0428	mm
S0612	to just make a point like basically you're say the same thing as everyone else you just don't need to say that you know and she's just like you're just say pointless things shut up anyway i'm be a bite mean

S0612	yeah
S0428	at inappropriate moments
S0612	yeah it be really good
S0428	yeah
S0612	it's a really nice show cos it's basically people with disabilities or they're like long term disfigurement or even dwarf right who find it really hard to date cos they're see as freak or weird or whatever and the show
S0428	mm
S0612	just like really and even tourette's actually and erm the show just show just like how normal these people be and like just sort of raise awareness about what asperger's be and like why people be like they be and and they and they're get put on date and it's not about you'd think it's like just a ridicule thing like they're put on a date and see how they like fuck it up but it's not that at all
S0428	it's not
S0612	like sometimes they like it go really well or and it's like really nice you just think

S0428	marry at first sight so literally
S0610	yeah it's it's a channel four thing i it should still be on the internet somewhere
S0428	yeah
S0610	erm and yeah they it be a a scientific social experiment to see if six scientists of different field they be like psychology erm be it er like behaviour erm personality erm er build like er what you look like
S0428	yeah
S0610	and they have like six hundred applicants and this er the point be that you would be match by these scientists accord to what science dictate erm how you who you would end up with and so you'd go like the first episode be like how they do it and what they're what they're do and then they match they get three couple by the end of it and then basically these couple never meet the first time they meet be when the girl walk down the aisle
S0612	it literally that
S0610	and
S0612	and their first word be just before they say i do basically
S0428	no way
S0612	it actually happen
S0428	and what
S0610	and then they're
S0428	people go through this
S0610	they're also their first conversations to be like hi be in front of all of their friends and family
S0428	oh my god
S0610	on both side and it's like so what do you do
S0612	honestly
S0610	and like everybody's there watch them and then
S0612	and
S0428	and they they have no choice like they have to get marry
S0612	yes
S0428	or

S0612	but at that point
S0612	when everyone have make the effort to be there your whole family be there everyone be dress up they've come to your fuck wed
S0428	you must be mental to go ahead with that right
S0612	i know but like you would have think that people be just a bite insane or whatever but they be quite sane people weren't they and they be just like
S0610	yeah really professional and they be just i want to meet somebody and i've try all these other ways of go out i've do the internet i've you know bump into people i've put myself out there and i've just not have any luck so i'm gonna leave it down to science
