S0017	why do it show
S0018	so how much be your insurance
S0017	it would be without the discount about seven hundred and fifty
S0018	mm between the two of you
S0017	no each
S0019	no each
S0018	oh
S0017	cos each of us have the other as a nominate second driver
S0018	oh be that be that why it cost more
S0017	it shouldn't be much more for that for us because of the length and because it's only occasional use each of us for the other car
S0018	mm
S0017	yeah but um
S0019	yours would be more but it wouldn't be as much as if you be a young you know sort of eighteen nineteen year old um your age will tend to lower their premiums a bite
S0018	even though i've get no experience
S0019	mm if you be a newly qualify driver of what seventeen eighteen although women's tend to be lower than men's but they've
S0017	it have be yeah
S0019	buy this equalisation thing
S0017	but you could be pay two thousand four thousand pound
S0019	two thousand
S0018	how much
S0019	yeah for one year
S0018	for one person for one year
S0017	yeah yeah
S0019	mm hm
S0018	em
S0019	as you be much older than that yours won't be as high
S0017	the risk factor be in young people
S0019	mm
S0017	start to drive
S0019	they be more likely to have accidents
S0018	so i doubt whether yours would be anything like that much
S0018	mm yes i guess they've get they might have less life experience so that might make them more prone to accidents but i think a twenty year old brain be so
S0019	not at all
S0018	it assimilate new things a lot more quickly and
S0019	not at all
S0018	no no i think it's true
S0017	yes but it that it tend to build confidence where confidence isn't justify
S0018	true true but i think you get use to things a lot more quickly
S0019	yes but you tend to be a bite more reckless
S0018	mm
S0019	young males particularly
S0018	mm
S0019	the number of young males who have a an accident within the first twelve months of get their license be fairly considerable not so great for women cos i think majority of women tend to be a bite more cautious
S0018	mm
S0019	but boys certainly don't
S0018	so why do they why didn't they continue to let women pay less insurance
S0019	because of a silly eu directive
S0017	em equality
S0018	but you could argue the equality case for anything surely like
S0017	yeah that's why it's stupid
S0018	that's ageist to charge me more money on a bus just because you know my grandmother could only pay seventy five p that's ageist
S0017	yeah
S0019	no it it be a ridiculous thing
S0017	when insurance have always be base on statistical probabilities
S0018	huh exactly
S0017	the level of risk
S0018	yup
S0017	and age be acknowledge as be a significant additional risk but and up till now
S0018	youth
S0017	women's risk rate have be lower than young women's be lower than men's but they be now say that you can't make that discrimination anymore which be show how ludicrous discriminatory laws become
S0019	absolutely it's ridiculous
S0018	yeah so age or youth be more of a risk than lack of experience
S0017	i think there's a
S0019	well there's a correlation
S0017	they probably go together on a graph and it become a point where um your inexperience um have less effect than your age
S0018	mm hm
S0019	it's the old say a lot of familiarity breed contempt that a lot of young drivers be so supremely confident in their own ability that it lead them to reckless drive and that's what get them into most of the problems
S0018	mm yes i think i'll be super safety conscious all the time
S0017	and the young ones be rather more to imbibe
S0019	yes
S0017	um reckless quantities of red wine um which i'm sure you've grow out of
S0019	no it it it be a stupid rule and it's come out of the eu as of most of stupid rule do and it's ludicrous
S0018	mm
S0019	but no you'll be you'll be fine
S0017	i'm amaze the insurers and politicians didn't fight it much more strongly
S0018	well i guess the insurers don't care because what they lose on the male's pay they'll just add to the female's bill
S0019	but it won't mean the males will pay any less it just mean that females will pay the same
S0018	really
S0019	uh huh
S0018	oh they be probably laugh all the way to the bank then that's probably why they didn't fight it
S0019	mm oh yeah there's no reduction for the men's charge it just mean that the women's go up
S0017	we don't know if that's the truth
S0019	to match the men's we do well we'll see but no there's no way of tell and i you have to shop around as well for insurance
S0018	mm
S0019	you have to get you know as many sort of quote you can possibly get because some be more expensive than others
S0018	mm
S0019	and it very much depend i suppose on what sort of car you have as well you want to get a car that's in the lowest insurance band
S0018	what kind of car would that be
S0017	it's eh not a specific kind in term of make but eh not anything that be high performance not anything that be modify to perform better so it would be in general the basic model in most range and the smaller car's the better
S0019	the smaller engine capacity um tend to be the best ones do do emissions have any bear on insurance
S0017	no
S0019	no
S0017	no
S0018	that's road tax be it
S0019	yeah so you want to go for one that have the lowest emissions and lowest engine capacity
S0018	mm
S0019	to get the cheapest outcome
S0018	and what be it i hear about there's some kind of little black box that's be instal into cars that track i don't know what it track but then that inform the insurance company of how much to charge you or something
S0017	yeah
S0019	it record the moments before any accident or anything
S0017	no it's more than that it's actually record
S0019	all the time be it
S0017	the type the drive style i don't know whether it's sample or record a hundred percent of the time but um and the amount of hours drive and the distance drive
S0019	but if you have one of these in the car it push your your insurance premiums down
S0017	but we i pay less i can't remember what mileage we've set for yours but mine be base on nine thousand miles a year your mother's be base on i forget it no idea maybe five thousand miles a year
S0019	sound about right
S0017	em and we get a reduction for that sorry be you pick that up on the record
S0018	for for only go for only go a certain distance
S0019	mm
S0018	mm
S0019	well if you for the sake of argument you be work in oxford and you have a car you'd probably find it more cost effective to use public transport to get there and back because of the petrol consumption park charge cos if you work at a place that provide park space then you get do in tax cos that's taxable it's consider a perk so they tax you on it
S0018	if you don't pay for park
S0019	no if you do pay for if you don't if you're if you have a park space provide at your place of work they do you they charge you extra tax
S0018	on what
S0017	it's a taxable benefit so that's
S0018	yeah i know but what do they pay you on what do they charge you tax on
S0017	on a notional value of the park space
S0018	when do you end up pay that with your road tax
S0017	it's in your no it's in your in your employment tax
S0018	how stupid
S0019	mm hm the only time when you would find have a car useful be in um when it's chuck it down with rain or it's absolutely freeze cold
S0018	so most of the year
S0019	no no no no
S0018	yeah
S0019	no no no that's not right at all and you know it um you just have to go see what the cost be and the problem be of course that once you've get a car you be tempt to use it all the time
S0018	well i'm not go to buy one just to keep it in the garage
S0019	you'll be lucky if you get a garage duck
S0018	well whether i have a car or not at least i'm use this time
S0019	mm hm
S0018	to learn how to drive
S0019	exactly you know it's something that you you really need to do
S0018	mm hm
S0019	so
S0018	yeah it's just difficult to mentalize all the different process go on at the same time and wonder how long it's gonna take for that to become
S0019	it won't take you long
S0018	automatic
S0019	it won't take you long i would say probably at the end of three lessons you'll be do without even think about it
S0018	you think so
S0019	mm hm
S0018	be that be it like that for you
S0019	i only have ten lessons
S0018	oooh
S0018	but do do you go out practice
S0019	no
S0018	no
S0019	oh i'm sorry i drive to swim bath once a week and that's it because a certain person sit next to me be an absolutely rotten passenger when you be try to learn to drive there be the famous example after i have pass my test we be on this caravan site in wales a big wide road
S0017	in wales
S0019	yes it be south wales
S0017	we've never be
S0019	yes we have
S0017	oh it wasn't it be down in devon
S0019	no it wasn't it be we have a triumph help and there be big concrete islands and i be drive up to this perfectly normally at a reasonable speed
S0017	about to run over a man in sandals
S0019	and suddenly your father shout clutch and brake clutch and brake frighten the live daylights out of me
S0018	what be he say
S0019	clutch and brake
S0018	oh okay
S0019	so i stop the car and i say if you want to drive drive if not shut up but he's a terrible passenger i do not advise you under any circumstances to go out with him sit next to you
S0018	i think maybe he'd be quite good
S0017	i be really
S0018	what and this be say after the the sailboat incident where he be try to teach me how to change direction
S0019	yes
S0018	and say he'd give me one set of instructions
S0019	yes
S0018	and then when he actually come to it he say something completely different
S0019	yes
S0017	it's intuitive
S0019	it's it's like him try to teach me how to use the computer instead of stick
S0018	yes
S0019	to the basics
S0018	try be the operative word
S0019	instead of stick to the basics only the things i need to know he start say um and then if you want to do this you press this that and then when you want to do that you press that and i'm think hello i haven't get the slightest idea what you're talk about and then he get ratty when i don't understand and i be just say to you the other day wasn't i shade of granddad and maths
S0017	mm
S0019	this be exactly the same reaction
S0018	i can remember you do that to me when we be do maths
S0019	mm hm
S0018	okay so to be able to understand how to do this you need to understand how to do that and i be like no we've already do that and we need to do this and i need to do it in twenty minutes because i've get something on tv
S0017	that's a big problem with school that each generation do these things in a different way
S0019	yeah that's true
S0017	um
S0019	that's true
S0017	so ideally with any problem you never start from here
S0019	no it always end up in tear if granddad try to teach me anything in maths because it for him he could understand it just like that and couldn't understand why i couldn't so he'd explain it and i couldn't do it so he'd explain it again in exactly the same way and i still couldn't do it then he start get ratty and it be not a good situation it always end up in tear so and he engender the same feel so just stick with and your drive instructor do he say roughly how many lessons people tend to have
S0018	he say everyone ask him
S0019	can't tell
S0018	and he can never answer but um i think if i pay for ten and probably have another ten after
S0019	see how you get on
S0018	yeah but i mean if i'm not go to go out practice i think i prefer to have twenty lessons
S0017	mm well he will say
S0018	mm
S0017	if he think after ten lessons that you're ready to take you test or he'll say you need a couple more lessons before take your test so so you can judge it then
S0019	mm you get a theory test to do as well now haven't you
S0017	yes you do the theory test before you can apply for your
S0019	yep
S0017	main test
S0018	but you can do practice ones on
S0017	do he mention anything about a theory test
S0018	nope
S0017	yeah
S0019	you can do practice ones on the computer as well
S0018	yeah
S0019	so
S0018	well it's good that you can actually learn how to drive before you pass your theory test because in spain you have to pass your theory test before you can get behind the wheel of a car
S0019	really
S0018	yeah which be what put me off do it for so long because you can't even learn how to drive until you've you've already sign up pay all your thousands of euros and do the theory part of the test and you have to learn out about how the car work as well all the mechanics
S0019	really oh crikey if that have be me that would have be i'd never learn to drive depend on how deeply they go into the mechanics
S0018	well it just always put me off
S0019	yeah i can understand why
S0018	i probably would have jump in a car and learn how to drive before if have i not have to
S0019	i didn't realise it be quite as onerous as that in spain
S0018	mm
S0019	and yet their standard of drive be so abysmal so
S0018	be it
S0019	oh yes
S0018	do you notice it really
S0019	yeah yes
S0018	i'd say more the roads i'd i'd definitely say the roads be lay out in a less logical way and a more dangerous way but
S0017	i think that be it's difficult really to make that assessment because the drive that you tend to do when you're abroad be not typical of the drive you'd be do at home cos you'd be travel somewhere unfamiliar on time
S0018	no but when i be in spain around
S0017	i'm talk about us your mother's
S0018	oh right to compare
S0017	your mother's compare but the worst drive we saw be in france
S0019	oh that be
S0017	when we drive down to
S0019	dire absolutely dire mind you there's a lot of drive in this country that be appal
S0017	mm but we i don't think we saw as many patently reckless incidences of people go at massive
S0019	no probably not
S0017	speed in inappropriate condition
S0019	mm no i think that drive in france make me a lot more nervous than drive in spain
S0017	mm
S0019	but more nervous than here but then that maybe just cos i'm use to it here
S0018	why
S0017	oh love you don't like drive beyond your four mile radius of here so
S0019	now that's not true it's alright as long as i can do a recce first and find out exactly where i'm go i can't cope with not know where i'm go and have to drive as well
S0017	okay
S0019	that's my major problem
S0018	what be it about the way they drive in france that make you less confident
S0019	they be drive much faster than the condition dictate and do pull out and pass in in the most ridiculous place it be urgh frighten
S0018	mm
S0019	really frighten actually that's go back a long way as well isn't it
S0017	no it's not that many years it's in the last
S0018	oh you mean when you go to france the last time
S0017	no the time we go and stay near who's your wine merchant
S0017	's place
S0018	what
S0017	yeah
S0019	yeah i suppose
S0017	yeah that be that be where we really saw it
S0019	that be about five years ago six years ago something like that
S0018	yeah
S0017	they just discover today in make the book for go to paxos that it be two thousand and three the last time we go when we go to kefalonia and we have the villa for a week and the yacht for a and the yacht for a week can you see the the level
S0019	but the um even though it's that long ago since we have the villa and the boat we still get a discount on this year's book
S0018	how come
S0019	because they consider that a loyalty reward
S0018	ah
S0019	even though it be along nearly ten years ago
S0017	yes
S0018	so you're go to exactly the same place
S0019	it's one of the place that we sail to from corfu
S0018	ah paxos
S0019	oh and didn't we have a villa on paxos
S0017	yes
S0019	yes we do
S0017	yes
S0019	it be the quaint little place with the outside loo
S0018	so be you sail do any sail
S0019	well i'm not
S0017	no no
S0019	he'll probably hire a motor boat cos you won't be able to keep him off the water but eh we're not have a a yacht
S0017	unless 's down there
S0019	too bloody expensive
S0018	who's
S0017	he's the rigger of the boatyards
S0019	oh yes yeah
S0017	and he spend quite large chunk of the summer out in that area in the ionian area um get these charter company's boat ready for use and then do repair and during season
S0019	not surely
S0017	no no no it's for the company that be connect with ionian island holiday
S0019	nisos
S0017	no no that be when we do it it be now it's island sail or something
S0019	i wonder if be still go
S0017	yes they be
S0019	mm with the same people
S0018	where
S0017	who know
S0019	who know
S0018	where be paxos
S0017	do you know where corfu be
S0018	mm hm
S0017	paxos be a little island seven miles south of corfu
S0018	oh
S0017	a a mere step as your mother would tell you
S0018	can you fly directly
S0017	you fly to corfu and then get the ferry down to paxos
S0018	so you will be do a little sail
S0019	the ferry if it's the eh hydrofoil it's not what you'd call sail it doesn't take very long to get there but i come back on it didn't i that once
S0017	mm that wasn't a hydrofoil i'm sure that be an ordinary
S0019	no it wasn't it be hydrofoil definitely be a hydrofoil
S0017	that's not what i envisage as a hydrofoil the hydrofoils i've be on in greece have be the old russian build ones which be sort of enclose and they're
S0019	well this one be
S0017	but but i'm sure i saw you out on deck
S0019	no
S0017	when you go past there
S0019	nope there be nowhere on deck it be all
S0017	yeah
S0019	it be like a bus really
S0017	they they make an awful noise they rattle like mad
S0019	i don't think this one rattle from what i can remember but it be it didn't take long cos i leave at about four five o'clock in the even
S0017	i can't remember
S0019	and i be back um you'd set off in the morning to sail back and i be back about the same time as you so it really be a a quick and quite comfortable journey it wasn't bad at all where be it that we get pick up in that speed boat
S0017	that be to go from corfu to paxos
S0019	the little one
S0017	but the first time yeah
S0019	yeah the very first time
S0017	we pay extra to have this high speed service
S0019	that's right yep that's right that be quite excite wasn't it
S0017	yes
S0019	a bite hard on the back cos it sort of bump just like you drive speed oh that be fun
S0017	yes
S0019	yes but it be jolly hard on the back
S0017	that's where you get your drive practice
S0019	yeah wow
S0018	i think i'm better at steer a car than i be steer a motor boat
S0019	good i be relieve oh that be fun that area isn't particularly nice but it be
S0018	why do you decide to go there in the end
S0019	that's a very good question
S0017	which one
S0018	paxos
S0017	oh paxos
S0019	oh paxos
S0017	right yes no i think you be talk about delta weren't you
S0019	mm
S0018	why do you decide to go to paxos
S0019	we like paxos didn't we
S0017	yeah it's eh to some extent in desperation at decide on somewhere if you go somewhere different you don't know what to experience we've be to paxos a couple of time um so we have a good idea what it's go to be like and it's
S0019	and the time of year there will still be a lot of the flower and it will still be quite green
S0018	be it quite pretty
S0019	yes in a
S0017	yes it be
S0019	yeah it be in a quaint sort of way
S0017	mm
S0019	it's very different to what we call pretty here
S0017	there be a lot of olive groves so you've get sort of rocky soil with olive tree in and then but also there be a fair amount of other greenery and shrubbery
S0019	mm no it's it's very pleasant and we we walk didn't we to logos
S0017	i'm not so sure we didn't walk to on one occasion
S0019	no we didn't walk to that be too far we do walk to logos and it take you up all over the hill and it's very very pretty
S0017	will take me new walk shoe this time
S0019	or i should just take my trainers as per usual
S0018	how far be it
S0017	mm
S0019	two three miles
S0017	yeah
S0019	but it be very very pretty
S0017	mm hm
S0019	they've still get the the some of the pretty spring flower um i must say it be very green cos later on in the season it isn't it's like a lot of place it's brown but eh no very nice and there be little villages load of flower and plant in pot in window box and things like that very pretty
S0017	and paxos be a low tourist resort not a not like corfu which be overwhelm with tourists
S0017	mm
S0019	oh corfu be vile the last time we go there wasn't much greek leave there
S0018	mm
S0019	it be just a giant tourist island it be not nice
S0017	i remember the smell that night we moor up in corfu harbour
S0019	urgh corfu town urgh urgh
S0017	it be great to get away
S0018	when be you not worry about the greek situation
S0017	i be concern but bear in mind we're fly with um it will be thompson or i can't remember if it be thomas cook or thompson
S0019	one of the two
S0017	um and you're not actually go on to the greek mainland so if there be air traffic it's less likely to be air traffic than grind staff can problems aside
S0018	yeah
S0017	i think paxos and the other islands be less at risk than the mainland airports i may be wrong but
S0018	oh be you worry about it for strike action
S0017	yes yeah
S0018	oh they'll probably do just do what spain do and when the air traffic controllers go on strike they just get the army in
S0017	mm
S0019	yep
S0018	keep the because greece be pretty much rely on tourism now no for
S0017	a lot of a lot of the islands have no other income at all
S0019	mm that's right so i think they would be extremely silly to do anything like that but eh with the riot that's be although there be a letter in the paper the travel section of the telegraph that say somebody have be to athens where there be supposedly
S0017	oh yeah
S0019	all these riot and they say there be really very little so you don't know who to believe do you
S0018	well obviously they've be happen it's just you're not
S0019	yes
S0018	if if people be riot they're not gonna be riot all the time and in all areas of the city
S0019	yeah
S0018	it's go to happen in specific place at specific time that
S0019	but this person indicate that where it be report that there be real big riot they saw very little there be some people on the streets they say um but it be a couple of hours and that be it so you don't know what to believe
S0018	well if it's a riot for a couple of hours it's a riot isn't it
S0019	it be but it doesn't seem
S0018	but you never know what whether to trust the newspaper because they're report it out of proportion or they're report it less because they don't want people to think that the situation be as important or as critical as it be it's you never trust
S0019	i don't know i don't know
S0017	yeah yeah
S0019	but you can't we've just get to eh hope for the best because there wasn't anywhere else that be getatable from here that we want to go i mean we'd have like to have go back to france but there's nowhere you can get to that we want to go without at least a two and a half hour three hour drive
S0018	yeah
S0019	and more actually um you know we would have like to have go around the biaritz area but there's no airport anywhere near there
S0018	no
S0019	nope
S0018	be there not a biaritz airport
S0017	no there's no airport where you can fly direct from
S0019	from they all go through paris
S0017	and that be and that be the limitation we put on
S0018	eh yeah
S0019	you don't really want to fly into paris and then have to fly out again
S0018	no
S0019	cos the gaulle airport be its signage be abysmal
S0018	it's like a rabbit warren isn't it
S0019	it be and there be no sign to tell you where you're suppose to go i think it be all awful i hat it i can't even remember why we go what we be do
S0017	probably visit somebody that be live and work there
S0019	i can't remember but it wasn't very nice not nice at all
S0018	and so when be you go
S0017	fourth of june
S0019	that's the monday
S0017	yes
S0019	we're go on the monday
S0018	for two weeks
S0017	yeah
S0018	super
S0019	so we don't quite know what the position of the cat will be
S0018	let's see how things turn out
S0019	mm
S0018	what's go on
S0019	mm hm
S0018	but i'm sure that i mean if or or if or whichever neighbour be come in to deal with yours that they could somehow deal with mine if we need to
S0019	i i wouldn't like to ask to deal with yours as well as ours
S0018	why
S0019	because we've get to work out how we deal with yours because we can't leave them out all the time with the food out
S0017	i i don't think that be yeah i think the bigger problem be the cat flap that yours will eventually find out how to get outside
S0018	oh i don't think that's a problem because one one cat can't get through the cat flap cos it's too fat
S0017	he it might block it and none of them can get back in
S0018	and the other one if she hasn't learn by now how to use it from watch the others use it and i've open it for her as well and she's go through but she's not even try to work out how to open it herself i don't think all of a sudden she's go to learn when you're on holiday
S0019	i i'm just a bite nervous about leave them out all day and the fact that our bloody cat eat your cat's food
S0018	but when you go away on holiday do someone come round and lock your cat in for the night
S0017	no
S0018	so you're cat can go out well if it's go to be summer why don't we just um restrict your cat to downstairs and my cat to upstairs
S0019	well we can't really other than
S0017	doesn't work do it the the barrier
S0018	kitchen door
S0019	mm it just mean that whoever come in to fee them have get to make sure that they're in there um they don't escape
S0018	well they're hardly go to escape be they
S0019	no but it's difficult when you've get four of them to try and round up particularly and they be much more difficult to control
S0017	i think the the bigger problem be each eat the others food than i think yours yours be quite relax in wander about the house and apart from create explosions at intervals the others aren't that fuss
S0019	no i suppose the only problem be the the food situation i think it would be better if if eh well whoever come to fee them click the cat flap so that they can't get out but can get in
S0018	what when
S0019	when they come in at night to fee them
S0018	oh so you do normally do that
S0017	we haven't ever ask whoever's look after them to do that
S0018	cos normally you get someone to come in once a day nay
S0019	no because it's just our cat come twice a day
S0017	morning and even
S0018	oh okay
S0019	but i would rather he do the morning and then do the even cos be not very reliable on do the cat trays
S0018	or the set the house alarm
S0017	mm
S0019	no that's another problem um i think if we get to do the morning and ask to do the even it would be better
S0018	mm
S0019	because there's your cat trays to be do as well
S0018	yeah but if you're away for two weeks what i can just do be leave four cat trays
S0019	oh the smell
S0018	yeah i know but eh i don't know how much we can actually ask other people to do or
S0019	mm
S0018	if i'm in the country i'll just come back at the weekend to sort things out
S0017	we've get to make provisional arrangements and then sort it out once we know specifically what's happen where you're go to be and
S0017	we'll see what happen
S0019	unless could come in and do the trays
S0018	the only problem be i think have book a holiday with her family in the south of spain around that time
S0019	right
S0018	but again if nobody's here the fact that there be four cat trays sit there isn't go to inconvenience anybody but mm i'm more worry about i think i think they should be probably keep separate either my cat upstairs in those two room or my cat use the house and your cat have the kitchen the conservatory and the garden
S0019	i think it's better that way because i would hate now to confine your two since they've be use to wander the house i think it would be awful to shut them in those two room for two weeks i don't think that's fair at all
S0018	but do you think it's equally fair on your cat to
S0019	yes
S0017	well at least they've get the conservatory and in summer they do spend more time in the conservatory and they'll often sleep overnight in the conservatory
S0019	and also
S0017	and they've get the garden
S0019	yup and in the summer i mean when we've be away before
S0017	mm
S0019	we've shut all the doors so that they've have really only the land and the hall extra
S0017	and one bedroom
S0019	and one bedroom
S0017	yeah so i can't really see that that would be a problem
S0017	yeah
S0019	if we shut them in the kitchen they've get plenty of room they've get plenty of bed in the kitchen and the conservatory and if it's nice weather they'll go out into the garden anyway
S0018	yeah
S0019	so i think that's probably the best solution
S0018	yes i don't i just feel a bite bad constrict your cat to
S0019	they'll survive don't worry
S0018	i know they will but obviously if it would be more difficult if someone be lock them in at night and they still only have the kitchen then again they're only use they're use to only be able to go in the kitchen aren't they
S0017	mm night time though
S0019	yeah kitchen and conservatory so it isn't go to make any difference to them
S0018	we'll see
S0019	it'll be difficult because this be the first time we've leave the kitten for more than a couple of days
S0018	they're not really kitten anymore though
S0019	no but i say the kitten to differentiate them from the others but they've never be leave
S0017	no
S0019	for that length of time it's only be three or four days at the most so but they'll cope it won't be a problem
S0017	well that's right we get or his wife's parent come in while we be away yeah sorry
S0019	yeah they kitten sit
S0018	from the upholsterers
S0017	yes
S0019	well it be 's parent
S0018	oh they come and live here
S0017	yeah
S0019	mm hm no it go very well but can't even remember where we go it's go in the mist
S0017	no
S0018	somewhere sunny as long as it have sun for you you don't care where it be
S0017	memorable
S0019	no
S0017	no it wasn't anywhere like that
S0019	no it it wasn't i haven't be anywhere sunny this june will be two years
S0018	aw
S0019	since we go to france
S0018	when be the last time
S0019	when we go to france
S0018	yeah but when be that
S0019	two years ago in june remember you do the correspondence
S0018	oh yeah yeah um arcechamp
S0019	mm hm that be two years ago so i haven't be anywhere since
S0018	aw
S0019	so i've have no sun for two years cos last summer here be not very good
S0018	isn't every summer here not very good
S0019	no no we have have some nice weather but last year be awful wasn't it
S0017	yeah
S0019	we didn't get any at all can you do that parcel and then i can go and post it

S0019	it's the course 's course
S0018	oh
S0019	so that's all i've get to do today be in to be to the bank do some shop eh those be the total commitments for today mm tomorrow be a bite busier cos i get eh chris come at half past nine it be half past nine and then i've get tennis at two so that's it and then wednesday i've get come at half past nine again i've get to get nanny to the hairdressers by half past eleven i've get the osteopath at half past three and then i've get aqua aerobics at six o'clock
S0018	that one's a busy one there
S0019	so wednesday be go to be busy but that's okay i can cope i can cope
S0018	i mean be you still think of go to australia to visit the family or
S0019	we have to decide fairly soon what we're go to do um we have to make the decision because i've get to find somewhere for nanny to go for the month that we're away
S0018	oh yeah
S0019	um so unless you'd like to go and live with her for a month
S0018	i wouldn't mind i just don't know where i'm gonna be so
S0019	no that's ok
S0018	that's the problem
S0019	and it's impossible to travel from to wherever you're go to be if you carry on with the course
S0018	don't know might be drive by then
S0019	you might you might i just have to play it by ear i can't i can't think that far ahead
S0018	mm
S0019	yeah it's it's too much for my little brain
S0018	but when would you go if you go
S0019	em probably march i think em february it's probably still rather warmer than your father like so march and then we might possibly be there for eh 's baby's first birthday
S0018	isn't she have another baby
S0019	mm hm
S0018	when's she
S0019	like now
S0018	oh she's already
S0019	yeah yeah the baby's due very shortly
S0018	i lose track
S0019	yes its sometime in march it's due um i don't know when
S0018	it
S0019	she
S0018	oh oh she's have another girl
S0019	she be have another girl i say to be there any vague possibility that it might actually get at a boy this time she say no we don't seem to do boys
S0018	and eh pregnant again
S0019	nope nope so
S0018	maybe they'll have a boy next time
S0019	mm who know and i can't remember what birthstone be for march i think it's amethyst
S0018	no amethyst be may
S0019	no emerald be may
S0018	oh really i think may be amethyst
S0019	nope emerald be may
S0018	oh
S0019	because 's birthday be the first of may and i send that emerald the little flower emerald thing so
S0018	do you get a thank you letter in the end
S0019	in the end
S0018	how long do it take
S0019	well i i tell you what i say to i say can i ask you a sensitive question she sort of say yes have we do something to upset and and she say no not that i know of why and i say well we have never have an acknowledgement from them for anything we've ever send for and there be a sort of silence and eh obviously talk to them and they be both horrify because each of them think that the other one have do it and say they lead such chaotic live they be not organise at all about anything um so she can quite understand why each of them think the other one have do it
S0018	be work
S0019	yes eh part time i think i don't think she's work full time
S0018	what do she do
S0019	um she work for some fundraise organisation i don't know exactly what um but have have i'm not sure she have her on a regular basis but she's certainly have her on and off but i mean she's what seventy two and look after and and i've no doubt she'll look after the little one as well i think she's begin to find it all a little bite too much i mean when she be look after um and she be a lot younger
S0018	how old be they now
S0019	eh be eight i think and i think will be seven this month the end of this month i think there's about eighteen months between them but their style of grandparenting i can quite understand why she's exhaust cos those kid be never allow to do anything by themselves if they paint then 's get to be paint with them if they go and play in the sandpit then and have to be out there with them and i'm think to myself well this doesn't encourage individual play and you know i just
S0018	maybe she will start leave them in the sandpit on their own
S0019	well they ought to be able to by now but oh i go out to play in the sandpit with them but my idea of play be different to to theirs mine be give them an idea and let them get on with it
S0018	distract them
S0019	yeah i do potato print with them um and we do eh collect leave and dip the leave in paint and make the leaf print things like that and different things out of the kitchen that you can make pattern with um and what do we do in the sand pit oh i that's right cos the sand be quite damp and i say oh see if you can make tunnel in the sand dig down and see if you can get the tunnel to to meet in the middle and things like that and just let them get on with it and the response after we'd go be that um aunty and uncle be better at play than nana and grandpa which i think be a little bite difficult but no they don't develop imagination and think for themselves if you're always do things with them you've get to give them the idea and then let them go
S0018	that's the thing katie's daughter i mean she's eighteen months old but i think maybe cos 's a single mum it's she's have to let her do stuff on her own but she she keep herself occupy for half an hour on her own no problem just sit there play and you hear her go na na na na na na like she's pretend to have conversation's between different teddy bear and
S0019	but that's what i use to do with you two andrew be not so good at it with you but no they those be your toy play with them that's what they're there for i mean obviously there be time when you sit down and play as well and you sit and you read but not be with all the time tell them what to do and that's just far too child intensive for me
S0018	i do remember i have a memory of the sand pit we use to have out back here
S0019	mm hm
S0018	but for some reason the only memory i have of it be what it taste like
S0019	that wasn't the object of the exercise but if that be the case then you and your brother be very similar when we be in by then he be eighteen months old he be out in the sand pit and then he come across towards me chew and i flee out to the kitchen and say what have you get in your mouth and he beam at me and he say spider
S0018	urgh in that case i'm totally not at all like my brother because i would not have go near the spider let alone put it in my mouth
S0019	no i i couldn't urgh and of course by the time i look in his mouth there be nothing to be see
S0018	urgh
S0019	it's all extra protein yes i know
S0018	urgh
S0019	strange boy
S0018	didn't he eat a a bulb off a lamp or something
S0019	oh yes dismantle a back lamp on somebody's bicycle take the bulb out and swallow it
S0018	and there be that night where he have to be take to hospital
S0019	oh yes
S0018	for the
S0019	drink the calpol yes dear god oi yoy yoy
S0018	cat be a lot easier than children be they
S0019	you're not kid you're not kid then there be the time he paint with mummy's nail varnish and he shave himself with granddad's razor take all the skin off his chin
S0018	ow
S0019	yep oi oi oi oi not my carpet thank you
S0018	don't scratch the carpet
S0019	cheeky
S0018	how old be he when he do that
S0019	what shave himself mm three
S0018	oh
S0019	possibly it be around the same time that he paint and that be as well i have to say they be the two of them at it but
S0018	be be involve as well or be it against his will
S0019	i've no idea but be there but of course be that know where the nail varnish be so i don't know well i wouldn't like to attribute blame for that
S0018	obviously i must say granddad always use to make shave look such an interest experience
S0019	yes well
S0018	it be all a ritual in the morning of he put his eye in he put his teeth in
S0019	mm hm mm hm
S0018	and then he's start shave
S0019	uh huh
S0018	but he'd get brush and the foam and put that all on his face first then take the the blade it be fun to go and watch granddad in the bathroom in the morning
S0019	yes hm yes well the time you need to worry with be when you hadn't hear or see him for a while eh it be always a worry as to what he be do so it be the same when we go to australia when he get lose and out of the back gate of street so
S0018	where do he go
S0019	eh i don't know whether you remember street
S0018	yeah yeah
S0019	no do you
S0018	yes
S0019	yes of course cos you be there when you be older you know down by the flat where grandma use to live there be a gate at the back and then the alleyway that go both ways and then turn back down street again well he obviously open the gate to see where it lead and the dog have get out so he go after the dog can't find the dog and of course your father jetlagged have go to bed so we have to get him up and i go round the streets with in the car and find him walk down street cry so i leap out of the car and i can't get that dog back be all he could say
S0018	aw
S0019	and when i get him home i say well weren't you worry that you be lose and he say no and i say well why not and i say well how do you know where you be go and which house it be he say well it's the only house in the road that's get a blue door he be absolutely right
S0018	he be lucky that it be the only house on the road that have a blue door
S0019	oh no he'd notice we all we'd do be to drive down the road in the car and stop and unload and somehow he manage to suss that there be only one house in the road that have a blue door
S0018	and do you get the dog back
S0019	yes
S0018	where be the dog
S0019	the dog come back
S0018	the dog the dog know where he live anyway
S0019	yeah so it wasn't a problem oh but oh dear
S0018	be he so be he adopt a dog permanently or be that
S0019	no no it's no a dog he foster a dog and the dog have go back now to somebody he know have adopt him
S0018	oh right
S0019	um so there won't be any more dog but he's have this kitten there's a picture on facebook of it and it's only four weeks old
S0018	aw
S0019	poor little thing
S0018	when be he get it
S0019	well certainly not for another week um i'm surprise they'll let it go because even cat protection league wouldn't let us have the kitten until they be nearly twelve weeks old
S0018	yes but they be super
S0019	yeah
S0018	anal about things weren't they
S0019	yes if you get it from some private individual they'll usually let them go until after eight weeks seven or eight weeks em but they've get to be inoculate defleed check over by a vet because the one worry about have them from those sort of condition this cat flu em this feline leukaemia thing so they've get to be check over by a vet um then he's get to make arrangements for somebody to come and fee it while he's at work
S0018	oh of course
S0019	cos it's too little to be leave all day um
S0018	can't he take it to work in his pocket
S0019	bring your cat to work week yes
S0018	it'll be tiny put it in his pocket
S0019	so until he get all that sort eh he can't make any arrangements as to when he can have the kitten and i be assume that it's be take away from the house and into the rescue centre
S0018	oh
S0019	but i'm not absolutely sure
S0018	but be it the woman who phone the rescue centre to get them to come and pick them up or be it
S0019	i don't know whether it be a concern family member or neighbour or what i have no idea but eh it certainly look a cute little thing
S0018	little black cat
S0019	yeah a little fluffy
S0018	be it female or male
S0019	male
S0018	yeah alright but
S0018	could be female name too he's get a female cat call
S0019	yes but her name be i suppose it could be i suppose like my goldfish that we call
S0018	when it be a female goldfish
S0019	yeah i win it at the fair bring it home in a plastic bag put it in a fish bowl on the sideboard and that be fine except when we move we decide we didn't really want to take a goldfish with us so we give it to my uncle who have a fish pond in his garden and then we discover that it wasn't it be but it lead a charm life because use to sit on the side board and he would feign indifference until he would realise that we weren't look and in go the paw try to catch it he never do so no it's be the best place for it really it's cruel it's cruel to keep a goldfish in a round small round bowl
S0018	it be but do it survive okay in the fish pond
S0019	oh yeah yeah oh it last for years in the fish pond
S0018	it wasn't too cold
S0019	no
S0018	and didn't it freeze over in the winter
S0019	i don't know what he do initially when he to but it it survive remarkably well
S0018	where do he live
S0018	oh
S0019	i can't remember whether you ever go there i think you do actually
S0018	oh be he would he be the father the cousin that's just die
