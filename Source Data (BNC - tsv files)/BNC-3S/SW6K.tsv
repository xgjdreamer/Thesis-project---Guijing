S0419	car pass the mot
S0012	that pass it oh brilliant
S0419	yeah cor that'd have be a nightmare that have i've have i've be do it since saturday i think
S0012	yeah
S0419	yeah and i go even down the old bank holiday monday and er that be the the what they what we use to call a fan belt and they call an auxiliary erm drive belt
S0012	oh
S0419	because that don't just drive well it don't drive the fan any more because
S0012	no that doesn't
S0419	there's no fan cos er that's an electric fan and that's not drive off the engine
S0012	yeah
S0419	and erm that go round the air condition pump that go round the crank
S0012	oh yeah that's right
S0419	that go round the power steer and that go
S0419	and they go and that go round two one tensioner pulley and then another adjust pulley
S0012	yeah
S0419	and that go round in that's a jigsaw puzzle really to figure out and you haven't get the room cos the belt be wider than the gap
S0012	oh yeah to get it into
S0419	and the side of the inner wing so you have to twist it to get it in and then you get to make sure that run how that suppose to run
S0012	yeah
S0419	i have to replace it
S0012	time chain that run the time
S0419	there ain't no time chain there time belt that's the separate one that
S0012	yeah it's a separate
S0419	that's another one inside
S0012	that's another one yeah
S0419	but the problem be the belt go and that be get worse and worse cos that be chafe off and move over cos they run in them little
S0012	yeah they do yeah
S0419	thin groove
S0012	that's right yeah
S0419	an old groove so i erm what do i do yeah what happen what cause it be a chip in the in the tension pulley there be a chip out of it
S0012	yeah
S0419	cos they make of some i don't suppose that's plastic similar to plastic material than the actual pulley and that bite of chip come off it and and then that cut the belt and as the belt go over it that cut more and more doesn't it
S0012	yeah yeah
S0419	so basically you end up with no belt so i have to get another tensioner pulley sixty one pound and twenty p and erm
S0012	couldn't you get one up the yard
S0419	well
S0012	must be
S0419	you get get half and if that's any good
S0012	that's true that be true if that's no good then
S0419	you cos that's a lot of aggravation to go to but that's a nightmare to to fit
S0012	yeah
S0419	because for the one reason that go that's get a shoulder on on the pulley
S0012	yeah
S0419	on the bottom of the pulley and then that go in a recess that shoulder
S0012	yeah
S0419	well what have happen that have seize into the shoulder so you you you couldn't normally you can get on the other vehicle the other pulley you've get a square drive on a three inch no a quarter drive innit
S0012	yeah yeah and you
S0419	and you can turn that and then that that'll then push the belt that and push that other pulley up and then you can pin it so that hold up in the air
S0012	yeah
S0419	but because it be seize in the you couldn't loft it up on there
S0012	oh crikey
S0419	so in the end i have to take the power steer pump off
S0012	what
S0419	the alternator off erm what else something else er alternator power steer pump and then to get to the the bottom the where that go on to the er there's like a spring heavy duty fairly heavy duty spring
S0012	yeah
S0419	two erm fittings where bolt go fully
S0012	yeah
S0419	i have to take the whole erm cast off at the engine
S0012	all of the all of those off yeah
S0419	yeah take the whole cast what hold everything
S0012	yeah
S0419	to get this bite because you have to get it off to get through this hole to to undo this
S0012	yeah
S0419	this thing to get the the spring out to get the
S0012	oh god
S0419	so that be a cor that be a nightmare cos you ain't get the right you have the right tool for everything
S0012	well you do yeah
S0419	so i i try to make tool up
S0012	yeah
S0419	didn't finish it till about five o'clock yesterday
S0012	didn't you
S0419	no cos erm i have to cancel the mot cos i'd get to have an mot yesterday that be book for quarter past ten yesterday and i have to cancel it
S0012	but that pass you do a good job do you
S0419	yeah yeah i weld and everything and that just a on one track an end have a little bite play in it and there be one bulb out on the rear light but that's get two you know double double
S0012	yeah so you're okay then that pass
S0419	i'm alright for another year
S0012	well then you just stick a crack rod in next year will you
S0419	yeah i'll do it yeah put em one on and but i reckon i don't know if that will go another year cos i think get the back end that's there's a bite of corrosion get there and that's really awkward weld cos that's sort of right where the back suspension rod be
S0012	oh right
S0419	and that's right above that so
S0012	be it oh
S0419	i do a fair bite of weld on one side today
S0013	right just get to nip off to the
S0012	library
S0013	library
S0419	i've postpone you

S0419	oh yeah
S0013	the erm computer doesn't print from
S0012	what again
S0013	computer it's
S0012	i'll sort that
S0419	what's that wireless
S0012	yeah yeah
S0419	yeah that do play up sometimes don't they
S0012	yeah that's easy enough to do cos that's she she'll put it print but that won't print by wi fi so you just get to change that to wi fi and then it'll print look i don't know why it won't stay on
S0419	no that's weird innit i don't have a lot of trouble with the wi fi on on the printer but what i do have if anything get stand on top of the printer
S0012	yeah
S0419	you know we'll put like paper and things and then they get taller and taller
S0012	yeah they do don't they
S0419	and then that put some sort of pressure on the top of the printer and then that that won't go
S0012	no
S0419	that jam the actual cartridge where that run up and down
S0012	yeah
S0419	that the the print head be jam so you get to open it up
S0012	yeah these printers they're they're so cheap but the ink the ink be dearer than gold
S0419	yeah yeah dearer than gold be it
S0012	what about that hey yeah for how much they put in
S0419	yeah they don't put a lot in do them cartridges do they
S0012	they don't put a lot in now you buy a new printer and you just get enough to print off the sheet and then you get to fill it up you get to get refill
S0419	yeah yeah
S0012	they use to put all the refill in the printer you know
S0419	they get
S0012	you know they don't now they just put a sample in
S0419	that's so they can sell em of a bite cheaper but
S0012	yeah but the money they must earn
S0419	yeah they must earn a lot of money out of the print ink i use to print and mark stuff but i don't print so much now
S0012	no neither do we
S0419	cos i don't know i think that's i think for a couple if i get a colour one i think the black and white one be about ten pound and the colour one be about nineteen or something
S0012	yeah yeah
S0419	yeah about nineteen quid for a
S0012	i think ours be twenty three quid each
S0419	yeah
S0012	cos there's colour ones
S0419	yeah
S0012	there's three different colour you have to buy them
S0419	you get to buy yours individually
S0012	and then there's the the photo black
S0419	yeah
S0012	and then you have to buy the print black so if you're print a photo that's get photo black on it instead of print black
S0419	yes oh
S0012	ah
S0419	i didn't know that i always put do photos just with my ordinary
S0012	yeah yeah

S0012	yeah
S0419	freedom in the kitchen and that cos i use to have all the paper everywhere didn't i
S0012	yeah course you do yeah
S0419	the kitchen roll cover up everything but yeah he's alright but that just that's not change i go home i'll go home now and and when i go home they'll be paper hang over the the the light well i get little light what you if you want to read anything you know
S0012	yeah
S0419	and the paper hang over that and then he take my phone out of the holder on the wall cos we get two one for him and one for me and he cover that up with paper and he cover the tv remote up with the paper and where i sit with the paper
S0012	do he oh dear
S0419	mm god the amount of kitchen roll that's unbelievable yeah that's all good stuff as well
S0012	well he never use to be like that do he
S0419	no no
S0012	where do he get him from
S0419	i don't know no cos i know when he be about fourteen and that fifteen that didn't start till he be just turn sixteen i don't know whether that have anything to do with when he use to work at mcdonald's cos he didn't like the way some of the youngsters there be not very hygienic on their handwash and when they go to the toilet and that
S0012	yeah
S0419	so that could have have something to do with it yeah erm but yeah that isn't that's not improve but it's not get
S0012	worse
S0419	too you know
S0012	too much worse
S0419	the kitchen roll have always be that's always be the same you know it's just that's move from all over the house just into the live room now so it ain't quite so bad erm whereas that use to be all in the kitchen and i couldn't i have to wait while he when he use the the wash machine what i use i have to wait for him to finish
S0012	yeah
S0419	cos if i go home and then i want to go through to the other room i couldn't do till he'd get everything out of the wash machine and then take it up to his bedroom and then i could go past then but then all the kitchen be cover up the floor be all cover with kitchen roll
S0012	be it
S0419	yeah and er cor yeah everywhere that be like the house make of kitchen roll
S0012	it must cost you something doesn't it
S0419	that don't he pay for it out of his money
S0012	do he be he still see anyone about it
S0419	no they they they don't bother any more
S0012	they don't
S0419	they use to come round the clinical nurse but he's have a clinical nurse you know a psychiatric nurse
S0012	yeah
S0419	erm a a psychiatrist and a psychologist
S0012	have he yeah they can't get through to him
S0419	no no that's er well like i say before that's to do with the serotonin and that in the brain and
S0012	yeah
S0419	that's a brain that's a thing in the head
S0012	yeah
S0419	and you know that's no matter how much you you know that's logic to us but to him that's not logic
S0012	course it isn't no no
S0419	you know and you can tell him and that that don't mean nothing
S0012	no
S0419	you know they
S0012	well the thing be that people have go to in small dose anyway
S0419	yes it's all millions of people all over the world
S0012	if i go outside for instance don't matter whether they touch anything or not if i go outside when i come indoors i have to wash my hand
S0419	yeah yeah
S0012	have to otherwise you know i feel
S0419	yeah
S0012	dirty if you know what i mean so i can understand everything really and be quite similar
S0419	yeah yeah
S0012	would clean up everything and when he come home from work when he be marry to er you know that from
S0419	yeah
S0012	he be marry to her he'd go round and he'd touch stuff and see if that's mucky
S0419	yeah
S0012	you know he he be a bite like that yeah a bite over the top with her of course they use to smoke then anyway so i can't the sense
S0419	no no if you smoke that's
S0012	and if you remember she be almost as bad so cos she would i mean if she have to be be ready she'd be she'd be age and age in the bathroom and stuff and she'd be and and clean up all the time you know so must run in our sort of family
S0419	yeah yeah mm well that that that's surprise even 's friend his wife go at it as well
S0012	yeah
S0419	yeah she she she use to be on the way to get bad but he catch her or he force her to get it see to before that go too far you know
S0012	yeah
S0419	so she she control it a lot more than she use to pull the curtain about so many time and wash her hand till they like use to
S0012	yeah
S0419	he don't do that he just wear plastic gloves all the time
S0012	do he
S0419	yeah he buy box of gloves
S0012	what latex ones or
S0419	yeah sainsbury's they have box of gloves he'll buy a couple of box of them and then sometimes he run out everything he have to put glove on gloves on for erm but yeah he's er
S0012	well it's better than cover stuff up then
S0419	yeah and that's well like he still cover stuff up as well
S0012	that's better for you though
S0419	but he he yeah he use to wash his hand so much they'd all
S0012	get sore and
S0419	go red they be like red and crack open and that
S0012	yeah
S0419	but now cos he wear the gloves and that they you don't er they're not quite so bad as they use to be
S0012	i couldn't well i mean i do feel awful to him but that must be fairly hard for you to put up with all the time innit
S0419	yeah you work round it people do say that but you get in a system you know you get use to you know erm you just sort of work around him you know you get use to he know he trust me if his mum come round to see him he don't trust her he watch where she get what she touch and if he think she's touch something he'll he'll either not use it again or spend age clean or something
S0012	right
S0419	but if she come round i try and be there now so
S0012	yeah
S0419	i make the tea and i get in the kitchen and she all she have to do be if she want to go to the toilet or something she that's it you know he's cos he lock his bedroom i have to put a lock on his bedroom door
S0012	do you
S0419	lock on the toilet bathroom door toilet what i do for him lock on that so he make sure they're all lock up
S0012	so no one else use em
S0419	so nobody else can go in there and that and touch his stuff but he trust me you know you leave his milk in the fridge cos he say he always say i trust dad cos he cos we i know how he work you see so i work round to keep him happy i don't touch his stuff
S0012	yeah no

S0012	yeah
S0419	and so that when they do that they even do different modifications and change the actual car
S0012	yeah
S0419	so you you have to be exactly specific when you want the part
S0012	yeah yeah
S0419	and that's all that's all a way of get you to go to the dealership so they get all the work and charge you phenomenal amount of money
S0012	get all the work yeah yeah yeah

S0012	yeah
S0419	why
S0012	why don't yeah why
S0419	these people be
S0012	they just make it awkward that's just like if anything go wrong with with er them they be tell me down there that this be age ago now they have these motherboards if you like they pull it out and put a new one in and that cost hundreds of pound
S0419	yeah
S0012	it's just like a computer motherboard
S0419	yeah
S0012	you know they they can't tell what's wrong with the motherboard because something have go wrong with it and and that don't the the circuit don't work
S0419	yeah
S0012	well they can find out that the circuit still work but they can't repair it so they have to take the motherboard out fit another motherboard in and then your motor be okay again but that cost hundreds
S0419	yeah
S0012	just for the stupid little pretty circuit
S0419	yeah i say i say to i'd rather have a car what use a little more fuel than all this computerise injection system with all these different electronics
S0012	yeah yeah cos i bet you pay for it in the end don't you
S0419	well yeah well you do you the phenomenal amount of money they they would charge you
S0012	yeah
S0419	because you can't do it yourself if you work it out you're probably worse off
S0012	you be yeah i mean that little one we get out there you open the bonnet up and go better where do you go where do you go from here look for a tool you can't fit anything in it
S0419	no everything's cover up now as well
S0012	it's all cover up yeah
S0419	they get big cover over the top
S0012	even underneath
S0419	yeah
S0012	you go underneath to to look at any anything underneath that's
S0419	yeah
S0012	and that's you get to take half the base away to get to anything on the gearbox or the crank shaft or whatever not the crank shaft but what's that call the one that go from the gearbox to the front end thing
S0419	drive shaft
S0012	drive shaft yeah
S0419	that's the drive shaft on the front or prop shaft on the back

S0419	oh that's my phone it's get flat
S0013	right
S0419	technology you see
S0012	yeah yeah technology be useless
S0419	i think i'll tell you what they how things be go with vehicles if you be if you have the money and you start to make a more basic vehicle for the you know your average handyman
S0012	yeah
S0419	who like to do his own car
S0012	yeah
S0419	i bet you'd be on a winner because
S0012	i bet you would yeah yeah
S0419	because you imagine these people they they buy a car don't they and then they they probably buy it on on hp
S0012	yeah
S0419	didn't they and then you're pay the hp and then something go wrong and then you get to turn round and pay hell and all to have it repair
S0012	yeah yeah that's pathetic it's pathetic i mean i can't do anything on the rover
S0419	no
S0012	do you know i can't even take the wheel off

S0419	oh that's not gear down properly
S0012	that's not gear down you can't jack jack the wheel up i'd have to have the rsc or the aa in to change a puncture i would i i can't do it i try jack it up and and that jack you put the jack in there and that jack the whole side up from the front to the back you put the jack in here and that jack the whole lot up again
S0419	and that do the same thing they don't just jack individual like they use to
S0012	no and of course the wheel be go down all the time because the suspension
S0419	you get to
S0012	yeah and the and the jack they supply be pathetic absolutely pathetic whereas you go up down the and they just reel it underneath pump it up and that or they put it on
S0419	on the car lift
S0012	on the car lift and that's it innit
S0419	your wheel's free or they that's get worse
