S0086	do you say aru
S0084	mm
S0086	okay yeah
S0084	they use to be er apu which be polytechnic but they didn't like the association of be a polytechnic and everybody use to call them apu like apu
S0086	apu
S0086	like er simpsons
S0084	mhm
S0082	i think that would be very nice to be call apu it be quite a nice name

S0082	mm well it's very nice name
S0084	i think they just didn't wanna be call a poly

S0082	yes but i mean that be now er an historic term isn't it
S0084	mm
S0082	because there aren't any more
S0084	no but i think all the universities that be polys be still look down upon and i think leicester you've get leicester university which be a good university but you've get de montfort which be an old poly which
S0082	mm mm
S0084	that's not get as good a reputation
S0082	mm

S0082	mm
S0084	but it be funny
S0082	mm
S0084	i think i'd have to go back to the begin somehow and

S0084	watch them in sequence
S0082	as um mention to me yesterday they've only get the sort of either the third or the fourth series they use to have all all four of them on er on um
S0084	oh lovefilm
S0082	demand

S0082	no on on sort of like like the sort of equivalent of iplayer but it's for warner warner television
S0084	oh right
S0082	so it's on demand um
S0084	on demand right
S0082	but um but they now have only the i think the last series the fourth series
S0084	can you watch it on 4od

S0084	oh right
S0086	but i'm all all above on the payments
S0082	you're up to date aren't you
S0086	yeah
S0082	so they shouldn't be chase up the payments
S0086	or more than up to date they're probably offer me things
S0082	mm
S0084	yeah well they say it be a social call or whatever
S0086	mm
S0084	can't remember
S0086	right
S0084	the phrase they use
S0086	they send me e mail and phone me up and that
S0084	you should pay you should just close it though
S0086	that's what i'm gonna do yeah i just need to pay it off basically all they've want from me so far be sixty quid and we pay them hundred and fifty haven't we
S0082	mm
S0086	yeah
S0082	mm
S0084	well you've get a minimum payment but they only charge the minimum payment cos their interest be almost like thirty percent
S0086	yeah i know exactly so you all they would have want from me minimum payments sixty quid and i've pay them a hundred and fifty so i'm not in any trouble with em
S0084	fine
S0086	you just carry on pay fifty quid off
S0082	mm
S0086	until it's three hundred quid
S0082	yeah
S0086	then it's do
S0082	i keep all the receipt so we have um evidence that
S0084	mm
S0082	it's all pay
S0084	yeah you don't wanna do that rich
S0082	mm
S0086	yeah
S0084	it's really bad
S0086	it's alright though
S0082	yeah i know we
S0086	the only interest i've have so far
S0082	we're get
S0086	be about eight pound
S0082	mm
S0086	that's not bad
S0082	mm
S0084	it's not great
S0086	it's not great no but could be a lot worse
S0084	mm mm mm so i've give chocolate up for lend
S0082	mm
S0084	it turn out sundays don't count
S0082	that's right mm
S0084	sundays
S0086	you can eat all the chocolate on sunday
S0084	be like a mini easter
S0082	mm
S0084	mm
S0082	mm
S0084	i know that the one that's um halfway through like mother sunday didn't count
S0082	mm
S0086	you should give up religion for lend
S0084	well i'm not really do it for religious reason but i'm do it for willpower
S0082	well the the idea originally be that um um lend be a as as you know be a time of you know think about easter what happen at easter that
S0084	mhm
S0082	as oppose to easter egg
S0084	yep
S0082	but also um think about people who be in a worse position than you be
S0084	mm
S0082	and how you can help them
S0084	mm
S0082	and the notion of
S0082	give up things wasn't strictly just to give up things it be to reflect on materialism
S0084	mm
S0086	so you're help all the people
S0082	and
S0086	that can't afford chocolate
S0082	when when you give up things
S0084	mm
S0082	if you save the money you would've spend on the things you're give up and give it to people who have less than you
S0084	yeah
S0082	you have a double benefit then you know and that's that's really what you know
S0084	mm
S0086	so what you really should be do
S0084	be put away fifty p
S0086	isn't just give away chocolate
S0084	every time a chocolate bar
S0086	give up chocolate buy some chocolate and give it to someone
S0084	well if i put money in a
S0086	who can't afford it
S0084	in a jar
S0082	or
S0084	every time i think oh i'm not gonna buy a mar bar
S0082	well i mean i dunno how much a bar of chocolate cost now say it's a pound
S0084	mm
S0082	so if you put a pound in a jar every time you think you might want to buy a bar of chocolate
S0084	mm
S0082	and then
S0084	yeah
S0082	just before easter give it to cafod or
S0084	mm
S0082	or you know oxfam or
S0084	mm
S0082	one of the charities that help um er people in er um poverty stricken areas
S0084	i'm definitely gonna do that
S0082	and i find out on wednesday when i be at rcia
S0084	mm
S0082	that in this period from lend until just after easter the um cafod have strike a deal with the government it's not um gift aid you know some like if you if you um donate to a charity
S0084	mm
S0082	if you're a taxpayer
S0084	mm
S0082	they ask you to sign a mandate
S0084	yeah
S0082	agree that they can claim the tax
S0084	yeah
S0082	which mean that for every pound you give them they can claim whatever tax you pay on it twenty percent twenty five percent whatever but so you know twenty five p in a pound thirty if maximum i should think in a pound but from the begin of lend until shortly after easter er cafod have strike a deal with the government that every pound that's donate to them in that period the government will match
S0084	wow that's really good
S0082	yeah so if you give them a pound the government give a pound
S0084	mm
S0082	if you give them ten pound the government give them ten pound up to a maximum of
S0086	yeah but how do we
S0082	five million
S0086	know they really do that
S0082	well they they've get to because cafod be you know
S0084	it's er
S0082	it's organize by the church
S0084	it's huge
S0082	and the church would hold the government to to ransom if they didn't
S0084	mm
S0086	ransom
S0082	it would be in every newspaper
S0084	yeah absolutely
S0082	and cameron will lose the next election
S0084	mm
S0086	mm
S0084	well i'll give my money to cafod then in that case say i buy three chocolate bar a week or five chocolate bar a week that's five pound time six what's that thirty pound
S0082	mm yeah it mount up
S0084	yeah

S0084	mm
S0082	publicize rather than forecast for age that they be open a pizza express in whitstable
S0084	in whitstable oh
S0082	and um they've never have one before but er they've whatever premise they're take over they've run into all sort of problems with drainage and all sort of you know get the equipment through and everything so um it should've open i think couple of weeks ago but it still still hasn't so they're drive into canterbury which isn't that far away
S0084	oh right
S0082	er to go to the pizza express there because it's it i mean er you hear what i say that i'm not a big fan of pizza but whenever i have a pizza even in some of the place where you'd think they'd be good like ask
S0084	yeah
S0082	and place like that they're still not up to scratch when it come to pizza express you still get a really good pizza
S0084	mm
S0082	from pizza express even though they're a chain i mean you know they start off by just have a i dunno half a dozen shop somewhere you know back in the nineteen seventies i think it be er it be quite a big thing to go to a pizza express you know they be all they be very much a big you know cut above everybody else
S0084	mm
S0082	er but of course as they get popular they get bigger and bigger but they still do serve very good pizza strangely enough
S0084	i don't well how long have they
S0082	yeah
S0084	be go then i think they be like an eighties or nineties thing like zizzis
S0082	no i'm sure
S0084	but they're longer
S0082	i'm sure it be the seventies cos i'm sure mummy and i go to it you know cos er pizzas become very popular you know these um you know like ask
S0084	yeah
S0082	they they weren't around at the time but the um restaurants which later sort of develop into place like ask i mean the famous one be er the sort of mcdonalds of pizza it be a place call pizzaland
S0084	oh right
S0082	and and they it be almost they you know they get the cheapest pizza they could find stick it on
S0084	mm
S0082	the heater and then give it to you and charge you three time the normal price
S0084	ah
S0082	um and but public seem to like it you know i mean they be always pack whenever i go you know if mum and i go out to go to the cinema or something we fancy have something er you know like a pizza
S0084	mm
S0082	either before or after they be always very crowd um
S0084	that's weird
S0082	but when er pizza in the park i think be one of the first ones that open that be in um be it hyde park um yeah hyde park
S0084	mm
S0082	um er and they have a jazz club there as well um that be the other
S0084	oh okay
S0082	that be the other point about that one
S0084	yeah
S0082	then a few more open up um yeah sort of notting hill and er you know um posher place
S0084	mm
S0082	um and then a few more and then i think that be probably late seventies well it'll be on my computer i expect but yeah late seventies something like that dunno
S0084	or i can look it up here on my clever phone
S0082	oh right
S0084	or well whatever you whatever you prefer
S0082	yeah actually i've just gotta check something
S0084	oh okay
S0082	yeah so er if you if you come by the odd eight hundred and seventy five thousand and you don't know what to do with
S0084	mm under my pillow
S0082	any time in the future
S0084	mm
S0082	then there's a nice house you can buy there and rent it out to me
S0084	mat rat
S0082	five pound a year
S0084	yeah well i'll have to see about that it do make you think doesn't it you know the lotto tonight be forty five million
S0082	yeah
S0084	and you just think oh that'd be quite nice just just a few just er two or three would be quite nice maybe maybe four or five no one need forty five
S0082	it would solve most of our problems wouldn't it
S0084	yeah it would be pretty nice
S0082	right er good let's just check see if my website's up and run okay that be i know it be but i always oh yeah that's right i always check the website mm i don't like get e mail from people say oh i can't find this on our website
S0084	urgh do you get a lot of that
S0082	not recently cos i've be up to date but some you know i always that's always the way you know you sort of leave it for a week to do something and you think oh well you know it's not that urgent and then somebody send you an e mail say you haven't put this on the website
S0084	mm
S0082	it be that really annoy me when that happen so
S0084	if i be you i would just do um a bullet point list of things that you
S0082	yeah i should
S0084	do every time and then you know
S0082	mm
S0084	that way you don't have to keep watch the video
S0082	yeah i should do
S0084	and it'll be in your own word
S0082	mm i should do really i've get it so i i know exactly i how i you know i haven't solve the i still haven't solve the problem yet
S0084	mm
S0082	so once i've solve the problem
S0084	yep then you can write it down
S0082	i'll do it mm
S0084	while it's in your mind
S0082	see the easy way would be um what i use to do i on the um er compaq er you know the pc that i have er
S0084	mm mm
S0082	which you know when you go in to the host er website which hold all the information you've get a web er um download on there so you can download it to your computer but you know i try it dozens of time and it just won't download onto the mac it it
S0084	oh
S0082	do it first time on er on the er um on the compaq and then when i have to have the hard disk replace er it do it first time on the new hard disk but
S0084	mm
S0082	it won't it won't download onto this
S0084	it's weird isn't it
S0082	so i have to go through this really long and that's why that's why i can't remember it cos there's so many stag to it that you know it's easy to make a even with the video it's easy to make a mistake
S0084	mm maybe it's one of those things that be just better on a pc annoyingly
S0082	yeah
S0084	just lend itself better you know whoever create it create it on a pc rather than mac
S0082	well i think so i mean it just er from some it just you know as there there's no reason why it shouldn't download this disk er but it won't it just won't do it
S0084	mm
S0082	right do we want to um
S0084	oh get lose on the go yeah definitely didn't even think about that
