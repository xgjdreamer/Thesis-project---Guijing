S0196	princess
S0192	so what the purpose of this you're just raise money but why ice bucket challenge
S0196	they're yeah you have to so it's to get it's to make sure that it's i think it's a way of erm promote the the charity so all celebrities have be do it like er every day there's a new celebrity online that do it everybody from
S0192	do it have any relation to the actual illness itself
S0196	no i i don't i don't believe it do
S0192	just random
S0196	i think it be you if you get nominate you have to do it and you
S0192	yeah
S0196	have to go online and and put towards the charity so it's i think it's just a way of get it out there and it have like everybody be do it all over like i be just i have them
S0192	be do it how long's it be on for
S0196	what how long it's be go
S0192	be it something yeah yeah be it something just in the last couple of weeks or have it be go for months
S0196	oh god no i i think it's be all over the net a lot for the last two or three weeks but i think it's be go on for a lot longer it's just be get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger erm and the reason why and and be nominate but the reason why they do it be because 's best mate have that disease
S0192	yeah okay
S0196	erm so
S0192	that make sense
S0196	yeah you if you're nominate you have to go you have to dominate and you have to do
S0192	there be another one for
S0196	er sorry not dominate sorry er donate
S0192	there be another one for breast cancer wasn't there where like people be not wear makeup or something and take a picture
S0196	yeah
S0192	of herself
S0196	yeah
S0192	not wear any makeup
S0196	yeah there's that one as well
S0192	mm
S0196	if i be online i do it but i'd do it but
S0192	my problem be i'm a little sceptical about charities so
S0196	okay
S0192	they make erm i mean if you i do a lot of research into that cancer one at the time because you know people be like we donate so much money and then you actually look at their spend about thirty percent of that about like a hundred two hundred million a year go back into their company back into advertise back into do this kinda stuff it's a lot of money that they take and
S0196	but they have to if they er
S0192	i don't know i've watch a lot of documentaries about
S0196	er yeah
S0192	company that be put research into avoid cancer
S0196	but they but but you have to advertise in order to get
S0192	yeah i know
S0196	it have to it have to er it go back into erm you know look into er you know the of of erm try to find a cure et cetera blah blah blah but at the same time you have to keep on promote and
S0192	mm
S0196	get awareness out there which cost money
S0192	but they're massive industries i mean like
S0192	charities for cancer earn like hundreds and hundreds of millions every year and it's not actually in their interest to actually find a cure for cancer cos then they'll stop get all that money
S0196	yeah i know
S0192	so
S0196	hang on one second
S0192	just just a little bite sceptical
S0196	just tell i'm busy and i'm pop out his bottom lip go and say don't go mummy
S0192	ah
S0196	you should stay with me cos i've get a high temperature talk about guilt i want to come and see but work all day tuesday and wednesday
S0192	just tell her say that i'll be up erm i'm gonna be back in er within the next month so i'll definitely see her
S0196	oh she say or we'll we'll happily come to the next few months and visit cos they
S0192	yeah
S0196	can have the day there
S0192	no of course yeah
S0196	yeah i'll text her back
S0192	either or
S0196	right i need a cup of tea what be you say about the charity the charity
S0192	tell her not to worry yes ah i'm just sceptical i've watch numerous documentaries about you know these massive company who've actually put a lot of money into stop the cure and to you know hide cure and just they want care that take a long time rather than a cure i mean they're make hundreds of millions of pound a year why would they wanna find a cure then they'd stop make that kind of money so
S0196	yeah of course they would
S0192	i'm just sceptical about charities
S0196	but i i mean yeah but you you always look into things
S0192	mm
S0196	and
S0192	i do quite lot of research into it
S0196	er educate and yeah and that and i think that's great you should be educate on what you're put your money towards
S0192	yeah definitely
S0196	erm but at the same time i think sometimes because there be these let me just er i don't know how heavy this be mean to be
S0192	i i don't make tea or coffee or
S0192	no idea
S0196	erm i think
S0192	i'll turn it on i know how to do that
S0196	you do
S0192	yeah
S0196	wicked
S0192	not that it's the wrong button woah
S0196	woah
S0192	that nearly blow my head off
S0196	but i think sometimes there's these you know there's these charities whereby you know they're not legit and they're not do what they
S0196	er say they do and then it make all the the dodgy charities
S0192	yeah
S0196	i think the ones best know of course be go to be there's go to be more money in promotion and advertise
S0192	mm
S0196	but at the same time because they be so big you're more likely that your money's actually go into the correct place
S0192	yeah i mean to a certain degree but if you think what er
S0196	yeah to a of course to a certain degree because not all charities have the luxury of cancer
S0192	but let's talk about breast cancer research
S0196	yeah
S0192	yeah as an example let's say they earn a lot more than this but let's say they earn a hundred million a year and thirty million of that go back into their own company for advertise why do a company like breast cancer research need to advertise we all know about it it's all very very popular
S0196	yeah no that's no when i be say that i think the same yes er
S0192	they don't need to spend thirty million pound on that's a lot of money it's one third
S0196	but then we're not in that business we don't know do we
S0192	if i give a quid i'm give them thirty three pence of it just so they can do what they want basically
S0196	mm but i guess i mean my only my only reason behind that would be because they be such a big company and they do have so much advertise that
S0192	mm
S0196	the money then do need to go back to keep that advertise go
S0192	yeah
S0196	but at the same time i get what you're say because do that advertise campaign need to carry on to that level
S0192	yeah
S0196	when the awareness be already out there
S0192	we know about
S0196	but exactly but
S0192	yeah
S0196	they need to i guess they need to keep go and if there's any charity that i would say put money back into advertise it that would be the
S0192	yeah
S0196	that would be one big one for me
S0192	my my argument while it be happen be that you know everyone's do this no makeup selfie thing whatever that be raise attention to a certain degree er
S0196	yeah
S0192	okay because you know wow
S0196	yeah
S0192	but it be kind of to me at the same time kind of sad that it's such a big thing for a woman not to wear makeup
S0196	do people donate do people donate
S0192	that it need to be for charity well of course women cannot wear makeup you don't need to just do it for charity
S0196	no no but do erm do people donate when they do the makeup
S0192	yeah load of people donate yeah people be donate to do this
S0196	oh so it be both right right okay
S0192	but i be just think that you know we don't need to be spend this kinda money on advertise for the charities very shallow advertise as well hey it's you know breast cancer charity don't forget about us when actually i felt like all of that time spend talk about it could've actually be spend on tell people how to live a healthier lifestyle that avoid get cancer in the first place tell them how to eat healthier
S0196	mm
S0192	tell them to exercise more to do these kinda things rather than just say hey you know look at me i've get no makeup but i still look really pretty and i want
S0196	mm
S0192	everyone to tell me i look great
S0192	but not really talk about how to avoid cancer it's just say don't think about cancer but
S0196	some people would some people wouldn't be do it some people wouldn't be do it for the right reason
S0192	no of course
S0196	and they'll be do it for from a maybe a selfish point of view
S0192	it just seem kinda shallow to me the whole thing
S0196	but a mm yeah but a lot of the time i think sometimes unfortunately not the advertise campaign that sit there and be like right this be how you're mean to live your life in order to you know erm to er prevent this from happen
S0192	mm
S0196	isn't actually go to bring the best awareness to the charity
S0192	no no of course
S0196	unfortunately sometimes things like that do bring the awareness there and then people look into it and
S0192	afterwards
S0196	and exactly so it's not always
S0192	i just get a bite annoy on facebook like 's daughter
S0196	mm
S0192	i mean she's a bite of a she doesn't live the healthiest lifestyle she's quite big quite
S0196	's the er with the two with the three
S0192	she's get three children yeah i know and she's all go look at me with my no makeup
S0196	she do it
S0192	and everyone's go oh you're so gorgeous you look so lovely blah blah
S0196	oh really
S0192	how brave you be for take off your makeup and i'm think and then like
S0196	no see i wouldn't even do it cos i er
S0192	and she's like i donate this money to charity i'm like hang on a minute you eat like you drink like three litres of coke every day and eat chocolate come out your ass and like you fee your kid this shit
S0196	your ass
S0192	every day you fee your kid the worst stuff but now you feel really good because you take your makeup off and pay twenty pound to cancer research you're cost them more you're gonna be somebody that's gonna be cost this this research in the in the future i just find it really kinda hypocritical
S0196	but isn't there er can't you isn't with every situation
S0192	i can't voice that though i can't say that to people
S0196	mm with every situation isn't there a hypocritical part to it cos er
S0192	no of course and i'm i'll be that one
S0196	mm
S0192	i'm sure
S0192	i just don't trust charities i really don't
S0196	you know what i think like i say i think it's
S0192	it's a business
S0196	it's in in this in this world now there be there be always company and situations that be con you
S0192	yeah
S0196	and unfortunately the good ones
S0196	get the brunt of that and that's where your opinion come from because
S0192	yeah
S0196	you be you be sceptical and you and you like to i've get a friend at work who's very much like you she she question everything she look into everything she educate herself on everything
S0192	yeah
S0196	and i love that and i'm lazy i don't always do that erm and and i love that about her and sometimes i'm like tell me what's go on with this and she'll explain it to me over lunch and whatnot
S0192	yeah
S0196	and i i love it i love listen erm and i should really be more like that but at the same time
S0192	probably doesn't make her a happy person or easy to be around
S0196	it sometimes but it sometimes be the er but it sometimes be you try to defrost it really quickly
S0192	no that'll defrost really quickly mm it's warm water
S0196	oh right
S0196	erm i think something like this bring on salmonella
S0192	erm why
S0196	i don't know i just hear that it's not a good thing to do to put it in hot hot water cos i use to do it and i be tell you shouldn't do that because it defrost it too quickly and it's not healthy to do
S0192	defrost it too quickly
S0196	yeah well bring bring er obviously it help it along
S0192	how do you defrost it just put it in the fridge
S0196	i just leave it out
S0192	yeah i do if i can be bother
S0196	cupboard
S0192	mm
S0196	or in the fridge
S0192	what i know about bacteria be they require
S0196	how do we know when this be do
S0192	erm it start to whistle or something
S0196	it do okay
S0192	maybe you have to put that down there we go then it'll start to whistle
S0192	do you have a cup and a teabag or
S0196	i don't have a cup no i be hop that you would have a cup
S0192	i think
S0196	do i have a cup
S0192	you didn't bring one
S0196	no i don't have a cup unfortunately
S0192	no one here
S0196	perfect we'll have er
S0192	someone's birthday
S0196	one of those
S0192	all i know about bacteria be that they need time and the right temperature this be probably the right temperature for bacteria to grow now
S0196	mm
S0192	so if i leave it in there for a while and then there'd be enough time for it to i i don't think it's i don't think it's a problem
S0192	if i do it really quickly and then
S0192	i'm quite safe with food so i don't think it's a problem i wouldn't normally do it but i've get nothing for lunch
S0196	doesn't smell of anything
S0192	that's the only thing i've get for lunch
S0196	doesn't smell of anything at all
S0192	it's just salt
S0196	yeah
S0192	you don't need to add salt to your tea
S0196	i just think no no i be just think i didn't i didn't know if it'd have a a scent to it
S0192	no 's into his organic whatever
S0196	i know he drink green tea

S0192	there you go i think it's do right now just turn it off
S0196	erm what's the difference

S0196	oh god you don't do you what be the hot drink that you use to be it hot chocolate or hot blackcurrant

S0192	yeah
S0196	i've have a
S0192	if i'm sick sometimes i'll have like honey and lemon and ginger but it's only if i'm sick it's just butter
S0196	yeah i know just look
S0192	yeah i wouldn't normally defrost like this but i erm i haven't get anything for lunch and i haven't get time to go out and get anything so i need
S0196	oh okay
S0192	i need something
S0196	i could've bring something round
S0192	no it's all good oh don't worry about yesterday you send me a message something about not give me a lift or something
S0196	yeah i know i felt so bad
S0192	ah don't be silly i have to i have to cycle there anyway i'm cycle back so
S0196	i know well i think that that's why i say well it wouldn't have make any sense anyway but we could've put the bike in the back
S0192	ah no worry we
S0196	but i didn't even offer
S0192	i didn't even think about it so it wasn't a problem
S0196	right you need more milk
S0192	i need more milk
S0196	at point today yeah
S0192	erm
S0196	have you get your cereal still
S0192	neither of us drink milk so
S0196	you don't have cereal anymore
S0192	no god no
S0196	you use to love your cereal when you be young do you remember
S0192	yeah i know that's why i be so unhealthy
S0192	really
S0196	that's why you be so unhealthy what do you have for that what do you have
S0192	i mean my parent allow me to eat two bowl of sugar every day for my breakfast and things
S0196	oh you're fine what do erm
S0192	well you say i'm fine but i've already have about fifteen fill so i don't
S0196	well so have so have i i don't think the cereal just do that i think it be probably all the other stuff maybe as well
S0192	mm
S0196	during uni
S0192	i don't think i mean at uni i eat fine
S0196	no maybe a little bite maybe the crisp and the chocolate brownie sweets and the alcohol
S0192	i mean alcohol's not good for my teeth
S0196	no you no
S0192	definitely but erm apparently the strength of your adult teeth be determine by your diet as a child
S0196	well that make sense
S0192	because your teeth grow while you're a child so
S0196	well yeah that make sense doesn't it
S0192	how if you be nutrient deficient when you be a child then you'll have weak teeth when you're older it bother me because i can eat exactly the same things as for literally the last eight or nine years
S0196	mm
S0192	and then i come home and need five fill and she's fine and we're not eat anything different
S0196	what you what you what be you gonna do what be you gonna do what be you gonna do
S0192	exactly the same thing time machine that's what we gotta build
S0192	go back stop eat
S0196	time machine
S0192	gotta stop eat weetos
S0196	back back to the back to the future
S0192	do you want any biscuits with this
S0196	where be we sit no no no no
S0192	good i don't know where they be
S0192	there's a apple
S0196	no
S0192	it's quite old
S0196	no but no no no no
S0192	there's a lemon oh that's really old
S0196	how be erm now
S0192	god know i have idea she doesn't really talk to me or the family
S0196	yeah
S0192	so i have no idea
S0196	well it wasn't erm yeah i know she give your mum a little bite of gyp erm
S0192	yeah i be tempt to drop her an email the other day actually
S0196	well i don't know recently have it calm down recently
S0192	i be tempt to drop an email and
S0196	yeah
S0192	say to her obviously we're not that close
S0196	yeah
S0192	but erm i dunno she doesn't her children don't treat she doesn't allow them to call my mother their grandmother which to a certain degree i understand because you know i'd find it a bite weird if i have kid and they be call their grandfather but you know he would be their grandfather and my mum kinda be their grandmother and i'm i be just tempt just to drop her an email and say look it's possible that and i aren't even gonna give her grandchildren and she kind of treat yours like grandchildren and she i think mum's quite sad that they don't treat her like a grandmother or call her grandmother
S0196	they don't treat her like one or they just don't call her like one
S0192	don't treat her like one or call her one
S0196	they don't call her one
S0192	doesn't will not call her one and she's not their grandmother so 's obviously their grandfather but she's not their grandmother which when you think about it that'd be like us grow up and grandad isn't our grandfather because he's not
S0196	yeah
S0192	blood he's marry in
S0196	it er it it that be a very similar situation at the same time we know gramps from when we be bear
S0192	mm oh they've know mum since when they be bear they're only five years old
S0196	no no i mean er erm oh sorry yeah you're right no
S0192	it's no different
S0196	yeah yeah yeah no no no no yeah you're absolutely right yeah
S0196	erm
S0192	they'll've know mum since they be bear obviously 's know her parent not to be together but
S0196	do you think er er when er do you think your mum and my mum's erm situation be slightly different because they didn't really have a relationship with their own dads they they know that gramps would probably only be our the grandad that we would have
S0192	i mean yeah maybe but who else i mean i don't know 's other side so yeah i guess maybe she's like they have another grandmother so they don't need to worry about it so
S0196	i think i mean i think it's a sad situation when it just when you're when you've get so much love in the family and people just wanna love those children and be there for those children
S0192	mm
S0196	and things like this be be er be be be question and er and almost you know argue over do it really matter let the child call them
S0192	yeah
S0196	grandma grandad nan nanny
S0192	definitely
S0196	you know let them just do what they wanna do or or at the same er the and i i mean this to the parent do it really matter your child be be look after they're love and that person want to be
S0192	yeah
S0196	that that that status in their life and they're play that role so why not let them
S0192	yeah
S0196	do it really matter
S0192	so i don't know whether i should
S0196	you know
S0192	say something to
S0196	because mm
S0192	just say
S0196	i don't know i don't know how close you be to her and it might just
S0192	not particularly close
S0196	will it not be will it not be i'm just take myself out of the situation i completely i'll come back to why i completely understand what where your point of view be cos you wanna protect your mum you you don't want her upset and you see this from that sort of situation
S0192	well
S0196	however from 's situation because you're not that close you don't know what mindset she's in and how she's felt over the last how many years
S0192	no of course
S0196	i have no idea you know more than me
S0192	mm
S0196	so i'm just think be that the right step to
S0192	but i think maybe as maybe as somebody external to er to it it's easier for me to see it more black and white
S0196	but you're not external you're not external
S0192	i mean i'm pretty damn external i don't see the girl
S0196	but you're not i'm i'm external
S0192	i mean er erm yeah okay
S0196	really
S0192	but i mean that's only
S0196	and you could even class me as not external
S0192	mm
S0196	as er sorry as as you know what i mean so it's er you're as much as you think you be because you don't live in the country you're do your own thing there's you know you don't have contact like you know we all do here with each other
S0192	mm
S0196	you be
S0192	yeah
S0196	because you're your mother's son
S0192	i guess i i want to put it tactfully and just kinda say like obviously i understand her opinions on the well and i don't her opinions on the matter
S0196	and she's upset about it
S0192	mum
S0196	mm
S0192	er i think maybe she hasn't vocalise it but i think probably deep down a little bite
S0196	yeah you know your mum
S0192	maybe yeah so i just say you know just i notice that my mum be have casually mention that she be kind of upset that she wasn't consider to be a grandmother erm you know it's possible just hasn't really consider it
S0196	she use those word
S0192	my mum say that
S0196	that have say we don't consider you as
S0192	i don't know i really don't know the intricacies
S0196	oh right oh sorry
S0192	no i have no idea what's i couldn't paraphrase anyone i don't know i don't know all i know be mum be a bite upset and i just felt well that wasn't really on
S0196	but but have
S0192	she be like a grandmother to them
S0196	but have clearly have say that she's be tell they're not gonna call you that
S0192	i'm pretty sure well maybe not she's be tell but action speak louder than word maybe the children aren't just aren't do it they're call grandad but her i guess or something else
S0196	i can i completely understand why it's upset for
S0192	mm i think she just feel like she's put in a lot of effort with the family and just want to be accept by them i guess and just hasn't that would be a nice thing to do to make them feel accept
S0196	there's always be an issue with though hasn't there
S0192	mm yeah there have
S0196	but it only really it only it only really begin when be bear right when they fell pregnant at the same time
S0192	yeah yeah really
S0196	it's like grow up you're a mother of three now come on
S0192	mm she's a pretty young mother of three though and she be pretty young when she have her first one
S0196	well yeah but shouldn't it grow should if you're if you're old enough to if you're old enough to have sex to conceive a child
S0192	mm
S0196	and to choose to be a parent you're old enough to make adult decisions and and and it's immature
S0192	you
S0196	it's be immature
S0192	one would hope so but people have children with no train whatsoever so
S0196	yeah i know but don't get me start on that i know friends who can't have kid
S0196	and there's people out there who pop them leave right and centre
S0192	yeah
S0196	and the and the and social service struggle to pull the kid away it's disgust
S0192	the wrong people be have children
S0196	i know
S0196	and then you've get people out there who would be absolutely fantastic parent like the people that we have around saturday night
S0192	yeah
S0196	can't conceive go through two ivfs
S0192	what about adoption
S0196	erm i think it get to the point where they have go through might might've be third ivfs i'm not three ivfs
S0192	yeah
S0196	i'm not sure but they have go through it so much and it take so much out of the woman
S0192	yeah
S0196	and emotionally out of both of them as well that by the time they'd go through that they be erm mm late er a couple of years ago and he's late thirties now she's mid forties
S0192	mm
S0196	so i think it's just do you know what let's just relax for a second let's chill erm and they get use to actually just be themselves and then it be actually if we bring a child in and go through the adoption process which could take up to three years then or more
S0192	mm
S0196	and they might not any get anything like with just they might not get anything out of it they might get really excite and think they've get somewhere and not
S0192	and then not get anywhere
S0196	they could be even older parent and then how would would they have the energy and
S0192	mm
S0196	you know so they they become very comfortable with just actually go do you know what i think we're okay with just ourselves
S0192	it's a fine line of
S0196	but they would be fantastic parent
S0192	it's a yeah it's a shame it's a there's a fine line of when to have children isn't there
S0196	do you be you not gonna have children then
S0192	er i don't know i really don't know not at the minute erm
S0196	well no not at the minute
S0192	i feel like you need to be have you need to have enough experience and have enough of a financial support before you have children
S0196	well and plus you're move around so you need to have a
S0192	i mean for me it's different i'm do other stuff as well
S0196	right
S0192	so i'm that add another massive equation and i still wanna travel for another five to ten years be the problem
S0196	but do you see them in your future do you see them in your future though
S0192	erm and i both love to experience erm and therefore have a child would be one of the biggest experience we could possibly have so obviously that's a massive draw erm however there's some negative we probably wouldn't be ready to have children until late thirties i wouldn't think we wouldn't be qualify enough
S0196	that's alright
S0192	educate enough settle down enough to have children but 's mum hit the menopause at forty one and her mum's sister at like forty or something so they hit it
S0196	yeah my my hit er my my er my mum do er late thirties
S0192	you know really early so that's a that's a concern really yeah
S0196	and it's hereditary it's hereditary apparently
S0192	so that's a
S0196	er or it could be
S0192	that's a concern for us and we're not gonna be ready until we're late thirties so then we've think well maybe if we be ready we'll adopt or something we've consider that and we kind of you know discuss probably the best age to adopt a child would be just before they go to university so
S0192	we could just pay for university and then er when you get old they'll look after you
S0196	you crack me up shut up
S0196	you er good luck find
S0196	an eighteen year old to adopt
S0192	to be adopt
S0196	i tell you what i'll have a kid
S0192	yeah
S0196	and then i'll pass them over to you at eighteen
S0192	i'll adopt it and then they can look after you
S0196	here's your adoption
S0192	yeah definitely
S0196	we've always you know that i've always want to adopt don't you
S0192	yeah i
S0196	always
S0192	i think so yeah
S0196	mm
S0192	think so
S0196	funnily enough it come up saturday night and er you know cos they say oh you know when do you think you'll start try and i just say you know i'm very hesitant i'm very content and very happy and i'm
S0192	mm
S0196	not ready for anybody else to come into that right now
S0192	no no definitely not
S0196	and er whether or not that feel will the erm whether or not that feel will erm start it it be be be stronger or whether it will erm lessen i'm not sure
S0192	no
S0196	but right now i'm i'm just so up and down about it i don't know what i want
S0192	mm
S0196	i don't know what i want it's funny because when i when when you when you view your when you when you view yourself at forty fifty or sixty or whatever and you just you you know you're daydream or you're in the shower or whatever and you just you picture yourself and you have a vision of you and or you know and i
S0192	mm
S0196	you know i think of us you know walk down or
S0192	mm
S0196	something like that and you know our our grow up children be behind us with their grandchildren you know that's what i see but it's funny because i don't feel like i wanna do it now
S0192	no
S0196	and it's it's not change it's actually it's become a stronger feel which be scary because
S0192	of not want to have children
S0196	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0196	mm
S0192	i feel it pretty strong though
S0196	do you
S0192	yeah there's a big part of me that think if er if we never have children
S0196	you'd be okay with that
S0192	life wouldn't never be that hard there'd always it you i could work a part time job for the rest of my life and be fine and it's
S0196	mm
S0192	have children be what tie you to place be what make life difficult be what make everything a struggle and make er this kind of stuff it add stress
S0196	i guess it yeah well i well i don't know what even if it make everything a struggle
S0192	i mean financially
S0196	it guess i guess it depend
S0192	i can't even keep a plant alive i don't know how i'd keep a child alive
S0196	i guess it depend on what you find a struggle and what each person find a struggle
S0192	i have a one of the biggest problems for me be this idea that at the age of four i have to give my child up to the government and then they decide how my child be educate and how my child be bring up and what my child do with its days until the age of eighteen and then my child's probably too angry to really talk to me until it's like twentysomething just seriously i mean get to the age of four oh i've get my child now i have to give it to the public school system which i don't think be a good education system at all and then they decide what my child learn and they decide and there's systems outside of that but you can't afford to privately teach your children
S0196	so why be you go into the education system then if you feel strongly about it
S0192	i feel strongly about every system
S0196	why be you
S0192	so i mean i couldn't not oh i would change the education system through and through if i could but i actually avoid a considerable amount of the rigmarole and bureaucratic bullcrap yeah course you can
S0196	can i close this window it's alright i've get it
S0192	erm by be a language teacher i avoid the majority of it
S0196	you do
S0192	and anyway i don't wanna be in public school i wanna be teach at universities which be different
S0192	erm but yeah all these kinda things you have to put your children through and like i don't wanna live in england particularly so
S0196	yeah but you're not gonna live in er england be you unless
S0192	where be i gonna be when i have a child
S0196	unless something dramatically change or you you feel that something's change within you guy
S0192	mm
S0196	that you want to that's never be an option for you
S0192	i mean how old be you now thirty one
S0196	yes thank you
S0192	yeah that's okay i'm get on for thirty now
S0192	twenty eight
S0196	i know you're twenty eight
S0192	so i'm start to think like okay well let's say i do want children how far do i have to get well how long's it gonna take me to get settle in a country where i can have a child cos i'm not the type i wouldn't i know it's not good for the child to move them about all the time i've meet children like that they be intelligent and highly culture but they don't fit in with the people that be around them so
S0196	yeah they're loners almost yeah
S0192	yeah they yeah it's a great child really
S0196	mm
S0192	and i'm sure they'll be successful and whatever but they don't fit in with the people that
S0196	yeah
S0192	be around them so i don't wanna do that to my child so i need to find a country where i'm can be settle
S0196	yeah
S0192	i need to have get qualify enough and get a good enough job
S0196	it's not fair on the child either they're very er yeah
S0196	they're very emotionally unstable children i think
S0192	yeah
S0196	that travel around all over the place and yes there be huge benefit absolutely huge but you find a lot of the time when you meet them they're er their emotion er they're just
S0192	no i agree i've meet someone
S0196	yeah
S0192	before i meet a girl before that travel around a lot she be a compulsive liar completely
S0196	yeah cos she's try to fit in probably
S0192	yeah i don't don't blame her
S0196	and
S0192	and she's she nobody really know her background so she can make it up so
S0196	yeah i mean well you er you wouldn't even know whether you're come or go that's horrible
S0192	no so and i know that we wouldn't wanna do that to a child
S0196	right
S0192	we wanna be settle so
S0196	right
S0192	now when i start think about the timescale need to do a master's need to do a phd need to get a good enough job so it's pay for
S0196	so funny this be what i be do at eighteen do my we and and i be do
S0192	yeah
S0196	milestones
S0192	yeah
S0196	mm
S0192	and you just start add that up and go hang on a minute i'm not gonna be thirty five to forty before i'm ready to have a kid
S0196	i know i'm just like holy mother i know i know
S0192	so maybe we'll have them in our late thirties maybe we i mean there's no problem if we never have children that's not a problem
S0196	well at least you be both on the same page
S0192	mm
S0196	you know and sometimes couple you know change
S0192	be you and
S0196	yeah we be he's i think that it would it would erm i think in a way it would devastate him if i say do you know what actually i've change my mind and i don't want children
S0192	you definitely don't want children you mean
S0196	yeah i think it would i don't think it wouldn't break us i think we'd stay together but i think it would it would it would break part of his heart you know
S0192	mm
S0196	he would struggle with that for a little while erm but he's very much a person where he'd never force someone to do what they don't wanna do and he we're fully commit to one another
S0192	would your choice be easier if you know that it wouldn't break his heart
S0196	no my choice would just be my choice
S0192	you're still battle with whether you do or whether you don't
S0196	my my choice be my choice and i the thing be be that at the end of the day i'm not one person that's in a relationship there's two people in this relationship
S0192	mm
S0196	and we've choose to erm commit to one another marry and spend the rest of our live with one another er
S0192	but you have the ultimate say you're the person that carry the child and deliver the child
S0196	er well yeah
S0192	the man really doesn't get much of a choice
S0196	well absolutely but it it affect you know yes you know i carry the child i deliver the child and he'll be off work and i'll be here during the day and all that sort of stuff but there's it affect the man a lot more er sorry erm equally as much as it do the woman but just in different ways
S0192	oh no definitely
S0196	but the emphasis be more on the woman
S0192	i think it
S0196	because of you know they
S0192	it definitely affect us just as much but i'm what i'm say be that you get the choice
S0196	er absolutely
S0192	if you wanna have a child then you'll have a child if you don't wanna have a child then you won't have a child yeah
S0196	yeah cos no one can force me to yeah exactly yeah
S0192	so it doesn't really matter what we think it's
S0196	no i er well it er i mean for me i i think
S0192	we've gotta do our best to persuade you it should do but er
S0196	i think it no but here's the thing
S0192	it doesn't
S0196	i think i here's the thing i think it depend on the person that you're with
S0192	mm
S0196	so completely appreciate and respect your opinion and so do and so do i with 's
S0192	mm
S0196	so she would never do anything whereby you're not on the same page for something that strong you know something
S0192	mm
S0196	that serious that big er same with and i not every couple's like that
S0192	no no of course
S0196	you know we're just lucky to be in that to be in that situation where you've grow up together and you've you know cos and and you have be together for the same amount of time the same age that and i have i be eighteen twenty one you meet
S0192	mm
S0196	when you be at uni
S0192	mm
S0196	eighteen like nineteen eighteen nineteen
S0192	yeah
S0196	and it's hard to grow together and you go through all up and down but at the same time like you learn to just be a complete unit
S0192	mm
S0196	and what and and what you and have go through as a couple how you've live your live how you've you know er live outside the box sometimes how you you know live in the you know what i mean like what
S0192	live in a box
S0196	yeah live in a box
S0196	of what you've do together it's cement it it it i mean i don't know you as well as i would like to as a couple but i can only imagine that it's cement you as a couple more
S0192	mm
S0196	you know
S0192	well it have to doesn't it otherwise you're
S0196	yeah
S0192	you'll you'll've be tear apart
S0196	yeah
S0192	i think you and would make excellent parent erm
S0196	oh i think do you know what i think it would
S0196	i'm mm i i'm not be bias here but i i think you'd make such a good dad
S0192	no i'd no
S0196	oh you'd be such a good parent
S0192	oh on that note
S0196	you really would where be you go
S0192	get a glass of water
S0196	you would though
S0192	i don't really
S0196	oh you would
S0192	i know you would make an excellent mother but
S0196	thank you
S0192	i don't know if we would
S0196	you would
S0192	i don't know i'm not very good at hide things that i resent i think if i resent my child can you imagine how that would be
S0196	there isn't but er yeah but you never resent your child and you'd absolutely adore
S0192	people say that but that's a fear
S0196	you
S0192	what if you turn around like i have a child and then it's four and i'm like man i really need to travel like really need to just change my life and i can't because of that child that i then learn to resent cos i just like end up hat them for like ten years
S0196	i know but the thing be be that by the time they're four yeah but by the time they're four i understand what you're say
S0196	i do it's like shit look at you
S0192	yeah
S0196	i could've be off somewhere else and now i'm here with er with you
S0192	yeah i know i could've be do something
S0196	erm but the thing be that because er by the time they're four you will've have four years to completely bond with that child and you would love them inside and out and do anything for them and you've make that choice to set it er and you would never make that choice if you weren't a hundred percent happy with it
S0192	just need another ten years i think i think you too i think we just need another ten years if you could have your thirties
S0196	i don't need ten years
S0192	to yourself
S0196	you need ten years
S0192	do you not need ten years
S0196	no no no
S0192	no
S0196	i don't need ten years
S0192	what about if you be as youthful when you turn forty as you be when you be thirty
S0196	i'm still gonna be forty
S0192	yeah
S0192	but let's say you live to a hundred rather than eighty or something so you
S0196	oh 's on her way
S0192	oh she's on her way be she
S0196	yeah
S0192	good stuff
S0196	erm
S0192	be she alone be she with company
S0196	she's come alone
S0192	cool
S0196	yeah oh say er erm sorry he can't come round duh duh duh duh like you know
S0192	oh don't be silly
S0196	hope you're okay
S0192	i'll see him when i see him
S0196	yeah erm anyway back to the original conversation
S0196	erm be you go to be you gonna sleep on it and see how you feel about the situation or be pretty much sure on
S0192	oh no i'm sure i won't message her it be just a a pass think
S0196	a yeah yeah
S0192	i just wonder if i should i be gonna talk to about it and see what he think just er maybe if i dunno i guess i should at least see her first before i er try and send an invasive message
S0196	it might it it might be
S0192	mm
S0196	yeah that might be a good
S0192	i just don't think i'm ever gonna see her i just think it be not on really not call her
S0196	it's not
S0192	grandmother something very simple i guess but
S0196	it's not but do you know what i think you're do the right thing by probably not
S0192	yeah well i'll take your advice
S0196	not send anything i think
S0192	not do anything
S0196	i think you you say you be a parent and you know you never see you never speak to her
S0192	and she come in and give you some advice about how to run your children
S0196	but you get but you get an email and say i don't really think it's appropriate you tell my father not to call your gran not to call him grandad how would you feel about read that
S0192	i mean i be gonna be i be try to be nice about it and say to her
S0196	of course you'd be nice about it
S0192	obviously i understand all of the complications that you have with my family
S0196	yeah
S0192	and your family but
S0196	but it's upset my mum
S0192	if it if it's not difficult for you if it's not too hard be there any way that they could at least maybe not immediately but over the years learn to you know treat my mother like a grandmother i wouldn't say like do it now start call her this but like just so she think about it and just like have a you know think that er it do hurt my mum and if it's if it's not hard for you to do if it's at the point now where you can start do it you didn't on principle but now it's not really a problem do you know what i mean then she it might be not really a problem for her she just doesn't think about it cos it's something that she's always do
S0196	do you know what i think i think that i think that if you're go to do it i don't think email would be probably the best way to do it
S0192	should i ring up her father and get his er bless first and then then give her a call
S0196	no i think that any time you see her
S0192	which be never when be i gonna see her i'm not gonna see her
S0196	if it's er well this be the thing but if you ever do i think the way you the way you talk to people and the way you come across it's quite it's the way how you just say it then
S0192	mm
S0196	it's quite calm and i think that the right set er text phone it's not always
S0192	there's no context be there so
S0196	no and people read it in different ways
S0192	yeah
S0196	so i think if you be gonna do that you'd have to find a way to see her and get her in an environment of where can i can i just have a chat for a second
S0192	yeah
S0196	there's something on my mind i just wanna air something off with you
S0192	mum and never see her though so i don't know when i'm gonna see her
S0196	they don't see her what about the kid
S0192	cos she's get er well they they go there but they can't get her here because she have too many children now
S0196	yeah
S0192	so they don't have a big enough car to like actually travel anywhere so
S0196	i mean that's fair enough well i mean that's fair enough where do they live
S0192	i mean yeah i mean i'm just explain why
S0196	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	i'm never gonna see the girl you know what i mean i saw her for her wed i think that be the last time i saw her
S0196	you be there for the wed

S0192	but i mean i be four when they get marry
S0192	it's quite a while it's really take things slowly
S0196	it's i mean it's not that easy to get a divorce sometimes financially

S0196	yeah cos i be think about marry
S0192	i mean erm
S0196	er look into a prenup but
S0192	yeah
S0196	i think well there's no point in that
S0192	no i be genuinely you know i've start think about mum and dad as well and like ground for divorce and i understand now why i think mum be try to convince the family that my dad be an alcoholic and i'm pretty sure that she use that as a reason for divorce cos she have no ground for divorce on all of the ground for divorce on the website the only one that she could've file for be him be an alcoholic and i remember at the time my dad cry and tell me she's lie she's tell the family i'm an alcoholic and i didn't understand it at the time
S0196	yeah
S0192	and it's only click with me now and erm since then my dad hasn't really touch alcohol i guess as to prove a point that he wasn't and he never be in the first place
S0196	yeah
S0192	i'm pretty sure my mum use that as a ground for divorce i can't be certain and i won't ask her about it but i'm pretty sure of it she didn't have any of the ground for divorce that be on on that list
S0196	mm
S0192	on the government website
S0196	mm
S0192	one of them be if you're live with an alcoholic that's ridiculous you know i don't suppose you hear about it but i just remember my dad
S0196	i
S0192	in tear say
S0196	no
S0192	that she's tell the family i'm an alcoholic
S0196	i remember i remember something that be bring up with with alcohol but it be it be very whatever i hear which be snippets
S0192	mm
S0196	it be very much erm i felt like it be emphasise more at the end of their relationship as oppose to something that happen throughout
S0192	mm
S0196	that it be something that become more
S0192	when my dad go crazy
S0196	evident well i don't know er
S0192	when he get drink
S0196	yes yes sorry yeah that it be yeah
S0192	yeah i be there
S0196	and i know you be there and that's that's terrible but
S0192	it be a function it be a function so i never think my dad be an alcoholic i never saw him drink really but yes we go to a party and he do get drink and this night be
S0196	mm
S0192	quite scary because
S0196	yeah
S0192	something from his youth come up i think he have a bite of an episode to tell you honestly
S0196	do you
S0192	because he didn't know who we be
S0196	really
S0192	he wasn't call us by name
S0196	that's kinda scary
S0192	he be pretty drink yeah it be scary he wasn't call us by name my mum and him have be argue she's be say he's be flirt with some other people or
S0196	yeah
S0192	something and my dad's a bite flirtatious but
S0196	yeah
S0192	i don't think he'd ever do anything
S0196	yeah
S0192	he then i hear a scream
S0196	yeah
S0192	and my mum run out say he's be strangle me he's be strangle me i'm like okay my dad get kinda angry and like she's say i have
S0196	you be fourteen fifteen
S0192	yeah i have to get my brother and my mum out the house and she's say call gran your grandad or something and he my dad like tear off his shirt and like flex his muscle he's like whyever your grandad but he be out of it
S0196	mm
S0192	he he i never saw him lay a a hand on anyone
S0196	mm
S0192	and if he do strangle my mother i've think this in hindsight she bruise so easily and she didn't have a single mark nothing there wasn't anything to prove that he'd strangle her and if my dad do actually
S0196	what so you don't believe her
S0192	i'm not sure i'm not sure because now 's tell me that mum say the other day that when we have an argument i push her up against a wall and say something to her and that never happen my mum have also tell me that she pay for my first year's tuition at uni didn't happen my mum have say some things to me that be just wrong just she's her memory be different to mine in certain aspects so i i don't know and then i see a poem up on their wall in their bedroom now which basically as far as i can tell she's love for ever and they meet up with each other years before they actually get together accord to this poem which be
S0196	mm
S0192	pretty blatantly obvious even though
S0196	mm
S0192	and er they've get like a anniversary for thirty seven years or something pin on their calendar so i'm pretty sure she'd be want to get back with for quite a while
S0196	but they they they be meet when they they when they meet when it be they be sixteen though they be very young weren't they
S0192	yeah yeah yeah but she's get a poem say
S0196	exactly
S0192	they drift apart for twenty years and then they meet again together and they really like each other but the time wasn't right or something it's on this poem so they leave it a few more years and blah blah blah so blatantly she'd be see for years before this have be happen so i don't know if something like this come up and that be a good reason
S0196	mm
S0192	you know he strangle me it's terrible like whatever i don't know maybe my dad do just quickly grab her and she get away i don't know
S0196	yeah
S0192	but i know if he'd've strangle her she i she bruise when i flick her
S0196	yeah
S0192	she she bruise really easily i know that for a fact but whatever happen it wasn't pleasant that be a terrible even and my dad should not have do that
S0196	no well i think that sometimes
S0192	but he wasn't an alcoholic
S0196	sometimes when you when you look back and you you remember things it's it's not always as it seem
S0192	no no of course
S0196	and you know people you will remember things that your mum won't and your dad won't
S0192	yeah
S0196	because it's from your eye and your perspective and your
S0192	no of course and er perception
S0196	and the only exactly and
S0192	memory's really really hard to trust
S0196	and you be the only er
S0192	that's why i'm not say black and white
S0196	right
S0192	i'm say yeah i'm not sure
S0196	and you be the only one they be the only people at that time in that room
S0192	yeah
S0196	and i would like to think that erm er wouldn't lie and i would like to think that wouldn't lie
S0192	yeah and i'd like to think that my dad wouldn't strangle her and i'd
S0196	right
S0192	like to think that my mum wouldn't lie about it
S0196	well i mean you'd like to think that your dad wouldn't strangle her and you'd like to think that your mum never have an affair and
S0192	i'm hop that it be maybe my dad my dad grab her
S0196	all stuff like that but it's
S0192	i think my mum have be try to get with for a while before then
S0196	yeah
S0192	and i keep see they that's not the story they spin me when it first happen but i keep hear things about their family
S0196	they're not gonna they're not gonna spin you the same one my mum didn't spin me something correct
S0196	i mean it's just
S0192	well she be tell me they just meet you know coincidentally but actually what it turn out be arrange a meet for them through their mate at the pub and she'd be see him in secret for age before my dad find out and then my dad find out and get angry about it my mum didn't come clean my dad sleep downstairs on the couch and i spend months angry at my dad think that he's do something but it's not it's my mum
S0196	mm
S0192	but they won't tell us that they're keep that secret from us but accord to this poem i'm read it sound like they get together years before
S0196	have it really rile you have it really have it really upset you
S0192	years before whatever no not really i mean just i'm just a bite sad to think that she'd be plan break up with my dad that whole time and okay if she have be plan it for that long she could've do it at a better time in a better way and that's the only thing that's annoy me be clearly these people two i have get no problem that she'd like somebody else instead of my father she'd
S0196	mm
S0192	be have the childhood sweetheart that she keep bump into and she keep fine i mean life be life i understand
S0196	mm
S0192	those things
S0196	mm
S0192	but if she's clearly put in as much time into that as you know she's be see him over the years break up in a better way break up at a better time break up in a better manner it's just all those decisions be do terribly
S0196	i'm sure my mum think but i'm sure you know what i'm sure my mum think the same thing and
S0192	mm
S0196	i know she do she do not want me and i to find out in the way that we do
S0192	mm
S0196	she didn't want us to know that it be with a woman
S0192	mm
S0196	she didn't want my dad to find out the way he do and the complete and utter fallout that happen for the next few years it be disgust and vile and i'd never want anybody to go through it erm and and be do their do er be just start college and be just about to do his gcses they there er that be a crappy crappy time
S0192	mm
S0196	same same time for you it's just it's not as parent
S0192	you don't think your mum could've wait a couple of years until they'd move out
S0196	yeah absolutely but the thing be i don't i don't sit here and think god i wish it it would've be do at a different time it be what it be whatever
S0192	yeah no of course
S0196	you know what i mean it's like it's happen i can't change it our parent love us and i don't think they sit there and think i can't take this any more i'm gonna do this now and i don't care what and feel how it's affect them they don't think that way
S0192	no of course
S0196	because in that moment unfortunately they're think of how it's affect them
S0192	of course mm
S0196	but it's not at the detriment of their love for it's not because they not do you know what i mean
S0192	no er no i don't blame my parent for that now i guess i just take it on my shoulder as something i don't wanna make that mistake again i don't want that mistake to happen in my family
S0196	oh my god do you know how many do you know how many conversations that and i have have in the past not so much recently because i'm very you know i'm fine with it all and i know what i want and don't wanna do but so many time i've have the conversation like i don't wanna be that way
S0192	no
S0196	i don't wanna do this if something happen with even with his parent which be very regular cos they his family's very calm
S0192	mm
S0196	erm and no drama whatsoever erm the you know more so with my side of the family it it er there's so many things that happen i just think like er promise me promise me that's just we're not gonna be that way
S0192	yeah
S0196	that that isn't gonna happen
S0192	definitely
S0196	and i i hope that we can learn from their mistake i think we can but we'll make our own mistake down the road
S0192	no of course no definitely it worry me that some people in the family be have children quite young and stuff i'm like just cos the amount of years you've get like i be surprise that and have have a child
S0196	yeah i know
S0192	so young and i'm
S0196	i be we be very we be very
S0192	i don't know i don't know what they're like together but i'm sure they're great but just the amount of time they've get together just make you feel like something's gonna go wrong
S0196	just the age yeah
S0192	like they're only twenty so
S0196	yeah
S0192	by the time they're forty
S0196	i know
S0192	they're probably gonna want people or want different things so and then the cycle just repeat again
S0196	but you've be with but and i and you and have be together for that long
S0192	yeah
S0196	but you throw a child in the mix it's er very different
S0192	mm especially if you throw a child in the mix pretty early i mean
S0196	right
S0192	you haven't really get to know each other
S0196	but they've be together since for
S0192	they have be together for a while
S0196	for two or three years
S0192	yeah
S0196	but er to be fair two or three years when you're fifteen sixteen and seventeen it's just it's it's there's no point even count it
S0192	you're not really go through that much together be you
S0196	it's not even that you don't know who you be
S0192	once you start
S0196	i be
S0192	once you start move job and move house together and stuff like that
S0196	i when i i i really i know for me i be say to and on saturday like be with make me a like i be so much a stronger person than i than i be you know five years ago or so but be with make me a stronger person than
S0192	mm
S0196	not be with him and er and i don't mean that because if i'm not with him i'm weaker i just that he
S0192	they complete you
S0196	right exactly yeah in that way as cheesy as it sound
S0192	no but it's the truth
S0196	right but at the same time i say i er i can look back over my years with him and without him and think and i know one hundred percent that i didn't know who i be completely one hundred percent mindset i didn't know who i be really by the time i be twenty eight
S0192	mm
S0196	like i know what to say no to what i didn't wanna do what i do wanna do how to go about say it my my my all round morals and principles like i know who i be before then but i be one hundred percent happy with who i be at that age
S0192	at like thirty yeah
S0196	about twenty eight
S0192	mm
S0196	about that age and how do and to to then be and that's what i mean like i think when you're with someone at a young age you have to grow together and we've manage to do that and that's great but to throw a child in there as well
S0192	mm
S0196	i wouldn't wanna do it
S0192	no you need the room to breathe and develop as a couple but quite often they don't have enough time for each other when you've get a child
S0196	yeah i wouldn't wanna do it because you guy have be able to experience you at er at er er by yourself and together
S0192	mm
S0196	you know and i have experience ourselves and together as well
S0192	mm
S0196	you know we haven't go down the same path as and you we've we've go down a bite er bite more of a bore path but a er but
S0192	no it's er
S0196	well i think it's a little i think it's more bore than your path
S0192	not i mean
S0196	you know what i mean but it's just
S0192	mine's be pretty excite but like
S0196	mm
S0192	most people you erm it's nor bore be it it's it's the common life i'm do
S0196	it's not the common life
S0196	you've go out you know i i look at your life and i and you know i don't know the ins and out of it
S0192	mm
S0196	just like you don't know the ins and out of mine but i look at your life and the path you take and i just i take my hat off to you i think it's absolutely wonderful what you've do and i wish that i would've take a leaf out of your book
S0192	mm
S0196	i think it's great
S0192	well you still can
S0196	i can't
S0192	if you want you can
S0196	i've get a i've get a i've get a house i have a life i have a job
S0192	yeah but you're young what about when you're like retirement age you could start do it all then
S0196	i can't i would tell you what that's that's the age where i will probably start do a few things if we could have
S0192	do it
S0196	if we have children in the next year or two
S0192	you don't have to do things at the same time
S0196	no no and i wish i do some sort of travel and we will do i mean we're go to vegas in may so excite
S0192	mm yeah
S0196	erm for two weeks that'll be amaze erm you know and i wanna experience it not just for the the life that it have down there but all the ins and out
S0192	i think you'll be the type of couple that come your later years you'll be pretty comfortable and you'll be able to go off and do these kind of things i think
S0196	i hope so
S0192	i mean i think you will be i think you will be i'm pretty certain
S0196	i hope so but i hope that i've get the energy to
S0192	so if you
S0196	i hope that i've get the energy to
S0192	i'm sure you will
S0196	cos you'll still have the
S0192	you're pretty trim and fit
S0196	you'll still have the bug in you cos it's just in you
S0192	mm
S0196	that's who you be
S0192	go away but erm i feel like
S0196	you will
S0192	most people will probably have similar experience come to the completion of their life maybe we just do things at different time i've probably put i mean travelling's almost become a bite of a hobby a bite of an addiction for me now i've probably put in more than i need to do you know what i mean
S0196	mm
S0192	i've have some pretty amaze experience i could put it down and and focus on something else but
S0192	now my job be abroad so i live abroad anyway that's just part of my life and just need to do it erm i've have to make sacrifice though it's make things harder
S0196	mm
S0192	friends i have different relationships
S0196	like what
S0192	with friends back home now and with
S0196	yeah
S0192	family and just start to feel distant from people and
S0196	yeah
S0192	just you know there's sacrifice from live abroad
S0196	it's it's
S0192	things that i miss things that i'm not here for i've miss your weddings i've miss these kind of things
S0196	it's harder to keep i think you have to try that much harder to keep that connection
S0192	mm you do definitely and i've get friends now that be like i come back and like we get on really well when i see them but like i feel like i've change or i've grow and i don't really see that they've change or grow very much and like
S0196	mm yeah yeah
S0192	i don't know and then i start to think like my best friend now he's get marry next week and we be really good friends before but we be only really good friends really for three years before i go away
S0196	mm
S0192	and now i've be live away for six years so i've live away for twice as long as i be really good friends with him and he's not come out to visit me once in that time and he's not invite me to his wed this time so when you start to think well yeah we're good friends erm when i see him
S0196	but you're not even go to the even
S0192	no he's it's only a really small affair i haven't get a problem with it
S0196	okay
S0192	it's like it's fine but erm when you start to see friends like this and you think well i've live abroad now for six years and you've never visit me once
S0196	but i've never visit you once
S0192	you probably wouldn't i mean that's fine but i understand he's a he's a friend it's a bite different friends and family like i don't know i don't have that same opinion with family i don't expect it
S0196	okay
S0192	with friends to a certain degree
S0196	okay
S0192	we should be of the same kinda mind and the same ilk and like
S0196	okay
S0192	he's travel with me before we travel together so
S0196	okay
S0192	i think he'd wanna travel more and keep do those kinda things
S0196	okay
S0192	so i just guess i kind of feel if you're not gonna come and visit me and when i come home we're not close enough to do these kinda i guess i just his relationship with me just take a step down a little bite
S0196	mm
S0192	and we're still close and i'll still see him when i see him but i'm not gonna expect him to come out and visit me i'm not gonna the it's just take a step down and i've meet other people that i've meet when i've travel that i've get friends from america that be come to stay with me in for a few weeks and like i've travel about six or seven countries with them and i guess i've just come to a different level of friendships with some people now
S0196	mm
S0192	that these guy be just on a different level
S0196	yeah
S0192	to some of my friends back at home i can't really explain it and i've spend like every weekend and i with them we're really really close and we've travel japan philippines malaysia erm they come to ecuador we we go to the state and stay with them for six weeks and er now they're come to england to stay with us for three weeks i guess i've just go on to a new class of friend that i didn't hadn't didn't have in england and it's unfortunate but i'm start to see some of my friends that be here as i'm not gonna live here so i just start to think if i'm not gonna live
S0196	i don't know i think it's i think it maybe be a little bite unfair to say a different class of friends cos it's almost put your your other friends down it's just a different way of
S0192	it be to a certain degree though i know that sound harsh and it's not what i'm say but like
S0196	it kinda do sound harsh
S0192	it's it do sound harsh but like if i'm never gonna live in england
S0196	but isn't it just that you've you're different
S0192	and these friends be never gonna leave england
S0196	mm
S0192	then what be i hold on to i'm not gonna see them very much and i'm not gonna know them but if i've get friends that be gonna be wherever i'm gonna be and i'm gonna be wherever they're gonna be
S0196	but it's not but when you but when you mm yeah
S0192	it be a different class of friend these be the friends that i'm meet that if i live in saudi they'll visit me if i live in
S0196	how okay one okay so how do you mean by how do you mean by class cos my the way maybe that i'm interpret you say that be be not how you mean for it to come across
S0192	yeah erm i guess i feel like by the time i'm older forty or fifty most of my friends be gonna be like those friends and i'm not gonna have many friends leave that be like these friends because what be the point in hang onto and and and if i'm not gonna live in england and they're not gonna leave england to visit me
S0196	mm
S0192	then i'm not gonna see them and i'm not gonna know them and it just it's it's difficult to talk about this
S0196	see i when you say class i think you mean as in you know stature as in like you know they're here and i'm here
S0192	well i no no no no i'm not talk about where i'm no i why would i think that it's like
S0196	i don't know that's why i be say that's how it come across
S0192	i guess it's like these people in england be my best friends
S0196	mm
S0192	and i didn't think you could get any more than a best friend
S0196	mm
S0192	but now i've get a super best friend
S0196	right
S0192	be the only way of describe it someone
S0196	okay
S0192	who not only you know
S0196	sorry that's how that's what i that's what i think when you say it that's why i say well that's a bite harsh so
S0192	no no no
S0196	okay
S0192	no no no no i just mean like these guy be will to travel the world to see me
S0196	mm
S0192	i feel like if i say hey i'm have a wed and it's gonna be in india
S0196	yeah
S0192	they'd make it i know that they'd be there and i'd do that for them
S0196	see now i yeah that that example i get it
S0192	yeah
S0196	because there be certain people that didn't come out for our wed
S0192	yeah
S0196	and there be split that we and i would never think for a second we can't be there
S0192	no
S0196	we would go
S0192	yeah
S0196	that's it that's fine where be you where be you gonna be we'll be there
S0192	i guess that's what i mean by another class of friends
S0196	okay
S0192	these friends be in a different level
S0196	i'm with you i'm with you
S0192	they do these things for me and i do those things for them
S0196	on the same page now yeah yeah
S0192	erm and because
S0196	but you but i think that's just life isn't it you grow and you you you er meet people that be on the same page
S0192	mm and that may be
S0196	that you connect differently with you know just you can still have these friends and you can still be friendly with them and you can reminisce oh god do you remember when we do that when we be fifteen sixteen and you
S0192	mm
S0196	you don't have that with your other friends
S0192	but it's a bite weird isn't it though to be reminisce about between fifteen
S0196	and it's and it's and it's fun why
S0192	because i only know for like two or three years
S0196	yeah but didn't you have fun at that time didn't you have fun
S0192	so let's say let's say we come back and we're forty and we're still reminisce about those three years that we spend together
S0196	why be that sad why can't you reminisce over those three years
S0192	of course you can but if you've be do it every year up until you're forty it's a bite why aren't you make new memories or
S0196	well i guess if well i but you will be with other people
S0192	yeah but not with them i guess you just start to see friends in a different way as you get older
S0196	you do
S0192	and and live in a different country put a whole other spin on it it really do put a whole other spin on friends
S0196	i i bet it do i bet it do
S0192	friends
S0196	i bet it do because it's er you know it's different ways of life and different culture everywhere you go
S0192	i've get friends again they do not email me they don't contact me i will email them i will write them letter i'll do er they don't contact me they will only contact me when i'm in the country and soon as i get back to england 'll drop me a line hey mate you're back in england let's meet up but when i'm outside of the country we have no contact so
S0196	mm
S0192	i don't know what's go on in their live they don't know what's go on in my life
S0196	at least he contact you when you come back though and
S0192	yeah when i come home he do but they're like 's like my brother my best friend and i guess i need his erm reassurance
S0196	mm
S0192	more than he need mine he probably just feel like we're bros we're friends forever whatever
S0196	yeah
S0192	but i guess
S0196	so do you contact him
S0192	i'm more like my mum i'm more more sensitive than my brother be about that kinda stuff
S0196	yeah
S0192	but i want my friends to contact me because i feel bad i'm the one that choose to live abroad so i'm try to contact them and and i feel a bite guilty and i wanna stay in touch with them and they're just not really reciprocate
S0196	god don't feel guilty
S0192	but but er i guess just after years of that you start to think well maybe we're not that close any more maybe i don't need to stay in touch with these people
S0196	you know what it i i think i think er a little bite be that erm it's just it's just life
S0192	yeah it be just life
S0196	out of sight out of mind sometimes when people don't people don't mean it in a
S0192	i guess it's just that you become completely comfortable with yourself at my kinda age i guess i'm learn that and just with certain friends
S0196	yeah and i i er and
S0192	as i say live abroad put a different spin on it you start to see friendships as plate spin a little bite to put it black and white but like well i haven't speak to this friend need to kinda spin that a bite haven't speak to this family member i need to do that doesn't feel like that when you're in england people can live only ten yeah i mean you only live round the corner from mum but she say she hasn't be round yours since christmas or something and it's like
S0196	mm
S0192	it's eight months later so you only have to live round the corner
S0196	when you think about it it's the same when er it when you think when you when you use that as an example though
S0192	mm
S0196	where we haven't sit down and have a cup of tea since christmas and
S0192	mm
S0196	speak it's the same i we could be i could be abroad
S0192	no exactly
S0196	i might as well be abroad
S0192	so distance doesn't really matter sometimes but it just feel different i feel more guilty when i'm abroad
S0196	you get a drink
S0192	you don't feel guilty when you're just i guess you do a little bite but when you're just up the road i guess you feel like you can pop in whenever if you need to
S0196	yeah
S0192	but when you're abroad you don't you don't have that option and i can't just
S0192	find it tougher than i do not be around her family and now er her dad's get old and like she kind of
S0196	do she be that be she er be her parent quite old when they have her then
S0192	yeah i mean she's the fourth child so
S0196	right oh sorry
S0192	she's the
S0192	the youngest so her dad's like seventy now i mean
S0196	wow
S0192	she's the main reason that we're at home now
S0196	yeah
S0192	we have two options option number one be do an ma
S0196	oh i'm on that one be i should i not do it on that one
S0192	no just do it on that one option number one be oh wrong one
S0196	woah
S0192	option number one be do a master's and come back to england see family see friends
S0196	yeah
S0192	do all that kind of stuff option number two which be what i want to do more which be pop home for a month or two go to south africa and do another teach qualification that last like two or three months and then travel africa for a year but once have tell her parent that she might be come home she couldn't tell them that we weren't come home so we kinda have to sit with that one i i would rather have come home for a little bite and then travel cos at the minute with our job i can either do a master's or i can er do a delta there's two different qualifications the master's take a year and be obviously a master's
S0196	yeah what's a delta
S0192	delta i've already get a celta which be this kinda like a level five certificate delta be like a master's but you do it quicker and it's just for teach english
S0196	okay
S0192	both qualifications would put me the next rank on a job so it doesn't matter which i get now
S0196	so hang on can we go back a step what's the what what what do a master give you
S0192	a master's a master's give you simply a master's
S0196	but it but what's
S0196	sorry but what what i mean be be that why would i choose a master's over a delta why would i choose a delta over a master's
S0192	okay eventually i definitely will need an ma to teach at universities you need a master's at least
S0196	okay
S0192	postgraduate qualification to to do
S0196	so a master be here and a delta be here
S0192	erm on the
S0196	on paper
S0192	national qualification framework they're the same
S0196	okay
S0192	they're both a level seven so like
S0196	but this be more know than
S0192	a level a level be level five
S0196	mm
S0192	degree be level six and master's be level seven celta be a level five same as a level and then
S0196	mm
S0192	a delta be a level seven same as master's but both job will take me the next sorry both qualifications will take us the next step in our job
S0196	yeah
S0192	but the master's be better overall it's something we'll need definitely we'll need a master's we can't keep progress but for the next two or three years we could live without one we could still get a better job with a delta so i guess i want to postpone the ma do it a little bite later and to travel like i have itchy feet pretty badly and i be get a bite stress come home think like really stress out try to get this apartment and stuff all this bullshit that they make us go through to rent a fuck apartment
S0196	what do you have to go through
S0192	it make it really complicate by live abroad
S0196	mm
S0192	i mean just like you know you have to do reference and stuff
S0196	yeah
S0192	and you have to give your last bunch of years that you've live in but i've live in random countries and random place so that's complicate things
S0196	yes yeah
S0192	then they need bill from where i've be live
S0196	yeah
S0192	i don't pay bill i live in a completely company provide accommodation okay so we need your company to sign off that you do this okay but they don't speak english and the time that they're awake er they have to ring them and then they didn't like the email address i give them it have to be an official email address from the university so i have to get all my boss involve we have to sign form we have to do i have to get a ridiculous amount of paperwork then they need bank statements for the last six months from me what's annoy me be i'm tell them i have the money to pay you the rent for a year up front and they still have to do all this
S0196	yeah oh god
S0192	er i just have to send so much documentation at this point i get a bite stress and i just think
S0196	i bet cos it's bad enough do do a a mortgage and rent here without all that

S0194	right
S0192	if we're not marry they just don't respect relationships

S0194	oh right
S0192	and if she want a proper ring she can
S0194	and that be the picture that we saw

S0192	no
S0194	stress stress what we have at ours
S0192	yeah
S0194	it be like yeah
S0192	yeah
S0196	what do you mean
S0192	you see i'm tempt to just get my makers there so just mum and dad
S0194	or just have your brother cos have she get siblings
S0192	and then just well i mean yeah this be the problem we kind of think about if we have siblings but then she's get three siblings and they're all marry and they've all get kid so it start add up the amount of people
S0194	yeah yeah
S0192	so we think just her parent just my parent that's it
S0194	yeah
S0192	so just four people
S0194	yeah you've gotta do what you wanna do
S0192	and just sign a piece of paper
S0196	what about
S0192	not even cos as i say once come then we've get siblings so then we need to invite her siblings and then she's
S0194	yeah
S0192	get three siblings and they've get children you know
S0194	and everyone's get older and everyone's have children so one person equal a family of four or six and it's just like

S0196	be alright without his invite
S0192	well be there when i propose
S0196	oh lovely so that's

S0194	yeah so you do like the main thing
S0192	i say to him at the time like i might not invite you to the actual and he's like don't worry about it he felt honour that he be there when i do it anyway so

S0192	but erm we're not traditional i get her a wooden ring well even if we
S0194	be she catch out or not
S0192	yeah she be quite surprise she be really surprise erm even if we do
S0196	i didn't know you weren't traditional
S0192	no
S0192	we're erm
S0194	where the status quo be the other way
S0192	we may not even change her name like if we get marry because change her name would triple the cost of the marriage it's it's only
S0194	oh
S0192	forty pound to sign it down the registry office but it's a hundred and twenty quid to get a new passport
S0196	yeah a lot of people won't change their people don't change their name though
S0194	yeah say that my passport cost me about eighty five quid
S0192	yeah it's a i've get a bumper one

S0196	you don't have sugar do you
S0194	oh my god no thank you no

S0196	yeah it's
S0194	what's what's
S0192	so every time i see you i'll be record you they're not listen to what you're say they're just listen to your accent and the word that you use colloquialisms like basically it's about dialect so they just wanna hear what do people sound like in what do people sound like in
S0194	well do you know what the funny thing be someone say to me when i be out i dunno shop or whatever and she come from a different area and she say to me she go oh i can tell you're from you've get a accent i say do we have a accent she go yeah you can tell the people around i'm like really
S0192	that's one
S0194	i'd never know yeah apparently we do
S0192	that's one of the question yeah you do mm
S0194	yeah
S0192	but
S0196	there's definitely a accent do you wanna go to and have a conversation with them
S0192	a lot of people when they turn around yeah
S0194	yeah
S0192	's get one
S0196	yeah but would be very interest
S0192	but i ask my dad
S0196	go with a military vest on just in case as well
S0192	yeah i know but a lot of people like especially from around receive pronunciation queen's english area will often say i don't have an accent
S0196	mm
S0192	you know what i mean
S0194	yeah
S0192	but everyone have an accent
S0194	everyone's get one
S0196	you do yeah i guess
S0192	every single person have one
S0196	yeah
S0192	mine i i sound posher than i should do from like
S0196	yeah
S0192	around people think i'm like some posh twat or something
S0194	yeah you do sound no you just er
S0196	mm
S0194	sound very well speak
S0192	well i have a tendency when i'm talk to friends to drop in a lot more swear word because
S0194	yeah
S0192	i guess it make me feel not so posh in some way
S0194	yeah yeah
S0196	what you purposely do
S0192	probably yeah i've notice myself when i'm listen back it's call accommodation i've study it in linguistics people adapt the way that they speak to accommodate with the people that they're with
S0194	yeah but i think i do that with different network of friends different group of friends
S0192	it's it's true it's sociolinguistics
S0196	i pick up what other people say
S0192	yeah
S0196	i'm like a sponge when it come to at work there's this girl that laugh and she go
S0192	and then you do it
S0196	and i've hear myself do it
S0192	yeah
S0196	that's disgust
S0192	it's call convergence
S0196	and also there's this there's yeah there's this girl at work who
S0192	there's it's a sociolinguistic study into it
S0194	what to feel accept to feel become
S0192	to become attach to become connect yeah so you you don't consciously do it but you
S0196	i do it too much yeah
S0192	er i mean do you remember when you be a kid i don't know if it ever happen to you but go into a corner shop and an indian say something to you and then you reply in a kind of indian accent have you ever do that
S0194	yeah
S0196	i do that now still sometimes
S0192	and you're like i'm not take the piss like
S0194	no you don't know you're do it
S0196	no no sometimes i do it now i'm in the car and i'm like
S0192	it have a term
S0196	he er you know he say oh it's it's twenty pound i'm like it's twenty pound
S0192	yeah twenty pound
S0196	like stop it oh my god it's terrible
S0192	but it's it's natural and we all do it and it's call accommodation you can do it both ways you can converge and sound more like someone else or you can diverge and sound less like somebody else cos you don't wanna sound like them
S0196	right okay
S0194	you don't wanna be associate with em at all
S0192	so yeah you don't wanna be associate with those people so it go both ways
S0194	you could do a bite of both you could look like you've just step out of or something or
S0196	i think
S0192	mm
S0194	you know hang out in for the day and
S0194	do you what i mean and and and literally you know
S0196	you just do it then do you know what
S0194	i'm do it
S0196	do you know what i mean
S0194	i'm do it
S0196	you don't usually say that
S0194	i'm do it aren't i
S0196	you don't usually say it that way
S0194	isn't it funny yeah but i mean it's because i'm talk about it
S0192	yeah
S0196	yeah
S0194	yeah yeah it's weird isn't it
S0196	but i think you've always sound how you sound
S0192	yeah
S0194	yeah
S0196	you don't sound any
S0194	you've never be one for slang or be you alright or
S0196	you don't sound any different to me
S0192	no
S0194	mm not really
S0196	and it's probably the you know the the career that you're in and what your what you teach and
S0192	i mean the fact that i teach english so i should pronounce my ts cos when i come into my class and my students be like if i say wa'er or compu'er to them they're like they can't spell it
S0196	yeah
S0194	yeah
S0192	they need to know that there's a t in there so i'll like pronounce it
S0194	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	i do drama for a while which mean er that i annunciate i i speak to foreigners all the time so i end up speak some kinda pidgin english where i'm not even actually speak properly but when i'm with my friend like he'll come round and we start just like er

S0192	mm
S0196	no i say film
S0194	no no we can say that
S0196	do you wanna watch a film
S0194	film yeah
S0192	in part of the world they say fil m they add a schwa in between the l and the m
S0196	fil m
S0194	in where
S0192	part part of the part er sorry certain dialects of english there be some strange things
S0196	really
S0192	there be some strange things they're in ireland they do it it's call epenthesis they add a sound in between the consonants because because they don't have
S0196	love the irish accent
S0192	in english we can have the consonant cluster l m together
S0196	right
S0192	we can say ulm and that's fine
S0194	yeah
S0196	yeah
S0192	that work in our dialects but in other dialects it doesn't they need to put a vowel in between it they can't say ulm they have to say ul m
S0194	once you've do this though where would where would this linguistics er master's take you like be that be that for teach be it
S0192	erm the reason i'm do
S0196	be it twenty to twelve already
S0192	yeah
S0196	bloody hell
S0194	mm
S0192	the reason i'm do linguistics and not teach english be because i can i tell you about those other qualifications i can do other qualifications in the methodology and pedagogy of teach but i want to do something more theory base and more about language something that will open me up to be able to do a phd in something so if i do linguistics potentially if i do linguistics and and study phonology a bite i could and i've consider with one more year i could be a speech therapist if i continue on so that's another area that i could be
S0196	that'd be amaze
S0192	i don't really wanna do it because i can't travel very well on it or do anything else that's something that i might do when i'm like forty or fifty like i might change career go off and do speech therapy or
S0194	yeah and you've get the mortgage to pay and the kid need something
S0192	elocution or something like that
S0196	could you do something international because of the languages or do you cos the languages that you've that you know
S0192	mm
S0196	can you do something that's internationally base or would you erm need to have the qualification in languages
S0192	do you mean to do with with speech therapy
S0196	like er like erm i don't know the the terminology yeah or
S0192	i need to very very knowledgeable about the language that i'd be teach that i'd be fix
S0196	okay mm
S0192	i'm
S0192	i'm there with english because i've be study english for so long and i've be get into phonology and everything but i mean i guess i could in spanish or something something of a similar language but once you start go into a tonal language or something like in
S0196	okay
S0192	asia or
S0194	when you say phonology what be that
S0192	phonology there's phonetics and phonology phonetics be the study of all language sound and how we make the sound so different part of the mouth different part of the teeth the different sound that you make phonology be language specific so in english we use these sound and they're use to differentiate these word and how we use them be like this cos not all sound be the same either
S0196	mm
S0192	although we have a p like a d in english and t in english be different to a d and t in spanish
S0196	mm
S0192	they do the alveolar trill when they do a d we go d here but they go duh duh on the t so they'd say wa der kinda like the american duh duh water
S0196	mm
S0192	it's a different d so that would come under phonetics phonology would be specifically what we use it's the it's the speech
S0194	so interest
S0192	i i can write in a different alphabet and that's phonetic alphabet so because english orthographically isn't spell how it look it's not
S0194	really
S0192	pronounce how it look i mean you look at the word borough how do a g h become an uh sound
S0194	yeah
S0192	you know or how do a g h become an f sound when you have enough it doesn't really make any sense
S0194	but see i'm teach they're teach phonics to like and
S0192	mm
S0194	so that's how they start them off in school now
S0192	i don't like that
S0194	really
S0192	be they teach them like guh o guh and kuh a tuh
S0194	a buh kuh duh e fuh
S0192	yeah i don't like that and i don't think it's gonna be
S0194	but i get it because when she's say kuh at you don't go erm c a t
S0192	no
S0194	because she's not gonna recognise that be she
S0192	now if she say kuh a t
S0194	yeah
S0192	that's fine
S0194	yeah
S0192	but they don't they add another vowel they say kuh a tuh and now put that together and kuh a tuh be not a word kuh a tuh do you say kuh a tuh no you say cat k a t
S0194	yeah
S0192	so if they teach it as just the sound with no other vowel attach
S0194	but they try not to like erm
S0192	let's find k a t cat
S0194	what be it like nuh they don't want you to go nuh they nn nn like
S0192	but my problem with that be and i wouldn't teach like that be because that's so basic and you can only teach a handful of word like that because most word in the english language don't follow those rule you can't teach word break them down into their individual sound what i teach be ipa which be a completely different alphabet because that cover every single sound in all languages in the world so you don't need to spell things differently
S0196	can you bring your picture up while you're do that sorry
S0192	yeah of course
S0196	i'm just think if i need to
S0192	i can tell you about this another day what be i show you cambodia when do you need to leave cos i need you to sign that thing before you go
S0196	bring it up yeah i'll sign it now

S0194	it's like
S0192	where would it be poems and letter 's proposal here you go i know we don't care oh you can read it i don't really care much for tradition but

S0192	er regardless of whether we actually get marry i want you to have a proposal that's worth remember this commitment be all that really matter a promise between you and me somewhere beautiful historical and meaningful
S0196	i love this
S0192	get out the ring

S0192	stage directions
S0194	i actually think i be organise but you be like a whole new level

S0194	i'm love this
S0196	i know
S0192	this ring be but a symbol of our love it probably doesn't fit neatly on your finger which it didn't it only fit on that one or that one
S0196	oh
S0192	er so she can't wear it on that but she doesn't have ring so i couldn't measure it on anything so i kinda have to like
S0194	oh
S0192	what be i gonna do like tie a piece of thing they be bear from the earth and they grow and they become strong and unique and like us they be wind together in this perfect shape and they become dependent on one another and they'll remain that way until their end you're my world
S0192	and everything in it we've already have so many experience together yet i feel our adventure be really just begin if you'll let me i'll spend the rest of my life beside you as your equal will you accept my proposal will you marry me and she do
S0194	oh my god
S0192	so in our eye once i've say that and she's say yes and my brother's be there to witness sign a piece of paper what do that mean
S0194	yeah
S0196	yeah
S0192	to us it doesn't really mean anything so
S0196	it it's it it be what it be for you guy and that's the main thing
S0192	you know to us but everyone be quite confuse when we put up on facebook that we get marry cos i want to skip the whole proposal bite for me it's a bite like a get out clause we get propose but we don't you know there's still time i could break up with her we're not actually marry yet
S0194	oh what you don't like long engagements
S0196	well yeah but it's it's yeah but it's what yeah but it's
S0192	yeah
S0194	yeah i i i'm the same
S0196	yeah
S0192	so we just skip that
S0194	yeah
S0192	process and for like
S0194	i be engage for like however long
S0192	as as far as we're concern we're marry and i mean we
S0196	but do you go and get you go and get marry or be it proposal
S0192	no we're not marry
S0194	so you it's not official it's not official yet
S0192	no we're not marry
S0196	no i didn't know whether you have
S0192	and we may never be
S0196	this be where i've be confuse i didn't know whether you have in a particular country where it's not legal
S0192	no no no we haven't
S0196	it right okay
S0194	but i think if you're gonna propose
S0192	but i mean in 's case we have joint bank account we work together we live together and have live together for ten years
S0196	you're live
S0194	yeah you be
S0192	we can't be any more marry
S0196	you're not do anything different than any a marry
S0194	yeah
S0192	no i
S0194	mm
S0192	kinda bother me that go to the middle east i could meet someone marry them and i've only know them for one month and i can live with them in the middle east but
S0194	mm
S0192	somebody that i've be with for ten years and i've do all this
S0194	yeah
S0192	stuff with them that that doesn't count
S0194	but it's like 's er godfather they've be together for twenty six years and then
S0192	no
S0194	they're everyone think they're marry but they're not
S0192	no
S0194	you know they've have a son they live together do everything but she go we just don't don't need it
S0192	don't believe in marriage don't wanna get marry
S0194	no
S0192	right
S0194	and i think after those many years it's like well why do it now and they almost feel like maybe it's like jinx or something it's like well you know
S0196	well i always this be completely er slightly off scale this be this be celebrity but i remember i be flick the channel and i saw tina turner be er interview by
S0192	mm
S0196	oprah and she have recently just get marry to her long term husband who she meet after she divorce from ike who obviously
S0194	mm
S0196	be that be that be their relationship and they've only just get marry now and she say i never want to didn't want to after especially after that experience didn't want to didn't see the point er we be marry it's fine
S0192	yeah
S0196	she go but then the older i get and now i'm she go i think she's nearly i think she's eighty like nearly she look amaze but erm she erm she say the reason why be because i'm not gonna be here for much longer
S0192	no
S0196	i don't know when he's when we're gonna pass and she say and he isn't he he can't he have no erm er legal erm what's the word
S0194	right
S0196	right to anything that we have build together
S0192	yeah
S0196	she go and that's the reason why we're do it and yes it's lovely to put that symbol but she go that's er that's the reason why we're do it and so we think let's just have a big party and celebrate it she go but that's why because she he have no legal right and that's not fair
S0192	my dad isn't gonna marry i think erm because she's quite sick i think it be quite sad but i think have she not get sick they probably would've get marry
S0196	mm
S0192	and he'd be talk about it but now she's like terminally ill
S0192	he erm she's from quite a wealthy family and i guess he feel like if he marry her now then it may look like he's after her money or something so he really doesn't wanna do that

S0192	yeah
S0194	like be you mad like
S0192	ready to pop this one out
S0194	i'm not i don't just pop em out when you know whatever but
S0192	how difficult be pregnancy
S0194	alright
S0192	mm
S0194	unfortunately though because of all what's happen with mum and dad i have a bite
S0192	it's a terrible time
S0194	stress
S0192	hang on a second someone's
S0194	yeah sure
S0192	oh it's just the next door neighbour that's alright
S0194	yeah
S0192	i don't know them
S0194	yeah
S0192	the actual birth part
S0194	like unfortunately well be a complete and utter nightmare so it all just go pear shape i think because
S0192	mm
S0194	i be diagnose with preeclampsia which i'm undiagnosed so i be get like
S0192	what be that exactly
S0194	so basically it's like they call it oedema so i have major swell on my feet but when you're pregnant you always like puff out and swell out everywhere
S0192	yeah mum go really funny it be the the last one
S0194	yeah yeah with er yeah yeah
S0192	yeah i be here and she be all really swell and like
S0194	yeah yeah so that's what i have
S0192	yeah
S0194	but i have it well i have it but the my midwife be just like i think one day she just say okay that's like not normal
S0192	yeah
S0194	erm and you get sort of extra protein in the urine and sort of backache erm you know things just symptoms that aren't quite right blood pressure's really affect
S0192	mm
S0194	erm and so she send me to hospital and they carry out a test but nothing be really sort of flag up or anything so they send me home but i be get terrible back pain like all across my back to the point i be like on the tens machine and like highest level and nothing be really do it
S0192	oh man
S0194	and i think one day i be in so much pain be just like i've have enough of this
S0192	yeah
S0194	erm go into hospital and basically erm one of the women that my mum know she be work in the hospital and she say oh can you get her to see one fo the consultants that you know so i have one of the top consultants and i think within about forty five minutes she say erm you've get very high risk preeclampsia basically what it do it it preeclampsia can it just it they don't er preeclampsia doesn't like the state of pregnancy so it can basically stop feed the baby
S0192	oh my god
S0194	i can go into a brain haemorrhage and
S0192	pretty dangerous then yeah
S0194	yeah all sort it's like really bad
S0194	so basically you have to stop the process which unfortunately then bring on early labour
S0192	yeah
S0194	so a month early he come
S0192	but be much easier i think
S0194	so they have straightforward
S0192	yeah
S0194	straightforward due date be the twenty seventh of april she come on her due date of twenty seventh of april
S0192	oh wow
S0192	that can't happen very often
S0194	and i have a natural birth which be like lovely
S0192	yeah
S0194	i do have pain relief i do have
S0192	yeah
S0194	an epidural
S0192	yeah
S0194	i i get
S0192	that's an injection in the spine
S0194	yeah and a lot of people be like oh i didn't want pethidine because that can pass to the baby and blah blah blah but you know the epidural only affect me
S0192	yeah
S0194	it be to help me and myself i be gonna be one of these au naturel
S0192	mm
S0194	i'm not have pain relief i'm not have anything
S0194	i'm do it au naturel
S0192	and then you start go through it
S0194	and the doctor look at me and he be like okay but don't put pressure on yourself
S0192	we'll see
S0194	like you know you you know there's you know there we be in sort of modern day life now we have these things here to help i be like no no no i'm gonna be totally you know and you have to be sort of dilate basically ten centimetres and i get to like six and i be like oh my god
S0192	yeah give me some of this
S0194	so and it be great after that i just pretty much sleep through it it be like very
S0192	wow ten centimetres
S0194	oh
S0192	i remember those old fifteen centimetre rulers so you're get on like
S0194	ten centimetres mega
S0192	wow
S0194	and when you think be like what ten pound something
S0192	he be an elephant wasn't he yeah he be a beast
S0194	no so
S0192	i've get a friend that erm she have her first child good friend she say she keep have she's have flashbacks to the labour
S0194	oh i i don't think it's fair that people say it because i think people who haven't have children
S0194	at the end of the day to have something so beautiful that last your whole life
S0192	yeah
S0194	you have to go through a bite of pain like do you know what i mean
S0192	yeah
S0194	the way i see it and yeah but there's a reason why so many mother go on to have more children
S0192	yeah
S0194	you know it's not like we stop
S0192	you forget pain pretty quick
S0194	you do it's like
S0192	yeah
S0194	it's one of those i i must admit i swear after because it all go pear shape with and i try to give i i be try to give birth naturally and then his heart rate drop
S0192	mm
S0194	so they rush me into theatre and he so he be a caesarean
S0192	c section yeah
S0194	erm so i really want natural but because i the scar be still quite fresh they be like we don't want it to rupture and i say well i really want a natural birth i don't wanna have to go through all of that again
S0192	mm
S0194	so they keep an eye on me and it be fine erm but i swear after that i wasn't gonna have i say in a way i say to him you've get your son
S0192	yeah
S0194	you know
S0192	you we're do
S0194	blah blah blah er we're do
S0192	yeah
S0194	and he be a bite upset but it take me a good year to really feel myself
S0192	yeah
S0194	again and then
S0192	yeah
S0194	i wasn't speak to mum so for the first sort of six months of become a mother i didn't have a mum that i could turn to
S0192	yeah
S0194	so i felt i be rely on book oh god all these book i have and
S0194	you know and friends that have have baby that be pretty much what i be rely on
S0192	mm
S0194	and then it take me a good year to feel myself to feel back to normal
S0192	mm
S0194	and then it be like i never felt the sense of broodiness but i just sort of think i know that i didn't want to be an only child
S0192	no it be time to have another
S0194	it's not it's not a it it's not fair really i felt like i be do it for my own selfish reason and i think i be no way you know one day me and aren't gonna be here i want to know that they've get each other
S0192	no yeah each other yeah
S0194	so
S0192	you must be a very proud mummy
S0194	i be i be yeah i i'm i be love it i be love it but i'm one of these mums who worry about everything
S0192	yeah
S0194	be i do enough read be i do enough this be they educate enough be they stimulate enough
S0192	but that's only gonna be a good thing
S0194	oh god yeah but it's a nightmare
S0192	yeah
S0194	to the point where it's like oh my god my friend's like you need to go counsel or something like you really
S0194	i'm always i've always be a worrier anyway haven't i
S0192	yeah
S0194	i've always be one of those who worry about what people think and whatever so motherhood just take you to another level i absolutely love it and embrace it
S0192	mm
S0194	but you know it's er i'm one of those that if you stand in a playground and hear a mum go oh my son's go up to the next read chapter and you're think okay why hasn't my son go up to the next
S0194	and it's like i know i've gotta disassociate myself with all of that but
S0192	yeah
S0194	it's just so hard
S0192	yeah
S0194	it's really hard cos you just want the best but i think the way things be now i mean obviously i don't know you might say different but i feel like now it's like it's a race as to how quickly your children can do things
S0192	yeah
S0194	you know i've get a few friends who be like privately educate and it's like oh they speak fluent french at two and a half
S0192	which be ridiculous school yeah
S0194	and you know they they do this and they can do that and they're write sentence at three and a half years old and you just
S0192	yeah
S0194	and it's almost like a race to how quickly your child can
S0192	this be one of the main problems i have with the education system really be that we're we we have this idea that you need to be at the peak of your education by the age of about eighteen and you need to know what's go on and you need to
S0194	mm
S0192	have get through it at the right level and be at the right speed and everyone learn everything together and
S0194	okay
S0192	and if you come out at school at sixteen or eighteen with a c you're gonna carry that for the rest of your life that's that's what you be you're a c grade student because clearly at eighteen you get that
S0194	oh my gosh
S0192	i don't agree with that at all i think
S0194	no because what you experience and
S0192	study should be a lifelong process you should it shouldn't
S0194	yeah
S0192	be something that you do between this time and that time
S0194	i don't know anyone who complete master's and university and feel well educate by the time they're eighteen because there's so much further education that you can still do
S0192	people learn those things differently no yeah mm
S0194	like doctor and lawyers and whatever else and teachers they're not fully experience until like late twenties to be honest up until you're fully
S0192	i know it's easy to say yeah but don't worry about like 's performance too much at school
S0194	oh
S0192	if he's a little bite behind at this point or a little bite ahead at some other point er he will learn
S0194	i think be gonna be i can't say for certain but she seem quite forward
S0192	yeah
S0194	you know she's do things quite early
S0192	yeah
S0194	her i'm not as worry and she just seem to naturally you know pick up people be astonish that she be write her name at like two and a half three
S0192	yeah
S0194	so she's do things you know and i don't know if it's just a boy thing or what but be just like put him in sport and he love it
S0192	mm
S0194	you know i mean and say to me he go never like school
S0192	yeah
S0194	because i literally should've be sit my gcses and i be out already try to learn how to do plumb
S0192	school be one mould and we're not mouldable like everyone can't fit in that one shape
S0194	no
S0192	so they're
S0194	i know
S0192	that's why kid get put on ritalin and all these stupid things because
S0194	god yeah
S0192	they're basically not fit in with this one rule of how we all be some students excel in that because they're quiet and they do what they're tell and they
S0194	yeah
S0192	memorise things easily
S0194	it's character it's everything
S0192	other students yeah
S0194	it's everything that contribute towards it you know
S0192	i be terrible at school i be a i would hate to have teach myself at school because i be constantly distract
S0194	yeah
S0192	constantly bore constantly
S0194	and get himself really upset if he's not grasp it it's like but mummy i'm really try i say you know don't worry you know
S0192	oh bless him
S0194	so i've already i mean he's fine
S0192	be he six now
S0194	yeah he's yeah
S0194	and it's not like he's not i don't think he's ever gonna be top of his class
S0192	no
S0194	he's never gonna be in the bottom i think he's just
S0192	yeah
S0194	gonna be one of those but i think when you go to like erm you know like erm you know like normal school not private school i think you you know they seem to charge a lot of effort into the excel ones
S0192	yeah
S0194	you've get the ones that obviously need the extra help and then i find the ones that be just on the average just tend to sort of get leave
S0192	they get leave out yeah yeah
S0194	you know like when you go to i've look we've look into private school they take no more than fifteen to sixteen per class
S0192	yeah
S0194	you know and there and there's like three or four teachers so every child be get really like a lot of focus in 's class there's thirty
S0192	ah they be so expensive
S0194	course it be what be it we erm to put into well to er to put both our kid in private school you're look at a flat fee of anywhere between twenty five and thirty grand a year
S0192	yeah
S0194	that's not school uniform that's not
S0192	and they're gonna come out different as well
S0194	course they can and once you put em into there and you can't afford it you i don't think you can then take em out and put em into
S0192	no
S0194	a comprehensive school cos i just think then it's
S0192	they don't get on
S0194	they're they're yeah they be who they be and erm they're mingle with who they mingle with and however you wanna put it that it they're that be who they become you know so
S0192	yeah mm yeah all these stress of have children
S0194	i think one child i think yeah i i would do everything i can and i'd plug em in but at the same time i've i've get friends private school and the way they be and the cliquiness and
S0192	mm
S0194	you've gotta take on the whole social part of it as well
S0192	mm mm
S0194	you know you can't just turn up to a birthday party with a ten pound toy r us voucher
S0194	you've probably gotta show up with like you know
S0194	oh you're give him horse rid lessons for a year or you know do you know what i mean it's like that whole part and parcel
S0192	move up to another class of people yeah
S0194	yeah and i can't be false i can't do all of that you know
S0192	no don't worry about it too much
S0194	but we're look at private tuition i mean it's it be really i really get on well with one of 's school teachers and she's just now recently leave and she actually come and pull me to the side she go i'm actually leave the the school she go i couldn't approach you before but she go i actually do private tuition now that i'm leave if you feel that you want to have extra lessons
S0192	mm
S0194	erm i'm more than happy to come to the house
S0192	okay
S0192	i think she mention she charge an hourly rate of twenty five an hour but she say i'll do it for twelve so if he need it
S0192	brilliant
S0194	you know i think he's do alright say we need to stop worry but i just don't want him
S0192	mm
S0194	he's already get to where he need to be and i don't want him to hit the next year and he feel overwhelm and then he sort of just fall
S0192	yeah
S0194	back i wanna keep him where he be
S0192	i think i dunno it's easy to say cos i don't have children but maybe not worry too much until they're like ten maybe
S0194	yeah
S0192	i reckon because
S0194	middle school
S0192	i think with prior to ten people school for me in my opinion at least from the experience i have you're kinda gonna learn those things anyway just
S0194	mm
S0192	by be alive it's just people learn them at kinda different
S0194	yeah
S0192	rat and
S0194	yeah
S0192	the school be merely facilitate it and also primarily look after you
S0194	yeah
S0192	while your parent work
S0194	yeah
S0192	so i kinda think up until ten everyone should get to that i mean unless he's really struggle or something
S0194	but i don't want him to get to ten and then he's really like you know you also wanna pre empt
S0192	no he need to be keep up he need to be keep up with everything for sure but i'm sure he will i'm sure he be
S0194	yeah he's alright i mean he get a good report you know it's not like he's always try he's fine
S0192	he's well behave and stuff he's just like
S0194	yeah yeah he have the i think he he be
S0192	must be weird to think about your child and like but i mean it doesn't matter how much you
S0194	he's easily he's easily distract so he'll
S0192	doesn't matter how much you input it really be up to the child isn't it the type of personality they be
S0194	well this be it because everything i do with and because he be first child i be completely anal
S0192	yeah
S0194	so it be like you know every night it would be like read but also you know make sure he be learn alphabet
S0192	mm
S0194	and word and number and so i be do all of that and this be like when he be three months old because they say you know you start do all the sound and stuff early and we go
S0192	mm mm you do
S0194	oh we go to all i go to baby college with him
S0194	which be like this like you know and it be just it be learn all sound and it be like little things like when he be just learn to sit up one of the exercise we do in baby college be er they would sit up and i lay in front of him so we're like face to face and he'd just be sort of prop up on his arm look at me and she'd go can you shake the the rattle like the object in front of you shake it leave to right and i be like well why do it leave to right why not right to leave she go because when you go to school you write from leave to right
S0192	from leave to right yeah
S0194	and and then you'd have to rotate and and then like turn the rattle around hide it behind your back and then do it again so you weren't change it swap side in front and all these things that i be do so i've do i've do it all like you know
S0192	mm yeah i've hear about that from mum like seem to have be quite into these kind of things it's good
S0194	yeah yeah but then do you know what i mean but look look at she didn't do much with and seem very sort of you know well adaptable and forward and whatever so i think cos he it be my first child i be one of these oh my gosh you know do everything
S0192	mum be like that with me i think she be a bite not quite the she be quite anal i think
S0194	yeah but and i think oh yeah and there's just so much now there's all sort baby sign and oh there's just everything go on now it's like ridiculous baby yoga baby this baby massage it's just
S0192	big business
S0194	mega money course it be you know some of it be just like no chance he go baby yoga for god's sake he do it on the floor when he's
S0192	yeah
S0194	play with his toy
S0192	do it himself
S0194	we're not gonna go and pay
S0192	yeah
S0194	for like i be like oh okay and i be think i be get catch up but with sound awful i do so much with and i do do the same with but i've almost i've chill out
S0192	yeah
S0194	so much more you know like with everything be organic everything even
S0192	yeah
S0194	herbs spice everything i mean we spend a fortune on food i be like no he's gotta have everything good and
S0192	mm
S0194	pure and we spend a fortune on food and then you know no salt no sugar so you know whatever we be cook sometimes you need an some
S0192	mm
S0194	no no no salt so i'd always cook separately or do a separate pan for when i add his and then with round about ten eleven months i be like well i'm do a massive sauce doesn't matter if there's a little bite of salt
S0192	no
S0194	and i be a lot more relax
S0192	yeah
S0194	and she's a lot more chill
S0192	yeah
S0194	's very quite like when i
S0192	probably hide all that energy from you

S0194	and i try so hard not even when i be you know i've get such a sweet tooth even when i be pregnant i be just like eat load of fruit and veg
S0192	mm
S0194	i didn't eat a lot of a chocolate and he be a chocolate monster
S0192	yeah
S0194	well cos i think he know you be deprive yourself so it's just i think they be who they're gonna be you know
S0192	yeah
S0194	there's only so much that you can do
S0192	you can do specially with all this advertise everywhere
S0194	it's ridiculous and i think that's where a lot of the pressure's come from
S0192	oh definitely i read a few article about people that say erm my i don't have a tv when i go to the supermarket my children don't ask me for anything because they haven't see the advert
S0194	true
S0192	they haven't see the things on tv

S0192	and so i can see that happen if you don't have a i reckon most of the want come from tv
S0194	it's true
S0192	so
S0194	i mean that's the trouble with my two and they so they're spoil we can afford like we're not we're not mega rich by all mean you know

S0192	she didn't sound too up for it to me today
S0194	yeah but she she she i think i think deep down she do
S0192	yeah
S0194	i think her and her and seem to think they've gotta have x amount in the bank to have kid and i'm
S0192	mm
S0194	just like that's never gonna happen there be never er gonna be
S0192	correct amount mm
S0194	unless you're a millionaire or some sort of celebrity there's never gonna be you but the thing be you just you find it and you just get on with it like with anything you do
S0192	yeah
S0194	you just get you just get by
S0192	be you surprise that be the second out of the four of you
S0194	yeah very
S0192	yeah
S0194	the thing be i be a bite
S0192	think he be quite young
S0194	i be a bite erm er sort of surprise but not that you know be one of these oh i've be tell i don't think i can have kid so okay then don't use contraception
S0192	oh be that what happen
S0194	mm
S0192	who tell her that her mum or something or
S0194	so it be almost like well 's have a bite of a bad she's not have the best of upbringings
S0192	no that's it
S0194	you know her mum's choose her fellas over her
S0192	yeah
S0194	children so she meet a guy decide to swan off to america and live out there and leave em all in hostals let em get on with it so from the age of fourteen 's pretty much look after herself
S0192	bloody hell
S0194	so you know she's get a lot of issue her dad do live in this country but pretty much doesn't want anything to do with her so you know i take on what she's have to deal with
S0192	mm
S0194	so she may be quite immature in some ways but i have to say she's an excellent mother very over the top cautious and protective i think because she's never have it herself so she's go the other way with
S0192	mm could be for the for the good er maybe if she's learn from her parents' mistake
S0194	i know but then i'm just a bite i say i'm not gutted cos obviously i've get my niece and she's
S0192	yeah
S0194	adorable but i'm gutted for my brother that you know he's now watch money and pennies and have to provide for a family at a young age when
S0192	yeah
S0194	he's not really experience
S0192	before he have a a life himself

S0192	yeah
S0194	save for a mortgage or get himself just something
S0192	yeah
S0194	you know

S0194	well the thing be what be they gonna do have an only child like you know i think they'd like another child
S0192	yeah they'll have another one
S0194	but be be er quite sensible he's like well if you want another child one you've gotta get back into work
S0192	mm
S0194	and secondly not for at least four years like you know he go i have to find my feet

S0192	she's get bigger hasn't she i saw her the other day
S0194	mum's the biggest i think she's every be now
S0192	yeah i think she be actually
S0194	she erm be
S0192	the first thing she do when she saw be go in the shop and buy a load of candy and like give him some and it be like
S0194	she do it all the time she think i think that's her way of like you know and i'll say to mum er should they have their portion of fruit
S0192	terrible for children it's a drug you're keep them addict to sugar
S0194	but the thing be mine i have to say mine for two weeks be awful i mean i don't like fizzy drink i'm a bite anti them
S0192	yeah
S0194	but she you know on holiday oh you know can i have a coke yeah okay we're on holiday
S0192	yeah
S0194	you can have your chocolate milkshake and yes you you're allow some whip cream on there because the waiter have show him and
S0192	yeah
S0194	so i didn't wanna be like but now it's like i almost feel like i've gotta wean em back to
S0192	yeah
S0194	you know and i've get a sweet tooth so occasionally after dinner they're like well mummy you know what can we have and i'm like well
S0192	cos you're addict to it
S0194	you know maybe you can have a bite i mean he be so good with his food like in the begin he eat anything and then i have real issue around seventeen eighteen months we come back from holiday and all of a sudden it be like i don't want this i want this i want you to live off more pastas and
S0192	mm
S0194	and then every time i go to 's which be his mum she be all like oh let him have pasta as long as he's eat and then slowly but surely he wasn't revert back to my fish pies
S0192	no
S0194	and cottage pies and it be all like so unfortunately have become quite a fussy eater
S0192	yeah
S0194	you know he's alright but his variation on vegetables be probably about five that i rotate
S0192	yeah yeah
S0194	and it's just er oh it's a real big thing at the moment
S0192	i be bad when i be younger wasn't i i didn't eat much
S0194	no
S0192	on the sweet tooth front do you do do you have honey at all
S0194	mm
S0192	erm
S0194	erm
S0192	cos like raw honey a hundred percent raw honey with some plain yogurt i find really be great for a sweet tooth and
S0194	really
S0192	the most research i've do into pure honey there be actually
S0194	be it the one that actually say pure honey
S0192	well this be the problem
S0194	because you can go into tesco's and see pure honey but be it really pure honey
S0192	no you need to get raw honey it's call raw honey you'll probably find it online easier than you'll find it in the shop
S0194	someone recommend me manuka honey for when you're
S0192	it's yeah manuka's really good for you
S0194	i've get manuka in the cupboard
S0192	oh that's really good
S0194	and i be erm
S0192	that's from new zealand that's not cheap that's really expensive
S0194	no it be about i think it be about six seven pound for a a pot
S0192	manuka's raw that's really good
S0194	be that raw honey because
S0192	yeah
S0194	i use that someone say when you're run down or cold
S0192	mm
S0194	you try and have that with some like warm water or
S0192	it's it's an antibacterial or an anti inflammatory honey it erm if you eat local honey it can help with allergies to local things
S0194	oh
S0192	so like if you eat local honey cos the be be collect pollen from all the things so it can help with local allergies it doesn't erm dissolve your teeth like sugar do in fact because it have antibacterial properties it's actually kill the bacteria in your mouth
S0194	oh my gosh
S0192	not stop it so i if i have a sweet tooth i have a little bite of honey and some yogurt and it's really nice
S0194	so be you quite now not into sweet foods or
S0192	erm i'm still an addict to sugar i since i've come back i have have a chocolate bar because i'm like oh i haven't have that for four years so i'll give it a try
S0194	mm yeah the novelty of like all the foods here
S0192	and like there always seem to be a birthday or something so there's
S0194	yeah
S0192	a cake be cook or there's something go on but and i be very strict in the week and then probably come the weekend we'll relax a bite and like have something but
S0194	i'm a bite like that
S0192	monday to friday we don't have anything at all and then
S0194	see i'm terrible especially after do an all inclusive two week holiday
S0192	yeah
S0194	i'm just like i almost find i'm have to i can't get my head back into it yet but i buy one of those erm i don't know if you've hear it's call a nutribullet and it's just basically like a really erm like a food blender but it's a really
S0192	mm
S0194	good one that blend it and i just spend something ridiculous
S0192	yeah it just blend the lot
S0194	like sixty quid at holland and barrett but i literally buy the chia seed pumpkin seed everything you could think of
S0192	mm
S0194	spirulina spirulina powder all of everything you can think of and what i do be just literally you know there's and they've get a recipe book so
S0192	mm
S0194	what i do be i try and have one of those if i can
S0192	good stuff
S0194	i have one of those for lunch today
S0192	yeah
S0194	but the children be beg me for a spaghetti bolognese but what i do be i just blend load of carrots i hide all the vegetables in there so
S0192	yeah
S0194	even though it's pasta it's just really hard to avoid
S0192	yeah cos bolognese be carrot and celery and onion really isn't it yeah
S0194	well i always put that i mean i do i do carrots and onion and erm garlic i
S0192	yeah
S0194	tend to put in things like that
S0192	so you can get the veg in though that's
S0194	oh god yeah
S0192	just give em less pasta and have more sauce
S0194	yeah
S0192	so it's all good
S0194	but it's very hard cos 's like cure to everything be food
S0192	i try to be conscious i like pumpkin seed and i love nut and seed
S0194	you get a headache eat you hurt your foot eat have a bad day eat you know 's and when i say god it's not always about food yeah well it's better than have a cup of tea
S0194	right and we have this sort of so cos even be with all these years it's a huge cultural thing
S0192	mm
S0194	it's like you know they're probably more like english italian but they're very like food be like the centre of everything you know
S0192	yeah yeah yeah yeah i can imagine
S0194	and it's lovely because you know every sunday we still eat at his mum's and his and his brother and sister so it's like
S0192	every sunday
S0194	ten to thirteen of us at a table and we'll eat and it's like and then you know and we'll sit and congregate which be nice cos they've
S0192	mm
S0194	get a very close relationship with their cousins but it be just yeah you know you go on holiday and i'll remember say a certain sight or what we've see and they'll be like do you remember that restaurant we go to
S0192	that food yeah that we eat
S0194	ah yeah
S0194	i feel like be i the only one who's like think this be a bite odd yeah
S0192	i do try and yeah i probably eat too much fruit i probably eat more fruit than i should really
S0194	god i don't think that's i'd rather eat more fruit than i would er
S0192	yeah i should probably eat up my vegetable intake i eat plenty of vegetables but i should probably eat more vegetables than i eat fruit but i probably fruit
S0194	yeah i guess there's the natural sugar isn't there er so
S0192	yeah they're still not terrible you're still get a lot of fibre and a lot of nutrients and stuff from the fruit but
S0194	my problem be though if i'm hungry erm i'd rather go for a rich tea biscuit than a
S0192	yeah
S0194	apple that's my problem
S0192	yeah
S0194	a quick fix
S0192	you'll avoid the process stuff if you can
S0194	mm
S0192	i'm pretty good on that front but as i say come the weekend and my friends come over and they've bake us some blondies or some cupcakes or something
S0194	what's a blondie
S0192	like a brownie but with erm
S0194	oh be that an american thing then
S0192	yeah i guess so
S0194	ah see i didn't know what a blondie be
S0192	no it's not brown it's white and it's usually with white chocolate in it and the white's so nice it's good yeah blondie
S0194	oh oh yum
S0192	they're really good
S0194	mm
S0192	or like they'll come over with some muffins or something they've make and then i'm like whatever it's the weekend so
S0194	i do there's time where once i'm on it i'm on it and i can say no
S0192	mm
S0194	but er sometimes and especially from a woman's point of view if it's if i'm due on i just
S0192	mm
S0194	get this oh
S0192	yeah
S0194	yeah
S0192	just go for it i don't like dark chocolate either so i can't
S0194	i don't and i think if any chocolate it should be hundred percent cocoa which i can't stand
S0192	and i don't like yeah i don't like candy now the only i i haven't have a fizzy drink touch my lips in three four years i don't drink those i just drink water
S0194	i i do like i do like sparkle water
S0192	yeah
S0194	see i don't know if that's good or bad but i love
S0192	what about juice do you give your children juice
S0194	i do i buy the innocent juice which be well er accord to what you read it's mean to be like one of their five a day so if they do have juice i do the one that's
S0192	i've read quite a bite about juice that say juice be really bad that you
S0194	mm
S0192	shouldn't give them juice the the problem be okay you've get all the cheap juices which i'm sure you know they're just no good it's basically sugar water
S0194	mm
S0192	but even stuff that's like a hundred percent oranges or a hundred percent apples
S0194	still not
S0192	the problem be that the high fructose content of an orange be negate by the fact that it's get high fibre high nutrient blah blah blah blah blah so when you eat one orange yes it's quite high in sugar but you're you're only eat one orange and you're get fibre and nutrients
S0194	mm
S0192	problem be when you have a glass of orange juice about yea big that's five oranges so you you'd never just eat five oranges in a row
S0194	no
S0192	so it's the juice of five oranges so you're get all of the sugar from five oranges
S0194	yeah
S0192	but you're not get the fibre from the five oranges and some of the nutrients your body can't process them because it's so high in sugar so everything i be read it be like if you have juice have like that much so you're like have one apple's worth or something
S0194	yeah
S0192	you shouldn't because when you have a glass like that it's like i mean i've make orange juice you need like five big oranges to like get
S0194	oh god it's mega it's mega
S0192	yeah like apples so i haven't drink fruit juice in a long time either
S0194	i'm i'm terrible for sweet tooth
S0194	's not really get a sweet tooth at all
S0192	i do
S0194	he
S0192	honey and and er yogurt just me straight off it's really good for a sweet tooth
S0194	well what kinda yogurt though greek or
S0192	plain i've get greek now so yeah just anything that's just not sweeten just plain yogurt really
S0194	yeah see i've get too much of a sweet tooth day
S0192	but once you put the honey in it it's as sweet as anything and it's not do you the damage that whatever else that they put in it be
S0194	yeah i find a lovely sort of erm
S0192	try a bite of manuka honey i bet that's good
S0194	er yeah i can take because i've get use to the normal honey
S0192	teaspoon of manuka honey
S0194	and i do have the manuka i try to get to drink it when he be run down he be like oh mum

S0194	he do like that
S0192	so yeah with like banana bread or something
