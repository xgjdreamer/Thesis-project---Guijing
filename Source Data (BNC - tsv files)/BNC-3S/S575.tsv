S0018	well it's not i think we work it be about
S0019	we all use it
S0018	it be a fiver a week be it cos if
S0017	mm

S0017	it's four pound something
S0019	i can't remember how much the little ones be

S0018	bless you well yeah let's work this out so for can you remember how much
S0017	i've get the bill upstairs i'll tell you exactly
S0018	but be it like four fifty or little bite closer to five
S0017	i er er
S0018	you don't know okay
S0017	i can't remember no um
S0019	you don't owe me anything
S0018	mm huh

S0017	mm
S0018	i haven't give you the money for the coat
S0019	right that's thirty nine
S0017	mm
S0018	yeah i just hope
S0019	but that's all
S0018	i'm gonna wear it cos i how long can you get to send it back
S0019	you can't send it back now you've wear it they'll be they'll be able to tell it's be wear
S0018	but i only wear it
S0017	i have mean to say do you want to pre order another bag of your cat food while we're at the vet
S0018	oh
S0017	and i forget when we get there
S0019	mm
S0018	i should've think of that yeah
S0019	no i think you've have it too long now to return it
S0018	be that the twenty eight days or something
S0019	i i can't remember uh
S0018	oh well well i'll keep it for the very very cold weather
S0019	mm
S0018	i only just hope it doesn't make me look like too much of a marshmallow when i'm wear heel with it
S0019	i don't think it do at all
S0018	i do
S0017	come on thorn
S0018	come in i do cos it's such a big bouffanty coat and it's not tailor it's not nicely
S0018	shape
S0019	right
S0018	it make me look like a marshmallow
S0019	right in which case i think probably the best thing you can do be to trot it along to and ask her if she can reshape it
S0018	but the reason it's such a big bouffanty unshaped coat be that it's stuff with down feather so i think
S0017	mm
S0018	unless she kind of get a hoover out slash a hole in
S0019	and that really sort of defeat the object of have a down fill coat doesn't it
S0017	mm
S0018	and deflate the down fill coat
S0019	well okay just keep it for the very cold weather
S0018	yes i will
S0017	mm
S0019	hopefully we won't have any more very cold weather
S0018	well yes
S0019	be it warmer than the two that you've be wear
S0018	it's definitely warmer
S0017	mm
S0018	definitely definitely
S0019	good so at least you've get a warmer option
S0018	yes that's true
S0019	ooh my feet
S0017	for the summer when it come
S0018	oh yeah
S0019	look just don't joke about things like that
S0019	just don't joke
S0017	well they say they really be concern about the er the gulf stream
S0018	why
S0017	change because of the cold water come off the melt ice cap in the arctic be deflect the gulf stream so it will not come right up to the west coast of scotland and therefore won't come down our west coast er so it do risk make our winter significantly colder
S0018	no
S0017	hmm
S0018	what about global warm
S0019	well just be thankful it wasn't last winter be all i can say
S0018	oh gosh
S0017	mm
S0018	if that'd be
S0017	mm
S0019	cos last winter be dreadful
S0018	oh that would've be horrendous
S0019	that be really bad
S0018	yes no that be cos i be here over christmas wasn't i
S0019	mm
S0018	yeah that be horrendous freeze cold that be
S0019	well it be colder than that wasn't it after christmas
S0017	yes
S0018	and didn't it snow in november or something
S0019	we have early snow
S0017	it start very early yeah
S0019	didn't we yeah
S0017	mm
S0019	it be horrible horrible horrible horrible
S0017	mm this winter have be so incredibly mild
S0019	mm
S0018	yeah
S0017	mm
S0019	i reckon you
S0017	i've never have my boat on the water as early
S0019	mm
S0018	really
S0017	mm
S0019	i reckon you owe us a hundred and fifty pound for everything six months' cat light
S0019	twenty pound a month
S0018	you've just put a random
S0019	well
S0018	ball park figure on it
S0018	haven't you
S0019	twenty pound for six months and the coat alright a hundred and sixty pound then
S0019	simples
S0017	mm
S0018	so maybe you should've be the pe teacher er and
S0017	yes
S0018	she should've be the accountant
S0017	yeah mm
S0019	don't think so i can't imagine him as a pe teacher
S0017	why i can shout loudly
S0019	with your lack of ball skills
S0017	mm don't have to do it just tell them how to do it
S0019	no you do have to demonstrate from time to time
S0017	mm
S0019	oh dear i can just see that no i can't no i can't er
S0018	um i have to find out how much that flight be as well cos i can't remember exactly how much if it be a hundred and sixty or have you get the visa
S0017	i can
S0018	bill somewhere
S0019	i can find it
S0017	i can access
S0018	okay
S0017	the history online anyway
S0018	sorry to make this complicate
S0017	yeah i should think so too
S0018	no i'm just try to find how many payments i've make
S0017	oh mm
S0018	to for for the fee
S0017	yeah
S0018	and how many payments they've make me for the bursary because they're try to say that
S0019	mm
S0018	they want the bursary for january back er but i see that they charge me fee in february so i don't know whether
S0019	really
S0018	yeah i'm just try to i'm just try to work out if i the february fee be for january
S0017	in arrears or in advance yeah
S0018	be that the word you use in arrears
S0017	in arrears
S0019	mm
S0017	yes
S0019	but they can't have it both ways
S0018	well the problem be it's two different departments so if they set
S0019	huh
S0018	different if they set different um tut
S0017	yeah
S0018	er guidelines
S0017	mm leave hand and right hand don't know what
S0019	mm
S0018	well they're just not look at it holistically
S0017	mm mm
S0018	i mean they're in their complete right to set these guidelines and
S0019	but it seem unfair that they say we want your fee but we want your bursary back
S0018	yeah but whoever say
S0019	that's not fair
S0018	whoever say anything be fair
S0019	no
S0019	but it's not right
S0017	mm
S0019	i would be argue
S0017	mm
S0018	i've live
S0019	that you can't have it both ways
S0018	i've live
S0017	yes
S0018	through more unfair things yeah and they'll just say oh well it's a condition of a condition of you receive the bursary if you defer your place you you can't
S0019	you forfeit
S0018	have that month that you defer but then the fee department they probably say oh if you even study two days of one month you be liable to pay fee
S0019	oy oy oy oy
S0018	so i can see how the situation have arise i've just gotta check
S0017	mm
S0018	to see whether that february one be
S0019	mm
S0018	pay in arrears or not
S0019	but you need to speak to somebody
S0017	mm
S0019	as well and say look you know be this right
S0017	yeah get the information before
S0019	yes
S0017	talk to anybody
S0018	it's it's definitely right cos they've send me a letter to that effect
S0019	but who do the letter come from
S0018	um the department that pay the bursaries
S0017	the bursary i can understand completely it's
S0018	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0017	the fee
S0019	yes yes absolutely
S0017	that be mm
S0019	but i don't get the fee
S0018	no but the thing be if it wasn't the thing about they want the bursary back you probably wouldn't question that i have to pay fee for the month that i wasn't there but
S0017	mm
S0018	that i defer in would you cos er if you i be still a student until about the eighteenth of january even though i be only there for two days because um the holiday go up to the
S0019	mm
S0018	i can't remember when
S0017	mm
S0018	but if it if that situation be in isolation you probably wouldn't question it would you you'd say
S0017	no
S0018	oh well yeah you be enrol in january henceforth you should pay the fee for january
S0017	no i would say
S0018	it's just in comparison with
S0017	yeah but if you if you two days out of a a month's course and during that two days you be already in discussion about
S0019	mm
S0017	continue or not then they should make no charge for the month
S0018	yeah i agree
S0019	mm i think you could argue that
S0017	mm
S0018	yeah but it'll all be guidelines and what they normally do and
S0017	yeah it it have to be put in a way that they've get discretion and they exercise the discretion
S0019	mm
S0018	but they probably don't have discretion or the people that do
S0017	i
S0018	be the ones that don't converse with students
S0019	yeah but you need to just ask the question see whether they can
S0017	mm
S0019	change their mind you never know
S0017	mm
S0019	you might have somebody sensible and sympathetic on the other end of the phone
S0018	you never know
S0019	you never know
S0018	you never know
S0019	and thorn's decide he like that chair sit there with his paw tuck underneath him
S0017	's here watch him
S0019	mm
S0017	intently
S0019	silly boy
S0018	i wish
S0019	silly boy
S0018	barclays would just give you an online record of all the transactions you've make
S0019	yeah
S0018	my spanish bank account
S0017	mm
S0019	it's too easy
S0018	but if i go down and do a transaction like pay for something in the supermarket on my card
S0017	yeah
S0018	as soon as i get back home and log on to my bank account
S0017	you can see it
S0018	it would be there
S0017	yeah
S0019	mm
S0017	mm
S0018	now these don't even update them for two or three days
S0017	mm i the best system i've see of all be the one that be now ing bank be bank brussels lambert and i could go back for nine years' history
S0018	really
S0017	on that
S0019	jesus
S0017	yeah and it be very easy to make international payments um you know it be a very effective system it's only that they change the security system from passwords to those little machine that have mean i've no longer get access to
S0019	hmm
S0018	really
S0017	mm have to do it all herself now
S0019	mm
S0017	it could be arrange but it's for the i be glad for the opportunity to make it necessary for to do the payments herself
S0019	yeah
S0017	because it be it be silly me do some and do when she have curtain and carpet and things she could she could pay those
S0019	mm
S0017	but the big you know er things like electricity bill and builders and things like that
S0018	well it look that i it look like i start pay the fee at the end of november which doesn't really make any sense whatsoever
S0017	do you not pay any by any other mean at the start
S0018	it doesn't look like it i definitely didn't pay cash
S0017	you didn't pay on on a card
S0018	well it would come up here
S0017	mm
S0018	if i have on my statement but but i really don't know
S0017	well you could ask them for a detail statement of the fee from the begin of term year rather
S0018	yep
S0017	so that you can reconcile it
S0018	actually i think they er they send me an e mail with the break down sum of how much i would pay in the future
S0017	mm
S0018	to pay off the fee
S0019	mm
S0018	so maybe i should just find that
S0017	yeah
S0019	mm be that your phone or mine
S0018	yours i think
S0019	uh ah who's texting me
S0018	it be like the um my orange er you know my er account with orange the telephone
S0017	the one
S0018	the new phone yeah
S0017	yeah
S0018	um they say you've get
S0019	two message
S0018	fifty free minutes to speak
S0017	mm
S0018	and i don't know how much information that you can download or you know they set a limit on how much internet you can use
S0017	yeah
S0018	even though they say it's unlimited they do actually set a limit
S0017	there's a
S0017	there's a fair use policy
S0018	that's right
S0017	yeah
S0018	so take out the word unlimited then cos it's
S0017	yes
S0018	not
S0017	yeah
S0018	um but you can check
S0019	mm
S0018	to see how many minutes you've get leave but there's always this disclaimer that say um the data might not have be update for four days
S0017	mm
S0018	so you never know
S0017	no
S0018	what data you
S0017	no
S0018	and it doesn't put a time
S0017	mm
S0019	dear god
S0017	that um the dongle i've get for use
S0019	mm
S0017	for my laptop when i'm down at the boat um i get on the screen be a bang up to date number of megabytes
S0018	mm
S0017	that i've use in today and the previous month and all tell since the start i'd convince myself i remember check their fair use policy and it's one gigabyte a month
S0018	mhm
S0017	but it say mm er what i do be pay up front for a three month contract and that i pay twenty nine pound ninety nine for three months the fair use policy be one gigabyte a month but when you look at the word it's a calendar month now i start on the twenty seventh of january
S0018	right
S0017	and i'd be compare what i'd be use and i'd forget about the one gigabyte and have convince myself that it be thirty megabytes and when i be down at the boat this last trip i'd get up to about twenty two and still get another week and a bite of the month to go and be get concern that i be get near the limit
S0018	ah because the
S0017	i have set a warn

S0018	why
S0017	because you then go onto a pay daily or pay weekly or pay monthly contract
S0018	well why
S0017	because it be a a three months' agreement
S0018	uh huh
S0017	and it end at three months otherwise if i carry on use it at the end of three months i start pay about five time as much

S0018	yeah
S0018	i wish they when they give you statements i wish they wouldn't print other things on the
S0017	oh er
S0018	back of it
S0017	it be it it
S0019	mm
S0018	it's you
S0017	the
S0018	uh
S0017	decades ago they talk about computers save paper
S0019	yeah
S0017	our electricity bill use to come on a piece of paper two thirds the size of an a4
S0019	mm
S0018	mm yeah
S0017	and you know they'd print back and front
S0019	with useless information
S0017	um credit card statements use to come on the same sort of size
S0018	mm
S0017	and now every credit card statement i might get my average number of transactions on the credit card be probably two or three a month and yet i still get two page
S0019	mm it's crazy
S0017	it be stupid
S0018	ludicrous
S0019	crazy
S0017	and they're all a4 sheet now
S0018	yeah
S0017	instead of you know smaller
S0018	and this be thick paper too
S0019	mm
S0017	mm
S0018	they could at least use
S0017	yeah
S0018	recyclable paper
S0019	mm
S0018	recycle paper
S0019	uh
S0018	but what annoy me be that you can't file it properly you can't use it to refer to because
S0017	oh yeah
S0018	see here for example i
S0017	yes
S0018	i've get
S0017	yeah no i understand it be
S0018	not all of the side be
S0017	yeah
S0018	print with the statement
S0017	yeah
S0019	mm
S0018	some of the side be some of the side aren't
S0017	mm
S0018	but as you say there's just so such a waste of
S0019	mm it's ridiculous
S0018	i remember when i phone them up because for me it's completely illogical to have a statement that start with the least recent payment would you not expect er a statement to be the most recent payment you've make
S0017	the bank no the bank statement start
S0019	no
S0017	from oldest to newest
S0019	yeah
S0017	that's be tradition
S0019	i would expect that
S0018	you see it's the opposite when you look at it online it's the most recent
S0019	good god how
S0018	so you get use to one way and then you see another one
S0019	oh
S0018	and my big bugbear with them
S0017	i've not i've not see any systems that show online just the most recent
S0018	no i mean in the list the order be the most recent payment first
S0017	mm no
S0018	that's what barclays have on
S0017	mm
S0019	mm
S0018	and that's what my spanish bank account have
S0019	mm
S0018	but also because i hadn't make any transactions in a year or i'd make less than
S0019	mm
S0018	eight in a year
S0017	mm
S0018	they send me all of the ones for a year in no no no no wait there i can't remember exactly what it be but i'd make so few transactions that i receive one for march but the only date they put on it be the thirteenth of august the twenty sixth of january the
S0018	tenth of february they don't put the year next to the transaction
S0017	oh right
S0019	helpful
S0017	yeah
S0018	and so i couldn't work out
S0019	mm
S0018	oh no that's right
S0017	mm
S0018	yeah so i have it start in march and it end in march
S0017	mm
S0019	but which year
S0018	but it didn't it wasn't clear
S0017	didn't
S0018	which
S0019	mm
S0018	year
S0017	which year
S0018	be which
S0017	yes mm
S0018	and i just assume
S0019	yeah
S0018	that it be the
S0017	it be the same march
S0018	most recent
S0017	yeah
S0018	no i
S0017	mm
S0018	no i assume no i didn't assume that it be the same march
S0017	oh
S0018	cos there be
S0019	mm
S0017	right
S0018	payments in the er in between those for other months but because they don't specify the year and because i be use to see the most
S0017	mm
S0018	recent
S0017	right
S0018	transaction
S0019	yeah
S0018	first
S0017	yeah
S0018	i think six hundred quid have be take out of my bank account that march we be in march
S0017	yeah
S0018	when i
S0017	mm

S0017	mm
S0018	out of my bank account and he be like six hundred pound hasn't be take out of your bank account this march i be like it be i've get a statement here that say it
S0018	and then i realize

S0017	absolutely
S0017	mm
S0019	oh dear

S0019	i'd just ask you if you'd have your last payment from spain
S0018	mm
S0019	and you say yes but it wouldn't be till next month
S0018	yeah
S0019	oh dear
S0018	so that's
S0019	life get very complicate
S0018	another thing to see whether i can transfer some money over from spain not that i need to but it just seem silly that it's over there maybe if the the value be drop
S0017	mm
S0018	i haven't keep an eye on the value of the euro have you
S0017	i haven't
S0018	yay
S0018	well do thorn
S0017	you do move fast when you want to don't you thorn
S0019	mm
S0018	he he tell her
S0017	mm
S0018	good boy good boy
S0019	the one outside the post office
S0018	good boy
S0019	i think be
S0018	good boy mm
S0019	one twelve
S0018	good boy
S0017	mm
S0018	i know but in relation
S0017	i er
S0019	but
S0018	to
S0017	yeah i
S0018	i don't know if it's be
S0017	i would imagine if anything it's be relatively stable
S0019	mm
S0018	really
S0017	because they've sort of agree that support for greece
S0019	mhm
S0017	so the the pressure on
S0019	yep
S0017	the euro have lessen a bite for the time so it's probably not be quite as volatile
S0018	good
S0017	and depress as it be
S0018	mm
S0017	but if you want
S0018	well maybe i should just leave it over there
S0017	to check at any time o and a dot com
S0018	oh no i look at
S0017	mm
S0018	xe
S0017	oh right
S0018	dot com
S0017	mm
S0018	but yeah fff it's all much of a muchness
S0017	mm
S0018	i saw in though that there's um a foreign exchange shop that be pay i think one thirty it say in the window one thirty pound and euros we euros we buy one three eight o or something so that would mean that they'd pay you one pound for each one point three eight o euros
S0017	sound like
S0018	see that doesn't sound like a bad exchange rate for buy
S0017	well it it it might've be
S0018	oh but wait wait though do that mean when you're buy the euro or when they're buy it from you
S0017	without see
S0019	i think that's
S0017	the full story it's
S0019	them buy from you oh i don't know
S0017	no you buy from them
S0019	i really don't know
S0017	i would think i i don't know but the those be always expensive place to deal
S0019	mm
S0018	really
S0017	yeah
S0018	hmm i don't know whether just to leave it over there and to to spend on my spanish card as and when i need it because it didn't seem like for example i i think i buy something in boot on my spanish card
S0017	mm
S0018	and the
S0017	well you
S0018	exchange rate that they apply be quite
S0017	yeah but
S0018	be quite decent
S0017	will will they not also apply a currency charge
S0018	it didn't look like they have
S0017	mm cos what what i've see them do on some of the charge i've pick up um they charge you get an exchange rate but then they treat it as cash so it's charge as a cash draw not as a purchase
S0018	oh right
S0017	so you could find that there's a charge for cash draw
S0019	mm
S0017	of a couple of pound each time so do watch for that
S0018	well nothing come up on the statement to that effect
S0017	mm
S0019	mm
S0017	yeah
S0019	well maybe they didn't then
S0018	i dunno i don't know it's all complicate
S0019	it's all too complicate for me
S0018	and the problem be nowadays you get the feel that they make it complicate so
S0017	oh yeah
S0018	as to
S0019	oh yeah
S0018	pull the
S0017	yeah indeed
S0018	wool over your
S0017	mm
S0018	eye
S0019	yeah oh yeah
S0017	yeah
S0018	so that you don't realize so that you're end up pay more money
S0019	mm
S0018	like the orange bill the first one they send me be on paper
S0019	mm
S0018	but they'd charge me one pound eighty to send me a paper bill and now
S0019	god
S0018	you have to log in to your online
S0019	hmm
S0018	account if you want to change that
S0017	mm
S0018	however they make it so difficult for you to find the little bite that say er online statements not paper statements and then you can only do that if you upgrade your account you can only change things like that online if you upgrade your account and you have to pay to upgrade your account
S0019	oh god so they've get you whichever way
S0018	yep it's
S0019	which be the least expensive
S0018	it's absolutely ludicrous and the the fact that they make it all so
S0019	mm
S0018	complicate
S0019	which be the least expensive option
S0018	well i mean er fff
S0019	to upgrade the account
S0017	normally online
S0019	or paper
S0018	well it depend
S0017	mm
S0018	cos you you i don't know how long i'm gonna be with them so er i mean we're talk about a monthly if they're send me a monthly statement
S0019	mm
S0017	mm
S0018	but again you just get the feel that they're make it complicate so that you trip up
S0019	mm
S0018	or er that it's just so complicate that you don't
S0019	you don't bother
S0018	bother
S0017	mm
S0018	do it
S0019	yeah that's more like it mm
S0018	which be extremely annoy
S0019	yep
S0017	yeah so it's like
S0018	sorry
S0017	the airlines have be
S0019	mm
S0017	look for ways to
S0018	yeah
S0017	charge
S0019	yep
S0017	load of extra things in
S0018	yeah
S0017	what they charge um they huh
S0019	they charge you for check in your bag
S0017	mm
S0019	um what else be it they charge you for
S0018	pay
S0017	yes
S0019	yeah
S0017	yeah
S0019	charge a credit card payment

S0019	mm
S0017	it use to be two pound or two pound fifty
S0019	mm
S0017	and now quite often it's seven or eight pound
S0019	mm
S0018	yeah
S0017	so the suitcases be five or six pound
S0019	yeah
S0017	and now they're twenty pound
S0019	yep
S0017	plus in some
S0019	yeah
S0017	place
S0019	i think some charge you thirty
S0017	and they try the one i book for go to glasgow with flybe um they make it very difficult not to take the insurance

S0019	she be book her insurance as well
S0017	she be she be accept the insurance not realize you have to uncheck it not

S0018	yeah for the moment
S0019	no you say e er european
S0017	yes
S0019	um yeah for the moment mind you hopefully it won't change in three months but you never know

S0019	yeah i think you ought to
S0017	and as i say check the age
S0019	yeah
S0017	thing as well
S0019	cos that's the last thing we need
S0017	mm

S0017	mm
S0019	yes
S0017	i need the exercise
S0019	well take your slippers off then it's that horrible squeak leather noise
S0018	do you do it to make the squeaky noise be that the objective of the
S0019	no he just fiddle with his feet all the time

S0018	have you not get your hear aid in
S0017	no
S0018	have you stop wear it

S0019	i know what the answer be
S0018	i know but i'm ask him
S0017	see i don't even need to hear the question do i
S0018	so tell me why be you not wear it
S0017	um because the majority of the time most of the situations i'm in where it would be helpful it actually make things worse
S0018	yeah
S0017	in the car on the boat in anywhere where there's more than two or three people
S0019	oh excuse me uh
S0017	and in a situation like this as long as i be aware somebody be talk to me
S0017	i don't have a problem if i'm look at them they're look at me then
S0019	yes the problem be that you're never go to get use to it if you don't persevere that's the problem
S0017	my concern be that the hear in that ear be so bad that it will never get to be a help and that what i need to consider be have one in my right ear later if my right ear deteriorate any further
S0019	have there be a hear loss in your right ear
S0017	to some extent yes
S0019	hmm but that could be just normal age relate
S0017	oh it be
S0019	couldn't it

S0019	it's not like the other ear
S0017	not on a comparison with my leave
S0019	no
S0017	no but there be so little hear in my leave ear now
S0019	mm

S0019	mm
S0018	cos it oh sorry the woman whose mother give it to nanny
S0019	mm
S0018	when she buy it for her engagement ring it be already a second hand ring wasn't it when she buy it it be second hand
S0019	that i don't know
S0018	i think
S0017	that ring a bell
S0018	i think so cos
S0017	yeah
S0019	i really don't know
S0017	or something like that
S0018	and it kind of make sense
S0019	could be mm
S0018	numerically in the years because nanny receive it when in the nineteen sixties
S0019	well no you see it no no it be actually give to nanny no give to
S0018	no to nanny
S0019	to nanny
S0018	steal it from nanny
S0019	yeah
S0019	but it be that be
S0018	and then leave it to me in her will
S0019	yeah
S0019	no that be much further er er along ago
S0018	uh huh
S0019	it wasn't um that sort of era it be before the war i think it be in the nineteen twenties
S0018	what be
S0019	that the girl who have it as her engagement ring be kill
S0018	oh i think it be
S0019	in a motorcycle accident
S0018	no cos er i have
S0019	with her fiancé
S0018	understand that nanny track it back nanny have receive as we see my brain do things most recent date first
S0018	that it have be give to nanny in the nineteen sixties and that the woman have die in the nineteen forties
S0019	no it be the thirties that the girl whose engagement ring it be who be kill in the road accident with her fiancé
S0018	yeah so if the ring be build in nineteen seventeen
S0019	yeah
S0018	one would imagine that when she
S0017	mm
S0018	buy it it be already second hand
S0017	yeah
S0019	but exactly what the journey between nanny and be i don't know
S0018	well nick it out of nanny's jewellery box
S0019	oh no i don't think she nick it out of nanny's jewellery box
S0018	borrow it
S0019	i think it be
S0017	mm
S0019	er another case of 's well i'm the eldest daughter i should have it
S0018	mhm uh
S0019	cos i think it i don't know whether
S0018	excuse me
S0019	it might've be pass to grandma i don't know i can't remember
S0018	no cos it it be give to nanny
S0019	yes but i mean be it give to grandma her mother first and then grandma give it to nanny
S0018	no it be give to nanny
S0019	mm

S0019	no this be some relative of the family
S0018	well nanny tell me that this be this ring be give to her by a lady with whom she work in hospital whose daughter have die in this motorcycle accident
S0019	well that's the first i've hear of it be somebody from hospital
S0018	maybe because you're remember it wrong no no no no no that can't be possible
S0019	well whatever
S0018	oh and we've get the whatever now
S0019	mm i don't know
S0018	uh
S0019	but i think it be much further back than that
S0018	in what respect
S0019	that nanny get it and pinch it
S0018	well that be what happen but
S0019	but i think it be much further back
S0018	that what be much further back
S0019	that nanny get the ring and pinch it much further back
S0018	oh right
S0017	way way before nanny get to
S0019	yeah yeah
S0017	hospital
S0018	oh

S0017	she's forget to say please and thank you
S0018	yeah she have hasn't she
S0019	she never learn how to say that
S0019	um i think it's it's not not too bad although there be certain things that she remember differently
S0017	yeah
S0019	to me
S0017	she doesn't remember date and i it's probably very much like um she doesn't make an effort to remember them because she know that your mother will
S0019	er i don't know
S0017	take responsibility
S0018	mm
S0019	i don't know er i think her memory for past events be not too bad but i've notice that she's get things incidents from two separate occurrences mix um
S0017	run in the family then
S0019	and there be one one occasion a couple of weeks ago i can't remember what it be now but she say something have happen to one person and i say no it wasn't it be so and so
S0017	mm
S0019	be it oh
S0017	mm
S0019	so she hadn't remember so er it's reasonably alright although as you say she do get things mix from time to time but
S0018	mm
