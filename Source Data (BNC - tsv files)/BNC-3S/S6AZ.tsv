S0653	oh in spaceballs
S0655	yeah
S0653	that be the the parody of it
S0655	mm
S0653	mm so it be do a sort of copycat funny version of it
S0655	mm
S0653	but i've never see the original cos i i don't like scary film
S0655	er neither do i i don't like scary book but if you're write it
S0653	mm
S0655	it kinda have a different effect
S0653	it do doesn't it cos i can definitely think of scary story ideas and write them yeah
S0655	but if you
S0653	but i don't wanna read them
S0655	yeah
S0653	cos then they're in my head forever do you fancy have erm a kind of pyjama night on saturday night in the live room
S0655	i know
S0654	i would like that
S0653	mhm
S0655	i know exactly what i'm go i think i'll try and design a front cover idea
S0653	mm
S0655	hmm
S0653	well terrify of a spider i expect
S0655	yeah but i want to do i think there's go to be a controller of the spiders the first victim
S0653	oh now be these spiders sort of genetically mutate or have they come from outer space or what's happen why be they like that why be they killer spiders
S0655	oh i think it should be in
S0654	huh i've get an idea
S0655	it start off in i'm a celebrity get me out of here although how about there be a meteor that land in there and then the spider and then there be one spider who erm get in radiation of the meteor and nearly get hit by it but fell in one of the hole
S0653	okay
S0655	and then when the meteor crash erm i know it's a bite of i know it's just a giant ball of erm ice so that but when it come down to earth the ice melt and it be rock
S0653	mm
S0655	and then er radiation from the meteor
S0653	mm
S0655	turn the spider and keep the spider the same size but it make it so it could take control over humans and stuff
S0653	mm
S0655	and then on i'm a celebrity get me out of here it get erm it do get capture to be eat
S0653	mm
S0655	and then it be drop and then it be swallow and then it be crawl and then
S0653	alright we've do that bite now hang on cos be almost burst with excitement
S0654	i've get an idea about the story
S0653	so okay you've get an idea about the story
S0654	how about the person eat the spider
S0653	mm
S0655	but then
S0655	they
S0654	when it come out they actually eat the spiders they they like i suppose the spiders burst out of this as well cos the spider and it give birth to load of spiders
S0655	yeah load of them
S0654	and then they crawl down the drain
S0653	right
S0654	and into their bed
S0653	oh my goodness this be horrible
S0654	and that night the spiders turn actually out to be tiny cute chickens
S0653	i don't want chicken in my bed
S0653	that would be my horror film
S0654	which turn out to be soft play toy
S0653	okay

S0655	staffies be basically wolves
S0653	mm mm wolves be nothing like that but those particular type of dog
S0655	yes staffies be vicious
S0653	and pitbulls be very aggressive but that's partly the breed of them they have be breed to be killers because we use to use them for hunt
S0655	hunt
S0653	like rat and things
S0654	ah poor mice
S0653	so you can't really blame it on the animals
S0655	don't blame it on the animals don't blame it on me cos i'm just staffie
S0653	cos dog be so it will have to be put down though
S0654	what uh
S0653	mm it'll have to be
S0655	no
S0653	it'll have to be kill cos it's a dangerous dog
S0654	actually i think they should be in zoos
S0653	well no darling we don't have dog in zoos if it's a dangerous animal if it have attack humans it be usually put down which be very sad and which be why it's actually awful isn't it when they attack but they just it just leap into the park and nobody know how it get there it do have an owner though so she's be arrest or charge or something but
S0654	but maybe she be walk with the lead and the dog kinda chew on the lead and run away
S0653	i don't know but it apparently it just snap it be sort of run around jump up and down and then it just turn on all the children
S0655	what be it act like a labrador
S0653	it be just sort of have they i think all the children be laugh and it be leap up and just yeah it wasn't er it wasn't do anything horrible at first and then it just go crazy

S0654	to get a
S0655	it could have be shoot with a erm it could have be shoot with something that make it vicious
S0653	no no no nothing happen like that it be just i think it be in the park with these children and something trigger whatever in its brain and make it crazy but yeah it's really shock isn't it
