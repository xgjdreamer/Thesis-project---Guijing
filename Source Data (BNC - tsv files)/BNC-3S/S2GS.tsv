S0057	she could have put her hand in the air rather than any er direction
S0179	i know
S0058	hello ha it really annoy me when people sort of give a really pathetic signal they sort of just do that to the side i'm like do a proper signal
S0179	there be actually a requisite signal in the highway code
S0058	oh be it an angle of arm
S0179	and it it's not sort of an optional extra go on
S0058	oh i know but like people who signal but they just kind of vaguely sort of flick their hand out in a sort of limp kind of way i'm like do a signal
S0179	well that's a lot of pedestrians
S0058	you wanna party there
S0057	yeah they look spanish
S0058	mm specifically spanish or just
S0057	well they didn't look french they didn't look italian

S0057	i think it's an excellent idea
S0058	no it's really good and it's really popular and they're all hang around in the youth centre with with their friends
S0057	not do any harm
S0058	not cause any problems probably have a reasonable time great brilliant it look like there's orange squash and biscuits as well you know what more could you want and a pool table
S0179	mm
S0058	great
S0057	and then they feel hardcore as well cos they're like hang out somewhere do you know what i mean there's kind of
S0058	well there's a lot of them stand outside the youth centre

S0179	oh yeah
S0058	i think i think you know it's just it really could
S0057	but the berlingo could manage the green polo could have manage
S0058	it's not that impressive we go the other day and it be just a bite like
S0057	but it's just the fact that yeah the little polo didn't make it well nearly didn't make it so now he doesn't want to take anything else up
S0058	just paranoia oh find out live really close to
