S0086	it's freeze super duper cold
S0085	yeah
S0086	basically get home from work yesterday and be go come round then cos i didn't go to the gym yesterday
S0085	oh right
S0086	get home and i make the mistake of get into bed
S0085	yeah
S0086	and then didn't move for the entire even ha be it good then smallville
S0085	i don't mind it
S0086	the girl i use to live with be absolutely obsess with it but i i just assume it be sort of a girly programme
S0085	no it's good anything with superman in it's go to be good
S0086	so be you look forward to the avengers that's not superman i know but it's all the rest isn't it
S0085	it's not superman no i think it be funny that all those different character have all make individual film
S0086	yeah
S0085	and then they think oh we can make some more money and then put the all in the same film
S0086	yeah basically i mean i don't know if there be originally a marvel comic of the avengers i presume there be
S0085	it's a it's quite a shock thing to do there be yeah yeah
S0086	and that's why they're do so it's not like they've just randomly pluck things out the air
S0085	but it's like they've get iron man that thor all the actual people that make the film the actors in it they all get them all together i think that be weird
S0086	i know it's good isn't it they didn't get new actors you mean
S0085	yeah
S0086	well i suppose it's continuity in a way isn't it
S0085	it be yeah it just surprise me that it come out so soon

S0083	yeah yeah now what happen erm i have every intention of do that reiki on monday but i sleep very badly i don't know why i keep wake up i mean i must have wake up i don't know four time em i mean i do go to sleep em but i keep wake up so i be tire but when i be asleep you know for the time i be asleep i must have sleep the last sort of bout of sleep i must have sleep awkwardly because when i get up not only be i very tire but i have backache
S0086	oh no
S0083	you know sometimes you sleep awkwardly sometimes you've get you know neck ache or sometimes you know if you be sleep on your arm your arm hurt for a while
S0086	yeah
S0083	em well i obviously sleep in an awkward position for my back and the last thing you want to do if you get backache be go on a
S0086	ten mile hike
S0083	well not ten but six
S0086	but even still
S0083	yeah so i didn't bother and i look i be say to i look at the meet office forecast yesterday i look i look at it for tomorrow think you know once i make my mind up i think well i'd better just check and see what wednesday be go to do and they say today it will be cold and less windy than yesterday and tomorrow it will be bright erm cloud over in the afternoon but when i look at it about ten minutes ago they say it's go to rain tomorrow
S0086	oh
S0083	so i'm really annoy now cos i the last thing i want to do be do a reiki in the rain so i don't know what to do i've just have to wait and see unless you really want the car i mean if you want the car take it but
S0086	no no no no i mean if you're not take it i'll do some food shop after work but you'll be back by then anyway
S0083	well trouble be i won't know whether i'm take or not until tomorrow morning cos i don't know whether it's go to rain
S0086	well this i mean and it's not a problem to me you know whether i go food shop tomorrow or thursday
S0083	yeah it's just it's just a nuisance really
S0086	it be a real annoyance it be a good job you didn't go walk yesterday though it be so cold
S0083	it be cold eh it be the wind i think you know if you've get if you're not feel all that good and it's a very cold wind eh you do actually feel very very bad when you're out walk cos there's nothing you can do to get warm
S0086	yeah
S0083	erm i i mean a cold wind be bad enough if you're feel fit because there's still nothing that you can do to keep warm but at least you don't feel too bad but if you're feel you know if you've get something wrong and it's very very windy and cold then you really do notice it so yeah i'm i'm please i didn't go but it's just i could do i could have do with the sort of weather we've have today tomorrow cos it's it's you know it's alright or walk in this weather
S0086	yeah yeah this weather's not very good
S0083	but the problem be you see i i'm do a reiki because last wednesday i go with to do the same reiki because there be two of us i be talk and i think well he's do it anyway i'm just come along you know keep him company but unfortunately when we get about i don't know half the way round he be in a bite of a state
S0086	oh really
S0083	not only have he get bad ankles
S0086	yeah
S0083	but he's also get the first stag of diabetes
S0086	oh have he oh gosh
S0083	well it happen to a lot of people when they get older and he's over seventy now so erm erm and
S0086	be that
S0083	and he be struggle a bite you know he bring stuff with him you know he bring glucose tablets and stuff to eat cos the thing you must do when when you erm have diabetes be have meals at the proper time
S0086	yeah
S0083	eh cos if you don't you keel over em but he be in a bite of a state really so i say well i i you know i'll either do it all you know for you he say no i i want to come along so i say well okay fine but you know i'll if you want to stop at any time when you do the walk i'll take over
S0086	okay
S0083	which mean that i've really get to know
S0086	know where you're go
S0083	cos a lot of you know as i say the first half of the walk i wasn't really take any notice and even the second half i wasn't i hadn't all think it through really i just say oh i'll do it for you and then i suddenly think when i get home actually i'd better make sure i know where i'm go i mean i've get it all write down erm but there's just a few place that i when i've look at my note i'm think do i actually remember where that be and so
S0086	and be that next monday be it
S0083	yeah so i've get i've get my own one on saturday that i'm lead
S0086	oh blimey
S0083	the one i've the one i've erm be
S0086	plan for a while
S0083	plan for for quite a while erm eh but i wouldn't come on that one if i be you because
S0086	really because i be go to
S0083	well you can you can but there's not there's no facilities anywhere see what i like to do be find somewhere we have a pub half way round there be a pub half way round but it's close well not close it's not open till
S0086	right yeah oh it doesn't open during the day
S0083	it's not open during the day which be a nuisance i think well on a saturday i think it's bind to be open but it's not erm and i've get one come up in april that i'm lead
S0086	oh okay yeah
S0083	so that might be a better one there will definitely be somewhere to you know stop off go use the loos and all that stuff
S0086	yeah
S0083	so it might be better to wait until april actually erm i'm slightly annoy with i mean the walk i'm do on saturday come out of the book not not one of our book but the group and they say that there be two pubs on the route erm but of course erm pubs close so so erm one be close and one get fire damage i think
S0086	right mm oh no
S0083	so and it's one of these funny walk that erm when you sort of get to sort of place where you can have you know in term of time em there's nothing there so i'm hop it's go to be a a mildish day i mean when i do the last reiki it be great i mean a couple of weeks ago er we have a sort of a mild period and it be dry and it be great cos i just sit under a tree and eat eat my sandwich but of course if it's if it's pour with rain or blow a gale it's the last thing you want really
S0086	ah nice yeah yeah absolutely yeah it's that just unpredictability of the good old british weather i suppose you're all quite hardy i mean no one want to walk in the rain but at least you're all quite prepare for it
S0083	yeah yeah oh yeah i mean well you do get a cross section of people that you know particularly in spring time when people start think oh i'd better do something like last year i mean this one's a bite earlier than the one last year one be at the end of march last year whereas this one be the tenth but i still think we're go to get people that come out think oh you know
S0086	mm mm spring's in the air
S0083	i'll eh i'll do more i'll do more yeah
S0086	although this week have be cold you know like you be say last week or the week before it be quite mild wasn't it
S0083	yeah i'm hop that might put people off for a bite cos it you know it's because i because i couldn't do a reiki before christmas and then we have all that cold weather in february it's all catch me off guard this thing really
S0086	mm
S0083	and it's slightly annoy cos i like my walk to be good you know i i like i like i like to feel myself that i've actually give them their money's worth even though they're they're not they're not pay anything erm but i i just feel this walk be a bite of a not quite what i want it to be
S0086	be the route nice though
S0083	no erm
S0086	right
S0083	well it's it's not actually as such but it's go on to be it's lord estate so you remember i tell you
S0086	oh yeah
S0083	lord
S0086	hasn't he get thirty two thousand acres or something
S0083	i've i've obviously choose a few acres that be not too interest i mean there's some woodland there erm i mean if this pub have be open it would've be much it would have actually make it a decent sort of walk because you know alright you get there quite quickly and you know like and if it be open i might have find the detour or something so we didn't get there before twelve thirty but but erm erm it's not go to be so there's no point in add extra i don't think there be any extra
S0086	well especially if there be no facilities at all you kind of want to have a shorter walk don't you you don't want to be go all day if there's nowhere to you know have comfort break
S0083	no absolutely well that's that's what i be think so what i don't know be whether i phone the woman in the pub and she say they're not open i presume that all the erm you know loos and things be lock up some of these old country pubs have their loos out the back so i mean a lot of them don't these days cos you've get restaurants they're all inside
S0086	yeah it would make sense to
S0083	erm so it will all be lock up it's just such a nuisance all out in the open
S0086	no
S0083	it's just a nuisance that's all
S0086	yum i love dinner
S0083	i'll put this light on so we can see what we're do
S0086	can i have that water please it's for me rather than dad thank you yum mm mm mm
S0083	how's work busy at the moment
S0086	it's good yeah it's really busy do i tell you that my boss be go to new york
S0083	yeah mm
S0086	so friday be her last day
S0083	mm
S0086	so i've already take over a couple of her project it's start to get busy with my own so but that's fine i like it to be busy it's better that way
S0083	yeah time go quicker
S0086	mm yeah and it's nice to feel involve so yeah it's go it's go okay i still quite like it i don't know it's difficult to know really it seem quite an excite time to work at the press cos it's everything's sort of change
S0083	yes
S0086	mm
S0083	i've get another eh update from uncle oh the story
S0086	oh yeah be that just him rewrite or be it on the advice of others
S0083	no i think it be have a look at it and he's and he's alter a few things
S0086	oh okay i'll have to have a look
S0083	i say to him i'd have a look and i haven't get round to it yet
S0086	mm
S0083	i'm gonna i'm gonna print i can't remember how many page be it seventy page someone say
S0086	yeah it's long
S0083	mm
S0086	i can do it at work and bring you round a copy if you email me the latest version save your print paper
S0083	yeah i be think of have a look as well
S0085	no good
S0083	no have you read it
S0085	no i didn't mean it's no good i mean i'm not good i don't read book so i'm not go to be able to say
S0086	i be gonna say that's quite harsh
S0085	yeah i didn't mean that
S0086	no good that's the official critic
S0085	i'm sure it's very good but i'm just say that i know nothing about things like that
S0083	don't forget it's write from the point of view of somebody that make film and you watch a lot of film so
S0085	yeah but i think most film be rubbish
S0086	ah you can always read the first page and see how you go it might really grip you
S0083	mm yeah
S0086	yeah i'm definitely go to have to get round to that
S0085	i just mean my my opinion's not worth anything
S0083	why not
S0085	cos i don't read
S0083	but that's not but it's it's whether it the story appeal to you on the as i say on the basis that it start off as an idea for a film
S0085	yeah but stories that appeal to a lot of other people don't appeal to me so it's not if you say well this this thing doesn't appeal to me that's no indication of anything because nothing appeal to me i wouldn't go change it think oh this isn't appeal like
S0083	mm
S0085	you still get echo on it
S0086	yeah it's rubbish but vodaphone be get a new one to me
S0085	get a new one
S0086	yeah
S0085	let me keep that one
S0086	you have to give it back sadly
S0085	damn
S0083	it's get echo nobody will be able to hear what well that that actually they can hear themselves but they can't hear you that's the problem you can hear the echo but you can't
S0086	and you can't hear me
S0083	well when the last time i speak to you i couldn't hear you at all
S0086	oh yeah you just yeah that be a bite of a
S0083	i could just hear the echo and the strange thing be i think i have a cross line because i didn't realise that my voice be so much like uncle 's i just sound like i be speak to uncle
S0086	really
S0083	but unless he be repeat exactly the same the word that i be use it be actually my voice
S0086	how funny it use to be i think you know obviously it's a family thing but i know when erm people use to call me at the cos before mobile phone or if if use use to answer if mum answer they would start speak to them as if it be me cos we always sound the same on the phone
S0083	well i'm i'm get so bad at at recognise people's voice that the other day when i phone after this you know sort of i when he have a rather nasty turn after we do the reiki i phone him that even actually to make sure he be okay and his wife answer the phone his wife's call but she's get quite a deep voice for a woman and i think it be him cos he hasn't get a high voice for a man but sometimes his voice sound a bite high pitch occasionally
S0086	okay
S0083	so i'm terrible at the moment well probably from now on
S0086	i'm tire with the phone now that i've be record all the conversations and play them back i can hear my own voice cos you have to fill in an accompany record sheet that say that give the first line of what people say and what be discuss you know like a brief overview and i can hear my voice and i just think it sound so common
S0083	right our voice never sound the way we think it sound
S0086	most people say that no it's funny isn't it
S0085	that's why it's best not to record yourself
S0086	well no one's go to hear it really in fact no one be go to hear it apart from the person
S0085	no but i i wouldn't want to listen to myself back i wouldn't enjoy that at all
S0086	i find it hilarious cos i sit in the office fill in this sheet before i submit it and i find myself giggle away i think i'm quite funny i have to leave one of them the other day cos mum be tell me all about you know her friend
S0083	yes
S0086	all about his new story
S0083	oh right
S0086	but it's all a bite hush hush so i have to delete it
S0083	yeah under wrap yeah
S0086	mm she suddenly realise i be record it she be like quick delete it delete it
S0085	yeah but what's go to happen someone at your work be go to steal his idea or something
S0086	well yeah no it's just at that early stage where they don't anything it's all a bite
S0083	mm
S0086	oh yum yum yum mm so when be erm be it the woman from the church who's do the the bach recital or the woman from the shop
S0083	the shop she's in the choir
S0086	the whatever it be
S0083	yeah i think i might get ticket but i keep forget to look on the website i don't like buy ticket on the website i'm hop you can buy them there because cos it's it's call the concert hall
S0086	well you could always give them a ring and see if you can pop by one one day or pay for i over the phone and go and collect them
S0083	that's what i don't that's what i don't like do it
S0086	you don't want to do it over the phone either okay
S0083	i don't trust it
S0086	mm
S0083	i don't trust machine with my detail and i certainly don't people with it
S0086	right good
S0085	you're more likely to have someone steal your detail in person
S0086	mm yeah
S0085	than over the phone or the internet
S0086	no you're not be you
S0083	well you're more likely to have someone steal your detail over the phone rather than
S0085	you be apparently statistically more people will steal you detail in person than over the phone
S0083	how can they do that
S0086	how be that possible if you go it to a bank
S0085	happen to mum
S0083	oh yeah i see what you mean yeah if you give your card
S0085	people will take them in shop in restaurants
S0086	yeah but that's why you can't let your card out of your sight
S0083	you should never let it out of your sight yeah
S0085	yeah yeah but what what the point i be try to make be you would think oh it's much safer if it's with me whereas a lot of the time unless you're careful it's less safe
S0083	yes you must never let it out of your sight whatever they say
S0085	cos the internet be be pretty safe if you use the right sit
S0086	you just have you just have to be a bite savvy
S0085	mm
S0083	yeah i think it's the that that's the point use the right sit
S0086	it's be secure whatever you're do
S0085	and if if you buy stuff from amazon even though i don't like do it i'm sure it's probably one of the safest sit that you can use
S0086	oh it absolutely be yeah
S0083	because em all their
S0086	billions of people use it every day
S0083	all all the security they have i mean if they get a bad name people people be you know have their information duplicate
S0086	yeah
S0083	amazon would go out of business
S0086	absolutely i do write a really strongly word email today i request my credit rat a couple of weeks ago because i want to speak to hsbc about get an overdraft it's all a bite by the by now because i've be do these record it's go to help me pay off the little debt that i have so i'm go to be okay
S0083	yeah
S0085	what they pay you to do it
S0086	yeah
S0085	nice where's our cut then
S0086	i'll bring you round some biscuits
S0085	nice
S0086	yeah erm but i request it and it didn't didn't make any sense and there's no phone number that you can call you have to email or write a letter
S0083	i know it's it's awful isn't it
S0086	yeah so that be about two months ago and they've just finally send me and email say what be your query no we can't call you back and i say it's absolutely ridiculous i just want them to explain because on your credit rat they give you like a status history of reach of the account that you've ever have credit with and i've never have a credit card but i have have erm mobile phone account and once i have a new look card when i work in new look and obviously that's all pay off vodaphone be on go and there's a series of number next to your status history but it doesn't tell you what the number denote so then i couldn't understand erm and i i can't find it anywhere and they just the detail they give you of vodaphone erm be just some p o box somewhere so you don't feel confident that if you've contact the they would even know
S0083	there's erm there's something on the internet i can't think of the name now which give you your credit sort of history and credit rat
S0086	yeah it's your credit money credit experts
S0083	be it apperion apperion or something
S0086	experian
S0083	experian
S0086	that's who i go with so experian actually have sell on the that that on to the credit expert it's all sort of link
S0083	oh right mm
S0086	so you can you don't have to set up and account with them you can just request it for two pound which be what i do but then you're not give any sort of support whereas if you go through with a credit expert you have to pay a monthly fee but they explain everything to you and it i think it probably be a bite more detail but erm
S0083	more yeah it depend on how a on the one hand necessary
S0086	exactly
S0083	or if it's not necessary how eager you be to find out about your credit history cos
S0086	they say that you should do it every year don't they
S0083	well yeah
S0086	but it be more because before i go travel i apply for a credit card and be decline and i want to know why that be because there's obviously something on there that's a problem i want to check that before i apply for anything with hsbc to help me clear my overdraft but as i say that probably shouldn't be an issue now
S0083	alright good that's good so have you get your bike back
S0086	no
S0083	oh right it's still there
S0086	they have to order in the fork
S0083	and they're wait for them to come in be they
S0086	yeah so i've still get the courtesy bike which be a nightmare not have any gear
S0083	no it's very hard work go anywhere isn't it when you've only get one have say that i be gonna i might have mention this before so forgive name but i'll say it again just in case i didn't when i work in the city now and again i use to see couriers there weren't many people at the time i work in the city who ride bicycle but own and again you'd see a a bicycle courier like you get a motorcycle courier or or a car courier and then place where there's lot of traffic you know motor eh motor sorry say that again cycle couriers make more sense because they can zip in and out and erm because i'm interest in bicycle when i first notice them cos they often have bag on their back say you know x y z courier company or x y z bike courier or something erm because i'm interest in bike i sort of notice them and i notice the bike that they be rid this be i don't know ten years plus ago and they be all erm the sort of light weight bike with lot of gear as you would expect erm but suddenly erm probably a couple of years before i retire so about erm what be that about nine years ago erm i notice that they'd all go on to single gear bike erm and instead of be sort of the handle bar that drop down they be they be flat but instead of be the handle you know i mean normally when you're on a bike unless it's a erm a fold away bike which be often smaller and and get less space erm but normally a straight handlebars be there aren't they you know about the width of your shoulder or maybe wider whereas these be much you know they be straight but they be much narrower and they have this erm single cog and it be almost as if the courier industry have suddenly make a a decision for the whole of itself because from that moment on and probably it's because i hadn't take notice i mean i don't go and look at bike all the time every time i saw a courier cyclist after that they all seem to i think all of them i don't think i see saw another one with lot of gear they all seem to have these single gear and what i notice after a while be that they're all what's call fix wheel in other word you know when you just think oh i'll stop peddle now so you stop peddle well that's because you've get a free wheel bike whether it's get twenty seven gear or whether it's get one gear if you can stop peddle it's a free wheel a fix wheel mean that the cog at the back be fix to the wheel erm in in the way i mean they they're all fix to the wheel eh anyway but fix to the wheel in in the sense that it won't eh allow you to stop peddle okay and the reason people have them be because although they're a nightmare to get go cos they us very small cog at the back and very big chain reel at the front although you've get to really and you see these guy you know really fit guy really sort of have to do all this once you get go erm the fact that the peddle come it's almost as if once you get go both you and the bike be take the strain of it because the pedal be come up without you push it down because the momentum of the bicycle be push the pedal round but the thing be you can't stop peddle because if it do if you do it throw you off you know
S0086	oh my god
S0083	well because it's go on that all the time you know because if you suddenly oh i've have enough of this and and suddenly you know your your leg will come up when you're not expect it to
S0086	sound very dangerous very strange idea
S0083	i mean they've have them for years i mean when bike be first invent that's all they be because em if you think of the penny farthing which be one of the first bike i mean apart from the ones that they just have wheel and scoot along but erm the first proper bike be a penny farthing i should think and if you think about it it have this huge wheel on the front with pedal fix you know little pedal fix to the wheel so therefore you have to keep peddle because if you stop peddle the pedal keep go and the same thing happen it would throw you off so originally all bike as far as i'm aware be fix wheel and then you know somebody come up with the idea of put ball bear in and what the ball bear do be that they go they fit them all the way round the cog at the back
S0086	yeah
S0083	which mean that em eh once you stop peddle the wheel keep go round back wheel keep go round but the cog stay still because the ball bear in the centre be spin round okay
S0086	right
S0083	and then when you pedal again em it pick up the momentum well fix wheel don't have those ball bear in the centre eh they just have eh a fix cog em so yeah i i just the whole point of that story be that suddenly when i notice one of these em bike with only one cog eh for couriers i didn't see any others every time i saw a courier they have one of these bike and now that what be that seven years no longer nine years ago erm again if i go to the city of london it's all the same they're all they're all rid bike with narrow straight handle bar and erm and and fix wheel on them i mean some have get drop handle bar but the majority of them have get narrow straight handle bar
S0086	like my bike
S0083	like yours yeah but narrower than yours
S0086	but narrower yeah i don't like the sound of it to be honest i think it sound quite dangerous because if you if you're slow down for example if you're come up to traffic light or something
S0083	well that's the other thing you don't need a back break
S0086	okay yeah
S0083	you only need one break
S0086	yeah and that be dangerous have
S0083	because you you can control the back wheel by peddle slower i mean you can't stop peddle
S0086	no
S0083	straight away i mean you can eventually obviously because you can come to a stand still
S0086	but you have to slow yourself
S0083	but when the bike move the peddle move because the chain be drive it because the the cog on the back be fix
S0086	mm
S0083	em so if you if you you know cos you need to be sort of a healthy sort of you know eh guy if you decide you're go to stop eh you know in twenty yards time you just slow down the rate of peddle and apply the front break
S0086	okay
S0083	but it be you get to i mean it be for people that really know what they're do and it's really i i wouldn't like one
S0086	mm and you'd have to be careful change from a free wheel to a fix because you you'd forget
S0083	you can get yourself into a you can get yourself into a lot of trouble if you're not careful
S0086	yeah it would throw you off
S0083	yeah
S0086	i don't know why
S0083	i mean in in you know i mean be throw off along a country lane be one thing you might do yourself a lot of damage but eh the chance of you be run over be pretty slim but
S0086	get run over
S0083	but you know be throw off in the city of london be probably certain death i should think
S0086	absolutely
S0083	there's cars everywhere
S0086	i couldn't imagine anything more scary well no that's no true obviously but it's so scary cycle in london although i'd never do it
S0083	oh it be cos there be very few lanes and cars be not use to see cyclists and they just ignore them really i mean they never look for cyclists
S0086	never look no
S0083	and it's always not always but the majority of i mean the i can't remember now how many people get kill in london every year who be rid bike but it's a huge amount
S0086	it's a lot actually
S0083	and invariably it's because eh the driver of the usually lorry eh hasn't see the cyclist cos you know the cyclist be too close or too near or he's one the wrong side
S0086	they never check their wing mirror
S0083	well if they do they erm you know the wing mirror only show the the eh erm view erm eh that's that's behind them well a lot of that view if you look in the mirror be go to be the lorry itself you know because the lorry's be very long erm and so therefore if you want to be seem you've get to be one side you know quite distinctly one side or the other side or miles behind it so that that driver can see you behind the back of his lorry
S0086	yeah absolutely
S0083	erm erm but it's things like roundabouts where eh lorries can't see you and sometimes you know a cyclist can be go around a roundabout if if a cyclist have come out of a cycle lane and a car will just whizz you know how quickly cars go round roundabouts a car will just whizz round and knock the cyclist off because he's just go too fast and that's often what happen you know people people get kill on roundabouts quite a lot
S0086	scary isn't it i mean cyclist don't necessarily help themselves you know with the the cyclist who die recently be squash by a lorry because they be turn leave at traffic light the cyclist creep up the side erm while the light be on red and the lorry didn't look and the cyclist be too close and she die because she be too close and you think actually that's in in you know you know to always check your wing mirror all the time especially when you're take a corner because you just don't know
S0083	or if you're a cyclist you have to assume that the lorry be not go to therefore stay behind it don't don't get up the side of it
S0086	exactly cos it might cos lot of people actually you know rubbish drivers they will not indicate until it's green so they won't sit there with their indicators on
S0083	no absolutely
S0086	they'll indicate when they can move
S0083	or not at all
S0083	yeah or not at all
S0083	erm but the other thing eh that happen be erm that a cyclist will come up to a lorry wait at the light and will think ah i'll get a long the inside and the difficulty of the cyclist be know when the light be go to change i mean if the light's red it might have be red for a second or it might have be red for five well not five minutes but it might have be red for a minute
S0086	couple of minutes yeah
S0083	so if you're if you're go along the side and suddenly they turn green and a lorry move that's it you're go to get squash
S0083	yeah yeah absolutely
S0083	so it's always better to hold back
S0086	yeah i mean i do
S0083	unless unless you can unless you can see you know that the light have just change
S0086	just literally yeah literally change
S0083	you know literally change to red so you can get down there before and get in front of the lorry so that the lorry driver can see you rather than up the side of it
S0086	you just yeah exactly yeah you just wouldn't take the risk would you
S0083	no no
S0086	it's too dangerous
S0083	it's far too dangerous no and it and the other thing be you know driver's a careless they don't look they don't signal erm they
S0086	mm just so much traffic mm you'd think in this day and age you know post erm the july bomb there's be a massive surge of people on bike in london hasn't there because people didn't want to take the tube you think give that give that there be so many more bike on the road not like but still there's a lot of them you'd think that people would be more aware of them but i guess that's change their mind that they're not expect to see lot of cyclists
S0083	and and drivers be in a hurry
S0086	and there's just so much traffic
S0083	yeah drivers be in a hurry they're you know they it's usually a rush hour accident isn't it you know they're they're either go to work or come home from work the driver either want to get there or get home he's not think he's just think about get home and eh do all the things he normally do in relation to other motor vehicles but forget to take the extra care for someone that's on two wheel so yeah i mean it's just i mean i as i say to you when we speak about this before really if we're go to cure this problem we need to do what holland you know the netherlands do twenty thirty years ago and just change all the laws and put in cycle lanes everywhere eh and make it clear that drivers will lose their license immediately you know that if if a cyclist be injure the the driver will lose his license if it's prove that the cyclist eh you know cause the accident or there be you know some doubt or whatever then obviously the license may come back but unless you're really strict with drivers all this will still go on because they just don't care most a lot of them don't care you know and particularly bus drivers don't seem to care at all
S0086	and taxi drivers
S0083	so again with bus drivers the thing to do because they rely on it for their live be you know make them forfeit their licence
S0086	absolutely
S0083	cos then they wouldn't wouldn't be able to drive but erm unless something like that happen then and and it won't because you know this country they won't spend any money do things like that
S0086	no way
S0083	then the and people will complain about it isn't it terrible but nothing will happen i mean the cycle campaign have do a lot of good work but that's because have always have a lot of cycle in the city you know from the undergraduates and the workforce you know in the in the nineteen well up until the nineteen sixties and seventies you know workers cycle cos they couldn't afford cars or they walk erm and eh students erm do the same cos students didn't have cars in those days very few of them do so you know and all university cities have keep the cycle as be a prime use of of you know a prime type of transport but in other cities since the nineteen sixties and seventies where there's people who have move up form walk or cycle to cars
S0086	yeah
S0083	they don't have the same erm understand about cyclists
S0086	yeah it's a worry
S0083	so yeah so it be i mean it be dangerous even in but it's far more dangerous in other cities far more
S0086	mm yeah where motorists just aren't expect to see cyclists
S0083	yeah very very dangerous
S0086	mm
S0083	so not worth it anyway have a seat over there i'm go to sit over here for a while
S0086	well no you sit on that chair dad
S0083	no no i'm go to sit on eh this chair cos eh otherwise if i sit in front of the television i tend to doze off so
