S0653	mm mm step on the bike when you be on the bike
S0654	yeah we be like this
S0653	no can you sit down come on
S0654	and erm

S0654	no
S0653	okay
S0654	that be on and
S0653	but you do that okay
S0654	and then it be after that we do the tiny mouse step it be and then we be try to and then for a challenge we be try to see how they they make us try to see how far we could go lift our legs up erm that's and then i go downwards and i be quite good at that and there's a bite of a slope down the playground it go like this and we still don't want to and then when we go upwards on the slope kind of bite i fell off
S0653	ah mm right mm good mm mm oh dear

S0655	the whole playground be slop
S0653	you must don't tap that there you must
S0655	it go like that
S0653	listen people that be successful get successful because they've try hard and they've fail at something and then they've carry on and work hard and succeed so that's what you be do
S0654	and when i fell over i just get on er they ask me if i be okay and i say i think so and i carry on
S0653	oh baby brilliant

S0655	because of you
S0653	mm i guess so
S0655	i would think so too
S0653	mm there could have be other question which would have be more of a challenge but all of these students be work in english as a second language so it be very difficult for them
S0655	so they need to like so they actually need to know how to read the question
S0653	sit down please well they it's not just read the question they need to understand them and be able to answer in in a lot of detail
S0655	be it like add and subtract and time and divide or
S0653	no it's an english thing
S0655	oh
S0653	i teach english don't i
S0655	mm

S0654	i know
S0653	be you not go to ask her
S0654	i'll ask her tomorrow
S0653	because that would be a sad thing wouldn't it i mean you can still play together outside of school but it would just be a bite more difficult to arrange won't it be you look forward to do your history experience on saturday the ottoman empire i don't know very much about the ottoman empire so you'll be able to tell me lot and lot erm 's mum message me she say i well she initially say doesn't mind come to ours or you come to his on saturday but i say let the boys talk about it tomorrow
S0655	i really really want to go to his house
S0653	yeah but you be not go you be not go to go to his house because you haven't be invite because this be a thing but it may be i don't know their house be don't keep tap their house be a bite of a build site they haven't get a roof at the moment you know they actually have no roof
S0655	what if it rain
S0653	they've get a plastic sheet over it now
S0654	mm
S0655	what if it thunder what if a lightning bolt strike the roof
S0653	well i think we'd all be in trouble if that that happen but yeah amaze isn't it but they the lady that use to own the house be very old and so didn't really couldn't really look after the property for the last sort of ten years or so they need a new roof and a new lot of new things electricity kind of new wire and things like
S0655	what be we do
S0653	well for 's mum because they be all i think it it be very cold when they go in there for a while and they be all sleep in the same room for a bite it's just it's always this sort of thing that happen when it's not very nice weather like lot of people's boilers seem to need fix and that kind of thing in winter it never happen in the summer because it wouldn't be too bad to have no roof in the summer would it but this be it be still winterish
S0655	it wouldn't be bad at all
S0653	well it depend if it be like a roast hot day it would be okay wouldn't it but this be although it's spring it's still very icy outside
S0655	mm mum
S0653	mm
S0655	in the summer i don't think i'm actually go to need a blanket
S0653	no well that's why you still have your baby blanket so they're the lightest blanket you can have the thing be i don't ever sleep well in the summer because i like to have a quilt i like to be all snuggly and i find it very difficult to sleep without one even if it's really hot i still try and have a quilt
S0655	me to although i cannot sleep with a quilt in the summer
S0653	no we've get like we've get an autumn quilt and a spring quilt which we put a summer quilt which we put together to make a winter one but even that be still but then we didn't really have a very hot summer last year do we not really we have like a weekend when it be boil and that be it
S0654	freeze you should have go to spain it be so hot
S0653	well i yeah i i mean it's alright be in a hot country if you be next to water isn't it
S0654	there be hardly any water
S0653	no i mean swim pool
S0654	yeah
S0653	you can keep cool that way
S0655	i be normally next to water
S0653	sorry
S0655	i be normally next to water and if not i'd probably be inside water
S0653	mm
S0654	er mama i saw this like thing on another house it be like a pool with a waterfall go into another bite and erm you could get out the other bite to the so if you like fell down that bite you couldn't get out yeah because the waterfall be go down
S0653	oh wow oh really into a swim pool
S0654	into a pool
S0653	into a pool that seem be it mean for people to go in there
S0654	i don't know
S0653	that seem a bite of a silly design
S0654	because i saw a house across
S0653	how nice be it a man make waterfall presumably someone build it
S0654	yeah it be basically like erm tower it be basically like a a waterfall like you've get at legoland that you slide down
S0653	like the one in legoland ah
S0654	it just go down down down down down
S0653	okay but in someone's house that's pretty cool
S0654	outside
S0653	well yes that would be less cool inside i think
S0655	mum
S0653	yes
S0654	you be allow two
S0655	why do people die if they fall down a waterfall
S0653	well they don't necessarily die but it's a long way to fall so they tend to hit their head on something
S0654	yeah and it have erm the and it have rapids you be basically like have really
S0655	no the rapids be before the waterfall
S0653	the rapids be before the waterfall it it tend to have jaggedy rock at the bottom so it's the fall i mean actually the force of water can break your arm on its own when it's very strong but it's that long drop and then for hit something even the water because dive people when they go dive you can break an arm you know when you be do five metre dive people do can easily break things sort of at the ten metre mark so it's hit the force of the water badly
S0655	i may have like erm i nearly break my arm when i fell when i do a face plant into the water from the three metre
S0653	well you didn't nearly break your arm but it do hurt doesn't it
S0655	yeah a huge amount
S0653	it do hurt yes it's surprise how much get land in the water badly can really hurt
S0655	yeah but if you point your feet and you land down straight as long as there's no jaggedy rock at the bottom and it's quite and it's deep enough then you will survive
S0653	but the problem with a waterfall be that that you know you be in water you be not leap into water you be in water already and it's push you around and you probably don't know where you be go you can't see anything so you can't right yourself and get yourself into a position
S0655	i'd be like you might have actually miss the water and might be fly
S0653	you might do but i just think it's very dangerous and they they can be very big drop can't they
S0655	yeah
S0653	very big but you know if you can you can be lucky
S0655	in my it can't be true in my it can't be true book there's a gigantic waterfall that be like much taller than er which be taller than about five lean tower of pisa's
S0653	uhu wow really where's that then
S0655	i don't know shall i get it
S0653	not yet i wonder if it's in america like the amazon or something
S0654	or or japan
S0653	i think japan have
S0654	mum do you know what a boy call in year one he tell us his dad be scratch by a lion
S0653	mm i doubt that's true
S0654	yeah and he and say oh be it in japanee japanee jan janpan which isn't a real country she's just make it up and say yes
S0653	mm
S0655	janpan
S0653	oh but he's only in year one
S0654	and i'm sorry to tell you that but it be not a real country
S0653	and what do he say
S0654	he be like it be
S0653	oh oh he be obviously try to impress you with a tale

S0653	that's very sweet
S0654	and erm i and then the cat come and er people
S0653	the school cat
S0654	yeah and load of people want to stroke it but i think no you don't know where it's be and it might not like children because once it scratch

S0655	well it doesn't it doesn't even belong to the school
S0653	no it just kind of trot in do you know it be national cat day in japan yesterday because they love cat so they be celebrate everything to do with cat yesterday

S0654	once in year two at one time in year two the cat we be in the ict suite and the cat as there
S0653	yes right in the ict suite that's very cheeky
S0655	well the door be open

S0654	but you be scar to death
