S0278	and they be laugh in there
S0013	so you've get the money already
S0278	no i haven't need to get it
S0013	mm
S0278	erm never have a dog in here injure because he fell of a bridge he do
S0013	
S0278	you know these wooden plank go round the ditch
S0012	yeah yeah
S0278	i be stand on one and i whistle him and he try to get past me and his leave foot go and he go straight upside down in the ditch
S0013	oh
S0278	and all the brambles and the
S0013	oh dear
S0278	and then he he get himself up straight ever so quick must've be a big effort but then he run out through all the rubbish
S0013	mm
S0278	i think that's how his eye go funny further round the walk he go down a ditch look for water and it be empty one where he normally go down and have a drink so there be a slope down which be probably use he go off that way and then he try to get out a bite which be almost vertical and er he do get out about his fourth go
S0013	mm
S0278	but that must've be a big effort for him just you know
S0013	yeah
S0012	mm
S0278	so that may have pop a muscle or a they think it's a nerve in the end that's that's break
S0013	mm
S0278	cos the nerve control that eyelid
S0012	mm
S0013	mm
S0278	he doesn't he can't do it it's it's there's a nerve that
S0012	yeah
S0013	no
S0278	that do the inner eyelid so it's still over his eye but he's not bother he's not he's not
S0012	mm
S0013	no mm
S0012	one there
S0013	i've get
S0278	mm right mm i think these be gonna work aren't they these little slotty things
S0012	hopefully yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	gonna slot in
S0278	mm
S0012	yeah
S0278	mm mm leave a little for a little flaggy flaggy thing i've get that's go up that i tell you it's gonna say please show your badge
S0012	mm
S0278	put it on both side there be a lot of trouble last year with people be in there with no badge er and we saw one lot er a big lot ten you know
S0013	yeah
S0278	young farmers one of them collect up all their badge go out and he come in with another load of people keep use the badge to get people in now if you can't leave without a badge or they've notice there's a sign say you can't leave without a badge badge must be
S0013	what what be we talk about
S0278	well the members' badge at the show
S0013	right
S0278	they're for one person who you know if you're up to the age of thirty you pay your age
S0012	mm
S0278	so if you're thirty you pay your age over thirty it's forty five pound for adults
S0013	oh i see
S0278	so say you're eighteen and er consider yourself an adult you pay eighteen pound
S0012	mm
S0278	which actually be quite
S0013	so if you're twenty nine you pay twenty nine pound
S0278	you pay your age
S0013	different way of do it
S0278	clever way isn't it see erm but then an adult be forty five pound
S0012	mm
S0278	and the family be the family's seventy five i think erm but it's it's it's quite oh no no couple be seventy five
S0013	but there will be lot of people say they're only twenty eight twenty nine won't there
S0278	no but the main thing be the point be that the the customs and excise do come round there be people that just go round the show and
S0012	mm
S0278	the place be license for a certain number and the certain number be control by the number of badge
S0013	right
S0012	mm
S0278	so we can't go over the number so for the license laws of alcohol
S0012	well when they leave
S0012	why don't you stamp the hand
S0278	alright he hasn't he hasn't get a badge you stamp his hand now he can get in and out without a badge
S0012	no he's gotta have his badge on when he come back in but if you've stamp his hand you know he's go out
S0278	no when he go out he's gotta have his badge i it happen to me at the show i think this be weird why be they ask for my badge again i they know i've get a badge i'm in here
S0012	yeah
S0278	they're ask because people will collect collect them up and go and fetch other people in you see
S0013	right
S0278	so that and i realise what have be go on and this might've be go on at show see when the weather's bad
S0013	mm
S0278	don't wear the badge on the outside they're only cardboard they haven't get
S0012	yeah
S0278	so they wear them underneath but we still need to see them
S0013	right
S0278	when they're in they need to have them visible
S0013	but you can hand your badge onto someone else can't you
S0278	if you if you're not in there yes
S0013	mm
S0278	if you're stay out fine it doesn't you can but it's just control the number
S0013	mm
S0278	that doesn't matter but everybody in there have get to be i've change the sign to say erm er members' badge must be visibly wear to comply with the license laws
S0013	right
S0278	and i'm now gonna make a sign that say the no badge naughty pen and put it on a fence erm just for a laugh and erm there's so it's it's quite obvious but we we do we do have a lot of trouble hassle with it
S0013	mm
S0278	oh but er little johnny doesn't need a badge well he look over five to me can he please go and get one you see cos over five be a child there's child badge as well
S0013	mm right sound a bite complicate
S0278	it isn't it isn't really there's just young adult adult couple family and a vice president which pay a hundred and five pound
S0013	mm
S0278	just cos they wanna seem posh erm and so that that's it but a child start at five
S0013	yeah
S0278	but you know they say oh but he doesn't need one he's a child yeah well he look he look over five to me you can get you know it's quite obvious when when someone's one's over five

S0013	bite weird isn't it
S0278	well they want the thing be there's no
S0013	i think children should be a children price and
S0278	well when when do you stop be what they've do be because you know they want to attract more young farmers cos when when we off the top the place be run by a load of old fogies like me

S0012	yeah
S0013	right
S0278	you see erm and then as they get older and older it's very fair then they get to thirty that's fine then over thirty it's forty five and it's up to them to be honest about it

S0278	mm
S0013	that she she would quite happy to think we be all
S0013	yeah
S0278	mm
S0013	which be a great compliment of the day
S0012	yeah
S0278	mm mm it be isn't it granny
S0013	i wasn't granny then
S0013	oh but
S0278	yeah but we get i think we get it right this time it'll work just hope it do well the the only other thing be you see one lot quite visibly hand badge over the fence well the only way to stop that which have it they have a fence inside they have a hedge for the entrance
S0012	mm
S0278	the
S0013	mm
S0278	they have another barrier round behind the hedge and that's probably cos they'd have the same problem
S0012	mm
S0278	people hand it over the hedge
S0013	yeah
S0278	they get somebody else to come
S0013	i don't know how you you stop that really
S0278	well i have to and i think i'll make a little i'm gonna make some little postcards size little things you know erm so i'm gonna get feed up with where they're not wear badge and point to it
S0012	mm
S0278	you know or just hold it up you know
S0013	mm
S0278	otherwise we'll be in trouble i'll put something like that please badge
S0013	you're take it on yourself to do this
S0278	i be
S0013	oh be you
S0278	i that's my responsibility be the whole of the members whatever the food the bar
S0012	be it
S0278	that's the trouble and but she's oh she's good she won't she doesn't care what she say to anybody she's quite a fiery youngster
S0013	oh
S0278	be erm and if she say she's gonna do something she'll jolly well do it someone complain about cos the other thing i'm look at i be responsible for all the cater outside that that run smoothly
S0013	mm
S0278	that people don't walk around not suppose to walk around with alcohol one year
S0013	mm
S0278	we get we think why be all these people walk round drink juice look like juice cartons you know it be cider some place be sell cider so we have to put a stop to that and people be walk round drink it the the other areas where they sell alcohol it's only the immediate area that they can drink it
S0012	mm
S0278	but how do you stop people you just say look you're you're suppose to stay where you be we're not license for you but if you
S0013	mm
S0278	want to license the whole showground for drink alcohol er you couldn't run a show
S0012	no you couldn't
S0278	they have to stay in one spot
S0012	insurance be dear enough anyway ain't it
S0278	oh yeah last year they didn't make a profit because we have a hopeless saturday
S0012	mm
S0278	we have a humdinger sunday
S0013	yeah you do
S0278	but it it it more or less break even you know there be there be a small profit but it break even
S0012	mm
S0278	show complete failure
S0278	someone get run over run over and and and severely damage erm
S0278	there there be flood
S0278	try to set up and machinery for
S0012	the the the show be the same
S0278	so yeah so yeah yeah yeah
S0278	so we we we do well really
S0013	yeah
S0278	mm
S0278	mm but it be interest on the whole this you don't get any trouble and when you do see a bite of trouble then it's easy to get sort cos we've get er again same guy do it he's a welshman he's ex army he have a security team
S0013	mm
S0278	so we have the same guy on the gate all the time he put the same guy up the far end for me so they know what they're do they turn up he and his wife run this and they've get a fabulous team and just call if you've get a problem
S0013	yeah
S0278	mm but i hope we don't get to that stage but er it's just just er gently remind people
S0013	mm
S0278	and i think the easiest way be to do a little thing

S0278	mm through the hedge
