S0420	so you get a new laptop
S0366	yeah i'm really please about this laptop cos i've never have one before
S0420	what a laptop
S0366	no i've never own a laptop only have a static computer
S0420	oh like a desktop
S0366	mm mm
S0420	and the so what what what prompt you
S0366	well it's erm well er my friend's partner erm you know i be ask him about get a laptop and he say he well he have one that he wasn't use
S0420	mm
S0366	that be only a year old so
S0365	but you first come round to want a laptop cos you have a purpose you be try to get a presentation ready
S0420	ah ah yeah that's
S0366	yes yes for the talk
S0420	after do the presentation yeah so
S0366	yeah
S0420	you find you couldn't live without it
S0366	well now i'm yeah i want i decide erm well i i'm try to write and i find write on the laptop once i've formulate a few ideas rather than just write longhand i find it really good to just to to
S0420	yeah cos you can go back and edit stuff and
S0366	yeah dead easy it's dead easy erm so so er yeah that be
S0420	still it's not as difficult to use as 's
S0366	no 's be go back tonight
S0366	i've get to just get the fingerprint off it and sort of tidy it up a bite and but it's not that be very difficult
S0420	yeah yeah i think you just i think he wish he hadn't buy it
S0366	yeah he do
S0420	oh well and you're still plug away with the linux one
S0365	i be yeah yeah i like er use linux cos it's erm a bite different and erm it's not microsoft
S0420	yeah
S0365	which be a bonus
S0420	you're not lose any money to bill gate or steve job or
S0365	yeah
S0420	and of these
S0365	and what i find with these er new laptops and er windows be that they be try to extract information from you all the time if you notice that erm computers constantly engage with the internet so
S0420	yeah
S0365	they're take information off you that's why i don't like so
S0420	yeah i get the same with my phone
S0365	right
S0420	it's always say you know data will be you know data will be share with this and that and the other
S0366	yes i don't like that
S0420	it be a bite worry but i i think you can there's a lot of things you can click so it's not do that i think that you just actually need to spend the time but yeah since i've start use that linux laptop i'm very happy
S0365	right right
S0420	the only problem be
S0365	you're use open office
S0420	er libra
S0365	yes
S0420	and er it's just the one that come with that
S0366	be that similar to open office
S0365	it be an open office programme yeah
S0420	yeah they're all a much of a muchness really
S0365	mm
S0420	erm but it's definitely good cos now and again you get something that you can't do that perhaps a a normal laptop could do but there's not much
S0365	mm
S0420	and if you spend a bite of time find out about it it's not bad
S0365	the other thing about linux be if you erm need to fix something it be a lot harder than
S0420	there be a greatest sense of achievement isn't there
S0365	there be yeah
S0366	why's it harder
S0365	er sometimes er well it's not so good at automatically instal things
S0420	mm
S0365	so you have to find a programme install it and find the right place to install it it's get better erm the other thing be that sometimes if you need to fix things you actually have to enter line of code so remember on my computer the brightness control doesn't work automatically
S0366	mm mm
S0365	i have to put in a small line of code i have to find on the internet cos
S0366	right
S0365	i can't code in unix so
S0366	in unix
S0365	unix be
S0420	the language of the operate system
S0365	the language of the operate system yeah
S0420	but it's nice that you get there's a sense of achievement it's like be able to change the oil in your car or something like that
S0365	yeah that's right mm
S0420	if you can do it erm it's kind of about but so the new one be brand shiny and
S0366	well what happen be he the house get break into and
S0365	your friend's house
S0366	a friend's house about a year and a half ago
S0420	and you've get a laptop from them
S0420	right okay it all become clear
S0366	and erm the insurance pay for a you know a replacement
S0420	ah yeah
S0366	and erm so i be just say i didn't want a computer with windows eight on it like 's one so i want i didn't need a and i didn't want a touch screen you know the new one's i just want one maybe year or two old
S0420	yes
S0366	and erm so say ah i think i might have something you're interest in he say you know what be you think of spend and i say well you know not more than about two fifty and he and he say well would you like this for one fifty and it's erm basically it's about a year old he's hardly use it and so then look it up on the web and at the very least it be six hundred wasn't it
S0420	wow
S0365	yes yes
S0420	that's a bargain
S0366	yeah oh it's fantastic er it's really fast
S0365	and the review be really good yeah five star review
S0420	what brand be it
S0366	it's samsung
S0420	okay
S0366	cromo
S0420	so it's a recognise brand isn't it
S0366	yeah yeah
S0420	good
S0366	and it's so after use 's er when you're use the er what do you call it the curser
S0420	the touchpad
S0366	i mean 's be so difficult
S0420	yeah it have that bumpy kind of
S0366	and this one be so smooth
S0365	yeah
S0366	and
S0420	it's very unnatural
S0366	yeah
S0365	yeah it's
S0366	whereas this one be so smooth it's it's fantastic
S0420	good
S0366	erm so go to buy tomorrow
S0420	mm i need to yeah i need to think about get my old laptop i've get a big one as well that little linux the white one i've get be good but i've get a big laptop sit there and that's only a year year and a bite old and that's the one that get break the hard disk
S0365	ah
S0420	it's dead so it would need a new hard disc hard drive hard disc be it the same thing
S0365	i think it's the same thing
S0420	yeah i need a new one fit a brand new one fit and an operate system put on it again so that would probably cost about a hundred and fifty pound so
S0365	it's get to the realms now where it's almost as easy to buy a new one isn't it
S0420	yeah yeah
S0365	erm like my computer if i be to replace it it would cost about two hundred pound so there's almost no point me er
S0420	repair unless there's unless there's stuff on the machine itself or it be an expensive machine to begin with if it be a thousand pound machine and there's only a small problem they probably would fix it because you've already spend that money for a reason
S0365	mm
S0420	you know for the capabilities of the computer but i don't know i don't
S0365	what bring you to linux then
S0366	he doesn't use it do you use linux
S0420	it's free
S0365	yeah
S0366	i didn't realise you use linux
S0420	yeah yeah on that little white laptop we've get
S0366	oh right
S0420	erm because that have windows on it when i buy it from erm about four or five years ago now erm and then i i get hold of a disc which so i put a newer windows on it but it couldn't really cope with it
S0365	mm
S0420	and then i have it as a when i be in tunisia erm after be bear i go back to tunisia after be back in china for a couple of weeks i put i put i take that with me and leave the big laptop and i put it with a double boot system so it could do windows or linux and it didn't work very well a lot of the stuff like you say adjust the the brightness and things like that there erm be certain things that didn't work and the one i'm use now linux mint work very well
S0365	ah
S0420	erm there's nothing that it doesn't do that i want it to do
S0365	really
S0420	yeah
S0366	do you know linux do you know what linux be
S0365	i don't no i use and
S0420	i i just like the name and and and
S0366	sound cool
S0420	yeah linux
S0365	sound more like windows which be erm although they call it kind of plug and play
S0420	yeah some some things not everything but i don't know it's good and it's it's you know
S0365	and the thing about it be that it be erm an older it's base on an older operate system but it be cod properly from the begin and like you say your computer be struggle with the latest version
S0420	yeah
S0365	of windows but this operate system which be more sophisticate because it be more efficient it actually work better
S0420	yeah
S0365	uhu even on a
S0420	i've not have any problems with it it's not freeze or crash or anything like that i do try to install an update and it wasn't happy with that so i just go back and uninstalled it and it be happy again so i i don't know enough about them and i don't have enough i don't care enough about them to want to learn about it
S0366	mm
S0420	so you just want it to work erm but when i get my first pay cheque from my new job
S0365	mm
S0420	i'm gonna buy a new ipad so
S0366	oh yeah when do you start your job
S0420	i have
S0366	oh you have start
S0420	yeah yeah
S0366	oh right
S0420	well i've i've be
S0366	oh yes you would have by now
S0420	well no i've be go in in the afternoons when i don't when i've not be teach
S0366	mm mm
S0420	just to kind of get up to speed and also cos my boss have a lot to run through with me he erm he's away on holiday for two weeks from tuesday
S0366	right
S0420	so he want to get me up to speed
S0366	uhu
S0420	before that so erm
S0366	oh so be it look positive
S0420	yeah yeah hard work but positive
S0366	right good
S0420	try to recruit a try to recruit a few teachers at the moment but one one she's perfect she like a really good teacher erm she be easy on the eye which'll go down well with the italians and the spanish students come across
S0420	and of course what happen she get poach by another school and we offer her a more permanent contract
S0365	oh right
S0420	but erm ah these things happen
S0366	mm
S0365	mm
S0420	but er no go back to your computer erm you've get no excuse now not to use
S0366	yes ah right
S0365	what's prezi
S0366	prezi be this erm er i've only see a week bite erm show me but it's instead of powerpoint so instead of us sort of
S0365	oh yeah
S0366	from what i gather a sort of linear slide presentation it's a bite like go into some kind of memory board or something
S0365	oh right
S0420	mm
S0366	and be able to go into different bits it's more three dimensional
S0420	yeah but more dynamic than than erm
S0366	erm
S0420	than powerpoint
S0366	yeah
S0365	and be that erm a software
S0420	no the there's two there's a free version and there's a sort of premium version
S0365	mm mm
S0420	and i think the free version you can do almost anything with it erm i use it give i mean i do workshops in china for for teachers and it catch people's attention which be nice erm rather than say well i'm gonna put the pp you know the powerpoint on now and most people go oh god really erm but i think it it do it's like more and more like a memory board you've get more it's more flexible as you're use it
S0366	mm mm
S0420	which be nice and because it
S0365	do it work on the windows
S0420	it work on all the platforms i think
S0365	mm mm
S0420	erm cos it's web base
S0365	oh i see
S0420	erm
S0365	right
S0420	but you can pay for it and have it locally
S0365	oh i see
S0420	erm i don't i i really like it i just
S0365	so if it's web base where do you store your presentation
S0420	on on on in the cloud
S0366	in the cloud
S0365	right
S0420	in the cloud sound so threaten doesn't it but erm
S0365	so it's a bite like a dropbox system where you can store your stuff
S0420	yeah
S0365	er on another server
S0420	yeah yeah yeah yeah more or less i think as a free user you can download so many before you
S0365	mm
S0420	before they sort of cap it
S0365	mm
S0366	right
S0420	erm and for things like phone and ipads there's actually a an app and i think you can download all your prezis so erm but because it's more more memory board's a good way of describe it erm you tend not to put as much text on
S0365	mm mm
S0420	so you it's more visually orient
S0366	mm mm
S0420	which i think presentations should be cos the
S0366	mm
S0420	you know the if they're gonna be sit read something it's a bite of a waste of time isn't it
S0366	mm mm
S0365	mm
S0420	to be to be present it so we'll see
S0366	oh yeah if you wanna come i'm give a talk on the first of march
S0420	first of march what day be that
S0366	sunday
S0420	sunday
S0366	sunday afternoon
S0420	yeah
S0366	if you wanna come i don't know if anyone's gonna come yet but that's another topic
S0420	well i'll be there
S0420	yeah that'll be good then you've get your new laptop now
S0420	so you can do it be confidence
S0366	absolutely
S0420	sound good
