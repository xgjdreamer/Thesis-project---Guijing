S0013	yeah not very nice
S0278	say to her i say like be in prison she say well i often think that i'd be better off in prison
S0278	i'd be freer in prison
S0013	mm
S0278	than i be when i'm work in the lock in cos i can't come out
S0013	yeah
S0278	i have to stay in there
S0012	yeah
S0278	so i'm just lock into this build
S0013	doesn't seem quite right do it
S0012	that doesn't seem right
S0278	no it's not right it's not right and er it's not what we
S0013	the staff shouldn't be lock in
S0278	mm
S0013	it's
S0278	well they get three of em three of them have to be lock in
S0013	yeah but it doesn't seem right that the staff should be lock in i mean
S0278	well it's because they're so vulnerable these people that be in there they can't they can't risk
S0013	what leave them
S0278	no you can't leave them you need
S0013	so
S0278	three people in there all the time cos
S0012	oh do you
S0278	one can suddenly fly off the handle
S0013	mm
S0012	oh right it's that bad be it
S0278	it's er yes yeah
S0012	mm
S0013	mm
S0278	and one bloke smash up the whole place all the windows and everything overnight one night
S0012	
S0278	and they couldn't stop him because you're not allow to restrain
S0012	can't you use a taser
S0278	you can pardon you're not allow to hold em tight you can give them medication and things but you can't not allow to difficult problem
S0013	they're really violent
S0278	no not no not so much violent but they don't know what they're do they don't understand
S0012	mm
S0278	what they're do they er the dementia's go so far
S0012	yeah yeah
S0278	that they
S0013	yeah
S0278	it's not them say er she explain she can deal with it cos she know it's not it's not them it's not the way they be
S0278	for the whole of their live
S0012	no
S0278	it's just this be the way they have become
S0013	yeah
S0278	and because they've lose their mind's go
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm and it sort of it just it sort of creep up and creep up and then suddenly get a lot worse
S0012	yeah
S0278	it seem
S0012	yeah
S0278	but it's er
S0013	yeah
S0278	i mean it's not fair that because she's good at it they put her in there and she always get youngsters who don't know what they're do and go away they go away and disappear and hide most of the time
S0013	mm
S0278	so she and it's just if she's do the do the medication sometimes she's get to stop and sort somebody out erm in you know while she's do the medication because nobody else have do it you know change the bed or something like that
S0012	there should be more people help shouldn't there
S0278	i know well the people the number be there but they they don't do anything
S0012	well they should do er who
S0278	erm
S0012	who's the boss of em
S0278	mm
S0012	there should be a boss
S0278	well there be er her boss tend to sit in the office apparently so i dunno it's not good
S0013	mm
S0278	but i think she'll reach a point probably where
S0012	mm
S0278	it's erm well she'll she'll just pack it in but she can't afford to that's the trouble
S0013	yeah it be a problem isn't it
S0278	yeah
S0012	how long's she get before she retire
S0278	another
S0278	seven years
S0278	so if she's sixty next oh now the can you help me with this you i she's sixty in january
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	and i'm think we i ought to have a surprise party cos so many people know her
S0013	mm
S0278	and a surprise party at
S0012	do you
S0278	book book the hall and then find some reason to get her down there and er
S0013	do she mind people know how old she be
S0278	don't think so no
S0013	mm okay
S0278	but but she doesn't like formal things she really doesn't like the formal things at all
S0013	no
S0278	
S0013	mm
S0278	er but er i i've i think maybe so that's what i'm think about at the minute erm probably easier to organise it here cos of the dog if you organise her to go if either of her daughters well i'd get them involve couldn't i
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	but it'd be easy if it be just to bring a chair and we just do something like that
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	yeah cos she doesn't eat much anyway but it just nice to have a little gather
S0012	yeah
S0278	wouldn't it
S0013	mm
S0278	to celebrate it
S0012	that would yeah
S0278	but that's that's what i'm think
S0012	well that's only
S0013	that's january
S0012	that's only about six quid to hire the hall
S0278	mm it's good
S0013	yeah
S0278	yeah
S0013	not very much
S0278	mm mm
S0012	and that's pretty good you know
S0278	yeah yeah
S0013	well it's six pound an hour actually isn't it
S0278	an hour
S0012	be it an hour
S0013	isn't it
S0278	six pound an hour yeah
S0013	but i think for the residents around here
S0278	yeah yeah
S0013	er you'll be include now cos you're the church i should think
S0278	mm
S0013	i think it be twelve pound for the whole
S0278	be it for the whole thing
S0012	yeah
S0278	oh well that's good
S0013	for the even
S0278	that's good
S0013	i think
S0278	yeah
S0013	but it wasn't very much
S0278	er see in the winter like that it'd be good cos you could have the fire go and that's
S0012	have a look on the website
S0278	that's
S0012	that'll tell you how much it be
S0013	yeah
S0278	i think er i think it be six pound and hour i think
S0012	mm
S0013	be it an hour
S0278	mm
S0013	i know it's six pound in my head
S0278	yeah
S0012	i've get six pound
S0278	so it'd be nice to do something special for her she doesn't want anything special but i think it'd be nice can't let that one go but then she's get another six years to work
S0012	six years that's ridiculous isn't it
S0278	well er she would've be retire then
S0012	yeah
S0278	a few years back
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah er i i be
S0013	i be just er well i be one day out actually
S0278	be you
S0013	erm i but i only have to wait another six months
S0278	do you
S0013	i be lucky really
S0278	mm
S0012	yeah
S0278	now it's er gradually creep you see hasn't it
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	and she she just keep say i i don't think
S0013	mm
S0278	i can do this for another six years
S0012	well i shouldn't think she could crikey you're not capable
S0278	she well she do one place she she erm she would like
S0012	it's a bite physical as well
S0278	oh it's terribly physical
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	turn people particularly if you can't find anybody else to help
S0013	that's right
S0278	some of them have gotta be turn every two hours
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	but they can't turn themselves and
S0013	no it's too much for people to do
S0278	it be too much yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	but er er she's it might come where she actually it might be a bless in disguise what happen if you if if the doctor say that erm cos her shoulder both of them er ache she think she's get erm arthritis in her shoulder
S0278	so she can't do what she's do do that erm will that benefit her
S0012	well i don't know if it would because erm
S0278	no it probably wouldn't i don't know
S0012	i dunno
S0013	it depend what the doctor say
S0012	yeah
S0013	if they say
S0012	how long's she
S0013	if they tell her
S0012	how long's she be do it for
S0278	what ever ever since erm die she's be
S0012	ever since die
S0278	because she and she be care for him
S0012	yeah
S0278	and because she'd care so much for him she know how to care for somebody in that position who be die
S0012	oh she's not qualify then
S0278	oh she's a fully qualify carer now yeah
S0012	oh right
S0278	oh yes she do she actually she she must've do a course do a do a college course
S0012	yeah
S0278	she's get er scn she's quite not an scn she she wear her badge quite proudly it's erm what other qualifications do you get at a college
S0013	nvqs
S0278	yes yeah she wear that and and she get the top one
S0012	yeah
S0278	but she's also get what er what be more valuable er she's drug qualify
S0012	yeah
S0278	so she could administer all the drug
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	and that that's that's a very valuable qualification as well
S0013	yeah
S0278	erm so but she do kind of one of the place she mention she she really quite fancy but it mean drive into there's er there's a hospice there
S0013	mm
S0278	and erm and she she's use she's she lose count of the number of people she's sit with while they die
S0012	i expect she have
S0278	and
S0278	and so she say i'm quite familiar with it but nobody else like do it but i get them all organise afterwards and sort it all
S0012	yeah
S0278	and she's happier do that than deal with what she's do with at the minute
S0012	yeah
S0278	so actually in er in a hospice probably
S0013	yeah
S0278	erm but it's a long er there's this one particular place she'd like to work but it's just too far to drive the money she would get and the and the travel involve she
S0278	it'd cost her a lot to get there

S0278	no we'd be two legged race cos we've only get two between us that's any good
S0012	yeah but you tie the two legs together
S0278	two bad ones together and and when then we just walk on the
S0012	then you just walk on the on the good ones
S0278	do you do you see that erm oh it be a weird programme and i think i can't i can't be watch this it be a girl who be bear er no er they be they have two head
S0013	oh yeah
S0278	and one body between them
S0013	yeah
S0012	oh that's right and they
S0278	so they have two brain
S0012	have to be separate
S0278	but everything else no they no they couldn't be separate
S0012	no
S0278	two head and they go through uni and everything
S0012	oh that's right they do yeah
S0278	and and one and the thing be that er the one on the right control the right arm and the right leg
S0012	yeah
S0278	and the one on the leave control the leave
S0013	oh
S0278	arm and the leave leg but but they er because they have grow up together from baby like this they could make and they they'd go like this and they be two different people
S0012	yeah
S0278	when they'd finish talk
S0278	they'd just sort of go like that with their hand and then they'd could just gesticulate and
S0012	mm
S0013	yeah
S0278	erm and when they walk you try i couldn't get my head round think of this that one brain's work the right leg and the other but they could walk they could run and they could
S0013	yeah
S0278	ride a bicycle so you've get two arm
S0278	two separate head work the two arm
S0012	yeah
S0278	you know one arm each
S0013	yeah
S0278	and they could ride a bicycle that be the most difficult thing they ever do but they they manage it
S0013	so if one want to turn leave and other one want to turn right
S0278	no but they but they have
S0013	they have yeah
S0278	because they'd be together for so long they
S0012	they could communicate

S0278	they know and erm and they use to take it in turn to pick what they be gonna wear each day
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	erm and they both like different things you see so they take it in turn for that and they take it in turn to decide what they would eat cos they like different because they have the same tummy all the same gut the same tummy
S0013	yeah
S0278	erm but
S0013	mm
S0278	one brain think i like that and the other brain's think i like that so they take it in turn to pick what they would eat

S0013	mm
S0278	and the whole leave hand side belong to the leave hand head
S0012	mm
S0278	for the for the for the for the
