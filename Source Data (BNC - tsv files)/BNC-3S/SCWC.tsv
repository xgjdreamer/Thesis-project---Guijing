S0529	oh dear that's not no come over the gap come on over the gap
S0530	i wanna look at your this cat oh my god
S0529	watch it watch it oh that's so

S0529	it's just when you cat be clean his fur
S0530	that be so cute
S0529	oh i think that be really cute ah he's just fall asleep on his hand that's adorable i want my yorkshire pudding now
S0530	oh yeah how long's it take to cook
S0529	a few minutes
S0530	how many minutes
S0529	twenty
S0530	twenty what if i just meet him though and then i just look take one look at him and just think no
S0530	i know that sound mean
S0529	up and be like oh shit i forget i be mean to meet up with my friend
S0530	but that's mean
S0529	yeah but i don't know it's just
S0530	and it you know what i mean though if you look at them not just look at them and think they're like bad look but if you just look and like this be not go to work
S0529	yeah but i know people say that it's shallow to like look at someone's appearance but i think it really do matter like you can't like have a relationship with someone you don't find physically attractive
S0530	mm
S0529	as well as everything else you have to find them physically attractive i think like to a certain extent you know like but if you look at him and think like oh my god like no then
S0530	but then again like it could work both ways cos he could look at me and just think oh my god and like it could be really embarrass so like both of us could just think the same thing or one of us could be into it and the other one not into it
S0529	mm
S0530	and it's like oh my god so much can go wrong i'll have to try and just put
S0529	well the worst that would happen be that he'd like
S0530	or not turn up
S0529	or not turn up
S0530	mm
S0529	and if that happen then you just
S0530	cry in the street
S0529	well no you no you don't cry you just go back
S0530	go to the cinema on my own and watch suffragette
S0529	well you could go to the cinema on your own
S0530	and be fuck
S0529	but you could just go back home and be like oh never mind that didn't work that be a bite of a fail
S0530	mm how much be the cinema in town anyway
S0529	i think it's like seven quid
S0530	be it
S0529	yeah

S0529	i'll take his ticket i'll like punch him in the face take his ticket and go
S0530	yeah
S0529	no i don't think it'll be bad i think it'll be awkward but i dunno
S0530	mm we shall see

S0529	yeah i know i'm try but it's really difficult
S0531	that normally help
S0529	no it's not even ready to mash yet if it's still boil it's not really soft enough so i'm gonna leave it
S0531	i'd say probably the easiest thing to use be you've get one of these one of these things
S0529	yeah so it's really like it bend a lot spoon
S0529	yeah a wooden spoon'll work that'll be alright
S0531	yeah but i'd say just wait for it to then put milk in it and then it will sort of mash itself really
S0529	yeah

S0530	you're gonna be so glad you choose me of all the girls on tinder erm and i'm how about i'll tell you about me to break the ice i like write photography watch film and i have a pet cat call
S0529	do you actually write i'll tell you about me to break the ice

S0530	yeah i say that's bad isn't it
S0531	not that bad fine it's fine
S0530	i'll tell you about me to break the ice i like write photography watch film and have a pet cat call at home and i'm shit my pant
S0529	pretty much
S0530	ah
S0531	what what do he say beforehand tell you to break the
S0530	erm ah
S0529	cos i wouldn't do it any better than you have so
S0530	no you wouldn't that that be quite right you would not do it any better cos that be an excellent start
S0529	it be
S0531	i like how like most people like when they start talk to someone online it's kind of it's always really awkward at first but then people like pretend that it's not awkward you've just be like i'm gonna make this not awkward like you've kind of announce it like you've be really kind of open about it most people like kind of go mm
S0530	cos the thing be that's the point like
S0531	you're straightforward
S0530	this be this be awkward but it's not because i'm honest about it be awkward rather than try to be like this be cool
S0529	ask me he just ask me who would win a fight batman or jesus
S0530	erm
S0529	what do i say to that
S0531	jesus
S0529	yeah i think jesus i think it's gotta be jesus
S0530	jesus
S0531	jesus be like imagine if jesus have twitter
S0529	yeah but you're a catholic so you have to say that
S0531	no no but i'm just say like load of people would follow jesus like to the point that like they would kill themselves like he could make an army of christians like
S0529	yeah that's true
S0531	to be fair there'll be a lot of people that'll follow batman as well
S0529	well cos batman's rich so he'll have a lot of like
S0531	yeah but jesus be in charge of the catholic church so
S0529	that's true mm
S0531	well all the church in fact the catholic church
S0529	do he or just walk around barefoot really though didn't he
S0531	huh
S0529	he just walk around barefoot
S0531	yeah
S0529	he doesn't really like control anything
S0531	yeah he wasn't that's the thing though like he ever intend to create a new religion
S0529	yeah
S0531	he just because he just fulfil the prophecy of jewish judaism so he didn't actually have a like be a big deal it be just bits of teach and miracles all that stuff but then they all be quite that come later that come way later
S0529	yeah oh this be not work
S0531	put milk in it
S0530	yeah put
S0530	mash the milk in some butter
S0529	yeah it's the same i'm sorry
S0531	yeah and some butter as well
S0530	oh god i'm an i'm a clown
S0529	you're not it's fine
S0531	like most boys be like they're kinda shy and don't really know how to talk to girls he's probably just relieve that you're take control and like can be just like you know answer to you rather than have to like come up with stuff himself
S0530	mm
S0529	that down yeah too much too much milk shit
S0530	that's a good point actually cos most boys actually feel like they have a responsibility to
S0531	mm
S0530	yeah
S0531	to lead the conversation
S0530	i mean i'm not sure how i feel about that if i be a boy really
S0531	mm
