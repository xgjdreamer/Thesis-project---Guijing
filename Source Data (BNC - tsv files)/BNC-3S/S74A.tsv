S0654	okay i i would like to talk about pirate and what would you do if you be one or like you be captain of the ship
S0653	oh that's a good question
S0655	i think if you be a prisoner on a pirate ship you'd probably do all their chores
S0653	mm
S0655	you would probably have to walk the plank at sometime
S0653	but what if you be the actual pirate though
S0655	oh if you be an actual pirate you'd er have to go to bed very early because pirate be actually quite civilise people by themselves although once they meet another ship they're very very hostile
S0653	but you're right we saw that on horrible histories that they have a an early curfew didn't they
S0655	mm
S0653	and lot of rule to live by what would your pirate name be
S0655	mm that would depend if i be a captain or not
S0653	mm
S0655	cos if i be a captain i would have a really cool name
S0654	do it have to rhyme
S0653	no
S0654	okay if i be captain i'd be call shark
S0655	mm
S0653	captain shark
S0654	yeah
S0653	okay cool
S0654	and if i be a normal pirate
S0653	sorry
S0654	if i be normal
S0653	a normal pirate
S0654	i'd be call jolly
S0655	jolly
S0653	jolly i like that what about you
S0655	mm if i be a captain i'd be call captain piranha
S0653	okay
S0655	erm cos that's a cool
S0653	mm
S0655	name
S0653	yeah very fierce
S0655	and if i be a normal pirate i'd be something like dagger
S0653	okay i think i would be red hand
S0655	mm
S0653	if i be a normal pirate and
S0654	or er red berry oh
S0653	or red berry
S0654	shiny
S0653	yes the villain that's in our book erm
S0655	mm shiny
S0653	captain purple hair
S0654	mum you don't have purple hair there
S0653	mm
S0654	purple hair wasn't invent back then
S0653	i could dye my hair with erm blueberries
S0654	they didn't have blueberries back then
S0653	they do have blueberries back then
S0654	or couldn't get them
S0655	obviously you could
S0653	okay erm
S0655	mum you could get blueberries
S0653	captain scarface
S0654	cool
S0653	cos i'm sure i would have nasty scar all over my face
S0655	or garfield
S0653	mm
S0654	what if i be your daughter
S0655	captain garfield
S0654	what if i be your daughter
S0653	then we'd all be pirate together wouldn't we
S0654	yeah but what if i didn't follow the rule
S0653	what if you didn't follow the rule i'd have to make you walk the plank
S0654	no mum you wouldn't cos i'm your daughter
S0653	well that depend er if you be rude to me in front of my crew
S0654	then i would
S0653	i might lock you up for a bite
S0654	then i would say mama and i would my teddy bear
S0654	and then you would need to have to get me out
S0653	you think
S0654	yeah
S0655	you know what i don't think lady pirate actually have children
S0653	i don't think they do i think that would've be quite tricky
S0654	why
S0653	well it would've be a bite awkward have a child on a ship wouldn't it
S0654	no like if you have the child on land
S0653	mm
S0655	at least the child would never get seasick cos they'd be on the ship their entire life
S0653	i know but you don't want a child see piratey things do you
S0655	well
S0654	no
S0655	they would think it's normal
S0654	a child pirate
S0653	mm
S0654	it could be a it could be it could be a pirate child
S0653	yes i know but it's it would be very dangerous for them wouldn't it unless they have a good hide space what if their ship what if their parent get kill and their ship get set fire to
S0655	mm
S0654	i know but then they would be a spy for another crew
S0653	well no they'd probably die on the ship wouldn't they
S0654	no they wouldn't they'd go into the ocean they'd find their dad tell him that their mum have die and be with him
S0655	baby be erm
S0653	okay
S0655	baby be practically invincible
S0653	okay
S0655	but
S0653	so they'd somehow swim the ocean
S0654	no their dad
S0655	well they could make friends with a shark
S0653	okay
S0655	because baby be very very clever
S0653	what sort of adventure would we get up to
S0655	eat the world's biggest doughnut
S0653	pirate adventure
S0655	eat the world's biggest
S0653	we'd get lot of
S0655	pirate
S0653	treasure i hope
S0654	yeah
S0655	i didn't i still don't know why pirate want treasure
S0653	so to make them rich
S0655	or to er or just for the fun of get it
S0653	yeah just the fun of it it'd be nice to have lot of jewel and necklaces and things wouldn't it
S0655	mm
S0654	uhu
S0655	although if your ship do get raid
S0653	mm
S0655	then er you would've give em all your gold
S0653	but darling that's why they use to bury their treasure on islands so that that wouldn't happen so they could return to the get the treasure later
S0654	mm yeah
S0653	do you see
S0654	cos their ship wouldn't hold much more
S0653	mm
S0654	and
S0653	obviously it be very tricky if you forget which island you'd leave it on or lose your map or anything like that
S0654	mum
S0653	would we be nice to other people or would we just kill everybody
S0655	well
S0654	we could be nice pirate do you know what nice pirate do

S0654	yeah
S0653	yeah we could be nice pirate
S0654	and we just like we'd we'd be friends with
