S0623	he go over the jump by accident
S0623	he didn't he didn't have enough speed to jump and he do like
S0623	kind of like go sideways on it and then go down and he nearly go and then he manage
S0623	to plough and turn and
S0617	yeah
S0623	oh it be all er it be all a bite hit and miss for a minute
S0617	and he could turn okay
S0623	yeah he just plough he just
S0617	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0525	auntie be impress with her lesson last week because she sign up for a group lesson
S0617	yeah
S0525	and she be the only one there
S0617	oh really
S0525	so the guy come up to her and he say oh you're not erm she say no
S0617	think so yeah
S0525	cos there be i think it
S0617	yeah
S0525	be it something like a hundred and seventy pound for a one on one lesson or something
S0617	mm
S0525	or more than that
S0617	and how much do she pay
S0525	i dunno whatever it be just for to join in a lesson with other people but nobody else go so she have him to herself which she think be be good and he say they have the the slop and she say he be ski backwards all the way
S0617	yeah
S0525	and erm wasn't very impress with her with her ski because he say how fast be you go and she say well you know when you come down from the top and you
S0617	yeah
S0525	get to the bite where it level out
S0617	mm
S0525	i have to cross that
S0617	oh
S0525	have to push myself off again
S0525	so yeah so say there's no way you're come out with us behave like that go that slow
S0623	how do the boys get on in their lesson could they do it
S0525	oh be on the jump and they be love it and they be
S0617	really
S0525	yeah they be bomb down
S0617	thing be they're fearless aren't they they'll
S0525	yeah
S0617	just go for it
S0525	and they're good at all that sort of stuff
S0617	at that sort of age especially cos they're good at sport
S0525	that's why i think they'd be better off split cos want them all to spend the week together
S0623	oh
S0525	but and the boys be gonna be
S0617	mm
S0525	at a different level to and your dad
S0617	yeah they'll probably spend the first couple of days together and get use to it or the first day
S0525	well i think you have to go in your group and then that's you
S0617	oh
S0525	you you'll split you you're cos you're you've get instruction in the mornings it's all include so i think you have to decide at the start and stay in your group
S0617	oh do you
S0525	isn't that normally how it work
S0617	i guess so
S0623	yeah
S0525	cos last year she say or be it two years ago they go go in one group the boys go even though they be beginners they say we should put them with the children because they're gonna pick it up so much faster than
S0617	mm
S0617	yeah
S0525	so they put them in a different group and go in a different group and she say erm even though it be only the morning it go on till about two o'clock before they all meet up and then she say most of your day's go so she want to be together
S0623	it'll be fine cos she'll be with dad so
S0525	well that's what i be think
S0525	i i think if they go together
S0623	yeah yeah should be fine it's
S0525	cos the the boys'll miss out so much
S0617	yeah
S0525	and there's no way and your dad can go in the advance
S0623	oh no no
S0525	they'll just be
S0617	mm
S0525	leave behind so i think the boys'll probably push for it and i'm sure will too cos he won't wanna be stab around with
S0617	it depend how good the boys be
S0525	be you
S0617	cos if they're not they
S0623	but they're probably like
S0617	yeah they're probably alright but they're probably
S0623	as you say they're more fearless than anything they're probably
S0623	can i say our level would you say we're at the same level
S0525	oh no well you're quite a pro after be in japan

S0617	oh
S0525	to do the whale watch she's plan that and when she be tell me er i know exactly where she be go cos i know what the route be cos i'd look at it
S0617	mm
S0525	a few time so
S0617	be we go away by the way this year with to a cottage or something
S0623	yeah
S0525	we need to sort out a week didn't we that you and would make if you want to
S0617	yeah be you go to bulgaria it's either one or the other
S0623	maybe
S0617	if you go to bulgaria then i could come there or
S0623	well we might go for a week in the summer it depend on the flight price can't really afford to spend a lot but we'd probably go for a week
S0525	week
S0623	august time
S0525	the week here'll be cheaper if we get erm
S0623	yeah
S0525	one of uncle 's place cos i think it's only ninety nine pound for the week
S0617	where be we go or somewhere would be nice wouldn't it
S0525	i think it's
S0617	by the sea
S0525	in which be near auntie
S0617	yeah by the sea
S0525	yeah and that would be a cheap week
S0617	yeah
S0525	and you could just do and because it's a cheap week i mean you could maybe just do erm a couple of days if you didn't wanna take time off work
S0617	oh
S0525	rather than take a you know
S0617	yeah i'd have a week
S0525	oh it's well that's fine
S0617	be nice to all do a week wouldn't it
S0525	but i'm think er or if didn't wanna spend all the time but
S0617	yeah
S0525	want to come down if it's there you you've get a choice of maybe obviously it'd be good if we all go for the week
S0617	yeah
S0525	but you can only book it four weeks in advance so there's no point ask him until we're ready to go but that would mean you'd need to have a week off all together
S0617	yeah
S0525	i think i think erm
S0617	when do you go to bulgaria
S0525	may we're go in er june i think you'd have to be early may or end of april we be think weren't we to go to the go to
S0623	okay
S0525	cos you sometimes get the better weather there
S0623	yeah yeah
S0617	possibly may would be better for me because i have one week now that i could take between now and september so if i take it in april that mean i've get may june july august
S0525	you've only get one week holiday in all that time
S0617	mm cos i'm have two weeks in september october two weeks at the start one week in the middle two weeks at the end
S0525	book already
S0617	no but that's how you have to have it
S0525	oh
S0623	why oh
S0617	so you have two weeks
S0525	oh so you can either go to bulgaria or
S0617	yes
S0525	right
S0623	two weeks er what
S0617	you have to break it down to spring summer autumn and then obviously you can't have any of winter off
S0623	oh
S0617	so i be gonna have one week in the summer and then two weeks before well not before christmas but september october if i could have it in october that'd be better cos it just mean that
S0623	mm
S0617	but whenever everyone else can get it off but like i say
S0525	well
S0617	in may
S0525	we go away
S0617	early may
S0525	at the end of may
S0617	so it'd be early may
S0525	for ten days to mauritius and then we're only back for a couple of weeks then we go to bulgaria so i think in er start of may would be
S0617	mm
S0525	would be good if
S0617	yeah
S0525	your dad can get the time off erm yeah there's a bank holiday at the start isn't there so
S0617	mm
S0525	we'd have to see if he's get availability so you you'd have where be we now february so maybe in another month's time it why don't you and see if you can erm coordinate the same week off
S0617	mm
S0525	and as well
S0623	mm
S0525	and then you then we when we've get a week so long as it's not in school holiday say he should be fine to get us somewhere
S0617	so how much would it cost
S0525	it's ninety nine pound for the week
S0617	for a
S0525	to hire the whole thing
S0617	six bedroomed
S0525	well you don't need six bedrooms do you
S0617	no six people
S0525	yeah
S0617	apartment
S0525	and the dog
S0525	cos er they go erm
S0623	won't be hard to

S0525	didn't they with the boys and with mum and so similar to what they have they have a hot tub and everything
S0617	be we gonna have a hot tub
S0525	we'd ask him yeah so for ninety nine pound between all six of
S0525	well yeah so it's that's gonna be nice and cheap then isn't it
S0617	yeah
S0525	not gonna cost much to go
S0617	it's really good
S0525	probably be in three cars
