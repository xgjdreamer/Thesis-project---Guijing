S0521	in the nineteen twenties to produce a vehicle which be universally affordable in germany
S0520	mm
S0521	during the nineteen thirties hitler get to hear about the project
S0520	oh yeah
S0521	and he desperately want to rival the americans and be able to afford cars and erm they he they settle on an amount of money that the car would be build for which a be totally unrealistic
S0521	in the sense that they couldn't build it for that small amount and b be still way above the head of most of the german population to buy
S0520	mm
S0521	so in fact the whole project be a disaster and it say that erm the only reason that volkswagen succeed be due to the corruption of the nazi party
S0520	mean what they subsidise or
S0521	presumably sell money to fund it
S0520	quite a history for the company isn't it i don't think that many people associate with the nazi party any more
S0521	and they they devise a payment system five five mark a week
S0520	five mark a week
S0521	so they be suppose people be suppose to save five mark a week and eventually buy the car three hundred and thirty six thousand people sign up to it but none of them actually ever get every get a car
S0519	oh no
S0520	mm people didn't really start drive cars until when like normal people the fifties
S0521	do you know that volkswagen the beetle be design by porsche
S0520	be it
S0521	porsche a man call porsche who of course famously start up the the porsche make but erm he be responsible for the design and subsequently take a share of the volkswagen company and now today he own porsche the porsche family own fifty one percent of volkswagen
S0520	of volkswagen mm
S0521	which be the biggest car company in the world
S0520	be it you don't see german cars in asia at all imagine they're have some competition now
S0519	you can't believe they can have cheat like that
S0521	i be just say to that there's
S0520	it's quite a disaster
S0521	a a there's a bbc and they've actually look into the the history of the manage director who apparently two things first of all be desperate to get into the us market
S0519	mm
S0521	and he publiclysaid that the emissions that they the us demand to to satisfy be too expensive to develop the technology for so he's quote as say that some time ago
S0520	america have stricter emissions laws that we do
S0521	stricter emissions than europe yeah
S0520	really that's surprise i didn't notice in houston that anyone be really that worry
S0519	no they well the they call buy a car
S0520	four by fours
S0519	so huge that it would cancel that out
S0521	well it's a little bite to do with diesel because americans don't like diesels never have and of course they always have a reputation of be polluters
S0519	yes
S0521	whereas in europe the diesel be a lot more popular
S0520	isn't it more efficient diesel
S0519	it's a a a less pollute
S0520	i think it be better yeah
S0519	in the modern diesels but now we're hear that in fact the the thing that they use to measure pollutants against diesel now have a different one that be worse
S0520	oh cool
S0519	so erm sadly we go down that road and now fifty percent of the cars in britain be diesel
S0520	because of volkswagen lie or because of a general deception
S0519	no because we the perception at that time be that certain things be the worst pollutants and diesel have less of those
S0520	oh
S0519	erm but now
S0521	that's true it's its co two emissions whereas
S0520	measure a different
S0519	yeah
S0521	diesel be apparently very bad because it it spew out particles little particles
S0519	and they didn't know about those at the time
S0520	i bet they do
S0521	which which be exactly very damage to the lungs
S0520	i bet they look at the report and stick it in the bottom drawer somewhere
S0519	develop a computer programme to annihilate it
S0520	so it create smog doesn't it diesel that's what i've hear
S0521	yeah so it's these particles which sort of be in the in the air that people breathe in
S0520	mm
S0521	which they think be really bad for you
S0520	mm thank mum it's nice that bread
S0519	it's lovely bread isn't it
S0520	mm
S0519	i i really quite like it chunky as well if you know if you have an if you have it like with some soup of something it feel
S0520	oh yeah i do as well but i don't enjoy the fact that i have to slice it before i eat it it's like one more step in the process
S0519	ah i must say i do usually have it slice but sometimes i just can't be bother to stand in the queue and wait for the little lady to notice my existence
S0519	and they don't have a erm
S0520	they should have like a self service shouldn't they
S0519	they don't have a bell or something you know they just er all you can do be wait
S0520	no that's true they should build a machine that normal folk can use just put it there
S0519	slice their hand off
S0520	it be quite hard to use i remember when i work in the bakery in it be quite hard to use the bread slicer properly like you know it have it sort of have there be a certain technique
S0519	it's get it out the other end keep it all together
S0520	yeah keep the slice together
S0519	and lift it onto the
S0520	and then it all get a bite squish
S0519	mm
S0520	i bet it's all still there
S0519	mm
S0520	have you ever have a volkswagen then no
S0519	i've drive one
S0520	mini's be volkswagen now aren't they
S0521	sorry

S0521	yeah
S0519	mm
S0520	get steal
S0519	do he like the picture of you when you be little
S0520	yeah mm i tell him about a gazillion time that i'm the youngest child but he always go oh you're the youngest
S0520	i don't know what it be he can't quite register it somehow
S0520	he's in the middle so
S0521	he have a complicate family didn't he
S0520	yeah lot of mother and father all over the shop
S0521	lot of step relationships go on
S0520	yeah the amaze part be how they all get together every friday
S0519	mm
S0520	all the various wive of his dad
S0519	quite incredible
S0520	i know they're all really normal about it i mean it's not that simple and his mother be a character as he put it she do make problems sometimes but erm somehow it evolve to be that you know she's sort of stay involve which be really good it's her children and it's her grandchildren
S0521	mm
S0519	mm mm
S0520	and erm and she kind of need support she's a bite well she's very ill for a start but she's also just kind of vulnerable mentally but for instance be the one be the stepmother
S0519	mm
S0520	the be the one who kind of say i mean not the one but kind of say that for the holiday that she'd prefer it if 's mum wasn't wasn't come to thailand
S0519	mm
S0520	you know like we could it be obviously never say that that be case but we could infer that it be her choice not only because she's a quite difficult person to have around but also you know probably there's lot of they be friends but i think there's lot of complications under the surface
S0521	yeah
S0519	mm
S0520	they be friends originally as well
S0519	oh god
S0520	so it be quite difficult and be
S0519	so remind me again
S0520	really different to her as well
S0519	let's have a recap
S0520	so 's mother be marry to this guy
S0519	mm
S0520	and have a child with him a son he that's the oldest brother
S0519	mm
S0520	they then separate and 's mum marry 's real father
S0519	dad mm
S0520	they have and they have 's sister they have two children together
S0519	mm
S0520	and then but 's dad assume the role of father fully over because the other guy disappear basically so really 's father completely raise
S0519	bring up the three children
S0520	bring up the three bring the older son up as well as his own in every sense
S0519	mm
S0520	and he be fully inside their family
S0519	mm
S0520	although he do have a relationship with his father now his real father kind of come back into the picture but it's quite sort of erm and i think sometimes i have the sense he have a bite of a chip on his shoulder about now be the real son
S0519	mm mm mm
S0520	of and the don't get along that well now
S0519	mm
S0520	not because of any blood reason i think you know it's more just different personalities isn't it
S0519	mm
S0520	and be the oldest brother he's a bite of a character as well he's quite arrogant sometimes and he's a little bite awkward with people he's not that easy to get along with at the best of time you know he have a sweet side but he's kind of no a bite bite different so that i think add to it's because erm 's dad in my from my perspective clearly prefer and his youngest son or you know clearly want to want to spend time with them or whatever you can tell in by
S0521	yeah
S0520	so then they break up and be about seven years old i think and then erm
S0519	do he stay with his mum
S0520	he stay with his mum and it be a really hard time
S0519	and of the three all three stay with the mum
S0520	they all stay with the mum and i don't know what do i know that him and his sister stay with the mum but it be very very bloody and awful
S0521	oh dear what the divorce you mean
S0520	the divorce it be really not nice and 's mum kind of be awful really
S0521	oh dear
S0520	and she be very erm break like you know so it wasn't a good time but somehow it's end up even despite that be quite mend which be amaze really and 's dad continue to see the all the time but he be much less around you know he also work extremely hard he's a doctor a very high profile doctor and he's all i mean what it be funny 's always not you know say that he wasn't there that much but like i i be talk to him and i be like so what be like when he be a child you know and he sort of like give a funny answer and pass it on you know and then say to me later you know my father couldn't answer that question cos he couldn't remember
S0521	he didn't know
S0520	he just didn't he just wasn't there
S0519	mm mm
S0520	you know but it's that kind of thing not that there's any resentment on 's part they actually get on really well and his father's a very erm i don't know how to describe he's a very moral principled good solid
S0519	mm
S0520	person you know he's really unusually so he's get a lot of integrity he's provide a lot of he's provide a lot of good example you know as well and i think really admire him in certain things
S0519	mm mm
S0521	mm
S0519	so then he marry
S0520	so then he marry again and it just so happen that have previously be the girlfriend of 's mother's first husband
S0519	oh my god
S0520	and they be friends subsequently so and then it again happen that come into the picture
S0519	oh gosh
S0520	and by that stage they be quite like in their early forties so immediately have a child
S0519	mm mm
S0520	and that's the youngest son and he i mean then the now the three of them be kind of
S0519	so when go back really the person he grow up with be his mum
S0520	more or less but as time go on i think he spend more time with his father as well
S0519	okay
S0520	so it doesn't seem to em that he's closer to her in fact it might even be the opposite
S0519	no it's a right and so he would he would potentially stay with the dad if he need to
S0520	he stay with the dad if he stay he doesn't stay with his mum cos it's just too difficult for them personally but they he see his mum a lot and he's the most care of her of all the children because the other children find it too her too difficult as a character and just have a lot of difficult you know problems really and i can see why she's very er erratic kind of person and she's quite and can be quite unpleasant
S0521	mm
S0519	mm
S0520	to she's manipulative you know she's get things where it's like mm but 's just a good boy and he's able he he grow grow out of it and now he you know he just try to take care of her the best he can and and er be around cos she's she have emphysema
S0521	oh right
S0520	and you know she's
S0521	what's his surname
S0521	i think i remember you tell me that yeah
S0520	yeah i don't know what her surname be so yeah it be quite complicate and there be a lot of internal her the sister and the mother have a lot of er tension between them but they still get together every week you know and she still be be very much part of the grandchildren's live as well i suppose when you have your own children there's a
S0519	it's easier
S0520	you want them to have the grandparents and not to want to keep them and value the family value be very strong in israel like the the kind of bond be be be be erm very you know whatever have go on as you can see in that whole mess of a scenario you know there's still a very strong sense of everyone have a certain commitment to each other
S0519	mm
S0520	which be how it always be family it's just different cultural
S0519	mm
S0520	mm
S0521	they all live close together then
S0520	yeah they all live in
S0521	same part of
S0520	within strike distance and the kid as well grow up in which be nice although they have consider leave er both of the couple well no i mean be a and his wife be kind of celebrities in israel and they love this life of urban life you know they're kind of that's their context
S0521	right
S0520	but the his sister be very much think about you know move out to a kibbutz or have more of a cos it's you know it's like bring i see that in cities in england you know bring your children up in the middle of the city it's quite er
S0519	and that's a special city you know with a lot more complications
S0520	mm well grow up in as well and so have his brother his younger brother go to an anthroposophical school
S0521	anthro what
S0520	anthroposophical anthroposophical
S0521	anthroposophical
S0520	you know er rudolph steiner it's a bite like
S0519	that's like in
S0520	we
S0519	camphill
S0520	camp oh it be camphill
S0521	camphill oh right yeah
S0520	in fact but it's also like what's it call in holland m m m
S0521	montessori
S0519	montessori
S0520	montessori
S0519	it's a little bite like
S0520	there be similarities
S0519	there be relations
S0520	yeah so not only because of that but he be quite an unusual sixteen year old i've meet other children who grow up within that system and it's quite an alternative approach to development and education
S0519	's son go to a steiner school
S0520	really so he's also a bite different isn't he
S0519	mm
S0521	yeah
S0519	yeah not er very bright
S0520	normal yeah
S0519	not erm
S0520	no i don't mean i don't mean
S0519	you know there's but the camphill community in be specifically for people will educational learn difficulties
S0520	mm that can be an aspect but no this be a normal school
S0519	this be yeah the same for theirs be a also a dual language so it be english dutch
S0520	cool mm
S0519	and they love that and they like that it wasn't just your average school
S0521	yeah
S0520	it's a great system erm and they in israel they make sure that at the end you there's a kind of diversion with the normal school curriculum and the normal school system so that you do end up qualify to go to university
S0519	totally yeah well he go he's get do maths at leiden
S0520	mm leiden yeah i remember you say but from what i i've meet a few people who go to those kind of school and what i've i've just notice that they're more innocent
S0519	mm
S0520	like you know when i be you know we when we be sixteen there be a lot go on
S0519	mm
S0521	mm
S0520	well you've work with sixteen year old you know what they're like
S0519	mm
S0520	ninety percent of time you're think about go out and have fun and boys and all of this but he's not like that at all
S0519	mm
S0520	he's get lovely friend but he's quite a sort of innocent naive boy
S0521	mm
S0520	he's a really sweet boy
S0519	i think that can happen as well if you're an only child
S0520	of older parent
S0519	and you haven't get of older parent
S0520	yeah
S0519	i think will be just the same
S0520	agree it's like a very protect environment isn't it
S0519	and even though she in a an an an ordinary school i think she'll be very protect and erm
S0521	mm
S0520	yeah there's something there isn't it like he's very adult and very use to adult company like be you know 's dad be seventy so similar to really
S0519	mm
S0521	mm
S0520	he's sixteen and 's a bite younger but she's in her sixties and they're both erm great
S0521	mm
S0520	you know still very live and both have their career go on and whatever but they're they're erm they're little family situation be just the three of them most of the time so it do make a difference i think
S0521	mm
S0520	but they're a sweet little family
S0519	mm
S0520	so yeah
S0521	yes so i be interest so so you be say the 's dad be seventy so he be bear in forty five but that be already in israel
S0520	yes so
S0521	they they they set up there be some sort of state then before the official it be forty eight wasn't it after the war
S0520	forty eight yeah i don't know exactly how it work
S0521	so something must have happen before that
S0520	it do and there be
S0521	cos they have already migrate immigrate
S0520	erm there be a zionist movement in europe in the nineteen thirties which wasn't directly connect to the holocaust it start before that
S0521	mm
S0520	so people have already start to go over in the thirties and set up farm and cooperatives jewish farm and cooperatives they buy land from the palestinians
S0521	okay
S0520	who live there at the time i don't know what the country be call before it be israel
S0521	be palestine
S0520	palestine yeah so they go over buy land and start up communities and this be happen already before the second world war
S0521	right
S0520	and then obviously in the lead up to the second world war and during it a lot more people start to move and travel and emigrate to emigrate migrate i'm not sure to israel to escape the persecution and i don't know what happen in these intervene years i think there be a lot of people in nineteen forty five nine when the camp be liberate almost all of those people go to israel
S0521	right
S0520	and erm i don't know why but i imagine it's almost similar to what's happen now it be like this be where our new home be this be where our better life can be you know because zionism wasn't common necessarily it be like a movement that start up later but
S0521	but erm his grandfather be be a prisoner of war in hungary be it
S0520	be it i think they be both in a concentration camp his grandparents in hungary and they escape
S0521	oh yeah it's not the right word prisoner of war be it
S0520	yeah no that's never mind
S0521	but they they they escape rather than they be liberate in forty five
S0520	they be they escape
S0521	yeah
S0520	and they erm go to israel in nineteen forty four forty five and then immediately i guess have a child but they join one of these communities cooperative communities that have already be set up which be later call the kibbutz but the people that originally go be zionists and very staunch socialists they be like
S0521	yeah
S0520	have a almost like a communist ideology of of
S0521	no
S0520	and they want to establish this kind of utopian life in israel that be their vision and that be the beginnings of israel really i mean it become an official state only afterwards but a lot of land be buy from the palestinian's before anyone draw any line and start to make things complicate and i don't even really know i'm sure i've be tell i don't really know how the the concept of the occupy territories come about i think it be slightly later there be a war
S0521	right
S0520	that erm the jewish or israeli army win and they claim land during the war and that be the occupy what the occupy territories be now
S0521	mm
S0520	and ever since then they've want it back
S0521	i've get the feel that be in the sixties actually
S0520	i think it be yeah so i guess in the first ten fifteen years there be just a kind of erm beginnings of the jewish state
S0521	yeah yeah
S0520	and you know build it up and infrastructure and so forth and some very idealistic leaders who come and then there be a retaliation from the neighbour countries
S0521	yeah
S0519	that's the hugely sad thing isn't it that it's really hard to understand why all the neighbour want israel
S0520	i know anti semitism
S0519	and israel have retaliate and fight for their right
S0521	anti jewish
S0519	and so on and you know you you only have to meet and remember that he's say that his grandparents lose all of their family to just feel that impact you know that this be a young man who have this history
S0520	mm
S0519	and he he's now he still have that history it's his grandparents it's not
S0520	yeah there be still people live in israel who who erm escape from concentration camp in in germany they're still alive you know
S0519	and erm so you know you you can't underestimate the impact of that but of course they show a terrible face to the world in their fight back
S0520	yeah aggressive
S0519	aggressive erm it it now feel the opposite it feel like they don't want the palestinians to have any land and that's not you know that's how it feel but it it's not the whole truth
S0520	mm
S0519	and we know that but it's erm it's it's really hard really hard to you know you just you don't understand why everybody why do iran and syria and all of these people why do they hate the jews
S0520	just anti semitic mean they only want there's only that's the only reason
S0519	but why where do it come from
S0520	yeah exactly it's true
S0519	why do you have to hate someone
S0520	it's really just silly isn't it
S0519	but then i mean it's huge i mean imagine say it be us if there's same country next door
S0520	next door yeah or all of them frankly
S0519	and they think you all should die
S0520	yeah
S0519	that's that's
S0520	well i think that's the justification between behind one of the justifications behind their aggressive military show
S0519	mm mm
S0520	you know whenever they be attack form one side they show with incredible force that they're not go to sit down and not retaliate and why because
S0519	and you understand that history their history be that they be totally persecute almost to the point of annihilation
S0520	exactly yeah
S0519	so now they're go to say
S0520	we be here
S0519	you won't be do that again here we be
S0520	and it's the it's the kind of enormity you know iran syria lebanon egypt jordan be the only kind of slightly neutral sit on the fence
S0521	peaceful aren't they
S0520	no idea why that be
S0519	thank god for them you know
S0520	you know all of these countries don't want israel to exist it's not like you know erm
S0519	we don't get on we'll just
S0520	we don't get on or we want to negotiate our border you know they say they want to annihilate it
S0519	mm
S0520	and it's kind of like if you don't show yourselves to be a very strong military force that's what's go to happen in that's their that's the idea you know
S0521	i suppose there's also the connection with the west isn't there cos the americans massively support israel don't they
S0520	they have do historically i mean obama less so
S0521	armaments
S0520	but clinton do very much so
S0521	mm
S0519	you can i i don't
S0520	there's a huge jewish population in america that have to be erm part of the reason
S0519	have be
S0521	i believe so yeah
S0520	but not only not particularly large but let's say influential
S0521	mm
S0519	well yes but i mean historically it's always be so but i i you can understand obama step back at the moment because
S0520	mm because yeah well netanyahu's a bite off the loop
S0519	israel appear to never want to have peace with the palestinians and you think you think they could they could try harder
S0520	you do yeah but then if you look historically they do try harder
S0519	i know you've say that and explain it before but
S0520	and you have and it didn't work out why
S0519	the other side also say you know well maybe they weren't ready then but they be now you know who who know you can't
S0520	mm it's difficult i mean like with gaza for instance first of all they be fire rocket into israel you're talk about the war last year you know that be what start the you know fight
S0519	mm
S0520	mm
S0519	we know that but the the
S0520	so they be much weaker but they're also
S0519	the little the little rocket be like you know throw a cricket ball
S0520	it's not quite like that they're land in people's home towns and stuff then who be in charge of gaza a terrorist organisation
S0521	the hezbollah
S0519	i know but what can the and the palestinians have vote for them
S0520	so why would europe stand for that why would europe stand in support of a terrorist organisation that doesn't make sense
S0519	they but they they're be vote elect
S0520	so it's ridiculous you know
S0521	they be elect yeah it's not not it's not hezbollah be it
S0520	they represent a completely wrong value system whether they've be elect or not you know they be the same erm let's say er
S0519	well we want
S0520	group of people more or less that have be attack america and europe and you know in in a way of of of complete violence it doesn't to me it make very little sense that europe take their side that side because of the history
S0519	mm
S0520	of why israel be establish in the first place you know we have a responsibility
S0519	europe take the side of the the huge underdog
S0520	it's no i just don't think it's an excuse it's an underdog but it's you know it's essentially
S0519	it's it's the same way like erm you know the
S0520	and they shouldn't i mean it doesn't make sense that to call them the underdog either in the wider picture because israel be a tiny country in the middle east
S0519	no you only have to look at the picture on the television you can't you can't deny that palestine be a very poor place and a place with erm where people be live in ruin and there's no education and hospitals and all of these things and that they're throw you know grenades at israel
S0520	it's not no
S0519	and israel be throw bomb back
S0521	rocket
S0520	it's not true at all
S0519	in in time at night
S0520	the only reason why the the only reason why we didn't see the devastate effect of the missiles that be be throw direct at
S0519	no but they're still huge i'm just say in term of size
S0520	it's not an argument
S0519	it's because that's what they've get erm so they be the underdog they be the the weaker erm they don't have that might they don't have the er capacity to inflict they have capacity to inflict some deaths
S0520	that's the nature of terrorism though be that these that be be they're group which be less powerful in term of military force
S0521	terrorism be the right word isn't it yeah nation
S0520	they take other type of violent action because they they're not they can't they're not an organise army
S0521	so it's terrorist against a nation
S0519	well i don't i don't understand that word
S0521	what
S0519	because palestine want to be a nation but israel won't let them
S0520	that's not how simple it be at all
S0519	but it's the truth
S0520	it's not no but what happen listen to what happen in the with rabin in the nineteen seventies they make an agreement
S0519	they tell me that before i know
S0520	they give the whole of palestine
S0519	but we can't go back to the seventies
S0520	no but listen to what happen they give the whole of palestine er to as er as a country they withdraw the jewish settlers from from the west bank they split jerusalem in half this be the deal what happen the palestine's the day after attack israel they didn't want that agreement they want israel to be go you know so they're not just want their own land and then we're all happy you know that's what the sensible good people on both side want but the not cool and not sensible people on both side want the other people to be go
S0519	don't yes
S0520	so that's the problem
S0519	erm
S0520	you know cos those that those two extremities will never find a peaceful solution now why do people give up you know in israel in term of and they haven't completely i mean the leave still represent those people who want a peaceful two state solution
S0519	but like you like you're say the trouble be that the majority of people in israel be vote for the right who won't negotiate
S0520	now they be
S0519	and the majority of people in palestine be vote for the terrorists
S0520	terrorists yeah
S0519	who won't negotiate and there we be
S0520	well yeah there we be bugger
S0519	stymie
S0520	stymie i mean i'm not
S0519	but
S0520	justify everything i'm just try to put it in perspective because the media in europe come give a very bias perspective of the situation
S0519	no i i i mean i start by say it do remind us of the truth of what's in the people just to meet and remember that his grandparents lose their whole family
S0520	not only that yeah
S0519	erm because it make it real again you know that this be the the reality for israel
S0520	mm and since then how many people have lose their sons and brothers and father in various war and situations and i know it's the same for the palestinians but that's you know a continue wind isn't it
S0519	it be the same for the palestinians time a thousand
S0520	of course much worse yeah absolutely there's also always a lot more deaths and so forth but yeah for sure
S0519	and they don't have a normal life leave they there's no
S0520	in gaza no they don't
S0519	in gaza there's nothing leave for a normal life they're live in a a war zone
S0520	mm
S0519	erm which like you say you just can't understand why they can't vote for the right people and make a make a solution
S0520	yeah well that's what people feel in israel as well you know 's family consider leave israel after the last elections seriously because they be
S0519	no i understand that
S0520	like the people who want there to be a constant effort towards a peaceful agreement and netanyahu be not on that boat
S0519	mm no
S0521	mm
S0520	he's just not interest but the point the problem be be that people be disillusion about the ability of politicians to negotiate
S0521	mm
S0519	mm
S0520	that kind of deal and people be distrustful of the palestinian's because they're maintain a
S0519	quite rightly
S0520	extremist government who aren't really not nice people
S0521	i find it's erm quite quite comparable with northern ireland in a lot of respect
S0519	i have always yeah
S0521	it's just full of hatred each side blame the other no progress and it's sort of a perpetual animosity isn't it which never get resolve
S0520	mm yeah and it's just like you know in south africa as well you know every day there be things happen to people which be racial as such in nature you know like encounter between arabs and jews within israel or whatever that erm be negative and people develop this opinion of each other this very hateful and negative opinion
S0521	mm yeah that's right
S0520	and there's no er that's very difficult to heal it's very difficult to change you know and that's what i see most israelis erm they even the best ones who have the most magnanimous vision
S0521	yes that word
S0520	and ability to kind of see beyond the all those feel
S0521	yeah yeah
S0520	you know they still feel very powerless really to but they don't feel like they have to defend their action even like for instance and his family who be as leave as it get basically and have always support the party and leaders who be dedicate to find a peaceful solution erm they still don't they're not apologetic about how israel respond to various aggression from palestinians
S0519	but the world be turn against them daily
S0520	the world be unsympathetic i know but you saw that in and i think it be a sort of very sad thing like in the gaza war last year obviously it be a disaster but what you do see happen in be anti semitic demonstrations and it's like how do people move into that
S0519	mm
S0521	where where be you talk about
S0520	no in germany in france
S0521	oh in germany
S0519	but it's it's well
S0520	what's it get to do with the fact that they're jewish for a start
S0519	well that's who's do it
S0520	i know but it can't like
S0519	so there isn't there's isn't we've say this and you say it it you it's really difficult to differentiate between israel and judaism it because the people have come together as jews from all over the world what do they have in common they're hungarian jews they're jews so so there's something in in the in the history even if it's not the religion so that's maybe people's ignorance but what they be say no to be the perception that erm the terrorists from palestinian drop two bomb and
S0520	this be completely not fair representation of what's happen but i'm just say you're exaggerate it in a way that's not fair
S0519	no i'm i'm just go to say they bomb i don't know how how long and how much but then the israel bomb for ten days or six days or something just all day and all night so it's like a
S0520	it's not really what happen
S0519	you know the people it be it be on the news on the television all day the reporters stand there
S0520	no but
S0519	in palestine and the place be just under constant bomb for days and days and days and days and days and it's like how many bomb do they need to throw to say stop
S0520	the first thing no fair enough it be a lot
S0519	well it be a lot erm
S0520	the first thing be be that they be constantly shoot missiles at israel
S0519	and it be for most people in the world to much yeah but it's still
S0520	and israel have this enormous defence dome over tel aviv
S0519	i know
S0520	but they're shoot missiles constantly towards tel aviv whether they hit things be another question but say that they drop two bomb over the border be not really
S0519	no they're try to but they're not successful
S0520	mm
S0519	because israel be mighty but just because they're try then israel obliterate them for days and days and days and days and days
S0520	they be target
S0519	you can't you can't justify that it's not justifiable that's why people stand up against it it's it's a you know it's send a a sledgehammer to hit an ant it that's what it be and that's what people be say for god's sake yes we appreciate you're under fire yes it's not right yes something should be do but be that it
S0520	it's a very big ant when it's the whole more or less arab world who want israel to be go
S0519	yeah but they're not fight the whole arab world there fight
S0520	yes but they be in a way you have to see that
S0519	palestine
S0520	no but you have see that it's all connect in that way as well
S0519	well i that's not what they're do when they bomb palestine they're not
S0520	it's partly what they're do it's partly what they're do
S0519	well it's not the world be quite rightly say that's not the way
S0520	yeah i know but i don't know that the world have a very fair perspective and it's not the world it's europe america have always be in support of it
S0519	and i think the world's right no no
S0520	yes they have
S0519	there be not there be not support for the bomb there be talk against it and there there be a lot of quiet from america
S0520	yeah that's true
S0519	which be note and erm even word that this need to stop now er
S0520	honestly i don't know what be justifiable any more i've see too much
S0519	but when be it ever that you can't justify that
S0520	i think you can if you look at the greater picture
S0519	there's no justification in war
S0520	that's a very idealistic thing to say
S0519	well it's true though and it's why
S0520	be it not justify to fight against the nazis of course it be i'm not say that's analogous i'm just say
S0519	yeah but then they think the same be true to get rid of erm
S0521	saddam
S0519	the saddam hussein you know he be a cruel erm dictator who would gas bomb people and they think that erm apart from the torture and the misery inflict on the people they think that he have they the weapons so they they go and fight him and and cause havoc
S0520	of course
S0519	erm
S0520	i i know i'm just say that in certain people's eye there be justifications for those type of action you know whatever from whatever side and and it's very complicate to say what's just and what isn't in that situation it's very very complicate and it's very deep in term of like how far it go back and what the overall implications be it's not just one thing you know that's all i'm say i don't agree with it i'm just say like from my perspective there's such a more complex picture and i find that the way that things be present in our in in european english media let's say be unfair
S0519	no i the trouble be be that you think well i i've no idea that how unfair they be i think the bbc be reasonable but probably erm the trouble be that it it be the same in ireland that both side believe themselves to be right
S0520	of course
S0519	and the weight of history be behind both side in a different way
S0520	mm
S0519	and therefore unless you can stop look back and look forward and stop rely on history's evidence to support your argument and your justification for carry on kill people nothing ever change
S0520	mm
S0519	and so i hate people say this be justify because of a b and c because it's not justifiable to kill people for any reason and
S0520	ultimately that's true but it's not the way that things work be it
S0519	well but then it it the how do you ever go forward if all you say be these be all of the reason why i have to carry on be a murderer erm that's what they do in ireland for generations
S0520	well i think honestly if israel would do that it would be go
S0519	no i don't think so
S0521	why would it be go
S0519	why would it be go
S0520	because because the if if they if they stop as if defend the their border and say we're not go to like let's say some some country attack israel and they don't retaliate they say no we're not go to do this any more what's go to happen
S0521	i think that's a different i i we be talk about terrorism here and you're talk about war
S0520	yeah but that's okay so two different things but
S0521	we're not talk about invasion i mean who who want to invade israel
S0520	well all of the arab leaders not all of them but the majority of them would would have speak about er invade israel and in fact annihilate it entirely so
S0521	mm
S0520	and they have i mean syria have invade israel lebanon egypt all in the last forty years
S0521	mm
S0520	so it's not like a un anyway it's a slightly different issue but
S0519	so yeah that's
S0521	i think it's a different issue to the palestinian
S0520	i'm just say if
S0521	because they be clearly erm relatively defenceless aren't they
S0520	yeah
S0521	and they do resort to small scale terrorism which be the only thing they can do
S0520	mm yeah agree agree i mean the thing two things be mix together as well because and as many people say they no
S0519	it's a miserable not not for the outside world and that's why there be demonstrations against israel
S0520	i understand why there be demonstrations but i also feel that people have a very like europeans that i've speak to over over the years and with in the company of israelis who want to talk about the situation have a very naive idea about this whole situation they don't know the history at all they don't know what's happen they don't know when even when israel be establish and why you know and it's like they have this kind of nice european leave wing kind of approach to things
S0519	but
S0521	oh could be yeah
S0519	mm
S0521	mm yeah
S0520	but they're not realistic you know you have to know the facts and you have to know the the historical context of that kind of a situation to understand why israel act like it do and and then decide whether it's justify or not you know on the surface on the face of it it seem like crazy behaviour agree but erm you know
S0519	the the the only thing be that there's there's will never be a way out unless the change what they're do
S0520	mm agree agree
S0519	so
S0520	and i think that's what people feel as well but like there's a i mean within israel there's a problem of erm i guess increase bitterness and also erm a stronger and stronger religious minority who be the people who be much who refuse to leave the settlements in the west bank and who would refuse to withdraw from jerusalem and so forth i mean they're the people who have the opposite view you know and they be become stronger because be increase in number a lot faster
S0521	mm
S0519	mm
S0520	mm so i mean the people who want who who have always want to seek a peaceful two state solution erm be be erm become outnumber and they feel desperate too you know nobody want to live like that do they
S0519	mm
S0520	like 's family really think about move away to america because they think there's no hope leave for this place you know
S0521	mm
S0519	mm
S0520	and what's go to happen now in a few years' time
S0519	mm
S0520	it's not optimistic and now isis and everything
S0519	horrible
S0520	mm
S0519	mm
S0520	i obviously have a lot of sympathy for them because you now these be my friends and they've be in army they're not like we just bystanders they you know have their whole live have be affect by this situation and
S0521	yeah mm
S0519	mm
S0520	and they've have to fight fight for their country in war situations and go to the west bank and see what people be like and see and be and see how people be treat on either side and so forth you know
S0519	mm
S0520	so it's pretty real erm
S0519	mm
S0520	but
S0519	horrible
S0521	cos who be the people in control in palestine it's not hezbollah be it it's the other one
S0520	hamas isn't it
S0521	hamas yeah
S0520	yeah hezbollah be
S0521	yeah i be go to say hummus but can't be hummus
S0520	quite like hummus oh hezbollah
S0521	hamas
S0520	hezbollah be the lebanese er terrorist group
S0521	yeah that's right yeah hamas
