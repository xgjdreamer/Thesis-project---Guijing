S0617	no no no so sunday and obviously with it be a bank holiday we're not open till ten the next day anyway
S0525	oh right oh i see
S0617	so that's why they've do it because there be leeway and then sundays on sunday they're let erm send round a email the other day of all the store and what time that they can close
S0525	right
S0617	so a lot of store be close at three o'clock on sunday
S0525	oh okay be you
S0617	we're not
S0525	you're not
S0617	we're stay open till five
S0525	oh how come
S0617	she do say you can open at ten and do ten four cos we've still gotta do the six hours cos we've gotta take the money erm but it
S0525	be everybody from your store go
S0617	a few of them be because they've get work on monday but i say i'm i've put myself in at half past eight on monday morning to prove my point because they're all moan
S0525	but you don't open till ten
S0617	no
S0525	oh
S0617	but we start at half eight anyway but
S0525	right
S0617	you know it'll be fine for the i'll i'll be fine anyway but that's why a lot of them aren't go but if they're not go now then they have to write a letter of apology because
S0525	do you know how many people will go to the whole thing do you know how many have even be invite how many
S0617	well if there's twenty s and what on average there's about no there's about twelve people in a store so twenty time twelve dad
S0622	er this be all the store be it
S0617	no this be just so
S0525	so it's mm
S0617	i be just work out as
S0525	twenty time twelve two hundred and forty
S0617	so that's two hundred and forty just from probably get the same amount from cos they have quite a lot of staff in their store
S0525	uhu
S0617	and then all the s as well
S0525	where where's the venue for this
S0617	somewhere in i dunno what
S0525	what a hotel or
S0617	er no it's like a rugby club
S0525	okay it this an annual event
S0617	er i think they do it every two years
S0525	every two years
S0617	mm but yeah no erm i speak to the about us close earlier or do like a different
S0525	yeah
S0617	time and they say you can do that however erm if you do do that and we do get complaints cos people have make a special effort
S0525	mm
S0617	to come to the to go to
S0622	yeah
S0617	at half past four and
S0525	yeah
S0617	you're shut at
S0525	yeah
S0617	four o'clock you know they've still get that half an hour they think
S0525	yeah
S0617	then we'll be send all the complaints directly to you and we won't be deal with any of them so i say no
S0525	yeah well that's fair enough cos people don't know that you've get an event and you're gonna shut the shop up unless you have a notice in the window for some time or you put it on a website or you send email i think you've gotta tell people if you're gonna do that
S0617	and there's a hell of a lot of people to tell really isn't there
S0525	oh absolutely yeah mm
S0617	well we're in and we could be we could make however much money in that half an hour
S0525	so will your work till five or till four
S0617	i dunno but i'm gonna i don't know yeah maybe till four
S0525	yeah especially if you're gonna go in at half eight in the morning let somebody else lock up
S0617	well yeah yeah yeah yeah well
S0622	yes
S0617	's in that day
S0525	and then be you gonna go straight to the to from there or be you gonna get come home
S0617	if i be to go
S0622	you'd be halfway there wouldn't you
S0617	yeah
S0622	well you're in the centre of
S0525	cos the
S0617	cos my days off ideally this week be gonna be thursday and sunday
S0525	yeah
S0617	however on sunday now there's only like eight of them work it's pay weekend and it's we've get a promotion we've get an promotion so it make me think there's nowhere near enough staff
S0525	mm
S0617	for what we're get on but they probably will deal okay if i'm not there but i dunno whether i should be there that's what i'm try to
S0525	well you could stay till five and just get to pick you up from work and carry on cos like you know your dad say you're part you're even halfway there
S0617	yeah
S0525	it's pointless come back to go again isn't it
S0617	no and i like you say i don't have to be there at the right time on sunday anyway i could get the train in
S0525	yeah
S0617	erm
S0525	yeah
S0617	cos i i don't i don't have to be there at ten o'clock that day do you
S0525	no
S0617	cos i'm just gonna go as an extra person i think
S0525	well take take the train and then erm and work till five and then get your outfit on and meet and
S0617	mm
S0525	go from there
S0617	yeah i'm not bother about do
S0525	it's probably the easiest thing to do
S0622	be partner go as well be there
S0617	who mr and
S0622	no no the sorry i mean
S0617	oh i think you mean like the partner in like the franchise
S0622	no right the franchise no
S0617	er yeah be go
S0622	right okay
S0617	well you get a plus one so i just say to do you want to go
S0622	yes yeah fair enough
S0525	and do he
S0617	i think so yeah we haven't actually say yes he's go but i think
S0525	free food and drink i imagine he's on it
S0617	yeah
S0617	yeah
S0622	know
S0617	like so then we've get the flexibility to you know
S0622	go away when you want
S0617	go away when i want to
S0622	yes
S0525	do you book your holiday you say
S0617	yeah i have ask her for it
S0525	september
S0617	yeah and i have write it down on the calendar now she didn't say yes or no she be like oh new york so yes
S0525	who be that
S0617	yeah so i will just write a note and give it her or i'll just send her something to say this be the week that i have book off just a you know
S0525	yeah good
S0617	yeah so that's good
S0525	and be gonna erm email some of the airbnb place
S0617	yeah he be gonna do that
S0622	good
S0622	that's nice excite
S0617	yes extremely excite
S0622	yeah
S0617	just need to book some yeah i think we narrow it down to one actually in the end the one without the sofa bed the one that dad pick
S0622	the the two bedroom one
S0617	yeah
S0622	well that be the best of the two it be only that be only a selection of two
S0617	yeah that be the two that we'd narrow it down to
S0622	oh anyway
S0525	where be it where's it base do you know
S0617	manhattan
S0525	yeah
S0617	they're both very central on that map anyway they be both
S0525	uhu and they're er apartments
S0617	so yeah apartments
S0622	yeah
S0617	yeah so the one have the view but it only have the one bedroom and one single bed
S0525	yeah
S0617	but there be a pullout bed in that single bed room so that could be like two bed in there
S0525	yeah
S0617	and then there be the sofa bed so again that's two
S0525	yeah
S0617	bed in there and it have a really nice view but i think like dad say if we'd have just be pay we'd have to like tidy up in the morning it's not like a bedroom that you can just quickly get ready the
S0525	what do the other one have then
S0617	two bedrooms erm
S0622	slightly more expensive the two bedroom one
S0617	yes
S0622	but only by about
S0617	hundred quid
S0622	ten ten pound a night
S0617	oh be it yeah actually yeah i think it be nine or ten
S0622	or five pound a night or something
S0617	yeah so it have two bedrooms a nice kitchen
S0525	uhu
S0622	there wasn't a view from there though
S0617	no no no no that be literally just look i think it look out onto a it look to me like a just a street
S0525	i don't think we'd be expect a view though
S0617	no and to be honest i think
S0622	you'd pay for a lot for one
S0617	yeah this one's
S0622	a nice view
S0617	very new very modern
S0525	one one bathroom
S0622	there
S0617	one bathroom yeah very new very modern well didn't it
S0622	yeah it be nice yeah
S0525	yeah and how much be that a night
S0622	two forty or something
S0617	two yeah two three i think
S0525	which would split four ways
S0622	between four yeah
S0617	er overall i think
S0525	so sixty quid
S0617	with the fee and everything fee sorry it be one one be it one thousand one hundred i think it be one thousand
S0622	i didn't see the total price
S0525	for the four nights
S0622	i saw the per night
S0617	for the four nights with the fee
S0525	so yeah two hundred and sixty quid each two hundred seventy yeah something like that
S0617	yeah
S0622	yeah for
S0525	and the flight be just under four hundred
S0617	i think so yeah yeah three hundred and eighty yeah
S0525	so six so six fifty ish at the moment we're up to that's alright isn't it
S0617	yeah and then like you say when we get there at the airport and stuff we'll just get erm whatever they be the train out there no yeah the shuttle thing
S0525	subway
S0617	the subway be that what it's call
S0525	that's what the underground's call yeah
S0617	yeah
S0622	subway
S0617	we'll just get the subway we don't need to get any like taxis or anything
S0525	interest what say about you have to be on the right side of the road to go into the subway do you hear her say that
S0622	they only travel one way on
S0525	if you go down
S0622	the
S0525	the subway you can't get to the other side of the line so you have to know which way you're go
S0617	oh when you're on top
S0525	cos the yeah so cos the the train follow the traffic
S0622	mm
S0525	yeah so if you wanna go that way you know you'd have to get on that side of the road and not that side of the road cos once you go down
S0617	oh
S0525	you can't swap to go the other way
S0617	oh okay
S0622	they like go one way well as long as well it's a one way system then so
S0617	yeah
S0525	so you'd have to cross the road and you'd have to go you'd yeah
S0617	down that way to go that way
S0622	right
S0617	mm interest
S0525	yes i think that which be something
S0622	mm
S0525	you wouldn't know unless you'd do it but i suppose once you know it then
S0617	yeah
S0622	yeah
S0525	straightforward
S0622	yeah
S0617	a lot of things should be walk distance as well shouldn't they
S0525	uhu
S0622	network map the they show you the roads they're all in block aren't they
S0617	yeah
S0622	all straight and in block
S0525	that's how the americans do everything
S0622	yes very organise it's no bend in the roads it's just straight
S0617	it's straight yeah
S0525	gotta decide on
S0622	it's a bid odd look actually
S0525	on a broadway show
S0622	yeah
S0617	will all different be show be on all the time or
S0525	yeah there'll be a wide variety i dunno not every single show
S0622	it's like london i suppose lot of different theatres and
S0617	will it be the same sort of thing as london it will won't it
S0525	yeah like the west end yeah small theatres they won't be big like the hippodrome
S0617	no how come you wanna do that
S0622	it be
S0617	just cos it's iconic to do in er in new york
S0525	i love show anyway so you don't have to come to one obviously if you don't want to just sort of
S0617	yeah no no no i'm just wonder why
S0525	well it's just cos we're there to see one
S0617	yeah well
S0525	yeah
S0617	and it be quite an iconic thing to do isn't it in new york watch a show on broadway
S0622	on broadway on that's right
S0617	yeah i saw a broadway street on the map the other day
S0525	i'd like to see one i've not see before i haven't well you'll have see cat
S0617	yeah
S0525	cos i'd i'd choose cat maybe if it be on
S0617	well if that's on why don't you see that
S0525	yeah
S0617	you can do
S0525	have you see phantom
S0617	mm no i don't think so have we see it
S0525	no i don't think i take you i saw i years ago before i use to take you to show
S0617	oh okay no i've not see that
S0525	mm
S0617	good
S0525	yeah just see it the once that be fine
S0617	yeah yeah no it'll be good won't it

S0525	it wasn't your sort of music i like it
S0622	four season music that isn't it very very good
S0525	it be mm cool
S0617	just need to decide on what else we want to do don't we
S0622	do a bite of search before we go see what's on
S0617	uhu
S0622	and what's there to see
S0617	yeah
S0622	and where they be in relation to where we be do do a bite of map do this this day that the other
S0617	uhu four full days'll be a lot though won't it it'll be plenty
S0622	that should fill it
S0525	i think it'll be erm enough i think we'll have plenty to do even if you just decide to go shop
S0617	yeah
S0622	yeah
S0525	fill your rucksack up
S0617	i wonder how much money we'll spend
S0525	depend how much shop you do
S0617	yeah
S0525	it won't be cheap
S0617	well it's
S0525	there
S0617	the combination i'd like to do there that's the most expensive surely
S0525	oh i dunno you might spend more on food you and out there
S0617	mm
S0525	for four days it depend if you want three meals a day
S0617	no well i be say again this be good with the aibnb isn't it get some cereal in
S0525	yes yeah
S0617	erm toast cereal for the morning so that's breakfast then isn't it and then you have the like you say you have cup of coffee and tea before you go out don't you so you don't have to buy them when you're out
S0525	well though i think stuff like that would could be cheap
S0617	you what sorry
S0525	things coffee'll be cheap it'll be the food i don't think
S0617	yeah
S0525	a lot of the food'll be fairly cheap you er it depend if you eat in the fast food restaurants and things like that i suppose what you wanna eat
S0617	yeah
S0525	it's good to get recommendations off anybody if any particular good place otherwise it's like any big city and you'll end up anywhere or
S0617	yeah say something about hell's kitchen i think there's a restaurant call hell's kitchen that'll be gordon ramsay be he in that
S0622	gordon ramsay no he's

S0525	and what do they talk about
S0622	erm events last week any come upcoming and forthcoming events things we ought to go to and things we think we'd like to try and stuff like that so it's just a summary and er ideas for er what we can do to improve the the sales really
S0617	sales mean how many people you get sign up
S0622	yeah yeah pretty much erm but it's all a bite hit and miss because erm people really just go to the place they're comfortable with er
S0617	yeah
S0622	and they er
S0617	they don't they
S0622	it's easy to get to and it's not outside and wet and

S0525	oh i think i think you do i think you say it be something that you want to do and he say he be look for full time but he would consider you for part time
S0622	this this job he want erm er well presumably he i dunno whether he's employ anybody yet cos there's nobody in the office i'd i i i know where they'd be they'd be employ but erm he he he seem to think it be a good idea that we er well i erm do a bite of the fundraise element at some stage but probably in the near future it'll probably be er further down the line
S0525	oh oh i didn't realise that i think it be
S0622	yeah but they it's
S0525	something they be just look at imminently
S0622	there be there be a the job be full now he want full time and i'm i don't want to do i don't want to do full time so

S0525	right
S0617	however many euro i think it be like fifty euro
S0525	do you have to pay
S0617	and we pay we have to pay it
S0525	yeah
S0617	and we try to explain you know
S0525	yeah
S0617	we this be our first time to venice
S0525	yeah
S0617	we've just buy a train ticket we've get on the train think
S0525	yeah

S0622	who know
S0525	cos you maybe could have use it er on a different day and you just validate it when you travel so you could have buy it for the day after maybe it hadn't get a date on so that's how they that's their system
S0617	they know what they're do don't they
S0525	well if it hasn't get a date on it you could you know you could use it at any time maybe
S0617	i don't know now i can't remember if it do or not but

S0622	like so
S0617	it be about a ten minute train journey
S0622	a big fine for
S0617	yeah it it be a ten
S0622	more than the so you might as well just take the fine and not buy the ticket then
S0617	yeah it be a ten minute train journey
S0622	ten minutes
S0617	oh yeah it be literally only from
S0525	but didn't you say load of people be try to complain at the other end or
S0617	yeah yeah about have them validate but it be only like the but what it be be you've get venice and then you've get the big that's on the island which be where everyone go to like the old bite so we be on just the normal bite and then there's just the train line that go from that bite to the island
