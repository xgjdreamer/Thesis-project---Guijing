S0655	cake
S0653	we're just try to work out instructions for a cake
S0655	so so
S0653	like what kind of
S0655	it's set to zero and we need to get it onto the line that's bigger than the tiny line but not the biggest line
S0654	okay
S0653	cos how much do we need
S0654	we need
S0655	a hundred and fifty
S0654	so we need the big line in the middle which be point straight at four
S0653	now can i just make a suggestion i tend to do dry ingredients first so i tend to do flour and sugar
S0655	okay
S0653	first because margarine be a bite messier
S0654	okay now
S0653	yeah
S0654	how much do we need for those ingredients let me see we need one five 0 so that's the same as
S0653	yeah
S0654	the lightly salt butter so it's caster sugar first
S0655	oh
S0653	i would get cos it's an all in one mix so you're just
S0655	shall i do it
S0654	well
S0653	why don't you do it together
S0654	so erm
S0655	right i'll tell you when
S0654	okay just
S0653	what i would suggest you do be put a little it in and then check and then a little bite in and then check how's it go
S0654	no
S0653	tell tell her if she's do it like er you can see you've get a little bite of a while to go haven't you
S0653	how be you do
S0654	yeah
S0653	you're on it well you've get a you've do a hundred haven't you hang on you haven't quite do a hundred and fifty have you
S0654	look
S0653	it depend where you're look
S0654	i be look
S0653	this
S0654	there
S0653	you that that black long line need to be right there's too much in there now but let me show you you need the line to be completely on the same bite tell me when you see it get to a hundred and fifty
S0654	it's in the big black line
S0653	be it a hundred and fifty now
S0654	yeah
S0653	yes

S0654	okay
S0655	no
S0653	yes it be
S0655	i not
S0653	you're look no you can't look at an angle you have to look at it from here can you see because if you look at it over there it'll appear differently
S0655	cos 's in my way
S0653	she's not in your way
S0654	oh
S0653	you can just look behind her so be it a hundred and fifty
S0655	no a teeny bite
S0653	hang on a tiny bite more you think
S0655	yeah a little
S0653	right
S0655	oh a tiny bite less

S0654	so you can pour these in here
S0653	so you can put all of the ingredients into that one good so what i also do be when i've finish use the sugar for example i'm gonna put it back in the cupboard because then there's no chance of me confuse it with something else you know how in the bake off they often use salt instead of sugar and all that kind of thing
