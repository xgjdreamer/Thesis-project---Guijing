S0008	and then because that's sort of double width like the garden be split down the middle and the bottom half of one bite of the garden
S0012	oh that's the other bite
S0008	so they've get a garden there
S0013	yeah

S0013	every time i put the number in or whatever they give you
S0012	it go wrong there
S0013	yeah
S0008	oh really
S0012	yeah
S0013	i give up
S0012	mm
S0013	do it twice like that
S0012	yeah now there's no need to do it any more so
S0013	well i've get one more to do
S0008	well there could be you see you know just cos you're
S0012	well
S0008	not earn
S0012	do i do i hear it right that they're go to tax pension at source
S0008	no
S0012	surely that em
S0008	no
S0012	he say no won't it
S0008	no cos it i mean it's
S0012	well this be what clegg be talk about there should be
S0008	no no no no no no oh no they might have be talk about private pension
S0012	oh right yours be a private pension isn't it
S0008	not state pension
S0013	mm
S0008	see it's it's the thing be about private pension right
S0012	yeah
S0008	be that your state pension use up not all your personal allowance but most of it
S0012	yeah
S0008	so anything you get on top of that be tax
S0012	tax yeah
S0008	at twenty percent
S0012	yeah
S0008	so what they're say be that instead of them pay you
S0012	oh i see
S0008	but i think 's pay
S0013	instead of tell you cos
S0008	i think 's bro pay his tax be tax at source
S0012	be it yeah
S0008	yes it be yeah definitely
S0013	ours wasn't
S0012	no
S0013	cos we we didn't have much anyway
S0012	no we didn't no
S0013	but we take it lump sum and then
S0012	and lose a thousand pound
S0013	then get a yeah
S0008	yeah um you should ask for advice
S0012	i should have ask for advice yes
S0008	when you're meddle within you don't have to go out
S0012	well that's true we should have ask our money guru here
S0013	we should have do yeah
S0008	but the um yeah i mean he pay tax on his pension but it doesn't matter at the moment because he'll have to pay tax anyway
S0013	but i'm not sure if it's take away first isn't it
S0008	well
S0013	then you don't know how much you can take
S0008	well that's right i mean the thing be
S0013	you might as well if you
S0012	yeah
S0013	they give you a horrible bill
S0008	yeah that's right but you see there's this thing that most people don't want to do a tax return do they
S0012	no they don't no
S0008	but theoretically if you've get a state pension and a private pension you really should do a tax return
S0012	yeah
S0008	because there's all sort of you know things that you could get money back
S0012	money back for
S0008	and uh cos you forever read the fact that um you know these people these pension company that be get your cod wrong you know what i mean
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	so they're take off a lot more than they should be do
S0012	true
S0008	and stuff like this and people never bother to at the end of the year you know
S0012	check up on them
S0008	just check up they just you know happy for what they can get
S0012	yeah
S0008	whereas in fact if you do a tax return you know you get exactly
S0013	mm
S0008	you know everything come out in the wash yeah doesn't it
S0012	that's right
S0013	yeah
S0008	you know i mean whether you pay too much or whatever or who pay what and blah blah blah it all come out in the wash you know
S0013	mm
S0008	yeah it sort itself out
S0013	mm
S0012	but i i this government be just rip people off they all
S0013	they couldn't possibly tax your state pension cos you're under the earn anyway aren't you since
S0008	no it's well outside
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	that's right you under the earn
S0013	yeah
S0012	but if you do earn would they take it off at the source then if you
S0008	and if you be work
S0013	but no it would be take off your work
S0008	if you it would be take off your work
S0012	yeah but if you're self employ you'd send a tax form in wouldn't you
S0008	you'd have to
S0012	yeah
S0008	ah but if you work and draw your pension that in that case it should be tax at source
S0013	mm
S0008	couldn't
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know what i mean
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	because you get your tax allowance on your
S0012	on your
S0008	on your paye on where you're work
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	and then come in extra doesn't it
S0012	yeah
S0008	so it should be tax at source
S0012	yeah
S0008	but i mean i mean how many people
S0013	you're allow to earn
S0008	do that affect
S0013	like four thousand aren't you include your pension something like that
S0008	when you're at the moment when you're sixty five your tax code be something like nine five something
S0012	mm hm
S0013	yeah
S0008	which mean you can earn nine thousand quid
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	and your pension be what seven thousand or something like that
S0012	yeah
S0008	for an individual
S0013	that's include that isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0008	right so you're allow to you earn another couple of thousand a year
S0012	before you hit tax
S0008	before you even start pay tax
S0013	mm
S0008	but that be the other thing be they be say that that at the moment you know when you're sixty five you know because before your personal allowance be six thousand seven hundred
S0012	yeah
S0008	and when you're sixty five it be nine thousand right
S0013	right
S0008	you know to allow for that thing
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know that you keep more of your money
S0012	yeah
S0008	but now the personal tax be eight thousand six hundred but they haven't put up the nine thousand whatever it be for
S0012	for the pension
S0008	for the pensioners
S0012	yeah
S0008	so a lot of pensioners be say oh you know we're lose out we're lose more and uh no you're not lose out because you're just not gain
S0012	no you're not gain
S0008	you know what i mean
S0012	yeah
S0008	then all these arguments our pension be lose out it mean they're not really lose out they're not just gain as much as they have in the past
S0012	no that's right
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you know
S0012	all these
S0008	it be
S0012	ways be all these ways that you can what what they don't call fiddle tax but evade tax be it
S0008	mm
S0012	be it tax evasion or tax
S0008	well there's what arethe two term one be to one be
S0012	tax evasion
S0008	evasion and one be
S0012	tax avoidance avoid
S0008	avoidance yeah i don't know anyway but one be legal and one isn't
S0012	one be legal and one be yeah
S0008	cos it be a it's a basic rule with anything with uh tax or anything like that if you can find a loophole which mean you don't have to pay
S0012	yeah
S0008	then you're quite within your right to use it
S0012	of course you be yeah
S0008	you know and that's until they close the loophole of course
S0012	yeah
S0008	which be what's happen and i'm sure that in the past the tax system have be devise to tax the poor people
S0012	yeah
S0008	and to not tax the rich people
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	or not as much
S0013	yes
S0008	but nowadays you see you're get more and more people jump over from be poor to be rich
S0012	yeah
S0008	and these people be exploit every loophole they can find
S0012	they can get yeah
S0008	and other people be then see it and they be try it as well so in fact the tax loss be get bigger and bigger
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	do you see that amazon
S0012	yes
S0008	pay something like three million tax in three years or something like that corporation tax
S0013	yeah
S0008	after make a billion a year or something
S0012	a billion a year yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	cos they're register in luxembourg
S0013	ah i see
S0008	then they've get an office in luxembourg with about a hundred and fifty people in it
S0013	ah
S0008	and all the money go there
S0012	yeah
S0008	and so it's not
S0013	yeah
S0008	but i mean on the other hand they do employ thousands of people in this company
S0012	oh yeah that be a point
S0008	they're pay paye
S0012	but
S0008	and all them drivers as well packers and drivers and
S0012	yeah and there's lot of company
S0008	and they put a lot of people out of business you know
S0012	lot of company register with in ireland as well
S0008	ireland that's microsoft oh no apple
S0012	apple yeah
S0008	apple be register in ireland
S0012	and sony
S0008	that's right yeah cos they only pay ten per cent tax out of the twenty six per cent
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	but this be one of these things like when ireland be well be sort of basically bankrupt but that's only half the story because these other big company which officially have get massive export
S0012	yeah
S0008	from ireland
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	but it's always a global citizen it's get it's get um so that countries don't actually mean much any more
S0012	that's right
S0008	when it come to finance the only way they can get money be through vat and paye
S0012	yeah
S0008	really
S0012	yeah that's right
S0008	and that's why vat keep go up
S0012	twenty per cent
S0008	because you know you can't avoid pay that there's no well
S0013	mm
S0008	you can if you're a foreigner cos you can claim it back can't you
S0012	yeah you can claim vat back if you're if you're self employ and you're register with vat
S0008	yeah that as well but i mean that's a business thing but maybe
S0012	yeah
S0008	if you go to the west end and buy anything and show them your passport your foreign passport
S0012	oh right
S0008	you can get it vat free
S0012	be that why all these people get foreign passports
S0013	no
S0008	but you see it's but then when you go out into your country
S0013	mm
S0008	you have to declare it and pay
S0012	pay custom tax
S0008	custom duties you see
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	or if you're like me you buy something in this country full price go to germany and then pay it bloom again when they stop you and catch you god
S0012	that happen to you do it oh dear
S0008	i go there one christmas right and uh i buy a stereo system

S0012	yeah
S0008	no one will notice you know what i mean and like
S0012	that's like they do
S0008	and like all the house in there

S0008	you know they build these roads and they have like a little spur road go off with a cul de sac and a turn bay at the bottom
S0012	that's fairly it yeah
S0008	you know to stop sort of through traffic
S0012	yeah
S0008	i suppose to make it more friendly they've allow one car park space per house that park space be half on the road half on the footpath
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	and it's actually paint on the foot path which leave
S0013	be it really

S0008	so you can't turn around
S0013	around
S0008	you know what i mean

S0012	and he couldn't fill his kettle up properly you know without all this other without
S0008	yeah
S0012	all this help
S0008	yeah
S0012	that he get from social service he get all this help
S0008	yeah
S0012	from to turn his tap on and
S0008	mm hm
S0012	and do things and they cut his money off cos he refuse to take a job
S0008	mm hm
S0012	you know some terrible job
S0008	yeah but i mean you read it so often and it's not just that it's like when we be kid and that
S0012	yeah
S0008	they cut the money off and then they say well we're sort it out and then it take like
S0012	six months
S0008	six months to sort it out
S0012	yeah
S0008	these people be suppose to live with no money
S0012	that's right
S0008	for six months
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	i mean the trouble be that every time you read a story like that the next page you read about someone who's you know write some get a get a get a get a house get a house in spain and five alias' which be all claim money off off the dole
S0012	oh there's a program on television call rip off britain be it rip off britain something like that
S0008	something like that yeah
S0012	and uh this bloke that get thirty thousand quid from social service
S0013	mm
S0012	and he'd get two or three passports
S0008	mm
S0013	yeah claim for all these different things
S0012	and he'd claim for all these different things
S0013	mm
S0012	and he be claim house allowance which he own the house he be live in
S0008	mm hm
S0012	and he be let the house out
S0008	mm
S0012	to to other people
S0013	yeah cos he'd get all these different address as well
S0012	yeah
S0013	all these house
S0008	but the other trick they use to do be like they use to have like kid you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they'd lend the kid to the people who go with them and say i get five kid
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then the kid turn around and say i've get five kid
S0008	and they can then they're be some complaint because they be finger print children
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you know to keep the check oh no you can't do that you can't do that
S0012	civil yeah civil right you can't do that
S0008	but i mean that there be that people i don't know if they're the ones you be talk about you have this secret room in the house
S0012	oh yes yes
S0008	with an office
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they sort of uh when they bust them they have to sort of break into this secret room and this room be an office right
S0013	mm
S0008	and they have like all the paperwork like thirty different passports
S0012	that's right
S0013	oh right
S0008	and all the paper and stuff and everyone
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know they be just claim leave right and centre from everyone weren't they
S0013	mm
S0008	and load of cheque come in all over the place
S0012	all over the place yeah fantastic you know
S0008	it's what make me think
S0013	yeah
S0008	you know and you think that the social service would be able to check up on something like that
S0012	of course she would
S0013	she would
S0012	what's go on
S0008	what if it have be well i mean
S0013	yeah
S0008	nowadays they pay money into bank account right
S0012	yeah
S0008	if they have more than two payments into one bank account they should like mark up share right
S0012	what's go on yeah
S0008	you know i mean nearly people can have half a dozen bank account
S0012	yeah
S0008	but then there's some sort of i mean there must be some check they can do
S0012	well then there must be if if they're if they write out cheque to to this bank account week in week out week in and week out there's get to be something wrong somewhere in here there must be check as you say
S0008	i would have think so
S0012	there must be a computer program would sense would would
S0013	yeah
S0008	yeah it seem that they're for all this sort of link up computer program and do this and hunt down terrorism things that it seem that they haven't get a bloom clue really when it come down to it
S0012	no
S0008	you know
S0012	no they haven't how much the day that they say on the television the other day or on the radio that be a company i can't remember which one it be on i be watch oh it be on the nhs fifty billion million or something like that
S0008	a trillion hurillion
S0012	yeah
S0008	all the money in the world
S0013	yeah
S0012	and that's all be waste
S0008	yeah
S0012	because the the computer program be now obsolete
S0008	mm
S0013	yeah
S0012	and they can't even use it

S0008	and then oh oh wow but it do but she do get a really good deal with it
S0012	yeah
S0008	and what happen be be that when you top up like you can get a ten pound top up which be just as you go
S0012	yeah
S0008	with
S0012	pay as you go
S0008	you know half a dozen you know well so many free minutes and

S0012	oh right
S0008	for a month
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then you can and then you can go and get another fifteen quid's worth and then you can but it's get this thing on it you this thing on it call um google map navigator which be the same as a as the sit nav
S0012	yeah
S0008	right and that's what she want it for
S0012	oh right
S0013	yeah
S0008	she's get her own sit nav on her phone because you can use it when you're walk around as well it's really good
S0012	but doesn't that use a lot of battery
S0008	doesn't seem to
S0012	don't it cos they reckon that walkers people who walk on the moor and what have you use the sit nav on the phone so much that they've run out of battery and then they get lose and they don't know where they be
S0008	yeah but they uh the the thing about this be that you try to you simply will try to work out use it
S0012	yeah
S0008	but it's get all it's get like everything on it you know it's quite amaze like the internet oh oh oh
S0008	wow

S0008	but she say oh when you're on your own and you're drive you don't know where you're go
S0013	yeah
S0008	or what you're do and stuff like that it's really handy
S0012	yeah that's right
S0013	yeah
S0008	and you can just like
S0013	yeah
S0008	click the thing and
S0012	yeah
S0008	and it tell you where to go
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	that be a good idea
S0008	no tell me where you be as if well look you realise you don't want to know where you be what you want to know be where you're go
S0012	where you're go yeah
S0008	you don't care where you be

S0008	so they can you know and sarah say oh you you know be you chuck out be you give any of them away and be there oh well we get this one which be not very good and we can't upgrade it and it's a bite useless you know and i'll have to i'll ask whether you can have it you know sort of very reluctant
S0013	mm hm
S0008	and then i realise that sarah have always be a big thing about she really hat be lose you know and sort get this sort of
S0013	oh
S0012	yeah
S0008	this sort of
S0013	mm
S0008	you know like some people be really worry about
S0012	yeah
S0008	some things and other people
S0013	yeah
S0008	this sort of paranoia about find place
S0013	mm
S0008	and you know forever you know drive round and round the m twenty five for the next five years
S0013	yeah
S0008	you know
S0012	well even with the sit nav
S0008	mm
S0012	we've actually put where we want go in the set nav and it be only last year when we be come home and it say turn right now turn leave turn leave take the next leave turn take the next leave turn take the next leave turn and i go fine there's the road
S0013	yeah we've
S0008	you're drive round
S0013	do
S0008	in circle
S0012	there's the road
S0013	we do it again and again didn't we
S0012	again yeah and we keep go round there's the road the road we want to go to
S0008	uh huh
S0013	so now we go a bite further this time and it still turn leave
S0012	and it still take us round we go up there and then it tell
S0013	once you get
S0012	you turn there and then it tell you turn there then go back in that bite again there's the road then we we
S0013	yeah but every time we go on the you know
S0008	why you're try to get on the main road
S0012	we're try to get on the main road
S0008	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	cos that's the trouble there cos when you look at the map you're never quite sure whether it go under or join
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	ain't it
S0012	yeah
S0013	whether it's one way system
S0008	yeah

S0012	oh right
S0008	you know what i mean
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	and it say that yeah you don't need anything else and i think well have already get that i wouldn't bother to buy one

S0012	what
S0008	it be a set nav and it turn into a television
S0013	wow
S0008	and it be only about thirty nine quid or something
S0012	oh god
S0008	forty quid
S0013	we're get that
S0012	have one
S0008	i know they always be worth it you know what i mean no
S0012	have one that it's he he plug into his car and then have get g force or whatever you call it a ten g or four g or whatever
S0008	mm
S0012	i don't know
S0008	four g
S0012	four g be it
S0008	that's the latest
S0012	be it it's get all that business in it stick this thing in his don't you with this aerial stick out and a blue light go bing bing bing
S0008	yeah
S0012	and uh he's get the sit nav will be on and then that will tell you someone be try to phone you
S0008	mm hm
S0012	and uh you answer the phone through the sit nav and you just carry on talk through the sit nav
S0008	that's that's what i've tell me want me to buy that
S0012	yeah
S0008	she want a hand free
S0012	hand free
S0008	bluetooth thing where you can
S0012	bluetooth that's the thing
S0008	that's right and apparently you can talk to your telephone
S0012	yeah
S0008	through it and it and you know and also she didn't know but she think you could actually turn your your google map thing on
S0012	yeah i believe you can with the it just
S0008	yeah know and then it give you all the directions straight into your earpiece
S0012	yeah
S0008	turn leave
S0012	yeah
S0008	turn right
S0013	no that way
S0008	yeah
S0012	that's what it should be
S0008	u turn
S0012	yeah
S0008	when the road be clear
S0012	yeah make a u turn
S0012	no i'm now go down the a one
S0008	i can't see why you need to do that why don't you just take the next see wherever you be it should be able to work out the directions
S0012	they do don't it
S0008	yeah
S0012	i mean we be come home and we're drive through a field
S0008	mm
S0012	accord to the set nav
S0008	mm
S0012	right the road be over here and we're bump along through this field
S0008	that's cos you never you never pay to have it upgrade
S0012	that be true
S0008	you know if you think to have how much be it thirty quid or something
S0012	yeah
S0008	you get the upgrade
S0012	and then we we go towards birmingham you see and it say uh at the next roundabout turn right no roundabout
S0008	mm
S0012	all it's get be a flyover where you're suppose to turn leave
S0008	yeah
S0012	and then turn right and go over the fly over
S0008	but you still need your wits about you
S0012	you still need your wits about you you really do
S0008	but i reckon um you know most of the time you don't really need them cos like go cross country
S0012	well that's
S0008	you just follow your nose don't you really
S0012	yeah the only time i think you need them
S0008	be when you're get
S0012	be when you get in a big place
S0008	yeah when you get to the town
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you're try to find
S0012	yeah
S0008	the address
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know or you're try to get there
S0012	i go to um from here which be gloucestershire alright there's three different ways or four different ways you can go
S0008	mm
S0012	right one be up tho king's lynn
S0008	across the
S0012	and across that way
S0008	yeah
S0012	one be
S0008	cambridge
S0012	down and through cambridge the other one be down towards oxford right
S0008	mm hm
S0012	and the next one and that will take you down the m twenty five down in london
S0008	mm hm
S0012	and then round that way
S0008	but you see
S0012	the best way we find be
S0008	for a lot of
S0012	the cambridge one
S0008	for a lot of people they'd much rather drive on the m eleven the m twenty five m twenty five to the m four m four
S0012	yeah
S0008	yeah like that stay on the motorway probably quicker actually you might be do an extra fifty or sixty miles
S0012	and if you look on the google map thing uh one be ten minutes longer journey another one be fifty minutes longer journey but shorter you know
S0008	but that road which go through um royston and baldock
S0012	oh be it eight five o five aren't they
S0008	yes
S0012	yeah
S0008	oh that's a lovely road
S0012	that be it's a beautiful road
S0008	and they've build it all out and
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know and wipe out
S0012	a scenic road and you
S0008	that's right i mean that be a really pretty road
S0012	that be a good road
S0008	and it's yeah i mean i depend on the time of day i suppose but i mean there's very few hold up there
S0012	no we be
S0008	when we be go cross country i always i like that road
S0012	i like that road yes
S0008	cos it's it's um it's all nice
S0012	that be a nice road and when they dig it and out throw in all that chalk
S0008	that's right yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	put a bite of a tunnel in it on there stuff
S0012	put the tunnel in and um yeah
S0008	once that first chip norton be it
S0012	chip norton yeah
S0008	which be the only hold up there you go you go through the town centre
S0012	yeah
S0008	but then that's sort of like
S0012	but you use to have to go through baldock won't you to get to the a one that must be right
S0008	that's right yeah yeah
S0012	but now you don't and you just go down there and you start with the a one
S0008	that's right
S0012	yeah
S0008	yeah
S0012	yeah it's quite easy everything be quite easy i suppose
S0008	and even like if you go through the luton to the m one
S0012	yeah
S0008	that's an easy route
S0012	that's another easy route yeah
S0008	you know perhaps half a dozen traffic light that's all that be
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know there's all all the road have be build out
S0012	but we go on the a fourteen and that be a really really
S0008	mm
S0012	nice road that be a really nice road
S0008	what's that one through bedford
S0012	ah
S0008	cambridge bedford

S0012	the a fourteen
S0013	it be very easy and
S0012	and so easy
S0013	i know i didn't drive but
S0008	mm
S0012	it be so easy
S0013	it be a lovely journey
S0008	yeah i quite like map
S0012	yeah
S0008	don't you
S0012	yeah
S0008	you when you sort of like know where you be when look at the map and
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	give you something to do when you're sit in the car
S0012	you read the map all the time in the car don't you
S0013	yeah you still need the map
S0008	when i read the map
S0013	but i lose track of where how far down the
S0008	oh
S0013	a whatever it be we be
S0008	oh right
S0013	and i'm think that's exeter and i think why don't you just go across
S0012	yes that's right
S0013	the middle
S0008	's terrible at read map she's good but when i read a map i like to sort of have me finger and i know exactly where we be
S0012	where you're go
S0013	mm
S0008	at any one time you know and
S0013	well i just didn't expect
S0008	and uh
S0013	i expect we're turn off in a minute didn't i
S0012	yeah
S0013	we should be turn off in a minute and we couldn't seem to be
S0008	but will say okay yeah we're on the right road so carry straight on she's get the map up and for us then and i'm drive along right we're at a roundabout which way do we go now oh hang on a minute i'll just oh what page be it i'll say alright i'll just drive round and round the roundabout until you sort yourself out
S0013	oh no
S0012	oh there be one roundabout we yes
S0008	and then she wonder why i get exasperate
S0013	i remember before we have the sit nav look follow that red car yeah it's go and you didn't do you
S0012	no
S0013	mm oh mad you go mad
S0012	i can't remember ever go mad
S0008	you see if i'm ever go on a journey which i don't know where i'm go or i get to turn off somewhere i'll have the journey in the head and i could remember most of it
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	and then as you get to turn off on some sort of like weird slip road or something like that i'll get up google map and look at it
S0012	yeah
S0008	so i can remember oh yeah you're come along here and there's
S0013	mm
S0008	and then follow it down and or this you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	you like more or less know what i'm gonna do so then i can you know basically remember where i'm go
S0012	can you
S0008	yeah
S0013	but in the past if you take the wrong turn then when you go down there again you think oh yes we go down here
S0008	mm
S0012	yeah
S0013	and you go wrong again
S0012	where'd we go where we be go along the road sit nav be tell us where to go down here turn right on the next road turn right turn right and it's down a farm track and that say at the bottom or halfway down this road if you get a sit nav you've come the wrong way didn't it
S0013	yeah
S0012	no if you get a sit nav you're they've send you the wrong way turn round and go back that's what it say

S0012	sure you could
S0008	proper roads and stuff
S0012	yeah
S0008	but like you know i mean
S0013	i haven't be out i suppose yeah it's for find it's not not for find the place you know

S0012	that's right
S0013	yeah
S0008	you can't leave it at all
S0012	but this time sometimes they build stupid though don't they
S0013	mm
S0012	and then she say we're drive along the right road and all of a sudden it say at the next turn turn around and when when you can turn around you have to go the wrong way or something and it do it all the time and you you say stupid woman you're go the right way

S0008	i mean the thing be if you go i mean if you're stay in a hostel or a bed and breakfast at least they get dry room and stuff

S0012	i be tell him about that day we go round to look at this youth hostel that we'd stay in before we couldn't get out the car could we
S0013	couldn't get out the car go all the way there and couldn't it just wasn't worth get out of the car
S0008	i think we get damage in that
S0013	it get
S0012	yeah there be a little bite there
S0008	i think have a bite of wood fair there and polish it up
S0012	no no no yeah
S0008	be that why you get it cheap
S0012	it's authentic
S0013	well which one
S0012	it be definitely wood
S0013	the one you get some money off
S0012	it be definitely wood
S0013	yeah
S0012	it didn't have a lot
S0008	i only notice cos
S0013	it didn't risk
S0008	they come on the side
S0012	we didn't we didn't even look on the side of them we just oh great we look at the top like you look at your car
S0008	yeah that's right exactly exactly
S0008	and you just think it's alright tell everyone else how to do it but
S0012	yeah
S0008	when it come to do it yourself you know
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	cos now i mean fine you finally get around to buy a new television as well
S0012	have you oh wow
S0013	mm
S0012	and still
S0008	didn't want to spend much
S0012	be it you have before
S0008	that's right
S0012	yeah
S0008	we didn't want to spend much so we buy this sort of when i sort of look at it it look alright you know i buy it and they send us we really want the twenty four inch one
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they send us a twenty six inch one by mistake
S0012	do they
S0008	so you don't know whether that's a good or a bad thing but set it all up the picture be crap it really be
S0012	be it
S0008	yeah
S0012	yeah oh wow why be that
S0008	no i've get a feel it's probably the aerial
S0012	oh
S0013	yeah
S0008	it might be because if you get an old film picture's brilliant well yeah
S0012	mm
S0013	yeah
S0008	like an old cowboy film or something really good picture you get it on football or something like that then you know you can adjust it so its a good picture
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then you go then if you click on another station or itv it's all sort of that wash out colour
S0013	mm
S0008	you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	it's very very iffy
S0013	i remember our pixated a lot didn't it
S0008	god
S0013	especially bbc
S0008	yeah but i've
S0013	for us
S0012	do you know what you can
S0008	yeah you can you know you can set the picture on uh a cool wall
S0012	yeah
S0008	or usually you can set up a user
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	or dynamic i think there's all these different things
S0012	dynamic yeah
S0008	which give you a slightly different and i find that yeah every time we get on a different program i just sort of click through the options of the picture to get the best picture
S0012	wow
S0013	mm
S0008	but you don't want that do you
S0012	you don't want that
S0008	and
S0012	what be it panasonic be it
S0008	no it's a haier or something like that
S0012	oh right
S0008	some german make
S0012	well what we have to get or we i've get put up
S0013	mm
S0012	here be a what be it call
S0013	booster thing
S0012	a booster an aerial booster
S0013	an aerial booster
S0008	when i think when i
S0013	it's be a bite better since wasn't it
S0012	yeah it's be alright mostly yeah
S0008	yeah
S0008	yeah
S0012	we have get a booster up there
S0013	yeah
S0012	but i have six televisions work off one booster while they didn't work with one cos we didn't have six televisions
S0008	mm
S0012	but when we build the house i wire it all up
S0008	yeah
S0012	so that there be a television in every room
S0008	mm hm
S0012	so we have to have a six room
S0008	yeah
S0012	booster cos we have on in here as well
S0013	mm
S0012	you remember that one
S0008	upstairs right
S0012	yeah and uh that didn't work very well with all the all the aerials plug in they be only plug in
S0008	mm
S0012	there be no television on pull them all out and put them in one and that seem to work okay at the moment
S0008	mm
S0008	well i yeah ours be still run off the old aerial well that go up probably go up in the nineteen sixties
S0012	yeah same as this
S0008	and uh when i do look at the changeover because before they change over
S0012	yeah
S0008	our old telly's work on digital box
S0012	yeah
S0008	we use to get a brilliant picture
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	all the stuff and like all the program which everyone else would get we use to get
S0012	yeah
S0013	oh
S0008	as soon as they change over all the picture go fuzzy
S0012	yeah
S0008	the background be sort of swim
S0012	oh yeah
S0008	you know cos then
S0013	yeah
S0008	we have to get rid of the old digital box
S0012	yeah
S0008	and buy the little you know freeview box
S0012	yeah
S0008	then but it still wasn't very good and i think buy a new telly sure to be better than this of course get a new telly and yeah it's a bite better but
S0012	it's the aerial
S0008	it's not very good but when i look at before they say you know oh no if you get a good aerial
S0012	yeah
S0008	a digital aerial
S0012	a digital aerial
S0008	and also what they say be the cable
S0012	the correct cable they get
S0008	you get you can buy special cable they have
S0012	that's right
S0008	digital transmission which be better
S0012	which be there's no loss on them
S0013	mm
S0008	that's right and so
S0012	yeah
S0008	that will be the next thing
S0012	yeah
S0008	to go and get a new aerial cos they aren't expensive
S0012	no
S0008	you know like twenty quid or something
S0012	that's right
S0008	you can get an aerial
S0012	you've get to have it put up then haven't you
S0008	well i can get on the roof
S0012	you can get up there can you
S0008	but you see it's a flat roof over the shop
S0012	oh right oh yes
S0008	and then i can get up onto the roof from there
S0012	yeah
S0008	and its only sort of a little step on a roof ladder you know it's all quite safe you know you're not hang over the edge or anything
S0012	no
S0013	mm
S0008	i've be up there before
S0012	yeah when you're up give a show
S0008	send you up there
S0012	no i'm not go up there i'm just stay down to catch you
S0008	stand there with a mobile phone with ready to dial for the ambulance
S0008	no i but i mean probably worse come to worse i can just stick on the end of the go on the flat roof and just stick it on the end of the eves
S0012	yeah
S0008	stick that's probably high enough
S0012	mm yeah if you get nothing else in the way be it
S0008	mm no there's a big there's a big um
S0012	build opposite you
S0008	no no no no a big uh
S0012	there's a tree
S0008	a big tree opposite and
S0012	yeah
S0008	a big beech tree
S0012	yeah
S0008	but as i say we a get pretty you know normal problem we use to have a pretty good signal
S0012	yeah
S0008	and uh but i'm not home since i care that much
S0012	no
S0008	but there's a there's definitely
S0012	there's still some nuisance ain't it
S0008	yeah but it's definitely something with the transmissions and stuff as well
S0012	yeah
S0008	because you can get i sit there you know and you can do contrast and brightness
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then manipulate like different colour
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you know all this sort of sharpness i mean there's plenty of
S0012	plenty of options
S0008	plenty of options of what you're play with you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you can get like the skin tone really good
S0012	oh mine will show not
S0008	but no on this any particular channel
S0012	oh right
S0008	but then all these like the weather people they always seem to wear these sort of very bright colour clothe
S0012	which
S0008	and like you know red something come up all red and like
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know although you've turn the red right down the blue really you know
S0013	oh
S0008	it's really blue
S0013	mm
S0008	but i have notice that with other people's televisions as well
S0012	yeah
S0008	so maybe it's cos you're not use to it
S0012	well maybe it's well and come home to watch our television they couldn't watch it
S0013	it's too bright
S0012	we we get use to it
S0008	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	well this be the same problem
S0013	yeah
S0008	and also because it's because we use to have a square telly right it be just right for us it be only nineteen inch or something like
