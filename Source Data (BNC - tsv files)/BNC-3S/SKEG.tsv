S0521	that's erm epsom
S0520	where be surrey exactly
S0521	surrey be west of london it's sort of the
S0520	oh right on to the coast
S0521	no no the other side
S0520	oh i'm not good at west and east
S0521	it's sort of the prime commuter territory for london
S0520	surrey and then be it erm somerset next
S0521	somerset to the west well somerset's actually in the west of england rather than london
S0520	i understand so there's london surrey
S0521	well you've get things like oxfordshire
S0520	lincolnshire oh oxfordshire yeah
S0521	oxfordshire erm what's the one next to it staffordshire worcestershire
S0520	oh yeah
S0521	warwickshire all of those be between somerset and surrey
S0520	okay quite a fat part the country isn't it
S0521	it be
S0520	mm
S0521	it be indeed
S0520	chubby
S0521	well yes i see what you mean
S0520	it's not really that much of a consolation
S0521	no
S0520	i be just point out if you compare here to chester you have one type of comparison but in term of the whole country the north east be the cheapest
S0521	yes i think it be
S0520	and the north west be the second most cheapest and chester be probably somewhere in the middle it's not expensive relatively to all of those southern counties
S0521	not compare with the south no
S0520	mm so you're still get a bargain really
S0521	still on seven hundred on page ten
S0520	yeah that's the other thing
S0521	i be try to go up a little
S0520	yeah
S0521	seven two fives here we be seven two five four bedroomed terrace
S0520	mm mm mm
S0521	three bedroom detach
S0520	you don't want a terrace house do you
S0521	three bedroom flat two bedroom flat seven two five
S0521	it's in wimbledon
S0520	oh there you go then erm wimbledon's nice isn't it
S0521	i believe so
S0520	central
S0521	i believe so
S0520	mm
S0521	streatham four bedroom semi
S0520	it's the same with rent it's just mad rental price
S0521	yeah
S0520	won't you look up erm with your criteria
S0521	okay alright with a minimum of seven hundred
S0520	most people that i know who stay in or anyone that i know they move to the outlying villages like and be it or something like that
S0521	okay
S0520	i can't remember their name but they weren't nice particularly nice place
S0521	so do you know erm road
S0520	yeah
S0521	seven hundred for a six bedroomed terrace
S0520	really road be one of the less nice roads
S0521	road
S0520	it's quite a big road road
S0521	seven two five for a four bedroom terrace
S0520	yeah
S0521	three bedroom terrace on street
S0520	oh there you go that be where i
S0521	it's that where you be
S0520	yeah let's see that could even be next door that could even be it
S0521	let's have a look at it then
S0520	how funny there you go exactly what me and mum say about the price of it
S0521	yeah which one be it
S0520	let me have a look oh no it's on the other side of the road to us and it's get like a little downstairs bite as well let's see inside
S0521	oh it's the one with the blue door
S0520	mm mm like a nicer version of ours though ours be like a bite of a student dig
S0521	yes a bite studenty
S0520	it be really lucky to live on that road though even as students
S0521	gosh well it look rather nice but it's not worth seven hundred and twenty five
S0520	well yeah well it be worth
S0521	that's a bite like
S0520	yeah that be like ours
S0521	isn't it yeah
S0520	yeah it look like very similar structure that be my room and the there be the bathroom next door
S0521	yeah incredible
S0520	crazy
S0521	look a bite of a mess
S0520	that's not really the point no the point be about street be that you can walk to
S0521	need attention yes you're pretty well place aren't you
S0520	you're there aren't you five minutes from and five minutes from the centre of town really i mean if you be for instance an academic family
S0521	er
S0520	you're not go to have that much money but and you both work at the university or something like that
S0521	right
S0520	that would be
S0521	well yes i mean and this be
S0520	well walk to work
S0521	this be the thing isn't it there's no way that you could afford anything like that unless you'd be work for twenty years and you'd be lucky in previous house because seven hundred thousand be just a huge amount of money
S0520	well that's the other things isn't it of course it be erm i guess yeah i guess partly it's people who make wise investments with property as well
S0521	yeah exactly yeah
S0520	and others who erm
S0521	start slide show
S0520	just have a good job i mean as i say the wag for instance if you work in london in a high position job the wag re extremely high aren't they not to mention that i think people be will on average to take out much bigger mortgage than you do
S0521	i wonder i suppose they have to don't they
S0520	i think so and people be not like you're no you're you're debt free which the majority of people simply be far from that
S0521	it's very old fashion to be debt free
S0520	it be old fashion but it's very wise
S0521	have its advantage
S0520	exactly no of course just not
S0521	we survive anyway
S0520	yeah of course it's just the not the mentality for most people i think and for the good or for the bad people be pay off their mortgage till the end of their live you know
S0521	yeah so point one miles from city centre
S0520	yeah i know
S0521	you would know that
S0520	as students it be perfect you know i could walk to my lecture cycle could get up at the last minute for my nine o'clock
S0521	that sound familiar
S0520	it be i don't think i ever have a nine o'clock actually to be honest be an artsy type
S0521	mm that's true seven two five three bedroomed terrace of street
S0520	that's funny that it come up it's quite unusual for properties to come up i imagine now i mean the thing with as well be that it's increase come become commuter territory or it be officially commuter territory by now they build a lot of flats by the station specifically for people who work in london it's forty five minutes to kings cross
S0521	oh be it
S0520	and yeah and it's you know people travel that much within london
S0521	i mean just on the face of it just look through these i'd say there's a great variation of what you're offer for that price
S0520	yeah it's all about where it be isn't it
S0521	you can get a three bedroomed terrace you can also get a five bedroomed detach
S0520	where though
S0521	well i'll tell you in a second here we be place
S0520	oh that's quite nice
S0521	oh no sorry no that's terrace
S0521	erm crescent do you know that
S0520	no i mean with it's like a few different areas there's the sort of below the river which be where we be and all the colleges be most of them anyway and then above the river there's and
S0519	do you find your house in
S0521	this be just amaze because we find one on street
S0519	oh no way
S0520	we find we find one on street and it be exactly how much we say
S0519	of course it be
S0521	here you be
S0520	i mean it's better off than the one we live in in term of it's in better nick
S0521	it's seven hundred a twenty five
S0519	i know love i know
S0521	er yeah so here we be there's a five
S0520	so what about the
S0521	five bedroom detach it say i shall the read be interest with the potential to create a beautiful five bedroom detach residence
S0520	well yeah mean it's a bite of a hole currently
S0519	student dive at present
S0520	no there be there be north of the river there be less nice neighbourhoods in which be much less desirable
S0519	yeah that's right that's the same
S0520	they're further away from the station
S0519	and they're just little modern house estates and all of that
S0520	yeah like use to live in like a normal
S0519	everything be available yeah
S0520	not you now normal estate in north of the river
S0521	right

S0521	run past where the must run past the colleges
S0520	it do yeah it go straight into the centre
S0521	well blow me
S0520	yeah i don't really get it either but it's a nice place to live no doubt and there's lot go on all the time culture and stuff
S0521	be at the heart of the high tech centre know as silicon fen
S0520	have you hear about this
S0521	i have actually yeah i didn't know it be call silicon fen
S0520	nor do i
S0521	ex university people go out you know set themselves up haven't they
S0520	start start up yeah yeah it's become a bite of a hub for things now silicon fen that's funny
