S0018	so you can work in london and he can find a job in london can he
S0014	yeah every yeah i mean i think the other option be we stay here and i take redundancy and then probably take a lower pay job but we might be happier because we're here but erm we haven't really talk about it like properly in term of we need to make a decision now at the moment it's just kind of well er these be our options
S0018	what shall we do what shall we do
S0014	yeah
S0018	it's a difficult one though isn't it
S0014	i know it be like quality of life versus like money really i guess
S0018	exactly but not only i think it's the pace of life in london too
S0014	yeah
S0018	i mean i
S0014	i think if it have be ten years ago we would have both say yeah let's do it thank you cheer but yeah like now we're in our thirties we don't really want to make that kind of move really
S0018	how i mean how far out of london can you live so that it's not actually really london live
S0014	erm it depend like basically the bbc will give me a relocation package
S0018	oh yeah
S0014	so they'd help me sell my house and help finance a move but if i do that i'd have to live within a thirty mile radius of where i'd be work which be central london
S0018	oh right
S0014	so i could say no i don't want any financial help i'll do it myself and then i could live wherever i want
S0018	mm
S0014	and then i think well i could commute it from but then i think well i could probably do it for a couple of months thank but er that would take its toll i think
S0018	would you miss do you actually like live here
S0014	erm well all my friends be here and i think it's just ideal because it's not far from my mum and dad they're an hour away my friends be all here
S0018	how far be hereford from
S0014	from london
S0018	london
S0014	be over three hours
S0018	oh gosh really
S0014	between three and four hours i think
S0018	be it that far
S0014	mm
S0018	oh i guess cos london's more east to the east isn't it
S0014	mm mm this be good
S0018	do you like it
S0014	mm
S0018	it might need a bite of salt and a bite of pepper
S0014	oh it's really yummy what have you put in it
S0018	ooh er
S0014	i can taste carrot
S0018	yep carrot parsnip potatoes sweet potatoes celery onion
S0014	mm yum
S0018	i think that's it
S0014	i need to start make soup more
S0018	but it's so easy honestly i me and my mum go for a coffee at about half past ten we get back here at twelve i just chop chop chop whack it in a big saucepan with some boil water
S0014	oh wow and that's it
S0018	yeah and twenty minutes later i just whiz it all up
S0014	god very easy and very healthy
S0018	mm mm
S0014	cos i need to start be more healthy
S0018	really
S0014	well me and go to malta for a week
S0018	oh
S0014	and we be just like right we're not gonna worry about food or anything cos we're both prone to like put on weight and stuff we just think well we'll just eat what we want and i like put on like half a stone in a week i be devastate
S0018	ah it's holiday though
S0014	yeah another benefit like now we need to rein it in not eat out so much
S0018	ah well you're still go through that honeymoon period aren't you you probably want to go oh romantic candlelit dinners
S0014	oh i've never do that
S0018	no
S0014	no i don't think either of us be really that romantic really
S0018	so how long be it since you date and start to realise that you actually
S0014	it all happen really fast actually
S0018	mm
S0014	i'd say within three weeks we be like we be kind of talk about not move in straight away but we be kind of like yeah
S0018	oh wow
S0014	we can see this go somewhere and we can see us live together and get marry and stuff and that be within within three weeks definitely
S0018	ah
S0014	mm
S0018	and have he meet the boodhoos
S0014	mm even that within two months we'd do all the family stuff
S0018	oh

S0014	mm they do they really like him
S0018	ah
S0014	so yeah i remember at the time everyone be go oh this be go too fast it's not gonna last but we be just like you know if it feel right just go with it
S0018	yep
S0014	there's no point
S0018	yeah yeah yep
S0014	say oh no let's not do this cos you know it's too fast and it you know eight months later it's still great so
S0018	well there's no little rule book be there it's
S0014	no
S0018	as you say how things go naturally and
S0014	mm
S0018	important to go with the flow
S0014	yeah
S0018	and where's he from
S0014	erm he's from the originally
S0018	ha mm lovely
S0014	yeah so we have a really nice like few days down there when we go to see his parent
S0018	oh that's a beautiful place whereabouts be his parent
S0014	erm a place call which be kind of like literally just on the as the actually start
S0018	yep
S0014	it's like a little village
S0018	mm mm
S0014	like you could probably walk to the to the actual inter forest from there
S0018	be that quite close to
S0014	it's closer to
S0018	okay
S0014	yeah
S0018	yeah my dad's get a little a little boat down near well it's basically just opposite the isle of white
S0014	oh okay that's probably close then
S0018	so he's he see the when he's out on his boat
S0014	mm hmm mm
S0018	when my aunt she use to erm her husband be a farmer so she use to breed horse on the farm
S0014	oh wow
S0018	and they use to take their horse down to the to
S0014	ah
S0018	to gallop around on holiday
S0014	so how be you find it be back in england
S0018	mm alright
S0014	do you miss spain
S0018	i miss the weather
S0014	mm
S0018	i miss the passion
S0014	yeah
S0018	but there's a lot of things that england have that spain doesn't
S0014	yeah and it must be nice be around family and friends like and see them
S0018	definitely
S0014	all the time
S0018	it be really nice another good thing about spain be that it's always there
S0014	yeah ha yeah
S0018	yeah i'm try to get in a little visit i need a bite of sun
S0014	mm
S0018	just to feel the sun like this for example this morning if it be like this every day it's just the light and the warmth
S0014	how how do you find the winter then that must have be tough
S0018	well it it wasn't too bad because it have be quite a mild winter
S0014	mm
S0018	when i get into december i be think i can handle this i can handle this and then i start go to everybody oh i'm alright i can handle british winter and they be like this be not a british winter this be the mildest it have be for years
S0014	mm you should have be here the winter before you would not have survive
S0018	but you know little by little see how it end up
S0014	be you still speak spanish much then or have you not speak any for a while
S0018	no actually i've not well obviously because i be do the pgce i be teach spanish
S0014	oh yeah mm
S0018	so i be still kind of think about it but i mean teach spanish at secondary school
S0014	yeah
S0018	there's not much teach or spanish involve it's more like sit down stop try to body slam him in the corner
S0014	oh god
S0018	come on sit down
S0014	oh my god
S0018	sit down be i gonna have to put you on report okay you in the other corner stop stop jab the pencil up his nose health and safety issue
S0014	do do anyone want to learn
S0018	um there be a few kid in each class that be actually you could see they be very sparky and you could engage them
S0014	mm
S0018	but the thing be once you've engage the kid that you know be open to it
S0014	yeah
S0018	you've get all the ones that be play up and have get anger management issue or
S0014	god
S0018	visual impairment or hear impairment or
S0014	that sound really tough
S0018	it be tough because you're deal with so many variables in the one class
S0014	mm
S0018	that er as soon as you've engage one of the group you lose all the others and then it's like forever juggle and it wasn't that er i don't know i i seem to remember my class when i be at secondary school because we be stream they be a lot more homogeneous
S0014	yeah
S0018	so it be only really a handful of naughty boys that use to distract the class
S0014	yeah
S0018	but in the school that i've see and the school that you know my colleagues be tell me it's it's not it's now it's only a handful of kid that you can actually work you know teach
S0014	oh god
S0018	and it's the rest it's all crowd control and it's sole destroy it really be
S0014	do you think you'll go back to it
S0018	mm it be my back up plan
S0014	yeah
S0018	i mean have do the train in inner city i mean it's not really a microcosm of all the school that exist
S0014	yeah
S0018	i'm sure that there be school that that you don't have to handle that amount of misbehaviour and but i don't know if i find a job work with adults i think i'd much prefer do that
S0014	yeah
S0018	and cos i'm i'm target like erm english language teach publish and
S0014	oh okay
S0018	that's why a lot of the job be come up be in oxford
S0014	mm
S0018	i think if you're target publish it's oxford cambridge or london really
S0014	mm
S0018	erm so we'll see what happen i've just hear that i haven't get an interview for one of the job i go for
S0014	okay
S0018	but that be i think quite normal because i phone the guy in human resources and ask him about this particular job that i couldn't work out whether it be in oxford or madrid and it end up that it be in madrid
S0018	but i kind of take that opportunity to just quickly tell him my experience and ask him a bite of advice
S0014	yeah yeah
S0018	and he be like look you know just because it say we require sales and market experience
S0014	mm
S0018	if there's one or two things on the requirements list that you don't have send your cv in anyway because
S0014	okay
S0018	you never know so it be one of those situations
S0014	yeah
S0018	i didn't i didn't think that i think i might have get an interview have they only have like three people
S0014	yeah
S0018	ha ha but i don't think in this day and age they only get three people
S0014	no that's true mm
S0018	apply i think they get three hundred people apply for the
S0014	mm what about teach in sixth form or do you still need to do the whole pgce thing for that
S0018	yep
S0014	do you
S0018	mm mm
S0014	oh
S0018	i do er teach in sixth form too because there be erm most school nowadays have their own little sixth form
S0014	yeah
S0018	and it be generally nicer because they be smaller class
S0014	and they wanna be there don't they i guess
S0018	they still don't wanna be there
S0014	oh don't they
S0018	no no no no
S0014	oh
S0018	they still didn't wanna be there
S0014	god cos i just think once you get to sixth form
S0018	mm
S0014	you know it's a kind of a choice isn't it cos you don't have to go so you kind of think the people there
S0018	yeah
S0014	want to learn
S0018	yeah i mean there be a couple of very good students in that class but again it's it's such a shame that you you're distract from the very good students by the ones who er just disrupt everything
S0014	mm god
S0018	it's such a shame it really be
S0014	yeah
S0018	and of course i'm go into it off fourteen years teach
S0014	yeah
S0018	effectively not because i'm an effective teacher but because the the students that i've have have be you know obviously there's always kid be always gonna act up a little bite aren't they but
S0014	yeah yeah
S0018	these kid be at least motivate to be there because you could i find a lot that my personality in the classroom would motivate them
S0014	okay
S0018	because if you're energetic and enthusiastic
S0014	mm
S0018	and you know you make them laugh and you get them to do the work
S0014	yeah
S0018	and you get them to see that they can actually do it and all those things together motivate them to continue and motivate them to progress
S0014	yeah
S0018	but if you go into a secondary school class of thirty kid who don't want to be there who have no idea
S0014	yeah
S0018	why learn languages would be important erm if you go in there with an enthusiastic bubbly personality all positive and la la la okay how be you rar rar rar rar cmo estás hoy they just sit there and think oh what be she do
S0014	yeah
S0018	and you know make fun of the teacher and they've get no respect for you
S0014	yeah yeah
S0018	and then you've just start off completely on the wrong foot with them
S0014	god cos it's difficult to know how to kind of sort of kind of take it then
S0018	well you just have to be really disciplinarian and serious
S0014	mm
S0018	gage the class and maybe ease off on the whole seriousness
S0014	mm oh
S0018	oh it's just such a shame
S0014	hmm
S0018	it really be so yeah if i don't' find anything else i'll finish the course at least
S0014	yeah would you have to start again or can you
S0018	no i'd only have to take it up from january
S0014	oh that's good
S0018	the stuff i've already do count
S0014	yeah
S0018	but i think it be a bad time for me to do it really cos i i'd just i pretty much have a year of full on intense work
S0014	yeah yeah
S0018	without without holiday and go straight from you know full on intense work in spain to the day that i finish my job i move back to england i move all my life back to england and then the day after i move my life back to england i start
S0014	oh my god
S0018	i know so i think maybe with a bite more
S0014	yeah it might be easier this time then because you've have a bite of mental space as well and
S0018	mm mm and the whole adapt to another culture cos
S0014	mm
S0018	england have change so much since i leave it be kind of like come back to a foreign country in a way
S0014	be it god mm
S0018	but you'll probably get that if you move to london as well
S0014	yeah
S0018	it's like a different country a really different way of live a different rhythm
S0014	mm cos i've i've go i've live there twice just like short term for work like the first time i i do it for eight months and the second time be for three months and both time there be nothing that keep me there i i just felt like i want to come back i just felt like i i'm earn the same money as that in but it's not go as far
S0018	yeah
S0014	and i'm work longer hours just commute all the time and i just think i don't' really get the benefit of work here at all
S0018	mm will they readjust your salary to london weight
S0014	yeah they would though but that's only like three thousand five hundred on top which be still good but
S0018	it doesn't reflect the
S0014	it doesn't cover kind of you know tube fare and
S0018	yeah
S0014	and all that
S0018	mm and now the government be try to pay people less than other place that's
S0014	yeah that's a bite crazy
S0018	it be crazy especially when you consider that you know when you're shop for food and when you're buy petrol
S0014	mm
S0018	and when you're pay the rent and pay like pay bill and stuff it's not significantly
S0014	yeah
S0018	cheaper in the areas that they wanna pay people minimum wag
S0014	yeah yeah i know
S0018	mm it sound really dodge do you want some more soup
S0014	i'm alright thank actually
S0018	there's load leave
S0014	erm the other option be salford though cos you know load of fiat job be move up there
S0018	ah
S0014	so i can look into erm redeployment and and see if there's any work in salford so that's another option which it's kind of maybe like a happy medium really it's
S0018	yeah
S0014	it's a bite more like there not so expensive to live and matt's see some job there that he wouldn't mind apply for
S0018	what kind of things be he look for
S0014	erm just charity work still so work within the charity sector sector do erm research
S0018	what be his phd in
S0014	history
S0018	what particular part
S0014	erm i can't remember now
S0014	it be something to do with the work class sailors of southampton in the early nineteen hundreds
S0018	oh wow mm hm
S0014	that be yeah well that be his phd i don't know what he kind of specialise in though
S0018	so in the be this the first charity he's work for
S0014	yeah
S0018	mm
S0014	and he get that on the basis of erm he well actually he start off as a an advisor so it be just a temp job
S0018	mm
S0014	and then he's kind of work himself up from there really
S0018	oh super
S0014	yeah
S0018	yeah i've hear of quite a few people who have erm get their career out of temp job
S0014	mm mm
S0018	well be that something that he he go into quite early though the temp job early in his career
S0014	erm well he's er no only about three years ago
S0018	okay
S0014	yeah so he would have be late twenties
S0018	mm oh that's it's kind of excite have options at least you know
S0014	mm i guess so
S0018	you've get options
S0014	yeah it's just a bite scary because i just you know i guess nothing's ever go to be easy i just think you know we would have be together a year and then think about get marry and buy a house but actually there's so much more to think about now but i dunno like we're not gonna buy a house until we know where i'm gonna work and and we probably wouldn't be able to afford to buy i don't think
S0018	really not even with two salaries
S0014	yeah maybe i still don't think we'd get erm a house as nice as we would get here
S0018	yep
S0014	like i own a four bedroom house in like there's there's no way i'll get er that flat in london for the same money
S0018	be that be that the one in bearwood
S0014	mm
S0018	oh okay the one that you rent out
S0014	yeah it's me and two other guy

S0018	well she's marry
S0014	oh god yeah
S0018	the guy who own that bakery
S0014	of course
S0018	the little french café and
S0014	oh my god
S0018	so this be his bread
S0018	funnily enough
S0014	the last time i saw actually i be send to erm cambridge to do a story so we meet for a coffee before i go to do my interview
S0018	oh right
S0014	and it be two days before my date with
S0014	cos i be like oh yeah i've get this internet date i'm a bite nervous like i haven't speak to her since so she probably doesn't even know that i'm actually with this guy
S0018	how things happen
S0018	and be he do you meet him quite soon after you'd erm sign up to the internet site
S0014	mm this be why i recommend the site i join the site on erm like the sunday he message me on the tuesday and we meet on the saturday i wasn't even on it a week
S0018	blimey
S0014	i know it be really bad
S0018	be he the first date that you have off it as well
S0014	yeah first of anyone i i message load of other guy
S0018	oh
S0014	who be potentials as well
S0014	who you know be really nice and stuff
S0018	mm mm
S0014	but erm yeah so he be the first one
S0018	and do you put your photo up on the site then
S0014	mm
S0018	be you not worry that people in the office would see you or
S0014	no cos i think people know anyway that i be date and internet date and stuff
S0018	oh right mm
S0014	so yeah it all happen really quickly
S0018	and how long have he be on there previously to
S0014	he'd probably be on there a couple of months he's he be actually he'd be see someone before me they'd only go on like five or six date and then it didn't work
S0018	mm
S0014	i think he have a date with one other girl as well but that be just a one one date thing so yeah i think he he'd be on there a bite longer but he be say it er that from a man's point of view actually you can be on there a long time cos girls don't tend to message and then you might message someone and they don't really message back
S0018	mm mm
S0014	cos i think it's the other way round for women ha men probably come across as a bite more desperate
S0014	whereas girls like to play it cool and i guess want the man to message don't they they don't really what would they do
S0018	i don't know i kind of i kind of prefer to be the person in control of who i get in touch with
S0014	mm
S0018	do he get in touch with you or
S0014	mm well what have happen be cos you can click on people's profile and they know if you've look at your profile it'll say oh these people have look at your profile
S0018	oh no
S0014	which i didn't know anyway so he message me and go oh i i see that you check my profile today not really sure what you think but i read your profile and you seem really nice and i be a bite mortify cos at that point i didn't know that people could tell that you look at their profile
S0014	so i guess i kind of instigate it but i i can't remember his profile at all
S0018	mm
S0014	hello
S0018	hello
S0004	hello
S0018	do you know
S0004	er i don't think we've meet have we
S0014	i don't think we've we've meet no
S0018	no well dan's another internet date success
S0014	oh okay
S0018	do you want some soup dan
S0004	er yeah i wouldn't say no yeah that'd be wicked
S0018	help yourself it's in the erm pan on the side
S0014	and then there's be everything happy with and stuff or
S0018	yeah yeah i think ooh stuff at work be a bite weird still
S0014	mm
S0018	it's not easy live in a situation where you don't know where you're gonna be
S0014	yeah yeah cos she's get it as well really like i don't think theirs be even they either don't have a job or they do
S0018	mm
S0014	like there's they're not move anywhere i don't think be they
S0018	so what division be you with
S0014	well i'm asian at work but news
S0018	mm
S0014	so news side and programme side they're two different
S0018	mm mm
S0014	yeah
S0018	mm
S0014	so yeah i don't i think indi will be alright just cos she's work herself up and
S0018	yep
S0014	i i think she'll be fine on the job yep
S0018	but isn't there talk about completely get rid of the side of things
S0014	no i don't well they haven't say that
S0018	no
S0014	they're get rid of the leicester side of things that's why my job's go
S0018	oh okay
S0014	yeah but as far as i know it's stay
S0018	can you not work from
S0014	no i mean i could but if they're get rid of fifty percent of the staff anyway they're not gonna give me the job they'll any job that come up will go to those people who lose their job i think
S0018	mm so your job will definitely move to london
S0014	yeah
S0018	couldn't you work out some kind of thing whereby you stay in and you do two or three days a week in london and
S0014	possibly but i just think everyone will wanna do that like basically none of my team want to move they're all midlands base
S0018	uh huh
S0014	so if he do that for me he'll have to do it for everyone and he's not gonna do that
S0018	oh what a shame
S0014	yeah but yeah none of us wanna go
S0018	mm dilemma
S0014	yeah i mean you know it's not as bad for me a lot a lot of the people in leicester be marry with kinds and stuff the kid be in school
S0018	yep
S0014	it's a lot harder for them
S0018	mm
S0014	but who know i need to start look for other job really cos at the moment i'm just moan about not want to go but not actually do anything to make it better
S0018	what kind of thing would you be look for
S0014	i don't know that's the thing i have no idea matt and i want to set up our own business of some sort
S0018	oh yeah
S0014	erm cos we be like well if i could take the redundancy and do that but it's just know what to do
S0018	mm
S0014	erm we like the idea of open a restaurant but hope not not as a
S0018	really
S0014	like we can't cook we'll have to get someone else to do the cook
S0014	we have talk about open a mauritian restaurant that's what we want to do and then last week that mauritian girl win masterchef so we be like well she's gonna do that now
S0018	mm
S0014	no one's gonna come to ours
S0018	be it in
S0014	well it'll just look like we're jump on the bandwagon now
S0018	no she you could see it as erm she give you some good publicity
S0014	maybe
S0018	people will be up for mauritian food now
S0018	what's it like mauritian food
S0014	mm it's kind of like this cross between i guess african cook and indian cook really
S0018	mm lovely
S0014	mm
S0018	lovely lovely
S0014	a lot of fish that cheese be nice
S0018	it be nice isn't it how be your run then
S0004	it be good yeah it be
S0018	beautiful day for it
S0004	it's a bite chilly
S0018	you might have to warm it up i don't know if it'll be hot warm enough for you
S0004	i'll give it a blast in the microwave
S0018	good idea
S0014	and so we need to organise some drink really don't we and have a night out
S0018	definitely
S0014	i haven't see for age
S0018	that er german restaurant that you be tell her about sound good
S0014	mm no er austrian
S0018	oh be it austrian
S0014	mm
S0018	that sound really cool
S0014	it's brilliant
S0018	have you be there
S0014	yeah basically you wouldn't even know it's there it's just a residential street and it's someone's house that they've turn into a restaurant and you kind of walk in and you just feel like you're in austria there's people like dress up and stuff
S0014	you go down into the basement and they've turn it into a bar and you're have drink there so yeah it's really good
S0018	and do it look like a do it look like someone's house
S0014	from the outside
S0018	oh
S0014	and like when you're inside it like it look like a restaurant but you can kind of tell well this be the live room this obviously be like erm a kitchen area and they've just kind of turn it all into a restaurant inside
S0018	mm
S0014	yeah definitely worth go
S0018	because i've i've hear of these place that erm people actually set up restaurants in their own home
S0014	mm
S0018	but on a very small scale so when you go round you actually feel like your
S0014	i'm in someone's house
S0018	yeah
S0018	but it just sound a bite a little bite weird
S0014	yeah once you're in there it do look like a restaurant i don't even know cos i didn't think he'd be allow to do it they obviously get some kind of licence
S0018	mm
S0014	so if they open a restaurant like that on a residential street
S0018	what's the food like
S0014	yeah really nice i can't remember what i have now erm lot of meat though
S0018	but not not that memorable then
S0014	yeah it's kind of like meat and veg and stuff but you just get a set menu so you have to have three course
S0018	mm mm
S0014	but erm yeah it's definitely i think it's just such a weird experience be in there
S0018	mm i don't think i've ever try austrian food
S0014	where do indi take not indi where do she take in the end
S0018	ah to a lovely little restaurant call
S0014	ah
S0018	i think they'd er he'd be in london for two days and
S0014	oh okay
S0018	she be knackered and and they just get home and say oh where do you wanna go out and they be like oh shall we just get
S0014	ah
S0018	sabai sabai to deliver so they get a have a thai thai meal
S0014	ah
S0018	and just chill at home
S0014	ah
S0018	which be lovely cos when you're er when you're knackered
S0014	yeah
S0018	and you've gotta go to work the next day and you're not really in the in the mood for it
S0014	no ha
S0018	mm it's a bite
S0014	it must be nice have them so close
S0018	definitely but she's actually be ill for a bite
S0014	oh okay
S0018	she's erm do you know she have to have her wed ring cut off
S0014	no
S0018	i think erm i don't know whether it be an allergic reaction to the ring
S0014	mm
S0018	or whether she have a bite of eczema under it and it all inflame and luckily cos 's dad's a goldsmith
S0014	oh yeah
S0018	he be able to cut it off and her mum who's a doctor say oh just um er put some aloe vera on it and see if it get any better
S0014	okay
S0018	and they be in india and it get better i think under the sun
S0014	oh okay
S0018	then when they come back it just flare up again to the extent where it get completely infect but not just her hand her whole system
S0014	oh god
S0018	get infect and she be like feel hot and cold and vomitty she er nauseous vomitty ha ha
S0014	she be feel vomitty
S0004	have that happen since last weekend
S0018	yeah
S0004	or be this before
S0018	no it it have happen before and she'd have to have her wed ring cut off about two months ago
S0004	shit
S0018	i know and i think i think that she might be home today off work again
S0014	oh god
S0018	cos she's er her little car be on her little drive but she have to have
S0014	so they still don't know what cause it then
S0018	no they don't know whether it be a an allergic reaction to metal in the ring or
S0014	yeah well surely she have get it before then cos she's wear that for years
S0018	i have no idea
S0014	mm
S0018	i don't know i don't think the doctor know even
S0014	yeah
S0018	but they've give her anti inflammatories and antibiotics
S0014	oh okay
S0018	and steroids and
S0014	and she can't wear her ring at the moment
S0018	no
S0014	ah
S0018	they have all those joke though when they have to cut it off it be like she cut off my wed ring oh
S0018	she doesn't wanna be my wifey any more
S0014	that must have be quite hard for them actually with the have your ring cut off
S0018	i know
S0014	but i guess he can put it back together again somehow
S0018	oh yeah no he can i think it's just you know like when you get your ring when your finger get too big and
S0014	oh with that yeah yeah
S0018	you get it enlarge or
S0014	yeah
S0018	i think it's easily do but it's more of the the symbolic
S0014	yeah yeah oh oh oh
S0018	so where do you want to get marry have you have you actually start
S0014	in in hereford
S0018	oh right
S0014	this be the other thing though because my family be catholic and i really wanna get marry in a catholic church but he just refuse
S0018	really
S0014	he doesn't want to and i just think if i do want to get marry soon i'm probably gonna have to back down on that cos i'm not go to convince him otherwise
S0018	what be it you want about a catholic church marriage
S0014	just because i dunno it's more of childhood thing like i just want to get marry in the church i've always go to and i still go to when i go back to hereford and stuff and
S0018	oh ah
S0014	and it's a really lovely build and it's in a really nice part of hereford but then i think actually hereford's so beautiful there's so many other place we could get marry that would still be as nice
S0018	mm what's he get against the church
S0014	he just doesn't really agree with catholicism
S0018	really
S0014	which be fair enough and i just though you know i'd rather get marry to him in a place we're both happy and comfortable
S0018	yeah yeah
S0014	rather than make him go through a ceremony that he just doesn't want to do
S0018	mm
S0014	but
S0018	that's weird cos i'm not religious but i wouldn't actually rule out get marry in a religious institution if it be gorgeous
S0014	yeah well i think it's cos cos it's the catholic church
S0018	oh right
S0014	if it be church of england i don't think he'd have as many issue but he just he's like oh i don't like catholicism it's like a cult so i think it's more cos it's a catholic church
S0018	and he's okay with you be catholic
S0014	yeah yeah he's fine with that but i don't think he'd want our kid to be or anything
S0018	be you be you practise
S0014	yeah not so much any more i use to go all the time and now it tend to be just when i'm back with my parent when i go
S0018	mm mm
S0014	and but when i be travel i go quite a bite just cos it i dunno it be just a weird thing be you know you all these prayers you know like that you've say since you be a kid and i just felt when i be away like go somewhere you know and have that familiar you know it be like really familiar
S0018	mm comfort
S0014	yeah it be so yeah it be weird and i didn't think i would kind of go to church when i be away at all and i do
S0018	ah
S0014	but it's fine i've kind of get over the fact now we're not gonna have a catholic wed
S0018	yeah be you gonna still dress in white though
S0014	yeah yeah definitely
S0014	erm but as long as it's in hereford then i don't mind

S0014	we look we all look really good we really make an effort
S0018	i think we do
S0014	sexy witch
S0018	oh back in our youth
S0014	i know
S0018	it's crazy everyone's talk about marriage and baby and all that
S0014	mm
S0004	who do you class as everyone
S0018	everyone every single person on this planet
S0004	bet 's not
S0014	she want to
S0018	's
S0014	i think it's just an awkward situation isn't it
S0018	no there's definitely be some discourse there
S0014	oh okay
S0018	keep bring up
S0014	oh that's good
S0018	little things as well i'm wonder whether
S0014	mm she's gotta tell her parent first though
S0004	yeah see isn't there some parental thing go on
S0014	yeah yeah
S0018	do they not know that she's get marry with him
S0014	no no that's the whole problem cos he's muslim she's sikh so there's all that issue
S0018	oh
S0014	so the families don't' know
S0018	's a muslim i didn't know that
S0014	yeah well they like
S0004	mm well exactly
S0014	hussain
S0018	i know he be pakistani
S0014	mm
S0018	of pakistani origin but i didn't
S0014	so yeah that's why it's i think there's a few issue with
S0018	oh dear
S0014	that's like i think she she want all that but
S0018	yeah
S0014	she need to tell her parent first really and just deal with the
S0018	but her parent be lovely aren't they wouldn't they
S0004	yeah but they're quite old school
S0014	yeah they be they're very traditional
S0018	really i suppose
S0014	they'd want her to marry a sikh man
S0018	really
S0014	definitely not a muslim
S0018	ah
S0004	mm mm
S0014	no
S0018	i just don't agree with that kind of
S0014	no
S0004	but they'd let her marry an englishman
S0014	yeah they'd be more accept over that than a muslim
S0018	well faisal faisal's a total englishman really isn't he
S0014	but he ask her once kind of in jest but he ask her what would be your muslim name as in be you go to convert i think
S0004	god
S0014	so he obviously have kind of traditional value as well
S0018	really
S0014	so as much as you know they want it to be easy i think both of them have kind of get these i dunno religious and cultural value that
S0018	what a shame
