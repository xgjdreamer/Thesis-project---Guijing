S0423	yeah they usually be reasonable quality there and good price
S0422	yeah it's german stuff isn't it remember when i get that chair she use to sit in that panda one cos she didn't wanna lie down anymore in her cot
S0423	oh i don't know

S0421	oh right
S0422	the white ones
S0423	not gonna find out
S0422	no
S0423	so it's not
S0422	no
S0423	it's the next one be it
S0422	yesterday say there may be a train strike on the date of her exams
S0423	really
S0421	i know what a nightmare be that
S0423	how be you gonna get to college then
S0421	don't know
S0423	what just one day
S0421	no erm three days
S0423	they're strike for three days
S0421	yeah there's gonna be one strike and then like a few days later there's gonna be one for two days it's not certain yet but i think they might do something about it because the london underground will strike as well
S0423	really
S0421	yeah so i think it's about pay it's the erm
S0423	i think that be a different with the and
S0421	no it's
S0423	it's all the same union
S0421	it's erm what be it call the national railway or something like that and they northern rail's part of it and like virgin train and like there's a long list and it say london underground so i'm like
S0423	why they're negotiate then
S0421	because it's gonna be a nightmare in london the underground's not go
S0421	so i'm think they might not care about northern rail not go but if the london underground's not go they might do something so hopefully they won't strike
S0423	yeah there's time to sort it out yet isn't there when's your next exam then
S0421	the eleventh
S0423	and your last one's the fifteenth
S0421	the nineteenth
S0423	oh right
S0421	i've get one on the eleventh
S0423	right so they're all kind of cram in sort out
S0421	yeah one on the eleventh and then that's so that's one week and then the next week i think i've get it i think it's the fifteenth and the nineteenth
S0423	it's not long really be it
S0421	no
S0423	you're not far off the first of june before you know it you'll
S0421	i know i can't wait gonna be summer nineteenth of june in the i don't know about twelve o'clock i'll be finish

S0422	it's normally forty but they don't start natural want that
S0423	you think take it even a bite earlier then won't you
S0422	no it's actually this be more dangerous than to go to thirty eight weeks than thirty nine sorry no thirty seven they say rather thirty seven than thirty eight weird than thirty nine it's one it's no be i think look forty one or forty two
S0421	more i be a month late
S0422	no
S0423	it wouldn't have happen
S0422	that much no
S0421	you say i be a month late because i be suppose to be bear on the twentieth of january
S0422	twenty second but they calculate in weeks so
S0421	oh well there you go then that'll be like
S0422	almost
S0421	yeah three and a half or something weeks

S0423	oh
S0422	yeah
S0423	the queen's in today

S0423	she's go to
S0422	be she
S0421	be she
S0423	she's go there's an equestrian centre cos she's into her horse isn't she so there must be some place where
S0422	no go with
S0423	well no i don't think she's go to the centre it's probably out of the centre a bite it's gonna be somewhere with school and things
S0421	mm
S0423	but er it's a horse place
S0421	university where erm have it on their like website yeah
S0423	oh do they be that how you know

S0423	saw it on
S0421	we're like oh we're the queen to
S0423	be she go to the university
S0421	no no
S0423	think she might visit there
S0422	wanna be that way
S0421	oh well she might do
S0422	that that one yeah
S0421	who know do you think the queen can just like go down to the corner shop and buy some bread and some milk or would people be like
S0423	they wouldn't
S0421	they wouldn't let her
S0423	if she insist they might
S0421	they might yeah but they'd have to take like guard
S0423	about twenty people and bodyguards and everything else but er that film be out a week wasn't it
S0421	oh right yeah
S0423	about the queen supposedly a very similar true story
S0421	i know but they say base on a true story and it's like
S0423	well the only be
S0421	yeah it and it would be so dramatise and
S0423	well yeah they probably they probably hear a bite of the story
S0421	yeah
S0423	make up everything about that
S0421	yeah like like you hear you watch film that have be like base on a true story you start think wow do that really happen and then when you actually look up what happen in the true story it be not nearly as excite as it it
S0423	yeah they always make more of a i can understand how
S0421	well yeah but
S0422	close to the hospital yeah so
S0423	leave
S0422	not just yet there's the and then
S0422	you just a erm traffic light go on
S0423	where straight
S0422	just make it no leave
S0423	leave here
S0422	yeah
S0423	oh
S0422	and if you go that way so
S0423	fair well there
S0422	i know they're here
S0423	well yeah the hospital wasn't far from be it
S0422	mm yeah that be good
S0423	that shop place be
S0421	we could have literally walk to the hospital for something
S0422	oh i
S0423	oh there's the posh the posh shop there
S0422	i don't think there's any around
S0423	they're all from across the
S0422	what a shame
S0423	when of course over there
S0422	oh get some nice ones
S0423	it probably be in
S0422	yeah
S0423	which be a bite more upmarket i suppose
S0422	it's a good
S0423	be that where they teach in as well
S0422	yeah
S0421	yeah have connections with it to do like the nurse program so although i mean 's not well not many people want to go to but if you want to do nurse then it's good because of the hospital
S0423	yeah it's just as well you're gonna be in cos i think obtain
S0422	well they don't have a maternity there
S0423	oh they don't have one
S0422	no
S0423	so special measure and do that and the other but
S0422	no i wouldn't anyway
S0423	straight up
S0422	yeah
S0423	be there no progress on the house have you not come a completion date on it
S0422	oh yeah i do the over
S0422	two weeks ago so they straightaway to the language i think that's what they make
S0423	yeah probably now
S0422	erm so that's also and you know the survey i question it
S0423	oh right yeah yeah
S0422	and erm
S0423	have they get your quote and all that
S0422	actually the estate agent they really they're really good the ones in in the show and erm and she say like she'll send the surveyor and she'll get me quote but she have it survey and she get quote back for me
S0423	mm that's good isn't it
S0422	yeah it's very good and she didn't charge me for it
S0423	oh
S0422	and er what i do be er then i tell her that they you know what the figure be and then i look through it because er tax wasn't include you know the
S0423	tax
S0422	well you know the on the top there's tax as well
S0421	ah it's our old house
S0422	erm
S0423	what what do you
S0422	you know they give you a quote and they say plus tax well i wanna know how much that be so i have to calculate it
S0423	oh you mean vat or the work
S0422	yeah vat yeah
S0423	right
S0422	so erm and
S0422	erm so yeah and i say to her er i'd be quite happy to have the work do if the vendor agree to erm reduce it by that much and then i have do with this company because i think they must have something out of it do you know what i mean
S0423	yeah
S0422	because so many connections
S0423	and be they be they suggest that then
S0422	she say straightaway yeah i'll i'll send it over to i'll send over the survey and i'll tell her erm you know
S0423	have you hear back from
S0422	not yet no not yet
S0423	i mean if they don't then
S0422	i know waste of time yeah
S0423	probably just really very expensive
S0422	well it be about seven hundred each
S0423	oh right
S0422	without tax
S0423	you do want if they say no
S0422	well when i come to
S0423	probably say well what about meet half way each or something
S0422	yeah yeah exactly
S0423	try to compromise as least you get half of it
S0422	yeah so er but then again you know the next person can come and they can do the same so if she want to wait
S0423	they're gonna wanna as well they're not gonna want to wait be they
S0422	no if they wanna sell yeah
S0423	they're gonna want to sell it they've get you there otherwise it's gonna take more they may as well have that back in
S0422	and the estate agent's not cos she's gonna get something out of me anyway isn't she from some people
S0423	well yeah they get what a percentage of a sale they to one up to two percent probably one and a half two percent
S0422	no not just the house no the work as well
S0423	oh right yeah she might get a so
S0422	they organise it yeah but they're really good really no a a i'd sell my house and i recommend them to anyone around there who want to sell their house because you know what i'm like with estate agents the amount of time we er sell the house
S0423	be it right
