S0439	yeah
S0481	er
S0440	pension pension
S0481	pension which be
S0440	so all that all that rubbish about i only get two hundred pound a month
S0439	no but that's really dangerous
S0481	yes
S0439	if you take a lump sum of your pension and then invest it in your house
S0481	yeah well
S0439	don't get me wrong it will
S0481	well
S0439	it will increase the value of the house but if you suddenly need a lot of money you've spend it all on a bloody conservatory and bathroom
S0481	mm well they need well the old conservatory have go and they need a new bathroom so it's just one of those things you do that's those be the you know you either have a higher standard of live well they couldn't've live with the bathroom as it be could they
S0439	oh no it be disgust
S0481	right so there we go so erm it be a do she say it be a i think she either take twenty thousand as a lump sum
S0481	or thirty and then they get seventeen thousand off ppi

S0439	well they probably have people all don't people won't trust them as much will they
S0440	no course they won't and they reckon it's gonna cost them fifty something billion now rather than the eighteen billion they've put aside because it
S0439	what happen
S0481	two
S0440	well someone put some cheat software into it
S0481	three
S0440	but it's throughout the throughout the audi range the the the erm

S0439	shit
S0440	whatever erm and and the americans
S0439	but they must have insurance

S0439	oh
S0440	insurance won't cover you for that

S0439	jj jackson so i don't know him
S0440	never hear of him
S0439	no me either
S0439	i dunno somebody apparently er she be waffle on about her first time when she be fourteen it's like that's great love you complete slag but no in america right they go on about you know like er the statutory rape if you have sex with somebody under the legal age of eighteen and then you have kim kardashian come out be like oh i have sex when i be fourteen it be great how could you ever condemn somebody for statutory rape
S0440	do you read that piece in the paper this week about this kid of twelve who's gonna have a baby
S0439	yeah i hear that yeah
S0440	and the boyfriend be now gonna be erm do
S0439	well i don't understand why the girls aren't do why the girls be always make out to be the victims because i'm pretty sure the twelve year old also probably know what she be do
S0481	there be two last week when women have do something to boys there be that one where the dad defend the woman
S0440	oh yeah the woman of the a teacher no not a teacher a babysitter of twenty two
S0439	oh yeah i hear that
S0440	have sex with a sex mad boy of eleven and the father who have previously have an affair with the girl or a relationship with the girl reckon she be so immature that the boy the boy egg her on so he be defend the girl and not the boy he would've just put it on as a a notch on his bed post he say
S0439	well what happen do would she get do
S0440	she get do but she didn't get put on the sex register didn't

S0440	have sex with a minor but she didn't get put on the sex offenders register
S0439	but how be that any different from a man have sex with an eleven year old girl
S0440	dunno
S0439	like i think that's just a it's such a double standard
S0440	it's cos the boy go the boy lead her on
S0439	so but how do you prove that a girl doesn't lead a boy on
S0440	you don't
S0439	it's really stupid to think that girls at school don't know what they're do like i be when we be invigilate some of the conversations you hear between year elevens and even year like tens and nines
S0440	yeah
S0439	what they're like fourteen thirteen years old talk about blowjobs i'm sorry
