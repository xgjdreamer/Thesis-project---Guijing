S0588	contrast
S0590	contrast that'll do beautifully yes
S0590	yes it be very actually it's a very good tablet that
S0589	aye
S0590	i'm erm oh yes so we fifth to the twenty second er it be mm and er that's in fact just over a week's time yeah er i be say that 's collection address be also and so i open our envelope you know and it say all about the chauffeur car will will be collect us at twelve twenty
S0588	chauffeur car
S0590	yes oh yes we collect by chauffeur car to take to take us to southampton
S0589	i couldn't resist it
S0588	oh
S0590	twelve twenty and it also say you know that there can be no change in their time they've all be fit in i actually think twelve if i be go to southampton for a departure at four pm i'd be set off a lot earlier than twelve twenty but it's up to them
S0588	yeah
S0590	but then i open up 's just to see what it say actually and she be be collect by chauffeur chauffeur drive car and obviously the same car twelve ten so
S0588	well
S0590	talk about to the minute but we'll we'll be well
S0589	same car or two cars
S0590	oh no the i'm sure it'll be a big people carrier sort of thing for the three of us
S0589	no it's each each er board member
S0590	well er yeah give that we're come from the same address i'm sure
S0589	mm there may be two cars i reckon
S0590	you think so
S0589	uhu it's all factor into your ticket price and
S0590	yeah well i i
S0589	please remove those now
S0590	i'll be a bite alarm to see set off in a car at twelve ten and there be no car follow to collect us
S0589	uhu
S0588	they'll probably arrive together
S0590	yeah no i won't like that
S0588	do you want another one
S0589	no i've have two bits aren't you go to have a bite
S0588	no i'm resist
S0590	mm i suppose it's possible that it could be two cars because of course they be they they're well aware that they're carry luggage for three weeks
S0589	yeah but then why they're time differently you would have think
S0590	you'd think they would have put two and two together
S0589	the metrics say
S0590	yeah
S0589	maybe not the fact that you might be travel together
S0590	yeah
S0589	but from this point a to b
S0590	yeah
S0589	you collect a at
S0590	twelve ten
S0589	twelve ten
S0590	or something or other yeah
S0589	in which case anyone leave from be
S0590	yeah
S0589	collect at twelve ten not
S0590	yeah
S0589	ten minutes later
S0590	yeah but er we'll we'll be well and truly ready by twelve erm because as i say the i think they'll need every minute of it yeah but er the i mean they they've obviously plan it so that people arrive for embark er without too much wait around although there be apparently a lounge with with er you know coffee and drink and whatever you want actually
S0589	but if you don't make it the boat sail on
S0590	they've get they be responsible for get us to the ship
S0589	be they then they fly you though if they if they don't get you there
S0590	yeah they they'd have to wouldn't they yeah i mean i'm well aware of the fact that and who build in even more than i do actually they be go to the isle of wight
S0589	uhu
S0590	and they leave hours before they need
S0589	mm
S0590	to get to southampton for the isle of wight ferry and they never make it
S0589	blimey
S0590	they completely miss it because they be they be erm gridlocked in their car they be take their car across the isle of wight as well the reason be that there be two big cruise ship these be two four thousand passengers things and if you've get something like seven eight thousand passengers disembark
S0589	uhu
S0590	and move out of southampton at the same as seven or eight thousand be embark you really have a major problem in southampton and the ridiculous situation be that the only way you can get from the harbour out of southampton be on road which be quite crazy because you know there there be a possible train link that they could actually take people out of the environment of southampton like a sort of park and ride on a rather grand scale well i have to say that lamb
S0589	good my dear
S0590	it it be i mean it be a lovely leg of lamb but you cook it absolutely superbly

S0588	there's a possibility of
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	something good at the end of it all
S0590	yeah
S0588	it be quite a big thing put on a whole exhibition and
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	really expensive as well
S0590	yeah yeah
S0588	everything have to be frame and
S0590	they have i mean the the course have really work them quite hard
S0588	uhu
S0590	actually
S0588	yeah
S0590	er and i think have introduce them to a lot of different
S0588	yeah
S0590	elements and things
S0588	mm
S0590	bring in a lot of different professionals it
S0588	yeah
S0590	i think it's be a very well design course i must get in touch with her and her flatmates because they their their landlord who like next door be a be a african gentleman but you know when they ask when they say that the boiler's break down or there's a hole in the roof and whatever he do actually repair it
S0588	yeah
S0590	pretty quickly
S0588	mm
S0590	but you know it's quite clear that the house be anything but energy efficient
S0588	mm
S0590	and from the from april the first of this year there be a legal requirement that landlords have to bring all their rent accommodation up to a certain level
S0588	and what be this level though
S0590	in well and
S0588	and how be they define level
S0590	erm the the energy efficiency of the house actually
S0588	oh i see just the
S0590	yes yes
S0588	the energy
S0590	the energy efficiency of a house
S0588	yeah
S0590	and i'm quite sure that their house will be well below it because it be not
S0588	mm
S0590	an energy efficient house at all actually
S0588	have they get central heat then
S0590	yeah yeah but it it's not you know it's not effective
S0588	it's not work
S0590	you know well you know the in fact he put in a new boiler or he get the no i think they put in a new boiler
S0588	mm
S0590	er they he have to repair the roof because somebody have find that there be a hole in the roof which be why the place be really so cold but er
S0588	well have it get insulation in the roof
S0590	no no yeah
S0588	mm
S0590	so i'm sure it will be below but er so maybe they this be a they be probably unaware of the april the first legislation as apparently it's an awful lot of landlords be
S0588	well
S0589	unaware i bet that one next door be unaware but i bet his tenant be unaware as well
S0588	yeah and er
S0590	yeah
