S0370	yeah somebody must make we need to search on the whole web
S0012	we do
S0370	now we know what we're ask for it's a one inch two three no three quarter to one inch adapter
S0012	yeah three quarter female
S0370	well i think if you put three quarter to one inch adapter it will pick it up won't it
S0012	yeah but you get to know the how many thread it be
S0370	the lathe well the lathes be all the same aren't they
S0012	i dunno
S0370	i would have though they be the same
S0012	yeah yeah yeah they probably would be
S0370	they're probably all the same
S0013	it should be standard shouldn't they
S0370	yeah so its proper cream cheese here
S0012	oh yeah
S0370	and you haven't open it
S0013	that's alright i'll finish off the old one
S0370	why do you buy oh i'll use that one
S0013	no it's alright
S0370	do you buy philadelphia rather than
S0012	when it's cheap
S0370	when it's cheap which it be sometimes actually
S0013	it be half price
S0012	it be half price
S0013	mm
S0370	be it why do they do that do you know i
S0013	i don't know the the the last it's to get the rid of the stock isn't it that's the idea
S0370	oh it's get near out of date
S0013	yeah
S0370	so they want to clear it up that's what it be yeah
S0013	they can't keep it there forever
S0370	but but to actually do it as a promotion they must have a lot of stock
S0013	mm
S0012	they must do
S0013	yeah
S0370	but i suppose they must have a lot of stock when you think of tesco's as a whole
S0012	yeah
S0370	they must have oodles of stock
S0013	they must do yeah such a difficult thing to do isn't it stock up a supermarket really hard work it must be
S0370	well
S0013	i don't like it
S0370	i reckon practically all of its computerise now
S0012	this be out of date next month
S0013	oh i see so that when you go through the checkout they know before
S0012	that's february january february
S0370	well you've get a tesco's card haven't you
S0012	this be seventeenth of the fourth
S0013	i think mm
S0012	yeah so it's
S0013	that's april
S0012	yeah but it's ain't near nearly out of date be it
S0370	that depend how many they've get
S0012	yeah
S0370	cos at at the checkout it also it also cos you use your card your tesco card it know your shop pattern
S0012	yeah
S0370	so it know that you buy philadelphia in june and july
S0013	clever oh yeah i suppose they do
S0370	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0370	so it know when you shop at tesco's so it know how much tesco's need in june and july
S0012	that's right to accommodate us
S0370	yeah and if you stop shop there you'll come off that database so you're
S0370	so i'm guess they've get quite sophisticate computerise stock control
S0013	yeah i guess they must have
S0370	so i doubt that they would if that's effective then they're not go to have load of stock lot of stock that's near its sell by date
S0013	but when it come to like season like like today valentine's day
S0370	yeah
S0013	they've have to bring in load and load of flower haven't they red roses and things
S0370	mm well they know what they sell last year
S0013	they do but they don't know if tesco's be do a better deal than morrison's or whatever
S0370	mm
S0013	or lidl even
S0370	yeah
S0013	it's difficult isn't it cos they're all try to fight they all think they're gonna sell load but it doesn't really mean that
S0012	the buyers have a heck of a job don't they
S0013	they do don't they it must be difficult
S0012	and if you're a good buyer then you're worth a lot of money at tesco's or morrison's
S0013	if you sell at the right price
S0012	but they must be i i couldn't work like that they must be on edge all the time so
S0370	mm it's what you get use to innit those bank dealers that be
S0012	oh yeah
S0370	move
S0012	move
S0370	millions and millions around every day it's just a number
S0012	yeah
S0013	it be yeah
S0012	and they've be they don't have any conscience anyway so they didn't care anyway that's the whole point about be a a an entrepreneur type person all you've get be
S0370	oh yeah mm mm that's what you're do you're deal
S0012	never mind you doesn't matter how you get em you can set up three hundred people to make another few
S0370	and i would argue that's one thing that the eastern muslims have get right and we've get wrong cos er a muslims you're not allow to invest the invest your money in a bank if it's not a risk
S0012	oh right
S0370	so you can't just invest your money know i get four percent return
S0013	right
S0370	you can invest your money in a business
S0013	mm
S0370	and if it do well you get a return if it doesn't you don't
S0013	like share then
S0370	yeah exactly you're not allow to make money that's usury in their mind
S0012	yeah
S0370	make money without any risk be wrong
S0013	mm
S0370	and i think it be
S0013	yeah
S0370	but most of our income in this country be do exactly like that
S0012	but if you be a muslim in this country as well you put you get ten percent of your money to the church
S0370	of your income
S0012	yeah
S0370	no it's of your total wealth
S0012	be it your total wealth or
S0370	mm mm
S0013	wow
S0012	each year
S0370	i think it go to charity
S0013	ten percent of your total wealth
S0370	mm
S0013	alright we've get we've get a house that doesn't mean to say we could afford to afford to put ten percent of this in
S0012	no we couldn't
S0370	yes but it's not income it's total wealth
S0012	yeah
S0013	that's what i mean this be this count as total wealth though isn't it
S0370	i suppose so i don't know
S0012	so we
S0013	so how would we afford to put in a percentage
S0370	you wouldn't
S0013	mm
S0370	mm i'm pretty sure it's not income it's wealth
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	well the muslims we we we know they be they share everything even the kid
S0013	mm
S0012	even the children
S0370	even the
S0012	the children
S0013	they all look after everyone else's
S0012	they be all look after
S0370	oh yeah
S0012	by the whole community
S0370	well that that's the same with er with the jewish religion
S0012	yeah
S0370	the kibbutz
S0013	yeah
S0012	they be lovely people with the kid
S0013	and any money that that's in the pool they have a pool don't they of money as well
S0370	yeah
S0013	not just religion be it
S0012	they help each other out
S0013	if someone want to borrow some money
S0370	now erm you remember who have the shop next door
S0013	mm
S0370	right when they come over when they be ugandan
S0013	right
S0370	but idi amin have kick them out
S0012	ooh yeah
S0013	right
S0370	right and what they do when they arrive they all agree to put in so much per month into the kitty and then they have a raffle to see who buy their own house first
S0012	ooh yeah
S0013	oh i see yeah
S0370	right so they all pay in and it be luck of the draw who get the house first
S0013	right
S0370	erm er and so their joint money you didn't borrow money to get a mortgage right you be borrow it for each other for nothing
S0013	yeah
S0012	oh yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	that's very similar to that er
S0013	it's good if it work
S0012	collective
S0370	well no money go out you see
S0012	yeah yeah there be a group of people who have the land they've buy buy the land and each of these people about ten pair build each other's house
S0370	oh right yeah
S0013	they all have different skills didn't they
S0012	they all
S0370	they're
S0013	opticians plumber bricklayer they they make sure they all have different skills
S0370	it sometimes doesn't work cos one of them be lazier than the others or
S0013	yeah cos as soon as one get their house you tend to
S0012	they don't want to do it any more
S0370	no no
S0013	yeah and there's always someone that work harder than the others isn't there
S0370	i don't begrudge it
S0013	mm
S0370	you know fair enough
S0013	it's good if it work mm
S0012	this be a massive gherkin
S0013	they be they're huge
S0370	cucumbers
S0012	mm
S0013	yeah they be cucumbers true
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	they're a bite rougher on the outside than the cucumbers though
S0370	gherkins be always prickly aren't they
S0013	mm we have grow them before
S0370	i have as well
S0013	mm never get round to pickle them really
S0370	well you don't get a lot of it and
S0013	no
S0370	perhaps they don't grow them well enough perhaps i should erm be more intense with the growth you know water them more fee them more
S0012	yeah with a cucumber you're only suppose to leave so many on the plant aren't you just for like a a
S0013	mm after so many leave you have to nip rip nip it out and it's difficult
S0012	well it the same with tomatoes you can nip em out when you get four
S0370	you mean four truss yeah
S0012	
S0370	probably should do cos the the young truss never come to much
S0012	they don't know
S0013	i do me do but them off when they get top of the glass
S0370	right
S0013	i do chop them then
S0370	now why do you isn't this one expensive or do you get this on special offer
S0012	no that be expensive yeah
S0013	no we try to get it when it's reduce at the moment
S0012	it go it use it use to be a pound piece now it's go up to one pound
S0013	sixteen
S0012	sixteen
S0370	but you can make your own
S0013	you can we have as well
S0012	we have make our own yeah
S0013	that be nice
S0370	be that your your liquidiser
S0012	yeah
S0370	your own could be nicer
S0012	but we're if you read the ingredients there's quite a lot of different stuff go into that
S0370	yeah some tomatoes that be go a bite soggy in the fridge
S0012	yeah
S0370	er and then it say vegetable juice right okay so eighty nine percent tomato juice
S0013	yeah i know
S0370	it's practically all tomato juice
S0013	yeah
S0370	and you can get that for half the price
S0012	and there's carrot and there's celery
S0370	and then there's ten percent of carrot celery beetroot parsley lettuce watercress spinach some salt some spice extract and that's it and it's make from concentrate
S0012	yeah we have yeah
S0370	both of them
S0013	it's good value though there's an awful lot of tomato in here
S0370	eighty nine percent tomato well you can buy
S0013	yeah but but a whole carton be a lot of tomato juice innit a lot of tomatoes
S0370	yeah i suppose so
S0013	we we actually only have you've see those little
S0370	yeah sorry i've have two glass of it
S0013	tank tankards
S0013	so yeah so we limit ourselves here i reckon reckon that it take two weeks
S0370	oh right well i just finish that
S0012	no but what we do now with this
S0370	you cut it up
S0012	well see that go down and
S0013	there's plenty in there leave you won't have to top it up again
S0370	you top it up
S0013	we tip it up again to get it out again won't you
S0370	no he's get it he's get it up so it's tip up already
S0013	yeah
S0012	and you and you don't tip it right out you tip in on the side
S0013	alright
S0012	alright that's how we've always do it
S0370	didn't you know that that's who you've always do it
S0012	well you're look look at me as though i'm daft
S0013	yeah when we when we think the whole thing be empty
S0012	well that's what i think it be empty till we shake it and then at that
S0370	i think it be empty yeah
S0013	yeah empty
S0370	cos passata now passata in if you buy passata
S0013	mm
S0370	you can get passata for thirty p
S0013	can you that's cheap
S0370	it be isn't it and it's really thick
S0012	yeah
S0370	and to be honest to turn it into tomato juice you would that could add his water to that couldn't he
S0012	mm
S0013	yeah we do have our own tomato juice the other day didn't we
S0012	yeah we do
S0370	erm do you think tomato juice be the bite that come out cos when you when you when i process my tomatoes i use process tomato juice for a soup a lot of it separate out
S0012	it do
S0370	in the jar
S0012	yeah
S0370	quiet distinctly
S0012	yeah
S0370	you know you get yellowy watery bite
S0012	that's right
S0370	and the tomato so do you think when they make tomato juice they squeeze the tomatoes and the juice that run off be the tomato juice and then they make passata out the rest
S0012	they might do that yeah
S0370	mm cos passata be sieve tomatoes
S0012	yeah
S0370	so the pip and the skin don't get through
S0013	mm we think this be er basically sieve as well cos if you zhuzh up i don't know like how you could use this but if you zhuzh up tomatoes you still get the little bits can't get rid of them
S0370	not if i no not if i do it in the in the amaze bullet thing
S0013	really it make it really
S0370	yeah
S0012	oh you've get a bullet have you
S0370	an amaze bullet
S0013	it that good
S0370	not a nurtibullet
S0012	not a nurtibullet
S0370	nutribullets cost a hundred quid
S0013	right
S0370	my amaze bullet be less than thirty pound
S0012	oh right
S0370	it's good actually i use
S0013	be it
S0370	yeah it's get two actually get more than two but it's get two basic you can use it as a liquidiser separately it's get a you know a a sort of mini liquidiser thing you can use it as a juicer it's get a juicer attachment
S0013	ooh right
S0370	okay and then it's get two different blade cutters one's for liquidiser do nutribullet drink basically and the other one's for chop up hard things
S0012	oh right
S0370	so i use it as a coffee grinder
S0012	oh do you
S0370	i don't buy grind coffee any more i buy bean
S0012	yeah
S0370	right and you just put a little bite i the bottom of the thing cos it's get little it's get little er not legs but little things so it stand when you stand it upside down
S0013	right
S0370	you unscrew the base put your bean up screw it up turn it round the other way it's because it's upside down that it work so well you see and then you just push and turn and twenty second i've get grind coffee
S0012	brilliant
S0370	and it's fresh grind coffee
S0012	we use to have a lovely coffee grinder and i find it one day and melt in the oven
S0370	in the oven
S0012	mm i've never forget it
S0013	no you haven't
S0370	be that you then
S0013	it be i put it in there to dry
S0370	oh right okay
S0013	in our little
S0370	now there be a guy who erm
S0013	i stupidly
S0370	didn't like his hamster any more he put it in the microwave
S0013	ooh dear
S0370	yeah to kill it cos he obviously couldn't bare it any longer
S0012	right
S0370	no he he get send to jail for nine weeks
S0013	really
S0370	he be in prison for nine weeks
S0012	what do he tell people that he do it do he
S0370	no somebody must have find out or
S0012	yeah oh gosh
S0370	do you know i i i i agree it's a horrid thing to do
S0012	yeah
S0370	but there be people who steal cars who get suspend sentence
S0013	they're
S0370	i think well
S0012	yeah there's a bloke who put his budgie in the microwave and that do blow up
S0370	what the budgie or the microwave
S0012	that blow the budgie up
S0370	probably well it's the same if you put meat in there it it cook doesn't it
S0012	yeah and if you don't prick the potatoes that'll go bang
S0013	and an egg
S0012	and an egg who put egg in and
S0013	i don't know someone do and they
S0012	and that just explode
S0370	and egg do yeah
S0012	the egg just explode
S0370	yeah they're actually begin to bring out i'm just amaze how slow they've be to do it erm microwave specific recipes now
S0012	oh right yeah
S0370	things like crème brûlée and so on and how to make them in a microwave
S0012	yeah
S0370	they never do microwave have always be almost always be treat as a sort of a something slightly better than a food warmer
S0012	yeah
S0370	and nothing more
S0013	we use to make out steam puddings and that in there didn't we
S0012	well yeah the
S0013	two minutes for steam pudding
S0370	a a steam pudding be five five minutes isn't it
S0013	yeah
S0370	whereas if you steam it in a ah they have the same
S0013	they're about the same cos they go hard very quick if you eat it straight fresh it's lovely but you can't keep it
S0370	oh right okay
S0013	mm
S0370	erm lakeland have buy out a microwave pressure cooker
S0012	really
S0013	that sound different
S0370	it do yeah yeah twenty five quid it be so it look like a well it look like a flat microwave
S0013	yeah
S0370	but it's make out of very rigid plastic it's still get a pressure valve and everything on it
S0013	mm
S0012	mm
S0013	mm
S0012	well that one it's suppose to be an oven a grill
S0370	yeah
S0012	everything you can imagine it's a combi whatever
S0370	yeah same as we've get yeah
S0012	and we've all we've do be use the microwave
S0013	basically
S0012	superb jacket potatoes
S0013	yeah but basically it's reheat you know old cook
S0012	yeah make cocoa at night
S0370	scramble egg i make in the microwave
S0012	yeah you can do that too
S0013	much much better than cook
S0012	and custard it's easy to make
S0370	i do custard in the microwave yeah doesn't she still do it in the saucepan but
S0013	it take such a long time stand there in a saucepan
S0370	but i'm sure there be improve ways of cook in the microwave
S0013	mm
S0370	trouble be its size you see really if you're go to cook a meal in the microwave you need four of em
S0012	yeah there there be new ones out now
S0370	like a hob you get to treat it like a hob and an oven
S0012	the new ones out have two two different level
S0370	oh yeah
S0013	well i've get two different level
S0370	you can put a shelf in
S0013	there be a shelf it's a new larder
S0370	but you'd need more than that you need the different because it's so short time you need you need four of them to do it all at the same time don't you
S0013	yes you do yeah
S0012	yeah
S0013	it's useless
S0370	and it's a different style instead of plan on cook a meal over an hour you plan cook a meal over eight minutes
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	but if you're reheat so you've get stuff leftover you're reheat like five people's things it's it take about fifteen minutes more you might as well put the oven on sometimes
S0012	yeah yeah
S0370	yeah because you're in and out and in and out
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm and then you're not all eat at once so you've get to get to put the one's you do first back in don't you
S0012	yeah yes and one and another thing we find when you heat a microwave reheat a dinner on a in a bigger microwave like you make your potatoes and stuff on it's all steam hot and lovely but it don't hold the heat
S0013	yeah they do go down don't he
S0012	it seem to get colder quicker
S0370	well that's illogical isn't it
S0012	it be it be but that's what it seem
S0370	the only explanation of that must be that it's not fully heat right the way through
S0012	well it could be
S0013	that's normally the case
S0370	microwave don't heat form the out inside out
S0012	no they don't know
S0370	in fact
S0012	no
S0370	that's a fallacy
S0012	but we'll often go through there with our dinner which be steam hot out of the microwave get through there start to eat it and think ah
S0370	i think it's because it at a certain foods absorb the microwave more than others
S0012	yeah they do yeah
S0370	get more excite and hot whereas other bits don't
S0012	mm
S0370	the same in the one that you know polystyrene doesn't take heat away from your hand so it feel warm
S0012	yeah
S0370	that kind of
S0013	yeah you've get to
S0370	but yeah i i don't think people ever cook effectively in microwave until there's you can buy a bank of them that's what they apparently in the real big posh
S0013	whoop
S0370	the real big posh restaurants all use a whole bank of they've get a bank of microwave and they sell you know when you have a erm you know a steam pudding with a chocolate fill inside
S0012	yeah
S0370	well you can't be cook those as they're order
S0012	no
S0370	they're precook and the only way you can do it and i think it's because the the dense liquid absorb the heat
S0012	yes yeah
S0370	be in a microwave
S0012	yeah
S0370	you have to you have to microwave at the bottom of the microwave cos then you get the warm sponge and the hot inside
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0370	hot liquid inside
S0013	it be great for warm things
S0370	now there's other thing that a a you know a posh chef would not dream of cook in a microwave
S0012	that's right that's right
S0013	mm
S0012	i use to do deliver up to this club up in and er they use to do dinners and i've be in the kitchens to take the milk in and they have all dinners out cauliflower broccoli potatoes all in little bits they they must have buy buy a boy in ready to cook all lay out in big
S0013	that's all they do really
S0012	tubs and that's all they do
S0370	it wasn't cook
S0013	no
S0012	it wasn't cook they'd buy it all in load of that cook
S0370	oh it be cook
S0013	oh it be cook
S0012	yes it be cook
S0013	partially cook yeah
S0012	partially cook and all they have to do be heat it up in the microwave
S0013	mm
S0370	mm
S0013	just put it on the plat
S0012	and they have box and box of these all the vegetables you can imagine cos when when people be four people order dinner they order their dinner they all want their dinner at once
S0370	mm yeah
S0012	you'll see all the
S0013	innit
S0370	mm i agree yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	what be you up to
S0370	she's tidy up
S0013	just clear it up
S0012	scrap out the last of the cream cheese from the bosom in the bottom of the dungeon
S0013	yeah well it's go to go straight in the recycle bin now you don't have to wash it
S0370	well i think wash actually waste the total value of recycle
S0013	it do
S0370	the amount of water people do do you know lot of people put their can to recycle in the dishwasher before they put them in the recycle
