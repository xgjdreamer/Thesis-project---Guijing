S0179	yes um
S0058	look quite smart
S0179	yeah so they've still keep all of the original sort of er wooden beam and floor and what not but they've just change all of the interior fittings actually i think they have i think
S0091	have you be there before
S0058	mm i've be i think three time
S0091	oh my good gracious
S0179	no it's only twice
S0058	oh i've be yeah only i've be twice sorry yeah
S0179	because i go you didn't come with me at easter in first year you come at easter second year
S0058	mm
S0179	you didn't go on easter third or fourth year so
S0058	right
S0179	so
S0058	it's twice
S0179	yeah twice kind of feel like more
S0058	oh dear
S0179	mm
S0058	that be the first time i hear your dad sing in falsetto
S0091	have it change much over the years
S0179	um not much no um
S0091	doesn't doesn't belong to the same people now
S0179	no
S0091	er they move didn't they and they they next door
S0179	mm so they still own
S0091	they've move over to that in the valley
S0179	yeah
S0091	mm
S0179	er and they convert the barn which be next to the cottage
S0091	yeah
S0179	um it's a spectacular house now it's huge
S0091	mm
S0179	er well you know like build things
S0091	sorry
S0179	er like build things a lot so he's get his little um he's get a a barn with about four or five different mini tractors in it
S0179	it's a nice hobby if you can afford it build a big house
S0179	for yourself to live in
S0058	mm
S0058	very nice
S0179	mm and i don't think he trust anyone else
S0091	mm
S0179	to do it right so he just build it himself he get sort of er his crew of builders in but er he do most
S0058	mm
S0179	of the work
S0058	yeah mm
S0179	and he's sort of push seventy now actually he's
S0058	be he
S0179	mm
S0058	wow
S0179	i think so well that's why they sell the cottages cos they be sort of semi retire then he get bore and build another house
S0058	excellent
S0091	get rid of it he oh do he
S0179	no they sell the most of the cottages
S0091	mm
S0179	but they've um still own the one which be by itself
S0091	next door to where they live
S0179	yeah
S0091	mm
S0179	so that's where we'll probably go and stay apart from anything else they let us still let us have it very cheaply um as in the price be constant throughout the year so it doesn't increase in summer and they haven't increase it over the last five years so
S0091	mm
S0179	sort of inflation adjust hasn't really happen
S0058	yeah which make it much cheaper than pretty much anywhere else er i think for a similar level of
S0179	yeah it's half the price it should be
S0058	mm
S0179	but they don't let it commercially they just let it to um sort of er people they know
S0091	mm
S0179	i could ring them tonight actually
S0058	mm
S0179	find out when it's available
S0058	you could do oh there
S0091	i can remember you cheat at play card in the
S0091	in the corner in the corner
S0179	i can remember be falsely accuse of cheat in the corner
S0058	um no i i i can i can believe that
S0091	of falsely accuse or cheat
S0058	no no cheat
S0179	yes i'm try to teach sarah to play chess
S0091	cheat be wrong
S0179	well it's easy when your when your opponent doesn't know the rule
S0058	so you can just make up new rule
S0179	actually um we be in theory go to learn to play bridge at some point soon
S0058	hm
S0179	um cos um so my not my boss at work but the guy who's project manage a lot of the work i'm do um he and his wife be avid bridge players and they have ask us if we'd like to play them at some point which would also involve them teach us to play
S0179	apparently it's similar to whist which i do know cos you teach me that but i'm not um a hundred percent sure it look really complicate on the score card
S0091	i use to play it i couldn't i couldn't now
S0179	mm do you use to play in the navy
S0091	oo i don't know what it be in
S0179	i'm sure oh no it's er cos you use to tell me that you and um you and a friend of yours
S0091	oh yes but
S0179	have er like a championship thing
S0091	mm
S0179	whist or bridge or it wouldn't have be poker would it
S0091	no it be bridge
S0058	mm
S0179	didn't you use to win load of money do that
S0179	i think that's a yes
S0179	but um yeah it should be nice because they've get the um at farm they've get the swim pool the outdoor one
S0091	oo that that's a long time ago ain't it
S0179	mm well cos we never use to go when it be hot enough to use but hopefully this year we can actually go in the summer and er wrangle its use
S0058	it's heat isn't it
S0179	i think so can you remember if it's heat be it heat or not i'm not sure
S0091	i don't think so
S0058	mm
S0179	mm see i don't but it say it's possible it's moderately heat
S0058	unless they've do it recently mm not sure why you'd
S0058	yeah maybe
S0179	have you have your um
S0091	mm
S0179	sushi er can i suggest put a little bite of this on it it's er soy sauce
S0179	um
S0058	mm you do get wasabi
S0091	have it change much down there
S0179	no it's all pretty similar um
S0091	down at the down at the beach i mean not in the cottages
S0179	oh that's exactly the same that hasn't change in decades
S0179	um actually no it have some of the you know the little shop there use to be um near the beach where you could buy ice cream and what not
S0091	yes
S0179	well i think they've mostly go bankrupt um that's not surprise though they can't have get a lot of custom um i think there's still one there ah yeah we buy a huge last summer we buy a huge inflatable dinghy
S0179	um and have some fun with that in the cos you know coniston the lakes
S0091	yeah
S0179	well we go camp um on a campsite right next to the shore um so we buy this dinghy and er sort of er blow it up and then we actually take it sort of swallow and amazons style we go right the way across the lake and then back again
S0058	it be good fun
S0179	i'm not sure how we do that without sink
S0179	but we manage it somehow
S0058	we have a picnic on the shore on the other side really nice
S0179	and then i sort of swim back um which be quite fun um
S0058	mm we could take that to wales and use it in um
S0179	wales
S0058	wales and use it in the um what's the cove call the quite shelter where we go last time
S0179	er oh no
S0058	well yeah we could
S0179	um
S0058	take the dinghy there
S0179	you have to be careful use stuff like that in the sea
S0058	cos you still think er you'd be in danger of er drift
S0179	you'd need to be very careful as to where you go coves be better than un coves i would say
S0058	that's what i be think but
S0179	well no what we'd all we'd do be we'd make sure we have a lifejacket in it and to be fair i can probably tow it back
S0058	mm
S0179	if we have currents um
S0058	in all fairness if we all get in and tow it
S0179	well can everyone swim
S0091	do you want some more tea
S0058	um
S0179	er no thank you i'm er i'm good oh er sorry it be the last bite of cheese
S0058	that's alright i've have a few bits you're a fiend for the cheese
S0179	that be true i've be know to be fiendish
S0179	about the cheese um
S0058	yeah i can't imagine a tide where you couldn't get it back in but then i could get in and swim as well seb could get in and swim as well
S0058	she can sit in the boat and
S0058	get tow
S0179	it's my new ambition like to get her in the water somehow
S0058	she's never swim have she
S0179	no
S0179	um so um so that's quite good fun but it be really so when we be in on um in the dinghy all of us be get er sort of strip off prior to jump in there be a national trust sort of pleasure um cruise boat go past
S0091	hm
S0179	and they be look at me slightly oddly
S0179	i don't think it have occur to them that it be possible to swim in the lake
S0058	i be worry about the massive
S0091	weren't you cold on the
S0179	no it be fine
S0091	mm

S0179	um i'm fairly confident we give it back to you
S0091	pardon
S0179	i'm fairly sure we give it back to you
S0091	it's probably on the roof then
S0058	mm
S0179	cool
S0179	um
S0058	er anyway
S0179	what else do
S0091	how do i get hold of it though do you remember
S0179	sorry
S0091	do you remember how i get hold of it
S0179	well you definitely tell me it be a tank flag
S0091	pardon
S0179	you definitely tell me it be from a tank but i can't imagine cos you spend most of the war in the um pacific didn't you
S0091	well yeah
S0179	in india or
S0091	in
S0179	yeah
S0091	pacific
S0179	so i can't quite imagine how you get hold of a german flag
S0179	as in you well you you be never in the mediterranean or north africa
S0091	no i be in
S0179	oh right
S0091	mm mm
S0179	um oh that's probably when then maybe hang on malta er or hang on crete
S0091	i can't er i can't think where i get it from now
S0179	well do you get it from someone else or do you get it from sort of an actual
S0091	i can't remember er what it come from
S0179	no um
S0091	it probably probably come from north africa
S0179	yeah i be think that
S0058	mm
S0091	yeah
S0179	the most likely bet um
S0179	oh the something interest i find out the other day it turn out one of my um at one of my supervisors um be a spitfire pilot in north africa
S0091	mhm
S0179	probably his tail wheel you've get
S0058	he want it back
S0179	oh
S0058	who's that
S0179	the the guy who refuse to retire um
S0179	yes he's er he's still doggedly teach um the um yeah i think they'd sort of the the department make him retire when he hit eighty but he's um be continue to teach in college um and show no sign of stop
S0179	it'll be a great shame if he do he's by far the most entertain supervisor imaginable
S0179	um
S0058	do you get lot of stories or be he just good
S0179	well no but when you get sort of examples of materials' properties illustrate with stories of dogfight
S0179	you start to think yes
S0179	not quite sure how we get onto this
S0179	um remember it anyway
S0179	um what else be there cos there be a er some ration book
S0058	mm
S0179	um i think an identity card and just er load of little bits and then the large bits
S0091	where i've get them no do you
S0179	i think you're probably right and they're in your loft um
S0179	it's er come up with a small museum
S0179	you could open a small museum
S0179	um so yes that be the er very memorable um
S0058	yeah
S0179	world war ii
S0058	i think we have one like that and i take in my mum's ration book because she er i think they be still ration when she be bear
S0179	yes they would've be
S0058	so in in
S0091	it go on for a long time after the war
S0058	mm cos she be bear in fifty two so um sort of when she be until she be kind of one or two i think she have a a ration book um so i think i take that in for my er my world war ii day
S0179	cos you know at um at the imperial war museum
S0091	pardon
S0179	you know
S0091	yes
S0179	er well they've get a er a nineteen forties nineteen fifties prefab there um you know one of the er sort of er what do you call them like the er so the um the build they just put up
S0091	mhm mm
S0179	um all over the place and er you can go round it it's really interest
S0058	so like a quick er kind of house to replace
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah i know what you mean
S0091	i mean there be quite er good ones you could build
S0179	well it's bigger than our house
S0091	pardon
S0179	it's bigger than our house
S0091	be it
S0179	that's the depress thing
S0058	yeah
S0179	i mean admittedly we've get you know a flat screen television which they didn't but
S0179	and a gas oven
S0179	but put that aside they've get it have everything
S0091	yeah
S0058	mhm
S0179	it have a larder
S0058	i guess they be brand new so they could
S0179	mm
S0058	make them kind of up to date
S0179	yeah cos you have a er a council house er mum tell me after
S0091	mm um it be somewhere near um er you know the garrison place between here and london what's it call
S0179	um not sandhurst presumably
S0091	no not sandhurst close to sandhurst
S0179	warminster
S0091	pardon
S0179	warminster
S0091	no
S0179	er no i've not no idea um
S0058	mm
S0179	but um but yeah again that would've be a good thing at the time presumably house wise
S0091	somewhere just beyond um um tut stonehenge
S0179	chelmsford
S0091	that's much farther along
S0179	um ah think of far away um last weekend we go up to see um tut to see um 's parent in sunderland er because your grandfather have just um come out of hospital um he be in sort of ten days or so for a heart operation um and the um so we go to see him but then on the saturday we wander about and have a look at we go to hadrian's wall
S0091	mhm
S0179	we try to go to kielder and fail um because it turn out there be no petrol station anywhere in northumberland
S0179	and they're all they're all close down and we get as far as i think it be
S0058	mm it be it's
S0179	and there be one there
S0058	yeah
S0179	but it close at lunch time and we be there at one o'clock
S0179	so we end up have er a full english breakfast in a a sort of all day english breakfast in a
S0058	mm
S0179	café and er come back to hexham er to find some fuel and then wander off to um chesters
S0058	yes it be
S0179	chesters
S0058	it's the er the er the roman fort
S0091	chester
S0179	chesters
S0091	chester no
S0179	chesters it's on the um it's er this it's er sort of newcastle end of hadrian's wall and it's get the sort of the best preserve bath house um anywhere in the country so i think it's no english heritage cos they didn't let me in
S0058	mhm
S0179	free
S0058	yeah
S0179	so it's quite good cos we can still pretend to be students
S0179	which make life cheaper
S0058	yes
S0179	cos do you know how much a cinema ticket cost nowadays um it's sort of eight nine pound
S0091	goodness gracious
S0058	yeah
S0179	whereas if you're a student you can get in for about five or six
S0091	blimey
S0179	and it's sort of it's one of those situations where i don't think it's reasonable to pay nearly ten pound to see one film
S0058	it's terrible
S0179	um it's horrendous um so um yeah i've still get a few years leave before my student card run out so
S0058	i've get unlimited years
S0179	yes
S0179	because um because work for the university press her work card look like a student card
S0058	so i go in and flash my work card and oh a student excellent i'm enjoy that
S0179	yes i'm surprise no one's try to stop this before now
S0058	but if only think it apply to so few people that they're not too worry in all fairness it it be different but just people don't realize why it's different
S0179	well there's a tiny strip cos on most student card there's a er
S0058	card
S0179	see on most student card in that corner there's a tiny bite of colour um your thumb's over it at the moment
S0179	um so just there
S0091	oh yeah
S0179	and that's the college colour
S0091	mhm
S0179	um but if it doesn't have that that mean you're a member of staff not a student but it's quite subtle
S0058	so if you you know if you go into the and flash it and the they don't they're not gonna notice whether it's get the college colour
S0179	mm
S0179	it's it's my serial killer photograph
S0179	oh dear
S0179	speak of which i

S0058	hm what
S0179	while everyone's eat
S0058	mm
S0179	one person talk
S0058	yeah be it my turn
S0179	yes
S0058	mm
S0058	anything else
S0179	ikea do that lamp in black
S0058	quite smart
S0179	mm
S0058	i think silver go quite nicely cos we've get the silver
S0179	silver curtain
S0058	yeah
S0179	i be say that we've get that lamp in our live room um
S0179	except it's in silver not black
S0058	mm
S0179	so it match our curtain
S0179	yes um er when we move in we have er after a week live there we have both er both set of our mother sew curtain
S0179	they have a little production line it be fantastic
S0179	uh
S0058	well we have you and your dad do all the diy
S0179	mhm
S0058	and my dad and your mum do curtain and me
S0179	and your dad sort of keep out the way
S0058	yeah he's not good at diy
S0179	no
S0091	have you buy the house in er
S0179	cambourne
S0091	mm
S0179	yes
S0091	mm
S0179	mm
S0179	mm it's ridiculous so the mortgage that we pay on the er two bedroom house be only fifty pound a month more than the rent which be pay for one room in
S0091	mm
S0058	that's the difference i mean that's the difference between right in the centre of and sort of how about thirteen miles out
S0179	eight
S0058	eight miles out sorry
S0179	no seven
S0091	there isn't much accommodation in be there
S0179	well
S0058	um er
S0179	well there's tons but there's
S0058	mm um
S0179	also a huge demand for it
S0091	mm
S0058	so it's all very expensive
S0179	um cos there's two universities there plus a lot of sort of businesses employ young professionals um so the rental market's huge
S0058	so they can charge
S0091	mm
S0058	ridiculous amount for not very nice
S0091	that it's build up now right down to the station
S0179	mm
S0058	mm
S0091	when i be the station be about oo er let's think half a mile out of out of the town
S0058	wow now it go past the station it's
S0179	a long way past
S0058	yeah gosh
S0179	well it's now link up to what would have be separate villages so like er cherry hinton
S0058	mm
S0179	um would probably have be a few miles away from cambridge it's now part of cambridge
S0091	mhm
S0179	um actually have you get a map we can have a look at it after lunch
S0058	mm mm so like milton as well be probably a completely separate place
S0179	mm
S0058	and now it's just north cambridge
S0179	but um yes bottom line um buy rather than rent definitely the way to go um it's infinitely cheaper to get something of the same size and quality let alone the fact you end up own it
S0058	mm
S0179	um
S0058	no we're er we're very please with it it's it's good it's very comfortable which be the main thing i think
S0179	mm
S0058	mm
S0179	and we've start cook roast dinners
S0179	which be a skill in itself
S0179	um er cos of the two time we've do it so far mum and dad have come and sort of we've do it under mum's close supervision
S0179	um
S0058	but yeah this weekend we've get a friend come round and we have to do it ourselves i don't know how that's gonna work we'll be fine
S0179	there's a hospital near us right
S0091	well you use to help me cook didn't you
S0179	er yeah i can cook
S0058	mm
S0179	i just never roast dinners be something special i mean er
S0179	anything where you're cook over a period of more than three hours
S0179	be er
S0058	i think it's er it's not the actual like skill it's the time that's hard so you you need to know exactly when to put each bite in
S0179	mm
S0058	otherwise you'd end up with a burn bite and a uncooked bite
S0179	yeah incidentally um would you like the last strawberry i think it be yours
S0091	mm
S0179	yeah
S0058	do you want some mango er it's not it's not
S0179	mango
S0091	um no thank you
S0179	be you sure 's gonna finish it otherwise
S0091	oh alright
S0179	explode
S0058	yeah too much mango
S0179	oh dear ah but um
S0058	mm the only thing we haven't actually make yet be we've never bake anything
S0058	cos er we haven't bake a cake yet no we should it would er
S0179	i'm not into bake there's things i'd rather do with my life
S0179	um so um we've be spend a now that um i'm start work and no longer at uni i've get a lot of free time um so i've be spend a lot more time um exercise
S0091	mm
S0179	in various form so ah you'll be interest in this my goal for well next summer now um it be this summer but it sort of change a bite um be to swim the channel
S0091	doubt that you will
S0179	that's a good reaction
S0091	nobody's do it for a long time though
S0179	yeah they do it fairly regularly
S0091	be that because it's it's nothing now sort of thing
S0179	no exactly i mean it's still the the total number that's do it be still in the hundreds so i think it's under like eight hundred people have do it throughout history
S0091	mm
S0179	er
S0091	i can remember the first swim
S0179	it be in nineteen eleven
S0058	the first swim you do
S0091	mm
S0179	oh i do right
S0179	the first er yes it be in it be in luton wasn't it in
S0091	pardon
S0179	it be in luton i think
S0179	probably um anyway um i'm swim now i'm swim twice a week run twice a week and some sort of weight train twice a week um as be
S0058	mm
S0179	um we've er get her do full push up
S0058	cos normally for girls they say oh put your knees down and you can't do the full ones but i don't believe in that i'll do full ones um
S0179	it be quite good be able to shout at you
S0179	an excuse
S0058	yeah but we're um we've both enter the um the cambourne er ten k run as well which be in april um sort of all the way round the outside of the the town which which'll be nice
S0179	mm cos there's load of nice um sort of because of this the town be build from scratch there's load of er nice bridleways and footpaths and er what not there's also about four lakes
S0058	yeah they've they've put in lot of a few too many
S0179	they also get one up on the ordnance survey er because they've build a hill since the ordnance survey do the the um map of the village so the the contour line aren't now strictly accurate
S0058	it's a nice hill i'm glad they build it
S0179	mm good to run up
S0058	yeah
S0179	i say good to run up painful to run up
S0179	but um
S0058	mm
S0179	um
S0058	so yeah so i'm i'm train for that um we've get we've get six six weeks
S0179	something in that ballpark
S0058	mm
S0179	um what else have be happen um now i can't remember what um oh um volvo be release a new car um which have get an airbag for pedestrians which be slightly strange er so the idea be it use radar um on the front of it and if it detect that you're go to hit a pedestrian an airbag pop out of the bonnet
S0091	well how how do it work then because er you'd need something till it'll respond don't you
S0179	um no it it well it use er half radar half um tut tu tu tu tu a um it's get an er it's get a camera er like a video camera
S0091	mm
S0179	and it have image process so it can tell if a shape on the camera look like a person and if it think you're about to hit it um it brake the car automatically um and deploy the airbag
S0058	so the bonnet pop up and then it
S0179	mm
S0058	come out
S0091	and the same if you get too close to a car
S0179	yeah
S0058	mhm
S0179	um
S0058	how's it
S0179	only then it doesn't use the airbag it just brake
S0091	what happen to the bloke behind you
S0058	you need an airbag at the back as well for them to to bounce off
S0179	mm well it seem like er quite an interest idea i'd love to see that work
S0058	yeah
S0091	mm
S0058	well there'll probably be videos of it they'll release um
S0179	yeah
S0058	cos don't they do like crash test
S0179	yes
S0058	videos so there'll probably be one of this airbag they'll have a like a figurine a a crash test dummy stand and
S0179	mm
S0179	be quite fun and of course it cover the windscreen so it do raise the slight problem that if it's deploy actually no the brake will be on if it's deploy
S0058	mm
S0179	so you're not go anywhere anyway
S0179	um
S0091	do they still make cars with airbags in the steer wheel
S0179	oh yes yeah oh but nowadays cars tend to have about seven airbags inside so you have one in the steer wheel one in front of the front seat passenger um one each side of the so in the side of the driver's seat and the side of the passenger's seat one for the driver's knees
S0179	and then ones along the windows
S0091	and where do where do the passengers sit
S0058	yeah
