S0198	it be her that have that bite yeah at least she know what to come back with
S0230	mm
S0198	i hate it when people it's always americans come up to us abroad and go oh i'll have to say something or give you some advice about something i'm like no
S0198	just cos i'm white too although they're all probably around dad's age
S0198	compel to talk to people
S0230	that be that weren't far from those sex shop either
S0198	oh wasn't it
S0230	no
S0198	find their way down there too
S0230	i think it be a mother and daughter cos she be sort of my age and she be with an older woman
S0198	oh right i think you'd say be gonna say her daughter be sort of my age
S0230	no and they'd come in on a erm cruise ship
S0198	oh yeah
S0230	they be do a
S0198	probably then you do see like a few like package tour as well for belgium come up on online and stuff like that
S0230	mm
S0198	i saw one the other day cos on trainline you see it a lot and then you can go over on the eurostar or whatever but erm there be one for the christmas market cos that's an expensive time of the year to go there and it it be really like five days or something be like eight hundred pound or something
S0230	really
S0198	mm
S0230	but that be everything i should imagine that'd be your meals as well i would have think
S0198	i don't know maybe maybe the accommodation
S0230	mm
S0198	i think it's just five nights and accommodation erm maybe some meals time of the year though those christmas market in europe be really popular all fairytale like there be some more napkins here dad if you need them
S0229	no
S0198	well do you want a bite more flake mum no ah i get the special one do i finally have our mr whippy and a flake at the beach
S0229	how do you how do you how do you end up with two flake
S0198	cos they give us one
S0198	wasn't pay attention maybe
S0230	no
S0198	stick one in stick another in
S0230	and that it it be her that say they be suppose to have stop at brussels
S0198	oh yeah
S0230	but because the traffic be so bad that they didn't cos it would have take too long to have get into brussels and they wouldn't have have have enough time then
S0229	that that that help me make my mind up anyway
S0230	so they they erm
S0198	oh do it
S0230	yeah so they spend two days at antwerp instead but she say we're not at all worry she say it's lovely here
S0198	yeah yeah i mean people people want to go to the capitals but i dunno why i think i'd rather potter around somewhere like nice in england than london
S0230	yeah
S0198	if you only have a couple of days you've gotta know where you're go in a city more i think than the big city
S0230	mm
S0198	how big be bruges it be smaller than antwerp be it
S0230	i think so
S0198	mm
S0229	it be still big though weren't it
S0230	but it be big yeah
S0229	huge
S0230	well it be smaller than antwerp
S0198	mm different style be it be there still like european architecture in antwerp as well
S0230	mm
S0229	but antwerp you could walk up the main road do a leave if we'd have know we could have do a leave up some step and be there
S0198	oh right
S0229	that's how the difference be if you know your way about do you remember that bite dear along the front when we come down the step we could have go up then to start with
S0230	yeah but that be that be still a lovely long way along there
S0229	i know but it be still quicker than go right round like we do
S0198	you're too far away what be you sit out there for you're get your ice cream everywhere
S0229	stretch my leg out and the cars'd be drive along and then you see them do a leave across a footpath but they be allow to
S0198	oh really
S0229	all road yeah
S0230	yeah they've get like footpath the instead of the road go up there it's make into a footpath and they drive over the footpath
S0229	over the footpath
S0198	mm
S0230	to go up the side roads
S0198	to cut to cut up the side road
S0230	mm
S0229	if you know where you're go it's so quick and easy but like me and mum we never have a bloody clue
S0230	no
S0229	there's nothing in english
S0198	erm i didn't know they cycle so much there
S0230	yeah
S0198	make sense
S0230	in antwerp
S0198	yeah
S0230	a lot a lot of cycle
S0229	thousands of bike
S0198	mm i feel like there's a load here but that's cos you just don't see them that often in england
S0230	mm
S0229	yeah that'd be nothing to what's over there
S0198	no yeah i bet not
S0229	you could walk you could walk from here to that pier and there's row of bike on most everywhere you go
S0198	you'd probably quite like go to holland actually
S0230	mm
S0198	it's even smaller they'll have flea market and stuff as well
S0229	we do a leave and a right
S0198	and they're basically bilingual
S0229	come out and have our own with row of bike
S0230	yeah i do think a lot of erm
S0198	a lot of european countries be french italy spain not so much they're not quite so good at it
S0230	no
S0198	but erm germany holland scandinavia in general they're all really good at english
S0230	our television in erm the room as well have a pick up bbc one
S0198	yeah
S0229	yeah
S0198	i think that's why they get really good at it i think i i assume they just you know have a really good education system for it which i think it's not bad but the girl the dutch girl on my course be do it she didn't start learn at school until she be eleven and they have english television
S0230	mm
S0198	with no subtitle
S0230	mm
S0198	and it's a part of their culture almost now like but you'll hear young people talk dutch but then talk english and stuff like that like they they see constant in their own culture
S0230	mm
S0198	and they have do for a long time apparently be say actually he's do creoles and pidgins which be you know what creoles be it's like the english they talk in the caribbean it's what probably speak it's english but not quite english
S0230	yeah
S0198	it's it's come from english erm master
S0230	mm
S0198	when they have like the slave and stuff like that erm and he say interestingly cos the dutch be really good at it he say that they typically have always they have their own empire didn't they and they always make a point of try to talk in the in the lingua franca and whatever language be necessary to communicate in rather than tell talk in dutch so he say there's less dutch pidgins around the world because creoles around the world because they never speak to their slave in dutch anyway
S0230	ah
S0198	they would have try talk to them in english or something else so it seem like it's just be a part of their culture for centuries so talk in other languages and whatnot and we never do that in english basically
S0230	yeah we're lazy with the languages
S0198	mm
S0230	terribly lazy
S0198	yeah shockingly so but there's not as much of a requirement for us to learn it to learn another language cos it take a lot of hard work and you've gotta have a real reason to put in that much work to get that good at a language
S0230	mm
S0198	and er if our job or whatever depend on it then maybe more people would be motivate but they don't
S0230	well if you go and
S0198	live somewhere else yeah
S0230	like do
S0198	mm never mind eh see how well my french how good my french get

S0198	as tall as you or taller yeah
S0230	i'll have a ten year old grandson taller than me
S0198	cor i hope he doesn't get too tall
S0230	i think he's gonna i think he's gonna get bigger than

S0230	and he'll end up about six foot four six foot five
S0198	bloody hell
S0229	he still hold my hand when i take him to school
S0198	oh no
S0229	yeah
S0198	he's still a little one isn't he he's kind of soft really in some ways isn't he
S0230	oh he be he be he be quite erm soft as well
S0198	well yeah it's have his grandad baby him and be an only child
S0230	and be an only child as well probably
S0198	have a mum and dad on and off all the time
S0229	yeah bloody good job we be there
S0230	i think it's accept now that's permanently off
S0198	oh yeah i don't think they'll go down that route again
S0229	nah
S0198	try it that one last time
S0198	i think they get moments of affection for their share over probably spar it but
S0230	you never know she might marry
S0198	she really like him
S0230	yeah i know
S0198	she's just get to not be too divvy and lose him
S0230	yeah
S0198	he's gotta put up with her yeah
S0229	round that way
S0198	go round that way yeah he might
S0230	and i think he short of a few bob either
S0198	no that's probably quite appeal
S0230	yeah
S0198	but you'd think he'd want his own kiddies wouldn't you but she swear she's not gonna have any more
S0230	perhaps he don't
S0198	it's true
S0229	well if he do they're not come down mine to bloody look after i'll stick to my little mate and that'll be it for me

S0229	either
S0198	go to his other grandparents
S0229	no favour
S0198	if anything happen little 's get old enough for it not to correlate

S0198	okey dokey pig in a pokey
S0230	okey dokey pig in a pokey
S0229	look at the little blonde haired girls look
S0198	yeah cause it's pig and pokey cos dad read some er read something this morning erm like you know like bric a brac and what you just say a pig in a pokey and
S0230	mm
S0198	odds and sod all this kind of thing there's a reason like we would never do it the other way round and it's something to do with the vowel sound
S0230	ah
S0198	so it and ah pig and poke would make more sense than poke and pig it just doesn't sound right do it
S0230	no
S0198	because we do the i think there's something about the certain vowel before another vowel
S0230	ah
S0198	i'm can't sure bric and brac pig and poke yeah i guess it's the short vowel before the long vowel maybe it just rhyme better to us so er yeah that's what we do there's be load of them on there i can't remember them all now oh can't wait to have that wee again
S0198	get to park on the just park on the yellow line at the end of the road dad place
