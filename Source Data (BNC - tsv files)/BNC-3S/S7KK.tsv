S0266	so when be you go to nepal
S0270	in november my last two weeks in november
S0271	be it book
S0270	no but that's the plan and we have get place on a
S0266	mm
S0270	erm organise
S0266	who's who's we
S0270	oh well it's but i don't know who else might want to come she want to leave it loose and be brave and organise it when we get there and erm i don't and erm look out the erm look on websites for flight you can't get a we haven't be able to find a flight for less than nine hundred pound so
S0266	be you gonna fly straight there
S0270	well that be the hope i mean this be
S0271	can't you
S0266	why
S0270	no this be
S0271	can't you just
S0270	mumbai via mumbai
S0271	can't you fly to well delhi and then get a
S0266	mm
S0270	mm
S0271	internal flight
S0270	yes well that's what
S0266	no go overland it's so nice it's so
S0270	yeah what
S0266	mm
S0270	train
S0266	no er on erm
S0270	bus
S0266	yeah bus it's very excite
S0270	mm i could do that i'm happy with that erm
S0266	but if you fly in and you fly out it's such a culture shock when you arrive and surely
S0270	well yes that's true
S0266	well er you're not go trek be you
S0270	we be go to be walk but we're go to be do
S0266	be you gonna climb mount everest
S0270	on a no absolutely not i've look at it
S0266	have you get sherpas
S0270	and it's extremely challenge and doesn't really want to do anything and i say well we won't see anything if you don't walk so erm i want to go on this organise trek which be easy to moderate and be you know whereas you look at some of the others and they might say eighteen miles or eighteen kilometres i should say erm and things like that so i think the one i'm look at be definitely gear at for people who be erm less fit
S0266	mm
S0270	which be good but look on erm look on the website initially at this holiday it look as if it be rather expensive but now that we can only find a flight for only find a flight for nine hundred pound and it doesn't mean seven hundred pound
S0271	i'm sure you can flight to delhi and mumbai for four or five hundred pound can't you
S0266	mm
S0270	well if we look just at those
S0266	mm
S0270	it would probably be cheaper than look at kathmandu
S0266	mm
S0270	i mean you have you be because you've be to india
S0271	no i've just be to delhi and rajasthan but we get internal flight when we be there
S0270	yeah
S0271	mm
S0270	and when do you go
S0266	mm oh i go as a youngster
S0270	oh be this when you be do your greyhound and before you get to greece or after
S0266	mm the middle of sort of travel yeah
S0270	cos i haven't do any of it you see and i'm very conscious of that that i may not
S0266	but i think
S0270	very soon
S0266	things have change since then cos i go overland and you could go through place like erm iraq
S0270	mm
S0271	mm cos you go to afghanistan
S0266	turkey go through
S0271	mm
S0266	i spend a lot of time in afghanistan yeah
S0271	mm
S0266	and then pakistan and there be fight then
S0271	mm
S0266	civil war but it wasn't like perhaps as dangerous as
S0271	how do you travel there
S0266	erm i go on a a bus actually all all the way from london to kathmandu
S0271	mm blimey
S0266	but come back on public transport
S0271	blimey
S0266	with chickens and camels and
S0271	who do you go with or be you on your own
S0266	mm that's a lead question
S0266	the reason i go be because i'd be in a relationship for a very long time with a boy when i be young and erm when we'd split up i felt that i wasn't very independent so i decide that er i should be a bite more independent
S0270	mm
S0266	so i go to london and buy a ticket a one way ticket to kathmandu
S0270	brilliant didn't realise that be the start of the big one
S0266	i didn't know anyone
S0271	what do your mother think of that
S0266	well you know parent in those days didn't seem to worry and there be no mobile phone
S0270	no
S0266	and you'd er i give poste restante address in a few place i think i might be go to
S0271	send me a postcard letter
S0266	yep so i'd send a letter once a fortnight and i'd pick up the odd letter from them once i fortnight
S0270	what about international phone call when i be in austria you could do
S0266	well in europe you could but you you couldn't
S0271	you have you have to
S0266	in those countries
S0271	book them really didn't you
S0266	oh i dunno i never even try
S0271	yeah
S0266	we be
S0270	for how long do you spend do it then it must have take up a very long time
S0266	go there i think take about er do you know i can't remember i've get it somewhere in a diary that i'm close to find
S0271	mm
S0266	turn out all my junk erm probably about three months go there
S0270	mm
S0271	so how do you finance it
S0266	i work erm and save money and it be very cheap
S0271	mm mm
S0266	i think the whole trip be only i dunno a hundred and twenty pound or something like that
S0271	and i think i do quite well come back from greece on my own
S0266	do you
S0271	mm
S0266	how do you come back on your own
S0271	well erm cos i be there for a year and i decide to go round the islands so i do that and i suppose that give me some confidence so i think well i'll be able to travel overland back to england so i get on a bus and go to corfu and then get the ferry round to dubrovnik
S0266	mm
S0271	and i meet these four australians in a camper van on the boat and
S0266	but in those what what year be this
S0271	i think it be nineteen
S0266	that be when
S0271	nineteen seventyish
S0266	mm so tito be still there in yugoslavia
S0271	probably
S0270	mm
S0271	and these australians i think they probably weren't get on very well two doctor and two nurse and they
S0266	why do you meet them
S0271	on the boat go to dubrovnik and they say would you like to
S0266	why do you go to dubrovnik and not italy
S0271	well cos i want to go through yugoslavia
S0266	oh right okay
S0271	i be actually head up to hamburg where my cousin live so i join them and we travel up through yugoslavia erm
S0270	in their bus
S0271	in their camper van they have a tent as well and then erm where do we get to i we go to southern go to salzburg we go in the mine there i remember that erm southern germany i suppose and then i get the train up to hamburg to stay with my cousin who be
S0266	so when do you say goodbye to these people
S0271	i say goodbye to them at er erm strasbourg but i keep in i move back to london after that and i keep in touch with them i remember go to some party and one of the guy this really short little chap he use to come round and sit on my lap
S0271	in my flat he be really small he be a doctor an aussie guy
S0270	sound very weird
S0266	why do he sit on your lap weren't there enough chair
S0271	he be just a funny sort of he just use cos he be i be quite tall and he be
S0271	and i i in recent years since
S0271	since my two have be in australia
S0271	i'd quite like to look him up again cos i stay fairly friendly with him and then i think he must have go back to australia or something he be a gynaecologist
S0270	ah it have all these connotations this and i wonder how
S0266	oh
S0270	do he just do it to tease you and come and sit on your lap or do he have
S0271	no well when we be sit
S0270	conversations
S0271	when we be sit in the live room with the flatmates and friends and there weren't enough chair he use to sit
S0266	do he fancy you then
S0271	no no he be too short for that i don't think he fancy me
S0266	mm
S0271	he be like five foot one or two quite small for a guy
S0270	obviously bright which be a compensation
S0266	mm
S0271	so they be both gynaecologists both erm both the blokes so
S0266	so this be that be before you meet
S0271	in nineteen seventy and then i suppose i go on holiday in seventy six i go on an overland trip to russia
S0266	do you in seventy six cos that be in the
S0270	that be quite brave
S0266	by yourself
S0271	well it be no it be on a you know bus with lot of australians and people so we go
S0266	mm as they do on their way home
S0271	and we we go through holland and scandinavia finland st petersburg moscow poland and then back to england and i think i meet soon after that our conversation start by say oh i've just be to poland talk about him be polish
S0270	mm
S0271	and i
S0270	so where do you actually go when you go to poland that time
S0271	we go stop in warsaw
S0270	mm i hear that's a really good place to go
S0271	but
S0270	if you're start
S0271	and russia be quite scary
S0270	yeah
S0271	really because you could i think they be book in to go to certain place at certain time and on the roads there'd be check er checkpoints with guard and that check that you be at a certain place at a certain time and we get to moscow and you have to have a in tourist guide take you to the place that you have book out and the food be not very good either it be summer and it be just cabbage no nice fruit to eat and tea that's about the all there be to drink and then travel into poland you could just see the difference that the field the crop be bigger it just look so much more prosperous than than russia
S0270	you be quite both quite intrepid weren't you i don't think i do anything like that
S0271	and i i go on another overland trip down to morocco
S0266	have some peanuts
S0270	thank
S0271	thank you that be just in a minivan i mean just
S0266	with
S0271	it be just one of these little overland company so erm go down through madrid and over to tangier and down to fes and back up again that be quite interest
S0266	but it be quite adventurous in those days to go off and
S0270	mm
S0271	well it felt adventurous
S0266	even if you go on those trip
S0271	to go and live in greece that i do
S0266	yeah
S0271	particularly from my background my parent have never be abroad
S0266	mm
S0270	do you learn some of the the
S0271	i learn how to swear at people in greece but i'm not good
S0270	anything else
S0271	at languages
S0266	but it be a very different
S0270	mm
S0266	greece in those days cos you couldn't get things like things like erm butter or nescafé or

S0270	they already do they already do sell coffee
S0266	what kind of coffee
S0270	mm i'm not sure

S0266	no tell me about the village shop the latest
S0271	do you know the woman in the post office there
S0266	they employ someone new didn't they
S0271	cos she's take on the lease of the shop and 's be give the sack
S0266	oh really oh gosh she's
S0271	and she's just very upset
S0270	i mean that must be awful cos she's
S0266	that must be quite quite serious
S0270	she's be really involve
S0271	i mean people don't like but i think she's very
S0270	very loyal
S0271	organise efficient loyal conscientious but these middle class women think she's not a salesperson
S0270	she isn't she doesn't
S0271	she isn't
S0270	present a good persona when you go in but
S0271	but will it make any difference i mean people either go in a shop or they don't
S0270	i would've think if she'd be employ surely she'll have some right
S0271	yeah she's gonna go for she tell she's go to go for redundancy and what she can get out of it
S0270	mm
S0266	so who actually employ her be it the village the co operative
S0271	i think the the yes the co op whatever that be
S0266	well it's the group of people who've get share in the village shop isn't it
S0271	mm i think they're
S0266	so who make that decision
S0271	there be a meet
S0270	there be a big meet mm
S0271	in august which and i miss cos
S0270	which er yeah
S0271	we weren't around
S0270	we be both away
S0266	oh really
S0270	didn't realise the significance of the importance of it
S0266	because the whole wasn't the whole the the big sort of issue before be the fact that they be gonna lose the post office part
S0271	well that seem to er
S0266	and then
S0271	work out that
S0266	and then a new lady
S0271	mm
S0266	come in
S0271	yes
S0266	and this be this lady that's where do she come from be she local
S0271	yes
S0270	she be cos er
S0271	or
S0270	she be local
S0271	somewhere up that way
S0270	she's local
S0266	so she's take on the whole
S0270	i think she be the right kind of person she'll be able to talk to the locals run the post office and be quite
S0266	mm
S0271	the question be
S0270	er she's very approachable
S0271	the question be will there still be volunteer i mean i i wouldn't want to volunteer if it's go in her pocket i would've i would've volunteer
S0266	so have the status change then it's not a charity anymore it's a
S0270	mm
S0266	business concern be it
S0271	mm it be a lease or something
S0270	i be gonna say how on earth will that work
S0271	i don't know i think they'd get a they own the build the trustees
S0266	yeah i think that everyone put in money to buy the build
S0271	yeah
S0270	er someone live in the flat which be part of the er
S0266	but that's rent be it
S0271	mm
S0270	mm
S0266	rent so the rent help to pay
S0271	yeah
S0270	mm it's not cost effective it be never go to work as a business and so this may may help
S0271	you've still get to get
S0266	so what's she do
S0271	people to go in the shop though
S0266	she's rent it
S0270	yeah
S0266	she's rent it off the
S0270	mm
S0271	she's buy the lease or something like that hasn't she
S0270	mm
S0266	oh
S0270	mm
S0266	so do that mean there's no more nightmare er situation where you've get people worry the whole time about it close and
S0271	the problem be the
S0270	there'll be deliveries sunday
S0271	s couldn't make a go of it and they be fairly friendly i mean how be she gonna make it any different
S0266	what do the s do then do they lease it as well
S0271	they own it didn't they
S0270	er i don't know i remember
S0266	oh before village buy it
S0271	mm and also there be that miserable guy erm you know the brother in law of the lady dentist

S0266	yeah but that be before the whole or the villagers
S0271	mm
S0270	mm
S0266	take it over
S0270	mm before it become a community shop

S0271	my sister in law help there
S0266	but why be it successful
S0270	it still have definitely definitely shorter shop hours and things
S0271	they do they do sandwich and foodie things there
S0270	do they
S0271	mm
S0270	i think it's all about footfall isn't it if you don't get the footfall how can you possibly
S0271	yeah it's the footfall
S0270	mm
S0271	doesn't matter who's serve
S0270	mm yeah and i do think it's very hard
S0271	yeah
S0270	to get the market right people er go to drop in they're go to want a post office they do want a a lottery ticket and they do want staple things
S0271	yeah but they don't do lottery ticket any longer
S0270	okay
S0271	they weren't high enough turnover er tut
S0270	okay
S0271	they take it away from them
S0270	okay
S0266	really
S0271	you see the there's
S0266	it it's the fact that it's not on the main road and it hasn't get park
S0271	it's cos it's not on the main road
S0266	or it hasn't get park
S0271	no park you go there and you can't park
S0266	mm see i i never think of go there and i should really i should support it
S0270	well that's because your local one be be much closer surely
S0266	yeah but it's not it's hardly a village shop it's a the one i go to's a spar
S0270	no no no but i mean your local shop
S0271	but these middle class
S0266	well my local shop be what
S0270	be the spar
S0266	yeah
S0270	er why would you be go to it's not nearly so near
S0266	to to to support it because it's a erm
S0271	well i usually go there and buy egg
S0266	you know it's a community
S0270	mm
S0271	we get our paper from there and if i've forget anything now and again i buy a card
S0270	well i go there
S0271	and but
S0270	for those kind of things
S0271	i've find
S0266	but i mean they do things like hobbs bread don't they there
S0271	yes i don't like hobbs bread very much
S0266	don't you i find it's
S0271	and it's quite expensive and
S0266	i think it be suppose to be so good
S0271	we don't eat much bread i suppose
S0270	they've try to offer
S0266	and take me in there once and sit me down on the floor even which be very embarrass cos they do a good exchange of book
S0271	yeah
S0270	oh yeah yeah that's really nice that's a very local village shop thing
S0266	but i mean there's no money in that i think i
S0270	mm
S0266	i think what be what be they a pound or something
S0270	no no no fifty p
S0266	fifty p
S0270	mm well there be a little bite of trickle of money i guess but it's always gonna be difficult for things keep thing like vegetables isn't it because they go
S0271	well they just go off
S0270	they go off mm so i think it's a very difficult task
S0271	it be
S0266	be there a lot of people in erm though that haven't get cars and can't get out
S0271	i think there's a few old people in the erm
S0270	mm
S0271	old people's place
S0270	it's a it's suppose to be a basic essential isn't it
S0271	it be useful if you're
S0270	suppose to be essential
S0271	cook something like i be and i've not get the right ingredients
S0266	mm
S0270	it be very good for a for a
S0271	but it's just too expensive they can't sell things as cheap as lidl or tesco so
S0270	er no but if you be go to go there gonna supplement your weekly shop there aren't you
S0266	mm
S0271	yeah but it's still cheaper than get spend on petrol in your car and
S0266	i'd have think there would there would have be quite a few elderly people there and young mums who'd use it but it would never work in this village because
S0270	but people do go to the farm shop you know in you see cos you can get
S0271	mm
S0266	but that's terribly expensive
S0270	i know but i'm surprise who i've see in there i've only be in a few time but it's be quite a cross
S0271	spend a lot of money in
S0270	a section of the
S0266	she doesn't do she it's i mean it's shockingly expensive in there
S0270	but there's there's young mums with with erm baby who i've see in there
S0266	really
S0270	mm
S0271	how how can they have get the money
S0266	i don't know how they can afford to
S0271	how can they how have they get the money
S0270	husband with a good job i suppose but i think it's terribly easy to park there you can have a coffee
S0271	yes yeah
S0270	you can have a cup of this you can have a cup of
S0266	i have a disgust coffee there about six weeks ago
S0270	do you
S0266	yeah
S0270	and you pay a lot for your vegetables there but you can get some quite nice
S0266	it's not only that you see a quiche or something and you think
S0270	it's artisan
S0266	oh i'll really
S0270	mm
S0266	treat
S0271	mm
S0270	and you can yeah so
S0266	you know myself
S0270	you can buy quite a lot of nice artisan food that's readymade that
S0266	yeah but it's so expensive
S0270	i know that's why i don't go there but that be why people go there you can it's terribly convenient and you can pop in you can definitely park
S0266	mm yeah that's true
S0270	and you can pick up all the things you need and yes it will cost you quite a lot more but i think maybe if you be you know
S0266	well if you're feed only one person you can buy something that'll last you
S0270	mm
S0266	you know three nights
S0270	i think that's how manage
S0266	mm
S0270	to do it really
S0266	that's how i'd work it out
S0270	sorry
S0266	but if you be try to fee
S0270	mm
S0266	other people as well there use to be the most amaze woman you know the one erm farm shop what be it call actually on the
S0271	oh yes the one who cook the cake and

S0271	mm
S0266	in advance if you you know

S0271	they don't sell that sort of cheese though do they tesco it's quite bore
S0266	waitrose do in and things like stink bishop but it's much more expensive
S0270	no i disagree i disagree you can get very nice cheese
S0271	but there's stuff that she have in jar like the pickle and things

S0271	mm
S0266	local artists have paint
S0270	mm
S0271	mm
S0266	and they'd print the card and
S0271	but they be there as the
S0266	i i use to spend a fortune when i go in there
S0271	mm they also have the trellis work and stuff outside didn't they
S0266	mm and you could get potatoes and
S0270	mm what happen to that wonderful place off the be it we use we go to a very eclectic place that sell
S0266	do we go
S0270	yeah didn't we go that one time off the we get off a back road and there be erm
S0266	whereabouts because erm
S0270	it be erm
S0266	be miles away
S0270	oh right that's not the right road then and we be off the and we be cut down probably the road to from the
S0266	right oh
S0270	and erm
S0266	what after or something
S0270	and erm they be it be a very eclectic place call sell erm vintage this and vintage that and also you could have cup of tea and things
S0266	food or
S0270	er yeah
S0266	junk
S0270	no no no
S0266	you're not talk about the junk shop
S0270	yeah it be a junk shop but it be also it be erm
S0266	not the one go to
S0270	no no not
S0266	not yeah
S0271	can't be buy stuff still be she
S0270	they've get a wed come up so i think they're buy things for the garden cos the wedding's go to be in the garden
S0266	i don't know what place you're talk about
S0271	the wedding's not go to
S0270	mm
S0271	oh you mean 's wed not 's
S0270	mm
S0271	mm
S0270	so yes she be buy things statues and things for the garden
S0266	i can't think what place you're
S0270	mm
S0266	think about
S0271	you know and have be tell not to listen to anyone over forty give advice about baby
S0270	cos it's all out of date
S0271	it's out of date how do we manage to bring our children up don't you think that's that's rather cruel cos they can't even listen to their own mother can they
S0266	who tell them that
S0271	health visitors and people
S0266	mm
S0271	so say to he say to them i'll give you some advice my mother always use to erm boil up milk with poppy seed in it to give to us to make us sleep and the shock horror on their face
S0266	who's face
S0271	and
S0271	not don't listen to anyone over forty and there's him say this to them
S0266	so who tell you that they do
S0271	erm tell me and i
S0266	but that's almost as bad as you know tell people what when they're pregnant or they've have baby to give them advice the whole time it's almost as bad just to say that you know to say that you can't get advice from anyone over forty
S0270	mm
S0271	so she be tell me this with stand beside her 's wife and so a young person say well if you offer advice it's like you're criticise the the person and the baby if you say you should do it that way it mean that what they're do be totally wrong that's the way a young person look at it i would look at it oh that's not go right i could suggest that and maybe it'll help them
S0266	or just talk about when you do it
S0271	when i
S0266	you do it
S0271	do it
S0270	mm
S0271	it really help or
S0270	i find it usually help me to talk to other mums
S0266	but people do interfere
S0271	yeah
S0266	do people do interfere horribly don't they
S0271	i didn't
S0266	and they're always you know
S0271	i didn't have anyone to interfere with me
S0266	mm
S0271	do your mother interfere
S0266	no but when i be in greece with baby i mean god
S0271	mm
S0266	it the you know
S0271	mm
S0266	be tell all the time what to do
S0270	's friend er 's erm son and partner just have twin and erm she's desperate cos she doesn't think they're do anything you know it's really really difficult they be both bear early they're both quite small and i can't believe that they've be send home without any other help
S0271	where be this be this in england
S0270	yeah
S0271	mm it's not the one in
S0270	in
S0271	mm
S0270	so erm i can't believe that and she feel well you know because it's daughter in law not
S0271	mm
S0270	son in law that
S0271	be the girls
S0270	it's very very very difficult for her to deal with and she can see that a lot of the struggle could be you know
S0271	yeah
S0270	help along
S0271	yes
S0270	and erm i'm say well get in the professionals because then at least they might take their advice but they actually aren't get you know extra visit or anything and these baby be some ridiculously small weight
S0271	but don't they have to go to clinics to be weigh or
S0270	i expect so
S0271	don't people come round
S0270	i expect so but no
S0271	they must still do that
S0270	but i don't think it's you know they could do with much more serious help than they're get i think i'm certainly quite grateful i didn't start with twin be quite difficult wouldn't it two what an onslaught
S0271	well it's it's difficult enough have them fairly close together
S0270	mm mm
S0271	but yours be closer together than mine
S0270	mm the girls be yeah but
S0271	mm
S0270	er have two exactly the same that's not go to be at all easy be it
S0271	mm
S0270	so er mm in the old days i guess
S0266	it's terrible we talk about the old days it's only our youth it sound like we're talk about victorian time
S0270	mm that's true
S0266	what do you mean when you say the old days
S0270	mm
S0266	you mean our youth or do you mean
S0270	mm
S0266	way back
S0271	i know ideas
S0266	i can't remember what you be say
S0270	no i be conscious
S0270	of this record
S0271	ideas change a little bite
S0271	don't they cos when when we be young the thing be to put your baby out in the pram outside in the garden wasn't it
S0266	mm i mean i mean
S0271	fresh air
S0266	yeah and er er a net over it
S0271	yeah
S0266	so the cat didn't go and sleep on its face
S0271	yeah but it's you wrap them up warmly and they be out in the fresh air and it make them sleep
S0266	yeah you'd under the tree and
S0271	or you couldn't you couldn't hear them cry so they go to sleep
S0270	and we have to not lie the baby on its back but lie it on its side and now it's lie it on its back and yes you can sleep in the same bed if you're a not to roll over and do something i mean i it's all it be different i think i'm sure there be things the same the thing be if you love and care for it that's all you can do
S0271	i think the other thing be they're mean to be in the same bedroom as you for six months in a cot
S0270	mm
S0266	they be mean to be or not
S0271	i think that's the latest idea
S0266	oh
S0270	i think there be quite strong differences to over the decades
S0271	but they'll probably change their mind again
S0270	what's this notepad for
S0266	nothing i be just gonna make some note
S0266	do anyone need a another drink or something different to eat
S0270	no
S0266	or something different to drink
S0271	no i'm fine
S0270	it's because i can't have those biscuits that i've eat some of course
S0266	oh you've eat some
S0270	yeah what's the attraction
S0270	the attraction of carbohydrate be very strange isn't it
S0271	if your body
S0270	cos that's what it be
S0271	think you should eat it you should eat it like
S0270	mm
S0271	like me and cake today
S0270	it be nice cake
S0266	what cake
S0271	er well
S0270	i shouldn't have cake
S0271	at work it be someone's birthday some carrot cake homemade carrot cake with nice orange butter ice
S0266	but you're not gluten free or anything be you
S0271	no i'm not gonna get into that sort of rubbish
S0270	it's not rubbish and you'll see be that
S0266	so why be you feel guilty about the
S0271	well weight
S0266	oh weight well you don't look er
S0271	mm mm
S0270	i'm just conscious of sit down at work aren't you
S0271	i'm conscious of not move around enough
S0266	mm so mm
S0270	you must do some sit with your
S0266	mm yeah
S0266	yeah
S0271	it's not good really
S0266	i've be about three days i've be i dunno eighteen hours on the trot
S0270	oh my gosh
S0266	anyway what do you do at what do you do at erm work today do you have to renegotiate your position
S0270	er no i think i be go to but i have all my i have what i could print off available er display you've do in the recent past annoyingly couldn't find some serious ones which i must have somewhere but couldn't locate them
S0271	so as
S0266	well what
S0271	you've go along you've take photos have you
S0270	oh yes i don't
S0271	that's good
S0270	if i take anything down i know
S0271	mm
S0270	otherwise you can't prove you've do it
S0271	mm
S0270	some people have take some things down without my take a photograph
S0271	mm
S0270	which upset me greatly because i have massive ownership of them when i've do them
S0271	mm
S0270	erm no i don't have to present it at all
S0266	so do you have a meet
S0270	i try to but he just come out of his office and we walk around and discuss stuff and and that's it when do i go in oh usually tuesdays and wednesday i say but it's you know negotiable i can do more or less or whatever and then the next thing i know it's all come up at a staff meet and everybody's come and approach me so it be great
S0271	so he
S0266	what approach you to congratulate you
S0271	he's
S0270	as oh er no as to what
S0271	he's mention it at a staff meet to see to organise the
S0270	yeah yeah
S0271	yeah
S0270	so erm we've be talk erm you know which be what i always do before without all this other stuff erm we be talk you know talk to the teachers themselves about what board would would we would locate things at but erm even though we've cut out a lot of board you know a lot have a lot there's be a lot of change there's still mass to do you couldn't possibly do it without someone else you know each classroom have between four and six board of their own and then there's the communal board which i'm responsible for so even though we've take them down and paint over and do all sort it's still about forty
S0271	forty
S0270	so forty board mm
S0271	phew
S0270	about and that's without the new classrooms so i dunno what's gonna happen when we've get the new classrooms
S0271	so how often do they want them change
S0270	erm well some of them mm and a great deal you know the major ones that you can see in the main lobby erm and at least erm hold more than half termly but the others probably half termly and some things stay up a long time because they're an ongoing
S0271	mm
S0270	change you know face so i would love to do lot more erm and it's these game isn't it i think i've definitely get to put something up so when i go in on tuesday
S0266	but do you
S0270	i shall just suggest that i have to do that
S0266	do you just put up what you want or be it
S0270	no no no no
S0266	who who
S0270	it's topic work er topic work and
S0266	for the whole school or for
S0270	er yeah yeah nursery through to i do foundation stage key stage one and key stage two
S0266	no but just the topic
S0270	oh no the topics be they run for er different phase so they'll be erm
S0271	there's a new curriculum though isn't there so will there be different new things to put up and
S0270	er well we have a new systems of phonics yeah it's now call sound write
S0271	but the sort of things
S0270	not read write inc so we're now do sound write which i don't know much about i do listen in when i be outside in the corridor do the board i want to get something about that
S0271	but history
S0270	we've get
S0271	history's change hasn't it different things that
S0270	erm
S0271	cos one of our teachers be go to stonehenge for her topic
S0266	mm
S0271	so i don't know what
S0270	oh lovely
S0271	that be
S0270	mm
S0271	mm
S0270	great fun erm not sure i know three four be do tudors which we have do in the past
S0271	mm
S0270	erm and we're do dinosaurs in year one at the moment which will be a fun one to do and we always have you know erm so improve write and improve improve maths target and things like that and erm yeah be excite i'm erm look forward to it now we've get them start i be absolutely pooped though i can't believe how it's not
S0271	cos you can't sit down and that do it must keep her fit
S0270	oh i do
S0271	more than me sit in a chair all day
S0270	i do a lot of stretch i have repetitive strain in this muscle terrible repetitive strain it's ridiculous i can't tell you i can't sleep through it sometimes it's quite ridiculous i've get to get it look at er but yes i be please that i haven't have to fight my corner there be no question of it but obviously
S0266	so be that the academic year then you'll be there
S0270	i think it's open because i haven't send a contract
S0271	so what do you do
S0270	cos i don't really
S0271	just claim a monthly claim
S0270	the hours i work
S0271	mm
S0270	yeah just i just claim the hours i work but we're miss a lot of these strategic management team that be involve when i be originally employ you see so they're all they fall fall by the wayside if not officially leave they're off on erm sick leave
S0266	and probably won't return
S0270	i think so
S0266	so what's morale like amongst the teachers that be there
S0270	erm well the new ones have lift er the general atmosphere because they've come in with a completely new attitude
S0266	mm
S0270	because obviously they be it's now
S0266	now an academy
S0270	now yeah now an academy so they haven't have preconceive ideas there be we have someone who's be there for nearly twenty years who's still massively enthusiastic although she be forty
S0266	mm
S0270	so we've get all sort but we've get some really good new young teachers and of course those who have be there a while have lot and lot of change and i think they be the ones who be not particularly cop well but the ones the one who haven't cop at all well of course aren't actually there so no and i think we've get the new good head i think he's good at the moment he's really listen so that's important isn't it i think he's get a massive task i so couldn't be him and we've get a lot of new face i'm try to introduce myself to them there's a lot of kind of very senior
S0271	have to very big label
S0270	oh no they just don't bother to talk to me
S0266	i i'm the one who doesn't oh
S0270	so very senior people
S0266	yeah
S0270	so i've be shake hand today i think no i'm actually go to do this i think it's really weird and i i do miss the status of be a teacher i do not have any status it's very weird and one of the sweet like somali ladies be say to me you know cos she's know me as a teacher i use to teach her son
S0266	mm
S0270	and er he's now move on to his secondary school and she be say you know erm and what be you do i say oh just the display at least it's a job
S0266	oh
S0270	so sweet so sweet i think i'm not go to go into this but i have actually retire and this be you know an option but they're so sweet but yeah it's interest to see all these er ladies they've get a very dinner system at the moment where but we have employ so many people to help the dinner time along you know apart from all our dinner

S0266	and be it like airline meals
S0271	no it come they serve them out onto plat and erm
S0270	oh i see they they come but in large
S0271	they come in
S0270	yeah
S0271	a big er a heat proof box
S0270	mm mm
S0271	and we've get a heat servery so they put the food in there and serve it out
S0270	mm
S0271	they've get those plastic plat have you get those with compartments in them
S0270	mm
S0271	so they put puddings on with the
S0270	ours be cook ours be cook onsite yeah but we do have compartmentalise things yeah
S0271	yeah
S0270	but ours be cook onsite
S0271	but
S0270	i didn't realise it wasn't go to involve the juniors
S0271	no but erm we haven't get a huge take up you know
S0270	mm
S0271	just over half because lot of young children be quite fussy the teacher be tell me today oh that one doesn't like sausages well if you don't even like sausages
S0270	mm so they've come with their own
S0271	they bring a lunchbox
S0270	erm yeah okay
S0271	they don't have to have it
S0270	so they're have sandwich yeah
S0271	so they can bring sandwich and the other thing be if erm they've get an older sibling in the juniors it would mean if the young one have a cook meal the older one would probably say i want a cook meal and if you can't afford it you just give them both a lunchbox
S0270	mm mm
S0271	and the biggest take up do i tell you that it's where
S0270	mm
S0271	where there be more wealthy parent so they're all
S0270	mm
S0271	have the lunch and
S0270	mm
S0271	the poor fussy children be not have them
S0270	mm
S0266	but why aren't they have them cos they don't like the food
S0271	oh
S0270	may er they can
S0271	and they're fussy
S0270	but they could have those options they have the option of no
S0271	there be no option
S0270	no come on er it
S0271	but the thing be at home they probably eat quite a limit range of food so when it's something like i dunno lasagne or something they won't have it cos they've never have it at home
S0266	so what do they eat
S0271	they bring a lunchbox in
S0266	and what
S0270	yeah they're gonna have
S0266	and what's in the lunchbox
S0270	they're gonna have sandwich from home
S0271	sandwich and
S0270	cos we've
S0271	rubbish food crisp and things
S0270	we've talk an awful lot at school about have healthy healthy lunchboxes
S0271	mm
S0270	mass and mass i'd like to do that again and start with the start write you know
S0271	i think i think the money
S0270	start for
S0271	all these billions that be be spend should have be spend on educate mother on do lunchboxes and help them cook decent food at home rather than
S0270	mm
S0271	i don't know how you do it but rather
S0266	i remember be sham er by you when you use to cook your er cereal bar for your children
S0271	do i
S0266	to put in their lunchbox yeah
S0270	flapjacks
S0266	cos i remember i
S0270	be it oh okay
S0266	cos i remember i no no healthy ones
S0270	mm
S0266	not even flapjacks cos i use to sometimes buy those
S0271	i don't remember do healthy stuff
S0266	you know the whatever it be you put in lunchboxes you buy what they want and i always note that you when you be cook
S0271	well be really
S0266	very healthy
S0271	if they i be not a health freak with food i have
S0266	no but you be sensible
S0271	chocolate cake i use to make it every day cos that's all he like
S0266	chocolate cake
S0271	yeah and he like erm garlic sausage so he have garlic sausage sandwich and chocolate cake every day
S0266	always the same
S0271	virtually no he didn't eat a green vegetable till he be about fifteen
S0266	gosh and how how tall be he now
S0271	six six
S0266	ridiculous be you into
S0270	mm
S0266	i use to make my own children make their sandwich from a very young age for a whole week on a sunday and put them in the freezer
S0270	gosh terribly organise
S0266	and then and then they have to get them out
S0270	yeah
S0266	in the er i don't know in the morning cos i think i'm not gonna do this for sixteen years or something whatever it be
S0270	yeah but also you be work
S0266	yeah i erm i i it be quite hard on them
S0271	mm
S0270	mm
S0266	but
S0271	i wish i'd be firmer get them to do job but they never i always give in and do things
S0270	you're quite firm with about do job
S0271	he's quite happy to do it cos i'm go to work and he's at home you know he do all the clean and all the cook
S0266	do he
S0271	mm
S0270	well not when he's actually do a job which be a paint or whatever
S0271	he well he be he be well he be paint
S0270	that's a bite rough isn't it
S0271	four days a week and do clean the house on the fifth day
S0270	but he would still be do the cook in the even
S0271	he's be do the cook for quite a few years now cos he like cook and he like listen to the archers so at seven o'clock he cook a meal and listen to the archers so it work quite well i clear up and do the shop
S0270	mm oh so it's a good
S0271	and i do the laundry he be hang stuff
S0270	mm
S0271	on the line now and get it in fold it neatly
S0270	do he discover that himself or do you ask him to do it
S0271	no he offer cos he feel sort of guilty i think it's alright
S0266	so what kind of menus do you have what sort of meals do you have
S0271	well i quite often have roast on sunday and then have some heat up we have a curry on saturday which he make
S0270	hiya
S0271	heat that up when i
S0270	be you gonna come and join in
S0266	you must be hungry
S0266	oh no okay
S0270	hello come on then come in and cook
S0270	okay
S0271	we have polish sausages we have casseroles he make erm or get
S0266	always advertise
S0271	chop and things we always have meat virtually every day cos his polish meat
S0270	cos like his meat
S0270	i do
S0271	always
S0270	a lot of cook for two days on my own
S0271	well that's two days that's quite often it's it's good that
S0270	mm i find when you have people round for supper as i do on saturday you cook far too much and then you can eat the rest of it
S0271	mm
S0270	for a long time afterwards
S0271	mm some days
S0270	i'm very into garlic garlic mushroom and then these you know cos i can't have pasta now only this pretend stuff which be quite ghastly it's really really solid it's quite horrible erm i've start erm use the courgettes as pretend linguini which be it linguini whichever that pasta be so you shave them and erm you just cook it all in the pan it's absolutely awesome and if you want meat you can add bits of bacon which be very nice it's actually very quick and very easy so it's garlic mushroom and then a courgette
S0271	mushroom can be tricky
S0270	mm
S0271	eat i don't know if i can actually eat them really
S0270	mm
S0271	i think i get ache bone when i eat mushroom
S0270	mm i'm alright with those it sound like it's the yeast in it
S0271	yeah i think so i cos we we usually have mushroom for breakfast on saturday and sundays
S0270	mm
S0271	i find that
S0270	you're very particular with your meals aren't you do you organise them when you go shop once a week sort of thing
S0271	yeah
S0270	mm i'm much more
S0271	we always have a fry breakfast on saturday and sundays
S0270	mm i'm much more about what be the yellow label or what's the deal at the time
S0271	well i do buy deal and put them in the freezer
S0270	and then you can plan them in for your next time
S0271	mm
S0270	terribly organise i'm not actually that organise really but i don't have to be anymore i be when my family be about but i don't have to be
S0271	so what sort of things do you eat then how long's this get to be on for
S0266	i don't know as long as we want to talk you're ready for another glass of wine i can see
S0270	no i'm not i've have enough

S0266	cos she's suppose to be very good isn't she
S0270	she's great i know erm doesn't believe in it but i feel much better
S0271	i don't believe in it at all
S0270	you don't have to
S0271	and
S0266	i do cos i see how well be from
S0270	mm
S0266	keep off
S0271	well i think 's better because she's not work
S0266	no i well i don't know about that
S0270	she have mass of other serious er medical issue so mm yeah
S0271	well what sort of
S0266	well she's just too busy in life
S0270	mm oh yeah
S0266	she she should slow down
S0270	yeah but she take she take joy in it though doesn't she
S0266	erm
S0270	she take pleasure out of
S0266	yeah i just think sometimes she get
S0270	pleasure out of a lot of things grandchildren and stuff
S0266	yeah but she get onto all these committees and she
S0270	mm but then
S0271	it's too much
S0270	but she choose to do that
S0266	chapel and church
S0270	she choose to do that
S0266	yeah but i don't think she should
S0270	oh i see i see what you mean
S0266	you know go along and enjoy it but not erm organise it which be
S0271	mm you need some people who just like organise don't they
S0266	i never see her cos she's always erm
S0270	well we could never see you you be always busy
S0266	ah but that's because i'm work
S0270	mm
S0266	but she kind of retire through ill health
S0271	health and
S0270	and then
S0266	and should really be slow down and
S0270	mm
S0271	but she's be better since she retire though hasn't she
S0266	and enjoy her life
S0270	thank you
S0271	with her ache muscle and things
S0270	thank you well that's also because she's change her diet which you don't believe in but it have make a difference to her
S0271	not at all
S0270	it have make a difference
S0266	no i think you must agree that perhaps you never eat unhealthy
S0271	well i do i
S0266	food
S0271	i eat meat all the time don't i
S0266	well that's not necessarily unhealthy but if you be to eat lot of cream cake and biscuits for a whole day
S0271	i'd get fat
S0266	well it's not only that you'd feel
S0270	you would feel differently
S0266	differently and it's just that you don't do it so that when you have someone who have a pretty bad or probably a very healthy diet but supplement it with
S0271	and use to eat load of chocolate i don't know if she still do
S0270	yeah but then if you haven't experience that you probably don't realise how bad how ill you can sometimes feel if you're not
S0271	but what i don't understand be
S0266	eat healthy food
S0271	what sort of test if the medical profession
S0270	thank you
S0271	can't test for it how can these quack test for it
S0270	well you've straight away judge them by call them a quack haven't you so
S0271	yeah but how do they test it
S0270	you've already decide
S0271	i mean
S0270	they be as medically and
S0271	a proper
S0270	they be as medically qualify in a different way
S0271	but if if real doctor can't test for it how can people like that test for it
S0270	yeah but if your doctor be
S0271	that's what i don't understand
S0266	but doctor probably can
S0270	there be just different kind of doctor
S0266	but they just can't be you know they haven't get the the resources to do it
S0271	you get allergy doctor and people cos i've be to them
S0270	mm
S0266	mm but this isn't allergies be it
S0270	cos it's more serious than that
S0266	if you go to an allergy doctor it's to see if you're
S0270	if you if you be to eat a food that rush straight through your body and make it impossible for you to leave home you would stop eat it wouldn't you
S0271	er probably but i might think i've get crohn's disease or something like that
S0270	i think she's be test for those things and she's prove okay so then she's go off to find out what it be that's cause all these things and it's extremely erm difficult to function isn't it that's what cause to go this and it's exactly the same with it just rush straight through her body you can't go to work you can't leave home so you stop eat those foods so there be definitely a reason for you to do it this definitely affect your body
S0271	and that's gluten in wheat
S0270	yes it's wheat
S0271	mm
S0270	and
S0271	but everybody can't be allergic to gluten which be what it sound like in
S0266	no but it's a new phenomenon it's now isn't it it's all it's er
S0271	but every it wouldn't be possible for everybody to be allergic to gluten
S0266	but we didn't have erm gluten do we in wheat
S0270	erm
S0266	i think i think it be because it's import from canada
S0270	it's because yes because america have be erm
S0266	america
S0270	and they've be supplement all these you know like when you buy a erm an oatcake if you look on it you'll see that actually it contain wheat now and that's because it's much cheaper to produce
S0271	but this gluten
S0266	but isn't it tamper with erm if you go to sort of countries that be grow their own wheat
S0270	mm i suspect if you be yeah do
S0266	and if you eat bread there you're absolutely fine
S0270	organically or yeah yeah
S0271	but people have trouble with bread here because they don't let it rise properly do they and it's not properly the yeast be not
S0270	it have preservatives in it all sort of things
S0271	and it's get all sort of things in it
S0270	mm that's what
S0271	that's not the flour it's the
S0270	that's what 's say
S0271	it's the way it's make rather than what it actually be
S0270	if you aren't have trouble with any foods then it's fine but if you if you're
S0271	well i probably be
S0270	but if you're
S0266	well you're not
S0270	but if you
S0266	because you're not rush to the loo all the time
S0271	i do sometimes if i've get
S0270	but that isn't the that isn't the only consequence that isn't the only consequence that isn't the consequence for me i think i have a very serious disease actually i don't think it i don't find it at all funny that i think that i actually felt really very ill so i go to see her and i take those things out of my diet and i felt a great deal better
S0271	so what do she test you with to prove it
S0270	erm well
S0266	well why do they they don't need to test you do i mean i i
S0270	ask you all sort of question for a start
S0266	surely you can just start eat
S0271	i mean they'd just tell everybody they're allergic this be just take the they tell everyone they're allergic to gluten they they virtually take everything out of their diet and that's really bad cos you should be eat a balance diet of a bite of everything not take great chunk out of your diet
S0266	yeah that's if you're if you that's if you're invert commas normal but if you have a have a i mean some people it's like dairy if
S0271	well
S0266	they drink cow's milk
S0271	medical
S0266	they
S0271	doctor
S0266	feel ill
S0271	will say lot of people be lactose intolerant that
S0266	mm
S0271	can be test can't it though i understand that cos people like japanese people can't eat dairy can they
S0266	no
S0271	cos they can't digest it genetically
S0270	you know your
S0271	can't digest it
S0270	you know your daughter in law be very erm what what be it that they eat in korea
S0271	kimchi
S0270	yeah so she doesn't like to do without it and that's what's i think happen in a
S0271	that's probiotic
S0270	that's what's er i think
S0271	get rid of the bacteria
S0270	what's happen in western diet be that there's an awful lot of wheat in it an awful lot of milk
S0266	and dairy
S0270	erm i buy i be buy up entirely on erm mass and mass of all that sort of stuff we have load of and load of milk and i do notice if i drink cow's milk now very seriously only eat cow's cheese
S0271	well you might be lactose intolerant which could be test properly that would prove it to you
S0270	well fine i don't mind if i be test properly
S0266	mm
S0270	i'm quite happy with the present test but yes
S0266	but also the milk that you be drink as a child would have come straight from the farm
S0270	mm okay
S0266	but you know you you look at the milk you're buy nowadays
S0270	mm
S0266	goodness know what
S0270	it still be i think it be
S0266	happen to it
S0270	only tuberculosis test i don't think it be anything else and then it would just go through the cooler and be
S0266	yeah and you'd drink it
S0270	yeah pasteurise it wasn't i guess be it none of those things
S0271	there be something on television a couple of nights ago and they test pasteurise milk and unpasteurised and the bacteria on the slide with the unpasteurised it be just cover in bacteria but i think maybe we all get use to eat that sort of
S0270	mm
S0271	bacteria
S0266	mm
S0271	when we be younger and now
S0270	you do need certain
S0271	if we try to eat it
S0270	you do need certain
S0271	probably couldn't now
S0270	mm
S0266	well it's like all these allergies people who have get asthma and erm all these things
S0271	but maybe people always have it but there be
S0266	but young kid that no i think cos when we be just
S0271	outside
S0266	you know we we be outside we play on the floor in filth we eat
S0271	mm
S0266	filth eat worm even
S0271	yeah
S0266	i be a child and now they're so overprotect
S0271	and why
S0266	and you know everything's hoover and clean and
S0271	why be people
S0266	all this
S0271	allergic to peanuts when people in place like malaysia where they eat peanuts in everything they're not allergic to them
S0270	mm
S0271	why be british baby and children can't eat peanuts
S0270	well there be children in my school that be allergic to peanuts who be not british
S0271	i know so how come some be and some aren't
S0270	but that have a very serious consequence it's not just a question of
S0271	well it can kill you
S0270	exactly so if you have that kind of shock then it's good that you have cut it out
S0271	but we didn't hear about that when we be children do we
S0266	no
S0270	well maybe we didn't know the cause of that shock do we if someone have die in that way like have a bee sting that you're allergic to we didn't know the cause of it i guess we would know that but maybe not with peanuts i mean if you go back would they have even be a
S0266	and how many peanuts do do we have in our childhood
S0270	wouldn't have be in our diet
S0271	we probably didn't have peanuts but then we
S0270	and so they wouldn't have be in our diet
S0271	we didn't have peanuts butter but lot of people do have peanut butter didn't they
S0266	i remember have peanut butter
S0271	mm
S0270	what as a child
S0266	well teens i think it come in
S0270	i don't remember it all you see my
S0271	i don't remember peanuts or
S0270	my mm
S0266	or perhaps a student peanut butter on toast
S0271	but we use to eat far
S0270	that's good
S0271	we use to eat a lot of carbohydrates because we use to have cook puddings at school
S0266	mm
S0271	and at home
S0266	but we use to do a lot of sport
S0271	erm cake
S0266	and exercise
S0271	and
S0266	and walk
S0271	biscuits
S0270	that's right we be busy weren't we
S0266	mm
S0270	mm
S0271	we didn't eat as many things as things like crisp
S0266	well there weren't crisp really be there
S0271	there be with the little blue bag in it
S0266	oh and the salt packet yeah but they be a special treat
S0271	they be a special treat
S0270	that's right
S0266	they weren't every day
S0270	i think that's the difference
S0271	and i think pizzas be really
S0270	be that we didn't have so many treat
S0271	bad for people the they're fatten
S0266	what
S0271	pizza
S0266	mm
S0271	i think that's why kid be fat
S0270	do you not make them anymore you use to make your own
S0271	mm i use to make them for children but i mean there's nothing in them that's particularly good the stuff you buy it the shop it's not even real cheese on them
S0270	mm if you make your own it would be better but it's still
S0271	well i use to make my own
S0270	still lot of erm carbs isn't it rather than too much anything else they be lovely though if they're homemade
S0271	we use to eat we use to eat toast and drip
S0270	mm
S0271	in fact you still get that in poland they give it to you as erm a free kind of starter bread with a drip pot with erm bits of meat erm
S0271	at the bottom it's really nice
S0270	mm my dad use to save all the meat for drip
S0271	but it's a cold country in the winter
S0266	mm
S0271	so people need to eat fat
S0266	mm
S0270	i remember mum say that people use to come to the door for fat
S0271	mm
S0270	from erm erm the prisoners of war use to come and try and exchange things they'd make for fat and of course farmers still have a bite of fat you be allow every so often to kill a pig and things like that must have be quite ghastly though mustn't it we be very lucky probably
S0266	but probably very healthy
S0270	mm
S0271	well 's mother come to britain because of a bucket of fat

S0266	problem of be foreigners or whatever
S0271	and my family's connection with them be that erm have i tell you about my mother and a pole
S0266	no
S0271	in the war in my grandfather work as a civilian mechanic at the local airbase and lot of polish pilot be base there so he use to invite them back to tea at weekend and she meet this pole that and there's this big question mark she be marry then do she have an affair

S0266	this be your mother then
S0271	this be my mother so

S0271	never manage that
