S0454	it be really icy one morning
S0455	it's different weather where be
S0454	really really cold we have a cold snap
S0452	but it two or three years ago
S0454	it really go down yeah really cold
S0452	have you get an ice scraper now
S0454	i go today to the supermarket and get one
S0452	in tesco's or
S0454	yes
S0452	yeah

S0452	i mean for things like that you know they're good
S0454	yeah they're good yes choice of three type
S0452	pardon
S0454	i have a choice of three sort of ice scraper
S0455	oh right isn't it funny when you go and get something choice you get
S0454	yes you'd have a luxury one where it have a sponge as well but i didn't really see the point
S0455	and the train service be actually good so all that's go now
S0454	well yeah it's only one an hour so it's not that good for work
S0455	oh no oh
S0454	because they
S0452	wrong time
S0454	they're yes they're they leave on the half hour and they get there about well i suppose about just go ten twenty to but it's a bite risky cos i need to be place on the hour
S0455	mm
S0454	i mean actually start the lesson the hour
S0455	yes
S0454	so it's not enough time
S0455	no
S0454	so it mean i'd have to go an hour and a half early
S0455	well that's a pity isn't it
S0454	yeah so that's not so good so on my late day which be tuesday i'll get the train the nine thirty train
S0455	okay
S0454	cos it go oh the good thing be it go at nine thirty one so then you're on off peak nine thirty will still be
S0455	oh right okay so that's good
S0454	peak so they've work that out quite carefully
S0452	yeah
S0454	so that's quite thoughtful
S0455	yes
S0454	but all the other days no i'd have to go in really early if i go on the train so that's really annoy actually
S0455	yes
S0454	cos i'd have to get the seven thirty train
S0455	yes
S0454	to be sure of get there for ten to nine
S0452	and then do a bite of yeah
S0455	unless you have work to work get there
S0454	and i'd be pay the peak train fare
S0454	yes so i don't think i'll do that much but it's good on the way home maybe i think especially if i take the bike in cos you can put the bike on the train on the way back
S0455	mm
S0454	and two pound thirty it's the same for a single and a return but i mean two pound thirty be fine
S0455	yes
S0452	two pound thirty as a return
S0454	yeah off peak
S0455	yeah that's very good
S0454	because you see the peak hours i think i need to double check but i think peak hours be only in the morning there be no
S0452	right
S0454	peak in the afternoon
S0452	want to avoid the morning one
S0454	yeah so it's after nine thirty be off peak
S0455	so you've get a single track line there
S0454	yes i think it be yeah
S0455	so
S0454	that's maybe why then they can only do one an hour
S0455	so where so where do the train come in from there there
S0454	erm or london it go to london i can go straight through to waterloo sometimes
S0455	ah right okay
S0452	yeah that
S0454	but mostly
S0452	they're they're the point the track but both side of that will be double track
S0454	yes
S0452	pass
S0454	it's quick it's only eight minutes
S0452	oh right to itself
S0455	yeah that

S0454	oh that's a good idea so i'll try that this week
S0452	you don't don't need to remove
S0454	yes that might work better
S0452	the seat yeah just need to pass it through it

S0455	oh right
S0454	and the law catch up with her and that's how it start she's get to go to prison but you know she's
S0455	ah
S0454	really middle class
S0455	that must be difficult
S0454	you know actually in a way it's worse isn't it
S0455	mm
S0454	because if she be from a family where lot of people have be in and out of prison then it wouldn't be as bad have you hear of that orange be the new black
S0455	mm
S0454	about this middle class american
S0452	oh right yes yes
S0454	young in her thirties but she end up in prison
S0452	yeah yeah
S0454	it's quite funny
S0452	yeah
S0454	cos she's really unsuitable what she's really like all really not like any of the other girls
S0452	no
S0454	and of course they give her a really hard time
S0452	oh
S0455	yes
S0454	er but she's get on okay now but then of course the look at the effect on her relationship outside where she's change
S0455	yeah

S0455	yes
S0454	have you watch that
S0452	i haven't actually that
S0454	it's quite very funny yeah it's quite witty and it yeah it's quite i suppose quite observant because in a way it'd be more difficult if you be nothing like
S0452	yeah
S0454	any of the other people
S0452	yeah
S0454	she just have to get on with it
S0455	so that's your way you're relax your netflix
S0454	yes that's good in the even
S0455	yes have you get use to not have any curtain up
S0454	mm yeah it's a bite strange
S0455	actually cos when you do get some it'll be a lot warmer
S0454	yes that's true yes i think that
S0455	so when you get time you want to go and see what sort of curtain rail
S0454	no dad and i do look didn't we we we go to erm

S0454	yes it and we saw some like this and to be honest they be cheaper weren't they than the the fake metal ones
S0452	yeah that fake metal one
S0454	i don't really understand
S0452	i didn't think be very good
S0454	no
S0455	cos until we come here we always
S0454	not that strong
S0455	we didn't have these much
S0452	no
S0455	from previous house we just have what be what be they straight metal
S0452	erm actually they're they're

S0452	er yes yes
S0454	cos they're big hook
S0452	oh yes yes they don't
S0454	they don't
S0452	drag
S0454	yes
S0455	so we've get some brown ones sort of pine colour and bead but i actually like the this white better
S0454	yes yes if you've not get lot of pine furniture i suppose it's better to have white isn't it
S0455	yes might be nice and then you get your curtain up
S0454	yes that's another thing
S0455	except i don't expect you'll be make yourself you're buy ready make
S0454	probably

S0454	dear
S0455	get the stuff out of the roof space put it in dad mark it all down what be it in one
S0452	oh no it take more than a day to be honest

S0455	and people be say to me have you ever be to australia the pupils
S0454	dear
S0455	but no no and then we move upstairs again out of the way and in the end she didn't want it
S0452	do the around
S0455	and we have to unpack we couldn't put it back in the roof space
S0455	cos the box wouldn't fit up there we have to unpack it all
S0454	dear
S0452	oh the the big box didn't they well there be terribly heavy but yeah they're they're back up there now
S0455	yeah yeah it's cos i've tell you the story of the music box
S0454	oh do she want all of those
S0455	she say that she be go to start practise the piano or keyboard could i send her out with some book cos it's so expensive to buy them out there well i didn't quibble with that but actually in a way it's just easier to buy them isn't it than
S0454	yes
S0455	send them out so i spend age look through couldn't find any of hers anyway so i put some of mine in i as a special present i give her a big volume hardback cover of beethoven's sonatas that my teacher have give me when i be a pupil i wasn't i hadn't play them so i think well she can have that pack it all up take it into and actually it didn't cost that much so that be the good thing just
S0454	ah that's good
S0455	fifteen pound
S0454	yes book be cheap usually to send cos i do that come back from japan
S0455	er second class yes
S0454	there be a special book rate
S0452	yeah
S0455	yes
S0454	as long as you only send book
S0455	well fortunately i put the sender on the back so anyway she say could be up to three months it go all the way out there now to be fair to
S0455	she have have that awful cancer diagnosis
S0454	yes
S0455	but anyway it say the book have arrive she never go to collect them
S0452	downstairs
S0455	and about two months later they all arrive back here
S0455	they've be all the way to australia and back

S0455	but
S0454	fifteen pound
S0455	that be pretty good i don't yeah
S0454	that's amaze mm
S0455	so she have use them
S0454	mm
S0455	but i think that be slightly different to the box because she be ill and that it obviously knock her

S0454	and she be move as well

S0455	don't like it
S0454	no it be a nice group and we didn't have to wait around for people
S0455	yes
S0454	so that be good
S0455	where do you meet them in or do you
S0454	no so they'd meet in but when i'd look at the map i realise it be it be nearer me
S0455	it be before the suspension bridge yeah that's it
S0454	so i write to him cos he put a note about message me
S0455	yes
S0454	erm if you're go to meet us there

S0454	right so message me on friday night so i do and he tell me the name of the car park
S0455	okay
S0454	erm and just say google it but i look on my os map and it be there
S0455	yes
S0454	so i just go there and they be there so that be good
S0455	okay and how do you find out about that particular group
S0454	i google oh i didn't even google i just go on facebook and put in
S0455	ah
S0454	you there's a search bar isn't there
S0455	yes
S0454	where it say search for people but you can also use it to search for group
S0455	oh can you
S0454	so if you put in like or walk and just see what come up it's surprise
S0455	mm oh right
S0454	it's quite clever i find a lot through that
S0455	oh do you that that's very good
S0454	or google as well sometimes
S0455	well yes
S0454	yes so i find that one cos a few months ago i start look cos i know i be move
S0455	mm
S0454	so i just start search and then if i find things on facebook i just join them
S0455	oh right mm
S0454	so that they i know what be happen
S0455	oh yes
S0454	so like the one i join months ago
S0455	oh do you yeah
S0454	but it's quite useful cos then i know
S0455	yes
S0454	what be there what club what be happen like with the station and things like that
S0455	mm
S0454	just a bite easier
S0455	it's a good thing for things like facebook and just google there's just there's no need anyway for people to be really lonely be there
S0454	no
S0455	with you know cos there's things there aren't they
S0454	right
S0455	so these group where anybody can go along it's good isn't it
S0454	yes
S0455	mm
S0454	it's not cost me money so that's nice
S0455	yes no good
S0455	do you think there'll be another one
S0454	i think that's go to be quite disorganise
S0455	right
S0454	by the look of it but
S0455	but you might not mind that if you're busy
S0454	no exactly so i don't know how often i'll be able to go though
S0455	well that's
S0454	cos if it's unlucky that
S0455	yeah
S0454	if they do a walk on the weekend where i'm do my course then i won't be able to go and then that might be it for six weeks
S0455	be that the same group that go to or be that something else
S0454	this be the group the one who do the walk
S0455	yes that's
S0454	so that be unusual cos they do two in a row
S0455	oh right okay
S0454	apparently that be awful really badly organise
S0455	be it
S0454	it be say seven miles
S0455	oh
S0454	but it be ten and they get lose and
S0455	oh dear
S0454	it be really muddy and people didn't have the right footwear
S0455	uhu
S0454	that group seem quite disorganise
S0455	oh yes
S0454	they say last year they have to call a helicopter out on
S0455	really
S0454	cos someone have a heart attack in the group and
S0455	mm
S0454	actually know they have a heart problem but didn't bother to tell anybody
S0452	oh dear
S0454	er yeah so now they put this huge disclaimer next to the walk by click on accept you be accept all responsibility
S0455	oh right
S0452	yeah
S0454	we accept no responsibility for your health if you turn up with the wrong footwear it's nothing to do with us
S0455	yeah
S0452	yeah
S0454	but they have to i mean he could have sue that man couldn't he
S0452	cos people complain
S0455	i know it's it's worry what what it's like for people to run anything isn't it today
S0454	there be a solicitor in the group yesterday and she say it's a really good disclaimer because it even say by click accept you accept these accept the invitation you be accept the follow condition
S0452	yeah
S0455	mm
S0454	which be good yes it be worry cos then people won't do it will they if they feel they have to take out insurance and
S0455	no no that's right yes it's a lot of hassle
S0454	be qualify and carry all this extra equipment
S0455	yeah
S0452	yeah
S0455	yeah
S0454	in case and
S0455	yes
S0454	yeah that man be silly wasn't he he should have tell somebody he have a heart condition
S0452	yeah
S0455	yes
S0454	and obviously they would have tell him well perhaps you shouldn't come cos this be a strenuous walk on dartmoor
S0455	yes
S0454	in bad weather
S0455	it's good go to these group isn't it cos in the end you might meet somebody you particularly get on with and then just decide to go on a walk
S0454	yeah
S0455	with that one person occasionally
S0454	yes there be a nice lady yesterday actually
S0455	oh be there
S0454	a german lady but she's be here about twenty years
S0455	yes
S0454	she seem very nice and she say she hasn't be out at all the last two years
S0455	really
S0454	she get divorce and be
S0455	ah
S0454	very upset about it and she's get two children
S0455	ah
S0454	but she say now her ex husband have the children every other week
S0455	oh yes
S0454	but she's just be at home those last two years on those weeks
S0455	have she oh yeah
S0454	but she decide go out
S0455	yeah
S0454	so that be good
S0455	yes mm when when with dad and it be when we move a lot i use to join a couple of things and didn't like the activity at all but from that then i get to know people
S0454	yes yes people say you've be very proactive
S0455	oh do they
S0454	and i say yes but you have to i say move back to the uk be the same as move to another country
S0452	yeah oh yeah
S0454	or move anywhere in the uk be pretty much like move abroad
S0455	be different
S0454	you have to go through the same
S0455	process
S0454	process
S0452	yeah
S0454	of join a lot of things
S0455	yes i think so
S0454	and you may or may not like them but
S0455	yes
S0454	you're meet people all the time
S0455	yeah and you you need to stick at them till you feel safe i think
S0452	yeah
S0455	start to withdraw
S0454	yes
S0455	yes this be call when i meet you know erm who have those two children
S0454	ah yes
S0455	and well something call the housewife's register
S0454	oh
S0455	and they're all over the country and the health visitor tell me to go to and i go to and i hat it cos we be tell it be like professional people who have children meet for some discussion group
S0454	yeah
S0455	i mean it be worth it cos i join it in two different move and both time i meet somebody
S0454	yes well that's good
S0455	from it and then i think well i won't go to the group any more
S0454	yes
S0455	yeah
S0454	yes no it be good
S0455	yes but walking's nice it be nice just a nice activity

S0454	yes explore learn some new place
S0452	yeah
S0455	so be how far for you then to get there
S0454	it's a twenty minute drive but on little lanes so it's probably only about five
S0455	okay
S0454	miles probably seven miles i would have think
S0455	okay you must have nice perhaps sea view in the summer up there
S0454	i don't think you're quite high enough
S0455	oh
S0454	you can see the cliffs at
S0455	oh can you
S0454	someone show me them but i couldn't see the sea
S0455	yes
S0454	maybe you can though on a good day
S0455	you've get all that coastline to explore in the summer it's really nice all down there
S0454	mm
S0455	i quite you know i like devon and dorset coast along there
S0454	yes and there's a nice i saw on the map there's a from there's a river the river that run inland
S0454	and there's a footpath all the way
S0455	oh be there
S0454	north almost to the a thirty
S0455	oh right okay
S0454	that might be quite nice to do
S0455	oh yes
S0454	yes and nice pubs along the way
S0455	mm yes
S0454	as well around there saw some nice pubs
S0455	cos last time i do the
S0454	mm
S0455	the coastal walk on my own
S0455	there on that path sort of northwards and it be it be really lovely

S0454	cos i think oh they haven't send me the letter this year every year they send me a letter say you have to fill in your tax return and i think well they didn't send it this year so that mean i don't have to do it because last year the year before i actually didn't earn anything here zero
S0452	no cos the mark
S0454	because i do the no i didn't do the mark cos i be in spain do that course so i actually didn't do any mark so i put in zero zero zero zero for the whole year and i think oh that's why they haven't send it to me

S0452	what's
S0454	i do it the last two years and it be awful
S0455	be it
S0454	it's just ridiculous try to read it on this you can only get it half the screen cos of their software and it's sixteen page of that
S0455	oh right
S0454	and you have to go back and forward
S0455	mm be they not very well pay
S0454	it wasn't well pay gcse pay less
S0455	no
S0454	but you can do it a lot faster
S0455	ah right
S0452	yeah
S0454	because they're short answer so sometimes they're
S0455	yes
S0454	i mean with gcse you're often only look for keywords
S0455	mm
S0454	and if they've get the keywords you don't read the rest you just give them the full mark
S0455	yes
S0454	they've get it it doesn't matter
S0452	mm
S0454	but with a level it's all in the detail
S0455	mm
S0454	and in the facts and
S0452	what subject be that
S0454	geography
S0452	oh right
S0454	and it be the research paper er so they be sixteen page long most of them
S0455	mm
S0454	yeah i'd and i you know you're suppose to cross reference it all you know blah blah blah say this how do i know suppose to look that all up but you're not get pay
S0455	mm
S0454	to cross reference things i'm not go to do it i'll i i write them a note say i'll do two gcse paper but i'm not do a level this year
S0455	oh yes
S0454	but mostly it's just annoy with the the screen
S0452	mm
S0454	try to read an essay like that
S0452	yeah
S0455	mm
S0454	a third of the page on each one
S0455	yeah
S0454	i just didn't like it but anyway
S0455	well it's good you've get the gcse cos all
S0454	well i haven't yet but i i'm sure they will cos last year they be obviously very understaffed cos they me endless email
S0452	yes
S0454	say will you take on another contract
S0455	oh right okay
S0454	hopefully they will
S0455	you know i hope you're gonna have your job for at university
S0454	yes
S0455	erm you know next year as well
S0454	and there's a pension with that which be good
S0455	oh oh that's good pension
S0454	i pay one percent and they pay one percent i can also up it
S0455	ah that's good
S0454	and tell them i want i think up to four percent and they'll match it or something
S0455	so you haven't get a pension at the moment have you
S0454	no i need to look into that
S0455	no so that's good
S0454	i need to write to
S0455	yes so that's good then
S0454	national insurance and find out if i can pay miss years
S0455	yes
S0452	yeah
S0454	they use to let you
S0452	yeah
S0454	i dunno if they still do you'd think they would wouldn't you
S0452	they'd probably be there'll be a scheme
S0454	it'd be a bite silly if they didn't
S0452	yeah yes some top up
S0455	yes i think you can er but when it come to me pay i think i do find out about it
S0454	wasn't worth it
S0455	it wasn't worth it no because you're younger it'd be different
S0454	yes if i'm miss five years
S0455	yes
S0454	even if it's hundreds
S0455	yes
S0454	a couple of thousand
S0455	yes
S0454	or more it's probably still worth it
S0455	yes anyway they'd help you proceed if you make enquiries
S0454	yes i need to find out about that and then i'm fairly sort with first move back job i think
S0455	yes it's really good so soon cos if you can keep that job at university you know and take time off in the summer to go somewhere else you've get that long term i mean that's enough to keep isn't it that money presumably
S0454	yes
S0455	and yet
S0454	and they're flexible most people aren't
S0455	the rest be extra
S0454	they're not full time there most people they're work elsewhere and they're okay about that
S0455	oh be they okay
S0454	so if you find better pay work in
S0455	yes
S0454	that's to do so most people be work
S0455	oh right
S0454	another job two days a week
S0455	oh right
S0454	and they're on like point six or point eight
S0455	yes
S0454	and they college they don't mind
S0455	that's good isn't it yeah
S0455	mm yes
S0454	so that's something to look out for isn't it if i see better pay work
S0452	yeah
S0455	yes
S0452	yeah
S0455	yes and keep in with something like university's good isn't it
S0454	yeah yes that's right
S0455	will you think about go back to the place you be at at this last summer
S0454	no
S0455	no
S0454	no i won't go back there
S0455	no okay
S0454	there's no point really
S0455	no
S0454	not for the money cos i'd be on almost the same money at university not work my even
S0452	okay yes
S0455	ah yes of course
S0454	yes so at least i'd be finish by six with university
S0455	mm
S0454	and have the weekend free but i'd be better off go somewhere like where they pay a lot better
S0452	yes okay
S0454	and cover the accommodation
S0455	what do they pay there then
S0454	eight hundred a week
S0455	do they
S0454	that's one of the best in the country though cos i look
S0455	really that's very good
S0454	but they they start hire early i need to start look from next month
S0455	and will that be like two or three month's work
S0454	could be i it normally go six weeks or eight weeks
S0455	okay that's not too far away be it
S0454	no that's the thing
S0452	no
S0454	but i need to work it out carefully with what they're offer at university cos i don't want to be leave with six weeks where i'm not employ anywhere so i might be
S0455	no
S0454	better off sign up for the next block of class with university
S0455	mm
S0454	cos right now i'm employ till the twenty second of april
S0455	yes
S0452	ah yes
S0454	but you see the other universities aren't go to start till the begin of june at the earliest
S0452	yeah yeah
S0454	so then i'm go to miss out at least a month but possibly two month's pay so i might be better off sign up for another block
S0452	yeah
S0455	mm yes
S0454	but i'd have to work it out it might not it might work out that the pay be so good somewhere like
S0455	yes
S0454	you're better off do the full whack with them
S0455	mm
S0454	and say i'm gonna have my month's holiday early
S0455	ah yes
S0454	cos you're not get an august holiday be you
S0455	mm and then you've get to see if you're gonna let your house out haven't you
S0454	yes if i work somewhere else you mean
S0455	in yeah in take that into the equation of
S0454	yes
S0455	that money
S0454	yeah well i suppose you don't know do you
S0452	no
S0455	no no
S0454	it's but then if i wouldn't be lose money anyway
S0455	no
S0454	if they're pay my accommodation in it doesn't actually matter do it it's the same
S0452	no oh no
S0454	cos i'm not
S0455	yes
S0454	pay rent in and
S0455	no
S0452	no
S0454	so it's it's exactly the same actually
S0452	and if they yes
S0454	leave the house empty
S0452	oh if they put accommodation in yes
S0455	mm no but i mean if you'd go to and then you'd lose er you have to wait a month before you could start after finish in
S0454	yes
S0455	then if you if you're let the house out as well as go to then you've get that extra into the equation haven't you
S0454	yes well i think i wouldn't wouldn't know would i it's not like edinburgh with the festival where
S0455	you wouldn't definitely know
S0452	no no
S0455	no

S0454	yes
S0455	the way you go before
S0454	no not that one
S0455	they wouldn't go with that one cos it's so slow
S0454	ah right so go to
S0455	along the a thirty to
S0454	ah right then turn off
S0455	yes
S0455	so be you get use to be back in the country now
S0454	yes
S0455	how do it feel cos it must be so different after all these years away
S0454	well well they say though the first few weeks they call it the or even months the honeymoon
S0455	oh do they
S0454	phase
S0455	ah
S0454	there's cos i learn all about it with this course i just do
S0455	oh right okay
S0454	the the workshop
S0455	yes
S0454	and now when you come back you're initially in a honeymoon phase where you enjoy it
S0455	ah yes
S0454	because you all the things you miss
S0455	yes
S0454	will be obvious to you so and then there's things that be different like the weather that you appreciate and things like that so i'm still in that phase
S0455	okay
S0454	and then after that they say that will wear off
S0455	yes
S0454	and then actually you can feel a bite down
S0455	ah right it's interest to know
S0454	and then you pick up but yes the first usually when you go back people be quite happy
S0455	ah
S0454	it's all new and you're busy as well aren't you
S0455	yes
S0454	so
S0455	but you've at least get the summer then well it's well it's well it's that's quite good
S0454	yes i be say that to people they say oh you've come at the worst time of year i say not really actually because
S0455	not by no i think it's good
S0454	you've get something to look forward to
S0455	yes
S0454	and you're busy at first so
S0455	yes
S0454	by the time i get to that point where you know the novelty's wear off
S0455	yes
S0454	then we've get the nicer weather come
S0455	yes
S0454	so actually i think it's a good time of year to be back
S0455	so you're fine with it though
S0454	yes
S0455	that's good
S0454	so that's good
S0455	i can remember come back from africa
S0454	yes
S0455	and it be i mean i have two years out in the bush and it be a very quiet night and i love it it be really good but it be very strange come back and i couldn't cope with people i just have to go off every afternoon
S0454	mm
S0455	just be by myself for a couple of hours and it strike me everybody be so spoil and materialistic that's the other thing
S0454	yes
S0455	cos i have be live on a very low income
S0454	mm
S0455	and then i do adjust but then we move to london with dad for his job but he be in london and i go there as well and that be seem very difficult
S0454	yes
S0455	from be out in the bush then i what two months later go round london and and tube for age every day
S0454	yes so it be probably more of a change for you
S0455	difficult yes perhaps it be
S0454	yes for me i suppose abu dhabi be a big city so i suppose it's quieter here
S0455	yes
S0454	but there's actually quite a lot go on here that i want to do
S0455	yes that's good you've get
S0454	that's good it's not there's load go on it's just it's things that i like do isn't it
S0455	yes
S0454	so there's plenty of outdoors group
S0455	yes that's good
S0454	erm the university's quite a good place to work cos there'll be things go on there
S0455	so it's better be it
S0454	all the time yes
S0455	mm
S0454	so that's good cos i do that anyway go to talk and things
S0455	use to before
S0454	yes
S0455	yes
S0454	in abu dhabi i go
S0455	yes
S0454	so that's yes good and work should keep me busy
S0455	yes well it's a very good anecdote isn't it work
S0454	yes
S0455	i think that's can really help you through well it help me to settle better i be just say to dad that when we move you know in many ways it be easier if you're the one go to work because your mind's on that isn't it
S0454	yes
S0455	whereas the person who's at home you've gotta think oh you know this be a strange place and it's harder to settle in
S0454	yes that's right they say that about you know the couple go to move to dubai that i just saw
S0455	ah right
S0454	that be more difficult for the wive
S0455	ah right
S0454	much more difficult
S0455	yeah
S0454	and in a way the husband be protect by the corporate culture which won't be that different
S0455	yes
S0454	to work at home
S0455	mm
S0454	you know it's the same rule isn't it
S0455	yes
S0454	so they're not learn a whole lot of new rule again
S0455	no no
S0454	they be and they've get that structure
S0455	mm
S0454	but for the wive there's no structure
S0455	no no
S0454	and even worse before they probably work in england then they move there and not allow to work
S0454	they've get all this time to fill each day
S0455	very difficult i know it can be pointless just go to coffee with people i think you need a purpose
S0454	yes and if you're not into that anyway
S0455	no
S0454	cos i ask the lady
S0455	oh dear
S0454	what do you think you'll do and she say she be a very care person she's be a teach assistant and things so would she do volunteer work she kind of make a face so
S0455	what's she gonna do she'll go mad
S0454	i know yeah
S0455	oh
S0454	she's gonna come home quite a lot but in way that can make it difficult to settle
S0455	to settle be it a just for a couple of years they've get there
S0454	yeah i think three years quite a long time three years
S0455	yes dear
S0454	yes i think she need to think how she's gonna fill her day
S0455	yeah no i think it's very difficult for wive
S0454	and there's only so much shop you can do she say she like shop but i mean even if you go
S0455	yes
S0454	three hours a day i mean
S0455	yes
S0454	it's not that's not even half the day isn't it
S0455	yes well i wonder what 's do i mean i
S0454	mm
S0455	to start with it's like a honeymoon go over that you know the weather
S0454	yes
S0455	and now she's be there a bite longer i mean she sound fine but she doesn't do very much
S0454	no and she's go quiet cos she use to email me quite a lot and it's go quiet
S0455	ah she have go quiet so that that could be part of it
S0454	so it's a bite like i think when she's quiet
S0455	yes
S0454	mm
S0455	so she i mean the email sound bright and cheerful but all she seem to be do be go to the pool and the gym well i'd go potty just do that
S0454	yeah
S0455	she's get friends a coffee but you need a purpose don't you
S0454	yes and she be work before so it be different
S0455	yes yes that's it it would be very different
S0454	mm
S0455	but maybe it's not for long
S0454	no well
S0455	well that's it we don't know if have be on this course and just sort of think oh well it's quite stressful try to keep up with all these email so just decide to cut
S0454	yeah
S0455	or if she's not well with the treatment don't know do you
S0454	no or feel down
S0455	yeah that's it
S0454	mm
S0455	well the last time i saw speak to her she and that be after the retreat she be very down from the treatment
S0454	oh right mm so what's that the drug just make her feel down
S0455	yes i think so
S0454	mm
S0455	because it do terrible things to you doesn't it
S0454	that's basically poison isn't it
S0455	yes and then go round with that limp all the time
S0454	i know
S0455	and then what be she do about work because she seem to be do hardly any work when i speak to her
S0454	i don't think she's need to worry about that cos she have that insurance money come didn't she
S0455	i don't know cos she
S0454	well she tell you actually to she be get insurance money
S0455	she tell me that she be try to take a pension out
S0454	yes well i think she's get it as far as i know
S0455	right
S0454	so in that sense financially she must be fine
S0455	yes the fact she's not worry about that but you could worry couldn't you spend all your pension
S0454	well
S0455	less
S0454	yeah i think she's get to think about the next twenty years not the next sixty really she's get to
S0455	right
S0454	plan a bite shorter time hasn't she
S0455	i suppose i suppose so i suppose to be realistic yes
S0454	she's better off think about the next ten
S0455	yes
S0454	years
S0455	yes
S0454	cos at the end of the day if you be really destitute age sixty the government's get no choice but to help you
S0455	well i be gonna say surely you've get this
S0454	so it's the people in between who suffer isn't it
S0455	yes
S0454	the people who have some money or worse have a house
S0455	yes yes
S0454	and then the government won't help you cos they say look you've get all this equity and you could sell your house
S0455	yes
S0454	the people who be best off be those who be either comfortably well off
S0455	yes
S0454	and have the pension or be very poor
S0455	mm
S0454	and the government must help you
S0455	yes
S0454	so she shouldn't worry
