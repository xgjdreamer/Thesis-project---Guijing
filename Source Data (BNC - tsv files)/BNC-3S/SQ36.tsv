S0338	no it's something tell me about south africa you know you know you know when you put your your your card in the machine put your finger over the number because
S0336	oh the heat sensors
S0338	well er the the cameras anything can pick up the number anybody er in case anyone
S0337	do you want a drink

S0336	i think your mum look confuse
S0337	do you want
S0338	i don't mind
S0337	rubro
S0338	i don't mind
S0337	alright you don't mind
S0338	i'll have the
S0337	so do you want apple mango orange or cloudy lemonade
S0338	i think apple
S0337	apple
S0336	that be my first choice
S0338	yeah it be i put that down on the
S0336	yeah i i remember watch this thing on tv where like they be say that erm a lot of criminals have start cos erm they can basically they can work out your code base on cos if so say you've get like four number if it's the person right behind you thirty three erm if you if they come right after you they can do this thing where they like basically they put like this plastic sheet on the thing
S0338	oh
S0336	and so they can see what the last four
S0338	the pressure
S0336	cos of the cos you leave heat mark or something
S0338	yeah
S0336	or actually it's an app it's an app so that if they hold their phone over the erm payment thing it can pick up the heat signal like it's like thermal you know like the thermal image that you see the police interceptors use
S0338	yeah
S0336	like it's an app that do the same thing so what it do be it highlight the last four number that be use and obviously that really limit what the the kind of
S0338	yes
S0336	different cod it could be well actually because obviously the the one that show up the strongest will have be the last one you press so they can kind of work out what your code be so they be say like erm when you do it you should put like all your like put all your finger on
S0338	finger on everything
S0336	yeah
S0338	i'm gonna start do that as well
S0336	yeah
S0338	cos i don't trust anybody
S0336	no and you shouldn't really
S0338	no
S0336	but the thing be as well you know like even if they have your code they still have to get hold of your card to be able to
S0338	yes
S0336	do anything with it so
S0338	yeah the thing be if anything happen with any of the the number and things i would feel so violate
S0336	yeah
S0338	it would really affect me
S0336	yeah
S0338	cos when they the when they have the attempt break in in the house the boys be quite small but it really do affect me for a long long time
S0336	yeah
S0338	and i be second away from open the kitchen door and see that person at that window if i'd have do that i would have have to leave
S0336	i think it really shock my mum when we have our break in
S0338	that person go in
S0336	yeah cos as you er obviously she be like fairly recently single as well so i think
S0338	oh god
S0336	she be like she wasn't really use to just be the only one in the house so
S0338	yeah
S0336	i think he really shake her it wasn't long after that that we move
S0338	yeah
S0336	i don't think it be link i think that there be a lot of reason why we move but i do think mum just didn't feel very safe there anymore
S0338	yes
S0336	we certainly go through a period of have to lock the door as soon as you get in the house which just wasn't a very nice feel
S0338	yeah yeah
S0336	we do that now though i think it's it's not a bad habit to get into be it really
S0338	yeah it's change everything's change the world's change
S0336	i think it would be different if we have people come in and out of the house but once i know me and be in it's like oh i might as well lock the door
S0338	lock the door
S0336	yeah
S0338	yeah we do yeah and if we're eat i always lock the front door
S0336	yeah
S0338	didn't use to i do it now i certainly do now
S0336	it would be really easy for you to not notice though wouldn't it really especially like if you and be have dinner in the kitchen
S0338	in the kitchen and the tv's on and the door's close
S0336	yeah yeah you wouldn't have a clue
S0338	and there's be a few time i've hear things and i felt oh it's the cat but perhaps you should check
S0336	yeah
S0338	yeah anyway be you well
S0336	yeah i'm well
S0338	just the commute
S0336	yeah and do you know what like i'm get use to it i think if i can make it through winter i think that would be a fairly significant step because it be easy enough during the summer because it be
S0338	yes
S0336	it wasn't a bad drive and especially over the summer holiday obviously there be less traffic on the road so it's actually quite a nice like
S0338	yeah
S0336	kind of journey and i be get in easy i be get home easy and like also like
S0338	so the difference be the school
S0336	the difference be the school hugely yeah and also the bad weather because those that probably would have cycle or get the train
S0338	yes yes
S0336	be put off when it get to when it get to winter so there be there be more traffic now especially like try to get out of in the even there's a lot more traffic which be a bite shit but it's alright and i think
S0338	after christmas it'll die down probably
S0336	it'll die down and i think as well like i'm i'm i'm get use to it because i think more than anything it's a mental adjustment
S0338	oh yes
S0336	so i obviously get quite i get quite use to leave the house at a certain time and get home at a certain time and you have to adjust your expectations when you're commute but in the grand scheme of things like i only i only travel like an hour extra a day than i use to cos it use especially when we be go from to it be take us forty five minutes so i'm not add that much
S0338	and that's a commuter town
S0336	yeah so
S0338	and all that traffic on the road
S0336	it's not really i'm not really i mean the thing be i leave at the same time as and like he say like most most even he work late so er
S0338	do he get pay for the extra time
S0336	yeah
S0338	oh good
S0336	he get pay overtime
S0338	yes
S0336	but like
S0338	well that that's a good then isn't it
S0336	exactly
S0338	for the two of you
S0336	but the thing be even if he even if he leave work straightaway the earliest he'd be home be half past five so that's only an hour before me anyway so to say that i actually commute i don't actually have that long a day in comparison
S0338	yes
S0336	to him so i really can't complain
S0338	do you only have half an hour for lunch
S0336	i can have whatever i want but it depend it it a hundred percent depend on like traffic in the morning so i always leave at half past eight but on a good day i'll get in at half past nine so i could have an hour for lunch and still leave at half past five but if there's traffic and i don't get in
S0338	thank you
S0336	i don't get in till nearer to ten o'clock
S0338	coke zero
S0336	it cut my
S0337	coke zero
S0336	what
S0337	coke zero
S0336	yeah thank you erm yeah if i don't get in till ten o'clock
S0337	erm
S0336	and i still wanna leave at half past five obviously that mean i can only have half an hour for lunch but i don't really mind at the moment obviously in the summer you can go for a walk and stuff but it's not really walky weather at the moment so i don't really wanna do a lot with my lunch
S0338	no
S0336	i just wanna eat
S0338	yes
S0336	and then carry on
S0338	yes
S0336	i'd rather leave early
S0338	yes
S0336	but yeah it's it's pretty naff especially at night like and if you leave if i can get in early and leave early that work
S0338	yes
S0336	if i leave late and get in late that work but if you try and do anything that's remotely around the peak time you've get no chance leave between four and half past five it'll take you an hour and a half to get home and if you leave between sort of half past seven and half past eight in the morning
S0338	and remember bank holiday i remember what happen that may bank holiday and you get home at seven something i remember that
S0336	i've have worse i have it take me i leave the house erm a few weeks ago at half past eight in the morning and i didn't get in till eleven o'clock that be shite and it's it's take me the same about of time i've leave at like i've leave at like half five and then it's be nearly eight o'clock when i get home which isn't very nice
S0337	there's nothing you can do

S0336	erm so what have you get what have you get for christmas

S0338	yeah but he'll love it won't he he'll love it
S0336	sound quite cool
S0338	isn't it he'll love it so er
S0336	to go with all his chutneys
S0338	yeah and he can make his own cheese
S0336	wow
S0338	be it'll be soft cheese
S0336	yeah
S0338	but cheese
S0336	that's quite cool
S0338	and er all sort of things i've do quite well with but erm
S0336	i've tell i don't really wanna get him something he's ask for because that's what he do all the time
S0338	i know
S0336	for his birthdays christmas it's like
S0338	i know
S0336	oh i need this new gadget so he know before he's open it what he's get i wanna i really wanna i wanna try and surprise him
S0338	yeah
S0337	yeah i've always forget what he's ask for
S0338	i know
S0337	i mean maybe something like secateurs he always need secateurs
S0338	he always need secateurs he do
S0337	i buy him
S0338	always need secateurs
S0337	i buy him secateurs i buy him a saw
S0338	or yeah
S0337	i buy him
S0338	drill
S0337	a hose i buy him a wheelbarrow wheel
S0337	i buy him that thing last year
S0338	yeah
S0337	he's always ask for them or i pick up on the fact that i've lose my saw alright
S0337	i'll get you a saw then he find a saw and he use his
S0338	well this year we've go for some quirky practical things now that you're er house owners and or you have properties cos they don't own do they but so that so that practical things
S0337	oh yeah
S0338	that you wouldn't normally buy for yourselves so there's some really weirdy things and then there's some just practical things and then surprise and then some lovely things
S0337	some of us own our own house
S0338	yeah so you're erm a good few erm months into the mortgage now
S0336	i know it's pretty scary i think
S0337	do we tell her what we find out this
S0336	yeah i think be quite sensible about it i think once we're actually maybe in august or something once we've actually do as much as we can with the house and once we're once we're happy that we've get everything that we want
S0338	yeah
S0336	i think we might start try to overpay a little bite on the mortgage because i just the way i see it be the best part about what we've be able to do now be that it'll help us put some money down
S0338	yes
S0336	so that the next time we buy
S0338	yes
S0336	we can obviously buy on our own
S0338	yes yes
S0336	erm but i think as it stand only about a third of what we pay each month be go against the capital
S0338	right
S0336	so obviously if we could afford to overpay a little bite each month it's just gonna boost up what we have
S0338	of course it will
S0336	at the end so i think
S0338	for
S0336	we're gonna sit down properly and once once we're once we're comfortable
S0338	yeah
S0336	once we've actually do what we
S0338	yeah
S0336	wanna do in the house
S0338	yeah
S0336	we'll kind of sit down and work out if we can afford to pay a little bite more
S0338	yes
S0336	cos i just think it will make a huge difference
S0338	yes yeah this one doesn't come with the refill
S0337	no this one
S0338	mm
S0337	they don't no
S0338	oh right

S0338	fanta or sprite
S0337	or coke
S0338	sprite
S0337	then do you wanna finish off
S0338	ah can you manage three
S0337	yeah well i be gonna go up and get the i mean drizzle we don't need drizzle do we
S0336	erm
S0337	the the they just come with the flavour
S0336	erm when i be i obviously go to erm i go to at the weekend
S0338	he's quite relax
S0336	i know
S0338	be he have a little pop at you then
S0336	no he be he say he be gonna get some basically you can get like sauce and stuff like so
S0338	oh right yeah
S0336	erm but no erm i come home with a fairly like i dunno we'd we'd be we'd be want to work out for age basically we pay six hundred and fifty pound a month so we want to know like how much of that be interest
S0338	yeah
S0336	so i come home like yesterday and break the news that quite a lot of it be interest
S0338	yes
S0336	erm so i think we're erm we're both already a bite like stress with money and stuff so it didn't go down very well but once i'd work it out i didn't wanna sit on it and worry about it by myself so i think i have to tell him but
S0338	yeah
S0336	it's just it's it's a horrible thing cos you just think like you can save yourself so much money in the long run
S0338	yes
S0336	by pay more now but it mean you have to sacrifice a lot more now to be able to have more in the long run
S0338	yes
S0336	so it's it's a really hard one cos it make financial sense
S0338	i know mm
S0336	to pay as much as you can now
S0338	yeah yeah
S0336	and then when we're your age hopefully we'll be in the same situation as you
S0338	yeah
S0336	in that we'll have pay everything off and
S0338	when when we be your age we couldn't see it
S0336	no
S0336	we just like you just go on and on and on and
S0337	you might have a bite of tang of fanta in there
S0337	i accidentally put some fanta in and and look at napkins and
S0338	look fine
S0337	a knife maybe
S0336	erm yeah maybe but yeah it's it be quite depress cos you just think like there's so many things cos obviously we be still quite young and there be so many things we would like to do but everything you do now you kind of know that you'll be pay for a later and it's just but you don't wanna live your whole life for the house cos otherwise you'd just be sad wouldn't you
S0338	yeah
S0336	so i don't want to
S0338	we erm we have fun time if you know you've gotta like we that's that's what the secret that's what sundays be all about

S0336	yeah
S0338	use to take erm ballroom dance then move here cos er they'd move up from er somewhere in i think and er he join two male voice choir and he be just a lovely lovely man so when he die out of the blue she'd already beat breast cancer
S0336	yeah
S0338	it be all about and we this it's all all about her all about her she live in a cottage at the end of 's garden basically at the end of this little drive and er she use to barge down the house demand drink
S0336	oh god
S0338	but be embarrass and then she be put in the home and she be drink she be get really mouthy with the other residents anyway she'd she'd have warn come back from ceylon and her mum's be serve notice 's get her into rehab somewhere over way absolutely awful
S0337	rehab
S0338	rehab
S0336	how old be she
S0338	she's in her seventies
S0337	wow
S0338	it's just be embarrass
S0336	yeah
S0338	it's that bad
S0336	you almost think that at that point be there any point like
S0338	mm
S0336	let her drown in the stuff
S0338	well the doctor the gp before she go to this nurse home where they've do so much for her at one point she start take over and order everyone around and hop that but then get a bite on the bottle and but she say the gp tell the best thing you could do be just leave her
S0336	yeah
S0338	when she's if she's tell to leave this house just leave her
S0336	i wouldn't
S0338	she couldn't do it i couldn't do it
S0337	leave her in a home
S0338	leave her if she's kick out not take her back
S0337	leave her where
S0338	on the street the gp say that turn around and say to me yesterday and she say do you know the gp be probably right it's the only way to cure her
S0336	they need to hit rock bottom
S0338	mm
S0336	but they're in that age bracket that you'd never leave them to hit rock bottom would you
S0338	well you couldn't of course you couldn't just see this in the paper this affluent couple in a self make businessman
S0336	oh yeah
S0338	they would lose everything and they don't deserve it sorry
S0336	no please take your time enjoy it
S0337	nice that
S0338	mm
S0336	it be it's definitely a step up from the like of kfc and that type of
S0337	yeah
S0338	oh yeah
S0337	but it's it's more than than pizza express or prezzo or
S0338	mm
S0337	i don't know it's any of the chain it's it's it's er two step above mcdonald's
S0338	uhu
S0337	kfc burger king it's a step above pizza hut
S0338	uhu
S0337	i think that's about it it fit in
S0338	mm
S0337	i think that's where it fit in
S0338	mm i've only be to frankie and er frankie and what be it
S0336	benny's
S0337	benny's
S0338	benny's once
S0337	it's probably about the same level as that it's probably i prefer the food
S0336	it's cheaper it's cheaper
S0337	cheap it's cheap it's cheap so we get technically we get the three drink a starter and that's that's a main
S0338	mm mm
S0337	and these be half mains so we get we get a fair amount but like
S0338	mm
S0336	when we come with my dad he whack out his force card so they get like ten percent discount as well it's like they don't need to know i'm not in the force anymore
S0337	but er isn't the it's probably still
S0336	well i imagine it probably would count but if i be in the force
S0337	what do you wanna do
S0336	i prefer be in
S0337	yeah this have get chunk of lime in it it didn't use to would you like one of these i'll go that way then
S0336	take you to the table
S0337	yeah it's a lot stickier than it use to be yeah but there didn't use to be chunk of erm lime on it
S0338	oh
S0337	just a bite too limey i think
S0336	erm one of my friends who live in she live in er she currently live in erm in a house share
S0338	mm mm
S0336	but her boyfriend also but not that make no sense do it
S0337	his last name's
S0336	yeah he's like so he be always know as but he's not a
S0336	what
S0337	yeah
S0336	yeah anyway erm he start a new job er a couple of months ago erm and within the first three months he'd be let go so he's now in london unemployed just er it i think he's like find it quite difficult but like i be say like you know if something like ever happen to me and it would be horrible but we'd survive whereas like if if you're in london you can't survive without a job and because him and don't live together yet she can't even like take on the he's still get rent and stuff to pay and i mean she even say even if even if they be live together there's no way she could absorb his bill and stuff
S0338	it's not good be it
S0336	i think we've work out that if we ever have to we could but we just wouldn't be able to do anything
S0338	mm mm
S0337	we'd we'd what
S0336	mm
S0337	what sorry
S0336	i say we probably could like we probably could live on one wage but we wouldn't be able to do a lot would we
S0338	mm
S0337	no i think
S0338	you'd always have egg
S0336	we'd always have egg
S0337	if you work in town we could but i don't think we could with your travel cost
S0336	maybe not
S0338	no
S0337	the travel cost would be like the cost of the live
S0336	i know
S0337	whereas there's there's i still have a loan yeah i i suppose that's the pound of that
S0336	my loan
S0337	yeah we we couldn't quite for a bite cos would have a loan go out
S0336	don't
S0337	which which be enough right okay fine if i be work and lose her job i'd have to pay for our mortgage
S0338	yeah
S0337	erm which our our mortgage and bill which work
S0338	yeah
S0337	out to be
S0336	about nine hundred pound
S0337	nine nine hundred pound and then your loan so i'd be leave with with er a hundred and fifty pound a month to live off
S0336	to fee us
S0337	to fee us but if i lose my job then you'd have to pay for it all we'd probably be leave with about the same but oh no cos
S0338	travel
S0337	you have travel cost so
S0338	yeah
S0337	it would probably work out probably fifty quid a hundred quid cheap which we you could keep worse off than less we'd have no money
S0337	we'd have no money but we could move home you could buy us out so
S0336	we're not gonna lose our job
S0337	in theory
S0338	well
S0337	you could buy us out though couldn't you
S0336	we're not or if you could get a pay rise before i lose my job that would be good
S0337	oh yeah if i get a pay rise first
S0338	yeah
S0337	and just oh i speak cos obviously go go up to when you come down
S0338	mm mm
S0337	i'm in the car with
S0338	uhu
S0337	and my boss
S0338	oh yeah yes
S0337	so we're and he he's an alright guy you know i get on really well with him actually or quite well it seem erm and we be talk about salaries and we we manage to get him to agree that our department be clearly underpay he be as well so i'm on seventeen seven hundred or something yeah erm er he must be on the mid twenties which be not we should be on low twenties
S0338	yeah
S0337	he should be on a higher wage
S0336	he i think he's on a similar wage to me which be just ridiculous
S0337	yeah
S0336	cos
S0338	be this
S0337	yeah and let's face it we're try to we we're
S0338	how much be an installation how much do it bring profit for the company
S0337	erm i'd say a
S0338	how much responsibility financially be you be you handle
S0337	my in my
S0338	if you go wrong it would cost a lot of money wouldn't it
S0337	yeah erm okay so work this out a hundred meg circuit which be our staple cos round about what we need to have for a five year term let's say be ten grand a year
S0338	right
S0337	so that's fifty grand in theory
S0338	yeah
S0337	so yeah erm it's a lot of money okay so the month monthly revenue for me be four hundred pound three to four hundred pound a month on the circuit go on so today i have an install that fail that would probably be about a two hundred meg circuit three hundred and fifty four hundred pound a month that's worth erm sometimes you get ones for like a thousand pound install fee or two thousand pound install fee and then then the revenue other than that it's a lot of money like erm i'm try to work it out
S0338	so there's there's a lot of money in the pot isn't there
S0337	yeah and some people have er waivers so a customer might have ten thousand pound worth of excess cost that the company will just write off as soon as they get it
S0338	it's absorb
S0337	so up to ten thousand pound worth on that cost so we're deliver the circuit
S0338	well so if a ceiling's put on that
S0337	yeah so
S0338	then it can go to look after the staff
S0337	i'm say what i'm say i'm say if we if i deliver him that circuit and we provide the circuit and for my customers i allow ten thousand pound of it to be waivered and i have ninety circuit in my
S0338	yeah
S0337	that's nine million pound
S0338	wow
S0337	in theory
S0336	mm
S0337	so i suppose it's a large like our
S0338	however however you've get a job and you're be pay
S0336	i think the aim be
S0338	and you're staff
S0336	what's most most recent aim be to get to bonus time and then think about
S0338	yeah
S0337	have a look around erm
S0336	i really want him to finish his degree so that's what i
S0338	i do and if you're there it's a safe place to be while you do that
S0336	yeah well the idea be actually i want him to properly look into the finance situation and see what help he'd get
S0338	yeah
S0336	cos if he'd get help it might allow him to
S0337	part time
S0336	do part time which i think would facilitate study more
S0338	yeah
S0337	cos cos i'm not
S0336	i think he's too stress at the moment to try and do a
S0337	i'm in a job that's stressful
S0338	yeah
S0337	really stressful we we're we're hit on we have so many things we have to meet so many kpis
S0338	yeah
S0337	and so many
S0338	yeah
S0337	stats
S0336	i can barely get him to do anything in the even as it be like
S0338	really
S0337	that's what the problem be yeah
S0336	let alone try to get him to do like study
S0337	it's so short short staff right so you know they close
S0338	yeah
S0337	close the office in yeah
S0338	yeah
S0337	that be like
S0338	be that guy still with you the one at
S0337	they've he's he's just just get a promotion and become manager
S0338	oh lovely
S0337	yeah but i've only be there a year people you you have to be there about two years before you're even consider
S0338	yeah would that be a nice increment for you
S0336	it would be a substantial
S0337	about six grand six grand more
S0338	mm
S0337	but a lot a lot of pressure
S0336	a lot of like he'd have to be
S0338	right
S0337	and stress
S0336	pretty much have to be the first one erm in the office and the last one out
S0337	yeah
S0338	yeah
S0336	because you have to be able to say like my team do this or my team be do that
S0338	yeah yeah
S0337	erm yeah so i get that what be i say what be i say it's like what be i talk about oh yeah so close and i think that be about forty or fifty job that go yeah all that work move up to
S0338	yeah yeah
S0337	er some of them move up to up in we we recruit those people that have come in have replace the people that go to yeah we then recruit again and there be basically more people that have leave we've never gain people we've never gain
S0338	but you've get all the work
S0336	yeah
S0337	all the work and i have fuck cheek from my director to turn round and say yeah we're gonna try and get to fifty five a head like we we we've never drop below seventy we've i'm on eighty the high eighties at the moment the most i have be a hundred and five and i'll get down to fifty five it's bullshit it's not happen erm i've be to i've talk to him a few time but the account people that have leave and they've go to or leave the company so erm so
S0336	the problem seem to be as well like their recruitment their recruitment and train scheme doesn't kind of be enough to get people to stay so even though they've get new people start who won't stay for very long because be say this week that like
S0337	it's fifteen people already leave account that have leave
S0338	and you've be there
S0337	in the last six months
S0336	he's say this week that new people be
S0337	oh no sixteen sixteen
S0338	what sort of job be they go to be they get better money or be it just to get away from the pressure
S0337	erm
S0336	both
S0337	a few a few progression
S0338	mm mm
S0337	oh yeah and then two people the no three people who have that have go to team managers within so that's that's
S0338	mm
S0337	so nineteen people that have leave our job roles
S0338	good lord
S0337	a few have go over to the er three people there erm four four people have go to
S0338	mm mm
S0337	er three people have go to team management roles three people have go to like our quality improvement team
S0338	yeah
S0337	erm and then leave leave erm leave two two good ones planners erm yeah so people leave
S0338	mm
S0336	and the new people they're get in they're not even like spend any time with like say this week
S0337	right
S0336	that they're just dump them on the floor
S0337	yeah they've they've dump some people on floor this week that last week of the month we're do a six hundred and fifty k push to the end of the year we we've we've not hit our target this month we hit our target last month like a huge huge ask but what we end up do be pull the load of work from november put it into october to hit our target the first week from november have no install there be nothing to install so it be trickle through pull through the rest of the month we get to the end of the month and we we now we're about eighty k short on the monthly revenue eighty k we're not gonna hit it
S0336	by tomorrow
S0337	it's fuck stupid
S0338	oh god
S0337	and because they keep put it forward so many things be fail because they're desperately try to get contractors to finish and desperately try to get us to finish and we're not get handovers from bt and it's it's shit and and i'm we do this thing call and they have this like once or twice a month and our directors basically like sit in a room together we we basically im or a kind of im forum and they answer question that get put through and i've ask before like be it a or a profitable process and i say cos the last time we go to all escalations we have no process and like ah well if we do the get the process right we want you to escalate it's not that the process isn't break you you escalate everything to get money in well we need this money who's gonna find me money today on the last day of the month our our head of department will walk around go who can get the most money in that's what you're talk about we're not we're not go out dig up roads out in the street not engineer go to site we can't facilitate this it's like there's like about three different departments that need to be involve
S0338	yeah
S0337	everything's and everything's an escalation oh we can get that in we get that in that's like bullshit we get we have this good to go list as well
S0338	it's a lot of talk the talk isn't it
S0337	yeah a lot
S0338	a lot of talk the talk
S0337	our head of department be an absolute idiot
S0336	i know far too i could probably go in and do his job i feel like i've listen to it that much
S0337	it's erm it's just so you don't shut off you don't shut off
S0338	sound like hard work
S0337	you you can
S0338	yeah
S0337	it's so shit
S0338	so to progress you need your degree do you
S0337	not at but yes to leave
S0336	i be say to him i saw a job at ours this week
S0338	yes
S0336	which which it probably

S0336	yeah i mean it be it be it be a digital project coordinator
S0338	mm mm
S0336	and it be for it be product test and administration for new digital platforms for our e learn so er well i mean they would rather obviously have someone who kind of have a passion for publish which obviously
S0338	mm
S0336	he doesn't necessarily have but it the project all the kind of task he'd be do aren't dissimilar to what he's do now erm but the salary be nearly ten grand more
S0338	wow
S0336	but it say degree essential and i think that's gonna be the case particularly with project coordination

S0338	mm
S0337	so chill
S0338	mm
S0337	he be overwork all his work basically get pass to she's new she's really overwork she live in she live in she's not very clever she's ex media she's not very clever she's she's a bite a bite weird but she's alright a bite loopy and proper like
S0336	she can't be after petrol cost
S0337	no it's but she can't be make any but yeah so she
S0338	she must be live at home
S0337	she yeah she's live with her parent
S0338	yeah
S0337	cos she's finish the
S0338	mm
S0337	so now live with her parent but yeah she's really overwork and you can tell she's just all over the place she's only be there for like a month two months no sorry i think some of them start in august apart from and there be inductions and all this and should have three months maybe bless her she need help all the time and we don't have time to help her then you've get who's cover for cos 's be on holiday for three weeks she's really stress
S0336	she should not have be allow to go on holiday for three weeks
S0337	she
S0338	three you're not allow three week holiday in company
S0337	she's go to australia so
S0336	three weeks though towards the end of the year when you've get a load of
S0337	yeah
S0336	new starters that's
S0337	erm
S0336	that should not have be agree
S0337	yeah so 's stress and then there's who take erm a a couple a couple of customers for all of us er but and and have no time he's he's he's and obviously my old boss basically
S0338	oh the one who have cancer
S0337	well his his his brother have cancer his brother die
S0338	do he
S0336	and then his mum get ill
S0337	and then his mum get really ill he drop he he end up leave just cos it wasn't worth it just he wasn't deal with the stress and he be get
S0338	mm
S0337	just a normal guy
S0336	i don't think they be be very erm understand
S0337	understand
S0336	of his personal situation either so he be kind of be urge to come back even though there be clearly a lot still go on at home
S0337	i know erm it turn out that
S0337	turn out
S0337	he be ex
S0338	yeah
S0337	so it seem to be a bite of a stopgap bite like when dad
S0336	yeah
S0337	golf club and it just wasn't worth it for him to come back so
S0338	yeah
S0337	he sign off
S0338	yeah
S0337	it's like if you don't if you don't let me take this time i won't come back
S0336	it's stupid though like i just i think you have to be a certain kind of person who enjoy that much stress especially for so little money like
S0338	yeah
S0336	normally the people that have that much stress in their role be like the sales people who have deadlines and stuff
S0338	yes
S0336	and they they
S0338	i have that
S0336	they reap the benefit of it
S0338	i have that
S0336	yeah
S0338	i have that and er it get us our house in
S0336	yeah
S0337	mm yeah yeah
S0338	but i i be pay for it and i get bonuses and everything and it be good money
S0336	yeah
S0338	in the early eighties early to mid eighties
S0336	well that's that's why
S0336	that's why 's do alright for himself
S0338	i have lot of fuel fuel in the car and everything
S0336	because never go to uni and everything and the only reason he's do alright be because he's in sales
S0338	yeah
S0337	yeah sales
S0336	but i think his basic be less than 's but
S0338	but it's not it's i be be er 's job secure do you think
S0336	i think so
S0337	it seem to be
S0336	it's a relatively small company
S0338	right
S0336	so obviously if anything
S0337	and he's in there
S0336	if anything ever
S0338	yeah
S0336	happen to the company obviously he'd be out but i think the company do it its it which i kind of feel be a bite of a failsafe with that kind of with sales
S0338	yes
S0336	and i think he do a lot of like client face stuff so he go to a lot of presentations meet
S0338	yes
S0336	that kind of stuff but i know his basic's about twenty three but
S0337	it's all commission
S0336	but but with his commission on top he's earn over thirty apparently so
S0338	yeah
S0336	and he er didn't go to uni or anything like that so it show it show that if you're a certain type of person my friend 's the same she's on about a similar amount of money just
S0337	doesn't have gcse in maths
S0336	doesn't have a gcse in maths
S0338	really
S0337	fail it about how many time
S0336	she's fail it three time
S0338	and yet she can do it
S0336	yeah
S0337	you know it's talk it's all talk
S0338	wow
S0336	if you've
S0337	she she's get the talk
S0336	if you've get the right attitude yeah she could sell she could sell anything i genuinely believe that like i've always say if i ever start a business she'd be the first person i hire she'd be a pain in my arse
S0338	but do she get repeat but do she get repeat business
S0336	yeah
S0338	do she
S0336	she really build like proper relationships with people
S0338	wow
S0336	the people she's get especially her in her magazines they're so random like if she couldn't build if she couldn't get repeat business then she'd be screw because it's such a small kind of
S0337	market
S0336	market yeah oh yeah she'd be the first person i hire
S0337	she can't she's dyslexic as well
S0336	oh yeah
