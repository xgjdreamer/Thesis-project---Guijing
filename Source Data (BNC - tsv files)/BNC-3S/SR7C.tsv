S0623	well glass be the last thing he's gonna need after his cataract operation to
S0525	yeah it should be make him better
S0622	mm
S0525	his drive however be never gonna get better
S0623	it's not about whether he can see it's about his awareness and unfortunately
S0525	have he actually be erm tell to stop by the dvla yet or a doctor or somebody yet or not or be he in that advisory six month period where it's up to him
S0622	he's in that advisory six months
S0525	when do that end
S0622	well it's open to debate but i i think he saw the consultant end of october the begin of november i think
S0525	so he's get till april
S0622	about that time so he's get till the end of
S0525	mm
S0622	april at the most i've say but erm
S0525	do he do any drive
S0622	no no no
S0623	well it's especially when he hasn't do any for six months
S0525	he won't want to go back to it
S0623	at this stage well you hope that he wouldn't want to but if he do he's gonna be even more of a danger because he's gonna be completely out of habit
S0622	he do pass the odd comment and
S0525	mm
S0622	when i'm back on the road type throwaway comment but
S0623	oh no
S0525	i don't think he mean it do he
S0622	half the time hopefully not i don't think he
S0623	well i know it sound a bite mean but you could just keep tell him that he's in his six month and he can't drive yet and he probably wouldn't compute that it hasn't be
S0525	yeah
S0622	yeah
S0623	but obviously
S0622	yeah
S0623	grandma you know grandma
S0525	grandma would then tell him

S0525	yeah yes i yeah
S0623	er so it wasn't yeah er they be they be just kind of erm
S0525	mm
S0623	almost hole in the wall that you poke your head through and er
S0525	mm
S0623	order something wasn't it so
S0525	look a bite nasty
S0622	mm
S0623	i mean
S0525	it's the sort of
S0623	er you know
S0525	thing though that he be use to eat er
S0623	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	in shanghai that's what they do all the time
S0623	yeah
S0525	when they be in china
S0623	yeah yeah
S0525	cos there's little
S0623	well
S0525	tiny place
S0623	when they be live in their flat they use to just bring back cheap pasta and
S0525	yeah
S0623	cook it didn't they
S0525	yeah
S0623	but so that would've be a bite different to
S0525	i know when i be there with and she be eat all the street food
S0623	yeah well she yeah
S0525	obviously she she's use to it
S0623	yeah
S0525	and she's grow up with it but she even say to me some of this stuff really be horrible and it smelt foul but
S0623	yeah
S0525	i didn't touch it because i'd not have any of my jab then
S0623	oh yeah
S0525	i think i'm not gonna risk pick anything up on these erm
S0623	no no no certainly not
S0525	yet like i say sometimes they're the best place to eat and some of the nicer restaurants that look nice
S0525	be the ones with the dirty kitchens so it be very difficult to tell
S0623	mm
S0525	you do take pot luck really i mean we just stay in the hotels when we go don't we so
S0623	yeah
S0525	but you wouldn't be stop in this one for long i don't think
S0623	no
S0525	what you look at
S0623	be a bite lazy
S0525	yeah well he's er he's happy he's on his look at him look he's really
S0525	almost
S0623	yeah
S0525	almost start to crawl there you're gonna move along aren't you you're do well
S0622	he want to move
S0525	too much trouble
S0622	he just can't
S0525	get me off this roll mum
S0622	won't be long
S0622	mm
S0525	so what's on the agenda for your erm year seven pupil tonight then
S0623	erm we be do
S0622	maths
S0623	just faceplants the floor
S0525	mm
S0623	yeah we're do some maths of course but erm it's multiply and divide by ten a hundred and a thousand about move the digits leave or right
S0525	yeah
S0623	yeah and then we're use that to then multiply by multiples of ten a hundred and a thousand so do like erm
S0622	both ways
S0623	well if you do i dunno che che che che che twelve time a hundred get your twelve and you move it two to the leave so you get twelve hundred but if you do if you wanna do twelve time five hundred you do twelve time five first and then you use the rule to move it two point to the
S0525	add your noughts on
S0623	no you don't add your noughts on
S0525	oh that's what i do well i i just you just count up the number of noughts five hundred
S0623	yeah you do
S0525	what do you say
S0623	cos that's the way yeah that's the way we be teach
S0525	just count up the number of noughts and put those noughts on but er yeah you just the the teach methods
S0623	okay one one point two then time one hundred one point two zero zero
S0525	one no
S0623	no
S0525	cos you you have to
S0525	you don't oh er
S0623	you're add a nought on
S0525	no you
S0623	add a naught on aren't i
S0525	no you
S0623	aren't i
S0525	you you you move the point then
S0623	no you move the point two don't you so it's a hundred and twenty
S0525	yeah you move the point
S0623	really
S0525	yeah yeah
S0622	we always use to just move the point leave or right
S0623	yeah yeah
S0622	then we just
S0622	because there's always after the point there's nought so if and you don't add them they're always there
S0623	yeah but if you if you use the rule if
S0622	so twelve be twelve point nought nought nought nought nought nought nought nought nought nought nought
S0623	yeah yeah yeah but if you use the rule if you time by a hundred you add two noughts on the end then if you time the number one point two by one hundred you'd say oh well it's one point two
S0525	nought nought which be isn't
S0623	which isn't cos that's the same number
S0525	so be just tell me that i've get it all wrong
S0622	mm
S0525	but obviously i know that
S0623	yes obviously the yes
S0525	yeah
S0623	the rule be you move yeah move the point or but we've get a erm a printer out like a
S0525	be you listen to this
S0623	a grid that's get
S0622	yeah
S0623	hundred thousand erm ten thousand thousand hundred tens you can't call them units any more you call them ones point tenths hundredth thousandths and so then you've get digit card so she make a number and then you time it by a thousand so each digit move three place to the leave and then obviously if you've get any space before your point still then you've gotta
S0622	yes
S0525	do that
S0623	fill them with noughts zero
S0622	yeah
S0623	place value holders mm
S0622	mm
S0525	mm do anybody want a drink i'm just gonna get some water
S0622	i think
S0623	i don't think so
S0622	i need to go to in a minute
S0525	in a well
S0622	drop my stuff off
S0525	you can wait a few more minutes yet before you go
S0623	a few more minutes
S0525	i'll put this in the bin
S0623	what be you drop off at
S0622	last week's return paperwork job sheet all that sort of thing
S0623	oh how many do you
S0622	timesheet
S0623	sign up last week
S0622	er nine
S0623	for the lottery nine what's the what's the quota for the week what do you have to fill
S0622	oh it's usually about fourteen
S0623	oh okay
S0622	but that doesn't really seem to be set in stone cos
S0623	really
S0622	it depend whether you where you go of course erm
S0623	uhu
S0622	but that's the er for a part timer like me that's the well
S0623	be there any decent workers at the moment that be get
S0622	well we this new lady we take on be last year she she's leave now so they me and three of us up there
S0623	oh really ah
S0622	but they don't seem to want to do anything about the lack of sellers or the lack of number or the lack of
S0623	but be there only the three of you that do it that's it
S0622	well there be the five of us that do it
S0623	oh
S0622	but erm oh well there's about never seem to sort of er monitor how we're do cos we're lose more people than we're start cos they people cancel after a period
S0623	oh the yeah
S0622	you know they don't renew or
S0623	yeah
S0622	they go and join another charity or whatever
S0623	mm
S0622	er but nobody seem to be concern about that or
S0525	well you have agency staff in didn't you
S0622	we do yeah
S0525	but it didn't work out
S0622	well try them
S0525	didn't you
S0622	briefly yeah

S0525	do the form turn up eventually or not
S0622	i think they might have do actually yeah yeah
S0525	mm
S0622	but we kitted out them out with all their
S0525	do you
S0623	and then just
S0622	and then they
S0623	do a week and
S0623	it be all a bite of a disaster i'm afraid
S0525	mm

S0525	you look at the little red bird he's your favourite isn't he
S0623	yeah we like him
S0525	mm
S0622	you do something on thursday
S0623	erm we'll just go
S0622	or
S0623	yeah we're just go with erm and her little girl
S0622	okay
S0623	i think they're the only ones out of the four of us who well us and them do swim
S0622	right
S0623	the other ones
S0525	be it a general session everyday in the baby pool
S0623	yeah they have erm school go and er i think they have a yeah special under eights and adults in the baby pool at
S0525	yeah
S0623	some point so we'll just go for when i'll give them a ring and ask them what time be the best best to go i think that's the best way of do it
S0525	and what do it cost now a session
S0623	he's free under fours
S0525	yeah
S0623	and er i'm four pound i think
S0525	do you get a timeslot for that or just gonna go as long as you like
S0623	you go as long as you like
S0622	as long as you can survive or last for
S0623	yes
S0623	which in this case be about twenty minutes
S0622	right yes
S0525	have they still get all the big erm seat area in the big pool
S0623	yeah yeah
S0525	use to be a good place to watch
S0623	it seem a bite well yeah it seem a bite pointless now because they've shorten the yeah the pool instead go lengthways by the dive board
S0622	yeah
S0623	so that's the long bite now that you swim up and down and they've get the lanes there and then so that's an oblong shape and then you've get they've like build a i don't know like a not a bridge because it go through the pool but it you know like a walkway across and then they've make the other pool like a kind of square shape there so it's not bear in mind the seat be like the whole way across there which be ideal when you swim in that pool
S0525	yeah
S0623	go down along the seat
S0525	well yeah
S0623	but now it's now it's that way so i don't know why they've do it like that but
S0622	so there's no dive area now
S0623	not at the moment cos they're refurbing the dive board but they're normally you know there be
S0622	it's still deep enough to
S0623	well yeah that whole pool there be deep
S0622	still deep yeah
S0623	because that's the deep that be the deep end of the
S0622	it be yeah
S0623	long pool wasn't it so all that pool's deep now so they just use it for swim which i think well if you have like if you think of 's swim club and you do like swim club with those you know age children erm i dunno what what be we when we start ten
S0525	what swim lessons
S0623	yeah but
S0622	go down
S0623	if you have no you have galas there
S0525	oh yeah you be older when you start the galas but you
S0623	yeah
S0525	your swim lessons you be only about five weren't you
S0623	yeah yeah but i mean if you have so when you start swim in galas
S0525	yeah
S0623	and you do lengths or you join a swim club like swim club you you rest for some of it cos if you're do lengths for an hour
S0525	yeah
S0623	but they've get nowhere to rest in that pool cos it's all deep
S0622	oh
S0623	so it doesn't really make
S0525	mm
S0623	a lot of sense
S0622	so what do they do on the leave hand side then
S0623	i dunno
S0622	cos i suppose what it do it use the part the dive bite area which wasn't perhaps use as much before
S0623	yeah
S0622	so they can get other people in the leave hand side possibly have other class or
S0623	yeah
S0622	and then obviously get you go in the baby pool presumably still that's what you do
S0623	yeah because that's the only well that's the only one that's warm enough for him
S0622	yeah
S0525	be never include in erm any of your swim galas then be in a different area
S0623	i don't know
S0525	cos you we never go there do we like we go to and you go further afield but you never do erm
S0623	hello
S0525	look at laugh
S0623	hello
S0525	but you never do
S0525	do you and that would have be a nice one to a nice place to go and watch
S0623	yeah cos yeah it's get a nice seat yeah
S0525	you be never up against be you so there's never
S0623	no all i can remember be all erm
S0622	didn't seem to be in the region do it or
S0525	but they do i'm sure cos i remember say that's
S0623	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0525	who he use to swim for
S0623	and and
S0525	must have a club er i presume
S0623	yeah
S0622	yeah they do
S0525	oh i don't know
S0622	have they'd have then i think they do
S0623	i dunno
S0525	so you think it the club might have be call not
S0525	could have be
S0622	yeah
S0525	i dunno
S0622	well if you think well you see be er
S0623	yeah
S0622	all those sort of place
S0525	yeah
S0623	and so
S0623	yeah and that would be
S0623	no we go quite far afield like erm what be the one the other side of
S0525	you use to go up to in
S0623	yeah that be one as well yeah
S0525	at
S0622	that's still though there
S0623	mm that doesn't make a lot of sense but
S0622	whereas be all way and
S0623	oh you don't wanna be down there
S0525	no doesn't do you
S0623	you don't wanna be down there
S0622	thank you

S0525	honestly we're buy you your milk your mummy her printer ink you ought to go and work for you can even
S0622	well i don't mind i mean
S0525	well well no you should but you dunno which job he's talk about if he's talk about the current one or or an upcoming one
S0622	to be fair he do say scottish job
S0525	well it yeah so
S0622	the scottish job
S0525	well i well
S0622	er but he didn't talk venues er we didn't talk any of those just just
S0622	he say have i have i ask you yet yeah i say no but
S0525	they're have be
S0623	you know i'm always
S0525	right the yeah it's the well and they're have the pipe it's be delay
S0525	by six weeks do he mention that
S0622	no
S0525	right i think that's the one he's talk about it should have all come in in january and i think it's come in march now
S0622	right
S0525	erm but they're have it
S0622	oh he do say they they be on er they be er on the sea as we speak so i so that be yeah
S0525	oh unless it's come right okay
S0622	yeah
S0525	i mean however long it take i can't remember
S0622	on in transit yeah
S0525	yes well it's definitely the one in aberdeen then or be it aberdeen or or be it
S0622	aberdeen haven't be there
S0525	well it's somewhere he's get them because i remember
S0525	i ask
S0623	what's he like
S0525	i ask which dock they be be unload at
S0622	if he's still there
S0525	because we've use erm certain hauliers at certain dock and use their vat deferment account cos want to get the vat defer er so yeah it's definitely gonna be in scotland so you're gonna have to go up and he'll fly you up
S0623	be
S0622	yeah
S0525	or well be it worth it because then you won't have your car unless you get a hire car mm
S0622	but i'll see he he probably won't come back will he
S0525	well he no he but if you push him on it he will just say listen you know we could do with a bite of cash at the moment what be you offer it you you you somebody's gotta do it and they haven't get the manpower
S0622	that's right
S0525	and he'd rather have you do it but do you want to do it cos i it you'll be probably commit to a and in fact how be you gonna fit your job around it cos you'd be commit to it probably eight weeks ten weeks
S0622	i don't know i i don't know
S0525	unless he split it with somebody else and you just do er the odd week and he go up or somebody else do it i don't know
S0622	right yeah yeah
S0525	cos this be always the problem when he get rid of everybody when we get a job on we do you know we'd send
S0622	like yeah
S0622	yeah
S0525	they do this type of thing
S0622	sure
S0525	yeah
S0623	well surely he's aware that

S0525	oh we'll see we'll see shall we how many more of those have you print off
S0623	erm so i've do fifteen there's two a page so a hundred
S0525	so where be these destine for
S0623	well i think by where you use to live
S0525	oh yeah i think that's a good idea
S0623	up there i think
S0525	yeah
S0623	that's my next
S0525	yeah i
S0623	my next target area
S0525	i be gonna text actually and just give her an update
S0623	yeah
S0525	and say it be a good idea and that you've you've get a few pupils now start it off i think it'll just take a bite of time cos it i think you be lucky to get those two
S0623	yeah yeah
S0525	so quickly
S0623	oh definitely yeah
S0525	and all it take now be word of mouth and all of a sudden you'll be
S0623	well this be the problem
S0525	you'll have too many wait
S0623	because i've get those two quickly
S0525	yeah you be
S0623	i be like oh well when i go out and give my other leaflets i be bite
S0525	disappoint
S0623	oh i need to get
S0525	mm
S0623	yeah cos er that's what i if i can just get because i'm i'm obviously conscious about go when i go back to work i'm not gonna be able to keep them all up so
S0525	no
S0623	i can get a few that and quite you know it's quite possible that some of them will only want them till the end of this school year so
S0525	yeah but if you go back to work three full days would would you spend your other two days do the tutor on the even
S0623	oh it depend with him and
S0525	because if you're do the full day at school you won't get a chance to tutor then will you
S0623	no no i wouldn't do it after school
S0525	so yeah
S0623	well then you know i'm i might
S0525	see
S0623	start on a saturday or
S0525	yeah
S0623	something
S0525	yeah
S0623	it depend how much you know money and
S0525	how much it's worth it
S0623	if it's worth it and
S0525	absolutely yeah
S0623	so i'll have a think
S0525	yeah
S0623	i mean it be possible it might be the thing be if i be to do it after work on those days
S0525	yeah
S0623	because especially if we have him one full day in nursery
S0525	yeah
S0623	that would allow me to do it erm but then you know they would have to be over in because i wouldn't
S0525	yeah
S0623	come back and then
S0525	no that's true yeah
S0623	so you know it would be different and i'd have to start again over in so it's probably
S0525	we can't leave you in nursery for longer than necessary can we no you want to be out don't you although i'll bet you'll have a lovely time
S0623	mm
S0525	if you like your mummy she do love to socialise she do she be a very happy play with all the other children mm we'll have to see won't we
S0623	time right i've gotta leave in about
S0525	you've get a few minutes
S0623	ten minutes or so
S0525	okay well 's not gonna need feed again now be he cos he only have it at quarter to three so we'll just see
S0623	i hope not
S0525	we'll just see won't we whether you
S0623	it depend cos well he go from quarter to eleven till i suppose well it's four hours isn't it
S0525	we're not sure will you let us know when you want feed again eh
S0623	yeah
S0525	will you let us know poppet eh you will won't you you'll let us know you will fish pie tonight

S0525	and when i saw the price of it i think this be stupid i've get to do it properly cos it's ridiculous
S0623	oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0525	to just keep have it and then fall apart in the even
S0623	mm
S0525	that's no good
S0525	it's no good be it
S0623	no
S0525	no we wish we be baby again and all we have to do be put weight on cos that be the easy bite

S0623	it's early this year yeah
S0525	well either just before or just after easter
S0623	yeah
S0525	and then we'll have to decide erm well in fact who would you invite to that
S0623	i wouldn't go mad
S0525	no good
S0525	you wouldn't invite uncle would you
S0623	no
S0525	no i wouldn't
S0623	no
S0525	bother cos he's not really anything to cos he do live i don't think have nothing to do with him
S0623	no no
S0525	i mean obviously and that be different cos we see them all the time
S0623	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	erm
S0623	so close family on both side so
S0525	yeah
S0623	grandparents and parent siblings grandparents aunties uncles who
S0525	you see the the
S0623	we see
S0525	the difficulty be your auntie would be gutted if she didn't get an invite

S0525	they'll want to come
S0623	make an effort and she's come up and see him so
S0525	but i wouldn't i wouldn't wanna invite
S0623	well no
S0525	and i don't think you should have to i just wouldn't bother
S0623	no no no
S0525	because i'm think that afterwards i mean we'll probably come back for food and that won't we so
S0525	either
S0623	yeah
S0525	well either we rent somewhere like the conservatory at 's
S0623	yeah well it's not open until april so gotta
S0525	right
S0623	bear that in mind
S0525	but it's gonna cost or we come back here

S0525	but we have to work out how many people we're cater for and
S0623	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	erm
S0623	erm
S0525	it's always a lot it would be nicer to have a little venue actually

S0525	well she can kick up a fuss it's not her choice

S0525	erm and i don't think you should well it's not up to me either but i don't think it's a problem that you don't
S0623	no erm
S0525	i be think about would have any of his friends he's not fuss about or people like that be he
S0623	er probably not cos he's
S0525	or he probably would
S0623	he
S0623	ask about him and he
S0525	see already look how many be we up to
S0623	well he ask about

S0623	he ask about and well more than 's sister do
S0525	oh oh god yeah her to invite

S0623	well the problem no the thing be 's family would only be his sister her boyfriend his mum and dad
S0525	yeah
S0623	and it would be and and so there would be eleven of them
S0525	right
S0623	and that that's it i mean the we
S0525	see our
S0623	i i would draw the line
S0525	christen party be about eleven in total

S0525	right yeah
S0623	it would be who we invite and
S0525	okay
S0623	but i think we would have to
