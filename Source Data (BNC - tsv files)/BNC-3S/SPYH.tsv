S0580	somewhere up there
S0579	i i know they ask if they could bring them down i say yeah if they want to bring them down it doesn't make any difference to me cos i mean the well could
S0580	but you'd have to fence them in of course so
S0579	i suppose they have to fence them in
S0580	but you've get the field above there haven't you
S0579	yeah we have yeah
S0580	yeah
S0579	yeah
S0580	which be fence in
S0579	yeah
S0580	so what have you two be do this afternoon
S0454	oh we've be busy haven't we
S0579	yeah we've have lot to do
S0580	have you be out have you be chat
S0454	i've be out in the garden
S0579	yeah we have
S0454	have a walk round
S0580	yeah
S0579	we have our even meal at the on the way down
S0454	yeah
S0580	oh right okay so you don't need to go out tonight then
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah anyway
S0454	grandpa and i have take part in a psychological experiment for
S0579	oh yes
S0454	eh er university
S0580	do he pass
S0454	well we don't know
S0580	oh
S0454	we're not allow to know the result
S0580	oh okay
S0454	that's a bite of a problem
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes i'm involve in this experiment erm for a new form of cbt treatment they're trialling
S0580	right
S0454	some programme on a phone they put lend me a smartphone for the weekend we have to for the week actually have to programme in five or they program in five activities you want to enjoy over the week it can be anything you want but it have to be alone and it's not allow to be watch tv or sleep
S0580	right
S0454	or get drink anything other than that be fine so they make you list them they do that yesterday with me i then put in a time that you want to do it and then it beep at you and tell you when to go and do it and five like fifteen minutes before tell you go and get your boot or whatever er and then it ask you how happy you be and then afterwards you go and do the activity
S0580	okay
S0454	and then it ask you again how you feel cos they're say er you're anticipation of events be a large part of enjoy them so the more specific you be about schedule events you're go to enjoy by yourself and this be key then the more likely you be to be happy overall and most of us be very bad at that we schedule appointments like the doctor we schedule go to work schedule meet other people like meet you today we have a time we're very bad at schedule time by ourselves where we're go to do something we enjoy
S0580	that's probably true yeah
S0454	and well it's probably true for everybody and for people who be depress that be a key part of it the more you anticipate it the
S0580	yeah
S0454	just the the very anticipation be part of it so it's not just
S0579	yeah
S0454	alright i think i'll go and take a walk now it's actually the build up it's quite interest
S0580	yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	mm
S0454	and then they're look at erm how we perceive the event while we're do it so if you're a happy person if you're reasonably satisfy then you just go and do the event and you'll probably enjoy it that's call savour but for someone who's depress they will have what they call dampen effect which mean they'll go and they'll do their walk but the whole time they'll feel guilty that they should be do something else or they'll think this be too good to last so they'll have all these negative thoughts while they're do it which of course by default mean you
S0580	experience yeah
S0454	yes you've ruin the whole experience anyway so the yeah part of prompt be it tell you you're mean to be feel erm not feel happy but they say to try and avoid these negative thoughts just stop it cbt so they do that before you do the activity to remind you but then during it they don't do it cos that might be annoy sort of beep at you the whole time yes it's quite interest so i've get these five
S0580	yeah
S0454	activities in a week but they say if they do it
S0579	yeah why not yeah
S0454	on an actual programme it would take place over six weeks for example and then you'd see a doctor and you would look at before and after they're quite interest
S0580	yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah yes and they pay me
S0579	oh ho that's the most important part
S0454	which be the other good thing yes
S0579	yes
S0580	do you pay dad for take part in
S0454	oh no i have to leave you didn't i i have to be alone
S0579	oh yeah there we be you know
S0454	yes not allow to talk to people in it you have to go off and do it
S0580	right
S0579	oh no
S0454	yeah but it's quite good actually
S0579	it be quite good
S0454	it's true that i don't schedule time where i'm go to do something alone you always schedule it with other people don't you
S0580	yes yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	which be interest yeah so then
S0454	just make me think of five activities i be go to do in a week
S0579	yeah
S0454	and actually put them in my diary
S0579	yeah
S0454	it's quite good i think oh do that
S0580	even an activity like read a book or
S0454	yeah they say anything at all so i've schedule stroll around the garden as an event today take a bubble bath tomorrow even
S0579	talk to myself
S0454	talk to myself
S0454	yeah that's a good activity
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	get in an argument cycle yeah just lot of little things like that
S0579	yeah
S0454	actually it be quite nice just to think of it cook one even
S0580	yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah cook something you want yeah it be quite nice just a little activity yeah and they be right there think oh i'm go to go and do this now
S0580	yeah
S0454	in itself a nice event
S0579	be you still bike now then
S0580	yes
S0454	yes still cycle
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	yeah i've get dad's bike at the moment
S0579	oh yeah she cycle all the way from plymouth
S0580	i know
S0454	yes with brake that didn't work
S0454	that's not so good
S0580	most impress
S0579	go down the hill there yeah
S0454	yes well it's up hill nearly all the way isn't it from about
S0579	it oh well yeah that's right
S0454	almost all the way to it's straight uphill
S0579	yeah yeah very
S0454	and then it's after that
S0579	tire work yeah
S0454	downhill
S0579	yeah
S0454	but the downhill be the problem because the brake didn't work
S0579	oh well brake just put your foot on the tyres yeah
S0454	yes but i get here
S0454	dad's one
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	borrow cos he's get a fold up one
S0579	oh one of those have he yeah
S0454	yeah so they're quite good if you be take the train erm
S0579	yeah
S0454	cos a lot of train they're quite good but some of them have rule about when you can or can't take the bike but
S0579	yeah do do have them no he doesn't have bike fold away bike do he he have other things fold away doesn't he in the car
S0580	yeah cos can't walk any more so he's get his erm mobility car in the back of his car
S0579	yeah oh yes he he just slide it out doesn't he yeah
S0580	yeah there's this new invention
S0454	ah
S0580	i don't suppose you've catch up with it erm be very immobile now sadly
S0454	mm
S0580	so he have er an adapt polo so he can drive
S0454	right
S0580	but there's a new invention of put in the back a mobility cart so you can get out of your car when you arrive wherever you want to go and because in the past he couldn't manhandle anything this be a new device and you just press a button
S0579	and out it come yes
S0454	ah
S0580	his car just slide down and he he
S0454	wow
S0580	if he can manage to get in it cos he's get his stick and then go back you just line it up which he can do press another button and it go back up
S0579	yeah
S0580	hugely expensive but
S0454	mm
S0580	it's a lifeline for him
S0454	mm
S0579	yeah he
S0454	that be good
S0579	make a lot better drive around doesn't it
S0580	yes i mean
S0579	yeah
S0580	it's a wonderful invention
S0579	yeah
S0454	that be great mm
S0580	yeah
S0579	he probably go over to the seaside every other day doesn't he
S0580	yes well obviously
S0454	that's nice
S0579	in the summertime anyhow yeah
S0580	he have to get out you see
S0579	yeah
S0580	you can't stay at home all day so
S0454	no
S0579	yeah what well he very rarely so wasn't
S0454	mm it's good
S0580	he manage but he get exhaust
S0579	yeah oh yes that be about two hours i think he have to have a rest
S0454	mm
S0580	and sleep doesn't he for hours
S0579	yes sleep that's right a couple of hours
S0580	and he's also get erm sleep apnoea
S0454	oh right
S0580	so he have to sleep with this mask
S0454	with a mask
S0580	thing on as well so all in all
S0454	mm
S0579	yeah i'd forget about that mask do he cover it over his face do he
S0580	yeah
S0579	oh right i'd forget that one yeah
S0454	mm
S0580	so life's a bite tough for him but he keep him go
S0454	yeah
S0579	well he get on well with doesn't he when 's over here
S0580	yeah they do
S0579	those two get on well together i think yeah
S0454	mm
S0579	what's fifty three now
S0454	yeah he's quite young isn't he
S0580	yeah don't know how old he be be he five years younger than me probably yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah must be about five
S0580	yeah
S0454	mm
S0579	yeah
S0454	hm i can't wait
S0579	he get about quite a lot though cos he little polo car drive around in doesn't he
S0580	yeah he do well
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah it's good
S0580	yeah
S0454	i can't wait for those driverless cars to be legalise here those google cars
S0579	oh that sound rather nice
S0580	yes i've be read about those
S0454	amaze oh i can't wait for them they've be trialling them in california for years now haven't they
S0580	yeah
S0454	go on and on but the problem in the uk be the legislation apparently like if you hit someone in a driverless car who be legally responsible the non driver who's sit in the car or the company who make the car
S0580	right
S0454	so until they sort that out it won't be legalise
S0579	yeah when you say it's a you say someone sit in the car but not a driver be that what happen
S0454	yes so at the moment they they've get cars where you don't need a driver but in california by law you have to have a driver anyway
S0579	yeah
S0454	sit in the driver's seat ready to take over
S0580	but not do anything yeah
S0454	but not do anything which defeat the point of the object yeah
S0580	driverless car
S0454	yes
S0454	stupid
S0579	well we haven't get any of those in the uk have we
S0454	no because of the legal situation
S0454	they can't decide who's legally responsible
S0579	oh
S0454	if the car hit something
S0579	oh yeah
S0580	so who's legally responsible in the state then
S0454	don't know
S0580	how do they work it
S0454	don't know how they i imagine google will pick up the bill cos they're it's still in trials cos they haven't
S0580	right
S0454	release these to the public yet
S0580	okay
S0454	they're still in these endless trials
S0579	oh yes
S0454	but they seem a bite more advance there but you just think oh
S0580	they're come dad
S0454	they're come i can't wait
S0580	yeah they're come
S0454	but it will cost industries money because if no one crash insurance go out the window
S0580	no of course it do yeah
S0454	so someone be gonna lose a lot of money and
S0580	yeah
S0454	mechanics will lose money people make money off dent don't they scratch
S0580	yeah
S0579	how do you have a driverless car then
S0454	so then what they be do because it somehow i don't know how it detect how far away the car in front be and then if that break it know to break so they never hit so actually in the they've be test it about three years it's never crash into anything but other things have crash into it
S0579	yeah
S0454	so it can't stop anyone go into the back of you for example so there will still be accidents
S0579	but then isn't another driver in the seat
S0454	yes at the moment
S0579	yeah
S0454	legally there have to be someone sit there but they're not drive
S0579	oh
S0454	the car drive itself but if they need to they could take over a bite like er aeroplanes
S0579	oh i see yeah
S0454	they're all on autopilot aren't they
S0579	yeah
S0454	but they still have to have a pilot there
S0579	a pilot there yeah in case
S0454	just in case
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes but no one actually fly plan or drive train that's the funny thing plan and train everybody
S0580	they drive themselves
S0454	accept that you have the driver there but they don't do anything nobody's question that
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	even though they've get five hundred people in a plane nobody question the fact that it's on autopilot for the vast majority of that flight but cars we're all like oh oh well this be something new
S0580	they're paranoid about that
S0454	oh yes oh we can't have that and even in london those erm with which one the the docklands light railway that's driverless isn't it
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	the dubai metro's driverless
S0580	yeah
S0454	and we're all like fine about that in fact the dubai one doesn't even have a driver it be actually driverless there's no one there
S0579	yes
S0454	we're all fine and they've never crash
S0579	have to get a driverless car
S0580	no
S0579	that'll be nice won't it sit in the back and
S0454	well i'd love it
S0579	read the paper and
S0454	i think it'd be excellent
S0579	yeah
S0580	i can just see a driverless car take that route though into along where it's go
S0579	go in and out
S0454	it'd be quite scary because
S0580	yes
S0454	they'd be a lot closer because they'd be cos it would know exactly how many millimetres to leave so initially it'll be terrify
S0580	quite frighten yeah
S0454	because it'll be really really close
S0580	yeah
S0454	and you'll think it's go to hit cos they can actually drive about fifty centimetres apart because they know whereas we have to leave you know a couple of car lengths
S0580	yeah
S0454	cos we're too slow aren't we we'd have to be sure we could stop er
S0579	what happen on crossroads
S0454	yes well apparently they've program it so it's very very cautious
S0579	i see yeah
S0454	but they find out that actually cause other people to go into the back
S0580	yeah
S0454	because say the light be amber
S0579	oh yes
S0454	most drivers will speed up to get through the light but this car's be program to stop so then people go into the back of it cos they're expect the car in front to go through the light so actually
S0579	mm
S0454	yes they've have to programme it to be more dangerous now to take more risk
S0579	yeah
S0454	not to crash but if it's amber for example
S0580	yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	it should be program to speed up cos that's what other drivers do
S0579	have you ever see a car on the road then like that
S0454	no i want to i'm i'm excite by it
S0579	i haven't see one
S0580	yeah
S0579	i mean take another hundred years before they get to so
S0580	yeah well you never know dad
S0579	cars like that
S0454	yes
S0579	yes
S0580	and i mean it's be come for years and consider
S0454	i know yeah
S0580	drivers you know a normal car can do things on its own now
S0454	yes
S0580	like our car can park itself
S0454	oh that's wonderful
S0579	yeah
S0580	i won't do it cos it frighten the life out of me to relinquish control over my car as it reverse into a space
S0454	hm
S0580	i won't do it but it can do
S0580	and so i mean it's be come over the years
S0454	yeah
S0579	but not all
S0579	not all cars have that sort of thing
S0454	not yet but it will come
S0580	but it i be just say it's be come because cars more and more
S0454	yeah
S0580	can do things for themselves
S0579	before yeah yeah
S0454	yeah
S0579	okay so come to the backdoor one day then for me
S0580	but
S0454	it'd be nice wouldn't it
S0580	yeah
S0579	the the horn say we're ready for off and
S0580	yes it'd take you into
S0579	and he's off oh well that sound rather good
S0580	it'd be interest to see but i would not like to be sit i couldn't i don't think i could do it sit in a driverless car
S0579	yeah well yeah
S0454	but then you sit in a plane where you have no control and it's on autopilot
S0579	yeah
S0454	do it do you worry about it
S0580	no
S0454	but be that just because you can't see it do you think
S0580	yes
S0454	it's the fact that you can't see it that allow you to relax
S0579	yes yeah
S0580	the fact that yeah you're physically on the road and you can see all this go on around you
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0580	and to trust your car to make the right judgements while you're just sit there
S0454	but don't you think that's the same as be a passenger in a lot of ways
S0579	yeah
S0454	that you don't have a whole lot of control particularly if you be sit in the back seat i mean what be i go to do if i think you're drive dangerously it'll be too late you'll have crash
S0579	yeah well they they don't
S0580	i i just think we look at it differently though on like a train or plane
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	you just
S0580	the train be just okay it might be sort of thing come the other way
S0454	well it's a straight line as well
S0579	yeah
S0580	up in the sky you don't know what's go on
S0454	no
S0580	you can't see anything else that's the thing
S0454	that's true yes
S0580	but i think it's what you can see when you're sit there that frighten you have control
S0454	mm
S0579	yeah but when you think about aeroplanes of course and they're fly up thirty thousand feet you think well there's no problem like on the roads be there there's no one there's no one up there to hit like
S0454	no
S0580	no
S0454	except when you get to an airport then it must be pretty terrify
S0579	well an airport yeah that's yeah
S0580	but yet they say plan pass each other very close in the sky
S0454	yes
S0579	oh yeah
S0580	you can't see the next plane
S0579	no no
S0580	but to a pilot
S0579	yes
S0580	he know where they be
S0454	and they're fast as well that's the other thing you forget
S0579	yeah they be yeah
S0580	yes yeah
S0454	that they're go incredibly fast so if someone get that wrong
S0580	yeah
S0579	yeah they yeah
S0454	i mean pretty bad
S0580	yep
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah
S0580	i mean you read occasionally about pilot have to take evasive action don't you because something's come too close
S0454	yes but that's all automatic now apparently
S0579	yeah
S0454	they have box in each plane i forget what they're call and actually it's no longer the pilot that do it because there be too many errors if they have to decide to go up or down to avoid the plane what if they both decide to go up
S0580	yes
S0454	like that doesn't work so now
S0580	yeah
S0454	they've get one box talk to the other and they can decide instantaneously
S0579	mm
S0454	we're go down we're go up whereas people take too long
S0580	they're
S0579	yeah
S0454	scary again though
S0580	yeah
S0579	well it's all change
S0454	yes
S0579	in my day we fly an aeroplane swing the propeller round to start it
S0579	nothing inside the aeroplane
S0580	yeah
S0579	to press any button
S0454	yeah
S0579	usually they have a guy outside the one of the chap work on the airport he'd come over hold it and swing it and step back to get his head knock off
S0580	hope he get stick back in time
S0579	in time
S0454	yeah

S0580	yeah
S0454	very traditional
S0579	yeah
S0580	yeah
S0454	but it's very fashionable now
S0580	because i have an elderly friend in she's about ninety now and she make elderflower wine
S0580	yes
S0454	mm i don't know about the wine it be the cordial i like
S0580	right
S0454	so just so it's like a you know like squash just water it down non alcoholic
S0579	yeah
S0454	but you need to buy citric acid to make it
S0579	yeah
S0454	which you can't get everywhere i think you have to go to the chemist to buy it online
S0580	oh okay mm
S0579	i think your mum use to like sparkle wine didn't she
S0580	she do
S0454	ah yes that's nice
S0580	so what be what's the difference then between the cordial and the wine if it's make with elderflower
S0454	yeast i suppose to make it ferment you'd need to add yeast
S0580	right but be it very it's not very alcoholic though be it
S0454	elderflower cordial
S0580	no the wine
S0454	oh the wine i don't know
S0580	cos when she give it to me she say it wasn't at all so
S0454	i haven't have any actually
S0454	i've never have elderflower wine
S0580	it's
S0454	yeah i think those homemade win

S0454	tiny bite
S0579	yeah
S0454	cos it put her off for life she doesn't drink at all
S0579	yeah
S0454	but that's why and i didn't drink much at all but that's again that's why i think it all taste like that

S0580	well when we live in york
S0579	i think you do yeah
S0580	that be useful cos it be so near
S0579	oh
S0580	and it's one of those twenty four hour like mega ones
S0579	oh okay
S0454	mm
S0580	but no i don't really like these great big supermarkets but there we be
S0579	they're useful i suppose
S0580	useful
S0579	yes yeah yeah
S0454	this be another of my honeymoon things the supermarkets here
S0579	yes
S0454	be so good compare to abroad
S0580	they be
S0454	there be no comparison
S0580	yeah
S0454	because it's a one it's just one stop you can buy stamp
S0579	exactly everything yeah
S0454	you can get your photos develop you've get a pharmacy with a pharmacist
S0580	yeah
S0454	you can do all these things in supermarkets
S0580	yeah
S0579	of course yeah yeah
S0454	i'm just amaze
S0579	yeah
S0454	i can even get my car clean inside and out while i'm do my shop just amaze and then
S0579	yeah
S0454	they've get this new thing scan as you go have you see that
S0580	yeah what's that word
S0454	amaze oh i've just discover this so you scan your club card when you go in and it give you this machine which be what the checkout woman have
S0580	yeah
S0454	so you take your bag in cos you know you have to take your own bag now so you scan as you go and you put it in your shop bag and then when you it's the end instead of have to take it out and put it all on the conveyor belt one by one
S0580	one by one
S0579	yeah
S0454	you don't you just pay
S0579	well what's to stop you put in something and not scan it
S0454	nothing er except they do random check but i've be i they check the first one to check you do it right but they don't check everything they just check like three items to check you didn't steal those three items and after that it's random that you don't know when it's go to be so it's suppose to be
S0580	so you could get stop
S0454	you could get stop randomly and they do do random check apparently but it's not every time so yes theoretically they could
S0580	oh so that's how it work i've always wonder
S0454	what's the point
S0580	yeah
S0454	but i do it today and i think yeah the first time i be slow but it be quicker overall cos that be quite a big slow you up isn't it one by one have to take everything out
S0580	yeah when you fee everything onto the yeah
S0454	so you do everything twice you put it all in one by one then you take it all out one by one and then you have to re pack it one by one
S0580	and then it again
S0454	so it's triple the work
S0579	ah
S0454	so you just do it once
S0580	yeah that's logical but i've i've often think
S0454	what
S0580	what's to stop people load up and not scan it and then escape with free stuff
S0454	well i think they must do it
S0579	must try and run after you tell me how you do it yeah
S0454	but you wonder
S0579	yeah
S0454	how if they've calculate that in the cost of someone's wage
S0580	yeah
S0579	oh yeah yes
S0454	versus the odd person who steal
S0580	yeah
S0454	cos you probably won't steal the whole trolley load cos you look at you'd be suspicious it would be one thing probably or two things
S0580	oh no yes
S0579	yeah
S0580	yeah
S0454	but you think i wonder if they'd calculate that in
S0580	they must do because there's gonna be an element of people sneak in one or two things and not pay
S0454	mm
S0580	i don't know there have to be
S0454	but they must think they save money overall
S0580	yeah
S0454	which be amaze isn't it yes
S0580	do you hear that dad about scan as you go
S0579	no no
S0580	you can go into the supermarket and get a little handheld device and as you shop you put it you scan it the item and then you put it straight into your shop bag
S0579	oh
S0580	so that when you come to the till you don't have to be do this with all your goods because you've already record it on this device and it's already in your shop bag
S0579	what about if you've decide not to put one on there
S0580	well this be what we just say to
S0454	yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes well we think it must happen
S0579	yeah
S0454	sometimes they check but not every time
S0579	oh i see must be
S0454	yeah
S0580	i mean i wouldn't dare risk it in case you know you be the one that be stop or whatever
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah but then you'd just say that's one item you just say oh i'm sorry i must have do it wrong
S0580	oh i'm sorry i must have forget
S0579	no
S0454	yes oh it must have break
S0579	ah yes
S0454	yes so i'm sure you get away with that i mean you'd be suspicious if you have lot of things wouldn't it but
S0579	yeah
S0580	yes
S0454	if it be one thing you'd probably get away with it
S0580	so when you come to pay you just show this device to a terminal thing do you
S0454	yes you you show the device you scan it and then it just run through everything so you'd check if there be an error i suppose
S0580	yeah
S0454	and then if you buy alcohol then it beep for the woman to come anyway to check the
S0580	yes
S0454	you know over eighteen but if you've not you've not get a restrict item it just tell you to pay and that's the end you don't even have to give it your club card cos you already do that at the begin
S0580	i'm go to try that i'm go to
S0454	yeah that fun it be really fun
S0580	i i've put off find out how it work i think oh forget that
S0454	yes that be very excite development for me yes
S0579	oh absolutely i see yes
S0454	there'll be supermarkets with no people soon no staff
S0580	yeah
S0454	that'll be the next thing all those checkouts'll disappear and just be these terminals yeah it's quite excite and the good thing be if you're on a low budget or if you just like budget you know what you're spend
S0580	yes
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	which be a huge help and it's quite easy to take things off cos that you know normally you're kind of guess aren't you
S0579	yeah yes you be
S0454	sort of add it up in your head but you never quite know because you don't know really what the fruit weigh and all of that so you've do all of that by the time you get to the end
S0580	so suppose you put something in your basket and then and you've scan it and you think no i don't actually want this you can take it out and
S0454	yes you you press the remove button and then it say
S0580	right
S0454	scan the item you want to remove and you scan it and it say do you want to remove this tin of bake bean
S0579	oh
S0454	and you say yes
S0580	right
S0454	that's it the only thing you can't do which they can do at the till be if you have six of something
S0580	yeah
S0454	you have to scan it six time whereas at the till they just press six don't they
S0580	yeah
S0579	mm
S0580	okay
S0454	so that's a bite annoy because you're buy with the same thing go through one by one but that's the only thing i've find not as good yeah
S0454	but i like the fact it add it up
S0579	yeah
S0454	that be useful know what you've spend before you go to the till
S0579	yeah
S0580	so you can tally as you go along you can see how much you
S0454	yes
S0579	how much to spend yeah
S0454	cos i'd i i add it up and tell you how many of each thing you've get
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah so i like it
S0579	bring it up just take something out do you
S0454	exactly yes because that
S0454	i mean that's only happen to me a couple of time but
S0579	yeah
S0454	it be a bite embarrass
S0579	that's right sorry
S0579	forty five pound

S0579	do she
S0454	well she do well cos that's not even on satnavs
S0579	of course she do that's right
S0580	no that probably isn't no
S0454	it isn't you can put in the postcode all you want it'll just say
S0580	yeah
S0454	don't know i'm have such fun that's that's annoy here actually everything in the uk be do off postcodes
S0579	yes
S0454	everything so if your postcode be not recognise you be off the grid as far as everyone's concern
S0579	off
S0580	oh that yeah
S0454	the satnav but also insurance i i almost couldn't get insurance for the house and actually they refuse to exchange contract
S0579	oh
S0454	until they see a write quote cos that's how much of a problem it be that people cannot insure a new build house because it's not on any one system you can't get the postcodes right and it's not the post office the post office have them years ahead they they've deliver post
S0580	yeah
S0454	fine from the begin
S0579	yeah
S0454	it's because it's all computerise and people don't update their massive software every day so it can take years
S0580	i know that we have that in york cos we be rent a new build
S0454	crazy yeah
S0580	and it wasn't recognise anywhere except by the post office you'd phone up and they'd go no you're not in our system
S0454	yeah can't help you
S0580	no
S0454	barclays bank who i've bank with for about fifteen years say they couldn't insure me
S0579	oh blimey yeah
S0454	yeah and then i go a couple of weeks ago and say why don't you have your house insurance with us it's cos i'm not on your system
S0580	yeah it's your fault
S0579	yeah yes yes
S0579	yes
S0454	oh yes you must be a new build
S0579	no
S0454	yeah it be funny that's very odd though
S0580	yeah
S0579	you still have to get competitive price do you when you
S0454	well you see i haven't be able to because if this postcode problem
S0579	no no
S0454	so i only have a choice of about three in the end when you should have you know thirty to choose from
S0579	yeah
S0454	but hopefully by next year people will it'll be on people's systems but i might not
S0579	yeah i see
S0454	might be free again
S0580	say that you will you will be cos ours come up quite soon afterwards and you get chance to shop around for the best deal

S0454	i read on my phone mostly or on the computer
S0579	oh yeah oh of course you can read it on there the
S0454	yes
S0579	well you can't read all of what's in the mail on the thing
S0454	no
S0579	headline isn't it yes
S0454	i get the bbc news on my phone
S0579	oh do you oh that's okay
S0454	quite good yeah
S0579	you see i i'm use to paper not the other thing
S0454	yeah no it's nice to have a paper
S0579	yeah
S0454	different what's happen today then
S0579	do you
S0454	i hear google's go to pay some tax that's a surprise
S0579	oh of course
S0454	because they've not be pay for years
S0579	no they no and they owe us a few millions don't they or something
S0454	billion yeah well i don't know
S0579	yeah
S0454	but they've they've come to some deal with hmrc they're go to pay twenty three million but that be five years worth
S0579	yeah still money for million
S0454	but apparently that work out as a three percent tax rate so
S0579	oh
S0454	nothing compare to what they should have pay
S0579	no
S0454	so they've be cheeky but it's better than zero
S0579	better than nothing yeah
S0454	i mean they they've do zero but i think they shouldn't get away with that to be honest
S0579	how come the how come they've be pay zero tax then
S0454	well they've use all these tax avoidance scheme
S0579	oh
S0454	so they're not actually illegal
S0579	no no
S0454	well they will be this year
S0454	but historically they've not be
S0579	yeah
S0454	illegal
S0579	mm
S0454	but what they do be they say their headquarter somewhere else
S0579	yes
S0454	and then they divert profit to ireland apparently where the taxation be lower
S0579	yeah irish yeah
S0454	and so even though they do most of their business here they claim their head office be somewhere else
S0579	be in ireland yeah yeah yeah
S0454	but that's the problem but they've all be do that
S0579	yeah
S0454	and basically all of these big corporations have pay no tax
S0579	oh oh well
S0454	but erm it's catch up with them so they're go to pay something
S0579	oh well
S0454	which be good
S0579	our tax will go down then
S0454	well
S0454	that would be nice
S0579	yeah
S0454	but sadly
S0579	yeah yeah oh well
S0454	it do seem unfair doesn't it
S0579	yeah
S0454	cos small businesses
S0579	yeah yeah yeah
S0454	would always have to pay
S0579	yeah
S0454	it's the big ones that get away with pay nothing
S0579	be they take yours out of your pay packet now
S0454	yes which be better
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	i think that's much better isn't it
S0579	but do you know whether it's correct what they take out
S0454	no but i have to do a self assessment each year i get erm a letter each year
S0579	oh do you
S0454	so i have to put in all the figure
S0579	yeah
S0454	and then it work it out
S0579	well have to do that i think yeah
S0454	yes cos she's self employ and for me it's cos i've have more than one job so then you end up get over tax
S0579	yeah
S0454	so i'm always over tax and then each year
S0579	oh
S0454	to date i've always have a rebate
S0579	yeah
S0454	of a few hundred pound
S0579	i think get off well with hers
S0454	yeah
S0579	i remember once with her private she put so many expense down she's get nothing leave
S0579	to be tax i say you really can't send this off they won't believe it
S0454	that's true
S0579	so
S0454	yeah
S0579	yeah she sort of put down as expense you know
S0454	that's funny
S0579	and and a a new pair of shoe or something to take into the classroom
S0454	oh right
S0579	or whatever
S0454	yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	that's funny
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah so hopefully i'll get something back i've just do mine cos the deadline's the thirty first of january
S0579	yes
S0454	if you do it online
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	i just do mine a few days ago and
S0579	yeah
S0454	hopefully i'll get something back
S0579	it's okay they don't normally ask any question unless they and then on
S0454	no no so hopefully not
S0579	well anyway they look on the scale of things if they have a bill for about a hundred pound they don't bother with those sort chase them to court anyway no
S0454	no no that's true they well they tend to just add it on to the
S0579	to yeah
S0454	the next year's one
S0454	that's what they always ask do you want us to take this from next year rather than you pay us now yeah
S0579	well it's always nice to postpone it
S0454	yes i always put them off
S0579	yeah yeah buy another bike or something that sort of
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes so hopefully i won't get a
S0579	do you get yourself a new bike i
S0454	no i'm use dad's one at the moment
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	cos he doesn't erm use his so i'll just use that for now
S0454	and then i'll probably just get a second hand one at some point
S0579	oh yes
S0454	but actually the fold up ones be good cos they do fit in the boot of the car easily
S0579	yeah that make life easier mm
S0454	so you don't have to put the seat down and then when you put the seat down you know you get oil and things on them don't you so it's it's not ideal
S0579	oh no no
S0454	and then in the house as well
S0579	yeah
S0454	you don't really want bike in the hallway and things
S0579	yeah
S0454	so a fold up one would fit under the stairs
S0579	oh
S0454	so maybe i should get a fold up one and
S0579	yeah
S0454	the thing be fold up ones aren't very good if you're go long distance
S0579	no they're
S0454	cos the wheel be tiny they're only about that big
S0579	oh that's
S0454	but if it's city kind of commute which be what i'd be do
S0579	yeah
S0454	it's fine
S0579	oh right
S0454	and they've still get you know seven gear so the gear be fine it's just the wheel be
S0579	oh
S0454	very small
S0579	seven seven gear
S0454	yes
S0579	oh that's a lot use to be about three gear didn't it yeah seven gear
S0454	yes yeah so the gear be good just the wheel be small so your
S0579	yeah
S0454	you're pedal
S0579	faster
S0454	more
S0579	yeah
S0454	than if you have a bigger bike but it's okay exeter's quite hilly
S0579	yeah
S0454	but the distance aren't very big
S0579	yeah
S0454	so
S0579	be your dad still out on bike
S0454	not at the moment no
S0454	he's swim at the moment
S0579	oh

S0579	be it
S0454	yes
S0579	ah there's a hotel then as well
S0454	yes there's a hotel
S0579	ah yeah i think that's in i seem to remember
S0454	ah right yes yes that be
S0579	you know scotland quite well do you
S0454	no i know edinburgh reasonably well
S0579	yeah
S0454	but i don't know
S0579	grandma edinburgh
S0579	it be when we use to four or five time in years go by
S0454	yeah
S0579	cos in the early days it be miles away from down here edinburgh
S0454	it still be feel it
S0579	much quicker to get to france than it be to get to scotland yes
S0454	well yes well it definitely be by road isn't it
S0579	well you get as far as down in plymouth here very quickly france somewhere
S0454	yes that's right and cheaper probably too to france
S0579	where do take me this summer where do we go
S0454	oh you've go to france with have you i expect so or do you go to spain
S0579	yeah
S0454	no france probably
S0579	we go to france with i think that's right that's right cos
S0454	mm
S0579	she suddenly find her her voice for erm the french language
S0454	oh that's nice
S0579	she be able to chat with them quite easily actually
S0454	oh good
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes 's not bad at language be she
S0579	no she do spanish as well
S0454	yeah
S0579	oh i i don't think she be go to course i think for spanish some course somewhere
S0454	ah yes yes she be do some sort of course at the adult learn college
S0454	but she be say it's stop now all those there be not enough people or something
S0579	oh do it oh
S0454	she she's do self study at home but it's not the same you need a
S0579	let somebody down
S0454	particularly language cos you need someone well first of all to converse
S0579	yeah
S0454	with but you also need someone to correct you it's not the same as i don't know learn maths or something
S0579	i think i think be say there's not enough people there to warrant it or something like that
S0454	yes yes languages aren't very popular in the uk be they no
S0579	not any more no everyone speak english don't
S0454	yes
S0579	at least very often very often the case
S0454	and that be in the newspaper this morning
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	on the bbc that gcse and a level number have fall
S0579	yeah
S0454	hugely in the last few years for french
S0579	yeah
S0454	and for german and no one hardly anyone learn it but at university as well
S0579	oh so language
S0454	apparently it's labour's fault
S0579	what's the language in in what other languages do people do people speak
S0454	spanish learners have increase
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	a lot but it's because when i be at school it use to be compulsory to study a language until gcse but when labour be in they take that away and they say it be optional so all that happen be everyone stop learn
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	erm so yes they think that's what account for most of the fall but also there's a shift in like people learn spanish more nowadays
S0579	oh
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah cos i suppose spanish be mm quite a lot of spanish all over the world isn't it especially if you go to south america
S0454	yes and the state as well now
S0579	the state be spanish be it
S0454	yes
S0579	oh
S0454	a lot of hispanic people there
S0579	but they come up from south i suppose some of them in america yeah
S0454	yes so spanish be very widely speak in the us
