S0520	there's a little advert not very little actually mm

S0520	oh the five nations
S0519	whatever it be
S0520	six nations
S0519	the six nations erm but it be a great advert it be kind of like all of the different nations show up in pubs and all round the place all cheer for the wrong team they're all cheer for whoever be play england i think it be really great and i and they ban it
S0520	no way
S0519	yeah
S0519	they say it be like racist or something
S0520	that's silly
S0519	it be proper silly cos the english really can laugh at themselves that's the only good thing you know that the you know you could honestly say it be the english advert of the english laugh at themselves
S0520	well england australia's go to be a big one isn't it
S0521	mm certainly
S0519	be we in the same group as wales and australia
S0521	we be yeah
S0519	oh god
S0520	that's why it be important to beat fiji
S0519	mm i see it
S0520	they be like kind of the less good people
S0519	so they could do with beat wales as well then
S0520	defo
S0521	could do with win everything
S0520	they could do with an unbroken streak of
S0521	mm
S0520	reduce salt and sugar sauce do dad buy it
S0519	no i think i might have
S0521	how dare you
S0520	grimness i don't like reduce things
S0520	so i didn't quite understand which part of grandma's alarm wasn't work if she do manage to
S0519	so it's on her wrist and there's a button that she can press so say she be just in distress and she just press the button
S0520	right
S0519	but it's also suppose to automatically go off if she fall
S0520	oh and that's the part that didn't
S0519	that's the design of it and she's have a number of fall
S0520	do she fall on her arm or not
S0519	no she feel at the bottom of the stairs she be just go towards the stair lift we think
S0521	that's right yeah
S0519	mm
S0520	yeah
S0519	er but you don't know if she grab onto something do it break her fall do she just fall you know do she just kind of stumble down slowly rather than just go crash
S0520	mm
S0521	yeah
S0519	but
S0520	you need to check if it's work how it should be
S0519	check if it's work
S0520	but then she can press it manually
S0519	mm
S0520	mm
S0519	but i suppose the idea be if she's so hurt that she's not
S0520	able to yeah
S0519	able to press it that's
S0520	grandad have one as well doesn't he grandad or in the house he have a like a pulley
S0519	mm
S0521	he have a cord yeah
S0520	cord yeah
S0519	so his be not so ideal in that he have to be able to reach the cord
S0520	reach it yeah
S0521	yeah
S0520	worry about him less but it's not really i mean he sort of bound around doesn't he
S0521	mm yeah
S0519	he's no i don't think about him fall as such although it could of course happen
S0520	yeah
S0519	but whereas grandma you need something to
S0520	it happen a lot doesn't it
S0519	cos that's go to happen a lot
S0520	yeah mm

S0520	but she erm be work in london on monday and tuesday
S0519	oh lord
S0520	so she's just mull it over to see that it's not too much

S0520	sunday afternoon be worse like on the way back we have some traffic last time i think but

S0520	we saw that didn't we even on the way back from see on sunday if tree's one accident
S0519	as soon as there's anything mm
S0520	it be just miles and miles and miles it be something to take into consideration especially if we've get to be back for
S0519	mm
S0521	have you see that mr volkswagen resign
S0519	mm
S0520	do he that be only only really next step wasn't it
S0519	mm he could have just be sack
S0520	so he be fully aware of what be go on
S0521	no he say i have no knowledge of this and it it's i'm totally erm dismay by the whole event
S0520	oh dear
S0521	but it's my responsibility and we need a fresh start
S0519	be he mr american volkswagen or mr
S0521	mr mr overall volkswagen
S0520	he's the chief exec mr
S0519	oh god
S0520	yeah
S0519	oh no
S0520	he's a nice german name
S0519	poor them
S0520	yeah well he i mean he know even if he wasn't directly culpable it's like you have to hold someone that person accountable don't you to what's go on
S0521	yes exactly
S0521	unlike mr blatta
S0520	who's mr blatta
S0521	the er don't you know about this fifa thing
S0520	no
S0521	fifa be the international regulation body for football
S0519	mm
S0521	and in particular they organise the world cup
S0520	yeah
S0521	and erm there's be a terrible scandal because erm
S0519	well there's be scandals for years
S0521	a large a large number of the executive committee have be find to be involve with corruption
S0519	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0521	fix and their news and price and things but mr mr blatta be the swiss head of fifa and he refuse any knowledge of it any responsibility for it
S0520	really
S0521	he
S0519	it's be go on for ten years
S0521	he to stand for president when the next elections come he be elect again
S0520	be you serious
S0519	because of all the bribe
S0520	cos of the all corrupt people
S0521	then he resign say i'm resign but it's it's nothing to do with me really
S0519	no he say it wasn't really a resignation and i could be up for election again he's quite something
S0520	he's a bite of a dodge character
S0521	meanwhile a lot of his board have be take up by the fbi and hold on remand or whatever the expression be
S0520	the likelihood of him know nothing about it be approximately zero isn't it
S0521	well exactly
S0519	mm and you know it's even which countries the it's all be hold in the world cup over the last three or four time and the ones that be already book in to come have have to pay huge amount to get the world cup
S0521	they be bribe basically
S0519	and that's why you know people who do it the normal way without bribe didn't get it
S0520	oh so the suggestion be that the host country have to
S0519	have all pay huge bribe south africa include
S0521	well this this be story that that the next world cup be in qatar which be the most unlikely football country you can imagine but
S0521	especially it's forty five degrees centigrade in the sun
S0520	oh my god
S0521	and now the football nations be refuse to play
S0520	that's ridiculous temperatures
S0521	that be clearly a
S0519	but no they're very wealthy
S0521	clear that they'd pay for to get the world cup to go to them
S0520	absolutely well what's it suppose to be base on
S0519	er
S0521	football tradition i suppose
S0519	no
S0520	merit
S0519	they put forward a whole don't they just like the olympics each country have to put forward proposals where the ground be make their case
S0520	the stadiums and so forth
S0519	what you know what they'll do for the communities how it will be run blah blah blah blah blah the infrastructure
S0520	i'm sure your average qatari be not see much of that cash
S0520	well i don't know how it work but often in these countries it's a very rich elite isn't it
S0519	mm
S0521	yes
S0520	i like it when like someone be just fully guilty and they still just stand there and say i have nothing to do with this
S0519	totally all all of the europeans
S0520	how can you do that
S0519	establishments be all entirely against him but because it's the other nations the asian's and the african's that be pay the bribe they love him cos they can't get it they haven't get a chance otherwise
S0520	well in india that's the only thing that's the only that's the that's the system as such
S0521	that's the system
S0519	mm
S0520	it's not like corruption like a system
S0519	well that's why they keep on get vote in
S0520	it's the way it work you know and there's a whole hierarchy of bribe go on
S0521	i'm sure
S0520	erm you you you give money to your superior and they give money to their superior and so forth so the people at the top be get
S0521	yeah
S0519	the pyramid
S0520	a pyramid of bribe and er and that's how you get things do and even if you happen to have a run in with someone you want to get things do you just give them money
S0521	there be a there be a telephone a a television conference erm quite recently and blatter be sit you know as they do with a little panel of his cohorts give er a television interview and one of the reporters come out to the front and tip a whole tin tin of rubbish on to his desk as a protest
S0520	mm
S0519	erm the english media and the english footballing association have be really put out by him because all sort of things haven't be able to happen that could have happen and so they're really very unhappy and have be for as long as i've know them and call him corrupt and try to bring it him to and they couldn't pin anything down never can pin anything down on him never can sort of do
S0520	how's he manage that
S0519	erm and the the chief like you know the equivalent of panorama have
S0521	yeah
S0519	show up all of the things that he's do and blah blah blah he just say be ne me
S0520	be ne me i'm surprise he's not italian
S0519	erm and er so now finally the american's have just arrest him yes please
S0521	oh we're go be we
