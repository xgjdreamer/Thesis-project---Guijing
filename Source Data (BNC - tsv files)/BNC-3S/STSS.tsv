S0041	you'd just be well that's it you just gotta burn it up good
S0084	oh mannn
S0041	and i realize stupidly my frigging gym stuff's still here from the other day
S0084	stink
S0041	yeah it's really gutting
S0084	oh
S0041	it's gonna have to go in the
S0084	shove it in the laundry bag
S0041	i'll have to shove the wash when that come out
S0084	gonna do your short
S0041	huh
S0084	be you gonna do your short tonight
S0041	yeah
S0041	i think if i don't do it i'm just gonna put it off put it off and never do it so
S0084	yeah
S0041	while i'm still excite about it ah so i do all the test
S0084	customize yeah how do you get on
S0041	i work it all out and i'm average eighty percent
S0084	oh wow there you go
S0041	yeah uh the ones i didn't know they say just guess anyway if you're in that time i'm spend that time on maths
S0084	yeah yeah yeah
S0041	i didn't guess any so i couldn't potentially get another percent or something just by lucky guess
S0084	yeah yeah absolutely
S0041	um but what i didn't know how to do like i don't know how to do division long division when it's two number into you know when you do the little sign
S0084	oh fuck hell yeah
S0041	if it's if it's two number get divide cos i'm alright eight and then divide through three thousand two hundred and seventy one fine but if it's like thirty eight and then in the thing three thousand i can't do that
S0084	yeah
S0041	my brain just say no
S0084	yeah well i think you have to do it separately don't you don't you have to break it down
S0041	do you
S0084	it take yeah like you're like the sum be like that
S0041	oh yes oh i haven't work do this i couldn't do it
S0084	you yeah no don't do it just don't do it to yourself just just miss that out
S0041	yeah i think there's there's three question three mark lose and that's gonna have to do
S0084	mm mm
S0041	but one of them there's a lot of time and decimals
S0084	oh shit
S0041	how the hell d'you do that
S0084	uh i dunno uh
S0041	cos i try to do it like you like you would do a normal time
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	that
S0084	that's wrong
S0041	that's wrong cos whatever i get be miles over the five options
S0084	uh you've gotta remember to move the decimal point haven't you that's the thing
S0041	move the decimal point
S0084	yeah cos obviously it's tens hundreds and thousands isn't it like depend on where the decimal point be
S0041	mm
S0084	so like if it's something something decimal point something that's tens but then after the decimal point it's tens hundreds and thousands as well so if you're if it's like thirty two point forty five and it's time by four
S0041	yeah
S0084	then you have to move it one
S0041	yeah no i can do that but what 'bout three point two time six point nine
S0084	don't know
S0041	no i don't know either gonna have to learn though
S0084	yeah no i dunno well just google that
S0041	mm
S0084	youtube master class
S0041	yep so that's more mark totally have this
S0084	so that's so that's for tomorrow
S0041	definitely need a wee
S0084	yeah
S0041	yeah so that's for tomorrow so
S0084	mm
S0041	eighty percent isn't bad i mean
S0084	eighty percent's really good like as a start point that's good
S0041	yeah it's close to the mark though isn't it if you need
S0084	yeah yeah but that
S0041	the handbag over my hand cos i'm not take mine i just assume it be mine i could feel
S0084	oh god
S0041	get out the shop and i be like oh crap and i take it back cos i felt really bad
S0084	oh well do
S0041	i be gonna keep it of course
S0084	yeah
S0041	i be like no cos if you go in there to return something then be like where's your handbag
S0041	so i be like no mustn't do that
S0084	oh well do you
S0041	so i do the good thing and take it back
S0084	have they get security guard
S0041	no beepers didn't even go off
S0084	oh that's a bite
S0041	i get out the shop
S0084	oh that's a bite of a worry
S0041	yeah
S0084	cos it's not like you've gotta tag the bag be it you could just put a a device in the bottom of the bag that's what we use to do
S0041	yeah
S0084	mm
S0041	god know
S0084	weird weird oh that be very honest of you well do mm oh my god don't eat the bunny eat these

S0041	yeah
S0084	boys can't do coursework cos they can't concentrate so they can't apply themselves over a long period of time which be why my dissertation be such a fuck nightmare
S0041	yeah
S0084	but i do it um but i be always better at exams than i be at coursework i always get much better mark in an exam
S0084	d'you have to sell your kidney
S0041	um no not quite not quite but i'm just not convince that all this stuff i've pay for have come out of here yet like to the point where i kind of wanna go to the cash machine and get all this out so that if anything i've put on my card that try to go through
S0084	yeah
S0041	won't touch it might do it
S0084	well i mean the only thing be you'd get bank charge
S0041	oh yeah that's an issue
S0084	if they try and take money they'll charge you you don't you don't want that
S0041	no don't know really what's leave to come out of there
S0084	well what have you pay for today
S0041	nothing today have come out of here yet so that's on there so it say there's two sixty but there's probably about two thirty
S0084	mm
S0041	and the
S0084	that's fine
S0041	hotel room's gonna be eighty
S0084	right have you get food and stuff in for the week to last until you get pay

S0084	yeah so you go down sunday so you gonna go out for dinner on sunday night
S0041	yeah
S0084	so say like even if you would get takeaway that's still gonna be like twenty quid isn't it so bout twenty or thirty quid for food and then
S0041	twenty or thirty quid for drink say
S0084	i mean depend depend what you do like if you're go to the museums it's free to get in unless you get to the special exhibitions so in theory that shouldn't cost too much money
S0041	no
S0084	hms belfast will probably charge you
S0041	think that's about fifteen
S0084	yeah
S0041	reckon a hundred quid's probably
S0084	like max yeah

S0084	well i mean okay so if you go out tonight you'll spend money

S0041	might snog a chav
S0084	yeah
S0041	yeah
S0084	uh you might fall over and break yourself
S0041	yeah
S0084	cos if you're wear your killer heel there's quite a high possibility
S0041	well i'm not plan on get too drink like i don't you know sometimes you just wanna go out and get absolutely slaughter
S0084	mm
S0041	i don't really feel the need to do that just kinda have a jab around
S0084	yeah but i always think that and then i'm like right shots at the bar lovely

S0041	yeah
S0084	but you could go out drink tomorrow
S0041	i think i need to go to the cash machine get cash out and leave leave everything else think that's the only option like how much be it for a taxi it's about seven quid isn't it

S0041	so if i take a tenner to make sure i can get home a tenner to get me into a club
S0084	yeah

S0041	i'll drink the prosecco yeah
S0084	yeah
S0041	doo doo du du doo du du doo
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos i think the i always think oh yeah more more but really a whole bottle of prosecco you just the thing be you have to have you have you don't realize you're get more drink do you you just carry on drink whereas i think if you do carry on drink the prosecco would still see you drink till about two oh yeah easily i mean it's probably just because when you're around other people other people be drink so you're like well if you're go to the bar i should probably go to the bar right
S0041	yeah
S0084	and then when you be piss you forget that you're piss
S0041	and keep drink
S0084	and just carry on and carry on and you're like i can't see any more but d'you know what i need
S0041	a vodka
S0084	more booze shots yeah i mean if you think that you can um bring yourself home again at a reasonable state then definitely you should go like there's no reason not to uh apart from the death the death might get you
S0041	apart from the death
S0084	and that would be really bad time
S0041	that would be really shock wouldn't it where's the vitamin c

S0084	well yeah i mean we we don't know where it's come from do we we don't know if it's her say i'm not that keen on the idea or whether it's him go oh well you do say you didn't wanna talk to me any more be the week be go away for a whole weekend gonna be a good idea for you like i think it be possibly think of you in the long run
S0041	i think he's just spineless
S0084	he just handle it really badly
S0041	i don't think he's think of me all i think i'm think the way he be describe it he's just scar that gonna get piss off with him that be what come over in the conversation
S0084	oh really
S0041	yeah not it's i don't think it's great for you cos i say to him well you won't give so i force you into it and he really buy into this idea um then the conversation be really more of about hurt feel
S0084	oh right
S0041	and i be i that's why i get so angry cos i be like you're all you complain that you could hurt her feel but you don't care a shit about mine
S0084	mm
S0041	like you don't know her
S0084	mm
S0041	that's why i get so agitate with it cos he be just like ooh i'm not sure i'll i'm i'm concern about how she'll feel and i know she say it's she's alright with it but what happen if she's really not and i be like well call her then call your girlfriend don't speak to me about it

S0084	what's your problem
S0041	yeah what's your problem well i don't know if she really be well if she's really not she should've pluck up some courage and say it or you should've pluck up some bollocks a month ago and put a stop to it then

S0041	either way we've make plan now if you're not comfortable we won't go i don't care

S0084	mm
S0041	to your friends
S0084	mm
S0041	to throw a gift back in the face just in case someone that you barely know doesn't feel very good about it secretly
S0084	mm mm absolutely

S0084	it's um a part of it probably be that he can't trust himself around you as well like
S0041	mm
S0084	like last time you be alone together he get his wanger out so
S0084	you know there be that danger
S0041	yeah and on the phone he be like oh i know that be such a stupid thing to do i be just too drink i'm sorry and i be like when you're too drink you're sick when you're too drink you'd probably snog a dog you don't get your bits out

S0084	yeah
S0041	i mean i suppose that's part of be a a teenager and be a bite obsessive with it
S0084	yeah
S0041	but i've get it down to a fine art
S0084	right
S0041	like i could do it with my eye close
S0084	yeah well i think the grass be always greener isn't it like you've get thick then you want think hair if you've get curly hair you want straight hair like you be probably never gonna be satisfy
S0041	no i nearly have a perm not long ago
S0084	oh my god
S0041	yeah i know i didn't think it through but imagine how much there would've be
S0084	it would've be massive
S0041	it would've be like eighties
S0084	yeah it would be quite cool though
S0041	yeah i want it cut cos that's you know in that picture i show you of me and it be really short i want it do then so have a blond fro
S0084	oh okay
S0041	i have like this really big obsession about have a blond afro
S0084	right it's quite a statement
S0041	yeah i mean i go to the hairdressers
S0084	mm
S0041	um and the guy behind the counter think i be tell him a joke
S0041	i be like how can i get a blond fro like how i mean would you perm this and he be like what
S0041	i be like blond afro that's what i want
S0084	right
S0041	he be like uh it would fall out
S0041	bleach and then perm you would be bald
S0084	it's not worth it
S0041	yeah i be like oh okay perhaps i'll have a rethink and he be like yeah i think you should
S0041	thank you're really kind someone's get a fro
S0084	oh i wish well i would like a proper fro like a big thick fro
S0041	yeah hers be great
S0084	i think it's awesome
S0041	she have it chemically relax though so it's just a little bite curly like yours
S0084	mm
S0041	and then she she can straighten it as well so she straighten it if she go out
S0084	mm
S0041	take her fuck hours though
S0084	do it even with the chemical straighten
S0041	yeah
S0084	yeah
S0041	and if it get wet it go back to how it be like yours
S0084	yeah no i just um my hair's so thin that i can't straighten it now cos i'm just so scar that it's gonna fall out plus i just think like it's think but you can't really tell when it's curly
S0041	no you can't at all
S0084	so if it's straight you can really see that there's like no hair leave
S0041	someone else who's get quite thin hair oh turn the bugger off
S0084	you ninny
S0084	d'you like this programme do you like this programme
S0041	i do the latest series isn't very good i don't think
S0084	oh i've only catch bits of it and then it never make me laugh and i just wonder who actually watch it
S0041	yeah
S0084	but it's it like be it suppose to be like friends
S0041	yeah
S0084	right
S0041	the the first few be funny i use the first couple of series be good i dunno i think there might've be something like six or something now and i don't really find it amuse any more
S0084	mm
S0041	like it's easy watch
S0084	yeah
S0041	but
S0084	i guess friends get a bite like that didn't it like it wasn't really funny the end and they do like ten series didn't didn't they
S0041	yeah i no i still like friends though especially when joey's lunge
S0084	oh
S0041	you steal my clothe i'm wear everything you own

S0084	i guess it probably be the most quote thing isn't it

S0084	yeah
S0041	sound like a nice enough family um that they'd behave properly so i tell her and she say well if you know sound like they'd be okay
S0084	yeah
S0041	i say and also you know they're suppose to be go into cambridge for their parent be suppose to be go into cambridge for a drink so i say well why don't you come to the restaurant and have them in here
S0084	yeah
S0041	and i be like oh okay then in that case you knowthat sound pretty pretty fine and then they're on they're on hand in case it all
S0084	it all ban mm
S0041	um they be the worst behave bunch in a hotel i've ever see
S0084	no
S0041	yep they be jump around they be just be absolutely awful to the point where
S0041	the uh manager go go next door and say to the parent like you know it's get a bite out of hand parent say okay so what you gonna do about it
S0084	no they didn't well kick them out then if you're not gonna do anything
S0041	they knock the um dj speakers over like four time
S0084	ahh massive twats
S0041	yeah and the fourth time paul like turn the speakers off and be like right you really be get out of hand now and if it happen once more then i'm sorry but i'm leave like i'm pack up my stuff and go
S0084	what the dj say that
S0041	yeah and obviously there be nothing we could say cos he be right they be be horrendous
S0084	yeah yeah yeah i mean can you kick them out
S0041	yeah we can but it doesn't look very good on us
S0084	ahh
S0041	place
S0084	yeah yeah yeah
S0041	um so the parent do nothing it get to like kick out time cos they have to leave at midnight anyway
S0084	ohhh
S0041	um
S0084	mm
S0041	they be sneak alcohol in
S0084	no
S0041	drink it in the toilets
S0084	well that's what eighteen year olds do i suppose but you'd think if the parent be on hand they'd pay pay a bite more attention
S0041	yeah and plus like we'd say to the parent we don't usually take eighteenth birthday party it's not worth our license you knowwe're not a pub we don't get the same type of leeway
S0084	yeah
S0041	every single person in the bar will have to be id'd and i know that's not what your kid be gonna wanna have it here but that's they only thing we can
S0084	yeah well fair enough
S0041	you know we can agree to
S0084	cos it could be that it's you know what month be it now february so only half of them be gonna be eighteen
S0041	yeah and so we say you know if you if they're want to have a piss up we're we're it's probably not gonna be very fun for them here
S0084	yeah
S0041	and she be like no no that's not what they're after
S0084	yeah
S0041	fuck lie bitch uh didn't do anything and then at the end of the night they all sit on the trestle table and break it snap it clean in half
S0084	no way do you charge them a damage deposit or whatever
S0041	well send them an email say you know i know we didn't give you a charge you a waver but i'm gonna have to bill you for the cost of the damage
S0084	yeah absolutely
S0041	you know really sorry blah blah blah she be like oh no no that's understandable i say it's two hundred and eighty four pound
S0084	how much
S0041	two hundred and eighty four
S0084	oh shit
S0041	cos like a trestle not a trestle table like a conference table cos it be a real thick one
S0084	right
S0041	she say um the the students in question will be pay for the damage they have they have request proof of the price of the table
S0084	oh just send them the table
S0041	um
S0084	the break table
S0041	no the proof of the cost and she say and i personally do think it be a little steep i think be you take the piss they break it be really badly behave and cause shit all night and you're question two hundred and eighty quid
S0084	mm
S0041	so i send them an invoice and i say plus vat plus delivery if that's the case three fifty thank
S0084	yeah nice yeah twat
S0041	and they never once apologize
S0084	i bet
S0041	neither set of parent apologize um
S0084	they just don't give a shit that i remember when we have a sixteenth birthday party and my friend have one and hotel in brighton and obviously we be sixteen so none of us should've be drink so the bar wasn't even open there be no one on the bar and her parent be upstairs in the hotel the entire time and they come down and be check on us and obviously we be sort of sneak a bite of stuff in and whatever but generally speak you weren't no one be take the piss i mean
S0041	yeah
S0084	no one be really drink or anything like that and i mean oh
