S0382	so be it like an automatic transcription programme or something
S0326	probably i don't know
S0382	so if i say phenomenological complexity how be your paper on cognitive phenomenological
S0381	oh my god i have this think about consciousness today
S0382	oh scary
S0381	on my run
S0382	oh
S0381	and it it's relation to existence
S0382	oh
S0381	well it be start off think about erm descartes' cogito so you know he have this i think therefore i be right
S0382	no i be have a conscious experience therefore i be
S0381	okay
S0382	that's my translation
S0381	so you can't if if and if you think of it as some sort of deduction right okay let's just think of it as a deduction the existence claim have to be contain in the i think claim
S0382	correct
S0381	so there have to be sort of this affirmation of existence or
S0382	correct
S0381	i don't know i think that be sort of i've never
S0382	but no this be this be old old news because there's be a huge debate about whether it be a whether it's a syllogism or a deduction
S0381	yeah yeah i know that i that's why i be say take it as a syllogism but then that make me think of brentano cos the way he explicate the aware
S0382	damn
S0381	i know i have a good sort of the way the way he explicate the awareness of awareness claim part of it be he think involve a judgement but judgement be either to affirm or deny the existence of something so contain in consciousness be an affirmation of existence
S0382	oh well i think that's like i think that's like
S0381	and i think wow he probably get that from descartes
S0382	well descartes have a sort of struggle about whether it be a syllogism or not but
S0381	yeah
S0382	that that fit with something we be talk about before which be that in the mere awareness of awareness there be the judgement that it be in some sense and then you have to think about whether animals be do that
S0381	yeah i mean that's the hard
S0382	how who where do that come up
S0381	anyway that be a good part of my run
S0382	anyway that be very deep no i think that
S0381	but it make me think about you know how you have this
S0382	me
S0381	self spring
S0382	oh yeah
S0381	stuff and i think oh well maybe there's something i don't know something about that existence somehow
S0382	my latest paper be i think it might be true but everyone's go to think it's crazy
S0381	i don't know anyway
S0382	yeah
S0381	i just want to cos i totally forget i be think of tell you about this and then i forget when i get home cos you be have the crisis about the skip
S0382	that's our new crisis today skip
S0326	where's the skip
S0381	it's the thing that you
S0326	yeah but where where do you get it where do you put it
S0382	it's get to be out there but you have to buy park suspension and then that cost
S0326	everybody else in your neighbourhood use it
S0381	yeah i mean they already use our garbage we're already the neighbourhood recycle centre
S0382	yeah they in our in our echo recycle bin they keep drop we usually find some old fish and chip
S0381	well you know what though i've notice lately that they've only be put recyclable items in there
S0382	no a little bite of
S0381	because i've take them out the things that aren't recyclable and put them on the corner there
S0382	you have oh
S0381	yes
S0382	vigilante yeah although we have we have at least
S0381	because otherwise the recycle people have to do that right
S0382	yeah they do so some very popular pub be close in road so some of the clientele be now come here so we're get quite a lot of noise at night but it's alright i kinda like it i kind of there's at least one domestic every day
S0381	oh my god we saw a really bad one
S0382	oh yeah
S0326	yeah but that's the same you know cos road sort of off two main roads
S0382	yeah
S0381	oh
S0326	couple come down there to go and have have their fight
S0381	oh off the main road
S0382	yeah that's right i think they feel it's the kind of stage set out there and there aren't many people around so they have them there

S0382	oh i think have be here since then maybe not no
S0381	they have a fight they be scream and the husband be run out the door and then run back to the door and scream at her and they he come out around the corner and then this muslim no

S0381	well that's a good idea so we can take it
S0326	five fifty
S0382	five fifty for a bottle of wine i mean that's fine but it's not cheap
S0326	five pound fifty
S0381	even even be drink better wine than we be
S0382	oh my god
S0326	five pound fifty be really cheap
S0382	it's pretty well yeah it's not but
S0326	you can't even get a bottle of wine in an off licence that isn't echo fall for five quid
S0382	probably true i'd say well we've be we're kind of cheap
S0326	but even so like even like i don't like there's i know the secret off licence brand that if you can buy it be cheap but they're still like six pound you know
S0382	you know when we go to sainsbury's
S0326	that's probably less though than a full bottle i think
S0382	erm no it it's probably i'm sure it's refill
S0381	have some salad
S0382	you know sometimes you go to sainsbury's and there's some two pound off and it's
S0381	we use to drink really cheap wine from sainsbury's like two pound a bottle
S0382	i don't remember
S0381	we go we just in france we buy ninety six bottle of wine
S0382	that's right that be fun
S0381	it be fun
S0382	fun quite but the most expensive one we buy be like six fifty i think also
S0326	well when i go to paris all i do be

S0382	yeah well i'm a real wimp you know i don't like shellfish and
S0381	oyster
S0382	sea sea urchins like fishy fish
S0326	that's the place that place in essex we go to be famous for oyster that's what people go there to do
S0382	i don't like the chewy or be that mussels
S0381	i don't like it's kind of slimy
S0326	you don't chew oyster
S0381	no just like they go right down your throat
S0382	what do you do
S0326	if you're chew it you do that's like it's really disgust if you chew it obviously
S0381	it's an oyster shooter
S0382	so what be what be the taste but then there's no taste be there
S0326	no no there be you just you swallow it and then it's like get
S0381	it slide down your throat
S0326	and it's like get hit in the face with a wave or something but refresh you know
S0381	i've only do it once i can't remember
S0382	do what once
S0381	an oyster shooter
S0326	shooter
S0381	that's what they call them we say oyster shooter i be at some
S0382	in the unite state
S0381	yeah at a box day party and they have oyster shooters i swear that's what they call them and you just
S0326	in the shell
S0382	what be it though
S0381	yeah
S0326	yeah that's you kind of
S0381	it be disgust
S0326	just you spray lemon on it and tabasco and pepper
S0382	be it still alive or something
S0326	no

S0382	well that be really nice
S0381	yeah
S0382	you're mean to have a merguez cruise go and stock up on organic you know

S0382	yeah if you get a day return it probably pay for itself if you buy two
S0381	or you could just spend the night
S0382	yeah you could yeah you could but i mean if you really be try to maximise the profit you'd do a day return and just like
S0381	yeah true and where would we go
S0382	well i my my theory
S0381	that place we go
S0382	my theory be that you get away from calais
S0381	yeah
S0382	because calais be just design to sell stuff
S0381	yeah we only have to drive an hour away we be already
S0382	yeah indeed that's right
S0381	ah
S0382	ah that be good
S0381	good cook
S0382	oh i move it
S0326	can i have another bite of bread or
S0382	yeah you can you can have our final oh what be happen tomorrow oh we'll get the car if it doesn't blow up again four hundred quid on the car five hundred quid on the skip
S0326	the skip be expensive
S0326	that's insane
S0382	well the thing be i've i've get a permit for four weeks
S0381	oh
S0382	but 's run some i don't i don't think it's as expensive in other boroughs
S0381	mm
S0382	i don't suppose it's expensive in for example
S0326	all every single council be run scheme they're all corrupt and like crook because they have to make this money because the government have pull it out from under their feet a bite
S0381	oh really
S0326	so they're really just like sell off everything and like
S0381	oh maybe like that's why they
S0326	the long term repercussions of strip those councils of their money be go to be like it's go to bad because
S0381	well they want to become their own governments but we saw that cities want to become their own governments
S0326	but not sort of boroughs
S0381	no
S0382	oh yeah yeah this be like well well london boroughs of course have get more people in them than most cities but yeah i doubt it's so
S0381	it's true
S0382	and it look like the kind of surge in interest in cricket be drop away now
S0381	well we haven't be watch it
S0326	that's cos that's cos england be so crap
S0382	it's just hysteria
S0381	who do they lose to sri lanka
S0326	no bangladesh
S0381	mm well good for bangladesh and what happen to them do they
S0326	they get knock out
S0382	they be knock out
S0326	in the in a tournament that's basically design to make it impossible for that to happen
S0381	so be have the final be play
S0382	no
S0381	be it's australia versus new zealand
S0382	no i think there's still some
S0326	new zealand's in the final and australia play india tonight for the other final spot
S0381	oh i hope india win
S0326	no i hope australia win
S0381	right mm
S0326	and then they're gonna lose in the final
S0382	oh yeah
S0381	yeah i'd i'd like to see new zealand win
S0382	new zealand oh yeah you know the pleasure that would give the new zealanders would be like worth everything
S0381	yeah
S0382	it's such a shame i kind of know that would happen
S0381	what
S0382	we get to the top and then
S0326	the thing about it be that it's not even the team it's just sort of people like there's like people in sort of the executive position in the ecb this guy paul downton who fire pietersen and like have all these sort of big ideas but he's totally remove from

S0381	must be really i don't know
S0382	it's okay that they
S0381	not that comfortable
S0382	keep their traditions and on the other hand the deep foundation of those traditions be not good it's sexist there's no and it's kind of it's difficult
S0326	all the girls in my school in be always like i like it cos i can just wear whatever i want underneath it and you're like

S0381	okay
S0382	oh woah isn't that cool look at that jeez i didn't know i've never see his complete poems
S0326	never see what
S0382	i've never see his complete poems i didn't know he write so much
S0326	well it's not it's kind you know that guy daniel mendelsohn
S0382	yeah oh daniel
S0326	it's more about him than about cavafy really
S0382	oh my god
S0382	oh god
S0326	but it's good it's enough to really really
S0382	he be a wanker daniel mendelsohn
S0326	no it's a it's a good piece of work though
S0382	yeah but he's a wanker he be really he be i have an argument with him in the letter column he be he he accuse eleanor winghurst of be sort of a gay brother and that's erm
S0326	gay brother
S0382	no i don't like i don't like don't like daniel mendelsohn i'm afraid i like ed ed mendelsohn who do but i don't like daniel he's probably go to be the next editor of the new york review but you say it's funny you say that cos it's mostly about him why do you say that
S0326	cos i know like i mean it's very like when you saw the size of it it's so heavy it's like really
S0382	why do you say it's mostly about daniel mendelsohn
S0326	cos that's cos i there's never really be anything sort of like that about cavafy before so er at least in english
S0382	yeah but so why be it about daniel mendelsohn
S0326	because sort it's sort of it it it would have be a good it would have be sufficient if it be half the size you know but this be
S0382	cos everyone say he's a complete egomaniac
S0326	yeah but i think he's you know i i think he's a good you know good interest like write interest material
S0382	doesn't mean he isn't doesn't mean he isn't good at the job
S0326	good scholar
S0382	well he totally falsely accuse me of be so i write one say no he isn't and
S0326	so i'm think of something to do a dissertation on and i can't think
S0381	oh my god how long do it have to be
S0326	not long like ten thousand
S0382	erm
S0381	mm what what what do you like do you like
S0326	i'm quite interest in i'm quite interest in like reception you know like
S0382	oh my god
S0381	what what reception
S0382	it's this trendy kind of
S0381	what's that
S0382	well they're very into it in classics for sort of
S0326	well it's not it's they're into it in classics be
S0382	reception theory
S0326	because it it only reason why you would study it
S0382	but what how would you define it as this like media response or something
S0326	well it's what i it's what read a text make me think about you know cos i'm not from greece and rome
S0381	oh so you're like what do he intend or what's the
S0326	no not necessarily what you know like it's sort of
S0382	no on the contrary what do i feel
S0381	oh what do the audience take from this
S0326	no but it's but it's beneath that cos you you you have to be strict with yourself
S0382	yeah i actually
S0326	what do cavafy do with that stuff be just so interest i think
S0382	ca he do
S0326	yeah
S0381	who
S0326	all all his poems about sort of er anthony and and alexandria
S0382	right
S0326	you know he cos he obviously have a real he be engage with them all the all the time and it shape the way he work i'll tell you what i'm i'm not interest in reception of other people from the classics rather that like
S0382	yeah i mean
S0326	i'm interest in cavafy so i'm interest in how he respond to it
S0382	right
S0326	rather than
S0382	yeah i mean in one way it's complete erm
S0326	and like you know writers like anne carson
S0382	erm yeah i
S0326	who be like i think like my favourite writer
S0382	oh
S0381	who
S0326	anne carson
S0382	who be she
S0381	i don't know i haven't read any of her
S0326	a poet and and a classicist
S0381	wow
S0382	right yeah i mean there be a there be a movement and i don't know when where they talk about the intentional fallacy
S0381	yeah
S0382	and that be mean to be the fallacy of try to recover the author's intentions
S0381	mm roland barthes
S0382	and this be think to be a really bad idea but actually i'm not i be sort of quite old fashion about that and then then philip larkin say when i write a poem erm i like to make a slot machine into which the reader i'm almost quote him insert depend on his attention
S0381	yeah
S0382	his picture be he really get out exactly what he felt so that's the classic old picture
S0381	oh so the reader get exactly what philip larkin felt
S0382	what you do you want yeah yeah whereas the extreme reader response people say we don't give a fuck what the author mean it's just what i feel when i read it
S0381	yeah but that's so weird because
S0382	that's the two extremes right erm
S0381	yeah
S0326	there's there's also it's a way it's not just respond when they're sort of read but when people make sort of another really good poem be alice oswald and people respond in in their own art
S0382	yeah that's be that part of what you want to do your dissertation on
S0326	well i don't know that's like what i'm interest in rather than
S0382	yeah no i think well that's
S0326	it's like if you read sort of the alice oswald one be really good to look at cos it's it's sort of the iliad it's a translation of the iliad but it's
S0382	whose be it
S0326	alice oswald call memorial
S0382	oh be it the cavafy translation
S0326	kind of yeah but it's it's basically every sort of it's every single death in the iliad
S0382	oh i've hear of this it's really
S0326	sort of one on top of the other
S0382	this ring a bell
S0326	and all the similes be repeat sort of verbatim twice
S0382	oh that's erm oh yeah
S0326	and like sort of
S0382	have you tell me about it
S0326	maybe but it's like really
S0382	alice oswald
S0326	sort of such good what i think about it it's such good sort of contemporary write and poetry that make it and it stem from people who be sort of deeply involve in the classics
S0382	right
S0326	that's why i think it's interest
S0381	mm so what it what it cause yeah
S0326	like what be it about the what be it about the classics that make people feel like that
S0382	she's pretty cool alice alice oswald she be pretty cool
S0326	and that's the same with anne carson
S0382	woah she be cool erm yeah so it's like
S0381	and do you think that there's something particular about the classics or be it some kind of just convey a human
S0326	well i think it i i i don't think it can't even just with something as simple as the way someone use language i don't think that i don't i can't see how i can't see how it cannot sort of affect the way you use english as a writer if you've really properly learn latin and greek
S0381	mm right
S0326	and like do translate
S0381	yeah
S0382	maybe she be at when i be teach there
S0381	right
S0382	erm cool
S0326	and sort of cos also to to to be engage in the classics sort of require you to be sort of engage in it's like your imagination have to be awake sort of the whole time to do it it's
S0381	mm
S0326	you're try to it's all the all you really have be book and it's not really things that kind of be strictly cerebral either you want to sort of be aware in a more immediate sense
S0381	yeah right
S0326	and then you like have your like imagination engage and sort of to erm linguistic faculties engage
S0381	right
S0326	all the time as a a classicist
S0381	yeah
S0382	i think there's something translate
S0381	but that that's go to be true i mean that's go to be true for any translation that you're do
S0326	yeah
S0381	so what you one question be be what be particular about you know sort of greek for example that's shape their think that's
S0326	root languages
S0381	yeah yeah
S0382	mm
S0381	i mean it's an interest question just in general about the relationship between language and think so erm hungarian for example have a really weird grammatical structure so their think process be suppose to be especially great for mathematics for example
S0326	right
S0382	yeah
S0381	which be kind of a but that be an interest that's an interest question in itself that's get to be part of it
S0326	yeah but then
S0381	part of the
S0326	yeah but then
S0381	how do greek
S0382	be this you're talk about hungarian
S0381	yeah
S0382	yeah i be talk to about that she say yeah well actually they be all jewish anyway so
S0381	yeah but
S0382	she suggest that it's because of that
S0381	pff oh
S0382	she's jewish herself but she be sort of say well it's not the genius of the hungarian language it's just that
S0381	well if there's if there's one if there's like sort of
S0382	i think it i
S0381	i mean i guess if they're all jewish then that would be sort of a question
S0382	they're not all but mostly yeah that could go that
S0326	like hungarian hungarian chess champion
S0381	right
S0382	it be yeah that's right it be it could be true cos apparently
S0326	russian
S0381	yeah
S0382	apparently hungarian be uniquely free in kind of word order or something
S0381	be it what be it relate to any other language i mean
S0382	yeah it's relate to finnish and it's a it's a member of finno ugric language group have it's completely weird
S0381	anyway i think that would be
S0382	it's not at all like romance languages or semitic languages
S0381	yeah
S0382	anyway
S0381	sound like a good question i mean you don't i don't know
S0326	i've get a friend in from hungary she struggle with english i think
S0381	yeah
S0326	in in hungary you know i i think it be i find it interest she ask people from like who learn different languages what how animals talk in that language an english frog say ribbit ribbit ribbit
S0381	yeah yeah yeah
S0326	and in hungarian they go ra ca ca
S0381	that do kind of sound like a
S0326	ra ca ca ra ca ca
S0382	yeah and in in aristophanes they go croax croax or something don't they somehow
S0381	that be so funny but both sound but ribbit do that yeah they kind of go
S0382	exactly the same in america
S0382	well cos frog do different things don't they
S0381	yeah
S0382	i bet you that this alice her her surname must her maiden name must be different she take her husband's name yeah she must she must have be do classics when i be teach
S0326	that that and they should if you should get a chance to read to read anne carson
S0382	yeah i will i like
S0381	do you ever read the sort of a greek sentence and think erm that's something some think particular to that language that you wouldn't really think in english or it strike you as or maybe just lose that in translation i don't know
S0326	i think that well if you're do i mean i i think you get it when you read like someone like plato in greek it's really like there's so much sort of joke almost joke in greek
S0381	yeah yeah
S0326	that you can't get in translation
S0381	ah yeah yeah that's good joke yeah good example
S0382	well actually it's funny i feel partly feel the opposite where i what i love about aristophanes be he's just bloody fun in the idea that you can laugh
S0381	that a human can translate
S0382	you can laugh across two and a half thousand years be i find that really move
S0326	it's not that funny though i this aristophanes
S0382	well it be pretty funny
S0326	i actually just write an essay about aristophanes about what be aristophanes er er serious about athens
S0382	well i haven't read enough but i just think there be things
S0326	yeah i really like the joke about fart
S0382	exactly exactly but that's cool people be laugh about that in
S0326	there be a that's the thing that's not the funniest stuff in aristophanes
S0382	yeah but also the women say well we won't let our men have sex with us unless they stop fight
S0326	yeah
S0382	that's funny
S0381	unless they stop fight
S0326	the funniest
S0381	or stop fart
S0382	fight
S0381	oh
S0326	i think the funniest things in aristophanes be the be the things that we can't find funny
S0381	oh
S0326	cos we're not there
S0382	so my my reception we're not there
S0381	your reception be fuck up
S0382	so what give me an example
S0326	well it's hard to explain like it's sort of she talk about all this like nuanced stuff you know how the funniest things be the things that kind of dip under
S0382	oh yeah that's true that's true so
S0326	you know when you i
S0382	i see this all
S0326	i do the supervision with and he start talk about all this shit about freud how laughter be epistemologically free and when you're like when you're really laugh and you really know what you're laugh about
S0382	yes you do you know what trigger it
S0326	yeah but you know when you're you're like you you know it you're just sort of walk down the street and start laugh
S0382	oh well that sound like sort of mystical illumination
S0326	no you well i i
S0382	well that's different
S0326	you know i you don't you don't always know you're laugh uncontrollably
S0381	yeah i haven't do that for a long time
S0382	yeah but it's usually something set you off
S0381	then but then you start laugh and then you're just like i don't know why i'm laugh and you're like laugh
S0382	oh
S0326	he say there be two he say there be two people who be famous for never have laugh it plato and jesus
S0326	and maybe the next one be
S0382	two people famous for do what
S0326	for never have really laugh
S0382	oh no no i've laugh
S0381	plato jesus and
S0382	no i've laugh a lot that's stupid i know people who don't have a sense of humour there be people
S0326	but that's the point of be a a sort of the thing about epistemology these be the two figure that you would not expect to be epistemologically free ever
S0382	so and you mean so and they didn't laugh so that prove that's
S0326	not it's not obviously it's not a proof it's just a sort of sort
S0381	observations
S0382	we don't know about we don't know about jesus
S0326	obviously we don't no one know that
S0381	we're never go to know that
S0382	cos you know you know all we ever get from about jesus be all the kind of
S0381	yeah it's true we don't what do we know about jesus sort of
S0382	well yeah we just get the we get the story afterwards and
S0381	he must have be a pretty serious guy though i mean
S0382	i don't know i don't know get no sense of humour
S0381	have no sense of humour
S0382	he he know what's funny he can tell stories he can tell joke well but he doesn't himself naturally spontaneously laugh i mean he do he's not like some people who can't even get
S0381	yeah
S0382	but most you know i when i watch often on telly i watch things i don't know why it's funny cos i don't know it's some tv person i don't know what the reference be erm but most of the there's there's a lot of theorise about what what humour be it's really it's really hard one of the things we know be the kind of incongruity sort of when the when the posh when the really pound posh person sit on the banana skin and that's part of it
S0326	yeah and i mean british people have a particular sense of humour which be
S0382	oh we do
S0326	yeah very strange to americans
S0382	yeah
S0326	you're silly
S0382	yeah yeah we do silly
S0381	like really stupid silly that americans just
S0382	they they do though they do in those tv program
S0326	like bill and ted
S0382	more and more
S0381	yeah bill and ted yeah that's true but that's but that's different even from
S0326	wayne's world
S0381	it's hard to yeah it's hard to
S0382	it's very hard to talk about
S0381	it's
S0326	also it's really interest about aristophanes in sort of context of the greater dionysian and it's sort of state sponsor state sanction all like this act of sort of be in a citizen be to laugh at this thing if you don't laugh you're not one of us
S0382	oh my god
S0381	yeah that's hard
S0326	so i didn't i be a bite sort of deadly serious
S0382	oh my god
S0326	undertones
S0381	yeah
S0382	i mean no but tell me i'm i'm really quite ignorant so you mean his play be put on as part of these
S0326	well yeah it's kind of to understand any sort of greek drama you really have to understand the context that they're perform in which be a really like grand public ceremony put on by the state where you have all these rituals before
S0382	always
S0326	yeah there's two main ones the lenaia which be just just it's before the before the weather's alright to sail so it's just greeks and the great dionysia which be sort of the whole greek world
S0382	the great
S0326	dionysia
S0382	dionysia
S0326	and then you have you know you have things like at the great dionysia you have a sort of parade of the war orphan of that year you have all the you have lot of sacrifice
S0382	right
S0326	parade the tributes from the empire and then you watch some fuck euripides
S0382	i have no idea but euripides be not funny be it
S0326	yeah but i know but but you go in and then you do that for four days and you do one day of of comedy at the end
S0382	it's tragedy sort sort of regimental
S0381	it's all very rigid it's sort of
S0326	it's you have to
S0381	time for comedy
S0326	it's sort of the idea as citizen as
S0382	catharsis
S0326	as spectator you get it's a performance of roles and and the and the
S0382	be be it always like that couldn't you just go to the theatre or something
S0326	no that be when you watch it
S0381	there be no side off broadway
S0382	jeez i be so ignorant
S0326	there be no sort of there be no no sort of theatre as a there's no theatre as a as a erm leisure activity
S0382	that's it
S0326	when just a sole entertainment
S0382	what a so you mean all i mean aristophanes aristophanes be quite subversive quite often
S0326	that's the thing that's why it that's why it's
S0381	oh so he have a way of be humorous maybe in that context
S0382	so he's
S0326	yeah people talk about tragedy and comedy as the way of sort of problematising myth and sort of preconceive truths about what it be to be athenian and greek
S0382	yeah but aren't they you one begin to think that's over theorise it but
S0326	yeah but if you look at
S0381	well be it
S0326	you know like play like sort of the ion and stuff they all kind of almost like sort of greek i athenian autochthony
S0381	be you i hope you're still record this cos it cos this be good stuff
S0382	yeah it's gonna be your your phone be go to break down it's like autochthonous shit
S0381	so be there evidence i mean in other texts of humour that's not sort of this
S0326	well that's the thing there's there's there's satire play
S0381	but they're they're not part of this whole parade of
S0326	they're to
S0381	be there any non parade humour
S0326	non what
S0382	jeez
S0381	like sort of this that's not part of this state sanction erm i don't know
S0382	i need a i think i need a one o one on this i need a book about
S0326	i mean there there might be there's probably like sort of things like they have in rome like sort of pantomime and stuff that be go on but not really like grand like things like aristophanes and euripides be sort of really just like not you don't you only get that at these at these festivals
S0381	even yeah so he have to be probably be really subtle if he want to slip some actual humour
S0326	well that's the thing this be this theatre this stage be sort of one place where you can be subversive cos it be sort of so heavily contain that it be alright to be
S0381	oh yeah
S0326	that's part of democracy sort of test itself
S0381	right
S0326	that's how people like to look at it
S0382	so i'm just read about it then know all this the central event be the pompeii procession in which the phallus be carry by the phallus bearers
S0326	that sound like that sound ridiculous but to us
S0382	be they like huge
S0381	the phalli
S0382	the okay
S0326	it seem very funny like it's their you know long male they're tie on everyone's walk around them
S0382	how big be they like
S0326	three foot long
S0382	that's pretty cool i think the muslims should take that up sorry shouldn't have say that
S0382	er and then come the girls carry baskets and then come the carry bowl of bread and some wow that's so cool i have no idea
S0381	so do you have to pick a a particular advisor for your dissertation
S0326	yeah probably
S0382	well yeah i mean it's
S0326	i can't i want to do one i want to do one like so sort of literature base with a like philosopher philosophy angle
S0381	mm
S0382	right aristophanes parody the rural dionysia in
S0326	in in arcadians that's one i do the that's one of my set texts this year
S0382	oh cool
S0326	which i do the essay on
S0382	go well
S0381	i know i cannot i cannot keep up with 's classics education
S0382	and we know i know i know what the word tragedy mean goat song so they say
S0326	yeah and then somebody have have a joke cos he have quite some time troubadour
S0382	which mean
S0326	which be erm from the sort of the leave at the bottom of the wine bottle be the
S0382	trellis oh the faeces
S0381	oh right right
S0326	basically it's like a wine song but it take obviously pun on it and it's in the arcanes there be a really good bite with euripides in it sort of borrow costume from his play and he's like he kind of point to how contrive tragedy be as a sort of
S0382	so be the comedy that he start from four eight seven bc that's when we first start have comedy as well as tragedies be there one there mm wow well well well yeah i mean at the same time you don't want to say it's all context because i mean there be just the word and the mean of the word and things
S0381	yeah i mean that's what's wrong with it
S0382	can be beautiful or funny
S0381	right
S0382	on their own as it be but so and you just have to balance appreciate context and
S0326	yeah i mean there's either and then there's like there's be a symposium and they afterwards they go on about us sort of what they and then quote bits of the play
S0382	in the symposium
S0326	it's a kind of culture of sort of go to the theatre and then
S0382	right
S0326	at the at the symposium recite it cos they have those kind of memories
S0382	yeah because you didn't have
S0326	and you then you take it out of the civic arena and appreciate it which isn't like i haven't really read any of the about that
S0381	but that would be that's a kind of interest question
S0382	how much poetry be there write independently of
S0326	well all the lyric
S0382	yeah quite so they're just they have they're not so so context bind in the same way except that they sit in the literary traditions in of course what what do you say i you say i'm not do that what be you
S0381	i say i can't keep up with 's classics education
S0382	no no but i be kind of but i'm actually just really know nothing about this probably cos i stop learn latin greek when i be fourteen or fifteen fourteen mm
S0326	anyway i think cavafy be a sort of like old sort of sort of thing that anne carson and alice oswald
S0382	i definitely want to check that out
S0381	i'll have to look up this person
S0382	yeah yeah
S0326	there's also cos then i start get interest in just in like alexandria and there's this writer there's like these book about alexandria
S0382	ah yeah yeah the cryptology before
S0326	cos he's a he's a he's an he always talk er sort of refer to him sort of secretly call him the old man of the city it's actually cavafy
S0382	who's this
S0326	erm historical
S0382	oh right right right in daniel refer to him yeah yeah
S0326	i like that book except when he's like cos there's too much of him be like philosophical about london
S0382	he he be a bite poncey
S0326	yeah
S0382	he's a bite
S0326	he's a bite what he's really good at though be sort of just describe character for like a page
S0382	mm wow
S0326	and they're really sort of that's like take it so it sound totally different convincingly
S0382	god yeah i haven't
S0381	can i see that
S0382	i read a number of i use to love his brother cos his brother be a natural history writer his the family the durrell family move to corfu when
S0381	oh really
S0382	when gerald durrell be a kid and he be just amaze that this english family and he write a lovely book call my family and other animals about be transplant out of grey old england to corfu at the age of nine yeah it's worth read the tretraudy tetrology whatever what do what's the person call the alexandria quartet
S0326	so that's the first one
S0382	what
S0326	that's the first one
S0382	be it
S0326	justine
S0382	justine justine be name marquis de sade's girl
S0326	i'm think what's the best thing to read for anne carson first be
S0382	the first of what
S0326	anne carson
S0382	what to read first
S0381	oh be this a library book that you check out yeah
S0326	yeah
S0381	which be oh that
S0326	that's something else
S0382	yeah it would be nice i would like it it would be nice if the greek
S0326	yeah i want the greek too
S0382	yeah
S0326	he sort of like in the introduction say really interest things
S0382	be these his translations as well
S0326	yeah they're not that good but they're really like you get a sense of cos he do one thing at sort of like expense and then rhyme nicely in english he do in greek they have a they have sort of two modes of two sort of languages in greek sort of an official one of
S0382	yes
S0326	which borrow a lot on classical lot of classic greek word and the vernacular one and calafy be
S0382	still
S0326	well that's
S0382	well that's like arab like arab countries yeah
S0326	and then cavafy sort of shift between like those two to you know to indicate point
S0381	mm
S0326	so he use lot of like awkward word that's just an indication
S0382	oh i see
S0381	be that unusual to shift between the two
S0326	i think cavafy might have start it he's sort of a modernist and like
S0381	yeah
S0382	cool have you ever hear of erm pessoa fernando pessoa he's one of my he be so weird he have they're not they're not pseudonyms he call them heteronyms and they're kind of he's this portuguese weirdo
S0381	oh my god i remember you read read his poetry or
S0382	yeah i read a lot of it because he's he's kind of a very episodic person in in
S0381	what's his name again
S0382	pessoa which just mean person in portuguese when you be i think early on when they you and i be we go down to this old cafe where you use to have do you remember that amaze
S0381	oh my god yes
S0382	amaze old
S0381	we sneak away from you guy
S0382	yeah we sneak away and then say oh coffee and just get these little espressos and it's just like
S0381	yeah yeah i remember that
S0382	three old guy in suit at eight o'clock in the morning well you should check out a check out pessoa before you go to portugal erm one of his one of his personae one be very into sort of classical stuff and then one of them be one of them be kind of you into just rural simple things and and his own person be kind of he be say oh i feel like nothing and there's nothing it's all nothing
S0381	his own person
S0382	what after what
S0381	do you say his own person
S0382	yeah i think he write if you the poems he write under his own name be the least good ones
S0381	that that yeah i'm glad you relate that to what we be talk about cos when you first mention it i think wow that's a real lateral jump
S0382	no it's just
S0381	but then you
S0382	no i'll tell you what it be i be just look at i start read a poem in here and it somehow remind me of pessoa
S0381	yeah
S0382	maybe partly i'm read a book at the moment call the swerve almond have you do lucretius
S0326	yeah a bite
S0381	what's the book the best book to begin with to your favourite author
S0326	i only read one and i can't even remember which number it be
S0326	probably i think it might be i think one three and four be famous
S0382	lucretius he's basically right i mean he get a lot of stuff right
S0326	be that the guy that say you shouldn't fear death no no
S0382	yeah no he do say that
S0326	yeah that's the bite i read
S0382	erm death be nothing
S0326	you shouldn't fear death
S0381	you shouldn't fear death cos you won't be here
S0326	yeah ian ian mcewan write to me he say he's pretty into that but he be he get that from epicurus
S0381	oh right yeah that's not i'm think of epicurus
S0326	although it's actually an interest question how much it be he be a sort of but epicurus doesn't really think the should write poetry and there's lot of things like we only the only evidence we have for it be lucretius
S0381	why doesn't he think people should write poetry
S0382	oh and like
S0326	can't remember i don't know
S0382	oh
S0381	cos it's annoy poetry be annoy
S0326	you don't get you don't get you don't get the swerve anywhere else
S0382	oh no you know the swerve
S0326	i think
S0382	like all the atoms have all the atoms be like go along in straight line none of them ever bump into each other so how do how do the world begin and
S0381	oh yeah
S0382	and at one point one of them go
S0326	so that's how you get erm
S0382	it swerve
S0381	no electrons be collapse
S0382	that's how you get everything yeah
S0326	yeah
S0382	but then some people think that's how you get free will and blah blah blah
S0381	oh the swerve
S0382	cool
S0326	and once one do it once then it's like chaos
S0382	yeah and then everything run off
S0326	it all swerve in and parallel line
S0381	why would you think that they're all go in straight line to begin with
S0326	i don't know er very good question but yeah so that could be literary and
S0381	i mean like
S0326	well the question be
S0381	it could easily
S0326	i think i mean i be like i sort of cos like i think it all sort of come from like epicureans and the stoics argue about things like how can you how can you know a certain thing
S0381	yeah
S0326	like you can just say well you you can if you see it therefore it's there
S0381	yeah
S0326	and the stoics be like well no
S0382	no
S0326	they're like well if you see something from a distance or like a stick in the water it's like a swerve man
S0326	it's like a first principle that they don't have to argue for i guess
S0381	right yeah but
S0326	yeah but it make sense go backwards i guess in their arguments
S0381	yeah
S0382	i don't know what you could do i mean everyone say you know plato be like great literature and well anyway
S0381	it be it be actually i think
S0382	yeah it be but erm it's
S0381	maybe it's not the best of that i mean
S0382	well it's not you might think that wasn't literary enough
S0381	oh well there
S0382	you want something literary but with an philosophical side
S0326	it's like there's there's a girl in the year above and her her dissertation on sort of like regret in seneca
S0382	oh oh yeah
S0381	that sound like a good one
S0382	that's a good one
S0326	yeah
S0382	seneca be so rich
S0381	regret be a good topic too
S0382	or plutarch what
S0381	regret be a good topic i think
S0382	i've get a huge great fat book call regret so when i be at and i have my heavy old glass table and i have this pile of book and i collect them from the over the years there be regret shame erm idolatry
S0381	well apparently they do a lot of interview of old people recently and what they regret be not what they do but what they didn't do
S0382	oh yes yeah you say that years ago you say
S0381	yeah where be you go
S0326	beer somewhere
S0381	beer yeah
S0382	oh yeah so i think you that be you when i i first kind of first meet you you think that that's what people would
S0381	yeah and then
S0382	i don't think i regret what i mean i
S0381	you don't regret what you do
S0382	no i don't think i
S0381	maybe you're not do you regret anything
S0381	that may answer that question
S0382	well you know the famous french
S0381	what's that
S0382	that's the great the most famous french song ever by edith piaf i won't sing it
S0381	oh
S0382	you know
S0381	i don't think it's true that you i do regret some of the things i've do i think
S0382	you know she say
S0381	i dunno
S0382	erm well it's really
S0326	well i think if you think about old people like now that when they be young it be like all you couldn't do anything
S0381	yeah it's true that's a good point
S0326	you know what i mean
S0382	compare to
S0381	like it's not as restrictive now
S0382	so you be
S0326	they have live their whole life sort of try to behave properly and they're way much more
S0382	well oh so now you don't have to bother
S0326	no
S0381	no i don't i bet you don't i bet i think that's a good point there there there isn't as much
S0382	no there's be a there's be a sort of shatter increase of opportunity not just
S0381	yeah but also sort of i mean that's what the sixties be about right
S0382	yeah
S0381	think about the difference between the fifties and the sixties
S0382	yeah that's incredible
S0381	and now anything go anything
S0382	no but you see the thing about so you know i you know there be really particularly bad time when i go round and er be
S0381	have a hard time
S0382	have leave and it be erm you know he be sob and i just felt
S0381	regret
S0382	so terrible and yeah and but do i regret it i it's difficult i can't really make sense of regret because it's so lock in with the cause
S0381	yeah it's hard that's why i be to say
S0382	the whole pattern of your life it's cos you think if i hadn't do that well then that wouldn't have happen there wouldn't be for example you see and things like that so
S0381	it's hard to say i think that's why people i think that's why people don't regret what they do do it cos they realise that
S0382	it's all lock in
S0381	it's all you can't sort of subtract some piece and say
S0382	well here's a i've just read a good one so this guy yeah the guy who write the book call the swerve be call steven greenblatt he's a shakespeare scholar he say he go off to board school for and then a few days later he his mother die suddenly she be only thirty three and he say i spend the rest of my life regret i didn't get one last hour
S0381	oh
S0382	one hour to talk to her now that's
S0381	yeah
S0382	that's pretty powerful
S0381	yeah and that's also something that's
S0382	and so
S0381	it's it's an isolate something you can isolate like you can
S0382	yeah it's a very sort of pure case
S0381	yeah
S0382	so you've get that kind of case
S0381	yeah and i can see that i think a lot of
S0326	what regret because he himself go to board school
S0382	no just just he just regret
S0381	not have one
S0382	he couldn't say goodbye he couldn't have
S0326	but that's nothing to i mean it's it's just to be bitter about
S0382	oh well er no wait wait wait regret doesn't there's remorse which be when you feel bad about something
S0381	yeah it's not that
S0382	you can regret things that and have get no moral so like you might have meet so and so
S0381	yeah
S0382	but they be go to come but they didn't so you can regret something completely morally neutral be that
S0381	that's true
S0326	yeah yeah yeah
S0381	that's true
S0382	yeah so there's a big difference between
S0381	yeah
S0382	regret and remorse so
S0381	but i i
S0382	but these these be things like you know i they might regret oh i never go scuba dive or something
S0381	yeah yeah
S0382	yeah
S0381	but i think you know sort of when i think about sometimes i worry that i'm go to regret not do x
S0382	do you i never
S0381	yeah i'm go to regret not talk to my mum more
S0326	yeah and that's the that's the reason that and you and then you do it
S0381	yeah
S0382	it then
S0381	it motivate me to do it
S0326	kind of like when tonight when i go to sort of dusseldorf and i when i be offer well i might i'll probably be like if tomorrow i'm just bore at home like i might as well go to dusseldorf
S0381	yeah
S0382	but i can't it's not really the best motive be it
S0381	no it's not no i think it's not
S0382	you ought to be do it because it's good to do or
S0381	no it's but i but i think i i i i'm worry i'm go to regret it because i know it's good to do but i'm be lazy or it's difficult or it's you know
S0382	yeah that's
S0381	and but i know it's the i it would be a good thing
S0382	that's i don't i don't have that i just don't have it i'm not think well i should do this because i know that in future i will wish that i have do it no
S0326	i that's why i do that my my grade eight piano exam cos i wasn't go to do it and then two days before i be like i'll regret it if i don't
S0382	yeah that's yeah that's not i'm go to look back fifty years later and
S0381	yeah he might have though
S0326	it doesn't make any difference though like anybody you know
S0382	no it make
S0381	he might say oh that what be it i don't know i just know i have that think
S0326	i think actually when i do things i don't really want to do be cos i think i'll regret it if i don't
S0381	yeah it's not i it's not that i don't want to do it but okay there yeah there's a slightly i don't want to do it it's hard
S0326	it's like it's stuff you want to do but it's hard yeah
S0381	there's something it's partly unpleasant or difficult or effort or maybe you're just not as lazy
S0382	well here's a yeah i this be
S0381	plus you don't have the same this be this like a one area i have you don't have this area with your parent
S0382	embarrass but i have do you want to hear my embarrass what
S0381	you i mean your mum's not like lose it slowly so that you know that there's this sort of time period
S0382	i don't no i don't but
S0381	of course she be rather old
S0382	who but it's i'm suspicious of the motive of want to do it so that it will have happen
S0381	no just cos i know that i like talk to my mum and that da da da da you know
S0382	but your mum be really already be not really there in the same way
S0381	no but she's still there like somewhat there
S0382	that's very that's very weird talk to people whose parent have go further and they're obviously very
S0381	yeah i don't know what
S0382	they they always they take up a sort of defensive dismissiveness because they it's very obviously very upset you know they say oh she didn't know who i be and
S0381	yeah
S0382	erm and they they have to it's like doctor
S0381	yeah that's the only way you
S0382	doctor have to you know when they're in their first year of
S0381	you can't really display your true emotions cos it would be too awful like you're just in casual conversation you can't sort of start blather
S0382	yeah but i think i think it's
S0381	so you sort of must do something
S0382	right yeah but yeah
S0326	but that that would be a good sort of theme like the regret like some some sort of theme
S0382	yeah a kind of erm
S0381	yeah
S0382	as it be a
S0326	i can i can think quite easily for like rome like you can quite easily like sort of youth in and things like that
S0382	what
S0326	like youth or like
S0382	oh you mean carpe diem or something that theme what
S0326	well just like sort of in the longer poems like stuff and
S0382	i don't know
S0326	but it would you know but i can't really understand the greek
S0382	right
S0326	and you get you never get such consistent
S0382	what about plutarch
S0326	never read that
S0382	just as just as interest as seneca really seneca get i mean have i get the date right didn't he get most of it from plutarch anyway erm
S0382	yeah now that seem to be a good good idea to look at yeah and you could always read cicero cos he'll tell you nice clear language what so and so say
S0326	yeah i know cos i do seneca this year and be it cos it's also it's also their reception within classics so how it
S0382	reception
S0326	or no or receive other texts like how be seneca
S0382	oh
S0326	when he write how do he receive how do he respond to euripedes' they're kind of intertextual relationships
S0382	yeah yeah
S0326	which can't be ignore
S0382	yeah it's just always go on all the time really i mean how do we receive shakespeare now there's just load of stuff we're just not get at all
S0326	but yeah but it's but it's if someone's people if someone's thing about seneca and euripides be that they're write the same play in different language
S0382	you reckon seneca and euripides
S0326	well cos they both write in
S0381	what be that
S0382	oh i see oh yeah but i don't think of seneca as mainly a a playwright or i be think mainly of his letter and stuff it's true it's true though yeah
S0381	so be that an actual
S0382	a play
S0381	no the term reception be that sort of a theoretical term in classics or literary theory i've never hear it before
S0382	oh yeah oh god yes literary theory mate you live with a literary theory person
S0381	yeah she just like lose it and drop out of academics
S0382	she get so tangle up with the french people
S0381	she get so freak no i think what do her in be she teach this course on erm deleuze and what's the other guy's name
S0382	derrida
S0381	derrida and
S0382	deleuze and guattari
S0381	a third year
S0382	oh
S0381	and she just
S0382	well i think flip
S0381	she do she go off the deep end i don't know what be in those book
S0382	no it's true i mean in one sense it's trivial that every person receive a different mean from the
S0381	well there have to be like a lot of overlap though
S0382	i hope so yeah i i kind of like i like the sense that i can i another human be of the same species be talk to me across the centuries
S0381	yeah
S0382	erm but a lot of people
S0326	that's the point that's the reason why it be when when seneca write a it's because someone speak across the centuries
S0382	yeah sure but some people don't like that they're sort of super relativists and they say well you can it's just your reaction and you have no idea what they've
S0381	i wonder if that's kind of fall out of fashion
S0382	and it doesn't matter i don't know actually
S0381	i don't either
S0382	i don't know
S0326	especially cos do you know that statius you ever hear of him
S0382	i've hear
S0326	cos he write a poem sort of call the achilleid which be he set out to sort of write the whole story of achilles' life
S0382	yeah
S0326	and he do like sort of achilles as a child and do cross dress
S0382	really
S0381	achilles
S0326	yeah in when he's try to get out when thetis be try to stop him go to the war she hide him in a harem
S0382	oh that's right yeah
S0381	oh okay
S0326	and then he like cos he wasn't just see he's try to do all sort of
S0382	how but she why be she worry cos she know about the heel
S0326	she know that he's go to die
S0382	oh she know he's go to die cos she hold him by the heel
S0326	yeah and that's interest cos the thing be thetis doesn't want if if it could as well be call the thetis tale or something so both the thetis and statius know what's go to happen to achilles but they're both sort of try to delay it
S0382	cos statius be the author
S0326	yeah
S0382	and she's the mother
S0326	yeah he's a writer the tradition he doesn't want to he want to write his own epic he doesn't want to be
S0382	right
S0326	and then there's sort of it it stop and it's just as when just when he's erm on his way to troy the poem stop people don't know if he do that deliberately
S0382	just on his say it again
S0326	on his way to troy and like when they get back into sort of epic general like
S0382	i see i see
S0326	i'm interest in sort of that like sense of belatedness
S0382	yeah
S0326	like try to combat it
S0382	er what you want to
S0326	try to sort of like how can statius sort of carve himself out of it and like you know
S0382	right but you don't know whether he stop play because
S0326	i think he do definitely do
S0381	i'm put this in the freezer now cos seal it be not enough to prevent me from
S0382	no wow well so it's all it's all so rich there's so much life in it
S0381	that's true there's so much to think about i need to pee
S0382	you can pee in there
S0381	nobody else have to pee i've already pee once so i'm not go in the other room
S0382	and me
S0382	oh there's a big oh it's seneca who's like really popular at the moment
S0326	cos he i've get a module on well it's about neronian literature which be seneca lucan and the other one
S0382	yeah oh yeah
S0326	which i think be really interest
S0382	when be tibullus be he
S0326	i'm not sure when he he's not really on it though
S0382	lucan who be
S0326	lucan's sort of like he's like sort of like it's also interest how he react to epic cos he he really want to like tear it apart
S0382	right
S0326	and till right at the end he doesn't like
S0382	that's right
S0326	he's like very angry
S0382	there's also this guy call callinicus do you come across him at all
S0326	only sort of cos that's why i try and cos he's like what people talk about alexandria
S0382	oh cos he's he's interest cos he's like he's basically a postmodernist
S0326	yeah that that's why that's what sort of people like and stuff they be all do by that's what they're they're also inspire by callinicus
S0382	oh right so i like to say when someone say you know who be i just say well actually be callinicus be a postmodernist
S0382	he's sort of already go kind of meta and he's sort of aware of language
S0326	yeah that's that's what that's what i really be interest in i think
S0382	yeah well that well yeah that's different from i mean that's fascinate
S0326	but that's the only post like post modern or post literary or post meta because they're receive it
S0382	oh okay
S0326	that's part of their reception
S0382	yeah it's true yeah i think it must happen maybe it happen in every tradition that yeah
S0326	it's just i mean it's a thing it's it's i mean it's it's kind of interest like erm kind of the that express against influence thing it's just this kind of quite quite clever thing where someone say exist
S0382	a recent person
S0326	i think like eighties or something x in the first
S0382	oh
S0326	so there's not really
S0382	you mean the anxiety of influence
S0326	no no no not that it's kind of when it's when someone say when x the idea of like x influence y be really just kind of belie the sophistication of that relationship
S0382	yeah i think well
S0326	cos if you then cos if you flip it round sort of say y remodelled x or y parody x or y you know travesty x or y
S0382	yeah
S0326	that that's still a relationship of influence but it's not so straightforward
S0382	no
S0326	that's what i talk about when i talk about how roman art relate to greek art it's not really just copy it's an improvement
S0382	well sometimes but wait sometimes it start off like that because you can see sometimes a poet start off oh yeah they have a really good i be what's a good example where they're just kind of totally in the in the grip of someone else and then they break through oh yeah i be read about beckett beckett be like enslave to joyce and it be in the yeah i be read it just like week in new york review so that's one classic story that a poet or author on one hand be enslave just worship x and and then they start to break free and stuff that seem to be a real story
S0326	mm
S0382	that happen erm but you're right in general that the whole idea of influence be you know complicate because rejection as it be violent rejection be a form of influence just as much as
S0326	yeah
S0382	try to copy try to imitate or emulate or yeah well well but it's yeah so that's but that's a different that's a that's a different kind of interest from isn't that from want to sort of pursue a philosophical theme in a literary framework
S0326	yeah i suppose so
S0382	maybe you could do them all together
S0326	i mean that's what i how i really like to do
S0382	image of regret now what do i regret
S0326	cos you could look at
S0382	i'll tell you something i regret
S0381	what
S0382	so when i be in israel i be be like really
S0381	pious
S0382	pious yeah and i meet this girl from the bronx
S0381	oh
S0382	in jerusalem and she i don't know why i mean she just be really into me
S0381	i don't either
S0382	really really into me
S0381	probably really annoy
S0382	but i just sort of think what
S0381	you be probably
S0382	and she be really cute
S0381	and you be sort of oh i can't have sex because
S0382	yeah exactly but you see then then i go back to and then she i give her my address and then my parent force me to go on holiday i be seventeen to go on holiday to france and i come back she call she call round at our house and
S0381	wow
S0382	i wasn't there
S0381	what how do you know she
S0382	i what
S0381	how do you know she come by the house
S0382	because because the woman who use to clean answer
S0381	oh
S0382	so i regret that
S0381	that's very deep
S0382	very deep very deep
S0381	you're blush
S0382	be i
S0326	what be her name
S0382	i can't even remember she she be call sort of blienstein or something she say i'm the only one in the bronx prom book
S0381	well yeah next time i drink too much
S0382	next time
S0381	i'll confess to who i
S0382	well babe i haven't drink too much
S0381	i'm just kid i'm kid talk talk talk
S0382	i do not want another one
S0381	maybe we should open another bottle of wine and have a teeny bite right now because tomorrow night
S0382	that's very subtle reason babe erm
S0381	that be actually really
S0382	no it be
S0381	that be pretty good
S0382	it be really nice and it be i mean actually i think
S0381	i think you should just get a cheap one because
S0382	i think they're make a profit those people but it's erm it's exactly the model that a nice
S0381	god i'm tire i'm oh yeah cos i wake up so early
S0382	you want tea i just have to
S0381	yeah because i mean
S0382	the screw top because
S0381	we might not finish it by tomorrow night i mean
S0382	what's so terrible about tomorrow oh thursday
S0381	cos we're go to be leave on friday also we need to i think we should just hire a car
S0382	well hire a car mean i'm get a bite worry about all these expense that i'm not properly now i've fail to to get the bill for my breakdown cover and be that 's or
S0381	yeah he didn't drink it he go back i can't get this i can never do these
S0382	it's awfully serious sweet
S0381	yeah it's very intellectual
S0382	i mean i think
S0381	oh he's record us so
S0382	ah oh
S0381	i almost fell down the stairs
S0382	so how
S0381	we just start we just start talk about you and then we realise that we be be record
S0382	be it still record
S0381	yeah
S0382	oh my god no it's not oh i won't say anything now
S0326	it's probably get a bite to go actually in a minute
S0381	so can you just send i mean do they ever reject what you send as be you know sort of unsuitable
S0326	no
S0381	so you're just go to send that two hours
S0382	i think by definition it can't be unsuitable by definition because you're just try to
S0326	i think they're just look for pattern
S0382	sweep the language you wonder be they try to get a picture of the language
S0326	well i i have an email from them erm last weekend it be like their status and it be like sort of three hundred out of a thousand hours three million out of ten million word transcribe which be what they're go for
S0381	wow
S0382	so it's like english as she be speak today
S0381	yeah
S0382	this be the truth
S0381	well especially look at the
S0382	well no they're not
