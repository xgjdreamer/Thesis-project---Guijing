S0135	yeah you have to be really alert
S0084	mm
S0135	your vision be quite sort of reduce and stuff
S0084	yeah it's really scarey cos the roads be a bite shit you go on the a14 which be you know really notorious it's a really bad road it's a really dangerous road it's quite
S0135	black spot yeah
S0084	bendy lot er just too much traffic for the road really they're talk about you know cameron announce a few weeks ago that he might introduce more toll and he might privatize the roads in order to pay for like
S0135	yeah
S0084	repair and update if they do anything to the a14 that's what it'll be it'll be a toll road i think and they probably will start do that quite soon cos er
S0135	they have all that in italy don't they
S0084	it's really dangerous
S0135	toll toll road
S0084	toll roads well i think the m part of the m6 be a toll road isn't it and obviously there's the
S0135	really
S0084	m25
S0135	but the m25
S0084	dartford bridge
S0135	be such a nightmare like it's shit
S0084	such a nightmare it's really shit
S0135	it be so difficult to get through like it's just like you know when i take to stansted
S0084	oh yeah and you barely get there within a moment before it be fly didn't you
S0135	well no this time i be lucky because he make me leave at seven be
S0135	um
S0084	aw
S0135	in the smart car we sort of gun it down there and thankfully the time be perfect so check in and everything like that
S0084	oh good
S0135	on the way back however they shut dartford er tunnel no
S0084	mm
S0135	what bite do you er yeah you it's the dartford tunnel they shut so we could still go over go back towards
S0084	oh
S0135	but you couldn't sort of come in um but they divert everyone off into essex so
S0084	shit
S0135	on my way on the m25 towards this dartford cross
S0084	yeah
S0135	all the police cars be up and everything like bang just get off the road m25's shut go into essex i be like that
S0084	mm
S0135	i don't really wanna go into essex cos i don't know where i'm go
S0084	mm
S0135	and it's a big place and i'd kinda like to go home
S0084	yeah
S0135	so
S0084	yeah it's a big place
S0135	when you pull off you have like the options for like um the a13 or something to southend or basildon or something
S0084	mm
S0135	um and then you have the option once you'd sort of go down this ramp to get back onto the m25
S0084	okay
S0135	to continue to the dartford tunnel
S0084	yeah
S0135	but that entrance be block off as well by like police vehicles and because i be like i'm not gonna go into essex so i literally just go round the roundabout until they open up the um
S0084	really
S0135	slip road that liz be a really good tip for you there
S0084	that be a really good tip
S0135	because otherwise you'll end up follow all the crowd into essex
S0084	yeah
S0135	you don't know how you're gonna get out again but this way
S0084	that's my concern yeah cos they won't have set diversion sign or anything
S0135	yeah
S0084	you're on your own
S0135	yeah yeah er so you literally just go into essex er no sorry i just go round and round the roundabout and then luckily i say round and round i go round three time and then they open the road again cos i'd hear with my window down come off the m25 that's how slow we be go that they be open it soon
S0084	oh right er
S0135	if i hadn't have hear that i might've have to go to essex
S0084	yeah cos that's the thing if er if it's happen in the morning and they're gonna be close all day that's sort of seven hours of go round the roundabout
S0135	yeah yeah lol
S0135	so um but er on the way back it take a very very very very long time but the good thing be on the way there it be fine and he get his flight and everything okay so that be good

S0135	okay
S0084	rat basically

S0084	after the first time you would pay attention
S0135	yeah
S0084	no eight time he do it go through two packets of hot cross buns
S0135	okay
S0084	until he actually sit there and watch it he be like that he's er i call him you know from find nemo cos she's only get like a three second memory just keep swim
S0135	oh that ring a bell now you say that
S0084	just keep swim
S0135	yeah yeah yeah
S0084	but then he's be round the house a few time which be why obviously know him and 's meet him a few time but um at the same time because he's like he'll just forget that you've make arrangements or er he'll do something ridiculous like a friday night a couple of weeks ago he be suppose to come over and we be gonna make some food and have a few drink

S0084	that's quite excite so it's er er practically become a family business
S0135	well though
S0084	buy and sell
S0135	he just buy he doesn't sell he doesn't shift it on
S0084	mister trebus
S0135	he be mister trebus um
S0084	er but he be do that wasn't he he be make quite a nice little profit before i suppose maybe if the job the his day job be quite good so be he
S0135	yeah he's not love it at the minute cos they're like he ask for um bonuses so that
S0084	mm
S0135	he's get more of an incentive to make cos he's do cold call basically
S0084	mm
S0135	and they be like that no you should just be lucky for your job i'm offend that you even ask which be so bang out of order
S0084	yeah
S0135	but they're like in this current job climate blah blah but er
S0084	it's show initiative isn't it
S0135	i know you're so tan in that picture and when i get burn at the car boot the other week my colleague say to me the next day you look so much better with like colour on you
S0135	i be like that
S0084	but i've get cancer
S0135	let's all move to bloody
S0084	barbados
S0135	barbados so 's off literally in two months
S0084	oh huh she's yeah she say she's book her flight for the something of june fourteenth of june i think and or of june
S0135	isn't it a bite mad to go with no nothing line up or not
S0084	my concern er obviously cos she's get on her skills list you know that they allow you in more readily
S0135	yeah
S0084	if you've get a skill that they're look for
S0135	have she get any of the skills
S0084	teach be yeah
S0135	oh be it
S0084	teaching's always
S0135	oh that's interest
S0084	on the skills list but you um she er so i ask her about how different the curriculum's gonna be and whether that's gonna be something that you have to worry about but she say she's look into it and it's not but i don't
S0135	i suppose it's primary school
S0084	really know
S0135	it's a bite more
S0084	well they um
S0135	flexible
S0084	with her visa they say be you gonna be teach for longer than three months and if so give us all your health record and you've gotta have a chest x ray for tuberculosis and all this carry on so um she's wait to hear about that so i guess er what she can do be supply teach but she's i guess she need to work out like where she want to be and how much move around she want to do and that sort of thing but really you wanna be you wanna be earn as quickly as possible because it's so expensive there so you need to have their wage come in to match what's
S0135	yeah
S0084	what your outgo rather than use all your money cos that'll go really quickly cos it's so expensive so um i don't know i think she want to sort of go for a month and so spend a bite of time in brisbane but she'll get bore really really quickly i guess while she's cos it's sort of middle east part of australia
S0135	yeah
S0084	brisbane it's sort of halfway down the
S0135	okay
S0084	east coast so you could go back north and go to like uluru you know like ayers rock and
S0135	yeah
S0084	you can go to like the er northern territories and that's but that's really like real yokel
S0135	okay
S0084	area so you might not necessarily want to go there
S0135	yeah
S0084	it's a bite scary rah um and then sydney and melbourne er be south east right at the bottom
S0135	okay
S0084	and i guess that's probably er so it's quite nice that you can er end up there quite easily
S0135	yeah yeah good position i suppose to start of in
S0084	and then fly from there to huh new zealand which i think she want to do at some point um huh and er er and i be say well it'd be good to go to asia from there as well cos that be my plan she say she would be nervous to do that on her own but when you're travel like you always meet people who be on their own as well and you might find someone that want to go to thailand
S0135	or just go on a tour
S0084	for a few weeks or something
S0135	yeah go on a tour
S0084	well that's what do though wasn't it she go on a tour
S0135	yes
S0084	so
S0135	yeah
S0084	didn't she get like
S0084	oh still
S0135	yeah
S0084	have you not speak to her since we
S0135	no she send me a really narky um thing she um so
S0084	the last time i speak to you about it be in and you be suppose to meet and then you didn't and you cancel and cancel and
S0135	yeah
S0084	then she be be a bite off with you and you didn't wanna meet her and
S0135	yeah and i sort of er
S0084	there be that e mail
S0135	i be like fine i'll leave it and then she send that narky e mail and i be like
S0084	yeah
S0135	fair enough then er and then about a couple of months after that so maybe three or four weeks ago she e mail me she go oh i didn't mean for us to never talk again or something how be you whatever and i be sort of be like blah blah whatever and then she write back and say blah blah
S0084	mm
S0135	i'm move to soon
S0084	from
S0135	yeah fair enough anyway so i send her an easter card to her flat in bristol
S0084	mm
S0135	and just get a text message back go this isn't my address anymore um i've just be on this crazy hen night whatever blah blah so i say oh okay cool blah blah er what's your address then
S0084	mm

S0084	she didn't give you her address
S0135	yeah yeah yeah like i'm not i'm not the stalker you're obsess with me
S0084	yeah yeah she be
S0135	and er she and she wouldn't give me her address which i think be really weird
S0084	why would she go to the effort of write to you and say this isn't my address
S0135	yeah
S0084	because she clearly get the card
S0135	yeah
S0084	because she wouldn't know that you'd send it
S0135	i know it be really weird so i be just like absolutely fair enough fair enough so it be really strange so i have to sort of let it go
S0084	mm

S0135	's be so soon
S0084	's be in a month which be the first one
S0135	huh

S0084	um so that's the second week in may
S0135	you can't have a housewarming party on easter weekend though

S0135	uh come on this be ridiculous
S0084	what we should've do be actually go thursday night because now i realize that can get a hotel cos she work for we're stay on the friday night in the crown er in the holiday inn which be part of the same group
S0135	part of the group yeah
S0084	for eighteen pound so nine pound each versus the the seventy five pound a night each it would've be stay in the place that the reception's be hold in that 's book
S0135	oh
S0084	so actually
S0084	if we'd stay the thursday night we wouldn't have to rush
S0135	yeah
S0084	and it would be cheaper than the flight but
S0135	yeah
S0084	what be you gonna do
S0135	how be you gonna even get to stansted for a six o'clock flight
S0084	's gonna drive
S0135	ah perfect
S0084	and we'll just and she's get free park from some connection at work or something
S0135	oh that's lucky cos that
S0084	which be brilliant
S0135	that be
S0084	it might potentially be like zone z which be at the end of the road
S0135	do it need a bus to get into the um terminal from the
S0084	yeah probably but stansted's not that big it's not like heathrow
S0135	no
S0084	which have get five terminals
S0135	no
S0084	so
S0135	stansted's absolutely fine actually there's only so far
S0084	yeah cos otherwise you'd actually be like
S0135	actually
S0084	in the town of stansted so
S0135	no quite far
S0084	oh
S0135	but no you'll be fine
S0084	just lie to me i think that'll be fine
S0135	why do you sorry why have you get two mattresses on your bed
S0084	cos the top one be a memory foam one and the bottom one be the one that it come with
S0084	i get it from freecycle the bed it be
S0135	do you
S0084	so it be free
S0135	huh
S0084	because the one that be here before be er rotten er divan the ones that come in two piece
S0135	oh ming
S0084	it have like nail stick out of it it didn't have a headboard it be disgust and i say trudy you've gotta take this away
S0135	really
S0084	and i'd see this on freecycle but the mattress be shit really like the cheapest argos mattress um so i buy a
S0135	that's amaze
S0084	memory foam mattress and pillow for two hundred pound
S0135	from from
S0084	from
S0135	normal shop sort of thing
S0084	yeah i think actually do you know what it er might've be b and q cos they have a silentnight deal on
S0135	that's really good value
S0084	so you get the mattresses mattress and pillow together it be really good value but obviously if i do go away i don't know what i'm gonna do with it try and sell it on i suppose cos there's no room to store it my mum's garage be full of my stuff richard's imogen's and now my uncle's stuff cos my uncle split up with his wife at christmas so he's move you know he be live in with her his his um

S0135	no okay
S0041	i turn down a cream egg today how strong will be that
S0084	bloody hell
S0135	what for
S0041	i know
S0135	what be the reason behind this
S0041	stupid diet
S0084	you be be so hardcore
S0135	er like er
S0041	i know
S0135	do you have to be there like certain criteria for your like navy intake like weight or height or eyesight or fitness
S0041	no
S0135	level
S0041	you have to i've have my eye do
S0135	yeah
S0041	my eye test which be fine
S0135	mm
S0041	um i've get to run a mile and a half in thirteen and a half minutes
S0135	be that be that hard
S0084	it's fuck hard yeah
S0135	okay
S0041	i'm at fifteen and a half now fifteen thirty seven
S0084	mm
S0041	still not what it be like before my leg get hit but you know we're get there i'll just keep do it
S0084	mm
S0135	mm
S0041	um and then my the you've get to have a healthy bmi
S0135	okay
S0041	but my cos your bmi's suppose to be like maximum of twenty five and mine's twenty eight
S0135	oh
S0041	but um she say when you go there like they're a doctor they're gonna take into account that if you've get a bigger bone structure or if you've get massive wangers
S0084	mhm
S0041	big bangers huh

S0084	er like and if you're if you're really muscly that you'll weigh more won't you cos muscle weigh more than fat so
S0041	yeah
S0084	in theory they've gotta actually take quite a lot of factor into consideration surely

S0084	mm
S0135	god
S0041	my thighs be fuck kill though after this week

S0041	yeah it's a bite of a
S0135	yeah
S0041	it's a bite of a mick take but i figure if i don't do it then i've only really get one shoot so if i don't i don't wanna look back and think i didn't put everything in
S0084	mm
S0135	mm
S0041	be the worst it'll be fine
S0084	it's just er bad time with the easter weekend
S0041	mm
S0135	alcohol's get a lot of calories in it though
S0041	yep
S0135	do you drink do you drink much

S0135	okay
S0041	yes lot all the time
S0135	okay

S0084	mm
S0135	well good luck with it all
S0041	thank
S0135	it'd be so amaze if you get it it'd be such an achievement wouldn't it
S0084	mm
S0041	mm
S0135	but if you get so close and then not get it you
S0041	gutted
S0084	mm
S0135	just go out on an absolute bender and just completely
S0084	well especially
S0041	yeah
S0084	if it's a physical thing that's let you down
S0041	yeah
S0084	as oppose to be mentally prepare and
S0041	yeah
S0084	able to do it
S0041	if i fail because i go to the interview and they're like no you're just not cut out to do it like
S0135	yeah
S0041	you're not the right candidate then
S0084	mm
S0041	fair enough
S0084	mm
S0041	but if i go there and it's because of this fuck leg i'm gonna be so piss
S0084	mhm
S0135	but the thing be though
S0041	get it
S0135	they should consider that once you get into it you will be um you know um take part in their like regime
S0084	mm
S0135	so you
S0041	yeah
S0135	physically wouldn't be able to you know be overweight or you know not be able to run the distance because of the regime
S0041	yeah
S0135	in your day to day work
S0084	mhm
S0135	i assume that they're gonna be keep you
S0041	yeah
S0135	do stuff so
S0084	and they're gonna have actual you know proper properly train people to help you
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know maintain your fitness
S0041	they say when you get there to do the fitness test for three days after i do the run bite the rest of it's a bite extreme but after that they say they don't want you to be superman they dont' expect you to able to do all the navy workout already but
S0135	yeah
S0041	you need to show that you're kind of well motivate to push yourself as hard as you possibly can
S0084	mm
S0041	it's more like an attitude thing i suppose
S0135	yeah
S0041	so there'll be no ah i'm die
S0084	mm
S0041	bye
S0084	see you
S0135	bye yeah i suppose you gotta illustrate your capacity to be able to perform at a certain level
S0041	yeah
S0135	i think they should test you on that rather than your actual level now like do you have the propensity to perform at this level
S0041	yeah yeah they do
S0084	mm
S0041	they put you under they have like er a group thing group small group of four or five and they put you under like immense stress like time constraints constraints and expect you to be able to like they'll give you a problem and you have to work out
S0135	oh my god
S0041	then they give you a different problem then you have to er lead the group to work it out so basically put you under the most stress they possibly can and see how quickly you can think that's gonna be fun
S0084	shit hell
S0041	more fuck maths test huh
S0084	that's just rude
S0135	what you've get in your favour be that you're female i reckon
S0041	mm dunno i think it could go either way
S0135	really
S0041	yeah cos they have to you have to prove that you're physically as strong as a bloke they don't give you any any leeway at all
S0084	oh i think they do
S0041	the only thing you get leeway with be there's one some massive missile something or other that you have to lift that's some ridiculous kilogram ness and you're not allow to lift it on your own but that's it
S0084	fuck me
S0135	have you always want to do this or do it come to you sort of randomly in a dream
S0084	she come back from christmas and be like right i'm join the navy
S0135	really oh right oh okay
S0084	mm we be like no you're not what what
S0041	yes yes i be
S0084	yeah i'm go
S0135	oh do you meet someone that be already in it or do you watch something on tv that's what i'm yes i wanna do that
S0084	i like swim sign me up
S0041	i like shoe i think i'm go to be one
S0084	yeah
S0041	no my cousin's in the navy he's be in the navy for seven years and i be gonna do it when i graduate but my dad have an accident so i never i never really give it serious think i think i always think yeah i'll join the navy when i graduate and then cos he be sick i be like er let's just boo de boo forget that just get on with life
S0135	mm mhm
S0084	i think that's it if you've get family
S0084	or friends who've be in the force it do sort of put the idea in your head like
S0041	mm
S0084	well that's a viable career option
S0041	yeah i think if he hadn't i would never consider it
S0084	and do he
S0084	do he go to uni or he go straight into the navy
S0041	straight into the navy well move out to spain with my uncle for a while not his dad um my dad one of my dad's other brothers
S0084	mm
S0041	probably when he be huh about seventeen until about twenty one twenty two something like that
S0084	do he have a job
S0041	yeah just work in bar and take load of crap
S0084	mhm
S0041	his head
S0084	mhm
S0041	then come back and join the navy not as an officer though
S0135	no
S0041	yeah so he's be all over the place when i live in barcelona live with hitler and i message him go this be fuck shit
S0041	um cos i should've be in a share house and she the person who own it be live in it i be like she can fuck off
S0041	um and he be like oh yeah i'm in a seven star hotel in bahrain fly over er yeah cos i'm sit on five hundred quid for the er the return flight but cheer
S0041	just rub it in
S0135	be it be it um officer entry or um like entry level there's nothing in between it's like er literally officer or join the
S0084	mm
S0135	rank of
S0041	yeah
S0135	seventeen well like maybe eighteen
S0041	seventeen year olds
S0135	nineteen year olds that sort of business
S0084	mm
S0041	yeah
S0135	there's no middle grind
S0041	no
S0135	isn't that interest
S0041	it's weird isn't it
S0135	yeah
S0041	i don't really get it cos it's er
S0135	it's quite unique to have that
S0041	there's one above like cos to do the job that i want to do you don't need a degree so you i could've go in at a level but it just mean that when after i've finish the train after the first ten weeks or something my rank's higher
S0135	mm
S0041	so the entry's the same but after ten weeks mine rank
S0135	yeah
S0041	higher than these people who just get a level or in the same rank somebody who do engineer have to have a specialist engineer degree so they go a rank higher than i would
S0135	okay yep
S0041	but everyone enter at the same level apart from a few like go in at that level
S0084	mm
S0041	but then they don't split so you don't enter at the entry level and then split again you're just
S0084	mm
S0041	entry level
S0135	that's it yes that's it yeah
S0041	and then it's up to you it's up to you to work it out and she be like so if you can go in at if you go in at entry level probably take you three years to get commission as an officer anyway
S0084	fuck cos it seem like there'd be quite a a disparity between pay in term of your previous experience
S0084	in the officer because if you're go in there as an officer and you're someone who do like count the pen or you know the people who do the food and like the hospitality and stuff and you're they're an officer but you've also get like the the one that you wanna be and then the engineer and they're all officer but surely they must get pay a different amount they're all pay the same even though some of them have get engineer qualifications
S0041	yep
S0084	and some of them have work just in hospitality
S0041	yeah
S0084	so they could go in and like cook dinner
S0041	you wouldn't get you wouldn't get a chef go in as an officer
S0084	oh really
S0041	you might get um accountant or
S0084	but they're more like the the people behind the scenes aren't they like the people that make
S0041	yeah
S0084	sure that all the food's be order and
S0041	but the whole people that go in in logistics say pretend like the chefs
S0084	mm
S0041	and the people who make sure stuff's post right
S0084	mm
S0041	and the stuff people that ship the missiles
S0084	ship the missiles
S0041	and the accountants it would be the same as if you be in on land
S0084	mm
S0041	so people who be chefs or something that's not you wouldn't require a degree for
S0084	mm
S0041	wouldn't be able to go in as an officer anyway cos that
S0084	mm
S0041	it wouldn't require that type of qualification
S0084	mm okay
S0041	it's all a bite nut
S0084	it sound mental to me
S0041	yeah it's all a bite mental good fun though
S0084	when we watch the propaganda dvd
S0084	when that come through
S0135	oh
S0084	i be like what be you do what be you do please look the navy like have gun and
S0135	what be it like
S0084	it look really good though
S0041	yeah
S0135	what like a big holiday or
S0084	but they all have like er er like serene expressions on their face and they be like yeah it's just like really good and we have a really nice time and you be like but what about war
S0041	what about the missiles
S0084	what about the war
S0135	i i wonder if this be um the navy when i be in my first job at the foreign office um it be in the crisis department so if there be a big catastrophe catastrophe overseas involve british nationals this department would lead on the foreign office response to it and they be always exercise like test out possible things that could go wrong and one exercise they do be joint with the mod and it take place on a big ship down off the south west coast somewhere on not bodmin it's something begin with b
S0084	yeah
S0135	i can't remember it
S0084	bodiam
S0135	yeah i i dunno but it be literally the most random thing i've ever do in my life what happen be we all get barrack and they'd recruit a load of like local villagers and family members and everything to come along and pretend to be like distress british nationals who've just suffer this big trauma of an earthquake or a volcano or something they er all put on blood and they be wound and the barrack
S0041	what
S0135	turn into like a sort of um reception centre like process them because we be evacuate them onto this massive ship it sound like it be a dream but it actually happen
S0084	well well imagine
S0084	imagine when they er evacuate people out of libya that would've be the navy
S0135	yeah
S0041	yeah
S0135	exactly
S0084	that would've be them
S0041	or haiti or
S0084	so that would be you
S0041	like that
S0135	yeah lebanon would be the yeah and so basically my job in this sort of exercise be to sit at this stupid little laptop and take everyone's detail
S0135	and like make a manifest in an excel spreadsheet and i get really stress out cos it be like
S0135	really real
S0135	and i'd literally be in the foreign office for like two or three
S0084	mm
S0135	like a really short period of time
S0084	that's really early
S0135	anyway after everyone's be process you all get in this little minibus and they drive sort of on this range down to this beach and they've get like sort of not flare like big glow stick along the beach
S0084	mm
S0135	and you walk down it get in this little boat that chug over to this huge ship thing you get on it i share a little bunk bed with this girl from ukba or something and then at six o'clock in the morning we all sort of chug back to it be like the weirdest
S0041	what the fuck
S0135	thing
S0084	yeah
S0135	ever and it be an exercise i think it be mainly um mod exercise to test their sort of procedures and everything we be just sort of there for the ride it be completely random and i think yeah it would be like practise an evacuation from like lebanon or um what do you say
S0084	libya
S0135	libya libya yeah that kind of thing because you'd have the foreign office there check everyone's sort of passports and their eligibility to board the vessel and that kind of thing
S0041	yeah
S0135	and then you guy obviously to actually drive it or whatever get back to wherever you need to be
S0084	drive the boat
S0135	drive the boat

S0135	what happen to lovely patrick
S0084	he's now live in manchester work for
S0135	oh at the or whatever
S0084	mm yeah yeah
S0084	yeah yeah so they're live in manchester
S0084	but
S0135	who be
S0084	he live in which be a village
S0135	oh right
S0084	but he's still this be his base because that's where his mum's house be and he's try to sell it off and his depress brother still live there and he need to come back and check on him but essentially he doesn't really live here anymore so it's a little bite devastate but what be you gonna do
S0084	no i hadn't see him since christmas
S0135	he be very cute
S0084	he be adorable he still be adorable
S0135	remain adorable
S0084	a nice manageable amount of crazy as well which be what i like
S0084	huh no be just mental
S0135	have you you meet then
S0135	what do you make of him like could if you didn't know that he have a bite of a um
S0135	could you could you pick up on it like could you tell
S0084	oh yeah 's friend
S0084	he's a nice guy he chat to everybody
S0135	yeah
S0135	yeah
S0135	yeah
S0084	cos it's quite a busy house so if you're not if you don't know people in the house er to come in and then sit down and
S0084	sit for dinner and have people come in and out all the time you know he take it all in his stride but
S0084	yeah he be a bite mental i mean i i think his life's just very complicate like with his kid and stuff
S0084	and not really work really sort of live hand to mouth and
S0084	we're just very different so
S0084	yeah
S0084	but he's get his kid as well and if he want custody of his kid he's gonna have to get a better job
S0084	yep
S0084	yep
S0084	he's get three he'll take his son first
S0084	and he's already get his ex whatsit to
S0084	no the same
S0084	because he can't afford to have all three
S0084	apparently
S0084	yeah er so um
S0084	and his son have also get adhd and be behind at in school so he's decide he's try to think the best way for to get him to to get him catch up and he want to then consider homeschooling but obviously he'll have to go to work and so can't be at home because he's a single parent like he's quite actually like i think oh god it's so difficult get myself organize and get myself out of bed and if i want to just sit around i can
S0084	but if you've get kid you can't do that
S0084	mm
S0084	well no she's already prepare to sign over the custody of them
S0084	er it's not a battle he just can't afford to er so he's try to be as sensible about it as he can like he's so depress that he can't have them
S0084	because the work be really inconsistent at the moment
S0084	because of the job market so if er if he if he could financially both of them would agree that he would have the kid now
S0084	it's just that financially he can't
S0084	so er yeah it's just sort of be what it be really
S0135	hmm
S0084	he see them most er every week
S0084	but they live in newmarket so it's quite far from here
S0084	and he doesn't have a car road
S0084	so
S0084	i think they get the bus in
S0084	and they're shit
S0135	want any more
