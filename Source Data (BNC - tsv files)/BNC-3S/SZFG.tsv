S0655	i hate when you get easter egg shape like something really lovely or cos then you have to eat them
S0654	yeah
S0653	that be so true
S0653	i think that be probably an egg but yeah it's just nice to have something that be lactose free isn't it for
S0654	mamma that's a bite too much
S0653	oh you're probably eat anything at the moment unless it's a hot cross bun with bacon as i say well what i be gonna say to you guy someone from the circus erm go on facebook last night and they be in charge of a place in which be not too far away erm where they have a homeless shelter for families so if families er be kind of down on their luck and they have nowhere to live then they house them in there
S0654	oh that's so nice
S0653	and what he would like to do be he would like to try and organise an easter egg hunt for the children
S0654	that be so nice
S0653	and he be ask if people would buy an some some easter egg to go
S0654	i would
S0653	yeah so i think we could do that
S0654	uhu
S0653	and i think it would be nice if we could go to the office in and deliver it to the people there cos i we're not gonna be at the circus at the same time and i think it would be nice to see we're not gonna be able to see the house where they live but we'll be able to see the place erm where all the people work there and look after those families would you like to do that
S0654	mm i maybe and erm if and mamma i've get an idea
S0653	mm
S0654	we could erm do some card say happy easter
S0653	well you could but there's a lot of families out there isn't there so we need to i don't think we could do a card for them because we would have to do one for everybody
S0655	no
S0653	otherwise it would be
S0654	like for people who be in charge
S0653	oh yeah well yes we could do that
S0654	thank you for look after all these people
