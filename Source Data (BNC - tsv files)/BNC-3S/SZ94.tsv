S0653	okay so i want to tell you about eddie izzard because
S0654	who who
S0653	who who sit down
S0653	he's a comedian
S0655	mm
S0653	and he be run seven no twenty seven marathons over twenty seven days
S0654	oh my goodness that's a lot
S0653	that be a lot
S0655	and so a a marathon a day
S0653	a marathon a day
S0655	woah
S0653	so the few years
S0654	can i pour it
S0653	no i'll pour it a few years ago he do forty seven marathons in fifty one days i think
S0654	omg
S0653	something something like that but yeah really an incredible thing to do and he be do that for sport relief so i be wonder if we want to well we can either sponsor him er and or we could try and do something ourselves for sport relief couldn't we could try and raise some money what do you think
S0654	yeah
S0653	what would you like any ideas of what we could do
S0654	er we could
S0655	win the lottery and give all the money to charity
S0653	hang on er don't talk at the same time
S0654	we could give some erm we could do a little children's thingy
S0653	children's thingy
S0654	you know a little children's sport's day in the summertime and erm it cost one pound
S0653	but that that would take a lot of organisation and plan and that would i'm just wonder if there's anything that we could do now really you could do a sponsor silence that'd be interest
S0654	yeah i think i might do a sponsor silence how would people know you're do it
S0653	because you would tell people we could put it on facebook and twitter and things couldn't we
S0654	i want i really want to do it today
S0655	or you could have a sign say sponsor silence
S0653	i think you could but i'm just wonder if it could be a sporty challenge that we do
S0655	i could try and run a huge amount
S0653	well we could all
S0654	no you're
S0654	you're
S0653	try and go to er the race erm you know they have a every sunday what's it what's it call a junior park run where people run around
S0655	how long er how long be that
S0653	er do you mean the distance that people run
S0655	uhu
S0653	i'm not sure actually i think i don't know because the erm grow up one be five k so i think it might be half of that two and a half k
S0654	mm
S0653	but we could get in train for it couldn't we and i be think that that might be a fun thing to do cos you don't really like run at the moment do you
S0655	but mum
S0653	that could be a long challenge that we do erm from now until the summer perhaps
S0654	okay
S0653	yeah
S0655	maybe i could run the six miles
S0653	yeah but yeah this be what i'm say you can't just go and run six miles we'd have to train for it wouldn't we
S0655	yeah i'll train and i'll train for a lot or i'll train for a while and then i'll be quick
S0654	i've mama erm now we're gonna start do race
S0655	erm and i'll be quite a bite faster once i've complete my goal
S0654	mama i've get er something to do every time i come back from school here i'm gonna get erm i'm gonna go outside and run a lap around the garden not the one which be erm our backyard the one which be erm the people's
S0655	yeah
S0653	the one the front
S0654	yeah
S0655	we could all do that
S0653	well i wonder if i could find on the internet a a run plan for for little people
S0654	and then i would run it five
S0653	and then we could all do it together couldn't we
S0654	and i would run this er
S0655	it's not just run though it's exercise
S0654	eight time eight lap so
S0653	that would be a start
S0654	and i would see how fast i have get
S0653	well it be exercise anyway run but yeah there's it's there's lot of things about run and how i start this nought to five k thing a couple of years ago be when you you know you run for a minute then you walk for a minute and a half so that's i think how we would have to start it with you nice and slowly to keep you
S0654	happy
S0653	feel that you're achieve and everything but that that could be a really good thing to aim towards and there be the race isn't there there's a fun run in in september and that's a really nice time of year to run cos it's not too hot and it's not too cold and i bet if we start train perhaps in easter when it's a little bite nicer and less muddy i reckon you could totally do that race in in september what do you think do you wanna give it a go and we could raise money we could sponsor ourselves
S0653	the trouble with erm
S0655	or people could sponsor us
S0653	sorry
S0655	or people could sponsor us
S0653	that's what i mean the trouble with the erm run at be that it's it's outdoors run i mean like on the grass which be very muddy and it's a little bite more difficult than run kind of on the roads and things erm but it's it's lovely cos you get to have a a beautiful view so i think we'd need different shoe you can get a different type of run shoe for kind of muddy terrain there's also something call insane terrain on er september which be what i be gonna do in september last year but then you be poorly erm which be a run race but lot of fun so they have er mud and water slide and just like fun obstacles to do to make it
S0655	messy
S0653	entertain
S0655	and messy
S0653	and messy
S0654	but people will get messy i don't want to get messy
S0653	oh baby girl it's fun
S0654	no
S0653	you don't like that idea
S0654	i don't want to get messy because in the car then i don't like it
S0653	well they've get shower they've get shower
S0654	i don't want to be naked in the shower with people
S0653	you won't be oh yes because you hate be naked normally alright well maybe you and i could do that cos they've get a special junior one for kid in september so parent and kid can can do it together
S0655	i think i just won't care because i walk around quite muddy in the house like in granny's house don't worry i didn't spill any mud erm er a while ago and i be like and i have jump in the muddy ditch
S0653	what on purpose
S0655	yes a load of time be there like a rope swing
S0653	bless you
S0655	be there like a rope swing to one side
S0653	erm they have different erm obstacle and activities every year so i don't know but they definitely have shoot to slide down erm
S0655	what like in like those things that go
S0653	a big big big shoot that go into water
S0655	so like that
S0653	so you get so actually you do get pretty clean by the end of it cos they've get a bite of a muddy thing that you've get to go through probably crawl under some stuff and go over some stuff but then
S0654	there's like
S0653	then they have a massive er massive slide where you go into the water and actually that clean you up pretty well
S0654	but but mama be that er quite deep i can
S0653	be it quite deep it's not well no because this one will be for children so it's not go to be
S0654	i can only swim with er goggle on
S0653	yeah but this be for children so they're go to tailor it aren't they to to people your age so they're not gonna drown you that wouldn't be very popular would it if they do that so no it's not gonna
S0654	how can i see i can't see water
S0655	only one pound
S0653	cos you're only gonna be under there for like a couple of second
S0655	only one pound to go
S0654	so would we have to hold our breath
S0653	no course not you're just slide down into the water
S0654	do it have be it like swim pool water
S0653	er well i don't know i think it's just probably normal water but it will be in september it'll be warm still it's always really nice in september
S0654	i know but
S0653	and you'll be really hot from have run around the track
S0654	i think i might do that
S0653	yeah you're have a think about it
S0655	but mum be the shoot go to be like this or like this
S0653	it's gonna be a big wide shoot i think but as i say
S0655	but will it like have the top will it have top
S0653	it's different every well listen i'm gonna probably do an insane terrain in the summer beforehand so i can take photograph and show you what it's like but because it's for children it's gonna be a lot of fun i really do think that you will enjoy it
S0654	shall i wear a bikini
S0653	no you're gonna have to wear short and a t shirt cos you'll be run in a race first so i think you could run in a bikini but you might look a little bite silly
S0654	
S0655	yeah you'd get a muddy bikini
S0653	huh
S0655	you'd get a muddy bikini
S0654	i've get an idea i could wear a bikini erm underneath my clothe
S0655	and then er just er
S0653	yeah but you you don't wanna wear too much cos you'll get hot
S0654	yeah
S0653	and you know what you'll be like then
S0655	so then at the very last slide you'll take your clothe off
S0655	and then your short and t shirt
S0653	mm
S0655	and then er you'll be in your bikini
S0655	slide down the slide go i love this slide
S0653	yeah
S0653	what do you think be you come around to the idea
S0654	yeah
S0653	yeah
S0655	mm
S0653	i'll try and find some photograph but i i think this be the first year that they've ever do it specifically for children
S0654	mm
S0653	so i don't think there's any photograph to show you of children do it but i can
S0654	then we might get photograph
S0653	oh yeah you er all get photograph they that's the big thing there they always make sure everybody be photograph so then you can see yourself do it
S0654	and you get a trophy in the mud
S0653	mm i think you do get a trophy or a medal or something
S0655	i have er mum i have a erm dream about that drink
S0654	mama

S0653	but that but that well do you say anything to him
S0655	no
S0653	no
S0655	cos i know he have start
S0653	mm that's the problem though rather than say always be on the leave hand side then one be on the leave and one be on the right so they touch each other don't they so that's a bite
S0653	so they be gonna knock each other stop scrap your bowl but they be amaze seat but they look fine er but they're massive i mean if we have one in our house it would take up half the live room wouldn't it do you mention them to dad
S0654	i er yeah i
S0653	do you suggest that he should get one
S0654	well kind of and we kind of didn't
S0655	we didn't
S0654	i really want to bulldoze the house next to us
S0655	why
S0653	to have more room
S0654	cos yeah cos last night i hear erm er next door
S0653	he be shout at last night wasn't he a lot do you hear that
S0654	yeah
S0655	and usually i just hear bang on the wall
S0654	yeah and i hear a thump and it be like
S0655	hammer something down
S0654	it be like that
S0653	he just keep go like that i think 's be more and more naughty as she get older cos i think she be sit on the sofa like however when we first move here
S0655	bite me on the ankle
S0653	no well yes but that wasn't when we first move here but we've be here five years and three months and so you be only two well not even two nearly two very nearly two
S0654	very nearly two
S0653	and erm there be moments when i'm sure i've i've shout at you guy or be like go to sleep go to sleep and i still do that from time to time
S0653	or of course you would've might've be cry in the night and things so 's have to put up with all of that and now of course you guy be older so you don't i don't really that never really happen and now he's do it with but then who know what happen when you become a teenager
S0655	i should i think i'm go to be a lovely teenager
S0654	yeah she really want to run away she doesn't really like do she
S0653	sorry
S0654	she doesn't really like do she she want to run away
S0653	she do she's just a she's just remember she's an abuse dog so she wasn't care for very well beforehand so she's a bite sensitive but i mean to say when you be away this weekend the teenager that live at the end of the of our garden that house
S0655	mm
S0653	that back onto it you know that always play their music quite loudly in the summer
S0655	yes
S0653	well he have a party on friday night
S0655	and get send to court
S0653	and well no but he so most people wouldn't even have music that loud anyway around here but the general the law be be that you've get
S0654	or even have music
S0653	i know the general law be be that you've get to turn the music down at eleven o'clock at night which be quite late anyway but he didn't so he be still play his music at midnight and i be so grateful that you guy weren't here cos it would've really you would've have to sleep in my room i think
S0655	but
S0653	but he's so kind of selfish but it's a typical kind of teenager thing to do be to have
S0655	but he break the law
S0653	he do well i do ring the police but there's not a lot they can do about it it's not a police matter it's an environmental issue so
S0655	why be it an environmental issue
S0653	well partly it's because police have get lot and lot of things to deal with and that's sort of the last er you know they should be do other things that be more criminal if you see what i mean but i will i will complain i didn't ring yesterday but i will complain because actually we've never complain have we about that
S0655	no
S0653	and they there have be a lot of time when they've play really loud music
S0655	yeah like when the time we have to watch star war six that be the only thing i'm gonna thank them for and i'm not gonna thank them for it
S0655	cos i be really tire in the morning
S0653	mm
S0655	even if i do get to see star war six
S0653	i mean even when it's in the summer holiday it's still rude isn't it to do that because obviously everyone's windows be open but i mean even over the weekend when everyone's i mean all the windows be shut i could still hear the music from my bed even with my er my door shut as well so it be very loud i just felt really sorry for the the neighbour you know the the man that we always say hello to
S0654	yeah
S0653	the that he's the next door neighbour and he would've be keep awake wouldn't he but it be a big teenage party
S0654	well i'm surprise you didn't go round and shout at them yourself
S0653	well the problem be be that if you do that then they kind of get all cross with you don't they
S0655	yeah and then they turn the music up even louder
S0653	and some people most people i would say i would go and complain but i if if i know that they be go to be kind of reasonable about it but i know that they er they be i would know that they weren't go to be reasonable about it so and it's difficult for me cos i work at the school
S0654	mm
S0653	all of the children that be there the teenagers be there also go to the school so i kind of don't really want to attract attention in that way erm now what be our decision about world book day be we
S0654	see what the book be
S0653	so we're gonna just get the tokens from school and then we'll go into
S0655	when be world book day
