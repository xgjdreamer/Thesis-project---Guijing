S0104	and always erm i'll think right you know like when i've have my break i must look alert when i walk past the front doors and
S0110	so do you walk like
S0104	yeah so i walk like that and look around and
S0110	i bet you
S0104	mm
S0110	mm that look like a march princess
S0104	but i always i'm always very aware of the cameras shin into the build
S0167	why do they install cameras there be there trouble or something
S0110	yeah
S0104	well yeah there be there be a break in at the lodge cos the office the administrative office be at the lodge and they come round or i be on that night shift actually it be it it be an inside job i know it be an inside job because they just know too much it may not have be anyone who work there but
S0110	mm yeah

S0110	mm
S0104	like that be store round the back which i didn't hear them
S0110	mm
S0104	and they go down to the lodge and they break into the office and go straight for the safe and get the get the money out of the safe
S0167	do they actually take the money out
S0104	yeah
S0167	so they know the code and everything
S0104	yeah well i don't know i don't know how they break into the safe but erm

S0104	fortune and they're all around and there's nowhere
S0110	mm
S0104	on the outside perimeter of any part of the build that you can go
