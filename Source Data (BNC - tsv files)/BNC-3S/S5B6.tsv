S0232	we be on one side of the shop because we go out of the shop on the way down for the train station and dad be push a pushchair and be talk to him and have no rein on and she be run i'm like i don't trust them i don't trust them i go over the road i put in she's stand on her pushchair don't let her out
S0198	yeah
S0232	cos if anyone's go to let her run on the road it'll be you two
S0198	it's you don't it's not often you see children with rein anymore be it
S0232	no well she's not get rein round she's get like a little backpack that little orange one she put her toy in it it's get a string on the back so you just hold her so she can't run off
S0198	where she yeah i don't see the harm in rein i don't see the harm in them
S0232	if it stop them run into the road and get run over or
S0198	exactly i mean that's the whole point it mean they can still toddle but you don't have to hold their hand the entire time or stand stand on top of them the entire time
S0232	yeah
S0198	and you can keep them at arm's length
S0232	yeah i mean especially like if it's just like if it's just like me and and i've get the pushchair with me i've get one hand on the pushchair one hand keep you know one eye keep an eye on i don't need you know if i get there at least i know she's not go to run off well she will if anyone's go to run off it'll be
S0198	it'll be
S0198	you know i mean children run off all the time they'd never use anything like that in they always let their children run run riot there it's really surprise yeah i'm always like oh my god you see them run down the road on their own i don't know how more of them aren't knock over
S0232	oh really
S0198	i really don't fairly relax still
S0230	now you imagine them to be a really strict culture don't you
S0232	yeah i be go to say that
S0198	yeah no when it come to they're really strict about like they're not strict they're all about make their well feel like their children have to study as much as possible but it's always quantity over quality for one and then i think because they give them such a hard time about other things that when it come to other kinds of discipline or family time at the weekend like at a restaurant they do
S0232	they're a bite more lax
S0198	they don't discipline them at all you go to a restaurant sometime they'll be run around scream and do whatever and yeah health and safety wise they're not very strict with things like that you're often climb over they'll have playgrounds and erm play climb frame in school and stuff like and that just let five year olds run around unsupervised on their own
S0232	way
S0198	i don't think if a child get hurt in school typically it's not still not typical for the parent to blame the school they're just like well children hurt themselves it just happen
S0232	mm
S0198	so like some things they're more like more reasonable other things not just depend really but yeah children often still walk to school by themselves a lot because their culture's safer
S0232	yeah
S0198	so you'll see really little ones though take themselves to school sometimes and you're like ah bless them
S0232	really see i mean in in this country i mean i'm already worry about go to senior school on her own
S0198	yeah yeah
S0232	and that's four ways away it's four years away yet and i'm already i'm already worry about her walk on her own because because
S0198	yeah four years away yeah for away and that's when she'll be eleven or eleven won't it yeah
S0232	yeah
S0198	whereas yeah no by that point woah they're do i mean they're take themselves to school they're take themselves to afterschool class they're take themselves to their academies in the even
S0232	yeah
S0198	by eleven they're allow to walk around pretty freely it's all all kinds of time in the even
S0232	oh right
S0198	erm yeah they're not so strict about that it's more customs and they do overwork their children horribly though once they get to middle school age once they get to about thirteen to eighteen be a terrible time for a
S0232	yeah
S0198	really horrible they're just make to study until the early hours every morning they have a say though in the last year of high school if you sleep for four hours you're sleep for five and the you won't get to university you want to go to so eh sixteen to eighteen year olds aren't aren't sleep no more than four hours a night
S0232	blimey
S0198	and it's like they make them go to these academies and send them to these lessons and stuff but there's no way they're still learn you're not you can't you know i've only get to sit down and read a textbook for an hour and i start to get tire and i stop take information in so it's completely pointless
S0232	yeah
S0198	like it's not make them any more intelligent or anything it's just very competitive so it's a shame
S0232	see that's the one of the when they have sats at the end of this year because i never know they do sats at the end of year two
S0198	no it do have have they always do that
S0232	i don't know cos i'm i mean the problem with her school be i think they assume that everyone know how the school system work so course with first one i don't know how the school system work and i say to her teacher shouldn't we have be tell they be have these sats test
S0198	mm
S0232	and she's like well we do make a point not to make a big deal out of it because some parent will go and do stupid things like get tutor and put lot of pressure on them and at seven six and seven they don't need that and i'm like no that's fine but as a parent would it hurt for you to stick on the bottom of a newsletter children have get up and come sats test at the end of year two you know
S0198	it's not necessary sats test yeah
S0232	or on the term date just put sats test year two that's all you've get to do no big deal out of it's get to be make
S0198	definitely
S0232	i mean i get sometimes say that i push a bite hard and i'm not push her hard but it's like over the holiday we've be do out time table and some maths as she's be write in her homework diary cos there's no point in not do anything for six weeks because by the time she go back to school she'd have she'd have forget lot of stuff
S0198	exactly exactly i think that's a big problem in our culture be that we're we we don't actually make our children study much at home at all
S0232	yeah yeah
S0198	at all like there's one thing like you know be crazy about it but
S0232	i mean she read every day without fail she have to read every day without fail
S0198	i think if you want your child to to to you know perform really well then you you need to do it
S0232	yeah
S0198	cos otherwise they'll they're just you know
S0232	well that's like my my argument with erm with i mean i know 's get his disability and i know he's autistic and yeah he be never go to be as i i mean 's already outshine with like capabilities at school and stuff
S0198	won't actually be able to well yeah he must be i mean i'm sure
S0232	do you know what i mean but but on the other hand i always think well if be behind she'd wouldn't hurt if she push him a bite harder because then he won't be as far behind everyone else do you think he'd be a bite more determine
S0232	it's like he still can't use a pencil because he's get really bad like muscle tone he'd felt tip pen be alright because obviously you don't have to push too hard but if you give them a pencil he can't even push hard enough to and i'm not say that's his fault cos obviously that's not him be lazy he just physically can't do it but on his his school's solution be well give him a laptop
S0198	mm yeah well
S0232	well he's never go to learn to write then be he if you give him if you take away any
S0198	i don't understand the laptop solution to problems now
S0232	exactly
S0198	dyslexic have a laptop well
S0232	and i and i understand yeah they've get to learn to be able to use computers and that because so much be technology be involve now in just normal everyday life but
S0198	yeah i mean assist with learn
S0232	how be he ever go to learn to write if you don't make him write in the first place
S0198	and it's like it's
S0232	and also what's the harm of him write with a felt tip pen if he have to
S0198	have to
S0232	okay it's probably more of a pain in the bum if he make mistake and that but
S0198	it still give him also it's regardless of what he can do in the future as a as a teenager or whatever he well how be he go to feel like when he can't he know everyone else can write and he can't
S0232	exactly
S0198	it's a confidence thing it doesn't matter if he get a job or not it's just personal confidence
S0232	i mean he'll go to he's i mean it'll be senior school senior school he'll start next year
S0198	mm
S0232	and the cos he's at a special need school now
S0198	yeah they're go to mainstream them aren't they
S0232	they've say now they're go to mainstream him and i think it'll do him the world of good because i think he'll be more he'll want to do more of what the more able children be
S0198	do yeah
S0232	he'll still have his one on one like specialist and he'll come out of he'll come out of
S0198	specialist yeah because they have a special need departments
S0232	yeah he'll come out of his like regular class and go off to smaller group you know one on one sessions and stuff like that but i do think i'm hop that because he'll be see kid that be more capable he'll want to emulate them and hopefully it might make him a bite more
S0198	it'll make him more aware of what people be do
S0232	exactly
S0230	and surely by encourage him to use a pen he's go to build up
S0232	his muscle tone will get better anyway exactly
S0198	well yeah of course yeah
S0232	but just give him a laptop do that and not only that but it make me laugh they're always go on about how we can't hold a pen very well but he can play an xbox and a playstation fine
S0198	yeah
S0232	well hang on a minute those pad can be pretty weighty after a while if he can do that and
S0198	of course they
S0232	and he can play dss and everything else like that so his i think with his his he's just not push enough sometimes i don't think there's
S0198	yeah
S0232	and also i think because he's more one of the abled children at his special need school
S0198	yeah exactly he's probably top of his special need school at the moment
S0232	yeah i mean you've get some kid there that like be in permanent wheelchairs can't you know even sit up on their own without be support you know
S0198	yeah
S0232	so i think because of that as well i think the school leave him to just get on with his to leave him to his own devices half the time say at school all he do be play
S0198	yeah well
S0232	but then but then she should do say something to the school as well
S0198	as well
S0232	take him out of the school then if you're not happy with it i mean change school mention it go to you know well he's get a social worker for cry out loud take it up with them if you have to
S0198	oh yeah and as you say he she could be do numerous things
S0232	she could do stuff at home with him it's just bone idleness isn't it though
S0198	this be another thing people leave their entire care of their child and the education of the child down to the education system
S0232	to the school and then they blame the school when they don't do very well or something yeah
S0198	it's not you know you're the parent you're you're you're just you're more responsible if anything
S0232	i mean like i say i'm lucky that quite enjoy do stuff like that anyway
S0198	yeah yeah yeah you you don't actually have to force her to do it yeah
S0232	i mean it's not like i have to i'd have to force her to do it i mean some day she'll be like do i have to like yesterday she didn't write her diary because by the time we get home and have our dinner it be late but then she'll but i'll make her write two days today
S0198	yeah she be tire yeah
S0232	because i'm horrible
S0198	no that's not i think that's a reasonable thing to do i've i've come across friends that have do that have be fairly successful from have just a little light touch of discipline when it come to academic stuff
S0232	yeah i mean one of the i mean at the end of every holiday well i always make a point of say to her teacher what can we work on over the holiday and what especially these longer holiday exactly
S0198	yeah it's six weeks of nothing i mean
S0232	especially with her arm be like it be we'd be do even less anyway so we're not go out on the to the park as much we're not go out on her bike
S0198	yeah
S0232	because she's just learn to ride her bike as well
S0198	ah i know ah
S0232	i couldn't believe that i be so worry about her fall off that bike she'd outgrow her helmet she'd have get too small for it
S0198	oh right
S0232	and so i rush out get her a new helmet think she's go to fall off that bike and smash her head have worry have i she can't bloody ride the thing
S0198	ah
S0232	but yeah but i don't but i always make a point of say to her teacher what can we work on and her head i mean her teacher say well you know she's really good at time table but we want them to be quicker want them to be able to fire them off really fast you know
S0198	yeah
S0232	so just keep just keep practise those do her homework because she's the teacher be always say how good her write be she say she love that she's so i mean she's get some poetry at home that she write
S0198	wow
S0232	and i'm i mean i could've it i could've write she she come home one she come home one day do you remember i tell you about she come home we be play school and erm she's like write a poem use similes and blah blah blah
S0232	and i be like
S0232	i be like okay
S0198	you don't hardly know what a simile be until you're in secondary school
S0232	she know what she know what a simile be she know what they be
S0198	she's get a really good teacher i think that she's take care of that yeah because there's no because
S0232	yeah her teacher's lovely her teacher's lovely and i do and she's sit there mark it go you didn't that's a good simile mummy i've go oh thank you i'm not quite sure what i do but
S0232	it's embarrass when your seven year old
S0198	there's there's no way that all all all grade two teachers be teach their children that hopefully she's give them because i know i do remember it be it must be difficult when you've get to teach students of all abilities
S0232	yeah
S0198	and i remember at english master every year we'd be sit in kind of row and erm each row be of a certain ability and you you're all set different textbooks and different things yeah
S0232	yeah i they have table they've get table in theirs erm they're like she's on she's on triangle table and triangle table spell each week be harder than the other table and stuff the time table i mean some of some of her friends aren't do time table up to twelve whereas her group be so yeah that ah that in that way
S0198	you get yeah exactly yeah you get harder spell no we're that's erm yeah and i remember we i i remember in like year four or something that a very small group of us have to do extra write project
S0232	yeah
S0198	and write things like that but at the time like you i just think they be give us extra work to do which we all enjoy do but i guess that be the teacher's way of encourage yeah but not all of the teachers do that
S0232	yeah
S0198	and erm to go to the she's obviously go to the extents expose them to higher things and why not once if a child's bright give it teach it they're pretty unlimited at what they can teach
S0232	well it's like erm she they start do their victorian project in no they do native americans when they go back in september last year and then before christmas she start this opera thing and because they'd start do the victorian project they be all really into the victorian project because they go to and go round the and all that sort of stuff and erm that be suppose to finish er after the christmas term
S0198	mm
S0232	and the kid all enjoy do it so much she let it carry on
S0198	oh right
S0232	because they be so into learn about the victorians they it's all talk about that's why 's get a victorian dolls' house for her birthday this year
S0232	i haven't see it no i just think about that
S0232	yeah be that alright
S0198	oh have you buy have you buy it mum
S0232	well i saw one on facebay which be like ebay on facebook
S0198	oh okay
S0232	erm because the one she want be two hundred pound in toy and we're have a party this year as well i'm like we can't afford two hundred quid
S0198	no
S0232	then the lady be sell furniture as well because the furniture set be like twenty five quid
S0198	oh one of those proper little old traditional dolls' house
S0232	yeah like with like little proper yeah
S0198	yeah be it in the thing ah can you not open it then
S0230	no
S0232	no i'll have to have a look later then
S0198	never mind never mind
S0230	i can't lift it it's too heavy
S0198	we'll have a look when dad get back then
S0232	so yeah and i say to very kindly would you mind pick it up for me and hide it
S0198	oh yeah how much do
S0232	only fifty pound well forty five wasn't it
S0198	that's better
S0232	yeah
S0198	oh she'll love that that'll keep her entertain for the next two years
S0232	but that's what she want to that one that's what she want since last last year wasn't it
S0230	yeah
S0232	but because she get a tablet
S0198	oh yeah
S0232	i say to her you can't have a tablet and
S0198	the dolls' house
S0232	and a dolls' house so yeah this one when i saw this one i be like well fifty quid's to an opportunity to miss really isn't it
S0198	yeah facebay do you say
S0232	yeah
S0198	mm
S0232	they do like freebie ones as well like people give away stuff so i say to you should keep an eye out for anything you might need
S0198	yeah that's true that's a nice way of recycle stuff without be too wasteful
S0232	yeah
S0230	i forget what the website be
S0232	freebies for kent just search for it on facebook and then you just join the group because erm i sell a load of girls' toy on there and they make about eighty quid
S0198	mm mm nice
S0232	yeah so for stuff that they i would've give to the charity shop or whatever beforehand
S0198	now you can actually
S0232	yeah and then that's what she's buy her erm monkey and stuff with over the holiday when we've go on days out she's spend her own you know that's your money do what you want with it
S0198	yeah mum money yeah yeah
S0232	so
S0198	because you're only i say to mum you're only go to buy her stuff anyway so you may as well give it directly to her and then
S0232	exactly yeah she's old enough now to know that money's
S0198	responsibility yeah that's a really good idea another good good parent technique
S0232	don't know where it come from
S0198	yeah from your parent no
S0232	no definitely not my parent after be adopt
S0198	yeah i know the feel
S0230	sorry
S0198	i'm joke mother it's all your input isn't it dad be rogue
S0232	say that now sometimes she's oh i must be auntie 's daughter
S0232	because we always say to her you're just like your auntie
S0198	yeah bless her give her too high expectations she's better than i be
S0232	ah i don't know about that she'd go half as far as you well not half as far as in distance
S0198	yeah
S0232	i'd rather her stay a bite closer than that
S0198	wait until yeah see wait until she's older i'll be influence her travel
S0232	i could think of i could think of worse role model i suppose
S0198	she could come and live with me wherever i be
S0232	oh don't tell her that she'll move in tomorrow
S0198	yeah i know well she can come down to but i'm not sure our our flat's that family friendly i think you guy might be able to come down to visit but it's not exactly you know big guess it doesn't have to be
S0232	i well it's only just you two most of the time isn't it
S0198	yeah it's fine we've get our friends come to stay with us in the end of october begin of november
S0232	yeah because you say you won't be able to make 's party didn't you
S0198	yeah yeah yeah from america so that's why we need a futon because we stay with them for we stay with them for nearly six weeks i think in america so they're stay for three weeks so we're go to let them have our bedroom and we'll sleep in the live room because also we want to get up early and use the kitchen and everything for uni and whatnot so erm we need a futon but that do mean anytime anyone want to stay with us they can i mean you could come down i guess you'd be drive down though i think a train fare for would cost a pretty penny
S0232	yeah i don't know train fare i know they do or they do have group discount when travellers be group so yeah
S0198	oh yeah i suppose when you get a family ah do you even have to pay for and
S0232	i have to pay for not
S0198	oh you do
S0232	but then like yesterday if we erm we go down to 's you're only if you buy two ticket you get a third free anyway
S0198	mm
S0232	and then travel for a pound when she travel for an adult so
S0198	oh do she

S0198	be that because of where he be in be that a deal that
S0232	no that's if you go up to london you could get those i mean it have to be off peak not like not but but yeah
S0198	oh really yeah it's like a group family ticket i never know see it's such a rip off when you that that'd cost me that it cost me more than that to go to and back twenty five quid for one person

S0232	because i remember when we go up there they be still build it and we be both all try to look at the top on the train we be like oh god that be high isn't it
S0198	oh on i don't know have i i don't know if i've even see it apart from now from the sky but
S0232	it be extraordinarily high
S0198	i think maybe i do see it in when i go to to get my visa before i go back to maybe i feel like it be cloudy though so didn't see the top
S0232	what the smog
S0198	classic you could tell like it be you get into above england on the plane and it's just cloud as far as you can because you know you fly above the cloud it's just cloud as far as you can see it's like ah just white fluffy cloud and i'm like ah it's cloudy today great
S0232	yeah you can tell you're back in england
S0198	yeah that's not too bad though i suppose it's not too cold not at the moment
S0232	yeah because i look i remember look it up on map and we're like we go to it's about a twenty five minute walk to like the museums
S0198	mm museums
S0232	which doesn't really bother us because you'll see stuff on the way anyway and discover little bits and bob
S0198	and then then it'll take the rest of your day to go round those few museums with she'll love them
S0232	exactly yeah well then she go up there for she go up there for school but they weren't allow to they only do certain part of it so because they be do the dinosaurs so they yeah obviously they only do mainly concentrate on that where she didn't see all the so she never saw the blue whale and i'm like if you go there you have to look at the blue whale
S0198	they're busy as well in the summer she have be up there yeah because they be such a big group yeah oh okay you have to see yeah
S0232	they weren't allow in the gift shop either so she be most upset she weren't allow in the gift shop
S0198	ah yeah i mean
S0232	i think that's pretty the only way she want to go back
S0198	really busy there though
S0232	yeah
S0198	it's always but i guess if you don't mind just take your time
S0232	and it's so expensive as well i remember we buy we buy food up there last time and it be like six pound for a sandwich
S0198	oh yeah take take your own pack lunch
S0232	yeah just a picnic this time we've get a pushchair it's fine it can go on that
S0198	yeah yeah
S0232	which be another reason i don't want to do mess around the tube not with the pushchair and be a bite
S0198	oh right
S0232	if she be a bite older wouldn't bother me so much but yeah can't go in the lift
S0198	ah she doesn't like the lift
S0232	so there's no way i'm go to get her underground on a tube
S0198	no wait until she's a bite older
S0232	yeah
S0198	as no yeah my friend when i say someone be talk about diazepam she she can't go in a lift still she she when like last time i be here she have just move to a flat in that's she's on the fifth floor and it have a lift go up but she wouldn't get in the lift she always take the stairs
S0232	oh bless her
S0198	until one night when we be quite drink and me and be like come on just get in the lift and then we jump up and down in it and scar her even more so
S0198	it's the only time she go in there but yeah she still doesn't go in there she just doesn't like the idea of the close space
S0232	yeah that's what 's like she'd quite happily go up the escalators but she do not like the lift
S0198	the lift yeah i know it's a pretty foreign entity it's not something you do very often be it
S0232	yeah she doesn't mind the glass like like in the she's alright with that i think it's just not be able to see out
S0198	oh she doesn't mind that one oh
S0232	yeah it's not be able to see i think
S0198	so ah
S0232	and be that i mean they be quite claustrophobic aren't they i mean yeah
S0198	yeah really box in
S0232	yeah pain in the bum so someone have to walk up stairs of course normally i've get a pushchair and i'm like well i can't do that with the pushchair
S0232	and
S0198	yeah yeah that's true oh okay so it's just the box in one
S0232	mm yeah
S0198	i'd say it's just a bite of claustrophobia
S0232	yeah that's what i reckon i reckon she'll probably grow out of it anyway
S0198	yeah she will she's still young
S0232	i know you're go to say no but would you like any help
S0198	yeah i haven't even offer mum
S0230	i'm alright
S0232	i offer her every time
S0230	i'm okay
