S0257	but when you're it it really make you think when you're try to put it in something somebody from another country would understand
S0255	that's right you're explain what it actually mean rather than just think another way of say it be like well actually how do i actually get
S0257	yeah
S0255	and and the total essence of what you're say as well
S0257	exactly
S0255	isn't it rather than just the gist of it
S0257	exactly like you say about do tea need to go and do tea
S0255	yes yeah
S0257	it's a whole different a whole different mean tea then
S0255	yeah i say to one somebody i say something about oh you can go off people you know cos they they be just start beat me and i be like oh and the they be laugh cos they be beat me and i say you can go off people you know and they come back and sort of say i can go off people i'm like be you be you twist the word or be you not understand and they go i don't know what you mean by that so i be like right well what you say be you know somebody say something in a joke way that could be take as mean you then say that back to them in a joke way as in you can go off people and and like i expect you to spread yeah
S0257	stop like them
S0255	yeah i expect you to spread it right across america
S0257	yeah
S0255	and they're like right will do will do yeah yeah and i also have somebody when i tell say i be go to give somebody a bollocking on there as well
S0255	they didn't get it i just and they be like do what what do that mean right i'm go to use that on my kid no adults adult kid but yeah
S0257	yeah yeah no no
S0255	no i say they're adults i'm go to give them a bollocking if they're not nice to me and i'm like yeah okay okay i spread the word yeah funny
S0257	get to reintroduce english to the americans
S0255	yeah exactly exactly i've have one some some of them cos i play a lot of americans i think when i be when i be off particularly cos of the time difference and stuff
S0257	yeah
S0255	erm i get play a lot of americans and and one of them sort of say what to the what do the brits think of the of the americans seriously and it's just sort of like it's funny cos we you know you don't think i say well i think there's a lot of stereotypical er out there about the americans i say same as people tend to think all the businessmen in london wear a bowler hat well they don't you know and and i be give examples like that and the sort of say you know i say
S0257	yeah we're not all mary poppins
S0255	no exactly exactly and i i sort of say well you know i think a lot of brits or you know cos it's funny cos you they you always say that i'm a brit but actually to me i'm english i'm not british i'm english
S0257	yeah
S0255	all that and i i be say like you be talk about that and i be i would say the uk but i would say i'm english
S0257	mm
S0255	erm and sort of say well you know i think a lot of english people think the americans be quite brash and loud i say but then we're aware that it's such a huge area and so many different people and you know and that sort of stuff and
S0257	so it's almost like say what do the the english think of europeans
S0255	yeah exactly exactly yeah
S0257	and you do get stereotype and and you also get the people that be in the headline mostly so you often base your opinion on people that be make the news and sometimes it's because they're do bad things and they're
S0255	yeah yeah exactly
S0257	behave in a way that give you a misconception of of the rest of a a culture or a or a country
S0255	mm mm yeah one one one of the guy be say how erm like the gun it's totally crazy of there with families shoot each other and you know people shoot and stab in the streets and they say it be just totally out of control they say that's not portray wrongly that be how it be he say you're just really aware he say he actually say he think seriously think about get a gun a few time but he's get kid and he say there's no way i'd ever risk anything that they could maybe get hold of even if i know it's lock away
S0257	well this be the thing a in a in american supermarket not long ago be it a two year old
S0255	yeah yeah pull it out the bag and shoot his mum
S0257	shoot his mother
S0255	i know it's just yeah exactly and that's what he sort of say you know he's get i don't i think it be like a ten eight and a four year old and he just say there's there's no way i'd ever risk have it in the house because someway something could happen to us or to them
S0257	yeah yeah exactly
S0255	you know and one of them
S0257	but i think what what what we be not aware of in this country be how much the gun culture be grow here and you can't i i every morning i scan through the bbc news website
S0255	yeah
S0257	and you get the world news and i i look at the england news and then i look at the local news and in almost every you know category there's either stabbings or shoot
S0255	yeah oh yeah yeah
S0257	and it's i think we're you get a bite numb to it don't you
S0255	yeah
S0257	and and you don't it doesn't register that shock that it should do
S0255	no it doesn't no
S0257	because you're constantly read you're see it all the time
S0255	yeah yeah well i remember well goodness i don't know how old i be i be probably i don't know if i be either a teenager or i be in my twenties because it be somebody who be a few years either older or younger but but
S0257	yeah
S0255	somebody when i be live in erm and they be murder erm and it and it be just there be a girl come home from work and she be say early twenties and and it be she work in pub and she be murder and body be dump quite openly and it be just sort of oh and it and it be a huge huge shock and you think well actually yeah that's thirty odd years ago or so now but
S0257	yeah
S0255	now people be murder all the time and it's i i think in a way because the news be spread more isn't it
S0257	yeah
S0255	we've get access now twenty four hour news and things be put out everywhere and anywhere and everyone's talk about it so i think you're more aware of things that be happen
S0257	i know i do sometimes just scan over headline and and i'll stop myself and i think why hasn't that shock me why haven't i be horrify at read that
S0255	yeah yeah mm
S0257	there be one thing yesterday that absolutely horrify me erm and it be a a the the headline be just baby find burn in road
S0255	oh right
S0257	an an american girl have have have it be a newborn baby she'd dowse it in some erm accelerant and set it alight and dump the poor baby in the road and it be still alive when they find it
S0255	oh god
S0257	and that be that be horrific
S0255	mm
S0257	because it be a a newborn baby
S0255	mm
S0257	and you've be in the situation where you've have baby yourself and and you think oh i could never do that but you know there's there's obviously a reason she's maybe very very unwell but if it have be an adult and there's be
S0255	yeah
S0257	there's be several occasion and you just think oh it's happen again yeah
S0255	oh dear that's a shame yeah
S0257	yeah that's it oh that's another one and it doesn't have the same shock behind it
S0255	not impact no exactly no no
S0257	no no
S0255	no no you're right
S0257	it's just the world we live in i suppose i sound like my no i never know my grandmother but i sound like a grandmother

S0257	oh good you say it's not so busy at the minute
S0256	yeah
S0257	quieten down a bite
S0256	yeah it's nice cos we be get a bite mental in the summer
S0257	yeah i can imagine
S0256	a bite mad but no no it's get a lot er a lot quieter now so it mean we can like look at erm better ourselves and things like that do things that we want to do while it's quieter you can start look at things a bite more
S0257	yes yeah
S0256	and then obviously it get busier again so this be the opportunity to to
S0257	breathe in
S0256	exactly it be definitely mental
S0257	yeah that's the thing when you work in a er like a seasonal company it's it's you don't just plan your day or your week or your month you almost have to plan the year don't you
S0256	yeah we do we've get lot of new people employ erm like this year and try to put things in place to you know when it get quite quite busy but
S0257	mm yeah
S0256	we'll see er we're do a trial at the minute to see whether or not we can eliminate erm all the document need to be send in so i'm part of that which have be quite fun
S0257	oh good
S0256	but we just have to see what management think whether they think long term it's something that'll work or not
S0257	mm
S0256	it's erm there's lot of stuff go on at the minute we're get first aid train at the begin of next month which be one of those three days course
S0257	oh oh wow
S0256	so that should be good be a fully train first aider
S0257	yeah
S0256	i'll be at the minute e
S0255	yeah cos she's get the they do they've get the first aid
S0257	emergency first aid at work
S0255	yeah it's for the main floor so erm this'll be three of us so
S0257	mm that'll be excellent
S0255	mm it's good
S0257	i erm i be emergency first aider at work and that expire just before christmas and i say to erm to our finance director i say i won't renew it for myself to be honest i do it because my children well they weren't little be fifteen would have be eighteen at the time
S0255	mm
S0257	erm and i just think you know when you've get kid it anything can happen and it you you it just help it just give that bite more confidence doesn't it i say but i know that there be some other people that have mention it to me erm that would be interest in do them so i'll give somebody else a chance
S0255	mm
S0257	i need to organise that actually thank you
S0255	i'm just remind you
S0257	yeah yeah but i be think about it in the week cos i take my certificate down so it's leave a space on the wall and every time i walk pass it i think mm
S0255	you see the space it's like ah yes need to do that
S0257	yeah well i'd leave it up over christmas and then register that it be it be out of date you know in the in the in my mind i know it be out of date i need to organise somebody but i think if i take it down it'll be another prod
S0255	tomorrow morning you'll walk in and go ah need to need to do i
S0257	first aid
S0255	have you get room now
S0257	yeah i'm do now thank you
S0256	we already have quite a few first aiders at work
S0255	well it's a big build isn't it
S0257	how many be there people who work there
S0256	well we've get three floor of people erm i think there's i don't think there's a thousand i think it's under a thousand but yeah there's quite a fair few i'm not sure exactly how many we already have quite a few first aiders erm distribute
S0257	yeah
S0256	we've get two on our floor and i'll be the third well in our command area
S0257	yeah cos we've get well we be we've we've be in that build for ten years and as the as the company have grow we've outgrow the build so we've get a whole build which be just two floor there's only twenty six of us there it's not it's not massive by any stretch of the imagination and then five floor down in the business part we've get the lower floor it's the the build be identical we've get the lower floor there with about fourteen people there so there's about forty people altogether so i've get one first aider in that i think we only need one first aider for the number of people but what we've do we've get one on each floor
S0255	yeah it make sense cos if somebody isn't there yeah definitely
S0257	and it cover the holiday and things as well yeah yeah yeah and we've just introduce for the first of january we've just introduce sick pay
S0255	oh right
S0257	our benefit have increase so we be require by our parent company to come up for three years ago in april and at that point we'll all have we've all stay on our own contract so we've get twenty five days holiday plus all the bank holiday parent company you start on twenty days and then after you've do so long i think it's like after you've do two years or a a full calendar year a full january to december so if you start on the second of january no that's the first work day third of january tough tits you've get to do all that year and then a full calendar year
S0255	yeah and then yeah
S0257	you would then get an incremental day's holiday each year erm so we've always be able to say when we're recruit this be one thing that make our benefit package better if you be to work for the group
S0255	yeah
S0257	or when we send people for inductions you know it's don't mention that we get twenty five days holiday cos they don't don't mention that we get bupa because they don't
S0255	yeah
S0257	erm but from the first of january it's be streamline as much as possible so everybody else now get twenty five days but we've also have the be give the opportunity to buy a holiday up to five days and we all also get a day for our birthday
S0255	oh yeah right
S0257	so my birthday's in april and i don't have to take the day i can take any day within my birthday month
S0255	oh that's nice
S0257	and that's a full day yeah it be it be cos and i we always try and take our birthdays off a few days around our birthday erm so i've book mine it's a thursday so i've book thursday friday cos that'll make if we don't do anything that'll just make a really long weekend and i've have take one day out of it to do it and i i've buy three days holiday because last year i take i think about two two and a half days that i take half a day here or a full day there to go and go events
S0255	mm
S0257	erm so i've buy those three days this year so i can still do that but not dip out on my holiday yeah
S0255	not lose your holiday holiday yeah
S0257	yeah
S0255	mm yeah
S0257	erm so that's be really good that's be we think a lot more people might take take it up actually but we haven't have we haven't have a huge number of people but surprisingly they've be from two team there's one team with six people in it and five of them have buy five extra days
S0255	yeah
S0257	so i say to our finance director you know the team er team manager be sign them all off it's one of the busiest team i do hope they're gonna have the resource to cover and extra five weeks of holiday in that team which be what they're basically go to give he say well he's authorise it's his job to cover the resource
S0255	yeah i suppose if they've get the option that they can buy five days holiday he can't say no can he
S0257	no well we do ask this question of hr and they say he'd have to put a very good business case across
S0255	yeah
S0257	and you might say well you've all request five days we because of this or because of work load we'll give you all four days or three days or none of you be go to get it but it'd have to be a business case and all of them be give the same answer but one of the other benefit we've introduce as well be pay sick
S0255	yeah
S0257	pay sicknesses which we haven't have you'd have to be off for four work days and then ssp kick in
S0255	mm
S0257	but erm we've now get pay sick and where be we today eighteenth aren't we yeah it's my niece's birthday yeah the eighteenth and we've have more sickness than than we've have before
S0256	mm that's the thing there isn't i think you know if you're or whatever and you don't get pay for it it can affect things you'll come in even if you feel like absolute death
S0257	well this be what have be say yeah
S0256	whereas now if you've get the option like now if i'm if i'm like in my probation when i felt ill i go in and i really shouldn't have go in at one point my glands be like out here and i be really bad and i have two bouts like that but i still go in because i didn't want to affect my probation now if i get that i'd probably be like i'm not go in
S0257	well this be the thing that we we be talk about it and erm er yeah we're we're a small company our team be i think the largest team have get six people in
S0255	mm
S0257	so there's three four five six people team you know if one person be off it it really impact the others if it's not holiday if it's not plan resource wise
S0255	yeah yeah
S0257	so and also we we just lose a day's pay or two days' pay or whatever it might be so you'd go into work and you'd cough and splutter and then twenty four hours later
S0255	yeah and then your rest of the team
S0257	twenty four hours later somebody else would say oh i've get the you know er i think i'm come down with it erm so we can imagine now instead of people battle for a week and then give in on a friday but they've give it to another four people who be gonna battle for a week and give it another
S0255	yeah
S0257	they'll take a couple of days off get rid of it and come in and nobody else would have catch it and so in the long run
S0255	yeah it be benefit
S0257	it will save on
S0256	well that's that's right i mean we have someone that be on or she she'd have quite a bite of sickness and she have a sickness bug and come in
S0257	er
S0256	and i be like you do realise you've get a sickness like you're gonna pass that on to people
S0255	yeah
S0256	i say it's not fair i say cos like this be last year and i have lot of stuff that i have come up and i be like i cannot be ill cos if i'm ill and i give it to my nan she can't go and visit her sister and she can't do this
S0257	yeah yeah
S0256	and all this sort of stuff and i'm like so you've get to think of the impact and like my friend her erm fiancé his parent his dad i think it be be have get cancer and they've be go in and out of hospital and if she get it she visit him they can't go and visit him and i'm like you get to think of the implications you're do for other people if you've get a sickness bug you need to go home
S0255	yeah sickness be
S0257	you can't manage it at work either can you
S0255	no exactly no
S0256	if you've get a cold you can usually come in but
S0255	yeah that's it's it's to be clever about it isn't it
S0256	yeah yeah this be it but it be a real grotty grotty cold and you're splutter cough try to
S0256	exactly
S0255	yeah couple of days off definitely if it's a bite of a sniffle you think oh actually it's a bite of a sniffle you then you go in don't you
S0256	before christmas like we have our christmas party on friday the twelfth of december but on that day itself erm we have a field base sales team there's only a small number of them but they be all on site cos we have our year end meet we have our award erm and then we have our party in the even and one of the guy that day he say he say to me i feel really ill and i be like oh suck it up come on don't be such a baby you're alright oh you maybe get a bite of a temperature and i can't i i think i might have sort of put my hand on the on his forehead like this you might be a bite warm but i say you're alright don't be such a baby get on with it and the i didn't really see him at the christmas party but apparently he come out with some red mark on his face cos he say to our md typical party night and i come out in spot
S0255	mm mm
S0257	erm and he phone in sick on monday and he say he'd get hand foot and mouth
S0255	mm
S0257	i have that when be little i catch if off her cos it's a it's a child's disease and er three other people come down with it as well so of course we be there say oh what be you do at the christmas party one of them be the md's wife
S0257	one of them be one of our guy in engineer so i don't know how that happen but we think cos they be buy round after round of erm jägerbombs
S0255	yeah
S0257	and they be use the you know the all in one look a bite like a candle holder
S0255	mm
S0257	the all in one erm cup
S0255	yeah
S0257	but we don't think that or glass i think they be plastic but they weren't don't think they be wash them cos they be buy so many at a time
S0255	mm yeah
S0257	it would have be a lot to wash sterilise and get out again
S0255	that's it they probably just swish them out and
S0257	yeah so we think that's how it go around
S0255	or we go back and say oh use the same glass and that somebody actually get mix over or ever just touch the glass if somebody be carry it
S0257	well they put them all on a tray and then the tray be go back so there be absolutely no way you could get the same one again
S0255	no no no
S0257	erm but one of the girls she come she she she phone in they have to phone in every day and speak to me cos she say i feel absolutely fine she say i feel well enough to work
S0255	yeah yeah
S0257	but i'm contagious she say i don't want to lose don't want you to lose money because i be well i'm tell you i'm will to come into work
S0255	yeah
S0257	but chance be that somebody else will catch it from me and when we find out it be on a friday afternoon we think oh god okay i need to tell everybody there's go to be panic so i send out an email to say we've have at that point here instance of this this be what it be this be a link to the nhs website about it have a look at it look out for symptoms i'm come round with antibacterial wipe and we wipe every single surface in that build well in those two build entrance doors light bulbs tap the kettle handle every single thing fridge handle everything we could think of erm so we didn't have sick pay at that point but i i sit down with the finance director on friday and i say look these people have have this you know we say to one of them that's fine we don't want you in we're tell you not to come in cos you're contagious so we'll pay you and she say now it'll be exactly the same for all four of them so yeah something like that like you say about pass things on
S0255	yeah yeah mm
S0257	you don't want anything that's gonna spread
S0256	no exactly like i can't believe most people will manage a cold even if it's a nasty one like you you get it and you're like for goodness sake i've get this cold but you're you're not gonna be lay up for it you know if somebody come in with their sickness bug that can have a big effect on people especially because obviously our office be quite big and we've usually get two or three people pregnant at a time and if it get to them you think it's not fair to give something like that to them
S0257	yeah exactly
S0256	i mean a cold again if someone be pregnant have a cold they have a cold but sickness bug it's not right
S0257	no it's
S0255	no
S0256	cos they've get massive like air condition our air condition vent be huge they're huge machine
S0257	oh god so what it go spread around
S0256	everything spread because obviously we have to keep the air condition in there because and we can't have there there's no windows
S0257	mm
S0256	there's vent but there's no windows cos it's just like a glass build
S0257	yeah
S0256	so obviously the windows be so big someone could jump out of it it be a window so they have vent
S0255	and sometimes they might want to
S0255	god i've have enough
S0256	erm so we have vent but the vent level with the air condition so they stay shut
S0255	mm
S0256	so it's all run on air condition air so everything just get pass round so so fast in our place like you'll hear about it on the second floor and you'll go it's come our way then
S0257	like a wave
S0256	no cos someone we have most of us like in we just tend to stay on our floor apart from when we go down to the eat room like on a break we tend to stay on our floor but we have erm support clerk that walk around the build take post take
S0257	germs
S0256	everything and the mail room yeah and the mail room people as well they walk round the build so there's two lot generally you'll see wander round the build they pass the germs from floor to floor so you just know you're get it if it's on the second floor it's come to the third floor at some point
S0257	yeah
S0256	but erm yeah but
S0257	yeah some of these things you can't avoid can you
S0256	no but if it be yeah usually there's some form of cold or something go round
S0257	erm one of our ladies well a couple of them actually have get really bad erm well one girl she's get she's get food allergies
S0256	yeah
S0257	but it's not just gluten or wheat or nut it's erm she can't eat anything from the oh i can't remember what it's call family of vegetables that include broccoli cabbage sprout there's quite a few in there erm yeast
S0255	mm
S0257	which be in so many more things than you think it's gonna be in
S0255	oh yeah yeah
S0257	cos i say to her the other day erm because she she can't eat flour she can't eat normal gluten or she can't eat normal flour because of the gluten i think it be erm so if there be cake around somebody often bring bring fruit as well and i say to there's grapes she say it's get yeast the grape skin have yeast in them that's what help the wine ferment
S0255	mm yeah
S0257	oh the christmas party organise a meal for her it's
S0255	yeah
S0257	so difficult but it doesn't take much if she accidently eat something that trigger it and she's in agony and you'll see her sit here like this and i'll say to her go home and she'll say i can't afford to lose a day's pay
S0255	yeah
S0257	so she will just sit there in in agony
S0256	mm
S0257	quite literally agony erm until and she just we would see the colour drain from her during the day
S0256	you want to tell her to get erm maybe she's get one like one of those mini hot water bottle cos sometimes that can
S0257	she have them yeah
S0256	cos i cos i if my stomach's play i use one of them i sit with one of them on my stomach and just sit and hold it and it's help with all
S0257	it's it's a bite of a a bite of a erm a laugh point in our office because there be so many girls that for one reason or another one of them be she's get the the figure of a seven year old well she's she's chesty but she's very very tiny she's about a size four i think
S0255	yes yeah
S0257	erm and where she sit she refuse to move cos she like the the the position but it's directly beneath the air con vent but we don't often have the air con on but then when the md be in he like fresh air in his office
S0255	mm
S0257	and erm the the it's the glass wall with the glass door so you haven't get doors that seal erm and when he's not in his office he well even when he's in there the door be open normally unless he's on a private phone call
S0256	yeah that's the same with our with our boss he do
S0257	so if the window be open there's a bite of a a breeze
S0255	yeah
S0257	well i'm where his door open i've get a glass screen that come in front of mine i'm in a little alcove basically so i don't feel anything
S0255	no no
S0257	if it's over warm in the office i don't really notice it be it's drafty i don't feel it if the air con's on i barely get a waft of it
S0255	yeah
S0257	but erm one of the the this lady that i be talk about she'll even in the summer when we don't have the air condition on she'll sit in a thick cardigan because windows be open and there's a nice breeze but she feel she really feel the cold erm and we must have four or five hot water bottle at any line up near the kettle at any stage wait to be fill up again
S0255	yeah
S0257	one of the girls get one for christmas from secret santa
S0255	yeah
S0257	as well cos hers be a bite tatty
S0257	and i knit a cover for one girl
S0255	do you
S0256	the thing be in our build like erm i come in once in summer and i be dress in like in leggings and a dress and i have a cardigan
S0257	yeah
S0256	and go to me you dress for the arctic it's boil i be like my office be so cold
S0257	mm
S0256	it's literally freeze even in the summer you're like freeze
S0257	mm
S0256	because they have to have it because of the way the build be set out it's very it's all open plan
S0257	yeah
S0256	apart from a few offices like we've get erm like there's my boss's boss's boss her they've get individual offices but everyone else we're all in open plan so if one air condition be put up to say it's they're all suppose to be on twenty four or twenty five but then they all have to be on that
S0257	right
S0256	cos if one's put on thirty the ones that be on twenty four start overcompensate
S0257	oh
S0256	and blow out er cold air on a on a constant thing so then if you're in that area you're freeze because someone else be warm but they can't put them all up because then people start moan and say it's too hot so they have they have an agree temperature but that be really cold so most of us be sit there and i i buy a drink in once that be warm i hadn't a sip yet put it on my desk about half an hour later it be cold
S0257	mm mm
S0256	cos the air condition cool it it's just like a giant fridge so you can leave your leave your lunch inside and it's fine
S0257	nice and chill
S0256	yeah but it's it be quite cold i mean like it's not too bad now because they've manage to get it we've get the air condition so it's mostly now it's warm where i be sit i be directly under where it hit
S0257	yeah
S0256	and i be cold constantly so my boss move me erm she swap me someone else and i've now sit and it would actually it go just over me now it's not bad but i be literally freeze i be sit in my coat it'd be that cold it's like we can't do this and we have sort of like a phase where we don't know why but it be blow i think it be because we've get heat but they'd move a load of erm cos they be do like renovation work around the corner they'd move all the lockers in front of one set of heat our set of heat be already cover by cupboards so we have no heat near us so we be sit and my my friend actually go home early use some of her her flexi time to go home early because she be so cold
S0257	that's rubbish isn't it
S0256	yeah and we should it's not fair we say this be ridiculous we move our heat be already block that's next to us cos you go to the cupboard to get something out oh paper's warm workboxes again be we that's fine cos you can't the the heat just doesn't come over
S0257	no no no
S0256	and then the ones we do have then get block in as well and we be like but now they've move them back in cos they've do the work they've move the lockers back so it's actually it's be lovely
S0257	heatwave
S0256	it's nice it's actually a bite warm it's not not hot but it's a bite warmer that in it be so so silly i just think if you're cold you should be able to put the heat up or put the turn the air con down but no cos everyone else's go mad but i think as well part of them be where they've get the air condition units you've get the heaters and then directly above them there's the air condition so i think the heat go up and the air condition think it's hotter than it be and then it blow off cold
S0257	probably do
S0257	who plan that
S0256	i don't it's so so such a silly design and i don't know i think it be the only place they could put the erm air condition vent that where a group sort of like by the i don't know health and safety and everyone like that so that they distribute it right but they be just directly above the heat which mean that they just don't know what the temperature be and it's like it's not twenty four degrees in here it feel more like sort of fifteen sixteen degrees it's really cold
S0257	yeah
S0256	i be just think of get 's temperature gauge thing and just temparturing around the office just to say
S0257	actually
S0256	that's not right
S0257	yeah
S0256	but there's nothing they can do it about it now because the way it's design be the way it's design i don't think they can change it
S0257	mm
S0256	er no somebody we'll be sit there and somebody'll go oh the air conditioning's go on cos obviously it's one of the ones that go on a lot like it's on power save so when so we get a draft like blow in your ear it's like year air conditioning's come on
S0257	yeah our boiler not last winter the winter yeah it be last winter actually our boiler pack up so we have to get a quote for a replacement then we have to book it in to get it replace so for about two weeks we have no heat so i have to hire industrial heaters they be like rocket
S0255	yeah space heaters
S0257	glow orange with this heat come out oh god have to hire these all around the build it be lovely it be so toasty with this warm air blow instead of just a radiator emit a bite of heat
S0255	yeah
S0257	actually have the warm air blow around
S0257	but it be so dry we be drink tonnes and all erm you know dry lips dry skin as well so of course we be complain
S0255	we've get one of those the erm the big ones
S0257	yeah
S0255	it's down in the garage have a few years ago for something and when i use to sell the sock they be all in the garage and i use to go down to pack and it's absolutely freeze in a winter and i use to put that one him he could walk in and it be like he he'd say be you alright i would say yes i'm fine thank you
S0256	but your hand would be so numb
S0257	oh be a
S0256	you wouldn't be able to the bits to stick on the
S0257	no i know to put it on the packet
S0256	i use to i use to go and put it on
S0255	yeah it's like this little tiny garage and and you just go on and then it be so warm you'd turn it off and almost straightaway you'd see the temperature would just drop because it doesn't keep it warm do it
S0257	no
S0255	wasn't insulate in the garage anyway so
S0256	mm but i i be tell when i have it on that you have to leave the garage door open just a little bite
S0255	yeah they tell me that for the fume you know so you'd have the garage door open about a little bite and then they'd go more than that more than that then he'd open it about that much and then we use to have the dog then didn't we and be sort of come come duck his head under
S0256	i use to like that though cos he use he use to pop in we use you know there be as barrier of where we could go cos he didn't come to close to the sock cos he moult like anything so he'd get them cover with dog hairs so you know he'd come in then come and just stand and look at me and he'd stand there for another couple of minutes and he'd keep me company and then he'd be like right i'm go
S0257	yeah
S0256	so i'd always let him out even if it be like
S0257	it's not interest
S0256	exactly sock i'd always let him out cos i'd know that i have to keep a bite of an eye on him cos he be he'd he'd come in and out he be just like to come and say hello and then he'd come and sit with me for little bite and i'd carry on with what i be do and then he'd go off and come back in about fifteen minutes later come to
S0257	yeah
S0256	wasn't excite he be like let's go for a walk let's go see what she's up to
S0256	it be nice keep keep keep you company you felt like you be be watch and like dog's there bless him
S0257	would you have another dog if you didn't travel as much
S0255	well i i wouldn't have a dog at all cos i'm not into animals at all apart from fish
S0257	mm
S0255	erm would like a dog but it's like you say we're not here enough and he say you know maybe later on when he retire but then have say that we want to be you know travel more erm you'd like one you say when you get your own place and would like one but the thing be if you're on your own somewhere who look after the dog when you're at work and
S0257	mm or if you have yeah if you have to go away or
S0256	i suppose it depend because like a lot there's people that i know that do have dog and they both and they both work but what they tend to do be i know she they tend to work different shift because her fiancé be a policeman
S0255	mm
S0256	so well he she'll leave early in the morning and he'll do
S0255	mm
S0256	like up to a point and then he go he go to london or wherever it be he's work for the day and then she get back at half finish at half three and come home
S0257	yeah
S0255	mm
S0256	and she do that and in in the day sometimes cos they've get a puppy
S0257	mm
S0256	so the puppy need a lot more look after and they've also get
S0257	yeah
S0256	they've also get a bigger dog that's now safe an ex police dog which be he be a he didn't take it in when it get to a certain point because it get injure erm they be go to have to put him to sleep cos no no one else could handle it obviously
S0255	no
S0257	yeah
S0256	apart from him and he could then train it and cos he he'd be the trainer so with it be a big dog he take it he he take it home so it's it's fine with meet but just er so they go and look after it in the day the parent sometimes but then who work at the rink a friend of mine he erm he have a dog and he's there in the day but then he work in the even so he he's there in the day with the dog and then obviously go into work come home let the dog out but it's late so then it's all be do
S0255	mm mm yeah dog can be leave for so many hours anyway can't they it's just it's yeah
S0257	oh yeah ours be brilliant holly be really really good i mean i use to go home at lunchtime and the girls use to pop in to see her
S0255	mm
S0257	and would pop in from school at lunch and this sort of thing erm she's she's remarkable like
S0255	mm
S0257	we come down in the morning the first thing i do be let the cat in or if the cat's be in overnight if it's be really cold first thing i would let her out
S0255	yeah
S0256	escape
S0257	yeah go for wee and then she's back again to come straight back in
S0255	yeah yeah
S0257	erm holly won't go out
S0255	mm
S0257	she won't go out in the morning for a wee
S0255	no
S0257	no and i'll try it again before we all go to work
S0255	mm
S0257	she might if she if she go out she run down the path and go at the gate and then back in again she doesn't go out to wee
S0255	mm mm no
S0257	and then we get home from work erm cos we'd come home like i say at lunchtime or the girls would pop in and they'd say mum holly won't go out
S0255	mm mm
S0257	come home from work she'd do the same run down the path and back again and it's only then normally we'll get change and take her straight out
S0255	yeah
S0257	and when she's half way round the park she'll go right i'll have my wee now
S0255	yeah
S0257	ah and she's there forever and you see her little face but she's give all these opportunities and she say she hold it and hold it and hold it
S0255	yeah
S0256	i think it's when when you take your dog for a walk generally they get use to go on the walk so they don't go in the garden
S0257	yeah
S0255	no cos it's they think it's like an extension of the house that they shouldn't go in maybe
S0257	yeah
S0256	yeah yeah exactly whereas the girls go in the garden because they don't go for walk they've get such a big garden that they the back door's open pretty much all day and they just run in and out and come and run as round as much as they want
S0257	yeah
S0255	mm
S0256	so they go out in the garden
S0257	yeah
S0256	but again they'll only go there's certain areas that they'll go in
S0257	yes yeah
S0256	cos it's they're the areas they're suppose to use
S0257	yeah
S0256	so i think that's what it be the dog when you take them for a walk that's when they go to the loo so if you take her for a walk in the morning she probably would go
S0257	yeah probably probably
S0255	mm
S0256	even if you literally just take her for a quick loop round the round the
S0257	park yeah
S0256	like round the place or whatever then she probably would go
S0255	one of these days you'll find there's a tiny little pool behind one of the chair you haven't realise and she just go and just a little bite of a release
S0256	well dog be pretty good they'll only go if they're absolutely desperate
S0255	yeah
S0256	like we've have occasionally over the road where they've be in for a while and you can tell they're desperate cos they go to the door and then they go by the door cos they know they're suppose to be go out but they they can't actually go out
S0257	yeah close as they can get
S0255	mm
S0256	the thing be you be like you say you've let them out and they haven't go so you think oh they're fine and then all of the sudden it's like oh okay you need to go okay that's fine
S0257	yeah the only time holly's it's be an accident because she's be unwell
S0256	yeah
S0257	that's the only time she'll
S0256	but then then they'll look and be like oh look mum i'm really sorry i shouldn't have go in the house
S0257	yeah oh yesterday i be make dinner last night and i hear go holly holly no no oh god holly no and then i hear again and she'd be out eat grass
S0255	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0257	and he he be cross with her and i say why he say cos she do it on the live room carpet i say but she be sick
S0255	yeah
S0256	yeah
S0257	and he say yes but she be sick cos she eat the grass
S0256	she eat the grass cos she be unwell
S0257	yeah but she eat the grass cos she didn't feel well
S0255	that's right they eat the grass to make themselves be sick because they know they're not well
S0257	yeah
S0255	yeah exactly
S0257	yeah i mean she shouldn't have ask to come back in i guess but i don't know
S0255	yeah but if you feel poorly you want to come in
S0257	yeah but you can't
S0256	on the floor it's like you know you can't help it can you
S0257	yeah no no
S0256	paige paige sit on my lap sometimes she'll get up and she's a labrador she sit on my lap and she'll sit there sometimes and she'll go and i'll go and she'll go
S0257	yeah
S0256	she get it's cos she's get older and she do it a lot
S0255	mm
S0256	and she nibble on her own hair a lot i think she's get hair
S0257	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0256	like and hair but i'm literally like don't you dare be sick on me keep your head that way she go
S0257	i've clean up so much child sick and
S0255	yeah yeah
S0257	i really can't be do with it and i say to it's your dog before we get holly cos i wouldn't've ever have a dog
S0255	no
S0257	i've never i've never have one never interest in have one so i say okay if if if we get one it's your dog you clean up after it
S0255	mm mm
S0257	you have to be the one commit to walk her i don't want to walk her all the time
S0255	no
S0257	and this time of year when it's dark i don't want to go out
S0255	no
S0257	so will say i guess i'm walk her then and i'm like yeah it's
S0255	your dog
S0257	you sign up for it i didn't
S0255	yeah
S0257	no i've i've me and my cat
S0255	mm
S0257	she's great i love the independence that cat have yeah she can't
S0256	whereas i prefer dog cos they like be all cuddly and need you
S0255	mm
S0257	well my cat i know you get some really standoffish cat
S0256	yeah
S0257	and some really snotty hoity toity cat but mine's brill she's so lovely
S0255	mm
S0256	yeah
S0257	and she'll even allow the dog to lay near her
S0257	and she she'll be all curl up and the dog will get up on my lap
S0255	mm
S0257	in fact we buy her for christmas it's a lap blanket a lap mat so on one side it's fleece
S0255	mm yeah
S0257	and on the other side it's it's fabric and actually and her boyfriend my eldest daughter they buy her the same thing just a different design as well so she's get these in two place
S0255	yeah
S0257	so i'll have that on my lap and the cat and my knit or something
S0255	mm
S0257	and and holly'll holly love to sit between and i on the sofa and me and the the cat will be like this and she'll open one eye and she'll watch the dog walk to the sofa and then she'll open the other eye and she'll watch the dog get on and holly's tail be this long and it's that thick
S0255	mm mm yeah
S0257	she's she's labrador collie greyhound cross she's get this stupid thick long heavy tail that's constantly do that
S0256	yeah they do
S0257	and the number of time she'll whack the cat
S0255	mm
S0257	and the poor cat will go fly
S0257	cos she can't bear it and then holly's all smug and she'll put her her head on my lap and just try and fill the space that she's just accidently create
S0257	and yet the when it's too warm holly won't sit with us
S0255	mm
S0257	cos you you just it get too warm for her so if the cat's on the other sofa holly will climb on it so carefully
S0255	mm
S0257	and she'll turn around and she'll make sure she doesn't knock her because she know that the cat wouldn't in that instance the cat wouldn't get off she'd swipe at her
S0255	yeah yeah
S0257	so she turn around
S0256	she know she's get she's get back up when she get on the sofa she'll like i've get back up you can't hurt me yeah
S0257	she make it so obvious yeah she make herself as small as possible and she's a big thing
S0256	yeah
S0257	as small as possible and sit all cramp up on the sofa and the cat's get all this space and again the cat's like that
S0255	mm watch her
S0257	she's lift her head up
S0255	but maybe holly actually just want to have company on the sofa and she know if she get on there and disturb the cat the cat'll get off and go over and see you
S0257	yeah
S0255	or either way it's like but i want i want to sit on the sofa with somebody

S0255	yeah where he be they could see him yeah
S0256	so they could see him and all they all just keep shout at him to get him to come up the siblings be and the the parent have say no they be like we're not gonna
S0255	no
S0256	give in to his tantrum but every every single woman that come out be like oh you could see them like oh god and then then they see the parent and they're like oh that's someone's child come out and they have little heart mini heart attack and then you see them come out but no it's fine that you're not give in to his tantrum but you make lot of people really panic think the kid's lose his parent cos near him
S0257	i've see cry children before and i'm just really conscious and it's perhaps the wrong thing but really conscious of get involve

S0256	well that's the thing i think it's when you just
