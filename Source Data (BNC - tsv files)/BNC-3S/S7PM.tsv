S0588	i've be relive our previous conversations
S0613	that must be very er surreal actually
S0588	it's
S0613	it's like this sound familiar
S0588	it's it's interest to see how i interact and
S0613	yes cos you're analyse yourself
S0588	yeah
S0613	aren't you it's yeah
S0588	but i'm i seem to vary a lot sometimes i sound really confident and other time absolutely a bite of a social disaster
S0613	but you erm
S0588	and
S0613	you can't put tone of voice in can you in the record can you
S0588	no no no that it's just the word but
S0613	right
S0588	for the thing
S0613	you can't put in bracket she say with great confidence
S0588	no
S0588	but manage to do a few with as well when he be here
S0613	oh right get a nice
S0588	but with here it's excellent
S0613	load and load of material
S0588	yeah but they've reach nine million word now er that have be transcribe
S0613	right
S0588	and i think they only need ten million so must be near the end of it
S0613	do that no no but but be your contract on a number of word or the time that
S0588	no well contract's on till i've get till the end of april at the moment
S0613	right
S0588	it keep be renew but i think it must be near the end unless the research go on in some other form so i'm face that the usual sort of blank thing that i face when one job come to an end and there isn't another one and not know what's come next what be i go to do next
S0613	mm something generally seem to come along doesn't it
S0588	yeah it always do and erm but it's another good reason for get i'm not just like you for your voice
S0588	i it's just
S0588	opportunity to er
S0588	get the money in while i can
S0613	so
S0588	but sometimes i yeah i've have to resist do it cos i've start think hear a conversation and think god i wish i be record that
S0613	yeah it's so erm so actually we're we're pay pay rent in word which i think
S0588	you be
S0613	be rather lovely isn't it
S0588	all you have to do be talk and that's
S0613	yeah
S0588	just fantastic
S0613	i'll pay you in word
S0588	but 's already pay with a toilet i mean we buy the toilet but he he enable a toilet to happen
S0613	he facilitate the toilet
S0588	he facilitate it so
S0588	i mean
S0613	yeah
S0588	it's fantastic cos it's kind of life change in a
S0613	oh yeah not not have proper proper bathroom be a bite depress isn't it
S0588	well yeah it's one of those things that
S0613	or a fully functional one
S0588	it work so well and it be life change
S0613	yeah say he be rather enjoy it as well
S0588	oh it's just brilliant he just just can't allow it to happen to have a a a
S0613	well
S0588	crappy loo with
S0613	well the thing be if you've get if you've get the skills
S0588	yeah
S0613	to do it
S0588	and you know how simple it be to do
S0613	mm then you kind of can't resist can you
S0588	no i'd be like that if i have his skills everything would just be do if i have
S0613	yeah why would you
S0588	his skills
S0613	put up with something
S0588	you wouldn't you wouldn't even have to wait for stuff you'd just do it
S0613	well yeah except then like 's job list at home be be miles long cos then he get a bite overambitious and he's get all these things he want to do
S0588	oh
S0613	and there's literally not enough time
S0588	yeah i suppose you just yeah the more you're capable of do the more there end up to
S0613	yeah cos he won't pay someone else to do it you see
S0588	i know
S0613	say why should i pay someone else when i can do it myself
S0588	well yes he be say that bite low on milk but you just wouldn't want someone else to do it if you know the ins and out of it
S0613	but do he tell you plumb be his least favourite thing
S0588	no he didn't
S0613	yeah
S0588	no i didn't know it be his most least favouritest thing er
S0613	not that at all it's terribly complicate if the plumbing's already there you know it's just a case of
S0588	yeah
S0613	reconnecting another one
S0588	but i think it's probably just worse for guests than it be for us have a dodgy toilet i mean i've hear come down to try to fill up the tank thing and stick in there with something embarrass and
S0588	you know it's alright if it's just and me
S0613	yeah yeah be say the same
S0588	yes so
S0613	and nobody want to use the toilet cos you can't get rid of what
S0588	no
S0588	what you've leave behind this one's absolutely brilliant doesn't even take an exertion just press a button
S0613	mm
S0613	yes the other one you felt there be a certain way that you have to erm
S0588	it be absolute technique
S0613	you know
S0588	that you have to know
S0613	all in the wrist action
S0588	yeah be you still work in for the next few days or
S0613	mm
S0588	be you finish
S0613	i've get erm one more day i've get tomorrow
S0588	oh right
S0613	erm so it's actually tomorrow morning but what i'm gonna do i'm work in and i'm gonna do that then come back to here and fetch my bag i'm not gonna lug it all the way into town cos i've notice try to get in with a big bag during rush hour be
S0588	yeah
S0613	be really it's really challenge so i think i'd just shoot in cos it's actually 's not too bad to get to erm i can just go all the way on the dlr then jump on the circle line
S0588	yeah
S0613	in theory
S0588	do you want to do your own milk
S0613	thank you then i've get to go from street for my train so that again isn't too bad for me
S0588	mm
S0613	and i'm go home
S0588	at last
S0613	mm yes home for a bite bet you're look forward to have your house back as well aren't you
S0588	well it'll be nice but it's be okay have people come and go yeah it's nice to have peace and quiet again
S0613	yeah
S0588	and erm 's absolutely lovely but then i find that i've have enough of her after but it didn't take it take quite a while for me to have have enough of her this time
S0613	mm
S0588	so cos she's very entertain and fun and happy and everything
S0613	she be show me picture of her place in erm greece last night
S0588	oh be she
S0613	well i think she'd be talk to about it you see so she say
S0588	yes
S0613	have have have tell you about the house in greece and i go no
S0588	oh god
S0613	she well let me show you
S0613	and she want us to go to see her
S0588	yes
S0613	it do look beautiful
S0588	oh i'm sure yeah it well you should if you want to
S0613	and the think of have a ten minute
S0588	go
S0613	a one minute walk down the road
S0588	yeah
S0613	and to be able to go swim
S0588	well i i i mean i'm intend to go at some point when it's when we can do it cheaply enough but erm yeah you should
S0613	no but i say to her i say why why be you here when when the weather's so miserable and you've get a place like that
S0588	yeah
S0613	cos it's sixteen degrees out there at the moment
S0588	i think she's get sort of medical stuff to deal with as well
S0613	right
S0588	but i mean she often be there so but er just it's lovely to be so positive and happy all the time but i can't help think that's a bite weird but that must be cos there's that i'm
S0613	no i know i know what you mean i think well i can't be that that
S0588	i know
S0613	normally
S0588	yeah but i mean it's really bad that i think that but i do think that i think oh how could you maintain such happiness but she just do she be just happy
S0613	maybe it's not a case of
S0588	a happy person
S0613	of be actively happy it's a case of just not let the bad things that happen spoil spoil their life
S0588	no she no she doesn't because whereas she's she doesn't get sensitise she's not sensitise by everything that happen or everything happen and it just sort of brush off her cos there's always negativity
S0613	mm
S0588	around but it doesn't affect her
S0613	but also cos there be a kind of acceptance cos she's say to me we she be talk about how er her when her cancer first get diagnose in greece cos they miss it here
S0588	yes
S0613	and erm say then you you know this be age later and she go to have erm er a a breast check for breast cancer as
S0588	mm
S0613	you do when you get to a certain age and erm
S0588	mm
S0613	and she say she be joke with the nurse cos she be say well i should think er it's work the way up my body she say i i've have cervical cancer i've have ovarian cancer so now it's now it's time for breast cancer and she they they kind of the nurse couldn't believe that she be make a almost a joke out of it
S0588	yeah
S0613	but then there be also kind of a sense of well if it's that's what's gonna happen that's what's gonna happen so
S0588	and that's what
S0613	and there's no
S0588	that's why she's still here as well be cos er
S0613	yeah there's no point
S0588	an incredible er positivity or i be gonna say spin it's not spin it's just
S0613	it's just you do what you need to do cos there's if you can't change something
S0588	yeah
S0613	there's no
S0588	yeah
S0613	mm i suppose although she do take it very well when she tell me how they'd completely miss it in the uk and she you know she be about to go on holiday and and the the doctor say oh erm there be er the severity of the problem and he say oh don't worry i'll do the test when you get back which be in four months' time
S0588	right
S0613	and if they hadn't find it in greece
S0588	yes
S0613	it could have really
S0588	yeah
S0613	i mean it be pretty far go
S0588	that would have be curtain
S0613	as it be and you kind of think i would be really angry about that it's like
S0588	yeah
S0613	there's some incompetent doctor
S0588	but then
S0613	and you nearly die
S0588	on on the other hand the anger would be would not do the cancer any good
S0613	no
S0588	so even then
S0613	no
S0588	even then
S0613	but i suppose
S0588	you need sort of somehow process it in a different way
S0613	yeah but it's like you use your anger to to tell somebody what what have happen because it's really bad because it shouldn't happen that
S0588	mm
S0613	shouldn't happen to anybody
S0588	yeah the
S0613	it doesn't need to happen
S0588	yeah
S0613	you know it's not
S0588	no no
S0613	it's bad enough have cancer but have someone that's not bother to
S0588	but i would
S0613	diagnose it
S0588	i would expect it and i think our nxs nhs be brilliant but i don't expect i i think that we're so responsible for our own body that it would be up to me to know and press for it or find out or somehow
S0613	but if it's something internal how be you suppose to know
S0588	yeah but i wouldn't trust them even if they say i don't i never do i don't really trust them but they're there to be use and utilise and everything
S0613	mm
S0588	but i i wouldn't rely on what they i i actually i wouldn't rely on what a doctor tell me really but it's kind of more in in the ball's in your court but you go and kind of use them
S0613	mm
S0588	in a way but erm
S0613	yes i suppose you could insist like no i like when you know
S0588	erm
S0613	because then then you say well do i cancel my holiday
S0588	well no but
S0613	because i need to have this test or
S0588	it's just that i hear a lot of well in transcribe as well but there be a lot of passitivity passivity
S0613	mm
S0588	with medical stuff and people talk like oh and i've get this and the doctor say that and i've get this and er and then it's kind of sound very passive and i would go well have you do you
S0613	yeah
S0588	think that maybe that might affect it what you be eat or i don't know just a bite more
S0613	yeah
S0588	kind of proactivity on it
S0613	yeah
S0588	there seem to be just an acceptance and
S0613	but also
S0588	mm
S0613	expect doctor to be like
S0588	yes
S0613	magicians
S0588	yeah
S0613	it's like
S0588	no i mean they're just people
S0613	they should cure me and
S0588	yeah
S0613	it's as simple as that it's that you know
S0588	well they give me a pill and he say this and it's like what you know they're just a human
S0613	mm
S0588	they can't
S0613	yeah
S0588	they can't know not really they've get good knowledge and stuff but they can't know really anyway i know what i mean but
S0613	yeah
S0588	er
S0613	yeah no and also i think i i'm begin to realise as well that it's it's not an an exact science not the exact science
S0588	no
S0613	we're lead to believe it be
S0588	exactly
S0613	so there's a bite of detective work involve
S0588	completely and it's all
S0613	erm
S0588	it's all a bite random really
S0613	yes and it's a lot of it be luck whether they
S0588	and plus all the stuff they don't know about probably
S0613	yeah
S0588	so it's all i think it's in our hand it really be a lot of it be in our hand but more in our hand than we're educate to believe cos there's also this or if i be gonna get really into sort of erm what do they call it er i've forget what the word be a conspiracy almost a
S0613	oh right
S0588	conspiracy theory to
S0613	mm
S0588	take the control away cos also the control have kind of i think there's more control than we know i just think there be
S0613	yeah
S0588	but it's just
S0613	well yeah
S0588	an instinct
S0613	mm
S0588	and i can't prove that
S0613	yeah
S0588	and you you can never battle with science either because they in conspiracy speak have science on their side
S0613	yes and they know stuff that's
S0588	that i don't
S0613	that we be not suppose to know so therefore we should
S0588	and it's provable and it's only stuff that's provable that be there
S0613	mm
S0588	and anything outside of that and it's like the way they don't they don't consider diet really odd they do with maybe diabetes but only just
S0613	mm
S0588	and the whole thing be base on diet the whole diabetes thing be diet
S0613	yeah
S0588	it's just it doesn't come about type two it be purely that
S0613	well they
S0588	mad
S0613	they treat symptoms don't they they don't
S0588	mm
S0613	erm i mean they don't have a holistic approach where they go look at the whole lifestyle
S0588	yeah
S0613	and the body and everything and go
S0588	mm
S0613	how be you live your life it would be
S0588	but that's to do with the individual that need to understand that there's an element of responsibility
S0613	there be probably a lot of doctor themselves don't even
S0588	oh no
S0613	know how to live their live
S0588	and smoke and drink
S0613	yeah
S0588	and
S0613	yeah
S0588	yeah
S0613	yes it's like if something's if something's not work properly you can just treat that and
S0588	mm
S0613	try and make it work properly
S0588	fix it
S0613	mm i think shop malls be a conspiracy as well the way they keep build more shop cos it's a distraction
S0588	yeah
S0613	isn't it cos they when there be the erm the recession everyone keep say we need to keep the economy move you need to go out and spend money
S0588	yeah
S0613	it's like
S0588	it's a bite odd isn't it
S0613	hang on but no one's get any money so
S0588	but that i find it really hard to believe that no one have any money because then they build that shop centre in
S0613	yeah and it's cram full to people
S0588	then it's like where be they all get the money from
S0613	yes
S0588	and i'm think i don't have any money to spend here and it's pack
S0613	yeah
S0588	with people spend load of money and bag and stuff and they're they don't look like they've get load of money but they're there spend it and so what what's go on
S0613	yes i i find that a bite of a mystery
S0588	it's really odd
S0613	i must admit yeah
S0588	yeah
S0613	and also probably a good ninety percent of what they're buy be stuff they don't actually need
S0588	i would say at least ninety percent yeah
S0613	which be
S0588	i mean that be a conspiracy because that's what make the world go round so
S0613	so we we're all have to keep work
S0588	yeah
S0613	in order to earn this money to buy stuff that we don't actually really need
S0588	yeah
S0613	so
S0588	but you have to be
S0613	we don't have time to do anything else
S0588	it's quite you have to be quite strong to step out of it and realise that it's a conspiracy really it be a conspiracy
S0613	mm and if there's a bite of wasteland or a bite of anything people build build shop on it
S0588	mm gotta do something with it haven't you yeah
S0613	and when when there aren't enough cheap home so it's like well why don't you
S0588	yeah
S0613	build cheap home and and basic shop that people need and school
S0588	yeah
S0613	and a hospital things that people need to live their live
S0588	mm
S0613	erm and meet place and you know community centre and place where people can can get together and and do activities if they want to and things that build community rather than
S0588	mm
S0613	shop which be like horrible spooky ghost towns in the even when they shut
S0588	yeah and they're an alternative reality though there's that element as well and like cos money doesn't come into it when you're in there oh it's weird
S0613	mm
S0588	but you do have to step out well i don't know i wonder what it would be like if you have enough money i'm just step out of it cos i don't have any but
S0613	yeah
S0588	what would it be like if you do
S0613	well it depend what you mean by enough though cos
S0588	mm
S0613	cos if you i think you whatever you have you you you spend it don't you like if you're a millionaire if you be richard branson you would
S0588	yeah
S0613	expect to have a fleet of helicopters and and and home all over the world and and this whole
S0588	mm
S0613	entourage to to look after everything that you need and so you would have to spend a lot of money to maintain that so it's a completely different set of expectations isn't it so
S0588	yeah but i never feel poor but i've i've always be poor but
S0613	mm
S0588	i don't feel poor
S0613	no i know what you no
S0588	it's no but i mean especially since we buy this house we you can't you can't really feel poor when
S0613	no
S0588	you've get a house it's
S0613	no
S0588	and er in fact the need to spend have be lessen
S0613	yes
S0588	cos of that funny old business but i think yeah i think there's conspiracies everywhere that's definitely one but people want you to part with cash all the time cos we need cash so everyone's try to grab it
S0613	mm
S0588	i'm try to grab cash as well wherever i can really
S0613	yeah
S0588	you know
S0613	but it's like but then we're all er work so hard and and do things
S0588	mm
S0613	live lifestyles that you know probably spend too
S0613	mm
S0588	but they couldn't step out of it
S0613	yeah because you're terrify you don't want to sacrifice your own children you think if we let them
S0588	mm
S0613	just stray and do their own thing
S0588	or nothing
S0613	and and they
S0588	or even worse do nothing
S0613	yeah
S0613	yeah then somehow
S0613	you know what if they then can't look after themselves and after the parent have die or whatever what be they gonna do if they can't look after
S0588	well
S0613	themselves
S0588	this be this be our parent this be my parent to me
S0613	mm
S0588	er and i do i do grow up and see their point but erm and it be there's this big blank when you're sixteen
S0588	there be a lot of er
S0613	try to convince their children to
S0588	actually exertion of pressure on and he be handle it very well the
S0613	can you but you don't actually really appreciate
S0588	no but on the other that it doesn't
S0613	thank you
S0588	matter ring a few bell with me because i remember ask the same question and sort of like oh you don't ask that

S0588	you can't do anything
S0613	but she say to have to stand by and just
S0588	watch it it's like watch
S0613	you know
S0588	a car crash happen yeah
S0613	and then so we be talk about it and i be say and i so maybe you know there do come a point where you can't do anything and you just have to let them do what they're go to do and either that's kind of make or break cos either then they go
S0588	yeah
S0613	oh there isn't a safety net i'm go to have to find a way of manage my life somehow
S0588	they either sink or swim
S0613	yeah or they go under which
S0588	yeah
S0613	must be awful
S0588	if they go under they can still come up again of course but that be awful
S0588	and we all want that in the end
S0613	but you see but that's such a a it's all what what do people mean by a decent standard of live
S0588	well
S0613	i mean be
S0588	well
S0613	be able to have a television in each room
S0588	i think
S0613	and buy
S0588	in
S0613	designer clothe and you know what be
S0588	yeah
S0613	what be it
S0588	whole lifestyle package and
S0613	be you have your your children
S0588	i think how dare you you know it's a life
S0613	yeah
S0588	how dare you make that decision on that basis it's so crap i hate that be it's so oh i want a tv and i want a baby
S0613	mm
S0613	just have an accessory isn't it oh
S0613	do i have a dog shall i have a dog or
S0588	just and thoughtless but of course i don't know i i'm i'm only speak on what i think i don't know what the ins and out of it be but you know
S0613	mm
S0588	and no wonder they just think that you're gonna just take on the same thing i suppose
S0613	let's just perpetuate the whole thing
S0588	but they i mean i don't know what my parent erm i say my parent just to not put it on everybody else i'm speak to like but
S0613	the parent that you know
S0588	the parent that i know
S0588	have some value and i never really understand what they be but i know that i be a source of fear and something they weren't happy with because i really wasn't go anywhere so and because of that that be but on the other hand ironically i think if the thing that wasn't go anywhere have just have a bite of support i might have go somewhere
S0613	yeah
S0588	so but i be sort of trap in the middle so yeah
S0613	mm it's the chicken and egg isn't it
S0588	it didn't get any support so anything that i might have be wouldn't have
S0613	yeah
S0588	become anything erm and so i kind of end up not very rich i don't know just
S0613	yeah but
S0588	but but on the other hand i think that be lucky enough to just want money anyway so that fit i do think that
S0613	he's get a different get of genes
S0588	yeah
S0613	i i don't know er
S0588	well
S0613	the way his mind work be very
S0588	well we've all get we've get different
S0613	mm
S0588	genes but i i think that if you're set on money it would have be alright so we're back down to the same value system really probably not as you know not load of money but orient towards
S0613	but alright in what sense alright in that your parent think that it's
S0588	acceptable that you're on the right track
S0613	yeah but i dunno if that make you alright as a
S0588	well that that that that mean that
S0613	i mean generally
S0588	you can have a conversation with them but if you're not
S0613	yeah
S0588	anywhere near those value which i wasn't then you can't even
S0613	mm
S0588	you don't have any bridge at all
S0613	yeah it's really really painful isn't it until you're actually old enough to erm just be who you're gonna be and say well you either take me as i be or not at all and you can't do that when you're a teenager you just haven't get the the confidence or the the strength to do that have you
S0588	well you might do but i i didn't
S0613	well very er very oh few i mean they might they might not bravado about it but they the but inside it it's it's
S0588	mm
S0613	completely destroy them to to have their parent reject
S0588	mm
S0613	who they be they might pretend it doesn't matter but
S0588	it's so fundamental though
S0613	yeah
S0588	and it be terrible
S0613	i mean i've notice certainly about teenagers now there's there's an awful lot of sort of in front of your friends you make out that everything's really cool and you can handle it all
S0588	mm yeah
S0613	you you i always notice when i phone and on the phone you can always tell when there's other people in the room
S0613	cos they're different
S0588	oh okay
S0613	they're different from when they're on their own
S0588	yeah
S0613	what they'll say and the way they'll react and everything so
S0588	mm
S0613	it's a lot of i'm not go to admit that anything be i'm fragile or anything
S0588	right
S0613	if my friend's there
S0588	yeah oh yeah
S0613	so that's another pressure that they're they're they're they've get because they can't appear to be weak in front of their contemporaries
S0588	mm oh
S0613	there's
S0588	well i don't know what that's like now i can't i yeah depend who they're hang out with and who they be i suppose as well i just hang out with a few other reject so it be kind of alright i suppose
S0613	yeah
S0588	but
S0613	yeah
S0588	not exactly reject but
S0613	no it's no be talk about her her like a a mock exam and erm be i speak to her at the and i say how do it go and she be all like oh it be all a disaster i get all that wrong but
S0588	in a kind of
S0588	bravo way
S0613	yeah a flippant kind of way
S0613	and i think no i've see you in flood of tear
S0588	yeah
S0613	when you've get you know
S0613	and so
S0588	be there other people there
S0613	yeah there be other people there so she couldn't be see to kind of
S0588	mm
S0613	or either that or actually she'd do alright but it be kind of cool to go oh i be a disaster
S0588	yeah
S0613	kind of thing it's
S0588	mm
S0613	so so you kind of have to play a okay so why be it a disaster oh i completely misunderstand all the question what really all of them
S0613	well yes
S0613	yeah
S0588	yeah
S0613	okay
S0588	mm
S0613	mm no actually doesn't do that he never do 's a different different kettle of fish
S0588	's turn into a right charmer though so that's er a whole other thing
S0613	yes
S0588	oh they're alright i think they'll survive
S0613	i well it's early days
S0613	it's early days i mean we're all late developers in our family i i'll give them to the early twenties before the crisis hit i think so
S0588	mm
S0613	also you can get away with so much when you're young people forgive you so much i mean the world
S0588	mm
S0613	i'm not sure about your parent would say
S0588	yeah
S0613	but the world do
S0588	mm
S0613	erm they they you get lot of chance i think when you're young but once you get to a certain age
S0588	yeah after a certain point it's true
S0613	people don't
S0588	it's a real struggle yeah that's yeah
S0613	and when you stop look young as well
S0613	i no i've really er
S0588	mm
S0613	notice people react to you differently
S0588	well i know that as soon as i wasn't sort of drop dead gorgeous any more i be still alright but you know not that sort of immediacy thing
S0613	yeah
S0588	and i lose all my power it's
S0613	yeah it's the energy of youth isn't it
S0588	yeah
S0613	it just kind of have this glow about it
S0588	but i didn't have to do anything you just sit there be pretty and that's your career
S0613	yeah
S0588	that's all you have to do you don't have to say anything and you don't have to have a personality you don't have to it's enough and then when you do have to have a personality and actually learn something and get things right my goodness what a shock
S0613	i know the trouble be you don't realise at the time that that's what
S0588	no
S0613	cos cos i just think
S0588	cos everyone's kind of tiptoe around you and let you pass cos
S0613	yeah
S0588	and
S0613	but i kind of think i be just you know lucky with get job and stuff
S0588	mm
S0613	and then i look back and i think actually it's probably
S0588	because you be pretty
S0613	that my look have something to do with it yeah
S0588	yeah
S0613	okay i could probably
S0588	yeah
S0613	just about do the job otherwise i probably wouldn't have get it but i'm sure
S0588	mm
S0613	the way i look have a lot to do with and
S0588	mm
S0613	and suddenly it's like well i haven't get that any more so
S0588	no i know it's
S0613	so so it's er yeah
S0588	but that yes well i i er i have a very early experience of that because the sort of immediacy of the sort of lolita phase kind of pass and that be quite shock you know
S0613	mm
S0588	but cos mm men just use to be like well i don't know
S0613	yeah
S0588	but everything be easy include with my parent as well because it be enough to just be pretty
S0613	yeah
S0588	i didn't have to do anything i be accept for that mm
S0613	and we don't we don't realise how much we all do it even if we've suffer it from that ourselves
S0588	mm
S0613	you react to that be get some kind of like attraction
S0588	mm
S0613	physical attraction to it in whatever way whether it's a dog or a cat or
S0588	yes
S0613	you know
S0588	it's very fickle isn't it
S0613	you don't it's really much harder to er love an ugly cat
S0588	mm
S0613	than it be a pretty cat isn't it
S0588	it's really unfair isn't it
S0613	yeah i mean how many of us have as pet really ugly creatures
S0588	mm yeah we love the pretty ones don't we
S0613	yeah
S0588	yeah
S0613	and we
S0588	seem to be deeply unfair i
S0613	yeah and it be i it's like true your children you you kind of you do see a beauty that no one else see cos they're your children
S0588	but on the other hand
S0613	but
S0588	when you're all with your contemporaries when you're young er it's just another set of it's all relative so i i'll look at young people now and i think oh so beautiful but actually probably when i be younger i wouldn't think they be
S0613	no
S0588	no
S0613	no no
S0613	you you don't you don't you don't understand the erm the kind of the
S0588	the pure
S0613	magnetic force
S0588	no
S0613	of just just youth yeah
S0588	so
S0613	yeah and so other young people don't
S0588	mm
S0613	recognise that it's only
S0588	yeah
S0613	when you get older that you go
S0588	yeah
S0613	wow
S0588	yeah
S0613	look at that it's just because
S0588	mm
S0613	mainly cos they're young
S0588	yeah
S0613	you know and it's er
S0588	it's like a power
S0613	yeah oscar wilde be right when he say youth be waste on the young
S0588	it be so waste mm goodness waste but i remember at sixteen i i have this attitude that it be too late to do most things and that be really weird
S0588	cos i think god sixteen
S0613	yes i'm ancient
S0588	and i do remember the mummy say that a lot of time she use to say oh i think it's too late now for you to learn blah blah blah
S0588	if i it be either piano or you know dance or whatever it happen to be you could just fill in the thing and it be sort of she do have this sort of oh too late thing i really take that on
S0613	oh well yeah she
S0588	gosh
S0613	she's she's a quitter though isn't she she kind of like doesn't
S0588	yeah
S0613	anything that seem like too much trouble
S0613	it be kind of
S0588	yeah
S0613	oh that that will take far too much much energy and effort so let's not not bother with that
S0588	oh god mm
S0613	but the yeah the irony be if she'd say yes of course give it a try you might have decide well that's not for me anyway but you would have try and you would have go
S0588	mm
S0613	you know
S0588	yeah but i
S0613	or you might not but but you'd have
S0588	i can't keep blame though i do still blame them at some point i'll have to stop blame them but er yeah
S0613	yeah
S0588	they come right in the end well do they don't know they lend me the money for this house that be good i'm very grateful for that
S0613	they give you the money didn't they
S0588	they give me it yeah it's sort of yeah it be give yeah it's give isn't it i just say lend but it's give will in advance
S0613	and you you've do well out of that
S0588	i know
S0613	because there won't be any money leave so you've you've you've kind of er you strike at the right time really
S0588	yeah but i know
S0613	yeah
S0588	yeah
S0613	no yeah we be have a conversation about them cos the the their their flat isn't sell
S0588	what's be it not sell do people don't want it or
S0613	they've have very few view no nobody's make any offer
S0588	but why be it just
S0613	well we don't know
S0588	not the time
S0613	you see we be erm
S0588	it's a nice flat
S0613	be try to ask and why why if they have any theories as to why it be and and they didn't really but then be very kind of
S0588	away with with
S0613	yeah
S0588	mm
S0613	so erm we kind of talk about and we think maybe try put it on with two agents and
S0588	yeah
S0613	thing cos none of us be down there so it's quite hard and and and doesn't really do anything so do offer to sort of follow things up so we say well could we put it on with another agent and could you ask the first agents why we've have so few view so evidently hardly anyone's see it so if no one's see it i suppose
S0588	it be on rightmove and stuff
S0613	oh yeah yeah
S0588	that's weird
S0613	so erm and the other thing we think we'd do be we'd get cos we all end up erm after the party go go back there it be the twins' suggestion actually cos we be say
S0588	mm
S0613	let's just have a look at it and we all go back there and we we clear a lot of stuff actually
S0588	mm it might look a bite sad actually
S0613	well
S0588	look sad
S0613	erm we it have a lot of personal stuff in which
S0588	yes
S0613	i think be put people off so
S0588	yeah
S0613	we we get rid of a lot a lot and erm be gonna take a lot of stuff down to the charity shop and so we sort a lot of stuff out and erm we decide we be gonna get the carpet clean cos some of them be a bite
S0588	mm
S0613	look a bite grubby and we weren't sure about the picture cos they make it look very personal so maybe it's hardly for to imagine themselves in there
S0588	mm
S0613	and we keep couldn't make up our mind whether it be better with or without the picture but the latest thing we're think be take all the picture down get the wall repair so they haven't get empty hook and just
S0588	yeah
S0613	give it a coat of paint just to
S0588	that really work wonder
S0613	so it's a bite of a neutral space not take all the furniture out
S0588	yeah it's
S0613	but just make it
S0588	so off put when something's get
S0613	yeah
S0588	a kind of a personality that's
S0613	yeah
S0588	a little bite sad as well that's really it's slightly spooky so it's off put
S0613	yeah yes there be a lot of personal things i mean the and things just be leave er and one of the twin find
S0588	oh god
S0613	biscuits moulder in a biscuit tin you know the i mean there so it's
S0588	mm
S0613	kind of
S0588	yeah
S0613	and we go through the wardrobe and erm sort out the clothe ones that she might want at the care home and ones that definitely
S0588	mm
S0613	you know kind of have have it erm and old underwear and stuff and it's kind of like no wonder if someone open and wardrobe and they kind you know it's not
S0588	well it would have a reek of of sort of not a physical smell but it kind of would
S0613	you wouldn't help wonder have the person die who live here
S0588	well it's a thick atmosphere
S0613	yeah
S0588	to walk through and
S0613	yeah
S0588	yeah and it probably just need clear and and like you obviously
S0613	yeah but erm
S0588	erm but i mean a good whitewash yeah a neutral space just make and some flower and make presentable and stuff
S0613	yeah so so we've ask if she can get a quote for get the carpet clean and and for have the wall paint
S0588	mm
S0613	but erm it's a bite odd actually cos she offer to do that and i've i've i sort of email on behalf of everyone else and then i say oh i'll give you a call cos i think i'd rather than just by email just give her a call and check that that's okay erm and i can't get through there's be no answer of on their home number so i hope everything's alright
S0588	mm when do you call
S0613	er last night and i try again today i've leave message on her voicemail i don't think i've get her mobile
S0588	mm
S0613	but erm and i've email so i can't really do much more but
S0588	yeah that need to be can't one of us whitewash the wall
S0613	well i mean 's
S0588	i'm not a great painter but
S0613	's original suggestion be er oh would like to do it and and you know obviously it be to come out of the
S0588	well i mean and me could probably help with that as well
S0613	oh god if you could it would be brilliant actually
S0588	i'll ask and see what he think about it i can't speak for him but i will ask
S0613	i mean and if you don't actually want to do it just organise somebody cos ideally it need somebody there to check that it's do properly do you know what i mean
S0588	but we could do it ourselves couldn't we if it's just i mean i don't wanna say anything cos i'm probably crap at er diy and stuff but if it's just paint
S0613	well it would be the the hook the picture hook will need
S0588	just need fill
S0613	fill in
S0588	yeah
S0613	so the wall be make good
S0588	can do that
S0613	and then
S0588	know how to do that
S0613	we just think a a coat of paint cos it'll look a bite you know then wall get a bite grubby when you take the picture off
S0588	just whitewash paint cheap paint yeah
S0613	and then get get carpet cleaners in to clean all the
S0588	yeah
S0613	carpet erm
S0588	well i i'll have a word with cos i don't mind do my bite make me feel a bite better if i do my bite so er if it's something practical like that then
S0613	cos we be we be try to work out
S0588	we'd have to sleep in there probably
S0613	well that's it you see it need somebody who's get a few days free to go down there and do it all
S0588	yeah it would have to be organise wouldn't it
S0613	erm and like
S0588	but if it's gonna help get the thing shift cos
S0613	yeah
S0588	it's a terrible thing to be hang around
S0613	also we we be we be try to work out how much money she's get leave we reckon she's probably get about another year's worth of money leave
S0588	yeah
S0613	before she's gonna run out of her money
S0588	yeah well i don't know what happen when when that happen when she run out of money
S0613	well evidently once you've use all your money up the council will pay a certain amount towards it but because that that place be so expensive
S0588	yeah
S0613	what the council will pay will not cover it
S0588	no of course not
S0613	so either someone have to make the shortfall up or she have to move to a cheaper place
S0588	oh
S0613	and a move would just be a er that would kill her
S0588	and also she's use to live like a queen it would absolutely kill her
S0613	yeah so er
S0588	no and
S0613	and also she actually be very happy there now you can tell
S0589	hi
S0588	oh yeah
S0613	hello
S0588	yeah i'm sure
S0613	she's get her routine and she didn't cough once the entire party
S0588	no yeah
S0613	apart from when she blow the candle out which anyone would cough if they do that
S0588	yeah
S0613	but you know all this kind of oh i've get this awful cough you know she's she just didn't
S0588	no she's she's well gotta get rid of the flat no it just need like this place be just whitewash
S0613	mm
S0588	and it's just neutral so you can see
S0613	yeah
S0589	oh
S0588	you can see
S0613	yeah
S0588	i mean even on rightmove if it's kind of get personal artefacts
S0589	hello
S0613	yeah
S0588	and things that's so off put
S0613	hello
S0588	hello
S0589	i get boshed on the stairway
S0613	what from the cat
S0588	yes
S0589	he like boshing you through the
S0613	oh
S0588	i like to think of it as
S0589	bannisters
S0588	a bless
S0613	so he take a swipe at you as you come up the stairs
S0588	he go bosh
S0589	a little bosh
S0588	yeah
S0589	well he want some food oh 's have his supper
S0588	and actually just need to be clear of all the stuff really
S0613	well
S0588	beforehand
S0613	what what what we've do be we take all the stuff that we we know be of value and that we wouldn't want to be lose and we put you know that that like coat cupboard
S0588	right
S0613	yeah
S0588	yeah
S0613	all all the stuff that definitely
S0588	yeah
S0613	mustn't be give away or whatever have all go in there
S0588	yeah
S0613	erm and then there be a whole load of stuff in the spare bedroom which be for the charity shop which say she'd shift
S0588	okay
S0613	erm and then we've leave the the furniture in there at the moment cos we weren't we weren't sure whether it's better to take that out cos we could
S0588	no a little bite of furniture
S0613	get rid of the furniture
S0588	be good because even if it's not great furniture but actually no but you might be right the right sort of furniture be could be
S0613	yeah because then we discuss and think well if we're gonna do the wall cos you know they've get those kind of like reproduction victorian light fittings on the wall
S0588	i can't remember but anyway
S0613	oh but but they're really kind of like
S0588	yeah
S0613	and i just wonder if er if we change those for something slightly more contemporary erm
S0588	but then again the person who's gonna move in there
S0613	well exactly they might want it exactly so
S0588	be gonna be old for a start it could just be smartened up and spruce up
S0613	yeah
S0588	couldn't it
S0613	or it could be just that the agents aren't do a very good job of
S0588	but the first point of call be rightmove for most people and
S0613	well i think
S0588	if those photos look awful
S0613	i haven't see the photos
S0588	yeah we need to look at those
S0613	but say he have a look and he say
S0588	well we could even make get our own photos do and give them to the agencies
S0613	well that's what be say be say erm
S0588	make it look really lovely
S0613	cos evidently the first photo of the place outside have a whop great red truck park in front of it
S0588	well
S0613	so say to do you think you could ask to just change the picture cos it be
S0588	well i mean i'll come and take some great photos of it i've get a good camera well we've all get good cameras but
S0613	yeah
S0588	you know
S0613	well if you've get the time to do it
S0588	you just make
S0613	yeah
S0588	yeah it's just the time thing erm just
S0613	cos it need a block of time it's not something you can do in one day
S0588	it do need a block of time to sort of
S0613	you can just erm
S0588	whitewash it
S0613	i don't know if the carpet cleaner
S0588	do some good photos
S0613	when you'd need to bring in a company for that cos that's you need quite a bite machine for that don't you it's quite it's quite a a difficult job otherwise
S0588	yeah
S0613	and you need really need a car to transport it if you're gonna do it yourself cos i think you can hire them
S0588	yeah we can't do anything that involve a car but
S0613	no
S0588	but if it's just someone come over
S0613	but but because i mean the money could come out of ma's account so it's just a case of get some quote and find out somebody who's gonna do a good do a good job for the price and then you know make sure they're do what you want them to do and
S0588	mm
S0613	and then yeah make sure the place be look as good as it can
S0588	yeah it's easy to talk but i don't mind the prospect of just come and help out with fill in hole and do a bite of paint but i'd need so and i don't know if 's get
S0613	no cos it's it's difficult if you're
S0588	time so
S0613	if you're work full time i mean it's i mean that's the and also a lot of us aren't base down there
S0588	no
S0613	so it's that's the problem because then you spend a lot of time you've get to travel down there and then you've get to stay down there and then
S0588	well you it probably take about a week it think probably about a week's worth of
S0613	yeah but erm it's cos
S0588	but that sound very doable though all that
S0613	well it should yeah
S0588	yeah
S0613	erm in theory
S0588	and erm just no clutter and clutter's the off put thing just er cos this place just have the odd table yeah the odd bite of furniture
S0613	mm
S0588	and it be all whitewash and it look really good
S0613	yeah
S0588	but it be nothing special but it do look really good
S0613	but you can imagine what
S0588	cos it be neutralise
S0613	you might be able to do with it yeah
S0588	yeah
S0613	yeah cos i remember when we go to see that flat and there be no furniture in it and it seem quite spacious
S0588	yeah
S0613	i remember walk around it
S0588	well maybe
S0613	and er
S0588	maybe take the furniture out i just think the odd bite of furniture be good er a nice who's your customer you have to think er about who the customer be
S0613	yeah i mean it's go obviously go to be retire
S0588	you can't do like modernist
S0613	yeah you have to be over fifty five to erm to live there
S0588	yeah
S0613	so it's like
S0588	sort of like really
S0613	oh we we can do it we could go and live there
S0588	i be think you could do a you could do a really get it really wrong and do a sort of modern
S0613	yeah
S0588	kind of
S0613	well when they first move in i kind of think particularly cos where they've get the din table and it all the crumb be drop on the carpet and everything
S0588	mm
S0613	and i think it would be really nice to put a parquet floor down
S0588	yeah
S0613	that but evidently you're not allow to though cos of the noise it have to be
S0588	right
S0613	carpet but erm which be a shame but you could as erm you can put that erm what's it call sisal carpet it's it's like a coconut mat kind of
S0588	okay be that
S0613	so if your
S0588	like erm what's that call it's like a almost like er something you'd wipe your feet on
S0613	yes
S0588	but there's it's nice i really like those
S0613	yeah it's it's yeah you you've get a sort of pattern it's like ridge
S0588	yeah
S0613	but it's very neutral colour it's the next best thing if you can't have floorboards
S0588	mm
S0613	it's kid of the next best thing
S0588	yeah
S0613	cos then you could put rugs on top if you want but it's so
S0588	it's probably not it's just a matter of
S0613	but then that's us perhaps an old
S0588	neutralise thing
S0613	older person
S0588	and some it would show off the paint nicely or the picture nicely if they have we could maybe change a few picture and choose something
S0613	yeah well i mean we be we we rethink yeah just take all rather than have have any picture up just take them all down
S0588	yeah
S0613	and just have
S0588	mirror be good
S0613	yes cos they reflect the light
S0588	yeah
S0613	and
S0588	i remember this place have a lot of mirror in it er
S0613	so someone be quite skilful then erm market this place
S0588	yeah definitely cos there be nothing to get offend by and in fact we could just move i straight away and not be offend really
S0613	right
S0588	there be nothing that need change
S0613	mm
S0588	so we could still be
S0613	apart from the toilet
S0588	yeah
S0588	but we could still be live in it how it be
S0613	yes yeah
S0588	and it would still be okay
S0613	yeah
S0588	be livable in so i think that's the key if you if you think there's load to change
S0613	mm
S0588	then yeah er leave that with me and i'll see it would be
S0613	well
S0588	i'd have to approach it like erm i'll have to talk to about it and see if it's cos i i need a man there to do it with i couldn't
S0613	well you just need someone that to it's quite hard to yeah
S0588	well i don't i can't do the paint on my own i'm not great with diy so
S0613	but also how would you transport stuff though paint and ladder and dust sheet and
S0588	well that's the other thing i don't know
S0613	yeah but maybe you see 's obviously get a car
S0588	yeah
S0613	maybe when when answer the email or phone me cos i give her my number i say look you can ring erm shall i just reply and say well when you've have a chance to think about it
S0588	let me have a little think
S0613	yeah but i could i could if you do want to i could say
S0588	mm
S0613	erm oh and er can give a hand and then i could
S0588	mm
S0613	you two can can confer that way rather than
S0588	possibly
S0613	yeah
S0588	do you fancy whitewash the house in the flat in
S0589	do it need it
S0588	yeah apparently well it's not sell so we need to make it look neutralise and nice it's
S0613	the carpet need clean as well they're very grubby
S0588	and take some better photograph of it so that they can sell it and so that my mum's
S0589	i wonder could ditch the furniture
S0588	but i i think cos there's hole in the wall where the paint be and stuff like that so
S0613	i mean it might be your your your time's better spend supervise somebody else to do it
S0588	mm yeah yeah
S0613	because get people around to do the quote that could all be do from here
S0588	mm
S0613	and then just be there on the day when people come
S0588	yeah that's not a problem
S0613	erm
S0588	sit down the stairs with a cup of tea and stuff and go out and then come back again and things
S0613	yeah just be there to let people in and tell them what's basically what need do and
S0588	yeah no that's absolutely no problem at all we could do that i could do that i'm sure would be okay do that
S0613	and it's the same with the carpet clean just sort of
S0588	yeah
S0613	get someone in to say you know
S0588	would you be okay do that just there to supervise things cos we could go round as well while we're there
S0589	whatever you want me to do
S0588	he's an angel whatever you but then we could maybe then yeah well okay you can start with that then just but i don't know when yet and then would have to organise holiday so it's the logistics of it isn't it okay look maybe if i if we decide on a date say a week and then so then whoever it be who get the people to come and do the job know it have to be in that week
S0613	cos that's that's that's that's one of the things that need do you see which i think be offer to do but i don't know
S0588	oh yeah
S0613	but but someone need to er get people in to give quote
S0588	yeah
S0613	that's one of the things that need do
S0588	oh so that's another thing so
S0613	well that's the first thing that need to happen
S0588	so they need to come over for that
S0613	yeah
S0588	you're say so that's two trip
S0613	well that yes so possibly it might just be worth you then if you liaise with with because if if if can get people in to give quote and if she find people to do it
S0588	mm
S0613	then somebody obviously will need to be around to check the work and and then then rearrange
S0588	no cos i i be think in term of be there for the work
S0613	yeah
S0588	yeah
S0613	and so be there to let them in and
S0588	and can
S0613	do all the the rest but erm well yeah why don't i i why don't i just erm cc you in on the email and then you can step in if you want to or
S0588	yeah okay
S0613	or whatever erm yeah it's one of those things unless you're actually there it's quite difficult i mean you can do a certain amount from a long distance but
S0588	mm
S0613	mm cos originally i i be gonna try and
