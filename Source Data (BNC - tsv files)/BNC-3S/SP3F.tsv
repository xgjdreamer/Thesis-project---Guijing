S0513	yeah that's what we have
S0511	and be you warn
S0511	do you have two minutes or one minute it use to be one you know until princess diana die weird that's why it change to two cos i think it be felt you have to do even more for princess diana than we would normally and and then you can't really go backwards cos that'd just be really rude obviously compare one dumb princess to like zillions of dead people
S0512	mm
S0511	and what about at your school darling
S0512	normally
S0511	mm
S0512	erm we have it cos it's at eleven o'clock we have it before break so you all go onto the playground but they've

S0512	yes
S0511	okay
S0512	and it be two minutes and twenty second
S0511	on your watch
S0512	because be too busy reflect to count the time
S0511	well you cos you can't look at your watch can you i mean that's the thing two minutes be a long time do you have a good think
S0511	what do you think about
S0513	i think it be bloody stupid
S0511	you think it be bloody stupid that's nice to know that you're reflect on you know such things
S0513	happen age ago
S0511	happen age ago what so therefore it's no longer relevant
S0513	essentially and it get me really annoy because people say oh we've if we hadn't win the war then we wouldn't be here today
S0511	yeah which be annoy
S0512	that be very irritate
S0511	and i also find the language use i be just look at the bbc news headline people remember the fall like all this ridiculous language the fall you know and why don't you what be you talk about people who die in the war yeah i find that but you know actually i do i do er at the weekend in my french weekend this weekend there be a woman there who have do lot of conflict resolution peace build stuff in war tear areas of the world
S0512	mm
S0511	and she want to set up a to try and scale some of the stuff and i be talk to her about how can it be that human be we're quite clever at stuff and we do know things about how to tell resolve conflict or resolve dispute and yet we're so busy build fuck phone that we're not do this stuff and it's just absurd that we're not more further advance
S0511	but she tell me an interest thing which i've never think about that erm in many many many conflict in the world you cannot bring the two side together and that's true you know in as well
S0513	religion's fault
S0511	sorry darling
S0513	that's religion's fault
S0511	that's religion's fault well yeah for whatever reason erm but you see the principles of most conflict resolutions and the first thing you do be get both side in the room so if you can't do that then you're kind of bugger before you start she explain and so therefore you have to have ways where you can solve a conflict by only work with one side and that's a lot of the work that she's do in various which be when i use to say to you we you can't argue if you stop argue back then the other one can't argue it's it's the same
S0513	we have a fun last lesson today because we watch football on the field
S0511	you watch football
S0513	well we be in one of the top classrooms but we could see we be play on the field

S0513	will you stop pretend to be a psychologist
S0511	i'm not pretend to be a psychologist i'm i'm reflect back at you how
S0512	i think you be gonna say
S0511	whenever anybody suggest anything your immediate response be no
