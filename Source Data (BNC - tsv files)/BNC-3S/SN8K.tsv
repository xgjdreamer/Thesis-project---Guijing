S0317	i saw your picture that you put on the other day on the er the the snow and everything i didn't know
S0255	mm
S0317	cos i have to look twice cos i didn't know if you be out there and i think
S0255	no
S0317	i'm sure she's not cos we've just speak to her
S0255	yeah no no i wasn't out there i just erm somebody put it on facebook say it be snow in and i be like er so i just think i'd share the share the picture so everybody that's a a skier go oh it's snow it's snow i mean it's not obviously enough to ski on at the minute but start now that's fairly good
S0317	ah
S0255	and they're say it's gonna be a really cold winter here so hopefully it will be over there as well
S0317	oh
S0255	and then we'll get out there mind you i won't be able to ski i don't think for a while
S0317	well i be gonna say you're not gonna be able to be you
S0255	no no that's the thing cos they put it back three weeks that add three weeks on the recovery so when i go out it'll it'll be six weeks after the op so
S0317	right
S0255	i might be able to potter that's my plan if i can just to see
S0317	just be careful
S0255	yeah oh yeah i'm i'm not gonna go mad
S0317	yeah
S0255	but
S0317	be it the apr√®s ski isn't that what they call it the bar
S0255	yeah yeah i'll probably do a lot of that mm yeah because the kid be come out erm at christmas with us erm 's gonna be out there i'm then go out eighteenth of january with no eighteenth of december with
S0317	uhu
S0255	and then 's come out on the twenty third i think she's out for five days then she's go back and 's go back with her and we're stay out for new year
S0317	oh lovely
S0255	so yeah mm
S0317	be nice
S0255	mm yeah i mean even if i don't get to ski i'm quite happy tuck up with a book and just read a beer
S0317	ah it'll be lovely
S0255	yeah it'll be fine
S0318	this be in the place you buy isn't it
S0255	yeah yeah that's it go out in the summer and put a new kitchen in
S0317	ah
S0255	so that's good cos there be only a couple of cupboards and this sort of big surface thing to work on and that be about it so we go into wicks and say we've get a very little space for a very little kitchen you know as in there's only a couple of and we we work it all out we manage to get quite a lot in and do tall erm cupboards the top one's go right to ceiling
S0317	mm yeah
S0255	but so just go round the corner
S0318	mm
S0255	so there's gonna be a lot more space so that's good it'll be good
S0318	that's the problem with ours isn't it
S0255	mm
S0318	we haven't get enough space we need
S0317	more cupboards
S0318	we be persuade against have additional work space weren't we
S0317	cupboards
S0318	by the designer
S0317	cupboards
S0255	yeah
S0318	well cupboards
S0255	yeah
S0318	er cos he say oh no you want it you want it all you know clean line and all that stuff
S0255	yeah
S0318	but it wasn't very practical in the end we be oh okay then cos we want to have a cupboard you know where the the fridge be
S0255	mm
S0318	on the other side and erm we end up not have it and we
S0317	regret it
S0318	regret it
S0255	yeah
S0318	cos
S0317	it's a huge kitchen and we can't really store anything
S0255	yeah well that's it
S0317	drive me mad
S0255	yeah i mean our place er the you know the bungalow we've get no storage anywhere because we knock out where it be storage as part of the old bungalow and make it into part of a room which carry on back with all the other room then
S0317	yeah
S0255	so we've get no cupboards we've get obviously not get an under the stairs cupboard or anything like that
S0317	mm
S0255	and you find it's the things like where do you put your mop and bucket and where do you put your hoover and there use to be a big cupboard in the bathroom in 's bathroom and we use to put everything in there like an air cupboard and then when we have that take out and make it into a wet room so there's still a bath there but she's get the shower
S0317	mm oh right
S0255	that that be the cupboard basically so that's where the the shower be now and all of a sudden where do we put the hoover where do you put the mop where do you put this where do you put
S0317	mm
S0255	and even down to the sheet for your bed and the towel cos they be all in there so you've suddenly get to find room for everything
S0317	yeah you'll have to have an extension
S0255	yeah we try that well we didn't try it since then but yeah whatever they just they weren't very very please with the idea of us build
S0317	extend further
S0255	no not extend at all really we have to really fight to get what we get we want we want
S0317	cos it's not like it impact on anybody else cos you don't look over anyone
S0255	no no
S0317	and you're low and
S0255	well they say it would it because it be the same look it look the same as the bungalow next to it or the two bungalows next to it
S0317	yeah
S0255	then we couldn't change the look of it and we say but we're next to a house
S0317	but you're go backwards
S0255	yeah but we're next to a house and if you look all up and down the whole street
S0317	they're all different anyway
S0255	it's there's chalet bungalows
S0317	yeah
S0255	there's semi detach there's terrace house there's detach there's everything all mix up on that top road
S0317	oh there be
S0255	erm and we actually want to go up as well not into necessarily a house but up into the roof but actually make it higher
S0317	yeah
S0255	so we have the top floor would have be and i my like bedroom
S0317	yeah
S0255	erm en suite and a dress room sort of idea and then come across and then have the other side as all walk in loft space
S0317	yeah
S0255	so we want to do all that and they wouldn't let us and
S0317	oh
S0255	we want to do things with dormer windows and they wouldn't let us because nobody else have them and we find out load of people have put in for them but they'd all get tell no cos nobody else be have have them
S0317	oh
S0255	it's like if you'd let us all have them everybody will have one
S0317	yeah
S0255	and then they'll all match so no we have a lot of trouble
S0318	funny thing this plan innit
S0255	mm
S0317	you're definitely at the mercy of them
S0255	mm do you have problems when you be do the conservatory
S0317	no cos we didn't ask for it
S0255	didn't you
S0317	we didn't need well we be tell we didn't need it
S0255	mm yeah
S0317	because it's to do with the square meterage of floor space
S0255	yeah
S0317	and it not be a permanent build
S0318	and there be already one there wasn't there
S0317	and there be one there already yeah
S0255	oh right yeah so you be sort of replace something that be already there
S0317	yeah it be a tad bigger but
S0255	yeah
S0317	only by a couple of feet wasn't it really
S0255	yeah i remember we we hadn't put in for plan permission and the guy start build it cos ours be go right across the back doesn't it if you remember
S0317	yeah
S0255	we put in but then somebody be er say actually you know you ought to put in cos if they find out and you er okay yeah we'll put in if we do need to so we put in for plan permission and then the woman come round to look at the garden look at the area and i'm think this be half build do you know what i mean and we're still put in for plan permission so i be say ah yes erm and she say i'll meet you round the back and she start walk round the bungalow i'm go through the house think what do i do what do i do and i can't ring cos there's nothing he can do he's away and er er er
S0317	mm
S0318	mm
S0255	and i go out the back she go oh i see you start build it and i say yes oh do they tell you you didn't need plan permission at first i go yes she go mm and then somebody say maybe you do i be like yes yeah yeah but she she be very adamant no more nothing else no more build and
S0317	mm
S0255	that's that so yeah
S0317	mm
S0255	now i mean it's plenty big enough for us now it's just that they make us go in in the middle bite so you've get the bungalow and then it go in a bite where the din room and back door be
S0317	yeah
S0255	and then it go back out again and they say that be because you could see it from the road whereas if it go in i think that be again we be just like what you know so yeah again where we would have maybe put a big cupboard or something
S0317	yeah
S0255	we couldn't
S0318	oh dear so maybe we should have ask for plan permission
S0255	i don't know
S0317	i don't know as i say it be there before wasn't there so
S0255	things be yeah things be probably change i i don't know what
S0318	plan permission
S0317	well we buy the house and it be survey and everything things like that get pick up at that point don't they
S0255	yeah that's right yeah cos it'll be on the deeds and what you can and can't have
S0317	yeah
S0255	so yeah they would've notice it
S0317	okay so wouldn't have let us have it without she say with cross finger
S0255	mm mm
S0318	oh well we're not move be we
S0317	it's up now it's too late no we're not move so
S0255	i think they've relax quite a lot now on what they'll allow for plan and be different
S0318	didn't they say that they be allow more for that sort of thing because
S0255	i think yeah yeah we hear something like that
S0318	because of the issue of people not be and house and all the rest of it
S0317	yeah yeah
S0255	yeah yeah yeah like you be you here
S0317	no
S0255	you're as well be you
S0317	we're yeah
S0255	right okay yeah cos where do it
S0317	it's it's the other side of the erm the road isn't it it start
S0255	oh be it i don't know
S0317	yeah it start the other side of the road
S0255	oh okay
S0317	that's
S0255	mm cos they're different again to what would let you have
S0317	mm yeah
S0318	next door's get that they've get a conservatory in the one over the way haven't they after sorry i'm point the wrong way
S0317	i be gonna say which way be you go that way yes they have yeah
S0318	they've get a conservatory
S0317	yeah
S0255	mm
S0318	and nobody's moan about it
S0317	well we don't really interfere with anybody do we cos it's this side of the the only person would be and we're
S0318	well it's not cos the flat roof

S0255	mm yeah
S0318	and but you think like you be see them and you know what they're do cos you see them on facebook
S0255	yeah
S0318	so it's like you you might not have speak to them for a for years but it doesn't feel like it you feel like you've speak to them

S0318	yeah
S0255	every week or so they put something on they're do this go there
S0317	mm
S0255	so you actually get and get to see like they're have their grandkids and

S0255	you know and then
S0318	yeah
S0255	have a big catch up or you'd ring people

S0255	i use to do that when i first move to erm cos obviously i move away from everybody and i use to do that each week about on one night i'd ring somebody or you know somebody or somebody and just you know have an hour on the phone
S0317	yeah
S0255	erm and just have a really good catch up you don't do that anymore
S0317	no
S0255	you always think you tend to think oh i'll send a text rather than ring somebody you send a text and then you get an answer back at some point and
S0317	mm
S0255	it's the personal connection that's go isn't it
S0317	mm when we first get to move in and we move to it be the phone box at the end of the road
S0255	mm
S0317	in those days i'm go down to ring mum

S0255	yeah particularly as it's light up and you're stand there
S0318	i use to come down and stand outside

S0318	yeah there be a thing i read on this be on linkedin again erm it say five things not to put on your r√©sum√©
S0255	right
S0318	cos obviously it be american
S0255	yeah
S0318	and the first thing be you don't put your erm don't put your address
S0255	mm
S0318	on your r√©sum√©
S0255	mm
S0318	it's not necessary
S0255	yeah
S0318	and also they will economically profile you so like they'll work out where you live
S0317	they'll see where you live
S0318	and see so whether they want that sort of person who live in a neighbourhood like that they don't want
S0318	erm the next thing be you don't put erm email address you need to don't use a cable provider's email address
S0255	mm
S0318	because that's a sign that you're really old
S0255	oh right
S0318	so if you've get an aol dot com
S0255	yeah
S0318	it be say or or any other cable provider serve like bt
S0317	bt
S0318	yeah right so i'm think so yeah i put my address on there i put my email and then the other one be oh and the other reason for the address be they can work out how far away you be from
S0317	mm mm
S0255	yeah
S0318	the place and then rule you out from a commute point of view
S0255	mm mm
S0318	erm the email address oh the double the double the double space after a period or what well that mean a full stop
S0255	yeah
S0317	oh right
S0318	cos they don't
S0317	don't put them in
S0318	don't put them in because that's something that we have a big row about this at work the other day yeah
S0317	i think you be suppose to
S0318	yes so i i'm sit there so so come up to me and some of the researchers be say there's a big issue here with where be you know do you put two space after a full stop and i go yes you do well that's not what do and er and then we be all look at all these different report and some people do and some people don't
S0255	yeah mm
S0318	and erm i look up we've get an report standards document like this be how you should lay it out
S0255	yeah
S0317	yeah how you do it yeah
S0255	mm
S0318	and in there it's a bloody single space innit right
S0255	yeah
S0318	it's all single space ah i don't so i look it up on i google it
S0255	mm
S0318	and i look it up and it say that's the english space
S0255	mm
S0318	and it's the french space there's actually all different term for all these different style
S0317	oh
S0318	and apparently it's it's to do with type on a typewriter
S0255	yeah
S0317	right
S0318	it's go out of fashion and now it's now the accept standard be one space
S0317	ah
S0255	yeah
S0318	and by have two space after a full stop before you type your next letter
S0255	mm you show your age
S0318	you're show your age
S0255	yeah
S0318	or show that you be train to type on
S0255	see i be never type
S0318	on a typewriter
S0255	i've never do double space at all
S0317	i've only do it because just through the college course and stuff and them and them say this be how
S0318	yeah and it's something that they teach in universities
S0317	yeah in university how to do your
S0318	yeah in universities essay write
S0317	yeah
S0318	be apparently something they teach
S0317	double space yeah
S0255	mm
S0318	but it's not it's apparently go out of
S0317	mm
S0318	phase erm but that's that be double space
S0255	yea
S0318	so email double something i do double space
S0255	address email and double space
S0318	okay so that's three and then what be the other ones i can't remember what they be now erm there be five oh landline
S0255	oh don't put a landline
S0318	landline
S0255	yeah
S0318	that's what lead me to start it in the first place
S0255	yeah
S0318	yeah landline who have a landline anymore that's a definite sign you're old if you've get a landline
S0255	yeah
S0317	but like you say you have to have a landline now to have broadband
S0255	yeah but you don't expect people to phone you on it
S0317	er i suppose
S0318	and the other one be erm to do with your skillsets but i can't quite remember how that be but it be the way you write
S0255	mm
S0318	what your skills be but it's like you know you shouldn't be put these things on cos it
S0255	mm
S0318	you don't put your age on
S0317	no
S0255	no
S0318	but that it scream how old you be base on the fact that you've provide a cable provide email address so it say if you've get a cable one get it redirect to a gmail account use something like modern
S0317	but they can work out how old you be mm i've get hotmail do that count cos i always think hotmail be alright
S0255	yeah no hotmail yeah that's erm
S0317	be a no no
S0255	i don't yeah i think there's hotmail that be
S0318	yeah you see i i
S0255	sort of scam things isn't it and you get load of hotmail account and stuff but i think it's probably quite trendy
S0317	yeah touch wood i've not have any scam so
S0255	mm
S0318	have you hear of a guy call alan turing
S0317	yes
S0318	he's the guy that invent the computer
S0317	computer yeah
S0318	and there's a film about him
S0317	yeah
S0318	at the moment which be
S0317	just about to come out
S0318	star benedict cumberbatch and cos he be homosexual
S0317	mm he kill himself
S0318	and he kill he ah well this be the thing we be talk about this at work we be say do he actually
S0317	or be he knock off
S0318	he kill himself he kill himself by eat a pie an apple lace with cyanide right cos apparently he have a big thing about he have a big obsession around the whole snow white and the seven dwarf and the poison apple thing go on
S0255	mm
S0318	and when he be find he be find in bed and there be a half eat apple by the side of his bed
S0255	mm
S0318	and the but the apple be never test for cyanide but that's what he die of cos when they test his blood
S0255	and the half eat apple mean like a sudden death doesn't it cos you'd you'd finish it if you be
S0318	supposedly this be the story
S0255	yeah yeah
S0318	and i be sit there at work and then who who's at work go he say yeah that's why apple the apple logo be half eat apple and i go be that right he go yeah apparently that be the story be that the apple logo
S0255	mm
S0317	oh right yeah
S0318	which be a half eat apple be be a tribute
S0317	to him
S0318	to alan turing apple
S0255	oh right oh as in apple products not not
S0318	yeah you know the apple
S0255	i be i be just try to picture what the gala apple label be like or the pink lady apple think do they all have half eat apples on it
S0318	no no apple computers
S0255	oh right
S0318	apple computers
S0255	oh right
S0318	right so i go be that right and so i look it up so i look up alan turing and apparently he there be a he do die he be find
S0255	yeah yeah
S0318	in bed next to a half eat apple
S0255	yeah
S0318	so at the time there be this speculation that that's what happen but there's be a load of stuff since say suggest that actually he he probably didn't because there's all this thing about he be persecute and you know all the rest of it
S0255	oh mm
S0318	but apparently at the time he he the way he be with people he be kind of yeah whatever he wasn't bother about it
S0255	right
S0318	and he be remarkably cheerful in the two or three days before he be fine and then on the
S0255	yeah
S0318	the cos it be a bank holiday weekend he put in a list of everything he be go to do the follow week he leave it on his desk
S0255	mm
S0318	which be his habit to do
S0317	ah so be he bump off then
S0318	apparently he always er he always eat an apple before he go to bed
S0255	yeah yeah
S0318	and often he leave it half eat right
S0317	oh right
S0255	oh
S0318	when they examine the body it wasn't the impression be that it wasn't a sudden cyanide ingestion
S0255	mm
S0318	it be gradual and apparently he be a bugger for do experiment at home chemical experiment
S0317	oh right
S0318	and he be do plat and there be there be cyanide in in one of the room and they reckon it be actually
S0255	oh no yeah
S0318	he inhale it it be an accident
S0317	ah it be an accident
S0255	yeah
S0318	he didn't actually
S0255	mm
S0318	he didn't kill himself
S0317	i be go to say it's a conspiracy somebody actually in the secret service bump him off or something
S0318	no no they reckon
S0317	oh right
S0318	no no not not at all so there you go
S0317	do you find out whether the apple logo be because of that
S0318	well so then i look then they say about the apple logo as well in in the wikipedia thing

S0317	just remember you be not use to drink
S0255	no
S0317	so you can't drink a couple of bottle of wine and some load of vodka shots i say cos you could kill yourself
S0255	yeah well yeah that's right
S0317	cos your body be not use to it
S0255	or be in a situation you really don't want to be in because you can't you don't know what's happen and the next day you're think do something happen
S0317	yeah
S0255	you know yeah it's yeah
S0317	so you know i say you just need to be careful
S0255	yeah
S0317	you know to get to that level you have to kind of ease into it
S0255	yeah ease yourself in gently
S0317	yeah
S0255	this be how you do it
S0317	so but she hasn't but i think it it throw her enough that she's not really drink she's drink
S0255	yeah
S0317	but she's not drink enough and she didn't drink for nearly a week after that little episode
S0255	yeah i mean i i she put that on facebook i think cos somebody somebody buy her a drink of water didn't they and somebody somebody say
S0317	yeah
S0255	oh say thank you to i can't remember who to say thank you to i can't remember what he look like bless her
S0317	so i think it sort of spook her enough
S0255	yeah
S0317	that she's er she's not really i'm sure she she be drink but she's not drink to that point
S0255	i think yeah i think most kid at somewhere between fourteen and twenty four have that one time when they get so drink that they be so ill and that actually do make them stop and think it doesn't mean they're not gonna get drink doesn't mean they're not gonna get hangovers or be sick again or anything but they're actually just a little bite aware of you can't just throw it constantly down your throat cos actually your body's gonna go er no
S0317	i've have enough now
S0255	yeah have enough yeah
S0317	but yes
S0255	mm
S0317	but she she's home october
S0255	get half term
S0317	half term yeah they've get a read week there's only her course and another course out of the whole uni that have get the a read week
S0255	okay
S0317	and most of them the others who although although they've get read weeks they they're not allow to leave the uni
S0255	really
S0317	whereas she her course have be allow to leave
S0255	yeah
S0317	so she's come home
S0255	you would've think half term they would have let people go
S0317	well a lot of unis don't have half term
S0255	oh don't they
S0317	no it's not something
S0255	oh right oh they have longer christmas break and easter break then yeah
S0317	yeah she's she finish the twelfth eleventh twelfth
S0255	yeah
S0317	whatever it be eleventh i think it be

S0317	erm so she'll come home on the twelfth of december and then she doesn't go back until i think they've get like four weeks
S0255	yeah
S0317	something like that so
S0255	suppose it make sense cos people be come from all over so to be go backwards and forward for half term and this holiday that holiday it make sense to have a longer break

S0318	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0317	yeah
S0318	although i might be go back mightn't i
S0317	yeah but you're not gonna go back as a officer be you co thingymebobby be you
S0318	no
S0317	squadron officer that's what i be look for
S0255	yeah
S0317	don't go out
S0255	he say no i'm just sit look through the window
S0317	no he do that yeah
S0317	it's when it's rain i'll open the door and he'll look out of it
S0317	and he'll go i'm not go out and he'll go to a different door and it's like it's rain outside of that one as well as this one
S0255	oh that's funny so what might you be go back do
S0318	i dunno i i be talk to about it and i need the break
S0255	yeah
S0318	erm and but i've i don't want to give it up completely cos it's a fantastic organisation
S0255	yeah
S0318	and i do get a lot out of it
S0255	mm
S0318	erm i do miss it a bite er but i don't miss be in charge of the squadron so
S0255	yeah
S0318	i just email the guy who's in charge of of the area the wing and say i'm interest in come back i don't want to be a squadron co i've do that for five years thank
S0255	no yeah
S0318	do quite well i'd rather do something else so i can either come back and just be an a squadron officer er on the squadron
S0255	mm mm
S0318	but i've you know i don't want to be in charge so erm the but and there's a risk you know that because of my work i'm unlikely to be able to get very far away from
S0255	yeah
S0318	so that kind of i don't want to go back to one one five
S0255	no
S0318	but i say i could do you know but that restrict me really to fifty one which be the squadron
S0255	yeah
S0318	or at a push possibly
S0255	mm
S0318	five eleven which i know the lady that's run that one be we use to we use to be in one one five and i get on well with her so
S0255	mm
S0318	so that might be a possibility so i could go there i say or if you if you want me to do something at wing level which be like a a more of a staff post
S0255	mm
S0318	and it's more likely to be it's not you're not commit to the same even
S0255	yeah the time it yeah
S0318	and it's more likely to be weekend
S0255	cos you'd probably struggle with that yeah
S0318	than it be
S0255	yeah
S0318	even so
S0255	yeah
S0318	but i i email him leave a message and er he ring me last night and say do you want to meet up for a chat in london on next week
S0255	mm
S0318	so we're meet on wednesday
S0255	yeah
S0318	and we'll have a chat i'll see what he's get to say really
S0255	yeah
S0318	i i say that
S0317	you quite like the train role though wouldn't you
S0318	yeah i would cos there's there's a train team
S0317	mm
S0318	and do something with the train team would probably be good cos that's down at
S0317	yeah
S0318	which be where they're base now and so but that's not too far away
S0317	no
S0318	that's only about forty five minutes erm and at the weekend that wouldn't be a problem
S0255	mm that's it if you go and say the ideas of what you want to do i i think if you start do just go in as some sort of officer er to somewhere once a week i think cos you'd actually run one you'd either you'd be see how things be do you'd you'd be almost like step up without mean to because you're so use to do it
S0318	i think you're right
S0255	and you've get the once a week every single night you have to be back from
S0317	oh
S0318	have you be coach her
S0255	have say all this
S0317	i haven't i haven't say a word and i haven't say have this conversation with at all
S0255	no
S0318	well you're right you're right you're right i mean and that be the that be the worry and the i i sort of thing i'll be say be the concern be that if i go into a squadron
S0317	it's that expectation as well because he's be so
S0318	that expectation
S0317	you know the success he have before maybe
S0255	mm
S0318	i've be successful
S0317	look at you do it with them
S0318	yeah
S0255	yeah
S0318	they'll be think oh wow we've get and he you know be like erm
S0255	yeah
S0318	wing field champion and
S0255	yeah
S0318	this champion and that and it wasn't all down to me it be a team effort
S0255	yeah
S0318	erm and and i don't want that pressure you know
S0255	no and also
S0318	or or i'll go somewhere and they'll go oh he's arrive so you can take over now erm or
S0255	yeah
S0318	they'll be so so crap that it that i'll feel compel to do it
S0255	yeah
S0318	cos it's so shit
S0255	or you can have somebody sort of keep it all to themselves and not let you get involve as in no no no i'm run this and almost like
S0318	well yeah
S0255	yeah
S0318	i don't i yeah i i don't think that would happen so i'm not cos there
S0317	no
S0318	as i say there's a limit on the the squadrons i could do anyway i mean the other think be i could in theory go to a squadron that's local to where i'm work
S0317	right
S0318	but then
S0317	different wing though be it
S0318	no no it's
S0317	oh same wing be it
S0318	through cos you've get and and
S0317	yeah yeah
S0255	all those place round there so
S0255	if if you're do something once a week on a week night that mean you've get to be in a certain place by a certain time
S0317	mm
S0318	yeah
S0255	whether that's more local to here
S0318	and also that make you you have a long day then don't you cos you don't get any break at all which
S0317	yeah no
S0318	you know if i if i be do that i'd be go to work in the morning work all day and then
S0255	mm
S0318	stay late because it doesn't start till seven then go to where you would go er it'd be like on the way home let's say it be
S0255	mm yeah yeah
S0318	cos there's a squadron there or squadron
S0255	mm
S0318	which be near the airship shed at
S0255	mm
S0318	erm you know you go there and then you're not home till ten thirty eleven o'clock i'd only want to do that one night a week
S0317	mm
S0255	yeah
S0318	and then i'd i i kind of get the impression that i'd get bore i'd get feed up with that pretty quick
S0255	yeah
S0317	mm
S0318	and also if if that particular day like you say
S0317	mm
S0318	i've get to be in london i've get to go somewhere else with work
S0255	yeah
S0318	then i'm not do it at all so
S0255	no
S0318	how's that gonna work out so i the i i'm er i'm more attract to and i'm hop he want me to do something at a more senior level in
S0255	yeah
S0318	in the wing train team or so
S0317	yeah mm
S0255	well the thing be be if you go in and say the ideas of what you do and think and want to do and there's nothing actually at the minute it might be six months before something come up
S0318	yeah yeah
S0255	but rather than get stick into a squadron somewhere and be do something that actually you're gonna end up in a year or or time say i don't want to do this anymore cos it's just how it be before
S0318	yeah exactly yeah
S0255	yeah just wait you know you've get christmas and
S0318	well i've say i'm i've say it won't be until new year anyway
S0255	yeah
S0318	i don't want to come back now
S0255	no
S0318	so it'll be in the new year
S0255	cos you need to go and buy all 's christmas present and that's very time consume
S0317	it be
