S0013	mm
S0278	we all drink tap we both drink tap water now
S0013	so you're great go in a pub
S0278	cos all all of the alcohol's get sugar in it
S0013	go in a pub then you don't mind
S0278	well you have to buy something else you have to buy something to eat well i wouldn't go into a pub just to drink really i've i've she like to go the
S0012	which one
S0278	the the be a erm it's a family sort of erm restaurant
S0013	yeah
S0012	mm
S0278	do a really quite nice carvery erm and it's four pound i think four four pound fifty or something for a carvery
S0013	mm
S0278	which be fine cos we can sit there with a glass of water and have a carvery and she like go there and i quite like the one at but then they last time i go there all the vegetables be overcook
S0012	where
S0013	be that
S0278	no it's call erm well mind you if you go on a sunday it's six pound something but she have a small carvery and that's only three pound fifty or ninety nine
S0012	yeah
S0013	they've start do small portion now haven't they which be good
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	well it's unlimited both of them i think it's unlimited vegetables so what you can do be fill your plate right up and fill it up again with vegetables but don't ever go for the they have huge yorkshire puddings that fill your plate up
S0012	oh right
S0013	oh
S0013	yeah
S0278	and would you like yorkshire pudding and stuff stuffing's a great big bite that doesn't cost anything yorkshire pudding doesn't cost that's all there and if you say you know yes please you'd have stuff and yorkshire pudding and that's a third of your plate fill up
S0013	right
S0278	so that reduce what else you can put on a plate
S0012	of course it will yeah
S0013	oh
S0278	clever
S0013	mm
S0278	and it's and it's the stuffing's there and the yorkshire sorry the stuff be just a square of something i doubt there's much in that be there
S0012	that's just sage and onion just sage and onion
S0278	bread and stuff isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0013	ah yeah
S0278	i don't like it and erm but it's the yorkshire puddings that that's the one that erm fill the plate up
S0013	and potatoes
S0278	oh when we usually get you get more vegetables than you think of
S0012	yeah
S0278	but for for an even just to go where you don't have to think about any cook it's not that much to pay
S0013	mm no no not really
S0012	no
S0278	i don't have any pudding
S0012	no
S0278	cos that's how they make their money on the puddings
S0013	erm
S0012	we normally eat puddings when we're out
S0013	it's cheaper we don't hardly ever go out we do
S0012	you usually just have a starter

S0013	it didn't come out very well that's cos we
S0278	oh i couldn't i didn't have a chance to read that
S0013	mm yeah
S0278	but what these these people have put be still like that there's still a gap there
S0012	yeah
S0278	not be write on
S0013	yeah just little bits of write
S0278	well what what i shall remember be how friendly everybody be and how they all work together
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	we be all you know there be a whole crowd of you in that little kitchen and
S0012	yeah it's lovely isn't it
S0013	yes
S0278	and yet everybody erm just just get on you know and if you've get something in the sink you wash it up you know it's
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	it's brilliant
S0012	well that's how it be in all
S0012	yeah
S0013	the only thing that's funny in that place be the the reception it's like a little cupboard isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0278	oh i didn't go there
S0013	oh you probably didn't go
S0278	no well the thing be because because they be have such fun there with the people look after it they the place be open anyway and she say do come in it be her husband who be the official one i think
S0013	yeah
S0278	and she just follow him round and so erm he'd be back shortly and actually they didn't book us in until next day they give us a little slip and then
S0013	oh
S0278	she say well i'll show you where you're gonna be anyway and you can get yourselves all settle down
S0013	oh
S0012	crickey
S0278	that be fine
S0012	yeah yeah
S0278	plumb make an awful noise though when you turn the tap on in the dormitory clunk clunk clunk clunk
S0012	oh the clunk clunk clunk yep yeah
S0278	so how long ago be you there and no one sort it
S0012	er
S0278	cos you turn the tap on it turn how many years ago
S0013	when be we there erm about three years ago now
S0278	so for three years in the middle of the night if you turn the tap on you go to the loo turn the tap on clunk clunk clunk
S0012	yeah clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk
S0013	oh i can't remember that
S0278	and the ah i couldn't this yesterday morning about five o'clock what whose alarm's go off now and there be a beep beep beep beep okay and i could hear it when erm i have i now know that one of my ears isn't good i could hear it louder when i put one ear down then the other ear down on the pillow and and i think well if someone's get their alarm go off in their suitcase or in their in their bag and no one do it eventually and it go on and on and in the end i sleep through it a bite and i wake up and it be still go
S0013	oh gosh
S0278	then when i get downstairs it's the alarm panel that you put a key in
S0012	oh yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	that be beep
S0013	well
S0278	erm and so i now know that one of my ears isn't right because when one be face downwards towards towards it i could hear it and when the other turn around i couldn't hear it when the other my other ear be down
S0012	oh right
S0278	and i've come to the conclusion somebody have perhaps leave an alarm in the bed or something one of the bed that wasn't be use
S0012	yeah
S0278	only on the last night it do it
S0012	oh
S0013	mm
S0278	but it be show something be wrong with one area in the build or something
S0012	that's right yeah
S0012	we have we have to reset both of them and press one two three when it's do
S0013	mm
S0278	perhaps someone smoke in the room and they shouldn't have do or something i don't know
S0012	a lot of the problem be erm
S0013	not many people do that
S0012	no
S0013	you're not suppose to smoke most people i don't know anyone that's do that
S0012	a lot of the problem with that with that be people who use hairspray
S0278	oh be it yeah
S0012	and that will set the alarm off
S0278	mm
S0012	or set off you know it's hairspray
S0013	mm
S0278	mm
S0012	and we we have a we have a when we we be we work at in
S0013	antiperspirants
S0012	yeah antiperspirant and hairspray they say
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah and erm we have a do when we be we be just stay at the hostel eleven o'clock whoo whoo whoo the alarm go off
S0013	yeah we go to bed early
S0012	we go to bed early
S0013	well earlyish we think it be in the middle of the night
S0012	we have to get up and we be run out and everybody have to go run out and there be a poor girl come out the shower
S0013	yeah
S0012	just a towel round her
S0012	and we all to stand outside you know at a special fire point and er be it that we be too far away for the fire brigade
S0013	yeah this particular one er it be a hairpin bend just as you get up to the hostel
S0278	mm
S0013	absolutely awful
S0278	be that
S0013	yeah
S0012	oh
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah it's call something else now i think it's call
S0012	yeah you go up and you just with a car you have to take three go at get around the corner
S0278	get around the corner mm
S0012	so no fire engine could possibly get up there so if anything happen the woman wouldn't
S0013	there wasn't a warden or manager there
S0012	there wasn't a warden she be over
S0013	she live down the village
S0278	yeah
S0013	so we be all like no one know what to do apart from phone up like phone up this place and er she take about oh an hour three quarter of an hour
S0012	over and hour and a half
S0013	to get there
S0012	to get up there so the alarm could be turn off and what have you cos we weren't wardens then we be just stay there
S0013	mm
S0278	mm
S0012	and er she come up and turn the alarm off and we say well what happen if if it be a fire
S0013	it's a real one
S0012	well just let it burn down you see
S0013	isn't that awful
S0278	well if there's no alternative
S0013	i mean there's there's fire fire extinguishers obviously people would use them
S0012	mm
S0013	but there's no way no way a fire engine could get up there
S0012	and you would have think that the warden would have be stay at the place anyway
S0013	yeah
S0012	but she be at home
S0013	no that's that's the worst thing i that would be our worst nightmare to have a fire
S0012	oh yeah
S0013	because i don't really know how to use those extinguishers either
S0012	be it where you pull the pin out
S0013	well you do you do associate yeah you'd you would know but
S0278	it's simple it's not
S0012	yeah but they
S0278	spray it on the base of the fire
S0012	there's all sort of fire
S0278	people will aim it at the top of the fire it's like people water the top of plant and not the soil
S0012	that's right
S0013	mm
S0278	but you aim at the base of it
S0012	but then there's two or three different fire fire extinguishers
S0278	yeah you can't put water on electrical
S0013	yeah that's right
S0278	the safest one to grab be the blue one's powder
S0012	yeah
S0278	and you use powder for anything
S0013	be there any blue ones
S0012	no they're all red
S0013	they're all red
S0278	no red's water i think
S0013	no there be different ones
S0012	there's foam
S0278	really
S0012	there's foam
S0278	be there a foam but it's only for an electrical fire
S0013	i know they do have different ones
S0012	yeah there there's three different ones
S0013	what you have to do when you when you arrive you have to go round know where all things be and that you do do quite a bite of study for about two days don't you you know make sure you know exactly what you be do
S0012	it's quite good though
S0278	when you think how many years these properties have be here it's not likely to
S0012	no
S0013	and that's why we have a no smoke policy we've never see anyone they've go outside
S0278	yeah yeah there's a whole group go outside for a cigarette
S0013	yeah i think so
S0012	it's a shame really when you've get to go outside every ten minutes or quarter of an hour we've get a friend
S0278	well i don't know i don't know whether it didn't really smell of tobacco so he might be puff something else
S0278	he be such a character this bloke
S0013	mm
S0278	yeah he be really good well they all be they be they be all totally different
S0012	one of our friends don't even come here now of course she smoke
S0278	mm
S0012	you know
S0278	well why don't they stop smoke i mean that's friends be more important than smoke aren't they

S0278	it's such a laugh but so there's really only three of us that can read music properly but even on on some of the ones who just have it mark it's easier if you mark the colour but you keep put it on a different note but if and because you can have a whole load of bell ring if you can have the whole erm twelve bell all say ring all at once or something then you can't find your note or ten of them's ring if they're all put in one big straight line on one one clef
S0013	oh great
S0278	can you imagine blob blob blob blob blob and you can't really work out whether yours be there
S0013	yeah
S0278	cos the table's that wide you're stand one side of the table the music's over there because your bell be down in front of it
S0012	yeah

S0012	yeah
S0278	and if you don't come in you get a whack in your rib because you can't move because the bell stay here the elbow come out and hit you

S0278	i don't know i just like it i think it's a bite of fun it's a good laugh
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm there's only three blokes there's that run it there's erm who ring all the big bell
S0012	be they that big
S0278	there's a real weight to lift the things up the big ones
S0013	uhu
S0278	then you can go ding dong ding ding dong you know he's he's he's totally brilliant at it

S0278	sometimes it they've give me four bell before so you've get two that don't get use very much so you've get one you're ring all the time ding ding but then you can go that sideways and bring in another one but they only ring in one direction
S0013	ah okay
S0278	you know gong so you've get ding ding ding ding you see
S0013	oh
S0278	like that so i do manage that but i find they slip in your hand

S0278	you can't remember if that's that that that one or that that one and you've try to and then they've only get their name on one side of the leather
S0012	oh right
S0278	and then you have to wear gloves so you don't spoil the polish can't put your hand onto the metal
