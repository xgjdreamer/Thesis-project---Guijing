S0192	long blonde hair

S0227	i don't know we just weren't
S0192	poorly behave or
S0227	no i don't i i don't think so

S0192	you couldn't mould you as well as they

S0227	er to be honest a lot of the pet you know the favourite ones we call them be dead be a pet be a pet he's dead er be a pet he's dead wasn't a pet he's dead er wasn't a pet he's dead erm
S0192	a lot of dead people
S0227	he's dead yeah

S0192	oh terrible
S0227	yeah so erm yes so erm i'll show you the footage er and see if you can recognise me
S0192	yeah
S0227	i won't i clearly think that that's me that have to be me and then when i start look i think that be definitely me cos then you go into your mind you're look at it as though you're now look in the mirror
S0192	yeah
S0227	and think woah that look different but then once my mind's eye start to look at it i think that's me that be me it can't be anybody but
S0192	make you feel a bite older though
S0227	well it be forty years ago if i'm fifty
S0192	bloody hell yeah you're fifty five today aren't you
S0227	yes tomorrow i will be closer to sixty than fifty
S0192	how do that feel
S0227	er not a but
S0192	although you're already closer aren't you i mean you're fifty five so you've complete fifty five years this be your fifty sixth year
S0227	oh well yeah if you look at it that way yes yeah thank for that that make it even worse
S0192	sorry
S0227	that yeah yeah
S0192	a lot of people forget that don't they when you turn an age you've complete that many years
S0227	yeah exactly yeah
S0192	you've do fifty five years
S0227	exacta mon
S0192	start off at zero
S0227	yeah
S0192	and even then you could add another nine months on that you're in the womb
S0227	yes i know
S0192	so you're almost fifty six
S0227	an an age yes be around for a while
S0192	that make me almost thirty though so i don't really like that either
S0227	no yeah
S0192	that's fair erm do watch the video with you or
S0227	oh well she saw it cos there's there's a little bite there's a couple of bits with her but it's very bleep brief but there be one bite with i can recognise it
S0192	yeah
S0227	i'll show you that bite as well i don't know if you'd recognise her
S0192	cos she work there as well didn't she
S0227	she's about eighteen at the time yeah she's not the same when i leave be i leave july the second seventy six and she go around about march seventy seven
S0192	okay
S0227	so
S0192	you weren't there together
S0227	no but i i be when i go back cos of
S0192	yeah yeah
S0227	i be then but not er
S0192	do you work there though why do you go back
S0227	well i i work well there be something that draw me to go back bite like a salmon
S0192	yeah
S0227	go back to where it be spawn
S0192	i mean it be your home wasn't it for a long time so
S0227	yeah yeah so there be something
S0192	understandable
S0227	that make me go back and then er because one of the girls be there i take a bite of a shine to erm i that kind of prompt me to go back more but i'd go back in seventy eight but erm i didn't feel particularly welcome cos i i think still the taint of the erm not be one of the favourites be still there but when i go back now again in in eighty two i could drive and and acquire a lot more polish i be more charm more accomplish more
S0192	of a man
S0227	i i find me infinitely more useful to them and then i i go rise through the rank very quickly and become the head nun's favourite male so that be quite good
S0192	but be you work there though be they like pay you or anything
S0227	well no i be unemployed yes i get pay but i be unemployed i be i have two job one be to check paperboys erm when they deliver their run and i didn't really do that i just make it up and get the money
S0227	and erm the other job be erm i get money from the ghana fund didn't ask for it but i be give it and i be at erm
S0192	the ghana fund
S0227	yeah erm there be a ghana fund er from africa erm and then from some reason i be get money from from that we'd go up and get it every week
S0192	yeah
S0227	plus i i be get that plus my check up on the paperboys for the for the citizen and also i be get my my unemployment benefit i be actually better off then financially than i'd be when i'd be before i resign from work
S0192	mm
S0227	i have more disposable income strangely
S0192	how long do this ghana fund last for
S0227	i don't know but erm erm i remember it be for at least a year
S0192	what like a few months or a few years or whatever
S0227	be at least a year
S0192	that's cool
S0227	er so yes i so i didn't i have the use of a car the only thing i have to do be put petrol in it if it be you know mine if i be go somewhere but i didn't have to pay for insurance tax wear and tear or anything like that
S0192	why be that
S0227	i could just the the home's car
S0192	oh it be their yeah they be still you use it
S0227	erm
S0192	that's pretty good and do mum work there at this time
S0227	er she do yes she do er yes eighty three be when i meet your mum er er yeah
S0192	have you get any kind of air in here it's quite warm
S0227	yeah she er i be look for for a girl call when i go into the guard room and bump into your mum i think erm your your mum's initial take on me be that she find to be bore but probably the reason be be i realise she she be just freshly marry so er
S0192	stay away
S0227	she well you would do wouldn't you really you would then talk about things that be not kind of
S0192	yeah
S0227	but er then er
S0192	yeah i don't know much about her first husband at all in fact i know nothing i don't even know his name
S0227	er
S0227	ironically 's name be middle name be
S0192	but name after your friend
S0227	after yeah not him
S0227	yeah that just turn out to be a coincidence yeah his name be spell with an e
S0192	yeah
S0227	and er
S0192	so how long have they be marry when you meet mum
S0227	oh about a year at the most
S0192	and how long be she marry to him for
S0227	about eighteen months yeah
S0192	so they divorce pretty quickly then
S0227	er yeah
S0192	some reason in the back of my head i get i have the feel that she be still marry to him when you have me
S0227	no
S0192	no
S0227	no no she be er
S0192	she have divorce him
S0227	yes she have divorce him then
S0192	why do that fall apart so quickly
S0227	er me
S0192	really quick
S0227	me
S0192	fair
S0227	me that's the reason why
S0192	so you go from bore to break apart her marriage in the matter of about six months
S0227	er longer than that there be a what happen be if you it didn't really kick eighty three be when i meet her i think she might have start to take a shine to me although i initially like she say she think i be bore but the look obviously erm
S0192	help
S0227	make an impact
S0192	yeah
S0227	and i have a girlfriend there anyway and erm she then we kind of fraternise a bite well quite a lot but not nothing cos i still have a girlfriend so i be yeah just a bite of flirtation
S0192	bite of banter
S0227	bite of banter yeah that's it then erm the home be cut down and they be make people redundant so your mum rather than have redundancy there be 's be take on some so she go to work at 's go to 's as well cos 's on the scene be at the home
S0192	yeah
S0227	as a fifteen year old there's one photograph of him
S0192	he's a bite younger isn't he
S0227	yeah so erm what happen then be be that i she's move to that and the only reason i will go there now be to see and but i think i think i'd bump into her in or something like that and then i think it start to er she start to go into overdrive erm do most of the pursue er really er and i be then start to make excuse to my girlfriend as to why what be and the rest be history
S0192	be there a point then there where you kind of both decide that you're gonna break up you know finish her first marriage or be this something she decide or
S0227	oh well i she probably erm yeah once i be on the scene erm i think it be find out about it
S0192	do you get any problems from
S0227	no i think i be there i be just say to to and answer a strange thing about this be a woman who'd be a child at the home herself but now be a fully blow blow adult she be about seventy and she be in a wheelchair she be er quite frail when she be in a wheelchair and there be some kind of centenary thing your mum be go to it presumably her husband be i be 's blue eye boy i be go out with and i be suppose to be erm who be her blue eye girl and i be suppose to be wheel madly around on this wheelchair well i'd do my back in i still do the wheelchair but i felt incredibly expose because i think if if something kick off now i'm really not at my best at all er fortunately your mum go he didn't so that didn't but i think you're right on my home turf here er i don't think you're it's gonna kick off i'm physically bigger than you he's about the same kind of he be slimmer
S0192	yeah
S0227	and
S0192	more like my build
S0227	but but no no your build but but erm 's height
S0192	okay
S0227	she like small men i'm the biggest man she's ever be with of all her boyfriends i they're all small
S0192	yeah
S0227	and
S0192	so do you ever meet this guy like talk to
S0227	yeah yeah yeah er we in the same room we never actually speak i don't think i i didn't know him if i'd have know him i couldn't have do what i do
S0192	and over the next bunch of years do he contact her or
S0227	no no no
S0192	he just kind of they divorce and that be it
S0227	they they divorce
S0192	where be he guy
S0227	er last he he be work in he work in a tv shop in in he be work there for years i don't know if she still work there now or not
S0192	high flyer then yeah
S0227	er but er obviously they weren't mean to be if there have be any children i wouldn't have entertain
S0192	no
S0227	but i be young erm she be young erm
S0192	how long have she be see him before she marry him she seem like she dive into it
S0227	that i don't know i know that
S0192	do they go to the same school or something
S0227	no
S0192	oh
S0227	no
S0192	so it can't have be long then
S0227	no she'd have a couple of boyfriends er before him er some guy call then it be then come on the scene with go back at the he'd be like boyfriend and give a bite probably a bite strange cos she be fifteen and and he be fourteen ah one would kind of assume that he never look big for his age be you with me
S0192	yeah yeah
S0227	he's not like a six footer where you'd go well bloody er at fourteen you look eighteen cos you're so tall
S0192	mm
S0227	so he didn't have that so probably a little bite strange at the time but when age move forward it doesn't become so strange any more and then he move off to leighton buzzard so she then and then er and come along after this guy and then er they get marry and er she be all live the marry life but i think it erm erm
S0192	be obviously unsatisfied
S0227	come along and
S0192	quickly tear that apart
S0227	and er well be it quickly cos i say i meet her in eighty three but nothing actually happen until eighty four that summer
S0192	yeah
S0227	so it be a good half a year to a year afterwards that er obviously i
S0192	and then you have me pretty quickly didn't you after that
S0227	well no there be a there be a erm a courtship and then i i go to dump her she didn't like be dump so she do everything she possibly could to cos i i'd be go out with another girl and then i finish with her to start with your mum and then where your mum have be the bite on the side the main and the main the main girl then become the bite on the side
S0192	yeah
S0227	i manage to convince them that both of them that this be gonna be a work progress thing and they both agree to that
S0192	so you be with both of them for some time
S0227	yeah and they know about it how i manage to talk them into it i i be very good at very good at the gab in them days that that last for three months the understand erm
S0192	the question be do you manage to get them both at the same time
S0227	sorry
S0192	now that'll be real work wouldn't it
S0227	yeah well i i could never convince them to do that
S0227	no no no that would have be no no no that'd have be no nice think
S0192	's live with er well it be my mum as well so obviously not a nice think but
S0227	no
S0192	's live with three girls at the moment
S0227	oh i do say i i because i copy your mum in i keep it quite clean i i could have be a bite more graphic and say well that's the iron the wash and the your cook sort for the next year
S0192	yeah and everything else
S0227	cos well that's why i didn't put that in cos i i copy your mum
S0192	yeah i mean it be imply so yeah
S0227	yeah i do say
S0192	i i'm glad that he's with er rather than be with like three chinese boys or something
S0227	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	that don't really wanna chat
S0227	no no
S0192	or do anything have you hear from him again or
S0227	er no i don't know if he's send me a card or what i haven't hear anything he may have send me an email he hasn't send me a phone he hasn't ring or he hasn't text so so he won't so send something not er an email
S0192	no
S0227	or might be something i say to him don't bother about get me a present but i say that in front of erm so that he didn't get me anything but obviously a a card would have be nice or a call but
S0192	yeah i didn't get you card i'm afraid
S0227	no it's don't worry
S0192	ta da
S0227	well you're here so it's not about the card
S0227	erm his place be nice
S0192	oh yeah you saw it
S0227	very it's almost like it it's almost like i've never be to center parcs but if you imagine center parcs as be like little house that be in the middle of the woods
S0192	yeah
S0227	it's exactly like that
S0192	oh nice
S0227	yeah so it's nice erm yeah figure out the heat or something but i say well
S0192	oh yeah
S0227	see if there's a boiler figure it out and if not go and speak and speak at reception erm
S0192	i take it he doesn't pay for that the bill be include
S0227	yes that should all be include yeah there should be heat
S0192	so yeah definitely definitely whack the heat on then
S0227	yeah erm
S0192	have you be have well and i haven't even touch our heat at all we've
S0227	no er well i've just start just er in the morning cos obviously 's there
S0192	yeah of course
S0227	but uh we've be have this fan heater in the in the lounge
S0192	oh yeah
S0227	and keep the central heat off
S0192	that's a bite
S0227	erm that'll probably stop though in october erm he be on about his stomach and i say well that might be although you say you're not nervous it might be your body's way of
S0192	yeah
S0227	of produce yeah
S0192	i've have a bad stomach since i've come back and i'm pretty sure it's anxiety
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	well cos once i start uni it calm down a little bite
S0227	yeah
S0192	erm i be feel ibsey again which i haven't felt for a while
S0227	yeah
S0192	and be kind of like every night i go to bed my stomach be gurgle and turn
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	and feel really kind of tense
S0227	yeah
S0192	erm it's kind of calm down a bite so i think it might be a bite of anxiety for because it's it's quite often tacit isn't it it's not necessarily conscious it's erm
S0227	yes yeah so i do say say say that to him i say to you know my biggest concern with him be that erm he'll females like with me get in the way
S0192	mm
S0227	of things and i'm hop that he he can erm focus to task erm i i haven't send him an email but i felt cos he seem a bite too truthful sometimes and sometimes it's better not to say something to hurt someone's feel and er like he'd say that erm he'd be quite not totally graphic but quite more than explicit er about when he be in thailand yes he wasn't have a girlfriend but he be like you know probably she didn't want to hear it i don't know if he's tell her now that he's share with three females
S0192	yeah yeah
S0227	because if that be her if that be me that would not be music to my ears
S0192	no
S0227	if i be her the paranoia
S0192	he's he's like me in that respect i've
S0227	yes
S0192	erm i think after you and mum break up i go on this truth rampage
S0227	yes
S0192	that like i'm not gonna lie i'm not gonna say anything not truthful
S0227	yes
S0192	or hide anything
S0227	yep
S0192	and i quite hurt the first couple of years that we be together
S0227	yes
S0192	cos i just basically tell her that i didn't want a relationship
S0227	yeah
S0192	i didn't wanna be tie down
S0227	yep yep
S0192	i didn't wanna do this
S0227	yep
S0192	i never cheat on her or anything like that
S0227	no
S0192	but i be brutally honest with the
S0227	yes the the truth yeah sometimes erm
S0192	it's not about lie
S0227	no
S0192	it's about not tell things that don't need to be say
S0227	exactly i i don't call that a lie
S0192	no
S0227	i call that an omission
S0192	it's withhold yeah
S0227	but it's not a lie because if you say well be there any girls there no
S0192	but
S0227	that's a lie if you say erm what's it like oh that's good blah blah blah and you haven't mention anything it's like i get your mum once i have be unfaithful this be before we be marry but she ask the wrong question she say have you be sleep this be with my ex have you be sleep with
S0192	no
S0227	i say no cos i i hadn't i'd do lot of other things i hadn't be asleep she ask the wrong question
S0192	the thing be er
S0227	so i never lie be you with me
S0192	yeah
S0227	cos i be very clever you have to get me on the correct question then well do i lie or not and er have you be sleep with
S0192	no
S0227	well no i be i be honestly i couldn't believe it because it be true she ask the wrong goddamn question but there you go i wasn't go to lead her and say well no you need to ask me another question no
S0192	no i think in hindsight with and i
S0227	oh crap be that thing on
S0192	yeah yeah of course
S0227	oh right edit
S0192	nobody's gonna hear anything you so it's fine
S0227	right it's okay
S0192	erm i think in hindsight erm although it may have be difficult with and i for the first couple of years i think it's actually make us stronger
S0227	yeah
S0192	in the long run
S0227	yeah
S0192	cos we've be honest about how we feel
S0227	yeah
S0192	with kind of each other but
S0227	well
S0192	it be definitely difficult for the first couple of years
S0227	yes yeah
S0192	i didn't really i just didn't wanna be in a relationship for the first couple of years really
S0227	well no
S0192	i have a bite of a problem actually two years when i last come home i decide while we be travel to get everything out in the open and though i do kind of cheat on once when we be right at the begin of our well i say right at the begin kind of the first year of our relationship
S0227	yeah
S0192	i get really drink she leave the club
S0227	yeah
S0192	i get with one of our friends
S0227	yeah
S0192	she want and this girl have like me for a while and she try to get me to go back to her house i walk her home and say that i couldn't do it and so i didn't i just
S0227	yeah
S0192	i just snog the girl that be it
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	but i didn't tell that be the one secret i have from that i didn't tell her
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	i then tell her while we be travel because you know we be take our relationship to the next level
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	so i kind of want to be honest
S0227	yeah
S0192	lo and behold that girl who we hadn't see for age now my other friend be with so when i come to i visit brighton last year to see he's with her
S0227	er oh dear
S0192	so it all come out cos i'd only tell about her a couple of months before we come over even if though it have happen four or five years before
S0227	yeah yeah oh
S0192	so we we all get into a bite of an argument that weekend
S0227	oh
S0192	we all get kind of drink
S0227	oh
S0192	and so
S0227	and drink wasn't a good place to start
S0192	no so er

S0227	yeah
S0192	i'm do four modules and out of those four modules 's only in one
S0227	oh right

S0227	but at least that's some kind of bounce
S0192	yeah
S0227	you can bounce ideas off
S0192	i mean we're both do linguistics
S0227	yeah
S0192	but where as i'm i my four modules be we're both do the core module which be research and language and use

S0192	yes yeah the yeah qualifications
S0227	you can use each other as as bounce er sound board for it
S0192	and i mean still now we can and actually it's kind of easier because you have to there's a big worry about plagiarism
S0227	yeah
S0192	and they don't often get couple work together

S0192	no no of course
S0227	but if she train it's not a problem you can pick her up at the station
S0192	it's nice there though i've get i'm only fifteen minutes from the sea really as the
S0227	yeah that sound when one immediately think of a car but no it's fifteen minutes by foot by foot
S0192	no fifteen minute walk yeah just go down into it
S0227	yeah
S0192	erm
S0227	it's all downhill isn't it from your house
S0192	yeah it's all downhill
S0190	what's the uni like
S0192	university's i think quite nice the campus be nice it's very well facilitate it's a lot better than where i go before but i don't like the architecture it be build in the sixties
S0190	oh art deco deco whatever
S0192	yeah it's this glass plate university thing
S0227	oh right yeah
S0192	same as 's actually it's the same they build another eight universities around the country in the sixties and they're all call glass plate universities be the first be the second and then there be a few others and they're all kind of very modern
S0190	the dig er for brilliant aren't they we love it
S0192	yeah be it nice
S0227	we didn't manage to saw the uni but we saw his where he be it's
S0190	oh it's lovely it's like little holiday village
S0192	yeah
S0190	it's set amongst the tree
S0192	what a great place to live for a year
S0227	mm
S0190	oh absolutely
S0227	yes
S0192	i never get to live on campus i be always off campus
S0227	yes yeah you didn't do you
S0192	no it be erm quite a small university there's only i mean now have get like thirteen thousand students 's get about fifteen thousand have five
S0227	mm
S0192	erm and you could only fit probably normally a british university will only fit the first year on campus anyway
S0227	yeah
S0192	you can't and maybe some international students but we could probably only fit about half of the first year on campus so
S0227	yes yeah
S0192	the other half have to kind of live but i actually i have a good time and we we be still in university accommodation but just off off campus
S0227	yeah
S0192	but the course be really good people be really friendly and nice it's quite intense
S0190	how many be on your course
S0192	erm there's only twelve of us on the the ma apply linguistics course
S0190	and that's you and as well on that
S0192	yep erm
S0190	there's only
S0192	and out of the twelve only three of us be british erm we have two people from saudi arabia we have
S0192	we have a polish person we have a dutch person we have cos it's linguistics so they've be study linguistics in their own country
S0227	yeah
S0192	and they've come to kind of do it in england i'm actually take some third year undergraduate course erm you can choose to do one postgraduate or two third year undergraduate modules so it's actually kind of more work i have to do more study and i'm effectively split more of my time so i have to go into university more i have to read more and do all that kind of stuff
S0227	what end be you do this extra work for
S0192	erm just because the module be more interest i
S0227	ah
S0192	that's what i er i'm do a module in pidgins and creoles and then i'm do a module in syntactic theory which be basically cognitive science so
S0227	yeah
S0192	i'm do a cognitive science module er but they're with they only run them for undergraduates in their third year
S0227	yeah
S0192	the level's quite hard i mean
S0227	yeah
S0192	i'm do more because i'm also do my postgraduate modules as well
S0227	yes
S0192	but erm i'm actually with undergraduates so my class be a little bite bigger for those two class probably like fifteen to twenty students whereas in my postgraduate class probably only about six students in each class cos although there's twelve of us that's split between a bunch of different modules so 's do one module that cross over with english language teach so she's do second language acquisition erm and then that's quite a large class and they're all teachers they're all more teachery
S0227	mm
S0192	but it's good we also have a mandatory three hour erm it's call roles they do like they get researchers to come in and give speeches about linguistics every couple of weeks so we have to go in and do that as well so i'm actually do quite a few more hours than i be do at my undergraduate
S0227	yes at least you don't have to like go and only have a few hours of tuition and you've get to go and research everything yourself
S0192	yeah
S0227	cos i don't think with 's because erm one of 's nest nieces erm that be what she have to do but the majority of it be research but like with with like computers you've get to be actually on these computers you can't say well go to the library and read book about it and pull off the net
S0192	i mean he'll have to do that as well obviously
S0227	yeah but he he need to have obviously front end like the business end of of
S0192	well the next step up once you go to phd be not teach at all it's just research
S0227	yeah
S0192	all research so they're prepare us for that now so although i have three hours a week for each module they tell us that we're expect to do between ten to twenty hours additional on top of that per module
S0227	yeah
S0192	so i i'm currently put in about seven hours of study a day
S0227	yeah
S0192	maybe eight hours
S0227	oh
S0192	i have read wise i do four modules and every module have a weekly read list and then a wider read list on top of that but the weekly read list be about ten book
S0227	yeah
S0192	per module and maybe one to two chapters in each book so total be about forty to fifty chapters a week that i have to read
S0227	oh
S0192	which be ridiculous so there's a lot of read and then we come in and basically if you haven't do the read you can't talk about in class what what you've do the read about
S0227	yes
S0192	but we've be do erm i be analyse german today and in my syntactic analysis class i definitely feel more like i'm do a linguistics course so
S0190	here
S0227	i i would imagine that you're glad that this be a one year course and that this intensitly intensity you wouldn't wanna go in for three years
S0192	no not at this level no
S0227	too too onersome
S0192	if i have the money i think and i would have like to have maybe do it part time cos you can do it over two years
S0227	yeah
S0192	and then it's i guess easier because you're spread that same workload over two years
S0227	just spread the load yeah
S0192	but it would just cost so much to stay in england for two years do that
S0227	yes yeah indeed yeah
S0192	erm
S0227	yeah
S0192	it's good the lecturers be nice it's quite a high standard
S0227	i mean cos you're like you say because you're do your your master's you're quite mature students even really
S0192	mm
S0227	he's go to be older than quite a few of his peer
S0192	yeah
S0227	because er they're gonna come fresh out of school and they're eighteen where he he's a little more season he's bimbled into work
S0192	he's travel
S0227	he's travel he's he's be to quite a few place if you think
S0192	for his age yeah
S0227	for his age i think he's be to he's be to san francisco he's be to the canary islands he's be to german he's be to france he's be to
S0192	korea
S0227	korea
S0192	japan
S0227	japan
S0192	cambodia
S0227	cambodia thailand
S0192	mm
S0227	that for a person his age yep this isn't like just go over to france and benidorm or something you know this be travel so
S0192	mm
S0227	this will make him quite an interest person
S0192	whether or not undergraduates care though i think be the problem i find in my undergraduates course they're like they didn't seem to it doesn't faze them that i've be live out of the uk for six years
S0227	yeah
S0192	i think that be quite an interest feature but they're no
S0227	no
S0192	no interest whatsoever just
S0227	no
S0192	but erm there be a few people on the ma course that be fresh out of their undergraduate
S0227	yes
S0192	so i er i there's the only other british person be call and she's only twenty one she's just graduate from thingamajig so she seem quite a bite younger to me
S0227	mm
S0192	but erm
S0227	mm
S0192	no it's nice if you well when you come up i'll er we can take you up to the campus what's really nice be that it's only a ten minute train which be lovely and it's only a ten minute walk to the train so
S0227	right
S0192	i feel like i can get to and from university very quickly
S0227	how far be the actual university from
S0192	it's about seven kilometres from home
S0227	right
S0192	so and i cycle once
S0227	yeah
S0192	but
S0227	a you haven't it's
S0192	cycle again the problem be once we get on to there's a very clear run for about four kilometres and it's nice but between where i live and there's a lot of roadworks and a lot of one way roads and it's not very safe cycle i don't think
S0227	mm mm
S0192	there's no like cycle paths or anything
S0227	mm
S0192	erm and also with my class monday i've get a long day i'm in from ten until six
S0227	yeah
S0192	so i don't really feel like cycle
S0227	cycle
S0192	no
S0227	at the begin and the end of that no
S0192	no and then and also i have to take in three folders three set of book my lunch all that kind of i've just get no no space
S0227	no no
S0192	tuesday and wednesday i'm in at nine o'clock so i don't really feel like get on my bike that early
S0227	no
S0192	either maybe i will once i'm more in the in the swing of things and thursday i'm off then friday be the only day that i could but this week i couldn't because i know i be come home so
S0227	well at least it's it's for a year and not that you're not enjoy it but it it it that you know this intensity and that i mean and you won't have to after june which compress it down even further you'll still be do it but you won't be have to go in every day cos you'll be dissertations won't you so
S0192	yes yeah yeah absolutely
S0227	you'll be like you know you can back i'm just gonna put these card in
S0192	they've already get us think about that
S0227	well
S0192	try to come up with a dissertation thesis
S0227	i wouldn't even think your brother's have get more discipline but he's still very much lastminute dot com like
S0192	mm it's a bite of a worry
S0227	er i phone him about erm where be you erm cos he hadn't i my mate erm come round for a bite some beers but before he come round i copy i send him an email copy in go i'm not sure if if cos he know he know your mum
S0192	mm
S0227	i say i'm not sure if 's mum's take him or not i say yeah i wait to hear from he didn't respond to that and this be like on the monday and i'm think well he's suppose to be go on the saturday and my mate want to yeah i i i say either it'd be this friday but it's a long shoot cos i think will or erm it's gonna be in the middle of october so i then on wednesday think i haven't hear anything from i'll ring him so i ring and he go i'm just on the way back from the airport and this be er like be it wednesday or the thursday
S0190	wednesday i think
S0227	i think christ you know you're leave it right up to the
S0192	mm
S0227	the wire you're come home and then erm you're go to as you know i think it could have be the thursday cos i say to him about erm erm come on friday and he say well mum be kind of you know erm come to see me i say not a problem i say erm come on saturday with your bike i say but i'll come round yours on friday we'll load up cos what i didn't wanna do be erm have to go to his to load up on saturday okay i'm not try to avoid your mum but
S0192	mm
S0227	erm load up and that when and then we've get it's a detour to go there it's not straight to canterbury it's the go the wrong way
S0192	mm
S0227	when when we go to yours with a van actually go that way be no no not out it be on the flight path so that wasn't a problem so he come saturday morning erm and i'd go to his friday afternoon after work load up get it back here that be to see if be come or not so i think it be the thursday that that i ring yes i think it be so he be come back on thursday to be go to uni on
S0192	cut it fine definitely
S0227	yeah and me think
S0192	i mean i tell you in cambodia he cut it fine quite a few time
S0227	yeah
S0192	i kind of part of me wish that he's miss his flight or miss a bus or something so it have teach him a lesson but
S0227	he hasn't he's get to instil a discipline
S0192	it will fly for the first year he'll be okay that mentality he'll get through and he'll get an okay grade but come the second yeah and definitely the third year he can't be like that you have to be extremely organise
S0227	yeah
S0192	especially once you get to ma level there's no way you could be unorganised
S0227	yes
S0192	there's absolutely no way
S0227	you're the you're the only person that can tell him i can't tell him your mum can't tell him to up his game cos he'll say what game that
S0192	tell him
S0227	you haven't get a clue what you're talk about you what game you've never play the game and i'll be go well actually you're right
S0227	although i do study i i have day reliefs for seven years at college so i do know the discipline of it
S0192	mm
S0227	but not like you do and he will accept it from you more than me cos he'll say er you've do it so i'm gonna i'd be i'm wise to not take council from you
S0192	my concern i think part of what they test you on in a degree i'm not say what you're grade on but like with regard to the work world when you get a job you have to you know they they're expect longevity you get a job they don't want you just change job every six months every year so
S0227	no
S0192	i think half of the reason that a degree be as long as it be be to prove that you can focus on something for that long
S0227	and keep with it
S0192	and keep with it
S0227	yeah
S0192	and that's where people fail because i've get friends that take it almost right to the wire i've get friends that be do really well for two and a half years
S0227	yes
S0192	and then that last half a year and that worry me with
S0227	yes
S0192	that he won't stick through for the three years
S0227	i would rather slowly walk through the erm course than lie down for most of it and find out that i've gotta run like hell for that last hundred metres
S0192	and sprint right at the end yeah
S0227	yeah the tortoise and the hare
S0192	he might pick that up now it take for me to go to university to learn that because let's face it prior to me go to university i be a terrible student
S0227	yes no yeah yeah
S0192	i didn't turn up i didn't do anything
S0227	yeah you've learn through experience like i say i'm hop the the female in spain who seem quite a nice lady see photograph of her very nice erm that her or the ones on the course now will deflect him from mediate him
S0192	yeah do you meet do you meet his housemates or
S0227	er one of them
S0192	one
S0227	yeah erm american girl
S0192	oh okay
S0227	yeah so cos be lock in the toilet she almost become a student herself
S0192	you get lock in the toilet
S0227	i'm in the toilet i can't get out and i'm think oh crap
S0192	do you get out obviously
S0227	well actually yes we do but it be like oh god be we gonna have to bust the door down or something that's a great start erm oh by the way er we've bust your door cos the the mrs be stick in the toilet it we get out and that but er as we kind of meet be lock in the toilet so it be quickly become clear that er you have a brief intro when when we finally release her
S0227	and and the girl depart up the stairs
S0192	you weren't embarrass be you
S0190	no the
S0227	i think you be just relieve to get out the
S0190	well yeah i just think cos there's no way i could go out the window be there
S0227	no
S0192	you be consider it obviously
S0227	that be well that be my i be think be there a window there think can i get in or get in or something to try and figure it out but from this side of the door apart from break it down we can't have a go at that lock can't
S0192	how do you do it
S0190	it be one of those it's not like erm you know like if you've just get like a handle like that
S0192	yeah
S0190	and where the lock be it's just that little button that you twist
S0192	oh okay yeah
S0190	and i think your dad end up pull the door from the other side which clear it so it would flip back but i couldn't get it to flip but it wouldn't turn it just jam
S0192	oh god
S0190	i'm think oh gosh here we go
S0192	but you make it out
S0190	just yeah i make it out

S0192	my short term memory be not great i have to take a lot of note and that kind of stuff
S0190	i do now especially for date on the calendar and that
S0192	mm i mean we there's so much technology nowadays that we don't really need to remember certain things you can just
S0190	yeah but then i think that's not good i think you need to
S0227	if it if it go yeah if bite like you when i'm on a calculator for simple math and then the calculator fail and you're go i don't remember how to do it by paper or mentally yeah so if you be over reliant on
S0192	i mean that's fair those core skills you shouldn't shouldn't really forget
S0227	i think
S0192	but like if i didn't have my laptop all the work that i have to hand in and everything i don't know how i'd keep on top of it i'd just have pile i don't know how people do degrees before this kind of thing i'd just be stack of paper everywhere
S0227	yes yeah
S0190	yeah that's why i think it's that bore cos everything have to be put on to paper didn't it
S0192	yeah gosh that would have be tiresome write a thesis up and then get it wrong a bite and have to go rewrite forty thousand word
S0227	read or type it or whatever
S0192	yeah
S0227	dum dum dum and then you make mistake it's like oh god i'm gonna throw it away rather than just delete and
S0192	yeah
S0227	cut and paste or nothing
S0192	problem be that people don't back up well enough now so i'm terribly worry about you know later on in the course just lose everything it's go
S0227	back it up yeah
S0192	i'm try to keep it on the cloud i mean
S0227	can you put it on can't you put it on the cloud
S0192	yeah i've get
S0227	well put it on mine as well
S0192	i've get it on a hard drive i've get it on a usb and i've get it on a cloud so
S0227	yeah
S0192	hopefully that'll be fine but this cloud so many i can give you a copy as well just incase
S0227	yes that's fine not a problem right i send her that
S0192	i've get a presentation to give in a couple of weeks on erm
S0227	already
S0192	i have to give a presentation on nigerian pidgin phrenology supersegmentals and phonotactics should be interest
S0227	good luck with that
S0192	yeah i know pidgins and creoles be quite interest but it's really difficult to study because instead of study a language i'm study hundreds of languages and you're try to work out basically it's about the genesis of pidgins and creoles how be they develop so not only do you need to understand the lexifier language which would be the super straight so for example english creole or a french creole you kind of need to know a bite of french a bite of spanish
S0227	i've hear of french creole but i've never hear of english creole
S0192	i mean erm nigerian pidgin english jamaican that's an english creole
S0227	yeah yeah man
S0192	yeah
S0227	yeah it's creole course it be isn't it yeah creole
S0192	erm i've be to a couple of place in nicaragua and honduras that be er english creoles on the caribbean coast
S0227	yeah
S0192	erm which at the time fascinate me
S0227	yeah
S0192	but so you need to know about lexifier languages what give them their word but then you also need to know about the substrate which be the african languages that
S0227	yeah
S0192	give them their grammar and give them all this kind of stuff so it's really quite complex
S0227	i bet it be
S0192	and there's no theory there's no set er it's all just
S0227	mm
S0192	you know this be the best idea at the minute but it change
S0227	mm
S0192	syntax be even heavier
S0227	mm
S0192	do like as i say it's cognitive science
S0227	mm
S0192	every book's like a six hundred page maths book of like it's it's all about the language faculty and and it's try to work out language of the mind and like basically do you know noam chomsky
S0227	no
S0192	he revolutionise linguistics and a whole bunch of other departments he's actually the tenth most quote person in modern book now and the er
S0227	oh right cos i don't read book i
S0192	the other nine be dead
S0227	right
S0192	in in the top nine be like plato aristotle and chomsky's like
S0227	yeah
S0192	in the top ten which must be crazy to feel
S0227	yeah
S0192	you know i'm in the top ten of the most
S0227	and still alive
S0192	cos basically the behaviourists before that in the fifties be say that children learn language through positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement from their parent and from their peer
S0227	mm
S0192	but chomsky turn around and come up with what's call plato's problem and the poverty of the stimulus where he's say well how can children produce sentence that they've never hear
S0227	mm
S0192	it's not possible that they just hear the sentence and thus then regurgitate it
S0227	regurgitate
S0192	and how be it that a child will hear a mistake yet know that it's a mistake
S0227	mm
S0192	you'd think that they'd replicate the mistake
S0192	these kind of things so since this the fifties sixties it's explode and it's just go on and they've be try to make and they've work out that the're be there be what's call universal grammar theories there be parameters that basically the child set so for example null subject in english we have to have the subject we have to say i play
S0227	mm
S0192	but in spanish they have a null subject language
S0227	mm
S0192	because the inflection i speak
S0192	you don't need to say
S0227	yeah you don't have to emphasise the er the the the i yeah
S0192	yeah so there's lot of these parameters and they find that all these parameters be binary it's either the language be that or the other and there's like a list of different parameters and basically the last fifty years they've be find the core parameters but but again it's all theory
S0227	mm
S0192	and it's really difficult to prove so
S0227	yeah
S0192	and the problem with it be that it start off as transformational theory and then move on to principles and parameters it then in the eighties and nineties be call government and bind theory now it's call the minimalist programme they keep change it because the the theory's develop so
S0227	yeah
S0192	try to learn about all this be a bite you know there's like
S0227	yeah
S0192	so many theories to try and get through before you actually get to the core of it
S0227	good luck
S0192	yeah i know the problem i be think
S0192	as well how do i apply this in the classroom you know
S0227	yeah
S0192	how be i gonna use this knowledge
S0227	yes plenty with those who who there who be will subject to learn you'd wanna be teach people who want to be there not people who have be force to be there
S0192	no yeah of course
S0227	cos if they're force to be there you'll be go this i'm never gonna impart this to these people
S0192	but i mean mine and 's ultimate goal we don't wanna be teach english language we wanna be teach linguistics
S0227	yeah
S0192	for the future but er we you know we need to have a phd before we can be do that so that's a long way off
S0192	it may never happen
S0227	well yeah
S0192	try
S0227	you've gotta get your master's first get get a get a job do phd part time if you can
S0192	i mean we may do and i have seriously consider try to go to america or canada to do a phd because it's easier to get fund as a foreign student than it be as an as a native student
S0227	yeah
S0192	more more people get fund when they cos the the university it's good for the university to have foreign students so they fund people to come into the university
S0227	mm
S0192	it would also be a way of get our foot in the door with another country
S0227	yeah but would it pay for your like your accommodation and
S0192	fund would if we get the correct fund
S0227	yeah
S0192	would cover everything
S0227	yeah
S0192	they can fund people up to fifteen to twenty thousand pound a year for four years
S0227	er well i would definitely go in two off two prongs at the same time i'd be try to look for work and see if i could do this
S0192	yeah
S0227	rather than just rely on one rely on the phd
S0192	no i mean our plan our plan after this be to go and work in the middle east and save up the money so that we have enough money to self fund ourselves
S0227	mm
S0192	and then if we get fund then we can just save that money we don't need to do it
S0227	yeah
S0192	but
S0227	i'm gonna get change i suppose we're too early to go for the role call of thank yous isn't it phone people up
S0190	yeah my dad won't be home i don't think
S0227	no
S0190	neither will erm i don't know what and be do
S0227	we'll go see them on sunday anyway but i might probably phone them beforehand we're not go out till seven be we so
S0190	no not go till quarter to seven
S0227	quarter to seven walk down
S0192	do we have a reservation
S0190	yeah
S0192	thank you for reserve that i kind of just leave it i didn't i don't really know anywhere around
S0227	well no how you could organise anything from down there
S0192	i don't know anywhere
S0190	well we didn't it it be difficult to know which one to choose from here but er we decide to pick something in just so that your dad now i can't drive
S0227	yeah
S0190	otherwise to pay for a taxi from somewhere
S0192	mm
S0190	there and back erm
S0192	so we can have a beer or something
S0227	oh yeah yeah sure yeah definitely
S0192	beer do complement curry rather well
S0227	it indeed it do right i'm
S0190	take it out so we can have a look
S0227	sorry
S0190	be you gonna take it out so we can have a look
S0192	yeah open it up
S0227	i'm quite good at resist things
S0192	very patient
S0190	i just wanna make sure it's not break
S0192	no it work
S0227	i'll go and get my one out of the car cos er i need to er
S0227	yes i will i will well you're gonna come up at christmas
S0192	mm
S0227	erm i'd say there's a brilliant incentive there
S0192	i
S0227	cos you're mum's gonna i believe christmas day be go to be we're gonna be i don't know where we're gonna be be it or something i'm not sure it's all up in the air but
S0192	oh okay so you're not here cos i've be worry
S0227	no no it's no it's not in that's not in stone but your mum be go to want you to be with her
S0192	i know i've kind of when we've speak about it before i've assume that you won't mind if i'm not here on christmas day and mum really want me to be
S0227	yeah
S0227	don't tell her
S0190	well i want you
S0192	but in i know in hindsight i've be think well that's a bite rude of me to assume that you don't aren't so bother either but
S0227	yeah erm there's a
S0227	there be another way of do this it's a little but it's the sort of thing i would've say er whoever come and get me from be where i be at christmas cos it would be
S0192	oh yeah come and pick me up
S0227	it would be massively audacious for for this to go either way but i'm just gonna give it in one way that mum say oh get your dad to pick you up and he can drop you at mine
S0192	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0227	i feel like er i don't think she'd your mum didn't even give me a chauffeur's uniform
S0227	you know so erm i mean tongue in cheek but we haven't we haven't finalise anything and to be fair er i don't have this emotional baggage
S0192	no you
S0227	that mum have get
S0192	yeah i presume that you wouldn't be so bother
S0227	and i i make things although she doesn't see me pull the string i pull the string to make things easier for her
S0192	yeah
S0227	so she doesn't get upset and stuff like that cos i don't get
S0192	well tentatively i be think christmas eve christmas day at mum's and then box day and
S0227	yep
S0192	the day after at yours
S0227	yeah fine like i say it er cut it down the middle and that erm be a bite like that fable where they the the the the the two mother be fight over the child and the king the wise king decide which mother's gonna get it and they can't decide so he say well i'll cut the baby in half
S0227	and the one of the mother er immediately go for that and the other mother go no
S0192	please don't cut me in half
S0227	no give it to her he then give it because he you know the blah blah blah it's stupid to try and do things like that you know
S0227	it's more stress than anything else for er for the person collect and for the for the other person be collect so no just have your your er your christmas eve your your christmas day and then whatever
S0192	i mean would that work cos actually think about it if if everyone's have a drink on christmas day then get between house
S0227	well no we'll
S0190	well we haven't this be the er the thing that cause the problems last year which be why we go to 's and we all stay over because like you sort of say nobody can have a drink otherwise
S0192	yeah
S0190	erm but normally we alternate which year we have one with my family christmas day and then the opposite swap around but that's all have to change cos like 's now get his own house and so's er my sister in law's lose both her parent in the last couple of years so erm they don't have my brother always want to stay at home christmas day erm they don't have er the parent to come now only my parent and have obviously get her eldest have get er a boyfriend now the one that she's erm share accommodation go to uni with erm and they're hop to get a place of their own so i at the moment it's just we've just say it's gonna come to an a a time when we can't all be together any more
S0192	no
S0190	cos we're too big
S0227	it's it's become too big
S0192	yeah
S0227	i mean we could potentially get an er an invite from again we could get an invite from we could get an er one thing we have kind of agree er well all all the family's agree that 's parent now be too old to be do this they've get the house
S0192	yeah
S0227	so it's not a problem but it's too much work for them
S0227	they've earn their spur they' now have earnt the place to do you know to go somewhere else not have it themselves but the brother's house be next door er which be the old family house i think you may have be there once erm so i mean we could potentially get an er an an invite from and we don't know do we we don't know
S0227	cos now that erm isn't there
S0190	i doubt it because
S0227	unless erm
S0190	erm well they we go there last year don't forget cos we come over or be it 's do we go to 's last year because we come from 's we stay over box er on christmas night go out box day i think we come back here didn't we and then i think we go to do we go to 's or do we go to 's
S0227	's i can't remember
S0227	i can't we may have
S0190	you see by right it should be i think er 's go to and 's on christmas day
S0227	yeah
S0227	i mean if i want to
S0192	become stressful doesn't it
S0192	mm
S0227	if i want to
S0192	because we all want to be together but you just can't
S0227	yeah no
S0190	there's just too many of us
S0227	yeah
S0192	skype facetime
S0227	i could say well where be last christmas he wasn't with us be he no so he must've be with er your mum
S0192	yeah
S0227	he wasn't here so i could say oh well it's my turn now but to be honest
S0192	process of elimination well have you hear what 's talk about at the minute
S0227	er not go to spain
S0190	spain
S0192	yeah mum send me an email say you've gotta convince not to do that blah blah blah blah blah i be like well it's up to him i'm not gonna tell him what to do
S0227	actually i i actually have put that nut in his head
S0190	the more you try and put that into into er er say no the more likely he's want to
S0227	yeah
S0190	and the other thing be surely it's better for him to go out i know she perhaps want to see him but it's my mind it's better for him to go at christmas when he's not take time out of uni
S0192	yes
S0190	as oppose er try to get away in the middle when his study
S0192	that's perhaps it doesn't need to be christmas day i mean he'll break up probably early december and not go back until maybe even february depend on what his course be gonna be so
S0190	but he be talk about her come here wasn't he
S0192	they're pretty tight then
S0227	er
S0192	if he's will to introduce her to the family
S0227	well
S0192	then it's
S0190	well i don't not say he will
S0227	i i i don't know
S0192	oh just to
S0227	erm
S0190	erm
S0227	i have kind of put that idea in his head but i
S0192	it be you be it
S0227	put that idea in his head even earlier by go don't go now go at christmas but he go now and he's kind of
S0192	and now want to go at christmas also
S0227	and he want to go at christmas as well to be honest your mum might be a little bite but
S0192	i know
S0190	i think she's get to give him leeway
S0227	but it's a nice it's a nice change erm
S0192	it it's unfortunate that it happen the one year i'm back
S0227	it's musical chair it's now you're at home and you know erm want to be there apparently oh er
S0190	yeah but that's precisely it
S0192	i think she just want everyone together though didn't she
S0227	well yes it be
S0192	but as you say that
S0192	it become difficult
S0227	yes
S0192	i'll probably be back for like i reckon a week over christmas so
S0227	yeah
S0192	whichever be easiest for you guy just tell me and i'll kinda split it
S0227	yeah
S0192	i won't be able to be home much longer than that i have four exams in the first week of january
S0227	i've get no problem with
S0190	the thing be i'm not be funny it it's lovely for us to see you but what do you do all day
S0192	yeah
S0190	we know that you've get work than you can be do
S0192	mm
S0190	it's a waste of your time you know it'd be better to say come up for like a couple of days here and a couple of days there erm with mum and a couple of days with us and then say to us well we can come down to you
S0192	yeah
S0190	so therefore at least you can study and we can just have the day but you're not have to sit here waste all your time or try to work around other people
S0192	hopefully it'll be okay but i be a bite worry they've i have a mid er mid year assessment and it's the first week in january
S0190	do you want the blind down
S0192	erm if it can come down
S0227	it won't that that blind there it's not gonna go down be it really not gonna
S0190	i can't see which be the blind
S0227	it's that one
S0192	it's right on the line
S0190	can you bring it down
S0192	if's this one here do that oh this plant yeah yeah no don't worry about it
S0227	no don't worry about that that's fine that can take it erm
S0192	oh yeah that's good that's fine okay perfect yeah
S0190	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0227	at the end of the day erm erm surely mum would like that but the thing you have to say erm be oh god that damn things tap isn't it
S0227	you'd better not play that
S0192	nobody else be gonna hear it i mean nobody in our family anyway
S0227	mum shouldn't always get what mum want
S0192	yeah
S0227	be you with me
S0192	yeah of course
S0227	erm and if he want to go away she have to think about him what he want rather than about me me me it it's all good i can show my family blah blah blah we can all integrate and fuse and push all of our families together
S0190	we don't know that be go to be able to accommodate you
S0227	no we no no no no one no no
S0190	she might single child
S0227	that's a that's a sideshow but if he want to go there then she say yes
S0190	then she's that's fine
S0227	then she should say okay have a nice christmas and i'll see you when you get back not say i want you here because you know i want all my children around me and stuff like that
S0192	i can't really comment can i i mean when be the last time i be in england for christmas
S0227	no you can't you've get erm he's do his stint
S0192	mm
S0227	you haven't
S0192	i guess it's just unfortunate that the the year that i'm home he he be talk about go off
S0227	yes
S0192	i haven't get a problem with it but
S0227	yeah
S0192	erm probably would be a bite nicer for me if he be around because i don't really know anyone in the family other than mum and
S0227	yeah
S0192	kind of know a little bite now and obviously 's really the only one that i feel truly close to but
S0227	yes yeah
S0192	erm i'm not gonna
S0227	like i say
S0192	tell him not to go cos he doesn't
S0227	because all you'll be do be serve your own self interest be you with me you'll be say do this for me over what you wanna do for yourself i think to be fair be probably quite self serve and he'll do whatever he want but it he might it might stop him to think if you be put erm a bite of a a emotional trip on him think oh right blah blah blah but erm at the end of the day that that say erm erm yeah mum would like the pair of you there and she's already well two out of three of you's not bad be it i mean okay and just quote the i'd just quote the wise old sage jagger to her you can't always get what you want
S0192	what you want
S0227	exactly
S0192	wise old sage
S0227	well he be he be old
S0192	he's certainly old
S0227	he may not be wise and he may not be a sage but there be those be his word
S0192	oh
S0227	so yeah so i say i'm quite erm as long as i get to see you some er the time erm it's like when i jokingly put i mean you're clever at word so you would have get the little cryptic thing i give you about the the birthday the cuckoo and the nest
S0192	mm
S0227	erm i didn't know what you be do but look at it from just on face value i think hold on a second i think you be come up to see me
S0192	mm
S0227	mum's monopolise this and even then i say well fine whatever i don't cos like i say erm
S0192	yeah i mean she tell me ten o'clock and i just go i'll run it by dad and see what he say
S0227	yeah
S0192	erm you come back with er so i be like i'll just tell her now and
S0227	yeah
S0192	i say one o'clock to her and she she go yeah one be fine so
S0227	yeah
S0192	i mean it be a bite cheeky but at the same time i think she be probably think i'm see the day after so
S0227	yeah she probably doesn't realise it herself i mean or or she do i don't know erm
S0192	nah i'm sure she just think
S0227	but i say i i i'm not i don't have the emotional all those emotionals that it that she have that and feel upset and things like that no
S0192	it can be a bite tough for us in the middle though like try to think i don't wanna you know put off you and i don't wanna put off you so yeah
S0227	yeah but i'm i she's a much tougher than me cos i'll just say er er okay fine whatever and like i say i put in a thing i put i want to emphasise to you that erm what i say be tongue in cheek so i put you a big smiley face on it
S0192	yeah i saw that
S0227	cos to make to cos with when i'm talk to you you can tell by my intonation and my gesture if i'm mean it or i'm just say it as i yeah i don't mind well i do mind but and but i'm try to disguise it and you'll know that but in an email you don't pick up any nuances or nothing like that so i think if i throw a little diagram in you'll know that what i'm say be i'm not that you know i'm not that erm i've just recognise it but if you want to go then or or i'll just say okay fine if it make her happy then do it you know
S0190	do you know when you'll actually finish uni
S0192	erm yes i i finish the twelfth of december
S0190	oh right so you've get a fair old time off over
S0192	yeah so erm and as as will he'll have more time off than i will cos he won't he might have a mid year assessment period maybe but
S0227	mm
S0192	erm university give you a fair bite of time off undergraduate
S0190	well yes because the idea be you get a bite of a job if possible doesn't it
S0192	yeah
S0190	erm especially at 's age group to sort of help fund some of the things you might need to do
S0192	mm so yeah i'll finish on the twelfth and then i'm just i mean what you be say be correct about like my study but i think because it's not coursework because i've just get exams if i come home for a few extra days i think i could study here i might just have to go and lock myself in the room and do it everything should be on my laptop really i should have do everything by that point i just have to study
S0227	mm
S0192	i just have to keep read about it and make sure that i i i follow it so i think i'll be fine i don't know
S0227	yeah
S0192	but he should finish around about mid december i would say erm it's gonna come round quickly isn't it really really quick
S0227	yes it will do it's ninety days
S0192	it's already october next week
S0227	ninety days till christmas
S0192	oh you're count down be you have the have the coca cola advert come on
S0227	just do the math boom straight
S0192	straight answer ninety days
S0227	ninety days erm it erm with i will speak to when i see him next friday i will erm try and stitch him if 's come home be there any work cos 's be leave his key fob and everything and have leave a back door he's get i'm hop he's get a revolve door policy with them
S0192	mm
S0227	erm
S0192	i mean he should do if he's always get work that need to be do
S0227	he's get work that be the slight for him not to go erm to her
S0192	mm
S0227	but the other break kind of be more on system be go good idea if you can afford it but make sure you've do your assignments before you go don't be try to fit everything in when you get back
S0192	i'm a bite concern with how he's view his finance in general he's give me a very kind of blasé
S0227	yeah
S0192	you know i'm be lend so much money that it doesn't really matter i might as well just spend it and i keep try to say to him if somebody have tell me at the begin
S0227	yeah
S0192	take the money don't spend it stick it in an isa come out of your degree with more money than you start with or at least only spend a portion of the money
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	whereas undergraduates just feel like hey i've get this money where do it come from like they just spend it
S0227	yeah
S0192	and then you think oh and i mean i've still get fifteen thousand he's gonna come out with closer to thirty to fifty thousand so
S0227	mm
S0192	if he take the full amount which he keep talk like that's what he's go to do and i'm like well no take the minimum you don't need to er to take
S0227	yes yeah
S0192	i guess if he's never gonna have to pay it back then
S0227	he should he should seek your wise council because there be no substitute for experience i say when i say to him erm about what he's go to and stuff like this it's like with the freshers' week i say i talk as though i've be on this i don't i only know from what i've hear and have a good time blah blah blah you know this be where where you your get to know people and and the way it work and stuff like that and then you knuckle down erm i say but apart from that i i can't give you any experience er any advice because i've never do this before erm so i'm hop that he will actually listen to you and seek your council because you've do it you've make the mistake you know where the where the pitfalls be and you can spare him from do these sort of things as so so if he want to go and see erm at christmas not a problem as long as he make sure that if he's get any assignments they be all do before he go not try to fit them in and just fudge erm erm
S0190	yeah but you'll probably find he won't he he's more chance that he might go early because the flights'll be that much cheaper if he leave it right on top of christmas
S0192	yeah
S0190	it's gonna cost a fortune to go out there
S0192	that's true
S0227	mm
S0190	so he might sort of say if he go soon as he finish he can perhaps have what anything like a good ten days out there
S0192	mm
S0190	erm and sort of you know come back just as everybody else be go so it doesn't cost him quite as much money
S0192	i think that would be a better idea as soon as he
S0190	then he can sit down and study
S0192	as soon as the course finish go out for a week or so come back for christmas and
S0190	that's it and then you've get some time to finish your study
S0192	it really depend on his
S0227	it'd keep your mum happy as long as that's when she want him out there
S0192	mm
S0227	she might want him at christmas be you with me
S0192	mm
S0227	and then he's go to definitely
S0190	but you don't get what you want do you all the time
S0227	er
S0190	you just have to
S0227	no but
S0190	so wait and see
S0227	i think he if he's go to disappoint me your mother or i think erm your mother and i will be a distant second and third to that i would if i be him and that's the trouble that's the problem
S0192	yeah
S0227	so erm yeah so i mean
S0190	yeah but you look at it i'm not be funny he he's have and don't take this the wrong way he's have christmases that haven't really be anything brilliant for the last two or three years because he's be on his own and an awful lot of that time there at christmas so if he's get a chance to have a fun christmas then surely that
S0227	i would go for well
S0190	well you'd go for that wouldn't you
S0192	i feel quite guilty to be honest with you but
S0227	it trump every time i say the only thing i'd say be if he's go at christmas make sure that before that you go you've do everything it's it's nothing for you to come home to
S0192	mm
S0227	it's all do you're not smart enough to be able to go there and then do this
S0192	hopefully his workload in the first semester won't be too heavy
S0227	won't be too heavy
S0192	er
S0227	but i mean i fear that science
S0192	it's go to be that i mean the be a top twenty thirty uni same as they're gonna expect more than i have to do at
S0227	yeah
S0192	so er
S0227	yeah
S0192	erm
S0227	i can't help him
S0192	no
S0227	i give him some money boom boom that's it erm
S0192	i just hope he use his money wisely he i i know he's get some extra money because he do well in his access course so that's good and he one thing that he can do that i couldn't do which be the whole reason i take a year out i want to be self assess
S0227	mm
S0192	i be know that you know if you guy be assess or mum and be assess i wasn't gonna get any help
S0227	mm
S0192	and i purposefully take a year out but only find out in hindsight that you have to have be live on your own for three years not for one year
S0227	yeah
S0192	erm and have be live on his own effectively
S0227	mm
S0192	he's okay he's currently be live with mum but as far as apparently they're concern he's be work so he's a mature student so
S0227	yeah
S0192	he will get more help because he's be assess but he also seem to wanna take all of the money and and the impression he's give me be
S0227	yeah
S0192	just it's free money and i can just kind of spend it
S0227	it's not oh it's not free he'll end up have to pay a bite or or erm keep service the erm the interest without any of the equity and that could cost him an absolute fortune over over
S0192	i think he'll
S0227	his work life
S0192	i think he'll go travel over the summer again i think he's get the bug a little bite now
S0227	he's get he's get the bug yeah i just wish i say about the girls and that's easy for me to say but i say focus on the mission girls that will all come later but sometimes people want everything now especially
S0192	my concern with him travel he he spend more than i do travel
S0227	yes he's not get you he's
S0192	he just he just already have a higher standard than i do at his age so
S0227	yeah he be i mean like your your mum at her age will happily go camp and stuff like that even at that age now he's go
S0192	no
S0227	no
S0192	do you know how much he he he get with some girl and must have pay about sixty seventy pound for a room a a wooden hut on the coast in thailand it sound lovely for about sixty seventy pound really nice mini bar all that kind of stuff i get a very similar one for about eight pound when i be there you know what i mean
S0227	yeah
S0192	probably not quite the same standard but it be a beach hut
S0227	yes
S0192	on on the beach
S0227	he's get he's get standards
S0190	you're more far more mature in your attitude
S0227	yes
S0190	and have be over the years
S0192	mm
S0190	than he ever have be
S0192	mm
S0227	yeah and you're
S0192	he seem to when it be good to see him when he be out there he seem like or the first time he really seem like he'd come on a bite when he be out there but
S0190	oh yeah he's he's come on an awful lot
S0192	but then he come home and mum have be like he's go backwards again he just like didn't come out of his room didn't wanna kind of do anything
S0190	no
S0192	and i guess he be in a bite of limbo at that point
S0227	yeah kind of
S0190	he's be texting
S0192	yes
S0227	even when
S0192	he be so confident out there he be happy to talk to me he really it be nice to spend some good time with him but but yeah i agree i do agree he say to me he feel bad about it and he say you know i felt like i feel i'm behind i feel like i'm younger than other people but i've kind of be in limbo for the last four or five years now i'm kind of catch up i say i don't think it
S0190	yes he yeah
S0227	i think in a way he's
S0192	problem be he's compare himself to me a little bite
S0227	yeah
S0192	say to him don't compare yourself to
S0227	no
S0192	because he's not the average like you know most people weren't do this at your age
S0227	no no
S0190	no but on on the other hand what you be do when he be younger he didn't do
S0192	no
S0190	he be and he can didn't he he be quite sad really one day he come and he sit here at teatime and he say i just feel on my own because all my friends have get girlfriends or something and get something else i don't anything i don't have any to do with anybody else
S0192	how long have with this
S0190	you know he spend so oh what a good year or more do you remember we sit at the table
S0227	before oh it be before his girlfriend erm what's her name now
S0190	no it wasn't it's be since
S0227	oh since oh yes right yeah yeah
S0192	that be her name phew
S0227	when him and break up yeah yeah he do feel
S0190	and he say since then
S0227	i i think everyone every guy or woman will feel sorry for themselves once
S0192	you're not gonna feel good
S0227	it wasn't his the erm the disintegration of that relationship wasn't be mostly her not him
S0192	i felt guilty i felt like i abandon him when he be younger that you guy divorce and i just kind of go off and i didn't spend much time with him and then i go to uni and then i've live abroad and i felt
S0227	wasn't your place
S0190	you all have to find your own way to cope with it
S0227	yeah
S0190	i mean you could have stay here and him still not have any be any different to what you be you know and in fact you might have argue and because you'd have felt you need to take over dad's place because you saw more of him than dad so you be try to streamroll him into do things he could see so it might have spoil your relationship so there's not i shouldn't feel guilty about it
S0227	yeah don't beat yourself up
S0192	no i be please when he come out to cambodia
S0190	yeah
S0192	we felt close i felt close to him but now since i've come home i be at home er mum be our way and i come up here a few time and you know a few weeks ago he didn't spend any time with me at all he i be quite surprise cos we be really tight in cambodia
S0227	yes
S0192	and then we come home i come home and he wouldn't get out of bed until twelve or one
S0227	yeah
S0192	or something and then he's just
S0227	like i say he
S0192	i try to cook with him a bite and stuff
S0227	yeah
S0192	we do once or twice but i have to push i have to really push
S0227	he need constant push because if he doesn't he slow he slide back into himself i think
S0190	he's so use to spend time on his own and that isn't he
S0227	i
S0190	he's take himself to his room and he play on his computer and he's do that
S0192	yeah
S0190	for years and years
S0192	he say to me he like time to himself and i say that's fair
S0190	well that's fine but
S0192	yeah
S0190	but because he hasn't have a break from that it's a case of come down and play with oh 's go to bed i'll sit and talk to mum
S0192	mm
S0190	or something he didn't have the friends to go out with
S0192	mm
S0190	and he he so that you can't just keep go to place to try and find somebody as if you're on the but he hadn't even get any male friends because they'd all go different ways
S0227	and and that have
S0192	go to saint albans didn't he
S0227	well their own they've get their own relationships that's that thing be if you see people in couple cos you're couple er although your single friends it it become a bite difficult erm
S0192	definitely
S0227	erm because your friend be still in a relationship and he's go well i can see you like every now and again but like i can't be see you four or five time a week
S0192	no
S0227	because i'm in a relationship i can't do that i think with 's he have a tendency he realise that he now i think he's categorise his his childhood as not be a very nice one
S0192	yeah he have
S0227	and i think he blame your mum for it
S0192	yeah he do
S0227	now she have to have some put her hand up to some of it and i have to put my hand up to some of it as well
S0192	no i mean
S0227	but it's not all down to that but i think he focus i think he probably blame her a lot more than he blame me because she be the architect but i still must put my hand up to an extent but so that
S0192	no he be quite brutally honest with me when he be out there and i kinda have to say to him yes obviously as you're say mum make mistake
S0227	mm
S0192	but you can't say she didn't try to be a good mother she
S0227	yeah
S0192	may have make lot of mistake throughout the years but she clearly put effort in to be a good mum it he's kinda yeah what you're say be just give a blanket impression of how his childhood be
S0227	yes yeah
S0192	and i say well prior to this happen you know we have a good time we be pretty happy
S0227	yeah
S0192	erm and he could have react differently
S0227	mm
S0192	to the whole thing ah it's difficult because he be young wasn't he so he he didn't have the option that i do to to get out of the scenario
S0227	yeah he be ten he be ten
S0192	he be stick in it and that i feel quite guilty about
S0227	or he be eleven yeah
S0192	erm
S0227	but er
S0192	hopefully this'll be yeah but i just hope he get the degree
S0227	well yeah
S0192	cos it's a lot of money to do
S0227	yes and i hope he doesn't blow a fortune in erm i don't care how much money er the first care be i don't care how much money he blow in its acquisition
S0192	mm
S0227	the second care be i hope he acquire it without blow that much money be you with me
S0192	yeah yeah
S0227	and he doesn't drop out i mean i will not be happy with him after this that he give up a job that wasn't you know it wasn't the best job in the world but there's a hell of a lot of worse job in and it be something that he be good at it be on his doorstep erm and he could have network into something else rather than i admire him for give it up and do this but he must stick through it you know
S0192	i mean if he drop out because he have love interest or he can't be bother
S0227	oh i'd be incandescent with with displeasure
S0192	that's not good if he drop out because it's too difficult
S0227	yes
S0192	that's fair i mean
S0227	yes
S0192	he's do a difficult course
S0227	yes
S0192	computer science isn't go to be an easy course
S0227	yes
S0192	i can't begin to fathom it so
S0227	yeah no i don't think it will be like i say erm if that i'll understand that and i'll say well you must now get back into the workplace
S0192	but even if he just get a c that's better than you know no degree if you come out you've spend
S0227	yes
S0192	twenty thousand pound but you've get nothing
S0227	well this be this be that's this be where your wise council come in that you know i i've say to him look you're on a mission now the mission be to get that degree you go from here to here ba ba ba and you get it and this will then enable you to do what you wanna do if you wanna travel well you'd better get a job you'll be able to travel blah blah blah
S0192	i've be try to get him to think about postgraduate go on to do a master cos if he do well in his degree
S0227	yeah one step at a time
S0192	i know but
S0227	give him one step at cos otherwise i he might be daunt by
S0192	but it give him a reason to get that
S0227	yeah
S0192	if he can see why he need this to do the next thing
S0227	mm
S0192	if he's think well what be the next thing i don't need this then it's a problem so
S0227	well hopefully i'm hop his work placement might give him a a an experience and a job and cos i think he do have a mission as in what type of job he want to do if he
S0192	he want money as well
S0227	he want he wasn't the
S0227	he want basically there be
S0192	he want a comfortable lifestyle
S0227	in relation of you that he want he's see you go erm holiday a lot and travel and he want this as well but he need to have a trouble be your line of work give you longer holiday
S0192	mm
S0227	his line of work will give him four week if he move to america if he want a job in america er most of them get about a week off
S0192	yeah it's terrible isn't it yeah
S0227	know this so erm erm in the uk he'll get a job that'll give him four or five or even six weeks off but that doesn't give him that range of what you have you know he could travel in those time but
S0192	well i choose a field because i want to travel and it be a combination of travel and work so i find something
S0227	and you're able to ply your trade where you've travel
S0192	mm
S0227	so it's all you know you're at work but you're almost on holiday at the same time cos you this be not the country of your birth you know i be somewhere else
S0192	yeah still feel like travel
S0227	so
S0192	definitely feel like work though
S0227	it now yes
S0192	it doesn't quite feel like a holiday
S0227	this now feel like more work because you're in the land of your birth and you're work there's okay you're not in that would be a real stretch on your imagination of try to romanticise it at least with brighton you can say oh we're by the sea and it's south of england it's not here or like so it's it's it's not as good as be abroad er but it's better than be in
S0192	without we want to and i really really want i think we tell you
S0227	yes you do
S0192	we want to go to the netherlands
S0227	yes
S0192	or even scotland
S0227	yes
S0192	but cos we want we want to be close we want to be able to see family this year and have the money that we could you know every month come back home and do that kind of stuff
S0227	yeah
S0192	but it just wouldn't work they there's the myopic that you must have your degree from a native english speak country
S0227	yes
S0192	even though it's a top one hundred world university even though it's bilingual
S0227	give them what they want cos if it open more doors that's that's that's what you have to do
S0192	cost a lot more though
S0227	the end justify the mean
S0192	pretty sure that rule be there because these english speak universities have set that rule
S0227	well well
S0192	so that we continue to come to the english speak universities yeah
S0227	well wouldn't you
S0192	oh yeah definitely
S0227	yes if you can monopolise something and contain it or control it you that's what you do no one want to lose control of something that they find precious but i think by the sound of it
S0192	how's do now he's move in have he settle
S0190	he should be here in a few minutes
S0192	oh be he come over
S0190	yeah he's go to erm he he's in between he he give up his job in erm northampton and go to because he get on really well with erm his immediate boss when he be there and excuse me he leave he always want to keep go this boss and follow him he he keep hound him and hound him and that he say come on you've get more chance you're you're like me you want to get on and you want to go up on the scale you don't want to sit at this level so to do that you'll do well but unfortunately when he actually get there and get stick in what he set out or what he be give to believe didn't come about and they change everything and he would just have be a door knocker
S0227	mm
S0190	literally and say oh i'm not do that i'm not do it
S0192	no fair
S0190	but he be very very lucky in the fact that my brother suddenly decide that he could train him up and he'd like it so he's go to work for my brother
S0192	oh brilliant
S0190	so or he will do he start on monday
S0192	fantastic
S0190	erm and what have you so er he's quite look forward to that i think
S0192	be that the neo

S0192	oh gosh
S0190	so share a car doesn't and then his phone break so he wasn't a happy bunny

S0227	this one's smaller than my other one
S0190	quantity here

S0190	i think he like it he's have a couple of which what's the word erm
S0227	setbacks
S0190	snag if you like
S0192	yeah
S0190	that you always think oh yes this look okay and then
S0227	it get slimmer

S0190	you're certainly lose it dear you really be i'm get seriously worry
S0227	slimmer isn't it what do you think miss i don't think dad i'm a cat
S0190	right well let's hope this one'll be a bite better
S0227	yeah oh so i'll see if i
S0192	what kind of problems have they have then
S0190	so erm he they've get like a the house be all really nicely do up the only real fault that they have that they could see be the fact that they've get this lounge diner and it's get like a really a really sort of old date carpet
S0192	mm
S0190	through erm and that the chap do apologise in that when he move out he say i'm sorry i've have them in to clean the carpet it's be down no don't worry it doesn't erm say don't worry because it won't go with suite so and because erm my girlfriend's erm father work here and things
S0192	mm
S0190	we get carpet really cheap so look please don't worry about them so they know they've get to do that and that be get that sort but they've get like an old fashion corner bath
S0192	okay
S0190	it's really nicely set out in the bathroom er and they've get like one one end it's like they have in the sort of tap with the shower across the top
S0192	okay yeah yeah
S0190	but it's also get the other end of the bath an overhead shower
S0192	oh
S0190	well they don't like bath they like shower
S0192	yeah
S0190	but when they go to use this shower to stand in it it wouldn't come the couldn't get any hot water out of it
S0192	oh
S0190	so they've now have to pay for a new shower to be put in
S0192	that's no good
S0190	cos rather than try and fix it so all the pip have to be do to put that in properly
S0192	that wasn't cheap
S0190	no
S0227	be much faster sorry guy
S0190	the new toy
S0192	that be that it or have there be more problems
S0190	that that be it then erm his dad buy him a television table to put his television on cos he buy himself a new tv and the television table be fine but it can't go in the place because the other sofa won't fit in
S0192	oh
S0190	so then after that's probably gotta go up in the man cave so he then have to go out and find some other form to do it but he to drill all the wire cos the wire have to go so you know it's just little things but
S0192	part of get your own house isn't it i guess yeah
S0190	he's sit last weekend he say come oh come and see the carpet and that mum see how how we're get on so i say okay then and then you'll see the other stuff we've do so i say right we'll bring your stuff up well they want our white garden furniture
S0192	mm
S0190	say have than and then load of bits and piece golf club and his badminton racket and all these bits and piece that have be in our garage
S0190	so we load the car full and bless him when we get up there he's get open at the back and he's try to clear all the rubbish up that they've get have leave all the old carpet and everything so there's hey don't come and bring any rubbish up here so i say we're not bring rubbish as far as we're concern
S0192	it's your stuff
S0190	it's your stuff it's up to you now to decide what you wanna do with it
S0192	it's go in your house
S0190	so erm
S0192	so this be a mortgage this place isn't it
S0190	pardon
S0192	this be it's mortgage
S0190	oh yes buy it yeah it's theirs
S0192	yeah so oh that's a big move isn't it get your first mortgage
S0190	it be a big move but like say if you look at the comparison of what you're pay for a something that be very
S0192	isn't it from what i've hear
S0190	yeah i mean it be he he's do very very well he he's take a very small mortgage to compare to what they offer him
S0192	yeah
S0190	erm and that so he be do a lot better off have this mortgage than he do when he rent the place and it's his
S0192	it's so much better than money down the drain isn't it
S0190	oh gosh yeah definitely
S0192	every month just nothing and i be just oh i don't know how we'd ever get on the property but er
S0190	well i'm sure you will when if if you get to the stage where you pass all your exams and things there's no reason why you shouldn't have a semi decent job
S0192	no i mean i guess
S0190	so therefore you'll have the money to think about
S0192	yeah i guess if we stop put the money on education or travel then maybe we could save
S0190	that's right
S0192	but we haven't really be earn very much although i've be able to save a bite we've only be on about fourteen thousand pound in south korea so it's not actually a lot of money it's just that we we
S0227	although your bill be pay aren't they
S0192	yeah the bill be cover and the rent cover so it kind of and then the cost of living's cheaper so that kind of keep keep go up but when you actually take it for what it be to get i mean how much do you have to put down on a mortgage maybe thirty thousand
S0190	five percent depend on the property doesn't it
S0192	yeah it completely vary
S0190	so yeah
S0192	but then and i would have to be very settle wouldn't we to be able to do that as well unless you just mortgage it and then rent it immediately to somebody else i can't see how we'd be able to do it
S0190	well you can
S0192	and i feel a bite bad do that to somebody else make somebody else pay my mortgage
S0190	why
S0192	while they live there
S0190	because it give them a home
S0192	it do but
S0190	give somebody else a home a chance that they probably can't if any other way there just aren't the amount of house at the moment be there
S0192	i just feel like that's kind of half the problem with why rent's so high in the uk if people just didn't you know you get one guy that own twenty house then he's like well i i own it all so i'll just put the rent up and i just i don't know
S0190	i do well the thing that annoy me more than anything be that if you drive around and have a look in quite there's quite a few place just board up where people have buy the property when it be good
S0192	oh yeah oh yeah
S0190	and to put sink their money into and now they're well there's people want home you should only be allow to hold a house for so long with like live in it or rent it
S0192	yeah i mean there be enough house for everyone
S0190	there be
S0192	there be there's not a shortage of house erm i i personally be of the belief this be again slightly ethical issue my own belief i don't think we should be able to own more than two house i don't i think it would solve quite a few problems it would stop have so many people need to rent if you just say look why do you need more than your main home and perhaps a summer home somewhere else do you really need to own more than that i mean i guess most people don't but some some people do
S0190	but you see if they're property developers and do this they need to own them to rent them out don't they to make the money to go on to do the next one
S0192	yeah to do more
S0190	and there's the people that don't do it want to sort of invest money into the property
S0192	i mean i understand for new house but it get me when you're talk think about an old house that's be pay for twenty time over and yet people be still pay for the same bricks and mortar that be be build a hundred years ago a hundred and fifty years ago
S0190	yeah but the more that the the older the property the more you're take on
S0192	mm
S0190	because the bill it's like now dad's have to
S0192	the insulations not so good
S0190	that's right that er the roof be like that the windows the heat
S0192	things break the maintenance
S0190	the boilers it cost you far more to run an older house than i mean it doesn't cost much my dad as much to run his five bedroomed house and that as it do to us to run this
S0192	i mean i'm a bite of socialist really i think probably at heart i would say we all own all of the house you apply to move house and we all put in a little bite of month into a pot that mean that your house be maintain by some external company where we don't even need to extend
S0190	no no i i er i don't know
S0192	i mean that's fine
S0190	i'm so possessions
S0192	and and that's why people that's why it isn't like that cos most people agree
S0190	yeah but you see it's everybody's get a different outlook haven't they
S0192	yeah
S0190	if you think how many place that people just trash absolutely trash them
S0192	i mean effectively it would be yours in this scenario you would be under no pressure to move nobody can force you out it's your house but if you want to move you just er you just look at all the available house kind of like a house swap do you know what i mean you just swap house you don't really oh you can change it you can modify it because it's yours while you're live there but you don't sell it as such it's you don't have the money from it you just move to another house so you apply that's the system that i'm kind of imagine to a certain degree so the house this would still be yours and if you want to live here for you know forever you can do that but if you decide well you know i wanna see what it's like in devon you could go on a website and see who be want to move out of devon and then just kind of swap
S0190	but you can do that can't you now
S0192	you can yeah to a certain degree
S0190	i wouldn't i wouldn't wanna leave somebody in my house back
S0192	but i'm talk about an all encompass system
S0190	for everybody yeah
S0192	where everyone and then maintenance be kind of more of an external thing you don't need if something break in your house if effectively it just come out of tax if you're like this be break then it just you know some company come round a government agency and fix it rather than you have to do that yourself cos you get people as well that i have a friend that get a mortgage and he have their house flood in america and he's just get the house and then the house flood like there be a freak weather accident in in nashville or tennessee and just lump them with mass and mass of debt just
S0190	mm
S0192	they weren't to know that that be go to happen it seem very unfortunate
S0190	well my friend exactly the same she live in wellingborough and erm she's just move in with her partner now and he daughter's be live in her house that she have that she split with her husband and she manage to get a property of her own and er one day her daughter up mum you're gonna have to come over and sort this water out there's so much water cos think oh yeah with the rain then she go oh gosh mum if you don't come and sort this out it's go it's nearly up to the conservatory you're have and the long and the short of it be that basically somebody have do some work or some build they've erm do it on the er the floodplains
S0192	mm
S0190	there's a and then what they've do they've disturb a spring and so she's have to pay for a pump to pump out the water on to the street
S0192	why's that her responsibility
S0190	because it's her house and her property
S0192	but someone else yeah but but but ethically should it be if somebody else have make
S0190	so she just well this be what she say it's not mine i didn't take this or nobody warn me of this
S0192	no
S0190	it be all you know fine when we move in and i think this somebody have do something to unsettle it and so of course she what can i do nobody's gonna buy it be they cos no nobody'll take hand put their hand up and say it's our fault we'll sort it nobody'll do it she's get to do it herself it's gonna cost thousands thousands
S0192	it's no good be it
S0190	it isn't
S0192	never a problem in korea and china be phenomenal how many vacant properties there be i mean they don't build properties like we do there's a lot of high rise build but china especially they can't they're not allow to take large sum of money out of the country so rich people within china be invest in property so they're just build new tower block everywhere and it's crazy you go there's just literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of massive tower block with nobody in them there's no one there and it really get to me in mokpo because when i be live in korea there's so few homeless people really be compare to england there's so few i mean the whole of mokpo i only ever saw one and it be sadder for me because he's alone he he didn't have a community of homeless people it be just him and i look around and see all these vacant flats and think why can't he just have one you know why why be he i think he die that winter to tell you cos i never saw him again after that but
S0190	mm
S0192	he be like you know shoe be fall he's get string tie around his shoe and stuff kind of guy just hold his sole on to the bottom of his shoe and like he didn't beg no one give him money or anything like that he just would just walk around town and like just sit in the corner couldn't they don't really have homeless people so when they do have one or two they just slip through nothing there's nothing there to help them
S0190	so how do they survive
S0192	i he look like he'd be on the street for a while maybe he move on maybe he be a bite of a vagrant and move on but i don't know i don't know how he survive i saw him quite a lot i felt i really want because at the time i felt terrible because and i be allot an apartment each but we only be use one and i have a whole i be so close to just go to the guy but then i be like i'm responsible for this apartment
S0190	mm once in you can't mm
S0192	if he go in there and destroy it you know i can't you know i'm responsible for that but it pain me to see him every day and to think there be so many place where you could put a roof over your head
S0190	but why be he homeless
S0192	i don't know
S0190	this be the thing isn't it you've get to look at the overall picture and think you know some people genuinely need the help to sort themselves out to do this
S0192	mm
S0190	and others have put themselves in the position themselves
S0192	i mean it wouldn't be i mean in england we have a problem like people take drug or something and we think you know you've get there that's your problem you've do it it wouldn't have be that in korea you don't have access to them they just aren't there so it wouldn't have be drug could have be alcohol i guess which be a drug erm but he didn't really look like an alcoholic i don't know he strike me as like the type of person who just have no family and they're very family orient
S0190	mm
S0192	and i feel like if you have no family you're just on your own i don't know if you they don't really talk to people you can't really have friends with people that aren't your age either which be very strange so the usually people's best friends be the same age as them and usually the same sex so if he if he just didn't know anyone just have no family i just i don't know
