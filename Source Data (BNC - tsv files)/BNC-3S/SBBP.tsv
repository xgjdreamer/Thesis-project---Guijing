S0266	what what do you teach there
S0314	i be in primary
S0266	oh right
S0314	yeah
S0266	be it very different from here
S0314	they be it be before we have a national curriculum so everything be prescribe and i'd never come across a national curriculum before i just think you know like we use to make it up as we go along and just do topic work you know and if it be if it be snow outside you just run outside
S0269	mm
S0314	and make snowball and
S0269	mm
S0314	look at ice crystals or if the leave suddenly i remember be at here and it be the day when the oak no the horse chestnut outside decide to lose its leave and it do it every year and if you if it be a really crisp frost day you could hear if you stand next to the tree you could hear the snap
S0269	mm
S0314	of the leaf
S0269	mm
S0314	leave the branch
S0269	oh
S0314	so i'm stand there with the kid listen to all this snap and it be just watch these leave and they're huge things horse chestnut leave and they be all spiral down and that's what you use to do
S0269	mm
S0314	when you be a primary school teacher and you be you be able to be creative and act spontaneously and have a lot of fun
S0269	right right
S0314	now it's just
S0269	mm
S0314	vile
S0269	mm
S0314	it's just all prescribe and horrible
S0266	so in australia what do you have to do
S0314	well i i didn't because the file be this thick and and i teach with a woman who share the classroom and i kind of tune into what she be do and kind of
S0314	i couldn't read these file i can't do it even if i'd sit there all night and read them it would've go in in one
S0269	mm straight out the other
S0314	side of me brain and out the other so i kind of look at and just kind of make it up as i go along which seem to be alright cos the parent come in and and thank me and say they really enjoy your class
S0314	probably cos i do a lot of art no it's
S0269	mm
S0314	it that be a i couldn't believe it queensland have a national curriculum and erm i think
