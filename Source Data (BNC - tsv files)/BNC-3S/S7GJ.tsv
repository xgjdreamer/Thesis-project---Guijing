S0041	sour grapes

S0046	er
S0041	she sound like a nutter
S0046	she's just twist in the head
S0084	huh why what's she say now
S0046	she's not she's just keep me on a leash and it's do my head in
S0084	well don't have it

S0084	well you go round to um get all your stuff on saturday
S0046	no they just come through the post today
S0084	right well if you if you really wanna cut her out don't go and get any present from her cos then she really will have a hold over you won't she
S0046	will she bollocks
S0084	well why be you go to get present from her
S0041	oh yeah then she can get round to come round and try and claim them back
S0046	can she
S0041	yeah
S0084	well why would
S0041	she know where you live don't she
S0046	yeah
S0084	if you've break up why would she give you present
S0046	well that's
S0084	cos she'd already buy them
S0046	yeah
S0084	seem a bite strange but okay
S0046	i've get a good mind to tell her just to send them back but no
S0041	if it be me i would
S0084	it would make more sense because then it's a clean break
S0046	it be
S0084	rather than here's a present but we've break up
S0046	but they be a nice pair of jeans though they er they really be
S0084	i just think it it lead to confusion later on down the line cos especially if she's a bite mental which er basically she sound a bite crazy
S0046	i'm not gonna get do for theft
S0084	oh no that's not what i mean i just mean in her mind she might see it as
S0041	you owe her one
S0084	some sort of tie
S0046	no
S0041	well i think you might be right with that you know she sound like a nut job to me
S0046	she do a little
S0041	like do you know any other person that would behave that way
S0084	mm
S0041	like
S0084	what do you mean
S0041	just you know if if they argue over something okay bye
S0046	yeah
S0084	well she's er she's er it's
S0046	especially if you want er very
S0084	that's what i say
S0046	especially if you want a relationship you know
S0084	if it be something that matter to her she wouldn't just walk away
S0041	yeah
S0046	i know i know i say some hurtful things it doesn't mean that i mean them you know at the end of the day i be emotionally hurt too after what happen you know so i say to i say some things that i probably didn't overly mean
S0041	i think you've hit the nail on the head there now bear that in mind that for a girl to walk away so easy for a guy to walk away cut cut emotional tie like that
S0084	mm
S0041	we saw this when we have the saga
S0084	yeah
S0041	in the house
S0084	yeah
S0046	mm
S0041	and the his situation boys be very much more capable of cut that emotional
S0084	yeah
S0041	bond and
S0084	yeah
S0041	walk
S0046	not me
S0041	girls be
S0084	typically
S0041	well no but typically but girls typically aren't so if she's capable of do that like she keep pull either one she's bullshit so she can keep you on a lead and she's actually not gonna walk anywhere
S0084	yeah
S0041	in which case please yourself cos she's not go anywhere
S0046	mm
S0041	or secondly she doesn't care for you at all cos girls just can't do that
S0084	and i mean you've gotta remember that within moments of meet her she'd say to you i wanna have a a kid
S0046	mhm
S0084	and within moments of meet her
S0046	mhm
S0084	she's suddenly miraculously pregnant
S0041	yeah
S0084	like i'm not be
S0046	mm
S0084	i'm not
S0046	no i
S0084	a conspiracy theorist but that that maths doesn't add up do it er you just seem to be right guy a guy right time
S0046	yeah
S0084	she's look
S0041	yeah
S0084	she want to have another kid by the time she's thirty
S0046	yeah
S0084	she want to find someone to father that kid
S0046	yeah
S0041	yeah
S0084	so ultimately you've sort of serve the purpose i think in her eye
S0041	yeah
S0084	it hasn't work and er now she's try to move on to find another baby daddy er but she doesn't sound like a particularly nice person
S0041	she sound like a nut job
S0084	she doesn't have your best interest at heart
S0041	certainly not
S0046	she she she's gonna end up lonely
S0084	agree but i think you need to
S0041	as long as you're not there
S0084	you need to cut and run while you're not too emotionally attach
S0046	too late for that i think
S0084	well you've gotta just
S0041	so the more time you spend
S0084	yeah
S0041	the worse it's gonna get
S0084	you've just gotta cut er
S0046	well
S0084	cut your tie now
S0046	i'm gonna get my shit get my hair cut
S0041	you're bloody mental
S0084	if i be you i would have nothing to do with her
S0041	no
S0084	because you're encourage her by go round there it's only gonna
S0046	if i
S0084	it'll end in an argument isn't it you know
S0046	but if i if i keep her where i want her
S0084	you can't you can't
S0041	but she's not where you want her be she
S0084	she's gonna carry on mess with your head
S0041	she's not where you want her now
S0046	but if i take the stuff then she's more where i want her than when i not when i haven't get it
S0041	so where be she gonna be then if you if you go and take the stuff then what position do you think what advantageous position do you think that leave her in
S0046	like the whole friendship oh maybe he's change
S0084	i don't think you can have a friendship with this person you don't really know her do you know what i mean
S0046	i i know her er
S0084	you you walk into a relationship very quickly
S0046	yeah
S0084	there's no actual foundation there because you've only know her for two months
S0041	mm
S0084	can you really after everything that's happen the emotional rollercoaster that it's be can you really keep a friendship go what be there to
S0046	i i personally at the moment
S0084	keep keep you friends
S0046	if if if she say that she doesn't see any way back then i just wanna cut all tie completely
S0041	why be you even give her the choice
S0084	well i don't think yeah don't put it in her court where's er on the table
S0041	yeah like why why be you give her the choice if she want to turn back i think you you ought to decide what you want
S0084	you need to think about your priorities cos if by put her in the position of power you're put your
S0041	yeah
S0084	heart on the line
S0046	pff my heart's already there though that's the trouble
S0084	well then you've gotta be careful then haven't you cos um

S0046	that's what i'd have do
S0084	i be just walk round my room

S0041	uh
S0084	it's really strange so um and my mum it's my mum's birthday this saturday and she want to go out with some of her friends and um er quite nervous about it because again i don't know those people i know one or two of them and my uncle's gonna be there it's my mum and so it's fine but i'm already a bite twitchy about it
S0046	just keep that in your head
S0041	yeah
S0046	that it's your mum just pretend that you're just
S0084	yeah
S0046	go out with your mum
S0084	yeah and i'll
S0041	yeah
S0084	have to go because the more the thing be the more you leave it
S0041	where's this come from
S0084	i don't know i don't know where it's come from
S0046	do anyone put you down about anything at all knock you down
S0084	huh
S0046	knock your confidence
S0084	tut i think because i don't do it i don't take myself out of my comfort zone anymore i use to go out i use to
S0041	yeah
S0084	go out all the time and i don't do it now and i er all i do be i come home and i have a drink with you lot or
S0046	and veg out
S0046	yeah
S0084	chill out and it's really easy and it's i've become really comfortable and a few weeks ago when i have to go out for my work's do i be really on edge
S0046	yeah
S0084	and i didn't like it and i be with my friend rachel rachel who i get on with really well but i be leave all of the conversations to her
S0041	yeah
S0084	so i be like her shadow
S0046	mm
S0084	basically
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	and i be like god you're so bore like why don't you start a conversation with people everyone's look at you like you're an idiot
S0041	but when you're in that position
S0084	mm
S0041	you can't make yourself
S0084	no
S0041	have a conversation whereas usually you'd be the
S0046	yeah
S0041	chatterbox
S0084	it be really and the more i think about it the more i be like i just wanna get out of here i feel like everyone's star at me
S0041	yeah
S0046	yeah
S0084	and i didn't like it and obviously we leave at like midnight or something
S0041	feel really uncomfortable don't you
S0084	yeah i just felt like you're a massive twat like no one like you here what be you do now more interest thing to say to anybody and once you're in that mindset you just can't
S0041	screw yep
S0084	and so then then it be 's birthday last week and i be like i don't really it be late anyway wasn't it she want me to go out like
S0041	yeah
S0084	ten o'clock
S0041	yeah
S0084	and the more i think about it the more i think i don't wanna go out and be around people actually i don't really want to go
S0046	well it be just for a drink wasn't it
S0084	yeah cos they go out for dinner and it would've be go out really late so um
S0046	and go out just for a drink be hardly worth it be it
S0084	yeah so it's just it's sort of be build for a little while and i guess i've always have that i've always have that i'm not the person in a crowd to er start conversation
S0041	mm
S0084	or i feel a bite on edge like i'm probably now the most confident that i've ever be but but i still feel nervous in social
S0041	mm
S0084	situations so i don't know if it's just
S0046	you need a night out in a semi lively pub i think not not like regal lively i think just a late night
S0041	i think you just need to
S0084	i think i just
S0041	force yourself to go out that's the thing
S0084	er yeah
S0041	cos it's all in your head it's not in real life
S0084	it's all in my head i think i just need to go out with people that i trust
S0041	yeah
S0084	people that i know that you know aren't gonna judge me not people that i don't know very well
S0041	yeah
S0084	even though those people probably aren't judge you
S0046	what be they judge you on that's what i don't get
S0084	well in my head i just think
S0046	there's nothing wrong with you
S0084	i just think god you're really you sound really bore or you're really uninteresting
S0041	yeah
S0084	or you look a state
S0041	when i come back from abroad go through a hell of a time with me cos i come back go crazy for a couple of months
S0084	mm
S0041	and then i get an exact same thing i wouldn't go anywhere and she be like what be you talk about like i be usually the person make everybody else go out
S0084	mm
S0041	and i just didn't go out for so long but then i felt like i be really old when i be go out cos the place that we
S0084	mm
S0041	use to go er cos all my friends
S0046	they've all change
S0041	have graduate
S0084	mm
S0041	so just and i and people that i just felt really old against and especially cos have a really tough time with me when i come back cos i be such a knob to her because i'd grow so much apart from her
S0084	mm
S0041	cos i'd live abroad for the year
S0084	mm
S0041	that i think i be just a bite up my own arse to be fair and but in my head i be like that when i be out
S0084	mm
S0041	i leave all the talk to her
S0084	mm
S0041	all the time and whereas usually we'd be bounce off each other or she'd be in my shadow more than anything else
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos we er we know different friends so it be always a really good night for the pair of us to go out
S0084	yeah
S0041	and i think maybe ah i know what happen we go out maybe three or four time and i be panic attack it up
S0084	right
S0041	i be fine
S0084	mm
S0041	until we get in the club we pay the money i'd have a couple of drink
S0084	mhm
S0041	so the night's in full swing then i panic
S0084	mm
S0041	so i fuck ruin everybody's night because everyone's already out already in the club
S0084	mm
S0041	and then it be that kind of point where you're not quite drink yet
S0084	yeah
S0041	and you're that concern you can't get to drink
S0046	yeah
S0084	mm and keep yourself on edge
S0041	so then everybody else be more drink than you be
S0084	yeah
S0041	then you're even more on edge the people look at you
S0046	yeah
S0084	mhm
S0041	and that you're stand out like a sore thumb
S0046	that's why i come home early the other night
S0041	stand round with you know with your arm cross
S0084	mm
S0041	when you're not really try to do that but then you're really awkward
S0084	mhm
S0041	and the only reason it stop be because my friend come back to uni she have a lot of time off er with depression and anxiety she come back and we be out maybe the fourth or fifth time we be out come with us and she have a panic attack
S0084	mm
S0041	and i just snap out of it cos i have to look after her
S0046	yeah
S0084	mm
S0041	and then after that it just go away completely i never saw it again
S0084	it be i think about take you out of your comfort zone you know that and er and make yourself do things you know this be the first time for a long time where i've just be in a bite of a rut i don't think it's a bad thing i just think i've get my job i'm very settle i'm quite
S0041	yeah
S0084	settle in the house i'm quite like er just come home and chill out and i don't really do much at the weekend and that's quite how i like it i don't really go into town now i don't get really dress up and so now now for the this be the first time in age i've have like three or four occasion where i've have to er get really dress up and i think oh i i don't know how to do it i don't i don't want to do it i don't like it and in actual fact
S0046	but you're
S0084	if i do it more
S0046	you're mature as a person though that's that's the thing you
S0084	mm
S0046	you need to you need to find your comfort zone as a mature adult
S0084	well that's what i think i'd do you know the as i say er i think this be the most confident i've ever felt with how i look and the kind of person that i be i'm happy generally speak but at the same time when i'm with other people you can't help but compare yourself and that's really seem to be exacerbate when i'm out
S0046	mm
S0084	and i don't know what it whether you know whether i'm just feel my age
S0041	mm
S0084	or what or whether like maybe it's the environment that i'm in at the moment i dunno like
S0046	it's weird
S0084	be a bite of a strange
S0041	yeah we've say this before haven't we
S0084	place if you're this age yeah
S0046	it do seem a bite too youthful doesn't it
S0041	well there's just a massive gap isn't there there's just a massive gap in the middle
S0084	yeah cos you've students who be young or you've get the settle couple
S0046	mm
S0084	in their thirties
S0041	yeah
S0084	go to the pub you know that's all very nice but what happen when you're in your twenties
S0041	yeah what happen then
S0046	yeah
S0084	everyone move away
S0046	yeah cos there's not like there's pubs and well there's pubs but there's not really club be there er for people our age to go to
S0084	no that's why i be look forward to salon rouge
S0046	yeah
S0084	cos it's suppose to be
S0046	yeah but then it's which kind of just scream out kid as far as i'm concern it always have do
S0084	that night isn't though
S0041	yeah
S0046	mm
S0041	it's not
S0084	but um but it there's nothing around it you couldn't go to a few bar beforehand even if you weren't dress up like a maniac
S0046	well you've get
S0046	cocktail bar
S0084	oh yeah that's true whenever i go in there it's always dead
S0041	yeah
S0084	but i must go er there at the wrong time
S0041	i've only be in there when it's dead
S0046	yeah you you need to go in there about half ten eleven o'clock for it to to feel it but if you go in there with a few people you you make the night

S0041	and it only show you the rat ness mess thing so it show you where they live
S0084	mm
S0041	and their little common area and their bunk right fuck bunk
S0046	yeah literally
S0084	of course
S0041	right and then
S0084	but they're not but they're not gonna be very big be they
S0041	and yeah one of them's say oh and these ones you can even sit up if you want you can even sit up as if that be a plus
S0084	mm
S0041	i be like what the fuck
S0041	and then they show you the captain's deck and he get his own bath and i think i've get my own bath
S0084	mm
S0041	so i don't know what i get cos none of them show the officer's er cabin
S0084	er well at least you know it's gonna be better than that
S0041	maybe not
S0084	i mean you might have fewer people to a room but you might have to share a room
S0046	you'll just have an extra inch head and leg room you know you're business class technically
S0041	i'm more er do you think i'm not gonna get a bath
S0046	you won't get a bath
S0084	you're not gonna get a you're not gonna get a bath
S0046	no way
S0041	you don't think
S0046	hell no
S0084	the the captain might have a bath but that'll be it
S0041	do you think he'd let me use it
S0084	no
S0046	not until you start sleep with him
S0084	it'll and you'll be like you'll probably be like court martialled for er ask
S0041	tut oh
S0084	but that's
S0046	you might get lucky though you might you might get a jacuzzi
S0041	yes
S0046	they might have one
S0084	only if you fart in the shower
S0046	mm
S0084	er
S0041	maybe for if the if the captain really like me then he might share
S0084	yeah but er in that in that regard i think um
S0046	it depend what you do for the captain if you save his life then i'm sure he
S0041	yeah
S0046	will let you have a bath
S0084	sexual favour
S0041	let's make him choke and i'll give him the heimlich
S0041	and just not tell him it be a set up
S0084	nice
S0041	yeah that's fair they do have a bar on board though
S0046	yeah
S0084	good
S0041	obviously essentials i think they limit you to like two drink a day though two alcoholic drink a day
S0084	mm
S0041	er
S0084	that's why they all go wild when they've get shore leave
S0041	yep
S0046	that's where you wanna get er yourself a yard glass
S0041	they all go fuck nut
S0046	fill it up
S0041	that big white thing from there
S0046	yeah
S0041	yeah so i'm a bite concern about the whole space age situ however i think they may have know that i've be arrive
S0084	right yep
S0041	because i've spend my time complain about their uniform and they've be redo
S0084	right so what do they look like now
S0041	they're now a bite more combatty like before it be like a shirt and trousers
S0084	mm
S0041	a little bite like what i wear to work now actually
S0084	oh okay
S0041	but with the things on the lapels to tell you what
S0084	mm
S0041	thing you're in
S0084	mm
S0041	now it look like a jumpsuit it's not cos it's shirt and like combat type trousers that have get like cut there that for the pocket
S0084	mm
S0041	big black heavy duty belt um navy shirt with the the square here that say the
S0084	mm
S0041	like that have the ring on it to say if you're an officer or not they're all navy then this bite on the side say which ship that you belong to and like a beret navy beret that's better than that stupid sailor hat
S0084	yeah mm probably don't have to wear that all the time do you
S0041	er the no that's just on your on ship outfit
S0084	do you have to wear the beret
S0041	no not the hat
S0084	mm
S0041	just the rest of it
S0084	yeah
S0041	but it look quite like an industrial type jumpsuit which i'm quite happy with
S0084	that's hot
S0041	with a nice waist belt go on so
S0084	yeah can you wear heel
S0041	i don't know i be think if i buy a pair of sensible ones i saw some ones i really want from carvela
S0084	nice
S0041	and they be in the sale for fifty five pound i think they might be allow
S0084	they're probably fine
S0041	they be patent but they're very smart they'd go with the black belt
S0084	well it's not me you've gotta convince love
S0041	yeah
S0046	yeah
S0084	apart from that
S0041	i think they're gonna make me wear the navy boot to be fair
S0084	mm
S0046	they will they will
S0084	maybe you could add a wedge to the boot
S0041	mm
S0046	they'd all have to be cap as well
S0041	huh some people be so selfish
S0046	they'd all er have to be cap cos no one in the force doesn't wear cap
S0041	fff
S0046	no one even people that sit at a desk their boot be cap
S0084	cos if war come you wanna have your toe protect
S0046	oh yes
S0041	oh no if war come i'll be like no hang on i'm just get my shoe off
S0041	i don't want them er to get ruin
S0046	mind you in all fairness war never come to us we go to the war
S0041	yeah that's true
S0084	yeah but that still mean you will be in a war
S0046	yeah but you will have time to prepare
S0084	oh i dunno
S0046	you will have time to get your nail do and your hair do and
S0041	huh
S0046	yeah nail
S0041	do they make me use their shampoo
S0046	probably
S0084	no surely not
S0041	i think i'm gonna have to ask these things and i mean i know it sound superficial but can you imagine the amount of bleach in my hair and they make me use their bog standard shitty shampoo my hair'll fall out
S0084	mm yeah right well i think he might laugh in your face if you ask him that on friday but fine
S0041	do you think
S0084	give it a go
S0046	but you wanna be unfeminine about it
S0041	i've get bleach blonde hair and i go on the sunbed i think he's probably gonna have a good guess
S0046	yeah i know but you're join the navy love
S0041	you see i disagree with this i think it's okay to be feminine in the navy cos half of them be gonna be gay boys anyway
S0084	i er think femininity's fine
S0041	i think so
S0046	yeah
S0084	you be a woman
S0041	as long as i don't complain too much you know that's gonna be my issue isn't it
S0084	i think you've you've er gotta give a hundred percent just as a man would
S0041	yeah
S0084	but there be gonna be differences
S0046	have you get over your spider
S0041	no
S0046	phobia yet you need to you need to do that
S0041	i'm in a ship full of men one of them's not gonna be scar of spiders
S0084	yeah but the problem be if you're in a room full of rat and you freak out about a spider
S0041	huh
S0084	you'll probably
S0046	yeah
S0084	it's probably not a good move be it like
S0041	mm
S0046	you need to get over your fear
S0084	you're gonna just have to just gonna have to leave the room
S0041	yeah
S0084	and try not to scream
S0041	yeah
S0046	just just youtube spiders
S0041	no
S0046	you don't need
S0041	can't even look at them on a screen no
S0046	um seriously do it i would just to get over my fear any if if i if i get over my fear i'd i'd probably youtube something if i have a fear
S0084	you don't have a fear
S0046	i have a fear of vertical drop
S0084	don't watch mission impossible ghost protocol then fuck me
S0041	be it bad
S0084	they they scale the tallest build in dubai which be the hotel
S0046	yeah
S0084	and he er be run up and down it like a monkey with these ridiculous gloves obviously that don't exist that make you stick to build
S0046	yeah
S0041	huh i'd love some of those
S0084	and one of the gloves fall off and you see him hang by one hand on the tallest build and presumably some poor cameraman
S0084	be actually hang out of the side of the build it's so tall and load of people who come out of the cinema say that they'd get vertigo because you're look down from this great height so some poor cameraman be obviously out there
S0046	you see there's there's a in vertigo there's a there's a there's a fine line between vertigo and be afraid of heights i think
S0084	be it not the same thing
S0046	well i'm not afraid of heights
S0041	no cos i'm scar of heights but i don't get vertigo
S0084	really
S0041	yeah cos like i mean it's when you go dizzy isn't it
S0084	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0041	whereas i'm scar of heights if i look down there i'll be like fuck me that be fuck massive
S0084	yeah
S0041	but it doesn't make me dizzy
S0084	oh okay
S0046	yeah
S0041	mm
S0046	you see i i i i can look out i can look down
S0084	mm
S0046	i can look directly down only if there's something that i can hold onto
S0084	mm
S0046	if there's nothing there there be no way that you be get me stand on that edge and look directly down there be no way
S0084	mm
S0046	cos i will shit myself
S0084	so bungee jump be out
S0046	oh yeah yep
S0041	i think it's something to do with your balance isn't it well i i don't know but my mum get vertigo after the brain tumour
S0084	tut yeah
S0041	because her balance be really affect so she doesn't have to be very high so she can be walk downstairs
S0084	tut oh god
S0041	and get it
S0084	yeah
S0041	yeah which isn't very
S0084	it's her centre of gravity isn't it
S0041	yeah i don't really know how
S0084	mm
S0041	but yeah that's a bite weird
S0084	curiouser and curiouser
S0041	if it maybe it's the same thing
S0046	cos i i i even get shit scar on a scaffold you know when i'm walk along a scaffold and say my foot slip a little bite down a scaffold board
S0084	mm
S0046	and i go on a wobble that scar the life out of me
S0084	mm
S0046	regardless of how high i be you know i may only be
S0041	it scar everyone though it's that feel isn't it when your heart
S0046	yeah
S0041	really go
S0084	yeah
S0046	it's a fall feel you know i i i've have that quite a lot
S0084	mm
S0046	even in dream
S0084	yeah
S0046	you know i hate that
S0041	do you know they say if you hit the floor you're dead do you know that
S0046	er
S0041	no in real life in your dream
S0046	what happen when you wake up
S0041	no that's why you wake up
S0046	i think that be because you hit the floor
S0041	it's er it's the same type of thing as a heart attack your heart react in the same way as a heart attack
S0084	right
S0041	so when you're asleep and you're dream that you're fall
S0084	mm
S0041	the way your heart react be like it would for a heart attack the your body wake itself up but if you don't wake up and you actually would ever hit the bottom you'd be dead
S0084	oh right
S0041	yeah you'd actually have a heart attack
S0046	i'm have a dream tonight
S0041	yeah can't remember where i hear that from i don't think it's a lie cos i remember a couple of people say it to me
S0046	in all
S0041	unless they've all be lie
S0046	in all fairness it do sound kinda true
S0084	hm
S0041	i mean i be quite gullible so maybe it be a lie but
S0046	but you can wake up and your heart like you can just feel it race can't you
S0041	yeah
S0046	so you you can imagine it be quite true
S0041	might've be have but definitely might've be have
S0084	sound like it could be plausible
S0041	mm

S0084	he be young
S0041	yeah
S0084	you must've get a motherly look about you
S0041	oh god
S0041	oh jesus
S0041	that's bad ain't it but the thing be i always think with these people it doesn't matter how much you talk to them or how many picture they've get on there you never truly know what what they look like
S0084	no
S0041	never
S0084	no no no no
S0041	that's what i hate actually be that the only thing you're go on on these things be like the physical attraction of someone
S0084	mm
S0041	cos you don't get to really know them from a few message
S0084	no
S0041	like i think matt be a bite of a anomaly now
S0084	mm
S0041	what you be say to me then i completely get
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	whereas as at the time i be like no that's that's definitely him
S0084	mm
S0041	whereas now i completely see what you mean
S0084	mm
S0041	like you just haven't get a a chance at all gauge that with someone but you can't rely on the photograph any either
S0084	it's just a risk just gotta suck it up and if you think that the banter's there and you think that they might be attractive meet them for a drink
S0041	yeah
S0084	and worst case scenario you don't meet them for a second
S0041	do a runner
S0084	that you do a runner in the toilets
S0041	yeah
S0084	through the window
S0041	out of the toilet window yeah i've never do that before i'd quite like to do that
S0084	i would quite like to do that
S0041	in my life
S0084	but i think i would be i'd feel really sorry for the person leave behind
S0041	yeah
S0084	cos imagine be that be you
S0041	huh
S0084	and they just never come back from the toilet
S0084	you would probably kill yourself
S0041	yeah but i think i think this be why we need to stop the twenty youngs because i don't think they take criticism very well
S0084	well they're children
S0041	yeah
S0084	this be their first foray into romance cos they're children
S0041	they don't take the criticism very well

S0041	fuck
S0084	two and a half years
S0041	fuck
S0084	i be just like you i couldn't understand i couldn't i couldn't comprehend this guy who start off be really sweet and nice and lovely be tell me that he'd be in prison or two and a half years
S0041	two and a half years
S0084	and i be like do you kill someone and he say no but i think i do um he be do some job for some dodgy guy drive this guy's range rover late at night drive a guy somewhere i don't know where in the villages and he go he be go over a roundabout didn't see that there be three drunkards on the roundabout clip one of them there be something wrong with the car or something and he be just try to make it home and then as he veer cos he'd hit somebody then hit somebody on the verge when he come out so he hit two people but the second person that he hit he really hit and he and he think he'd kill them because it have it have make that much of a
S0041	a bang
S0084	um a noise or er hit the car so hard or whatever there be a guy in the car with him and he be just like fuck fuck fuck what do i do and the guy be just like well just drive just go
S0041	no he leave them
S0084	so he leave the person there
S0041	shit
S0084	think oh i've kill them drive off um go to the club if this person that be he be er this be a doorman or something he have to go to er the this guy's club and tell him it be the guy's car the guy who own the club all fuck shady the guy be like yeah torch the car it's like something out of some sort of film he be tell me this stuff
S0041	torch the car
S0084	and i be like what the fuck it get worse so they torch the car and then he go back er the guy come round and see and say to be you alright like what we gonna do and be like i don't know i don't know what to do i don't know what to do the guy who own the club or own the car be like that guy saw everything the guy he be give a lift to shall we kill him
S0041	huh
S0084	say to let's kill him
S0041	be you be serious
S0084	yeah
S0041	holy fuck shit
S0084	i dunno why i'm it's er obviously at the time
S0041	how can you not how do you
S0084	at the time i be in the pub i be drive and that's why i say to him just stop tell me this because i'm drive and it's really freak me out so just stop it but the thing be at the same time like he's cry so you've get this unbelievable news you're try to like not crash the car yourself and also not show too much shock because he's really devastate but i be just like oh my god oh my god i
S0041	do they kill him
S0084	no they didn't kill the guy he didn't kill the guy that he hit er that he hit
S0041	and they didn't kill the passenger
S0084	no that be the point when be like this be er fuck ridiculous and he go to the police and hand himself in and er he tell them what he'd do where it have happen that he'd torch the car um and they say well you're guilty of reckless drive and they arrest him and then er then they find him guilty and he be sentence to two and a half years in prison or he er for like five years in prison or something
S0041	jeez
S0084	and then get out after two and a half years
S0041	do you know the worst thing be have he have stop and help that guy
S0084	mm
S0041	he wouldn't have get tell off for it
S0084	mm yeah probably i mean er the thing be it's i don't know what the law be you know if you if you're er
S0041	unless they could've prove he'd er drink
S0084	convict of reckless yeah
S0041	then he can't get do for reckless drive
S0084	mm
S0041	the only way you can get do for reckless drive be if they know that over an extend period of drive either you know you be veer all over the road you be er er beyond the speed limit
S0084	mm
S0041	you go through light it have to be really specific things
S0084	mm
S0041	whereas if you just drive and lapse of judgement and hit someone
S0084	mm
S0041	you can't get do for it
S0084	really
S0041	you might get a fine and that's it even if you're even if you kill someone
S0084	mm
S0041	if you be pull out of a driveway and knock someone dead
S0084	mm
S0041	you can't get do for reckless drive
S0084	god well the thing be er obviously anybody else would stop but obviously er he panic
S0041	panic yeah
S0084	er didn't know what to do the guy obviously just say just drive if he'd be er
S0041	and
S0084	on his own i think he probably would've stop
S0041	yeah
S0084	cos he wouldn't have know what else to do
S0041	someone else say do this you just do it you wouldn't even think
S0084	or but er yeah er that sort of situation particularly with him he be just like what er i just need he just need someone to tell him what to do and unfortunately that be the wrong advice so even though he he go and hand himself in it wasn't enough so he say when he be in prison he be in prison in or something which be in norfolk it's on the way to norwich it's in the middle of nowhere apparently it's where all the paedophiles go
S0041	huh
S0084	he be on a wing with paedophiles yeah and that house that he's live in be some sort of um halfway house or something i don't really er he say it's not a halfway house as if i should know what that mean
S0041	what something they've help him with or something
S0084	yeah
S0041	i don't yeah
S0084	it's like a sort of they come round and check on you which be why when i when he tell me that he couldn't have his kid round i say that's fuck ridiculous like
S0041	oh
S0084	um er what landlord would say you can't have kid round and er now i realize why because they're all ex con
S0041	frig
S0084	and when he come out of prison the first like originally he be live with paedophiles and he cos we be have a really long conversation about it and i be say oh er you know like they've they've do medical study very recently and they've find that er it's not a choice it's like a sexual attraction
S0041	yeah
S0084	like er it would be for a man or a woman or
S0041	yeah
S0084	man and man it's um er er a man on female for a child it's sick and it's wrong but it's something that they have to fight against all the time
S0041	yeah
S0084	i'm not say you know
S0041	that's like us
S0084	feel sorry for them but
S0041	that's like someone say to us you can't have sex with a man
S0084	mm
S0041	you're only allow to have sex with women
S0084	mm
S0041	only ever
S0084	exactly and er er obviously of er course the paedophiles that he have meet be all predatory and they be all er oh well i do this oh well i do that like they the not many of them seem to be particularly sorry for what they've do and so that's obviously really taint his opinion on people because those be the type of people that he's meet
S0041	huh like two and a half years man
S0084	such a long time of your life if you think that his youngest child be like six or seven so that's two and a half years that you miss of your children's life
S0041	be that why he break up with his wife then his girlfriend whatever
S0084	no they no that be on the card for a long time apparently i think it must like cos he say he get out about two years ago and he be in for two and a half years so basically he and the missus like have a they think they be gonna get back together shag he find out she be pregnant he leave or they'd break up and then she say oh i'm pregnant and he didn't go back so they be never together when their last child be bear and then all this happen about a year or so later
S0041	wowsers
S0084	but like obviously he be tell me he be finish off the story when we be in the pub and he's like er i'm really surprise you're still here and i be just er it's just so much information for me to process
S0041	yeah
S0084	so much information and the thing be you can only make allowance for a person if you think that they've learn from their situation or er you that they truly regret it
S0041	yeah
S0084	and he and he obviously do and you've get to make allowance for the type of person that he be
S0041	yeah i mean er
S0084	but it's still i mean er he didn't kill somebody but he do flee the scene there be someone lie there potentially dead
S0041	yeah
S0084	and he just leave them
S0041	i er mm it's so difficult cos until you're in that situation you don't know how you would react
S0084	absolutely
S0041	it's that fight or flight thing isn't it
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	that you wouldn't probably get a choice
S0084	no it's really hard um
S0041	like i'd say there's no way i could drive away from that
S0084	yeah
S0041	no matter how much trouble i would get in
S0084	yeah
S0041	but you never know
S0084	you don't know until you're in it particularly if you if you're really freak out and someone's say just go just go
S0041	yeah
S0084	i don't know
S0041	especially cos he's get a screw loose anyway
S0084	mm
S0041	in the nicest possible way
S0084	or or or five
S0041	you know what i mean jesus
S0084	it's really
S0041	i can't
S0084	really hard
S0041	can you imagine how awful that must have be
S0084	mm
S0041	in prison for that amount of time
S0084	yeah
S0041	with those weirdos
S0084	awful really really really awful and he say he that er he really try hard and he be some sort of bully monitor so if there be bully go on then he be he'd get involve or something so he obviously be like the model inmate which be why they let him so in the grand scheme of things quite quickly but when he be say he be put in prison for reckless drive i think he be gonna say three months
S0041	yeah
S0084	two and a half years which er must be
S0041	the guy that knock my dad off and nearly kill him
S0084	mm
S0041	nada
S0084	really shit
S0041	like we be tell he be gonna die like three time
S0084	yeah
S0041	nada he get a fine of about two grand i think
S0084	shit
S0041	that's what i be say to you because he wasn't on the road yet
S0084	mm
S0041	well he be but
S0084	mm
S0041	he be only pull out of the drive
S0084	mm
S0041	nada
S0084	tut
S0041	that's what i mean so i find it very i think he be probably really deal
S0084	he must've be er
S0041	a bad hand there
S0084	yeah
S0041	because usually they need proof that it's a prolong
S0084	well i think he must've be in trouble before if he'd do something before
S0041	ah
S0084	they would probably put you in prison
S0041	yeah maybe
S0084	er he say he'd have a colourful past when he be a child
S0041	yeah
S0084	when he be like a teenager so
S0041	you're talk like break and enter or something or
S0084	he must've do something or like
S0041	petty drug or something
S0084	yeah rob a car or something joyride he must've do something
S0041	yeah
S0084	because for your first offence for them to give you two and a half years in prison
S0041	so that's why the guy that live next door smoke the legal high stuff
S0084	mm
S0041	cos he can't he won't be able to get catch
S0084	yeah
S0041	with pot in the house
S0084	yeah the all of those house turn out be halfway house
S0041	where be this then
S0084	do he be you there when he say that the other the guy who'd take it be hospitalize
S0041	no
S0084	an ambulance be turn up for him
S0041	huh
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	shit
S0084	yeah
S0041	they be say actually on the news that the legal highs be more lethal
S0084	yeah they're more dangerous cos they're not regulate
S0041	yep
S0084	because they're see to be legal
S0041	yep which really
S0041	fricking hell
S0084	it's like they're in the room
S0041	yeah um which really be true like i've always i've always maintain this weed's a plant
S0084	mm
S0041	like it be a it be a plant
S0084	mm
S0041	it be actually grass it's a weed
S0084	yeah
S0041	there's at least there's no additive to it
S0084	mm
S0041	there's no extra crap
S0084	yeah
S0041	they're not cut it with rat poison
S0084	no absolutely
S0041	well some people thicken it up with wd40 don't they but
S0084	urgh
S0041	you wouldn't trust those bastards but it's it's
S0084	but essentially it's not chemical
S0041	okay for no but it's
S0084	in the sense that pills be
S0041	legal for us to have chemical alcohol
S0084	yeah
S0041	yeah
S0084	some nice
S0041	that make entire sense
S0084	nice taxable drug
S0041	yeah can't believe that frigging hell
S0084	i know i know and i
S0041	i have to close that door they're drive me nut
S0084	well i might er put the kettle on and get guinness cake if you
S0041	huh
S0084	if i can tempt you
S0041	guinness cake
S0084	here
S0041	oh it's so wild man
S0084	so mad it's unnecessary what be i sit on
S0041	huh

S0084	yep yep
S0041	i've be put music onto here to use this to put on the ipod
S0084	oh yeah
S0041	on yep huh
S0084	mm mm mm
S0041	i don't think the days of all the cake i have on friday have er do i tell you on friday at work i have three slice of cake
S0084	nice
S0041	mm
S0084	oh yeah cos it be 's leave thing wasn't it
S0041	mm
S0084	be his name okay good you look at me like
S0084	who the fuck's
S0041	no i look at you like holy crapper this be great
S0084	oh do you like it
S0041	mm
S0084	oh thank love what i'll do next time be use slightly less flour
S0041	do you make this on the top
S0084	yeah it's cream cheese ice sugar and double cream
S0041	oh they're all my favourite things
S0084	all of the good things
S0041	all of the good things
S0084	er it need slightly less time in the oven but it do say forty five minutes to an hour and i take it out after forty three minutes so er next time
S0041	to be precise
S0084	yeah forty three minutes next time i'll do thirty five forty minutes um
S0041	i would like to be a baker
S0084	it's surprisingly easy i mean
S0041	mm
S0084	just gotta shove everything in a pan
S0084	i don't know if that be the answer
S0041	i mean when i i witness the make of this it do look quite stressful
S0084	i think that's because it be first thing in the morning and i be
S0084	go what what what it cos the instructions aren't clear and they didn't tell me to fold the flour in for a start mum be like yeah you've gotta fold in the flour er
S0041	what's that what's fold in
S0084	oh you like not whisk it in because then you get lump which be what happen to me and they be like yeah and then add the flour fine in go the flour because you've gotta fold it because the flour thicken the the mixture make it
S0041	mm
S0084	stick but it also make it lumpy you know like if you make a roux if you make a white sauce
S0041	mm
S0084	you've get to make sure it's the right quantity of flour you add it slowly otherwise it go lumpy and once it's lumpy you're fuck
S0041	fuck it
S0084	yeah it's the same idea so in bake you've gotta fold it in apparently
S0041	well
S0084	but fine
S0041	this be another prime example of the bakers not tell us what to do properly
S0084	bakers assume too much knowledge don't assume assume ignorance
S0041	please um
S0084	so yes um re the situ er
S0041	god
S0084	it be all a bite weird i mean he be really emotional about the whole thing and he be you know er
S0041	i don't suppose he's tell many people
S0084	he hasn't really no and he be like er you know i understand if you don't wanna be my friend but you know i want you to to know the real me and this er this be me warts and all because er er i don't tell people i don't know how to tell people and you know i i didn't know when to tell you and i say well but now be probably the
S0041	i bet he's be really worry about tell you you know
S0084	well probably you know he's he be like i didn't obviously i'm not gonna tell you right at the begin cos you wouldn't say on your first date hi i'm and i've spend two and a half years in prison
S0041	yeah
S0084	because any girl's gonna go
S0041	no
S0084	like that's interest goodbye
S0041	mm
S0084	it's only because i know him
S0041	yeah but not just that i mean even if it wasn't a prison thing even if it be a and i've have cancer
S0084	mm
S0041	or or my mum's a crazy person
S0084	mhm
S0041	even if it be something as little as that
S0084	mm
S0041	my mum be a crackers person
S0041	i don't speak to her because she need section
S0084	yeah she make my life hell
S0041	you just things like that you don't say initially cos you don't know if you're gonna like that person or be close enough to them ever
S0084	mm
S0041	for that ever to come up
S0084	mm and that's it it's really personal
S0041	jeebus
S0084	so um so yeah so obviously you will deny all knowledge
S0041	oh yeah i haven't get a clue
S0084	yeah but um
S0041	who
S0084	yeah who
S0041	i only know
S0084	mm
S0041	mm so what be you gonna do about this situ what i actually think you be gonna tell me be confession of undying love
S0041	that be my initial think
S0084	no i think he do love me
S0041	do you think
S0084	mm
S0041	mm
S0084	but then because he doesn't he's he's really sweet and really affectionate and really nice he say really lovely things and he texts me all the time
S0041	mm
S0084	which be nice
S0041	really
S0084	yeah all the time i just never i never instigate any of it it's always from him which be quite nice
S0041	mm
S0084	but um but then like yesterday morning i be like oh i wanna have a shower do you wanna join me in the shower it'll be really nice and he say yeah yeah yeah actually no i can't be bother bye
S0084	like there be no quality control over what come out that boy's mouth
S0084	at all
S0084	i say er oh this be really nice
S0041	actually no i can't be bother
S0084	we be lie in bed and he be like i'm gonna go to the shop cos i'm gonna get you breakfast so he go and get croissants and fresh juice and he come back and he's he's really it's thoughtful he's really nice
S0041	please tell me there's chocolate in here and i'm not go crazy
S0084	no there be chocolate in here yeah
S0041	okay
S0084	guinness and chocolate all of the good things so yeah but it's er he's
S0041	mm
S0084	not a potential boyfriend
S0041	mm mm
S0084	because he's a complete nightmare
S0041	mhm
S0084	but he's he be interest to have around but
S0041	yeah he's a nice person
S0084	i think that's the thing i think that's why i can er not overlook er you know i can acknowledge
S0041	mm
S0084	his past because
S0041	actually he's
S0084	it be a bad thing that happen to him it er mm
S0041	yeah
S0084	i think
S0041	it wasn't do with intent it wasn't like
S0084	no
S0041	he then continue the story to say yes i then
S0084	go and kill the guy
S0041	go and kill a man
S0084	i mean i didn't ask if he think about do it cos i didn't wanna know
S0041	mm
S0084	i mean he say that be
S0041	probably wise
S0084	yeah that be the point when he decide to hand himself in maybe that's because he didn't think shall i do it
S0041	mm yeah i wouldn't have ask
S0084	just don't need to know
S0041	yeah as well even if at that time he have ever consider it he'd be a different person after two and a half years in prison
S0084	mm
S0041	completely different think how much it change you when you go travel

S0041	for that length of time
S0084	mm i know
S0041	you must just see so many type of creep just low lifes
S0084	mm
S0041	and especially if you know he's be put in there for a bad decision
S0084	mm
S0041	they've be put in there because they intentionally do something
S0084	cos they're bad people
S0041	yeah

S0084	oh huh
S0041	yep just little things you know walk into club without pay
S0084	yeah well you've be do that quite recently haven't you
S0041	mm
S0084	have you be in vodka revolution recently
S0041	mm
S0084	yeah and not yeah not pay that's interest
S0041	not pay for taxis
S0084	well
S0041	hand in coursework late after deadlines and not get penalize
S0084	really
S0041	mm like purposefully not do my work send it to my italian tutor in a format that i know she can't open so like windows or windows xp
S0084	mm
S0041	send it in word that she can't open
S0084	to get a bite more time
S0041	know it to buy me an extra week yep really bad
S0084	i suppose that's it if you've gotta send stuff from abroad
S0041	i owe the french government six hundred pound
S0084	good normal
S0041	can't fly back there for a while
S0084	yeah my friend's like that with greece
S0084	she didn't pay some sort of tax at the airport and she can't go back in the country
S0084	so that's so that's interest
S0041	mhm
S0084	she's not allow to go back to greece although why you'd wanna go to greece now the country's fuck
S0041	well yeah i be spend the french government's money when i be live in italy just take it out the cash machine
S0084	oh right
S0041	spend it cos they er give you when you er like register for be a student you give them your proof of your accommodation and because they don't have student loan they give you a percentage towards your rent
S0084	oh nice
S0041	so they'd give me a hundred euros a month to go towards my five hundred euro rent
S0084	mm
S0041	live here it doesn't seem so bad now but at the time live in hull go from two hundred and fifty a month to five hundred a month
S0084	mm
S0041	i be like what the fuck
S0084	mm
S0041	um so yeah when i go to italy and i have be honest with the french government in my defence
S0084	mm
S0041	i'd fill out all my paperwork to say i be only stay for six months they just keep pay it so i just keep spend it
S0084	oh that's funny that they er they give you money though you know you're there as a british citizen study at a british university
S0041	french university
S0084	yeah but you're be that not um just an exchange thing i mean you're technically a student of hull university
S0041	yeah but for that semester i'm not
S0084	oh er so you they be accountable for you
S0041	mm
S0084	for that year oh that's interest
S0041	like i have my student card from there still
S0084	oh okay
S0041	so like you enroll there and the english university give them money for my
S0084	mm
S0041	university fee so instead of it go to them
S0084	yeah
S0041	it go to france
S0084	oh okay
S0041	and theirs come to us but my if i get my transcript for my degree which by the way do you have to send off for that cos i definitely don't have one
S0084	you have to send off for it yeah because i only have one because i apply to do an ma
S0041	ah okay so i shouldn't already have one float around somewhere cos i have the certificate and that's all i have
S0084	mm no i don't well i don't i didn't have one until i apply but i wonder if they give it to you with your certificate because when you graduate you've be piss since six a m you have nothing
S0041	yeah
S0084	you give your certificate to your mum and dad because that's what they're there for
S0041	mm
S0084	or whoever responsible adult have be nominate but i don't remember ever
S0041	yeah
S0084	have a transcript i mean er do do something come through at the end i mean you get you get er
S0041	mm i don't know
S0084	a run total every year but it's not the same as a transcript
S0041	no i haven't get a clue but yeah if i if i have one of those i certainly don't have one um but mine would say for the third year the first half of it would be french university
S0084	oh okay
S0041	and the second half of it well it wouldn't be italian cos i didn't go should've be italian hence why i shouldn't really be on my course i don't think but
S0084	la la la
S0041	yeah they be just so crap at life that if i be enrol there or not they would never have know literally my friend do really er enrol there i didn't i pay to go to a private university instead so
S0084	mm
S0041	at least i can prove that i be there
S0084	okay
S0041	cos you only have to prove that you're there and study you don't have to
S0084	you don't have to send coursework or anything
S0041	pass the exams i send the coursework home to my uni
S0084	oh okay
S0041	so they set coursework and i have to send it back every few weeks
S0084	oh right
S0041	but as long as i can prove that i'm there that's the kind of prerequisite of the course
S0084	oh
S0041	you have to either have an employment contract and it have to be professional not bar work or you have to be enrol officially enrol in uni and turn up to at least i think sixty percent of your course
S0084	mm
S0041	there's no way of trace that though so they'll believe me
S0084	really
S0041	actually try his hardest
S0084	aw
S0041	to do it and i think it take him three months to get in to actually enrol
S0084	to get in to get in oh i see
S0041	like they know he be come
S0084	yeah
S0041	they have his name down on the list but every time he go to the office it be close they just close er close like your
S0084	italy's hilarious though isn't it
S0041	tutor open all the time
S0084	no
S0041	no one hour every other week
S0084	yeah it's like that here though isn't it my tutor be like that cos
S0041	mine wasn't
S0084	oh yeah ours be awful
S0041	this be the enrolment office though not your personal tutor
S0084	oh right
S0041	admissions office
S0084	oh no admissions office be always open
S0041	one hour every other week
S0084	fuck
S0041	and by the time you get there there be so many hundreds of students queue
S0084	no chance
S0041	no chance
S0084	i mean er our and our office be always busy because there's so many students you know you're hand in essay at different time of the year so it's always gonna be busy so yeah that be always open our tutor be off do whatever the hell they felt like
S0041	mm
S0084	you know write book or research i e pub um they be never there you have to book time with them and they be you know one day a week or one day a fortnight er it be a
S0041	i never saw mine you know
S0084	complete joke really really like mine
S0041	no
S0084	peter
S0041	so er in fact the only ever conversation i have with her be because she be also the french marker for the for set coursework that be send back while we be abroad
S0084	tut oh
S0041	and what happen be we get about five piece over over the year and they start off be two thousand word in english five hundred word french
S0084	mm
S0041	and then progressively get to the last one be three thousand word in the opposite language
S0084	oh okay
S0041	so no english
S0084	oh okay
S0041	so the english get shorter and the target language get bigger
S0084	mm
S0041	which didn't really make sense if you do more than one language cos then i arrive in italy and realize i'd get a thousand word to write and i'd be in the country three weeks
S0084	aw
S0041	thank very much lovely
S0041	but she i send her back my french one my first one and they have to send you back the mark and then obviously you can see where you go wrong from what they require for the next one
S0084	mm
S0041	to up your mark
S0084	mm
S0041	i get mine back the day before the second one be due in so what the fuck's good to me
S0084	mm
S0041	there's no read and improve on that oh well i've be away sick
S0084	good
S0041	mm like that's gonna help me with my degree
S0084	you don't really have a lot of luck do you
S0041	no
S0084	with admin folk of school establishments
S0041	nope
S0084	it turn out
S0041	i've always have er really bad luck with them
S0084	well it's probably that they be all cretins i mean we regularly use to get our coursework back with footprints on our on our work
S0041	what
S0084	no lie i've get at least two essay that come back with footprints on because i don't know what they do with them
S0084	they just throw them on the floor and just have a party hilarious or if you go in like when they bring in the new frank machine so that you could obviously date stamp your work so that you could prove that you hand it in on time
S0041	mm
S0084	and like before midday
S0041	i never have that
S0084	no well we we er uea's really strict it's quite high in the rank so er everything be very by the book and er they bring in the new frank system which no one could work but er completely ridiculous and really very hit and miss
S0084	in term of whether it punch anything punch your hand punch the work until you say can you show me no busy read the instructions the instructions be completely ridiculous they didn't make any sense at all they be just genuinely unhelpful so yeah the office be open nine to five but whether you could actually get any sort of
S0084	sense or support from anyone that work there
S0084	because they basically hat the students that's what's so
S0041	really
S0084	hilarious about people who work er in in education they actually hate the students 's work in education for about eight years hat students er actually physically hat them it's quite funny
S0041	oh no i remember she be my favourite must her name must've be
S0084	
S0041	could be she be the woman that work in our language office and um it be a run joke one minute to the like at the bang on o'clock like twelve o'clock when it be due they'd shut close the door and lock it
S0084	oh my god
S0041	so that you couldn't hand your work in
S0084	yeah
S0041	so therefore they know if it be late and it be time
S0084	yeah
S0041	and know i'd be the last person
S0041	belt down that corridor
S0041	from the from the computer room hold on it's print
