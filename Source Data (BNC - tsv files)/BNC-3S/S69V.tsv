S0269	have a positive response from all the statutory consultees
S0268	mm
S0269	so we phone up at conservation
S0268	mm
S0269	and say have have he give a positive response to ecotricity and say no i have not
S0268	mm
S0269	so we take that to the advertise standards authority and win
S0268	mm
S0269	and then of course he hit back at us when with one a mistake that have make on a photograph
S0266	but that didn't cost money do it
S0269	it didn't it it
S0266	it just cost reputation not money about the photograph i mean for the trade standards
S0269	no it didn't it didn't cost us any money it just divert us and take hundreds of hours to respond to it
S0266	mm
S0269	that be the issue
S0266	time
S0268	yeah it's a lot of it be time isn't it
S0269	yeah oh it's time
S0268	yeah
S0269	mm because he ask last night er about the total cost of the of the say save do it do it include the money that we'd put it we'd cost have we cost our time
S0266	oh i didn't hear that question
S0269	yeah oh yeah
S0268	he do yeah he do
S0269	do you remember
S0268	mm
S0269	do the twenty seven thousand pound include erm you know
S0266	well it would be
S0269	because you didn't
S0266	three hundred and twenty seven thousand pound if we have say them
S0268	it would be a bite more than twenty seven thousand that's for sure when you look at the amount of effort that put in and i put in
S0269	well it be it be hundreds and of hours
S0268	yeah
S0269	hundreds of hours
S0268	oh
S0266	and time off work i take off unpaid
S0269	that's right
S0266	to appear at the
S0269	yeah that's
S0266	hear other people be
S0269	yeah
S0266	probably the same
S0269	that's right
S0266	anyway would you like erm some sponge cake or some fruit cake which do you prefer
S0269	i'll have the sponge cake please
S0266	or do you want both
S0269	well i'll try the sponge cake to start with
S0266	okay
S0268	what be the choices
S0266	fruit and sponge
S0268	erm could i could i be awkward and have a little of both
S0266	yeah
S0269	a lidl
S0268	a lidl
S0269	oh i i i think you go to tesco
S0268	oh what be you know you know when it be all adjourn and they be up try to work out a time when they would be able to appear again
S0269	yeah
S0268	and that can be kick down the road for months wasn't it
S0269	yeah
S0268	wasn't it happen in january that and it be they be look for a date in may be it be that right
S0269	april the yeah they be try to get a date april may
S0268	yeah what be it what be that all about be it all about the noise
S0269	erm it be about the noise but there be various other issue that hasn't be finish off i think
S0268	be it because of what we find or and they didn't have the figure i can't can you remember that dear can you remember what that be about
S0266	er sorry i wasn't listen
S0268	when when you know there be a bite hiatus a er of about five months because there be there be an issue that hadn't be resolve
S0266	well one issue be that
S0266	the whole report have to be rewrite the initial planners do you remember that be a very early on erm thing they have to they have to stop the plan meet because the report have to be rewrite
S0268	yeah
S0266	's wasn't good enough
S0268	yeah
S0266	be that what you're not talk about that
S0269	no we're erm we're talk about the er plan appeal rather than the
S0268	oh
S0269	development control committee
S0268	mm
S0269	the the development control committee meet be put off
S0268	mm
S0269	it be schedule for a february
S0268	mm
S0269	and have refuse to provide additional information that have be request on noise
S0268	mm
S0269	and the day before the dcc meet he mysteriously pull a rabbit out of a hat and say here's the additional information and if you recall council er at the dcc meet the follow day pronounce himself totally satisfy with the information that have be provide by ecotricity and er query that
S0268	mm
S0269	and demand to know and that's when it be adjourn for a month then but that be the dcc meet rather than
S0268	but and then it be kick down the down down the road for five months wasn't it or something like that and i think that be a noise issue
S0269	yeah i think that would erm we're just talk about the dcc meet be defer then it go to plan appeal but there be a long gap between the dcc meet and the plan er appeal because ecotricity didn't register it in the the appeal until the very last minute
S0268	mm
S0269	they be allow six months and i think they submit it in month six
S0268	mm
S0269	and then erm i think that be about september and then they be try to get date for the er plan inspector and i think the meet start in january the next
S0268	mm
S0269	so there be eleven months from the first dcc meet
S0268	mm
S0269	erm and the the initial estimate be four days that be give by ecotricity's barrister
S0268	mm
S0269	that it would be four days erm so they be try to find date and then it become apparent on about day three or four that it be gonna take a lot longer than erm than four days
S0268	mm
S0269	and then they couldn't because of erm be involve in the other
S0268	another one yeah
S0269	down at they couldn't er get a day
S0268	mm
S0269	so there be another few months go er go by
S0268	the those be the tactics that they need to do
S0269	yeah and this be what i be try to get across to them last night because
S0268	but i i sort of take 's view that they be probably not as organise
S0269	no i don't think they be
S0268	with the the
S0269	but to be fair
S0268	the no the the erm the the er
S0269	both party
S0268	developers well both party could be
S0269	well yeah oh oh oh there's no doubt that the developers be not on the same league as
S0268	mm
S0269	ecotricity because this be probably the first or second one that they've do
S0268	yeah yeah exactly
S0269	i may be get the applications mix up but i think this company be only form erm two months before the
S0268	yeah
S0269	the thing surface
S0268	yeah
S0269	so they be not in the same league as ecotrocity
S0268	and they're not in the same league as you
S0269	well we start off know nothing to be fair
S0268	mm
S0269	when it drop through our letterbox in july twenty o nine it be phew what's this
S0268	mm
S0269	and nobody know about it
S0268	mm
S0269	apart from your next door neighbour
S0268	mm yeah
S0269	and the farmer
S0268	mm
S0269	erm so we start from a pretty low base
S0268	and that be all in two thousand and nine
S0269	that be two thousand and nine so very quickly we get ourselves organise
S0268	mm
S0269	and right fellas let's get as much information as as we can
S0268	mm
S0269	on everything
S0268	mm
S0269	on the company and
S0268	mm
S0269	what a wind turbine be and what it do and
S0268	mm
S0269	visuals and everything er and then we be er we start research ecotricity erm a on the account and b the relationships with people at and that's why we end up with in er march twenty ten i think that be
S0268	mm
S0269	erm
S0268	and you and go to see him didn't you
S0269	and i go to see him
S0268	oh right
S0269	and we have two rehearsals before we er go there and the catalyst for go to be the er monitor mast it wasn't the turbines it be the monitor mast
S0268	mm
S0269	and from our research it it how it all come about at this climate change panel
S0268	mm
S0269	so then we go down that route of the climate change panel of the cvs of all the
S0268	mm
S0269	people on the independent climate change panel
S0268	mm
S0269	who we have international national and local climate change experts
S0268	mm
S0269	but they forget to tell us that two of them be employ by ecotricity and two of them be school kid
S0268	mm
S0269	and another one be a guy who filter the muck out of chip shop fat
S0268	yeah
S0269	and run an old bus on it
S0268	and a vicar
S0269	and a vicar seek divine guidance
S0269	so that's when we go to see who profess not to know anything about it and i can now believe that he didn't know anything about erm and we complain to him about the very close relationship between two of his senior officer and
S0268	but last night they didn't seem to know anything about this cumulative thing on
S0269	that's right
S0268	shouldn't they how
S0266	i think they do know something about it
S0269	but he the the chairman
S0266	cos someone refer to it
S0269	the chairman
S0266	on the the chairman know
S0269	the chairman mention about what i don't
S0268	but the rest of them didn't seem to
S0266	but he mention
S0269	no
S0266	the word cumulative
S0269	that's right what i don't know be whether the letter from to the developers talk about the cumulative impact have come as a result of me go to and
S0268	well yeah
S0269	make representations to because initially have write to all the developers and say they weren't require
S0268	but my read of that and cos you show me the letter
S0269	yeah
S0268	be that they they will have to do an environmental impact assessment
S0269	well the body of the letter be
S0268	yeah
S0269	that everybody
S0268	involve
S0269	english heritage and natural england and archaeology and that yes it's gotta be do but 's conclusion be well it's not necessary but then subsequently a make the claim
S0269	say
S0268	yeah
S0269	about it's gonna be require because of the cumulative impact which be exactly the er the thing that i go to about
S0268	but the guy that erm er be just phone say that they when they go on that village hall meet the developers
S0269	yeah
S0268	they be absolutely adamant he say that they be not go to do an eia absolutely adamant
S0269	mm
S0268	but if they have to it's quite nice really cos it's
S0269	oh yeah
S0268	it's time and money
S0269	well that's right
S0266	but surely they've win if they have to do a eia then that's the end of the end of the
S0269	i would have think that er some of these tin pot developers be not gonna be in a position financially
S0268	they won't
S0269	or
S0268	well they won't know how to go about it
S0269	or technically to know how to do it
S0268	will they and when they realise that all these experts cost money that they
S0269	that's right
S0268	would get in to
S0269	mm
S0268	you know to do it
S0269	well the thing the thing that be i be try to get across last night be there be a small number of things that you ought to do one be everything you can to reduce the revenue stream
S0268	mm
S0269	less turbines less solar panel
S0268	mm
S0269	blah blah blah
S0268	yeah yeah
S0269	er the second thing that you do be put as much cost on them as you can
S0268	mm
S0269	and this be why we advertise for a heritage expert for save
S0268	and the noise i mean that must have
S0269	because they be
S0268	that must have put them back you know
S0269	well
S0268	forty fifty thousand pound those two to get them
S0269	oh well our solicitor say the two of them have cost fifty thousand pound but as i point out to that's only that's not even half of it because time
S0268	mm
S0269	the
S0268	cos he's get a
S0269	if we've get a heritage expert up there
S0268	and he's gotta take that all onboard
S0269	yeah
S0268	yeah
S0269	so you can double so the fifty thousand pound you can
S0268	there you be darling
S0269	you can double it
S0268	that's what you do mm
S0269	and that's what it be all about
S0268	mm
S0269	cos there's force as much cost on the other side as you can
S0268	mm
S0269	erm and well 's estimate for the total cost for the other side be two hundred and fifty thousand quid
S0268	mm
S0269	and that's two hundred and fifty thousand quid that you can't spend build a turbine or run a football club
S0268	mm mm
S0269	and there's the other thing be to duck and dive and put the pressure on the local plan authority because they come at it right from the start they be determine to get plan permission for wind turbines in in district
S0268	mm
S0269	that be where they start from
S0268	mm
S0269	erm so the other thing we do be not only try to belittle the developer but sadly also belittle the local plan authority
S0268	mm
S0269	but i'm sure that's what they ought to be do up there try and get the revenue out of them by a reduce proposal er and force cost on them and eia push significant cost on them because i don't believe they've get the capability of do it themselves
S0268	mm
S0269	and they'll have to pay
S0268	mm
S0269	erm
S0266	eia be environmental
S0269	impact assessment
S0266	yeah assessment isn't it yeah
S0268	mm
S0269	but it could be
S0266	so who do that do the developer do that or the
S0269	the developer's get to put one in
S0266	oh so it's to the can the council don't have to do it then
S0269	no
S0266	plan authorities
S0269	no all the cost be with the developer but it could be that all the developers get together you see
S0266	but then er shouldn't they have a landscape expert the plan department
S0269	well well i that be my recommendation to
S0268	yeah
S0269	er be to try and persuade the local plan authority to employ a landscape consultant which they didn't do for the turbines
S0268	mm
S0269	and i would imagine any landscape consultant worth his salt er would not have five hundred acres worth of solar panel er in the
S0268	mm
S0269	because of the view from the that the plan inspectors have er say be outstanding and of national importance
S0268	why can't pressure be put on them to have a landscape consultant
S0269	well that's what i hope be do
S0268	because so many of these things can be just stop
S0269	that's right
S0268	in their track
S0269	that's right but
S0268	if if if it be say that you don't stand any chance
S0269	that's right
S0268	or you stand very little chance er
S0269	that's right but
S0268	you'd go and find another site
S0269	mm but what er what er the local plan authority do with the wind turbines er be say well ecotricity's do the landscape assessment
S0268	mm
S0269	therefore it must be right
S0268	mm
S0269	erm
S0266	mm
S0269	but you know vest interest isn't it
S0268	well you need a dispassionate observer
S0269	that's right
S0268	well i mean we pay a lot of council tax
S0269	so we do indeed
S0268	why can't they
S0269	erm
S0268	and this be a very sensitive
S0269	and
S0268	area
S0269	and one of the reason that they do not employ a landscape consultant be because they say they haven't get any money
S0268	mm
S0269	when i challenge that
S0268	mm
S0269	at the time why er why have you not employ a landscape consultant and if you've not employ one why have you take no notice of the conservation board and the council for
S0268	mm
S0269	the protection of rural england
S0268	mm
S0269	cos their two experts erm be dead these turbines down here but their view pardon the pun be
S0269	be totally ignore
S0268	mm there's a terrible feel of déjà vu about all this
S0269	there be indeed
S0268	the position and the
S0269	that's right
S0268	you know power
S0269	but it may have do everybody in the erm a favour that so many developers have come along at once because that one that i mention last night down at be it
S0268	mm
S0266	yeah
S0269	that be under the radar i didn't even know
S0268	mm
S0269	and a lot of people didn't even know
S0268	mm
S0266	but don't you think that they see district council as a soft touch
S0269	yeah i'm sure they do
S0266	these developers
S0269	yeah
S0266	they wouldn't go and do it up the
S0269	no they certainly wouldn't they do see them as a soft touch but the interest thing be we've get quite excite about all this lot now but that one that where the plan approval be there under the radar be in 's patch in her ward that be right on the
S0268	well how can they how come it wasn't flag up i mean don't you put in for erm you know er erm want prior notice of these things i mean it's er er surely the on that on those ground maybe that it could be kick out that it wasn't it wasn't
S0269	well it's not in parish we're we've get the real have get the everything in parish be flag up to but
S0268	oh so you think well if it be if didn't even know about it
S0269	well do
S0268	oh she do know about it
S0269	yeah it's a it's her ward
S0268	mm
S0269	but didn't do anything about it
S0268	oh she didn't let you know
S0266	why not
S0269	that i don't know
S0268	how many acres be that then
S0269	fifty i think be it fifty thirty or fifty i think
S0268	how many football pitch be that
S0269	oh i don't know i er cor it take me years to get a decimal er a metric never mind measure things in term of football pitch
S0268	isn't a football pitch two and a half acres
S0269	well that's about one hectare then isn't it
S0268	yeah
S0269	so erm the one down at then will be eighteen or twenty
S0268	twenty five twenty five football pitch or twenty
S0269	yeah
S0268	mm erm
S0269	but i er well the other thing i mean i i happen to believe that solar panel on do it on this basis be an absolutely nonsense way of er
S0268	mm
S0269	harness the energy from the sun i accept that a few years down the track that most of our energy be gonna come from there but it ain't gonna come through these solar panel
S0268	mm
S0269	erm and you know they're build all these solar panel and then we'll have no land to er
S0268	get food
S0269	grow any food and
S0268	mm mm
S0269	and the wildlife
S0268	mm so what you think there's gonna be a better system than solar panel there's gonna be
S0269	oh i would think somebody's gonna come up er
S0268	yeah
S0269	with a
S0268	i mean it could be a completely different technology but still use the sun
S0269	yeah it'll certainly be use the sun
S0268	mm
S0269	er but it you'll have them er on windows and tile and everything
S0268	in roads maybe
S0269	yeah and in roads down central reservations
S0268	mm
S0269	but the other thing be somebody's get to invent store it
S0268	mm
S0269	a way of store it cos you can't store it at the moment
S0268	mm
S0269	oh well you can't store a meaningful amount like that guy up
S0268	mm
S0269	who be try to lecture us that oh you can store electricity now he say
S0268	mm
S0269	with er water up hill and
S0268	mm
S0269	interconnectors and spare wind turbine power in scotland can be export to norway
S0268	mm
S0269	erm but you know they're just play with it but you know you the solution be technical innovation
S0268	mm
S0269	and the rate at which erm innovation be come along i mean what thirty years ago mobile phone be the size of house bricks very little
S0268	mm
S0269	connectivity twenty five years be you hadn't you hadn't get an internet i don't think have you
S0268	no
S0269	look at it now the rate of change be enormous
S0268	mm
S0269	and you know as at the wed on saturday about energy efficiency that yeah you will get some reduction with energy efficiency but all the other things come along er the electricity be consumption's gonna go up we're electrify half the railways at the minute
S0268	mm
S0269	and you need a lot of solar panel to run a railway
S0268	mm
S0269	electric cars
S0268	mm well it's good you give her a hard time
S0269	i think she quite enjoy it to be honest with you
S0268	do she
S0269	yeah i mean she be she be er i think she be
S0268	do you open her eye a bite
S0269	yeah i think she learn a lot
S0268	mm
S0269	erm
S0268	how do you get onto it
S0269	er because as soon as she i i didn't know who she be
S0268	mm
S0269	to start with
S0268	mm
S0269	but i introduce myself and she say she be erm and i the the name sort of ring a little bite of a bell and i say oh be be you the lady that go over to see in or or something and she say oh yeah i say oh you're the wind turbine
S0269	joke i say oh i say i er you're the wind turbine er girl then be you and er so it go on from there erm but then she start talk about solar panel and we've gotta do something to cut our energy consumption down and i ask her how they be gonna do that er and then she say we've gotta get another source for for our electricity and i say what's that and she say well solar panel and wind turbines and i say you've gotta be joke
S0268	mm
S0269	and then she do say well possibly tidal and wave and i say well ecotricity be try to crack the wave one er but the amount of power that you'd generate in in the grand scheme of things you know it's miniscule and then she say about the barrage that the barrage across the severn have you know probably do seven or ten percent of the nation's power requirements and i say perhaps we're a month till all the underwater turbines silt up with the amount of the the silt load come down the river severn be absolutely enormous and then you've gotta pay for the maintenance
S0268	mm
S0269	and she say she hadn't think of that
S0268	mm
S0269	and then she ask what she what i think the solution be and i say nuclear and fracking and gas but not from russia
S0268	not
S0269	and she say er oh er you'd be one of these people who'd be okay with fracking under your house if you get pay for it and that's when i say well british airways don't pay me for fly over my house why would i want anybody to pay me for go underneath it
S0268	mm
S0269	and then she say her husband be come back fly back from new zealand and that be the end of the discussion cos i say
S0269	what be that do for planet
S0268	mm
S0266	how much money do the government put into research in comparison to the subsidies that be give to these erm wind turbines and things
S0268	well a pretty good question i i don't honestly know the answer but i would think not not very much not very much at all
S0266	in comparison
S0269	oh i would
S0266	so
S0269	imagine it's only percentage in single figure relative to subsidies for wind turbines and solar panel
S0266	really but that's wrong isn't it
S0269	i think it's wrong i i think the the priority
S0266	i mean as a taxpayer
S0269	yeah
S0266	wouldn't it be better or as a
S0269	oh
S0266	you know
S0269	yeah i i think it i think it would er but as long as the people in charge of the shop think otherwise we've we've get a problem but i would have say that you be better off put your money into basic research to er be able to store find a way of store electricity er and a way of generate it from the power of the sun but not put acres of solar panel down over field be not the way forward in my book
S0266	have they do that in america
S0268	they still do the same stuff there though don't they they the
S0266	no but they've go ahead with fracking haven't they
S0269	well
S0268	yeah but the desert
S0269	mm
S0268	they've get those panel in the desert
S0269	yeah that's right i think well in fact one er one possible way for us if you put the solar panel in the sahara desert near the equator on a couple of wire erm and develop a way of transmit electricity that's doesn't result in too too many losses it's probably a better way of do it cos you'll generate far more from a solar panel on the equator than you will at the latitude we're at
S0268	but you're gonna lose a lot of electricity over that transmission to just as
S0269	yeah
S0268	how much would you lose
S0269	well
S0268	a lot
S0269	well it would be more than ten percent i would think
S0268	mm
S0269	it er it er yeah probably quite a bite more than ten percent because you're lose in the grid system in the uk with the typical transmission losses will be about eight percent i would think
S0268	and it's gotta go under the sea at one point
S0269	yeah and put it under put it underground or under sea be very very expensive
S0268	mm
S0269	cos people don't realise how much heat
S0268	mm
S0269	be come off power wire
S0268	mm
S0269	erm if it's underground you've gotta put it in cool water the cable
S0268	and people who don't like us can cut it
S0269	well
S0268	cut the wire
S0269	yeah that's a good that's a good point yeah
S0268	mm
S0269	so as far as possible try and be self sufficient
S0268	mm
S0269	but then with the scottish referendum er come along there may be somebody cut the wire or it may be us and not them
S0268	well that's another vex subject
S0269	indeed
S0268	mm i think do you think they're get worry now politicians cos there's possibilities that it's gonna go independent
S0269	i think you're gonna get a i think the vote will be no rather than yes but it'll be fairly close and therefore the the argue be gonna go on and on and on and on
S0268	mm
S0269	there be one merit in have a yes vote be that right that's it but if you've get a no vote
S0268	mm they'll try again
S0269	we'll keep try and try and try until everybody
S0268	until we get the right answer
S0269	fall over yeah that's right
S0268	yeah
S0269	till they get the right answer
S0268	mm
S0269	erm but if that's what they want
S0268	they be say at lunchtime on the radio that if it's a yes vote cameron's gonna lose his job cos he have it's
S0269	yeah
S0268	it's a major failure
S0269	mm
S0268	of his
S0269	yeah i would you know i would think he
S0268	plus he get
S0269	he probably wouldn't want to continue
S0268	plus you've get the clacton by election
S0269	well that that's right but erm that result may be a bite closer than what people be currently predict mind they're currently predict sixty four percent of the people who vote for the ukip and twenty three'll vote for
S0268	mm
S0269	for the conservative but i don't see that well you see what's what's forget in on this scottish erm referendum thing be if you go back to the last er general election i think i'm right in say that the scottish conservatives get more vote than the scottish nationalists
S0268	if you go back when
S0269	to twenty ten
S0268	mm really
S0269	mm mm
S0268	can't see that
S0269	well maybe we ought to go back and check up
S0268	mm don't think that's right
S0269	well that's a figure that stick in my mind
S0268	really
S0269	yeah
S0268	mm i think that
S0269	i'll go back home and check that
S0268	i think they be a a kind of erm an endanger species conservatives in scotland
S0269	well conservative seat be an endanger species
S0268	yeah
S0269	cos it all depend how your individual vote be spread around don't it
S0268	oh right okay oh no doubt it's i i find that difficult to believe
S0269	well maybe we'll check that then well the european commission's come out today that er unless you've get your own central bank that you won't be allow membership of the european union
S0268	mm
S0269	and they're not gonna if they go independent they're not gonna become members of the eu cos spain'll see to that
S0268	mm yeah cos they don't want fragmentation
S0269	yeah they don't want er
S0268	basque separatists
S0269	that's right
S0268	yeah
S0269	but the european vice president have say if you haven't get your own central bank erm you can't be a member of the european union that's the treaty and if this lot down here we're not share the currency then you'll only have
S0268	it could just be a threat
S0269	er well that's the card that the nationalists be play but
S0268	mm
S0269	i i think they may be take a big risk with that why would i in england want to have scotland as an independent country part of
S0268	use our
S0269	our bank system
S0268	mm
S0269	with a central bank that's there of lender of last resort to bail them out why would i wanna do that i wouldn't wanna do it
S0268	mm why can't they have their own
S0269	good point
S0268	call it the thistle or something
S0269	mm that's right but er
S0268	but that's not plan b i don't i don't think he's get a plan b
S0269	mm well they be threaten to renege on the their share of the debt which be an empty threat cos if they renege on that i can't think of too many people on the planet who
S0268	be gonna lend
S0269	will wanna lend them a few bob
S0268	yeah so it's all gonna happen in two weeks
S0269	two weeks' time innit
S0268	two weeks' time
S0269	two weeks tomorrow
S0268	mm
S0269	that's right but some of the intimidation that appear to be go on be er
S0268	mm
S0269	make you think
S0268	mm
S0269	so but anyway he's promise a better health service and free social care and cradle to grave
S0268	but compare to most countries it's all very civilise even though there's sort of a few things go on now i mean when you look at other part of the world elections in pakistan
S0268	or afghanistan or you know anywhere in the middle east
S0269	that's right
S0268	it's just you know at least there be a debate and it's all
S0269	that's right
S0268	very civilise really
S0269	mm
S0268	alright the the they're cut out rough now the
S0269	mm
S0268	some of the nationalists
S0269	mm
S0268	not the nationalists the well yes
S0269	yeah
S0268	the parliamentary
S0269	that's right the yes er
S0268	yeah
S0269	yes element erm
S0268	but i mean
S0269	and that's a bite disappoint but have work in scotland but that's many years ago for a erm for a few years it be quite it's disappoint but it don't altogether surprise me when i saw what be go on when i be up there and in fact even when i go up there ten years ago to the place i work there be still red white and blue paint on the curb side say not welcome
