S0266	just to make sure this be i think that's okay it's record okay so you be go to tell us about your experience of personal shop
S0267	yes well the reason for personal shop be because my daughter's get marry in december
S0266	mm
S0267	and erm want an outfit as the mother of the bride but i really don't want to stand out in front of anyone else i i don't don't i just hate that sort of thing
S0310	yes
S0267	and and i'm not happy with my weight cos i haven't be able to get onto the diet thing you know every monday come and i start and by tuesday wednesday it's off so wasn't really happy and i've go up definitely a dress and a half size so eh this be she arrange for a personal shop experience for herself myself and who be my my step erm
S0266	sister in law
S0267	sister in law yeah but not actually
S0266	right
S0267	so she's she's 's partner my brother in law's partner
S0266	oh right
S0267	so the three of us go off and i be not you know i think it be really nice of her to do this
S0266	mm
S0267	but actually it wasn't what i want and i'd want to shop by myself not with two two friends that be go to say this be lovely and then hate because i should be should be in a bright colour or whatever and i don't
S0310	yes
S0267	anyway i'd start out and have you ever be to a personal shopper

S0267	but erm so when there no date's be set
S0310	they haven't set a date it might even be two thousand and sixteen

S0267	oh crikey
S0267	how do that come about
S0310	erm because that's where her family eh go
S0267	oh
S0310	and in fact although erm and live in she's only just move to and she be a server there so although she's lose her residence in she and her parent be well know so she meet the criteria
S0310	because of course they must get hundreds of request to get marry in
S0267	i'm sure i'm sure but if you have an attachment to i think the bandsman read out for and 's weekend and they manage not to be at any one of them
S0310	yes yes
S0267	oh and you believe him
S0310	yes i've hear them at least once i think in

S0266	yes yes yes mm mm ah so shall we go back to your personal shop experience
S0267	yes let's do that ah as i say not happy to have do it really but erm because they organise it friends organise it i think well i'll just have to go along
S0266	mm
S0267	and eh i just really truss myself up in something that be go to try and hold me in a little bite erm and the lady come in and as you say you have this personal erm you know cubicle which be big enough for all of us to sit down no tea or anything though which be a shame but i guess that could go over the clothe i don't know
S0310	yes
S0267	but erm so we sit down and she be very good the person who be do it be very good she listen erm she say what colour would you like and i say black because it's just my favourite colour to dress and this wed be late afternoon so it's go to be an even dress now to me i my little black dress be what i want and i'm also dress because i want her to recognise straight away what i like because i think they'll clock you won't they and think oh what's she wear now
S0266	yes yes
S0267	so i wear a shift dress and that's what i'm happiest in be a shift dress of any kind black sequin even whatever erm so she say black hmm and i say well i can dress it up with a lovely necklace or whatever er and a little coat or something like a jacket but my favourite would be black anyway she go away and she duly bring a little black dress which be the first thing to try on and there be other colour erm a bright a teal blue which in fact suit me i never know it would do or never think it would do but it do but it be just like a carnival dress it just be not me so ah but the black dress be an instant fit i just she just have my figure straight away and i think i've never look so good in a black dress ah anyway but she say no no you can't do that for mother of the bride that's a no no so erm that be put aside and i say but i'll buy it as my little black dress so it be put aside for me it be the first one i try that she bring in erm then another
S0266	can i just interrupt a second do do you like builder's tea or do you want earl grey or something fancy
S0267	builder's tea
S0310	yes builder's be
S0267	sugar
S0267	yeah no sugar
S0266	milk you put your own milk in that be okay
S0310	that would be fine
S0266	sorry to interrupt yeah so the next dress
S0267	and eh so the next dress be a there be a red one and i'm good with red but it just didn't really do anything and i keep want to go back to the black dress
S0266	mm
S0267	anyway she move on to the other two
S0266	i be go to say so yes
S0310	be they be they inputting comment and be that satisfactory or be that
S0267	erm yes i i think i'd have prefer to do one one on one but actually erm yeah they be say that look lovely or that look lovely and they like the teal
S0310	yeah
S0267	well i still felt overdress
S0310	mm
S0267	so erm although everyone seem to like that the best it be not for me
S0310	mm
S0267	eh anyway we she move onto these two and seven dress be bring out and say can i try that black dress and erm i say yes you can but it i'm go it's go to be my little black dress
S0267	anyway i have never see her look so beautiful in a dress it be just just perfect figure for and whereas she's short and i'm tall we actually have the same middle figure
S0310	right
S0267	erm and so i think well she'll just have to have this and so she be wear that little black dress and i go online afterwards and buy my own copy so we'll have to be at different place for this dress to be wear
S0267	this share dress but erm
S0266	how much milk do you say
S0267	oh that's fine thank you and then erm she bring in some other clothe for them
S0310	yep lovely
S0267	and one of them be a jumpsuit and as soon as it come off the rack i say i can i try that just stick up my hand straight away and say can i have that so i put it on and i felt fine that be for me and it's a jumpsuit with very
S0266	jumpsuit
S0267	yep so i'm wear long which be what the mother mother in law be wear be wear long and i'm wear long
S0310	right
S0267	and other people can wear long that would be lovely erm but it's it's long but of course it's wide legged
S0310	yes right
S0267	so it be like a long dress but it be definitely it's dressy actually but er i'm go to buy a which i think will do better justice
S0310	mm
S0267	and it have a lace over black and three quarter
S0310	oh right
S0267	so i just think i i hang about in it in the dress room for quite a while and i think still show a bite of a tummy though so i need to do a bite more work in the diet sort of thing but erm i and i want to wear that so i buy it and that's what i'm wear so so i would honestly say because i be surprise she have my figure so
S0310	fantastic thank you yes yes
S0267	so what things do you usually like what dress

S0266	mine be tealy greeny
S0267	it be it be beautiful
S0266	well it it wasn't that i'd have look at and think oh i want that
S0267	no
S0266	it's just she put it on me and
S0267	actually your hair colour you know i think have something to do with it
S0266	i don't know
S0267	so you know it go i think it's a good colour on most people i think actually
S0310	mm
S0267	erm but this be fussy yours wasn't actually it just it be a really nice no it wasn't it be beautiful
S0267	but this be actually but you know those erm ribbon criss cross design at the moment
S0266	oh yeah
S0310	yes yeah
S0267	it's one of those yeah but you know it just
S0267	and then they go up in a fee just you know in front of the knees and i don't like that i i have to on the knee or below and this one go up just like that and i think you know
S0310	no yes yes
S0267	actually i felt like a fish i do
S0266	that colour there that be that the one you're talk about
S0310	oh yes that be a really nice colour
S0267	yes yeah no it isn't
S0266	and it isn't it wasn't fashionable particularly cos it be really difficult to get shoe that colour
S0267	no but the length of it be beautiful
S0310	yes yes
S0266	oh i don't know it's not a dress i'd have look at
S0267	what size shoe do you fit
S0266	erm six and a half to seven
S0267	oh no good
S0266	why
S0267	but i'm not have a teal dress anyway but eh those be beautiful shoe
S0266	yeah and luckily they be half price
S0267	mm
S0266	and i buy them two days before
S0310	do you get shoe as well then
S0267	no i didn't i again i take erm shoe with a erm a heel which i could hardly walk around in
S0310	mm
S0267	but actually the erm jumpsuit leg length hem length erm be just brush the grind on that so i be go to have to get a proper pair of shoe that be that high but comfortable
S0310	mm mm
S0267	so erm
S0266	that's not easy
S0267	it's not easy no
S0266	cos i couldn't i be terrify how i be go to walk in the shoe
S0267	or have them take up in that yeah mm
S0266	mm
S0267	but you be also outside in the grass so you have to
S0310	i mean i
S0266	no it's in the gravel as well
S0267	mm
S0266	cos you sink in gravel
S0267	yeah
S0266	mm
S0310	i mean years ago people use to wear high heel didn't we have to wear high heel to work and look at them
S0266	yeah mm
S0310	i've get one pair i still have and i look at them and think this be ridiculous
S0266	mm

S0266	do you do you wear high heel now you don't know
S0310	no not at all
S0266	no
S0267	i do but not you know sort of erm not huge ones and not stilettos they're more chunky but they're still very high
S0266	mm mm
S0310	mm
S0267	but it's the erm i think as at home in children and you're just in your erm
S0266	casual clothe or
S0267	casual erm what do you call them i like to call them tackys erm erm
S0310	flatties i suppose be they
S0267	mm
S0266	what do you mean trainers

S0310	oh mm
S0266	flatties
S0310	yeah
S0267	yes yeah but erm your arch go down every time so actually you cannot get them back up to the you know difficult over time so you get
S0310	mm
S0310	it's a fashion thing too isn't it i mean my daughter doesn't wear high heel
S0267	mm
S0310	i don't think very many of them do except for
S0267	mm
S0310	a very special occasion so they don't wear them on a daily basis like we use to at that age
S0267	mm
S0266	no
S0267	actually our age do actually you know
S0266	mm
S0267	she's on stilettos she's still yes yes wherever she go she's get heel stiletto heel
S0266	she's not
S0310	mm
S0266	but so many people of our age group now have get bunions and things from wear stilettos and goodness know what
S0267	people i know have operations for bunions
S0310	yes yes
S0267	mm
S0310	but apparently there be now a school of think which say that's nothing to do with the shoe you wear it's genetic
S0267	really
S0266	oh really

S0266	do you find it at all sort of erm threaten have other people there with you would you have rather
S0267	no not threaten erm i er
S0266	or discomforting
S0267	i wasn't i didn't actually look forward to it maybe discomforting yeah not at the time though cos it be a bite of fun with all three of us er but i know really that would love me to have get the outfit so i felt pressure in that way that i would have to buy eh as soon as the jumpsuit come out there that's the one
S0310	yes yes
S0267	so
S0266	and be you go to wear anything on your head be you
S0267	no i i just feel i've get fine hair and as soon as i put a hat on or anything that it just just you know it just flatten it's yeah silly
S0310	flatten it yeah mm mm
S0267	so i may may just get a little diamante something or other
S0266	cos this this woman who make my she make them for people like princess anne and goodness know what
S0267	really
S0266	and eh she's really nice we go to her house and i think she would you know cost a fortune and it be thirty quid
S0310	well
S0267	really
S0266	mm she be amaze it's the second time she's do it for me
S0267	well
S0266	i kind of recommend her in a way cos you can go to her and
S0267	mm
S0266	just show her what you're wear and she'll she she's you know there be these people come in and take away stuff that be go to be wear by obviously very special people
S0310	yeah
S0267	mm wow
S0266	agents or whatever they be shop and erm and and i saw a few cheque write out for much more money than she be charge me about six time as much
S0267	wow gosh
S0266	but she's she's into it not just for the money so if you're just a sort of person off the street
S0310	mm mm
S0267	well for me i mean it's an even do so i'm not go to be wear a hat or a
S0266	no
S0267	you know yeah
S0266	so it's just shoe now
S0267	it be just shoe and a nice little clutch bag i think erm oh no and a jacket cos i can't you know you'd have to have a ah this have get a little keyhole at the back as well
S0267	which i didn't realise till i be take it off i think and erm but i'd i need a jacket in the church sort of
S0310	yes yeah
S0266	do they not suggest a jacket
S0267	no well this be the very end and we'd be there from nine a m till twelve because the three hours have to so say an hour
S0266	oh they they be be dress as well
S0267	yeah they be be dress and they buy the well be wear the little black dress to the wed and strangely enough buy another black dress so there'll be a lot of black be wear i think erm you know glitzy erm necklaces and stuff so
S0310	mm
S0266	oh right i didn't realise the other three be buy as well
S0267	yes yeah
S0310	so that mean the hour be the standard what you book be it's an hour be it
S0267	pressure on it be yeah
S0266	yes
S0310	mm
S0267	but to be honest if you find a dress you know as i say the first one i try be the one i love the dress those sort of three outfit they didn't all look nice they you know she just have
S0266	yes
S0267	have the knack but erm
S0266	this be john lewis
S0267	this be john lewis yeah yeah mm
S0310	mm yeah
S0266	that's very promise actually
S0267	it be the other thing i be think be i didn't really want another reason for not really want to do this be erm i know that john lewis in in isn't as eh hasn't get as much as if you go to you know house of fraser
S0310	yes yes
S0266	or diana tout and
S0267	so i know what they be go to show me be either a this happen to be a phase eight outfit but they're name label you know and one of the guests could be wear it you know that's that's where i find a trouble in my mind about it really how many other jumpsuits be go to be there
S0266	yes yes
S0310	mm that's a slight worry yes yes
S0266	i think that be my fear as well
S0267	yeah
S0266	that's why i want it make
S0267	cos phase eight be a popular erm label over all the generations even younger people so i be a little bite worry about this
S0310	mm
S0266	yes yes no cos you'll personalise it so
S0267	well i'll have a
S0310	mm yeah so what sort of finish be that go to be what sort of fabric would that be
S0267	it'd be better if it be satin i think to give it some kind of a lift for the even
S0266	mm and what colour
S0267	and so if you've get black i would go for black
S0266	cos you could do really bright colour and then a pair of shoe to match or be that too dare
S0267	top the top be nude lace over the black
S0266	oh right yeah sorry i be think it be all black
S0267	yeah erm mm so probably black you don't have one do you
S0266	but you could sell one quite easily
S0267	could i
S0266	or i could help you i mean i'd have think it's like the the sort of use to have you'd do a wide piece
S0267	yeah well i be go to go downstairs and go to but i don't know how much be actually
S0266	they're probably cheaper than you can make them for
S0310	yeah yes cos it's really just a pleat fabric isn't it
S0267	mm that's something
S0266	pleat would it be pleat
S0310	i imagine it as be pleat
S0266	i'm think of a sort of straight satin band around
S0310	yes i mean pleat in a sort of horizontal sense
S0267	it be yeah they be actually
S0266	be they
S0267	yeah
S0266	but you can have them just plain can't you or do you want oh that make it a bite more complicate doesn't it for sow
S0267	mm mm
S0266	what actual pleat flap over and go round
S0267	well that's what i imagine quite wrong
S0310	i've yeah well i've see them with pleat and i've see them with er soft pleat
S0266	mm yes
S0310	as if it's one thing but fold
S0266	yes yes oh right
S0267	mm i need to investigate that and a jacket and shoe and a clutch bag mm
S0266	so you're all sort
S0267	yeah
S0266	that's a huge relief oh have another biscuit you'll be fine
S0310	the only time i've really go to buy anything be as i say for my niece's wed and erm my daughter's very good actually i mean she understand me perfectly and she'll say just try it on because everything i would say no i don't think so
S0267	and you're look
S0310	oh no i don't think so mother just try it on
S0266	mm yeah right eh
S0266	i think yeah i think it must be twenty minutes now erm
