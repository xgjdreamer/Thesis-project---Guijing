S0381	oh
S0382	they look pretty comfortable to me
S0381	i've put the pizza in but it'll be ready in ten minutes
S0382	erm and that's just
S0381	okay
S0382	okay and things be worse in sub saharan africa
S0381	i have no idea what to think about what's go on what they should do
S0326	i think they do the right i think that be a good thing they do
S0382	yeah
S0381	seem like most of them think it's a good thing
S0326	i think that's really i couldn't really believe that they like cos they have sort of months ago be try to get rustle up the money to pay the thing and they tell the imf they'll cut the defence budget they'll get the money that way
S0382	great idea
S0326	and then they're not they weren't allow to do it by the imf
S0382	really
S0381	why
S0326	cos the imf be probably lobby by arm
S0382	oh
S0381	oh my god i didn't know that
S0382	oh oh wait wait be they part of nato
S0381	i don't know
S0326	i don't think i don't but they've be
S0382	i don't know if it be that it could have just be nato treaty obligations but
S0326	i mean even if erm say they've spend massively on arm more than any other european country over the last like over the last
S0382	really why
S0326	because
S0382	some other scam no doubt
S0326	their their their defence minister be in prison on a twenty year sentence
S0382	hm
S0326	some defence guy from their last government or pre like pre two thousand and eight government be in prison
S0381	oh my god
S0326	but they also i guess
S0381	now
S0326	as a sort of european front line to spend money on arm to
S0382	well they should i just think i why don't some countries just decide not to have a military anymore just think of the money you could save
S0326	but that's what people say about germany cos germany aren't allow to spend money on it
S0381	yeah that's right
S0326	no weapons and they have the strongest economy
S0381	yeah
S0382	that be that be such a bonus
S0382	and the well i don't know
S0381	yeah do they have an army be they not allow either
S0382	no after the second world war all these restrictions but they didn't want to either i mean mm i mean what be that it be just so childish another arm race
S0381	yeah why do the erm finance minister resign
S0326	cos he's like a erm it seem what it be be a way for the prime minister to have more and that be happen right now so they're look you know you have a problem with him so with them
S0382	yeah
S0381	oh i see so he didn't do you think the prime minister make him he do it sort of
S0382	it's a good move
S0326	it's probably his idea since the smartest one
S0382	he
S0381	oh really
S0382	well it be a good move he he really
S0381	he be tough huh
S0326	he be call them terrorists

S0381	she cause like
S0382	she feel she have total entitlement because
S0381	she's black and she's a woman in
S0382	it's a shame because you could she do in a sense

S0381	i don't know
S0382	i don't know bullshit
S0382	so what do you think about we speak what do you think about speech cos there's a big fight about it because you know they have the universities have these safes have you hear of safe space
S0326	erm no
S0382	you haven't
S0326	it's too slow for me to do this
S0381	yeah i don't know what be go on i think that happen to me i actually try to do it the other day and i get so frustrate
S0382	what do you think about charlie hebdo
S0326	erm i it doesn't really seem more like the question be there so like if you live in a world which be multicultural and there's an element of respect like
S0382	yeah
S0326	it's it's always a line where who know when you're go too far but
S0382	i agree but then people
S0326	freedom of speech be like it's not freedom to offend people shouldn't be
S0382	well and how how the hell do you draw that so if i say
S0326	like why people have like sort of you're not allow to go on speakers' corner and do sort of racist
S0382	well the thing
S0326	i don't see like why those cartoon
S0382	if you look at the first amendment of the us confirmation it's pretty absolute it's say really you can say what you like except when it's a direct threat that will
S0326	we're not in the unite state though
S0382	well no i know but
S0326	they they've gotta deal with their own
S0382	famous case when these ghastly nazis neo nazis want to hold their demonstration through er almost entirely jewish suburb of chicago skokie oh do you eat that crust
S0381	yeah
S0382	oh
S0381	that be my piece
S0326	i don't know how to get back into like to get away from this
S0382	it's very very difficult
S0381	i think that could be a rule of thumb
S0382	what
S0381	but i don't think you could write that into law that you can't that you couldn't you shouldn't offend people
S0382	i mean if i i'm you know
S0326	yeah but why do there have to be a law about it
S0382	why do there have to be
S0381	there doesn't have to be a law but
S0382	well
S0381	it would be a nice rule of thumb
S0382	this book reckon that quite a few of our laws and european speech laws would not would be strike down in america because
S0381	oh
S0382	they violate the first amendment
S0381	yeah
S0381	what be your speech laws i don't know
S0382	erm i don't well i've yeah i couldn't couldn't tell you but
S0381	what if you say i hate racist rhetoric
S0382	yeah well that's the great thing do we tolerate the intolerant and we have to tolerate the intolerant to make the intolerant kind of i i've actually download lot of our legislation from
S0381	oh you have
S0382	yeah
S0381	that's what you've be do
S0382	yeah i've be
S0382	i'm not waste my time i'm do research of course you could research
S0381	and be you gonna include it in your review
S0382	mm mm no probably not erm so i'll read you out a section of one of our laws see what you think
S0381	yeah
S0382	where's it okay section four a and five of the public order act nineteen eighty six make it an offence to use threaten abusive or insult word or behaviour that cause or be likely to cause another person harassment alarm or distress that's pretty that's kind of
S0381	what be the first the first part
S0382	well i mean you see one of the point it make it an offence to use threaten abusive or insult word or behaviour that cause or be likely to cause another person harassment alarm or distress but that just put suppose i'm very very sensitive and i'm distress
S0381	that's why i think the first
S0382	when you say fuck
S0381	the first part of the might be
S0382	yeah but you to court and you're tell you get you're not gonna get summon
S0381	it's not it's what's the i mean read it again one more time the first part of the class be what's gonna be
S0382	i mean i'm actually read his summary of it but i can i've actually get the the law itself as well here
S0381	insult i guess yeah hateful
S0382	well there be some of the things they use
S0381	yeah that's too vague that's too mm
S0382	a person yeah here's the rule fear or provocation of violence a person be guilty of an offence if he a use towards another person threaten abusive or insult word or behaviour or b distribute or display to another person any write sign or other visible representation on which be threaten abusive or insult comma with intent to cause that person to believe that immediate unlawful violence will be use against him or another by any person so it's quite a heavy qualification in that
S0381	yeah it's not bad
S0382	immediate unlawful yeah well the lawyers be pay
S0381	it's pretty good yeah i mean if they
S0381	great time argue over it exactly then
