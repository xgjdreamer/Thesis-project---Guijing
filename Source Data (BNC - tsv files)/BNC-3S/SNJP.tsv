S0227	your group but i would have also your great uncle have offer his his band for free here i would have have them as well because the music that they play be completely target at the young and not for the other generations that be there so it be
S0190	it be club music

S0192	oh no
S0227	no it wasn't no erm
S0192	so they have this lovely traditional wed and then club music

S0192	well it's gonna be quite different if you come to mine then
S0227	the gentry live but it's you you cut it to your own cloth that how the gentry live in the er in the nineteenth century and erm it be lovely though and it be a nice beautiful day the weather be lovely on that day
S0190	yeah
S0227	and so everything be be perfect erm
S0190	they be really really lucky
S0227	yes
S0192	yes
S0190	it be the the saturday before or the saturday after terrible
S0192	i mean i guess for and i we would love something like that but that's never gonna happen we can't ever afford it no
S0227	it's too if you no you
S0190	oh sorry that's where i put i book the same table
S0227	cut the you cut it to your cloth
S0192	so i wouldn't yeah but i wouldn't want
S0227	we'll put
S0192	something in between
S0227	no
S0192	i'd rather either have one extreme or the other
S0227	yeah but
S0192	i wouldn't rather be somewhere in the middle where i'm a bite like oh this isn't very tasteful or it's you know a bite cheapy
S0227	you you you can probably it's like it but you're so it's a very it it's a very expensive day it's you know
S0190	it can be a very expensive day
S0227	yeah no that's what i mean it can be you don't it doesn't have to be you know
S0192	well it's the cost of a the wed well it's not the wed be the sign of a paper forty pound
S0227	yeah i mean you need a
S0192	's face
S0227	you need
S0190	no i just i'm just surprise that be
S0227	yeah
S0190	i've never because i've always be involve in a wed where it's be er a a ceremony and everything else but i just think mm forty pound for just a piece of paper
S0192	yeah and that's all we have to do for and that would have to be on a weekday
S0227	yes
S0192	it become two hundred pound if it's the weekend
S0227	yeah
S0190	do it really
S0192	yeah mm just to sign the piece of paper two hundred pound just to sign a piece of paper
S0227	yes
S0190	do you not go through a ceremony or anything it's literally just
S0192	erm we have to say some vow
S0190	be you talk about a registry office
S0227	oh yeah there's vow
S0192	yeah
S0227	oh right you still go and do the registry office wed
S0227	yeah it it's not just yeah
S0192	if if if we we wouldn't get marry we would well that be get marry isn't it we sorry we would get marry but we wouldn't have a wed and then potentially a few years down the line and i might have a wed
S0190	a celebrate thing
S0192	yeah and and do something yeah
S0227	you you can yes you could reenergise and that and blah blah blah
S0192	but at the moment it's pragmatic there's not
S0227	no
S0192	it's because we will need to for
S0190	yeah but you shouldn't you shouldn't do it because you feel oblige to do it you do it because you want to that's what you decide in the end you or even if you you have your like you say you just your ceremony and then later on you have your wed bless or something if you that's entirely up to you but you do it because you want to not because you think oh gosh the family like it to do this i mean i'm sure that that
S0227	yes
S0192	know me what would you
S0190	's parent
S0192	what would you say i should do
S0190	don't get marry
S0192	just don't get marry
S0227	no but if he need it for a job
S0190	if you have to for a job yeah definitely
S0227	yeah
S0190	but i think the way you speak i don't think you particularly want to get marry you don't feel that you need to your bond that you have together be strong enough a piece of paper be gonna make no difference to you either way
S0192	mm
S0190	so what's the point
S0227	so if it's if it's for a job then you
S0192	it's just like you're get another degree certificate or something
S0227	you you you you take you take the the bare minimum and that's it you can have a celebration you could erm keep it to a a a bare a a bare minimum erm
S0192	you need
S0227	you have a slight dilemma because of how things have happen
S0192	i don't know who to invite be a problem
S0227	that's your dilemma
S0192	yeah it's a it's a really big dilemma because
S0190	you can invite everybody
S0227	well
S0190	just exactly the same as as erm and do there be and and his wife there be er
S0192	it's not
S0190	the two of us we have a photograph take with them and we have it take i have one take with and i and and and what's her so we all just do it for the day
S0192	for a wed i'd agree
S0190	that's it
S0192	but if we're just sign a piece of paper it's a long way for people to come yeah so
S0190	oh well for oh yes just for a piece of paper well it depend on whether you want to all go out for a meal
S0192	because we have to have witness don't we to do it
S0227	if if
S0190	yes
S0227	if i mean if you want to celebrate it your your your your dilemma would be that who to invite and who not to invite erm
S0192	i've even tell that i'm not sure i'd invite him now i know that sound strange but if i invite must invite her brothers
S0227	yes
S0192	she have three brothers
S0227	yes
S0192	who all have wive who all have children
S0227	yes
S0192	they're not just gonna come all the brothers on their own that suddenly
S0227	yes
S0192	if i invite it open it up to
S0190	well they're not gonna come in the week be they though be they really if it's in the week
S0227	yes the the the price escalate
S0192	we be very tempt to just have a very very small selection of people let's say
S0227	mm
S0192	maybe her parent and then you guy and
S0227	yes
S0192	and and
S0227	it's well don't if you if come you must invite
S0192	yeah i know
S0227	i can't believe i'm say that but
S0192	yeah i know
S0227	the but the my libra scale must balance and there have to be balance
S0192	how would you feel if i didn't invite you
S0227	i would feel
S0190	if i didn't invite me erm
S0192	if i just say it be just mum and dad that be it
S0190	fine if that's what you want
S0192	it's not necessarily what i want it's just
S0227	there's there be a cost to this
S0192	it's just easier isn't it
S0227	i i tell you a problem that i see here
S0190	you're i think you will you have more i mean i i go along i've always go along with what and have always want erm it's it be quite difficult to have to be with her in the thing but life go on and what have you
S0192	yeah
S0190	erm the hardest part i think be be for you and to think that you what don't have your day spoil by try to juggle i won't have a problem i will do whatever you like i think you'll have more of a problem with your mother it will
S0227	i agree
S0192	yeah no definitely
S0190	it will er upset
S0227	i i don't myself and like i say with my scale of balance i i will never like i can't like but if come he must come
S0192	yeah oh yeah
S0227	be you with me that i couldn't i could not sell i could try sell to you that you should invite and i think
S0192	which be why for and i for simplicity's sake
S0227	yes
S0192	we be consider just her parent er my parent that's it no siblings
S0227	yes
S0192	no anyone else
S0227	yes
S0190	well that's if you want it the other option be just to choose two set of close friends and just do it completely on your own
S0192	yeah we could just do it with friends couldn't we
S0190	and then just have a family get together on one side
S0227	the thing be that's i understand it's all of the postcards
S0190	and a family get together and you can either decide to make it with 's family and
S0192	we could do that couldn't we
S0190	with them and that way
S0192	we could travel around couldn't we
S0190	nobody that's right i mean you
S0192	i could i could go to 's family and we celebrate i could then come and stay with you guy with and we celebrate and then i could stay with mum
S0190	and i think
S0227	yeah right
S0190	that's right
S0192	yeah we hadn't consider that
S0227	no it's an option
S0192	that might be a good idea
S0190	that way you don't have to have anybody and it you won't be sit there all day worry that people be gonna feel like
S0192	it's not that i don't want
S0227	no no
S0190	no no i know but but it
S0192	it start escalate doesn't it it start build
S0190	well it it it
S0227	it it become a it become well i can see this will this be a dilemma i see be that erm mum be invite i'm invite whatever and and or or not be you with me but she's go to be think should be on this
S0192	oh yeah definitely
S0227	and this
S0192	and then
S0227	this erm will definitely that's it that
S0192	and then i can't have four people and 's only get two so
S0227	er should be there by right of passage he's your brother there's there's
S0192	but he be there when i propose
S0227	yes he have to be there when
S0192	isn't that enough
S0190	but he's already have that one
S0192	you know
S0227	he have to be there you may have to if you go down the line of you may have to bite the bullet on 's side of her you may have to bite the bullet
S0192	that's another like fifteen people
S0227	well yes but you may have to bite the bullet
S0192	but it's a lot of it's it's a lot to ask of people to come all the way down there just to see us sign the paper
S0227	unless unless er unless
S0190	yeah but that's that's why i'm say that it sound to me you better if they come two special friends from either side or mutual friends whatever and just have that and then go out for a meal afterwards and just just enjoy a nice time
S0192	i'm lean towards that idea yeah
S0190	and then like i say you that way nobody's offend nobody's leave out and nobody's more popular than anybody else
S0192	yeah and then everyone
S0227	it's still
S0192	doesn't have to travel down to either
S0227	i it's still
S0192	we can travel to those
S0190	yeah
S0227	it's i think if as i say it's difficult your brother be your brother share your blood but he's not your brother
S0192	no
S0227	but this be a big problem for mum i've already just actually discuss this with your brother and i've say that that if he be invite this must come from you not from her she cannot impose him on you if you say he's come then that's fine but for her to say he's come be not her decision to do that be you with me i mean i think that's your dilemma
S0192	i just think cos don't want any child there so
S0227	no
S0192	if it be to happen
S0227	yes
S0192	i mean when when one child be there all the attention be on the child always er
S0227	it's a dilemma because erm the parent put up make problems further down the road with these this i mean it's like
S0192	i mean it do doesn't it
S0227	it's like erm if you have a child
S0190	it do but there's a way round it
S0227	if you have a child or your brother have a child erm your mother have two choices we either see that child together or she see him later than me because i will not have see
S0192	no
S0227	my grandchild before i do be you with me because that to me be wrong erm if
S0192	don't worry i'm not gonna have a child
S0227	and and
S0192	i'm not gonna have one
S0227	or erm or erm have a child i will step back and let and go in right because it's their grandchild i will take up the role as grandfather but there's a there's a erm there be there be a a moment where i wasn't sure if be go to preside over a a role in the wed and i go to the rehearsal just in case he didn't but the right be his not mine because i i've be offer and if he couldn't do it i would take his place but i wasn't gonna say no i
S0192	no of course
S0227	i'm here and take into this cos
S0192	you're ancillary character
S0227	fortunately have change do a a conversation in france four years earlier and say he want me and not his dad on the top table well he be say you can't do that because
S0192	and you agree
S0227	he's your father we agree that that be wrong and
S0192	be it awkward for you at the wed
S0190	no because in the end and it it help that the actual caterer adjust it because of the layout of the room and how many they be allow to have and how they set the table out they're suppose to have a the top table and then eight table of ten ten table eight table of ten they change it and extend the top table so in the long run we all sit on the top table so and sit one end and and your dad and i sit the other end so nobody be more than anybody else
S0227	it also help that er me and get on fine we i know him a long time ago be you with me and so there's no animosity or anything
S0192	do he have any relation to cos it all seem to revolve around
S0227	yes yes
S0192	this this children's home
S0227	er ask me who who erm you know him
S0192	mm
S0227	who be drive instructor be
S0192	very strange
S0192	mm very strange
S0227	yes it's all
S0190	and where's your
S0192	the way it's all
S0227	and it's very
S0190	pardon
S0227	yes
S0192	the children's home i find it really strange
S0227	yes
S0192	at least on
S0190	he's get all the erm
S0192	this side of the family you weren't there mum work there dad go there
S0227	mm
S0190	that's where i meet your mum all those years ago
S0192	yeah
S0227	i say that i only know these people because of that home without that home i would you wouldn't exist
S0192	no no i know
S0227	if i hadn't go there you would not exist because i'd have be in london and go stay at watford or whatever so yes
S0190	there you go
S0192	and again the problem be a lovely large wed like that be really not and my style it's not if if we have the money what i would really like to do be find a beautiful desert island somewhere and have just us and invite all my family and friends and pay for them to come out and we'd hire a boat and do all this kind of stuff you know but you need to be a millionaire to do all these kind of things
S0190	mm of course you do
S0192	so it's not practical
S0227	the person you've get to manage the person's expectations you've get to manage be your mother's
S0190	and 's
S0192	to a certain degree
S0227	er no i'm not
S0192	to a certain degree
S0190	no 's the most important
S0227	no yes actually
S0192	yeah actually be the most important
S0227	no i'm without notwithstanding
S0192	and that's my problem i worry that i i'm pretty sure have the same opinion as me but
S0227	yes
S0192	occasionally
S0227	yes
S0192	there be certain things where i i doubt myself and wonder and i try and talk to her about well of course i talk to her about it cos i don't wanna be lead the charge on something that she doesn't feel erm and if she's happy we're very open with each other we're very honest and we talk about everything and
S0227	what's her take on children
S0192	er same as me really we both discuss the fact that probably part of us would definitely like to have children it's such a big experience it's such a core part of life that how could we miss out on such an experience especially with people like us who love to experience however there's too much that we have to do before then that potentially if we pretty much vaguely have up until forty plan out vaguely now after forty that's when i kind of think we could have children
S0227	no
S0192	no not at all
S0227	well well that
S0192	and we've discuss we've say when we get to forty i think we'll have do everything we wanna do and we'll be in a good enough job and we'll be qualify enough to be able to give a child a good life but she may have hit the the menopause by then cos her family hit it quite young
S0227	it's not
S0192	her mum hit it at forty
S0227	it's not impossible
S0192	so we've talk about erm adopt honestly adopt we think if we if er between here and then we don't feel ready to have a child then maybe when we get to that point we'll adopt
S0227	well though task with my with the erm the erm standard bearer of my genetic material
S0192	i'm sorry dad you say you don't put any pressure on me
S0227	no no no
S0192	but you do you do
S0227	i mean there's always the
S0192	you've tell me before you want to take my name
S0227	yes although
S0192	because you keep say well where would the mark in history be
S0227	erm erm
S0192	he do put some pressure he do it kind of passively aggressively but you really do
S0227	but although your your brother might end up as be the the standard bearer
S0192	yeah
S0227	i don't know i mean you may not have children to be honest there be a very good argument not to have them i mean and there's an argument to have them
S0192	yeah
S0190	if if you both boys could land up have daughters and there still won't be one
S0192	yeah
S0190	so what's the as though
S0192	we'll pass on the genetic material but not the name
S0190	yeah but that's yeah
S0227	oh yeah the well
S0192	unless they don't change their name
S0227	it's it's erm
S0192	that's the thing might not even change her name
S0192	sorry say that again
S0192	that's yes that be yours yes
S0227	yes thank you
S0192	thank you very much that look interest
S0227	another one

S0192	yeah

S0227	mm
S0190	but i can't eat it now just literally can't
S0192	mm it's fine it's definitely different to what i have before
S0190	but isn't the we erm when we go to erm italy ski on one er night erm my brother and his wife and erm and i go out for a meal and we go to a pizzeria and i have a erm be it kawasaki it be isn't it

S0192	mm it be good so yeah children i may not be able to erm
S0227	if you don't you don't
S0192	produce problem be practically if and i want to be lecturers in a european university we need a phd now unless we be super intelligent to the point where we get complete fund for a phd in the next couple of years we're gonna have to pay for a phd which be gonna take a couple of years to save up and then a phd be four years itself i can't have a child while i'm study for a phd
S0190	this be the dilemma that 's get because like she's get another be it another three years isn't it be it three
S0227	for what
S0190	until she finish her erm her study
S0227	i don't know she's
S0190	till she qualify to get her
S0227	she's a she's a registrar now
S0192	yes thank you very much
S0227	yes lovely thank you what even if she want to become a consultant cos she's a registrar already
S0190	yes yeah
S0192	thank you the problem there be things that get in the way you can't have a child at that point
S0190	well this be it that's what she say well she's i can have if i have a child then i'm not go to be able to look after it with the hours that i've do so then i'll have to either give up thank you and
S0227	can we have er do you want another beer have another one
S0192	i'm alright with this one you have another one
S0227	can i have another erm cobra please
S0227	er pint please
S0192	yeah i'm alright thank
S0227	no i'm fine thank you
S0192	yeah things get in the way i mean and i have consider if we have a child we would like to both work part time and alternate so we didn't have to put it into care or anything you know
S0190	into care yeah cos otherwise what's the point
S0192	no that's what i think
S0227	but your mum she's a she's a train nursery nurse i mean
S0192	yeah you know get the
S0227	trouble be you're gonna be live a very long way away and it won't be practical
S0192	and if we want to work as lecturers in a university i need to be produce research and research be not easy to do or i can't
S0227	no
S0192	imagine how you'd do that with a child do conferences and go round the country
S0227	no have you broach the subject with her
S0192	it just doesn't compute
S0227	about children
S0192	with who
S0227	with your mum
S0192	oh yeah i've as and be as i've be as frank with mum as i'm be with you
S0227	what's her take on this
S0190	be she disappoint
S0227	she it's part of the
S0192	disappoint yeah
S0190	because at the end of the day it's it's your dream
S0192	mm
S0190	that your children will carry on the same lifestyle that you have and they'll get marry and they'll have children so that you have grandchildren but i think as life society change you begin to think well life's different now we didn't go abroad and do all the sort of the you know work abroad and that like you've do so maybe it won't happen
S0192	it change i mean i think at the same time yes she's disappoint but i think she'll also if i do achieve what i'm set out to achieve hopefully she'll be proud
S0190	yeah
S0227	oh she'll be proud
S0192	you know regardless of have children
S0227	it it it's the erm
S0192	and if i if i adopt could you do you think you can love an adopt child
S0227	er
S0192	like your own grandchildren
S0227	well erm i have two
S0192	i mean there be children now that don't have parent
S0227	i have two like adoptive sons so i've kind of get round my head round that so erm yeah obviously there's a there's a er a a little disappointment that erm not mine but that be not a very erm a it's not conditional be you with me
S0190	well the other bite the other take on that be the fact that one or the other of you mightn't be able to have children
S0227	yes well yeah
S0192	which be which we've consider
S0190	so therefore the only way you could have a family erm be be to adopt
S0227	yeah er be be to adopt yeah
S0190	so why shouldn't er any other it should just be the same it's yours
S0192	and when i look around and think of all the children who don't have parent
S0227	yeah
S0192	i mean
S0190	i just think that i mean i always laugh at this be that i would like to adopt erm and have another child and then i think you have to be i i wasn't wouldn't have be a strong enough person to accept that that child because you have no idea of how that child be go to turn out you can try everything possible but you wouldn't be there's no guarantee
S0227	no
S0190	thank you
S0227	although there isn't with your own children either
S0192	no
S0190	well there isn't but
S0227	you can stick with blood
S0190	you can have some it's like
S0227	you'll stick with blood a a lot longer
S0192	it's definitely erm a bite of a quandary thank you think about how would i feel i mean a big part of us biologically do wanna pass on our dna i wanna see
S0227	it's your it's your
S0192	what a mixture of the two of us would look like
S0227	your your your problem your not your problem your your dilemma will be your your mortality er your legacy erm you've will pass on the baton on your what your like i say your mindset now my mindset at your age be totally different to my mindset now my mindset at your age would despise what i've turn into i quite like what i've turn into but this be talk to my my twenty eight year old
S0192	you're a different person
S0227	i'm a different my confidence be like the same but my like and dislike have change erm it's you will look at it as in you're only here for a finite period of time your immortality be isn't free of you will also look at this as then your life have be enrich by your experience do you want to pass that enrichment onto another generation
S0192	well what about if we have different philosophies what if i don't feel if i feel a genuine connection to everyone on this planet what if i think like oh lovely thank you
S0227	thank you
S0192	my legacy might not necessarily have to be impart through my own biology
S0227	no
S0192	that i
S0227	no
S0192	feel more of a kinship with with the people around me
S0227	yes you you might your legacy might be something totally different you might er have something write or something like that and er and you'll have a legacy in a different way
S0192	this be the first thing this that be cement me in history
S0227	mm
S0192	if anyone ever in the future look back and want to go what do the british public sound like in two thousand and fourteen we be all record
S0227	yes
S0192	this have probably cement us in history more than anything else that we've ever do
S0227	yes please send the royalties to erm
S0227	account
S0192	i hope that's not real
S0190	it be real
S0192	i mean they're only gonna
S0192	give money to you right they can't take money from you
S0227	please send royalty cheque to
S0192	but seriously i mean this be go in the cambridge university british national corpus the only one in the whole country that do this
S0227	mm i still want my royalties
S0227	erm
S0192	i think that be quite interest
S0227	i think it's erm
S0192	that's your legacy
S0227	the it depend
S0190	that's strange wouldn't it to think that grandchildren sorry again it's that but grandchildren would look back and something would come out of that and and turn around and say that's my my grandpa or grandma do that
S0227	yes well
S0190	yeah
S0192	it will be they don't have many i mean it's a large project but they send out a global email to me the other day with everyone else that's involve in the course there's only other one hundred people in the whole country do this so there's not that many of us
S0227	no
S0192	and they're now ask us where be you do this because they're look for any gap in the country
S0227	yeah
S0192	so i be cover well i kind of tell them it's a bite it doesn't seem right because actually i'm live in but everyone i've record so far be from from or so i kind of
S0227	yeah bedfordshire and northamptonshire
S0192	tell them that really my area be
S0227	yeah
S0192	be that area so we will be the as far as i know they don't have anyone else record from this area so eventually they'll make a map
S0227	yeah
S0192	and the map will have lot of point on it and you'll click on a point and it'll have a record from that area so you will be in the archive
S0227	we'd better make sure we don't drop our hs and and
S0190	they're not go they're not take what we've say you say they're only they're not go to play back what we've say be they
S0192	i mean people will be able to listen to it
S0190	you say that it wasn't that it be
S0192	i say that they're not they're not pay any attention to what you're say but it's it's for use
S0190	well of course they will you can't not listen to a conversation
S0227	i don't think
S0192	they're not gonna know who you be there's no name attach and any time that we mention each other's name that will take out so there's no
S0227	right in in fifty years' time
S0192	your identity be protect
S0227	they won't be pay much you know what the detail maybe what's be say not
S0192	it's the pronunciation they're focus on the pronunciation
S0227	yes yes
S0192	and word that you use
S0227	yes
S0192	and that kind of stuff but they they've tell us and part of the sheet that you sign
S0227	yes
S0192	they're say that all of your personal identities
S0227	yes
S0192	will be discard
S0190	i be go to say yeah
S0227	i hope that
S0192	they won't know who you be
S0227	i don't i don't want to sound
S0192	but your voice will be there for history
S0227	yeah i don't want to sound bombastic but i hope my word be bigger that maybe the
S0227	the syllables of my word be big enough to
S0192	a linguist would argue there be no judgement here we really have an elitist culture now where you know receive pronunciation be what you understand
S0227	yeah
S0192	and that's what you should aim for anything else be just incorrect it's wrong it's poor elocution but linguists would argue that there's no such thing and you describe language and there be so many variations and you i mean i've be sell in crowd for a very long time hundreds of years we call it you know break english bastard english all sort of terrible name
S0227	pigeon english
S0192	for these kind of things yeah erm but actually when you study it linguistically it's as much a fully form language as any other language it's just different
S0227	mm
S0192	they use tense modality and aspect markers they have their own grammar they have everything there's a set feature there's no worse than any other language you can't linguists would argue that you can't look at a language and say this be better than that language historically we've always argue that latin base languages be the best because they're highly inflect they have a lot of you know inflection
S0227	erm no
S0190	inflections
S0227	in in be you on about like a
S0190	like this er yeah or like you put er over when you're use french
S0227	an emphasis or something like that
S0192	inflection's grammatical so
S0227	yeah
S0192	plurality if i say dog and then i say dog
S0227	yeah
S0192	the s be an inflection we don't use much inflection when i say i play you play he play the only one that's inflect be the third person he play
S0227	yeah
S0192	in spanish it's that's highly inflect
S0227	yeah
S0192	they they indicate gender plurality they indicate all sort of function through inflection
S0227	mm
S0192	we don't have that so for a long time grammarians say the best languages be ones with high inflection the latin languages
S0227	mm
S0192	but we turn around and go well why be that why be a language that have less inflection we still provide all those things in english we just use more theme to do it we use extra little word we don't attach it to the same word we add another word to do it so there's no difference all languages they they argue that there be no simple languages
S0190	mm
S0192	a a human language will cover every avenue possible the only difference be some languages have fewer word than other languages some languages have more consonants or more vowels but again you can't really use that as a basis to argue that one language be basically linguists would argue you can't say that any language be superior than any other language provide they fully use every function
S0227	yeah
S0192	which when you study the language you
S0227	well the
S0192	they ought to
S0227	the ultimate erm er aim for a language be to communicate
S0192	yeah absolutely
S0227	if you're talk in a language that no one else understand you're not communicate you might be talk a language but the person but the recipient doesn't understand what you're say
S0192	i've confuse it a little bite though when i say about pigeons a pigeon be simpler a pigeon be a contact language that be nobody's first language
S0190	yeah that's right a bite of this and a bite of that isn't it
S0227	yeah
S0192	the it's it's structure they have a structure because there be different there's a continuum of pigeons they're eventually a creole be when a pigeon become use as a first language
S0227	yeah
S0192	and it's actually the children that create the grammar but it's part of our language faculty the children realise that they be miss they they don't have the right word for things
S0227	so if
S0192	so they fill it in
S0192	so there be fillers in
S0192	so a creole use to a pigeon a pigeon when it become a first language be therefore need to have every function that every other first language have and it become a creole
S0227	yeah
S0192	so effectively yes you could say a pigeon be simpler but a creole isn't it's no different
S0227	yeah
S0192	how do we get onto this conversation what be we talk about
S0227	er not sure
S0192	i've just reel on
S0227	er probably because i say about bombastic er that
S0192	oh yeah you
S0227	it's a your no
S0192	oh yeah you oh yeah okay so they're not gonna be analyse the kind of word of you're use
S0227	i i know how to use the language but its its construct i
S0192	you have a tacit understand of of language
S0227	yeah your on your knowledge of er the construct be far superior to mine and i have to smile because erm when i leave school although i could speak reasonably well i could not communicate on paper one of my
S0192	whereas that be probably the main part of your job
S0227	a girlfriend teach me how to do that and it's i it take me three go to do it i get a d with it the first time an e the second er my love life's get more complicate
S0227	and that's why i go for down e
S0192	go down the second time on the attempt
S0227	but then a third attempt i get a c it it it please me to know that that from my generation to yours from a person who could not write er because i've be i'd be write what i think be love letter but clearly the recipient be think this be a load of rubbish
S0227	there's no syntax no grammar no nothing and you know in her own way kind of say you can't write which be well for a person of my my ego be gonna be a bite difficult for me to accept but i accept it and say okay teach me she do that enable me to express myself and my progeny be able to
S0190	do it just like that
S0227	to to to be to really analyse the the language and it's and it's
S0192	and it's my job
S0227	yes exactly but when i look back at your father
S0192	yeah
S0227	he come out of the school system and i i didn't know where full stop go commas invert commas semi colons
S0192	yeah i mean that's what should happen shouldn't it
S0227	no nothing
S0192	you should improve on your your your forbearers and you should
S0190	you don't think that if
S0227	well the improvement there be a there be if i hadn't of if i have not
S0192	didn't set the bar too high
S0227	if i have not of erm do that the it would be like you would might as well say that your your father be illiterate i could communicate verbally well i be illiterate i couldn't well i could read i just couldn't write never pick up a
S0192	what do you think about negative concord i don't do nothing when you hear that
S0227	no i i would say i don't do anything not nothing
S0192	yeah that would be what we consider correct the concord
S0190	the correct way of say it
S0227	yeah i'd say anything yeah yes
S0192	do you think negative concord be be bad if you hear somebody say like don't do nothing
S0190	yes well it's not it's not bad be it it just it's it's like say well that's a nice cake we use to get slam something terrible for say write nice because nice be not a good word
S0227	it's not descriptive
S0190	no you can there be so many word in this language think of the one that you could use better there's there's like a lovely
S0192	we do that today with er with intensifiers a lot of people will say oh it's very hot rather than it's scorch there be word to describe very hot
S0190	mm
S0227	yes
S0190	yes
S0192	but we just stick very in front of everything
S0190	yes
S0227	yes
S0192	that's a complaint that teachers have that people aren't use the their poetic
S0190	that's right you have the language there you know make it come stronger pick out better word that will say what you want to say better
S0192	i would agree with that and i don't think a linguist would disagree with that i think you know we do have these word at our disposable one when argue that we do have antonyms but there be no synonyms we'll and although you think that there be synonyms there aren't no two word be exactly identical they have slightly different connotations slightly different register
S0227	mm
S0192	therefore we can use we should and i think i try and study new word and then i think what's the point because if we say it in front of someone they just think i'm a bite of an idiot why why would i use this word be i try to make them sound unintelligent so you end up learn these enormous word and
S0190	yeah but you never know when you're go to do
S0227	i i
S0190	when you're go to be able to use them do you
S0227	yeah
S0190	i mean you throw word in something and i think oh right
S0227	i i do if i
S0190	be this to muck around
S0227	if i if i get upset or i feel erm
S0192	you get corner
S0227	i the my word my i start i find that bigger syllables i remember throw your your grandfather out of out of your mother's flat erm i'd say to him erm don't you cos he be he be right he be spring from a a premise of of correctness he be say your mum be for you i didn't have a job but but they'd invite themselves they know your mum wasn't there they know your mum wasn't there i be there but they invite themselves and you see your nan and your grandad invite themselves er over and they be give me a right lecture about what be i go to do and what be my prospect bugger all they have to be right maybe your grandad have say something and i say don't you think you're be a little overzealous so he kind of come back with something that be completely you know like he didn't you know er understand what i've say of course he completely you know the mean of what i'd say so i have to repeat it and that's when i get on my horse and i say to him right i say if you don't this be before i throw them out i say if you don't understand what i'm say would you like to continue this conversation in spanish i say i'm quite happy to accommodate you in either language i say because either you've lose the argument and it's time for you to go goodbye and throw them out of your mum's flat
S0192	i bet he love you after that
S0227	it take him a few years to forgive me for that yeah but i felt i felt corner and the more corner i felt the more upset i become be start to use big er bigger word because i'd er use the word as weapons against you think you won't actually know what it be i'm talk about it
S0192	and people do that don't they
S0227	and so i use overzealous aspect it be it be in the right connotation for the phrase but he didn't understand what it be i've just say
S0192	yeah
S0227	so er yeah er so i i then become even more bombastic and say right if you can't understand this then why don't we speak in another language i'll accommodate you either way erm but that that's it goodnight
S0192	now the er er type of stylistic variation we accommodate we converge or diverge from the speakers that be around us we usually converge we like to sound more like the people around us so we have an affinity with those people
S0227	i do at work
S0192	but you can also do the opposite you can diverge because right at the moment i'm angry with you and i don't wanna sound like you i want to sound
S0227	yes
S0192	either superior to you or below you or whatever
S0227	yeah sooner er but i don't wanna be inferior
S0192	i don't wanna with you yes
S0227	no you're gonna start to do that
S0192	so that that's convergence back to what i be say about negative concord i don't have nothing sound terrible to us
S0227	yeah
S0192	but in most languages in the world spanish
S0227	yeah
S0192	i don't have nothing
S0227	well yeah yeah
S0192	it's exactly the same translation there be nothing wrong and in fact in middle english we use negative concord grammarians neo grammarians turn around and say that's wrong you can't do that and it's through these er prescriptive grammarians that go around and say an adjective must end l y all these rule that they say didn't reflect the usage of the language and kind of spell as well english orthography there's all sort of things where they eventually get wrong do you know the word debt d e b t
S0227	yes
S0192	they presume so they go back and decide to spell the word and they presume that it be from the latin which be like to owe somebody or other but it wasn't it actually come from germanic so they add a b into the spell incorrectly the spell should just d e t not d e b t
S0227	yes cos it's they so it's
S0192	they do it incorrectly
S0227	it's a it's a very silent b isn't it
S0192	there be lot of things the word knight use to be pronounce it be like a like a
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	lock like a a i think be the original one so old er orthography reflect how we use to pronounce things but now we don't pronounce it like that
S0227	yes so it's go
S0192	so it's why do we have these conventions when i first get with it pain me to hear her say we be
S0227	we be
S0192	she she say not so much anymore because i hey we be you can't say that
S0227	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	she'd say it all the time
S0227	yeah for teach english you can't use that no
S0192	i spend some time with her mum recently her mum do not have the word be in her lexicon she doesn't say it
S0227	no
S0192	she just say i be you be we be
S0227	yeah
S0192	and that's regional that's
S0227	yeah
S0192	part of her dialect that's just
S0227	yeah
S0192	what they do if you go up north there be certain place in scotland that i've read about that use double modal auxiliary verbs modal auxiliary verb can could shall should may might well well would so for example they'll say a sentence i would could do that which to us sound ridiculous
S0227	yes
S0192	i should might be able to which just sound really really wrong to us but actually she fill a bite of a lexical gap because it it give more probability to the rest of the situation so they be actually in a way more astute in what they're say than than we be more accurate or precise
S0227	one thing that that
S0192	but there's nothing wrong linguists er would argue that it's that every dialect er provide they can communicate everything nothing be wrong the
S0190	well always it you have to like you say you have to respect that other people do do speak because er she always say i'll learn you to do this and i'll learn it's i'll teach you
S0227	i'll learn all the time yes yes
S0192	yeah yes
S0190	not i'll learn you to do something
S0227	i the ones that irritate me especially if you hear it on tv people keep say er you know or right and they're use it
S0192	discourse markers
S0227	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0227	you know you know you're right you're right right right right and you're go if you try to write that that would look so wrong
S0192	yeah
S0227	but they're say it well yeah you know i know all about and right and no i'm not agree with you so i use to get use get years ago i'm and this at work not recently but in the distant past some people say i'm sorry you know it's that you're they're argue with you and i say no there's there's no need to apologise
S0192	there's nothing to be sorry about
S0227	yeah you haven't do anything wrong
S0192	yeah
S0227	and that really irritate people what do you mean i'm well you just say you're sorry be didn't you i never say i'm sorry well you
S0227	you haven't do anything wrong so why be you apologise yet they do it it they use the word to go say they're i'm sorry
S0192	have you notice that certain word have take on the opposite mean as well the word literally people use literally now but it actually they're use it to mean figuratively but they'll
S0227	right
S0192	but they'll use it they use it to mean the opposite
S0227	yes
S0192	i literally love that guy that's figuratively
S0227	yes
S0192	but i don't really love him but they use literally to mean the opposite of what it actually mean
S0227	well one the one of the word they don't like
S0192	it's very strange
S0227	that be suppose to be like if you're say that it's really good you now say it's sick
S0192	yeah that's be around for a while yeah
S0227	that's that's ridiculous
S0192	it's a bite of a word
S0227	you see a connection with that a cockney
S0192	i mean we can argue it's ridiculous but be it word change people use different things language vary
S0227	evolve
S0192	i mean it it do evolve it doesn't stop it never never stop
S0190	er it doesn't stop evolve
S0227	oh i think you say fruit
S0192	yeah it's very strange but i have to i have to break down those rule myself because i definitely would tell off when she do that and it's only through formerly study linguistics that i now realise that i shouldn't that she's not incorrect in what she's say i just need to have less of an elitist approach to how people talk and it be elitist cos people struggle to get job that be like
S0190	oh yes yeah
S0192	in these areas so i mean i personally have always really dislike the birmingham accent
S0190	oh yeah yeah
S0192	i think it sound terribly uneducated
S0190	brummie
S0192	yeah like well but apparently it be one of the poorest of areas of england for quite a while and so we have this affiliation with them be poor and therefore their accent be stupid and we just but they've do a test on foreigners and they get foreigners to listen to different british accent they really like the birmingham accent there's no there be nothing negative about the way they speak there be nothing inherently negative about it it's strange
S0190	i think it's again that's one of the things that that's get muddle up and thank you with class and that too because depend on what class you come from as to how you should speak which be the correct way and which be the wrong way
S0192	do you use flat adverbs so for example do you say hold tight or hold tightly
S0192	yeah
S0190	erm that's
S0192	just put them all out and we'll share them all i think
S0227	yeah
S0190	erm
S0192	that be the gulab that one must be my one and that's the
S0192	thank you very much
S0192	have you get a garlic naan as well
S0227	erm back on this
S0190	no i think we must
S0227	it's one of the two
S0192	i think you do
S0190	have you be it
S0227	yeah it's two
S0192	oh no
S0227	no no i
S0190	alright
S0227	no well i'll have a bite
S0192	we've only just get one yes
S0192	excellent
S0190	yes
S0227	yes i didn't get
S0192	well please have some naan
S0227	i i i forget to order a
S0190	no
S0192	lovely thank you
S0190	great
S0227	it's definitely hard to break those barriers down so yeah do you say hold tight or hold tightly
S0192	thank you
S0190	well it depend on what erm what i think i would say hold tight
S0192	that would be incorrect apparently if you follow the conventions of grammar
S0190	oh okay
S0192	you're use an adverb to modify the form hold tightly should be the word speak slowly hold tightly
S0190	yes but if you're
S0192	if you say hold tight
S0190	if you be say you're like if you're put a child onto a ride it sound a bite silly to say hold tightly
S0192	it do yeah
S0190	doesn't it
S0192	but that's not the way we say it
S0190	it's hold tight yeah
S0192	and traditionally in the eighteenth century we use they're call a flat adverbs we and americans use them a lot my friends will often say speak slow they won't say speak slowly
S0227	slowly yeah yeah
S0192	they say speak slow erm i'm actually tempt to do my dissertation in flat adverbs
S0227	mm
S0192	because i've notice more of a usage so i'm tempt to do a synchronic analysis of british public to see whether or not we be use more i can do a synchronic analysis by firstly analyse the youths and then analyse the elderly if the elderly don't do it but the youth do that suggest that it's change
S0227	yeah
S0192	if the elderly don't do
S0227	yeah
S0192	but the youth do so therefore there's synchronic change
S0227	yeah
S0190	would you like some rice
S0192	not much more rice i'm okay thank i've get the the can we share the naan
S0227	yeah there's no mushroom there er
S0192	yeah there be
S0227	well there's not much
S0192	i'm anyway i can eat mushroom i'm just alright without them
S0227	which one's mine i'm not sure
S0192	that one's yours
S0227	oh okay
S0192	but would you like to share
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	if i have a bite of yours
S0227	i think that's why it's good like this cos we can all share that
S0190	would you like some potato this erm sag aloo
S0192	yeah i'll try a little bite it's really difficult to break those those boundaries though isn't it to really look at it and think that's fine that right i still hear the the brummie accent and think that sound awful
S0227	i don't like the brummie accent
S0192	no but what i'm say to be they've do study into use foreigners and although we have a majority view of the the brummie accent
S0227	yeah
S0192	as a people there's no real justification for that
S0227	no
S0192	foreigners will listen to a variety of accent and they actually quite like the birmingham accent there's nothing inherent within the sound that be negative
S0227	no
S0192	it's purely our own negative connotation
S0227	yes yes
S0192	through the society
S0190	so what what be this one
S0192	this be a chicken jalfrezi
S0190	but what be that hot
S0192	tomato bite of spice it's not well shall i try it and then i'll let you know
S0190	yeah what's yours like
S0227	erm erm i can't remember lamb something or other
S0190	no that's chicken that's never lamb that's chicken that's lamb isn't it
S0227	i i've get a bite of either
S0192	i think they're both chicken in here
S0190	oh be they
S0192	yeah they're both chicken
S0190	oh right
S0192	let's see how spicy it be
S0227	oh of course yeah that's chicken yeah
S0190	yeah i be say they don't look sort of
S0227	well it's chicken it's er like chicken on the bone
S0190	that's right yeah
S0192	erm just medium medium spice
S0190	right okay
S0192	yeah i would say
S0227	right well
S0190	i'll eat mine
S0192	please take some naan i can't eat the whole thing
S0190	no i'm fine thank you it's you for the naan
S0192	it's interest how word have change over time as well they've either ameliorate or
S0227	mm
S0192	yeah very strange
S0227	we don't use the word like betwixt no er beget
S0192	we use to have other pronouns like thee thine
S0190	thy
S0227	like thou
S0192	no we don't use them anymore thou yeah
S0227	yeah
S0192	they're only really use now in religious ceremonies
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	they don't really use them otherwise can i have a bite of yours
S0227	yeah go ahead see
S0192	i mean about i think about forty percent of our of our lexicon be norman
S0227	yeah
S0192	of french origin
S0227	mm well it's disperse
S0192	yeah
S0227	it's like french word be like cul de sac erm
S0192	but our grammar be still more germanic
S0227	yeah
S0192	we be of the proto indo european age it's very strange to think that our language be directly connect to india we're of the same language family
S0227	yes
S0192	which i find very strange
S0227	you have er a bungalow er keep these be these be erm indian word
S0192	mm
S0227	you know in our language
S0192	yeah it's quite good
S0227	erm you a lot of people
S0192	that's not because it's of the same family though
S0227	no
S0192	that's cos we've colonise er
S0227	yeah yeah people when they say the house of parliament don't realise that be the french word for
S0192	to speak
S0227	for speak it come from
S0192	yeah parliament
S0227	parliament ment yeah er it erm mayday mayday you know distress come from the french
S0192	m'aidez
S0227	help me can you help me me help
S0192	there's so many aren't there there's
S0227	cos i couldn't understand it before be why a mayday a day in may be a distress
S0192	m'aidez
S0227	then it make perfect sense
S0192	help me
S0227	help me yeah
S0192	i do find etymology quite interest where's the word come from
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	sometimes we don't know we just don't know
S0227	right the fact that you find language interest be what will will help you er excel in it because you
S0192	i couldn't do a master if i didn't find it interest
S0227	no no
S0192	you know it's a bite strange actually to think now if i get now i'm study a master i be effectively a linguist
S0227	yeah
S0192	it's a bite weird to think that
S0227	yeah
S0192	suddenly i'm a linquist what's weird as well be when you tell people you're a linguist they go oh how many languages do you speak
S0227	mm
S0192	but actually quite a few linguists don't speak a variety
S0227	they just speak their own
S0192	we can understand language
S0227	yes
S0192	and we can break down language
S0227	yeah
S0192	but you can't necessarily speak a variety of languages
S0227	no
S0192	however i feel like if i be a linguist then i should be able to speak a few languages
S0227	yeah
S0192	i want to at least be able to speak french and spanish
S0227	yeah apparently if you're educate you know english educate you speak french that's the language you speak
S0192	don't how much french there be though in english
S0227	erm i be discuss with your brother because he be you know come up with a few spanish word that he'd learn while he be over there
S0192	oh that's good
S0227	and he be he be try to
S0192	he's
S0227	say again
S0192	
S0227	er no not at the moment no
S0192	no
S0227	erm i'm study french take me a while for my brain to transpose it
S0192	i speak very good french
S0227	yeah yes you do but erm more importantly i do understand you
S0192	my spanish be very quickly go erm
S0227	sorry
S0192	i'm very quickly lose my spanish
S0227	yes if you don't use it hence that's why i don't speak it so erm in everyday language so it take me a while to transpose what you'd say
S0192	you have to have some respect for translators somebody that can sit there listen to what's be say and they they're translate about five to ten second later
S0227	yeah
S0192	so they're talk or write while they're hear what's be say
S0227	yeah
S0192	they have to not only translate but work out i mean there's all sort of semantic issue of how to change that into that i mean german be very difficult quite often germans be the final language so the verb the predicate the most important part of a sentence come right at the end of a sentence
S0227	yeah
S0192	so you've gotta listen to the whole sentence
S0227	before you know what it be
S0192	before you know what it's about
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	and yet they've gotta translate and they're do it very you know potentially you know there be some very precarious scenarios
S0227	yeah
S0192	and they can't mistranslate this because
S0227	they have to be aware er er a sentence produce wrong could maybe
S0192	could start a war
S0227	yeah exactly yeah
S0192	so it's i i have a lot of respect for that job
S0227	kind of i have no pressure no pressure there then
S0192	it's good though it's tasty
S0190	that'll be yours
S0227	yeah be yours alright please have a bite of ours erm too big
S0190	i've get half of a load of rice there
S0192	yeah
S0190	i'm gonna struggle now i'll let you
S0227	yeah i'll
S0192	can i nick a bite
S0227	no i'm fine mm get mange tout
S0192	i'll take it home then yeah the more i study grammar the deeper it seem to get doesn't seem to be an end to it at the moment
S0227	for that food you're take home one food i never ever want to try again would be er er kimbap

S0192	she claim that it's because she come out as be gay and he didn't want anything to do with her but mum say it be just convenient for both them really
S0227	yeah
S0190	no my erm father's mother my grandmother erm lose her husband when my dad be he be only fifty two not my dad my erm my grandfather so my grandmother she die when she be ninety eight so she have all nearly a half of her life on her own but she become quite friendly with she live she live next door to her sister and she's get like a two younger brothers that live with her as as well and after a while she get friendly with this gentleman who's have also lose his wife and they use to erm go to each other's house for for a meal you know and she'd say oh come and have come back and have some tea or something and mean it as like a social her brothers and sisters or her own but he couldn't they wouldn't accept him
S0192	oh why
S0190	and you just think how can you be so awful for a woman who lose her husband
S0192	she need to move move she need someone
S0190	he need she need someone and you think there be absolutely nothing more to it than just companionship
S0192	and even if there be and if there's be a period of mourn
S0227	yes
S0192	and time have move on
S0227	i be gonna say i
S0192	you can't be alone for the rest of life you can't
S0227	no
S0192	i mean if you're gonna do that you might as well sati the indian style and throw yourself on the funeral pyre
S0227	and and as well yeah
S0190	well if that's what you do and my sister's do fine erm sixteen years now on her own when she lose her husband but that's she's quite happy she doesn't feel it so we respect that and we don't push her into relationships and things but if somebody choose that want to do it then people don't have the right to well to be unkind i think it be
S0192	no i agree
S0227	plus it's not like she with your grandad must have to have this relationship with erm
S0192	no
S0227	you know
S0192	i be stuff
S0227	your mum really once yeah there'd be a a period of mourn should have be quite you know you accept it cos you know if you have any what you expect him to do but than build to build a shrine for him and live life like a hermit
S0192	yeah no that's why i didn't have a problem with it at all
S0227	no
S0192	wouldn't you rather he be happy
S0227	yes
S0190	yeah
S0192	it must be hard enough that he's lose his his love of his life
S0227	yeah that's right yeah
S0192	his other half i can't imagine what that must be like to of course there should be period of er
S0227	oh yes and i i'm sure your grandad he really do have you know so
S0192	i mean he didn't force her anyone i think hopefully he be quite please that i be happy to see her immediately
S0227	yeah
S0192	i i actually make an effort to say i want to see her and
S0227	yeah yeah fine yeah
S0192	i want to chat and so
S0227	well yeah
S0192	i think i meet her in my second year of at uni
S0227	yeah
S0192	so i meet her very early
S0227	yeah
S0192	i mean she's not my nan i don't know who she be really but
S0227	no
S0192	she's make my grandad happy so therefore
S0190	yeah
S0227	by by proxy yes
S0192	but i'm not i don't have such strong emotional tie to people anyway so
S0227	no
S0192	it's difficult it's it's difficult to say it's some people be very emotionally tie up
S0227	yes see i think that your mum and her sister would have be you know it would have be just but not you know insurmountable
S0192	not impossible
S0227	not insurmountable no
S0192	erm
S0190	well and again it to me it's part of if you care for someone you do things to try and things that they
S0192	for them
S0190	yeah for them and things that they they like and if you've get your you're go to make things uncomfortable then well to me i just it's it's
S0192	it's what humility and selflessness be
S0190	yeah
S0192	turn round and go okay i feel this but i can play this down because
S0190	yeah
S0192	my feel don't outweigh your happiness
S0190	that's right definitely that's right
S0227	there's erm although there be fix it seem do do your mum still have some kind of communication i'd imagine
S0192	oh yeah
S0227	there's some become
S0192	so because she go down recently so they meet up with him then
S0227	oh be she stay there then
S0192	no no no nobody stay with them
S0227	oh right
S0192	as far as i know
S0227	but
S0192	well it's the shame because it's the only way i could go and visit him be if he allow me to stay with him
S0227	right yes
S0192	but i don't know if the offer be there or what
S0227	yes erm
S0192	i'm sure it would be i mean he be be a fairly private guy wasn't it
S0227	yeah he be always private yeah
S0192	you can respect that so he'd jar people
S0227	yes probably
S0192	he probably struggle it's so difficulty within our family because we're not a private family
S0227	no no i mean 's completely disappear of the radar the only people that have see him would be his
S0192	yeah in our house in our house now as well basically all the men
S0227	yeah
S0192	just disappear you've disappear from my family very much
S0227	yeah mm
S0192	as i say the cousins still ask after you
S0227	i think when when draw draw his side on which side he be gonna fall he tow the line on that and say you're next
S0192	oh be i it's just a matter of time
S0227	think think think on your position cos you're next
S0192	oh it's him that's react poorly now
S0227	yeah
S0192	the erm he's not build any
S0227	no he
S0192	he have grandchildren right and he's get
S0227	right
S0192	he's he he ignore in the supermarket
S0227	yes i say to about that erm with he he's have the moral high grind cos his daughters actually be be like to be on side of he's go and and be a pariah the the the fact that she's want to do things and he have do absolutely nothing they've go load of those
S0192	the problem be when you have another half that be very demand and
S0227	and influence you yeah for a time
S0192	and i guess from his perspective he think well i've do this part of my life and i need to it's all about me now and she's she's not give him room to have both and he's be weak so he's he's
S0227	yeah i think a near death experience might have yes bring him closer to his family but
S0192	maybe it push him further away rather than push him
S0227	oh yeah i think
S0192	it it seem to
S0227	it it do seem an interest
S0192	come in dear tuck in
S0227	i'm full up it do seem an interest
S0192	full be we sure
S0227	yeah it do seem an interest erm reclamation that erm if you're gonna get the your grandmother's erm generation and then you move down to the daughters all the men be apart well i'd say certain no cos we say be move out because er your mum always talk about her nan she never talk about her grandfather ever
S0192	no erm i don't hear much about him and i also
S0227	what who be he do he exist he must have be there for some some brief time moment in time so that's that be interest
S0192	go on have a small bite of that cake
S0190	no i can't i
S0192	go on you can do it
S0227	i'm gonna have a tiny bite but i'm quite i'm quite i be quite full
S0192	a little bite there it's just a little bite look i i've do a good job on there actually see the trick be can you do it with one hand
S0227	no
S0192	you can't use both
S0227	no i can't
S0192	if you're in india you can't use both
S0190	why not
S0192	they this be
S0227	one hand for the toilet one hand for the
S0192	so you take the naan and rip it with your hand and eat out of it
S0190	oh no
S0192	you can't use two
S0227	that's why in who do you think you be they anything with the families be consider erm impolite
S0192	it take a while to get
S0227	oh go on
S0190	no thank you
S0192	it's also very messy as well i mean certain part of india i eat curry with my hand
S0227	mm
S0190	yeah we be watch it on the television when they be travel around yeah
S0227	southern india
S0192	yeah southern india
S0190	oh like yeah you i
S0192	you get it on a banana leaf
S0190	yeah
S0227	yeah
S0192	you get the banana leaf and then you get all your stuff and then you have a little bowl of water to wash your hand in and
S0227	yeah and then you throw the leaf in
S0192	it's i mean it's tasty the around there they argue that half of the flavour be in the texture and i mean to an certain degree when i eat an apple you know half of you know i enjoy hold it and i enjoy eat it so i i can understand that to a certain you wouldn't wanna eat a burger with a knife and fork would you it would just be weird
S0227	mm
S0192	part of the process be hold it
S0227	yeah
S0192	and eat it so they just feel the same about eat curry but it be a very messy affair it's not like a burger
S0190	i don't think it's very yeah a burger's dry
S0192	so it take some get use to to to be a
S0227	and also it can't be too hot either can it
S0192	no
S0227	if that's in your hand
S0190	but don't you find that that the only fault that i've have with this restaurant be that the food be not pip hot
S0192	it's not no well
S0227	didn't it come on hot trays
S0190	yeah
S0227	it's er it's still for hot
S0192	i mean korean food quite often come out in a ceramic clay pot still bubble and you'll get it out and it'll bubble for another couple of minutes while it's sit it's actually kind of tedious because you want it
S0190	yeah
S0192	and you have to wait for it to stop bubble and then another few you know five minutes longer
S0190	the two or three dish they bring out you can hear them sizzle in the pot when they bring them
S0192	i guess they do that to prove that it's be cook here and now and it it's
S0227	yeah yes it's er what's the word er be it a la carte
S0192	no there's quite a few
S0227	erm
S0192	food options in korea as well
S0227	yeah
S0192	that be cold have you ever have cold noodles
S0227	no i haven't
S0192	it's very strange
S0227	be it quite rubbery

S0190	we don't eat human things do you it's
S0192	no no it's
S0227	well i don't know
S0227	well if you watch hannibal of all there be an interest erm okay it's fictitious but there's some interest
S0192	i imagine doesn't like that
S0227	scene with erm do know like eddie izzard
S0192	yes yes he's in quite a bite suddenly yeah
S0227	yes where erm he's it's the last supper
S0192	oh he's eat himself be he
S0227	yeah the last supper yes that be interest
S0192	yeah
S0227	cos he have no option really do he
S0192	if you don't like some of the other things don't watch if you don't like and hannibal be a bite
S0190	no quite a lot of them erm that's why i have my own room with my own television in and i
S0192	hannibal be extreme but it's quite tastefully do at the same time
S0227	it's quite clever yeah
S0192	but it be extreme i mean very unbelievable extremely unbelievable
S0227	which hannibal have you watch and see as in erm anthony hopkins
S0192	yeah
S0227	play hannibal lecter the hannibal you're present with be the man who's get catch and
S0192	yes
S0227	all you're see be his ability to manipulate
S0192	i'm interest to see how the new hannibal be once he's be catch
S0227	yes
S0192	how
S0227	because the hannibal you see in in hannibal be the man who's not be catch
S0192	charismatic
S0227	and you're see his charisma
S0192	his culture and education
S0227	his culture his education to be honest he come over as be completely sane but clearly
S0192	too sane
S0227	yeah but clearly he's not
S0192	much too sane
S0227	yeah it it's
S0192	it be quite good
S0227	it be clever yeah
S0192	i mean it's it's quite enough
S0227	but it's gory but it's clever
S0192	have you see have you see rome
S0227	sorry
S0192	rome
S0227	no
S0192	i think maybe you'd like that certainly the first season of rome be excellent it's really really good whoever the guy the actor that play caesar be fantastic
S0227	oh
S0192	absolutely fantastic it's the story of erm caesar's rise to power after gaul and the
S0227	you mean julius caesar
S0192	yeah and then yeah not octavia or
S0227	yeah right
S0192	erm and then erm mark antony have his side and then he eventually be stab by brutus and othello
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	the senate and that kind of stuff
S0227	yeah
S0192	it's it's really very well act it's all british actors and it's it's really quite it's very really well act a little gory in place
S0190	no it's not that
S0192	and a little sexual in place but it's not
S0190	if it's in
S0192	there's not much swear
S0190	part of the story as and again it's part of it i don't if it's when every other word's a swear word
S0192	yeah no i
S0190	or it's just so
S0192	i agree
S0190	certain language and certain things and i think just i just don't believe they should be on
S0227	in
S0192	i i'm quite
S0227	in hannibal there be no swear be there
S0192	not a lot
S0227	no not and there's certainly not come
S0190	well hannibal be so far fetch it's unbelievable
S0227	it's it's certainly not
S0192	hannibal be very slow
S0227	yeah
S0192	it's really slow pace
S0227	it yeah watch about
S0192	it's very very slow
S0227	fifteen minutes of the first one and make her mind up on the strength of that
S0190	that be enough yeah
S0192	yeah okay
S0227	which be be
S0192	well try rome i'd recommend it
S0227	it's not into character developments
S0192	it it kick start this out the it's of a similar vein and be make
S0227	yeah
S0192	at the same time
S0227	yeah
S0192	but it's just much much better act
S0227	yeah
S0192	i be really quite engross in the first season i'm watch the second season now and since erm julius caesar have die i think it's lose a lot bite that actor be very good
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	er actually he's in game of throne the man that play caesar which
S0227	which part do he play
S0192	well he's one of the guy on the wall that die quite early
S0227	oh right so he's
S0192	yeah you'd recognise him if you saw him but
S0227	right yeah
S0192	but he's such he's such a good caesar
S0227	right yeah
S0192	the character be really good i really really like him erm
S0227	i'm look forward to hannibal the next
S0192	the third
S0227	the season three
S0192	yeah
S0227	it's season three they've get obviously they have to catch him at some time
S0192	yes well season four be red dragon
S0227	right
S0192	manhunter
S0227	yes
S0192	season five be silence of the lamb season six be hannibal
S0227	right
S0192	season seven be so we've get one more season of his own division
S0227	yeah
S0192	and then it's go to follow more closely it's obviously gonna deviate quite dramatically from erm
S0227	yeah
S0192	but erm
S0227	they say he be when he be with jodie foster er anthony hopkins right he be catch he be he all you saw of him be his his his manipulation and not any of those other the
S0192	no the characteristics
S0227	and i say l like the actor mads mikkelsen cos he play he's so culture that's the trouble he be immaculate his cook he's a he's like a michelin style equivalent
S0192	what be that dish i've come across it a couple of time with that bird that use the very small bird and then they soak it in er alcohol and they set fire to the it's like a foetus of a bird and and then they eat the thing whole they do it
S0227	yeah i can't remember what it's call
S0192	it's kind of famous like
S0227	yes
S0192	i it be or something else
S0227	yes always try meals from all over the world but
S0192	yeah right
S0227	the the thing with him be i his clothe he's always immaculate
S0192	his outfit
S0227	he's immaculately dress yeah he's he's he never have anything out of place he's
S0192	but that make him very suspicious
S0227	yes he's very meticulous er
S0192	he be unbelievable yeah he's unbelievable
S0227	yeah he be too good to be
S0190	the whole series be just totally
S0227	he's too
S0192	yeah i
S0227	he's too good to be true
S0192	oh oh and the the most jar thing for me in that season be especially the first season there's a different serial killer in every every episode and yet they don't ever have to drive more than five miles to
S0227	they're always home grow aren't they
S0192	they just happen to have
S0227	yeah home grow
S0192	twenty serial killers or
S0227	who live in about a two hundred mile radius yeah i mean
S0192	it's entertain
S0227	although
S0192	it's very grotesque
S0227	although
S0192	and the dialogue's good and i like dialogue so
S0227	they they they reckon that there be point one percent of the population be serial killers which mean there be three hundred in the state at any time
S0192	yeah
S0227	not psychopaths psychopaths they reckon in er in in in america there's about erm
S0192	anyone would be
S0227	to about thirty million
S0192	point one i mean if there's three hundred million people
S0227	yeah
S0192	one percent would be three million
S0227	yeah
S0192	point one percent would be
S0227	three
S0192	thirty thousand
S0227	oh oh be it nought point one er how many noughts have you get to take off er nought
S0192	regardless
S0227	one hold it one
S0192	let's just say there's about three hundred
S0227	yeah there's three hundred
S0192	it's easier yeah
S0227	there's about three hundred
S0192	cos if there's about three hundred million people
S0227	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0227	cos i'm think one percent of three hundred million be
S0192	be three hundred
S0227	three million
S0192	so
S0227	isn't it
S0192	point one percent of three million isn't three hundred
S0227	it's for the no so it's point nought point one percent yeah which they no nought point nought nought one percent
S0192	yeah yeah
S0227	yeah
S0192	we're get into maths now aren't we
S0192	yeah nought point nought nought one percent yeah
S0227	how's your maths then
S0190	diabolical
S0227	yeah yeah
S0190	absolutely diabolical
S0192	mine too
S0227	yeah it's
S0192	it's as long i can do quick calculations

S0192	it's m b you're right yeah
S0190	isn't it so the e make it say
S0192	traditionally we add the e to show the the longer vowel which i learn again when i be
S0227	there be some nutty things in the english language erm one of them i'll say it in spanish and see if you can translate you should be able to erm
S0192	man of the spider spider of
S0227	yes now how can a spider be more important than a man so really it should be a man of spider not spider of man but it doesn't you know in english you go that would sound wrong
S0192	but in compound the head be the second one blackbird isn't a type of black it's a type of bird
S0227	yeah
S0192	so the second compound
S0227	yeah
S0192	when you stick them together so spider man
S0227	yeah
S0192	it's a type of man not a type of spider
S0227	yeah
S0192	blackbird be type of bird
S0227	yeah you would think it would be
S0192	we put the stress on the second one because that's what it
S0227	yeah yeah you would think the stress should be on the first and not the second
S0192	yeah i know what you're say whereas in spanish the genitive you'd have to say man of the
S0227	yeah they'd say
S0192	spider
S0227	the man of spider
S0192	okay
S0192	yeah thank you very much
S0227	thank you

S0190	yeah
S0192	thank you very much
S0190	thank you
S0227	and three spoon
S0227	erm it would be interest when erm 's learn some french when i see her again i'll
S0192	yeah
S0227	give her a bite the
S0192	she's not bless her she's not amaze at pick up languages
S0227	mm
S0192	she's okay
S0227	mm
S0192	i definitely pick it up quicker than she do i'd say i speak double the amount of spanish that she do she know the same amount but she's not confident and i think that's partially my own fault because while our travel be a man i be approach a lot more than she be and therefore i have more practice so
S0227	yeah and so you're do the talk yeah
S0192	i be speak
S0227	yeah you're do the talk
S0192	so it's not necessarily i guess that's wrong to say that she's not as good i've have more practice than she have so my spanish be better
S0227	mm
S0192	if we're go for elitist my speech be better than hers it really jar when we be first together every time she say something wrong it be oh mm she occasionally use like but it's from her family
S0227	yes
S0192	her parent aren't
S0227	it's a colloquial colloquial erm
S0192	her parent aren't particularly well educate so
S0227	no
S0192	it's kind of past
S0227	don't worry neither be yours
S0192	like
S0192	not terribly as you say if you get better each time then er i mean can you imagine if i get a phd do you ever think you'd have a son that could potentially
S0227	yeah i mean i have to say
S0192	now i'm not say i will but just
S0227	my son because
S0192	yeah
S0227	because you must have well i must have be the nuisance
S0192	your son your son
S0192	i'm not say i will i may not succeed in an ma yet
S0227	yeah
S0192	i have
S0227	yeah
S0192	as so far
S0227	you have aspirations
S0192	as so far for the last ten years everything i've say i'm gonna do i've do so hopefully
S0227	well i think in
S0192	if i continue along that route
S0227	i think in our lineage
S0190	i think you stand a good chance of do it because you enjoy it
S0192	yeah
S0190	basically
S0227	well that's you're halfway there erm you're go to be the most erm in our family line i haven't do my family tree yet but i and this be just a presumption but you're probably go to be the most educate and the most travel but none of our in our our ancestors my side or your mother's will have travel as far as you have because we would have take years to do that
S0192	yeah i mean i come from a time where i can
S0227	yeah i mean yes i've be to i've be to i've be to er california i've be to mexico i've have the spray of niagara on my face in canada i've be to and i'm not and i'm not even worry about europe i've be to taiwan
S0192	which would and quite a few countries be and in europe and see
S0190	oh yeah
S0227	i've be to taiwan i've be to korea
S0192	but include layer that
S0227	but i haven't you know be as far as you have you know i haven't be as many place in your lifespan
S0192	i count the other day i've be to forty one countries
S0227	yeah
S0192	it's quite a few
S0227	yeah
S0192	for twenty eight rather it's quite a few
S0227	do we count wales and spain er like wales and scotland
S0192	i count i haven't be to scotland i count wales i've only be to cardiff but
S0227	oh right
S0192	but i count it
S0227	it that that
S0192	like forty one
S0227	yeah so that's two er do do you count england in that at all or not
S0192	yes
S0227	yeah so that's three erm that's erm er spain mallorca majorca tenerife gran canaria and i think
S0192	be tenerife a country
S0227	yeah they're different islands aren't they
S0192	be they countries though
S0227	no they're different islands though they're islands
S0192	aren't they own by spain though
S0227	yeah but they're like they're about eight hundred
S0192	oh not sure that that count as a country
S0227	they're eight hundred miles away
S0192	oh i'm not sure if it count as a country though dad
S0227	er
S0227	taiwan er
S0192	it's debatable what a country be
S0190	fuerteventura
S0227	say er you go fuerteventura lanzarote tenerife and gran canaria
S0192	add four
S0227	that's four
S0190	canaria
S0227	gran canaria
S0190	no it's not canaria
S0227	canaria canaria
S0190	it it's with i a
S0227	alright a canaria okay that's four because there be four different islands that be separate by quite a bite of water
S0192	but then i could argue you know i go to the andaman islands i go to little andaman i go to button island i go to neil island
S0227	oh oh yeah
S0192	i go to ross island i go to

S0227	okay so if i count all those four as one alright i'll oh
S0190	no let's really not do that
S0227	there be scotland england
S0190	but then you could say that about the british isles it's just one country because there's no you need water between them
S0190	yeah
S0227	no it's effectively three countries that's the unite kingdom
S0192	it's it's one country and four countries actually

S0227	well that that that
S0192	but that's greece it's just like greece

S0227	yes
S0190	mm
S0192	i haven't meet anyone that's kind of be
S0227	yeah it's a
S0190	and you see the culture that you like that you've see
S0227	i i can't i can't i can't compete to it i think it's safe to say
S0192	if you can imagine if we keep go because
S0227	yes
S0192	i mean potentially in two years we're gonna go to africa
S0227	yeah
S0192	and when we go to africa we're probably gonna do another ten countries over a year i would imagine
S0227	yeah the one that's really well travel
S0192	what's it gonna be like when we're forty
S0227	be the queen she have be to a hell of a lot of countries erm
S0192	i'm not sure if she's rough quite as well as the
S0227	no not at all
S0227	erm so
S0190	i don't think somehow she'd be on the beach you know
S0227	if you go down both
S0192	get mug
S0227	if you go down both both your parents' lineage i can't see any of your er our ancestors who have be to so many countries there's no way how would they they'd have spend all of their life travel they'd have never have be here they'd never have once they be bear here and be get to the age of eighteen they never come back because
S0192	so there you go and regardless of get marry or have children i've make my mark i have two superlatives in the name
S0227	yes
S0192	most countries perhaps if i get my master and potentially a phd most educate
S0227	yes well you're the most educate now
S0192	that's
S0190	you're the only one with a degree
S0192	be there nobody in our family that's get a degree nobody
S0227	no
S0192	
S0227	no er i my my
S0192	there's no in 's family either
S0227	my my highest accolade be erm i've get i have a level equivalents
S0192	be this gonna be nice
S0190	go on have a go go and taste it
S0227	no i have a level equivalents
S0192	it's dad's birthday he should really first be it like a mousse or be it
S0227	er er
S0192	oh it be quite firm isn't it how sweeten
S0227	it's quite sweet but it's nice it cut through mm mm
S0192	be this what you
S0227	yeah
S0190	mm
S0192	be there like something on the bottom
S0190	yeah
S0192	it's good
S0227	it's quite still quite hard
S0192	hold it steady go on birthday boy you're go to have the chocolate gosh i just try it sorry and hold it steady there we go
S0227	yeah they do go with a spicy meal cut it clean the palate
S0192	there's a dessert in india that i use to hate
S0190	you use to hate
S0192	yeah i absolutely hat it it it come it's not really a dessert it come it's like a i don't know a digestif of some sort it's not a drink but at the end of every meal they bring it out in a plant of some sort it's very aniseedy i'm not i don't know if it be aniseed but it's like seed and it just taste like aniseed and you eat it with sugar so you get like a handful of sugar and a handful of these seed and everyone eat it after every meal a square pretty much the entire country over everyone i've never see it anywhere outside of india it be horrible i really didn't like it quite often there'd be ants in the sugar
S0190	oh
S0192	and they'd put some sugar on your hand and you've get like ants in there and stuff and you've get to blow the ants out but you know when you get sick and the last thing you eat have you ever have this experience
S0227	yeah
S0192	and you just go off it like you really just
S0227	what cause you to be sick
S0190	yeah
S0192	i remember i get i mean obviously i be ill quite a few time in india and and one of the time i associate it with this and after that and the problem be it be rude to turn it down they'd often just put it in your hand afterwards and you'd be like oh i really don't want
S0190	oh dear
S0192	yeah i drop it they'd just give you more i think
S0190	well you
S0227	do you not like aniseed
S0192	i don't mind aniseed i don't have a problem with aniseed but
S0227	no er or the only reason i'm say that be it's interest because that when we go to france your mum and i we didn't realise that she be pregnant with you she have pernod which be aniseed base and she be violently sick
S0192	oh
S0192	so maybe that's why then
S0227	yes that could be a reason why you don't like aniseed
S0192	it's possible i've go off a few things though because of be sick i tell you one of the worst experience i've ever have be be sick on a camel safari in the desert in india and they camp us downwind from these terribly flatulent camels it be horrible i be so ill and like everything taste bad my own be bad the all we have to eat be chapatti and a bite of dal and i just remember these camels keep fart and it be just horrible and we be sleep out in the open as well you have like a scarab beetle like dung beetle like go around yourself
S0227	yes yes
S0192	i just i remember think at that point i wanna be at home in my bed just like lie in the desert
S0227	camels go on safari
S0192	yeah i know yeah
S0227	because we've be on there without the
S0192	we have be on yeah
S0227	yeah
S0192	i'm not sure if that be quite a safari but
S0227	no but
S0190	it be er no across the dun wasn't it
S0227	it be on camels it be on camels and it be in the dun yeah yes cos we saw that didn't we we go the camel place we never go on a camel
S0190	we do what be it call
S0227	erm it be on gran canaria i can't remember what it be call
S0190	and that
S0227	but there be lot of big lizards there weren't there
S0190	yeah lot of
S0192	yeah camels be terribly uncomfortable
S0190	mm
S0192	if you actually have to sit on one for hours it be horrible i have a really old one for
S0192	a really old and bony one er
S0227	i think it's just arab habit because er the health and safety's out the window
S0192	with him stand on the elephant
S0227	and the tent it's like if you you couldn't do that in this country
S0192	oh you couldn't do a lot of things we've do
S0227	yeah

S0227	be that like in its sleep when it's
S0192	yeah i i've be in a few instance that i've definitely think i could perhaps die this be not good i actually have one experience where i really think i be go to die i genuinely think i be go to die have you ever hear of a band sea krait it's a type of snake

S0192	yeah a band sea krait
S0227	that that's a very
S0192	very very very poisonous snake it's
S0227	yeah
S0192	it's like the most poisonous snake in the world i've see them three time first time they swim around my feet in the andaman isles most remote the remotest place i've ever be swim around my feet didn't quite know what it be at the time second time i be scuba dive and it be curl up just like beautiful snake really really beautiful third time it swim to the surface take a breath and then go back down under the water really again very beautiful i've be tell and i always hear david attenborough's voice in my head you know the voice of god that if you get bite by this snake you'll die within about
S0227	not long at all
S0192	ten second to a minute
S0227	yeah
S0192	it's get such a powerful neurotoxin but because its prey can swim away fast
S0227	yeah so it need
S0192	so it need something that
S0190	stun it yeah
S0227	that kill it quick yeah
S0192	you know can yeah very quickly but they're quite docile and their mandible their mouth be very small so they can't and they be quite small they have a small head they can only bite you here and here and maybe in between your toe they can't get their mouth around another part of you
S0227	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	i be scuba i be sorry snorkelling in erm indonesia and 's not a very strong swimmer so quite often she didn't she doesn't come out with me and i don't actually like snorkelling on my own
S0227	no
S0192	if i have somebody else with me i be infinitely more confident
S0227	yeah
S0192	than when i'm on my own and it be very murky and i felt like suddenly i get hit numerous time by something and i kind of panic and swim in and i come out and i saw two teeth mark here right on my hand where it know that it could be bite no joke and i stand there my heart be race
S0227	yeah
S0192	and i say to i think this be it i think i've be bite by one of those i think this be me go and for the next five minutes i really think i be gonna die and i just stand there like
S0227	be there any blood
S0192	sweat there be a little bite there be two pin prick like
S0227	yeah
S0192	i mean it look perfectly like two teeth
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	but in hindsight when it happen i actually pull something out of it and i think what happen be when i felt like i get hit by a few things i think i get hit by a shoal of fish and i think you know fish have spin on their back
S0227	yeah
S0192	i think two of the spin be in my hand but it be just conveniently exactly like two fangs
S0227	yeah
S0192	and i i tell you what i just didn't react very much but in internally i be freak
S0227	you want to suck the poison out
S0192	and i be kind of go this be it
S0227	yeah
S0192	i'm i've go
S0227	yeah
S0192	and i be think to myself at least if i die now i'll die happy to a certain degree
S0227	yeah
S0192	but this could be it
S0227	suck the poison out
S0192	i really think i really think that be it it take a good it take half an hour
S0227	yeah
S0192	cos in your head you're go okay maybe maybe a minute's an exaggeration maybe it'll be five minutes
S0227	yeah
S0192	maybe it'll be ten minutes
S0227	yeah
S0192	ten minutes pass oh maybe half an hour and it's
S0192	it be horrible absolutely horrible
S0227	how many days have pass before you say i think i'm in the clear
S0192	yeah
S0192	i tell you i mean the andaman islands where i say they be literally it's i mean maybe you could go to some island in the middle of the pacific and it would be more remote
S0227	yeah
S0192	but these islands be a thousand miles off the coast of india they're south of myanmar which doesn't exactly have many tourists anyway
S0227	no
S0192	erm they still have cannibals they use to be call the cannibal isles there be tribes on these islands that we've never have any contact with you know those videos where you see a helicopter fly over and they're throw the spear and stuff that's there that's on the andaman islands we be swim on these this most beautiful beach i've ever be on and the it wasn't until a few months later that we actually read an article somebody on that beach get eat by a salt water crocodile three months after we be there
S0227	yeah
S0192	and everyone be say you know why haven't they put sign up like you need to be and other people be say this be one of the most remote place in the world like
S0227	yeah
S0192	how can you put a sign up
S0227	yeah
S0192	when there's no one there
S0227	yeah
S0192	i actually get sting there by erm have you ever hear of fire coral it's a type of coral that lay a live creature in you effectively and if you scratch it it spread
S0190	mm
S0192	i didn't know what it be at the time and it i wake up with my arm on fire after i'd be scuba dive in this area it last for about two or three weeks it be like thousands of of mosquito bite like
S0227	yeah
S0192	all over my arm it be horrible absolutely horrible it's only in hindsight that i realise how kind of dangerous that area be
S0227	yeah
S0192	that we be in
S0227	yeah
S0192	and like i look at a map of where salt water crocodiles be and it be there this be one of their most prolific areas and like they grow up the biggest salt water crocodile ever seven metres
S0227	yeah they're big
S0192	well two metres
S0227	yeah
S0192	can you imagine a a crocodile that's three and a half time the size of dad
S0190	well we be watch erm on the the other night weren't we impossible creatures
S0227	erm
S0192	and that be crocodiles and this one it be absolutely huge what be it suppose to be bigger than what
S0227	it be about erm it be erm about erm a thousand pound in weight be what the biggest crocodile
S0192	i imagine these be quite similar
S0190	absolutely massive
S0192	it seem er ridiculous but they exist
S0190	yeah
S0227	oh yeah
S0192	real salt water crocodile exist they're all off the i be crawl around on my belly in the mudflats and mangroves of calcutta and around the area of the sundarbans which i only find out in hindsight be notorious for massive salt water crocodiles
S0227	yeah
S0192	and there's i go on a tour you know i mean i call it a tour but it's very low key wishy washy and we they take us into the mangroves and they're like yeah you can just slide around on the mud and stuff we be tell there be crocodiles there but we didn't know the extent it's only in hindsight you get any
S0227	i do think when erm about two weeks ago it be on the news that erm a couple an english couple
S0192	oh yeah i hear about that
S0227	they get kill in thailand

S0192	yeah i be just say yeah yeah it be in thailand
S0190	oh right sorry i be watch yeah and that's where be there
S0192	i've be there i spend quite a while on koh tao we hear about these things and i mean i be in ba√±os in ecuador erm a couple of months after i leave it er it erupt the volcano erupt and they evacuate the whole city and like load of people die
S0227	so
S0192	i've be in a couple of place where massive volcanoes have erupt like
S0227	like erm three four nine where from erm erm from malaysia where you be that
S0192	that be only a few days prior
S0227	yeah
S0192	yeah and i fly almost exactly the same route
S0190	and then we be wait
S0192	yeah
S0190	he say oh shall we go where and and er where
S0192	couple of days couple of days later the same same journey
S0190	yeah
S0192	same flight go off
S0227	mm
S0192	there's be a few instance i mean you only have to come close to england er sorry seventh of the seventh the london bomb i be mean to be in london in kings cross at that time
S0227	yeah
S0192	i be go to see a gig with the only reason that we didn't go be he wake up late
S0227	right
S0192	so we get to the train station as just as it have be bomb and they wouldn't let us on the train
S0227	no
S0192	er we sit in a pub and watch the whole thing unfold but we be we'd organise to be on the seven o'clock train or the seven thirty train to go to london and we should have be on in
S0227	yeah
S0192	there's a a few instance now where you think whoa
S0227	yes
S0192	a month earlier or a few hours earlier that would have
S0227	mm i think it fate dictate when you when when it's your time it's your time and that's it
S0192	it's your time yeah
S0227	and that's it yeah you have these nine live
S0192	yeah but 's bad on flight you wouldn't think so would you with the amount of fly that
S0227	no she no she's i want to go to the loo again she's
S0192	she's not terrible but
S0227	she's fly a lot
S0192	she's erm
S0190	but don't you think sometimes
S0227	but she use to statistician
S0192	yeah it's statistics
S0227	where she's look at yeah yeah
S0192	cos you start think well i've be on this a few time now
S0227	yeah yeah
S0190	yeah that's the trouble though you've be haven't you and the more you've be you've be the more you tend to realise just what you've put yourself in for but then you have to weight that up in for the same reason drive on a bus or walk down the street
S0192	absolutely
S0190	the chance of that be higher of that than on a plane so
S0192	i mean in nepal we be only about twelve cars behind a humungous avalanche that i mean people must have die in it because there be a village there and i couldn't see a village er the whole side of the mountain collapse and the road have collapse and we have to wait for about three or four hours while diggers undug the road but our bus be only about twelve vehicles behind the the collapse so i mean
S0190	yes
S0192	i be about twelve vehicles away from a landslide i don't know how many how much time that be i mean it could have be one vehicle every five minutes it could have be a vehicle every couple of minutes it could have be half an hour or it could have be five minutes but all i know be you walk up to it and you look at it and go literally the whole mountain be go you could see roof like poke out and stuff so there be people in there i'm literally stand where people have die it be bad another time in nepal i didn't know but the whole area have flood i go to an area that be like you know a refugee camp there be like tent like aid tent and like dead buffalo in the water and all this kind of stuff and it be it be horrific to try and travel really it be like i spend about twelve hours try to get through
S0190	i think it make it must make you feel i should say really lucky
S0192	yeah
S0190	in that some people suffer so much and see so much in in their live
S0192	yeah i feel very privilege i do feel very privilege
S0190	yeah
S0192	it also help me to feel connect i think with these people as well to have be and see and to talk to them and to be there and to just realise that there be big differences between us but there be much more similarities between us between culture but i i probably will die do something i like at some point but if i do
S0190	but you will have enjoy it
S0192	yeah know that i die happy
S0190	well it's like my dad you know my mum be be i think part of it be because when you've live with somebody or have a partner for such a long long time you just rely on them to be there i mean the think of one one lose the other and one of them be leave be something but my mum tend to get sort of like over protective and my dad keep turn around and say well he would much rather die do something that he love than sit around or lay in a hospital bed
S0192	yeah
S0190	so you know it like his ski he'd love to ski again he know he can't do anything like he use to because he'd go down a black run erm and what have you but and it's like
S0192	and skiing's really dangerous
S0190	yeah it can be yeah
S0192	it's not that safe yeah
S0190	erm what else be you horse rid he really and truthfully at eighty three to go out on the roads and ride his horse then you've get to have one of these arctic
S0192	be he still do it
S0190	oh he still do it
S0192	oh wow
S0190	yeah and it's only like
S0192	that's phenomenal
S0190	if a lorry go down the side be the horse drop in front of it he's go but he love it he's love horse from when he be a little boy and that i mean i be bring up in a saddle be sit on the in a basket on the back of a horse and what have you that's how he be and he enjoy it you take all these things away unfortunately he now he he doesn't ride quite as much he hasn't be ski and he like his in here so he's get a more sedate kind of thing but
S0192	i mean you take it away for that person then the live doesn't look an absolute joy anymore and what's the point
S0190	no that's precisely it and that's how it should be the end of your life you've work so hard and you've do all these things but he's still work now so i mean he's still and he deserve
S0227	he's still go yeah and he he's suppose to be retire but he's not
S0190	he he's begin to they're you know and like be say cos she's erm you know they're they're try desperately hard and they wanna get go far so they can drop dad's hours right back down like he'd get to sort of like a odd day a week because at eighty three he's get tire
S0227	yeah and you can see it
S0192	what's he work i mean at eighty three most people aren't work
S0190	i know
S0227	most people be dead
S0192	well
S0227	never mind work
S0190	but to me that's him he's always be that way he can't sit for very long he do a bite more now because he's be busy with the work and he's retire and what have you
S0192	i mean it's it's be active that keep some people go isn't it yeah
S0190	well that's what it be it's true yeah they say once you stop do something you get off and you won't restart it
S0192	i can imagine that
S0227	yeah he's very he's very good for his age isn't he compare to
S0190	oh god mind you 's a lot better than he wasn't isn't he now
S0227	yes
S0190	he really be
S0227	but er but if you
S0190	you're not allow to smoke in here be you
S0192	i be gonna er
S0227	yeah
S0190	oh right you've prepare it
S0192	would would you mind
S0190	no i don't go on
S0227	compare with your dad even though he's improve he's still er be not in the same league as
S0190	as no no
S0227	no he doesn't
S0190	yeah but then er in all fairness give him his due my dad have and a quarter of what 's have my dad have be very lucky when my dad go he have doctor for
S0227	he hadn't be for sixty years
S0190	oh well and my mum make him go because he have a cyst
S0227	a
S0190	didn't he

S0190	a sebaceous cyst behind his his up here and
S0192	yeah and on my head too
S0227	yeah
S0190	on the top of his ear
S0192	like this
S0190	yeah we've have this discussion before
S0227	your mum's get
S0192	the whole family's get one here it's like a divorce bump
S0227	yes your mum's get one yes yes
S0192	or something i don't know what it be
S0227	er i don't know if your mum's
S0192	do you know what i mean even if you're like
S0227	your mum's have hers treat or not your mum have one before me and it be on her head in the same place
S0192	it's weird it's like some flesh colour mole or something

S0227	yes lance that's what i be say lance
S0190	oh sorry i think you say lanched
S0227	no lance
S0192	lanched lanched
S0190	lance yeah
S0227	i have it lance by well so that be the first time he's be for one
S0190	yeah why they they hadn't get any any record of him though and but at the doctor
S0192	that's fantastic
S0227	he hadn't be for about sixty years
S0190	he's be so lucky
S0192	that's pretty healthy
S0190	but
S0227	for the last ten years have be
S0190	he didn't have anything he never have anything and all of a sudden wham so
S0192	you've just gotta i mean people and different people enjoy do different things and provide you continually if you can continue do what you enjoy then
S0190	yeah that's right or you have to get something out of life
S0192	yeah and it's it be different for different people i mean for a long time i struggle with the idea you know i enjoy this so much how can you not and i guess as i've get older i realise that you know not everyone be the same so what i may find pleasurable other people don't find pleasurable but i do struggle with for a while i do struggle would you mind if i have a cigarette
S0227	no
S0192	be that alright shall i stop this or will you guy continue talk
S0190	yeah you stop it
S0227	no we won't talk to each other when you're go will we
S0190	we don't talk
S0192	you don't talk i'm gonna leave it on and i'll listen when i go home and see what you say
S0227	you're gonna be disappoint
S0190	i feel like
S0227	er however much er
S0192	if i just do it
S0227	yeah yeah it's restart again
S0190	he tell me have
S0227	pressure pressure
S0190	i'm surprise he he be say that erm he be anxious you know he he they go through a a session be anxious about things things have settle down now at uni and he feel better but i find i find that very difficult to that he just find something to be anxious about
S0227	mm what after he's do everything he's do
S0190	yeah
S0227	yeah
S0190	you know he's so you know
S0227	i think it manifest in this at the start cos he he he be incline to agree that when like start i say i think it's it's nerve and it's not he doesn't think it's nerve but it's his body react
S0190	oh yes it be
S0227	and he say yeah i think so because i think i've go through something similar go back to uni now that my i would say like your stomach and stuff like that you may think that consciously that there's no problem but subconsciously you might your body be go er these be change er and i'm respond to those change in the way that you know yeah he go really
S0190	have have you er have you speak to at all
S0227	no he hasn't yeah i do feel a bite the last time he email be a couple of days ago
S0190	do he say whether he's go to the doctor and how his stomach be
S0227	no no have mention in his email to him cos it be a global email er to his mum and but doesn't mention it
S0190	well he obviously he do feel a bite better
S0227	mm but i never i can't i accept that but i'm surprise i didn't get an email or a phone call from him er when i say
S0190	well you be part have yourself
S0227	you don't have to give me a present er that be kind of like yeah that's fine but the the think might have be nice
S0190	but you see well
S0227	there you go
S0190	i think you have you do partly have that to blame because he do ask you what you would like and say well what can we get you and be go don't worry son just don't don't do it like this
S0227	yeah so don't go over yeah
S0190	sort of thing and i suppose he just think oh well you you obviously don't probably see he take it the wrong way
S0227	well no i say i say you know you to money you can't afford it so don't do it you know it wasn't like i'm not interest in it it be like because of your financial situation
S0190	well yeah i know but i'm say perhaps because it's be he's take it literally whereas you know like somebody else i mean i always say to well don't do this and don't do the other i mean the you know the with the boys where i say about i want to erm i ask to get you your satnav you see i say look i don't know what i'm do erm i'm feed up with it cos that wasn't work properly use it a lot can you get me will you get me a satnav for him and that so i don't know how much they be or what i'm pay you know what's the best to do you see so he's he say then and that's then when come back with where he say well we wanna come in with you that sound a good idea this that and the other and that so i say no you don't need to do this mum we're do it you see and i don't they don't they just don't argue they just don't if they decide something i don't get to
S0227	no they write the rule
S0190	yeah so but i mean as i say doesn't have to spend a lot of money he could have just send you an email
S0227	yeah or phone before or a phone call
S0190	and just ring up you see that's why i think you
S0227	well i know he be come but he send me a a a happy birthday text as well you know so he say i haven't get you a card well i say well you send me a text and you're here you know so
S0190	i think that's what men be more like this and then you get older it depend on how well whether you appreciate it or not doesn't it
S0227	's there's a light pull the string weather's suppose to be quite nice i think
S0190	yeah get the hedge cut that's nice well we might as well be out in the garden
S0227	right i hope we've get er that next door they decide to have their er next tonight
S0190	i think i hear i in i be in the garden what be i do oh i be just er go up the path i get as far as the greenhouse i be go and i start to clear up and i hear some it sound like they're go daddy daddy erm so the it be so i guess i should think that might be back cos i haven't see him for a couple of weeks

S0190	well i don't know all he say to me be when he look over the wall one day he say something about erm i'm work away now i have to work so it's easier or something now i have to work away and it's as much as i know

S0190	yeah
S0192	and i sleep with one ear on the pillow and one in i can't put them both in because it's uncomfortable
S0227	yeah
S0192	if you sleep with one ear on the pillow and one ear in it help a lot a lot i would recommend get some because they're my godsend now and there's numerous i use to be a really light sleeper and like i couldn't believe it i mean the amount of time there's somebody just beep or i've have people in india knock on my door it's quite scary like at night people be try to get in to your door like and i be lie in bed like please you know whoever this be please go away people like clearly turn the door handle's turn and stuff and we're like i don't wanna die right now this be please go away so i've i've i've get good with that now i and pretty much it doesn't block all of the sound out but it really distance it it make it sound like it's quite far away
S0190	far away
S0192	erm
S0227	you might need that tonight er it depend on what's go on
S0192	i've get my headphones with me so

S0192	hopefully not paper doesn't work
S0227	no
S0192	that's no good
S0227	no it
S0192	these inner earplugs be good i'd recommend you investigate it
S0227	er that be the girl on the line to me i give you you know i be i i ask two simple things one erm tell me when you're gonna do it
S0192	you weren't say don't do it you be just say be respectful
S0227	yeah and can you erm do it the other way round rather than take cos her answer be oh well we're too old for that now
S0190	yeah
S0192	too old for what
S0227	to to do the erm
S0190	to be out late at night in
S0227	out like do the things
S0192	right so who be do that then be they all just
S0227	i think she's she's definitely party to it yeah
S0192	go for it as well yeah
S0227	so my my my line would be erm i i i ask two simple things from you one let us know if you're do this so we can be aware of it two erm take it er you know inside after midnight not the other way round
S0192	have you not call not the police but there's like noise police there's like
S0227	oh you yeah er no it's not that that bad but erm and then say well you've fail in those in those in those er
S0192	you've be disrespectful
S0227	yeah yeah
S0190	no well when when erm cut the hedge down what the garden the other and he's he just burn it all well a we're in a smokeless zone so you're not really suppose to do that but i wouldn't say anything because we burn coal
S0192	yeah
S0190	and what have you and we burn some wood and it's not always smokeless coal so i wouldn't do that but if you're gonna light a bonfire in a garden he won't come round to see if i've get any wash and peep over the fence and that so i get you're run to get the wash in the other week it the house stink because it be a it's because it be fresh you know like green and it
S0227	he he be he be try to burn fresh wood and like
S0190	the smoke you couldn't see the garden it be that smoky and that so you know if you if you go and knock on the door and say that i've get we've get all this it will take me age to take it to the tip and i want to have a bonfire you know be that alright be you
S0192	yeah if you've ask
S0190	i be gonna say yeah
S0192	i'll bring my wash in and
S0190	well
S0190	well i'm not say he would just do it
S0227	see my tactic
S0227	my my tact will well when that if you can go about this be about of this party be just knock on the door at six o'clock in the morning and say i'm sorry have i wake you up
S0192	yeah definitely do it
S0227	erm yeah erm
S0190	well i'm sorry but i don't think that would work because the other morning when they do the little boy be scream outside and it be about quarter to seven
S0227	yeah they don't seem to sleep that's like they're like robots and they don't have much sleep
S0192	it's not on be it
S0227	no
S0192	don't get me wrong it's not all the time and this be why it be you know he be say this time it's not ever so late it's not ever so loud and i just don't wanna get
S0192	and you don't know how they're gonna react
S0190	and if the worst come to the worst your dad can move bedroom i could get it doesn't bother me if they'd have be as loud as they be last time with the drum at half past three i would have start say something
S0227	cos i i just go round and say i'm sorry erm if you say you be too old erm have you get younger since then cos you be too old
S0192	yeah
S0227	what's happen here i ask you i give you i ask for i ask two simple things i ask one tell me
S0190	yes you're repeat yourself yeah
S0227	two and be this beyond your you know could you not understand that you know
S0192	i've never understand i've get friends it be difficult in korea because and i now we're a little bite older i don't like to stay up i mean it's still quite late but if i i don't like to be up any later than one thirty or two i feel terrible the next day if i stay up any later
S0227	yeah
S0192	i use to i use to stay up until the sun come up you know
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	there be no problem so now and i would like to go out with people we would like to go out and start the even at five or six or something like this but everyone will be like let's meet at ten or eleven
S0227	or eleven yeah
S0192	i'm like i'm already quite tire by that point but like
S0227	yes exactly
S0192	be i go to have a couple of drink that that's it
S0190	they're go out to the pubs here at nine o'clock at night to get their
S0227	they're load up with like a few erm erm well case and stuff like that at home before they've even go out they're quite they're sozzled before they go
S0192	it's some idea that if you're not up until the early hours you're not have a good time
S0227	yeah
S0192	well just move it forward so instead of start at nine start at six and then finish at midnight rather than at three
S0227	yeah they're not go out till about ten or eleven
S0192	no er it make and i feel old because we're different other people don't think like that
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	but we we be totally like just
S0190	no be only say the other week wasn't he he say you know they're quite happy to stay out three five in the morning he say i'd rather be at home by two o'clock he say that's enough for me
S0192	i'm the same and i feel horrible if we stay out later than than because because it's
S0190	well you've get good active live haven't you and other things on and you your body pattern change and you can't get it up so then it muck the next day up and the next day's even worse
S0192	yeah yeah yeah that's exactly it
