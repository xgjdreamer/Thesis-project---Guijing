S0278	and this one's no better so it's for the christmas tree thing i go to that once and i think no never again it be the the light of the christmas tree and it be the biggest flop ever and and i think that and it and people go last year say why do we bother
S0012	yeah
S0278	probably they just wanna switch it on don't they
S0012	yeah
S0278	yeah and have do with it just lower the switch when no one's there and leave it on but to gather people together to throw a switch to see a mediocre size christmas tree with white well okay it's white white light on it

S0012	yeah
S0278	it's to the right there's a yew tree and there's another another tree to the right and that's just i've just put the rope between the two over the years i've learn exactly how to do it you know you go you go if it's a two foot banner you do two foot six between the rope and when you're tighten them up you do them as tight as you can
S0012	yeah
S0278	two foot six apart line up
S0012	yeah
S0278	start the banner at one end which be the most you know where you can see it the best and get rope ready to pull it tight the other end and then when it tighten up you can adjust how it go depend how you pull it between the two
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm and then and the other

S0012	yeah
S0278	but that's still an still open you see
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm

S0012	well say as you've get three thousand people live in
S0278	oh the oh the oh have get another row
S0012	have they
S0278	the what happen in the one at the top behind the pub
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm when that the bite they're use at the minute be full and then the allotments get get have pick you have to give up your allotment and my agreement be that when that graveyard be full the allotments be the next bite they'll use
S0012	be they
S0278	yeah cos that belong to the church
S0012	do it oh
S0278	as well so so then the grave will move up into that bite as well
S0013	oh
S0012	mm
S0278	mm so there's still a lot of room there yeah yeah
S0013	you be talk about our church though weren't you no
S0012	no
S0278	the church the
S0013	oh i think you be talk about
S0278	church say that i think there's one there's one more row up next door
S0013	yeah
S0278	to the erm the hedge i think but it's slowly people be bag slot you see
S0012	yeah
S0278	and they've they've put little post in
S0012	yeah
S0278	for people who've ask for a certain spot
S0013	oh oh dear
S0012	have you get a spot
S0278	no i haven't i i i think if i be gonna be in the grind anywhere it'll be in because that be far more peaceful than
S0012	yeah
S0278	yeah
S0012	don't you want to be burn up
S0278	what i don't understand some somewhere along the line the er you go halfway the new bite in the field the gravestones be face one way and then halfway back they're turn around they're face the other way which mean you can only put people in the grave one way and that's head to the east isn't it
S0012	yes
S0278	erm but why have the stone why be they one way
S0012	yeah
S0278	at the far side of the that big cross which i i don't really like that big cross but
S0013	no
S0278	but and then they're around the other way it's very peculiar i don't know
S0013	no
S0278	or shall we say say they're the other end of the grave
S0012	why do they always have to face east for the head
S0278	well it's just tradition well
S0012	because east be mecca as well
S0278	well i think i think i think i'm right when i say east it be well it's one way or the other but the church that where the altar's always at the east end
S0012	yeah
S0278	cos the church
S0013	mm
S0278	start off erm why the main body of the church be call the nave be because it be naval the ship
S0012	oh right
S0278	it be a ship you see and you you enter the ship from the bow end
S0012	yeah
S0278	bite and so always the door be at the end of the nave and it and it's life go through the church you start off in the fonts the west end
S0013	oh yeah
S0278	don't you
S0012	yeah
S0278	your your church life and you gradually head and then the bite and everybody's all up the east end that that's how it all progress
S0012	oh right
S0278	erm and and the high altar's at the east end and the east be also where the sun rise every morning
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	and come in
S0012	do it
S0278	so it's the bright it's the brightest bite of the church
S0278	you give me a lovely little book you know on church architecture
S0013	oh yeah
S0278	and it's really interest that
S0013	be it
S0278	the erm and if you if you look at all the sit where church be look at look at the whole land they own
S0012	yeah
S0278	this sort of thing it's always on the northern edge of the plot
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0278	and that's also because erm the favourite favourite part for burials be to the south in the warm in the sun you see in the brightest bite north of the church be dark
S0012	yeah
S0278	and that be consider you be very lowly if you get put there you see
S0012	oh i see
S0278	you couldn't go into that other bite and also if you'd and that's why that the church be place there to the north side
S0013	right
S0278	and you have a big long path to get to the church normally it come up from the south
S0012	yeah
S0278	and and that mean that that if you if you're favour and you be along the side of the path everyone get to remember you all the time as you're
S0012	i see well i suppose
S0278	but people at the north no one no one get to see the people bury around the north side
S0012	be north south ain't it
S0278	erm yeah the the the well it's east west the church
S0012	you walk in
S0278	you walk in at the south and you walk up towards the north to go through the door
S0012	yeah yeah it be isn't it
S0278	yeah yeah it be exactly that it's exactly right yeah
S0012	yeah
S0278	slightly strange in that in that i suppose it be i don't know because of the lane that go up past it
S0012	mm
S0278	erm but then the land it own go right the way across that field
S0012	yeah
S0278	you see
S0013	oh
S0278	so it be on the north side of the land it own
S0012	they must have flog that bite of land that lane that go up past it cos there's house up there isn't there as well
S0278	i know but i doubt probably there's a right of way across it or something but
S0012	yeah
S0278	but the field be the church
S0012	yeah
S0278	that's lease to be it i think isn't it yeah
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm and that's why they'll never run out of space for the graveyard there because they can just keep go out
S0012	keep go forever won't they
S0278	yeah yeah but the the you know there's there's and it's funny cos one service when i hadn't be at the church for long there they say and we really want to thank erm and for the work that they're do here cos they they've really that church be beautiful inside now
S0012	yeah
S0278	and they've all do it all properly the way it be do in the first place
S0012	oh right
S0278	all with line mortar and stuff like that
S0012	yeah
S0278	and and er and once that they say that and i say it it's not me i'm sorry i have to say it's not me no i say no it's not me and be sit behind me and i didn't know his name be as well then
S0012	oh right
S0013	really
S0278	we have this funny moment
S0013	oh dear
S0278	where that i think they think i'm do it i'm not do anything
S0013	no
S0012	yeah
S0278	no it be nice well and i can't get to the christmas the christmas fair there because i'm bell ring next week at

S0012	yeah
S0278	erm but i'm play bell at with with the ladies oh my god
S0278	it's really quite it's it's embarrass but it's it's difficult because they be so happy do this they're enjoy it and they don't realise that they're get it all wrong and it's difficult to know what to do well we just keep plod on but sometimes we can get way ahead of them cos they you know then and it's it's difficult do you wait for them to ring their bell you know and then carry on with that or do you do you i don't know i should hate to be conduct it conduct it and erm he get
S0013	well they get better all the time won't they
S0278	well he didn't exactly get cross with them but he that's when he have us all ring in time and they couldn't keep in time
S0278	it be bless her she say but i'm count one two three four and he say yes but you're not count your one two three four at the same speed as everybody else oh
S0013	yeah
S0278	why aren't i count the same and she just keep
S0278	but this it's like somebody be completely tone deaf
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	and sing their heart out and they love it you know
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	and they don't know that they're wrong they can't tell
S0012	no
S0278	erm and i think that it's but i haven't
S0013	in a way that's isn't it
S0278	come across anyone that the time well yes i have because there's some people can't march in time
S0012	no
S0013	mm
S0278	you find the odd soldier who just cannot march in time he might be a brilliant soldier but he's hopeless at march
S0012	we have erm
S0013	mm
S0012	at the school a little girl who be sing so loud and
S0013	sing her heart out
S0012	yeah sing her heart out she be

S0013	mm
S0278	he he he can't sing in tune he go up and down in the right place but they're all the wrong note
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm and it's particularly difficult when there's we're now go to have a reflection song and we're all everyone's sit down quietly just think and reflect on what they've hear and the band's play quietly and like it and he's sing his heart out loud all the wrong note but
S0013	it's funny that they're always louder though aren't they
S0278	yes yeah
S0013	they're always loud
S0278	it may be that he's slightly deaf as well
S0013	yeah
S0012	probably yeah
S0278	he's a lovely fellow and i should think he's struggle all his life hasn't he
S0012	yeah old mrs ain't about anymore have she she's
S0278	oh yeah yeah i saw her this morning she be on her way up to the doctor's yeah and she's on the road

S0278	well no the the she get complications because she's also get i think she's get a growth somewhere down the bottom as well
S0012	oh i see
S0278	and it and i think they decide in the end it wasn't worth the risk risk of straighten up with this growth be there and disturb that you see that they can't do anything with
S0012	no
S0278	but it be tricky isn't it
S0012	it be
S0013	yeah
S0012	that's strange i you know go down to occasionally and see people that we actually they go to that they take their kid to school or we've take ours to school and see the some of them
S0278	they look ever so old yeah
S0012	scary that's so scary all these old people walk about i can't stand it
S0278	but you don't feel old yourself do you
S0012	no no
S0013	no
S0278	i feel a lot younger this last week cos i've
S0013	mm
S0278	i have i've get younger
S0012	yeah
S0278	i suppose it's a shame you didn't see the picture because i don't have red blob my whole face be red now not the red blob for years i've have these and they go purple and black
S0012	purple yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	and now they don't do that
S0013	oh really
S0278	well no
S0012	well that must be them tablets you've take
S0278	it be the tablets
S0013	oh
S0278	i have such a low blood pressure that i wasn't blood wasn't get up here you see
S0013	so you're not you're completely off them now
S0278	yeah yeah i'm not take them at all
S0013	right
S0278	and i feel completely different
S0013	yeah
S0278	and i you know when i decide i'm gonna crack down and get something do it it just it say don't do it and this morning before i come out i think right i erm and erm board so i be out there in in the in the garage pull pull out these eight by four board slice them off slice up the ones ready for the big norfolk and i think right now i'll go and do the banner then i come out and then i find it's it's all too wet no i didn't i go to the church i pick up the church banner i get to change and it's all i've just
S0012	yeah
S0278	get all alert
S0013	yeah and yet they be suppose to be help you all all the time weren't they you know
S0278	well they be but until i be able to tell them that i think something be funny they assume you know so how be you you know i haven't have an annual check and i do say i do get warpy spell just like dizzy ones when i bend down and the nurse would say well because your blood pressure be be on the low side you see but it be on the too low side because but it may not have be last year but it be now cos i that be worse this year when i take well i couldn't even think that morning when i phone the doctor
S0013	yeah
S0278	i didn't know what to do
S0013	but once you stop be your heart
S0278	i think you weren't in and i try i think i try to phone you i think and you weren't in or something
S0012	mm
S0278	like cos i didn't know what to do i phone and i say perhaps no she wasn't in either anyhow in the end i think yeah so so it's good and i have i have my flu jab yesterday
S0012	do you
S0278	it's all do and so i erm earlier on this year i have my
S0012	what flu be it this time then
S0278	the flu whatever they give you
S0012	yeah but they should tell you what it be for
S0013	just flu
S0278	it's just flu it cover it cover all the ones and and anything that might be about erm but they erm and i have before that i cos the previous lass recommend i have a oh what's a chest thing you can get
S0012	oh pneumonia
S0278	pneumonia yeah she recommend it and she say you you haven't have the pneumonia yet and i recommend you have that because there's very very little side effect to the pneumonia and as you get older you could do with that
S0012	you're more prone to it aren't you yeah
S0278	yeah and erm and so but and i want to do it at the same time as my first flu jab and she say no no you can't do that well one at a time so earlier on in the year i have the pneumonia they only do one at a time just in case you have a side effect and they don't know which one it be
S0012	no
S0278	erm so i've have that one as well
S0013	mm
S0012	they ask me if i want them when i go up there and i don't know what do i go up there for
S0278	do you have the flu
S0013	blood test
S0012	i ain't have nothing
S0278	haven't you always have the flu
S0013	yeah
S0278	erm and i haven't have any haven't any bad sort of fluy coldy things in the winter at all
S0012	no
S0278	i know a cold's not the same
S0012	in the year two thousand we both get the bad the flu
S0278	yeah
S0012	we be both very very ill weren't we
S0013	oh yes we be
S0012	at the same time
S0278	oh dear
S0013	mm
S0012	so there be no help one another
S0278	no no that's typical isn't it
S0012	you just have to get out of the way and and die in peace
S0278	mm
S0013	oh dear
S0012	like you do you're i mean when you get that flu you wouldn't
S0278	i know i know
S0012	care if someone come in and poof you've go
S0278	i've have i have i have the either the spanish or the asian flu when i be
S0012	yeah asian flu
S0278	about ten about ten
S0012	yeah
S0278	and i i get send back to westminster with it oh nightmares i be have i be be smother by a white swan all each night or white geese with white feather all all over me and i couldn't breathe and
S0013	yeah
S0278	oh terrible i be i be i remember i be in bed on my tod and everyone else in the same in a dormitory you know stupid isn't it
S0012	crikey
S0013	really
S0278	and erm i have to get sort of
S0013	there be a sick room wasn't there
S0278	no i be still i be still in the dormitory no i don't think there be a sick room
S0013	yeah that's not good be it
S0278	erm no it wasn't good at all but i remember that but actually it's funny it should be bird cos maybe it be a strain of the bird flu
S0012	yeah
S0278	possible cos that be one that kill lot of people didn't it
S0012	that do yeah yeah
S0278	erm
S0013	yeah
S0012	they all seem to start in china don't they
S0278	yeah they do
S0013	yeah
S0012	which be really weird innit
S0278	yeah yeah now they're say that well today it's come out that the aid the aid virus be weaken
S0012	oh yes it's weaken
S0278	well why you don't wanna tell people that you wanna tell them tell them it's get worse
S0012	yeah
S0278	don't you it's wrong to tell people it's weaken erm and i think the ebola
S0012	that's strange
S0278	they're still they're still not on they're still not on top of it be they
S0012	no
S0278	when you hear these program about the attitude of the people live in with it
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0278	but they really haven't haven't get it they don't understand it all you know
S0012	no
S0278	mum be still cuddle and look after all their kid and they they've get it and
S0012	yeah
S0278	and then the kid be gonna get it
S0012	yeah
S0278	they can't help it but get it and so
S0013	that's right you can't can you there's nothing you can do really be there
S0278	no
S0012	but this be the whole point about these diseases
S0013	yeah
S0278	they shouldn't have get them in the first place cos they come from fruit bat and if they hadn't be eat fruit bat
S0012	well yeah but they've get these diseases go through they they come and they go
S0278	mm
S0012	and it's always the strongest that survive
S0278	yeah yeah
S0012	and the weakest
S0013	yeah
S0012	die out and this be what the human race be all about ain't it
S0278	mm it be and actually i hadn't think about that yeah
S0013	basically
S0278	yeah yeah but it's education you see they don't understand it
S0012	no
S0278	and they want to wash they they want to wash the body before they're bury well when they're wash their body they're catch it
S0012	that's even worse ain't it yeah
S0278	yeah and i don't what i don't understand they're bury the ebola disease and apparently a dead body be as contagious as the
S0012	it's very contagious
S0013	mm
S0278	so why don't but they probably wouldn't be allow to burn the body cos no one would accept that the body be well burn
S0013	yeah
S0278	but they probably should be burn
S0012	yeah
S0278	to
S0012	like they do foot and mouth disease a few years ago
S0278	yeah yeah they do yeah yeah yeah
S0012	all them cow and cattle and horse and dog sheep
S0278	because they couldn't it wasn't safe to bury them
S0012	yeah
S0278	but ebola it's the same they're they're they're still contagious under the grind
S0013	but they be burn up healthy animals weren't they
S0012	they be burn healthy animals
S0278	yeah
S0013	just in case
S0278	yeah
S0012	just think you could have go on one of them burn and have a nice bite of beef
S0013	oh god
S0012	well it's true you could have drag a leg over i'm sure you could yeah so
S0013	it's all awful yeah
S0278	yeah it's interest anyway but i mean you it's it's out of the news now because it's it's no longer sort of newsworthy i suppose
S0013	yeah
S0278	but it isn't actually get any better it might not be get as worse as fast as it be
S0012	no it's die off in some part hasn't it but they're still bad in the
S0278	yeah
S0012	i forget where they say it be still bad
S0278	sierra leone isn't it
S0012	that's it yeah a beautiful country
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah lovely people and look what they've get
S0278	mm well aid come from monkey didn't it
S0012	that be through the yank weren't it
S0278	be it
S0012	well that's that's what the rumour be that
S0278	oh that one particular port where there be lot of erm ship use to berth and where there be a railways connection to inland as well
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm and the sex trade
S0012	that's right
S0278	they'd get all go badly
S0012	yeah
S0278	and that's how it be ship out to the rest of the world and the rest of africa
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm but that that that originate in in be it orangutans you say some monkey one of the monkey
S0012	yeah some monkey anyway
S0278	yeah mm and they can even trace this ebola outbreak back to one person
S0012	can they
S0278	yeah one one little girl
S0012	oh
S0278	who probably have be feed erm part of a fruit bat because it's er well they call it bush meat
S0012	yeah
S0278	it's a delicacy a fruit bat and fruit bat carry the ebola disease so if it wasn't cook properly properly or something
S0013	yeah
S0278	then she she she start it off
S0012	i mean there's no end to animals carry diseases ain't there
S0013	mm yeah
S0278	well they reckon they reckon well there's some really high percentage of fresh chicken
S0012	yeah it's get this listeria and stuff ain't it
S0278	yes yeah but if you cook it properly
S0012	that's go
S0278	it's go and that that what a lot of people they wash the chicken and you should never wash it
S0012	it should never be wash yeah because
S0013	it seem like the normal thing to do doesn't it
S0278	yeah because if you wash it then your contamination stay all over your kitchen of where you've wash it
S0013	yeah

S0012	yeah
