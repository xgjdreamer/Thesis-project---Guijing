S0084	it's so upset just leave it to fester love
S0041	fester
S0084	fester uncle fester
S0041	erm fork
S0084	to shovel the food
S0041	to shovel shovel the food
S0084	mm genius be that your dinner oh the fish be in the oven
S0041	no i've get the fish for next for second dinner so i'm go to have a slice of eggy bread for first dinner and then then it'll be time for second dinner which seem fine
S0084	mm mhm mm seem sensible
S0041	at work like to talk to me now
S0084	yeah just tell that you hate her
S0041	mm the thing be i think know that i hate her
S0084	right do you have a pain expression on your face every time she talk to you
S0041	yes erm but i don't think like her either i think it's just cos she's so tedious like it take her so long to talk as well that you're just like oh fuck shut up but 's much more patient with her than i be
S0084	mm
S0041	so when we're both we both have to play the game of just nod and she might stop speak soon and realise that she's the only one that's be talk in this conversation
S0084	yeah those people never get the hint though do they
S0041	no
S0084	be she the older one that's get the kid no
S0041	no kid she's old though well not super old she's fifty this year
S0084	mm
S0041	well no you're think of i like
S0084	mm
S0041	she's on team amy though
S0084	oh
S0041	mm mm oh my god amy let's speak about her
S0084	mm
S0041	have go down to what have she go down to mm oh i don't remember the name of the place but we'll say it's don't know
S0084	somewhere west
S0041	somewhere no it's just somewhere that i don't know of
S0084	oh right
S0041	or like
S0084	but you don't know oh okay
S0041	i don't know somewhere she's go there cos their erm sales manager director of sales have just walk out and they've be one sales manager down for like eight weeks or something so they're really behind on their quotas so basically as a favour have pimp her out to go and help them out for two weeks or something
S0084	right mm
S0041	erm i mean i'm the only person that know that that's the part of her personal development plan to go and work in a cluster cos she just work for she's a sales manager for a hotel
S0084	mm
S0041	usually sales managers manage a couple of hotels so she's have a really easy ride of it
S0084	oh that's interest
S0041	yeah erm and obviously her target be easy to get cos we do all the work and she just take credit for it
S0084	no can't blame the girl for try
S0041	whereas mm really she's be really smart about it because if you work for a cluster as oppose to just one hotel then you don't get to speak to the conference team and find out all the insider gossip and try and work around them you're just leave to your own devices and the conference team won't talk to you because they don't won't you poach their clients
S0084	mm no mm fine
S0041	so that's how she's end up be so good
S0084	mm
S0041	but she's basically pass it off to everyone else as if they've request her to go and sort it out so she's look after a cluster mm what a douche
S0084	she's a nob
S0041	mm
S0084	well at least that get her out your hair for two weeks
S0041	mm it just piss me off hear her say it because she's not particularly good at her job she just be get on the back of everyone else
S0084	mhm
S0041	she's be in sales for a year and a half
S0084	be that it she's already a sales manager
S0041	mhm that's what i mean have she not work at our hotel she wouldn't have a chance
S0084	mm mhm
S0041	her figure aren't high enough her contact aren't high enough
S0084	mm
S0041	she's just be fortunate
S0084	yeah yeah it be it basically be just right place right time and don't rock the boat too much
S0041	mhm which i mean be great for her and if she's a nice person you'd be like fuck hell great
S0084	yeah but it still doesn't seem fair though if you're the in a different department and that option isn't available to you and you're work your arse off for little credit
S0041	mm so she's win she basically get target on bedrooms as well as conference but if she overhear me land a big deal she muscle in
S0084	mm really
S0041	and she's like that oh do you want me to contact them and ask them about business cub and i'm like no cos i know she's only do it to make friends with them and then she'll make them one of her account mhm
S0084	bitch
S0041	i know
S0084	there's no sense of like unity then be there
S0041	no no not at all and i mean i can't get angry because i don't have account that be my own so there's no benefit to me have them but i just resent her reign the credit for just jump on at the last minute
S0084	yeah fair enough well it's it's it you're get on with anyone that's not really pull their weight you know if you're get pay a decent salary or be get credit for something that they isn't justify like isn't through hard work or their hard work somebody else's
S0041	yeah mm no and she hasn't do a she do a train like i do the first week i get there yet have we get have we get room for a conference on this day and i'm think you should know how to check that yourself that's part of your job but she'll and i mid do something and even simon now say if you've get any enquire send it to the in box
S0084	mm
S0041	and we'll get to it when i get to it we're busy now
S0084	mm
S0041	cos she just say it she'll start speak expect you to drop what you're do and check availability for her when actually she should be able to check it for herself
S0084	mm yeah
S0041	and we have to put contact together for her when she should be able to do a contract herself it's a button it's just it's a tedious time consume job
S0084	she doesn't want to do it
S0041	so she doesn't want to do it yeah we can't say no cos then we're cos we're reactive sales so she'll be support the sales team
S0084	mm what a nober
S0041	she's just do it to be it it's just feel like whenever she do something it's to get something she never if we if we need something she'd never help us but she expect our help all the time
S0084	mm yeah
S0041	and that's another thing she drop in it
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos the gm have start this new thing where he's say he start like a secret club i don't really understand what the hell's go on
S0084	what
S0041	yeah and there's a few people in the hotel basically that be work on this on the pe team and i don't know what the hell that be but he's basically drive revenue within the hotel so both cos she's sales manager and because he's a financial controller to see if it's financially viable
S0084	mm
S0041	and for some reason i don't know why 's in on the game maybe because he's they're try to develop him
S0084	mm
S0041	so proof that he can manage and they've be on this stupid team erm to drive revenue in the hotel
S0084	right
S0041	's not on the team but do the usual and basically recruit load of people to do the work for her one of them be stupid enough to say yes i'll help and i do warn her
S0084	she be a douche
S0041	yeah and she say say no now i've just say i'll help with the restaurant lunch because that go on our banquet revenue so win win
S0084	okay
S0041	so there's a big massive there's a big presentation tomorrow that and be suppose to be do to who be the regional sales director that's come in real big cheese as far as we're concern he's the closest to head office that we ever see
S0084	mm mm
S0041	yeah so he's come in 's fuck off and be pimp out and 's say that he's too he's he's too shy to do the presentation so fell on
S0084	no
S0041	's get to do a massive presentation tomorrow something that she's not be involve in doesn't have a clue and have literally get some slide and she be like what and he's prepare him to ask you for question about meet and she's like what the fuck cos 's fuck off and then will come back and say well i don't know if i can help cos i wasn't in the last meet
S0084	oh what a nob
S0041	yeah she's so she's so bad
S0084	mm
S0041	and it work for her career like be that type of person be great for sales
S0084	mhm
S0041	cos you pass the buck you don't have to do anything and you just reap the benefit so really she's do really well
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	but i just can't understand how you could be that awful that that selfish to you people your suppose to work with and so two face
S0084	mm that's the thing it doesn't feel like you're part of a team you know you must think for them erm why do you get job satisfaction from that
S0041	yeah
S0084	you couldn't pay me enough i mean obviously that's why they pay people really well in sales cos i think money do turn you and some people who be only interest or only motivate by money then great then sales be for you but in term of like your own emotional development i think it just stunt you because you've basically just get to be out there for yourself and you know to sell whatever it be that you your commodity or whatever it be against anybody else
S0041	yep yeah i'm er i'm not pro not pro that
S0084	mm mm this be a good idea
S0041	i just think of something
S0084	what do you think of
S0041	i wonder if there's some type of sexy underwear you know like my zip up
S0084	oh where can we get that from
S0041	from triumph to go under the dress like if it be gold
S0084	mm mm

S0084	mm
S0041	it's to go here so this one will go on this finger
S0084	okay
S0041	and it will go next to the gold band when you see it you'll realise it it should go next to the gold band
S0084	mm
S0041	yeah i really want it i really want it on
S0084	lovely precious
S0041	and this one be for eighteenth and this one be for christmas of twenty first and that one's for the twenty fifth
S0084	perfect
S0041	yep
S0084	go dad
S0041	yeah i just really like it cos it's not it's really unique like it's not you can tell somebody have spend a lot of time make it and it's the only one that's be make
S0084	mm mm
S0041	like the clasp be on show and they shouldn't be and it's not finish perfectly
S0084	mm ah
S0041	it's really nice and you'll never get lapis lazuli set on gold ever
S0084	you never get what sorry
S0041	the stone it's lapis lazuli it's like er this colourish maybe a bite darker but you never get it set on gold you're like amber's usually set on silver
S0084	mm
S0041	which be why this be a er sapphire not a not amber cos i couldn't get amber
S0084	not amber mm mm well that's interest isn't it why do they do that then
S0041	they do it with as well my three favourite stone because i think they're semi precious
S0084	okay yeah
S0041	really they're not like diamonds or rubies or this on silver and i have a look the only place in england i've i know where you can get the lapis lazuli set on gold be a place in london but it make custom jewellery so you're talk like two hundred pound a pop minimum
S0084	yeah
S0041	bloody bugger
S0084	but then but then it would be just your own just your own secret ring all secret things have secret time
S0041	of secret wonderfulness
S0084	that everyone would be really jealous by so who have you actually invite for saturday then
S0041	erm ah i i just actually want you emily me and
S0084	yourself
S0041	that's fine by me
S0084	that's more than enough
S0041	that's enough people for me to
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos i i mean i sound like i don't like be around people i do like be around people
S0084	yeah
S0041	it's just that i always hate it when you have to herd people around do you know what i mean and
S0084	yeah
S0041	if someone go to the toilet and then three people go to the toilet and there's four of you stand and whereas if it be a small group then you would be with people the whole time do you know what i mean
S0084	yeah yeah yeah absolutely
S0041	so i think i'll text nick and then i think but then i think if i text them then i've get to invite
S0084	yeah
S0041	and
S0084	yeah cos i think you weren't go to invite any of them cos then at least that's safe
S0041	yeah but then i think well isn't it a bite mean of me not to invite
S0084	well if you're go to invite any of them then yeah
S0041	yeah so
S0084	it's a tough one though because you shouldn't feel dictate to on your birthday you should just invite the people that you want to invite
S0041	yeah i mean if it be just her then fine but she doesn't go anywhere on her own she always invite and i do like
S0084	yeah right and you've meet him
S0041	yeah yeah he's nice but also they're not really although they're not old they behave like they're old like she's only thirty four but she would never go club she would never go into a club never
S0084	really be that because she's never really like it or she's just get old
S0041	just get old i don't think it's her type of thing and i feel like if i invite her she'd probably come for drink first somewhere and then go which be fine
S0084	naff off yeah
S0041	in fact what i might do be maybe tomorrow at work say we're gonna go out on saturday
S0084	yeah
S0041	we're gonna probably have some drink at the hotel first before we decide where we're gonna go so if anybody want to join us
S0084	yeah
S0041	and then at least no one feel like they have to
S0084	yeah well that sound fine cos if we're gonna be in the hotel anyway i guess we have to think about time
S0041	mm
S0084	cos if we be i suppose the good thing be if we do all the shop in the week we don't have to worry about shop on saturday cos shop on saturday be a bitch
S0041	yeah and we can start the
S0084	and we can exactly we can just chill out during the day we don't have to panic
S0041	yes and do the nail
S0084	yeah do the nail you know pamper
S0041	and we can sit and moisturise and
S0084	mm all that stuff all that good stuff and like not have to rush i mean it depend whether you need to pick up or or whatever or pick up or whether they just come straight here or meet us in town or
S0041	yeah i think they can do that on their own
S0084	cos it's your birthday well yeah i mean you're not their mum have you
S0041	i don't think will have a problem at all it's just whereas if be come surely can give a life through
S0084	baby if he's come from yeah where do the love of his life live
S0041	i don't know
S0084	be she go to come
S0041	i don't know to be honest i i don't really mind if she do or not because i don't think i don't think she'll i think she'll be nice if she like him she must be quite a nice person
S0084	yeah absolutely
S0041	oh no i forget about this devil lettuce
S0084	it's risky
S0041	i mean it be die now i must admit it's on it's last legs
S0084	it's a risky business i've get salad in the fridge not the one with the death lettuce not the one that will kill you a new one
S0041	the lettuce of death what time do you think we should go out then
S0084	erm
S0041	what time do you think be appropriate time
S0084	be at the hotel for seven do you think it depend if you want to eat i mean the thing be if we're here during the day
S0041	yea i be go to say you're suppose to fee people
S0084	no
S0041	cos i i'm i'm not really one for like eat and then drink cos then i'll feel full and i'll feel flat
S0084	it depend what time you go out exactly well that's what i be go to say if we're here during the day we can eat you know a meal at lunch time or something sizable at lunchtime and then we can just pick in the afternoon
S0041	yeah we could make a little buffet
S0084	make a little buffet finger buffet
S0041	yeah with the italian ham i love the italian ham
S0084	and prawn with chilli sauce
S0041	and prawn with chilli sauce
S0084	cos i have prawn and we can we can get the chilli sauce cos we have chilli

S0084	cos that's the thing if 's get to get the bus if isn't come here she might to decide to just meet us in town rather than get the bus to town and get another bus from town to here
S0041	yeah yeah and i think i might say to her as well cos obviously we're go to need to get some bubbly in
S0084	yes
S0041	obviously erm
S0084	that will need to happen
S0041	it's that i i want to be able to enjoy have a drink i mean i don't i can't get too drink before i put my face on but if i do my make up earlier on so my make up be kind of do for five then
S0084	mm yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely yeah cos then we'll just be potter around and top up and whatever just make sure we don't look like david dickinson before we go out
S0041	nail paint nail paint i can do that at the last minute i be think take my nail polish off and i quite like it with just the tip do
S0084	ah yeah really nice
S0041	i mean i don't know how you do that because i just be pick my nail polish off and that happen by accident
S0084	right right
S0041	but erm you know
S0084	we could we could we could attempt we could make some little erm er markers
S0041	guide

S0084	yeah
S0041	and then on friday when i get pay go and pick the stuff up in my lunch break and or after work because i finish at five
S0084	mm oh yeah that's true

S0084	yeah
S0041	they're not go to mind be they
S0084	well the shop you'll have to be careful because the shop might close at five if that's when you finish
S0041	on friday
S0084	yeah i don't know what time the shop in town close some close at five some close at six
S0041	could go in my lunch
S0084	you could go in your lunch cos if you're just collect then that's not an issue be it you're not choose
S0041	yeah i'll choose the ones i want and then
S0084	yeah then you'll have to cart them around on wednesday
S0041	yeah
S0084	yes yes
S0041	cos if i choose choose other things underwear and my shoe
S0084	mm yeah
S0041	i do have a little gold handbag but it's fall to piece but it's my favourite which would go with that i might have to replace that
S0084	yeah mine die i have a really nice one
S0041	do you think i can wear the the orange dress for the wed or do you think that's a bite inappropriate for the wed if i get a white blazer with it
S0084	for the wed yeah that would look really nice cos you could oh no you can't wear tights can you you can wear stock though hold up or the ones that stick to your leg
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	i mean the only thing be once they go you look like nora batty
S0041	yes that be an issue because by the time it's reception time
S0084	cos then they can come off
S0041	they can come off
S0084	mm
S0041	if i get a quite like a a white off white blazer
S0084	mm
S0041	and wear i've get some little gold heel that be sandals but they're only this high so they're more acceptable wed wear during the day
S0084	mm yeah yeah that's the thing
S0041	so if i get a gold bag at least that will go with the gold sandals for the wed
S0084	yeah for wed
S0041	and the gold one to your heel
S0084	lovely
S0041	that could be a winner that could be a winner erm i'm afraid i'm go to need to see your pink dress again
S0084	oh my dress
S0041	and the new dress
S0084	and the new dress
S0041	yeah
S0084	okay well that's definitely an option erm i yeah cos i like that pink dress and i have only wear it once
S0041	i love your pink dress
S0084	and it do look nice with the tan
S0041	the tanage
S0084	and obviously that's the thing the that be the last time i go out out out but you know get really dress up and that's what i wear so it feel like that's all i own and it be with the same people it be with you and i suppose it doesn't really matter and it's a nice bright colour you could say it be of a spring colour so
S0041	yeah mm i be say to eve about not be able to find a suitable dress and she say erm well what's liz wear
S0084	mm
S0041	and i say she'll probably wear the pink one but it's it's a spring it's a really nice formal dress that could be either a winter one or a summer one
S0084	yeah
S0041	i mean you could wear that dress in july
S0084	yeah i suppose that's it be quite versatile like because again you could probably wear it with different colour accessories like obviously when i wear it in the winter i wear it with the black
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	but maybe i need to get some silver things or gold things
S0041	some silver or some gold yeah
S0084	erm i think i'm see one of the ' on friday
S0041	right that's excite
S0084	he have three motorbike he work in this be the one who work in the international sale
S0041	right
S0084	the thing be i fear that their personalities might get confuse like i might i'll have to get it really clear in my mind that the artist isn't get confuse with the motorbike guy
S0041	yes
S0084	cos i might say stuff to him that be for the other guy but that's fine
S0041	yep
S0084	but that's just the risk you take you know
S0041	which i can understand seem as and be different name and i i still have the terror that that's go to happen
S0084	yeah yeah yeah yeah well i do put a photo for motorbike guy cos i i haven't erm get photos for the other one yet cos we only just start chat okay so this be
S0041	oh yeah see i think photograph help
S0084	my concern be he be wear his jumper around his shoulder which be a bite of a thing to do
S0041	mm he look nice
S0084	he look quite nice he's six foot two and he he's get three motorbike and this be
S0041	i like six foot two that be like my perfect body
S0084	cos it's not too it's not too like with it's really actually quite intimidate like the relations with him you'd feel a bite your there's your perfect adonis body and here's my wobbly body
S0041	mm i really need to see it again that be a hot bod
S0084	it's nice isn't it
S0041	i want to bite it i want to bite it
S0084	yeah cos he's get like proper proper peck and stuff so
S0041	mm
S0084	it's quite good it look like quite a nice body erm he live with his mum and dad because he work his office be in so he work from home but he he own a house which he rent out cos there's no point because he's away a lot of the time cos he travel a lot which be perfect really he's never gonna be here so that's good
S0084	erm but he doesn't live his parent live in some village near st ives actually it might even be erm
S0041	those place
S0084	those place that be call
S0041	yes
S0084	so i think if he come to on friday i say he can't stay here for obvious reason just mainly because you know i might not like him
S0041	mhm
S0084	erm so he's gonna get a hotel
S0041	fine
S0084	so he should do that he's gonna book it at some point erm and we might go 's because i've never be to 's yet
S0041	mm
S0084	and he say he's be a few time he say it's alright we'll go there and then i don't know we might go out for a couple of drink after maybe it depend what he's like but you can't really tell can you you can never really tell
S0041	no no
S0084	he's he's pretty keen don't know do you
S0041	it's so hard to read somebody isn't it like if you meet them you'll know within ten minutes but you've get that ten minutes
S0084	yeah yeah yeah
S0041	you've get to wait for that's the annoyance
S0084	yeah and it could go either way mm that's some interest hair crazy hair how's the fish wrap
S0041	er awesome
S0084	good nice and salty
S0041	i do like the load of salt yes erm
S0084	mm fish finger
S0041	the thing be i'm a bite dubious about sign up for dinner
S0084	yeah it's a lot of commitment isn't it if you don't like if you don't like each other which be why we'll meet for a drink first because every everyone could then make it an excuse you know my legs just fall off i'm really sorry
S0041	mm there could be an emergency the unions on fire
S0084	the unions on fire erm my housemates leg be fall off so i have to take her to hospital
S0041	mhm
S0084	etcetera etcetera
S0041	i mean i think all first date should have a ten minute cap
S0084	yeah
S0041	like enough for you to finish one drink and then you get to say yes or no and if one say yes and one say no then you call it a day
S0084	no hard feel
S0041	mhm
S0084	but it's always go to be hard feel like there's always go to be a oh that smart
S0041	yeah
S0084	but yeah absolutely i mean and i use to say we'd like to invent something where you could just like if you walk down the street you could have like a clicker or a buzzer and if someone you fancy walk past you would just buzz and then they would get the buzz and then they would look over and if they like you they would buzz back and then then winner
S0041	and then if not no
S0084	yeah if not yeah carry on carry on your merry way no harm do
S0041	mm
S0084	i mean it's all it's all base on appearances obviously but then most of this thing be you know internet date be isn't it you you only message i never message anybody
S0041	mhm mm
S0084	and you probably you would presume that they only message you base on what you look like not really what you say about yourself
S0041	yeah and i notice yesterday on plenty of fish i think something have go wrong so i go on there and load of girls picture come up instead of boys and i be like
S0084	oh hilarious
S0041	erm and all all the girls all that come up have all get like fake hair like really fake big hair their boob out the face really close with big colour lipstick on like
S0084	be that what they all look like
S0041	yeah yeah yeah
S0084	cos i suppose that's the thing cos you don't know what the other girls look like because you wouldn't ever be erm star at them would you
S0041	no they're not normal photograph like ours
S0084	oh
S0041	yeah like you know my witch photograph
S0084	they're just yeah
S0041	worse than that flirtiness and they're all like it

S0084	oh god
S0041	mm
S0084	delete
S0041	yeah delete
S0084	no horrible i think that's it i think because some of the message that i've have from fellas the who they message you and they say oh you you know you seem like a really genuine person and you think well you don't know me but if if just from that a few of those few conversations that you seem quite a genuine person you do wonder what the other girls on there be like
S0041	mm
S0084	or what you know that other fellas do you know most of the fellas be to be honest
S0041	there's lot of filthy girl as well
S0084	well there probably be yeah
S0041	filth pot
S0084	well i think cos a lot of people be use things for cheat don't they
S0041	mm
S0084	so erm yeah
S0041	i never think of that
S0084	i have one guy who be really weird he have a do i tell you he have a fake photo and then he go mental when i when i say it be a bite strange he be he go bananas it like the guy in the photo it wasn't a like anyone famous it be just a and it didn't overly look like a model you wouldn't look at it and go oh well that's a fake he do look like a nice guy and you couldn't really get that much of a look at him because he be behind a camera he be take a photo just look like a nice guy and then we're chat away and he's like oh by the way that's not me in the photo and i think oh oh well okay fine he's just like oh you know i respect i want my privacy to be respect i be like okay well you're on a date site but fine okay just don't put a photo just put erm ask me for a photo message or whatever he be like oh well whatever and then it turn out that that's like a forty five fifty year old guy really unattractive really unattractive and i be and i just think well you've really sort of dupe people here
S0041	what the fuck yeah
S0084	yeah it be really unfair it's really rude for you to do that cos
S0041	waste somebody else's time
S0084	yeah and he be like oh well you know that's all girls say that and you know i'm not just here for sex and i be like well neither be i but it's go to happen your appearance be go to have an impact on my decision whether i would meet you or not
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know i'm here to meet a fella for a good time and maybe more i'm not necessarily here to make friends with people because i've get friends you now i wouldn't come on a date site just to meet meet friends
S0041	yeah
S0084	so he really take he really find it surprise that i be annoy and i be just he be right i'm go to block you now because you're really weird he say that to me and i be just like okay
S0041	fuck weirdos
S0084	so i report him as abuse
S0041	i would totally do that
S0084	mm
S0041	i be talk to a guy once who call me and i be on the phone to him for about an hour or something
S0084	mm
S0041	erm just chat away he seem pretty normal erm
S0084	yeah
S0041	easy enough to get on with bite too flirty like naughty flirty i be a bite like mm this be a bite weird don't really know you at all
S0084	mm mm
S0041	but fine
S0084	yeah
S0041	it wasn't too much and then he be like oh do you want to go for a drink i be erm well you know day off and all that
S0084	mm
S0041	erm but yeah fair enough when you know when be you think
S0084	mm
S0041	anyway he say oh there's something i've get to tell you first i be like what he be like oh that photograph's not me
S0084	erm
S0041	and he'd have me on the phone for an hour i be like what the fuck be you take the piss
S0084	jesus
S0041	and he be like no erm but the job that i work in erm which he couldn't tell me about i'd not ask but until this point come up you know i deal with the public cos i work in like a shop erm
S0084	what
S0041	so i work in like retail and people see me all the time and so i don't want my colleagues know i'm on here or people that come into the store to ask my advice to know that it's me on here and i be like okay fine so do that same thing so ask for a picture
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	don't put a fake one on there and leave me talk to the fake person for an hour and he say yeah but you want to meet me for my personality you know i've not lie anything i've say to you have not be a lie i say no but the whole the whole conversation be build on fake foundation because that's the choice you make when you've decide to talk to someone
S0084	mm mm yeah yeah yeah absolutely
S0041	at least i don't i don't think particularly think i'm superficial i just think because it's because it's internet date you do base your decision on luck because you don't know them
S0084	mm oh yeah cos you haven't get an awful lot to go on else else have you so
S0041	yeah
S0084	yeah i just think it's really mean it's really mean to just use someone else's photo that you've just find on google image or something you know

S0084	mm
S0046	you know out of work but as far as work go he doesn't do a lot as far as i can see

S0041	mm
S0084	erm and you need to be rush to hospital immediately
S0041	i run into yes
S0084	yeah

S0041	mm
S0084	i don't know that one look quite nice who can say

S0041	sixty pound it be
S0084	oh body stock it's really nice though
S0041	it be nice i've get something like this underneath
S0084	mm madam
S0041	except for it's only black
S0084	diamond sensation
S0041	could do that
S0084	i know but that's just bra and vest you need the pant as well
S0041	you need the whole enchilada next
S0084	all of it please
S0041	i wonder if erm do you know where will do this mark and spencers
S0084	yeah that's nice oh they're the hipsters again that's what you need
S0041	yeah
S0084	body stock underwear oh why's the white one a pound cheaper
S0041	fifty quid it's a lot of money isn't it
S0084	that one that one's only fifteen i mean it's not very nice
S0041	well yeah but it's just on the pant as well my bum's cover but look at my bazzomers
S0084	that's nice
S0041	that's pretty if that be in in in skin colour i could rock that
S0084	that's really nice
S0041	mm so really i've get to come to term with the fact that if i want something from here it's go to be sixty pound
S0084	basically yeah or a hundred and eight pound
S0041	wow wowzers forty eight pound
S0084	yeah
S0041	not as sexy though if you someone's go to see your underwear you'd prefer it to be sexiest wouldn't you
S0084	mm mm
S0041	the sexiest version
S0084	oh look that's alright though the erm this one
S0041	yeah that's not bad
S0041	they do this at erm debenhams for fifteen
S0084	mm
S0041	right so let's try er mark and spencers
S0084	yeah
S0041	kinky knickers
S0084	yeah
S0041	they've write that on mark and spencer's website
S0084	on m and s
S0041	yes it say kinky knickers on the side and it's capital k so i think it might be a but still
S0041	go on erm
S0084	bless you
S0041	this isn't it's not as sexy though be it it's just not as sexy
S0084	how much be that one twenty five
S0041	yeah
S0084	half the price
S0041	i mean this be bridal lingerie but
S0084	that will do
S0041	like look at this pretty one it's get a little lace around the bottom i mean what you would actually want to do be whack something like that out so if someone saw your underwear you would look fricking hot
S0084	oh that's nice yeah with silk
S0041	with i want to click on it and see
S0084	do you get all of that everything she's wear
S0041	i don't know i kind of hope so
S0084	that would be worth it really if you get all the stock and suspenders out stuff
S0041	i think it's just the basque which be an issue
S0084	yeah cos you need it all
S0041	yeah you need the whole the whole lot
S0084	the whole shebang
S0041	all of that
S0084	that's just mean advertise it all
S0041	isn't it i suppose i could get an under slip like this to go underneath it
S0084	yeah you have to be careful about the length though because it's quite short at the front
S0041	oh yeah
S0084	and make sure you take the dress with you when you go shop
S0041	oh the suspender belt's only fifteen
S0084	okay
S0041	on it's own but still you're gonna rock up to a hundred quid
S0084	oh
S0041	although i don't own a suspender belt i would like to wear one
S0084	no i don't i really want one what i really want be buy it for me
S0041	yes yes
S0084	in an ideal world
S0041	that would be perfect
S0084	that's what we need where be the men that do all the buy of the lingerie and not the children not the poor ones it's only the rich ones that will the sugar daddy thing never work out do it
S0041	no it didn't i don't think i pursue it enough
S0084	no i get a bite freak out
S0041	yeah see this be this this lace
S0084	mm
S0041	be quite nice but then i think if you wear a body that's full body like this then i i don't know if that would look nice or not
S0084	it's a tough one
S0041	like certainly not that fricking yourself in jesus that's a bite extreme it's the panty line as well isn't it that's the thing
S0084	yeah you're just go to have to be really careful that's why you should just take the dress and try everything on with that
S0041	mm
S0084	oh this fridge door doesn't close
S0084	there you go
S0041	ah
S0084	open
S0041	i think i need to go to mark and spencers tomorrow don't i
S0084	i think you definitely do
S0041	with the dress
S0084	try everything on that blue one teal one be nice
S0041	yeah it be they do it in a different colour as well
S0084	i quite like it in teal it's a bite different
S0041	i i i think you might see teal under my dress i think you might see it
S0084	erm possible yeah but that's yeah that's the idea isn't it
S0041	there be that
S0084	point buy this underwear
S0041	well there be that i suppose as soon as i've put something on i'm gonna know whether it be a good idea to show the underwear or not i think it will either look really good or it will look horrendous like horrendous like it's one thing show your bra underneath a black top but once you get to kind of nice dress it's a i think it's it would either look sexy or you would look like holy crap why can we see your underwear when you're wear a nice dress
S0084	mm yeah tramp
S0041	tramp yeah
S0084	yeah that be a bite of a problem do they let you try on the basques before you buy them
S0041	yeah
S0084	mm that's alright then
S0041	right you have to turn off now cos it's too much it's just too much in the world you definitely need a
S0084	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah all the yummy stuff
