S0230	ah and we be only walk really slowly
S0198	yeah it go well stick a couple of mountains and some step and hill and things in there probably we'll never be that fit again
S0230	and the first day when we go into antwerp we find erm a little supermarket which be where dad find that red label

S0230	yeah
S0198	yeah
S0229	whatever free
S0230	so yeah
S0198	yeah
S0230	but we be miles along from the erm
S0198	the guest house
S0230	yeah
S0229	be a long way
S0230	so we get that we get some milk i buy a bottle of wine and a couple of other nibble course i end up carry all of that
S0198	ah it's alright when you've get a backpack
S0230	yeah
S0198	it's a bite annoy when you've get to carry it round with you
S0230	it be two bag
S0198	yeah
S0229	go out and have a burger the first night didn't we
S0230	yeah
S0198	yeah the food sound like a success everywhere you go
S0229	we be we be the oldest people in the place
S0198	oh be you
S0229	yeah
S0198	how the young
S0229	they be all all all students
S0198	oh be it right
S0230	to begin with they put it by the door
S0229	they move us
S0198	ah
S0230	they move us cos of the door they think we'd be cold
S0198	oh bless them oh that's considerate then isn't it
S0230	oh everybody be really friendly
S0198	yeah i
S0230	everybody
S0198	i think i i don't think you'll find that in france in france the french be a bite more standoffish no you wouldn't find it in france
S0229	not france itself
S0230	oh you wouldn't find it france
S0198	no
S0230	oh
S0198	i don't think it'd be quite because belgium's a much smaller country and i think they be they be
S0229	it be a bloody nice burger and all weren't it
S0198	you know they don't have any issue or anything with anyone that can be quite nice but i think the french can be a little bite more standoffish in touristy place
S0229	oh
S0198	maybe not er to you two cos you're an older couple
S0198	or wherever you would go but i don't think i wouldn't i think belgium's probably in hindsight quite a good place to start i do think their reputation for just be really nice and have a nice standard just a nice country in general
S0230	yeah it be it be so clean wasn't it
S0229	yeah yeah never saw no dog mess nothing no litter
S0230	ever such a lot of cyclists as well
S0198	oh yeah yeah
S0229	oh they go go go
S0198	yeah those europeans fit people as well
S0229	and the
S0198	cycle until their old age
S0230	yeah
S0198	like nothing yeah
S0229	the size of the bike jesus
S0198	yeah
S0229	huge bloody things
S0230	lot of them place where you can hire bike as well
S0198	yeah yeah yeah you that in holland too yeah
S0229	hundreds and hundreds of them
S0198	ah it's a much nicer way to be isn't it i mean we've get a lot field be much more hilly but
S0229	the road be all flat weren't it
S0198	yeah
S0230	just level
S0198	but even so if people do it a bite more than standard here
S0230	boris have try to introduce it in london hasn't he these bike but
S0198	yeah just to get some poll vote probably
S0230	but i don't know how successful it's be up there
S0198	no i mean i've see the hire bike hire bike in london and they're really expensive and if you go over it start charge you a certain amount per twenty minutes
S0229	yeah yeah
S0198	or something you have to put in your bank detail it's something like five pound for a couple of hours and then every hour after that they try to
S0198	yeah yeah if you go over you get a hundred pound fine and all this i wouldn't touch them or something it'd cost you an absolute fortune
S0229	and we have a
S0198	cos i think in europe that's probably to stick a few dollars a few euros in and go
S0229	yeah well i mean we park right in bruges be it bruges we
S0198	yeah
S0229	it never cost a penny do it
S0230	no
