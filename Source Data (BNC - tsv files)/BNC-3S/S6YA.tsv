S0012	if er if you get an appointment for the operation and you have to get cortisone injections and they have to wait five six months that would be that wouldn't be so bad would it
S0152	no
S0012	but er i don't know what the wait list be up up at
S0152	it's it's er it's all this ifs and buts at the moment with me isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0152	you know i dunno what's gonna happen still no news on the house and whatever
S0012	no
S0152	no news on the house
S0012	you'd have think there'd have be more interest wouldn't you at this time of the year
S0152	you know there've be nothing since the two in the first week of the holiday
S0012	yeah
S0152	erm just just nothing
S0012	and they don't they haven't come back at all
S0152	they haven't come back

S0152	or whatever erm you know you the thing be when you look around and you see what you know there's there's lot of house which be not sell
S0012	yeah
S0152	i have no idea why mine be mine be not sell
S0012	no
S0152	and the only thing i can put it down to be things like it's get carpet in the din room

S0152	now it's get a carpet in there not a wooden floor
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	you know erm the kitchen the kitchen isn't isn't the kitchen's not bad

S0152	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0152	and it'll be a lot cheaper
S0012	yeah
S0152	so she go oh okay so she be do that she be do that and i i watch the the villa game and then i go to i think it must have be around eleven o'clock and then i go to bed and well i start just check some things out when i be at the station on er thursday morning the on the notifications it say liverpool lime street and go the train's in and i go be it i say that's not our train i say that's liverpool lime street that's at liverpool
S0152	right that's not liverpool station london that be liverpool lime street station liverpool i say but which make me think if you can get a direct change from to liverpool that would be quite a nice journey
S0012	yeah
S0152	because er and i say and i have the when i go to liverpool i do have a good time no matter what happen i have a good time in liverpool
S0012	yeah
S0152	i enjoy it so maybe we could go on the train to liverpool she go mm i say it's a long journey say how long do you reckon it will take us i say oh i would say probably around about four to five hours
S0012	yeah
S0152	oh really and i go yeah so i i check it out on the thing i think it be forty six pound to go
S0012	yeah
S0152	and eighteen pound return
S0012	oh
S0152	it depend on when you of it depend on
S0012	yeah
S0152	when you go
S0012	yeah
S0152	and when you book but the problem be be you can have a direct only one train
S0012	yeah
S0152	five hours thirty minutes
S0012	oh right
S0152	or you can have a train where you swap twice so you go to peterborough
S0012	yeah
S0152	leeds liverpool still the same price
S0012	wow
S0152	still the same still five and a half hours
S0012	yeah oh and you gotta get off and on another one
S0152	yeah
S0012	in the hope that they're actually
S0152	connect
S0012	on time or
S0152	yeah
S0012	whatever
S0152	yeah
S0012	i can just imagine you get off a train and the other one be pull out
S0152	yeah
S0012	that often happen don't it
S0152	so i suppose if it's a little bite late and whatever
S0012	yeah
S0152	so so it's like oh okay so i like and say well how long do it take in the car five hours
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	but in the car with the way the car be at the moment i can get there and back from here to to liverpool and back
S0012	yeah
S0152	on a tank of petrol easily
S0012	yeah
S0152	and that's like sixty quid
S0152	so forty let's call let's call it forty five fifty sixty pound per person that's a hundred and eighty pound
S0152	you drive don't you
S0012	yeah yeah weird innit cor
S0152	you drive so
S0012	the only problem with drive be be park up you know
S0152	yeah i mean the the hotel that we stay in you get free park with that
S0012	oh do you yeah when we go down to bournemouth you have to pay for their hotel park or that be free just down the road so of course everyone go down the road but you have to pay for the park in the hotel you could have go and unload there
S0152	mm
S0012	and lot of people be pay that be only a that be only a premier inn and it be very nice it be a a nice hotel but pay for your park that's much innit when you're when you're pay for
S0152	when you're sleep there
S0012	yeah
S0152	they might as well put the price on the hotel room that's the way they do it
S0012	well of course it be yeah but they didn't own the car park that be the problem
S0152	yeah well see well this hotel well i a lot of hotels that be in like in the city centre don't like the premier like the premier in
S0012	yeah
S0152	which be next door to
S0012	yeah
S0152	you use
S0012	do you yeah
S0152	and you get a ticket
S0012	oh you get a ticket do you it's like oh that use to no no john lewis now innit you can park in or could park in john lewis car park as long as you shop there you get a ticket
S0152	yeah
S0012	and you get your free
S0152	yeah
S0012	but if you if you park there and then go walk out and
S0152	yeah
S0012	but you gotta shop there and well bite expensive that place and you if you need something that's fine but just to have a walk round that really ain't work four and a half quid be it
S0152	the cheapest the cheapest place really after four o'clock or after be it two o'clock be
S0012	be it yeah
S0152	yeah be relatively cheap
S0012	yeah
S0152	car park be mega expensive
S0012	that be mega expensive yeah
S0152	mega expensive so but
S0012	you'd have think these car park have be run by the council so they could make the money and not these big car park people wouldn't you
S0152	oh it's like all council things isn't it
S0012	it's all
S0152	the reason they don't do
S0012	ship out innit yeah
S0152	the reason they don't cos they've gotta keep upkeep them haven't they
S0012	yeah they have yeah yeah
S0152	you know why aren't there any council house any more as such
S0012	well that's true yeah
S0152	why be it all private
S0012	yeah
S0152	or go in that direction
S0012	well that be innit yeah that's a shame cos you know a council house for for local people should be for for them shouldn't it
S0152	yeah
S0012	but they sell off all the council house didn't they
S0152	well they give you that right see that's where thatcher's government get you didn't they
S0012	that be
S0152	cos they allow you to buy your council house
S0012	yeah
S0152	which be fine
S0012	yeah
S0152	because it mean that people the work class get their foot on the ladder
S0012	yeah that's right
S0152	who be
S0012	yeah
S0152	for for the majority and know they would have to continue work then
S0012	yeah
S0152	cos they they've get a mortgage so
S0012	yeah
S0152	go on strike and stuff like that
S0012	be yeah that's true yeah anyway when i get a change of government how they think or what they do be we even er whoever get in really
S0152	it's gonna be a strange election
S0012	it's gonna be a weird one innit
S0152	it be gonna be a strange election
S0012	i mean they're all worry now it case the ukip get in well apparently be change over to ukip and er lot of them be go this be what they the the poll say you know but that he's he's sick though isn't he he want to be one of the boys don't he a fag a pint of beer ha ha ha oh
S0152	you could see him do it in
S0012	well i think a i think a lot a lot of er but i mean that use to be true blue because the farm and the farmers i think might some of might go i i i can't see go ukip i mean people say i'm gonna vote for him well they don't in the end i mean he's he's alienate people anyway by the way he just
S0152	yeah but he's only but he's a he isn't he's alienate people that be relatively educate
S0012	yeah
S0152	or be not bias
S0012	yeah or aren't racist well cos i mean they reckon he's not they're not racist but
S0152	oh
S0012	oh dear if he ain't racist i dunno what be
S0152	there be some there be something about there be something about i think see i they're they're talk about i think i i catch it this morning they're talk about if the if labour get in it'll be split up the country into all its different part
S0012	oh right yeah
S0152	because you'll have the you'll have plaid cymru and you'll have the snp
S0012	yeah
S0152	back labour et cetera
S0012	yeah
S0152	so therefore you've get labour will owe them something
S0012	yeah
S0152	so they might give them the referendum on
S0012	yeah
S0152	scotland again or referendum on wales wales won't wanna join by themselves
S0012	no
S0152	because they get too much and the and apparently there be some there be something like the pension be gonna if you're if you've get pension in and you're in scotland you're gonna be better off in scotland
S0012	yeah
S0152	because the deal that they do
S0012	yeah that's right and education in scotland
S0152	you know
S0012	you can go to university in scotland for nothing if you live up there
S0152	yeah
S0012	and you have to pay for it here
S0152	yeah
S0012	er who's who's go to get marry someone's come come over er one of 's friends be come over here to have their baby up i edinburgh so they have right to have free education in scotland mind you that's a long while ahead now but that's what they think they're do go to do because really i mean all that money these people have to pay
S0152	yeah
S0012	to be education and they call them you know it's a lot of people be pay nine thousand quid innit now three thousand a year
S0152	no it's nine thousand a year
S0012	nine thousand a year be it that's a lot of money innit who's get that
S0152	no but you just have a student loan
S0012	yeah and then you have to pay it back er talk student loan erm be now get to pay a lot more because she's live abroad and they want to know every ins and out of what what she's earn abroad you know but she be a affiliate to er university so they know anyway
S0152	yeah
S0012	but we now get this application form and she's be pay from china she pay er every month or every six months or whatever she's be keep up with the repayments now they want even more
S0152	tax
S0012	yeah just because she's live in china earn more money i expect than they do over here but you don't have to pay a student loan off if you earn under twenty thousand be it
S0152	i don't know don't know
S0012	under twenty thousand a year something like that you don't have to pay it off soon as they get over that then you have to start pay it off i don't know exactly how much it be but i know you don't have to pay it at all if you be under and then you get thirty years and after thirty years you owe nothing it's a long time innit
S0152	yeah
S0012	but that's a shame cos i mean all these people be in debt after get educate and if they can't get a job well if they get a job they gotta pay all this money back and if they can't
S0152	well
S0152	get a job
S0012	well most
S0152	they're no better off
S0012	a lot of graduate cos there there be an article a lot of graduate now their start salary be over thirty grand
S0012	be it yeah yeah if they can get a job
S0152	if you go and work for the like of lidl and aldi as a graduate you're on forty grand

S0152	the epc

S0152	mine's a d
S0012	i think ours be d too innit we get the same as you we get the same epc as you
S0152	and the reason mine be at that level be because of my boiler even though my boiler be
S0012	yeah
S0152	brand new
S0012	yeah
S0152	it's because calor gas be not
S0012	it's expensive

S0012	oh right
S0152	if it be oil it would be a better
S0012	yeah
S0152	it would have a better read it's that calorific
S0012	yeah well they don't like that they don't like the the coal burner or the wood burner and they put our i mean they say if you have underfloor er insulation that
S0152	yeah
S0012	would be okay we have get underfloor insulation
S0152	yeah
S0012	total idiots and that's there for ten years innit you can't change it

S0012	yeah you can yeah
S0152	half the thickness therefore innit
S0012	yeah
S0152	right
S0012	well i i think i think the bloke be absolutely mental he didn't know what he be talk about he be there for about three minutes and that be it you know then he give you a result like that and we er complain to the to the er what be it abbots we complain to them he say er oh we'll like get him back in then

S0152	you see i i'm when i be walk round london and we go for that meal i want a drink and i think well i'm gonna have a i'm gonna have a beer and i have a bottle beer
S0012	yeah
S0152	and it be nice and i i end up have two but and then friday i go shop and i think i'll get a bottle i'll get a bottle of beer
S0012	yeah
S0152	for the night and then i pick it up
S0012	yeah
S0152	it be only one bottle and then realise that i have to go and get

S0012	and that's really strange you can have if you have beer it's bad for you it's bad for the cholesterol and everything and the sugar content and but you can have wine
S0152	you'd think it would be the opposite wouldn't you
S0012	you'd think that would be totally opposite wouldn't you but you can have wine so there you go i'll have to just make my own wine
S0152	make your own wine
S0012	instead of my beer i've still gotta make beer

S0012	load of
S0152	butter's
S0012	butter on it and marmite
S0152	butter's alright but you have all
