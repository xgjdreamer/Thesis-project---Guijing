S0655	you'd get a whip if you use the language native to that country
S0654	well in
S0653	you should google that one
S0654	well in ta well in a story about the olden days it be whether if you point stuff something out that which have do wrong that you would she'd get a ruler and whack you with it
S0655	you have find that from hetty feather
S0653	i be gonna say that be hetty feather sort of
S0654	i know

S0654	yeah
S0653	but they didn't have school in shakespeare's time really

S0653	can you say it properly
S0654	can you please take these apart mum
S0653	yeah we're do lego things erm
S0654	don't mum
S0653	well it's impossible to take it off otherwise
S0653	erm so how would you treat slave if you have any
S0655	if i have a slave i would treat them very nice
S0653	nicely mm
S0655	i would
S0653	hang on turn around i can't hear you what be you look for
S0653	you're
S0653	mm
S0655	i would treat them very nicely
S0653	right
S0655	i would make sure they would get educate
S0653	okay
S0655	make sure they wouldn't eat all my chocolate
S0653	well i don't think they would darling
S0654	chocolate
S0654	i don't think chocolate be invent in those days
S0653	oh that's a good question
S0654	mm
S0653	i don't know
S0654	i'm gonna ask scientist that know lot and lot and lot and lot and lot and lot about it
S0655	or you could just google
S0655	i'm just say you could it be so it'd be so much more easy oh can we
S0653	i imagine that chocolate be around sort of renaissance time
S0655	it be it be around in the first world in the first world war
S0653	yeah but renaissance shakespeare time be five hundred years ago darling
S0655	mm
S0654	be that before the first world war
S0653	yeah cos that be about a hundred years ago wasn't it
S0655	no the second world war be a hundred years ago
S0653	no the first world war be a hundred years ago
S0655	and how long ago be the second world war
S0653	okay well the second world war be in the nineteen forties
S0654	so not long
S0653	and it's two thousand and sixteen now so when it's two thousand and forty two oh gosh i can't even well thirty nineteen thirty nine be when it start so i can't do maths to work out how you're go to be when it's a hundred years er but yes anyway we're in we're in the time frame so the first world war end nineteen eighteen so we've get two more years of remember the first world war there be still people alive today who fight in the first world war you know
S0654	wow they must be very old
S0653	they be very old but they be some of them be very young when they
S0655	oh
S0653	sign up to fight they lie and say that they be older so some of them be very very young indeed
S0654	so like thirteen
S0653	yeah and then they saw some awful awful things
S0654	so they think it would be a good be they bad people
S0653	no they be brave they want to fight for their country
S0654	but then they be scar
S0655	no they weren't
S0653	but then it be well war be a terrible thing but this particular war be horrific and it really do damage a lot of people
S0654	yeah and do you know what
S0653	mm
S0654	i think that most of them they might be quite young so that if they do it
S0653	mm
S0654	then they'd be terrify they would be so shock they might get a heart they might get erm
S0655	a heart attack
S0654	heart attack
S0653	well do you know what i think it's amaze that so many of them be still alive and i think that it's almost like they live through such a horrible thing that they want to kind of make the best of it and have manage to have a kind of a happy fulfil life afterwards but lot of people who be in the first world war never speak about what the things they terrible things they saw cos they couldn't really deal with it and they people didn't really understand how to help them or work out what be wrong with them and cos they it's something call post traumatic stress when you finish be in a war and then all the awful things you see you kind of your brain need to process them and work them out they didn't really recognise that so lot of them end up in hospitals but they weren't really treat properly it be very sad
S0654	mm
S0655	oi mum i don't really get what's go on in this lego
S0654	mum
S0655	think i might've
S0653	you must have
S0655	place something on incorrectly
S0653	okay well have a look
S0654	mum i'm actually proud of the men who who fight in the war
S0653	me too
S0655	oh look now i'm exactly i know exactly what i'm do there
S0654	because they leave their children they leave their wife
S0655	oh and
S0653	well they be children themselves some of them weren't they
S0654	and they
S0653	really
S0654	and they do it because they know they have to fight against their country
S0655	and because they
S0653	mm fight for their country yes
S0655	and because they want an adventure
S0653	i'm sure some of them do sign up think it would be an adventure and i think that's what they be sort of say in the publicity like join up and be a hero and see the world and all that kind of thing they certainly didn't think they be go to see awful awful things
S0654	yeah i think it's bad for people to like lie and say oh don't buy bad will happen to you
S0655	well if you survive that might actually happen
S0653	yes it might do but there be there be better ways of see the world aren't there
S0653	but they in the war they also have people who be conscientious objectors do you know what that mean
S0654	no idea
S0655	er no
S0653	okay it's where people didn't believe they didn't want to fight they think that fight be not something that they agree with and they object to the war so they refuse to sign up and fight erm people be allow to do that now but at the time people be put in prison for have that opinion and treat very very badly
S0655	why because they be
S0653	they be call cowards
S0655	because they
S0654	just because they didn't want a war to happen that doesn't mean they're cowards do it because
S0655	well to be fair i don't think anybody actually want the war to happen but they know what would happen if they do say that
S0653	it's a difficult argument because actually if we hadn't fight up fight against hitler then things would be bad but it's yes people be really horrible to them in they they be attack in public an d
S0654	attack in public
S0653	mm
S0654	what do that mean
S0653	people use to spit on them and call them nasty name and and actually so my great uncle be a conscientious objector so he didn't fight but he end up be erm he drive an ambulance and do lot of very brave things to help people so in fact he be a brave person but everyone always use to call him a coward
S0654	but you know what the bravest thing in the world
S0653	the bravest thing in the world mm
S0654	be care for somebody
S0653	yeah
S0654	and like look after them when they're hurt because you know what
S0655	i've finish this page in term of find things
S0654	fight and erm war be just one of things in the world but care that be something you have to do
S0653	mm
S0654	some bad people don't understand it
S0653	people just didn't really understand a lot of things at the time
S0654	yeah
S0653	and
S0654	but if you fight and war if if
S0653	i think they be very brave to stand up for how they felt
S0654	and if you like
S0655	mm mm mm
S0654	be really bad and try to and try to put somebody away then you don't then you need to learn
S0653	what do you need to learn
S0654	you need to learn that it's not not all about you it's about everybody
S0653	i think people be just terrify that if everybody stand up and say
S0654	yeah
S0653	i'm not gonna fight then
S0654	everybody
S0653	we would've be in real difficulties wouldn't we
S0654	mm
S0653	cos the when the first when the war first start lot of people all the the kind of upper class sort of rich posh young men who really believe in stand up for their country volunteer but then they be all kill so they run out of volunteer so they force people to to sign up people didn't have a choice and you be put in prison if you if you refuse to fight
S0655	why
S0654	oh it be only men
S0654	be it only men and boys
S0653	well that's interest isn't it well at the
S0654	because i don't think they could they believe that women do it
S0653	they didn't let women fight at the time and people women be still not allow to fight on the front line even today they're allow to be in the army but not on the front line
S0654	but the front line be for really very good people
S0653	no it's no darling it's disposable people it's people who be gonna get kill
S0654	oh
S0655	well that
S0653	that's the first sort of
S0654	that's harsh
S0655	well
S0653	ah it be harsh
S0655	i that might be the reason why they're not let the women on because they're very valuable
S0653	i think it be more that they say that if they have a woman there it would distract the men because they would want to protect this be their still their argument today that they would want to protect the women and so they would get distract and be
S0653	poorer soldier cos they wouldn't be do their job er they also that women don't fight as well as men
S0654	that's that's mean i'm i'm a tough cookie
S0653	erm it's interest though isn't it
S0655	yeah i think it's quite a stupid idea of think that
S0654	mm
S0653	but what happen in the war be that women stand in for the men at home so they do lot and lot of things that the men have always do and at the time women hadn't have a lot of freedom and they have a brilliant time actually and do lot of excite things and work in factories and farm and things like that and then when the men come back after the war and they all want their job back and the women be suppose to go back to just look after children and things they be a bite cross and they oh well actually we'd quite like to have a job still so that be a bite tricky
S0654	yeah
S0655	i can see how you think that
S0654	because go go and look after the children yeah
S0655	well men can look after children just fine then i really do need to get the t shirt
S0654	yeah but the men need their job as well
S0653	well shut shut the window if you're chilly
S0653	and that that sort of start cos it be a real division that men would go out to work and women would stay at home and now it's very different because who do and who look after them
S0654	their dad
S0653	most of the their dad do doesn't he
S0654	yeah
S0653	so he be a stay at home dad when they be little and erm they
S0655	cos i you say you say i would become a great father and husband and i think that's go to be the case
S0653	yeah and you'd be a great stay at home dad as well
S0655	yeah thank you
S0653	if you wish to do that if you choose to do that but all these sort of things be never you couldn't've think of have those ideas before the first war and the second world war so of women have career of go to university women didn't really go to university before then or they won't allow to graduate
S0654	it's quite mean cos if they didn't graduate then they wouldn't know anything
S0653	well people think that women be not as intelligent or even
S0655	that's
S0653	run even run marathons women be not allow to run marathons for a very long time
S0655	that's very
S0654	you've run a marathon
S0653	i haven't yet but when when women do try and run marathons
S0654	a girl call do
S0653	a girl call do
S0654	yeah
S0653	from blue peter
S0654	yes she do
S0655	what about white peter
S0653	what about
S0655	white peter
S0653	it be good we could use your blue peter badge to get into wasn't it

S0653	especially as you be sick cos we be on there for five second we should've say we should've mention it to them and say can we have can we have ticket to go again please
S0655	well i think that should've be the case
S0653	mm
S0655	no i think be it now you think about it be that a good idea
S0653	yeah but
S0655	well
S0653	i i don't know maybe if i write and ask them
S0654	if you say my
S0653	could you speak coherently and say that again
