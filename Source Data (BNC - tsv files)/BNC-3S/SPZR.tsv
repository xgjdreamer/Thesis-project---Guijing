S0390	and there's a a road there and a road there
S0391	yeah one into the house you mean
S0390	that that doesn't go anywhere there isn't you can't i think
S0391	no but you can park in there can't you
S0390	well you could if you want
S0391	do you examine behind the pub or the church

S0391	yes
S0390	what i be go to do be i go back into and i will park at the nearest car park and maybe if 's there at night he will walk me down to the car
S0391	oh that will be fine
S0390	that will be okay
S0391	yeah that will be alright
S0390	that's what i be plan anyway
S0391	right right
S0392	talk about those er initial you know a
S0390	yes
S0392	a minute ago i be say
S0390	yes
S0392	well there's other things sometimes they initialise it and then they change what it stand for so if you think of a dvd
S0390	yes
S0392	originally it be a digital video disk but now
S0390	hang on a
S0392	a digital video disk
S0390	digital video disk yes
S0392	that get shorten to dvd and now people say it be digital versatile disk so
S0390	well there be different now can you explain in word that i can understand
S0392	yes
S0390	about because my new thing you know er recorder
S0392	yes
S0390	now whatever do you call it that thing there
S0392	a dvd player
S0390	a dvd player and recorder
S0392	yes
S0390	it say it be blue ray what do blue ray mean
S0392	be you use it with a high definition television
S0390	well it be just a new television no it be not a new television it be an old television
S0392	be it hd
S0390	no it be not high no it be not hd
S0392	well blue ray well there's no point in buy a blue ray to go with that then because blue ray be a really expensive add ons but it what it mean it be like a dvd that's really high quality it have get high definition
S0390	mm
S0392	so it be like a a modern tv would high definition and this be if you want that bite more
S0390	i've just buy it
S0392	quality
S0390	have i buy the wrong one
S0392	well what you can do be wire up that one with your erm
S0390	with my new one
S0392	with your new television screen
S0390	that's now how i don't think that's high definition either
S0392	it will be if it be new most of them these days be high and erm that would mean but then blue ray the actual disk cost a bite more money as well whereas i think i don't think you can tell the difference really between blue ray and hd
S0390	you can or you can't
S0392	i don't think you can you might be able to if you be really discern
S0390	now i've get dvd ram and they won't play on the blue ray
S0392	no dvd ram be erm they're
S0390	if they put it
S0392	i think they be maybe for store data be it the ones that
S0390	no i can store a program i can and play it on the other dvd recorder but the blue ray won't play it
S0392	no because blue ray be only for blue ray disk which be record in high definition and they sort of come in a smaller packet you can see they've get a bite of blue at the top and it's a bite it be more like a square
S0390	well actually any of the any of the ones i've record won't play on the erm blue ray but all the
S0392	but although the reason for that
S0390	disk i've get
S0392	maybe because there's two type of dvd there's dvd dash rw and dvd plus rw
S0390	right okay
S0392	some dvds the dash rw they be a bite cheaper they be the same quality and they be older but they only play in some machine dvd plus rw
S0390	yes
S0392	they're a little a little more expensive and they only play in certain type of machine some play but i think that one there play both of them but you will get some machine that will only play dash and some that erm play plus as well usually they play dash but some of them can't play plus
S0390	right
S0392	it be very rare you get one that can't play plus i mean sorry that can only play plus that's that's pretty rare
S0390	right okay
S0392	so maybe these dvd disk you have get be plus only
S0390	its its erm its a double recorder i can record onto the hard disk which i be find be very good
S0392	so that's like a build in storage inside it
S0390	yes it be
S0392	that you record into yes
S0390	and you can't record onto a dvd
S0392	no
S0390	any disk but you can play a disk
S0392	yes but you might not be able to play the dvd plus which be this only apply to ones you make yourself on a computer or a recorder the ones you buy in a shop be usually playable on all machine
S0390	that's exactly it
S0392	yeah
S0390	exactly thank you
S0392	that's a pleasure
S0390	now then you know my other question
S0392	which one be this
S0390	when i send an email
S0392	oh yeah yeah
S0390	every time it's er
S0392	i tell you what what we will do i stand above you while you be do it and watch
S0390	you will and do that
S0392	yeah or i can control your computer from here if you want i can set up and do remote access
S0390	no no no
S0392	no
S0390	i don't go for
S0392	i will come and stand over your shoulder
S0390	no that's right i mean i just i just switch it off
S0392	what happen
S0390	no i don't switch it off i go to the little bite and we will sort it
S0392	what exactly happen
S0390	well it's okay
S0392	yes
S0390	but every time it go dark on the screen and then i get a little message in a box that say wait for program to close so i leave
S0392	actually that's because it doesn't like you to shut your computer down if there be something still run and if it terminate
S0390	well how do i know what's run
S0392	well if it terminate a program half way through it run you might lose some save data so it wait for it to close down properly it be do it for your favour really
S0390	i don't mind that that's but then i go back to my you know i will go back tomorrow i will switch on the email
S0392	yes
S0390	and it will say you do not close the the program down
S0392	oh in that case always go to home page never press restore last session because if you press restore last session
S0390	i don't know about restore last session
S0392	you should never press that because that be always a sort of fix
S0390	i don't do that i just go straight onto the email and then little message will come up this program do not close down properly erm so and so do you wish to do do you wish
S0392	yeah the options be do you want to restore your last session in other word go to the place where it be when you switch it off the last time
S0390	no it be ask me will i accept this click here if you will accept this email
S0392	be this email or internet because
S0390	it be email i be talk about the letter i know i be ignorant on these things
S0392	no no it be just that i've i've have people in the past they be they be say email email and what they mean be internet access
