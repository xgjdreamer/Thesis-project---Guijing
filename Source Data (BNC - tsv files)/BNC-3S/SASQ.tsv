S0430	so we do benidorm stuff like that but we do we we have a department that do stuff that's more er like what do but even then the stuff that they produce be slightly more
S0429	a bite more indie like
S0430	it's a little more niche
S0428	but be it like do you do you particularly go into that area of telly or have you kind of end up in those areas
S0430	no
S0429	no no no cos i mean i
S0428	cos i think you want comedy
S0429	yeah no i be i be so comedy so comedy and more comedy than you be when
S0430	mm
S0429	we first meet
S0430	i hadn't really watch any stand up comedy until
S0429	and i use to go every single night
S0430	i meet
S0429	cos do you remember
S0428	yeah well i still know him
S0429	do you still talk to him
S0428	yeah like not like not every day
S0429	no ah but i love him i think he be amaze
S0428	but he in house of fool i don't think he's funny at all
S0429	he's i haven't watch it you know but yeah it's vic and bob
S0430	i don't i've oh i've see him a few time now and i don't particularly find that funny
S0428	i i think it's like in real life he's identical to he be but
S0429	weirdly cos i really like him i've see him a few like but i've never see a full hour of him
S0428	yeah
S0429	i've just see him in stand up slot where he's do like ten minutes and i've quite like him and i think he's get
S0428	but he's like that in real life
S0429	the kind of warmness that i quite like but sort of stiffness and warmness and then
S0428	he's quite awkward
S0430	but we talk
S0429	yeah
S0430	i talk about this before and i be like
S0429	yeah we talk about him cos i quite like him and he's this
S0430	after see him i wonder if you cos a lot of the audience around me be laugh about the way he pronounce stuff or whatever and i be like if you take away his accent if he be an english guy do the same accent
S0429	mm
S0430	would you laugh in a i don't know if he would be popular at all
S0429	no no no but but then like but then my point be like if you if you write down what everyone's say and you just say it say if i i read off like the funniest comedian in the world like if i go
S0430	sure yeah deliver a massive
S0429	no no but
S0428	do you know who he learn his english off
S0430	no
S0429	you
S0428	ali g no not me
S0429	really
S0430	do he
S0428	that's who he like yeah and like half his
S0430	that's funny
S0429	that's funny
S0428	half his family's chilean and half his family's norwegian
S0430	wow
S0429	oh oh that be interest but there be a difference there i think
S0430	yeah i know i know but ah yeah i to be fair i saw him at a when i saw him
S0429	and it's funny as a comedian learn the language
S0430	when i saw him
S0428	he's incredible the to think that you can do that in another language like
S0430	yeah
S0428	and he's so funny like cos
S0430	and like the year he win the award like
S0428	yeah
S0430	do he win newcomer
S0429	he win newcomer yeah he win everything
S0430	he must have do something
S0429	he be nominate be he
S0428	hm
S0429	no he win it he win it
S0430	i think he win best newcomer
S0429	do he win best newcomer
S0428	i think at edinburgh
S0430	yeah
S0429	yeah yeah yeah he do yeah
S0428	mm but honestly like cos there's erm cos like his like i know him through my friend and he's a standup magician comedian which be quite a weird mix
S0430	who be
S0428	my friend but in in norway and then he's like really funny but he's on radio and then try to make it here ha well he have make it here
S0429	mm
S0428	but erm
S0429	oh he's definitely make it here like everyone know his name
S0428	but yeah but in real life he's the funniest
S0429	mm
S0428	like be probably like when you see him act he's like onstage it's really funny whereas be really funny in real life but and i think i dunno cos i don't understand his radio show
S0429	yeah
S0428	but it's really interest because you can be really funny in real life and just that do not translate to
S0430	no
S0428	you know comedy
S0429	but that's not i don't think that do oh like the amount of comedians they're so self centre and so kind of infatuate with themselves
S0428	yeah
S0429	that you they they're not they they become almost caricature of themselves also like anyone that try to practice things in real life
S0428	yeah
S0429	and you can tell it so badly and it's suddenly just like ah this be tragic rather than actually be funny or
S0428	yeah but then also
S0429	but then live your whole life think well be this funny be be what i'm say funny it's like i don't know i cos at at one point i just think that be the best thing
S0428	but do you not also think that like in real life they're so much funnier than on telly cos at christmas mum buy us ticket to see omid djalili
S0429	oh yeah
S0428	and i've never like him i've always just think he be a complete idiot
S0429	mm
S0428	and we go to see him and
S0429	mm
S0428	i've never cry laugh so much
S0429	yeah
S0428	at a comedian so i think as well
S0429	yeah
S0428	like when you're in the presence of some like
S0429	definitely
S0428	make such a massive difference in just
S0430	the live the live experience make a massive difference
S0429	definitely well cos no i think that of russell howard like i i don't i would never really watch russell howard and i probably would laugh at his joke if it be on if i end up watch it and yet when i saw him live i think he be actually really funny and that's how they've get to where they be be cos
S0428	yeah yeah
S0430	do you mean russell kane
S0429	no no rushell russell howard because russell kane i think's amaze
S0428	yeah he's good anyway
S0430	mm
S0429	but terrible on tv but amaze yeah
S0430	mm
S0429	no i think i think it's massively in the room and and also i think there's a lot of people that can't put that warmth across
S0428	yeah
S0429	the tv rather than
S0430	i saw as well the last time to be fair on the last time i saw him erm my friend who's a big reviewer speak to me and say he'd hear that be erm do this experiment at edinburgh where basically half of his show during the month he be do his normal show that he'd prepare and write all year
S0428	yeah and then he wasn't funny at all because my friend go to go and see him and be like totally flop
S0430	yeah so on the other half
S0429	yeah
S0430	of the show he be apparently challenge himself to see if he could do improv
S0429	right
S0430	where basically he be go in with no material
S0429	god
S0430	and see if he could last an hour without any material and i must have see him on one
S0429	see
S0430	of those nights and it be one of the worst show i've ever see
S0429	but weirdly i think you need in order to do it's like you know what they say when you just train so hard for something you know it instinctively so you don't need to have a massive backup of knowledge because you know it you've do it so many time you know what to do
S0430	mm
S0429	and yet i don't like that's what he hasn't get so or you need that like flair where you're just
S0430	also i don't think you also if you're gonna do that
S0428	probably
S0430	i think the audience probably need to know
S0429	yeah yeah they do yeah
S0428	and they
S0430	and i be really annoy because i be like he'd win newcomer the year before and people will be buy ticket spend money on him
S0429	mm
S0430	because of that and think oh i'm gonna see a really polish comedian and instead half of the festival he be technically rip people off cos he be do something for his own indulgence to see whether or not he could last a
S0428	but i think that's him it's kind of like
S0429	yeah
S0430	yeah
S0428	cos he be just a bite like that and he be just
S0429	that's
S0428	i remember when i meet him
S0429	yeah
S0428	we be at the we be at this like house party in norway and i be like
S0428	who's that weirdo
S0428	honestly it be it be he be so funny i don't think for that whole week where me and be in norway we stop laugh
S0429	really
S0428	he be so funny
S0430	mm
S0428	between the three of them
S0429	and also yeah
S0429	there be a certain like but you've gotta have ball to do that you know like the man on the moon he's that i can't andy kaufman
S0430	oh yeah
S0429	do have you see andy kaufman he be this amaze comedian and he use to just come onstage and he'd do like he'd just do chicken noise for like half an hour and walk off or something or he'd say nothing and he be so controversial and yet now he's like revere you know like everyone think's he's amaze
S0430	he's idolise mm
S0429	and yet you can imagine people come away from that go they've just waste my he's waste my time for half an hour in in a way there's some quite ballsy go to edinburgh where it's so tough anyway and then go right i'm not gonna write half my stuff i'm just gonna do it as like there be something amaze about it like this and quite arrogant but there's something amaze
S0428	but but also like cos when the whole point of stand up be that it's suppose to be completely natural so therefore like you're suppose to come across as kind of
S0429	but
S0428	i know it's not
S0429	yeah
S0428	but it's suppose to come across as something that's like completely spontaneous and that's why it's so funny
S0429	yeah
S0428	so i can totally see why someone would want to kind of recreate that
S0429	yeah but weirdly it's that kind of thing isn't it it's that i've be to so many er there's this one night in london call old rope and you sort of think that er it's where people come across and they do new material and if they haven't do any er preparation and they're literally do new material they can't remember that they can't do it and if they're a new comedian it just it always flop it always do unless they've get this kind of amaze there be few people that can have that kind of eloquence and just this speed of mind or whatever that can make it funny hardly anyone can i think unless they've get this amaze like backlog of comedy so they can just they've get stuff to go back to
S0428	yeah
S0429	or they know how to build so and like i've see people just completely flounder and not like just bomb and yet they're funny if you watch they're really funny
S0428	yeah
S0429	they construct their joke well and they can learn to deliver them well but it's two i think that's two completely different type of people
S0428	yeah
S0429	or people that have just do it a long time they know how to do it
S0428	it's really rare
S0429	but you're right it's strip it back to what it should be
S0428	but it's it's really rare it's really rare to like i don't know it's really rare to find someone that probably could be that naturally funny
S0429	there be someone there be someone but then he's do it for years there be like i that this guy daniel kitson who you would love if you're ever in london he's get a gig on
S0428	we should go next time he's on we'll
S0429	no you should go next time he's on basically he's get
S0428	just buy ticket and we'll go
S0429	so you've get this mail list it's thousands of twenty thousand people isn't it
S0430	twenty seven thousand
S0429	twenty seven thousand people he's not be on tv since he be on phoenix nights you would love him he's completely my completely your mindset and he's like he's get this
S0430	he doesn't really do gigs bigger than like eighty people or whatever
S0429	he do tiny gigs he no occasionally
S0428	that's just brilliant though
S0429	he do them at the national theatre
S0430	he do big yeah he do those big
S0429	and he charge twelve quid to go in like you can go to the national theatre
S0428	okay let's let's try and get ticket and just go
S0429	so i'll yeah i'll tell you about cos you would love him
S0428	yeah
S0429	i tell you whenever he's gigging literally you have to get them straight away so i'll just book you a ticket and tell you when it's on
S0428	mm mm
S0429	erm and if you can't come that's fine but like
S0428	that's really
S0429	it's er yeah it his show be phenomenal and he can i've be to see so many er like early on material gigs and they they're always good cos he can just talk and he when he talk it's funny but i don't know hardly anyone that can do that and he's be do it for years
S0430	it's rare to find someone who can do both because you get really good mcs people who can do those nights where they just introduce somebody else and they're on to do filler like jar christmas be really good at mcing and talk to people he's actually a really funny comic like just do the bits in between but if you probably pay to see a full polish hour from him you probably come away think oh
S0429	yeah
S0430	it's it's there's some shortcomings in it
S0429	mm
S0428	but do you so you know you do these comedy program but do you actually meet all the people in them or do never kind of go on set or
S0430	i normally do
S0429	he's on set a lot yeah
S0428	really
S0430	i normally meet them all
S0429	he's just produce this
S0428	yeah in benidorm
S0429	a series call drink history
S0428	i i saw the trailer erm
S0430	which be terrible the advert be terrible we be really annoy about it
S0428	show it to me at new year
S0430	oh yeah
S0429	ah yeah
S0428	yeah it be really good i like it
S0430	we be annoy by the trailers but yeah it have some good people in it i'm quite shy on set i don't really talk to people on set the the drink people be fine i speak to them cos do you know the premise
S0428	be they actually drink
S0430	yeah so they drink
S0429	yeah they're really piss like completely off their head
S0430	and we drink with them to make them feel comfortable and stuff
S0428	that's such a crazy idea isn't it
S0430	yeah and then
S0428	and what channel be they on
S0430	so it's comedy central
S0429	see no one really watch it cos like no one have
S0430	you've get sky have you get sky
S0429	comedy central
S0428	but what a shame
S0430	yeah
S0429	yeah
S0430	it be but they er annoyingly it's not one of those program where it's our idea and comedy central have buy it it's actually the other way round comedy central it be an american show that comedy central acquire the right to
S0429	seth rogen do you know seth rogen he's like er
S0428	i've hear the name
S0429	no it's not seth rogen sorry sorry no
S0428	be he isn't he
S0430	will ferrell
S0429	will ferrell
S0430	you know will ferrell anchorman
S0428	where's seth rogen from
S0429	seth rogen be the
S0430	he be in knock up and
S0429	that's right he's the one with the slightly curly hair
S0430	he be one of the saturday night live
S0429	he's like it's funny i always say seth rogen
S0428	ah yeah that's weird
S0430	he basically his little company make it in america for online for the internet and then
S0428	and then they kind of like
S0430	and then they turn it into a big show in america and then comedy central uk buy the right to it and then ask
S0428	ah
S0430	and then ask various production company who'd like to make it and we bid for it on it so
S0429	hello hello
S0428	be you gonna come here
S0429	come here
S0428	she's quite a rude cat
S0428	she's just she
S0430	the house
S0429	how dare she
S0428	yeah that it thank for interrupt our conversation coco
S0430	mm
S0429	mm
S0428	yeah that's mm
S0430	it's fun
S0428	that
S0430	consume like
S0428	be weird to have a drink at work
S0429	i have a gin and tonic today
S0428	do you
S0429	at four o'clock
S0430	i have a beer at five
S0428	mm
S0429	actually it be five o'clock
S0430	for the last hour
S0429	five o'clock we yeah
S0430	yeah that be particularly cos we be like you have to drink alongside cos the whole thing be that they're mean to be really drink before they tell the story but
S0428	i think they be put it on
S0430	no they're all genuinely
S0429	no
S0430	what all the list you see on screen how much they drink be the genuine amount
S0429	do they do you know that
S0428	how can promote that because surely it's promote a culture that's
S0430	well that's what i don't if american if america hadn't make it already i don't think that it would ever have be make over here i think they because they set a precedent we could say look they do it over there and because
S0428	because i can't imagine it's a good image for like a show or
S0430	but yeah but it's not the the thing it's treat it's handle with care and you know everyone
S0429	yeah
S0430	everyone have a medical beforehand erm we have a medic on site that breathalyse them and if they hit a certain point they have to stop drink and stuff and we also the word our voice over say so and so drink blah blah blah blah blah and you see them nurse a drink it's not really the show where i dunno but then then again we've have people that
S0429	i guess weirdly like
S0430	could finish their story because they be too drink and we show them be sick in a bucket
S0429	but weirdly like i think
S0430	fall down stairs and stuff
S0429	i think geordie shore though where they're like get so drink they don't know what's go on and then they shag someone and then they
S0428	i've never see it
S0429	er no i've never see it
S0428	yeah
S0429	i've never watch a full episode but all that where they're do stuff they're off their face and they've no idea they're quite vulnerable and then it just go out on tv it's much like
S0430	and the key and the key with both show
S0429	it's way worse than
S0430	key with both show be you never see us people behind this camera give them the drink it always seem like it's and it's like we capture them at home have a glass of wine
S0429	yeah
S0430	while they tell this story geordie shore there's booze all in the house and it always appear to be they're just
S0429	but weirdly
S0430	their own it's their prerogative to have a drink
S0429	no but we
S0428	but that's kind of worse be it not
S0429	no it's way worse like legally though because er big brother like i work in you're only allow to give them a certain amount of alcohol you cannot give them much alcohol at all like if they get really drink but they're not actually that drink because you can only give them very kind of and that must be the same for geordie shore but it's not because they can just do whatever they want so you don't ever give them alcohol like i doubt they ever give them alcohol on geordie shore
S0430	well i'm
S0429	cos you're not allow to you're not allow to give them
S0430	yeah but that's not
S0429	that much alcohol legally on big brother that's why you have to
S0428	surely big brother be like the first show where kind of that happen on telly
S0430	probably
S0429	yeah yeah i think you're right yeah
S0428	social experiment and
S0429	yeah yeah it be
S0430	i think we speak to someone we speak to legal about it and it be like if you buy a drink and you put drink somewhere and they then take the drink then
S0429	yeah fair enough
S0430	you would you be then pass your responsibility to them for have the drink
S0429	no well maybe maybe
S0430	and that's why it us
S0429	well maybe the difference be big brother's like a self contain world it they can't get anything in they can't get anything out
S0430	yeah
S0429	and so you're basically
S0428	yeah so it's a bite different
S0430	and even you can say
S0429	yeah it be
S0430	even it be like you can also offer you can say would you like a drink
S0429	mm
S0430	it's when you say have this beer have this shoot
S0429	yeah
S0430	have this whatever it be be when we suddenly step onto slightly grey area
S0429	mm
S0430	which we didn't do here
S0429	you're right though really
S0428	i dunno i just feel it's a bite it's a bite like weird in a way that like a programme they're tell histories and they're really funny cos i kind of feel oh that's a really great idea but i didn't necessarily see the need for the people to be drink it like it could have just be like a
S0429	mm
S0430	sure
S0428	but that be like almost an excuse
S0430	but i guess the funny the funny thing come when you have
S0428	i haven't see it so i really
S0430	yeah
S0428	i've see the advert though
S0430	yeah but i guess you know i know what you mean cos i think that it you could still do a funny you know if you give a comedian a story
S0429	you could definitely do it
S0430	they could make it really funny without need to be drink
S0429	yeah
S0428	yeah
S0430	but what's quite funny be when they make mistake that's quite literally the and because the way it work be they create the dialogue for the people that act in
S0428	yeah
S0430	the erm like like the recreations and people in the recreations have to lip sync to that dialogue so when they make slip up and you see like someone who's quite you know popular in the comedy world like rebecca front or whoever it be someone who's hold in quite high esteem look like queen victoria and it look like a real old period drama but then they're talk this way
S0428	they're make a mistake
S0430	in this slur voice and all that that's what
S0429	mm
S0430	add the extra layer to it that's slightly different i agree i don't think it necessarily
S0429	it's sort of capture those stories when you've have too much to drink and you're tell this story you're tell it in a completely different way cos you're drink
S0428	yeah
S0429	and there be something funny about that
S0430	mm
S0429	and yet and and actually the reality of it be that it start off as this kind of quite small thing where like people get drink tell stories and things
S0430	cult follow
S0429	and it have a cult follow and yet if you come to a channel and say we've get this idea comedians be gonna tell stories from
S0428	mm
S0429	history unless you have a massive comedian that want to that be their project there's no no way it would ever get a cos it's get always get to have like a hook to it
S0428	yeah it's just such a crazy such a crazy world that i've never even really
S0430	mm
S0428	but the whole comedy world and it's crazy that you've end up in that and that's what you want to end up in and it's always really funny where you end up
S0429	yeah but i don't feel like i've end up anywhere
S0428	no
S0429	i feel like i'm in in a place at the moment
S0428	we haven't finish
S0429	i haven't finish no but i wouldn't be surprise in two years if i'm not if i haven't get anything to do with that
S0428	with telly
S0429	with telly or if i have go a completely different way
S0428	what do you reckon you're gonna
S0429	it's no but it's always change it's always change i don't think i've find my thing yet
S0428	yeah
S0429	you know like you don't you don't know exactly where your life's go in two years
S0428	no who well who do
S0429	no no one do yeah
S0428	yeah
S0429	but i think some people i think probably if you ask her she might know more where she might be in two years
S0428	she's happy in her job now than she be at easter or
S0429	i don't know she's stress by it a lot i think she feel happier with it cos she feel like you know whenever you feel like you're kind of into something
S0428	yeah
S0429	erm you kind of enjoy it a bite more
S0428	yeah and also not have the travel and
S0429	yeah
S0428	it must make it easier work
S0429	yeah yeah i think that make a massive difference
S0430	that make a big difference
S0429	and like yeah
S0430	no she just want a while she use to be able to work at home at actually but if she have be work at home like she wouldn't just wouldn't have be able to get on that train with us busy isn't it
S0429	yeah

S0429	although she do use to work from home
S0430	but friday be different yeah
S0429	she didn't even like work from home though she'd rather be in an office with people
S0428	well obviously
S0429	yeah
S0428	you know fine maybe one day a week once a month or something
S0429	yeah yeah yeah she's just i think it's her engagement that just make feel so happy
S0430	mm
