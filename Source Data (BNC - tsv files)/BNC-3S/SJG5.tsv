S0041	anyway the last time i saw him i be in a a hurry but i just look up and i just saw his face and he'd get his hood up
S0084	mm

S0084	tut huh
S0041	it seem to be that you get one or the other

S0084	yeah
S0041	pretty plausible
S0084	yeah

S0041	it's so hard to make that much of an allowance with someone isn't it like
S0084	well it's i know it cos it's the it's the second time in a week where he's be like yeah i'll come over on his instigation
S0041	now i've fuck it up
S0084	well i but the thing be yeah basically it's rude
S0041	yeah
S0084	like even if no matter how
S0084	you class it it's rude cos even if you're just like yeah er if you know we're just friends you don't you're not rude
S0041	and can you can you class it as rude if it's because he's ill
S0084	huh
S0041	that's what i'm think
S0084	that's the problem that's why you
S0041	i would just smash his face against a wall but
S0084	yeah yeah that's why you can't get annoy that but that's his get out of jail free card and the thing be i've say that to him before like i er oh i'd like to be annoy with you about this you know like when he say things in a flippant way and i think er you know part of the adhd i say er you know like i i wanna get annoy with you and i do and then i think oh you know it's not really your fault and he's like yeah but i don't want you to fuck pity me which be fine but then it's sort of like acknowledge why you do something like
S0041	yeah
S0084	you you know why you're do it
S0041	write it down write it down you know you're go write it on a piece of paper all over the flat
S0084	i don't know if it's just he's sit down and have a beer or what's or if he's go to the pub with him or he's have to go somewhere to get money or
S0041	but you can still tell someone
S0084	that's the thing it's the not tell me what's go on and i think that's really rude
S0041	yeah
S0084	and he's like oh i just didn't think well that's rude it's like
S0041	yeah
S0084	a lack of consideration
S0041	yeah it be er by the way
S0084	yeah
S0041	at the risk of sound perverse with my penis um look hot in the leggings you definitely need the leggings and the blazer combo i think
S0084	oh thank love
S0041	have you try them on
S0084	i haven't try it on yet um cos i'm not gonna wear these leggings i'm gonna wear the small leggings
S0041	small ones yep
S0084	yeah
S0041	that be wise cos the cos you can see your whole figure then apart you know i think if you wear or something
S0084	mm
S0041	it wouldn't be as feminine
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos the boy blazer make it i be think about it today at work i don't know why
S0084	good yeah
S0041	it come into my head um but the i think the hair will make it the hair will make the outfit
S0084	oh god really okay
S0041	yeah
S0084	so i need to make an effort
S0041	yeah i think that the effort in the hair will show the look will make it the look as oppose to
S0084	okay so i need to get that on the go i be think about actually go to
S0084	um to have my nail do
S0041	oo
S0084	tomorrow just just for shit and giggle and just because it might be quite nice for a for a good reason
S0041	yeah why not this penis be definitely bigger it's bigger than my hand now
S0084	oh man
S0041	yeah
S0084	that's just not fun time
S0041	no see i like this like a bite raw
S0041	i don't like the bread really crispy
S0084	oh okay
S0041	it's just get to be cook enough for the butter to melt
S0084	so it's yeah so it be warm and you're not eat it when it's still freeze be you
S0041	no
S0084	cos that would be that would be wrong
S0041	i think that should be about it i'm just gonna take it out anyway come on
S0041	oh
S0084	when you say you be gonna eat the whole garlic bread i think you mean like you're gonna eat both loaves
S0084	and in my head i be like that's quite a lot of garlic bread
S0041	that's a lot of bread
S0084	but then i be think actually i probably could eat a whole thing pretty moreish the old garlic bread right how much of this do i need
S0041	you see the thing this be i use to get annoy with my mum about this
S0084	mm
S0041	like she know she be forgetful if you know you're forgetful there be measure you can take to prevent yourself from forget things
S0084	mm i know i think er for me it's just a really personal bugbear as well you know there be just some things about people that really wind you up and it be always the same with nicky nicky be always always late for things always forgetful and just that sort of lack of consideration i think because i'm the complete opposite so i don't have any patience with people who be you know i
S0041	yeah
S0084	people who be late or er people who just don't think mm you know we're all guilty of that to
S0041	yeah
S0084	some extent
S0041	i don't have any patience with it at all
S0084	um yeah i don't i can't really bear it well i've send him a message say i'm eat dot dot dot be you where the frig be you
S0041	i think it's because i cannot believe truly believe that somebody could not think that
S0084	yeah
S0041	do you know what i mean
S0084	yeah how can't why can't you see that that's a problem
S0041	er there's no way on this planet that that didn't enter into your head to do and you choose not to do it as oppose to just didn't think
S0084	yeah
S0041	it come in your head you think it wasn't important enough so therefore didn't do it
S0084	yeah
S0041	not that i didn't think
S0084	yeah absolutely that's that's why cos you just take it really personally right beer beer be what i need
S0041	beer yep i put the budweiser in the fridge

S0041	sorry i forget
S0084	what the fuck be the matter with this kid look i'm not kid i just get money and saw neighbour he invite me in and i think what the hell five minutes we sit down and he offer me a smoke on some herbal weed legal high well i have a bad one and have a bad trip for age and couldn't talk or stand up four people watch me by the way as i end up look like i need section so when so so when i get home i be go to text you and throw up a lot i've be back and tell him that that shit be dangerous i'm so sorry for this i'm so piss off for try it i think it would do nothing at all yes i would like to as soon as i sort myself out a bite if that's okay all of the above be the truth this kid be fuck in the head genuinely genuinely fuck in the head so he's go next door have a bite of pot it's affect him really badly so he's go home be sick hasn't think to text me during any of this it fuck me off cos i'm not his girlfriend i'm not his wife i'm not gonna sit around make him dinner
S0041	yeah
S0084	oh fuck off anyway
S0041	so but i mean that that be a very very far fetch story like if you be gonna make up a lie you'd go with something more plausible than that
S0084	no no i think that's the truth
S0041	mm
S0084	that's er that's that's clearly what's happen he doesn't lie he doesn't understand the purpose of lie that's why i think he's autistic he doesn't understand lie fine if you be go out why would you go next door to your neighbour's house to go round for a smoke
S0041	yeah
S0084	know that i be ready
S0041	why would you do that
S0084	to eat dinner
S0041	yeah and if you do and then react badly the first thing you could do once you move
S0084	mm
S0041	be send the message
S0084	he can fuck off
S0041	he's on his own planet he's on his own planet like even if you're be sick you can't constantly be sick for the for an hour without stop for breath
S0084	it's be age absolutely age be like an hour and a half why i just don't understand why you would go round i'd already texted him say i'll get the food in he say yeah yeah you choose um just see this guy and then i'm on my way why would you then go next door and sit down and have a smoke know that i'm
S0041	be the guy from next door
S0084	no the guy be just the guy he work for
S0041	oh
S0084	like a contractor
S0041	oh
S0084	the guy that he be wait home so that the guy who he's be do a job for this week can come round and pay him fine
S0041	right
S0084	okay so guy's due at six thirty obviously turn up at like seven dan say he be just like speak to him at twenty past seven i'm just finish up here and then i'm on my way
S0041	right
S0084	and i be clearly say right well you come round and then we'll get some food so probably on his way out the door his neighbour have be like cos he's quite close to his neighbour like they socialize a lot and obviously say oh we're just have a smoke he's obviously think
S0041	sorry i'm on the way out
S0084	right okay let's just sit down for five minutes and now it's be an hour and a half what you would what you would say be someone's expect me
S0041	mm yeah that's that's madness i mean it's not the point of the mad the point of the anger here
S0084	frustration
S0041	be not that he say all this crap happen to him it's that in the initial invite it wasn't decline
S0084	yeah i'm just gonna say i'm sorry you're feel so sick but i don't understand why you go in when you be due here
S0041	in the first place yeah like i think you mean the guy that have come to give him money have offer him a smoke in which case
S0084	no
S0041	sometimes you feel a bite oblige to kind of go okay then
S0084	yeah unless the man know his neighbour but i don't think so but i don't understand why you go next door when you be due here question mark
S0041	mm and actually that's really pretty rude
S0041	even once to accept it to know then then you're gonna turn up to see your mat stone when you're not stone when
S0084	yeah
S0041	she isn't
S0084	yeah absolutely
S0041	so the best will in the world if he didn't think it be gonna touch him there be no point in do it
S0084	yeah
S0041	and if it do he know that at least for an hour no matter how little he smoke he's stone
S0084	yeah he's out of it thing be if er if i send this message he's not gonna come round which i kind of don't want him to now because i'm really fuck off there's no point come now if it's all gonna be really weird like it's not gonna be a fun time
S0041	mm have you send it
S0084	no
S0041	but if he come round now be you only gonna say it to his face anyway
