S0417	oh right okay which be the best descriptions but then you don't get a level
S0415	well a level as in how stress be you one to a hundred kind of thing be it
S0417	yeah well as in that won't
S0415	well no yeah but see the people like even if you do have a scale of one to a hundred or whatever like you're still people be still go to be bend into i'll show it to you when
S0417	okay
S0415	because it'll be it'll be really take the temperature if you know what i mean
S0417	yeah
S0415	be everything be everything hunky dory be it very nice
S0417	yeah

S0417	okay
S0415	what what be you point at
S0417	nothing
S0415	ah no that's what she tell me like
S0415	no
S0417	but you okay yeah but you be you be you ask people which things most suit you then that that's hard to get a kind of level i don't know i've never understand
S0415	yeah that's the thing as well be that they're they give the survey to a hundred people to design with a hundred different survey you know there's no right or wrong there can be better practise ones but do you get a knife and fork
S0416	no i'll go thank you
S0417	well that's why i try give you the survey erm the ones that i find because they're the ones that few people have try to set up on their own give it to quite a few organisation one of them be the eesb
S0415	esb
S0417	be it esb in
S0415	well it be it would be yeah the electricity supply board
S0417	yeah so they do one but something
S0415	they're they're call a different name now
S0417	mm
S0417	so if you can say look these be erm these question have be try and test
S0415	the presidential age vote defeat by a margin of three to one i'm disappoint with that
S0417	defeat
S0415	the presidential age do you know what that there's two referendums
S0417	yeah it's from thirty five to twenty one
S0415	yeah i'm disappoint in that because people just refuse to see the fundamental point it's not about make someone who's twenty one the president it's about an equality thing make make their eligible to run like even though they can't run anyway cos it's all control politically it's kind of like say well actually you know cos if a twenty year old twenty one year old for some reason do manage to get on the ballot paper if the country then decide that he's too young to be president that's fine but you can't it's kind of like
S0417	yeah
S0415	oh no you don't get the opportunity cos might be some very inspirational twenty five year old who'd do great work all over the world charities or
S0417	mm
S0415	you know i mean if mark zuckerberg decide he want to run for president
S0417	yeah
S0415	but anyway
S0416	he create facebook didn't he
S0415	aha
S0416	mm
S0415	but yeah that's a small thing it's not like one of the biggest problems in the country
S0417	mad to think that ten years ago facebook didn't exist
S0415	mm hm
S0416	so we're do this yeah so a topic
S0415	that thing be on
S0417	we just talk
S0416	a topic i'd like to talk about maybe entertain be what be this new thing and
S0417	no no no you're go back you're not go to take it alright so just
S0415	it's just a natural conversation
S0416	watch that
S0415	oh my god awkward silence they're go to be listen to people eat
S0417	i mightn't be able to send it in if people be talk about it i think the one rule be that we just don't talk about it
S0415	be that a rule on the thing it's just the natural conversation
S0417	well they want a natural conversation natural conversation talk about be record be not natural
S0415	still a natural conversation
S0416	yeah
S0415	we're not artificially we're not artificially like make up what we say or
S0415	put on
S0416	this would be a very interest topic and i'd love to listen to it
S0415	this be our normal way of talk so we should all relax it'll be fine
S0416	if people be new to this then they might want to be inform
S0417	we just ignore it it would be fine
S0416	okay
S0417	thank you very much for the dinner
S0416	yeah thank
S0415	yeah but you say that to me every time like
S0417	who know when you go and go out and earn the money and you go and get it
S0416	mm hm
S0417	i think you have give me this meal
S0415	yeah but this be what okay this be it's practise in the sense that if you're at home mind the child who we would otherwise have to pay then you're no but wait wait wait
S0417	yeah but you don't
S0415	but then you're what's what i don't like about it be it ignore your contribution to the whole setup and that's just wrong you shouldn't be thank me cos it be a collaborative effort across the whole thing like it's not just me who's facilitate it put this meal on the table
S0417	yeah
S0416	how about this
S0415	i couldn't earn the money if you weren't there look after
S0417	well it's very kind of you to say
S0416	how about this
S0415	but i don't think it's it's not a kind thing for me it's it's more like that's actually a truer sense of what even though i know you're just be like you're just wonderful nice and courteous which be fine too but
S0417	what do you want to say
S0416	hm oh i be say which would make these discussions valid if we all say erm i i can say thank you mum and thank you

S0416	and then mum you can say thank you me then thank you and then can say thank you thank you mum or
S0415	hm

S0417	so after thank you
S0415	the sauce or the chicken
S0417	for the meal
S0415	so thank for that meal but it be a bite shit like
S0415	basically
S0417	i'll just pick it apart yeah it's just it be water the chicken
S0415	the sauce or the chicken
S0417	the actual chicken don't you think
S0415	funny cos the one they have in be far better than the other chinese the one that's in the chicken curry
S0417	then the no this be the
S0415	then the
S0415	erm like
S0417	so the be next to
S0415	yeah
S0416	have you ever be mum
S0415	hm
S0416	have you ever be
S0417	yeah i've be in it
S0416	so you know
S0415	you say that like listen have you ever be
S0415	it's like
S0417	to the
S0416	no but you ask but you ask be it near and if she's already be
S0415	no no i mean she's just she's confuse about the name of the chin cos there's more than one
S0416	oh
S0415	so yeah she know there be a chinese next to but she just wasn't sure which one that be
S0416	oh okay
S0415	or at least that's i presume what she mean
S0417	mm yeah that's what i mean
S0416	do any of you guy want me to put your drink in the freezer so it'll be cold
S0415	eh no
S0417	no
S0416	i do that with my
S0415	okay erm see this my chicken even look different to yours like you have to ask for breast of chicken curry
S0417	do you
S0415	yeah so i don't know that's
S0417	it's just end of the dregs chicken think they just buy it like this
S0415	but they have two type of chicken curry they've get normal chicken curry and breast chicken curry
S0417	oh
S0415	so like there must be some difference that it doesn't taste like like
S0417	just to try it you could do you want a bite of my chicken
S0415	no i'm just try to find you a bite that doesn't maybe it's the exact same as yours
S0417	mm texture wise it feel a bite different
S0416	oh god
S0417	it be different alright it's not like
S0415	i'm not say it's awesome but
S0417	it's not the best chicken breast but it's different from mine
S0415	so maybe then ask for chicken breast in
S0417	yeah which be it do they add on like a quid
S0415	i don't know
S0416	you mean euro
S0417	yeah i can't be bother to say euro i think i'm just go to keep say pound
S0415	well we use to have pound in ireland
S0417	yeah they'll just think i'm quaint and weird english anyway so it doesn't really matter euros it take too long to say
S0416	i've come i've come i've come across
S0415	take too long to say
S0415	we're just go to tear your whole argument apart
S0416	euro pound
S0415	i'm sure both have two syllables two of them
S0417	quid quid
S0416	pound
S0417	quid
S0415	be there two syllables quid
S0416	that be not one
S0417	no no it's one syllable quid
S0415	it's not one syllable quid well maybe
S0416	quid not id it's quid euro ro
S0417	you can stop you can stop clap
S0415	okay i can see
S0416	sorry see the clap work
S0417	yeah that's how
S0415	but we use to i'm still not sure it take a lot more to say
S0415	a very specious argument be that the right word specious that's how we talk all the time
S0417	speeches
S0415	specious do my usual to find
S0416	that's
S0415	actually now in my head i think there's a strange sense that specious have something to do with money which would be alright
S0416	so what have you be up to mum
S0415	see as we're argue about euros and pound
S0417	specious
S0416	what have you be up to mum
S0417	i've read two more two thousand more page of my book
S0415	this be exactly what i mean plausible but actually wrong
S0417	count as a good word specious superficially
S0415	yeah think it's like more like it have like an edge to it for oxymoron or for oxymoron
S0415	it's kind of the same thing or sophistry maybe
S0415	mm this be ridiculous this be what i normally talk like if i wasn't look up word
S0416	mm what do you think
S0415	have you hear of sophistry sophism
S0416	hm
S0417	yeah
S0415	sorry what be you say
S0416	i'm say do you want to know what it would be like if our language be always the longest you might not get it at first but do our language be always the longest way of say something like
S0415	mm you mean if our language be the most bravo be it
S0416	you wouldn't say bravo you'd say what bravo mean you'd say the most something that's like if i'd be this the most
S0415	but then what what word would you use to describe the word you're describe
S0416	the most
S0415	if you always have to describe the word that you're use
S0416	the most basic word that you can use possible and that everything would just be so long
S0415	so then like in mathematics it would be like resolve something to its kind of simplest form
S0416	no no
S0415	that's exactly what it would be like
S0416	resolve it to its simplest form be use word that like so let's like say x plus x plus x plus x or you can just say x to the power of four x to the power of four be a long word that mean x plus x plus x x x
S0415	but it would depend what you mean by simplest form
S0416	hm
S0415	okay be like fraction and there'd be like put things to its lowest common denominators
S0416	yeah but yeah what
S0415	so instead of a hundred it would be
S0416	yeah but the other way round so like make up
S0415	ah no because instead of use a you would use you would say two by whatever by whatever by whatever
S0416	why no but what i'm say yeah like that
S0415	yeah so it that's reduce something to its lowest common denominators instead of just say it
S0417	do you do you want some tissue
S0416	no thank you why be you pull that face
S0417	nothing i always pull a face i wish i didn't pull face
S0415	you do actually it drive me i i don't want to be but it confuse the fecking cos you do kind of sometimes you put on face that be completely contradict your emotions
S0415	which mean that like you know people think you're just in a foul mood and you're not or you're not even try to
S0417	i can't help it i don't know what i do with my face it just do it
S0416	i think you start off because you think it might be humorous or
S0417	i don't know
S0416	and then it just kind of become a habit over twenty eight days or more
S0417	twenty eight days
S0415	mm
S0416	yeah that's how you develop a a a habit sorry
S0415	a that's what i think you be go to say
S0415	that's how you develop a halabot
S0416	i don't know what a halabot be
S0417	tablet
S0415	and then earlier when you say humorous i be go to mean which kind do you mean
S0416	a part on your arm a part in your arm here
S0416	or be it your leg
S0417	i don't know what you're talk about
S0416	your humerus be your humerus be a bone arm
S0415	bone humerus humerus
S0417	i know i'm sorry about my face to be honest i can't do anything about it it's just
S0416	but it's not your face mum it's what you do with your face
S0415	no but one thing about your face be your facial expressions we be comment on
S0416	yeah
S0415	we weren't like that's a shit face
S0417	not very good i know they're not very good
S0416	condition
S0417	i know i i know you hate that
S0416	i don't hate it
S0417	you say i look terrible
S0415	hate what
S0416	i didn't say they look terrible
S0417	when i go like that
S0415	like what
S0416	i don't think i don't think you look
S0415	you just look silly when you do it
S0417	i look stupid
S0416	it kind of look like a person in a cartoon that be on simpsons
S0416	cos cos they they
S0415	like i be say silly
S0416	the the the teeth be show but it kind of you can see their like bone in their neck like this mum
S0417	yeah
S0416	and then they they just all tense up like of cartoon
S0415	do you know what i mean
S0417	no i don't want to
S0415	i don't believe the bone in the neck thing be it
S0417	no i don't want to look at my neck
S0415	bone
S0415	but it's but it's not bone
S0416	it be though
S0417	it's not
S0416	fine tissue or whatever
S0415	it's my bloody trachea and whatever else
S0416	fine trachea your trachea show sorry
S0417	windpipe be what you're try to say
S0416	oh windpipe sorry so your
S0415	or your or your throat
S0416	so your windpipe be a square
S0415	square i never say it be square
S0416	cos look cos look this be like a square there's four bone like that and that look do you look
S0417	suppose to be
S0415	i'm not say there's no bone in your windpipe there could be cartilage and things i'm just say the bite you see
S0417	anyway i apologise about my face i you just have to ask me how i'm feel anyway so
S0416	what be you feel now
S0415	cos when you think someone's feel cross you don't go and ask them how they feel that's the whole point it's a warn sign to back the fuck off whoop sorry
S0417	no but i never do cross things to people
S0415	but it's contrary what's that word it's a word that's no it's not contradictive
S0417	i don't make people put i mean i don't like ignore people or do things that be kind of not
S0415	no we're not say this be a monstrously huge problem or anything
S0417	so it's kind of weird that people pick up things would pick up something like that if i've not ignore them if i'm perfectly nice and have no weird tone in my voice or anything and then just because my face look kind of weird just seem a little bite unfair

S0415	but but i can i can never understand those things i don't know how the flip be it be upside down es and all kinds of craic i mean
S0417	no i don't know but i think i think if it be it would be something between the m and the e or something
S0415	an tyn oh me antonym
S0417	so i think it must be antinomy
S0415	antinomy
S0417	antinomy how it be to me
S0415	yeah that's very good what's with the upside down with the es like tym like i mean
S0417	what
S0415	what get me mad be that the people who write these things i know guy linguists like write this kind of shit and then oh that'll make it easier for other people to understand and pronounce it and there's all these funny stupid symbols like upside down es that nobody could possibly understand
S0417	yeah but they've get to use something and if we don't learn it
S0415	course they do but why don't they just do it phonetically instead of these mad symbols
S0416	how do you how do you pronounce an upside down e
S0417	i think that be do phonetically
S0415	well an upside down e
S0417	i don't yeah i don't understand
S0415	ta dah
S0416	how how do you pronounce an upside down e

S0416	be it like
S0415	or maybe maybe it's a it's pronounce like an e
S0415	tiname
S0417	you know if you think about it it's probably the simplest way we can do it if you want to say e but in a different the way e be spell
S0415	aha why don't they just put e
S0417	no but there might be two there's two different things of e so one be upside down
S0416	and how do you say the other one
S0417	can you just keep sit down he keep like pop up like a
S0415	like a meerkat
S0416	i know but i'm put my
S0415	or those things that that
S0416	want to make a valid point while i be stand up
S0415	you see antinomy antinomy as we've now
S0417	yeah
S0415	antinomy be actually just if you flick the m and the n the m and the n you get antimony which be actually an element
S0417	oh right
S0415	so so antimony be an element but antinomy be the word which be exactly the kind of word title because it's a contradiction between two beliefs and conclusions that be themselves reasonable
S0417	can you scrape that into the
S0415	or a paradox
S0415	it's like a fancy old word for a paradox or a contradiction between two beliefs or conclusions that be themselves reasonable
S0417	yeah
S0415	but yeah it's exactly what my book
S0417	can you stop bring that don't bring that
S0415	which be exactly the subtext of my book
S0416	i wasn't go to
S0417	yeah
S0415	it's amaze but nobody's go to have a oh nobody's go to have a clue when we and actually as well you know when they show on google the mention of all the word
S0417	yeah
S0415	you can actually click into it and then you can see whether it's like go like really small like five mention or five million mention or
S0417	yeah
S0416	may i please leave the table

S0415	no no when you click in the thing show me the word it it actually say
S0417	oh
S0415	between eighteen hundred and two thousand and eight from the corpus english remember the argument we have yesterday
S0417	oh yeah
S0415	about the corpus now it's like suddenly never hear of that word in that context and now in the last twenty four hours find it in two contexts
S0417	oh yeah yeah
S0415	it's like
S0415	but i wish they could show it to some rather than cos it actually give you really really really really low percentages think there be like ten thousandths of a percentage which be annoy want to know as well whether it's use in all the capitals all the lower case or with capital that's just mad crap
S0417	yeah
S0415	course all they do be scan a whole load of book and then they didn't do any of this work anyway good
S0417	yeah it's as much as how much it be mention in paper
S0415	in everything they scan within eight hundred thousand
S0417	wonder how much have be scan so far they should scan like the erm irish archive for example they be the kind of things they should be scan right now but they'll take
S0415	scan everything in the world
S0417	really
S0415	that's why there be more publishers but like they they can scan all the things that be out of copyright like you know pride and prejudice for example
S0417	yeah
S0415	all those classics be publish by all publishers because they're classics and out of copyright and this copyright thing be insidious cos the americans be lunatics keep add on years on copyright so like in term of music like in other countries like it's the life of the artist plus whatever five years whatever it be but in in america corporations keep get little legislators to add on years so like nothing have come out of copyright into common use so like even in america now like it's two thousand and fifteen now they the most modern music you can use out of copyright be something like nineteen twenty eight
S0417	oh
S0415	and like or nineteen twenty there's a new block come out this year like it's that far behind which be ridiculous consider
S0417	yeah
S0415	you know like you can't use any of that old swing jazz and crap
S0417	yeah
S0415	now it's like
