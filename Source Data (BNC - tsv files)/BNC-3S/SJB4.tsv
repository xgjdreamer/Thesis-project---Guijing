S0197	right at
S0192	out of the game
S0197	at the begin of every go well now we need to allocate these now to to the countries that you want to defend and or attack from
S0192	okay but
S0197	and the object of the game be to take over the
S0192	the whole thing
S0197	the whole world yeah
S0192	but do you remember you say we need thirty five of these and there be a bunch of spar
S0197	yeah well you

S0197	well you you lose them but you can also win them back at the begin of your go and by collect these card
S0192	okay so i keep two separate pile of these there's the spar and then there's my
S0197	well the thirty five will go well the rest of the thirty five will go on the board in a second
S0192	and what about the spare ones be what i'm ask
S0197	well
S0192	cos there be like forty five or something
S0197	yeah well you you when you lose armies they'll go in there and then when you get armies at the begin of the go they come from that bite from that yeah
S0192	you can take some out
S0197	yeah
S0192	so let's separate i'll do what you guy be do with these things
S0197	someone didn't put iceland down
S0192	be that cos no one's get it or
S0197	well
S0192	be there a card miss

S0199	so it wasn't your grandad's
S0197	no i buy it
S0192	it's not that old
S0192	risk armies
S0199	it's about twenty eight years old do you say about 's age
S0197	it's gotta be older than that
S0192	be this the limit of how many armies you can have in each place
S0197	if you hold the whole of the continent that's how many armies you get at the begin of your go there be an iceland but
S0192	oh
S0197	so someone didn't put a thing on
S0192	so we need to count who's miss one
S0199	how many okay i've get one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
S0192	i've get thirteen
S0192	how many have you get
S0197	hold on i think i count fourteen then one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen i've get

S0197	how many have you get
S0192	three four five six nine ten eleven twelve thirteen i've only get thirteen
S0197	and how many have you get
S0199	i've get one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
S0197	must be yours then
S0192	thirteen

S0192	fourteen the same as me
S0199	be that right hold on one two three four
S0192	five
S0199	five six seven eight nine

S0197	three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen it's yours then
S0192	so it's me but do i just not get deal it over there
S0197	no you'd have be the you just must have miss it or it get stick together or something
S0192	oh sorry
S0199	probably get stick together
S0192	so i get iceland
S0199	i'm glad it's not me cos you all look at me as if to say oh mum
S0192	it might be me wasn't it typical
S0192	we've get enough dice there
S0197	yeah
S0199	how many do we need
S0197	hold on well you if you're attack you have three if you're defend you have two
S0192	i really don't understand what's happen
S0197	you will you will
S0199	no me neither
S0197	and then to go from attack from one country to another then you have to have at least er three on there and then you'd be can only attack adjoin er countries or if it's get a dot line so brazil can attack north africa and
S0192	oh by boat
S0197	north north africa can attack western europe or whatever
S0192	oh okay so this count as one and this count as
S0197	that's an army yeah
S0192	two armies
S0197	that count as five
S0192	five armies
S0197	and the other one count as ten
S0192	so five of these be one of these
S0197	yeah
S0192	okay and ten of these be one of these
S0197	yeah
S0192	okay alright oh
S0192	oh
S0199	bless you
S0197	excuse me

S0192	yeah my eye aren't very good
S0199	have you have them test
S0192	yes many years ago and do you remember i get glass and then i never wear them

S0197	smell very musty don't it
S0199	oh it do yeah
S0192	i want to smell
S0197	smell them musty card
S0192	very musty
S0197	right now you take turn to put one on
S0197	one on each
S0192	why's that tickle you so much
S0199	the way you say it most people would say oh let me have a smell and it's just the way i want to smell
S0197	i want to smell it
S0199	i don't wanna be leave out
S0199	let me smell
S0192	i want my bite of
S0199	come on then whose go
S0197	now you take it in turn to put an army on each
S0192	oh without pull a card or do anything
S0197	yeah
S0199	and be this an army
S0192	be there any card be there not even any card there
S0197	that's your card there
S0192	right
S0197	and you only get a card if you can if you take another country and then at the
S0197	at the end of the go then you get a card and then if you get one er in erm artillery erm infantry or cavalry or whatever it be you get three of them and then you get ten ten extra go ten extra armies
S0192	okay
S0197	at the begin of your go if you hold a whole continent then you get the the amount of armies that correspond down there
S0192	be we gonna have enough time for two game of this
S0197	i doubt it
S0192	and this no okay can we then can we play for like twenty minutes and then start again
S0197	yeah
S0192	so i understand
S0199	really
S0192	be that alright yeah i mean
S0199	okay
S0192	that's that's fair isn't it
S0197	that's fair yeah
S0192	so i kind of get the hang of it
S0199	if i'd have say that to you you'd have say no just pick it up as you go along
S0197	well it's it's not an not a particularly easy game you have load of go before you understand it
S0197	and now you seem to have forget
S0199	i haven't
S0192	i just need twenty minutes
S0199	i've already have load of game
S0192	as long as i play like two or three round then then we should start again
S0199	right i
S0192	because i've probably fluff it by that point
S0199	i'm so glad you've say that cos i have no idea what i'm do
S0192	cool
S0199	right go
S0197	right
S0192	you just say we just put one down in the place
S0199	right so we just choose where we want to defend
S0192	in order or anything go
S0197	you're suppose to do it in order so you you the cos er you just sort of clump them all on there and then everybody be gonna clump them everywhere but
S0192	so i'm gonna be look for where i can invade
S0197	yeah and where you can hold
S0199	you can only put one on at a time
S0197	that's the idea
S0192	how do you attack someone else
S0199	so you have to stay in your own
S0192	when you've get five only when you've get five can you
S0199	country don't you you can't like i can't suddenly put that there can i
S0197	no that's on my country you can't
S0199	exactly
S0199	that's what i'm say i'll have to stay on pink
S0192	glad we clarify that
S0199	he be just about to do it weren't you
S0197	that be quite an obvious rule
S0192	right
S0199	not to the other side apparently
S0192	so do you have any tactical advice look at where my piece be
S0197	erm well to hold europe be border by a lot of countries so it's border by asia and it's obviously africa can attack er part of north america gonna attack cos as i would say it's difficult to hold
S0192	okay
S0197	even though you get your five armies at the begin of each of every go it's difficult to hold it's er same with asia a lot of countries can attack it
S0192	okay
S0197	and you can attack from alaska to kamchatka
S0192	oh it cross over
S0197	cos it cross over there
S0192	okay
S0197	so you can either attack from this side as well
S0192	so so mum's get a good hold then with a bite of that and that that's kind of like a
S0199	oh
S0197	well you get a lot of point there's seven at the begin of each go and five but they're difficult to hold whereas australia you've only get one
S0192	oh be that what these pin be
S0199	oh
S0192	so you've only get one at one a way to get in through siam so siam can attack indonesia but you only get two you only get two down here as well it would be south america
S0199	who keep the point
S0192	explain to me what this mean
S0197	no two armies
S0199	oh
S0197	so if i if i hold all of south america at the begin of my go then i get two extra armies
S0192	oh okay so you oh okay
S0197	and you could put them wherever you want
S0192	ah so you've gotta hold the whole of something
S0199	how do you know if you've hold it
S0197	well cos your that colour would be blue
S0199	right
S0197	or the other one
S0192	so i wanna get australia
S0199	okay
S0192	or cos i'm near there i've get a couple of piece here so it doesn't give me much but it doesn't take much to kill you here if i get that
S0199	so how do you get mine
S0192	i don't really i think once i've get five
S0197	we'll get to the
S0192	i can invade
S0197	well at least three
S0192	oh three to invade
S0197	three
S0192	oh not five
S0197	no
S0199	so so right you've get
S0197	but we'll get to that in a minute
S0199	okay
S0192	right so 's put down one what be you put down
S0199	i've put mine down on there
S0192	right well arbitrarily place this on this oh i don't know whether i'd wanna put one in here or put another one in this one probably another on in this one wouldn't it
S0197	yeah i guess so
S0192	so then you've have your go mum
S0197	but then that can't attack the blue
S0199	why
S0192	ah
S0197	cos it's not join
S0192	ah bugger so really i start with these no i can attack mum though can't i and once i've attack that one i can take that one can't i
S0197	yeah you can do that
S0199	thank you for warn me
S0192	so it's my go again so i can move with three yeah
S0197	you could yeah three against one could go
S0192	so i can kill her
S0197	you could do
S0192	but that's bad because she'll just move in here
S0199	so if i have three in here
S0197	no you like you don't wanna leave yourself too thin
S0199	so if i have three
S0197	cos you cos you've gotta be hold at the begin of your go not at the end of your go so if you leave yourself thin and just leave yourself one on there and mum's get load on there so you just just attack you you'd take that one and move one army and you don't get any the next go so
S0192	oh so i need to leave something there
S0199	so if i have three on here wouldn't be able to attack me
S0197	well he could do yeah but then it would be quite a battle
S0199	well
S0192	oh there's a battle be there
S0199	who would win
S0192	roll the dice be it
S0197	well it's it's the roll of the dice

S0192	well count how many piece one two three four he's have four go i've have one two three go
S0197	and you've have one two three it's your go
S0192	oh so can i place a piece can i move and then place a piece or do i have to place a piece first and then move
S0197	in what do you mean
S0192	so
S0192	it's my go and i wanna attack her with these
S0197	yeah well you don't you can't move into a country until you've attack her so you have to attack from there so you so i'd go in from indonesia

S0197	why michael parkinson

S0197	bite random innit michael parkinson
S0199	well say david attenborough
S0192	david attenborough that's not random it's the voice of god
S0192	i mean can you imagine if
S0199	jam mason
S0197	that's the voice of god
S0199	yeah
S0192	the queen that would be a bite strange wouldn't it
S0199	come on tell me what be i do
S0192	well you need to say i'm gonna attack such and such to such and such
S0192	oh god i leave him here i didn't mean to do that
S0199	what before i shake the dice
S0197	yeah you've get to say
S0199	you can't move him cos that be your one country
S0192	no i know yeah
S0197	you're gonna say i attack from
S0199	okay
S0197	from somewhere to somewhere else
S0199	oh excuse you
S0192	that be not me
S0192	mum you keep fart all night and you blame it on
S0199	squeaky chair i'm go to attack
S0192	that's my duck impression
S0199	eastern australia
S0197	that's me then
S0199	yeah
S0197	so okay so mum can throw three dice cos she get three armies
S0192	okay
S0197	and i only get one oops i only get one army
S0199	you've get none now
S0192	but it's still
S0197	so i can throw
S0197	only throw one dice
S0192	where do that go
S0199	why be you cough like that
S0192	cos i've be smoke
S0199	oh do it go away when you stop
S0192	yes except for the asthma bite
S0197	and if you're defend and your your dice number equal the attacker's number then the defender win
S0192	oh
S0197	and it they've get a slight advantage with that way but they've get a disadvantage cos they only kind of they've gotta throw less dice
S0192	okay so
S0197	you you can throw three dice and if she
S0192	so for example if she roll a four now and you roll a four
S0197	i win
S0199	mum to you
S0192	but then she's get two more die
S0199	she the cat's mother
S0197	well just throw them all at the same time
S0192	oh so if she's not gonna roll a four
S0199	mum
S0192	she's like
S0197	and you always have to throw first and attack her
S0199	i have to
S0197	i wonder
S0192	what's wrong with you
S0199	she her it
S0192	why have you always hat that
S0192	they're pronouns they're there to replace nouns
S0199	right what do i do shake the dice
S0197	and just yeah just roll
S0192	he's just explain
S0199	yeah but i didn't understand
S0192	tally that how good's your maths
S0197	six
S0199	i haven't get six
S0192	that's not six be it
S0197	there's a six it's the highest dice
S0199	oh
S0197	you've only get you've only get one dice
S0192	oh you only count the highest
S0197	yes
S0199	oh okay
S0192	oh you don't add them all together
S0197	no
S0192	cos then i think there's no way that you can win
S0197	so i've get a five so i lose a an army
S0192	so that just
S0197	yeah er you reckon
S0192	you're not have that
S0199	well that be easy
S0197	so like you're back in there and that's it and you'd have to move some armies into eastern australia
S0192	how many
S0199	what some new ones
S0197	no no just
S0192	how do you make new ones again oh just one be it
S0197	that's it
S0199	just i can have as many as i like
S0197	well you can move two if you want it's up to you
S0199	erm
S0192	move all three
S0199	oh
S0192	mm
S0197	well it can't be three cos you've gotta the be the country occupy
S0199	oh yeah
S0192	and you can't so you can't empty it and you can't
S0199	i think i'm gonna leave on
S0197	no
S0199	cos you've get quite a few over there
S0192	okay so erm
S0199	it's your go then
S0192	yeah
S0199	so
S0197	be that it
S0199	yeah
S0192	oh do she get another go
S0199	well i don't know what do you mean what do you mean
S0197	well you can attack as many countries as you want it's up to you but if you as soon as you take another country
S0192	oh right so mum do mum do all
S0197	you can have a card
S0199	as soon as i've take another country
S0197	you can have a card
S0199	okay
S0192	oh so do she keep attack until she lose
S0197	well no i don't cos then you can leave yourself yourself a bite thin
S0199	so what do i do with that card
S0192	but you how many time how many go do she get i'm a bite confuse on that front
S0197	you can attack as many time as you want
S0192	in her round so it's her go she can attack as many time as she want if she decide to attack
S0197	and if she's take a country then she can say okay i've stop then you get a card
S0199	okay okay
S0192	okay
S0199	i'm not ready to quit yet
S0197	carry on then
S0199	i'm go to attack
S0192	and when you've finish you take a card
S0197	yeah
S0192	and what happen to the card how's that bite
S0197	and then if you get three of each that's different ones that's the joker so that capture anything so if you get a er infantry cavalry artillery then you get ten extra go at the begin of your go
S0192	oh
S0199	i'm go to attack eastern unite state
S0197	go on
S0192	don't you need three power of three
S0197	from where
S0192	to attack it
S0199	oh
S0192	be that right
S0197	yeah
S0192	you need three of these things
S0197	yeah
S0199	i'm go to attack the northwest territory
S0197	you certainly need more than you can you can attack with two but you only throw two dice
S0199	i so
S0192	oh so you can attack
S0197	but you can't you can't
S0192	you can attack with two then it doesn't
S0197	yeah
S0199	look i'm go to war
S0197	but you can't attack somebody that's get two on there as well it's a bite more complicate but go on then but you can't attack there cos it's not join
S0192	that's the simplest rule we'll stick with that one first shall we
S0199	what
S0192	you've get to attack join then
S0199	i i could if i have two on there
S0197	no you
S0192	could she attack one on one
S0197	yeah but you can only throw one dice you can't lose the country if you're attack
S0199	you can't lose the country if you're attack
S0197	yeah so you can't
S0192	how would she lose the country if my die be higher would i
S0197	yeah
S0192	then invade her
S0197	so you can't attack one army against one army
S0199	no no i'd have to have two
S0197	because if you be to lose you can't you can't lose you're not allow to lose your country
S0192	okay
S0197	if you're attack
S0199	okay
S0192	so you need that
S0197	and then if if you do win you can't move any army it cos you
S0199	no i know no i i know i can't do that cos i've only get one army there
S0197	yeah
S0192	glad we come to that conclusion
S0197	yeah and
S0199	and i need three
S0197	you can't attack there because it's not there's nothing border it that you can't attack on
S0192	so we've do the can'ts let's do the can
S0199	so i can't even go in there if i want to if i have two or three
S0197	jesus no
S0199	armies there i couldn't do it
S0192	yeah this must have be
S0197	well no yeah yeah you can er if if if you have like ten armies on there then yeah you could attack there
S0192	how on earth do this play when mum have them all in one thing
S0199	so how many armies
S0192	i don't really understand
S0199	how many armies
S0197	be you listen to a word that be come out of my mouth
S0199	yes just wait a minute
S0197	you've gotta have more than one army on there
S0199	that's what i just say
S0197	well there isn't any more than one army on there
S0199	but then you say yeah but then you say at the end of that but then you can't attack anyway cos it's not adjoin
S0192	yeah well it's
S0197	well no you say there
S0192	you can only attack from here to here
S0199	no i never
S0192	you do you say
S0197	you say i wanna attack eastern unite state
S0192	and we well
S0199	no i say northwest territory
S0192	oh yeah right right right
S0199	i change cos you say i can't cos it's not adjoin and i realise that
S0192	chop and change chop and change
S0199	anyway
S0197	so you're attack now be you
S0199	yeah i'm attack the northwest territory
S0197	go on then
S0199	so i throw
S0197	you throw three
S0199	three
S0199	five
S0192	oh five
S0197	five so that's one for you
S0192	why be this one really off centre
S0199	why
S0197	cos i win
S0199	no i have five
S0197	yeah well my five beat your five
S0192	but he's defend so his it's
S0197	you don't listen
S0192	five it's yours
S0199	i it's not a matter me not listen
S0192	what be it then
S0199	it's a matter of me not understand
S0197	okay well in
S0197	i if it i'm defend so my dice beat yours
S0199	beat beat mine
S0197	if it equal
S0192	where'd you get this dodgy dice from
S0199	okay
S0192	that's get er one that's not even
S0199	right i'm gonna stop now
S0192	not even in the middle
S0199	cos i need to learn
S0192	doesn't she have to stop anyway cos she lose
S0199	do i get a card
S0197	no you carry on
S0192	she can just keep go
S0197	you keep go as long as you want yeah
S0192	be there any reason to keep go like
S0199	might get a bite bore if someone keep go
S0197	er i don't think there be at the begin
S0192	if you just keep attack ours
S0197	well you can er you can leave yourself too thin
S0199	it's a tactical game isn't it
S0197	and then if you get at the begin of the the game you're not actually make any armies cos you haven't get many card you obviously haven't get any continents to to get your get your armies as well
S0192	egypt's mine by the way i'd get out
S0199	okay right do i get a card now
S0197	you get a card cos you've get eastern australia
S0199	and what do i do now with this card
S0197	you just keep it until you've get a set
S0192	oh so
S0199	what's that mean
S0192	if she win more than one she get another card
S0197	that's it mean there's a joker it mean anything
S0199	okay so you'll explain to me at some point what i can do with a joker

S0197	oh right
S0192	kind of more complicate than this you have a whole bunch of different wheel and like you have the throne and thing in like one there's a lot to it it's a lot more complicate than this but it's effectively the same thing you have a map and you're try to control the different areas on it and they've build like expansions so you can get other board that like add to it so you've get like

S0197	alaska
S0199	alaska oh that look
S0192	i mean this be completely miss out the philippines where be the philippines
S0199	what about so it's only here i can
S0192	where be the philippines
S0197	ain't this be the philippines under here
S0192	no that's indonesia i've be to indonesia and the philippines but i've be to bali which be there and lombok this this be borneo
S0199	i stop
S0192	maybe that's the philippines but they've put it under as indonesia
S0199	ta
S0192	i mean where's malaysia that should be malaysia and half of borneo be malaysia terrible where's the andaman islands this be all wrong
S0197	be this the
S0192	it's not
S0199	mm
S0192	guernsey
S0199	stop
S0192	sheppey isles or whatever they be
S0197	half the islands
S0192	yeah
S0197	where be they then
S0197	right do you get two
S0192	me
S0197	yeah
S0192	oh oh yeah yes i do right where's the strategic place to put them where would you put them
S0197	erm probably on indonesia
S0199	ouch fuck
S0192	why
S0197	well i'd start build up from that direction
S0192	you just don't want me take back africa do you
S0197	well no you or that
S0192	i mean i'm not gonna take the entirety of europe with with bloody indonesia
S0197	no but as soon as you've get that part of of the world you should have concentrate on keep that protect them two point every single game you're get two point and you just keep build up and then it's
S0192	so as long as i don't lose this i haven't lose right
S0197	no exactly yeah
S0192	and as long as i just keep build it up
S0197	and it's quite a strategic place cos it can only be attack from one area and if you get onto siam then that's always gonna be protect in every single game you're get two point whereas this be a good base to have as well cos you can only be attack from two side and see as i've get this as well
S0192	you just don't want me to take back africa i feel i'm gonna listen to his advice you watch now i'm not gonna do anything else but just keep put troop here until i've get all of my troop
S0192	thirty five of them and then i'm take them
S0197	if you take
S0199	and you can never lose
S0197	if you take if you take siam then move everything into siam and then make siam your strong point
S0199	or you could take africa and brazil
S0192	but if i love siam
S0199	and make this your strong point

S0197	at the moment they're just stick there
S0199	the last time i think i put all of them just in this country and that
S0197	you do you
S0199	take and win

S0197	egypt
S0199	i be like like that
S0192	in egypt
S0197	get six and five
S0199	sixty five
S0192	five and one
S0199	you lose egypt
S0192	i do yeah alexandropolis have fall
S0199	oh don't ponder too hard
S0192	well it's clearly a game of skill
S0199	well you know we know you've get hundreds there so just put a handful in
S0192	i be play chinese chess with dad today that be quite fun
S0199	be you what's that then
S0192	i recommend try it erm it's like chess but it's not like chess you get some other piece there's one call the cannon which jump over other piece it can say if i've get the cannon here and you've get a piece here there's only one piece on the same line i can't do anything but once another piece come in i can shoot over the piece and it kill things over another piece it's quite interest
S0199	so be it a normal chess board
S0192	it look like the chess except there's something call the river in the middle and certain piece can't cross the river and the king live in the palace in a box and in the palace the king can only move like that way within the palace and he's get two minister that can move diagonally within the palace it's basically the same but not it completely change the game
S0197	same board
S0192	yeah it look pretty much the same except there's a river in the middle and a and a palace that everyone's get and there's a couple of different piece there's the cannon and and the and the erm the minister but otherwise there's still rook and bishops and all that kind of stuff you pick it up really easily if you know chess but it's definitely get a few different rule it's quite fun i be play it today i buy him a chess set for his birthday a couple of years ago or something like a chinese chess set but the problem be that it be all with like chinese symbols so he be er struggle to actually memorise what it be
S0192	so he's get like a ipad version which be
S0199	oh okay
S0192	er much quicker 's ipad
S0199	yeah
S0197	mm
S0192	i'd recommend play it
S0197	east africa

S0199	i want it to be
S0192	no that's not gonna happen be it that's alright where's where's go you know and
S0199	i've no idea
S0192	no
S0199	could find out they're probably with their mum
S0192	and that lot
S0199	they'll be at home with the kid
S0192	not very popular be we this part of the family
S0199	no
S0192	nobody want to be with us and that lot
S0199	the trouble be it's like we can't get and everyone over because we can't get them over with the car
S0192	just leave one of them behind
S0192	don't need the newest one
S0199	we'll leave him in the house all day long
S0192	yeah
S0199	he's walk now
S0192	be he
S0199	yeah he be walk at eleven months
S0192	well do i'm sure he'll be erm top set at school
S0192	know what i mean pretty clear isn't it that
S0199	oh you're twitch my legs again
S0192	if they're walk at eleven months they're obviously gonna be a genius i hate it when people be like actually i don't really get it people look at children and like wow he's amaze at four doesn't matter doesn't matter at all like i mean i don't mean to be harsh but just cos 's great at kick a ball at five doesn't mean he's gonna be any good at ten
S0199	no
S0192	he could have a grow spurt and
S0199	no it doesn't
S0192	and be all gangly and like
S0199	yeah totally
S0192	can't kick the ball around
S0199	totally
S0192	i find it's strange when people get really into their children be really good at something when they're really young
S0199	they're just proud
S0192	and just like well it doesn't really matter do it until they're like if they're good at something when they're about fifteen or sixteen maybe they'll be good at it when they're older
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	but if they're good at it when they're five i mean maybe if you get him play the trumpet now and he
S0199	mm
S0192	persist with it
S0199	mm
S0192	for the next fifteen years then yeah maybe he'll be good but i'm not say it's a bad thing
S0199	take a lot of no take a lot of erm
S0192	it's definitely good to pay interest in in in in your children and to
S0199	a lot of dedication and a lot of practice
S0192	and to erm get them do all that kind of stuff go
S0199	to to be
S0192	everyone seem to be well into their children
S0199	extra good at something
S0192	oh my child's do this at four and like it doesn't mean shit it doesn't mean anything do it
S0199	yeah but that's cos you haven't get children and you've not go through that experience at the moment
S0192	everyone think it's great their child's do something everyone's child be gonna be good at something at four surely
S0199	yeah
S0199	i think it's just erm
S0192	i mean i'm not gonna lie 's be pretty good on his feet and all that kind of stuff
S0199	but as you say in another five years' time he might be totally feed up with it and doesn't wanna know
S0192	yeah yeah
S0199	but erm
S0192	the problem be with children be they grow
S0199	mm
S0192	and when they grow they get really gangly and they can't like control their limbs properly
S0199	mm
S0192	so he could go through a massive growth spurt at like ten and then be like
S0199	reckon he might be a six foot
S0192	do he reckon yeah
S0199	i say really he say yeah i think he might but then his dad's tall isn't he
S0192	yeah yeah
S0199	but erm he's certainly grow he's not the smallest in his class by any mean he's doesn't look any different to any of the other children now
S0192	no
S0199	but
S0192	i didn't think he'd grow that much in two years when i come back i think cos i'd see him on skype maybe
S0199	yeah i think that do make a difference doesn't it
S0192	definitely have i not see him at all for two years
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	i reckon he'd seem bigger
S0199	yeah
S0192	but i guess because i'd just see him on skype a couple of weekend before
S0199	walk in and yeah
S0192	it's be like
S0199	yeah
S0192	the outcome
S0199	yeah
S0192	it's the same as
S0199	it be it be a bite like that isn't it
S0192	definitely look older in the face oh he's look old now isn't he
S0192	he's
S0199	oh god he's age
S0192	in his fives
S0192	it's crazy to be five
S0199	i know
S0192	you know what i mean you're five years old
S0199	i say to sometimes when we talk to him i say i forget he's only five
S0192	mm i mean at the same time five years be a long time
S0199	yeah
S0192	it take him a long time at the same time at the same time you're like well he's only five well like it take them until they're like twenty
S0199	and then on the in the other breath you're think
S0192	to actually get a head on their shoulder
S0199	how the hell do he get to five where do that five years go
S0192	yeah where do five years go
S0199	kind of thing
S0192	well it take him a long time to be independent like
S0199	mm
S0192	as animals go you know i mean gazelle be up and run like immediately
S0199	he do make us laugh what be it he be he be give it all out in the garden with his friends play football and kind of like you know do the kind of walk cocky kind of walk and then he they go home and he come in and go can i watch peter rabbit
S0199	so you think oh bless he's still so little
S0192	yeah well he's five
S0199	i know it be kind of like he be act all big and tough out in the garden
S0192	he's he's be alive for five years alive
S0199	mm
S0192	alive that's it like prior to five years ago he didn't exist
S0199	i know
S0192	where it didn't happen it's weird
S0199	it be really crazy
S0192	very strange so yeah why do it take them i'd consider have a child a bite more if you know by the time they're like eight they be ready to leave home
S0192	and the you know what i mean
S0192	and nowadays
S0199	you wouldn't want them to at eight though
S0192	no i'm not say you want them to but they can like if you want them to and they can
S0199	if you be sit here with your son
S0192	i don't know
S0199	you'd be think
S0192	i think eight years would be enough really
S0192	i don't think we need them any longer than that
S0199	it's very good if you haven't get any
S0192	i mean eight years be a hell of a long time as well to be do the same thing you know what i mean eight years so eighteen years and then even then you're just no i mean
S0199	twenty eight years
S0192	take you twenty four years to get rid of
S0192	and he might come back yet
S0199	he go and come he go and come back
S0192	twenty there's no guarantee anymore that they leave home
S0199	no
S0192	they could stay with you forever
S0199	that's true
S0192	that's a long old commitment
S0199	it be
S0192	i can't make that kind of commitment okay at the minute i can't even stay in the same place for more than a year so how be i gonna commit i literally have not live in the same house for more than a year for the last ten years so how be i gonna stay in the same place for eighteen years or twenty years or whatever it be
S0199	well you wouldn't need to would you not to begin with
S0192	well i'm not gonna move school with them every few years i mean that's gonna be terrible
S0199	no no exactly but to begin with they don't go to school till they're four do they
S0192	i can't move them around anyhow can i well i guess i could
S0199	well i no you couldn't you couldn't
S0192	it's a bite stressful on the child though isn't it if not with me it would be a bite difficult try to move into a new property and try to make do with not have very much but have a child as well it's
S0199	bloody hell you're not ready for a child no way
S0192	no no won't ever be not mature enough not ready for a kid
S0199	you're just not there yet
S0192	yet as if i'm gonna be there
S0199	well you might be
S0192	not sure if i will you know what i mean
S0199	and you might find that
S0192	i might not be
S0199	erm my no you might not be but if you when and if you do you'd probably be like oh my god anxious and jesus christ and all of this but when that child come and you hold that child in your arm it will just blow your mind
S0192	it's game over isn't it after that
S0199	no but you wouldn't be think about it that way
S0192	well i dunno if i think about it that way now why wouldn't i think about if i have a child
S0192	i feel like my man 's go game over friend's go
S0199	why be he go
S0192	cos he's go isn't he
S0199	he's just commit in other areas at the moment
S0192	i mean
S0199	he'll be there and he'll come back
S0192	in my for me he's go he's not go for himself just for his friend but
S0199	no no but i mean er friendship wise he's just
S0192	well i mean for the uni period it's man down isn't it
S0199	he have priorities
S0192	you're not gonna he's not gonna come to the gather
S0199	oh that's true yeah
S0192	or anything like that and he's not gonna be you know he can't come and visit me wherever i'm live or anything like that it's man down game game over he's move into a different stage of life and that's it
S0199	mm
S0192	they're go now
S0199	but it but
S0192	he's move into the adult realm of you know
S0199	mm
S0192	have kid all his
S0199	it's not the adult realm be it it's just that he's change direction
S0192	well give him a year or two
S0199	not single
S0192	and all of his friends will be people that have children
S0199	mm
S0192	i'm pretty sure
S0199	mm
S0192	he's not gonna hang around with people that don't have kid
S0199	why would you not why would you lose your friends just because they don't have children it just mean
S0192	because they're not on the same wavelength as you be they they're not
S0199	yeah but that's nice to have friends with other kind of interest and stuff isn't it
S0192	i don't see it happen
S0199	you don't always wanna talk baby talk and you know
S0192	no i mean well if your baby get older if you're still talk about baby when your baby's eight
S0199	mm
S0192	bite stupid isn't it
S0199	i mean yeah of course you mix with people parent and stuff from their school and stuff
S0192	just from my observations most people that have children tend to hang out with other people that have children
S0199	mm
S0192	because you end up go you know you take your kid to the party and then you meet the parent
S0199	mm mm
S0192	of the kid that have the party you know
S0199	it's the way that you can actually get out and socialise
S0192	yeah and you know your mat don't wanna come round anymore if you're not gonna be crack open the wine you're gonna be crack out the cafetière you know what you know what i mean
S0192	and your you'll be put the child to bed at eight o'clock and you've gotta be quiet there's no more dance around in the live room at two in the morning it's not gonna happen
S0199	or show your hairy bum
S0192	no
S0192	it's not gonna happen so it's man down man down so whatever that's life it just happen
S0199	mm it's life for some not all
S0192	most
S0199	well you and
S0192	most
S0199	might be different mightn't you
S0192	well certainly the people we know will be different i've get good friends now that i'm pretty sure aren't gonna have children
S0199	what about and do you think they will
S0192	not the way they talk neither of them want children erm i mean the thing be i don't know if there be many people that be adamant that i don't want children that end up have children you know what i mean most most people that have children never say i don't want children they've always say that they want children you know what i mean
S0199	mm mm
S0192	so and
S0199	do
S0192	and don't want children and i don't really want children there's a very small part of us that you know maybe if we get everything in the right place we'd have kid and then the same with erm and they don't really want children maybe maybe if they get settle at some point and they don't want kid i've get a bunch of friends now the i guess they're the type of people that live abroad i don't
S0199	mm
S0192	see it
S0199	well maybe they just haven't finish their journey at the moment
S0192	see life a bite differently
S0199	mm
S0192	the problem be your
S0199	and maybe the other
S0192	your biology isn't it
S0199	and
S0192	it doesn't matter if you come to that term most of
S0199	but then also i be just gonna say the older you get and the more you be able to do you then it's hard to give up on that isn't it
S0192	yeah a little bite
S0199	because you know that you'd have to settle down and you'd have to not travel quite as much and
S0192	there's no way i could have a child now
S0199	it's a huge commitment
S0192	cos i'd resent it can you imagine if you resent your own child
S0199	no
S0192	it must be horrific
S0199	mm
S0192	like i couldn't do that to another live be i couldn't if there's a risk that i'm gonna resent my child
S0199	so if fell pregnant
S0192	i hope she'd have an abortion to tell you honestly
S0199	really
S0192	yeah
S0199	would you leave that as her decision
S0192	i mean why be it just her decision because it's her body well i mean
S0199	yeah and because emotionally it would affect her more
S0192	but i mean it's quite a big decision
S0199	yeah
S0192	i don't think just because we have sex that i should have to commit to have a child for the rest of my life
S0199	mm
S0192	i don't think that's very fair erm i think it should be er sixty forty split personally of course it should weigh slightly more on the lady's side
S0199	mm
S0192	but
S0199	mm
S0192	the fact of the matter be pretty much in this day and age if the woman want to have the child we're screw
S0199	mm
S0192	and we've gotta pay for it for the rest of our live
S0199	mm
S0192	that's not very fair be it
S0199	mm
S0192	just cos you don't wanna have an abortion
S0199	mm
S0192	i mean it's a fairly straightforward procedure that pretty much most people have i know it's not nice and you shouldn't have to go through it but
S0199	what do you mean most people have most people don't
S0192	don't they most of my friends have but i guess maybe i'm with friends that be of those kind of people
S0199	clearly
S0192	have have have numerous people i've
S0199	have
S0192	yeah
S0199	your
S0192	yeah
S0199	really
S0192	yeah
S0199	when do that happen
S0192	when she be about twenty
S0199	with you
S0192	no that wasn't with me it be just before she meet me so maybe a year before she meet me so maybe like seventeen eighteen
S0199	oh god
S0192	not with me no erm i'm probably infertile as far as i know one can only hope erm i wouldn't i could not force her to do it but she know how i feel about it and she feel the same but we be extremely careful
S0199	do she say that as in kind of oh my god if i fell pregnant i'd get rid of it
S0192	not so explicitly i mean we get i guess we i guess we get really really worry about six months no maybe about a maybe about six months ago cos her implant go out of date and she start kind of have symptoms a little bite and i think she be just a bite sick but it make us think at that time we get really nervous and really worry and it make us just totally go i don't want a child neither of us want a child then and we be really nervous
S0199	mm mm
S0192	and it be just sort of
S0199	so it kind of make you realise that actually you know
S0192	no i mean if if you think it's gonna happen and and you're like wow we might have a child
S0199	yeah
S0192	then go for it have a child
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	but if you think it's gonna happen and it scar the shit out of you and you're just like this be the worst thing that could possibly happen right now
S0199	mm mm
S0192	i mean we we like stop touch each other for a bite you know what i mean just until it be certain and all that kind of stuff so
S0199	mm
S0192	erm and we stop the implant go out of date and we stop trust it after that even though it's be work she hasn't have a period in years years
S0199	mm
S0192	she just doesn't have them on er on the contraceptive
S0199	on this implant
S0192	erm she's this be the second implant she's have erm and they last for a couple of years i've never know her to have a period she spot a bite when she be younger on the pill but not really erm
S0199	be that what's suppose to happen with this implant
S0192	no it's vary you can do a
S0199	oh okay
S0192	a variety of things
S0199	yeah
S0192	erm about ten percent of people don't have a period and she's in that category
S0199	okay
S0192	erm so
S0199	do she still get the moods up and down kind of thing
S0192	no she's be lucky
S0199	so she's pretty kind of like level out
S0192	yeah so she's pretty worry now she's just have it remove it's all gonna you know put on weight get moody do all that kind of stuff so
S0199	she's have it take out now
S0192	yeah yeah it be take out last week
S0199	so when do she get another one put in then
S0192	she's not we er we don't want her on it particularly if she doesn't have to be on it so we're not we're just use condoms really
S0199	well that's risky then innit
S0192	i mean isn't that what most people do
S0199	well what's the percentage of a condom be that like
S0192	provide you use it correctly it's ninety nine point nine percent sure
S0199	oh okay
S0192	i mean they put spermicide in the things so provide you use it it doesn't break or anything like that it should be fine shouldn't it
S0199	and then if it break you get the morning after pill
S0192	yeah
S0199	yeah
S0192	just don't really want her keep pump herself with the hormones
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	you know what i mean
S0199	might actually help her skin as well if she come off it
S0192	yeah yeah
S0199	mind you i didn't notice her skin be bad at all
S0192	no
S0199	no
S0192	it come and go
S0199	yeah
S0192	it's pretty constant it come and go she she'll cover up with makeup if for er which i don't really like cos i think there's a vicious cycle of put on makeup cause spot then put on makeup
S0199	yeah
S0192	i try and tell her not to do it which she didn't the only time that she's ever not be when we be travel for an extend period but she still have spot but the problem be i try to tell her we be in a dirty country
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	not be that clean
S0199	yeah
S0192	if you come off of it and stop use it and we be clean
S0199	yeah
S0192	then i think you'd be alright
S0199	yeah
S0192	it be but whatever maybe the implant hasn't help but erm i mean i can't tell her what to do but she know how i feel so i'm sure that would sway her decision i don't want a child now
S0199	mm
S0192	if i have a
S0199	mm
S0192	if she i don't
S0199	she wouldn't want to have a child without you want it anyway
S0192	oh if she can you imagine the scenario i don't want a child she have one anyway
S0199	mm
S0192	that child be gonna have the shittest life ever
S0199	mm
S0192	i mean maybe i stay with her and then resent my own child for the rest of my life
S0199	mm mm
S0192	what kind of scenario be that
S0199	mm
S0192	she'd have an abortion i'm pretty sure
S0199	mm
S0192	i wouldn't force her into it but i guess through how she know how i be i guess that do force her into it a little bite a little bite
S0199	mm mm
S0192	but i think she feel the same but obviously she doesn't like the process so
S0199	mm
S0192	but it's a fairly modern thing i mean quite a few people do it you should not treat it as a form of contraception of course
S0199	no
S0192	but if the worst happen then you know what i mean
S0199	i i kind of understand if it happen you know accidentally and it happen and that's that but for it to happen repeatedly i just don't understand
S0192	what happen repeatedly
S0199	for for women to have
S0192	to have numerous abortions
S0199	yeah
S0192	no okay
S0199	i don't understand that at all
S0192	well then they're use it as a form of contraception aren't they
S0199	yeah
S0192	they're just be lazy and just like do whatever
S0199	and i don't agree with it be do later on when you think how quickly the baby form
S0192	no when they're older but the baby know nothing
S0199	that's not the point i just
S0192	absolutely nothing
S0199	just don't agree and how quickly the baby become a baby and rather than a foetus
S0192	until it breaths it's not live
S0199	oh
S0192	part of life be respiration we argue that there be seven life process to life and until it start breathe
S0199	so when you see a scan and see a baby and inside a lady and
S0192	doesn't know it doesn't know doesn't know
S0199	but well that's not quite true because if you look the the erm weeks and months
S0192	it have no knowledge of itself it have no language it have no experience in the world
S0199	but it hear it hear its parents' voice
S0192	it can feel it can hear but it's not gonna know it's die be it it's not gonna be in pain or anything like that
S0199	oh i don't wanna talk about this anymore
S0192	it's not gonna be in pain be it
S0199	of course it'll be in pain
S0192	the it'll just die i mean
S0199	oh let's not talk about it
S0192	okay but i mean it's like say when you i mean you could argue that cells have you know we're full of cells and full of things i mean you squash bug all the time you don't care about it you eat chickens and eat whatever you don't give a shit about it
S0199	mm yeah yeah yeah yeah but
S0192	it's all very one side because it's human
S0199	mm
S0192	i mean it hasn't even be bear yet just cos it's the shape of a human er i don't feel the same
S0199	no i know you don't
S0192	i mean it's call birth you're bear otherwise we would start our age at when you're conceive otherwise i should be an extra nine months older if i'm really
S0199	do you know i find it quite sad that you don't remember anything from when you're kind of like before three when you think of the majority of parent the time and effort they put into their children and
S0192	it seem a bite of a shame yeah it seem a bite of a shame
S0199	all the
S0192	how much effort when you look around a parents' to see how much effort they put in
S0199	yeah
S0192	and then
S0199	and learn and
S0192	the kid just kind of forget that don't they yeah
S0199	cuddle and you know all the the laughter and
S0192	they don't forget though it it must it contribute to their who they be and it contribute to their
S0199	yeah of course and their security and all of that how they feel but
S0192	and their love and their feel of you know so it definitely do they have a memory they just don't remember specifics
S0199	yeah
S0192	so if you think about that if a baby if you can't remember up to three years how be you conscious at three months
S0199	mm
S0192	what do you consider too late then
S0199	well what be the abortion now
S0192	i don't know
S0199	be it twenty be it twenty four weeks
S0192	i don't know
S0199	or whatever that be i think it should be reduce by a couple of weeks
S0192	mm one of those
S0199	yeah
S0192	call you a religious nut don't they
S0199	why religious
S0192	if you so you'd rather that child grow up in a shitty home and have a shitty life
S0199	no no
S0192	for the whole of its life
S0199	no
S0192	than
S0199	no
S0192	quietly put it out of its misery
S0199	no i just
S0192	cos that's what's gonna happen with all these people that oh crap i don't want this child it's twenty weeks in it kind of look like a baby but if i have this child it's not gonna have a dad i'm gonna be poor for the rest of my life it's i'm gonna resent this child do you think that's better
S0199	well that's why they haven't reduce it then
S0192	or should it go into adoption
S0199	no
S0192	should it just go be bear because what's the alternative here if you're say they shouldn't adopt they shouldn't abort it what happen to these child these children
S0199	i just think nowadays when i know that there be circumstances where people just ignore it and they're too afraid to admit that they're expect or whatever and then when they do it's late and blah di blah i understand all that but also on the other hand there's so many of these pregnancy test things that show right from the very begin that whether they're positive or not
S0192	so be you say then that it's your responsibility to take these test early and
S0199	yeah
S0192	constantly and frequently so if you're in a sexual relationship then what you need to be take this every couple of weeks
S0199	no no but if like you're use condoms and it split
S0192	cos how do you know but what about if it hasn't split but something's happen or it's be defective
S0199	well you wouldn't know would you
S0192	or there be a little hole in it so to back that up then you have to be take it every two weeks you need to take a pregnancy test
S0199	yeah
S0192	cos otherwise how be you gonna know
S0199	mm
S0192	how be you gonna know
S0199	you're not be you
S0192	and i mean be you gonna take every use condom and fill it up with water
S0199	and i mean a month's gonna go by anyway four weeks go
S0192	just to check i mean what be you gonna it perhaps it's not that easy to tell i don't know
S0199	mm
S0192	as far as i know the statistic's pretty high that they're safe
S0199	mm
S0192	it's improper use of them that be bad
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	it's people not change them you know what i mean
S0199	mm
S0192	it's people not like keep it on or something that's
S0199	mm
S0192	so no i don't know
S0199	take risk
S0192	yeah
S0199	mm
S0192	we try and be as safe as possible but i mean i feel safer with her on contraception but i don't like the damage that it may be do to her body cos i don't know if enough research have go into these things and she's be on it for the last four or five years so
S0199	mm
S0192	when we go abroad again i'm sure she'll go back on it or on the pill
S0199	mm mm
S0192	cos she'll feel like she have to but
S0199	mm
S0192	we discuss it and decide that
S0199	what's the long term do the do the doctor kind of say you know if you've be on a while it will take you blah blah blah
S0192	doctor be shit they're terrible what do they know nothing we've put all this weight into doctor and then you go to to them with an actual problem and they have no idea they have no idea
S0199	yeah just general practitioners aren't they
S0192	they just say oh do you i i say to the woman about my joint she ask me oh be i get enough sun i be like what she's like oh a big problem nowadays be people aren't get enough vitamin c because what be her argument because erm that be her argument sorry vitamin d people aren't get children aren't get enough vitamin d these days because parent be slop on too much sun cream that's what she say to me that's bullshit
S0199	what
S0192	if that be the case it's
S0199	what
S0192	it's because children be stay indoors play
S0199	what
S0192	computer game if that's the case that's what she say
S0199	so if they're not get enough vitamin d because of the sun cream
S0192	yeah that's what she say so we're see a lot of children come in nowadays with these kind of things well do i look like a child that's not get enough sun be that your your answer i'm come to you say i have hip pain and knee pain she didn't even touch me
S0199	that be ridiculous
S0192	or have a look at me or anything she just say be you get enough sun i say yes i've be live in a sunny country she say oh i don't know then that's the doctor's opinion
S0199	and that's it so it's not kind of like right well we're we'll take some test and
S0192	and she say your you might need to come in for a scan but i say erm she say you need to come in when it's hurt and i be like well okay well the problem be that it come and go and the problem be that i have to book an appointment in advance so if it's hurt and then i book an appointment and then it come and it's not hurt er what it's just crap i have no faith in them whatsoever none they're most doctor and my friend's a nurse i've get a couple of nurse friends now and it's a well know fact that they're basically sign off for drug company
S0199	mm
S0192	they're there to prescribe the drug that have be sell i don't trust them at all i'm not say that there aren't amaze doctor out there
S0199	yeah
S0192	who be very knowledgeable
S0199	mm
S0192	but i think in general
S0199	mm
S0192	they go through a system where
S0199	you need to go oh yeah they do and they'll they'll push the pills before they do anything else
S0192	yeah oh take this er antidepressant
S0199	mm yeah
S0192	take that
S0199	try this anti inflammatory and then come back to me in four weeks if it's
S0192	and they have no knowledge of nutrition whatsoever you know if she'd have turn around to me and say oh have you look into glucosamine sulphate or be you take cod liver oil tablets have you be eat enough of these oil or this something or other
S0199	look for erm what about like these
S0192	nothing nothing nothing to do with nutritional health
S0199	chinese health doctor or something where they do
S0192	yes
S0199	like natural remedy and things be it worth maybe go and see i don't know if they've get anything like that down in but
S0192	erm
S0199	they've get one in town centre
S0192	i felt my joint have be a bite better since i've come home so i don't know what it be i've have it mildly on my hip
S0199	it would be interest to see
S0192	but i need to tell you honestly i haven't be hit the gym i haven't be lift weight i haven't be run i haven't be do these kind of things so i don't i there's so many variables
S0199	mm
S0192	it's very difficult to tell
S0199	mm mm
S0192	what be cause anything be it the water in korea i it's go away now but i be have terrible dry eyebrows
S0199	yeah last time i saw you
S0192	and dry scalp and like itchy beard be it the water in korea what what be it
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	what's cause these things
S0199	oh
S0192	don't know
S0199	do you need any more shampoo
S0192	erm not at the moment no
S0199	okay
S0192	probably around christmas we will
S0199	okay
S0192	we've get a big tresemme and a big something else at the minute
S0199	cool
S0192	yeah but thank you anyway
S0199	i've get some when you next need it anyway
S0192	your avon lady do you wanna come and stand outside with me or by the door you don't have to i'm just gonna you don't have to mum if you don't want
S0199	i don't mind this be fine
S0192	so i mean what what do you think then if say she be pregnant what should i do just ignore my feel and pretend to be supportive
S0199	no no obviously it would have to be something that you both decide it's gotta be a decision between the two of you hasn't it
S0192	but what if she say i wanna keep it
S0199	oh god if she say i want to keep it then you'd have to either say to her well it's not what i want but i'll support you
S0192	that's the only choice really isn't it
S0199	yeah
S0192	to be the honourable person
S0199	yeah
S0192	and then you end up
S0199	well you couldn't walk away from your child could you
S0192	but you know what would happen though we'd end up divorce
S0199	mm
S0192	and split up and the child would have a crappy upbringing and it would just be crap wouldn't it why should i put a child through that
S0199	well at the end
S0192	just because
S0199	it wouldn't be your final decision though would it
S0192	maybe it would be better to split up if she really want to have the child
S0199	mm mm
S0192	and then she can find somebody that do actually wanna look after a child
S0199	mm i be gonna say that maybe you'd split up like straightaway even though you be still its father and you're supportive
S0192	but then you're put an ultimatum on them aren't you you're say unless you have an abortion i'm leave you and that that look terrible
S0199	yeah i know i know
S0192	to everyone
S0199	well it's not about everyone anyway it's about the two of you
S0192	what about if you say okay well let's have the child but adopt it immediately put it into a love family of course you can't get rid of this baby you believe that you you
S0199	yeah
S0192	you shouldn't end this life
S0199	yeah
S0192	but we can't i don't want it
S0199	yeah
S0192	and if you think about it you don't really want it but the problem be that the hormones that you start produce tell you that you do want it
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	cos it i reckon you would i reckon if it go far enough
S0199	yeah
S0192	you'd wanna have it
S0199	yeah
S0192	but even though for the last ten years you haven't want to have it
S0199	well let's hope you're never put in that position until you want to be
S0192	i hope not a very weighty thing and what do you do just abstain from have sex just you know don't do these things because of the the risk
S0199	no it's a big part of your relationship isn't it
S0192	part it's not the be all and end all but it's it's a part of your relationship
S0199	no of course it isn't but it it unite you and you know in a in a different way to be unite
S0192	well it's a core human need we need to be touch
S0199	exactly
S0192	we need to be sensual we it's just like eat or do like these other things
S0199	yeah exactly
S0192	you need it it's a weighty consequence for such a simple action
S0199	yeah
S0192	it really be but you know what do you do hopefully we never will encounter that scenario but
S0199	not unless you want to
S0192	it scar the crap out of us when we think
S0199	mm
S0192	we might be a whole pregnancy test thing where you're like both like oh my god what the hell
S0199	how the hell would you deal with it yeah
S0192	well because it really make you start practically think about it you know like god we'd have to go back and what live in england and get a job and
S0199	mm
S0192	and that's it be it just just and you're mean to be selfless at that point aren't you and just devote your life to them but i couldn't imagine have a child and and i guess you wouldn't allow yourself to resent it be that what people do they just don't allow themselves you convince yourself that that's
S0199	i just think naturally you wouldn't because you would become accustom to the fact it would take you a while to get your head round it but
S0192	what if you don't like children
S0199	yeah but your child be different to everybody else's children
S0192	everybody say that
S0199	mm
S0192	it's everyone say that it's i don't think it's true i think it's something that not everyone but some people convince themselves
S0199	but you don't you do not dislike children
S0192	mm
S0199	you're good with children
S0192	i'm good with children but it's an act
S0199	really
S0192	i don't yeah i don't
S0199	well it seem very natural
S0192	because i don't have to be around them a long time i work with children i spend quite a considerable time with children i don't really like children they quite massively inhibit on my ability to do the things that i want to do i like be around well i'm i think i be good with children i know how to interact with children and i'm happy to play with them temporarily but
S0199	mm
S0192	they're very very very tire
S0199	but i think that be the same as
S0192	extremely tire and all consume
S0199	anybody that hasn't get their own children because you're live your own life and do your own thing it's nice for a short period of time but then it's kind of like okay fine now let me get on with what i wanna do
S0192	but that seem a bite
S0199	so it's it's just
S0192	bad isn't it that you can only care really truly about your own children you can't care about other people's children
S0199	no it just change you it just change you when you have your own children you then i mean even like even now when 's friends come round and everything you know sometimes it's kind of like god it's weird or i can't get on with him or do you know what i mean it's like your child be the one that you have the time and effort for and and all of that because you've get that
S0192	and you're shape him
S0199	bond yeah from conception to birth and onwards
S0192	but that bond have to build doesn't it what if that ante what be it call antenatal depression or something doesn't go away
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	what if that you have that and it doesn't end and some some women have that don't they
S0199	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	they actually don't love their child for the first few years
S0199	yeah
S0192	and that's fair because you can't just expect to love something immediately because it's yours
S0199	yeah
S0192	you have to spend time do it and have them yet it's different for you you're obviously a very
S0199	i do think when you're expect and you have a baby you think oh my god how the hell be i gonna love it i remember think with how on earth be i go to love him as much as i love you how the hell could i split myself in two like that i remember think that and i remember get upset about it think i haven't get enough love to give to two children but it's amaze how it happen
S0192	do it shock you then that i don't like children
S0199	i'm surprise but not surprise if that make sense i think it's just where you're at in your life i don't think it's specifically that you don't like children i think it's just that you be live your live without children in it so why would you need to
S0192	the problem for me be
S0199	it's very rare for a man to have that overpower feel to want baby and be around children and all of that it's more the woman that would have that feel and then it grow with a man
S0192	i just feel like when you have a child you end up spend most of your time around children and i really enjoy
S0199	adult company
S0192	intelligent conversation not
S0199	mm mm
S0192	the conversation with children
S0199	mm
S0192	i find it quite tedious i i can do it for a while and i you know
S0199	mm mm
S0192	i think i be good at it
S0199	mm
S0192	but it's a bite of an act it's not you know
S0199	well all parent like to get back to be adults though
S0192	i find them tire
S0199	mm
S0192	like they're really tire
S0199	oh god yeah
S0192	and that's just to be around a child for a couple of hours i can't imagine do what you're do and i can't i can't and obviously therefore i know deep down that i'm not a good parent if i think that then i can't be a good parent that's not what a parent should be so
S0199	no but
S0192	if i be to have a child now it would be ridiculous
S0199	be a parent be like it's not something that you know
S0192	be you cold
S0199	it's something that you learn
S0192	no of course but there's quite a large percentage really be that innate
S0199	i mean obviously i work with children before have them so i have get that love of children anyway hadn't i
S0192	and i grow up with
S0199	i always want children
S0192	all sort of other people's children around me
S0199	yeah you do and maybe that's put you off who know have to have other people's children all the time
S0192	maybe
S0199	but then you also have playmates you also have people to play with children
S0192	yeah but i think
S0199	but maybe you didn't wanna share it
S0192	no i mean i didn't i didn't i never that i remember i never grow up think god i don't want these people around
S0199	mm
S0192	i don't remember have a problem with share
S0192	it be just
S0192	or have a problem with
S0199	no
S0192	have children around or any of that kind of stuff just i dunno i'm older i just
S0199	yeah but be the same she's kind of like she love her nieces and nephew but she say i hate children
S0199	you know she's kind of like be there something wrong with me be i weird
S0192	mm
S0199	i don't want children you know she's very kind of like that she say i i admit it she say they annoy me and they irritate me and and i just say to her don't beat yourself up about it you're just not in that er time in your life
S0192	it's a bite strange maybe because of the life that you pursue but if you look statistically the amount of people if you take the amount of people that don't have a degree that have children there's a much much higher percentage of the people that have that don't have a degree and then when you have a ba the percentage of people that have a ba that have children drop quite considerably
S0199	mm
S0192	when you have a an ma it drop again
S0199	mm mm
S0192	and then when you have a a phd it drop massively again
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	the percentage of people that have a phd and have children be very low compare to the people that don't
S0199	yeah yeah i can believe that
S0192	it seem that if you pursue education you don't tend to do it
S0199	well you've go the edge er you've go the academic route as oppose to the family family route haven't you
S0192	but maybe it's as you become because you've postpone it a bite you start to develop these ideas of what a child should have a what a child a kind of environment that a child should be bring up in and then you start to look at yourself and think i can't provide that
S0199	mm
S0192	i can't do that and therefore how can i do that i guess a big part of why i don't want children be because if i be to have a children i'd wanna give it everything and i want it to have the perfect everything if it make sense
S0199	what be the perfect everything
S0192	well i mean there be no perfect of course there isn't but
S0199	and what be give them everything
S0192	well i think a parent should be erm i think a parent should be educate enough to be able to teach their child important things simple things i think a parent should know how to cook quite well and i think a parent should know how to manage money very well and in and be social and and er numerous attribute like er load of things that i mean most people kind of develop as they go on through the have children maybe they didn't have it quite right on their first child but they're better on their second child that kind of thing
S0199	mm mm
S0192	i guess i see those attribute and think oh i should have x amount of money in the bank before i have a child
S0199	mm
S0192	and i think i should be able to provide it for these things and if it want to go on a school trip i can afford for it to go on a school trip
S0199	mm okay
S0192	and these kind of things do you know what i mean
S0199	mm
S0192	there's a whole a whole plethora of attribute that i feel be necessary before you have a child i mean i'm of such a a liberal mindset that i actually personally would change the whole structure
S0199	i know you would yeah you've tell me before
S0192	i don't think that children should spend most of their time with other children which be basically how most children be nowadays in society they spend the majority of their time learn from other children but what can other children teach them apart from how to interact with other children they should be spend most of their time with adults and then they should also be spend most of their time not just with a couple of adults but with a wide variety of adults that be able to teach them
S0199	but isn't that what a family be aunts and uncles and
S0192	yeah you need a good family network so then again i look at my own life and think well you know i don't have a good family network i don't have
S0199	well you
S0192	a lot of people around i mean er the only way it would work be what if i come and live down the road from you
S0199	mm
S0192	because then you'd be there and you'd be able to help out so if i don't have that network around me
S0199	mm
S0192	and i don't have these other adults i mean it probably sound crazy but i personally think we should we should all be euthanised euthanised sorry we should all be sterilise and you should apply to have children and you should meet x amount of criteria before you have a child and then that child probably should effectively i mean i don't see why we don't have systems for have children if you need to apply for a drive licence and you need to apply it's a massive criteria to adopt it take years to be able to adopt but yet you can just pump out a child no worry with no nobody evaluate you in any sense whatsoever that to me be be ridiculous absolutely ridiculous and the only reason it exist be because it's that easy to have a child so
S0199	but also it's freedom isn't it otherwise you're go back to china and er place like that where they you er er have they have rule that you can only have isn't it isn't it that you can only have
S0192	i mean that wasn't as it be a rule but the only rule that really exist the only way that they enforce that rule be that they say if you have more than one child
S0199	mm
S0192	you have to pay for everything for that child
S0199	oh right okay
S0192	that be how they do it
S0199	yeah
S0192	they didn't say you can't have a child they just say you can only have one child that the state will pay for
S0199	mm
S0192	if you want another child
S0199	which be fair enough really
S0192	you need to be yeah i mean i don't have i don't see a problem with that
S0199	mm
S0192	the problem be that you then get mm all sort of negative effect where they're leave dead baby in the side of streets
S0199	oh my god
S0192	and all this kind of stuff and in because of chinese society the male carry on the family name they don't want females and all this kind of stuff so it's like
S0199	oh god yeah
S0192	so it you need a whole social construct reform for that a system like that to work but i'm not against that i think that's how it should be and quite often and i'm not talk about you or or people in our family but there be a hell of a lot of people that be have children that probably shouldn't be
S0199	mm
S0192	and there be a hell of a lot of people that probably should be have children that aren't
S0199	mm
S0192	so i don't see why we just what i my perfect system would be
S0199	i'm cold
S0192	you don't you don't have a child if i'm talk sci fi like you know what i mean
S0199	mm
S0192	like in a in the future nobody have children children be create and they're create without defect genes without all this kind of stuff
S0199	yeah yeah be talk about this the other
S0192	you know what i mean you make a child
S0199	yeah
S0192	so none of these genetic defect be pass on and then they be place into the care of people temporarily
S0199	mm
S0192	you know and i maybe could consider the prospect of have a child a lot more if it be for five years or something if we be okay we're gonna have a child for five years and then we'll teach everything we can to that child for five years and look after it and we'll have a bond with it and then it'll move on to someone else now we don't forget the child we still have some role to play within the child's life but it it's not live with us you know what i mean er and then you can also control how many children we're have and like the population doesn't need to keep grow and keep get bigger
S0199	mm
S0192	and when we don't have a we have a finite amount of resources and and the whole system to me and if i think this how can i have a child
S0199	mm
S0192	i've say to you before i don't agree with education er how it be how can i give my child up to the state
S0199	mm
S0192	in four years in and then just say alright it's up to you to educate my child even though i'm a teacher and i'm educate and i'm qualify to impart my wisdom on my children
S0199	well you have another option there don't you you you teach them yourself you take them out of school and you teach them yourself
S0192	no no cos how be you gonna afford that what be i gonna be rich
S0199	mm
S0192	er you need to be rich to do that
S0199	mm
S0192	so i don't have that option i'd love to have that option yeah brilliant and i stop work and we raise a child maybe we could do that but you need a hell of a lot of money in the bank to be able to do something like that
S0199	mm
S0192	so that option doesn't actually exist it's not a real option it's only a real option for people that have a lot of money
S0199	mm
S0192	so all of these all of these attribute and all of the ways i think just make me think i shouldn't have a child i shouldn't do it cos it's just
S0199	well you're a lot erm what's the word i don't think not bravery you're a lot more level head than a lot of people
S0192	probably just analyse it too much
S0199	people don't think too deeply into it when maybe they should sometimes
S0192	there's definitely a part of me definitely that i think i could be a good father provide
S0199	you'd be a great father
S0192	x x and x be meet
S0199	mm
S0192	and society be change in this way so that you know what i mean but it's not it doesn't exist now
S0199	but you might find a country that you do you know you think okay well i can i can bend a bite on that but i quite like the way they do this and the way they do that you might think you know it's not quite as
S0192	i haven't hear of one yet
S0199	i want it to be but mm well you may never have children
S0192	haven't hear of one yet and and again the problem be if you never have children you're miss out on such an amaze wonderful experience that everyone go on about all the time and also you're exclude
S0199	do you feel like that a little bite do you feel like er you know what be we miss out on if we don't have children
S0192	oh definitely and you've always get this thing as well that every person that's have a child be gonna look down on you and go you just don't know cos you haven't have a child and that i find frustrate
S0199	why would that bother you
S0192	it bother me because it's like say i can't possibly have any idea of what it's like to drive a car just cos i've never drive one but i've be in cars all the time and i've be around people that drive cars i've speak to people that drive cars i've watch people drive cars and there's a fairly simple mechanic to drive a car
S0199	but then you could turn round and say but you don't know what it's like to travel all these beautiful countries
S0192	no
S0199	you don't know what it's like to do a master or a phd or
S0192	but i wouldn't say it to that degree i mean if you know people that have do it and you've speak to people that have do it you do have some inclination and you do have some idea you know you've watch travel program you've speak to people that have do these things i wouldn't turn around to say to someone you have no idea i would say your idea be your perception be skew it's not and i'm sure people would say the same to me but i've not find people that have children to be like that
S0199	mm it's kind of like wait till you have your own then you'll understand
S0192	i find them to be fairly black and white like wait until you have your own children and then you'll know
S0199	mm
S0192	as if there's some magical boundary that you're gonna cross and then suddenly it all become clear when you have a child i find that quite patronise to tell
S0199	it would it would be quite interest if you do to then have a conversation again just to see if you
S0192	and i'm sure i'd make all the same mistake that everyone else do
S0199	no but just to see if you actually say you know what i get it now kind of thing or
S0192	you think i would then by by that er question
S0199	no no not necessarily i just it would be interest to see because of how you feel as to what your feel would be whether you would turn around and say well i feel exactly like i tell you i would
S0192	mm
S0199	kind of thing or or not
S0192	well most people consider it to be selfish not to have children
S0199	it's selfish to have children sometimes
S0192	and i that's what i think i think it's actually more the opposite than than that one
S0199	i've have
S0192	i've put in
S0199	i've have all three of you because i'm totally selfish
S0192	i just think that quite a few people that get into their thirties and don't have children have probably put a hell of a lot more think into not have children
S0199	mm
S0192	than the people that have children
S0199	and a lot of people be become more career mind and and haven't get the time in their life to have a child
S0192	yeah there's definitely a lack of years isn't there in life that's er
S0199	i think people be different i think i think couple or youngsters or older people that don't have children be different to the people that do
S0192	mm
S0199	in the way they see life and other people and expectations maybe obviously when it's just yourself you don't have anyone else to really think about okay you might you know you think about your family and you care about them blah di blah but you haven't get to support them and solely be the ones that look after them so your life be about what you wanna do and when you wanna do it kind of thing but that's a choice that we make isn't it
S0192	but i mean as a teacher i have the potential to impact a variety of children or a variety of people
S0199	mm
S0192	not just my one child
S0199	but you can go home at the end of the night
S0192	i mean i'd have to i work my job be work with people
S0199	mm
S0192	all the time you know what i mean
S0199	mm
S0192	and i'm not talk just on the phone or something it's very very close contact with
S0199	mm
S0192	with people numerous people a lot of people all the time but it's it be hard for people that don't wanna have children because they always have pressure from their family and even from their friends you er you i know you want me to have children and dad's make it very clear that he want me to have children and it's
S0199	i haven't put any pressure you on you to have children
S0192	i wouldn't say you put pressure on me but i know
S0199	all i've say to you be i just don't think you're in that right
S0192	i know deep down that you want me to have children
S0199	god and i'd love to have er
S0192	exactly
S0199	hold your son
S0192	exactly
S0199	or daughter in my arm
S0192	that's pressure
S0199	of course i would
S0192	that's pressure you say that you don't but you've just say that you totally would want that to happen so that's pressure that's
S0199	but
S0192	i'm not say that's a bad thing
S0199	yeah
S0192	but it's just something that well i mean i people that don't have children could say to people that do have children you don't know what it's like to live with
S0199	yeah
S0192	decide not to have children
S0199	yeah
S0192	it's a very very big decision to make
S0199	yeah do you think the pressure be more on
S0192	and we have to live with it for a whole
S0199	that you should have a child
S0192	what than not have one
S0199	when you're together as a couple
S0192	oh massively so and especially now i've propose to anyone we meet that know that we're engage or marry or whatever
S0199	yeah
S0192	be totally like when be you have children
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	when's this happen
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	when's that bite come
S0199	yeah
S0192	and it's like well you know what i mean and live abroad it's even harder because that be a very strict system
S0199	mm
S0192	you know what i mean
S0199	mm
S0192	in korea you have a you get marry you have a child
S0199	mm
S0192	they can't understand why you don't have children
S0199	mm
S0192	so pretty much every single korean you meet and get to know a little bite be gonna be ask you where be your children and why haven't you have children yet it's not that easy to turn them down every time and say well you know you just make a joke of it
S0199	you've just you've just gotta find a line haven't you just
S0192	in korea like it's expensive
S0199	yeah
S0192	we haven't save up enough yet you make a joke out of it but
S0199	yeah or you just say time's not right
S0192	yeah but it's it's tough i don't
S0199	mm
S0192	i don't know if people that have children think enough about what
S0199	i would imagine it's tougher for do you think
S0192	erm mm perhaps yeah i would probably say that she's a
S0199	i would imagine there's be a lot of her friends since she's come home say oh when be you gonna have a baby then now kind of thing
S0192	none of her friends have children though
S0199	oh really
S0192	no no
S0199	oh maybe that take the pressure off of her
S0192	erm the only people that have children now of either side of our friends quite interestingly strangely actually cos when i speak about bas and have a degree none of her school friends close friends have children none of my close school friends have children we both have mutual friends from university there be two that have have children
S0199	mm
S0192	have just have one and 's have one but i mean doesn't have kid doesn't have kid doesn't have kid
S0199	yeah
S0192	doesn't have kid doesn't have kid on her side doesn't have kid doesn't have kid doesn't have kid doesn't have kid
S0199	mm
S0192	it's only our uni group
S0199	mm
S0192	and two of them have so i don't know if just if you're that type of person that you end up start to side with people that don't want to have children and
S0199	mm
S0192	they they're the type of friends because let's face it it's gonna be tough to keep in contact with people that do want kid and have kid because
S0199	mm
S0192	our live don't correspond so therefore
S0199	mm mm
S0192	you're not gonna have those people as friends really so
S0199	mm
S0192	it's erm
S0199	mm
S0192	it's a complicate situation
S0199	who know
S0192	and then you get poor well not poor people but you get people like who desperately want to have children
S0199	i know
S0192	and couldn't have them
S0199	i know
S0192	they're the real ones that people should be focus on you know what i mean
S0199	i know especially when you've have er a tough time as well
S0192	yeah
S0199	in life you just think
S0192	they're the ones that
S0199	why can't she have a family that she want
S0192	yeah
S0199	so desperately
S0192	they're the ones that should have children
S0199	yeah
S0192	it's sad
S0199	yeah it be
S0192	mm
S0199	and she's a lovely lady
S0192	as i say because we have this plan i can't where where do you fit children into that plan
S0199	mm
S0192	and that plan be much more important to me than the other i mean if i have a child i could make a strong impact on one person if i follow academia i could have a strong impact on thousands of people
S0199	mm
S0192	i could write come up with some revolutionary theory that have an impact on lot of people forever or
S0199	who's to say though
S0192	i could have one child and
S0199	that you and er you know will have your ten year plan and get where you wanna go and then decide okay the time's right now
S0192	we may do we may do
S0199	who's to say
S0192	it might may happen that's one thing that so obviously a part of and i a part of us do wanna have children because we haven't we haven't count it out
S0199	mm
S0192	all we know be we definitely don't want them now
S0199	you're not ready at the moment yeah
S0192	we definitely don't want them now definitely not
S0199	well i would stop put pressure on yourselves and that's all you've gotta say you're not ready at the moment to anybody
S0192	oh we don't put pressure on ourselves it's other people put pressure on us
S0199	yeah but if you get ask
S0192	so
S0199	the question just say oh not for quite a few years yet
S0192	oh i know i know how to deal with it it's not a problem i don't care what other people think
S0199	yeah
S0192	i don't give a shit so just laugh it off it's just tire if people keep ask i can pretty much guarantee
S0199	yeah
S0192	what somebody'll say
S0199	it's the it's just human nature you get together you've be with someone for a while oh when you get engage when you get engage
S0192	then you have kid
S0199	have you get a house what you do
S0192	er but it's just
S0199	it's just human nature
S0192	as if there's one path
S0199	yeah
S0192	there's one way of live so
S0199	i know
S0192	i feel so privilege to live in a time where i can do the things that i'm do that even fifty years prior you couldn't do
S0199	yeah
S0192	fifty years ago not many people go to university not many people er could travel the world or do travel the world
S0199	i know it's amaze
S0192	couldn't do those things i feel a fool to turn down those things that be the dawn of this age that
S0199	yeah
S0192	i really i really really struggle to connect with people that don't see why we travel i really
S0199	mm
S0192	struggle with that
S0199	mm mm
S0192	because i'm so fascinate by experience and life
S0199	mm
S0192	that why wouldn't you wanna see the world
S0199	exactly
S0192	why wouldn't you wanna see every corner of this planet
S0199	mm mm
S0192	i'm actually wish i be bear in an area era where we could travel space and i could go to different planets
S0199	mm
S0192	and this kind of stuff that's why i i fulfil that through that through read science fiction and that kind of stuff because really this world isn't enough for me this be
S0199	mm
S0192	i want more than this but it doesn't exist
S0199	it's lovely though
S0192	it be it's difficult though
S0199	it's lovely that you've get that hunger for it all
S0192	mm it's difficult though because not many people think like that so it's really hard to be
S0199	yeah
S0192	to not feel much of a connection with a lot of people because they don't think like you do you wanna find the people that think like you do
S0199	but do you need to find any more people
S0192	you wanna feel community
S0199	you know you
S0192	oh you need community everyone need community
S0199	but you've get that already in your group of friends that you've already get won't there come a time when you don't
S0192	yeah but they're disparate they live in different part of the world
S0199	yeah
S0192	i don't spend you know
S0199	yeah
S0192	a lot of time with them one of the hardest things i come to grip with be and be this no slight on yourself because this be a common of most people most most people be we all know that we learn from other people and we love most people love humans right we love meet people we love you know some of the greatest things in life be some of the people that you've meet and that have impart knowledge to you yet i look around at people and think how many people have you actually meet in the last and i say i'm you do fall into this category and i'm not say that to be bad
S0199	mm
S0192	cos ninety five to a hundred percent of people
S0199	mm
S0192	be like that but i look back and think of all the people i've meet in the last ten years
S0199	mm
S0192	and i mean i've just meet a whole bunch of new people just start this master course
S0199	mm mm
S0192	i you know i'm i now know friends in various part of the world people that
S0199	mm
S0192	and i just look at other people that be just
S0199	they go to work come home they see their friends
S0192	i feel bad cos i feel like i'm i'm try to tag you in but that's not what i'm say but i mean you look at most adults that have children everyone i know probably have like three close friends and then that's it
S0199	mm
S0192	and you and you get older and you're like where be my friends go where do this happen where all these people
S0199	mm mm
S0192	because you don't have time you don't have time to meet people
S0199	mm mm mm
S0192	i'm not blame people for that but that's just the way it be
S0199	mm mm
S0192	and i just really struggle with that cos i meet some really great people
S0199	mm
S0192	and really inspire people and just think i wanna
S0199	how lucky be you
S0192	keep meet people
S0199	mm
S0192	that's why i've struggle with be in a monogamous relationship because again it's learn
S0199	mm
S0192	i think how much i learn from be with this person well surely
S0199	mm
S0192	if i be with somebody else i'd learn a hell of a lot more again
S0199	mm mm
S0192	that's have to be a sacrifice er for me
S0199	mm
S0192	i've have to say okay well i'm i you know chance be i'm not gonna find what i've find with with someone else
S0199	mm mm
S0192	it's not gonna happen so yeah a part of me and i struggle and i fight with that for a while say well i could be with someone else and i could learn a hell of a lot more with them
S0199	mm
S0192	personally i think that i think you could probably change partner every ten years
S0199	mm
S0192	and have an amaze time with that person
S0199	mm
S0192	for ten years and then move on and have an amaze time with another person for ten years
S0199	mm
S0192	if only life be structure more like that where end the last relationship isn't the be all and end all
S0199	mm
S0192	if only we could move on
S0199	mm
S0192	and still be close with the other person
S0199	mm mm
S0192	but that doesn't happen
S0199	no no
S0192	so i've have to make that that's a sacrifice that be worth make so
S0199	mm
S0192	i've do that but
S0199	mm
S0192	definitely a part of my way of think be say you know and i've fight with that for a while be no you you know somebody else will teach you a hell of a lot more and open up a whole world of experience to you so
S0199	mm mm
S0192	i struggle and that's why i don't disagree with divorce and all this kind of things i totally understand it and i haven't and i like no no
S0199	mm
S0192	misconception it's just have children massively complicate the situation so
S0199	mm mm than the actual marriage bite
S0192	yeah but i mean
S0199	mm
S0192	if you remove the children divorce it doesn't really mean anything do it
S0199	no no hence my first it be nothing and it be
S0192	yeah it only hurt you and the other person
S0199	mm
S0192	that's it
S0199	mm
S0192	maybe your parent be like well i really like that
S0199	so it's
S0192	that guy or that girl
S0199	mm
S0192	it's er kind of a shame that fell through but it's quite a loose relationship really
S0199	mm it be the children
S0192	once you put children in there
S0199	yeah
S0192	it's a completely different scenario
S0199	yeah
S0192	completely different
S0199	yeah totally
S0192	because of the construct that we live in that
S0199	mm
S0192	it do affect them negatively when you move
S0199	mm
S0192	between partner so yeah i struggle with that and i look back at some people and just think it's not the people that i guess it's not the people that be happy with who it's the people that aren't happy
S0199	mm
S0192	that i struggle with
S0199	because if they're happy with their live and what they're do
S0192	that's fine
S0199	then that's what they want
S0192	yeah that's fine
S0199	yeah
S0192	no people can be happy for different reason
S0199	it's the people that aren't happy but do nothing about it
S0192	yeah yeah they're they're the ones that get to me the people that be like
S0199	mm
S0192	oh i'd love to do what you're do
S0199	mm
S0192	and don't
S0199	see i be a bite like with you know travel that's great and you know go out to spain and all of that that's great he take himself out of his comfort zone and he's meet lot of other people blah blah blah and he's go to uni now but i still don't think he will be like yourself
S0192	no no he's
S0199	he like his own space
S0192	he's a different person
S0199	he like his own his own company to a certain extent and i think he'd be quite happy with a small group of friends
S0192	mm
S0199	not
S0192	i mean as be i i'm not
S0199	mm
S0192	er although yeah i'm say i know a lot of people i not in one go
S0199	mm
S0192	i only really need three to five close friends at any one time
S0199	mm mm
S0192	and then another ten good acquaintances or good most but no be different
S0199	mm
S0192	he's completely different but
S0199	mm
S0192	and each to their own
S0199	but i'm glad
S0192	each to their own right
S0199	yeah but i be so glad that he's you know go and do what he's do and you've help him do that and then come out to korea as well you've encourage him to do that with that time and so although he and who know he might start travel in the holiday and things i don't know what his plan be or what his thoughts be but
S0192	can you imagine though can you imagine if that first husband who you get with what job be you do when you be with him
S0199	erm god i can't even think it doesn't even feel like me what be i do be i work in er jesus i can't remember
S0192	whatever it be imagine that that's what you're
S0199	i be work in the children's home
S0192	okay
S0199	yeah
S0192	imagine that now as old as you be you're still with that guy
S0199	oh
S0192	and you're still do that job
S0199	god no
S0192	that that amount of time have part
S0199	well it make me freak
S0192	i personally think people should change job every five to ten years regardless
S0199	mm
S0192	just because you meet a whole bunch of people you learn a lot of things about yourself you learn more skills in the job
S0199	totally yeah
S0192	i have complete respect for the different job that you've go through and the different kind of things and i completely understand when you get your job in the the borough it be a big move for you you know what i mean
S0199	mm
S0192	you hadn't work in that kind of environment before
S0199	mm
S0192	i respect that with people it's the people that get marry very young get the same job and that's it for the rest of their life
S0199	mm mm
S0192	it's a waste i just think it's a big waste of life
S0199	but they're happy
S0192	and it's like be they i mean and if they be okay
S0199	yeah
S0192	but i mean you must be kind of of quite low iq then because it doesn't take much to make you happy so
S0199	no i know yeah
S0192	i mean that's fine if that's what you be but
S0199	but be it that or be just that they know no different
S0192	i'm never gonna yeah exactly
S0199	and if they actually open their eye
S0192	it may just be
S0199	have a different adventure
S0192	happiness through security and comfort
S0199	or yeah
S0192	and not put themselves in in dangerous
S0199	yeah
S0192	you shouldn't
S0199	and different people do show you different things
S0192	shouldn't
S0199	and different side of yourselves and different
S0192	shouldn't yeah
S0199	adventure and stuff like that
S0192	you shouldn't be happy your whole life this idea if you live in ignorant bliss your whole life something's kind of wrong
S0199	mm
S0192	just as much as happiness be experience sadness be an experience
S0199	mm
S0192	i wouldn't get rid of any of the negative things that i've have in my life they've shape me
S0199	mm mm
S0192	they've it's an experience it's part of live like emotions be important and these kind of things
S0199	mm
S0192	you don't in fact it take to be sad to realise how happy you be when you're happy so i just
S0199	mm
S0192	it's just me i just that's why i'm say why i find it difficult to connect with people like that cos i just think we be very very different
S0199	mm
S0192	and i just i beyond pleasantries i don't have much to say to you i can't really talk to you so
S0199	mm
S0192	they're the people i struggle with and
S0199	well that's understandable isn't it
S0192	there be quite a few of them around
S0199	mm
S0192	so
S0199	there sure be
S0192	but that's i think it's fine you can do what you want it just seem such a shame when there's i mean it's the old
S0199	and there's so many countries and place
S0192	it's the old analogy it's like
S0199	mm
S0192	somebody tell you this be a really good book so you buy it and then you read the the front or you open you read the first page and you're like oh this be such a good book i love this book
S0199	mm mm
S0192	and i just spend the whole rest of my life read that same page over and over and over because i love that page
S0199	mm
S0192	but i don't actually know what's on the i haven't turn over the page and go
S0199	mm
S0192	this page be really good too
S0199	mm
S0192	and then about halfway through the book
S0199	it be i think a lot of it be security with people
S0192	oh yeah definitely
S0199	and and like
S0192	fear
S0199	yeah
S0192	it's fear
S0199	yeah
S0192	but that's the way society be shape we're shape to be if we
S0199	and to take yourself out of that comfort zone take something to happen i think sometimes with people
S0192	mm i mean i could say all this and i could end up on my own very sad in the future i have no idea i have no idea what the future hold no idea but i'm just i guess i'm just explain why i struggle
S0199	mm
S0192	to connect with a hell of a lot of people which be why i say i'm look always on the lookout for a community of people that be like mind because everyone need
S0199	yeah
S0192	a community of people that be like them and i i i'm slowly build a community of people like that the problem be that in the stuff that i do those people will probably often quite live far away from
S0199	mm
S0192	quite live quite far away from where i be now if i never have children i can always visit them if i have kid they're not gonna be a part of my child's life really
S0199	mm
S0192	i mean they might see them every so often but that community that i'm build be not a very good community for have a child in
S0199	mm
S0192	if they're the people that i want my child to be around how be i gonna get them all together to do that they're gonna be surround i'm gonna go to school with those people and be look at all the rest of the parent and think i don't like you
S0199	mm
S0192	i don't get on with you so do you know what i mean
S0199	yeah
S0192	that's what i worry about where be i gonna find this amaze school that's gonna be full of parent that be these kind of people cos you have to spend time with these parent you have to deal with these people
S0199	mm you don't really
S0192	i mean you must chat to them briefly when you stand outside school and wait for your thing
S0199	i don't though do i i don't i don't
S0192	i mean you should do you should do
S0199	i don't see them at the school
S0192	they're the parent of the children that be er you know
S0199	yeah the only time
S0192	you should have community with these people
S0199	the only time i do be when i'm wait to pick him up for sport club and things
S0192	mm
S0199	and i have more time with parent before when i have you and but
S0192	yeah i mean of course you're so busy i don't and again i have a lot of respect for that
S0199	yeah well it's not the right way be it to kind of like
S0192	there's no right way
S0199	no
S0192	there's no right way
S0199	just not ideal to work full time and have a child but
S0192	no but that's what everyone do you can't
S0199	mm
S0192	can't not
S0199	well i certainly i wouldn't have be happy be at home all the time
S0192	no
S0199	not now not after find a life outside of home if you know what i mean and something i'm good at and something that i feel like i have achieve
S0192	but imagine that system that i propose where you look after a child for a few years
S0199	mm
S0192	what if let's not talk about because obviously you have a very close
S0199	mm
S0192	relationship with that you can't possibly look outside it
S0199	mm
S0192	let's talk about somebody else you look after a child from the age of zero to five and during that time you get massively subsidise for work you don't have to work many hours you could do your work at home
S0199	but that's like er like foster isn't it
S0192	yeah so you have that child for a few years and then you go back into full time work and you still have access to that child
S0199	mm
S0192	you can still go and visit them you can still spend time with them at the weekend and in the even if you want to but now somebody else be completely off work look after that child also
S0199	mm mm
S0192	and they have and they end up grow up and actually have access to numerous families that they can live with
S0199	mm mm
S0192	and numerous and if they decide yeah i wanna go and live with uncle tom for a while he's really interest he's you know he's study such and such and i'm interest in that and you you have access to these families
S0199	mm mm
S0192	and you can go and live cos it's fair you know we do have family but you can't just go up and go and live with uncle or go and live with somebody else
S0199	mm
S0192	you can't do that
S0199	mm mm
S0192	they don't have room in their life for you so
S0199	mm
S0192	it's a it's a very cursory you know
S0199	mm
S0192	a partial relationship that you have with them really
S0199	mm
S0192	the closest you can get be grandparents because they don't have to work so
S0199	mm
S0192	you can kind of have your grandparents around quite a bite so
S0199	mm
S0192	it's the whole system's just not conducive to have a healthy lifestyle for children i don't think which be why i just
S0199	mm
S0192	i'm not the right person to have a child
S0192	i think about it too much it's sad to a certain degree
S0199	be you hungry
S0192	i'll have some yoghurt probably
S0199	i'm feel a little bite hungry
S0192	oh be your stomach back
S0199	it's okay again now at the moment
S0192	yeah
S0199	yeah probably till i eat something and then it'll all start i don't think i can drink any more wine now
S0192	do you just think i'm weird the stuff i talk about
S0199	no why would i think
S0192	i often think that dad think i'm strange
S0199	what just because you have different view and opinions
S0192	mm
S0199	really do he say to you you're weird then
S0192	no i think in some areas he respect and think you know i obviously know what i'm talk about here and then in other areas i just think he think i just i don't know what i'm talk about i just
S0199	mm
S0192	what be i talk about i'm clearly wrong on this you know what i mean
S0199	yeah but your dad's get strong opinions himself hasn't he so
S0192	mm
S0199	that's probably where he would kind of like stand up and whereas i think i'm more kind of open to just listen and hear what you're say and understand you're come from a different perspective
