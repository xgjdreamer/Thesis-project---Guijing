S0655	money
S0653	you don't get money in a
S0655	money dollars dollars dollars be what i need
S0653	maltesers and mar bar and all that kind of thing but mainly marshmallows at the alice in wonderland party they have lot of table strew with marshmallows and liquorice allsorts and things
S0655	i hate liquorice allsorts
S0653	mm but they look pretty good
S0654	may i see them
S0653	i don't think i take a very good photograph but i'm sure there will be ones that the professional people take
S0655	must have be a rich party
S0653	well no we all pay to get in so about well i get mine age ago but about thirty pound
S0655	thirty pound
S0653	three o thirty pound
S0655	yes
S0653	and on the door it's thirty five pound so there be probably two hundred people there so what's that i've no idea
S0654	it's call a
S0653	i wonder what two hundred time thirty five be
S0654	be that er erm
S0653	or that's two hundred time thirty
S0654	two what's two hundred two zero zero
S0653	mm
S0653	sorry
S0655	it's six hundred
S0653	hang on a minute no it isn't
S0655	yeah it be
S0653	what be thirty time ten
S0655	three hundred
S0653	so then you add so if it be thirty time a hundred you would add another nought so that's three thousand
S0655	three thousand
S0653	so no no but it's actually time two hundred so it would be six thousand pound
S0654	wow
S0655	wow
S0653	but they've obviously pay for the venue which i know be very expensive cos the right so they go in the union society which i know cost two thousand well fifteen hundred pound blah blah blah blah blah two thousand pound for the venue and then all the entertainers and the performers include who teachers you sometimes all the act and all the
S0653	the bar staff
S0655	the bar staff
S0653	people look after a bar
S0655	oh i think you mean as in a electrical bar
S0653	what's an electrical bar
S0655	i have no idea i just
S0653	well then you didn't think that do you
S0655	well i do
S0653	so they would have obviously make profit that's very important
S0655	could have
S0653	to not to spend the same much amount of money that you get in cos that's a bad way of do business
S0655	yeah they probably charge like be that why they charge thirty five instead of plain old thirty
