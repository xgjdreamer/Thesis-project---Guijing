S0327	i'm surprise and shock
S0445	what well why didn't you then
S0327	why didn't you
S0326	oh cos i just get i get like erm i didn't have any good er paper to do question
S0445	oh
S0327	oh right
S0445	yeah yeah
S0326	nothing i actually really prepare come up
S0327	oh that's really annoy
S0445	right
S0327	isn't it
S0445	that be annoy
S0327	you have that in one or two didn't you
S0445	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0327	i mean i suppose that's a major
S0326	it be like i mean one of them be cos you'll get er you're mean to have a sort of choice of question so you have you can do something you're good at and then like
S0327	oh yeah
S0326	in the other paper they have four question and they all have the word moral in the title
S0445	oh that happen to me where they be all so similar yes but but can people not complain about the paper
S0326	no i mean it's i can't be bother it's not i'm sure
S0445	well you still do well
S0326	yeah
S0327	but i expect you have a view on what moral mean
S0326	yeah i know but it be
S0445	mm
S0326	i be convince it be gonna be about something else
S0445	oh right yeah yeah yeah
S0326	cos i think they be mean to reflect what they focus on in lecture which be sort of women and stuff cos there's two women lecturers
S0445	yeah but if they do that or they like
S0326	or they don't
S0445	it really do piss you about that that's happen to like every one of my paper like either all the question you know come up or none of the question
S0326	yeah
S0327	but so you've actually have the result
S0326	yeah
S0327	already and what be they
S0326	i get sixty nine overall
S0327	overall
S0326	yeah
S0327	you'll have to work harder to get your first
S0326	well it's only one more point
S0327	i know but it's significant isn't it
S0445	why
S0326	yeah
S0445	to work hard to get a first
S0327	because you tell me you're not aim for a first
S0445	no i'm not aim for a first mm
S0327	you all work hard and you
S0326	but also i mean i have
S0445	yeah right
S0326	i have one paper that be like fifty seven so that
S0445	oh
S0326	to i mean and i have other stuff that be like i have an eighty
S0327	right
S0445	oh that's good
S0327	i'll tell you what it's nice to know that have high standards we know
S0445	yeah it's cool
S0327	you know you you you can't get a higher grade if you're anywhere but erm
S0445	wait
S0327	what
S0445	be you call an idiot
S0327	no i mean you can't get a grade you know a good grade
S0445	mm
S0327	he's get a good grade
S0445	yeah
S0326	yeah
S0445	a very good oh yeah
S0326	i mean i think only about eight eight people normally get a first not
S0327	yes er i mean it's
S0445	well they have to have it like that don't they
S0327	not in my view that it make any difference to one's life
S0326	yeah more people get it in the third year than the second year
S0327	do they
S0445	oh right
S0326	second year's
S0327	what they're do you see what they're do with you i can tell you that for so give you sixty nine be say watch it
S0326	they they're not do that
S0327	you know erm you think you're clever but we would like you to really pull the stop out so
S0326	i don't know it's actually cos of the second year you you have less choice of what you can do so you have to do stuff
S0445	oh yeah
S0326	yeah i think so
S0327	do you and
S0326	and it's so broad that you have to do
S0327	and do you have to choose thesis for your last year
S0326	you don't have to but i probably will
S0327	right and what will it be

S0327	they're not soulmates
S0326	calibre
S0327	they're not of great calibre
S0326	i mean of of course there's like two or three that be but generally speak i'm er but i'd rather spend time by myself
S0445	yeah well you're not far from anyway
S0326	yeah
S0327	i'm kind of surprise
S0326	i'm not actually when you think about it
S0445	no
S0327	what do you mean exactly
S0326	erm i think it's not it's not a give that all the sort of the most brilliant best people be gonna end up at
S0327	no of course it's not
S0326	and it's not even even the ones that might be be sort of erm there's a lot there's a big sort of everybody be quite there's sort of this there's obviously some it's not true for everybody but basically everybody's sort of the same kind of person
S0445	mm yeah
S0326	and even if they're not they try to be like one there's quite a lot of pressure
S0327	they're all middle class
S0326	to be like
S0327	straight middle class
S0326	no like upper like to be
S0327	oh really
S0326	sort of
S0327	posh
S0326	or to be a certain way in to like make
S0445	posher
S0326	like to be friends to do what be the status quo to do
S0445	mm
S0326	which sort of i think stop people be sort of a bite more interest than they might be otherwise
S0445	mm
S0326	i mean there's all sort of things like it doesn't happen in my college but every other college there's lot of drink societies and that and if you're not i've get one friend who isn't in one in her college and be just sort of
S0445	mm
S0326	ostracise so you have to be in one of these
S0445	really oh my god
S0326	archaic sort of perverse
S0445	that's
S0326	outdated club where you sort of binge drink and get humiliate in order to be have a social life it's that kind of thing go on
S0445	be the er or
S0326	there be an equivalent at but it's also just sort of sort of smaller ones
S0445	yeah
S0326	like there's
S0445	yeah
S0326	in some colleges there'll be like six or seven so and like the last two like no one want to be in them but it's just sort of so everybody can be in one
S0445	oh right okay
S0326	the people make
S0445	so be be you in one though
S0326	there's none in it's the it's the only one
S0445	oh okay
S0326	there isn't any
S0445	oh that's good
S0326	so people in it's well much different other people there
S0445	mm
S0326	partly because of that
S0445	mm
S0327	how interest
S0327	so people want really they just abide by tradition
S0326	well yeah and i mean if you think about it i guess that lot of people turn up there and they're like eighteen and they're shy and they wanna make friends and that everybody's be tell them for the last five years that this be gonna be the best time of their life
S0327	yes
S0445	yeah
S0326	therefore they'll be like
S0445	but all universities be like that
S0326	yeah i know but then but then they get like there's sort of people put like invitations to certain things in people's pigeonhole and then everyone's
S0445	oh really
S0326	so excite to be in like please with themselves
S0445	include yeah
S0326	to be invite that they're will to sort of do or any of the weird initiation ceremonies
S0445	oh like what what do you have to do
S0327	yes what be they
S0326	there's like all like you read about it in like the student paper when they get expose and stuff
S0445	oh really
S0326	or like weird things like you have to like girls have to like take off each other's bras with their teeth or something while like male members of the club be watch i
S0445	oh
S0326	like jelly wrestler sex
S0445	oh my god
S0327	no
S0326	yeah and there's lot of problems cos there's basically it's quite sometimes like people have manage to like get they have like group chat on facebook where they talk about their
S0445	oh yeah
S0326	their antic
S0445	oh
S0326	and they do i mean they do stuff like trash restaurants and
S0445	really
S0327	they don't
S0326	they do there's this one curry restaurant where you go there and you basically what you pay for you pay like twenty pound for the set menu but you're like basically no food and what you're pay for
S0445	mm
S0326	be like the the liecense to sort of make a mess and trash it
S0445	what
S0327	and these this be the cream of our
S0327	er educate society
S0326	obviously and and i mean you can avoid all that but
S0445	do you think that's mostly like the public the public school people or be it a mix of
S0326	i mean probably
S0327	it sound sound very public school
S0326	yeah i mean that's where
S0445	mm
S0326	they come from and then
S0445	yeah
S0326	people wanna be aspire to be like
S0445	mm
S0326	the people who be popular and in the club
S0445	yeah
S0326	and the sport team
S0327	i'm sorry to hear this because i mean you know obviously be indescribably privilege i i don't mind that as long as it's produce the right kind of people for the country you know as long as it's allow clever people to get a proper education but if they go and they go and trash a
S0445	mm
S0327	a curry house
S0445	yeah
S0327	that doesn't seem to me to be quite the highest
S0445	no
S0327	level to aspire to in in this life
S0445	uhu
S0327	you know what the problem be the problem be there's no national service anymore
S0445	do you think
S0326	yeah
S0327	if i be prime minister i would bring it in no if you put it different when i'm prime minister
S0327	i'll i'll bring it in and i would have it probably for boys between sixteen and eighteen for a year
S0445	uhu
S0327	and for girls maybe for six months and they'd all have to live together and it would be very discipline but they wouldn't have to fight
S0326	but why
S0327	they would do things in the city
S0326	do doesn't have to be an army
S0327	you know clean the streets
S0326	yeah it doesn't be a doesn't
S0327	no they just they have to do social things
S0445	well that's what david cameron be try to do
S0445	so be you gonna run for tory prime minister or
S0327	no because i'm i couldn't do that erm
S0326	what's that
S0327	it'll never happen because
S0326	well you can only
S0327	people will take it will think that it's you know
S0326	you can
S0327	get rid of their privilege and freedoms
S0445	mm absolutely
S0327	but but the problem be you know young people have boys have testosterone and girls go wild
S0327	and erm you know it it's it's difficult
S0445	erm you know who vote for who who vote tory
S0327	who
S0445	grandad
S0326	he actually
S0327	what my my grandad do he
S0445	your grandad
S0327	not my grandad but my
S0445	yeah
S0327	well he's go senile i'm tell
S0445	for the first time in his life yeah he's go senile
S0326	why do he
S0445	erm cos he didn't wanna vote for labour even though he's always be a really strong labour supporter
S0326	well why do he just not vote for someone else like green or something
S0445	yeah i don't know
S0327	i didn't vote for labour either this time for the first time
S0445	yeah
S0326	who do you vote for
S0445	lib dems
S0327	but i be pathetic i just didn't i didn't know who to vote for i just think
S0445	i try to tell you
S0327	well vote for the green be a waste of time what i like about the theory of
S0445	well
S0327	lim deb lib dems be that you know that they should be a balance act but i think no and then the labour party hardly exist anymore
S0445	yeah but that's i think that's like a stupid not excuse but
S0327	well i don't know what to do now i really
S0445	er do you not see their advert about look look leave look right and then cross
S0326	oh my days that be so funny
S0445	it be so cringe
S0326	oh no
S0327	none none of them be
S0445	the basically their argument be like
S0327	none of them be inspire
S0445	the other two be bad so you might as well vote for us like
S0326	who who win this seat
S0327	this be strong labour er stronghold
S0445	mm well no thank to you
S0327	no thank to me no exactly no exactly
S0327	i mean you know still compare to the rest of the world we're in a relatively good state aren't we so far
S0445	mm
S0327	no doubt about that you're very lucky
S0445	we be fine it's just that all the
S0326	except people under thirty
S0445	the youth yeah it's just all of us so
S0327	but you're fine too because you know
S0445	so look after the inheritance for me cos
S0327	you're both you're both highly educate you're both love a lot you're privilege if yes it's gonna be much more difficult for you in many many ways than for my generation
S0445	mm
S0327	there's no doubt about that but if you come from a you know a different kind of family you'd have no support you do have a lot of support
S0445	yeah
S0327	you know
S0326	yeah
S0327	i mean
S0326	i probably
S0327	i mean i'm not go to allow you to starve although a week or two i might consider wouldn't hurt
S0445	a week or two what
S0326	starve
S0327	yes
S0445	oh
S0327	i mean none of us
S0445	mm
S0327	know what it be to go hungry
S0445	mm
S0326	i go i go quite hungry in america and berlin
S0327	i i don't suppose it be very nice
S0326	er yeah it wasn't really but like
S0327	but you do know in the end but you be somehow in control it wasn't as though you think oh god you know that's it i'm never gonna be able to get any food again
S0326	yeah
S0327	it's not quite the same
S0326	but anyone can say that you can always sort of find around like outside supermarkets
S0326	in bin and stuff
S0445	oh yeah
S0327	yes
S0445	skip
S0326	i mean it's not
S0445	my friends do that
S0327	there's a big difference between people who come from families when they're or break families with no money and impoverish children of middle class
S0445	yeah but they do get more well mean to get more support from the government
S0326	not anymore
S0445	they do at university
S0327	not anymore
S0445	but yeah
S0327	no
S0445	not
S0327	well it be i mean there be no doubt that that it's difficult for you lot
S0445	mm yeah
S0327	i think what i might do in my will be to divide some of my i'm hop that when i'm dead the paint will actually have some value and i think i might
S0445	don't you have to put that all away so it doesn't get tax
S0327	i have to put it down on paper which be a drag erm but i'm think of do it you know so that one of you can have the sixties work one of you can have the eighties er i can pick out certain erm
S0445	i'll take sixties
S0327	will you now oh alright
S0327	one erm and i'll be sit on a cloud watch
S0445	can have eighties can have seventies and can have nineties
S0327	but seventies no i've destroy a lot of the seventies

S0327	a fair sum eighties
S0327	might get some money but the recent stuff
S0326	i like the recent stuff yeah yeah
S0445	mm
S0327	i mean maybe the recent stuff should go to to make up for him have to live in the shed

S0326	i've already get a master's actually when i finish
S0445	oh yeah
S0327	that's yeah well so do i so
S0326	yeah you get
S0327	oh it's automatically if you you can
S0326	yeah but it's
S0445	no but but the thing be yours will have like what be it after it so people know it's not a real you have to pay like fifty pound to get it
S0445	fifty basically how it work be if you're a you can pay to be an alumni in or as well
S0326	i dunno i i've never hear about this actually
S0445	it's like fifty pound and then your ba mature into a master's
S0327	be that so
S0445	yeah but it will have letter after it say like
S0327	i see and you can't if you don't pay your fifty pound
S0445	be what that's what i've be tell
S0327	that's a good wheeze isn't it
S0445	one of my
S0445	professors tell me
S0327	that's very clever of them
S0445	i know but mine will say ma
S0327	yes well it would be no if you do a master's anybody could do a phd i mean if you're clever you
S0445	oh yeah
S0327	until you're forty five
S0445	mm exactly
S0327	erm
S0445	although my friend's get a year leave to his phd and he's like twenty eight
S0327	right
S0326	yeah but what before his fund run out
S0445	no a year to a year leave to do it cos he have erm i think he have to do his over four or five years five years maybe and then it'll be do so you so you can if you just keep like
S0327	well i i
S0445	and if you get fund
S0327	the i've hear now that in art school they're consider not employ anybody to teach unless they have a phd it's art school have to
S0445	the they do yeah but they do that mostly anyway
S0327	i know but you can understand it with you know with
S0445	oh yes yeah
S0327	mathematics or you know geology or
S0445	mm
S0327	something where you i mean i i'm perfectly happy for my dentist or my doctor to have have a lot of years' education but
S0445	yeah
S0327	an artist it's ridiculous
S0445	but erm at dad's school they're try to get them to cut down on studio teach and just have it all lecture base because
S0327	yes
S0445	it's more financially viable
S0327	yeah
S0445	how can you teach art in a lecture
S0327	you can't
S0326	it's cos they don't understand because all universities have be turn into businesses
S0445	exactly
S0327	that's true
S0326	so there's no
S0445	yeah exactly
S0326	no there's no sort of understand or sympathy it's just well this be not it doesn't make sense economically so we should do this
S0445	yeah exactly the world be go to shit
S0327	it's
S0326	but it that's because of money as well
S0445	yeah
S0326	it's capitalism

S0327	when
S0326	they've get their claw in it now
S0445	and then boris johnson will be prime minister

S0445	okay
S0327	cos i and i haven't i do get a bite edgy when i think about it
S0445	well we need to organise train or maybe we don't need to organise train until

S0445	no we have to organise accomodation in if we're go to krakow and then warsaw
S0327	yes
S0445	whichever way round we need to organise that
S0327	exactly the but also apparently they don't have the euro and you have to get zlotys
S0445	do they not
S0327	they be they be in the eu but somebody say they think that they still have zlotys so
S0445	i didn't spend money when i go so i'm not sure i'm sure they have euro i can i can google it
S0327	yeah
S0445	do poland use the but what i always do whenever i go away be i just when i get off the plane i take money out in the airport and they convert it and it come out

S0445	mm
S0445	yeah
S0327	i i don't think that would be good i do get bird

S0327	nature's hideous
S0326	i know and then it be sort of fly really quite low and all the crow be just like
S0445	crow be horrible
