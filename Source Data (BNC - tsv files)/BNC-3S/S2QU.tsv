S0519	of october erm so dad's organise all the erm
S0522	oh
S0520	which be quite amuse
S0520	it's like mum go to i want to you to be in charge of and then you just think mm maybe this wasn't the easiest way round
S0519	no
S0520	he's be good in the end
S0519	he be in the end but you're right it's you know we hire anyvan dot com
S0520	and they'll have the exact opposite reaction like dad'll be like well this one's only a thousand pound but the other people want four and mum'll be like no
S0519	they if it's
S0520	go with the expensive one
S0519	well l i yeah as you very well know i say well what's wrong with it then but he have one he he say oh look these be from thirty nine pound upwards they're move our entire house and your grand piano
S0522	dad you pay for what you get
S0520	well eventually of course you know whatever brilliant deal be up there it's not really a brilliant deal it's just like pretend to be and then they say oh by the way you know there's tax and this and that and it all add up to the same doesn't it it's not like anyone i mean six thousand pound be a bite over the top but
S0519	yeah that's right mm
S0520	yeah so he's get a special guy to do the piano and the rest he doesn't care about really
S0519	well eventually we get a good people and i make him do the
S0520	stick it in a warehouse
S0519	so this be the very last thing i say have you check any review er so we do and the firm get great review so we just go with that but it's three and a half thousand just for the furniture and erm another four hundred for the piano
S0520	it's quite a lot isn't it to be honest but that's include storage for six months
S0519	yes i think he put five to six months and they estimate for that so
S0520	so that take you to september october november december
S0519	october november december january february march we won't be do by then i shouldn't think
S0520	well you might be
S0519	we could be but
S0520	when do people start put their house on
S0519	i think probably march
S0520	march probably yeah
S0519	yeah
S0520	be that what you think
S0519	do you know
S0522	sorry i didn't hear
S0520	do when people start put their house on the market like march or april
S0522	yeah usually it's spring isn't it
S0519	mm
S0520	yeah
S0519	because we think it it's gonna
S0520	i mean you could find somewhere in the winter
S0519	we could we could
S0520	but and you might get a better deal but erm most people wait don't they to move in the summer
S0519	mm
S0522	so erm what's the next plan then
S0519	so
S0522	so you've gotta do you have to store all your stuff somewhere
S0519	we do
S0522	yeah
S0519	yeah so erm the firm be from edinburgh and they'll store it somewhere doesn't matter to us and deliver it to the new place
S0522	mm
S0519	which we've tell them be erm as an approximate we say you know well dad say he's he's the one do do it all and erm so they've give a price for everything
S0522	mm
S0519	and the piano firm be from and they're go to store it in erm and it'll be deliver here erm to wherever and we sign up with an estate agent in that have an do that mean anything to you
S0522	yeah i've see their name
S0519	erm and they they've get an a an agent in as well and so they've sign us up in
S0522	you realise in the nice place that erm like there's someone at work who er be rent in
S0519	and where's that
S0522	er near erm so that kind of where the lord bin be where we've be to that pub
S0519	mm
S0522	erm and there be a big there's a big park outside anyway erm but he's be look to buy for two years and like the house don't even get onto the website you know that they go because an agent tell them it's come and they go and see it before it's even so i you know in these nice place i think that's why you need to probably register with more you know agents as oppose to rely on rightmove
S0519	mm mm mm mm rightmove they only get to rightmove
S0522	because people want to live in these
S0519	mm
S0522	spot and they're just so popular
S0520	that's a good point you probably i mean rightmove be a nice place to sort of fee your dream and see what you want you know
S0522	that's it yeah
S0520	but it's not the place probably to spot your house cos like say it's be on for a while
S0522	and if it's be on for two years there's a reason it's just
S0519	no that's right
S0520	someone doesn't want to live there cos it's like mouldy or something on a road or something
S0519	yeah no we just saw a nice one on the a51 you know we say you know that that's why it's still on there cos it you think
S0522	but also how expensive
S0519	they're crazy price
S0522	the house be in like we just up the here if you go out here and then you carry on straight up that hill
S0519	mm
S0522	there's two for sale on the right and they be detach but they're very close to the other ones and the garden be quite modest i think one's a three bed and one's a four bed and i be think well i i just i like that road and i like the house and er i look and it be like nearly five hundred thousand
S0520	shit
S0522	you just think what
S0520	you're very close to manchester and warrington here i wonder if you go a hour south of here you wouldn't have
S0522	oh yeah you've get the luxury of be out
S0520	because it's not a commuter distance any more
S0519	no er erm
S0520	i mean people do commute that far but it's not really need be it
S0519	yeah no i think that's what we're hop to do
S0520	you just and you don't want to be too near to birmingham the other side
S0519	be be a little bite more south but then when you when you see like seem a lovely village or a like a almost a mini town isn't it
S0522	yeah a very nice one yeah
S0519	erm but very nice and then erm so we've see some house near there just on rightmove and they always look lovely but really expensive
S0522	oh yeah
S0519	erm
S0522	cos that's like family heaven there you know there's good school and commute
S0519	that's right
S0522	same with
S0519	erm and what about erm so i tell you do you know
S0522	yeah
S0519	and be that also still in the super duper

S0522	mm yeah it's a bite isn't it
S0520	this be mum i mean mum be say that she didn't she you know you're more incline to be south of than north of her you didn't like it up there much

S0519	mm
S0520	i have my eye on a jumper in jigsaw cost a fortune
S0519	mm

S0522	i buy some from warehouse and they're really nice
S0520	ah can i see them
S0522	yeah they're erm
S0520	i would like some grey i'd like a grey pair and the nice thing about the next ones be that they're twenty two pound which be affordable but they look you know they're a good shape aren't they you have to hoick them up a lot cos of the waistband get lose but
S0519	mm
S0520	er eh because they do long and extra long in next on all of their style and that just make all the difference cos otherwise it doesn't reach your yeah can you get that yours be see you should get petite you well you should try the ones
S0519	i know but then they only have those in markies
S0520	well you should try the ones on in next
S0522	well the warehouse ones be kinds of just long enough

S0519	these be just regular
S0520	inch leg
S0519	so i'm just a little shorty

S0519	yeah
S0520	but most of the time erm the long length not only be better but somehow it's cut better for a tall person not just a longer thing you know it's like
S0519	that's the difference that if you think about me the the wide bite of the trouser be too low and the narrow you know everything's in the wrong place
S0520	mm well that's why you should get petite and they do that in the
S0519	i know i know
S0520	in that's what i mean in next that erm for the trousers i be quite pleasantly surprise cos they do so many different
S0519	i think they just do regular and long i don't think they do short

S0520	yeah she be a bite mean she be be a bite of a meany so anyway that be that i say right so we put despicable me on and after all that they watch it for about five minutes and then they weren't bother
S0522	yeah exactly
S0520	so that wasn't a good move
S0522	as long as it's in english you're alright
S0522	i love despicable me
S0520	anything with erm minions in it that be the idea
S0522	yeah minions be good
S0520	like the minions
S0522	yeah good yeah
S0520	yeah erm it look good fun the despicable me er i think it be the second one that i put on i haven't see it it look really funny with that woman
S0522	oh yeah yeah it be erm cos gru isn't in the minion movie i i like the minion movie less it's all a bite too much minions
S0520	yeah it's more funny when they come in occasionally and do like a silly thing
S0522	that's what i mean but i be like all that
S0520	but i don't know if i want to watch a two hours of them do
S0522	there be some really funny moments though
S0520	and they be really funny
S0522	inside out out you need to watch that that be really lovely
S0520	i know i really want to see it
S0522	it be not it wasn't good enough for cos there's no action and it's really like one of those that's more for adult in term of the what
S0520	yeah it sound quite adult theme be say
S0522	it's really yeah quite emotional it's kind of er
S0520	she have all these her emotions have a kind of
S0522	about a yeah it's all her emotions and erm memories and er you know how how the family and how important the love be you know be from your parent and
S0520	mm yeah i've read really good review of it i'd quite like to see it in the cinema
S0522	it's just an it's clever you know cos it's all the different
S0520	yeah it sound really interest
S0522	each one have a different character
S0520	but think even for it be a little bite old
S0522	yeah yeah she like it but it's just because
S0520	she tell me a bite about it but she didn't you know go into it she say
S0522	no she didn't know what they mean
S0520	she say there be anger and something and then she didn't know the rest
S0522	yeah
S0520	and then you know she didn't sort of understand the kind of whole thing but that's the idea isn't it that you can talk you can talk to a child about feel and stuff
S0522	but the clever ones be the ones that appeal to the adult as well
S0520	yeah they be that's right well despicable me have a lot of like little hide joke dome's it very funny i haven't even see the end of the first one so i don't know how he grow to like the children and stuff
S0522	yeah oh i see oh right yeah
S0520	yeah like i don't know how it resolve you know i've get about halfway through the first one where he's have to take these children in

S0520	he start to love them yeah me and be watch mad men
S0522	what do you think

S0522	yeah it do get a bite bore
S0520	but i do like it
S0522	yeah we love don
S0520	erm the third series be quite hard for me to get through i just think do you know what i don't care
S0522	it do have trouble for it
S0520	how many time do you need to see them have
S0522	affairs
S0520	affairs and drink er you know it's like
S0522	all day long
S0520	yeah this be what's amaze about it be that they're just literally drink all day and smoke which must have be what it be like but i also more or less can't stand the wife
S0522	no she's awful but that's the point isn't it
S0520	i mean i know that's the point but i like literally i don't want to watch it because i i'm so annoy by her character
S0522	yeah and how she be with her her children
S0520	she's just awful
S0522	well she's just
S0520	and er 's be the same he's be catch up cos i be a bite ahead of him cos we try and watch it in tandem so that when we're together
S0522	sweet
S0520	and erm he's just get so irritate with this woman and even with the actress you're think either she's really do and good job or she's
S0522	she's very beautiful elizabeth jones
S0520	she be very beautiful she have lot of nice dress on all the time
S0522	yeah
S0520	but she just get worse and worse
S0522	she play it very well she's like completely emotionless
S0520	oh she's like the classic neurotic woman isn't she high maintenance but erm well now i've only get to the end of the third series so she's just go off with that erm other man so we'll see what happen and i'm all for don break free and go out alone
S0522	other man erm i can't tell you what happen
S0520	but there's eight series don't tell me anything there's eight series so god i don't know if i can hack another five series of it
S0522	it end quite well as well like it's not a kind of painful
S0520	mm that's good
S0522	as in you think how do they end it
S0520	well i like don and he do that i mean that's what it all hinge around isn't it that you like don and you want to want don to be happy and he's kind of but the thing be be that the first series it be really interest cos you start to find out he's not who he say he be
S0522	yeah that's right so there's more too it
S0520	it's all really interest and then that they kind of leave that behind a bite
S0522	no we get bore with it quite a lot it go up and down
S0520	yeah i don't know if i would have keep watch it if it be on the telly
S0522	it's obviously
S0520	it's really well do isn't it
S0522	yeah
S0520	and i like that you sort of know see all the historical things happen you know in context
S0522	yeah yeah and just how it be like that kind of wealthy how women be treat and
S0520	yeah yeah god yeah that's so shock at the begin i be like oh my god cos you don't they do it really realistic don't they they do like how they would speak to women and how they would treat them and stuff
S0522	yeah and they're all secretaries
S0520	yeah apart from peggy peggy's my favourite
S0522	peggy she's brilliant and how attractive be that redhead

S0522	yeah
S0520	that's really nice

S0520	i know that's what keep say
S0522	and she always
S0520	he's like her boob be massive
S0522	it's not right be it but she's my favourite in term of the clothe as well
S0520	she's like a woman isn't she i really like her character as well she's get sort of she's quite dignify
S0522	so what's happen with her in series three
S0520	she get marry to that bloke the doctor
S0522	who isn't nice
S0520	we don't like him he more or less rap her in the office and then be just a bite self absorb and be definitely not her equal in term of quality of character
S0522	mm
S0520	and but she's still marry to him and he doesn't get the job that he want so he decide to join the army that's all that's happen so she's still marry to him
S0522	and have she have a child
S0520	no
S0522	no
S0520	don't worry and er
S0522	i think that be all when she
S0520	no she erm
S0522	she have a kid with him
S0520	well it's on the card isn't it she be just back oh what happen at the end of series three be the english firm have take over and then they're plan to sell again the whole company and don and the other cronies at the top decide to buy it back and set up their own firm again do you remember
S0522	okay yeah
S0520	so they're go to be like split up break up and they decide to do a little nifty business manoeuvre and they just start a new business and they get joanie back on board cos she's not be work there and she become like one of their main employees again so she's just join rejoin the firm basically so she wasn't in the third series very much cos she wasn't in the office she be off she be just
S0522	yeah
S0520	so you wonder what's go to happen to her the old guy what be his name stirling
S0522	yeah

S0522	i do vaguely remember that
S0520	funny that he so yeah you don't know whether she's not really a main character she's not really in it really she's just pretty as they all be peggy's pretty as well in a way but yeah peggy's the main character for me
S0522	yeah well she's the one that and erm who what's the redhead's name
S0520	joanie
S0522	joanie and her be the two women that actually
S0520	have a bite of character yeah they're not just wive be they
S0519	who's this
S0520	we're just discuss this show that i be tell you and dad about with that be set in the nineteen sixties mad men
S0519	oh yes yeah
S0520	yeah cos they watch it all on telly and i
S0519	you you enjoy it didn't you
S0522	yeah
S0519	i do didn't even attempt it i always think it be just you know
S0522	yeah
S0520	it's not just
S0522	we recommend it to grandad but i can't remember whether he like it or not because of it be that era but it's probably a bite slow for him
S0520	too slow yeah i think you would quite be interest i mean there be a lot of
S0519	but yeah i think he do watch it i i think he do
S0520	they have quite a hedonistic lifestyle so they do just drink and smoke and have affairs a lot but that's exactly what they be do it wasn't erm it's not for the sake of erm entertainment really
S0519	mm no just fortuitous
S0520	and it's not like explicit in any way and er
S0519	you haven't nick my cream have you
S0520	your bb cream
S0519	no my actual moisturiser i i actually come with nothing i come with two deodorants
S0522	handy
S0520	she didn't bring her wine or anything
S0522	oh dear
S0519	i bring nothing i be absolutely useless no pyjamas
S0520	i've get moisturiser in my bag if you want to use mine
S0519	and no hand cream nothing hello jay yeah you're family be here today
S0520	jay sleep on my in my nook all night
S0519	he erm while dad be here with he say he keep meow at me
S0520	imagine dad doesn't have a clue do he what be i suppose to do
S0519	and i say yes he just want a bite of love you could have give him a bite of food but he most he probably want oh
S0520	imagine the horror
S0522	i think you should try put like a grey colour in
S0519	that's what say
S0520	that's what i say i think the blonde be kind of out of context
S0522	only very
S0519	i'm go to cut this blonde out anyway
S0520	yeah but also
S0519	so i'm gonna have it cut and then a lot of that
S0522	that's quite white isn't it grey which wash you out the hair come through
S0519	yeah
S0520	if you go for a dark grey
S0519	it's very white but then if you look under there be quite a bite of dark in there
S0522	dark in there
S0519	and at the back
S0520	you should be
S0522	cos it just need warm up
S0520	as a brunette yeah
S0519	it do
S0520	yeah
S0519	so what i need to do be get rid of the blonde
S0520	definitely yeah
S0519	and then find something nice
S0522	to put through
S0519	to put through as a highlight erm
S0522	mm
S0519	but obviously the yellow
S0520	yeah even if you put a warmer darker grey through
S0519	be clearly not the one
S0520	i think it would be better
S0522	yellow be not the choice
S0519	goldilocks yellow be not the choice it's fade
S0520	goldilocks
S0519	it be fade you can probably tell it's not as yellow as it be but er it you know
S0522	it's just that you've get such strong eyebrows and pale skin
S0519	yeah
S0520	the colour be not right yeah
S0522	it's not do you any favour
S0520	yeah
S0519	no no that's right but hopefully erm i could
S0520	i wonder if it would be best just to bite the bullet for a few months grow it out fully and see what your natural colour be
S0519	that see what i've get i'm that's what i'm go to do and
S0520	and then they can dye it from there
S0519	then so i've get to get rid of the yellow now
S0520	the yellow
S0519	and er and then when that's go which will only be another couple of cut i might go shorter this time and then that'll be quite a bite of it go
S0520	yeah
S0519	i might not but you know i it grow fast anyway so
S0520	mm
S0519	but er
S0522	right i might have a shower
S0519	it's a lovely shower you just want to stand it that shower don't you
S0520	mm
S0519	recommend this bb cream erm it's just like moisturiser with a bite of foundation in i think do you mention it once before
S0522	oh mm you've mention it
S0520	it's good or tint moisturiser be basically what it be erm but it's give a bite of foundation coverage but it's also suppose to be i mean you should wear it with moisturiser i think cos it do feel a bite cakey yeah
S0522	dry
S0519	but it look really nice on you yesterday
S0520	i'm gonna wear it today
S0519	er i'm go to put it on now see what it's like without oh and you don't need much do you
