S0008	i sort of go out and of course it be grey everywhere
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er there be sort of a bite of glow in the sky and i think ah yeah it's rubbish i'll go indoors and then as i be sort of walk slowly indoors i suddenly look up and the cloud have thin and there it be
S0012	yeah
S0013	wow
S0008	and er the cloud be such that it form a really good filter
S0012	brilliant yeah yeah
S0008	know what i mean
S0012	yeah
S0008	so i then run run indoors and get the camera
S0013	mm
S0008	and er come out again and you could see where it be and it be sort of like
S0012	yeah
S0008	bite more cloudy bite less cloudy bite more

S0012	oh
S0013	oh nice
S0008	and it be really clear
S0012	yeah
S0008	although you know you be still photograph through cloud
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos there be one bite where it do actually clear you know much much thinner
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then it be so so bright then that you couldn't look at it you know
S0012	no
S0008	but this be just the right amount of filter
S0013	oh
S0008	brilliant
S0013	yeah
S0012	i watch it through my
S0008	but er the you know there be sort of people sort of send photos up
S0012	mm yeah
S0008	to the edp and stuff
S0012	that's it yeah
S0008	and all this and my photo be much clearer
S0012	be it
S0008	much sharper than
S0012	yeah
S0008	any of them but they be sort of say
S0013	you should have do it
S0008	yeah
S0012	no they don't pay you for it though do they
S0008	no
S0013	no they don't
S0012	and they
S0008	it's all part of this idea that newspapers have nowadays that
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	they get people to write in and to send photos in
S0012	send us your photo of this crash and stuff like that you know
S0008	and that's right yeah and they don't pay them it's just for the benefit of you know the
S0013	mm
S0012	they sometimes put the name up
S0008	that's right yeah
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	but you don't get any money like
S0008	and er it's just like cheap production innit
S0012	it be yeah
S0008	yeah
S0012	but all these freelance photographers must must have lose no end
S0008	mm you'd have to get something specialise wouldn't you
S0012	yeah
S0008	without anyone with a
S0012	yeah with a phone and everything i mean a friend up up you know him up the road he's get this phone that take such fantastic picture
S0008	mm
S0013	mm
S0012	just as good as any

S0012	yeah yeah they've even get one a phone now that you can put a lens on on to it
S0008	have they
S0012	yeah
S0008	all seem a bite unnecessary
S0013	how do you do that
S0012	well that's what i mean that's a bite stupid innit
S0008	that's right they always do these things where they get some gismo and they keep add stuff to it till it become
S0012	yeah they do and then in the end you've get a have a great big bag to carry it
S0008	that's right yeah and then they'll go back to minimise it again
S0012	yeah
S0008	but the other the other have you ever see anything so ridiculous in all your life do you see that yesterday they have this procession with richard the third's bone
S0012	that's what i want to tell you
S0008	you know and there's all these people line the streets and they say oh in a in a coffin make with english oak you know and all this sort of thing

S0008	i put i put the fault down to diana
S0012	yeah
S0008	that's when it all well no i don't suppose it do all start then but
S0012	no it start with churchill really doesn't it
S0008	yeah but i mean at least there be some reason for it wasn't there i mean a lot of people have a lot of
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	that's right cos what happen er in nineteen fifty three the queen be crown wasn't she
S0008	mm
S0012	and we all at school get a jamboree bag and we and
S0008	you get a bag er
S0012	yeah a little like big as a crisp bag full of little bits and piece that be the you know like a paper bag

S0012	i remember that when we have erm what they call assembly we have to go to assembly every morning didn't we and and there be all the prayers
S0008	you have the hymn book didn't you
S0012	and you have the hymn book and everything and all that but there be some who never come into the assembly they be all exempt from assembly

S0008	they weren't i'm not hundred percent if at our school whether the catholics weren't allow in or they have their own
S0012	they have their own didn't they
S0008	mm
S0012	in fact where in we have a catholic school where only the catholics go to
S0008	mm i tell you something it feel age since i come round doesn't it
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	in the mean time do you see in the edp they have a little photo gallery or it might have be in the even news about forgers and and iron work and machine place in in
S0012	in yeah
S0008	you know show them about cast metal and stuff in various place
S0012	yeah
S0008	which be all now long go even
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er but they have a picture of you know work
S0012	do they
S0008	in i forget where it be but i bet er it be sort of like in the sixties early sixties
S0012	yeah
S0008	and there be this sort of like you know if you recognise anyone in this photo get in touch
S0012	oh be it
S0008	and i be i be go to send it to you but for some reason i didn't get round to it or give you the link you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	ha
S0012	oh might have see someone might have know someone
S0008	yeah but it be quite interest that in see i've get this argument about how britain have be let down ever since the war by successive governments
S0012	yeah
S0008	in as much as you know people that be really industrious have work hard but it never seem to get as far forward as everyone else
S0012	no
S0008	like america or germany or
S0012	that's right
S0008	people like that and er and it's not just the sort of national er identity or national way of life it's the you know the whole organisation have be so crappy in britain
S0012	yeah
S0008	that you know people be work you know and everything's against them to get to do you know do really
S0012	it be isn't it to do well
S0008	you know to achieve something
S0012	yeah
S0008	i mean it's change a bite now
S0012	yeah
S0008	i think where people be more much more professional in in run in their business
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know the business be run much more professionally
S0012	yeah
S0008	but you know during that era all these businesses be run by sort of be sort of family businesses and they be sort of you know just run into the grind weren't they
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and like the people who own them use to take as much as they could out of it
S0012	they use to it didn't they
S0008	they'd never replace machinery
S0012	no
S0008	never do any modernisation and stuff
S0012	no when my friend use to work down the the down
S0008	yeah
S0012	their lathes and all their machinery be all victorian
S0008	yeah they be yeah i've get a feel that in this there's some belt dry machinery in there at the time
S0012	yeah not when i go but there be some cos he start off in his garage where i where i spend my apprenticeship he start off in his garage s and g sergeant
S0008	mm
S0012	and they build up to what they be you know
S0008	well this be what i really notice that in these photos be these people work in these foundries and in engineer work and stuff like that they be all wear you know like all their old clothe and stuff like that
S0012	yeah
S0008	and sort of like look really sort of you know wear warn out clothe and old jacket and
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0008	all their old stuff and look like a load of tramp off the street
S0012	they be yeah
S0008	and when i go to germany you know in the sort of eighties ah well late seventies everyone who go to work anywhere use to work like overalls bib and brace stuff or you know they'd have a special overalls work gear you know
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	and it be all smart and every week they'd have clean it you know and come up
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you know and you could go in in all the shop i mean like place like tesco's and that and they'd have a whole range of work gear you know so you could sort of kit yourself out in your your work gear they wouldn't dream of go to work in their own clothe
S0012	no but then when i do work in a big factory they supply the overalls
S0008	mm
S0012	and they i think it be ideal you use to come you use to pile your overall in and they use to come and wash them
S0008	laundry
S0012	and
S0008	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	that's right but i mean for a long time you know all these firm be just
S0012	oh they just they use people
S0008	it be just work inside someone's shed wasn't it
S0012	yeah they do they use people
S0008	you know they just have these sort of place and
S0013	yeah
S0012	they use to say well if you can't do it we can get other people can
S0008	mm
S0012	and and at one time people who i think this be in the late thirties forties they use to stand outside the gate and they use to say we'll have you you you and you and call them in
S0008	that be a traditional sort of docker style wasn't it
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	round the dock that you'd turn up
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	seven o'clock in the morning and then
S0012	and then they'd pick you
S0008	they'd pick you if you didn't get a job you have to go home again
S0012	yeah cor dear
S0008	and i think it's probably in field work as well a similar sort of thing
S0012	yeah yeah it be it be
S0008	all this sort of casual work
S0012	what a terrible thing though eh
S0008	well you only have to watch that film i'm alright jack
S0012	oh yes
S0008	you know with peter sellers in it
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	and to see what the state of play be
S0012	life be yeah yeah
S0008	in in manufacture in this country
S0012	yeah oh it be terrible wannit
S0008	it's hardly surprise the whole bloom industry in this country just go to the dog innit
S0012	well it do i mean they do they could have have a good industry in this country
S0008	course they could
S0012	it do get sell off and spoil
S0008	yeah but it be only basically when nissan come to this country
S0012	yeah
S0008	that they start have proper industrial relations with you know with the workforce
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	cos before it be just us and them and er
S0012	that's right
S0008	you know nobody everyone be out for what they could get
S0012	yeah well where the er unions weren't recognise the boss use to be able to just take or leave them you know if you'd you're you're get this amount of pay and when i when i go to for instance look at him look at him out there
S0008	mm mm what be it
S0008	oh right
S0012	he can't get in can he
S0013	yeah
S0008	no he's just chew through the plastic
S0012	that's wire
S0008	mm tough luck the blue tit's go crazy over there probably get a nest
S0012	yeah
S0008	but even good firm like you know where people use to love work like
S0012	yeah
S0008	and and er and
S0012	yeah
S0008	firm like that i mean people use to be really proud to work there
S0012	they do didn't they
S0008	but they still weren't treat very well
S0012	no no they be suppose to get all this that and the other the first one to do it be cadbury's wannit when they they give them a house to live in
S0013	yeah they do
S0012	as long as they work for them
S0008	but that be tie wasn't it
S0012	that be tie house yeah
S0008	that be a bite like erm farmers cottages
S0012	that's right yeah and if you didn't work for them you lose your house
S0008	yeah that's right so you have to make
S0012	with all the furniture outside
S0008	mm but you have to make sure that you didn't fall out with the boss didn't you
S0012	that's right yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	i don't know there's so much wrong with this country i think the major problem be you know they talk about the house crisis right and er what they can do and what they can't do about how they give all this money away but the best thing they could do be to have a really strictly regulate let system
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	well there's
S0008	whereby there's fix rent fix condition you know a bite like in you know in germany
S0012	yeah that's right
S0008	like people don't bother about buy house
S0012	they don't do they no
S0008	cos you can rent so easily and you know you're get a standard of of apartment whereas in this country rent be only for the poor people innit
S0012	yeah yeah and and that's sort of type of run it where where they just
S0008	yeah yeah and and the government must realise
S0013	you would think they'd check out wouldn't you
S0012	yeah
S0008	but the government must realise that it really restrict movement of er workers
S0012	it do
S0008	you know cos if you've you know get a house in and you have to go to manchester it cost you a bloom fortune
S0012	it would wouldn't it yeah
S0008	to sell up and all the hassle and you know you get to wait months before you get the money and then you get to rent somewhere and then buy somewhere and what have you
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you know when you've get to rent somewhere you're talk about two or three thousand quid
S0012	yeah
S0008	to hand over and all these all these
S0012	and then when they come in and inspect they say oh there's a spot on the wall that will cost you a thousand quid where we've get to have a thousand pound to paint that
S0008	yeah yeah but the erm yeah and and at one time they say that agencies weren't allow to charge you
S0012	mm
S0008	but they all charge you they're still charge they just call it something different don't they
S0012	yeah
S0008	like registration or something or
S0012	that's it yeah
S0008	what have you
S0013	that's right
S0012	yeah registration fee
S0008	and it's not like a hundred quid it's sort of five or six hundred quid you know
S0012	yeah always have to pay a registration fee for something or other i mean that that
S0008	well they they say they have to do a a erm
S0012	inventory and stuff like that
S0008	well yeah and they have to do a sort of er erm credit check
S0012	oh yeah yeah
S0008	yeah and that they charge a hundred and fifty quid for that
S0012	yeah
S0008	i mean it cost ten quid
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	it's absolutely i mean it's real you know it's real rip off britain isn't it
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	you know
S0012	and apparently if you don't borrow money you can't get a credit
S0008	well apparently so yeah if you haven't get i haven't get a credit rat
S0012	i haven't get a credit rat
S0008	i've never never borrow money
S0012	no
S0013	yes we have
S0012	well we just borrow money
S0013	must have
S0012	well for the for the mortgage yeah
S0008	well
S0013	you do yeah and if you do barclaycard and that it's erm
S0008	oh yeah but
S0012	yeah but we pay that off every month
S0008	then if you pay it off every month they don't register
S0013	it's still call a isn't it still call a credit rat our credit rat be good cos we pay off
S0008	yeah but no if we pay it off
S0012	yeah that's only with barclays
S0008	if you pay off every month like the whole amount
S0012	mm or generally
S0008	you don't get a bonus on your credit rat for that
S0012	no you don't
S0008	any time you get a bonus be if you get a constant debt of five thousand then you you pay the interest every month
S0013	oh right
S0012	yeah
S0008	regularly
S0013	okay
S0008	you know
S0012	the credit rat be do by by two different firm and er i forget what they're call but
S0008	experian be one
S0012	experian be one and there there be another one and that's where your credit rat come from
S0013	mm
S0012	it's nothing to do with barclays or or lloyds or any bank or anything like that that's if you owe money and you're pay it off you're get a good credit rat
S0013	mm
S0012	but if you owe money and you don't pay it off that's where it where everything
S0008	or if you've get a county court judge you know you've have a er an argument with someone about what they owe and that but they it be on the radio the other day they don't take you know they don't have all the information
S0012	no
S0008	they just have some of it and then they make a guess on that but
S0012	yeah
S0008	mm if that guess be wrong
S0012	that's right you have it ain't you
S0008	you have it
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know it's all mighty number of hoop you have to jump through to get it put right
S0012	and there's also a a credit rat on your address
S0008	that's right if someone have live there previously
S0012	yeah now we have somebody oh years and years ago some and er the credit and they write to us say something about it didn't they
S0013	yeah
S0012	i can't remember what be be
S0013	it be to here actually wasn't it
S0012	to here yeah
S0013	no one else have live here
S0012	have a bad credit rat
S0013	they have a a name associate
S0012	and they have a name associate with our address
S0013	mm
S0012	so we phone them up and write to them and all that and they oh there's be a terrible mistake
S0013	mm
S0012	but that's good innit
S0008	mm
S0012	and they they writ it off you know they they
S0008	change it
S0012	change it all but somebody somewhere have give this address
S0008	yeah but it shouldn't be up to you to
S0012	no it shouldn't no
S0013	we'll just have to get in touch say
S0008	it's like bloom erm i'm still at loggerheads with the television license authority
S0012	be you cos you ain't get one
S0008	they send another letter yesterday and each letter be get more and more threaten you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they say if you erm you know have any valid reason for not have please get in touch with us on like this number you know or on this website
S0013	mm
S0008	and i'm think no why should i get in touch with them
S0012	yeah
S0008	come and do your darndest
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos you know i mean
S0012	come and take my television away
S0008	it's bloody cheeky isn't it i reckon that you have to prove
S0013	yeah
S0008	i mean it doesn't happen with a gun licence or a fish licence or a any other sort of licence
S0012	no no no you have to prove you haven't you a television well they get maybe you have
S0008	they just assume that you've get a television and you get to prove you haven't
S0013	yeah
S0012	he's be pay his television licence although he hasn't get a television
S0013	cos it erm it's because it be on the stand charge
S0012	on a stand charge and he keep pay his television licence
S0013	he hasn't yet he get in touch with them he hadn't have a television for a long time
S0012	and now he can get all his money back retrospectfully
S0013	apparently yeah
S0008	can he get his money back
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah yeah that's what they've tell him he hadn't get it yet
S0012	that's what they tell him he hadn't get it yet
S0008	but how much it must be a minimum amount of time
S0012	there must be
S0008	or a maximum amount of time
S0012	yeah oh er it isn't over a year anyway be it
S0008	but i reckon the er you know and i'm now in a case where the the enforcement officer be go to call round at any time day or night and check whether i've get a television
S0012	and be they can they break in if you're
S0008	no no no no no they can't come in at all they can only come in if you invite them in
S0012	yeah
S0008	if you stand on the doorstep and you don't have to answer any question either
S0012	no
S0008	and er if they think you've get a telly they can go away and get a a a search warrant
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	and then they come back with the police right and then they can search your house and can check your your computer and all this sort of stuff
S0012	oh course you can watch watch telly on the computer can't you
S0008	well you need a tv card don't you
S0012	you do yeah
S0008	mostly so they can see if there's one of them stick in the back
S0012	oh yeah course
S0008	and er although they do live stream as well don't they
S0012	yeah they do yeah
S0008	i'm not hundred percent sure that that count because the the tv licence word say that you're not allow to watch anything on your computer which be be show live on tv right
S0012	oh i see
S0008	and like the stream isn't on the tv
S0012	no it isn't
S0008	this be the other thing i be think if i buy myself a a video pass for motor gp
S0012	yeah
S0008	which be stream live you know without go through the television at all
S0012	yeah
S0008	and no one else can you can't see it on television you can only see it stream
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	you know whether that count i don't know it's live so i don't bother there's nothing on i mean it yeah there be absolutely nothing i want to watch really
S0012	there isn't no
S0013	no
S0008	even if i miss something you know i i don't particular i'm not that interest in it
S0013	well no no
S0008	watch it later
S0012	no no we're not what what we do watch first thing in the morning be some of the bits that we've er record
S0013	yeah there be some good stuff this morning weren't there
S0012	i can't remember what we watch this morning
S0013	erm the food we eat
S0012	oh the food we eat yeah
S0013	oh how blueberries be a a super food
S0012	all about super foods
S0008	oh right
S0013	and
S0012	and
S0012	and how they get this er get rid of of what be it call er get rid of the the
S0013	antioxidants
S0012	antioxidant the yeah
S0008	oxidants
S0012	the yeah and radical digerydoos
S0008	radicals
S0012	yeah radicals
S0008	toxic radicals
S0013	give you cancer and things yeah
S0012	that's it yeah and a very good to er get rid of any cancer type cells
S0008	mm
S0013	what do they have they have broccoli
S0008	yeah broccoli be
S0013	oh
S0008	be brilliant for
S0013	green tea
S0012	green tea yeah
S0013	what's that spice
S0012	blueberries
S0013	that spice turmeric
S0012	turmeric
S0013	and something else
S0012	and they get this tablet now that they've now formulate
S0008	mm
S0012	because all these different thing this be cancer research all these different thing attack the cancer in a different way
S0008	mm
S0012	and they're all naturally naturally produce if i mean er in lot of countries where they've prove that they eat all this type of thing there's hardly any cancer
S0008	far fewer cancers mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	whereas in this country you've get one in two chance of catch get cancer in your lifetime don't you
S0012	well that's right yeah in your whole lifetime
S0008	yeah i mean that's pretty pretty short odds innit
S0012	yeah that be
S0013	isn't it
S0012	anyhow that's that's they get this er tablet formulate but they say you needn't have the tablet all you need to do be eat the eat the food well that's that's what come out of it altogether
S0013	that be basically yeah
S0012	basically they say if you if you eat eat your proper food instead of all this
S0008	process
S0012	process stuff
S0013	i can't really remember what the blueberry result be because they people be say they're some be say they're stress some say they be tire all the time erm
S0012	yeah well the
S0013	they do it on various different people didn't they
S0012	they do yeah and they all come out they be the best one be ninety percent better you know have ninety percent
S0008	mm mm improvement
S0012	improvement and the worst one be sixty percent improvement but they all improve so well that they all felt better
S0013	mm but it could have be just through
S0008	that's until they find the next wonder food
S0012	well yeah yeah well that be just that experiment
S0013	yeah
S0012	well the things they do be always good
S0008	with er broccoli and blueberries that's sort of fairly well document
S0012	anyway
S0013	yes they be yeah
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	cos i mean er as as i
S0012	well it's not just broccoli it's all green food
S0013	yeah
S0012	all green food have get these these er
S0008	whatever they be
S0012	radical whatever they be
S0013	oh
S0008	this conversation's a bite like i've be listen to this series call erm understand the cosmos or something
S0013	oh yeah yeah
S0008	and that's on radio four extra and it be at quarter to no quarter past two or something and it be just fifteen minutes and there be this woman scientist she be go through astronomy you know right from the early stag and the different eras when different things be discover about the solar system and the galaxy and stuff like that
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then i mean this be in about thirty four part right and er i sort of pick up on one or two of them and they're so interest they really be
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	and then she's sort of get on to this thing about er you know quite a recent discoveries and like all the major discoveries have be do in a sort of the last fifty years and every sort of five years they have some other major you know
S0012	yeah like a star blow up or something
S0008	well no no no a major idea because all the ideas sort of like this sort of things that don't quite work unless someone go away and think about it for five years and someone would come out and explain why that
S0012	yeah didn't work
S0008	actually didn't yeah that doesn't and er they be sort of talk about how you know the origins of the universe
S0012	yeah
S0008	and what happen and you know how how galaxies be make and how star be make in galaxies and then what happen with star you know when they sort of the life story of a star and why some star do one thing and some star do another thing and then what happen after that you know and what black hole be and how black hole occur
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and then they be talk about dark matter and all these sort of things you've hear of but you've get no idea what they be
S0012	no that's right yeah
S0008	and the she explain it so well
S0012	do she yeah
S0008	that you could listen to fifteen minutes of her talk and think oh that be so interest
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and then you start tell someone about it and as soon as you try and describe it you've forget it
S0012	that's it yeah
S0008	you know what i mean
S0013	yeah it's a shame
S0008	you know you understand it for fifteen minutes
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	but it's it's translate it again isn't it
S0008	that's right yeah
S0012	they they have a programme with dara o'briain and that er
S0008	oh that mathematics thing
S0013	brian cox
S0012	yeah well i not just that brian cox and dara o'briain they're both you know their head be just just just elsewhere they're so fantastically brilliant
S0013	yeah star gaze or something
S0012	and when star gaze it be call that's right it's a programme one the television that that be call star gaze and they show you all the different constellations and everything where to look at how to find them and and you know what sort of gear you need to see the stuff really really good that it it's really interest and er they just blind you with science
S0008	mm
S0012	because they know so much i mean but they do that be explain really really well and you think oh yeah oh right and then when that's finish you go what do he say
S0008	mm
S0012	i mean that be all about black hole form and er white star and black star
S0008	dark star yeah
S0012	black dark star
S0008	this be what they er a bite about the life and death of the star right there be a a basically a star be just helium right
S0012	that's it yeah
S0008	and helium burn and form hydrogen or some process go through it
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	so all you get in the universe basically be helium and hydrogen that's all you've get to start with
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then these star keep go until all the helium be use up and then what happen be the hydrogen then star react with something else
S0012	yeah
S0008	and use itself up and form carbon and iron right and then all of the all of this sort of cos this this star's basically a huge gaseous
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	massive you know amount of matter in it
S0012	yeah
S0008	and but it start recede and recede and recede and all this whatever hydrogen stuff and it's all convert into carbon and iron and stuff and then that get blow off and then you end up with just a metal core
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	right an iron core and that's a dark star right and then they be say that some star be so massive right that this iron core be basically unstable right and it collapse in on itself under its own gravity
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then it form these
S0012	it's so dense
S0008	it form these er er sort of nuclear nuclear sort of er well it's like an explosion right
S0012	yeah
S0008	and these things explode in this phenomenal supernova right
S0012	yeah
S0008	and during that process all the other elements in the universe be form like gold nickel copper
S0012	yeah
S0013	ah
S0008	cos like when you think about like any element be basically a nucleus with electrons go round it
S0012	yeah that's right yeah
S0008	and whatever you know and it depend on how many electrons it's get to what metal it be
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	or what what substance be it right well i suppose they're all metal to start with aren't they
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and er of course during the course of this massive nuclear reaction during this supernova like all these all this hydrogen be convert to all these other things or the or the iron be convert to all these other elements and then they just get spray out all over the universe
S0012	that's god sneeze
S0008	right
S0008	and and they be say that every bite of gold you know that you own like a gold ring be once part of a supernova
S0012	yeah oh wow yeah
S0008	you know billions of years ago somewhere in space
S0012	wow
S0008	make you think doesn't it
S0012	it do make you think yeah yeah course gold be the only metal
S0013	but they mine it out the grind don't they
S0008	yeah but that's only cos it's come together on the planet you see see planets be different from star
S0012	yeah
S0008	they're form by there's all this dust fly around in nebula right where you hear about like the horse head nebula
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	they do this thing you know they go on erm hubble photograph or something like that
S0012	yeah that's brilliant isn't it
S0008	fantastic photograph of these nebula and stuff
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	and like that milky way be a nebula as well
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and it's basically just a load of infinitely small part of dust and all sort of stuff just drift around and it get in this sort of gravitational field and slowly you get it coalesce right
S0012	yeah
S0008	and as it coalesce it build up its centre of gravity more and more which mean it drag other stuff into it and and eventually it become a planet you know with just make out of dust in space and the bigger it get the more it start pull it in
S0012	yeah no they they be
S0008	i mean that's i mean you know i'm probably talk a load of bollocks but that be basically
S0012	yeah what it's all about
S0013	yeah
S0008	sort of like the
S0013	you remember that quite well
S0008	the the idea of what happen you know
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and there's other force involve as well obviously and then you see you get a black hole be basically you know if you if you get one atom of what helium or something like that you get a nucleus there
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then an electron
S0012	go round it
S0008	go round with that that much space between and what happen if that electron go
S0012	crash in yeah
S0008	into the nuclei you get this incredibly dense
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know you you can sort of compress everything to an incredibly dense object that's get it's so dense and so small but it's get a huge gravitational force
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and of course it then suck all this other stuff in because it's get such a high gravitational force
S0012	yeah
S0008	and it sort of all all the stuff collapse into this really really really dense centre which make an even greater force you know what i mean
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	and it's suck stuff in all the time and you know and become more and more powerful
S0012	that's right yeah but er when we when we be at school i mean i'm talk yonks ago now our science teacher be very good at that sort of thing and he actually there be a just this tiny about as big as your fingernail tiniest bite of material i don't know what it be to this very day i don't know what it be but he have all these bits of material and he like they get bigger and bigger and bigger right
S0008	mm
S0012	and he say which do you think be the heaviest
S0008	mm
S0012	and you could see like a house brick right well that's heavy you know but it go down to this little tiny piece of stuff and you couldn't lift it with two finger you you know you'd have to have something to get underneath it and and lift it up god know what it be but er ah he be a brilliant science teacher mind you he do he do blow up the he he do blow up the the classroom but he be he be really good mr his name be
S0008	the thing be though be that the amaze thing be be that when we go to school and learn about things like that people didn't know nothing
S0012	no we know nothing no
S0008	they didn't know nothing the teachers you know even the highest train teachers didn't know anything
S0012	well yeah
S0008	and they'd teach you stuff and of course it wasn't till like fred hoyle come in and start
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	work out all these in like in the sort of seventies and stuff sixties seventies
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then people since then you know like i mean the the knowledge curve have sort of go
S0012	well it have hasn't it yeah
S0008	you know like gradual and then suddenly shoot up like
S0012	yeah
S0008	with these new of course with the space telescope and things
S0012	they're fantastic
S0008	you know and these new telescope they get these er what do you call them electric electronic telescope
S0012	yeah they can see right out of that's fantastic innit er but what they do on this programme be they've get infrared telescope ultraviolet telescope and a and another type of telescope and you see all these things in different how they be then they blend them together and that be fantastic cos the the stuff that they you could see be fantastic and this be a star multimillion mile light years away
S0008	yeah that's right
S0012	but because they've get all this this this different er ways of look
S0008	well that's a lot of these things you can only see on on ultraviolet or infrared or whatever
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	you can't see them on ordinary
S0012	no no you can't no
S0008	and it's the same with the radio telescope i mean they're
S0012	that's right
S0008	they set them up in a massive array don't they
S0012	yeah they do yeah
S0008	and like it's not just one build it's like they're dot in a sort of like ten kilometre circle
S0012	that's right
S0008	and they're each go up and get radio wave and then combine it
S0012	but that they get them in chile in in australia all on these big highest mountains they get
S0008	mm
S0012	load and load i don't know how many but load of all these different all all follow the same
S0008	yeah
S0012	track and look at the same thing
S0008	they're not
S0012	and they're not look at a supernova that be due to happen at any time
S0008	yeah
S0012	and then they're hop to catch the actual supernova which will cos they're no change in colour the whole lot be just well light years away but
S0008	yeah yeah
S0012	they find it
S0013	yeah
S0008	but it's you know but like i say this be so interest but like i say it's difficult to keep it in your head
S0012	that be difficult to keep in your head
S0008	it's so you know it's so
S0013	yeah
S0012	especially at our age
S0008	well it's so so erm
S0013	no for anyone i reckon
S0012	well i don't know
S0008	yeah cos it's so mind boggle
S0013	otherwise you'd be an expert wouldn't you in the begin
S0008	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	i mean it's so mind boggle really
S0013	that be isn't it
S0008	you know cos they you know the thing be you think oh i understand that i think i and then they say and that's forty million light years away
S0012	yeah what
S0008	you start think about that and you think ah i've forget already
S0012	yeah
S0008	if it's something in your hand you can understand it but when they talk about light years
S0012	that's right
S0008	and billions of light years
S0012	and when you think of what space be what be it
S0008	yeah
S0012	be there any begin or any end
S0008	no this be it
S0012	there can't be can it
S0008	the big the big question innit what be there before the big bang
S0013	mm
S0012	well something be there before the big bang have to be
S0008	well not necessarily cos they reckon
S0012	yeah but they be
S0008	in in the big bang you create a load of positive mass and a load of negative mass right
S0012	yeah but there have to be some whole
S0008	and if you put them together there'd be nothing leave right it's it's like if if you if you dig a hole in the garden you create say that's the big bang you create all the earth you've take out in the hole
S0012	yeah
S0008	right so you think well there's two things be create but then you haven't create anything because if you put the earth back in the hole there's nothing there again
S0012	no that's right but the
S0012	when you when you talk about nothing
S0013	mm
S0012	er there's nothing it's it's too hard to contemplate there's there's
S0008	yeah
S0012	get to be something to bring the nothings together there's get to be something
S0008	well that's right i mean it's sort of like it's more difficult to er comprehend than be there a god
S0012	well yeah
S0008	well no it's easier to comprehend than be there a god cos
S0012	well that's just a belief
S0013	i don't know it's all connect isn't it
S0008	it's this be why people create god didn't they
S0013	it really be all connect
S0012	yeah it's all connect
S0008	cos they cos they want something to be in charge
S0013	mm
S0012	they want some
S0008	and some reason
S0012	somebody must have make it you see
S0008	mm
S0012	but when that come to somebody must have make that who make the somebody who make it
S0008	right that's right i mean this be the question what what be before the big bang and where do god come from
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	who create god
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos he couldn't have always be there but that's the answer you get innit
S0012	yeah yeah i mean when you when you think of it and go really deep into it that's just impossible to really understand innit
S0013	yeah
S0008	well for the like of us probably
S0012	well for the like of everybody they're just all they're all they're come up with be theory theory theory theory nobody
S0008	well no cos they do prove it occasionally don't they
S0012	yeah they prove but they can't prove at what really really happen what happen before the big bang and all that
S0008	no
S0012	there's no proof there
S0008	yeah but they're they're get
S0013	where do the star come from before they
S0008	they're work
S0012	yeah
S0008	they're work down to it aren't they
S0012	yeah
S0008	that's what they're work towards
S0012	they're very clever people
S0008	they be
S0012	very clever people i mean they
S0008	they you see they but like i say they spend like a lifetime
S0012	do it yeah
S0008	work on one little aspect
S0012	work it out yeah
S0008	and they know everything about it and they've work it all out in their head and they sort of
S0012	that's right
S0008	i mean it would be a real bugger if someone come along and say oh sorry i've just prove you wrong
S0008	oh my lifetime's work
S0008	which must happen
S0012	that's gotta happen well it do happen once or twice didn't it i mean
S0008	yeah
S0012	that's somebody try to prove einstein's theory wrong didn't they but i mean that that can't be
S0008	well i don't think they try to prove it wrong but they sort of like
S0012	well they didn't prove it
S0008	it open up a lot of erm possibilities which aren't cater for in the theories
S0012	in the theory yeah
S0008	and then they try and fit these you know
S0012	things altogether
S0008	you know other fit it altogether and then suddenly find see this be how you progress in astronomy and nuclear physics or anything or
S0012	well yes yeah
S0008	anything like that be that something'll be accept and it'll be accept for several years you know
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	and all the time there's people beaver away try to prove something
S0013	yeah
S0008	connect to it how they're try to fit it in
S0013	that's right yeah
S0008	and then they cos this be the thing with fred hoyle's theory about er the the er nuclei in star and stuff like this
S0012	yeah
S0008	which sort out a lot of stuff and er his theories be accept for age but there be something he say well someone work out how much carbon there be in the in the er galaxy
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er god know how
S0008	and er then this the amount of carbon be much too much to be associate
S0012	with
S0008	with the original ideas fred hoyle's ideas right
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and so he this guy you know he sort of like bug him and he be sort of work on this for about god know how many years
S0012	years yeah
S0008	and then he come up with this supernova idea which then explain which agree with fred hoyle
S0012	yeah
S0008	up to a point but say that okay this his happen but if it's too big then it create supernova and this be what create all the carbon
S0012	yeah
S0008	you see
S0012	oh i see yeah yeah
S0008	cos it cos you know no one could have an idea that you know sort out everything
S0012	no no that's true
S0008	you know you can only sort out one little bite and er
S0013	yeah
S0008	it's like the light theory isn't it
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	about whether it's a wave or a or a pulse
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	and er then they come up to say it's a pulse work in a wave
S0012	yeah
S0008	but you know someone come up and sort that out eventually if they haven't already do so
S0012	well they will yeah yeah but the nice thing about all this science stuff and and they there be scientists from all over the world work together on things aren't they
S0008	yeah
S0012	i mean they're all collaborate
S0008	yeah course they be
S0012	and they never use to do they
S0012	it use to be
S0008	well i suppose there's
S0012	a pocket of scientists
S0008	it's so expensive now that they have to sort of like utilise what they can
S0012	they have to collaborate yeah yeah that's fantastic i mean the russian scientists and the american scientists work together
S0008	sometimes
S0012	well lot of the time you know i mean
S0008	yeah
S0012	but it's only the politicians that be not work together
S0008	yeah
S0012	and that's awful when politics come into it that's that become stupid
S0013	mm
S0012	what be you look at your foot for
S0008	what
S0012	what be you look at your foot for
S0008	dunno i just
S0013	why not
S0008	yeah
S0012	yeah it's a funny old funny old world but there you go it's all about me so
S0008	yeah yeah yeah don't need to don't need to
S0012	i'm just trundle along in my little way
S0008	don't need to affect us at all do it
S0012	no no
S0013	mm
S0012	as long as we can go from a to b and work out bits and piece how to get there we all finish up in the same place don't we
S0008	er
S0013	oh
S0012	it don't matter what we all finish up in the same place we'll all be dig up and treat as kings one day
S0008	not if you're burn to cinders

S0008	and you think well you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they you know they be okay
S0012	they be okay yeah but er
S0008	like it's sort of like
S0012	the picture they show you first you know when when the actual er programme start they show you all these different picture of and what and some of them picture be brilliant but none of them do that none of them do the picture that they sort of skim through in the first instance
S0008	no i i never see the begin of it so
S0012	don't you no
S0013	yeah
S0008	no but the er i mean they're sort of quite clever aren't they or they're all pretty clever but
S0013	oh yeah
S0012	they're all quite clever yeah
S0008	and fact in fact the
S0013	it's the time isn't it that's
S0012	the old girl have to leave yesterday didn't she
S0008	yeah but she have a technique she use and she never change right through the programme do she
S0012	she never change do she no
S0008	she always do it in the same sort of like you know sort of calypso type
S0012	that's it yeah
S0008	thing you know with all the colour and stuff and
S0012	i like that young girl
S0008	which one
S0012	the young girl with the long hair
S0008	yeah well
S0012	she's she's different
S0008	her and the other the really short one
S0012	yeah
S0008	they're the only two i reckon who have get natural talent
S0012	that's it yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0008	they get natural talent but lack in technique
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	whereas the bald bloke be
S0012	he's get the technique
S0008	be he ex army
S0012	yeah
S0008	i mean he could make a live do
S0012	course he could
S0008	norfolk coast paint
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know work to the same formula
S0012	all the time yeah
S0008	flash them out cos he's quite he's get quite a good technique and he know what he's do and stuff like that
S0012	yeah
S0008	but you're he seem to be lack in any sort of er
S0012	ideas really and you know
S0008	any sort of freedom of expression
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	which could be cos he's out of the army
S0012	well that's right he he's too
S0008	and the and the other bloke the er glaswegian guy
S0012	oh yeah
S0008	be he glaswegian
S0012	well he's scottish anyway
S0008	yeah i reckon that he's he's get a talent but he's too loose with it he you know what i mean
S0012	yeah i know what you mean yeah
S0008	he's get a natural talent but he doesn't believe in learn a technique or do anything he's just like determine to i'll do it my way
S0012	no yeah
S0008	no matter how crap it be
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and he hasn't get any control over what he do and he's produce some real rubbish paint
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you know for every one good one he have he have like one rubbish one
S0012	that's right that's like that young girl when she wouldn't change and then all of a sudden she change didn't she
S0008	yeah
S0012	and she listen to what they be talk about and listen to what they say and she decide suddenly to do something totally different to what she
S0008	yeah
S0012	usually do and they all like that they really like that
S0008	and she hasn't she hasn't the one with the frizzy hair hasn't actually have any disasters really
S0012	no she hasn't she's be good hasn't she
S0008	she's sort of like some of them have be sort of average but
S0012	yeah
S0008	none of them really bad
S0012	no
S0008	and some of them quite good i think if i buy a paint off any of them i'd buy one of hers
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know cos she
S0012	yeah she's good
S0013	i like the way she use colour
S0012	yeah and also she's get sort of impressionistic
S0008	she have hasn't she yeah
S0012	very impressionistic
S0008	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0008	but it's quite interest the programme cos the
S0013	mm
S0008	the woman artist the the the one who judge

S0013	terrible wannit
S0008	that's right i mean it be it be all suppose to be you know like i say you know
S0012	how people talk but now they didn't talk like he do
S0013	no
S0012	he be that be just awful
S0013	it be horrible wasn't he
S0012	yeah
S0008	but people use to love it didn't they
S0012	they do yeah
S0008	cos they didn't realise that it be
S0012	till death do us part
S0013	that's it
S0008	yeah
S0013	ah good
S0012	yeah that just come poof things things do though they leave your head for age and then come back again when
S0012	one day when you're not think about it yeah that be a terrible programme but we we
S0008	they couldn't show it now could they
S0012	no they'd never be able to show that now would they oh that be so racist
S0008	and someone get castigate for call someone colour instead of call them black
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	like you think it's the worst thing you could ever call anyone i didn't even know that colour wasn't you know allow any more
S0012	no i didn't
S0008	but you have to call people black even if they're only brown
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	why

S0012	i prefer the colour one i mean
S0008	what's his name cumberbag batch
S0012	oh yeah
S0008	get into
S0012	he get
S0008	awful trouble didn't he for
S0012	yeah for call them colour
S0008	talk about his colour friends or something
S0012	who who decide that it's wrong
S0008	i don't know
S0012	some idiot want p
S0008	cos at one time you couldn't call people black could you
S0012	no you couldn't
S0008	until you then have that sort of like it then become acceptable didn't it
S0012	yeah i that seem so ridiculous to me i mean you can't call a pakistani or an indian bloke black can you
S0008	no
S0012	he's not black you can't call a chinese bloke black he's colour
S0008	yeah but i suppose i don't know about this
S0013	if you know where they come from you're fine aren't you no problem then
S0008	see if it's a the trouble be be that the trouble be be that a you know you're sort of work on the principle that you know you don't know whether people will take offence aren't you
S0012	it's alright if you call them chinese
S0013	well i mean there be a there be a black bloke on there the other day he he use to be in well he's be in load and load of of program with that richard beckinsale can you remember him
S0008	yeah yeah yeah i know him he's on
S0013	he be in that one
S0008	death in paradise isn't he
S0013	yeah and he's in death in paradise yeah
S0012	and he be say so what if they call me colour
S0008	mm
S0012	what cos he he talk rather with a a posh accent doesn't he
S0008	that's right he's get a very posh accent
S0012	he really he's really he be really good really posh
S0008	mm
S0012	and he he say i i don't see the problem
S0008	mm
S0012	i mean okay but he's say
S0008	i be black but trouble be you see be that it's not him it's like if you go around somebody a black person or a group of or a type of person like say from some of the american state
S0012	yeah well that's the way it work
S0008	might take colour as a as a really derogatory term you see
S0012	yes yeah
S0008	and it's like if you in the er if you're in the southern state you can't call anyone boy can you
S0012	no
S0008	you know like here you say you alright boy
S0012	yeah that's it yeah well it's
S0008	right you do that in america you'd get shoot
S0012	that's yeah
S0008	you know cos it's the er
S0012	yeah
S0008	the the slave master use to call the slave boy
S0012	boys yeah
S0013	yeah
S0008	no matter who they be they be just boy
S0012	and that's what some of these erm sheriffs in the southern state still call them
S0008	still do yeah that's right yeah
S0012	they still call them you know this this
S0008	it's like a sign of like real negativity
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	and look down on them
S0008	you know talk from a superior stand
S0012	yeah
S0008	and but i mean it's like a minefield isn't it
S0012	it be you don't know where you stand nowadays to be honest with you do you
S0008	yeah
S0012	it's best just to keep out of the whole lot
S0008	but even then you see if you call a welshman taffy do they take offence at that
S0012	well that's right
