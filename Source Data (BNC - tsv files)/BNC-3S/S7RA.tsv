S0278	yes he do yeah yeah well i be just tell what you what he's think of now be he say that do you know what i might do he say i might have another one make just on on a square board but a red brick one cos that have to be change and send it to to get a greyscale i can't
S0012	oh right
S0278	i send it to and it you know it come back in about thirty second there you go dad

S0013	that be lovely
S0278	i be chuff with it it's a nice finish and also i think he he like the erm that matt finish make it rather than a gloss
S0012	gloss be awful though
S0278	yeah it's awful yeah although some things and what i discover with and i've work out how to do hand paint it come to me on the way back
S0012	yeah
S0278	because the problem be right if you well the first difficult bite be to get a really good board and i think it have to be apply cos if you you won't get timber but enough to last without
S0012	no you need outside ply
S0278	outside ply so i need to and i've get lot of that i've get that leave leave from the from the back of the van
S0012	yeah
S0278	that's really its be in the back of the van for years and it's tough old stuff
S0012	it be
S0278	yeah and few coat of primer on that sand down erm and then i've get all this old vinyl which doesn't stick terribly well so shouldn't use for sign and i have a facility i can cut mirror
S0012	oh can you
S0278	mirror cut
S0013	you can cut what
S0278	mirror

S0013	ah
S0278	i draft what i want tell the machine to cut it a mirror image
S0013	yeah
S0278	and then it'll cut the mirror image and there and then the adhesive be look up
S0012	yeah
S0278	so you just tape it on the side
S0012	oh i see yeah yeah
S0013	okay
S0278	quick waft over with a primer
S0012	yeah
S0278	lift off what you've tap on and you've get your image ready to paint
S0013	ah
S0278	it's all draft for you that that's the difficult bite be get it draft actually paint be really satisfy and the fun bite
S0013	right yeah
S0278	what take the time be the layout
S0013	yes
S0278	and get what you want so now you you say how do you can send that i can send that do that digitally say be that alright and that this be something cos i i if we be open the church

S0013	yeah
S0278	that's that's six hours innit
S0012	that be six hours
S0278	six hours and no one's volunteer to do it
S0013	you get many people go in
S0278	don't know oh they do
S0013	they do oh
S0278	on a wednesday on a wednesday when the boys be there erm oh they quite often have people visit there
S0013	oh good that's good
S0278	i don't think they actually supervise it they're busy round the back and stuff could disappear out the front where
S0012	i will have one
S0013	tea
S0278	so i can see i'm gonna be do it but i that doesn't matter if i can if i've get something i can get on with
S0012	no no
S0278	it doesn't matter at all
S0012	no you're very good at
S0278	erm 's 's always work on a saturday and a sunday anyway
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm so that's
S0012	well you're very artistic so you you should be able to
S0278	well that's what i always really want to do
S0012	yeah
S0278	but it take too long you can't
S0012	i know it do but i mean you have to have a little bite of patience and if you're sit down there for age
S0278	mm well i get one potential customer already cos erm a lady phone me up something do i tell you
S0012	no
S0278	well somebody erm from near
S0012	yeah
S0278	and erm so well no she didn't phone she send an email say i'm a friend of 's and
S0012	oh yes you do say yeah
S0278	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm so if she doesn't find anybody to do it at a sensible price for her i've say look later on in the year when i've get the end of june it quieten down a bite
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm and then i'd be happy to have a go for you cos i use to do this many moon ago and i say you don't sound that old
S0278	so erm i erm erm so she might come back you see but i've i've already the plan be already there it suddenly come to me about this mirror image cos the problem be you don't want adhesive on the back
S0012	no you don't no
S0278	with that would spoil the other surface but if you then cut the mirror image you can turn it on its back and you've get the right image oh i tell you what you haven't get you can hold the middle together that doesn't matter you won't need the middle
S0012	no
S0278	you won't need the middle oh yes you will but ah
S0012	yes you will yeah
S0278	yes you will ah ha right
S0012	mm
S0278	mm
S0012	well what about
S0278	no you don't need the middle because you can get all the widths and everything and everything er i just can't spray it i tell you what i could do i could make it look a stencil type thing sort of hold the middle in and just paint over it
S0012	yeah
S0278	that's it
S0012	yeah
S0278	that's fine
S0012	you could
S0278	so i just where there's a middle i just add a little bits add little bits on so that when i spray i've still get roughly the shape and i yeah that's fine
S0012	yeah
S0278	yeah that doesn't matter cos the paint i use it er will be use be call one shoot
S0012	yeah
S0278	very expensive for a small tin but it that's a one coat cover of anything
S0012	yeah
S0278	it's real it's it's it's only for sign makers
S0012	yeah
S0278	and i think the way i'll start with well no see it doesn't matter whichever way you go you're go to end up with quite a bite of paint but but they're only in little tin
S0012	yeah what like in the little jet tin
S0278	then they do no they're a bite bigger
S0012	oh be they
S0278	er four fifty mil i think
S0012	oh right
S0278	yeah erm but they do a special primer special undercoat but it's all it all the whole thing be a whole
S0012	it's a package yeah
S0278	erm and then i know then that that paint will flow out modern paint you buy doesn't flow out
S0012	no
S0278	it it doesn't so i can get and there be special ones for the preparation bite
S0012	yeah what about clean your brush do you have to use anything special for that
S0278	white spirit
S0012	white spirit
S0278	yeah
S0012	oh that's alright then white spirit
S0278	mm yeah it's all all all there
S0012	cos there be lot of stuff you you or some stuff
S0278	stuff like that
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm yeah so that that's quite encourage i think but there's also a bundle of all my paperwork be sort down there and do it
S0012	yeah
S0278	then i'm stick there i can't do anything else can i
S0012	course you can't
S0278	can do that thank you
S0013	yeah might be good for you
S0278	might be good for me yeah
S0013	but you can't take too much paperwork though can you
S0278	but it's a lot
S0012	do you get an email from
S0278	no
S0012	the not not

S0012	big tall
S0012	yes
S0278	oh oh that yeah yeah
S0012	do you get one
S0278	no
S0012	oh cos he's ask for volunteer for the world festival on the gate we do it last year didn't we
S0013	i didn't know we'd ask yeah we do it last year
S0012	yeah
S0278	oh no no
S0013	have you volunteer then
S0012	i haven't yet no
S0278	all i'm all i'm all i'm gonna i must have a word with erm cos we be we be gonna have the bell ringers in on the saturday
S0012	yeah
S0278	i think that'll be good that erm if he's happy that cos he say yes it's fine as long as you're as long as you're in the erm
S0013	be you allow half
S0278	no not biscuits i have a bite of cake bite of cake
S0012	you're not allow cake that's even more sugar than biscuits we've get no cake anyway have we
S0278	mm
S0013	no we're out of cake at the moment
S0278	so anyway
S0012	you can't have your cake and eat it can you
S0278	no
S0013	that be worse
S0278	erm what will be he say yes it's fine in the church
S0012	yeah
S0278	but we've get events happen in the church but we just have to work round that and erm it it doesn't kind of work have er remember when they have it in her video run it doesn't it doesn't work with other in a church it just some people want it to be quiet in a church and
S0012	that's yeah that's true
S0278	and video doesn't really work it didn't belong in a church so
S0012	when we have a we have a video run didn't we about er about the whole
S0013	that's well
S0278	well well yes that's what it's for
S0012	yeah
S0278	and it i felt it didn't really work do it
S0278	it keep
S0013	no
S0278	you've gotta keep stop and start it and then people who be in there see it over and over and over again
S0013	mm
S0278	it doesn't really work that but anyhow erm i think if they if we do four little four little spell throughout the afternoon but what'd be nice be if he could spare six ticket for six armbands for the people who be play the bell
S0012	mm
S0278	then they probably play the bell for nothing you see
S0012	oh yeah
S0278	erm and that would all help it all go it's all towards the tower fund
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0278	and then i've get the make i'm gonna make have i tell you what i'm gonna make
S0013	mm
S0278	make a tower with the look at
S0012	mm
S0278	from the end with with the shape of the church
S0012	yeah
S0278	behind with information on it about
S0012	yeah
S0278	about it and you could put money on coin and lift a lift a flap that will ring a bell if you put put the biggest bell be the one if you put a note in
S0012	oh
S0278	you put put well well my theory
S0012	yeah but will people want to know that they're
S0013	how be you gonna work that
S0012	will they really want to know that some they're put a penny in
S0013	yeah
S0012	they're put a
S0013	no don't do that
S0012	twenty pence in or
S0278	just all the same bell it bring the same
S0013	that'd be so embarrass
S0012	the same bell
S0278	it bring the same bell
S0012	yeah if you have a if you have a pound let ding ding ding
S0278	no no no just that i be gonna have one alright no that's fine so er
S0013	but i suppose if you put in a load of coin it would load tuppences will it go ding ding ding ding ding
S0278	well somehow i've gotta build a flap so that when they put it in put it in a flap and it's when they
S0012	mm
S0278	when they pull on it on the button erm then that'll pull a piece of string as well and it drop through it to the bottom and go
S0012	yeah
S0278	i'm not quite sure how to do that yep but i'm sure i will think about it
S0013	mm
S0278	erm it won't take long to make it and it just the information we need to raise so and so and have a thermometer because we've get i think we've get twenty something thousand save towards it
S0012	have you
S0013	yeah
S0278	i'm i'm guess now something like that but that be ring fence it can't be people have give it for the tower
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	but we've also get money in a fabric fund which erm be just from normal fund that be come we put it in maintain
S0012	what be that er tower that that we be it the natural one or the one
S0012	that be the tower wasn't it
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah i
S0278	well we'll see i doubt we'll get much but anything help erm you've gotta show that you're fundraise as well because
S0012	well of course you have
S0278	everything
S0013	but i remember
S0012	but it's also in the interest of the church the diocese and and the whole community and people who be interest in church cos that's
S0278	yeah
S0012	that's a really brilliant church innit
S0278	beautiful church yeah the last chap i show round be that the one then no that one no the last open i open the door and he walk he say wow he say i see why you keep this one lock
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	erm and erm then the people i take round in october if you look on erm the church i think it's the church's website
S0012	yeah yeah
S0278	they they they put all their stuff they work for church they never let on
S0013	right
S0012	oh right
S0278	they never let on and erm they so they say we we have visit once before and couldn't get in and this time there be a list of number and we phone the number first on the list and i think we must have wake him up
S0013	yeah
S0278	it's a erm because he he didn't wasn't couldn't grasp what we be try to ask or something and then he go on and then they they've get wonderful picture of the church and a lovely write up and then we bid farewell with a friendly wave you know and and that's that's nice you you can see it i think it's the church one
S0012	yeah
S0013	okay
S0278	and then next in july we've get sixty people come from the oh that's the church it's not the round it's a lady from the round tower society but she's just bring the church people around
S0012	oh right yeah
S0278	and she's do three church locally
S0012	mm
S0013	mm
S0278	she's do and
S0012	
S0278	no
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm so and she say what be good about what we do for you cos i haven't twig it be that you'll get a lot of money from it
S0278	so you'll need a bigger collection box than you've get there we've get a little one there so
S0012	yeah
S0278	so i'm look i've be look on ebay for an old collection box
S0012	yeah
S0278	and they go for a load of money
S0012	they do they do
S0278	i might have to make one
S0012	yeah
S0278	you know or if you've get any idea if you've get a whole box of make look might have to make one
S0013	you can make things look old can't you erm
S0278	but the other thing be you see you can't you can't screw it on anything so i think it'll need something like a bite of wire come out the bottom and just sort of go round the bottom of something round hook it onto a pew or something funny
S0012	yeah yeah
S0013	why you mean you can't trust
S0278	it need to be fix
S0012	well you can't trust people how we have our stuff nick just outside
S0278	oh no you couldn't just leave them you couldn't just leave the box
S0013	mm
S0278	erm
S0012	well have our our stuff nick outside we you know
S0278	yeah you say
S0012	yeah
S0013	remember when eh sometimes these erm
S0278	that's why you have to wasn't it
S0012	that's right
S0278	mm
S0012	yeah
S0013	these church and that and castle even they have what an honesty box don't they right
S0278	yeah
S0012	yeah but it's usually cement to the post
S0013	wait a minute it's in stone
S0012	yeah
S0278	mm
S0013	so your hole go in in the stone
S0012	that's right it do yeah
S0278	mm
S0013	mm
S0278	that's it tube get me think now
S0013	and they it look part of the er
S0278	or something that wouldn't upset anybody go down the tube and do it
S0012	mm mm
S0278	and then i get in trouble for put the those sign up about the fire exit
S0012	do you
S0278	yeah
S0012	what for
S0278	it's not suppose to put anything on doors cos the door's old and and what they recommend be you put it on a stand by the door and what a load of rubbish cos people just move it and stuff stuff up against it when they
S0012	of course they do yeah
S0013	mm
S0278	can't be moveable if it say fire exit keep clear so i just do it i well i do it i be tell i couldn't do it and i do it i get the hump
S0012	yeah
S0278	and i think well it look you can't have a pay event in a place without people know how to get out
S0012	yeah
S0278	so i
S0012	unless you have an airline host
S0278	do the bite
S0278	yeah yeah no well also you've gotta tell them that the tower isn't an exit you don't want people fly in there and fall in a heap and find it
S0278	so i do do not suppose to have do it but then oh well we'll see how it go
S0013	yeah
S0012	well who tell you off then
S0278	well i be on the way there and i i i i bump into who's the other warden
S0012	mm
S0278	and i tell her what i be gonna do i say i've get some lovely little glass screw i think that would be the easiest way
S0012	yeah
S0278	just a little glass screw in the door erm and then all you've get to do be take it out and you can fill the hole
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm but you can't put you can't hammer or screw in anywhere without
S0013	yeah
S0278	cos it's a it's a list build so it's a
S0012	that be yeah
S0013	no you can't do it
S0012	yeah
S0278	same with a list house you can't do it
S0012	no
S0278	erm you can't do it erm so she say what about blu tack er no it won't stick with blu tack so in the end i'd use type double side tape which probably will make a mess of the door but it stick
S0012	yeah
S0278	it's not i haven't damage the wood it's more what's more important a door or the people in a property people be more important it
S0013	yeah but
S0278	health and safety the people be more important
S0012	well yeah when when health and safety that override most stuff health and safety
S0013	yeah
S0278	i would have think actually while i be do it i discover that if you if you be to run out if there be a fire and you end up in the in the erm the little vestry the door our from the vestry be about oh almost eighteen inch drop to to the grind level when you go out that door i think the first person'd fall over and the rest would land on top so be that's another job get to do be to
S0013	yeah
S0278	to put a step outside but that's outside you can do you can do it however you like it doesn't matter
S0012	yeah
S0278	but it's erm even that
S0012	but you what you need there be be well i suppose you'd have to have a permanent step
S0278	oh yeah well i've i've get a big old slab you know i use to have on my front door
S0012	yeah
S0278	i i need someone help me do 's gonna come round we're take it down there and then we just get load of old bricks and things he's find while he's clear up the
S0012	yeah
S0278	so they just build build a step in
S0013	mm
S0012	that shouldn't take long but with step in
S0278	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	i mean it would be nice if we have a great lump of stone that would match nicely
S0012	yeah
S0278	no one's gonna see you round there and it'll be quick quick to get it right
S0012	can't you take a lump of stone out of the tower
S0278	well i don't know you see that no one quite know what's what's underneath all that they've gotta redo the top third of the tower i don't know how they'll do it take it down and rebuild it it's all drop out and it's all get to be lime mortar which mean that you can only do it when it's dry
S0012	yep yep but you see that mould you see with everything
S0278	yeah
S0012	lime mortar's one of the best i mean they supply these
S0278	it's soft that's why
S0012	these old cottages have stand for hundreds of years
S0278	yeah yeah yeah
S0012	i mean
S0278	yeah
S0012	the rough line'll go like that but they're still stand
S0278	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	you know they're
S0278	wall wall be way thicker than they start off at the bottom aren't they
S0012	yeah yeah they're
S0012	yeah
S0278	i can understand why they do what it what it be that if you if that be a house you'd have to go to a government organisation to get permission to do stuff to it
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	erm but the church because we've get so many old build they're nearly all old
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah course they be
S0278	have permission to do it and they it a faculty rather than a plan permission to do it
S0012	yeah
S0278	and so they have to stick to the same rule otherwise that privilege of be able to decide themselves whether the could do something
S0013	yeah
S0278	will be take away and then everything'll take
S0013	that's true
S0278	even longer it take long enough as it be
S0012	it do doesn't it yeah
S0278	to try and keep things right otherwise you'd have all sort of funny things that go on wouldn't you
S0012	you would you would yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	yeah now apparently one of the major things that people nick be erm uncarved wooden storage box old ones
S0012	really
S0278	old oak yeah the really old things that maybe store candle erm
S0012	oh i see
S0278	cloth stuff like that you know like like a big ottoman that that's the one of the major things people nick
S0012	that must be these er these people that know about these things
S0278	mm
S0013	yeah
S0012	you know a gang of them go round and
S0278	well it'd be it'd be easy for a gang to go in pose with cameras and things even while someone be look after the place
S0012	yeah
S0278	and they wonder round and when they've go you find all the well i've also just discover read up i be look at the wrong erm insurance company i think we we're ecclesiastical we're not we're church something insurance er well both of them recommend you don't leave small brass items about
S0012	no
S0278	and you definitely don't leave candle or anything that would start a fire so and they preferably shouldn't even be leave on the premise
S0012	yeah
S0278	but so i'm gonna take them and put them in the er erm vestry
S0013	vestry
S0012	yeah
S0278	make a box and they can all slide in the box and go
S0013	yeah
S0278	won't look as nice but then i can see it
S0013	yeah
S0278	because one of the place apparently that they they start fire under the organ under the
S0012	be it
S0278	oh imagine a load of candle under the pedal
S0012	yeah
S0278	that'd gather that wonderful old timber that
S0012	yeah
S0278	get go in no time wouldn't it
S0012	it would wouldn't it yeah
S0278	erm so
S0012	well they won't
S0278	a photograph i've have them all for all the photograph have do it all
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0278	but one one of the the paint you see as you go in the door dead ahead
S0012	mm mm
S0278	erm that one he just he just grab it lift it off the wall put it down by the lectern by the erm the fonts
S0012	yeah
S0278	to get the decent the sun be all wrong on it to get a good picture and just go up walk it up say that how easy it be to take that
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0278	just hang there the other one's the same
S0013	mm
S0278	it just hang but now we've get photograph
S0012	trouble be if it ain't easy what they do be cut it out the frame and nick the middle of it
S0278	well yeah
S0013	in fact you're not gonna stop anything be you
S0278	no if it's gonna happen if it's gonna happen it'll happen but what we have now
S0013	but just have to hope
S0278	the picture he's take be that quality that we could er we could replace it with a digital print
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm but there's but people want to see the original scene but if it do go then you could just have a digital print there that that and one with a the one over the lady say the little the little altar
S0012	mm
S0278	that erm that one have get a strange frame and he reckon that you you could just actually print the whole frame on it
S0012	yeah
S0278	and that'd be fine so so you could you could replace what it look like but not the real thing
S0012	yeah
S0013	not the same
S0012	not the real thing
S0278	i know but what do you do there's no point have a church not open
S0013	no
S0278	erm cos no one's get it then you know no one can use it
S0013	no
S0012	so
S0278	be there any security cameras

S0013	they're not that expensive now be they
S0012	no not the security cameras aren't no
S0013	cameras really
S0278	well you can get smart ever so cheap but but our insurance company erm doesn't reckon on it and then doesn't reduce the premium if you use it
S0012	no
S0013	you could have it just just
S0012	that's
S0013	just aim at the door so you know people in
S0278	so everyone
S0013	the people that
S0278	oh could just people come in

S0013	no
S0278	and cos it's all in little bits
S0013	well it's best not to buy
S0278	at least if it's a cake i've gotta think about the cake haven't i and cut it you don't just walk past it and
S0013	so you don't buy cake either
S0278	no it's only when i'm offer a cake
S0013	right that's okay
S0278	i have an awful one at the at the the national bell ringers thing i go to for look the cake there i think oh that look nice you see and i put it on we all have paper plat and as i'm look at it the fat be it's actually it's get a shiny finish to the plate it eat through that and it be spread out across but i say look at this we'd a lot of butter in that one

S0012	probably lard
S0278	it might well have be lard yeah it didn't taste that brilliant but i do eat it
S0012	yeah
S0278	so the bell ringing's the bell ringing's that i'm i'm feel more comfortable with it now i do i do wonder if i'd do the right thing to start with
S0012	yeah
S0278	don't think like it cos it mean that she's off on the friday on thursday and thursday and thursdays be practice you see
S0013	oh right
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0012	why don't she like it
S0278	well cos one she only get two nights off a week wednesday and thursday
S0013	yeah
S0278	and thursday i'm always away
S0013	out
S0012	oh i see yeah
S0278	but it's it be a night i i think probably for my old age it's a good thing cos you've get a you've get to be alert to do this you can't
S0012	well you've gotta keep your brainbox move
S0278	yeah you can't it it you can't relax for a minute if you relax for a minute or if you even think hey this be go well you've lose it
S0012	yeah
S0278	you'll have and my usual thing when i get lose be i actually cos i'm use to read on two line at the sing cos you've get the base clef and the treble clef
S0012	yep
S0278	i sometimes skip a line if it's all write on the one line
S0012	oh i see yeah yeah
S0278	you see it's it's tricky sometimes it's write on the one line and sometimes it's write on two line
S0013	yeah
S0278	depend on how many bell you've get
S0012	yeah
S0278	so i it it
S0013	mm
S0278	if i panic i get lose and if i think oh this be nice i get lose so you've gotta keep a balance in between
S0013	mm
S0278	you've gotta keep some try and keep smile but it's not easy cos you're concentrate like billio
S0013	yeah
S0278	but it do it be lovely
