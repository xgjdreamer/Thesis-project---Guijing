S0179	i'm honestly not sure i've never cook in anything like this before not with that amount of vegetables em alright i'd just keep stir it cos everything at the bottom will be cook so like eventually it'll be fine you just might want to cook it a little bite longer
S0058	alright it's on
S0179	eh
S0058	what be you do be you ring

S0058	bite ridiculous
S0179	well you've see our ridiculous wine glass of course no

S0179	well you can eat it if you want
S0179	i'm not sure if it's to be recommend however
S0056	but pub grub they probably will need a wash cos they they tend to get a bite of a
S0058	do you manage to get all the bits
S0056	yes
S0058	excellent oh nice guacamole
S0179	oh good choice of guacamole
S0058	i recommend it

S0179	oh i'll dump your shoe in thehallway em it's a pity you didn't get your ipod today i be eh hop you might
S0058	yeah never mind
S0179	oh i'm sorry i think it here
S0058	i i i'll give them a ring and just sort of find out what the thing
S0179	yeah
S0058	i mean to be honest em i'll just i'll i'll probably just em get them to deliver it to the store like l can go pick it up
S0179	of course yeah
S0058	which would be probably just as easy as you go to get it em
S0056	that look good
S0179	yeah
S0058	if they if they do it if not i'll just down to john lewis and pick one up straight away
S0056	and how long be the guarantee period with them
S0058	a year
S0056	oh right
S0058	but i figure like the service there be really good and if you do have any bother
S0056	yes
S0179	but i think it's really unlikely to break in that time period
S0058	oh no yeah exactly but i just it seem daft get the slightly less good deal if you can get a good deal
S0179	as in the reliability of ipods didn't use to be amaze but ever since ipad then everything's be superb
S0058	yeah
S0179	you know ever since
S0058	yeah i think my first one be older than any of the ones you've have wasn't it
S0179	yeah considerably
S0058	yeah yeah fair enough
S0179	cos mine be the first like the new nano be the first generation of what you might term new ipods i e colour screen
S0058	yes mine have a colour screen and be a photo
S0179	oh okay
S0058	that be the first big one with a colour screen so maybe they have bring the no no there be the mini first mine be the same time as the mini
S0179	yeah but the mini wasn't colour it be black and white
S0058	no no exactly
S0179	em mine actually hang on
S0056	mam say you can
S0179	you could buy mine at the same time as the mini
S0056	you can steam those a while if you want
S0058	hmm i think about put the lid on
S0179	cos i remember look at a mini and think
S0179	ooh i could get that oh i might snaffle that
S0058	you might snaffle what
S0179	some cheese
S0058	some cheese eh do we have a grater
S0056	yes they're up on the top shelf on the side here
S0179	oh great we've get a grater

S0179	that's leave
S0058	yep
S0056	that's it it's that little thing stick there we go
S0058	oh
S0056	that's it
S0058	ooh that be a grater
S0056	now you can grate however much you want into a little bowl or or even directly onto the food if if that's what you're gonna do
S0058	eh we'll have it in a bowl i think
S0179	yeah thank you make wrap be difficult enough give a
S0058	yeah it's don't want to complicate the matter
S0179	be there a microwave

S0058	that's good i don't know how you want to do the wrap do you want to

S0058	well i mean do you wanna do both pack or do you wanna do that pack for now and then see how we get on
S0179	no we need both pack
S0058	mm well we'll need at least
S0179	we get through one pack just us
S0058	but i mean do you want to do them all or do you want to keep some because i guess use we've use less than a full pack
S0056	we're not really gonna we're not really gonna eat fourteen wrap be we
S0179	there's not fourteen there be there
S0058	yeah
S0179	well we'd eat we definitely eat twelve for your
S0056	i didn't know you could microwave wrap
S0058	oh yeah do you think you could do it in the grill

S0056	well i thinkmam might cook them in the oven but eh i might be wrong on that one
S0179	yeah you just pop it in the microwave for two minutes bob's your uncle
S0058	yeah you you you

S0179	recycle doesn't seem to have make if you're this far off
S0056	oh we have we do we do try our best but we don't go silly about it
S0179	well as in in our neck of the woods it's two
S0058	it's just
S0179	to one ratio recycle to normal waste as in you've get two recycle bin one normal bin

S0056	eh twice in the past couple of months the the operatives have sling that bin away
S0058	sling
S0056	instead of empty the newspapers out of the box they've manage to recycle the box
S0058	right that's quite special wow
S0179	it's probably recyclable plastic
S0056	i've have to i've have to phone them up and we've have two new ones and
S0058	oh
S0056	then it's this oh yeah that happen all the time sir so yeah do you not want to have a word with your operatives
S0058	yeah
S0179	when you say operatives that sound like sort of black ops you know
S0058	yeah
S0179	someone's go to break into your house in a black balaclava and empty your bin out
S0056	yeah they be call hygiene operatives be it a a bowl in it

S0058	i think i'd never teach you the expression
S0179	sorry
S0058	i wish i'd never teach you the expression snaffle now
S0179	that's the badger
S0058	oh how good be this expression that's the badger someone at work apparently say it
S0179	something that might amuse you erm the em so this colleague of mine at work have get em a load of em he review a lot of cvs that we get cos we get sort of sixty or seventy a month of which about ten people get interview and typically no one get employ but em but em he's compile a list of hilarious things on cvs eh
S0056	yeah
S0179	which include em eh i have great attention to detail where detail be misspell
S0058	yep
S0056	no oh no how embarrass
S0058	you'd be a little
S0179	page three of two be another highlight em
S0058	you'd feel bad wouldn't you
S0179	and there there be another one where em which be eh em i have the skill my education have give me the skills to solve any engineer problem with your two two from oxford brook
S0058	which be quite at claim to make you can solve any engineer problem
S0056	they're not do themselves any favour be they
S0179	well not i'm confident that give enough time and resources i could as i'm sure could a lot of other people at work there's pretty much nothing that's unsolvable but
S0058	be be be these microwavable
S0056	what's that
S0058	be these plat microwaveable or not
S0056	i don't know you'll have to have a word with mam
S0058	or
S0179	try and find out
S0058	or we can stick them on the microwave plate if it's
S0056	i don't know
S0058	i'll i'll try
S0056	just just have a quick chat she might have eh do something
S0179	he's plan on write a book of all of these
S0056	excuse me for interfere that's quite a big gas there
S0179	mm
S0056	there be a lot of liquid come out the vegetables isn't there out of the mushroom
S0179	yeah particularly mushroom actually it depend how fresh they be
S0058	mam doesn't know
S0179	mm just put them on the plat in the microwave em
S0058	yeah
S0179	be this a superbly good grater for this it's very fine i might just go for
S0058	it'll melt really nicely
S0056	ah there's a chip on one of the glass i don't believe it
S0058	oh
S0056	that must have be put away like that oh well there you go
S0179	yeah i'm not convince this be gonna work
S0056	be it because the type of cheese be be
S0179	no i think it's just the grater's design for something a bite more delicate
S0056	alright well we we might we have get another grater
S0179	yeah as in this be work but very slowly
S0058	em
S0179	maybe i put too much
S0058	if i do
S0056	i'll just get another grater out of there
S0058	right can you manage if i do the big ones first then we can pop out and get the put the eight ones in
S0056	first
S0058	and they'll be still warm
S0056	actually there's some if we put this on here you can grate it directly into the container
S0058	ooh sorry
S0179	fiendish
S0056	oh well
S0058	i think this be probably not far off
S0179	ah
S0058	yeah that's good
S0179	mm alright
S0058	alright have it break off
S0179	that's the badger
S0058	that be the badger
S0056	hmm
S0179	again i think cheap cheese be better for grate this be too crumbly
S0058	it be too good quality do you ever find out the em i be go say
S0179	let's put some crumble cheese in
S0058	yeah em should i get the em spice on
S0179	yeah what get the spice on that doesn't work in quite the same way as get your groove on which again doesn't really work at all so
S0056	i'll just put your scarf out here sarah
S0058	oh yeah sure
S0179	eh huh i'm make a pig's ear of this ah i need to wash my hand they've get greasy from the cheese ah that's the badger
S0058	you do need to stop say that you're gonna actually start use it unintentionally unironically
S0179	well it's hardly offensive be it
S0058	no no it's just
S0179	of all the possible expressions you could come out with i think that's a fairly harmless one yeah good point of all the expressions i can and frequently do come out with that's possibly by far the best
S0058	yeah true
S0179	you gotta you've get to think about the audience before that oh that's the badger
S0058	see see what i mean once you start say it you can't stop it's like an addictive phrase should i put them i've put that many wrap in so we have to warm them
S0179	em i can't really grate the rest of this no put the wrap in oh no put the sauce in
S0058	do you see what i mean like cos they're not in the same room
S0179	eh huh mm i'm not sure
S0179	right that's work mostly i don't know if it'll be win any award but
S0058	ah right em
S0056	do you want me to mop up that cheese
S0179	what cheese
S0058	that that cheese that's under yeah
S0056	that cheese on the floor
S0056	there we be i have the very mop up tissue you're not go to put it on your feet though be you don't
S0058	ah cheesy feet
S0179	no almost put that into the bowl
S0058	oh see that's the problem
S0179	my feet be exceptionally clean thank you
S0058	hmm still feet
S0179	what's wrong with a foot you've get a real prejudice against feet
S0058	i don't like feet
S0179	oh sorry
S0056	there you go
S0058	actually one might be enough
S0179	you think
S0056	have you put the medium one in
S0058	i'll turn it off oh
S0179	what
S0058	's be eh
S0179	we'll just pop
S0058	aside
S0056	we'll just pop him on the side
S0058	mm
S0179	no one will know he's here
S0058	hang on i think i might need scissor to get through
S0179	ah that's the badger
S0056	the microwave
S0179	that on there
S0056	look there's a little chip
S0179	right
S0056	in the rim well actually there's two chip there's one there and a big one there it's gotta go a bite of a shame
S0179	yeah
S0056	apparently you can microwave wrap have you know that
S0058	how do you make it live
S0179	power
S0058	oh power
S0179	at a guess right that'll do right two minutes full power yeah well i've we've turn that off so it's just simmer
S0058	turn it off
S0179	i i'm think that one sauce be fine
S0058	yeah i think that's fine oh do you want that sour cream as well can you get that out
S0179	em possibly so it would be okay without
S0058	do you want to turn it off will you talk
S0179	it's fine
S0179	what do everyone keep this up for
S0058	will you not talk otherwise mam
S0058	we can turn it off
S0179	will he be okay there
S0058	he'll be fine
S0056	mam may not be
S0058	yeah i be gonna say conversation might not be
S0179	he doesn't like to be turn off
S0058	em plat
S0179	yes indeed em
S0056	well they might be a bite chilly
S0058	the food doesn't sit on there for very long if i
S0179	it's probably the mechanism without touch the table
S0058	shall we leave that on
S0056	be it inhibit your conversation
S0058	i'll turn it off
