S0455	isn't it that's a lot of money isn't it
S0454	yes
S0579	oh well
S0455	so i be very please with myself that i read it all properly
S0579	oh yes
S0454	dear you probably get fiddle the last few years
S0579	yes
S0455	no because i'd read it all before
S0454	ah right
S0455	but if this be you just have to go through it all again and over the phone they ask for all these question
S0579	how do
S0455	if you're of a certain age you have to do it on the phone but
S0454	oh right
S0455	under a certain age you can just fill in the form online
S0454	yeah
S0579	how do they get why put you there in the first place then like
S0455	she must've misheard me over the phone but she get that detail wrong
S0579	oh i see yes
S0455	they they have to ask you what your medical condition be then i know you haven't get very many but you have to declare what you have get
S0579	you should stay on the phone i'll go and ask my doctor
S0579	there we be
S0455	but i do ask her the first time
S0579	oh yeah
S0455	and and he be very good because
S0579	yes
S0455	he want me to ask him specific question otherwise it would've be very expensive like we'd've have to pay him
S0579	oh right
S0455	to tell us
S0454	oh right
S0579	yeah
S0454	mm
S0454	dear
S0579	yes
S0455	yeah so and i've get it all down and i you haven't tell them you've get anything else so so it's straightforward
S0579	yeah good
S0455	he's get millions of pound cover grandpa have
S0454	oh it's good
S0454	should get a make sure you get your laptop steal the ipad steal all of those things and you can have a new one
S0579	that's right
S0455	yes
S0579	i be read about er what's the name cameron
S0454	oh i know i just saw that
S0579	yes
S0454	yes cos he's lie as well now hasn't he
S0579	apparently
S0455	oh have he
S0454	yes he's he's get catch
S0579	yes
S0454	cos initially he say
S0455	ah
S0454	oh i don't have anything to do with that
S0455	and
S0454	and now it yes and people be okay about that cos i mean he can't be responsible for his father can he
S0579	yes no
S0455	oh no it's
S0454	so people be fine about that and then he say i don't have any share in that company which be true because he sell them but he didn't tell them that
S0579	yeah
S0454	and now it's turn out he's profit from the arrangement after his father die so he be responsible for that
S0454	whether it be illegal i suppose be the next question
S0579	oh yes
S0455	well cos a lot of these things be not illegal be they
S0579	yes
S0454	no
S0579	yes
S0455	but it's a grey area isn't it
S0454	but then consider he's the one say he want to close down all these loop hole
S0579	well that's right isn't it
S0454	that's what's outrageous about it cos he's the one benefit
S0455	yeah it's quite disappoint isn't it all this
S0579	yes i mean the prime minister you expect him to know a few things don't you
S0454	that's right cos he's the one say we need to shut down all these
S0579	yes yes absolutely yes right
S0454	you know they may be legal but it's not ethical and then he's get catch in the same thing
S0579	do the same thing yeah
S0455	yeah
S0454	he could have to resign over that actually if it get big enough
S0579	yes yes
S0455	yes
S0454	because erm he's the one champion it he'll look silly won't he if he's say
S0455	yes
S0454	one thing to one person then it turn out he's
S0579	yes
S0455	it's it's just sad isn't it really cos it happen all the time
S0454	well
S0579	yeah
S0454	he be quite unethical
S0455	mm
S0454	yes
S0579	course the paper get after them on these things don't they
S0454	yes
S0455	there's no mercy
S0579	yes
S0454	he should've come clean in the first place because once he know they have the document
S0579	yeah
S0454	it be just a matter of time before
S0579	someone go after it
S0454	his name come up with it and he they already have his father's from day one
S0579	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0454	so they know yes
S0579	yes
S0454	well good they've be catch some of these people
S0455	yes
S0455	mm
S0579	cos his father be quite prosperous wasn't he apparently
S0454	yes that's right
S0579	a lot of money yes
S0455	and then all the money the government's spend on let us know about the advantage of be in the eu
S0579	yes
S0454	oh yes
S0455	target every household and it's something like
S0454	what a waste of money
S0455	seven million pound i think they've spend on that
S0579	golly that's a lot of money yes
S0454	just for a leaflet
S0455	but it's also one side because
S0455	people say most of us say we don't know enough about it but
S0579	no no
S0455	but we you've gotta have two side of the argument
S0454	just ridiculous
S0455	we've only get one
S0454	such a propaganda
S0579	yes not many people know two side do they
S0454	no
S0455	no
S0579	no
S0454	no so it's really wrong and it's taxpayer's money
S0579	we just have yes
S0455	yes i think it's not good like that
S0454	no i don't think it's good
S0455	not both side
S0454	yes
S0455	we need the both side like
S0454	especially when they're cut service all the time you think well give them that money give the police that money or the nhs or
S0455	yes yes
S0454	someone i don't think the nhs be very good at manage their budget either though
S0579	no no no no no no
S0454	the police they seem to do better with budget
S0455	yes
S0454	yes
S0579	the nhs can always do with some money i suppose yes
S0454	yes but they've be waste a lot it turn out
S0454	pay all sort for agency nurse and private taxis
S0579	oh well
S0454	millions of pound
S0579	oh oh dear yes
S0454	think you might want to have your own ambulance if you're pay that much a year

S0455	oh be it be it
S0579	oh that's nice
S0454	no because they the pole close at nine thirty
S0455	yes
S0454	and they do the brief or no the pole close at ten don't they
S0455	oh i see
S0454	ten pm but they do the brief at nine thirty to start you go in for nine thirty
S0455	yes
S0454	and then you stay until the count's do which be usually around two be or three be
S0455	okay
S0454	but if they order a recount because it's go wrong then you could be there all night
S0455	and do you get pay more for that
S0454	no so it's a flat rate a hundred pound
S0455	you don't

S0455	yeah it's pretty good
S0454	which be well above the minimum wage
S0455	better than the university pay
S0579	yeah it's not bad
S0454	yes it be actually
S0455	and all you've gotta do be count

S0455	oh yeah that's good
S0454	so this can be my practise one
S0455	it's useful all these extra things you're find you can do for a bite of money
S0579	yes
S0454	yeah it's quite fun yes
S0579	so they have a register and they check you on that don't they these
S0454	yes
S0579	i think here they use to have a register somewhere
S0454	yeah so i'm not do that part
S0579	oh i see
S0454	i'm do the bite when the poll close and then we have to open all the ballot paper and put them in the right pile
S0579	oh yes i know
S0454	so erm i know who i want to win so i'll make sure there's two extra
S0579	mm yeah

S0454	yes and we have to check there's no cheat
S0579	mm oh no
S0454	you know no mark on the back of the paper
