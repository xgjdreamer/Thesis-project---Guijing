S0631	i'm very like well why why aren't we live in like commune and why aren't we just fend for ourselves because we're all bugger up the world
S0632	it do seem that way
S0631	it's too complex
S0632	i mean for all the benefit of erm of erm the benefit of i guess medical science and society and live in cities and the kind of way that we've make our world suit us for all those benefit there be huge disadvantage and people feel isolate and stress out in their job and
S0631	yeah
S0632	lose perspective of what life be really mean to be about
S0631	and you know what you know like there's always the erm like they use in like science like animals and things and like make medicine and things my honest i don't i don't think there's an immediate need for all of those medicine if we be all not live in the lifestyles that we do
S0632	mm
S0631	like they're create all these medicine for things that actually probably would be be prevent if it be wasn't for the world that we live in anyway
S0635	mm mm
S0632	mm
S0631	erm for instance blood pressure medication
S0632	mm
S0635	there's various name for it culture meat synthetic meat and shmeat
S0631	i like shmeat
S0632	schmeat
S0635	schmeat
S0635	and they've already make a burger by a dutch team at the moment it's more expensive to make than conventionally produce meat but hopefully that will rebalance
S0632	mm
S0631	but then would the process of make that
S0635	apparently it's culture never attach to a live animal
S0631	okay but would there be someone who be kind of marginalise the process like if they be gonna make that cheaper would then somebody a person
S0635	mm
S0631	be give unfair deal deal
S0635	erm
S0632	as on not on the wikipedia page
S0631	oh yeah yeah and be they gospel
S0635	but you take muscle cells and apply a protein that promote tissue growth
S0631	okay you could do that from injure animals to be fair
S0635	mm
S0632	mm
S0635	erm it would be theoretically possible to or to continue produce meat indefinitely without introduce new cells from a live organism
S0631	but if you think about it you know the human body if you hurt yourself your skin will reform over it and you can attach skin to skin and like
S0635	mm
S0631	you know you can move
S0632	mm
S0631	fat tissue around your body and stuff
S0635	yeah a bite like a sour dough just rise constantly
S0632	a bite like a yeast culture constantly grow
S0631	what if it get out of hand
S0635	mm
S0632	shit be mean to be this weekend and it's just come out the door so
S0631	it's like hack a bite off and fry it hack a bite off and fry it come on
S0632	have a barbecue for discount price
S0631	everyone everywhere have a barbecue you can't stop it grow what if that happen
S0632	and then there's a meat monster and it become sentient and we can't kill it because it's sentient now
S0631	but what if it suffocate you like you just you be in the build and it get it cover the doorway and it get so big and then you get
S0632	that would be awful
S0631	see someone be always gonna be injure and someone be always gonna be
S0632	basically we can't win
S0635	but it's
S0631	no
S0635	true in anything we do like you just
S0631	you could get
S0635	you can hope to make things better but i don't think there'd ever be a way that we can all live without hurt each other or succeed without make someone else's
S0631	wow
S0635	life difficult
S0631	wow
S0635	i think that's very hard and we should always work towards it
S0631	them you'd never
S0632	i'm go to be like devil's i always really wanna say avocado because that's what my mum say
S0631	advocaat
S0632	advocaat devil's advocaat to say oh you know no progress be make without marginalise or hurt something or someone but i know what you mean and we should always strive to not do that
S0635	i'm not say it's good and we should strive not to do it but mm
S0632	yeah
S0631	oh yeah it's like every argument i have to have at uni be it always boil down to equality or something and i'm like yes
S0635	mm mm
S0631	but it doesn't mean that just because it's not achievable you shouldn't strive to it or do that
S0635	mm yeah you should get as close as you can
S0631	you should get
S0635	i feel like people give up and just do whatever
S0631	yeah like like
S0632	it's like oh we'll never get there so let's not try
S0631	yeah
S0635	mm
S0631	definitely
S0635	mm
S0631	and you should always attempt to understand more about what you're
S0635	yes
S0631	care about and that's important
S0632	that's true i do live in ignorance of a lot of things because to be honest the news stress me out and i i go into a tailspin
S0631	oh yeah the news be horrible
S0635	mm
S0631	erm but with like erm talk about school and things be always the equality opportunity
S0632	mm
S0631	debate and like that you can't cos you've get a classroom of thirty children say how do you give an actual equal education to those children do you give them equal time time how much time be you give them
S0632	mm
S0631	or do you go these be the the less erm able children and i'll give more time to them but then the children that be more able why be they not get that
S0632	mm
S0631	why be they not be excel as much you know and
S0632	aha
S0631	it it come in swing and roundabouts kind of like you can never win so you have to just do what the best you can do be erm and that's
S0632	yeah
S0631	just i've lose my thread of think but like but by like erm
S0632	there isn't a simple answer
S0631	but by think about it and conjure up those ideas and you understand that situation more and that's how you can sort of strive
S0632	mm
S0631	to do the best by get it by understand it
S0632	yeah
S0631	and that be how i feel about lot of things
S0632	that make sense
S0635	be it kosher in vitro meat shmeat
S0632	shmeat
S0635	and that's a good question
S0631	how would it not be
S0632	or how could it be
S0635	some muslim scholars have state that in in vitro meat would be allow by islamic law if the original cells and growth media be halal
S0631	yeah
S0635	fascinate
S0631	then you get all of these people though that be like
S0632	oh no all the all the
S0631	i'm not touch it cos it's halal
S0632	all the in vitro meat be halal because it's make in the lab
S0635	but the best
S0631	because because like before er and no animal be kill it have to be alive
S0635	that's
S0632	they kill them when they're alive
S0635	there be the best quote someone say on
S0631	be it russell brand
S0635	say it on radio four yeah or be it russell brand say it
S0631	and he say the and he say
S0632	he do say that
S0631	he have a similar
S0632	and it be quote it be quote from a newspaper that be like
S0635	yeah
S0632	they they kill the animal they they like slit their
S0631	what do you want us to do give it cuddle it to death
S0635	the animal be alive while it's kill yeah
S0632	yeah and it be something like they slit their throats while they're completely alive and it's like well yeah
S0631	well yes you're to understand the concept of life and death here
S0635	yeah
S0635	you can like stun them
S0632	if
S0635	first but i think the stun be as stressful as the kill thing isn't it
S0632	yeah there's no evidence to say that stun do anything
S0631	they're still alive and they will always come back around while they be bleed to death
S0632	i don't think be stun be a nice experience to be honest
S0631	no of course it's not and how do you know that that doesn't actually still cause them pain it just mean they're more confuse surely
S0632	oh you electrocute me in the head thank thank for that
S0631	insult to injury yeah
S0632	so someone be like i'm gonna kill you now do you wanna be electrocute first or do you just want me to kill you
S0631	i'd just wanna be kill well it wouldn't make any difference
S0632	yeah
S0631	cos if i be gonna get slaughter and therefore essentially bleed to death i wouldn't want to come back around during it i i'd you might as well just do it and let's get get it do and i think hunt animals be kill straightaway aren't they generally
S0632	if you hunt
S0635	mm
S0632	something really well as in not with dog to tear it apart
S0631	yeah yeah yeah
S0632	you should shoot it in the head or the heart
S0631	yeah exactly so why be they not just do that
S0635	it doesn't always work out though
S0632	it doesn't always work out you sometimes shoot them in the wrong place but you aim
S0635	and then you have to spend days chase after them to try and finish them off
S0632	that's horrible yeah
S0635	before they go around with like an arrow in their back or something
S0631	them then cos i i wouldn't be up to it i wouldn't do it right
S0635	mm
S0631	i'd be like
S0632	that's why i haven't shoot anything
S0631	no i wouldn't do it right
S0632	cos that happen to he shoot a squirrel but he didn't do it right so they have to wait by the tree for hours my dad make him
S0631	mm mm
S0632	he be like you have to finish that squirrel off he's like you gotta wait for it to come back out the tree so you can finish it
S0631	mm mm
S0632	it's just horrible
S0631	i remember my dad erm when he use to fit phone line and things and like he'd have to do a lot of outside like work to put the phone line in through the grind and everything he accidentally dig through erm some rabbit a rabbit's nest
S0635	oh
S0632	oh
S0631	and he have to end up finish them all off like he bring home this bucket of rabbit to my mum go these er haven't get a mum any more you're their mum and she be just like they're all gonna die if they haven't get a mum so but there there be one i think i think it be actually the mum i think he like really badly injure it it would you know
S0635	mm
S0631	he have to literally just grab a spade for it like just to finish it
S0632	mm
S0631	i think it be that that have happen anyway he have to just do it
S0632	horrid
S0635	mm
S0631	yeah
S0632	really horrid
S0631	i don't like that kinda thing like erm i think i have to do it before me it be either me or i think it be in the garden i make dad do it you know when you find a bee and it's really hurt or something and it's just on the floor
S0632	yeah
S0631	it's just not it's just die
S0632	yeah
S0631	i've make dad just go and help me finish that just do it
S0632	i didn't get that as much when i be little because i use to find bird that have fly into a window and like try and cuddle them back to life
S0631	mm oh they never yeah we never do that they cos they're
S0632	yeah
S0631	always just in shock they die of shock
S0632	they don't shock and their little hearts be like
S0631	they're not in pain
S0632	yeah and i've do that a couple of time and like i have like my so the cat be buy in
S0631	you always think that you can do it but you can't they will always die every bird
S0632	i be only little erm and the cat use to bring in so much wildlife that i'd always
S0631	yes
S0632	try and make it better one time erm i there be the mouse be alive
S0631	yeah
S0632	and then i just assume it'd go to sleep so i be keep in my room under my play pram and i think i cover it in a little cloth until my parent notice the smell
S0631	oh
S0632	and they come and they they discover it and they be like what the hell be this
S0632	and i be like oh my mouse he's sleep but he's gonna wake up at some point like i'm
S0631	mm
S0632	i'm look after him and
S0632	they be like this mouse have be dead for days you need to flush it down the loo and i be like oh my god
S0631	oh
S0631	so horrible isn't it
S0632	like my first experience of something die i didn't get that it have die at all didn't even have the concept in my head that it have die
S0631	mm
S0632	i be like well it's asleep for some reason it won't wake up and i didn't notice the smell
S0632	mm
S0635	mm
S0632	i know it's gross but little kid you know
S0635	i i do i think i go back to find my goldfish
S0632	my i think my mum use to dig things back up in their garden
S0635	after they die
S0632	the the things get bury
S0635	what on purpose or just
S0632	mm to have a look
S0635	why yeah i do that yeah
S0632	see how it's get on
S0635	yeah
S0635	just for the fish though
S0632	try to think i'm sure it be my mum who say that and it would've be old guinea pig and hamsters and things
S0635	mm mm
S0632	or rabbit maybe
S0635	ugh
S0632	they didn't have pet rabbit they only eat rabbit so it could've be i dunno if they'd've just throw the bone in the bin i'll ask nan tomorrow when she call mm do you like the wine i do
S0635	yes it be very good
S0635	mm mm
S0632	and i really like the way you cook the steaks that be like blacken on the outside but still pink in the middle
S0635	mm well you need to make it very hot first and then you cook it on both side but
S0632	both side oh
S0635	yes
S0632	that's where i've be go wrong
S0635	and then you check it
S0632	you check it
S0635	mm mm
S0632	how do you check it
S0635	with a slicey knife
S0632	a slicey knife beautiful
S0635	mm mm
S0632	so you're quite excite about the er prospect of lab meat aren't you
S0635	yes
S0632	i can tell and you'd you'd definitely eat it you'd be like there's no problem with this i'm not freak out by it at all
S0635	well yeah from what i be just read it sound
S0632	it's no worse than my multivitamin
S0635	fine yeah they be say someone be say there be ethical concern cos they have to use some sort of foetal fluid in produce the culture
S0632	foetal fluid from what animal
S0635	a cow
S0632	a cow
S0635	yeah
S0632	so they have to do something to
S0635	er yeah
S0632	a pregnant cow
S0635	they need like proteins and stuff i don't know
S0632	foetal fluid
S0635	mm
S0631	what's this
S0635	i mean i think the early stag of create culture meat will probably have to hurt some animals but it will be for eternal good
S0631	it might be do from things that they've already harm like
S0635	yeah
S0631	they could do it from things they've already produce
S0635	yeah you could probably get everything you need from that scrap there
S0632	apart from the foetal fluids that you just say
S0635	yeah
S0631	fluids
S0632	foetal fluids apparently there's some concern about ethics because
S0635	mm
S0632	of foetal fluid basically
S0631	in what respect what way
S0632	that that they need to use the foetal fluid of a cow in order to help create the culture that you need
S0631	the foetal fluid
S0635	yeah
S0631	be you on about just like when it give birth and all the
S0632	like amniotic fluid
S0635	no no no well i don't know if it if it it i i don't know
S0631	cos if it's amniotic you can just wait for a cow to give birth and then just use it
S0632	like scoop it up
S0631	just be there with a bucket
S0635	erm reactions of vegetarians vary some feel in vitro meat present to the public be not vegetarian as foetal calf serum be use in the growth medium
S0632	mm
S0635	but it's very early days like i think we'll i think we'll get better
S0631	will we get there though or will someone else in a different generation get there
S0635	i don't know there's a company that want to be sell it erm
S0632	will the eat lab meat and live on mar
S0635	within the next five years
S0631	it's the word lab that make me think there's something there's something funny there
S0635	yeah we'd have to cast aside
S0632	have they actually make any yet
S0635	yes
S0631	be they run their machine with little mice on turntables
S0635	mm
S0631	cos something go
S0632	cos you're against it
S0631	yeah be yeah be there you know there's gonna be something weird about it be they exploit mice
S0632	it's always the mice they get terrible end of the deal
S0635	yeah yeah but like your carrots be probably exploit in some way
S0631	who be they test it on who they who they're test it on might be consider very unethical
S0635	er what like who eat them
S0631	yeah who cos they wouldn't be able to sell it without have like
S0632	have you ever consider do medical trials
S0631	yeah
S0632	i see the advert on the tube sometimes and i'm like
S0631	i wanna do flucamp
S0632	flucamp yeah flucamp
S0631	flucamp you get four grand
S0632	it's like yeah i'll i'll do flucamp i'm i'm strong and young
S0631	all you have to do be be isolate for two two weeks
S0631	and not have have a flu jab and i haven't have one i get offer i get offer
S0632	no i've never have one
S0631	i get offer them all the time i can get one for free and i'm just like no i can't be bother

S0631	it's like a tenner
S0632	and i be like yeah
S0635	so do young people have a flu jab
S0632	well i be like it wasn't that
S0631	i could have one because i can get one for free
S0632	just cos you can
S0635	yeah
S0632	cos i associate it with like my grandparents who like
S0631	but
S0632	be like yes get a flu jab because if you get the flu
S0631	if you've get certain criteria like be elderly or have certain medical condition be pregnant like that kind of thing yeah
S0635	mm
S0632	get one definitely
S0631	but i cos i've be offer one
S0635	mm

S0632	uhu
S0635	oh okay yeah
S0631	be a target and i'm a bite like i've never have flu i don't know if that make you more susceptible to get it again

S0631	of sick
S0632	and i be like be there a motorcyclist and i know there wasn't but erm i be half and half i like get it like half down i be kinda sick over the window
S0631	mm
S0632	so er it be some on the outside there be some on the inside there be some in the actual groove of the window
S0631	ah but if you need to be sick you need to be sick you can't always choose your place
S0632	that's the only party of the journey i remember and it be like a like an hour and a half journey and i don't remember anything else i be just
S0631	too knock out
S0632	i be completely so that might've be flu cos i never go to the doctor about it and my my mum get sick like a day or two after but we be already at nan and grandad's so they look after us
S0631	mm could've be anything
S0632	could've be anything yeah
S0631	could've just be take cos i've be a bite like that when i've have sort of like tonsillitis and i've be like very very very not be sick but very very drowsy and just not myself and like literally just sit
S0632	yeah
S0631	just like that
S0632	yeah
S0631	not be able and just zone out all the time
S0632	yeah i've have that tonsillitis as an adult and it wasn't pleasant but it wasn't it wasn't as horrible as i think it be but i be tell that i have a very minor case of tonsillitis like about as minor as you can get
S0631	yeah
S0632	and still have tonsillitis
S0631	i er i've have it and it's not it won't've be the worst tonsillitis but i've have it and it just feel like you're swallow like a golf ball or something
S0632	yeah i remember it be horrible to swallow things and just be the it be just like a particularly bad sore throat it be like
S0631	mm
S0632	it's a sore throat but it's worse than usual and i feel more unwell than usual like i feel really woozy and hot and
S0631	yeah
S0632	just like rubbish and i go back to work and i couldn't really concentrate on anything and all the telephone ring be like
S0631	ah
S0632	in my head
S0631	mm yeah
S0632	so that be that be like really really unpleasant but not not unbearable not the worst you haven't have tonsillitis have you
S0635	mm maybe
S0632	maybe
S0635	dunno
S0632	might've but have you have flu do you think
S0635	er probably not
S0631	i haven't have it definitely that's the only way i could get mum to describe it to me you feel it's a wad of cash or something about to fly out of your window you wouldn't bother get it you wouldn't bother stop it if it go out of the window you'd just let it go
S0631	apparently
S0632	i think my dad have flu when he be in london and he be live in that bedsit and he say that heater save his life that little
S0631	yeah
S0632	convection heater i think that be flu
S0631	do you remember when like erm bird flu come out and everyone suddenly think they have it
S0632	yeah
S0631	and it's one it be one flu yeah bird flu
S0632	bird flu yeah cos there be swine flu as well wasn't there but
S0631	no might've be i'm i'm try to think of the actual specific cos er no might've be no it be swine flu actually that one when that one be out so obviously everyone go a bite frantic and they all think they've get it for some reason don't they a lot of them think they
S0632	some reason everyone's get it yeah
S0631	think they've get swine flu erm and so obviously when i be in work in so you have to put like a proper sign on your door say if you've get if you think you've get the symptoms of swine flu don't come in erm ring like call the nhs direct
