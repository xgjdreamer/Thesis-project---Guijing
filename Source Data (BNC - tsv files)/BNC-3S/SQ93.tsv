S0392	blimey
S0390	do i tell you a while ago i saw a programme on tv where they have find these heinz erm christmas puddings from scott's antarctic expedition and they eat them all those sort of forty fifty years i think no sixty years later so two thousand and eight it be not go to
S0392	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah mm no
S0390	i don't look at date
S0392	no i think people take them too seriously don't they like
S0390	i suppose it's good business if i'd have throw that tin away i would have have to buy another one
S0392	yeah well the idea be it's to stop you sue them say i get food poison whereas the date so they've get to be really careful and haven't they just in case something happen
S0390	i don't know i don't i don't go into those sort of things
S0392	yeah that say it will be fine it doesn't instantly overnight just turn do it
S0390	well your nose generally tell you
S0392	yeah oh your eye
S0390	er no normally it's your nose you know if it's a tin and either you be pull it or you be put a a tin opener in there's a if it's if it's off you know because it smell horribly
S0392	yeah mm
S0390	and what have you be up to this week
S0392	erm on monday i nothing in particular tuesday well that be quite interest i have there be i be a a bite stick on tuesday because i didn't know what be go to happen whether i be go to be go to the area cricket trials in
S0390	right and do you
S0392	i didn't no i have to go somewhere else instead i have to go to ripon with the music department to pick up this violin off the lady you know sort of near morrisons so we go there
S0390	eurgh so that be the lady
S0392	you know i tell you about
S0390	yes
S0392	yeah
S0390	tell me again i keep forget
S0392	well she her husband have die and she be full of this violin that he have i talk to her about how good it be and then we have to collect that off her because she be give it to us
S0390	yes mm mm your mum or school
S0392	no me and the music teachers so i be a bite disappoint about that really
S0390	why
S0392	because i could've be at the trials and play for the area and i'd have get a little thing for my blazer that say cricket on it still never mind
S0390	ah ah ah well do this mean you won't get a chance again
S0392	it mean i won't be able to play for but it doesn't bother me too much i mean i can play for club and school and things so that doesn't matter i'm not too bother about that but still we go to get the instrument from the lady in it be quite fun the the journey and everything and erm get there and she give us it and she really enjoy it and we ask her to come back to the the concert in summer and there we say you can have a bowl of strawberries i didn't know she be allergic to strawberries and we say you can have a bowl of raspberries and cream but she's allergic to cream so she so we be just go to get her a bowl of raspberries yeah and then she give us all the stuff so i have to sort through that and the fiddle's be thing
S0390	mm yes oh dear oh dear well be it music as well
S0392	yeah there's a bite of that which i'm go to see for the orchestra which they can have and there's a music stand as well but i've leave that with them a tune fork as well that i've keep and a couple of bow as well which be handy i suppose because you can i've always be worry about one of my bow break erm so if i've get a spare that's a lot easier and then wednesday erm just a normal wednesday really and yesterday we have a match after school against
S0390	mm right yes mm mm mm mm ah cricket
S0392	yeah but that be really disappoint because our batsman didn't really get go at the start and the wicket be really hard to bowl off because it be just like a flat bite of carpet in the middle of a field where you're run in your spike then all of a sudden half way through your run up there's like a carpet so you have to adapt to that so it's difficult to bowl on and plus they have this one person who look about twenty five he be hammer
S0390	mm be he a sixth former
S0392	no no they have to he have to be in year ten but he look about twenty five he just and he didn't really have any skill but he just have brute force that at that's all you need really
S0390	well i wouldn't have think that brute force would've enable you to hit the ball yes when you've actually hit it
S0392	yeah well that's the thing yeah
S0390	yeah
S0392	and there be two of us who be bowl well but the other people didn't really and one of our players didn't turn up either so if we play them as our teacher say if we play them again we'd beat them every single time after that but it be just that first time they take us by surprise with it because just like the way they play and everything it be really different
S0390	well they have the advantage it be their field
S0392	well you don't really find that to be honest that's not really a
S0390	but you just say it be like a piece of carpet and you have to
S0392	yeah but they but they have to play off it as well so they have the difficulty
S0390	but if it be theirs they're use to it
S0392	no because we have a carpet at our school and we really hate it and it you you just can't get use to it i know what you mean but it's just impossible to get use to
S0390	it's not an actual carpet be it
S0392	yeah it's a carpet
S0390	or be it grass you know artificial
S0392	it's well it's like a carpet of green grass
S0390	artificial
S0392	yeah so it's a carpet
S0390	mm mm
S0392	we've get one at our school and you never get use to it plus you're play away all the time at proper pitch and with the club you play on a proper pitch as well so
S0390	which club
S0392	well any club that you play for they all have proper pitch
S0390	and which club do you play for
S0392	i haven't really decide this year because there's some people want me to do one and some people want me to do the other
S0390	and so
S0392	yeah and i want to do one but then i feel sorry for the other so i'm just go to have to decide
S0390	you can't play for both
S0392	no they play on the same night i'm afraid
S0390	oh well
S0392	and then today er we be discuss what have happen last night erm just have a laugh it be good fun though like the journey and score and everything because you get a lot of time when you're just sit down when you're wait for all the people to get back which be great fun
S0390	so you go on a bus oh that's good and mum and dad pick you up at the end
S0392	mm er no the bus bring you back to school
S0390	that's what i mean and then your mum and dad have to come and pick you up
S0392	yeah that's it well no just come and get me
S0390	right
S0392	there be other people say if they want to drop me off but no i say it's alright well nobody it would they would have to be go out of their way really
S0390	and there's your poor mum with a twenty four hour virus oh what a shame shame on you
S0392	twenty four hours she be better by then i think it mustn't have be too bad so it must be twenty four hours
S0390	right i meet yeah i i meet in tesco's and oh it be such a you know tesco's be build for big people and if there's anything on the top shelf i can't reach it
S0392	yeah yeah you get those little stool though don't you
S0390	you're not allow to i once do that and they they be only for staff
S0392	that's a load of rubbish a load of rubbish just use it
S0390	yeah but then they be not always there that's what we have in libraries those sort of stool but be there when i want some jam from the top shelf and i want yogurt from the top shelf and she be there so she just come and help me and your grandma be there
S0392	yeah yeah yogurt from the top shelf i think it be all sort of down in the fridge
S0390	no this be the on offer yogurt in one of the sort of end aisles and it be right at the top and if it's a if it's a small thing i can get it down but if it's a big thing and i have one hand it might be
S0392	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0391	how many buns this size
S0390	so there you go
S0392	yeah
S0391	three sausages
S0390	no i haven't have any
S0391	two
S0390	talk about yesterday oh yes
S0391	two with extra
S0392	do you see the the election debate last night the opposition one
S0390	erm which one be that
S0392	where it be all the opposition leaders i think it be clever
S0390	oh you mean it be the opposition as they be now
S0392	yes i think it be clever of the the media
S0390	i think you mean that personally you saw them as the opposition
S0392	no no no it's the opposition erm i i saw it erm i find it clever how the media have brand it because originally it be go to be a normal leaders debate but then cameron and clegg didn't want to be in it but with it be the bbc well cameron didn't want to be in it with it be the bbc they have to give everyone their own fair share point of view so for them they have to call it the an opposition leaders debate otherwise they wouldn't have be allow to do it
S0390	mm right i understand
S0391	how many sausages would you like in how many buns
S0392	er i'll do it myself
S0391	oh just to give me an idea two three
S0392	erm two yeah

S0391	well you can always come back for more
S0390	that's all i want and no coleslaw please it doesn't agree with me anymore
S0391	no i haven't get any would you like an egg and some chip
S0390	oh yes
S0392	how long will it be
S0391	er oh twenty minutes
S0392	okay can i just shut cheer
S0390	do you have you be you go to have a german exam
S0392	er i have it a long time ago
S0390	no it's not that long ago
S0392	i tell you all about it didn't i
S0390	i don't remember
S0392	maybe you're think about that person who have a cold
S0390	i think in all honesty right no i'm not i'm think you know there be our little group up at and there be a big parish from somewhere over in cheshire i can't remember the name of the place and there be a german lady and she have very she have as much english as i have german we get on really well together she wasn't in our group
S0392	yeah yeah yes yeah really so do you speak in the
S0390	oh i speak in german to her as best as best i could no don't don't you be just don't you start i know it be not as good as yours now you be miles ahead of me but i could still make her understand it might have be grammatically incorrect
S0392	oh gosh yeah yeah but that's all as long as it's right do you know what i mean the word be right they can
S0390	as long as they understand it
S0392	yeah i mean if i say to you tomorrow i go museum to
S0392	no if i say in english tomorrow tv i watch you know what i mean wouldn't you say an example in german if you say like they get word of it wrong
S0390	yeah yeah yeah mm now what's tomorrow again
S0392	well er i think
S0392	yeah
S0390	or no that's the italian sorry museum i can't remember
S0392	yeah it's just museum
S0390	be it
S0392	yeah
S0390	it's latin
S0392	yeah well we're prepare for our english language not english language german write now as well so hopefully that will be do soon
S0390	so do you get your gcse this year
S0392	no they only do some of it you only do like thirty percent this year or something yeah that make sense thirty percent
S0390	i think
S0392	yeah well he sort of have an advantage doesn't he so he's er be he do all the year early within sort of be
S0390	german something and something
S0392	latin be it
S0390	latin
S0392	do that outside school you know
S0390	no it's inside school this time be outside school
S0392	so be it on curriculum now
S0390	mm
S0392	blimey gosh
S0390	mm
S0392	i think by the time it's exams next year oh by the time it's exams next year i don't think i'll be do any that i don't have a little bite i've already do you know what i mean apart from probably maths which be easy anyway all the other ones i've do a little percentage of which be handy i think by the end of this year i would've do a percentage of most of them i'm just think yeah
S0390	yes very good yes mm mm well it get you in it take the fear away
S0392	well it take a lot of the pressure away as well
S0390	yeah yes oh dear
S0392	and it make it more you work harder as well because you know that this stuff actually count
S0390	mm i mean we just have it all in one year
S0392	yeah yeah for biology what i'm go to have to do be just wait until the half term or so before and then just learn all of it really because we don't really learn much to be honest because it's all just hard i've notice a lot of people have that problem all around the
S0390	with biology
S0392	yeah
S0390	do you think it's the long name for all the
S0392	i think it's just like how there's so much stuff and it's all none of it's particularly inspire that's on the curriculum nowadays it could it could be the best subject if you do what people like because everyone's interest in animals really aren't they everybody love animals people be interest in see plant and things but when you start talk about cells and bacteria i think that people don't really
S0390	no it's not no oh yes yes i don't think we do that
S0392	i mean cells it doesn't really matter to be honest
S0390	but do you do human biology
S0392	do a little bite of it but it's never the interest subject it's always about how nervous system work and things
S0390	i would think that would be quite useful
S0392	not really
S0390	well it
S0392	motor neurones synapses
S0390	no oh dear yes
S0392	and you've get to know how everything work
S0390	do they ever have these sort of multiple choice question still
S0392	they get rid of those about four years three or four years ago yeah
S0390	never really
S0392	it's all write now and that's the problem because if you don't quite word your answer the way it's in the mark scheme then it's a big cross you can
S0390	that's wrong
S0392	there be a question suggest reason and i put something i'd hear in the news that morning and obviously with it not be on the mark scheme i didn't get anything for it but i'm wise to that now i just stick to
S0390	that that's not education that's just sort of regurgitate
S0392	well at the this level they they don't really care if you think about the kind of people that write the exams or of that they'll all they'll say ah gcse everyone do it sort of thing
S0390	well we didn't have oh mine be o level but we didn't have multiple choice it be all sort of write but when i use to mark maths you have to give mark for get so far through to the answer
S0392	yeah yeah we get you get like on maths it's a bite better because you get method mark accuracy mark and result mark sort of thing
S0390	yes yes uhu
S0392	yeah
S0390	so you know you could get the wrong answer but you could get two or three mark
S0392	yeah easy you could get four out of five well maybe three out of five
S0390	mm yeah three out of five sound more like it
S0392	it's about the way you do it isn't it it's a bite like physics as well that out of all the sciences at this level physics be probably the easiest because they just give you the equation and it's just about put the number into it
S0390	mm mm mm yes i understand
S0392	whereas if you're learn all sort of things the revision guide be handy though because they tell you everything in there
S0390	the revision guide or guy
S0392	yeah the they're like guide it be like a little book a4 size and it just
S0390	mm do the school give you those
S0392	we have to buy them for like three pound fifty or something
S0390	well that's not bad that's money well spend
S0392	that's not too bad yeah because if you're not go to learn it in class and they don't really tell you exactly what you need to learn or anything physics do and chemistry do but somehow
S0390	be it so far write down so that you can just rewrite it parrot fashion
S0392	how do you mean
S0390	well when i use to do exams especially with we get one on greek and turkish independence i think
S0392	be that history
S0390	history yes and above my head when i'm think i can see my exercise book and i'm just write the answer i'm just see it and copy down what i see in my mind
S0392	really
S0390	yes and i can see when i turn over the page be that what you do
S0392	no not at all i erm
S0390	different kind of do you remember things that you hear cos i don't
S0392	yeah i can remember anything i'm quite good with facts
S0390	right i'm i see when it's write down it's it's not a good photographic memory but it's part of a photographic memory which it it help at o level but it doesn't at a level you know you've get to start think
S0392	yeah oh i don't think it would help at o level now or gcses either to be honest the way it work there's a lot more sciences themselves have even try to help you sort or engage with the question if you know what i mean so give your own opinion positives and negative things to an extent obviously the most of the question be
S0390	mm mm well in that case if they're ask your opinion something you have read in the paper that day
S0392	then it would get on that one yeah but on other ones if it be erm something i think it be something about statins or something
S0390	it would it would oh right well yes that be facts they want
S0392	give give two reason why er some people don't want you to have them then they want to two hard facts and then i say that something about effectiveness that have come out in the news that morning that it wasn't too effective or something it be something i don't really i can't remember really what it be
S0390	right right do they tell you your result
S0392	yeah yeah you get tell your result
S0390	so you know
S0392	what what do you mean
S0390	well how many mark you have get how many percentages you know if you've get a paper and it's go to count
S0392	oh yeah all the paper you do those at the end of year eleven so
S0390	yeah i know that but the things that you're do now they count a certain percentage towards your final mark
S0392	not on the paper and things that's only little essay that you write control assessments only they count
S0390	okay
S0392	we've only do about we've only do two things that count so far three things
S0390	well what be you tell me you get a hundred percent in be it german
S0392	well i've get a hundred percent in everything so far
S0390	oh dear i don't think i'd bother go back to school if i be you
S0392	no so far we've do two english but i've only get the result for one of them a a german and a physics
S0390	hang on what be the english language or literature
S0392	er language but it be more like literature really what we're do now be more like language and then the other one be literature so
S0390	what be it do you do a shakespeare play
S0392	we've do a we've do that already you only do one
S0390	what be it
S0392	we do compare macbeth and richard the third
S0390	ah macbeth be my one of my favourites
S0392	i like richard it's brilliant
S0390	i like richard the second
S0392	oh yeah be that a play
S0390	well hang on be it the one with old john o gaunt lancaster
S0392	no that sound that doesn't sound like what we're do
S0390	right so it's it's richard the second i'm talk about because we have that for ours where you could there be there be you could choose and about six of us choose richard the second and i think the other one be a sort of flowery
S0392	yeah yeah like othello or something
S0390	no it wasn't othello erm and it wasn't midsummer nights dream
S0392	romeo and juliet
S0390	it could've be but i know it didn't appeal to me so i do richard the second
S0392	yeah richard the third's really funny it some people call it a history like with it some people call it a tragedy with him die at the end some people well no one call it a comedy but it should be really because it's really funny in place some good pun in it
S0390	yes be that the one with
S0392	it could be it's now be the winter of our discontent
S0390	of our discontent
S0392	but people think
S0390	make glorious by the son of york
S0392	people think that now be the winter of our discontent be about like erm how it's the winter and everything's dark when actually if you read the full bite it it be say now be this winter of this discontent be make glorious by
S0390	no yeah yeah be bring by this son of york
S0392	and then that's a pun sun like the sunlight as the sun but it's the son of york so that's one pun there's load of other ones as well
S0390	yes yes i'd forget all that we use to do a shakespeare play every year

S0390	i can remember
S0392	oh that's in twelfth night
S0390	that's in twelfth night yes erm

S0390	pardon
S0392	there's one call yeah and then erm it be music with the food of love and then play on yeah
S0390	yeah yes mm mm and give me excess of this wow it's sixty years since i do that
S0392	yeah i can't get over how we've already do it and it be just one little a couple of page essay and it count as twenty five percent that's what strike me
S0390	well that mean it's get to be succinct you've get to get
S0392	yeah we're only allow four side er four to six side most of us do six side
S0390	well i don't think that that's very fair because a smaller writer can get so much more
S0392	ah no no that that be a guideline it wasn't really size of write sort of thing if you'd write big then she'd of understand if you've go over a bite more it be word really as a guide
S0390	it be it be a word count in an undergraduate essay you be never allow more than two thousand word i think i'm not sure but at one time it be that it be eight side in handwrite
S0392	yeah yeah what we've move onto now be a lot more sort of language orientate so it's more look at the way language work and collect sample of text message and things and think of
S0390	it must've change it must have how do you youngsters manage to spell things correctly when they're use text speak all the time
S0392	well they're not though people never use text speak anymore that's what the what's what the investigation's into because it be write a lot of years ago like five years ago so when people do it absolutely nonstop but nowadays your phone most phone have get a full qwerty keyboard out you're not these days you're not you pay you've get a contract so it doesn't matter how many character you use and if you spell something wrong like you miss out a letter it correct it for you
S0390	really it's almost like a spellchecker on the computer
S0392	yeah so nowadays
S0390	very very good because the phone i've get when i text your mum it's always you know text speak as much as i can manage
S0392	yeah yeah and if you write the letter u like for you it'll think you mean a like a the article if you're do like a single vowel by itself so it will print you to a so it's a lot more easy just to type y o u and have to go back and correct it
S0390	well if you've get that little keyboard
S0392	just with your finger like just a little keyboard yeah
S0390	mm mm whereas you know you've get to with my twelve year old phone
S0392	yeah well people still have those now
S0390	i still use it
S0392	yeah i know someone i know a lot of people who still use sort of ones with er one two three number layout
S0390	mm mm
S0392	yeah
S0390	and you put number four for for when you're say for this for that and
S0392	yeah yeah i'm i'm try to remember what you call that it's something like a homophonic representation or something we've get to learn all the term that people use so i think it's over or something be where if you say you know like when people go yeah and spell it y y y e e e a a a a a h h h h h exclamation mark exclamation mark exclamation mark like that like when they really do you know i reckon we get
S0390	no no for yay i will put y a h
S0392	you know if you go i'm so tire they put load of os after it you know what i mean have you come across that before
S0390	no
S0392	ah well some people do that if you put like if you want to show that you're scream like ah you've get a load of as and load of rs gs and hs
S0390	ah i would put a a a no just put ah
S0392	because no if you it's like you're pretend to scream that sort of that's what you call an over and the whole idea of the task be to pretend er look at the ways that people try and recreate speak language within write modern communications
S0390	now you've just use another word i wouldn't i i know what it mean by the context
S0392	over yeah so you're use over lexis more letter then you've get to we use things like which i think be where people sort oh what be that one or be it softeners where you have things like maybe or to be honest or something to to make it sound like if you just say could i borrow your thing then that's obviously a bite more harsh than please could i that would it be okay if i borrow or would it be okay if i
S0390	yes yes yes mm mm be that to well you would normally say please may i mm do you think i could possibly
S0392	yeah it's soften it
S0390	mm
S0392	and then you get the brevity measure brevity techniques which be where you keep things short like instead of because
S0390	yes yes and yes i understand mm great g r good g d
S0392	that's not that's not so common nowadays it be though before
S0390	oh i'm get old you be make me feel old ah
S0392	however things like lol laugh out loud
S0390	laugh out oh
S0392	yeah that's become a word really so people still use that as a word as in that's funny but not funny in a
S0390	i didn't know that laugh out loud
S0392	if something's if you want to show that you're laugh you can't laugh through a text message so you put a ha or a lol or a a little smiley face have you see those little smiley face
S0390	no i've see that lol yeah oh a smiley face
S0392	yeah
S0390	yes
S0392	that be the problem with when david cameron be send text message to rebekah brook remember in the phone hack scandal he put a lol think it be lot of love but it it turn out to be laugh out loud
S0390	right that's what i be when you be say laugh out loud i be think that's not what i understand and my brain hadn't quite pick it up
S0392	but he think it mean but he think it mean lot of love so the message he be put lol david cameron but if people who know it mean laugh out loud what he's write before that become really ironic and funny think that he be put laugh out loud at that
S0392	well we will have to go through now so
