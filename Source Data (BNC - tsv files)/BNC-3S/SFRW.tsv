S0510	you do good i'm glad you like the look of it
S0509	good good
S0606	but it what's now i'll have to get it on the google earth that's what i need
S0510	google earth be the way to go yeah
S0606	google earth
S0510	definitely and so it's
S0606	now you're talk
S0510	from cavtat to dubrovnik it's eighteen kilometres and you've get the option of either get the bus for a few euros it's twenty five minutes by road to dubrovnik erm or get the boat and that's eight euros but i i like go on boat do everybody else like go on boat
S0509	i like boat
S0606	i like boat yeah
S0606	get to return
S0510	oh well yeah i think so
S0509	i hope so
S0510	but erm you know you you can mix it up can't you if you want to go to dubrovnik for a few days you could do once by boat once by bus once by hitch
S0509	once by motorbike
S0509	you know let's go wild
S0510	yeah
S0509	let's get on a on a a helicopter why don't we
S0510	yeah
S0509	mm
S0510	and then i mean there be i i quite i mean i love go on boat anyway but i quite fancy the idea of if it's within our budget get a boat trip out to one of the smaller islands or even just further up the coast to split or something you know
S0509	mm
S0510	but that would be a probably a yeah
S0509	a larger a larger excursion
S0510	actually do you know what i didn't look for which i'd notice when i be look up the other end of the coast up split way erm i be look at national park up there cos there's you know lot of national park and that would be
S0509	mm if we can find a national park cos they've just get like beautiful waterfalls just you know
S0510	yeah
S0509	cram into every corner basically
S0510	mm
S0509	i'd like that
S0510	yeah
S0509	but yeah it look like a lovely place i'm quite excite
S0510	oh well that's good

S0509	yeah can you just like take them at home and print them out the right size
S0510	yeah well you can but do you know what sort of we have get a bite of time so that that's okay but you'll be better off do it
S0606	do it in the machine for three quid
S0510	yeah you'll be better off do it in the machine cos
S0509	yeah
S0606	it'll be cheaper cos they get to be at an exact size and everything
S0509	mm
S0510	and er when we i don't know if you remember but when we go to rhodes
S0509	mm
S0510	and we be kind of get passports sort then
S0510	we didn't have a for some reason we didn't have a huge amount of time do we
S0509	no i think we book as long before or something
S0510	maybe that be it we didn't have the fund to book it till late but erm we go through the post office cos they do a really good service where you pay a bite extra i think it be ten pound a person erm to make sure that you've get all the documentation right when you send it off to the passport office
S0509	off yeah
S0510	so you can take it in they check it if there's anything they think be slightly dodgy or might hold it up then they they get you to you know take it back and bring it back again so that at least when you do finally submit it the to the pass passport office you're pretty much a hundred percent certain that there's not go to be any hold up that end
S0509	mm
S0606	yeah but we don't want to do that we just want to get it in early enough don't we
