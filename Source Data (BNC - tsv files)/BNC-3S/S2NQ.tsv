S0259	that's right yeah
S0255	although i suppose normal people who be out on bail they carry on with their own job don't they
S0259	mm
S0255	if you're out on bail you go to work you carry on

S0255	different restrictions on er what different people have depend on who they be what they've do what you know what the flight risk be et cetera but

S0255	so
S0259	until find guilty i suppose
S0255	yeah

S0255	get so many different ones there now cos we're put it out regularly
S0259	yeah
S0255	it they get use to it incoming and we get erm
S0259	you get the fat ball out they like that don't they the fat ball
S0255	yeah the starlings like the the fat ball they come they come quite regularly erm
S0259	be they dry mealworms or
S0255	they're no they're not mealworms which ones be you look at
S0259	aren't they oh the one that bird be just have a little
S0255	oh that's just mix seed
S0259	oh be it
S0255	yeah
S0255	normally in the the bottom leave one we have either the mealworms or the suet
S0259	oh yeah i can see now
S0255	little suet pellet things yeah but that's erm we haven't get any of those so i've just put the normal seed in think you know they'll they'll eat it a a lot of different bird eat that as well
S0259	yeah they do yeah
S0255	mm it's quite nice cos the window cleaner come
S0259	yeah i've notice that's
S0255	the weekend do all the windows cos the the starlings go in the birdbath and just splash like mad and it spatter up the window
S0255	and then sometimes cos the the hosepipe's outside the window here put it there for clean the fish out so i'll just get it and and spray water and spray water and 's do it as well
S0259	yeah
S0255	this and sometimes you hit the the little water thing and it splatter back
S0255	and it's just the whole window's get cover in all this this water
S0259	i've just i've just do so
S0255	yes no brilliant
S0259	do they go in that letterbox
S0255	erm they we haven't we've have they've look we have blue tits that be look on and off and then erm what do we have this year no we have a blackbird we have a blackbird actually in in the hedge itself
S0259	oh right yeah
S0255	yeah
S0255	erm don't worry that'll be the same same call that's now go through the number and end up on the
S0259	ah
S0255	on that phone rather than the fax erm yeah we have we have a blackbird last year actually in the hedge and the year before we have blue tits in i think in the little one that be at the top there
S0259	oh right yeah
S0255	erm on the leave
S0259	there's blue tits i i remember have some of them in my garden and the box we put out be just
S0255	mm
S0259	open
S0255	mm
S0259	when they be i'm like no one's ever gonna use that cos it's too open
S0255	yeah
S0259	but the blue tits they use it
S0255	oh yeah
S0259	when when i go to get some seed and that the chap say oh blue tits prefer
S0255	mm
S0259	open box like that
S0255	yeah
S0259	and what they do be actually camouflage
S0255	yeah they do cos
S0259	i think that's weird that cos you'd think they'd prefer a camouflage it's protection innit
S0255	you you can see in the hole they actually erm they start to chip away at the hole
S0259	mm
S0255	and they're not quite sure if they're try to make it a bigger hole or whether they're just mark the territory or what they're do but you can see and they do that while they're actually
S0259	mm you can see can't you yeah
S0255	because we watch them the year they they go in there build the nest and they keep come and go and and basically the male and female come and they look and they inspect and he take her round he find load of different ones and then take her and show her one or two and she choose and if she doesn't like it they have to go off to a different one
S0259	ah
S0255	they call the starlings
S0259	erm so then and he be make the hole bigger do that and then they keep come back and have like second view and stuff like that
S0255	but then in the end they do nest in there and yeah we we have a load of baby in there and we've have robins you i don't think you can see but right at the end it's just a coconut er empty empty coconut shell with a really big
S0259	oh right yeah
S0255	open and we have robins in there about three years ago we have robins nest in there
S0259	oh brilliant
S0255	and that be before we really put all the food out we now we're put more food out we have
S0259	you're get all sort now yeah
S0255	yeah we have the blackbird last year erm and the blue tits be look but i think because the bird have already claim territory it be too close for comfort for the blue tits
S0259	yeah
S0255	to go in there
S0259	those starlings they take everything don't they
S0255	yeah because the blue tits use to go in erm next door have a have a box in his tree and they they use to be in there year after year after year
S0259	oh right
S0255	and then they start come and they come here and you're sort of like oh they've move on to better quarter
S0259	yeah cos the other day erm not last week i think it be the week before i be clean away and he be chat away and i hear this almighty bang and
S0255	mm
S0259	i what be that and he say
S0255	mm
S0259	what i didn't hear anything
S0259	i say well it just sound like a bang and he think no more of it
S0255	no

S0259	patio door
S0255	yeah
S0259	yeah it be and that be what the i the bang be
S0255	yeah
S0259	so he say oh we'll put it out its misery i say no i think it's alright it just
S0255	probably just a bite stun
S0259	bite concuss or shock
S0255	yeah yeah
S0259	he say well we can't leave it there because er
S0255	the cats'll get it
S0259	yeah or another bird will come along
S0255	yeah yeah
S0259	so i sort of poke just to see if it
S0255	yeah
S0259	be cos it be still on its feet
S0255	yeah it be just like
S0259	there be feather all around it
S0255	yeah
S0259	and i'm like oh if it's damage a wing
S0255	yeah
S0259	it won't be able to fly so i
S0255	mm
S0259	sort of poke it and it sort of
S0255	yeah
S0259	as you do when you've just headbutt a window you know
S0259	so i say well pick it up put it in your little out bite there
S0255	yeah
S0259	put it on the floor
S0255	yeah
S0259	in a box where it can sort of see out
S0255	yeah
S0259	and then about ten minutes later we watch it and it fly off
S0255	yeah
S0259	and i i say to him yeah
S0255	yeah don't think just
S0259	cos he be put it out its misery i say no it's probably just
S0255	yeah well give it a chance yeah
S0259	yeah just shock but
S0255	yeah
S0259	hell of a bang
S0255	yeah
S0259	and that's what it be
S0255	yeah
S0259	it it must and i say to him you can on my patio door cos i sometimes get bird do that
S0255	yeah
S0259	so i put some like fluorescent sticky butterfly
S0255	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0259	transparent they be
S0255	yeah
S0259	so i've stick them
S0255	yeah
S0259	and then when they see them they think there's something there and they
S0255	yeah
S0259	turn around and go the other way
S0255	yeah
S0259	but it stop them headbutt the window
S0255	we have that at the the last house we be at
S0259	so he say he would get some but i dunno if he will or not
S0255	at the last house we be at we have erm i have sort of gold again gold ones that you stick metal gold ones like that
S0259	mm
S0255	and you get just stick them on the windows they look quite nice anyway
S0259	yeah they do yeah
S0255	but yeah just stop a bite cos even on this one occasionally we've have doves fly into this one cos
S0259	have you
S0255	there's load of collar doves all round here
S0259	they're quite heavy bird ain't they really
S0255	yeah and then you you get the when they've go you've get almost like the outline of the bird and the the oil off its feather it's like doosh
S0259	which yeah it's like a it's like a cartoon thing
S0255	yeah ah there's a bird
S0259	cos they're quite heavy really
S0255	yeah
S0259	yeah
S0255	oh yeah we've get a couple time you come you think oh yeah someone someone's try to come in and but maybe it's cos of all the plant on the windowsill
S0259	i dunno what it be cos i say
S0255	no
S0259	to him it get a a colour little
S0255	yeah
S0259	green bite here so
S0255	have it
S0259	yeah so
S0255	be it a small bird then
S0259	yeah really about that big
S0255	oh right
S0259	very tiny yeah it be on its
S0255	mm
S0259	own like but
S0255	see i i could be all knowledgeable now and go oh it would be
S0259	mm
S0255	well would do cos he know load and load of bird
S0259	i use to know them years ago but
S0255	yeah
S0259	forget it now
S0255	no i think it be i think it be his grandad use to be into bird and he sort of learn them from him i know his dad definitely be
S0259	a little house marten or something like that d'you know what i mean
S0255	yeah
S0259	but it fly off anyway i say
S0255	yeah
S0259	it be probably just a little bite shock just give it ten minutes
S0255	oh yeah
S0259	well i say well stick it in there
S0255	well that's like like you say you know you headbutt a window and you you're gonna feel a little bite
S0259	mm it be just like the feather be all over and i be think oh he's probably damage his wing
S0255	yeah
S0259	he's not gonna be able to fly but
S0255	mm
S0259	it be it be alright
S0255	i i rescue a baby sparrow when i be a kid i find it find it on
S0255	be go down into town i must've be about ten or something like that walk down into town and i saw this little baby sparrow and i think ah and it you could see it be obviously injure or something so i pick it up i didn't go into town go walk all the way back home with it
S0259	oh
S0255	so i present it to to my mum and dad er like look i've find this little baby sparrow
S0255	and i have it inside my jacket and little baby sparrow erm and i i show them it and they be like oh mum say well i don't think gonna last and dad be oh no no come on we'll we'll see let's see and
S0259	mm
S0255	so get a shoebox and put lot of soft stuff in it and then start cos obviously then you couldn't just go on the internet what d'you do when you find a baby sparrow
S0259	well no you know
S0255	so then we think we'll actually may be able to try it and dad say we ought to try and fee it bread with some warm milk and water
S0259	mm
S0255	to do that so i be do a bite of that and i be slowly feed it and i be think i be gonna save this little baby and erm a bite later you could actually see it have it be all cut here but it it couldn't
S0259	oh no
S0255	and so obviously something have get it
S0259	yeah
S0255	a cat or something and it have actually you know so it wasn't go to survive but you know and i be all upset
S0259	oh
S0255	and mum and dad be say but at least it have a nice life sort of you know a few hours of its life and then
S0259	as they do parent
S0255	yeah and i make we have to bury it we bury it in the garden bloody sparrow go in the bloody bin ruh ruh ruh
S0255	oh it be my bird ruh ruh ruh
S0259	you do that when you're little though wouldn't you
S0255	yeah yeah
S0259	oh dear silly
S0255	but just funny i love that advert on the telly the one with the erm i think it's the rspb so it's for the for bird but it's the erm get nature into your garden it's the girl that go out
S0259	oh it's oh yeah she do don't she yeah
S0255	and she build all the ant hotel and put ant hotel on it and the hedgehog tunnel and
S0259	that's right yeah
S0255	if you build it they will come i think that's just so it it be good cos it you think what can we do
S0259	yeah cos she have them rock don't she
S0255	yeah
S0259	that she lift them on put things underneath
S0255	yeah
S0259	and put it down
S0255	yeah that's it
S0259	cos they get right under it don't they
S0255	yeah and it's really good get kid to do it
S0259	mm
S0255	because
S0259	cos nature's decline as well innit
S0255	yeah it be isn't it
S0259	bird yeah bird
S0255	it be and i think you can if you can get kid in and this be why we think with er you know the the bird food out there cos it's nice yes it's nice for us to watch but actually
S0259	mm it's help though isn't it
S0255	yeah you wanna you wanna keep the bird go that's another reason we the the plant we decide cos originally i dunnno if you remember that be just a just a fence there be nothing out there
S0259	it be yeah
S0255	so we get the acer tree which be down here and we have a different one erm that you could see through 's bedroom window but that die we have that a few years with pink flower but then we just keep look at that fence and think what shall we do and have ideas of light and water all sort and i be go let's start small you know cos he's always like oh we could do
S0255	yeah so that's when we think at least get something and have the idea of this hedge cos i think 's get it at the bottom of his garden cos she say you get the flower on it you get the berry on it
S0259	that's right you do yeah
S0255	and it it's grow really fast but it's never gonna go too big and we just keep keep it about that sort of
S0259	that's right yeah
S0255	height and can chop it back a bite but yeah it's it's ideal and then say get more and more little bird box in there
S0259	that's just the job innit there
S0255	think one of the ones there be one that make at at school and you can't really see it next to the the the the letter one that get just to the right of it she make it at school and it's get a really tiny
S0259	oh i can see it yeah
S0255	yeah tiny little hole in it and actually make the hole bigger think something you know give more chance cos people look at it or people bird
S0259	bird yeah
S0255	but it's so tiny and i think maybe it'd do for a wren or something but we're not likely to get
S0259	yeah cos i like some of them like many hole don't they
S0255	yeah this be it but i think we're not necessarily gonna get a wren here
S0259	cos sometimes they build the nest so high up
S0255	yeah
S0259	you've gotta watch that the little ones don't fall out
S0255	mm mm
S0259	cos they do
S0255	mm
S0259	if the hole be too big cos they do fill
S0255	yeah
S0259	quite deeply in them don't they
S0255	mm
S0259	sort of thick and then they get in the middle don't they
S0255	yeah
S0259	so
S0255	yeah
S0259	but er yeah
S0255	yeah
S0259	it's amaze to watch them how clever they be
S0255	yeah
S0259	nature's funny i think it's like the other day when you be on about that spider
S0259	make that web
S0255	yeah
S0259	it's just
S0255	oh it yeah exactly
S0259	it be just so clever to watch how it
S0255	yeah
S0259	do it
S0255	oh i know
S0259	and it's
S0255	i know
S0259	so fast innit
S0255	yeah yeah
S0259	from the shape of it
S0255	mm
S0259	it be clever to watch
S0255	yeah and it that's what get me with nature be how how do they know by instinct
S0259	mm
S0255	what to do you know they they just
S0259	that's right no one teach them do they
S0255	know they just know and erm bird and things emigrate and
S0259	mm
S0255	how do they know yeah some of them get up up to australia
S0259	that's like in the morning they have the geese on there at norfolk
S0255	mm oh yeah
S0259	martens
S0255	yeah
S0259	something it's call and there be thousands of them
S0255	mm
S0259	just sit there
S0255	yeah
S0259	in the water
S0255	yeah
S0259	like a er like the well just like a big lake really
S0255	yeah
S0259	and i be wait for them to
S0255	yeah to go
S0259	fly off
S0255	yeah
S0259	normally they're go by now but cos it's still so mild
S0255	yeah
S0259	so people up there wait because they
S0255	yeah
S0259	do this v formation
S0255	yeah that's right yeah
S0259	and because this year there's thousands of them
S0255	yeah it's be a really good year for the breed hasn't it
S0259	when they take off it's
S0255	it's gonna
S0259	gonna look like a big jet plane
S0255	yeah yeah yeah
S0259	that's what they say so thousands of people be camp out there wait for them to leave
S0255	well say that yeah yeah
S0259	but it could be another few weeks yet because it's still mild
S0255	yeah but but that need once it start get colder that's when they go
S0259	we always know when it get that cold
S0255	yeah
S0259	cos you can sit in
S0255	yeah
S0259	my live room you can hear them fly over
S0255	well we see them they practise here
S0259	oh now the cold weather's come
S0255	erm yeah we see them sometimes practise and when we're at the lake as well cos they go they there's
S0259	mm
S0255	quite a few round there and you see them go and you can see the like the vs with
S0259	yeah
S0255	little gap and things and they're rah rah rah it's
S0259	it's clever innit though
S0255	they're go leave a bite
S0255	yeah i know yeah
S0259	because there's so many
S0255	mm yeah
S0259	they'll obviously they'll broadcast it and they'll show it on the news when it happen i would've though
S0255	that's the same yeah yeah oh say that he say
S0259	there's thousands of them
S0255	at at the hull where he's work at the moment he be say that there's erm there's there be load and load and he say there be all load of different little be all fly over the humber
S0259	yeah
S0255	he say there be thousands again
S0259	mm
S0255	he say they be just and it be like so many he say it be just amaze
S0259	yeah
S0255	absolutely amaze
S0259	i bet
S0255	mm
S0259	it's like i've see them starlings they go on about them be you know they rob everything and steal off
S0255	yeah
S0259	the other ones but they do a formation
S0255	yes
S0259	and i've see that on the telly and that's amaze
S0255	yeah
S0259	how they sort of sway back and it go
S0255	yes
