S0422	yeah
S0421	and i've still get them to wear at home
S0423	be really cheap in there be it
S0422	and it's brand name
S0423	oh
S0421	yeah as well when they have like a sale and like we just
S0421	yeah
S0422	probably last year's design or whatever do you know what i mean
S0423	yeah
S0421	but the people who be say it probably like go for like fashionable stuff so it's probably why they don't like it
S0422	straight on say your sit nav take you all over the place
S0423	yeah it's a bite hit and miss sometimes it doesn't it just go off funny and sometimes you just think where be it take us and
S0421	and when it start spin
S0423	yeah i very rarely use it i think it need update but i can't find the er
S0422	the lead
S0423	the things i need to yeah the lead and find the the disc brake i can't i can't find the lead to plug it in so
S0421	you've have it for years
S0423	i know i i don't use it often it's just handy occasionally for somewhere earlier in the seem easier to follow that rather than a map but before that i before i go there and jot down directions and manage to get where i want to go
S0422	i'd be lose without my sit nav
S0423	well we we do erm we do google map once and we have the car for the you if you're really stick you can use
S0421	yeah
S0423	that find the sit nav on that if you've get a smartphone handy
S0422	yeah
S0421	oh yeah yeah the google map thing's quite good it's not bad
S0423	yeah it seem to be right
S0421	mm and in the olden days before you have a sit nav we be always have to stop at the roadside when we go on day trip to look at the map
S0423	we're do that we always always find our way didn't we
S0421	yeah just with a few detour
S0423	yeah what do it say turn back
S0422	i think it would tell you straight
S0423	yeah well
S0423	must have get my bear wrong
S0422	i think it be straight we don't wanna go into town oh yeah it's not take you right at the
S0422	oh i know because it let you miss that big busy road there with the fastest route
S0423	yeah there's two you can get through by go down through the centre go right somewhere
S0422	oh you've just gotta turn round so won't go in the same
S0423	oh it's turn right here be it
S0422	yeah
S0423	oh
S0423	so yeah i mean that's not a great deal to knock off the house fourteen hundred especially at that sort of
S0422	well i ask for two thousand because
S0423	oh right i think you say it be only fourteen hundred
S0422	well no because it be the tax wasn't include so i add that that be a hundred and thirty nine each
S0423	yeah
S0422	and then say fifty pound to take off the radiators you can undo yourself and you know all these extra things so i think right i'm just gonna add you on and i'm just gonna calculate because then he say if they find dampness behind the skirt board you need new ones they can supply at extra cost so i think i'd just so
S0423	but it's still it's not though it's not a massive amount so it should
S0422	it's not no
S0423	you know they wanna sell it
S0422	yeah
S0423	and then even if they say no and you might back out and then they'd have to wait months again and then the next seller might say the same thing and so i can't see them say we're not do it
S0422	somebody else can bring yeah
S0423	i mean if they might do we could say look we've we've get it price for
S0422	yeah
S0423	a low price already and i would have think
S0422	but i speak to the erm the people who do the survey you know the one i pay for
S0423	yeah
S0422	and they say no it's not as erm as not as serious as yeah
S0423	not like yeah
S0422	i mean they would put you know the language probably
S0423	over time need to
S0422	yeah
S0423	be do but it's not immediate
S0422	yeah and use but
S0423	work
S0422	yeah you know they always cover themselves in these survey aren't they
S0423	yeah they can't
S0422	in case something happen
S0423	yeah
S0422	but then when i email them i clearly say no no it's not that you know urgent
S0423	urgent
S0422	and but still if it need do and i can may er have it do now you know while it's a mess and
S0423	well yeah yeah erm

S0423	i suppose if you can't and you don't have the money and the you know
S0422	i know
S0423	you can always leave it a year or so but i guess you wouldn't wanna leave it too long it give you peace of mind or if it's get but yeah if you get that knock off you may as well have it do by so be that two kilometres on there

S0423	your bladder aren't as strong when you get older that's all it be
S0421	yeah although if i drink a lot of water
S0423	and i have be drink a lot of water
S0421	ah
S0423	and that's to do with it as well if you don't drink you won't to go will you
S0421	yeah i know yeah
S0423	if your bladder's full you have muscle that tighten and tell you you've get to go it's full
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	and then you will
S0423	it's how it work saw it on telly the other day
S0421	oh do you
S0423	so
S0421	documentary
S0421	yeah so i don't drink that much water when i'm at school because it's not i i don't have time to go
S0423	oh why not
S0421	because i've get lessons
S0423	yeah surely you can hold it for a lesson somehow
S0421	yeah no but then you don't have time to like
S0423	what you
S0421	yeah no it's not our lessons be an hour and a half and then you don't have time to go between lessons cos you've get another lesson
S0423	you have time to go surely they give time to walk to the other classroom
S0421	no it's the lesson start
S0423	in the same classroom
S0421	no the lesson start as soon as the other one finish
S0423	mm
S0421	so you have to like run otherwise you're late
S0423	i didn't wouldn't have think you be allow to run in the corridors
S0421	well no but you have to go fast
S0423	why don't you buy some rollerblade
S0421	because erm
S0423	or a skateboard
S0421	it's stupid because the teachers usually give you an allowance like a couple of minutes like while you walk to the next block or something but one of my friends have a teacher who's like if you're even like thirty second late she's like why be you late and it's really unfair
S0423	you say well there's no such thing as teleportation yet they have it on star trek but it's not exist i can't
S0423	teleport from the last classroom i've walk here
S0421	so yeah and she think it's really unfair and then
S0423	yeah
S0421	the thing be that teacher always keep them in late so then she's late to her next lesson but the other teachers be like understand but it's funny that this teacher who doesn't want you to come at all late keep them in longer
S0423	yeah but if you say well i finish my other lesson
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	at the same time this one start speak to the head teacher

S0421	er because you're oblivious ah
S0423	i'm oblivious
S0421	no as a child you just
S0423	oh right
S0421	and you're ignorant to everything and you're just like
S0423	pretty little girl
S0421	and you're just like a bumble fool and it's like who want to be in that state forever
S0423	be that what you think of yourself a bumble fool
S0421	that's what all children be
S0423	yeah but that foolishness and ignorance be bliss
S0421	i'd rather know
S0423	most people would like to go back to that
S0421	i'd rather know and keep my knowledge and keep my knowledge and everything than and be miserable in my knowledge
S0423	well what's that to do with wear a pretty dress
S0421	no because you be say why don't you go back to be like that as a young person but i like age i think it's good

S0421	and i'm like well i i don't feel restrict i've never felt restrict i always feel like i've have what the freedom to do whatever it be i want to
S0423	yeah but you come in and say oh when you be fifteen i'm off tomorrow on a flight to the other side of the world no you can't do that cos if you want to do do it now could tell you that you can't do it could they

S0421	oh right
S0423	i don't know might be stick for time she's run out of time for another conversation
S0421	well i think
S0422	you need the sit nav
S0423	well do you know the way to disable it i i think i i think it's sign it's pretty much it's straightforward
S0422	yeah
S0423	it's right i think isn't it
S0422	yeah
S0421	i think that this time in the morning be our conversation time and then we go and have food rather than have food and then have conversation time afterwards do you know what i
S0423	have to have our food in silence
S0423	be you that hungry you have to shove it down your
S0421	well no you you always make the point that oh well we've only just eat like do shall we not do else so this be the else this be the do something else and then our food time be just come afterwards because like usually we go and eat and then we go to the cinema or like last time we go to the beach
S0423	yeah
S0421	so like this be our kind of talk time and then we're gonna go and eat and then that's how it's work
S0423	oh well
S0421	so you've not really like lose anything
S0422	and she come by my shop trip as well
S0421	yeah like this be the whole idea
S0423	so leave here
S0422	mm
S0423	see that sign that that
S0422	it be this way yeah i know where we be i think i do
S0421	in fact
S0423	yeah i think it's just a straight down here
S0421	it's probably work out better for you because usually we wouldn't be able to talk we'd be sit in the cinema and you'd also have to pay for the cinema
S0423	oh yeah yeah it's be a real pleasure have these conversations with you go round the shop so we're not go to the cinema have you not get time
S0421	well i i won't now because it's far past lunchtime now and i i be erm anticipate to be have lunch around now so
S0423	so be that no
S0421	no i don't think i don't think we'll be able to
S0423	right
S0421	unfortunately
S0423	what's your schedule
S0421	what do you mean
S0423	well have you get plan things plan in like a
S0421	well i should probably do some more revision
S0422	my house and
S0423	oh
S0421	we'll do then the matter of
S0423	would this would this route not be a quicker way be this a road that you when you're busy on the way out
S0422	yeah it's not it's not this bite it's when you get to it's easier to get to
S0423	oh right yeah
S0422	erm so it's not as busy to go on a motorway and go in the where i use to live
S0423	yeah
S0422	i've do it once this way and it be awful
S0423	what be you say
S0421	erm that because i've be out now and i'm i'm go to be tire now so i don't know how much i'll be able to get do
S0423	yeah well i say to you just see how the day go do what you wanna do
S0421	i mean the plan will be to go home and do my revision but i might just go to sleep
S0423	you may as well go to the cinema as go home to sleep
S0421	but i don't know like it's the intention that matter really isn't it
S0423	er there's a couple of new film out do you look them up
S0421	no because you read you read me the synopsis
S0423	one's call tomorrow world
S0421	tomorrow land
S0423	tomorrow land be it
S0421	yeah
S0423	erm george clooney's in that base on there's a girl who's look for a a city in the future
S0421	yeah i mean that one sound quite good but it's over two hours
S0423	yeah there's another one about er an earthquake in california san andreas it might be good to watch because it's in 3d you know
S0421	have you see that erm i just saw it the other day on the internet in india they do a seven d experience
S0423	seven d
S0421	i don't know i don't know why they
S0423	do they come around and slap you on the face
S0421	no i don't know why they've call it seven d but wow it's like i watch
S0423	be it
S0421	it's like you stand in the middle of a room
S0423	yeah
S0421	and they've get like animals that walk around you but they're not real animals but they look so real and they're like projections but
S0423	oh do they have these things like virtual reality
S0421	no no but they no cos they're just these people stand in the middle of the room and erm there's these animals walk past them and then there's like a dolphin that swim through the floor and it's obviously not there but it look so real if you look it up it's in india dubai or somewhere they do it
S0423	dubai
S0421	yeah
S0423	that's not india
S0421	where's dubai
S0423	dubai be erm
S0422	arab
S0423	it's an arabic
S0421	well it cos there be one it say it say dubai but then when i look it up it say er theatre of india or something so maybe they do it in india as well
S0423	maybe that's what it maybe it's like it like
S0421	oh maybe yeah but yeah
S0423	it do sound like something more dubai than india cos it's dubai's quite modern
S0421	well yeah i i saw i saw a clip and i be just like they have a tiger and they have erm an elephant and then they have this like dolphin swim through the floor and it be just like it look so real it's like
S0423	oh so it's probably like your rather than on the screen
S0421	yeah yeah yeah dunno why
S0423	have you imax
S0421	yeah
S0423	the screen
S0421	the the good ones be you know like where it's make for 3d
S0423	and
S0421	and it's like a 3d experience like when we saw that dinosaur thing and like when i go with school we watch erm like one where there be like fish swim and it felt like you be swim with the fish
S0423	yeah
S0421	that be good but then when you
S0423	so do you remember that one we go to in the space centre
S0421	the oh the planet one where you like lie back
S0423	yeah
S0421	yeah that be good yeah
S0423	i dunno what they call that
S0421	like those ones be good but then when you just go and see like a film on the 3d it's not like 3d be it
S0423	no well it be you can see it have more depth
S0421	well yeah no but it's not like it's 3d 3d
S0423	but also you don't where you kind of come out and you
S0421	yeah
S0423	so we're not go today then
S0421	i don't think so i don't know
S0423	fifty along here
S0422	well that's to
S0423	i bet your mum's look forward to come over
S0422	yeah
S0423	it's be a while i bet since you've see them be it
S0422	erm
S0423	a few years be it since
S0421	be it be it years
S0422	last do she come last year
S0421	have she actually i cos she didn't go to the no she didn't go to the oh she help us move to
S0422	so two years yeah
S0421	yeah
S0423	two years ago
S0422	doesn't seem like it cos she's always on skype
S0421	i know yeah
S0423	actually your mum be the one that be more recently it's your dad that hadn't be over for a long time
S0421	yeah now and now he's be over for a lot
S0423	yeah
S0421	but yeah we talk to her so often it's just like it's like she's never leave
S0423	yeah so
S0422	really excite
S0423	skype be good isn't it
S0422	yeah
S0421	but yeah she's be look forward to come over for like the past i don't know like she's have her case pack for months
S0422	baby's
S0421	she just keep buy stuff and it's like we don't need that
S0422	excite isn't she never could
S0421	yeah
S0423	be your brother just
S0422	yeah
S0421	yeah it'll give her something to do i think she get bore
S0423	yeah she'll she'll be keep busy here
S0421	it'll give her some purpose back in her life
S0423	well that's the thing when you retire isn't it it
S0422	yeah
S0421	i could think of plenty of ways to fill my retire life
S0421	well i mean hopefully i'll be able to get a really enjoyable job so that i won't want to retire but if my job's bore then i'm go to be look forward to my retirement as soon as that start
S0423	you don't have to stick with one job for the rest of your life do you
S0421	i know but they might all be bore i don't know i might like work i think it's probable that i'll enjoy work more than i've enjoy my education
S0423	it's the same for most people but i think you you like academia to like
S0421	yeah i do i well i like i like learn but i don't like the system i feel it's very restrictive i want to do my own learn i want to learn what i want to learn and do my own study
S0423	well it's a bite more like that at university
S0421	yeah maybe i'll just well i'll maybe i'll do a phd and then i'll be like a a professor
S0423	yeah why not
S0421	and do research i don't know cos to be a professor you have to teach others and i don't know whether i want to do that i don't really want to teach others
S0423	well you just have to i suppose if you're not sure what you do wanna do just try to get your best mark and your study and then take it from there
S0421	i'd like to have phds away when either way though
S0423	why so we all have to call you professor
S0421	well well you can't you can't be professor unless you teach but i will be doctor
S0423	why would you like to have a phd just so you you know
S0421	well because i don't like it just seem like good because you can just er do it for a year on whatever you want erm and like if i'm gonna be do my own research about stuff anyway i might as well get a phd out of it
S0423	and can you do that while you're work
S0421	erm yeah you can do it part time yeah but you don't get a loan for it
S0423	mm
S0421	you don't get a loan for a master either you've just gotta pay it
S0423	really
S0421	mm mm i think so they might give you a bite i don't know i don't think they do though
S0423	like what what's that seven thousand a year
S0421	no it's probably nine thousand again everything's nine thousand now
S0423	be it just would you just how many years would you study for it just like an extra year
S0421	yeah master be another year and then a phd be another year
S0423	so it's quite it's pretty expensive to isn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	if i've get to already have a good job
S0421	yeah because like erm when i be go round they be like oh yes many of our students choose to stay on and do master and phd full time and i'm like oh i wonder which ones those be the ones with lot of money
S0423	well there be something in the paper a while back i don't know if i tell you there be just a bloke who who want to do his master and er be accept and to a point they realise he didn't have any money in the bank say well how be you gonna afford to to live i think he could pay for the the course
S0422	yeah
S0423	but they say to do this course you need we expect you to have this much money in the bank so say what what be you go to do to to live and he say well i i have a job part time
S0421	yeah
S0423	and he have some money say oh that's not enough and cos he supplement reject him for that reason but i think he take them to court or something
S0421	oh right
S0423	and i think he but i think they have some rule then you have to have so much all of your live cost the bank and they decide how much you have to live on
S0421	what
S0423	it seem ridiculous that it's not really any of their business
S0421	yeah that's weird
S0423	yeah so say that you you're not to be do anything else just your master and not you have to have all your money ready to live on
S0421	yeah i know that like some place encourage you like i know at they be like oh it's it's best not to have a part time job
S0423	mm
S0421	er just to focus on your your study and stuff but i'd say that most universities be like oh it's okay to work and study at the same time
S0423	yeah i think so many students do they have to like that don't think there's any so when when do you know where you're go and everything what you you have to wait till you get your result
S0421	no i know i'm go now cos i'm unconditional
S0423	right but when when you get have you have like do they give you like a formal offer or anything
S0421	yeah i've have it
S0423	oh right right so can you not be you not gonna start so sort out your accommodation now
S0421	well it they they do it all at the same time it'll be in june it open and then you apply for it
S0423	well well how can the other students who haven't have the offer
S0421	they can't apply for it yet either
S0423	no how can they do it in june
S0421	oh well they apply for the accommodation
S0423	yeah
S0421	erm because by make it your firm it's like the assumption that yes you're go to get the grade you're gonna go there
S0423	what so you can still you get it sort in advance
S0421	yeah like so everybody you you you treat it as though yes you be go there like you expect to get those result
S0423	yep
S0421	erm and then if you don't then obviously you sort out your accommodation for the other university
S0423	yep i don't understand how it it seem quite complicate they must oversubscribe them cos not everybody's gonna get the result be they
S0421	yeah
S0423	but then if everybody the result
S0421	but then
S0423	they won't have any place
S0421	yeah i i don't know how they do it because there'll be people who've get it as like their insurance so like the second choice so then if they fall through from their first university they'll go to so i assume it work as though the people who didn't get into so the room will free up and then the insurance people can go in that one but i don't know how they get it to fit so neatly
S0423	yeah i guess that's why they've have ucas be it ucas do all the if somebody doesn't have a place or a university have get place or
S0421	yeah they sort they sort out the place and everything but like the university do the accommodation and they guarantee you accommodation
S0423	for the first year
S0421	for the first year if you're if it's your firm choice so
S0423	so you decide on what you want yet
S0421	erm yeah i i'm i probably want i want my own bathroom
S0423	yeah
S0421	because
S0423	but be you gonna have a share kitchen
S0421	yeah yeah yeah
S0423	where be we go here
S0422	straight on
S0423	it say straight on to doesn't it not
S0422	no no straight on
S0423	so you're not gonna have you your own erm completely private place
S0421	no but i'll have my own bathroom that's er important for me
S0423	and how much be that a year
S0421	well it it actually vary like depend on which one you get
S0421	cos you'll apply for it and it's like within a range
S0423	mm
S0421	erm and it could be more or less
S0423	oh right
S0421	because you have to put your two options in i think
S0423	mm
S0423	do you
S0421	yeah so you have to say this be my first choice
S0423	oh right
S0421	but if that's not available this be my second choice but they have quite a lot of en suit so i can't see why i wouldn't get an en suite the one i ask for
S0423	er do you hear about those students it be on the news about the legal drug end up in hospital
S0421	oh i saw that on the er on the internet
S0423	students yeah
S0421	yeah
S0423	government be try to find a way to make them illegal
S0421	well wasn't it like they be like mix with something and then they get
S0423	well well no it it well i didn't i didn't read i only catch a
S0421	oh right
S0423	i hear in the background didn't hear about it in detail er but what have they mix different things have they
S0421	i think whatever they take be mix with something what i don't know
S0423	oh right well that's the point these legal these legal highs they call them cos it say on the package so they can get around the law
S0421	yeah
S0423	not for human consumption
S0421	oh right
S0423	that cos of the stuff they've get in them and it's all you know there's a hundred odd people die in this country take them
S0421	yeah
S0423	so the government be try to find a way to stop it legally but they i guess they can't be prosecute because on their on the package it say not for human consumption
S0421	oh yeah
S0423	be they be drug and that's they be
S0421	yeah
S0423	erm and they they be you don't really you don't really know what's in them
S0421	well yeah no yeah put anything in them put cyanide in them
S0423	well probably with that it's
S0421	there might be
S0423	well you never know yeah you're buy from these
S0421	and if say do not eat and then they'll be like oh look this person's die they have cyanide be they poison oh well it say do not eat and they eat it
S0423	well i've i've hear some of them have plant grow or something
S0421	yeah
S0423	it's the same chemicals and that but you don't wanna be ingest plant do you
S0421	no
S0423	so you need to be careful when you're at university you'll be come across people that might be try to encourage you to try this stuff you know
S0421	and you think i'd be stupid enough to say yes
S0423	no i'm only say it because
S0421	if i don't even drink if i don't even drink
S0423	well i know you won't but you may be in a situation where you think oh well you know i might give it a go or something
S0423	cos you cos maybe other people be encourage you well why why do you think i don't think you would but
S0421	ah
S0423	it's worth talk about it because you never know do you well this take into
S0422	no and then
S0423	yeah it's nice out now isn't it a nice day for a walk on the beach
S0421	mm it's all these weak will people who get force into it
S0423	and on top of that there'll be people that be have illegal drug as well and say oh try this
S0421	oh yeah
S0423	no i'm just say you wouldn't it so and if you're tempt and do anything like that make sure you let me know
S0421	if i'm tempt
S0423	well you know it's silly to do stuff like that isn't it but
S0421	it's silly it's life ruin you might as well have you might as well die than take drug
S0423	well you know i think you'd have that opinion and i can't see you do it but you know i'm just say that we'll cross that
S0421	in there be a big thing in one of the park or something they find all these like dealers have be hide their drug in the park and the police find them recently
S0423	well that's the isn't it
S0421	i know yeah
S0423	and with you say you don't drink in lessons if you're do exams or your lessons and that you make sure you're well hydrate beforehand
S0423	well you know because doesn't affect you
S0421	well i take water into the exam with me
S0423	you're not i know you drink a lot of water anyway so you want to be well hydrate because you can get headaches if you're dehydrate can't you i'm not say you should drink load so you go to the toilet all the time but i i think more than most people you'll prefer drink water
S0421	cos i don't drink anything else
S0423	you be i think you must be very well hydrate
S0421	cos other people have like juice and tea and coffee but i don't like that so i just i just drink water
S0423	better
S0421	because like juice and stuff doesn't actually really hydrate you
S0423	i can't believe may have turn into it's normal i can't believe you're come from this lovely town to
S0422	i can't wait to leave
S0423	well i know you don't like it but i know you don't have a lot of choice as well but it be it be nice here
S0422	i'd never come back here even if i could
S0423	why be you just bore here or be it the people that
S0422	people i suppose and it's what happen here and erm i don't think i'm i'm not ready to retire here there's nothing around the sea and all the old people i miss go into galleries i miss i've be miss it ever since i move
S0423	well there's a new art centre in now call i think the government put about seventeen million into it gallery
S0422	i remember when they have a and you know you it use to be just a train ride away and from there to here it's like there's nothing here charity shop and coffee shop and
S0423	it depend what you want isn't it some people want the city kind of thing but
S0422	i'd rather go to
S0423	that galleries
S0422	well there never use to be much in it maybe they update it now but when i use to go there use to be all day and so
S0423	mm
S0422	i don't know if they erm must have update it
S0423	you do see them advertise like exhibitions that they have just have exhibitions just on the
S0422	i never like ever since we we move here even when we be rent we only move here because of the job
S0423	mm
S0422	have get erm i don't like this kind of whatever i don't like it just real people normal people and they think that somehow because they're think that
S0423	i didn't think people be like that here
S0422	they be
S0423	they're a bite stick up then
S0422	narrow mind as well cos some of them don't go anywhere which mean some of them some of er 's friends have never be to in their life can you imagine that
S0423	well i can understand you'd get like that
S0422	well i can't understand it
S0423	because it's very insular and you just stay in here
S0422	never travel on a train a fourteen year old girl never travel on a train that be in today's world i've get nothing in common with this kind of people how many time have now ever since i come to this country
S0423	mm you live in one house all your life
S0422	yeah i think i must have move every two years or something longest be a be a school
S0423	yeah that's probably slightly yeah these light
S0422	yeah and if you ask people you know who work not retire how many time do they go on a beach cos never
S0423	no
S0422	i mean old people do it and erm do it and then people who have get a dog
