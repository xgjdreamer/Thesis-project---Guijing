S0653	well i might treat you guy to see it
S0655	i'd probably prefer to see it on dvd
S0653	no it's nice to go to the cinema but they'll probably have on the cinema in the cinema they will have other film that will be cheaper cos they'll have a special half term ones so if we want to go see something from that we might do that but i might as a special treat take you guy to the cinema for the chipmunks film but be there anything else that we so we're do swim we're probably we're go to see and on tuesday and we're go to see er and on tuesday for a little bite as well
S0655	what about
S0653	and there's the well he's work there's the pancake race erm at the village hall which we've never be to actually don't do that but 's mum win last year she beat erm 's mum and be really cross about it apparently and children can enter so you
S0655	so what's the race
S0653	so it's similar to the school you know when you do the pancake toss at school
S0655	mm
S0653	so i don't know if this be with the actual pancakes or with a beanbag or whatever but you have to run across the car park obviously the cars be not do anything
S0654	yeah
S0653	with with a fry pan and you have to to oh it must be a pancake a real pancake and you have to toss the pancake all the time
S0654	oh mum i've hear something about i be in i be learn about it
S0653	sorry sorry you be on holiday
S0654	in no in
S0653	in where
S0654	but i
S0653	what's that
S0654	i don't know it's a country in england
S0653	it's a in where
S0654	england
S0653	no this be england this be the country in but in where
S0653	i've never there isn't a place that exist like that
S0654	no it be no it be a long long long long long long time ago
S0653	oh oh okay
S0654	and not that long ago a woman erm be make pancakes when she hear the church bell not want to
S0653	when she hear the church bell yes
S0654	and not want to be late she run with the pancake and have her apron and that's why in they have a race and it mean you must toss the pancake three time they wear like hat scarves and the and the person who win erm get a kiss from the vicar
S0654	and erm
S0653	i love that
S0654	reach it first
S0653	yeah
S0654	before you win
S0653	so that must be in a village or a town
S0654	yeah
S0653	so do you learn that at school
S0654	mm
S0653	that's a cool story so be that why we all do pancake
S0654	and also
S0653	mm
S0654	there's another thing a long long time ago a long time ago like if the oldest daughter must toss a pancake and if she if it flip over and she catch she'll be marry if she doesn't she'll never be marry if it do if it fall on the floor she doesn't catch it she'll never be marry
S0653	crikey that's a bite sad isn't it
S0654	yeah and harsh so they'll have to run away on pancake day won't they
S0653	what if they do that one year but the next year they be successful be that okay or do they only get one chance
S0654	they only get one chance
S0653	oh
S0654	so then the the next daughter then the next one after that
S0655	so they could so they'd have to move to a different town
S0653	i don't think they would make them move to a different town
S0655	no they would have to move to get marry
S0654	no they won't they're go to say mum i'm not i'm gonna get marry
S0653	maybe they would try and get marry still
