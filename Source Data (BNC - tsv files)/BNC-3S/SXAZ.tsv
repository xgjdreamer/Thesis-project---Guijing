S0012	cos i cut mine with that you see
S0008	yeah
S0012	excite and when you go you can go over the top of the hedge
S0008	yeah
S0012	and cut cut it down with it
S0008	when
S0012	and cut it like that as well
S0008	yeah
S0012	and then when you've do all that you come up that way and cut it that way you see
S0008	yeah i'll probably one and cut the back
S0012	yeah
S0008	i think that'd be easier but hard work
S0012	they're heavy old yeah
S0008	well the thing be they should
S0008	yeah well you you sort of get it you can get it balance
S0012	yeah
S0008	so that it tights away and all you do be swing it back
S0012	that's it yeah
S0008	but the trouble be be that you can't you know it's all
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	but you know to get it right at the top you then gotta lift it up and go all the way to sort of any more
S0012	yeah that be no i i that take me quite some time to do that
S0008	yeah but the thing about mine be that they're single bar so you get they're hang all they're hang all in the bar
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and it's much more balance rather than hold it there and
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	it's all sort of in the end of the
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know sort of and and also you can when you're up the ladder you can get hold of the bar
S0012	oh i see
S0008	and you get hold of the you know the hand of
S0012	yeah
S0008	and it's all balance of that other end so you can move it
S0012	yeah
S0008	by it rather than take it out
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you're drop down and stuff you know
S0012	yeah yeah yeah that's fine i'll i'll get it from you know
S0008	yeah i know cos i have them again this week
S0012	do you oh i didn't know
S0008	yeah
S0012	oh right
S0008	yeah and i get hedge trim
S0012	anyway i be cut the hedge off and then i come across this long nest
S0008	yeah
S0012	yeah of course but er i finish with it and then
S0008	mm

S0008	they're at the back of my garden where they er the school be a place at the back they plant it they lay the hedge

S0008	couldn't i get rid of them so i get rid of them then the next day the plant they lay a hedge and every year i go up and cut them my side
S0012	but they don't cut
S0008	but they don't cut their side no it's all grow up quite tall

S0012	be it eight i think it be six foot if you get another green hedge
S0008	yeah no i think be eight for
S0012	be it alright
S0008	yeah
S0012	well that's pasty oil
S0008	but they er anyway i drop my message ask about trim the top
S0012	mm
S0008	i'll put an act to them that if they let it get overhang
S0012	yes
S0008	there's there'll be there isn't gonna be a way to deal with it
S0012	no
S0008	you see it's the fact that they
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	keep it on top of them and trim it but i think it they do about three years ago
S0012	yeah but they
S0008	well i don't know like there's a
S0012	oh yeah of course
S0008	come in at the weekend and you know
S0012	yeah cos they can't afford to pay for it
S0008	no
S0012	oh the news this morning small of that angle of about the er eastern anglia that's it norfolk especially be er suffer really bad with
S0008	yeah
S0012	ashwood be what they call it
S0008	yeah i know what you mean no sign of it in my garden
S0012	well that happen but i've never have it
S0008	but
S0012	do it very well but there's not much really but er alright
S0008	well i'll have to check out for wood there's a lot of ash tree and well i've have this ash tree in my garden and that've grow about this tall and that explain the two plant which've grow up well pretty tall
S0012	yeah
S0008	and they think it be die by it and i think oh be that ash
S0012	no no
S0008	there be no sign that it be
S0012	no cos it
S0008	but the rest of it suddenly spray out and that's grab
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	so i don't know what really
S0012	yeah well if it er we do get well i suppose that's
S0008	well i think that that only attack the of the the grind tip
S0012	yeah yeah that's right
S0008	so the rest of it should be alright
S0012	say that er mature tree they get they'll get all the problems or that might kill them in fifty years' time
S0008	mm well that's right i mean a lot of these things be like they get resistant to these things
S0012	yeah that's right yeah i mean they get ash tree not ash tree er almond tree and they would grow up in kent somewhere
S0008	yeah
S0012	anyway
S0008	that's right yeah especially resistant
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos they sort of find all ground where they've survive and
S0012	yeah
S0008	and clone them and they then
S0012	that's right
S0008	they're come back up well no i don't really cos they're two three four big

S0008	i mean it don't take long to get up there
S0012	no it don't know they're
S0008	just pop over and chop that off now and then i think nah that's on the north side so that's alright it's not
S0012	yeah but i mean when when you that them two tree down there those ash tree there
S0008	yeah
S0012	yeah and i mean i pick up cos i l i have a whole load of rubbish there but i pick up this bite of er er them two ash tree be break up

S0008	yeah and so cos there're sycamores
S0012	yeah
S0008	there's a suspend thing and this they just come about christ
S0012	yeah they do don't they yeah
S0008	and if you think about it really you only need two or three on to survive
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know cos on the wrong way grow you know
S0012	you only
S0008	and there be one that be a bite annoy cos this be in the east you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	but there be one which i actually cut down and this other one which they start cut down cos you know they're either
S0012	yeah
S0008	they start cut down into the trunk even then they leave it and and they sort of grow big enough
S0012	that's
S0008	they manage to survive
S0012	yeah i know they're horrible things aren't they wasn't that the wood be the the wood be fairly hard innit
S0008	the sycamore
S0012	yeah
S0008	that's isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0008	yeah
S0012	but i don't know how to snap but when i do though
S0008	mm they like get that black spot don't they
S0012	oh horrible
S0008	you know like
S0012	and rust down the leave and all all awful
S0008	yeah and they aren't pretty be they like the trunks and that
S0012	no they be not
S0008	you know
S0012	no so i get two down there i'll cut them down this christmas this year
S0012	they're ruin my fence just cross the fence and then that's it
S0008	mm
S0012	but that might make good wood next year cos it don't take long to all that stuff do it
S0008	no
S0012	not next year
S0008	not next year
S0012	well next year i can probably
S0008	well 's off again now
S0012	he work out
S0008	or maybe that commonly
S0012	he would do he's at the hospital
S0008	yeah or well have a he have a on the back
S0012	do he
S0008	yeah
S0012	oh oh
S0008	he have a round the corner
S0012	when when erm our friend who's up in and i meet he he you know
S0012	and then you can have him
S0008	mm
S0012	but they hate each other well i don't like him but i'm not you know
S0008	yeah mm
S0012	that's it only
S0008	you don't have to be buddies do you
S0012	no we don't have to be buddies but them two hate each other they detest each other and that's really stupid really you know
S0008	yeah that i know
S0012	well i mean
S0008	some people do carry a grudge don't they
S0012	yeah but most of
S0012	yeah yeah well yeah that's true mm that's true
S0008	and also what else what else be i think of i be think that as i be drive over here i don't remember about the detail but it's about two people who you'd think they're you know beyond baseball term you know
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and that er one refuse to help out the other one even though he know that they could've easily do it with no cause and result
S0012	yeah
S0008	and he say well why do people act like that
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know pretend that they can't help much
S0012	yeah that's it
S0008	and then you think well hang on a minute and this be a actually a true scenario that some time about ten years ago one person couldn't help out the other person or decide not to not to and this be ah i can't remember where it be but you know but it's like this guy you sort of think well surely that person hadn't have a grudge against anyone for all those years
S0012	or all those
S0008	and now decide not to
S0012	yeah
S0008	same idea as i be say my erm this guy use enough borrow my once
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er i'd just put a new bracket on cos the when you put it down there's a little melt bracket which be not grind
S0012	yeah
S0008	so i'd put a new one of them on and i put the new on and come back and when it come back it be burst and someone else have break up
S0012	mm yeah
S0008	and they say oh you know thank for help out okay cheerio or something and they wouldn't've label or discover that it be
S0012	well you wouldn't think they'd do it
S0008	and i think that be again
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	and then the little someone else be this bloke be help this other guy out and er this guy down and er the bloke use the stream have say to this other guy i mean i oh just give it some stick and don't bug that's only 's you know what i mean
S0012	yeah
S0008	and i be so you know of this so i i don't confront them or anything but i think that's well that's the last time you borrow anything of me that's rude
S0008	god you know it's like normally when you borrow something of somebody you treat it better than you would treat your own stuff cos your be
S0012	that's right yeah
S0008	someone's
S0012	yeah
S0008	that's the thing he just treat it he just maximum
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know cos it wasn't his he didn't have to worry about it he could just
S0012	yeah
S0008	you know this people who who hire cars
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then drive them flat out everywhere
S0012	well that's
S0008	and scream them around which they wouldn't do with their own car but because it's a hire car
S0012	well
S0008	they just treat it really badly
S0012	well on on on on television who's that bloke er they do top gear
S0008	mm
S0012	and they just talk er jeremy jeremy
S0008	clarkson
S0012	clarkson that's it he say er i don't that i'll fire this car let them know what happen to it
S0008	mm
S0012	and he'd go along the road and this lorry be come along and he have to squeeze up a bite up a side
S0008	mm
S0012	an old wooden bridge and that all the side of it and this be true he be drive and it be he be talk about
S0008	yeah well this be a bloom attitude
S0012	yeah
S0008	but it's why i find it abominable
S0012	so do i
S0008	and that as i be talk about people who hire cars on holiday get sting months later with huge bill
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos the people be say that they scratch they scratch them
S0012	i know yeah
S0008	well it go both ways didn't it
S0012	of course it do yeah
S0008	you know and when you get people who like you say hire a car pay another thirty quid extra insurance
S0012	yeah
S0008	then car
S0012	well what we do when when hire a car they be decent people in norwich of who she hire a car i can't remember who they be but they be really good people er i take photos
S0008	mm
S0012	all around the car when she hire it and i take photos again
S0008	mm
S0012	when on the day that and i take photos of it as well
S0008	mm
S0012	but they walk round the car look at it and say oh that's fine and sign it off so
S0008	mm
S0012	you know but i think well
S0008	well then at they're like that
S0012	be they yeah
S0008	yeah when you hire a van or something
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you know all the vans get scratch on them
S0012	yeah
S0008	and you just sort of point them out as you pick it up yeah yeah alright yeah yeah
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then if you have to make a big hole in it they won't worry
S0012	that's right yeah well er a van be a van ain't it
S0008	mm
S0012	that's the point and you're chuck stuff in the back and then
S0008	but at one time use in norwich there use to be this rent a wreck
S0012	do they i can't remember that one
S0008	car place
S0012	oh
S0008	it be use to be up near the airport

S0012	yeah
S0008	in case they break down
S0012	yeah
S0008	then they be they be cheap but you didn't have any of the hassle of scratch and dent
S0012	no
S0008	or anything like that
S0012	no that's weird ain't it
S0008	it's surprise they don't someone still don't do it
S0012	well it be ain't it really hello here come
S0008	job do
S0013	no

S0008	but with me if i can put off do a job i will
S0012	me too er isn't it awful
S0008	but you know she's get you know oh you know what's the time three o'clock oh i gotta do something at quarter to four oh that give me time to do
S0008	me i'd say oh i can sit down until quarter to four
S0012	yeah yeah
S0008	i can relax
S0012	sit down and relax or read a book or something
S0008	you know whereas she'd sort of think oh it's er a window of opportunity
S0012	i think of all the things i could do and then think oh i can't be bother
S0008	mm it's the same with me
S0012	i mean it's
S0008	i mean i i get to the stage now where i i can be quite busy in the morning
S0012	yeah
S0008	but time the afternoon come along
S0012	but by the afternoon that's it yeah
S0008	you know unless there's something i really wanna do
S0012	you've have enough that's right yeah yeah same here
S0008	i've pull a muscle in the back of my rib cage there

S0008	like bottom rib you know where i mean
S0012	yeah i know the place
S0008	and do you know how i do it i just go down the garden i er pull the rest of my beetroot up and i think oh i'll just whip round here with a hoe and i be just sort of hack into it with a hoe next minute i know i get i couldn't hardly move get this you know really sharp it be like when you've break a rib and it's dig in you know
S0012	yeah
S0008	and er that stop me do any hedge trim
S0012	well yeah
S0008	so that be a good excuse not to do anything for
S0012	yeah
S0008	god i be look into the price of get a new hedge trimmer and er like i say er if i get one like my old one that'd be like six hundred quid
S0012	yeah
S0008	but then they sort of sell quite decent ones for three hundred quid
S0012	yeah
S0008	or one which you think mm would probably work alright for a couple of hundred quid i sort of think well i don't really want a duff one but i don't really wanna spend the money for a really expensive one
S0012	no
S0008	there's nothing worse than have er something like a chainsaw or a hedge trimmer where which won't start
S0012	won't start no
S0008	or something like that or when it do go you know you hit something a bite hard and it just
S0012	oh that's it yeah god that be hard work do that hedge
S0008	i'm sure it be
S0012	god that be hard work that do take it out of you don't it i mean
S0008	warm day yeah
S0012	oh yeah
S0012	and the and the sun be on the other side of the hedge
S0008	mm
S0012	the sun be sun's like it be now right in your eye
S0008	mm should've cut that side first then
S0012	i should've do shouldn't i
S0012	yeah but i what happen i be do that other things and then i think
S0008	yeah
S0012	i will go and cut the hedge
S0008	that's right i will have some achievement for today
S0012	yeah
S0008	i know yeah
S0012	and say you're not be you i say yeah but
S0008	mm
S0012	the thing i hate about cut hedge like that like that one out there
S0008	mm
S0012	be you gotta clear it all away afterwards
S0008	so you don't all leave it there
S0012	i'd er i'd like to leave it there but that's all out on the on the grass out the front
S0008	yeah i know when i use to do 's hedge down at
S0012	yeah
S0008	he just say oh leave it all on the grass
S0012	do he
S0008	yeah yeah he say cut that i say well do you want me to clear it up as well nah nah leave it there that'll be alright
S0012	oh it be hawthorn
S0008	yeah
S0008	that be a thorn hedge i mean there wasn't that much come off
S0012	no
S0008	so i sort of do it every year or twice a year
S0012	oh yeah
S0012	too many thorns would you
S0008	there's plenty enough but it's quite a big wide bush
S0012	yeah
S0008	and no one walk on it apart from dog walkers and and we ignore them
S0012	yeah
S0008	and the grass tend to grow over it
S0012	yeah course it do yeah
S0008	he say no you know
S0012	yeah i couldn't i couldn't leave it out there and not only that you know in the hedge all up there and er all outside when i go out there to look at there's these great big brambles
S0008	ah
S0012	arch down
S0008	tell me about it my arm be like ribbons
S0012	yeah
S0008	cos that's why
S0012	if you leave it there you can't get out can you
S0008	and the leaf the other way
S0012	that's it yeah
S0008	and you're trap you know
S0012	that's it yeah ah and then you you cut cut it down and then you go catch between your leg
S0008	yeah and then you get it under
S0012	you get up on your legs and you can't get up oh oh god
S0008	yeah there's a job i've be do this week cos i be sort of layer my brown hedge
S0012	yeah
S0008	and i cut all the older bits it have and then the new bits and make long bits
S0012	yeah
S0008	i layer it along maybe for next year now
S0012	oh that's it yeah
S0008	and so
S0012	yeah that's it
S0012	a bite of that nice er black i've get
S0008	well
S0012	you know you get some
S0008	yeah
S0012	you know the
S0008	what that yeah yeah you
S0012	yeah i haven't put it up there
S0008	alright yeah
S0012	yeah well you get some lovely blackberry don't you
S0008	yeah yeah they're beautiful and they get
S0012	blackberry be better that big
S0008	mm
S0012	yours be nice big ones they're
S0008	well the thing about it be be that they're sort of cultivate cross road with
S0012	yeah
S0008	so i'm never quite sure what the the bits be or what to cut off and
S0012	no i know that's true yeah well let's see
S0008	well that's it with garden first of all because them like i say when you trim the bits out
S0012	yeah or they come over and themselves
S0008	yeah i can probably if they have that but
S0012	yeah
S0008	i'm not so sure of what they get if there be any i'll
S0012	yeah
S0008	but what you have to do be you have to get in there months hang in a bite
S0012	yeah
S0008	and cut the dead stuff out and then get those stuff and drag it and then tie it down
S0012	drag it yeah
S0008	so you can't get a bite stream round behind so
S0012	yeah
S0008	you put your hand through that and
S0008	get in that stream i get to make this little bite of wire
S0012	oh yeah i saw it
S0008	i put it round again so i can get it drag and then pull it back
S0012	yeah
S0008	but even so you know you get to layer the on
S0012	yeah
S0008	but then you can't tie the string
S0012	you can't tie the string no
S0008	tie one off then you need the other one to hold it back
S0012	yeah
S0008	and then you need the third end to to tie the string
S0012	oh that's so difficult and it be
S0008	very though it's the same with
S0012	yeah yeah
