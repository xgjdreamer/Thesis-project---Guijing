S0292	you'd never know it might be pure
S0293	so you learn german as well then in fact
S0292	erm no i mean i pick it up but i didn't learn it no no no no but of course i be work within as a volunteer for the british council in my off duty time and it be basically english
S0293	mm
S0292	and sadly in my sessions for the foreign
S0293	do you do sing as well at that time
S0292	no i'd give up sing at that time i pick it up again
S0292	really anything i love it
S0293	do you always plan to have a short stint in the air force
S0292	no i i didn't think plan for anything it be all luck all the way through
S0293	you have to be able to be marry
S0292	no no no i have my last year erm marry live off camp we have our first house no that be earlier but by the time that i'd come along erm you could be marry
S0293	so you didn't want to continue then
S0292	well i'd come actually yes erm if i'd go on i and i would have have to have sign on for another three years as it be because our initial commission be for eighteen years erm you could leave before that of course but i'd come to that stage and i'd meet and erm he hadn't quite propose but i know that it be come and erm i really do want to sign on for the next two years
S0282	oh but it would be so easy to get out if all you have to do be get marry
S0292	yes yes i mean
S0293	you don't need to get marry you just have to finish
S0292	you'd have to become pregnant then you would have to
S0282	oh yes
S0292	not now of course i disapprove very strongly of that because if you're a young mother in the air force or in any service and you have a child a baby you cannot put the service first and therefore your if you rush off because you've get a baby your colleagues be carry the weight and i think that's quite wrong they use to have a rule that you couldn't join if you have children under fifteen and i think that be fair after that they can fend for themselves but until that time we felt that erm career should come secondary to the child
S0282	mm it's difficult with the men really
S0292	yes i think it's just so hard it's just not fair but i mean the norm now be that they can be pregnant in the service and keep on with their career and have baby
S0282	i don't i it's that there will probably be quite a lot of litigation involve in try to police that kind of these days because if a if a soldier or an airman erm males who's male can have children then you couldn't possibly say that a woman couldn't
S0292	that's right
S0293	because they're legislation and etcetera etcetera
S0292	that's right it's just that for a baby certainly i would have think mother be essential we know very well that in america they have the most because i remember one of the women who be capture in the iraq in the kuwait war have a baby
S0282	but then i suppose i i suppose that erm there's probably more peace time enough job and be base in this country of administrative nature that that if you have a child you could be you know sort of confine to duty at some base either here or in germany or that you wouldn't have to be
S0292	no but again it could mean again that your male colleagues be take an unfair portion of work to be do it's different
S0282	uhu
S0293	see
S0292	yes he be make redundant and uh luckily erm he be a part time job in the museum erm in the and the orchestra so he be very which be lovely
S0292	yes he do he love it
S0282	and be you interest in history before that or do he get you involve in the local historical society
S0292	i suppose i be vaguely interest in that we have parent who love take us to erm i mean not but who erm not in the war but later on erm we be expect to go around the old stately home with them and this type of thing but not serious history no i wouldn't say that i'm a serious historian now i just learn enough to go as a volunteer
S0293	you don't you
S0292	uhu that's the thing i study really history that be different i mean you can't study art as you know without do a certain amount of historical background to fit the movements and the people into their social set
S0282	i mean if you're interest in art their life and who they know and who they hang out with and where they live and so then you're in a historical place without really realize it
S0292	yeah that's absolutely right absolutely right
S0282	and who do they know which other artists be they friends with
S0292	that's right and who influence them
S0282	yeah
S0292	yes yes that's right
S0282	there be an article in the paper yesterday about erm the link between houston freud and francis bacon and i hadn't i hadn't really realize that they be connect to each other
S0292	oh yes yes it's important
S0282	and there's one particular paint which be which be erm bacon take a paint of freud's and elaborate on it and
S0292	oh
S0282	it be a self portrait but he it be a self portrait but incorporate freud's erm
S0292	oh
S0282	um sort of style and the particular thing that he have do
S0292	yes
S0282	so and i think oh that that's that could explain why sometimes i get a bite confuse about which of the two i'm look at
S0292	oh yes
S0282	i know that's a terribly heathen thing to admit
S0292	no no well certainly i paint the other but i couldn't remember which ones now
S0282	yeah but so you do know
S0292	yes yes yes it be enjoyable
S0282	be that through a local charity or local historical society
S0292	no that's through the museum
S0282	through the museum
S0292	hmm we're most of us be friends of the museum and some some of that group be also town guide there's erm a local history course that run and after two years those who that be they can become town guide if they wish
S0282	yeah new patch
S0292	no
S0293	oh
S0292	no they're not from the village so they're not quite perhaps as well train as if but
S0282	well be as widely train you have to do a whole camp
S0292	yes
S0293	's dad's a blue badge guide
S0282	yeah he study for quite a while
S0292	who be
S0293	's father
S0282	my father yeah
S0292	oh really
S0282	yeah
S0293	yes
S0282	in the west midlands
S0292	yes well i know and they have to take exams
S0282	yes he do take exams
S0292	but i mean that doesn't happen with they be ask i understand suggest they should become blue badge guide but they all run away from the study and the things yeah
S0282	mm
S0293	i think it be
S0292	oh do she
S0293	but they be all obsess most of the
S0292	mm mm
S0282	so you spend yesterday underground then
S0292	oh only two hours
S0282	oh
S0292	erm it's it's enough in there too because erm in the mid to late twentieth century i'm not quite sure of the date erm it be use as a tourist information centre and then fortunately therefore they put down pave it have be a mud floor and when it be a mud floor it be the right kind of floor and it absorb the dampness
S0282	oh
S0292	as soon as they put down the pave erm we we be have a problem of damp in the underground so you have now a dehumidifier go the whole time we be in there because there's nothing to absorb the damp
S0293	isn't it a problem
S0292	what
S0282	do you get lot of people visit
S0292	yes we always do on heritage day but i be surprise at the number in that two hours be it a hundred and fifty i think so it's non stop they pour in and you rush around say do you want any information be you go to look can i help and they all cluster around and some of them be very interest in our so call ninety nine percent medieval synagogue erm down the high street if it be erm a synagogue it will be the oldest in england
S0282	wow
S0292	we've have the experts from america and israel and erm hebrew i think it be in bristol but no documentary everything about it be discover about twenty years ago seem to link with the synagogue and they even find in one of the columns in a niche the perfect silver coin date twelve seventy and the jews be throw out of gilford in twelve seventy five
S0282	oh
S0292	and one of the pretexts as you well know erm for the massacre and throw the jews out be that it be say they shave the edge of the silver coin and amass the shave and here be a perfect silver coin deliberately stick into a niche and then this be have be partially demolish so it's not full height it be full of rubble when it be discover it have to be refill but at least all the work have be do on it and recently this person i be mention that do her doctorate on the immigrant tower she be a wonderful historian and she go to erm germany for a big historian's conference and meet some german erm historians and archaeologists there and she be talk about our so call erm synagogue and they say oh that sound an exact copy of one we have up in north germany so that be rather please to hear
S0282	yeah
S0292	so we're not sure it might be something else but it have three side of it have a stone shelf seat run around it which ours certainly hasn't because that be build as a shop so it be interest great excitement to hit the world news
S0282	yeah why be it why be there another
S0292	why because um that be presumably the norm and we know there be probably well we know we have sign of at least six of the erm high streets still and erm we believe there be twelve and in fact the so call underneath the angel hotel be in fact an really erm much ought to whereas ours hasn't be um and ours be build between twelve fifty and thirteen hundred roughly about then and erm we know it be build as a shop and we've bring side of the original stairs down just a little bite and we have the original window and an original beautiful arch little doorway which lead lead we think to erm a spiral staircase but it's that's be ruin and there's just a thing about it which suggest to the experts that it be or be intend to be a spiral staircase which if so then would have lead up to the house above
S0282	oh and be the street leveller in those days it must have be
S0292	yes not an awful lot because you see a high street be a hill
S0282	yeah
S0292	so i suspect that when the storm come it would remove some of the rubbish onto the bottom of the hill so i don't think you get quite the build up that you get in other towns which be more level
S0282	mm
S0292	i suppose the difference be about eighteen inch
S0292	and i think sometimes it's much steeper isn't it but i'm no expert i really don't know
S0282	no i don't know
S0293	barbarians
S0292	mm gosh how excite barbarians
S0282	or be it erm be it we be go to
S0282	right no oh
S0282	no well i have i get i go and apply for the scholarship when i be a teenager to go and join they be sponsor a young person to join a dig
S0292	oh
S0282	and i go to to interview but there be somebody who be gonna go off and study archaeology at university so they give it to her
S0292	oh yes i do some dig and i be it be very lucky really i it be when i be station in and get involve and our archaeologist be of all people before he go on
S0282	wow
S0292	so we go and have an interest short time in
S0282	yeah
S0292	in the service your interest be always a short time and then you be off i be put in my place because there be these leather jacket you would have think cycle on their motorbike all in stud leather but they could tell me far more about the angry saxons and cemetery dig than i could ever have know and it be a good lesson from the outside
S0282	mm
S0293	do you find it quite odd be surround by men all the time do you not miss women sometimes
S0292	erm sometimes i can remember one very funny occasion when i be in kenya and i be dress make stand gravely on the din room table as the men some of the men who live in the mess be do my hem for me
S0282	it must have be good explain i'm try to get to do that
S0282	it's lot of chaos
S0292	yes of course yes it could be and it be lonely when you be most senior because of course you can't really erm however friendly you be with your staff
S0293	so who how friends at some point
S0292	actually because of my career i don't have very many because i spend so much time do rather strange job but i be nothing to do with the wraf which suit me because i be never keen on welfare and erm so i suppose the ones i know best be when i be in charge of the wraf officer train at our joint and i have four wonderful flight lieutenants or flight commanders who be very experience and i be an absolute erm beginner really cos i have a background in intelligence job and erm they keep me on the straight and narrow we have a lot of fun
S0293	uhu what do you do in kenya
S0292	oh i be erm signal edge and cod and cypher there they think they would put a wraf section into kenya and though i have already serve in egypt for a few months and we be throw out and go to cypress where we have terrorism they think they'd put wraf to kenya so i be send down as the vanguard to be you know base the signal edge and cypher officer with the idea that i'd be there to open up when when we come this be terrorism erm but erm that never happen
S0293	why do they send young women there be that the natural course of business or
S0292	i don't know i really don't know i mean i be a fairly junior officer i be only twenty three at the time and and erm you know so i don't think i know the rationale you're just tell you're go down which be excite and erm
S0293	that be remember in egypt that time be that the
S0292	no that be i do when i be in and
S0292	it's funny look how young you be at the time i mean be what fifty six and i be in charge of the cypher office in which deal not only with the air force erm erm cod and cypher but with the government erm british government erm and i use to deal with stuff then that only the governor of the colony and the two most senior raf officer be allow to see i use to have to walk myself away from my stuff and at twenty three and the governor use to send his car oh i do love it no no number plate just a silver crown you know get big head with such
S0282	so who would you who would be your report officer if there be just you in your
S0292	well we be a headquarter and so erm there be people in the headquarter and there be somebody i think in front of the in charge of the signal centre we must have be some of it's rather vague it's awful
S0282	erm erm
S0292	you're talk about the fifties
S0282	yes yes gosh so erm so we're look backwards and you um you regret that you couldn't go to university and you always want to do it in the end think actually you know what this be as good as go to university all that i prove myself anyway and that you know through the russian and through that
S0292	i i suppose so really yes i don't regret it now because i so love my career in the air force
S0282	mm
S0292	which presumably wouldn't have happen
S0282	no
S0292	and i wouldn't have be to these excite place and so i'm a great believer that universities be essential really for an interest career and i remember one of the most effective officer i know a natural leader a wonderful person and how she get in i don't know quite rightly she wouldn't even have those days of course she didn't even have that but she be an absolute wow as a leader as a officer and erm
S0282	so somebody must have spot her talent then
S0292	yes they yes yes that's right thank goodness
S0282	absolutely
S0292	yes there be an open she end up as a kind of personal assistant to erm dear erm princess ann as the duchess of
S0282	oh really
S0292	duchess of be the head of the air force of the waf
S0282	oh i see i see
S0292	no i'm sure that's quite enough
S0282	it's it would be handy if we could get to you know the nearest
S0293	i miss the last i miss the last excite bite about
S0293	i guess you get you didn't wear out your own clothe do you in the force
S0282	do you want another ten minutes cos then it take us to three quarter of an hour
S0292	right okay i suppose that's true really i wear a uniform during the day
S0292	but they be very expensive clothe
S0293	oh you have to buy them
S0292	oh yes
S0293	oh i think you get them free
S0292	oh no i mean not even the i don't think even the other rank they be issue at first they probably be have to buy replacements maybe not but right from the begin we have to buy
S0293	oh no i think you might of at least get free uniform
S0292	oh no i mean that's that's part of be an officer i mean that's why many male officer couldn't take the degrees very different then sorry not degrees erm commission in the guard
S0282	oh
S0292	because they need such a private income to compete with the social life and
S0282	i suppose there be time when you have to bring your own horse wasn't there
S0292	yes yes but erm that that probably doesn't apply now i'm sure it doesn't apply now because things that very much more democratic even in the guard although i suspect there's still require a certain kind of person but no no you buy your own uniform and they be jolly expensive i i be very lucky when you're a little officer cadet you erm fairly on in the course you erm all the major military tailor arrive and you're expect to go around and choose one who will start make your uniform in the hope that you will eventually graduate and erm they have moss brothers and gaves and i think it be isn't it i can't remember now oh i think and all the rest and erm there be a just a little man stand quietly by himself and nobody be get up to him so i think oh poor thing so i go up to him and we get chat and oh yes yes he'd happily do my uniform and it turn out that again i i be lucky in the air force i have choose the people erm person that do all the most senior officer in every kind of field and guard officer and things and he say to me would you like a red line which be technically not really allow oh yes i say so i always have a bright red silk line in my uniform
S0282	what what do you wear when you get marry
S0292	erm oh a conventional wed dress
S0282	oh you do
S0292	oh yes
S0293	and your husband be he be he in his
S0292	he be just in the morning suit yes
S0282	oh okay
S0292	because he be a officer he wasn't full time army
S0282	gosh
S0293	do you have to clean those uniform because there wasn't dry clean be there
S0292	oh yes we've always have dry clean
S0292	i don't really know but certainly they be always dry clean
S0282	they use to damp them with something you use to damp them with ammonia or something
S0292	oh dab it off at one time but no they have to go occasionally to dry clean
S0293	wool they must have get very smelly
S0292	ah well on the well it depend where you be in germany yes it be the blue but it be in the middle east it be what they call khaki drill it wasn't drill for women it be the khaki
S0292	erm yes i mean i always have and things so i didn't wash them
S0282	what's it like
S0292	i know it seem unreal now very
S0282	no but you you do um you still have you don't wash the in the force now it it get launder i mean when my brother be in the navy they have they have an laundry department start by chinese people
S0292	that's right
S0282	so you send all your stuff to them and they boil wash everything so it didn't last very long
S0293	why
S0282	because it sort of disintegrate itself after they've boil wash a certain number of time they start fall apart the seam fall apart
S0292	wow
S0282	you wouldn't have if they be wear a white t shirt they would have to come out the same shade of white you can't possibly have people you know in different shade of white because it's wash it
S0292	yes
S0282	and the right amount of
S0293	yeah
S0293	that's that they do with the leotards right before um exams
S0282	oh
S0293	they have a set of leotards for exams and they wash them all together so that everyone's the same colour so they fade all the same time time
S0292	how interest
S0293	they obviously do that for show as well
S0292	yes i didn't know that
S0282	but if you look at a cohort of school children who be all start out on day with the same uniform and you look at them six months later
S0292	mm
S0282	there will be the ones that be fade out and wash
S0293	well it seem that they're they're permanent no that's gonna be with you know for the rest of your school career there's not much i can do about that
S0292	yeah there be something that's mean to remove ink
S0292	really oh oh
S0293	and she's not a very bright child
S0282	students
S0292	yes
S0282	it's like wait on class
S0293	yeah
S0282	perhaps she'll she'll become studious by look studious
S0282	i'm sure there's management theories as to
S0293	she's absolutely appal by they're suppose to do philosophy and er philosophy and ethics
S0292	mm
S0293	and they're not suppose to do christianity but she's get the most
S0292	oh
S0293	evangelical church teacher who's make her do all this christian stuff which drive her absolutely bonkers
S0292	really
S0293	cos she can't bear be tell what you know what to believe or what to think or whatever
S0292	mm mm
S0293	i see her point though you do think actually in a school these days it'd be pretty hard to teach a hard line christian line
S0292	yes
S0282	mm
S0292	but you see with such a mix
S0293	yeah
S0292	i'm surprise i mean er i think it
S0293	i'm sure they're not suppose to i'm er sure it's suppose to be multi religious
S0282	i didn't think they be suppose to either
S0293	no not in school
S0292	i i wouldn't have think so i mean i don't approve of them miss out morning assembly but if they've er get to miss out morning assembly the to teach hard line christianity
S0293	it's really a bite
S0292	it's really strange by all mean erm i mean i think they should learn something about christianity
S0293	well they ought ought to learn about all the main religions really oughtn't they
S0292	yes
S0293	but they certainly shouldn't have one line only
S0292	i think that's er valuable or not
S0282	well we have a re teacher who be a catholic and she wasn't allow to teach re we have to do other things in the re class because
S0292	really
S0282	she wasn't permit to to to talk to us about religion because she
S0293	but how can she be an re teacher then
S0282	cos mm
S0293	how can she be an re teacher
S0282	because well it be because re wasn't an exam subject or anything it be just something you have to do as part of curriculum so you have a lesson a week
S0293	yeah but how can she be an re teacher if she couldn't
S0282	well no because it it be kind of who be leave over for period six on a friday
S0292	mm
S0282	after you've allocate all the other things so she'd get the short straw because there be only her available to do re that term i suppose
S0293	mm
S0282	otherwise i can't it must've be her availability in that time slot cos we have quite a small school or it be four hundred people so the so the curriculum thing have always be terribly trouble
S0293	mm
S0282	because you be try to sort of you know sort of make sure that the teachers get spread across
S0293	mm
S0282	everything that they need to do so you get all whoever get the short straw get to do re
S0282	it's not like my dad who get an o level in re
S0282	he yes when
S0282	he absolutely have no interest in religion at all we wonder how he do it
S0293	mm
S0292	i don't think we even we in our age take exams our in er religious we take we have to take so many paper as you know for er in the old school and you have to pass so many at er a credit level to to to matriculate which officially give you the right to go into university erm but of course nobody ever do go in with matric but officially that be the entrance er er
S0292	oh yes you get er credit in er or as i say french but possibly it be any foreign language erm english which be grammar and literature and everything maths i can't can't remember what the other two be
S0292	maybe it be er i think
S0292	it be geography i certainly do geography and get credit but whether that be whether er they i i i suppose yes cos they do lay down all five maybe one be a science subject i wouldn't be surprise physics or chemistry or something i don't remember
S0292	but
S0282	or general science
S0293	no we didn't have general science in those days we do physics and chemistry mm
S0293	no we do we do cos that be how on earth do people have uniform during the war bear in mind there be so little material around school uniform how do they do it
S0292	well i can remember that our school uniform the summer school uniform the high school be the most ridiculous it be a pale cream dress plain pale cream
S0293	oh
S0292	and my mother manage somebody give her er a parachute that have fade
S0293	oh you could have any material pale cream
S0292	yes and she make my school uniform out of parachute silk
S0293	but how on earth would you do what what about the winter uniform do you have to wear blue er you could all just wear wear blue skirt
S0292	we er
S0293	you have to make a skirt
S0292	we have to wear well we wear gym slip and erm
S0293	be be they all the same or do you make them yourself
S0292	oh no no they be i mean they must be quite complex to make the old gym slip you know with the great wide pleat down
S0293	no no i know that but how on earth do they have the to do it
S0292	i don't know
S0293	it be
S0292	i suspect
S0282	perhaps it be the same people who make the uniform for the soldier and things
S0292	it be probably second hand i don't know i don't remember let me see how old be i be it still war time when i go up to the
S0293	er the only reason i ask be cos i know my mother
S0292	eleven
S0293	only have her
S0292	eleven
S0293	one set of clothe so i i know that you know at certain time in the war
S0292	yes ah
S0293	erm
S0292	well mm now er i be eleven when when i go up to the high school so that would be forty four so it be still war time
S0292	but somehow we have gym slip i don't ask
S0292	don't know how maybe there be special dispensations for the first school uniform
S0293	mm
S0292	and then later i remember in the sixth year we be allow skirt navy blue skirt
S0282	perhaps that's where i don't know about your school but we always have an official supplier of our school uniform
S0292	yes yes
S0282	and you could only get your school uniform from official school suppliers
S0292	that's right
S0282	so perhaps it start in the war where certain manufacturers because they be make uniform be allow to have access to
S0293	i know do you know the coupons to get them be
S0282	but not everything be on coupons
S0293	oh i see that's why she always wear that would make sense
S0282	oh
S0293	she always
S0292	yes yes and of course my mother be very good at make sew
S0282	yeah i think
S0292	yes that's right so we be never short of clothe and bless her she even keep rabbit and we eat the rabbit and she learn how to deal with the rabbit fur and make gloves
S0282	oh wow oh my word that's
S0292	yes she be
S0293	she be amaze but then women of that age be incredibly innovative and tough
S0282	yeah take sleeves out put new sleeves in turn turn the collar
S0292	mm
S0293	i do that
S0292	really yes yes
