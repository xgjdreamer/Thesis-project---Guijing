S0544	i think i must have be bear leave hand and then parent switch me over to my right
S0543	really
S0544	i think they say that yeah
S0543	why do they switch you over
S0544	because i don't know
S0543	i think i don't think you get bear leave hand
S0544	no i think apparently my dominant hand i be when i be like a baby and stuff be my leave
S0543	mm
S0544	they make me use my right
S0543	why
S0544	not sure
S0543	oh
S0542	i don't know it's it's definitely like a nurture thing though i think
S0543	oh yeah definitely i think it be
S0542	cos erm like you can train yourself like to use your other hand can't you
S0543	yeah like if erm if somebody like i break my collar bone and i couldn't use my right hand so i have to like try and draw erm write with my leave hand i mean like if they let me use a computer cos it be in primary school
S0544	additional password require
S0542	mm
S0544	i ask for more transfer fund they're will to give me this much money okay i'll accept it
S0543	that's so much money
S0544	i ask for five million though so
S0543	i hate how football they just all of this money be go around and they just take it as if it's like nothing as if it's natural to have like millions and millions of pound
S0544	well it's cos they get it well they get it from the advertise because let's face it a lot of people include a lot of football
S0543	and fifa have load of money anyway don't they
S0544	fifa be corrupt as hell though
S0542	yeah yeah
S0543	yeah they be
S0544	yeah they be yeah they be yeah
S0543	yeah they be yeah
S0544	yeah they be i think they be actually
S0543	what's a scout
S0544	what
S0543	what's a scout
S0544	they scout
S0543	be that literally it
S0542	they look for talent
S0543	be that it
S0544	yeah
S0543	well why do they need why do you need to hire an extra person to do that why can't your manager just do that
S0544	cos he's busy manage the team
S0543	well what's he do he just sit there and go in the game
S0544	no he actually do a lot he sign players he do contract
S0543	he sign players oh sorry he sign he sign his name on a piece of paper
S0544	no he look for players and like
S0543	but that's you say that's what the scout do
S0544	sorry he get the players and talk to them and negotiate and all that and try to convince them to come to the club
S0543	well what about the actual trainer cos they have a manager and a and a separate trainer don't they on the pitch
S0544	well i don't know about the trainer in this but the trainer obviously like work on fitness and stuff and manager watch more tactics and actual run of the club
S0543	eh
S0542	yeah i think there be
S0543	there's all just too much money go round
S0542	like you say like you say there's a lot of money so i guess the manager have to be in charge of all the money
S0543	yeah see look i've get finance now
S0543	no because you have owners of the club
S0544	yeah
S0543	who have the money
S0544	who just pump money in
S0542	they look they'll fund it and then he'll decide where the money get to come like be spend and stuff and different advertise deal and things
S0543	okay fair there be way too many position though in a football team
S0542	yeah i know
S0544	ah there's some position that be just ridiculous
S0542	i agree with that but then i'm not go to be like no we should ban football cos it
S0543	oh no no i'm not say that i'm just say that imagine how much money they like if they just get like half the amount of money for like everything not just like how much money they have so that like people who be disadvantage like half the money across the board
S0544	yeah yeah
S0542	what if you put in like price restrictions for like players and things like that
S0543	then no just literally just take off like half the money for everything like how much they get play how much the club earn then everyone would be at the same like it would be the same just less for everyone
S0544	the same but less
S0542	but then you'll have er like smaller team will like struggle because they can't finance their stuff
S0543	no that's why i'm say like everything
S0542	would just get halve
S0543	everything so that it's like the same it's still the same like in relation
S0542	well then what's the point in that then
S0543	because then what i'm say be if you get rid of half of that money you could give that money to something that deserve
S0544	oh leeds unite have piss everyone off
S0542	what oh what be that about leeds unite
S0544	leeds unite have do something to piss everyone off
S0542	have they what have they do
S0544	pie tax
S0542	okay
S0544	tax on pies
S0543	what
S0544	pies be more expensive at leeds unite than they be anywhere else
S0542	what what
S0544	they put tax on pies
S0543	just pies
S0544	yeah pies yeah
S0542	so the price of pies at elland road
S0544	yeah
S0542	be now a lot higher
S0544	not a lot probably a little i don't know a significant amount but not a lot
S0542	this go against everything of yorkshire
S0544	i know
S0542	a pie
S0542	and b like try to save money it's like
S0544	no
S0542	you've ruin it
S0544	he's break the system
S0542	yeah no but if you halve like the fund or like the money that all the like club get to spend
S0543	i mean like half that money you could give to charity to do things that need it that's what i'm say
S0544	money money
S0542	i know but i'm just say like if you half the money that like some of the smaller poorer team have then they might not be able to run the club and things like that
S0544	money
S0543	no that's why i'm that's why i'm like
S0542	but you're say half well then it's still worth the same they can't do as much there
S0543	that's why i'm say nothing change like it's still the same like there's still go to be higher club there's still go to be lower club so that nobody's disadvantage more than they already be
S0542	i know but they have to like pay for like the upkeep of like the stadiums and things like that and all the land and
S0543	no but that's no because everything be half everything
S0544	everything's half off for this time only
S0542	right so you so
S0543	no but like you know what i mean like it's still in proportion to everything else
S0542	no no i get what you're say but for that you'd have to like half the value of everything in the rest of the world cos it'll have like a big knock on
S0543	no you wouldn't it just in football
S0542	you would just in football so if you work in a football
S0543	so stadium and everyone
S0542	so if you work in a football organisation you're gonna get pad like a hell of a lot less like literally half than anyone else
S0543	but that's why i'm say like
S0542	so everyone will not work for football so then
S0544	it's like it's like you don't why don't you reset the system
S0543	no no no like the players and things like that
S0542	so just the players
S0544	just switch off the switch it back on again
S0543	just like fifa i don't mean like people who work at the ground or whatever cos they get pay nothing anyway
S0542	okay mm
S0543	like i mean like in
S0544	but where do you draw the line
S0543	i mean like in actual football what i'm try to say be
S0544	where do you draw the line where do you draw the line
S0542	just players players should be pay less money
S0543	shut up yeah that's what i'm try to say like they still players get pay millions and millions of pound if they halve that that's still plenty of money for them to live on
S0544	where do you draw the line one question
S0542	how would you okay no no i i agree with that but like how would you put in like legislation that say that a club can't spend this much money on a player give how like
S0544	they have salary cap in erm american football
S0543	there you go
S0542	so you want to introduce salary cap in i don't know european football
S0543	i just think players get literally the only reason i'm do this be i think that players and anyone who work in football get pay way too much and if you half that and give that money to charity they'd still have plenty of money to live on
S0542	give give fifa's
S0544	but
S0543	they'd still have millions of pound they'd still have millions of pound
S0544	but but
S0542	give fifa's corrupt nature do you think this would actually work
S0543	oh no it's never gonna happen
S0542	oh yeah no i agree with you then yeah
S0544	where do you draw the line i've work at i've work at football grind
S0543	you don't play
S0542	she's just say players
S0544	i know but i've work at football ground i work in football
S0542	but then people would be less like
S0543	no that's why i say before you don't it's not just people who work in the ground like cater
S0544	i work in football but where do you draw the line
S0543	you're just try to piss me off shut up
S0544	where do you draw the line
S0543	i make a valid point you know i do just
S0544	whoa whoa whoa whoa
S0543	it's alright i'm silence you
