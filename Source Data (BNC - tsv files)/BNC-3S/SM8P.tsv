S0172	well that's go to be make us absolutely dry make us dry up
S0173	um so what be this that we're have
S0172	we're have um stuff beef tomatoes stuff pepper and that's it
S0173	okay
S0172	and vegetables so help yourself to the vegetables
S0174	beef tomatoes
S0172	and there's some
S0174	you won't have those will you
S0173	not if they've be dip in beef
S0172	it didn't describe them as beef tomatoes so you're alright but that they look the closest thing to beef tomatoes that i can find in waitrose
S0173	well doesn't beef just mean they're really big
S0172	i think so yes they've be beef up um unless they're suppose to be serve with beef
S0174	well sun's out
S0172	good
S0173	good finally
S0172	now they do it do promise some sunshine didn't it today
S0174	hm it do actually
S0172	and it's get feta cheese with it
S0173	oh where's the feta cheese i can't see it
S0173	um it's in mix in crumble in with it in the the actual mixture of pistachio nut feta cheese and herbs
S0173	oh that sound weird
S0172	so there's um parsley and can't remember what the other herb be but flat leaf parsley and mint and and
S0174	oregano
S0172	yes there's a little but the oregano be dry it be in the original mixture otherwise i might remember some of the ingredient but i think it's oh and rice
S0173	rice yes
S0172	yes yeah so if the rice isn't as fluffy as it should be i'm sorry but i follow the recipe jamie oliver and
S0173	jamie oliver
S0172	should've do more or less of what he say
S0173	so it'll be jamie olivie's oliver's book
S0172	no it wasn't from a book it be from uh it be from the radio time
S0173	oh okay
S0172	that you get recipes from tv chefs from time to time
S0173	yes um i've don't think i've make one from the radio time but on the bbc website they sometimes have um they have recipes and they're just bbc recipes but then sometimes they also have special ones from like any of their chefs that do show
S0172	yes
S0173	on channel four as well i think they do the same thing
S0172	well i yes i i've get so many cuttings of recipes that i've pick and don't and haven't bother to file properly either from the radio time or from the time newspaper but now that i've now that i don't take the time in print form and get it off the internet it it's easy because i what i'm do be i've just collect some on the my laptop in a file on the laptop
S0173	mm
S0172	so i just copy them put put them in there
S0173	yes and then you can just
S0172	and then if i if i think of it i can use them from there
S0173	mm
S0172	so i've get a an odd assortment
S0173	uh this be really nice i can taste the feta cheese
S0172	i hop so yeah oh it's get the other ingredient i forget be fresh chilli
S0173	mm smell really good
S0172	so it be quite tasty isn't it as a result
S0174	it's not bad this yes it's not bad
S0172	well uh you see the thing be dad be i mean um i've put various ingredients in there that dad probably wouldn't have normally uh
S0172	but the the main one be actually what the vegetables be put in which be um the pepper which he wouldn't normally go for
S0174	nothing seem to have spoil it
S0172	good well that's amaze isn't it
S0172	uh oh nut be the other one that he wouldn't go for pistachios
S0173	i haven't find any pistachios
S0172	well you perhaps i i wonder if the flavour isn't rather mask by everything else
S0173	mm
S0172	what what you they be ones that be already shell there's quite a a lot of them a small packet like that but i mean
S0173	ooh i think that be one
S0172	right some of them and i have to use the pestle and mortar
S0173	mm
S0172	so maybe because i i be get i be find it a bite laborious use that i half of them i then put in the food processor
S0173	oh
S0172	it might've grind some of them up rather a lot and then then you just um put them in the fry pan dry roast something
S0173	yeah do you do this morning
S0172	i do those yes i do that this morning yes yeah
S0173	hm
S0172	which be quite nice that you would in that sense that you come a bite later
S0173	yeah
S0172	because it give me time to assemble it all
S0173	yeah
S0172	but i mean i be think i'd have we'd have this even instead of this afternoon but that's that's make it easy to do
S0173	yeah
S0172	and leave it and i i be lucky it be something i could leave in the oven so
S0173	well the reason i have to get back be because we're go to see that film for the best exotic marigold hotel
S0172	ah oh good
S0173	mm
S0172	who you go with
S0173	i'm go with all the people i'm go to india with except for and because they've already see it
S0172	right not will no he's he be he away
S0173	mum he's in portsmouth sail um cos he's go on a sail trip in april it sort of overlap with india and um it's a practice run
S0172	he get some holiday in doesn't he
S0173	he do he do um so it's basically um the weekend and they be do a couple of race i'm not really sure what this involve if uh they
S0172	be he a skilled uh practice sailor
S0173	well he's do quite a bite of sail and he's do his um oh what's it call it's basically a sail course it's like a a drive theory test like it's the the theory side of what's it call yacht master it's call a yacht master course
S0172	do he sail when he be be bring up in new zealand
S0173	um i think so yeah
S0172	you'd expect that to be
S0173	his dad's into sail so
S0172	right
S0173	he's do quite a bite of it though the last time he do any be almost two years ago i think um i would or one and a half years ago so and the thing be the trip be free they pay for i think they pay for food and they have to pay not sure if there's any equipment charge
S0172	why's it free who's supply them
S0173	i suppose they might pay well it's the university sail club
S0172	i see
S0173	so and they go and sail against other like one of the race what they do
S0174	be that at portsmouth
S0173	it's at portsmouth yeah on
S0172	be it on the sea
S0174	on the
S0173	it's at port solent yeah which i've be to
S0172	yes yes yes
S0173	mm so um yeah i think he's back um probably around a similar time as me or maybe a bite later and i don't think he's never that interest in the cinema unless it's um i don't know
S0172	what d'you mean back a back when
S0173	he's back a similar time to me
S0172	tonight
S0173	yeah
S0172	yeah
S0173	and but no i don't think he'll come to the cinema
S0172	would you like to sail
S0173	um i'd like i i don't know if i'd be that interest in do all the sort of you know actually keep the boat go stuff but i like be in boat
S0174	you do some sail didn't you
S0172	not really no i my sail no
S0172	be a that idea be abort really i my friend her she grow up sail a good deal
S0173	where do she grow up
S0172	um well in well they use to sail on holiday they use to go go to abersoch area in wales
S0173	okay
S0172	um her father be very keen on it so she and and she's marry somebody who's also keen on it
S0173	mhm
S0172	so um between them i think they probably do sail a fair bite cos they've go to dartmouth now so they retire down there so i think they've
S0173	mm i saw the postcard
S0172	i think it's ideal for them you've get a very opportunity to do it
S0173	yeah
S0172	um no i what happen be i express some slight interest in sail and my mother granny pass it on
S0172	the idea on to the son of our friends the peter i don't whether you've hear of him
S0173	of course
S0172	dad's hear of him
S0173	yes i've hear of him
S0172	um and i be invite to go sail with him that be in liverpool and um i go once sail with him well he would've invite me again i think if i'd give him the chance but
S0172	um the only other thing that happen
S0174	there be plenty of others
S0173	didn't you go to the theatre with him or something
S0172	well he he he then um say he'd come up to see me in london when i be at college in london and um uh he want and take me to see be it i don't know whether it's call the ideal boat exhibition not the ideal home exhibition but it be a boat exhibition at earl's court
S0172	so i have to go round earl's court with him look at boat cos i've no knowledge or interest in them really
S0173	yeah
S0172	but i do think i might so so when i go to north wales to do my teacher's certificate meet dad there i actually initially um join the sail
S0174	i be president of the sail club
S0172	oh no you weren't
S0172	i join the sail club in the thoughts that with the think that they might teach me to sail and i might enjoy it but i don't think i think all these people there be sailors already and i i think i go once or twice and that be it
S0173	yes
S0172	i didn't i didn't feel it be me so
S0173	mm
S0172	i didn't do any more but that that be my one opportunity i might've have
S0173	but you get seasick
S0172	well i think on small boat i'd be alright i didn't perhaps i didn't
S0173	maybe you be
S0172	i mean when i go out with for a sail it it be on a lake it wasn't on choppy water you don't just have to sail on the sea do you
S0173	mm true i suppose yeah it depend on your um expectations of sail
S0172	yes quite
S0174	you can sail at rutland water
S0173	mm
S0174	you could couldn't you
S0172	i could
S0173	you could do any kind of
S0172	well i could something couldn't i
S0173	boat boat sport water sport
S0174	i think there's a long wait list get to the club and there have be since the reservoir be first moot
S0172	ah
S0174	i think at one time there be too many people the the club be already oversubscribed and they hadn't even build the reservoir
S0172	well if you think about it if you live in this area where else could you go for sail
S0174	quite
S0172	so it's not surprise be it
S0174	yes i can't think of anywhere else here
S0172	i mean i suppose you'd have to go somewhere like northamptonshire for be it
S0174	
S0174	maybe you you could sail on i don't know i dare say you could
S0172	mm you have to have a fair size lake
S0174	you do yes
S0172	to make it worthwhile don't you
S0174	yes
S0173	mm
S0172	what other reservoirs be there anywhere near
S0172	none any in north north lincolnshire or anything like that
S0174	well there's yeah there's
S0172	might be a long way to go
S0174	covenham remember that's a long way to go
S0172	what about um the fens they don't have reservoirs do they they just have bog and fens and things
S0174	no
S0174	bog and fens
S0173	and overflow rivers
S0172	could you go to the norfolk coast to sail
S0174	you could
S0172	do do people be there the i mean
S0174	blakeney
S0172	for all i know some areas of coast be a lot better for sail
S0174	blakeney's a sail centre
S0172	than others i mean it must depend on the size of your boat whether you like go out into the big open ocean or not must it
S0174	you could go uh holme pierrepont near nottingham which i think be the national sail centre or the national water sport centre or something
S0173	really
S0174	mm
S0173	i would expect that to be by the sea
S0172	that's a long way to travel
S0174	no no no this be in the trent valley
S0173	mm
S0172	cos you have we miss our opportunity on the isle of man we have plenty of opportunity there didn't we
S0173	well yeah yeah definitely mm
S0172	i think it's quite expensive to have a boat if you
S0173	i think so
S0172	or expensive in term of time even if you don't pay a lot for the boat cos you have to maintain them as well as use them
S0173	yeah and i'm sure you have to have various license and documentation and legal stuff
S0172	and if you're go far you have to be
S0173	to have a boat
S0172	so will be be pass take a certificate be he
S0173	no he's so he's do the yacht master cos the yacht master be not practical it's just theoretical so they learn about um
S0172	navigation
S0173	i think they learn about navigation yeah um and obviously part of the boat and he say some things that he like some things he do know through uh practical sail but some things um well i don't know if you have to i don't think he have to study much for it um he have exams at the end so which he pass so so yeah um i think
S0172	be that the first time he's take any kind of qualification
S0173	yeah yeah i think he just want to do it and i think he uh his parent pay for it or something as a birthday present or something like that
S0172	uhuh mm mm
S0173	so but it be his birthday on wednesday so
S0172	oh oh right do you have do he have any kind of get together
S0173	no cos it be um there be he'd be in turkey until monday and then there be an engineer dinner on the wednesday um on the day of his birthday and he doesn't really do ever want to do much for his birthday anyway um so and he isn't
S0172	why's that
S0173	he just doesn't particularly
S0172	not bother about it
S0173	no doesn't particularly um feel it necessary
S0172	well perhaps it's over the years he's he's always be away from home and not have a lot of opportunity
S0173	well no i think there'd be more opportunity to do stuff uh in cambridge
S0172	with the students yes yeah
S0173	i know that the year before when i didn't really know him um he have well it be formal the night of his birthday and they he have a surprise party uh his friends do a surprise party for him
S0172	ahh
S0173	like not really a party but sort of more of like a drink before formal thing
S0172	mm mm
S0173	and um he he doesn't like surprise
S0173	but that didn't occur to them or they didn't realize that
S0172	why doesn't i mean uh what when why shouldn't he like surprise
S0173	well i don't know it it's that he doesn't like surprise or surprise party i think it's that he doesn't really like surprise that much because um
S0172	have he have a surprise on some occasion that upset him
S0173	no i don't think so i think it's more that he like to be in control and have everything plan he's get a sort of he keep a meticulous diary of what he's do and stuff
S0172	do he
S0173	not of what he's do but uh you know what a a future diary not like before
S0172	not what he have do
S0173	no no no no like as in a calendar
S0174	get up have breakfast
S0173	no no
S0172	do you still keep a diary
S0173	not really no not for years
S0172	it's um that's amaze how commit you be for so many years
S0173	yeah
S0174	yes
S0173	yeah
S0172	how many years do you keep it up for
S0173	uh probably i think until i go to university i do it quite regularly even when i be at university i do have a but i didn't do it every day
S0172	that's wonderful but when you start do more interest things you drop it because actually if you think about it you've do probably a lot more interest
S0173	yeah basically yeah yeah
S0172	things in life since
S0173	that's the thing
S0172	yeah but you just can't fit it in
S0173	it's just there's no time and also i think what what i do now be i keep a scrapbook and it's not a regular thing it's just if i have any ticket for anything you know then i'll stick it in
S0172	mm
S0173	it's actually not really a scrapbook it's my old one of my old art book the sketch book that i that we have the black a4 ones um and i have one that didn't have that have a lot of space leave in it so i've just be over the past year or two stick things in i think since cambridge
S0172	well yes well it's it you must really uh perhaps when you be younger you think i'll be famous one day and now you
S0172	now you're not so sure
S0173	i think i always like the idea of record things
S0172	mm
S0173	in case i want to look back in case i think i wonder what i be do on the twenty seventh of november nineteen ninety eight
S0172	the closest i've come to that be be just this isn't record what i've be do the only thing i'm do since i've retire be just write i don't read it cos it's rubbish
S0173	i don't read it either
S0172	i'm just just write up things i've read
S0173	oh film and
S0172	or watch or or hear
S0173	oh it this be a diary though
S0172	well it's i've somebody say it be a commonplace book cos they saw me with it when i go to the lecture a lot of it's scribble and i intend i've do it in pencil and mean to write it up but
S0173	oh this be really interest no this be great because my scrapbook be mostly um visual it doesn't have much write in um yeah see i think i've get the ticket knickknacks
S0172	but this doesn't commit me to anything on a daily basis
S0173	no no but that's what i that's what i do and that's what i like about it it's only if you've get something interest to say it's not a sort of obligation
S0172	yes well i'm often way behind with this and i have a a queue of book wait here
S0172	that i need to write about
S0173	no this be really interest though
S0172	can't take them back to the library yet because i haven't write up
S0173	so you write all about the book cos i just i do record the book that i read i just have a section at the back of the diary for that
S0172	well my problem be that over my lifetime of read i've read quite a lot of book but have little memory of what they're about any more because my memory's not that good and i just feel what a shame not to be able to turn up
S0173	what they ever be yeah yeah
S0172	you know i i'm likely to remember roughly when i read something in term of
S0173	yeah
S0172	well especially at the moment cos it's my
S0173	oh you do see you saw wuthering heights as well do i talk to you about that
S0172	um i somebody mention it to me or i read about it but i do see it yes i go to
S0173	i don't know i don't think you do it be horrible i mean that's wuthering heights but it be so bleak and awful like i'm glad i saw it but it be very harrow
S0172	well have you read it before
S0173	no
S0172	oh i see
S0173	you tell me when there be a bbc or a tv version and i be i wasn't that young and you say don't watch it it's too distress or it's too disturb or something
S0172	oh do i
S0173	yeah uh you be watch it for english for school i think that it's um less
S0172	i i i i'm not sure that the film version because they curtail it there's another generation and it miss out and i don't think the film version be quite as harrow as the book itself you should read it one day
S0173	what this recent film version
S0172	yes yes yes quite
S0173	but really i don't think i'm gonna read it then
S0172	but but it
S0173	be it okay if i have some more
S0172	yes i be gonna what uh offer it but it just that i saw we be so far ahead of you that we think it'd be better not to there's more in here as well if either of you
S0174	she eat very slowly mum do
S0172	well it's because i'm so busy natter
S0173	this be really really nice
S0174	whereas i really just sort of polish it off in no time
S0172	it's unusual for me to finish before you as you well know
S0174	i keep a bird diary
S0172	yes
S0173	yes i think we're we all cos have his sport diary i think it be a a sort of thing that we do and be funny

S0172	that's red pepper but what i've do be tomato if you prefer it it might be the one in the middle
S0174	i might prefer the tomato yes
S0172	i think it's the one in the middle well i think you weren't so keen on red pepper
S0174	which what's
S0172	try i think that's probably it but i may be wrong forgive me if i be
S0174	i don't want
S0172	that's it in the middle that's it
S0174	too much
S0172	and you can take all the etceteras

S0172	the um uh yeah dad keep a bird diary and so do i actually
S0174	yes
S0172	um but what i don't do be be what he do which be to write it all up afterwards properly in the correct order of that that the bird should appear in well should be note in
S0172	i all i do cos i know i wouldn't do it after the event be i take it with me and when we're in a hide or we get back to the car i write it up then i just jot and it's just it's just
S0172	i mean by use a piece of um online paper i find that that i and a pencil with a rubber on the end i find that i can alter as a bite as i go along so there be some kind of system in it
S0173	yeah
S0172	what be you look for
S0174	butter knife
S0172	there it's in the butter
S0173	in the butter

S0172	d'you have anything different at breakfast on a day when you're play hockey
S0173	um
S0172	anything more substantial or about the same
S0173	mm it depend really i think yesterday well yesterday i have some um i have the practice cake that i make um
S0172	practice cake
S0173	yeah as in i make a big cake for you
S0172	oh that one practice for this yes you tell me yes
S0174	one she make earlier
S0172	yes here be one she make earlier
S0173	um cos i um oh and then i go to help um make some cupcakes and cos yesterday even um it cos it be saint patrick's day and colin's irish so um she want to make him cupcakes um though he wasn't too happy because ireland lose in the rugby
S0174	do they
S0173	yeah
S0174	mm
S0173	um anyway uh so i didn't really have much uh oh i get to her house or to their house and find that um her housemate their housemate have make soda bread um again in honour of saint patrick's day so i have some of that which be really nice
S0172	they make that on the isle of man don't they soda bread
S0173	yeah mm apparently it's not that difficult to make so
S0172	no it's easy i think because you don't have to you don't need yeast for raise agent
S0173	oh in oh yeah
S0172	it's bicarbonate of soda or bake powder
S0173	yeah that's all it be bicarbonate of soda
S0172	yes it be
S0173	so we be make these cupcakes and the recipe call for um three tablespoons of bake powder and then we open the cupboard which be just above the mix bowl and we'd already put the bake powder in and a box uh like a packet of bicarbonate of soda fell out and open in the mixture
S0173	luckily it didn't open until it sort of hit the mixture
S0172	sort of thing that happen to me
S0173	so only a bite go in um it be so annoy but
S0172	and he'd already put some in
S0173	i would only put bake powder in it this be cupcakes so you shouldn't put bicarbonate of soda in cake it taste weird
S0172	right yes it do they because sometimes uh granny use to complain that some scones buy in cafes and so on taste of bicarbonate of soda cos they would would put it in
S0173	oh really they'd use that be it more of a preservative as well be that why they
S0172	yes well i don't know i mean the thing be it's one of the ingredients isn't it of bake powder
S0173	of bake powder yeah but
S0172	but it just
S0173	mm
S0172	i'm not sure what the other what's the other ingredient
S0173	i think it's cream of tartar we be talk about this yesterday
S0172	yes that's right yes it be yes you're right
S0173	anyway we manage to scoop out most of the um bicarbonate of soda and they taste okay in the end they be baileys cupcakes so they have baileys in
S0172	oh well that would mask any nasty taste from the bicarb
S0173	yeah it wasn't real baileys it be um o'gradys which we decide sound much more irish anyway
S0174	brilliant it do rather doesn't it
S0173	yes
S0172	the worst thing i ever i don't really remember this the worst thing i ever do with bake be instead of sugar to put salt as a recipe in as an ingredient in the recipe
S0173	i hope the bank wasn't for anything important
S0174	just a wed
S0173	i've forget to put sugar in cake in a cake before um we be talk about this last night cos um
S0172	do the cake work
S0173	it work fine it just taste like just well a sponge like you know not
S0172	spongy but you you could mask it then if you put jam in
S0173	no
S0172	no still not good
S0173	no it be kind of just like weird bread i suppose but yeah it be strange um yeah to be avoid definitely um but when i make your cake i also make the same one for will because i hadn't make him for his birthday cake
S0172	for his birthday cake
S0173	well this be the thing right so he didn't wanna celebrate his birthday on his birthday he couldn't and also last week be just a really busy week for both of us um so we be both busy on thursday cos we have formal um at queen's
S0172	and weren't you sing as well with
S0173	yeah yeah well we be sing on tuesday cos there's the on tuesday and then on um friday well he be away on friday and um i go out with and now back as well so um i haven't really have a chance to do anything for his birthday and the present that i order um which be a wine decanter cos he's
S0172	yes hasn't it come yet
S0173	hasn't come yet um
S0172	have you tell him you're wait for the
S0173	i've well say i'm really sorry i don't have a present for you it's not arrive yet even though i order it in what i think be plenty of time
S0172	mhm
S0173	like he doesn't seem remotely bother by it
S0172	no
S0173	but then they me email me on friday which be about four days after i make the uh no even um after i like order the present and so that the order have be cancel due to lack of stock um so i order it again from another
S0173	it's all do through amazon but it's individual sort of vendors within amazon
S0172	yes
S0173	so i order it again from a different one and hopefully on monday i'll get an email say it's be dispatch this be on friday and so
S0172	yes
S0173	i just hope it turn up eventually
S0172	so when be you hop to have some kind of or aren't you a get together with
S0173	well i think we're not hop to have like i want to cook him dinner just because of
S0172	yes
S0173	just for his birthday and i want to have the like i'll give him the cake
S0172	the cake
S0173	no i'll give him the cake today tonight um
S0172	so you'll have time to see him tonight before you go down
S0173	hopefully if not then probably tomorrow night um well no i'll see him after probably cos the cinema's quite early for go
S0172	mhm yes
S0173	um and them um yeah so at least i'll have a cake although i don't know if he's gonna like it because i don't know if it's his kind of like cake it's
S0172	well it doesn't matter it's the gesture that matter
S0173	i know exactly exactly yeah
S0172	um and in any case it make a lot of sense if you're buy exotic ingredients as you have do for a for a cake to make more than one at the same time
S0173	mm well the point be more make a cake after the book that he give me for my birthday
S0172	i see yes quite
S0173	mm so so yeah so he should get the cake today the present hopefully in the next couple of days dinner cook maybe on thursday so it's a bite stagger but
S0172	yes yes
S0173	yeah
S0172	well it's the think that count isn't it
S0173	mm
S0172	more often that not
S0173	i would've make him a card as well but i didn't have any time at all
S0172	mm
S0172	well i'm very honour that you make me a card in that case
S0173	well the thing be with yours um it be more like um i kind of know what i be go to do
S0172	mm
S0173	for the card anyway
S0172	mm
S0173	um but i i didn't have any inspiration
S0172	sail card for him
S0173	i that's what i think that's a good idea actually um yeah if i do get the time before i give him the present i will probably make a sail card
S0172	have you get a sail joke peter cos that might uh
S0174	a sail joke
S0173	sail joke
S0172	sail joke dad be um
S0174	i don't think so
S0172	there be one or two joke that dad be tell and i that seem quite quite good for once
S0173	and do you find that he'd get them from
S0172	and i say well you know you supply the joke get to illustrate them or card or greet card and they'd go nicely
S0172	don't remember which those joke be but they just seem to me appropriate
S0174	mm i can't remember the
S0172	not for specific occasion but you know a lot of greet card be not for specific occasion be they they're just silly ones
S0173	yeah yeah
S0174	no i don't think i have any sail joke
S0172	now would would somebody like to have some fruit we've get a few grapes i could bring on would you enjoy those

S0173	i might have some grapes with cake later
S0172	but i get some ice i just remember i get ice cream out cos i think we may i better get it back in the freezer quickly i put it in the fridge
S0173	yeah yeah well we could have grapes and ice cream i suppose and then we could have cake as cake later and not as ice cream

S0172	yes could you eat some ice cream now
S0173	i yeah ice cream's good it turn into liquid doesn't it

S0173	yes we'll probably have to put this back in the fridge yeah
S0174	yes i certainly can
S0173	i'm surprise you you like it
S0174	well i be a bite i mean it's not wonderful i wouldn't sort of walk ten miles to have it but uh it's perfectly acceptable
S0173	i think it's really nice
S0174	mm yes it's alright
S0173	feta cheese and pistachios quite interest
S0174	what be the pistachios
S0173	pistachios yeah
S0174	be they herbs
S0173	no they're nut
S0174	be they oh yes
S0173	pistachio nut yeah
S0174	oh yes pistachios yes
S0173	um i don't know where they're from
S0174	i'm not good on nut
S0174	i can't recognize them
S0173	well i don't know if they're you know how some nut be not actually nut uh they're actually anyway i'm not sure which ones they be but some nut be actually not what the definition of nut be
S0174	not real nut yeah quite
S0173	yeah
S0174	cos nut presumably be just a a type of seed
S0173	yeah but i think some of them i think they have to shell be it that they have to have shell to be nut i'm not sure
S0174	don't know much about nut really be brazil nut not nut
S0173	brazil nut be the ones that aren't oh i don't know
S0174	they don't have shell do they
S0173	they do they have those yeah
S0174	oh they do yes yes they do
S0173	um usually we've get a bowl with some nut kick around from christmas but
S0174	yes well we've probably eat them all
S0173	yeah um anyway um yeah i'm not sure what nut be actually not nut do you get many bird on that bird feeder
S0174	yes
S0173	at the moment
S0174	at the moment it's empty and that's because we get so many bird on it there's one that isn't empty that that one the right hand one
S0173	have it get some kind of seed in
S0174	have sunflower hearts in it which be suppose to be very good for the bird but the bird don't seem to know that because they uh
S0174	they hardly take any from that at all whereas the other one contain not now they've eat them all and the goldfinches go for that
S0173	oh yeah you'd think they be they would also be good for them
S0174	oh yes well i mean all of very good for very it have a lot of um uh oil in it
S0173	oh yeah
S0174	which be good for them yes we get uh we get quite a few hear we have a woodpecker the other day
S0173	a green one
S0174	no a great spot
S0173	mm
S0174	on on those peanuts on the right hand side there
S0173	yesterday when i be cycle from hockey it's sort of the hockey pitch i be at be off road
S0174	mm
S0173	um it's hockey pitch
S0174	right i know where the school be
S0173	um i don't think it's by the school i think it's it's you know road
S0174	and close the road which be the next one
S0174	i don't know side i i didn't know that one
S0173	yeah well it's
S0174	road yes
S0173	it's sort of down the end there
S0174	mm
S0173	um and i be cycle out from it towards the road towards street road and there be um it be a small brown bird but it wasn't that small and it be run upright as if it be sort of well partridgy like
S0174	run along the grind
S0173	yeah
S0174	how big be it
S0173	like well it be that's the thing it didn't look that big to me but that's partly cos i wasn't it be quite a distance off um i'd say sort of maybe a bite smaller than a moorhen
S0174	oh no that wouldn't be a partridge
S0173	well um i'm wonder what it be cos it be it didn't look as if it be sort of i don't know
S0172	why wouldn't that be a partridge if that
S0174	because partridges be bigger than moorhens
S0172	be they
S0174	yes
S0172	quail
S0174	well quail be summer visitors
S0173	it's very strange i don't know what it could have be i be think partridge or grouse but then i be think it's just in a random area
S0174	there wasn't um you say it be about moorhen size
S0173	well this it's really hard to tell it be
S0174	be there a lot of reeds and so on there
S0173	there would have be across the road cos there's that ditch the the brownish like um sort of mottle brown i would say
S0174	mm and what colour be it do you see any detail on it at all
S0173	no it be too far away um but and and i sort of it vanish into the hedgerow and i get to that point about a few second later um and just sort of go look i could see it like tear away through the undergrowth
S0174	that do sound like a partridge
S0173	it like partridge be my first think so
S0174	mm a partridge i don't know i would say it's about that long a partridge
S0172	it's very difficult yeah it's very difficult to be exact over size when you just when you have nothing to compare it with at the time
S0174	it be yeah it be yes
S0173	yeah that's the thing
S0172	i that's what i think
S0174	well that's true even in uh experience birdwatchers yeah
S0172	look i'm sorry the ice cream be begin to run away
S0174	be it fine run after it then
S0173	that's fine i like runny ice cream
S0172	right there you be
S0173	thank
S0174	ah thank you very much
S0172	i think that be probably a similar amount but if you want some more of this you can have it
S0174	right
S0172	i'm gonna have my grapes afterwards
S0173	i'm gonna have one with it i hope that's okay
S0172	yeah well i i don't think i can approve of that kind of idea
S0172	be a purist i probably would have them afterwards and then the cheese after that
S0172	or be it before that be the the cheese
S0173	i don't know um what do you do at granny's just the usual uh stuff
S0172	i think the work i do oh we have the audiologist visit and he do some fine tune of her hear aid
S0173	oh really
S0172	which seem and and i buy her a telephone that amplify the sound
S0173	mm
S0172	so that i mean the thing be i didn't want much amplification because if she's use it with the hear aid
S0173	yeah
S0172	she's not go to be able to alter the switch uh if she need something as simple as possible
S0173	yeah
S0172	and i don't want it to be too loud for her in that case because uh sometimes she feel as though with the hear aid everything be really come at her
S0173	mm
S0172	and difficult for her to cope with
S0173	yeah
S0172	um so i get one that only amplify up to fifteen decibels which and it amaze me that it's make enough difference for her when she's not wear her hear aid for her to be able to hear quite well on the phone
S0173	yeah
S0172	she i mean she doesn't hear that well but it's certainly a lot better than it be and when she's
S0173	yeah i find that when i'm talk to her on the phone
S0172	yeah yes but this be with the new phone i don't
S0172	oh you've if you speak to her yesterday two days ago then she would've have the new phone so
S0173	yeah she um she seem to understand straight away that i be at work
S0172	it's make a huge difference
S0173	mm
S0172	it's make a huge difference have hear aid of course to any conversation we have and able now to explain things in so much more detail to her
S0173	yeah
S0172	unfortunately she doesn't then remember the explanation but she seem to follow it generally at the time
S0173	yeah
S0172	which help
S0173	yeah that be good yeah
S0172	uh so we have the audiologist and then on thursday i have a phone call late morning from the duty rota organizer from link
S0173	mm
S0172	who want a meet because it appear that some a couple of the carers have say they can't manage granny
S0173	mm
S0172	with in term of the lift without strain themselves
S0173	oh yeah
S0172	now they be not technically suppose to do any lift and once it seem that once it have come to the notice of the organizer and she'd be bring to her attention then she have to something about it she be oblige to
S0173	mm
S0172	and basically she say that they can't now a a single person on their own on be be not to be put in a position where they have to take her to the toilet
S0173	mhm
S0172	which mean now that she's get to have two visit two visitors not just in the morning as she have be do but late afternoon and even
S0173	yeah
S0172	now that's alright obviously it's a lot more expensive but at the same time i and i be want her to have a morning visit and i'd get granny without persuasion particularly although i have be work on her for a while and she's always reject the idea to say yes it would be a help first thing in the morning to have someone come to make a breakfast and and see if she need anything after the night sort out
S0173	yeah yeah
S0172	so
S0173	as in earlier than you know sort of eight o'clock yes
S0172	eight o'clock in the morning yes yeah that sort of time
S0173	cos what time do they normally come eleven
S0172	yes yeah um so it's result in a um reorganization but at the same time i i grieve that she should have the visit at eight o'clock whatever time late morning and then four o'clock and eight o'clock
S0173	yeah
S0172	i be sort of push into um agree to what i agree to with there be a threat involve here that they couldn't continue to help her anymore if we didn't accept this
S0173	but that's stupid though why would they say that because surely they need to their customers
S0172	no because they they they have to look there's a the way it's put be this and they say their primary duty be be to the person they're care for the the the the carers feel that they can't look after that person without a risk that she will fall be injure
S0173	yeah
S0172	break her hip and that could be the end of her because people of of granny's that happen to that happen to easily
S0173	yeah true yeah
S0172	um so so there's that one and the second the other duty of course be to the carers
S0173	yeah yeah
S0172	who mustn't hurt their back and so on but of course they sign a contract say that they won't do the lift
S0173	yeah but the thing be that's not that's kind of not really what i mean what i mean be that like they should be they shouldn't be threaten you they should be make it easy for you you know they should be make you feel happy because you could quite easily go somewhere else i don't know if there be anywhere else to go but you know
S0172	yes yeah well we're not go to
S0173	they shouldn't be threaten you they should be try to come up with a solution that work for both
S0172	yes well anyway we have a an interview over the phone to begin with um the person concern um her voice really sound hard
S0173	yeah
S0172	i have meet her before
S0173	hard as in unfriendly
S0172	um
S0173	or as in difficult
S0172	demand i suppose
S0173	yeah
S0172	you know she be demand this cos she'd hear i be there
S0173	mm
S0172	when i meet her face to face it be a lot better
S0173	yeah
S0172	and and she but she bring in one of the recent carers that's be there for about six weeks
S0173	mhm
S0172	i think she turn out to be one of the ones that have have say she couldn't she'd actually say i can't go any more unless
S0173	yeah
S0172	now she's in a strong position because she's a really value carer so it help
S0173	yeah
S0172	um so we have quite a long discussion with granny there as well but i don't think granny be follow all the detail you know she lose concentration
S0173	yeah
S0172	uh and she do say when i i keep on explain the situation cos i want her her to be fully in the picture about what granny's need be so there's a lot to say
S0173	yeah
S0172	and then she say well i think what's need be a lift apparatus it's call a stand hoist
S0173	yeah
S0172	and i've see these because actually it turn out it be one of the apparatuses that the ot bring with
S0173	yeah
S0172	to try for granny and tell me since on the phone that it granny couldn't cope with it
S0173	oh really
S0172	because because of the pressure on her knees from it
S0173	mm
S0172	but say go ahead and let them try get the ot in and try the apparatus so i i do but i do say um that this apparatus um might not be suitable for granny thing be if she have the apparatus they'll be able to to revert to send just one carer
S0173	yeah
S0172	and it would be supply free
S0173	yeah
S0172	and and it sound absolutely excellent
S0173	oh yeah
S0172	if they can get her to um to use it without be injure
S0173	yeah or without if she if they can get it and use it for a start
S0172	it's it's well well no it's it's it's them be move from the bed onto the chair to go into the bathroom or anything else
S0173	mhm
S0172	that that it it's design for um it the apparently there be a lot of other kinds of apparatus as well so it's possible they'll find something that will work for her
S0173	yeah
S0172	i don't actually in in theory why it shouldn't work why it be a problem before but that would obviously be a big save cost wise wouldn't it
S0173	yeah that'd be brilliant
S0172	now i've uh have a lot of argy bargy with with granny as well because she's
S0172	she's um she agree to have a carer in first thing in the morning so i tell about this and she say right well we'll do that and we think that maybe the lunchtime visit could be curtail a bite in order to help defray the cost of the morning visit
S0173	mm yeah
S0172	but as soon as granny know it be go to happen she's create a
S0173	what
S0172	she'd uh she because she have forget that she'd say it would be a good idea and the the carer come this morning it be that she know for the first time uh she come and it be granny clearly didn't like it
S0173	yeah
S0172	uh and be difficult with her and and with complain to me afterwards and so on and tell me on the phone that you know she hint that granny have be difficult
S0173	yeah
S0172	so that's experimental
S0173	yeah
S0172	but one thing that happen that be upset be that she be suppose to have a visit an an even visit with two carers come in um at eight thirty in the even it be schedule for
S0173	yeah
S0172	and they turn up at seven thirty
S0173	oh well that's no good
S0172	and granny have only have one couple of hours before that
S0173	yeah
S0172	and it be too early they couldn't do anything to help her at that time
S0173	yeah
S0172	because she didn't need pad change at that time they're suppose to be take her to the bathroom
S0173	yeah
S0172	well uh and it be upset for granny she be also upset because there be two carers she she say she say uh two big fat women turn up
S0172	um and and you know they they check the pad and then they look at the trolley and and i say don't touch those things more or less
S0173	right
S0172	well if they're if that's go to happen if it that's less
S0173	do you make sure they hadn't just get the time wrong
S0172	no it be right that she hadn't get the time wrong
S0173	no no that like the have they misunderstand
S0172	they well i check up on this
S0173	yeah
S0172	and i confirm the time of their visit both confirm it cos she be speak to her granny as they arrive
S0173	yeah
S0172	and i can confirm that it have finish by ten to eight
S0173	yeah but have you check with uh link that they've get it down
S0172	i have check with link
S0173	e link
S0172	link and accord to they should've come at eight thirty
S0173	eight thirty
S0172	and they come a whole hour early
S0173	well at least now they know
S0172	so so
S0173	that they've get it wrong
S0172	she's she promise to tell them
S0173	yeah
S0172	and last night whoever it be they come at about the right time
S0173	yeah
S0172	but i've say to i i i be really concern about this cos when i realize how upset granny be i think well it's no good have it change even to eight o'clock because it's too early
S0173	yeah
S0172	and they they'd shift it without shift the afternoon visit forward
S0173	yeah
S0172	so that's why the interval be completely wrong
S0173	yeah
S0172	they they'd do that as a kind of makeshift i think for the moment so that this week then they could start the whole thing differently so i think granny might get a visit at four o'clock this afternoon
S0173	oh yeah yeah
S0172	which be i've review it and i've talk to auntie about it um as well i spend a whole night afterwards not really sleep cos i be think about how to get this right sort it out
S0173	oh no yeah
S0172	um and a whole morning try to speak to the organizer cos it's difficult
S0173	yeah
S0172	um uh and as a result um have agree that i think that we can revert to the previous time although the last visit may need to be nine thirty so we'll see about that then it's when she's get two people who work together to contain them which be difficult
S0173	yeah
S0172	but i be worry that she'd be change a lot of carers and it would be difficult for granny
S0173	yeah
S0172	to cope with it's too much change all at once
S0173	yeah that's the thing but you know it's get to happen so she'll just have to get use to it
S0172	yeah but it's it's it's counterproductive because she doesn't cooperate with them when they come
S0173	yeah
S0172	if she doesn't like it she doesn't
S0173	she won't do it yeah
S0172	and then she's in distress next day cos things weren't right and
S0173	i think you be gonna say that they that somebody have say that they can't manage her as in like she complain too much or be too difficult
S0172	well um i don't know
S0174	people be use to that
S0172	i be say that's there's that as well
S0173	yeah
S0172	but
S0173	mm
S0172	i have to take her to the bathroom at half past ten at night
S0173	yeah
S0172	get her back to bed try to help her with the pad afterwards she and i be too tire to do it
S0173	mm you're not suppose to do it though
S0172	well i don't have the proper techniques anyway
S0173	mm
S0172	and and this you know i my muscle be hurt and my shoulder be all
S0173	yeah you're not suppose to do it you'll injure yourself
S0172	i couldn't get the pad on properly for her and she be too cos she be too tire to help me by move over
S0173	mm
S0172	so i mean i've get every sympathy with the one person do it i think she be
S0173	yeah
S0172	for quite some of the carers can manage it really well really easily the really strong ones but they shouldn't have to they're not suppose to do it
S0173	no they shouldn't have to oh well nice grapes where they from
S0172	um waitrose
S0173	waitrose hm just take all of them
S0172	yeah
S0174	say no more
S0172	he'll feel he's get to eat them all up
S0173	yesterday i go to a lecture at um well it be one of the corpus christi lecture theatres um which be uh it's basically corpus christi be obviously like on or street that they it's the mccrum lecture theatre which be behind the pub um
S0174	oh yeah the yeah
S0172	isn't a very good name be it
S0174	mm mm
S0173	no it's not but uh and basically cos yesterday be a science festival um in cambridge and so one of the sort of part of this be uh it be a sort of a whole day of lecture call thinkcon um and
S0172	ah this be the festival we hear about be it perhaps last year and i think ooh there's some good things
S0173	you might have do yeah
S0172	or unless they have another one in the summer
S0173	no i think i think it's a yearly thing um cos there be lot of events uh they need people who be help out at various events
S0172	mhm mm
S0173	but um uh really want to go to this lecture by richard wiseman who be a psychologist so she cos she do psychology for her undergrad degree
S0172	right
S0173	um so she'd hear of him um and like read her read his work and stuff
S0172	of course she want to go yes
S0173	and also he'd publish a paper in plus one relatively recently so she print it out and everything she be really enthusiastic um and he he be basically the headline act of the day i go to one other lecture just before
S0172	be they free lecture
S0173	uh they be free it be brilliant yeah absolutely you just to have to reserve a ticket
S0172	mm
S0173	um and and yeah so and have be to a couple earlier that day as well but i couldn't go cos of hockey um and so he be talk about uh well the one before him be somebody i can't remember her name helen something and she her lecture be just about wasn't a proper lecture it be just at a talk she'd do at the edinburgh fringe festival and it be about space and she be really enthusiastic about space and like she tell us about the history of nasa and how um rocket technology be basically um sort of start like there's the first research and everything be um do well not even just the first research but the nazis create their rocket like missiles
S0174	v v2s and v1s
S0173	yeah exactly and that be the begin of rocket technology and
S0172	be this a a space sort of a british female space scientist
S0173	she's not a scientist she's just really enthusiastic about space
S0172	no it's just that there be one that on interview on television relatively recently
S0173	oh that older one
S0172	she's very knowledgeable
S0173	yeah no it wasn't her
S0172	this be a young woman yeah
S0173	i know what you mean of that older one she be um she hadn't she do something that be she like her invention or something or something she discover be really important in the i don't know
S0172	i don't know
S0173	i don't even know who you're talk about anyway um
S0172	not jocelyn bell i don't mean her
S0173	who's
S0172	jocelyn bell be an oh she's an astronomer so we're not talk about
S0173	anyway
S0172	she she's a be an old girl of my school
S0173	i oh yeah no it wasn't her um this
S0174	she know everybody
S0173	clearly so
S0172	they're the only odd one that i think yeah i can kind of lay claim to have know of
S0173	yeah no
S0172	that's who it be like judi dench to drop another name
S0173	be she another old girl there
S0172	yeah yeah
S0173	oh be she so anyway um yeah this woman be really good and enthusiastic but then he's professor he be just absolutely brilliant he be not only really interest in term of what he be talk about but he be such a good speaker cos obviously he's do this a lot and he's also be on um tv like he be on tomorrow's world
S0172	right
S0173	um cos basically his subject be um well relate to kind of paranormality and uh like why we he's write a book call paranormality and basically it's discredit all paranormality
S0172	ah okay
S0173	yeah um so it's basically his
S0172	there's a scientific explanation for all these things
S0173	yeah exactly and the brain create it like why do the brain create um what like why do the brain sort of you know spot face spot jesus christ on a piece of toast or spot a demonic face in a a reflection of a stone or something like that
S0172	yes
S0173	and he be you know like his explanations he didn't go into great detail he just mostly do through show us effect like you know there's the the uh it's basically say what we perceive be not how the world really be um
S0172	mm
S0173	and um it's a sort of a survival instinct in a way because your brain couldn't possibly you know process every single thing as it be
S0172	i've see that
S0173	it have to take shortcuts
S0172	yes there be somebody talk about that recently on tv
S0173	yeah yeah
S0172	whether it be him i don't know
S0173	uh i don't know it's like um you know when you read a word the letter can be any in any order as long as the first letter and the last letter be in the right place you'll read the word
S0173	yes yes
S0173	um so your brain take shortcuts all the time um and he show us illusions like you know the rabbit duck head thing whereas if you look at it one way it's a duck and the other way it's a rabbit
S0174	oh yes
S0173	yeah
S0174	logos sometimes make use of that
S0173	yes yeah
S0172	you can get book with lot of optical illusions on different page
S0173	yeah
S0174	yes
S0173	it be the sort of optical illusions and also like uh pick out face and that sort of thing he be say that it's just what the brain do because obviously the brain uh be it's really important face be so important for people
S0172	it's try to make sense of what it see and the sense it make may be false sense
S0173	yeah yeah yeah and it's just identify
S0173	you know you're more likely to see a face where it's not there and it's more ecologically important economically sorry what be i talk about evolutionarily important
S0172	and do he refer to so call ghost as a product of that kind
S0173	yes
S0172	what happen though what if they appear on a photo and they we know it's not be cook
S0173	he show us some photos he show us photos um so like there be one where it look like a streak of it be like in an underground volt or something look like a streak of light be zoom across the picture
S0172	yes
S0172	and he look he have it for years um and sort of be look at it think you know this one this one seem almost like it could be genuine and then his um his colleague walk into his office and say what an awful photo and he he say why do you say that and he say well look the photographer have get his the end of his glass in the front of the photo
S0172	be it streak be they streaky
S0173	you know if you take your pair of glass off and it's get the little plastic coat on the bite that go behind your ear
S0172	yes
S0173	be that bite and it be like hook round but it look like a streak ball of light but all it be it's make of like translucent orangey plastic isn't be often so the flash have go straight through it and make it look a bite more sort of you know ghostly than it be
S0172	mm mm so when people take photos in so call haunt house
S0173	yeah
S0172	um very often there they think they see a ghost on the photo
S0173	and there be like blotch of light
S0172	they haven't actually see it themselves necessarily but but it appear on the photo
S0173	yeah just the photo the the like there be a few there's cos you know if you take a camera take or set your camera to certain settings and it blur things and it do things
S0172	yes
S0173	like if you use the night set when it's not night or i think if you use the like sort of dusk set there be one where it look like there be a ghost of a man walk up a a path and it be just somebody actually walk up the path but it be dark so it just it have just pick up on you know bits of it
S0172	sometimes there could be have be a reflection from a window couldn't it
S0173	yeah yeah and he show us some things that people have genuinely post as in sort of say what i can't explain this thing in my photo and like what's that weird ghostly face and it's like a tv set or something with a person's face on it it's something really stupid and really obvious um some of them be ridiculous some of them be slightly less ridiculous but he be basically he's also a magician and he start out be a magician and be like if i can fool people
S0172	ah he's interest in slight of hand
S0173	yeah if he can fool people into you know believe a coin have be pass to another hand when it hasn't it's just be like drop down behind your hand
S0172	mm
S0173	um he show us how it's all about where you look like you know if you pretend to take your the coin out of one hand and it really drop but if you carry on star at that hand look suspicious whereas if you're look so wherever you look the audience will look if you're look where your hand be with the with the pretend coin in it then you open it and it's go then the audience will be like wow but if you if you're it's your body language and your look that what like professional stage magic be apparently so
S0172	yes yeah yeah i read a book that send me you know she pick out some of these unusual book
S0173	mhm
S0172	uh and it be about part of the book be about um live alone go somewhere where you're really isolate
S0173	yeah
S0172	uh it might have be on an on a an small island in the highlands and or the islands perhaps the island perhaps an island in scotland opposite the coast of scotland
S0173	yeah
S0172	and she after she'd be there on her own for weeks and weeks she start to hear voice
S0173	yeah
S0172	and she would hear them in the wind she'd just hear chorus and so on but she do explain it as be a product of her brain her mind because of her isolation
S0173	her isolation
S0172	and i i sometimes connect this with granny and her voice the voice that she apparently hear
S0173	oh yeah well it's almost like if you want to hear you know you want people you want social company
S0172	would that be what it be the the brain conjure them up because it expect company
S0173	i don't know because it's either because it extract them or because it want them
S0172	mm
S0173	even if you don't know you want them you it's natural isn't it
S0172	but when i'm at cheltenham i mean it i and i go to bed i well i do i don't worry about it but cos i know what it be but i hear what could be footsteps
S0173	yeah
S0172	but i know what it be i know it's creak floorboards
S0173	yeah
S0172	but it's funny how you know the house be just settle at that time of the night cos the heating's go off
S0173	and it's change temperature
S0172	and or i've or yes exactly
S0173	yeah
S0172	and and or because i've just walk over them and i've shut the bedroom door and there i be
S0173	yeah
S0172	but but if i didn't tell myself look don't be silly you know what these be then i could start to worry
S0173	yeah
S0173	that's the thing i mean that's um it's it's normal isn't it it's like you want well not that you want people to be there but it's
S0172	or you don't want people that you don't want something that's happen but you it might occur because you think about it
S0173	yeah well that's what he be say that um
S0172	you you try to make read interpret something as
S0173	yeah
S0172	footsteps
S0173	yeah that's the thing
S0172	because it sound like footsteps and your brain's hear those before and that's what they sound like
S0173	but it's all just like everything can be explain be what his message be
S0172	yes
S0173	basically everything can be explain
S0172	i well i think i think there's another possibility which be that some of these phenomena could be explain but we don't yet have the scientific mean to explain them
S0173	some of them yeah
S0172	well let me give you an example and i that's what i would call think transference
S0173	he do mention that in his book
S0172	what do he say about that
S0173	he didn't say but he flick through all the things that people say they can't explain and he say that it you know it's he didn't okay he didn't explain it but it come up as a thing that he think that there be an explanation for
S0172	i i mean i think i just have this feel that think transference be an actual phenomenon
S0173	yeah yeah
S0172	that it it can happen and that it could be that brainwaves can be transfer without physical contact
S0173	well i don't see why
S0172	just as radio wave can be
S0173	yeah i don't see why that couldn't not that i know anything at all about the science but because if you're if things in your brain can pick up your own brain signal why can't they pick up somebody else's who's of who's close to you
S0172	exactly yes
S0173	but then in that case why wouldn't they do it all the time
S0172	but the only yes but the only strange thing there be that sometimes they happen at a distance you get a lot of people say that they've be at a long distance away from somebody else and it's somebody they be close to closely relate to
S0173	yeah well there's the whole twin thing isn't there
S0172	yes
S0173	you know
S0172	yes
S0173	um twin see each other's pain and stuff
S0172	loss of yes yes so that's difficult to explain away
S0173	yeah yeah and there's the whole also i mean there's the whole other animals have sense that we don't have or have forget how to use like the elephants thing
S0172	we may have them in a residual form
S0173	yeah do i do you read that book the book about the man in south africa who run an elephant uh like
S0172	the elephant whisperer
S0173	the elephant whisperer yes
S0172	uh i didn't read it but i hear about him recently uh only the other day
S0173	oh really oh what do they say about him
S0172	on tv or um or the radio as i be travel cos the radio be on as i be travel he's just die
S0173	do oh no really
S0172	um age sixty one i think
S0173	how do he die
S0172	i don't know but i don't think that's particularly significant but but after die
S0173	oh okay
S0172	and this be hadn't happen for a long time the elephants on the reserve where he live um come up to the fence round the house
S0173	they know yeah
S0172	as though they be mourn him
S0173	well that's what happen in the
S0172	because they be so close to him
S0173	in the book it tell how he would go on international trip and when he get back they'd be wait for him
S0172	oh you hear that about dog don't you a dog know when and it doesn't have to be on a at a regular time of day
S0173	yeah
S0172	the dog know that that master be return
S0173	be come home yeah
S0172	and go there ready to greet but that just might be that they have the sort of hear that mean they they know before anybody else do
S0173	yeah but things like elephants pick up on i don't know i i just don't understand i suppose like you know if whale can communicate over massive distance
S0172	yes hm yes yes huge distance yeah
S0173	yeah yeah yeah anyway um well that's really sad that he die i be hop he'd write another book
S0172	so it really very readable be it
S0173	yeah
