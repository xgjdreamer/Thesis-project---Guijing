S0041	that's exactly what i say to
S0084	what do that say
S0041	i say you'll look what happen er leave from f and b she's leave and really didn't want her to leave because she want chloe to have my job
S0084	right
S0041	when i leave
S0084	yeah
S0041	um and i need to see actually cos i don't know if actually truly believe that i'm go anywhere
S0084	right
S0041	which be why cos she's be hold fire for a little while
S0084	okay
S0041	um but cos her manager treat her like shit she be like no she say she's move to carluccio's to be a waitress she's get a degree do you know what i mean she
S0084	it's probably better money at carluccio's
S0041	it's better money
S0046	mm
S0041	and that's what she's say if i'm gonna be a waitress i'd rather go and get money for it and be kinda say look
S0084	hang fire
S0041	hang fire if i've get before the year's out i'll be lucky
S0084	mm
S0041	you know it's only you know it's only gonna be five months six months
S0084	mm
S0041	before we can move you if you're before then like
S0084	yeah
S0041	hang fire
S0084	mm
S0041	but obviously she can't and she doesn't see the bigger picture so
S0084	it be really hard
S0041	and that's just everyone's just gonna go leave she's leave so
S0084	really
S0041	f and b manager's leave chloe's leave and i be both gonna be out of there before the end of the year
S0084	mm
S0041	they'll both be go 's move to
S0084	be that the mythical i'm gotta live in but never quite materialize it
S0041	that's the mythical i've get to live in but his contract'll be out anyway
S0084	okay
S0041	i don't think he'll stay i don't think he'll about christmas
S0084	mm
S0041	really
S0084	what about do you think he'll stay
S0041	simon will probably stay quite like it i think simon really could take 's job
S0084	mm
S0041	i don't think he want to which be a bite of an issue
S0084	mm
S0041	and it it would really push him far enough but if he want to be a manager then
S0084	mm
S0041	i think i think they would let him have a stab at it
S0084	mm
S0041	they'd at least i at least think they'd interview him for it
S0084	mm
S0041	cos he support a lot so everybody's just go everyone's go they've lose so many staff so many staff recently the financial controller leave
S0084	good
S0041	yep go get a new one of those the staff turnover there be so high
S0084	mm
S0041	so high and i just think
S0084	but surely that should like flag up somewhere higher in the echelons you know that sort of thing be be be look at all the time
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know those number be be crunch you would think that that would raise an alarm bell somebody else you know look at resourcing of er in the group
S0041	in the region say yeah
S0084	as a whole would think christ what be that what's that gm do
S0041	yeah
S0084	like why what be go on there
S0041	it's mad absolute madness i've tell him as well
S0084	mm
S0041	cos be like you know you can't tell him anything i say i tell him
S0084	mm
S0041	and she be like what cos she even say to me like i go to these ecf meet
S0084	mm
S0041	and do you know what he say i go to the ecf meet and this be suppose to be an honest forum right the whole point of ecf be honesty you go there you're not allow to be judge for what you say you say whatever you feel
S0084	okay
S0041	not personally but as long as it's from your department's point of view
S0084	mm
S0041	fine go for it and i be complain about the state of the food
S0084	mhm
S0041	um housekeep agree with me and then beth stupid bitch in hr well you know the the housekeepers need that stodge you know they have a very physical job they need all that carb no they don't
S0084	mm
S0041	they do it's a physical job i say beth you tell me any doctor that would say
S0084	mm
S0041	for one meal or everyday as it happen in this hotel
S0041	you require as a human be that many carbs whether you're a weightlifter
S0084	mm
S0041	never mind to hoover the floor
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	you don't you physically don't need it
S0084	well er
S0041	you can't take it
S0084	yeah it's ridiculous they're only clean for what four or five hours a day it's not like it's a
S0041	yeah
S0084	a long long day
S0041	yeah
S0084	no it's just silly
S0041	i say they need you know they need some carbs they need healthy food
S0084	mm
S0041	you know to replace their energy
S0084	yeah
S0041	with vitamins in it
S0084	yeah
S0041	they don't need pasta with chip and
S0084	bread
S0041	naan bread
S0041	which be what they serve
S0084	yeah man alive
S0041	um and apparently the gm go back to and say well tut i er i notice be quite assertive with her thoughts about the food quite negative though isn't it it's quite negative
S0041	ha yeah
S0084	well it's shit so
S0041	just to that's his favourite phase phrase just a peb in your pond just a peb in you pond
S0084	just what
S0041	a pebble in your pond
S0084	pebble in your pond
S0041	basically i'm gonna drop this make ripple and i'm gonna disturb your nice little calm surface just a pebble in your pond he like to say that
S0084	that's such a weird thing to say
S0041	yeah just a pebble in your pond i notice at the you know might perhaps wasn't in the right frame of mind and tut
S0084	how dare you question the regime
S0041	it be quite yeah it be quite negative mm you know really should be quite er perhaps be careful how we phrase things and i you know what i'm like i'm crap at the way i phrase things sometimes i won't think and i'll just say it cos i think it but there i be be very very diplomatic
S0084	right
S0041	very diplomatic which do you know i find i get in trouble for a lot
S0084	right
S0041	at work if something's happen and no one else have witness it
S0084	mm
S0041	some of the people at work believe that the way i speak to them or speak to my friends or you know oh what a fuck knob jockey you know sort of stupid that i would say that
S0041	on a professional level and i and like obviously know and i'll say to come on
S0084	mm
S0041	you know you know how snappy i can be
S0084	yeah
S0041	and how sharp i can be with my tongue
S0084	mm
S0041	but er in a work environment with a client
S0084	mm
S0041	no way
S0084	mm
S0041	there be no way i would ever even risk it
S0084	yeah
S0041	even say something that could be misconstrue like i train in communication
S0084	mm
S0041	i know not to do that
S0084	yeah
S0041	so she trust me so when he come over and say it to her she say and i tell her the whole conversation i'd have exactly what i'd say and i say and the worst part be that wasn't a client that be the honest open forum
S0041	and she say i know i've just get to the point now where path of least resistance you've just gotta be whatever it be just yeah this yeah hotel and just tell them to shut up just leave them to it isn't that absolute crap
S0084	that's horrible because you can't do that long term
S0041	what's the point yeah
S0084	you might as well just roll over and die now
S0041	yeah
S0084	huh it just it that just make me feel very tire and very unhappy for everybody who work there
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know who have no sort of light at the end of the tunnel
S0041	yeah
S0084	at you know you're gonna be go
S0041	yeah
S0084	i mean really you're on whatever you're on and actually probably isn't earn that much more than you be she
S0041	no i think 's on twenty three
S0084	so really i don't know i don't know whether a shop job be the answer but she could get something else that's would not be as time intensive
S0041	and would definitely pay more
S0084	and would pay her more
S0041	yeah and say you know i know exactly what you think and i agree with you now and i don't understand how i didn't see it before now you've be tell me this for six months and i say well yeah but you've be in this company for nine years
S0084	mm
S0041	this be whole brand new to me i be like what the fuck this be nothing like any business i've ever work for
S0084	mm
S0041	um and she say well you know he'll never listen you can't tell him i say i've tell him
S0041	she be like what be like you do what now
S0084	mm
S0041	so i tell him i sit in the back of his car and i tell him you sit in the back of his car i be like yeah we be gonna come home from the holiday inn and i be suppose to be in russell's car but i didn't i want to go with him so i say i'm go in your car and he be like okay and what do he say
S0084	panic panic panic
S0084	what the hell's she be say
S0041	you could see the light go in her head
S0041	and he basically say cos we have this like you know the time top ten company to work for
S0084	mm
S0041	or whatever it be
S0084	mm
S0041	well they send these survey out and you do it and it all get calibrate anyway 's always top ten
S0041	couldn't tell you why
S0084	it's always top ten
S0041	yeah
S0084	god
S0041	top ten or top twenty
S0084	mm
S0041	yeah always
S0046	hiya
S0041	don't know how dunno how i tell you about this place
S0084	so that's that's that's
S0046	everything alright
S0084	staff be vote it's
S0041	yes yeah
S0084	a good place to work
S0041	oh yeah mm mm
S0084	well maybe they're all its staff be sheep
S0046	i'll just we'll start after cook dinner
S0084	maybe they're all just
S0041	sheep vegas
S0084	sheep
S0041	sheep vegas
S0084	presumably none of the ones in cambridge be sheep though like the half of them have leave
S0041	yeah
S0046	anyway how be you do
S0041	yeah but while they're there
S0084	they've just be indoctrinate
S0046	yeah
S0041	yeah until the this this be the first time that this the
S0046	cool
S0041	survey's come back like crap
S0046	cool cool cool
S0084	oh really
S0041	yeah
S0046	be they alright
S0041	um
S0046	be they alright
S0041	i be really negative on mine so i might have have a bite of an impact on our
S0046	yeah
S0041	thirty nine percent drop in the department
S0046	yeah
S0084	single handedly
S0041	see as the department consist of eight of us i reckon i have quite a good er impact on that
S0084	possibly if yours be like minus ten
S0084	minus one hundred
S0041	and ten
S0084	minus infinity
S0041	yeah so
S0084	they're shit
S0041	we be sit in the back of the car and he say you know what do you mind me ask cos there be me from you know sales and res and then from reception and from the kitchen why do you think the morale be really low when we do this last year and we all just look at each other and i could imagine that that's exactly how and they all look at each other
S0084	mm
S0041	in that room
S0084	mm
S0041	and i say do you want to know the truth
S0041	and you could see the inhale from the other two cos they know me and they think oh crap
S0084	mm
S0041	and um he say yes yes i certainly do and i say you you have potentially could have still a very able workforce but nobody's utilize
S0084	mm
S0041	you're sit on skills that you you don't ever use you don't call upon and you don't recognize or thank people for
S0084	mm
S0041	i say cos it's such a big space out team that apart from your direct line manager which if you're not lucky enough to work in my office you probably never get to see
S0084	mm
S0041	have no idea what you're like and i say and apart from and i say and apart from and i say as far as senior management go i e you
S0041	you haven't get a clue you you know you'll see a a person's name badge and as long as they're tick the box for whatever role that say which for most people in this hotel that i've speak to be actually below what their er their ability be
S0084	right
S0041	then you don't you don't care and that really make people feel disposable
S0084	mm
S0041	and i think before christmas especially because then we take on agency staff
S0084	mm
S0041	so we bulk out the workforce
S0084	mm
S0041	people weren't have personal development they weren't recognize and they just felt they be disposable and i think it that go to prove how many how much staff you lose at that time
S0084	mm mm yeah
S0041	and he say oh er that that shock me quite a lot
S0084	but er but how how be that a surprise
S0041	yeah and i say well you've see yourself in the figure that have go and then you've get your survey back to prove it so in actual fact i think it it speak volumes
S0084	mm
S0041	um and he say well can you give me you know an example i say yeah course i can i say you know and he say oh yes she's er f and b i say no she she's a graduate
S0041	a philosophy graduate which she do in a a language other than her own mother tongue
S0084	mm
S0041	she speak three languages she be run your conference department before we have ed and you've lose her do you know and he say we haven't lose her she's on she's on sabbatical i say actually she have a conversation with about be a supervisor and we we basically let her go and i say that girl do one day she's work in hotels for eight years she do one day and be teach your receptionist that's work there for two years and make constant errors everyday that we have to scoop up in res
S0084	hmm
S0041	there one day and be teach daria ask daria she be really grateful
S0084	mm
S0041	i say be brilliant we trust her with everything she be run our conferences single handedly because that's before we have a team in
S0084	mm
S0041	she be great and we keep tell how great she be
S0084	mm
S0041	um and i know she have a conversation about become supervisor and that be basically a proviso of whether she could stay cos she felt disposable
S0084	mm
S0041	i say where's now he say i don't know i say america
S0084	and how big be the hotel like how many staff do he have
S0041	a hundred
S0084	a hundred and he doesn't know these people
S0041	a hundred and fifty
S0084	god that's really bad
S0041	isn't it
S0084	cos my group director geoff of our group the he's probably responsible obviously er it cascade down but he's probably responsible for seventy people include the us and he know everybody he know everybody
S0041	you should that's
S0084	on the team
S0041	yeah you should
S0084	so this whole carry on of i don't know where that person be i don't know what they do that's a concern
S0041	yeah
S0084	and but you've gotta trust that their line manager's cos you're responsible for hire your next in charge
S0041	yeah
S0084	and you've gotta trust that they're that that then carry on
S0041	they're do that yeah
S0084	but he's obviously not take any active interest in his staff otherwise he would be pull up on
S0041	not at all
S0084	so do report to him
S0041	yeah
S0084	so he would be say to her how be your team get on what be they work on and what be they perform well on like talk to me about your staff
S0041	yeah
S0084	and they he's obviously not say that to them
S0041	no
S0084	because he would know
S0041	no in fact it turn out actually cos i say that to and she be like oh that make sense i be like why and come in yesterday she come back from america cos she go for a a like three month holiday with her sister
S0084	nice
S0041	come back and bring us some chocolate have call her and ask her to come in
S0084	mm
S0041	and apparently say to you get back no matter what she ask for you take her on
S0084	really
S0041	yeah so once it's bring to his attention he's do it
S0084	mm mm mm
S0041	i be like fuck yeah
S0084	yeah but he's the
S0041	so he should
S0084	he's the gm he's not the one who should be be tell what to do he's the one that should be tell
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know
S0041	yeah
S0084	give the instruction not follow it
S0041	isn't it isn't it warp
S0084	i've never know anything like it i'm just gonna take my wash out so that you
S0041	mm
S0084	it's get to be your decision really hasn't it really i mean as as far as be concern you know if you feel like you wanna have the conversation then you know do
S0041	i don't think i'm gonna gain anything out of it and i certainly wouldn't go down that route now
S0084	mm
S0041	right now
S0084	mm think it's just it's just stoke up more negative feel and it'll just make you like more upset particularly right now
S0041	mm
S0084	it might just mean that you know before you go you get on the boat before you go and get on the boat you have a conversation but the the the risk with do that be that
S0041	you make damage that's irreparable and that would be
S0084	yeah and then
S0041	the last conversation ever
S0084	possibly and you're gonna get on a boat
S0041	mm
S0084	for four years and that'd be your last conversation
S0041	yeah mm
S0084	i would just um have a bite of space now
S0041	mm yeah
S0084	for sure
S0041	and at least while i don't get that from him it's something i can be angry at him for
S0084	yeah which be help in the not texting
S0041	mm
S0084	hmm ice cream make everything okay
S0041	ice cream make the world go round doesn't it
S0084	mm make everything better that and bed

S0041	mm
S0084	bloody child
S0041	i get they be take the mick out of me today at work cos of the way i spell
S0041	like i don't spell because b a b e c a

S0041	b e c a u s e
S0084	mhm how do you
S0041	that's how you spell it
S0084	how do you spell it
S0041	b e c a u s e
S0084	right and how be that spell
S0041	b e c a u s e
S0084	right so you spell it phonetically then
S0041	yep
S0084	out loud
S0041	yep
S0084	well i mean obviously that's what three year olds do
S0084	um but that's fine if that help you spell it correctly
S0041	no not just that i spell everything that way
S0084	that would be quite annoy because you don't really have an internal voice do you so you everything be out loud so do you do you actually say it out loud so like in your head you're like er mm mm mm
S0041	sometimes
S0084	okay
S0041	but the thing be it's okay until someone say how do you spell this and i can't tell them
S0041	cos i can't get the b e c a u be that right a u s e
S0084	yeah
S0041	and if someone spell something to me wait wait wait wait wait
S0041	slowly
S0041	cos i have to get my brain to catch on
S0084	that's funny isn't it
S0041	the the weird thing be my sister's the same
S0084	mm
S0041	she spell that way but neither of our parent do
S0084	phonetic spelling's quite a recent thing cos i wasn't teach phonetic spell when i be at school like it wasn't b e c a u s e it be just just how you're suppose to spell it there be it it be completely
S0041	yeah
S0084	different
S0041	no mine be i be never teach it that way
S0084	oh really
S0041	no
S0084	that's how that's how they teach kid now but when i be
S0041	oh do they
S0084	at school that's not how they use to teach us
S0041	oh no ours never teach that way
S0084	no

S0041	like
S0084	they'll stop mock you
S0041	they'll stop mock me
S0084	mm wouldn't hold out much hope

S0084	mm
S0041	i have quite a lot of things traits that be very childish
S0084	right
S0041	like that
S0084	yeah
S0041	like time get time wrong um i like to touch stuff like anything that i see that's some strange texture i go touch it
S0084	mm
S0041	if i go shop touch everything
S0084	mhm
S0041	um like sleep with a doll sleep with a doll
S0084	mhm
S0041	i drink from a sippy cup
S0084	yeah that's true you do do that
S0041	um i can't remember the my my alphabet in order very well
S0041	hence i be tell you about dictionary duty
S0041	really really primary stuff like really kiddy kiddy things
S0084	mm
S0041	i just never never seem to have get rid of
S0084	it's isn't it
S0041	how weird's that
S0084	i dunno why that be
S0041	no no idea no idea and it's such a stark contrast to yes i will arrange your wed for you
S0084	yeah
S0041	but i'll do it drink through a sippy cup
S0084	yeah
S0084	spell out loud
S0041	yeah it's weird ain't it
S0084	mm it's just how your brain work
S0041	i like i love children's songs i know millions and millions of children's songs
S0084	right
S0041	load of them that no one else have hear of
S0084	maybe it's just maybe like a a symptom of have to grow up so quickly you know even at sixteen you're still a child
S0041	mm
S0084	both mentally and you know emotionally
S0041	maybe mm
S0084	maybe it's something to do with that like part of you regress because you never really have that childhood like the learn to tell the time thing that's something that your parent help you with you don't really learn that at school particularly
S0041	mm
S0084	like my parent buy me a watch like a toy watch and we use to tell the time we have a massive clock on the wall at home it be one of those toy ones that you move the hand around and we use to practise at home all the time i think if your parent like it doesn't sound like your mum be particularly the kind of person that might
S0041	yeah
S0084	test you on stuff like that and help you and so that's probably the sort of thing that you learn when you're that young
S0041	mm
S0084	and if you're not get that sort of stimulus at home maybe that's why
S0041	yeah
S0084	your brain be like that
S0041	i guess
S0084	you struggle a little bite like that but obviously academically you're you know you're fine
S0041	yeah
S0084	don't know
S0041	goodness there's there's a few more than that as well that i've come across i can't er like er i just can't think of them now cos they're really normal to me

S0084	mm
S0041	after i say please don't call me in the middle of the day and she call me in the middle of the day
S0084	oh i wonder what would happen if there's a cheeky little fire
S0084	cheeky fire
S0041	bite of arson
S0084	just cheeky bite of
S0041	just
S0084	hob burn down
S0041	no we need to choose something that really need to go
S0041	the fire's gonna need to be in that bathroom upstairs
S0084	yeah but it need to not look like we've start a fire in the house because that might negate any kind of insurance issue
S0041	well
S0084	what would they do
S0041	candle
S0084	what be the law
S0041	some you go and have a um bath with candle
S0084	yeah but that still make it my fault
S0041	and then
S0084	then doesn't it it need to be not my fault
S0041	oh
S0084	because then
S0041	but you can't you can get on your insurance for accidental damage can't you
S0084	oh i dunno prob prob not
S0041	prob not
S0084	i don't i don't think would have that i think would have the law that say that we have to pay
S0041	oh should we ask to see her insurance policies
S0084	i think she
S0041	do you think that would be a bite suspicious
S0084	i think she might laugh in your face and say what insurance
S0041	what's insurance what be that
S0084	gas man
S0041	gas
S0084	certify gas man no no clive
S0041	do she say anything at whatever come of burn yourself in the shower be she come to fix that
S0084	oh no i speak to her on sunday and she say well there's nothing i can do about it one week it's cold and one week it's hot um so she sort of kick off and she say to that he have to call him on sunday although i dunno if he do
S0041	oh
S0084	um so basically the long and short of it be make sure that nothing be on i e some really inconsiderate person flush the toilet
S0041	yes
S0084	while you're shower
S0041	yes yep
S0084	that's my personal fav because i don't like skin on my shoulder
S0041	no you didn't want
S0084	so
S0041	you want that to be scald off
S0041	third degree burn yep
S0084	so she do me a massive favour wash machine don't get in when the wash machine's on
S0041	no no have we try this shower of late
S0084	anna have a shower in there the other day
S0041	mm
S0084	er but i didn't see her after post shower to ask how offensive it be
S0041	ah
S0084	um but she shower in it i think it be better than the burn yourself alive shower
S0041	mm the thing i don't like though be it's small
S0084	yeah
S0041	that's the problem
S0084	it's er it's an enclose space isn't it i i get a bite freak out
S0041	mm
S0084	wall be cave in
S0041	i'm just scar that the thing's gonna touch me
S0084	yeah you don't want that
S0041	i hate that
S0084	mm no no no
S0041	mm
S0084	right then
S0041	bloody
S0084	i know bloody inconsiderate
S0041	my life my life yeah so i'll look at the photo photograph
S0084	yep
S0041	what have i do with bertie
S0084	he could be anywhere let's be honest
S0041	oh frig bertie always run off
S0084	he like to have adventure
S0041	i think i might have take him into my room you know
S0084	probably know you
S0041	bertie
S0084	he's just too small
S0041	yeah he's i think he must be in the room
S0084	er oh he's on your bookcase
S0041	yep that's exactly where i put him yeah
S0084	now you've remember
S0041	have a look at some photies
S0084	hmm
S0041	have a look at some photograph read some navy and go to sleep i think
S0084	mm
S0041	and then get up for the first what time's the early bus
S0084	the first one be six forty
S0041	six forty
S0084	which be a mother bitch that's the one i get to work
S0041	and then there's seven ten
S0084	and they get you in at like ten to and then there's seven ten yeah
S0041	i'm gonna have to sit and work out my clock
S0084	god
S0041	i can't do that in my head
S0084	well hang on seven ten will get you to town at quarter past seven get into the hotel by twenty past get in the gym by half past so in theory you could be in the gym for seven thirty
S0041	and then
S0084	and then work out for an hour
S0041	i get an hour
S0084	eight thirty shower till nine so really you could get the seven forty
S0041	do you think
S0084	yeah cos seven forty would get although you you've gotta
S0041	then i'd be in the gym and ready to go for eight an hour will take me to nine my hair take quite a long time to do and sometimes i take longer than an hour in the gym
S0084	the thing be by that point you've say the bus sometimes go a bite shit
S0041	yeah
S0084	with the time so you're better off get an earlier bus
S0041	so
S0084	and then at least know you're there
S0041	seven forty do you no
S0084	seven ten
S0041	seven ten
S0084	because seven forty you'll get catch up in the school traffic
S0041	yep seven ten then i can be in the gym for half past i probably will be there more nearer twenty to cos i'm
S0084	mm
S0041	i've leave my trackies and stuff at work
S0084	mhm well that's fine then you don't have to rush cos then you're in the gym till like half eight quarter to nine
S0041	yep
S0084	shower
S0041	the worst part be
S0084	wash your hair
S0041	whenever you go to the gym in the morning like all the people that be allow to use the gym i e the hotel and all the john lewis staff
S0084	mhm
S0041	come in
S0084	they're all they're all in
S0041	and work out all the men hmm
S0084	mm
S0041	it's me and like three guy and they're obviously just you know work out all the time all
S0084	hench
S0041	yeah all buff and
S0084	mhm
S0041	i'm die of death
S0084	yeah well just ignore them i mean they just love themselves
S0041	and
S0084	they're not look at you they're just look at themselves
S0041	and it's so funny like there's a couple of guy that'll come in and usually they'll start they'll come in the same time as i do so they see me look normal
S0084	mm
S0041	and you can see them eye me up a bite
S0084	mm
S0041	and it's the funniest thing cos obviously after like twenty minutes
S0084	mm
S0041	completely different person
S0084	mm
S0041	bright red cover in sweat look like death
S0084	mm
S0041	and you're think ha ha you didn't see that come do you
S0084	mm
S0084	i think but i think blokes
S0041	gutted
S0084	blokes quite like it actually like a sweaty woman i think it just remind them of sex i think they quite like it
S0041	mm
S0084	i mean presumably unless you're do er some crazy acrobatics in the bedroom you're probably not gonna get as much of a sweat up as you do if you run five k
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	i dunno i mean i dunno what you get up to in there
S0084	but um
S0041	definitely there's no
S0041	like when i run it would it literally dribble down me
S0084	it's when it's in the hair as well isn't it that's what i can't stand
S0041	it's the worst
S0084	that make me really upset and then when you've like stop do your cardio and you do a bite of weight and then it get all cold like the sweat go cold i don't like that
S0041	it be the worst isn't it
S0084	yeah it's really horrid
S0041	it's the worst
S0084	wuh
S0041	i'm gonna have to and i'm gonna google run shoe as well

S0041	cos i remember the boobage no it's a sixteen cos the boobage wouldn't fit in a fourteen
S0084	right
S0041	it's the boobage i'm concern about cos the boobage hasn't move

S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	the dress should still fit

S0084	corsages leather jacket
S0041	and under garment
S0084	and big hat
S0041	and big hat
S0084	to detract from anything else

S0084	oh that's so nice
S0041	really lovely but i've only ever have it on once

S0084	yeah the bangers
S0041	yeah i mean it's it's rather strange look
S0084	it's really pretty
S0041	but um i think i need to wear it

S0041	and the hooker heel will keep it off the floor
S0084	yeah what do you what shoe do you wear with it last time
S0041	i don't remember i honestly don't remember
S0084	hmm

S0041	the problem be
S0084	walk
S0041	i don't wanna fall over in the hooker heel
S0084	yep but that's fine cos we're get a cab from the hotel to the wed
S0041	yep
S0084	party bus from the wed to the reception and then cab from reception to our hotel
S0041	well that's fine
S0084	so really i mean er dance might be a bite of an issue this be a wed and all presumably there will be dance
S0041	oh yeah
S0084	um
S0041	mm
S0084	but apart from that i mean the heel can just come off can't they i think it's gonna be a bite of a free for all
S0041	yeah
S0084	by that point no one'll be stand
S0041	yeah
S0084	everyone'll be lie down
S0041	and actually they're quite comfortable it's more risk of break your ankles than
S0084	yeah
S0041	hurt your feet
S0084	oh i wouldn't advise dance on them
S0041	no although i have
S0084	right
S0041	round the place
S0084	right
S0041	but i need some new liners for them that's what i need

S0041	insoles cos they're get a bite big now cos they be a six and i
S0084	mm
S0041	should've get a five but i didn't
S0084	mm that's
S0041	even though i have the opportunity to but i didn't
S0084	that's probably better though isn't it really cos when they're smaller then they pinch
