S0179	and so the other thing to do would be to erm when you've do that
S0058	erm yeah i've put it in now hang on
S0020	and which and what proportion of the so how much do you get pay for the gap between word
S0058	right pause yeah it's it's it's like you know you see some get an hour and it's largely silence
S0179	and what what you of course do be erm post process it to erm increase part of it should increase the size of the gap because you might be able to
S0058	yes you could record half an hour and string it out yeah
S0020	erm just record tv
S0058	er
S0058	yes also yeah
S0020	with eastenders and not be and then you might not pay
S0058	yeah probably not
S0179	you'd probably need to avoid theme tune
S0058	yeah yeah a little music not so much actually the
S0179	advert
S0058	theme scene change might be hard to explain suddenly you're in the pub yeah
S0020	advert uh it sound like
S0058	well yeah if if you erm if you fancy do it yeah i can send you the the
S0020	yeah
S0058	if you erm i'm think of the best way to do it er do you just send me an email at my work address erm at which all
S0179	you've already get that
S0058	oh yeah i i'll always copy it into an email when you be argue about
S0179	yes exactly
S0020	yes i've probably delete those
S0058	okay
S0179	yeah but it would have save it as an address if you've send something to it would have
S0020	oh that's true
S0179	save it
S0020	probably true yes yeah
S0058	yeah erm
S0020	what's your second name
S0020	
S0058	i e as as in mourn
S0020	right
S0179	as in widow and not as in armour
S0020	yeah
S0179	it be fantastic last weekend so we spend erm about four or five hours drive up and then down to and from sunderland and it er sort of
S0020	cover your petrol
S0179	erm more than yes
S0058	yeah
S0179	it actually leave you in profit
S0020	yeah
S0058	well i suppose you can go out for a meal and stick the recorder on the table and
S0020	do it have to be grow up
S0058	yes ideally yeah
S0020	okay right
S0058	erm because it's from a permission's point of view like
S0020	sorry
S0058	from a permission's point of view
S0179	well no because that's in so for example 's children he could give permission for them
S0058	no but erm it's slightly you know we have to have a different consent form and sort of so it be easier and that's alright
S0020	okay
S0058	erm
S0179	but be it possible
S0058	not really we've say no for this project it be it be possible but
S0179	oh
S0058	we've say no for this project
S0058	because it make even more it make it more difficult from a permissions perspective because you know every person who speak have to sign a consent form to say that they give their consent for the the
S0020	okay so
S0058	erm so
S0020	so you need for me to sign a consent form
S0058	for this yeah if that's alright but it's not a complicate one erm but you know
S0020	right
S0058	erm but yeah just because we can't record people without them know or without them give their consent it's just you know really complicate
S0020	even though the data be well i mean apart from the person record the data
S0058	yeah
S0020	it's completely anonymous isn't it
S0058	yes erm but we erm you you're just not allow to record people without them know and also it's useful to have things like people erm so the form ask to give your first language which be useful
S0020	okay
S0058	to store
S0179	erm you be erm well i think when you're film something in a public location you're gonna capture image
S0058	yeah
S0179	i think it's more for the sort of best practice point of view
S0058	oh no yeah well yeah fair enough but we we personally we don't it's not the do thing it's now how we work
S0020	okay i see
S0058	yeah
S0020	okay well what be you up to this weekend
S0058	erm we're go to see erm 's grandfather
S0179	in
S0020	okay
S0179	this be erm so the funeral i go to be his wife
S0020	okay right your grandmother
S0179	er no my step grandmother
S0020	your step grandmother
S0179	erm but it it be erm i haven't actually be down since for various reason we get snow off one weekend
S0058	yeah we we get kind of we get as far as woking the night before and then get a phone call say yeah er be it twelve inch forecast turn round
S0020	okay
S0058	so yeah erm yeah so
S0179	you know you might be
S0058	it be yeah
S0058	yeah so it's probably and then it be half term so like sort of the the two weekend that i half term so we didn't go
S0179	which
S0020	why be half term a reason not to go
S0179	oh well the a303 which be the main way to get to devon and cornwall
S0020	oh i see it be really busy
S0179	er yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	and it's almost impassable really and literally quite happy to spend eight hours
S0020	yeah
S0179	do a two hour journey
S0058	we do it once didn't we and it be
S0020	my grandmother live in so erm you have a choice to go the a303or the m something or other
S0179	the m4or the m5
S0020	the m5 yes we always after a couple of go on the a303 er we give up on that and we always go the m4 m5
S0020	you know it's longer and it's it's
S0179	well here it's quite a bite further erm cos harpenden it's a bite well i suppose there be coordinate on that map but ehit's erm well we generally go er to my parents' the night before because it mean we get to er
S0020	right yes
S0179	see them for a bite as well
S0058	mm and it break up the drive a little bite
S0179	in this case we're also go to grandfather's afterwards or actually they'll be there ah ah
S0020	what
S0179	no house key
S0058	really
S0179	yeah
S0058	okay right so we're go
S0020	you've leave your house key on your desk
S0179	no no erm i've leave my house key for my parents' house at home
S0020	ah
S0058	right
S0179	er
S0058	so we need to go back to
S0179	no no they're in tonight
S0058	oh they're in tonight oh
S0179	we're go for dinner with them
S0058	oh oh so they might have a spare key
S0179	yeah they will have a spare set
S0058	oh that's fine
S0179	yeah i know it's not disastrous
S0058	alright okay
S0058	yeah
S0179	it's just a bite annoy that's a really cool number plate maybe it's the name of a teletubby
S0058	or
S0179	erm o b o b e maybe
S0058	o b e probably wouldn't have it advertise like that unless it's erm olivier barnard er or oliver oscar
S0179	possibly i still don't like personalise number plat
S0058	mm
S0179	i mean they're just they're all like a lot of things that people spend money on like luxuries or whatever and number plate that money really could be starve orphan and it would make a difference to you
S0020	yeah
S0058	i mean limit the amount of joy it can bring you
S0020	i do once see a erm a number plate on a motorbike and it spell dick knob
S0020	you know you think yes you be
S0058	oh
S0020	put that on there the dvla issue
S0058	yeah yeah and that bring other people lot of joy
S0020	yeah
S0020	well not really they don't they don't issue ones that's
S0058	no
S0020	or swear word
S0179	or probably one that's not erm that's not actually profane
S0058	er well if it be n o v
S0020	it be n o v
S0058	yeah you'd probably be alright then so it probably isn't in their erm their list
S0020	yeah well anyway that's what it say
S0058	yeah
S0020	just not
S0058	mm
S0179	yes
S0058	erm we get
S0179	yeah
S0058	oh yeah
S0179	oh yeah it doesn't really do
S0020	erm tomorrow
S0020	try to decide on saturday
S0058	yeah
S0020	early early spring
S0179	i do love not have a garden
S0020	well have garden
S0179	well the only
S0020	but it be a lot of work
S0058	yeah
S0179	the only benefit i can think of be the space to put a jacuzzi
S0058	i think interest in garden at all so i think
S0020	interest in garden when i be in my mid twenties
S0058	yeah
S0179	early twenties
S0179	i'm not twenty four yet erm
S0179	yeah
S0020	in many ways i still garden but i do enjoy have a garden
S0058	yeah yeah
S0020	i don't particularly mind the occasional job like the annual job like or like clean out the fish pond
S0058	right
S0020	they're all erm that's what i remember most
S0058	yeah
S0020	i don't mind mow a lawn you know if you do it on a sunny day it's not unpleasant
S0058	yeah
S0179	to be honest i think i'll wait to have a garden until i can afford a gardener
S0058	yeah that's the way to do it
S0020	yeah we look at get a gardener this time last year and decide it be too expensive
S0058	yeah
S0020	well there be that as well
S0058	yeah
S0020	i mean that we be talk about a cleaner cleaner that i be will to a cleaner
S0179	well we do
S0058	yeah we do yeah
S0020	it just depend on what you want to spend your money on but erm the only hesitation i have be that it mean the kid aren't aren't learn how to do the chores
S0058	yeah well i mean we do them for a bite so you know we're we're all with clean the entire household
S0179	well the way i look at it be it would take us twice as long
S0058	yeah
S0179	to do it half as well
S0020	yeah
S0058	she spend an hour and she get the place spotless
S0179	and that's the entire place
S0058	yeah
S0179	and for nine pound
S0020	it sound like you've get a good cleaner
S0058	she's very good yeah but yeah it could take us twice that and it wouldn't be as good so we'll
S0020	we'll have an agency in erm so every now and again you change cleaners
S0058	oh right
S0020	and so when you've get a good one you're lucky
S0179	well we've get the daughter of our neighbour's which be quite useful
S0058	yes
S0179	because accountability
S0020	yes yes
S0058	that's why we think it would be a good idea just
S0020	well there
S0058	rather than have some random person you know like a bite like an agency and it's just that extra level of
S0020	yes although there's also so my parent in law have a cleaner for the same cleaner for like twenty years or something and so they there be a relationship there
S0058	mm
S0020	but as a consequence they didn't they didn't feel able they be able to push things like to use real polish and not mr sheen
S0058	right
S0020	on the on the grandfather antique grandfather clock or
S0058	yes
S0179	well on the other hand i i mean that relationship sort of have to be sort of build on foundations as in
S0058	mm
S0179	early on if you're sort of open about what you expect
S0058	yeah
S0020	i think that's right i think early on you only have to say look you be not use mr sheen on the antique grandfather clock you're use real polish
S0058	yeah yeah
S0020	and if you don't we won't pay you
S0058	in all fairness though
S0179	you may choose not to continue come
S0058	yeah it all depend i mean erm ours be very kind of if you don't want like anything do you know the way i do it everyone like it different just say please tell me don't just you know worry about say things she be really kind of keen that we'd say if we like it do differently but it be all it be fine and we didn't need to say a thing and she be very
S0020	i think my parent in law be a bite erm when it come to things like that as well they carry on employ her erm and she she gradually get older and older older and have to retire and they carry on employ her for some time after she be actually prove useful
S0058	yes
S0020	you know but er i think it be more her eye she wasn't really able to spot the dirty bits
S0058	oh that's sad yeah oh in all fairness though i mean your mam's have the same cleaner for how many years
S0058	yeah and she's great and they get on like a house on fire
S0179	yeah and she's get a erm it actually work very well because i mean she's get a erm a er a fairly young son he's probably about i don't know ten now erm who erm use to come and sort of sit and and such a nice well mannered little boy erm and so i've erm we we recently get rid of some er dvds some harry potter dvds because we've now get the
S0020	oh yeah
S0179	erm and and erm so i've return them back to my mother to give to a charity shop and er she suggest that might like and er and then at the weekend we get a lovely thank you card from him
S0020	oh yeah
S0058	it be really sweet yeah
S0179	erm but it also work very well because erm both er her son and herself get on very well with our dog and when my mum start to work she use to work sort of eighty percent of the time erm a lot at home and when she start to work full time more of it out of home she erm it be very useful to have someone to come in and walk the dog at lunchtime
S0058	mm
S0179	which she would do and she'd sort of take that as her erm her lunch break so to speak so it get to a very useful arrangement at the end
S0058	mm
S0020	oh by the way how long be this project go on for
S0058	this one erm
S0020	yeah how much or how much money i can make
S0058	yeah erm
S0179	which if you need to pay tax on it or
S0020	well there be that as well
S0058	yeah
S0179	shh
S0020	i know
S0058	oh dear erm yes er well it it's go on until erm the begin of april
S0020	okay
S0058	but but kind of for this phase and there might be erm kind of some more after that
S0020	right
S0058	but we don't know yet
S0020	okay
S0058	erm so yeah until the begin of april
S0179	but this be quite meta or at least this be be study disrupt what be study because
S0058	mm
S0179	quite a lot of the conversation be about record and about record so the word will come up disproportionately
S0058	it it doesn't actually because most people like i've listen back to the begin and most people don't use that word they just say it's gonna be use for book it's use for research
S0179	right research book
S0058	yeah
S0179	but those will still be disproportionately represent
S0058	yes in a way in a way
S0179	er but i tend to talk more about statistics so
S0058	yeah
S0020	well yes i mean you you're not try to do sample of people who you're record be you
S0058	no no
S0020	so you know
S0179	i think those be word which really occur to me
S0058	hmm
S0179	i still think you should have employ a statistician
S0058	mm
S0020	you know the fact that it's presumably friends and family of employees
S0058	erm not only we we do also just advertise
S0020	okay
S0058	for people to so yeah but it's it kind of erm yeah some of it be friends and family of employees some of it's erm you know just random as in their friends and family
S0179	and again there's a boundary layer of both sort of intelligence or sort of literacy and wealth because not only do you have to be literate but you need to be able to afford a recorder
S0020	afford a recorder
S0058	well the the freelancers have to erm pay for their own or have one already a recorder erm
S0020	so you're gonna make me pay for a recorder
S0058	do you have anything that will record
S0179	your phone will probably probably would
S0058	yeah er er oh yeah this be do you do you have anything that will record like audio file
S0020	no i don't
S0058	no
S0020	probably the phone will
S0058	yeah
S0020	er
S0058	what have you get er
S0020	how much be those recorders
S0058	you can pay anything between about twenty thirty up to about two hundred and fifty
S0020	i see
S0058	so you can get a
S0058	no don't worry
S0058	you'd really you know you
S0020	as a money make scheme
S0058	that's not great no
S0058	erm yeah you can get a decent enough little dictaphone i think which should be
S0020	okay
S0058	fine and if you're not too bother about have lot of function which which you don't
S0058	yeah
S0179	what you should do be just strike up a conversation with some people the train or like
S0058	may be yeah
S0179	you would have to get them to sign so people be go to be a bite suspicious
S0058	mm
S0179	i should think go into a pub like okay i'll buy you a drink if you'll talk to me for an hour
S0058	yeah yeah you can do that
S0020	well i'm sure the barman's always will to do that
S0058	yeah that's true actually probably
S0179	or barmaid even better
S0058	i think so bar staff be actually bar staff and there would never be an advert for a barmaid and it wouldn't be your job title
S0179	well no an advert for a barmaid minimum requirements
S0058	yeah exactly
S0179	i'm sure that must have exist at some point
S0058	yeah the seventies probably
S0179	topless waitress although so so it's er a book of old laws i've get and it's just
S0020	yeah best one off to the pub
S0179	yeah erm a bite of creative steer different then erm erm so erm a book of erm old er english laws and
S0020	right
S0179	one of them be that the seventies erm a bylaw pass in birmingham that erm in an effort to er combat
S0020	yeah
S0179	in an effort to combat the immoral indecencies of erm topless er dancers and waitress it be er
S0020	it's not
S0179	it be require that erm slick it be require that all erm all all er go go dancers wear er brassieres
S0020	right
S0179	the law be later amend erm to reflect that it be possibly unnecessary for male go go dancers to
S0058	excellent
S0020	i like that
S0179	the erm statutory duty for
S0058	shit
S0020	right
S0179	sort of state
S0179	not only which but they're also responsible for the of park sign city
S0058	right

S0058	well yeah very very long but erm that's good yeah i mean be you think about get your reader's card
S0179	er i probably should from a work perspective
S0058	yeah
S0179	mind you
S0058	no yeah you only need to do it when they're in and i don't know when the office be open it must be open at a reasonable time sort of saturdays or something but erm
S0179	a week
S0058	yeah but as in they might be close at they might be open between nine and five during the week
S0058	yeah and especially if you go in and they're kind of erm there's a random time rather than be the middle of the academic year you've gotta be erm
S0179	what's the goal
S0058	erm i can't remember i don't think anything i think it's one of those and
S0058	yeah they'll probably be they'll be give you an id but then they can check so that they can check if you're the who do english at and then you know then then really you could prove that you're i can't remember erm i'll look at the website and it'll tell you
S0179	it doesn't
S0058	oh have you look
S0058	it be sad that i know the old website off by heart
S0179	particular website
S0058	dot cam dot after uk
S0058	but erm yeah but you'd need need to come in and tell me you be fine still
S0179	well i have point out that it's like give any time
S0058	yeah yeah if i have more erm but i mean what i could do er and i don't know
S0179	drive into
S0058	fair enough yeah it actually wouldn't take me any time at all really because i could do it on the way back on an even
S0179	yeah exactly
S0058	maybe i should try it
S0058	maybe so that's come
S0179	out
S0058	out
S0058	mm i mean do you think there's some people who kind of yeah have like a flat in london
S0179	yeah quite a few but probably not
S0058	yeah friend's dad have a flat in london and he stay in it one time erm
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah yeah it be water actually erm
S0179	i find it difficult to believe that a chairman of the water company's earn that much
S0058	why the fact that they've get a big house in edinburgh or you know the suburbs of edinburgh and a flat a nice flat in london
S0179	so probably quite conceivably a million a piece
S0058	mm yeah i don't know what erm what her mam do she might be very highly up as well
S0179	doubtful
S0058	yeah i know it's true erm you tend not to get one high power one housewife slash london
S0179	yeah
S0058	i be just think today how much i like my job it's good
S0179	sorry
S0058	just i be think to myself i really like my job i'm please with my job
S0179	yeah today
S0058	mm i be think that erm interview i don't know i be think about erm yeah interview and how hard so many and how they could all be so different
S0179	how do you mean
S0058	well that i could have get a less good job or a less interest job i could have get a job basically file for some not very good company erm and just be in some kind of yeah not a very good position and it would have take me so much longer to er you know i would have obviously work my way up i wouldn't have stay in a bad job as long as i've stay in these job but
S0058	grumpy it wouldn't be that feel grumpy
S0058	you know so erm i'm a bite confuse so tomorrow the plan be your parent be gonna be there tonight and they're they're drive up through tomorrow as well
S0179	yeah they're gonna go through later
S0058	ah oh yeah that be it wasn't it so we're gonna see him during the day then we'll leave and they'll
S0179	well they'll probably arrive mid to late afternoon
S0058	yeah so we can leave when they arrive sort of thing
S0179	yes
S0058	yeah and stay overnight yeah
S0179	yes they be
S0058	okay so we'll have have the house to ourselves on saturday night when
S0179	yes
S0058	right
S0058	it's not likely
S0179	yes
S0058	i'll probably just watch masterchef and i like it if i'm honest i love masterchef
S0179	you're weird
S0058	have you ever watch it
S0058	it's really good i don't know why it's so good it's just it's just really interest i think cos it move quite quickly especially when there's quite a few contestants erm so it's just yeah like fun and i'm i'm interest in cook other people
S0179	yes but quite probably doesn't look that good
S0058	i agree but i think like the past pick the so they can pick the main course out and it would be
S0179	i think it's a question of use
S0058	oh definitely yeah but erm but it's like they could you know it's like they pick out nice look meals from it i mean there's one which look really nice which be salmon which you do in the oven and you sort of get two nice big bits of salmon and you go make like a paste to cook it with and then you do a kind of a erm a noodle y soup and stuff to go with it erm which be really good
S0179	we'll have to decide what we're do for dinner tomorrow night
S0058	ah because we'll be at your parents' er we can cook something
S0179	fish and chip
S0058	yes yeah
S0179	i think we could get fish and chip
S0058	oh yeah yeah that be good i mean we could cook fish and chip but with posh fish but i've no idea well er i'm not deep fry anything
S0179	i'm sure
S0058	oh yeah usually it's alright
S0179	it's very nice
S0058	be it posh or just nice
S0179	it's just not as good as gardener's
S0058	yeah that's the pinnacle of kebab shop
S0179	but that's not posh though it's just nice
S0058	cos gardie's i don't know it's kind of posh in that it's cos they're like a sunderland kebab shop gardie's be really posh cos it's actually greek
S0179	but that doesn't do you think that make it posh
S0058	i dunno but but rather than like all the meat and chip it's
S0179	yeah but to go there
S0058	yeah
S0179	kebab shop you get a businessman come in late
S0058	fair enough
S0179	off the late train you know that's
S0058	yeah well you know me
S0179	what
S0058	you know me i'm always up for a bite of kebab shop
S0058	give your parent the voucher
S0179	go and enjoy yourselves we're in for a low budget option
S0058	yeah low budget
S0179	well they're different
S0058	yeah relatively speak obviously well erm i'm gonna place my bet now i place my bet your dad will have erm
S0058	er hang on he doesn't have a starter and then he get the erm
S0179	he do have a starter
S0058	i don't think he do i think he get
S0179	he do it's mum who doesn't
S0058	oh no yeah erm a salad chicken or salad i think anyway then the main course he's gonna have the thing with the aubergine and the cheese sauce meth something something i can't remember and then some dough ball on the side
S0179	to be fair to him if he enjoy it that's all that matter
S0058	oh no i'm not say it's a bad thing it's just it's like it's very sweet it's a different okay
S0179	but again what a useful time to put a signal on
S0058	yeah
S0179	when you've just come
S0058	when you've just yeah
S0179	to a halt the point isn't tell me you're about to turn the point be tell me that you be just about to come to a dead halt
S0058	yeah people don't think these things through yeah it's just so your dad's be just so different to mine i think it's sweet i think it's nice it bring him joy oh and you've get that bottle of erm
S0179	i know
S0058	for him do you think he'll like it
S0179	i think he'll like the gesture yes
S0058	fair enough horrible
S0179	i like this it make drive more interest
S0058	yeah exactly flat roads
S0179	yeah i mean they do
S0058	no on a slow road then
S0179	a slow road to speed bump possibly way
S0179	in a way
S0058	in your way
S0179	you see cos this be a very difficult go back to
S0058	mm mm
S0179	drive back
S0058	yeah well
S0179	that be not
S0058	yes well people think you would be it's not horrendous it's just
S0179	no but i mean you go at the right time limit
S0058	yeah that's true yeah we've do it
S0179	and it's it's cheaper and much bigger than i expect
S0058	yeah
S0179	i like that
S0058	and i mean that's that's a good commute that's less than i can do on some days it's ridiculous but true
S0179	yes but so you've come out and you've
S0058	it's ridiculous isn't it
S0179	professional
S0179	and they're probably think it's okay to drive test it's not okay
S0058	yeah be this drive test
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	there's no reason not to
S0058	mm
S0179	a clear open road good weather good visibility
S0058	yeah so it's just
S0179	it's daft
S0058	now due care and attention
S0179	yeah well that would be the yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	yes it's possible either way
S0058	it's an offence
S0179	it'd be a traffic offence
S0058	yeah
S0179	er
S0179	drive test you would be
S0058	mm and you can't just trawl around the roads at twenty
S0179	in essence yes
S0058	we get an email through one today say erm there's be a crackdown on cyclists so erm fifteen cyclists have be give thirty pound spot fin for things like not have light and go through red light and cycle on the paths weee
S0179	fifteen hundred if you be keen
S0058	mm well yeah i think erm they say it's special constable and i think they've go out and just sort of yeah i mean they must have be not be terribly strict because yeah i don't know
S0179	you could just
S0058	unless they've make themselves very visible because cyclists will tend not to cycle through a red light if there's a policeman stand on the corner watch
S0179	well i've see them do it
S0058	have you
S0179	it doesn't occur to them that it's wrong
S0058	mm in all fairness erm like the first they've get they've get the health and safety guy send around and he send erm an email you know erm so just you know be aware please stop and get yourself a pair of light you know it's cheaper than a fine no it's not thirty pound be cheap for a pair of light if not decent ones
S0179	they give you a pair as well don't they
S0058	they didn't mention that on the thing but yeah the last time they do it they do so i be like no no it's cheaper to get fin you know
S0179	not repeatedly
S0058	no no true but if you get the free light it's cheaper to get fin and get the free light than to
S0179	yes but i think because miss it's cheaper to get the light than to pay for your
S0058	yeah well that's
S0058	he do he do then say erm you know instead of erm have an accident when your light's on
S0179	yeah
S0058	it's a critical thing oh yeah i'm not regret buy my bike light i haven't use them for so
S0179	basically
S0058	that's poor
S0179	you've decide you're gonna do forty five for the entire
S0058	thirty
S0179	it do seem to be slow down slightly
S0058	oh yeah
S0179	yeah
S0058	i might give a ring tomorrow night
S0179	sorry
S0058	i might give a ring tomorrow night
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah if you're not gonna be er around for a little while
S0179	i suppose you and she have more to talk about than in general
S0058	we do cos her life's quite interest at the minute or just
S0179	well i'm not say life's bore but she's get like house and baby
S0058	yeah yeah and we've get a lot kind of i don't know we can talk about the house
S0179	yes
S0058	i think which i think she like and the baby's just yeah i wonder if she know yet
S0179	no it would have be on facebook if she know
S0058	that's what i mean i haven't see her facebook page in a few days be you friends with her on facebook
S0179	yes
S0058	have you see days see her facebook page
S0179	no
S0058	mm she didn't put she be pregnant on facebook it come out because someone else comment something about my pregnant fay erm and but she didn't put a space up on it
S0179	okay
S0058	she's not like she facebook it tend to be all of her space tend to be
S0179	that she
S0058	that yeah her be annoy about someone be erm in a you know a particular way erm but she tend not to actually use it as a kind of
S0179	she use it to make sly comment and that's about it
S0058	yeah pretty much yeah erm
S0179	oh and excessive pdas with er
S0058	yeah oh that's alright
S0179	no
S0058	i use to dislike that but now you know now they're actually kind of have a baby and move in i'm like glad that there's excessive pdas
S0179	yes compensate for
S0058	the pdas you might not have
S0179	you mean ddas
S0058	what's ddas
S0179	discrete display
S0058	yeah exactly nice i don't think it would be another word for private
S0179	i indoors
S0058	indoors be perfect you know the pdas indoors though
S0179	oh well you could you could term public as be outside
S0058	you could but you'd also define the term public as be
S0179	yes yes obviously
S0058	in mm mm
S0179	yeah ah
S0179	bore about my interest
S0058	mm
S0179	this would be so mind numb to have to drive
S0058	yeah
S0179	one do to work
S0058	and frustrate right at the end of your journey
S0058	to have to sort of sit on this bite and oh god
S0179	and it's just so bore because it it's it's very pointless back there it have up to it
S0058	yeah
S0179	along here perhaps national
S0058	right well
S0179	which it be restrict
S0058	wow so you really could just bomb along yeah a lot
S0179	because the place
S0058	yeah oh i've finish my erm my third of the three book
S0058	mm yeah
S0058	yeah i've enjoy them so i'm go to erm get myself along to heffers and er pick out some more i'm hop for another three because i think six book for thirty pound be do pretty well in this day and age
S0179	i agree the book shop
S0058	what the one in ely
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah i know that's the problem because you're like cos book tokens you can but not erm
S0179	book tokens
S0058	they're just a company i think as in there's like a logo and stuff and you can buy like the one i've i've buy my dad's bible with be just a generic book token
S0179	so how do that work
S0058	i'm not sure exactly how that work to be honest
S0179	because store obviously it would make sense to give tokens out because they
S0058	yeah
S0179	but
S0058	i'm not sure i guess maybe that in from the perspective of it make people come into buy book
S0179	or they they give them sort of ninety percent of the
S0058	mm
S0179	or another sort of ten percent of the cost
S0058	maybe i don't really know how it work to be honest
S0179	okay ask in that shop
S0058	that would be interest yeah just and just to find out
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah erm yeah i mean as it happen heffers be an extremely good bookshop erm so but if they're get a token be fine because you know it's a really good bookshop and it have all kinds of interest things
S0179	do it online and heffers
S0058	yeah true
S0179	however the erm it's interest well you've get two amaze bookshops not to mention a very good library all in close proximity
S0179	thank you for god sake's how do i do that
S0058	you wouldn't be able to do that again if you try
S0179	no
S0058	wow blimey
S0058	i'm sure it happen to the best of you drivers
S0179	it have not once every couple of years
S0058	yeah
S0179	unusual circumstances
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	but why would i how's the engine not restart i'm completely out of practice if you're start from a stall
S0058	oh right yeah whereas i'd probably restart from a stall quite well but that's largely because i stall every few minutes
S0179	yeah
S0058	you know if you never stall it's not good
S0179	it just sort of i still
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	i wasn't think about it either that's a problem when you just yeah
S0058	when you kind of just go along
S0179	yeah
S0058	you don't need to worry about it essentially yeah
S0179	yes exactly oh god
S0058	mm
S0058	no worry
