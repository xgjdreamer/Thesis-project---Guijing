S0684	be this european fund
S0686	erm no it's a lot of it's chinese back investments
S0684	but you're not gonna that here
S0686	no no no manchester's a very desirable place to be at the moment
S0685	well it's become a business area
S0686	well the thing be if there's no you know either either the young people they they stay and they're jobless there you know they don't have much of a a future in these towns so they leave and the towns themselves don't have any teachers because all the young people leave
S0685	yeah it's a bite strange i be in the car go back one night with er with my pal and
S0686	yeah
S0685	he say you know you know everybody respect you here because you've get away you've make something of your life and i think that be dreadful you know
S0686	what that people respect you or that
S0685	for that
S0686	for that
S0685	for that for that that you'd actually do it you'd actually up and leave
S0684	it's the same with all place i mean in if you've go away and make something of your life you're respect more than if you stay
S0685	mm i mean i don't think i could have stay i mean er i you know there's a point where you feel like your home town be like your parent you know they be so that you can carve your own life and be so different in many ways from the valleys it could have be sixteen hundred miles away not miles away but you know in a sense and i've i've go that far from home that it's
S0686	have go that far from what sorry
S0685	well you know it's it's you know i think it be just it's not not really a huge feat it's not like it's go and live in a foreign country
S0686	it do feel like a a different world though
S0685	it be significantly different
S0686	another world yeah
S0685	yeah erm i'm more comfortable down here than i be in
S0686	what with the people
S0685	yeah i can read them down here you you can have
S0684	er do i turn here no
S0685	no
S0685	you can have this very kind of dry humour
S0686	yeah you want that one
S0685	be it erm
S0686	no it's redirect you
S0684	be it
S0686	it be yeah it's redirect you
S0684	i've get to turn the car
S0685	there's a kind of dry humour here that you can operate on erm which be very kind of not deflate of others but self deflate
S0686	do you think it's friendlier
S0685	yeah i do
S0684	do you not think so
S0686	it's difficult to know cos it you know the
S0685	in some ways they're a little shy of outsiders erm but once they get to know you they're very loyal
S0684	now which way do i go
S0686	go down
S0685	down
S0686	that way
S0684	i can't see
S0686	because you don't get that many outsiders
S0684	er
S0685	well it's build on outsiders cos it be a large jewish irish italians smaller spanish populations
S0686	now i mean i don't
S0685	not now
S0686	you don't get many visitors do you
S0685	no but you know it be it wasn't a town because of the industrial revolution it be build on immigration
S0686	yeah yeah
S0685	so we've always have erm it i suppose it think like the chapels and the collieries be the be the kind of common denominators it wasn't about
S0684	well why be they vote against
S0685	i don't know i don't know i mean you wouldn't get all that many polish people move into area or area you don't get the
S0686	well that yeah that's what they be say you know like people some people in the valleys have say you know oh immigration sort of things but
S0685	it doesn't affect them up there
S0686	yeah the it's get the lowest level i think of migrant population in the uk around here
S0685	but it's it's in a
S0684	cos there be no job here
S0685	mm
S0686	that's
S0684	why would anyone want to move here
S0686	well i think to me you know a possible explanation could be that you know there there be no job there be you know lot of people who don't see a future and they think something have to change and you know they you know the way that the eu have be make a scapegoat
S0684	but this be not
S0685	mm
S0684	yeah
S0686	for everything that that they think it's that you know you're go well maybe if we leave europe there'll be er you know more job and
S0684	this be how
S0686	for their future but
S0684	be make isn't it by people believe things that be not true
S0685	yeah it's just also a history completely forget it's about education in the end
S0684	this be how the nazis rise isn't it
S0686	well the rise of nationalism and er poor economic time yes
S0684	yeah and people think that oh maybe they the nazis have the the answer
S0686	or that's it isn't it yeah and it the the the parallel be frighten but also the lack of recognition of the parallel be also frighten and people don't they don't know they don't remember
S0684	be there go to be a movement now to get back into the eu or eventually
S0686	well there be there be yeah but that someone i hear like someone say on the radio the other day in erm in twenty twenty years' time it's go to be country that be full of people who want to be in the eu and they will have leave because of and the people who vote to leave the eu will have die
S0684	die
S0685	mm
S0686	and you know in twenty years' time people be gonna have to live with the consequences of that decision that they didn't want to take
S0685	mm mm
S0684	it seem very selfish doesn't it
S0686	it be and like and and say they vote for their children didn't they as much as anything
S0684	grandchildren
S0686	yeah
S0684	mm
S0686	and it do seem selfish to take a decision base
S0684	well
S0686	on purely on yourself
S0684	well they can see too how much money the eu be put into
S0686	oh yeah absolutely
S0684	the region
S0686	i i i you'd think in wales with all these eu back project you'd be able to see that most of all
S0684	because it be all er er up on all the board
S0686	it be you see it on the sign you know eu fund and everything like this
S0684	be it the newspapers so the media
S0686	probably yeah
S0684	you know like the daily mail or
S0686	yeah yeah
S0684	you don't know what the sun be do the sun and the
S0686	oh the sun be massively
S0684	the mirror
S0686	pro brexit yes the mirror be as well
S0684	well there you be they wield so much power
S0686	you you sell copy by speak out against the government
S0684	david cameron be a eurosceptic you know
S0686	mm he be yeah but i think
S0684	well he be best place actually to argue the case for europe but people just weren't listen you you could you could say anything and they wouldn't listen
S0686	no no well i don't
S0685	well i think part of it
S0685	be because he be but
S0686	yeah i think i think jeremy corbyn have a much larger role to play that wasn't play
S0684	mm
S0686	erm
S0684	if he have speak out we might be in a different
S0686	well who know who know i think stronger lead a stronger leader definitely may have er significantly change things
S0684	he didn't seem faze by the referendum result do he
S0686	he didn't no he didn't seem like he care and in contrast you know a politician who i don't particularly like david cameron be you could see he be near tear when he be announce his resignation as be his wife you know you felt you know okay i you know i don't i don't like him i don't agree with him but he's obviously have have his convictions and he
S0685	mm
S0686	and he believe in them
S0684	but it's because they're isn't it and the people who'll the which be go to choose the next leader be strongly anti europe
S0686	well they don't choose the next leader themselves i don't think
S0684	no they but they put forward the candidates
S0686	they put forward two candidates yeah
S0684	yeah well there you be
S0686	but i think a lot of people be hop to knock boris out before that cos otherwise they think there'll be a surge
S0684	maybe theresa may will be a good uniter
S0686	erm i don't like her er at all i'm not sure whether iain duncan smith isn't be name because it would like a step backwards give that he'd already be leader in the past
S0684	but he's behave with a bite more integrity hasn't he
S0686	he he have yeah he have but my
S0684	but theresa may be be pro europe but she didn't take part in the
S0686	i think it be a
S0684	campaign
S0686	tactical move wasn't it
S0684	maybe
S0686	she saw what be go on
S0684	what don't you like about her
S0686	erm it be her who put forward this bill for the thirty five thousand pound migrant cap
S0684	oh right yeah
S0686	erm yeah that's that's quite
S0684	and she oh which one the european erm human right legislation
S0686	right
S0684	why
S0686	erm it's to do i think that be to do with erm the work that mi6 be do overseas
S0684	sorry
S0686	which be suspect because she's erm home secretary
S0684	mm
S0686	she erm a lot a a within the remit of her role be intelligence service
S0684	mm
S0686	so i think it be something to do with erm that and sort of data privacy as well as erm maybe imprisonment of a terror suspect as well i think so you know this erm how you can hold people without charge them for a longer period and things like that
S0684	which way be be this the
S0685	i think it's the isn't it
S0686	i remember come this way er to see with
S0685	right
S0686	this be the way we come i remember this bridge but also erm one of the things i don't like be how people now after the referendum be say oh erm neither side provide us with enough information about how to vote and i think part of be a responsible sort of active citizen be do your own research and find out like you be say about the miners
S0685	mm
S0686	sort of come together to
S0685	mm
S0686	to to buy this library and to sort of educate themselves i think that's
S0685	oh with the internet though there's not really any excuse
S0686	no yeah be
S0686	absolutely no excuse all the information be out there and i don't i i really don't like this sort of ideology that you have to be spoon feed everything
S0685	oh could have just just read the bbc page that would have be enough to
S0686	well yeah it wasn't it wasn't difficult and i think the problem of that be be that you end up with these people who do believe everything that they read and everything they see they don't fact check and so when
S0685	mm
S0686	they say you know
S0684	mm
S0686	the front page of the daily mail that say you know immigrants be the number one cause of unemployment erm and strain on our public service in the uk they believe it because they don't they don't check the facts they don't do their research because i think
S0684	well the but people like boris johnson be go to referendum result for their own end and to say this be about people be outside er about europe and it isn't it's against the austerity measure and
S0686	oh absolutely
S0684	the comeback and and and the lack of fund
S0686	well
S0684	but they're not go to they're not go to pay any attention to that
S0686	well i think for people like boris johnson it's about their political career really it's not it's
S0684	no
S0686	i don't think it will ever for boris johnson be about the good of the people
S0684	i dunno i mean david cameron to some extent he's get integrity hasn't he
S0686	he do and i think he believe in what he do i i don't like what he do
S0686	but at least you know what you can say of him you see that he have the conviction in his beliefs and the integrity to follow them
S0684	what's the travelodge in like
S0685	basic i might go back there or at least try the
S0684	can you stay in a wetherspoon's
S0685	no not at the town
S0686	wetherspoon's never do room i don't think
S0684	they do
S0686	really do they
S0685	that one isn't a hotel
S0684	i think in shrewsbury they do
S0686	oh right
S0684	you sure it's er not a hotel
S0685	yeah i think i've enquire
S0686	travelodge be always a bite spartan when i've stay there before
S0685	it's okay though i mean it's
S0686	well it's a clean and it's it's a bed to sleep in
S0685	it's i be very i mean i be not there very much
S0686	yeah
S0685	cos i be travel around so but there be a number of mine museums and things like the the the miner library that i'd like to have go into but i arrive at the wrong time last time it'll depend how this steelwork project pan out i think
S0686	what what what's the latest that's happen have it be buy out by this indian
S0685	oh it
S0686	it be under indian ownership wasn't it
S0685	yeah
S0684	and they say it be we should
S0686	without this british
S0685	yeah there be the
S0686	oh i remember now yeah
S0685	cos it's become problematic at the moment erm because it affect so many different sit not just
S0686	yeah
S0685	and be just simply for the project that i'm work on you know they're not see give copyright er you know a priority at the moment for discussions
S0686	no
S0685	so all i can do be just they the have give me access to the high er high density image which now i can work with with on but even if i can't put anything in the public domain until copyright be clear
S0684	and what if it doesn't clear
S0685	well you know you've get a there's no reason why it won't clear you know if the the they're not gonna hang onto the copyright of year old glass plate slide be they
S0684	or if want a lot of money
S0685	no they won't they've give it to the to the library but they haven't bequeath the copyright so the library can put it online so it's public access but for me to work on plat i need the copyright
S0686	i imagine it's just get somebody to sign the
S0685	yeah yeah the woman who be in charge of it be on maternity leave so that's another problem and work with the be another problem cos they're so and er it's
S0684	here where be we now this be
S0685	yeah
S0686	i hope david cameron isn't be not remember for this because that seem unfair
S0684	he will be
S0686	so he will be
S0685	yeah
S0684	he will be
S0685	so like blair will be remember for the war
S0684	but he do a lot of good before that
S0685	yeah but that seem to be eclipse by the very you know or i mean when it go bad it go seriously bad
S0686	he secure the first conservative majority for decades didn't he
S0684	oh do he
S0686	almost twenty years
S0684	it would have be better if he
S0686	yeah
S0684	if the lib dems have go with them again they would have knock them and he wouldn't have have to honour
S0685	well it would also have
S0685	preserve liberal party
S0684	sorry
S0685	it would have preserve the liberal party
S0686	well now the liberal democrats be say if they be elect that they will er go back on the erm brexit result and they won't invoke erm article fifty but erm it's one of those things they can do because they know they'll never be elect all all they can do be strengthen their position within westminster
S0684	but they do a lot when they be in coalition
S0686	they do but they
S0684	but people didn't see it
S0686	they're unelectable for
S0684	yeah it's just
S0686	years now
S0684	it's a shame that no one recognise that they punch above their weight they stop the conservatives do
S0686	they do but they go back on some of the most crucial promise that they make tuition fee
S0684	well you know in coalition you cannot
S0685	but they didn't they
S0686	but that be their one that be why young people vote for them and that's why people felt cheat because their that be their almost their flagship policy wasn't it tuition fee
S0685	yeah as i mean that be another betrayal or of a different order i mean if the conservatives
S0684	this be worse though
S0685	be limp on a minority it would have be perfect cos they wouldn't have be able to do this
S0686	oh this be this be far worse yeah
S0685	yeah
S0686	but
S0685	i mean it would have be slow to pass laws and so forth but otherwise things would have be intact but you can only see that with hindsight can't you
S0686	mm
S0684	the labour party be be between two group isn't it
S0685	mm
S0684	the middle class liberal and the traditional socialist work class
S0686	well i don't i think anyone really know the difference between the liberal democrats and labour any more what be what be the difference what's the ideological difference between the two party
S0686	because labour be you know quite centre leave now aren't they and you know liberal
S0684	lib lib dems be very pro europe they always have be
S0686	oh yeah absolutely but
S0684	and they're more they're particularly concern about
S0686	yeah but the official er labour party line be that they be pro europe
S0684	which be not
S0686	i think well labour be far well more pro europe than the conservatives be as a whole in term of the mps in westminster
S0684	do the majority of tory mps vote for brexit
S0686	no i think about a third or a quarter between those sort of figure vote for brexit and the rest rest vote to remain so it be as in term of total number of mps in the house of commons it be erm it be far below a hundred so less than a sixth of all mps erm so if it be you know if we actually erm adhere to parliamentary democracy like we do for almost literally every other decision that's take
S0684	on
S0686	in the uk then erm we'll be fine
S0684	what do all your friends think
S0686	erm erm some be in the position of most like they're all quite politically engage so erm
S0684	what do think
S0686	well be absolutely disgust as be erm you know they be they be all as angry as i be
S0684	almost
S0686	no all as
S0685	have to have a talk with about this
S0684	i'd say he would have be upset
S0686	yeah i think he's probably be
S0685	yeah
S0684	furious yeah
S0685	incense by corbyn
S0684	yeah he'll be even more incense by him him
S0686	by who
S0684	corbyn
S0686	oh
S0685	well he really despise corbyn
S0686	cos he's a member of the labour there isn't he
S0685	yeah
S0686	do you know who he vote for in the
S0684	andy burnham
S0686	andy burnham i think andy burnham would have actually connect with the work class socialists
S0684	mm
S0686	a lot better than corbyn have
S0684	mm
S0686	because of his background
S0684	why do he come from a council estate
S0686	i don't think so i think he's he come from like a lower middle class sort of family but he grow up in the north you know he saw all the problems in the north as he grow up you know they be all around him
S0684	he's from the same neck of the woods as jeremy corbyn isn't he
S0686	be corbyn from the north
S0684	yeah i think so be he
S0686	he's get a house i think jeremy corbyn well
S0686	why's he get a house in islington then
S0684	because he's an mp
S0686	for islington
S0684	i don't know look it up i think he be
S0685	constituency unless you're in the shadow cabinet
S0686	because he live he live in islington before he be head of the labour party
S0684	ah yeah i don't know have a look i i think he be from near liverpool
S0686	right
S0684	maybe i'm wrong maybe i'm get him muddle up with andy
S0686	where be where's andy burnham again be he
S0684	he's a scouser
S0686	be he scouser
S0684	from be it the wirral or liverpool or also during the leadership campaign you didn't quite know what he stand for
S0686	i think he i think that be an unfair criticism that's level at him because i think during the leadership debate he be the person who actually you know cut cut through you know all that political crap that people spout you know and answer the question so if someone ask him something he answer it you know it be it be refresh to me and erm i i i think he i felt like people have it out for him but like i like him i still do like him i think he's a you know he's a good politician he's sort of a good one
S0684	he'll make a good mayor then
S0686	sorry
S0684	he'll make a good mayor
S0686	i think so i hope so i i do hope that david lammy have lose the mayoral candidacy erm will consider run as labour because last time
S0684	be he stand against sadiq khan
S0686	yeah yeah he say last time er somebody ask whether he would stand apparently erm the leader of the labour party and he say erm no no he be gonna concentrate his efforts on his er campaign to be london mayor
S0684	but not everyone feel up to the job do they
S0686	they don't but
S0684	they might not want to
S0686	they might not want to but i hope
S0684	alan johnson be ask and he say no didn't he
S0686	yeah dan jarvis be ask as well and he say no
S0684	alan johnson's go back to his guitar
S0685	have he
S0684	i expect it's not rock any more it's more folky now
S0685	right
S0684	you know he become a politician because he er his guitar get steal
S0686	really
S0684	yeah and then somebody somebody send him another one i think it be but he's from er a very deprive background talk about live in one room and have next to nothing to eat no wait he's from the north no i dunno i can't remember but anyway so but he's not a bad chap be he
S0685	no
S0684	have he ever stand for leader
S0684	
S0686	alan johnson
S0684	yeah
S0686	erm i'm too young to you know remember the anything but the last leadership erm campaign because gordon brown get hand it
S0684	oh
S0686	by tony blair didn't he so
S0684	well you be still about it
S0686	erm and i don't remember tony blair
S0686	be back in the nineties wasn't he so erm
S0684	tony blair
S0686	i don't remember that
S0684	and his er agreement
S0686	education education education or something
S0684	that it's the reason education be the key to everything
S0686	i
S0684	and
S0686	i
S0685	it be
S0684	it be but he
S0685	it be
S0684	didn't act on it do he
S0686	no i think and a lack of education be why we we have leave europe but i think it's it's not just the education system it's our attitude towards it as a as a country
S0686	yeah like you know teachers aren't respect
S0686	not respect erm professionally people don't want to find out things for themselves you know they learn the bare minimum they have to pass exams
S0684	i think you'll find that's true all over the world
S0686	but i think actually i think you'll find that the more unjust your your country government be that like the more engage people be with elections and election result erm i read a good piece i can't remember who want journalist it be by but he say if you go to african countries which be have their first democratic elections and you talk to anybody on the street you know a fishmonger someone who sell bread erm they're they're engage you know with what's happen what's go on they're excite they know about the candidates they they know what they stand for and you know they have their own opinions on the economy on erm things like the you know the prison system and things like that have and that's just completely absent from from our society i feel you know you go out you you you know this when the bbc do these erm sort of talk to passers by on the high street you despair at what people say
S0685	they're inebriate by the type of low grade entertainment of which things like the x factor you know it's that kind of
S0684	distraction
S0685	it be they be distract they they be stupefy by the media in some respect
S0684	the media tell them what to think
S0685	and it's well and also it remove the state in which to think because they fill it with entertainment
S0686	i think maybe also they're the readiness like the availability of information have it so readily available like all the time can can breed laziness because it's you think oh i can look that up i can look that up and people never do
S0685	no it's er you know the difference between information and knowledge isn't it
S0686	yeah
S0685	i mean knowledge and understand
S0684	and understand
S0685	er cos i remember when i be young and i be you know the only person ever to go into higher education in the entire family that be a kind of moment of family rejoice though and people do respect the fact that you go into you know you'd get er in though in the sense you know of not a very likely candidate
S0686	why because you weren't academic in school
S0685	yeah i mean
S0686	be there people who be well you know people who be oxbridge candidates and things like that
S0685	yeah we have people go to oxford every year from our school
S0686	oh right
S0684	like the big school
S0685	yeah
S0685	and they but it be they be former grammar school students
S0684	mm
S0685	you know in our school
S0684	go to the town centre
S0685	mm
S0684	we're go to the town centre
S0684	oh
S0685	we could probably
S0685	but what you do have be a strong sense of erm the education that you have the prospect you have have be buy for you not give to you by the government but buy for you by your cos they struggle to get er education i mean i the primary school i go to be call the school and the school be not
S0684	oh
S0685	state fund it be fund by the chapels
S0684	be it
S0685	they build the build in fact the you know that's that's one of the major differences to the work class today be that they expect the government to do it
S0684	mm
S0685	back in my grandfather's day they people would say you want that
S0685	do it yourself
S0684	mm
S0685	you know find the money
S0684	and er
S0686	ask not what
S0684	and well
S0686	what your country can do for you
S0685	yeah that's the
S0684	that's what
S0686	yeah no
S0684	that's what the tories be say that that that that they're complain about the work class rely on state welfare
S0685	yeah there's a measure of that that be true i think of of a kind of culture of dependence of you know a culture of i deserve this
S0684	no matter how many children you have
S0685	yeah
S0684	the state's gonna help you provide for them
S0685	yeah yeah er there there wasn't that so you you know families help families you know and that er do you remember when we be talk about that sense of everybody be a relative that be an expression of that sense of commitment to one another beyond the bound of of of blood
S0686	yeah
S0685	and of course things today people will tend to be much more apathised into their little world
S0684	what do what do blood mean i mean look at and i mean what do blood mean when when they're ill and they they die and you don't even hear
S0685	well yeah there's always those contradictions for the you know again but it wasn't always like that like in your family it wasn't always you know a nuclear war against one another be it families deteriorate you know you've get a you've gotta you've gotta work hard
S0684	but even that's how people felt towards one another
S0685	yeah cos they they be up against common problems you know there be bicker of course and there be still fall out people would be but the consensus be that or a sense of solidarity rather which be why conservatism could never work because the sense of the individual before social just didn't run that it have make no sense but nobody be say you know certainly when the mine be open you know that you be expect to follow in your father's footsteps and go down the mine i mean they would say for goodness sake if you can get out and do something else go get it be horrible
S0686	yeah
S0685	it be a really horrible job
S0686	we don't have miners in our family do we
S0685	yes
S0684	oh
S0686	how far back
S0685	erm well it depend my mother work in in the coal mine
S0686	who do
S0685	my mother
S0686	your mother work in the mine
S0685	yeah my mother be a
S0684	not inside the mine
S0685	no on accountancy for the mine
S0686	oh okay
S0685	er her mother clean for er mine for the miners who er for the
S0684	mine owners
S0685	mine owners she be a kind of maid er your both your grandfathers be coal miners er your great uncle and they be miners the only person who wasn't a miner be my father
S0686	go back to what you be say though about erm about people's sense of entitlement to to things like
S0685	mm
S0686	education it's so if people don't have to work for something that they
S0684	mm
S0686	take it for grant then they don't they don't appreciate the value of it necessarily do you think
S0685	no but i think that there's
S0684	that's a problem the
S0685	there be there be an entitlement to education i think
S0686	i think yeah there's an entitlement but people take it for grant
S0685	yeah no but
S0686	yeah okay
S0685	in the old days when people be pay you know where education be pay from tax and so forth the the the argument for entitlement be not from the person who want education it be from the parent of them who say we have pay for this therefore they be entitle
S0686	yeah
S0685	to a free education
S0686	yeah
S0685	but it's not a free education we have pay it
S0686	no absolutely but
S0685	yeah i mean why
S0686	yeah
S0685	it it it be surely one of the sign of a of a develop civilisation that there be free available er that anybody regardless of their background and regardless of whether they be bear in this country or not
S0684	how come germany can afford it
S0685	well it's partly if you have the conviction that that be what should be
S0684	well you know use to say she be they be conservative voters i'm sure she couldn't stand the way do you remember
S0685	mm
S0684	who have a son erm do you remember him
S0686	no
S0684	he use to dress in girls' clothe sometimes
S0686	right
S0684	erm she worry about she have him as the result of a one night stand erm i think deliberately and use to complain that you know she just rely on on welfare and she think it be very unfair and that's why she vote conservative right she didn't like these scroungers so you know single issue like that become the pretext for vote for a for a party
S0686	that's not that's not how it should be
S0684	no but
S0686	but it be no
S0684	that's how people
S0686	because i dunno when i when you think about it from the grind up you know how how do you how do you you know how do you come up with sort of concepts you know like parliamentary democracy you think you know okay we want a democracy where everybody you know get an equal say so you know how you know how do we do that and you think you know but
S0684	but so many things be unequal
S0686	yeah well
S0684	like understand and
S0686	it be but
S0684	access to information
S0686	i'm not sure about access to information
S0684	we can't everybody i mean
S0686	in this country
S0684	like if you grow up in the valleys and you didn't you know you you're your background your family background it make a difference to your attitude
S0686	yeah
S0684	to access information
S0686	no absolutely
S0684	on the internet
S0686	yeah
S0684	if your family didn't read book background and things website for information they would rely on the newspapers
S0686	yeah well if you're if your family wasn't politically engage it's probably highly likely they could grow up not politically engage as well
S0684	yeah
S0686	that's i think that's you know it's a fact of life but they think it's any excuse that you can't sort of develop that later on you know
S0684	apparently it's harder
S0686	it's harder yeah but i don't i still don't think of it as an excuse it explain it but i don't think you know just because somebody's grow up you know around crime for example be not an excuse for them to become a criminal it explain you know it explain it but
S0684	but different factor work against you
S0686	they do yeah but i think
S0684	and you've get so many more obstacles to overcome
S0686	but i think education should be use as a force to sort of reduce the inequality
S0684	yeah it depend on how good that education be
S0686	it do it do yeah but
S0684	it's like
S0686	it's what
S0686	it's not only you know it's it's what's teach as well i've always be a firm believer that
S0686	politics economics should be teach in school as
S0684	yeah
S0686	compulsory
S0684	underprivileged black people in america for example even
S0686	yeah
S0684	they they it's a vicious cycle of
S0686	mm
S0684	crime and drug that be very very hard to break free from
S0686	it be yeah but yeah
S0684	it's the same in this country
S0686	it be but i think i think ultimately you know the the blame have you know it have to lie with the individual but you know there be there be other factor that that contribute to it and make it so much harder for some people at the end of the day everyone be responsible for their own action
S0684	why don't you go into politics
S0685	well you can because there's a lot of people who start in law that go into politics
S0686	i think often
S0684	if you go into local go onto local councils start like that
S0686	yeah no i think often the best politicians though be those that have like real life experience you know
S0684	yeah
S0686	not just be politicians all their live
S0684	yeah
S0686	but you know know about something else so you know it's something that i wouldn't rule out in later life because i do there be things that i really do feel passionately about but i think it's not something that i'd want to do as a career like you know for my whole life because i think i don't know
S0684	i think
S0686	that's not the brand of politics that i believe in
S0684	you can locally
S0686	you can yeah absolutely
S0684	in local politics
S0686	absolutely i think that's where a lot of people see the most difference in their live day to day
S0684	's mum be involve she be a local councillor wasn't she
S0685	oh yeah
S0686	yeah canada's canada's cabinet be make up from people

S0686	yeah but they understand these things you know you michael gove be place as justice secretary with a degree in english and fine there's nothing wrong with a degree in english but i can't imagine he know you know very much about the intricacies about a legal system
S0684	they rely on advisors don't they
S0686	well i they they do but what why put someone in that position who doesn't know about it you know you should be the most
S0686	qualify person yeah that well that's it isn't it
