S0653	mm
S0654	you say drama practice
S0653	drum practice
S0654	i hear you say drama
S0653	hang on hang on what be you say
S0654	i hear you say drama
S0653	i say drum but you need to stop speak with your mouth full cos it's not very nice be it be you go to have a bite of a go at the drum and i haven't do any practice really have we i've be too busy work
S0655	mm
S0653	how much have you do
S0655	how much what
S0653	drum be you in your own world of tiger bread eat at the moment
S0655	erm yeah
S0653	how much drum practice have you do
S0655	not a lot i'm glad it's the holiday when i actually have some time
S0653	you do have time to do the drum every single day
S0655	yeah but i will have more time
S0653	it's just that you keep ask me to help you and i don't have time to do it every single day but there be drum basic drum roll that you could do on your own but you don't do them do you
S0655	do you mean rudiments
S0653	mm i do mean rudiments that's the trouble though when you be a child you don't really often see the point of practice things so you don't really do it and it's only when you get to my age really old that you realise how important it be but you don't have the time to do it because when i play the piano when i be young i never practice really but i wish i have do that now i would be a much better pianist piano player
S0655	you're good
S0653	mm
S0655	you be great
S0653	i be great i'm alright but i would be much better if i'd do my scale and arpeggios every day
S0655	even though i have absolutely no idea what you just say then
S0653	a scale be that go all the way up doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo that's a scale
S0655	yeah that's quite difficult
S0653	no you just you just erm you just get use to use to do them but it's it have be useful to be able to read music than learn the drum
S0655	uhu i'm start to learn
S0653	mm well it help but it's not essential the way 's teach us luckily
S0655	mm
S0653	yeah and then we'll do the circus on monday i think because it's suppose to be horrible weather again
S0655	what circus you haven't actually tell us what the that
S0653	there's a big tent in the on at the moment
S0655	oh
S0653	i really don't know about it erm i wonder what the advert say circus wonderland britain's most magical circus so that's all they say
S0655	well that's probably exaggerate a bite
S0653	mm well yes that be exaggeration but i expect there will be clown
S0655	oh no
S0653	i know but hopefully
S0655	clown be scary
S0653	i know hopefully there will be people on the trapeze and the high wire and maybe there will be a hoop
S0654	people rid people rid horse
S0653	mm
S0655	that's animal cruelty
S0653	mm there be a website so i will go and have a look
S0655	i'd like it as a surprise mum
S0653	i would like it to be a surprise i think we'll enjoy it
S0654	mm
S0655	well
S0653	now there's erm
S0655	they do treat animals very meanly in the circus
S0653	not any more no they can't they be not allow to
S0655	they still use the whip
S0653	no they don't how do you know
S0655	because i read it in a book
S0653	which book
S0655	bart simpson big shoot
S0653	they be not allow to do that sort of thing they be very very strict rule about animals these days i mean i would prefer to go to a circus that doesn't have animals in it and there might not be one might not be any
S0654	yeah there be one
S0653	what
S0654	when a long time ago when we be at the
S0653	you go to one okay
S0654	there be a circus with no animals at all no lion tame no rid horse just
S0653	mm sorry
S0654	no lion tame no horse just er just there wasn't just all
S0653	just what
S0654	just people
S0653	just people
S0654	yeah
S0653	can you remember what they be do
S0654	well one person be climb up a rope and attach themself to it and it be like with a key or something and he actually untie himself with no hand
S0653	mm very impressive
S0655	be lion tame cruelty when they go
S0653	yeah i think it be i mean if if they're well treat i don't think they do that now
S0655	because anyway you could die do lion tame
S0653	yeah you can do if the animals turn and get nasty
S0655	you can die do quite a lot of things in the circus
S0653	mm
S0654	like fire breathe
S0653	well you take special precautions for that kind of thing
S0655	be a tightrope and trapeze you can easily die
S0653	there's always a safety net underneath
S0654	can we see the bear
S0653	can you see the bear can you start talk with your mouth
S0654	can you please move the bear so i can see it
S0653	yeah in a moment i'm eat at the moment what i be go to say be in the summer there be this juggle it's not just juggle but a a kind of a weekend in the in where you can camp and go and do some juggle and i think will be do the trapeze and there be a game of erm a tent of game of board game croquet and i think that would be quite a fun thing to do that weekend what do you guy think yes no
S0655	well do you say that's a week or a weekend
S0653	just a weekend
S0655	mm well
S0653	you get to watch a lot of people do juggle as well
S0655	i do enjoy it our last holiday weekend we have
S0653	what be that one
S0655	the one where we go to the
S0653	where
S0655	the
S0653	oh when we go erm in what be it call that that lovely house
S0655	yeah you also like the smash ice i feel that somebody should have hide the key in there
S0653	mm mm what for the next people to come
S0655	yeah
S0653	that would have be mean
S0655	the key be in the freeze cold water
S0653	now erm we be not so far away from this juggle thing so we could probably just go for one day or stay somewhere else or go camp what do you fancy
S0654	stay for one day
S0655	or maybe two if we decide that we like it a lot
S0653	mm mm that's a good way of think what do you think
S0654	pardon
S0653	have you not be listen
S0654	no
S0653	we be talk about the juggle weekend in the in the summer it's in around half term in may and be say that we could although we can camp there maybe we will plan on go for one day and then if we like it then we can go back the next day
S0654	okay
S0653	mm
S0655	and if we can't juggle that well
S0653	well i can't juggle at all
S0655	i want to repeatedly learn how to i want to learn how to repeatedly juggle three ball
S0654	i can do this with mum
S0653	don't talk over
S0654	i can catch one ball i can do two and then can i have three
S0655	can i have a slice of tiger bread
S0653	mm no you can't have three slice of tiger bread
S0654	can i have two
S0653	that's a giant slice anyway isn't it
S0654	mm
S0655	it's one
S0653	mm i think they do lot of class but they it's erm we would be just be go for one weekend but the the actual thing last for eleven days and then at the second weekend they do they put on a performance but you will be with dad that weekend and in fact i'm not around
S0655	eleven days oh and that's three days less than in than in two entire weeks
S0653	what do you mean mm that's a very odd way of think about it but yes
S0655	in less than two weeks
S0653	mm
S0655	it's more than a week though
S0653	it's nearly it's nearly two weeks isn't it
S0655	yeah so you don't have three if we go there for the whole time you'd only have three days leave of the the holiday
S0654	mm mm
S0653	oh be you enjoy your tiger bread
S0654	look how thick this slice be that be three no maybe four slice thick
S0655	probably two
S0654	no
S0653	i think the thing about jugglers be that they get obsess about it so they want that that would be probably their holiday
S0655	i guess so
S0653	which be understandable
S0655	no erm because sometimes juggle can actually come in handy if you want because if there's something where you need to carry three ball across a big bridge but you're only able to hold hold one er two at a time and people would steal the the ball if you come back for one juggle be the only way to complete it
S0653	uhu mm do you think this be something that would crop up in life
S0655	well not exactly that but it
S0653	it could do
S0655	if you didn't want to if you want to stop someone from get a few things like you couldn't hold onto them you could juggle them and juggle also mean you could hold more than one thing at more than two things at a time
S0653	it do indeed but also juggle be just very good anyway for balance and coordination patients determination all of those things
S0655	and try not to get annoy when the ball fall on the floor
S0653	indeed
