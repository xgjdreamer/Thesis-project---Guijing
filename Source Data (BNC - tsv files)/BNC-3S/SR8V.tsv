S0610	yeah
S0612	do you guy have linkedin
S0610	i do but it hasn't be update for about four years
S0428	i do but i never use it
S0610	why but
S0612	cos i forward my cv on to this person who be like really high up in hr and she's email me back and she be like de la la so your cv's blah erm you just need to you need to do a few things like join up to linkedin
S0610	yeah i think it's really important
S0612	but what if i don't have anybody to like i don't know how it work but don't
S0612	you need people to endorse your skills
S0610	yeah and you will find that load of people that you know be on it and it'll automatically tell you cos it's like link up to facebook or it just fuck know it's scary i'll show you if you like on what mine look like
S0428	yeah i need to update mine as well
S0610	cos as soon as i start look for a job properly a job search er that'll be the first thing i'll update definitely
S0612	what linkedin
S0610	yeah and especially if you're in hr i bet lot of hr people use it
S0612	oh that's so why can't people just like your read cvs nowadays
S0610	i know but
S0428	erm
S0610	it's just a case really of get whatever's on your cv on there and then get a a a profile picture of yourself and then really all it be be it'll just automatically say oh do you know this person link up with them do you know this person and then so everyone you know you can just link up with and then you might think oh who have i work with in the past look them up you know and they might be on there it's easier than you think
S0428	and actually like i have a really bad profile like i don't even have a picture don't have anything on it and erm i've be headhunted a couple of time through it like
S0612	oh wow
S0428	yeah people have say oh er erm have you think about apply for this job
S0610	yeah so that's a really good way of use it
S0428	and i i haven't i haven't put myself honestly i've not put myself out there at all so
S0612	but cos the girls be talk about it at work and they be like endorse mm the fact that i'm good with customers so people click on something
S0610	yeah so there be these skills so it say
S0612	but nobody's gonna like my skills now
S0610	yeah they will cos er i even like people who say your friends at work or your er
S0428	oh you take my tea away
S0610	no
S0428	my green tea
S0610	no
S0610	erm
S0612	you take my tea
S0610	erm if they're on it then they can endorse you you know and do you have what who's your manager at work or who er do you know someone above you at work
S0612	uhu
S0610	would they be on linkedin
S0612	i dunno
S0610	well you might be surprise or if they be and they've just get a dormant profile maybe you could always just like message them and say hey do you mind just log in to linkedin and you know
S0612	mm
S0428	the thing be it's quite cringey but then it's the way things be do now
S0610	yeah what i don't like be that you just type in or whatever on google and it's like the third thing on there and then people just see everything you know
S0428	yeah i don't like it at all and also the endorse skills my dad endorse me how shit do that look like
S0610	yeah
S0612	do it say do it show you who endorse who
S0610	yeah you can click on it
S0610	the worst thing i think be that you can see when someone's see your profile
S0428	yeah
S0610	so like you'll go onto people who you're interest in and they know that you've like you've be look at their profile which i think's a bite weird
S0428	so i never look at anyone
S0610	mm
S0428	i never go on it to be honest
S0610	erm
S0612	it's just annoy me that you have to have twitter facebook
S0428	but i don't think you do
S0612	blah blah blah blah di blah
S0428	i just i also think in a in a way like that you can do that and you also can not like i no like erm when when i start my master's they be like right you'll have a twitter account in a week and i be like i probably won't because i don't want that and er obviously
S0612	yeah
S0428	there be that whole part of the industry where everyone's like there be load of job that be on there and blah blah blah
S0610	yeah it's true
S0428	but also they're not they don't just put them on twitter they put them er other place as well
S0612	do you guy have twitter
S0428	no
S0610	i do although i haven't ever use it really and er oh it's embarrass cos actually that's like the second thing down and there's a shitty picture of like oh anyway but actually a lot of journalists say but maybe it's different for hr cos journalism er you have to have a twitter account but i don't use it
S0428	but then that's what twitter's be be set up for journalism wasn't it i guess
S0610	but don't worry about that but linkedin if you're look for a job first thing you should do i think cos it be like take your cv
S0610	to just online and that can only be a good thing
S0612	yeah
S0610	and once you've set it up and put your cv on there and stuff you don't necessarily have to use it again it's just a good way of maybe of just have yourself out there
S0612	yeah
S0610	it be scary though when you look up your name and then see like everything you've do in the past be on there and i hate it cos i think god if i ever if i ever get famous
S0612	well with your article come out leave right and centre
S0610	no but if you ever become like a reputable journalist or whatever then people will look you up won't they that's the first thing they might do if they like
S0428	yeah
S0610	try to commission you whatever and then you've get like your blog from when you be fuck fifteen on there or like
S0612	i think facebook's difficult for us well
S0610	yeah
S0612	er it depend what you've do but
S0610	we've be on it for
S0612	photos
S0610	yeah
S0612	back when you're like drink
S0610	eighteen
S0428	and you don't wanna delete them
S0610	no
S0428	but also you don't want anyone to see them
S0610	no if you've put on a load of private i er i haven't get i don't even know my privacy control
S0428	oh i have to because when i be teach

S0610	but like the yeah and like the the worry all the i just i think i'd be such a worry mum i'd be constantly worry about them
S0428	but maybe like maybe you wouldn't like you know erm like she be just so unmotherly and like
S0610	mm
S0428	and she have and now she's just like the best mum in the world she's so good with him
S0610	yeah
S0428	and er i guess you just learn like you have to
S0610	i guess you surprise yourself
S0428	i think
S0610	you either be good or not yeah
S0428	and maybe like you wouldn't worry so much yourself cos you're more like concern about like make sure they've get a good life and i dunno it's a it's a really weird one i can't imagine a day that like we meet up and we've both get a child
S0610	yeah i that it probably won't ever happen and that's a fear it's a fear i'm as scar of that as erm it actually happen you know like er i just
S0428	yeah
S0610	the other day we start talk about what i'm dread be cos i'm so bore of wed chat i'm just dread the moment when
S0428	you chat
S0610	i'm certainly i'm certainly a big step behind a majority not all thank god but a majority of friends mainly like
S0428	but do you think you'll ever be like them
S0610	i mean not as a wed stuff but
S0428	i would absolutely love it if we get marry
S0610	and i think
S0428	and we just turn into like absolute
S0610	that's all we talk about
S0428	after all after all the chat
S0610	all that chat
S0428	that we be like it wouldn't surprise me of us either it's a kind of
S0610	it wouldn't surprise me cos we're knobs
S0428	yeah it's the kind of thing we do
S0610	but erm erm but because there's such such a big step behind anybody else that's already bore me to tear so when it start baby chat as well it's just gonna be like i can't relate to anything you ever say to me
S0428	but then like for example with she's get two baby and i don't find her chat ever bore like she doesn't do that she's just get these two things
S0610	no but but what's worse be er that's fine but it's when everyone's er you know like
S0428	together
S0610	when er people be together and they've all experience something and then this be like like everyone talk about oh yeah well for my wed for my wed for my wed
S0428	oh god but
S0610	honestly and i've have be in situations like that not that often often
S0428	no
S0610	with like the uni girls
S0428	that's the hard thing and you and you you don't wanna like take yourself away from them and like be like that person that's all aloof but then
S0610	but er sometimes it's just bore as fuck
S0428	yeah
S0610	cos you can't simply you just can't relate you know but then i'm like be i just be like really cynical but it's not that i just cannot relate to what they're say
S0428	no i couldn't really couldn't
S0610	but anyway maybe it'll be different with baby i mean i think i'm get more into baby
S0428	no i mean i love children and i can't even imagine it
S0610	i think the twenties be suppose to be difficult decade the thirties be gonna be fuck difficult
S0428	at least we'll know who we be by then

S0610	mm
S0428	put the brake on and we skid across the runway like the plane nearly leave the runway and it be like you know normally you're like you land and you're like phew
S0610	yeah yeah yeah
S0428	and then there be like it be just the worse it be so awful
S0610	oh god
S0428	and then erm
S0610	you need to nip this in the bud
S0428	i know no i know and i i
S0610	i don't know how though but
S0428	i've erm be on load of flight so i can't you know it's really horrible like when you feel you're get a fear
S0610	i know
S0428	but you can't stop it so erm i also like i i be in a tower in verona and i start to feel a bite like weird about heights and i've never felt weird about heights
S0610	mm
S0428	and i be like don't i don't want this to be a thing
S0610	no
S0428	i don't want this fear but you can feel it's really strange
S0610	it's funny how you develop them as well well with fly
S0428	yeah what be you trick
S0610	i don't have any i'm shit at it what be the i mean i guess the more you fly the better it'll be but
S0428	i'm not sure i've do like ten flight in the last month so but i dunno
S0610	you need a couple of smooth flight and it might make you feel better again
S0428	get to say we we to italy er and i fly british airways and we land and i didn't even feel the plane touch the runway so you know
S0610	wow
S0428	you know like ryanair it be like
S0610	yeah
S0428	it be like that be a really big difference
S0610	wow really
S0428	yeah i cos i be freak out and be like we've land
S0610	wow that say something doesn't it
S0428	and i be like oh
S0610	well we shouldn't sit together on this next ryanair flight should we
S0428	but i always think that when you're with someone who's scar like i be quite good do you remember when we go when we last fly and like and you be like
S0610	i be
S0428	and i be just chat to you and i wasn't scar because like i know you be more scar
S0610	but be it cos you just weren't scar
S0428	no i be i've be scar for about a year and a half two years
S0610	wow
S0428	or longer but and it's just get
S0610	i dunno if we just wind each other up be you a scar flyer you're a
S0612	erm mm no
S0610	you're okay
S0612	well that's only cos i've have as i as i say you need to speak to
S0610	yeah he's so chill
S0428	be he in the raf
S0612	er navy but he fly
S0428	mm
S0612	helicopters so
S0428	do he
S0612	yeah erm so when we be come back from the maldives we have quite bad turbulence and that be at the stage when they think that turbulence have bring the malaysian airplane down and like
S0610	and who who bring the malaysian airplane
S0612	before they find out that it be erm actually er a technical error that the staff just switch off
S0610	oh be that really what the thing be now
S0612	yeah
S0610	in the flight
S0612	yeah they they've they've they've they've give erm an investigation so there be something wrong with it but the staff keep reset the system so
S0610	oh my god
S0428	what the the one that land
S0612	the one that go miss
S0428	how do they know that
S0610	how do they know that
S0612	from the er but i dunno but they publish it so
S0428	i didn't know that
S0610	maybe it's just a theory
S0612	but so we be fly back but cos they only release that i think just before christmas or over christmas how it go down or why it go down and i ask i be like be there any any circumstances a turbulence can bring a plane down and he be like no pretty much there isn't no plan be design to cope with it so yeah you might get it really bad but turbulence can't take a plane out of the sky
S0610	it always feel so weird
S0428	yeah
S0610	it's like so against our think isn't it
S0428	and always say to me like she be like if a plane crash it doesn't just like a plane doesn't just fall out of the sky it would do this
S0612	yeah
S0428	and that make me feel a bite better cos i just imagine it go like

S0612	it's funny how much you do rely on it though like you feel uncomfortable after a while you're like well what happen if something's happen to my dad and it's like well you know that use to like you say it use to happen where if anything be major you'd hear
S0610	you would hear somehow yeah like they would just find out but people would just find out the hotel you're at like like

S0610	er people be more resourceful than you think
S0428	yeah and so what erm what so you be there for seven days
S0612	yeah
S0428	be you just there on that island
S0612	yeah yeah literally there's no you couldn't really go for more than like two weeks i don't think and even then two weeks be a bite of a long
S0610	even then i think you'd get a bite bore
S0612	yeah
S0428	yeah could you walk round the island be there like things to do
S0612	yeah we have bike they give us bike
S0428	oh
S0612	so you cycle round the island
S0610	be erm her honeymoon they're still plan it but she be like i think i'll be too bore spend even a week on the maldives even though she really er she's like er it it'd be nice on honeymoon they're gonna go to south er south africa
S0612	wow
S0610	and then erm and then go via the maldives or something spend like four days in the maldives
S0428	where be the maldives
S0610	it's by africa isn't it
S0612	indian ocean
S0610	have that help at all
S0612	yeah
S0610	have it
S0612	it's amaze thank you ever so much
S0610	have it actually though
S0612	yeah
S0610	mm mm
S0612	i feel like when i do this i look very inquisitive like
S0612	mm
S0610	i think it's like there's africa er like correct me if i'm wrong there's africa and it's here
S0428	really
S0610	be it
S0428	like near madagascar
S0612	it's like there they be
S0610	ah
S0428	oh well do
S0612	that's india maldives
S0428	oh okay so not
S0612	and i be really to be honest i be scar about fly over like we have to fly over iraq and everywhere and i be like that's when i freak out because they do bring a plane down
S0610	it must be near the seychelles then cos the seychelles be around here i think
S0612	yeah
S0610	cos that's where my uncle's from
S0428	so how many erm
S0610	it's not actually near south africa at all
S0428	no or or madagascar
S0612	no
S0428	it's like miles away
S0612	i reckon from south africa to the maldives be like nearly the same
S0610	yeah that's that's
S0610	i might open these curtain
S0428	so be er the maldives be it just millions of islands or be there
S0612	millions
S0612	yeah they they do count them and ours be like really south like we as soon as we arrive in mali we have to get another plane but like a smaller one and that be like an hour's flight just to get to our island but the island
S0610	oh my god an hour's flight
S0612	there's so many islands and honestly just look out the look out the aeroplane it be so beautiful it's everything that you think the maldives be and i do recommend it because it's pure we i don't think we'll be able to go again unless we win a competition erm
S0612	cos it's just you can't justify spend that much money
S0610	yeah i know
S0612	and the i mean er the the like the people there be so lovely as well but you you don't know whether that's just because the hotel have tell them to be nice to the guests
S0610	yeah
S0612	cos everybody from like the they have people that brush stone off the beach to make it like look this and brush the pathways after the storm so it look
S0610	see that's weird man and erm like
S0612	and you kind of yeah but they be all ever so friendly
S0610	i wonder what their live be like i bet they live in quite poverty poor condition
S0428	be there like yeah like poorer islands that aren't touristy or
S0610	there must be place where people live
S0612	there must be yeah i think mali be like i think it's the most er densely populate city
S0428	really
S0612	in all the second or third something city cos it's like compact i think that's get quite erm
S0610	you can't imagine great condition there can you
S0428	cos sometimes you see picture i think it's more of the seychelles or it might be the maldives of like just like islands full of rubbish
S0610	yeah i guess it collect all up yeah gross
S0612	they're very probably very clever about hide it cos you couldn't even see that from the air
S0610	yeah
S0612	my biggest ambition be to find or on my bucket list be to see a whale from the sky cos i reckon you would be able to
S0610	wow
S0612	so i spend the whole hour's flight like
S0428	why from the sky
S0612	just because i'd love to see a whale and i'd be too scar to be on the sea to see a whale
S0428	i've see a whale
S0610	how
S0612	wow
S0428	well my
S0428	when i go when i go
S0612	go on
S0428	to australia with my aunt
S0612	oh you
S0428	i be work on a boat that be track the whale up in the indian ocean
S0612	oh my
S0428	and we go out we saw like three hundred whale like they be like
S0610	like big ones or how big
S0428	massive ones yeah
S0610	wow
S0428	they don't look that big in the sea like when you're on a boat so what they what they be do be they be like count them to see if the if they put an like if an oil refinery be like change like the natural course of the whale
S0612	yeah wow
S0428	erm
S0612	cos they say fish harbour do now don't they
S0610	what
S0428	yeah it's
S0612	that like fish harbour change cos er that be on that david attenborough hunt documentary which be amaze
S0610	oh i didn't see that i wanna see that
S0612	oh it be amaze you no that i'm sure be on bbc iplayer but they have
S0610	yeah yeah
S0612	a whole mm erm blue whale cos that's the largest one isn't it
S0610	be it
S0612	and they're just
S0428	i think ours be humpbacks that we be track
S0612	they're just incredible creatures
S0610	yeah
S0612	i'm
S0428	in awe of them
S0612	weirdly obsess with them
S0610	wow
S0612	just to see one from at least er
S0610	yeah
S0612	if like if you're that er obviously you can't when you're like up there but if you're like there and you just see the silhouette of
S0610	of this huge mammal
S0612	yeah
S0610	just in this ocean
S0428	but they they don't cos the sea be so big they don't look that big it's really weird
S0612	yeah
S0428	and like even when you're just in australia and you stand er cos like my aunt's obviously like work with them a lot she we'll just
S0610	wow
S0428	you we'll just be stand on the coast she'll be like there's a whale
S0612	tail
S0428	their tail flip and like
S0612	wow
S0428	puff water out
S0612	wow
S0612	and then its thing just go like its chin almost just it's huge
S0610	be they they don't eat meat
S0428	they don't like salt no it's a joke
S0610	yeah
S0612	i believe you then i be like wow
S0610	yeah how do they filter it out
S0428	but how do they get so big without eat meat or maybe they do eat meat
S0610	do they eat meat
S0428	i dunno because
S0612	they can't er they basically if they open their mouth then it's pot luck what's in there isn't it
S0610	yeah
S0612	no you er you could they could eat human
S0610	ah
S0612	and i don't think they'd mean to
S0610	ah
S0612	cos that would scare me like the amount that they open their whale er mouth
S0428	jonah and the whale ain't it
S0612	yeah you'd just go right in there and then er i don't want to think
S0428	oh god you can't even imagine
S0612	mind you can swim in a a whale's vein or something it's that big
S0610	how big be they like in in comparison to this room
S0428	they're just ginormous
S0612	they're it's crazy
S0610	like could it fill this room
S0428	no bigger way bigger than this room
S0612	it's like
S0610	imagine that
S0612	almost like one of the like a gherkin but not that big
S0428	no that's big
S0428	they're just erm
S0610	compare to that ship container what about a ship container
S0428	they're probably about the size of a ship container
S0612	yeah the blue whale would be like
S0428	or bigger
S0612	the size of five of them
S0610	no
S0612	they're huge wait a minute
S0610	let me have a look let me have a look
S0428	and er it's honestly it's just incredible when you just look across the ocean cos erm we saw this one boat and there be a whale swim in the background then there be a group of dolphins like jump and then a shark swim at the dolphins and they all stop and they all like get together and they like protect each other this and then er we saw the shark swim off and then the dolphins start play again then this whale's just drift on in the background
S0612	wow what
S0612	so shark eat dolphins
S0428	they will attack them yeah
S0612	bastards no one like shark
S0428	but the dolphins like all like
S0612	good
S0428	like they protect like like
S0612	get into a little club
S0428	yeah
S0612	good
S0610	ah
S0428	the dolphin club
S0612	and whale i mean there's no point in try to take that one out
S0428	no
S0612	mind you i don't see how a whale could defend itself
S0610	so twenty five metres
S0428	so about
S0612	be that a large blue the the great blue whale
S0610	the blue whale
S0428	so this room be probably like six metres
S0610	oh my fuck christ
S0612	yeah
S0610	you're right a ship container be probably only like
S0428	ten we'll look it up maybe
S0612	so can you get a scale
S0428	yeah and they have like
S0610	okay yeah
S0428	a human's toenail next to a
S0428	like a a human's mouth next to a whale's mouth
S0612	but yeah i've for some reason whale have always fascinate me so
S0428	but i just think and they're
S0610	you should go on like a whale watch somewhere
S0612	i would but then i get scar that
S0610	oh my god
S0612	like you they they have that one in canada which capsize didn't it and then people
S0610	yeah
S0612	drown
S0610	look at that so hang on how do i get all the other shit off the screen so blue whale comparison to say an elephant
S0428	er we're not like we wouldn't even like we're not even as tall as their fin
S0610	oh my god i didn't realise they be that big
S0428	yeah
S0612	that's why it's they're so cool
S0428	but you honestly the the sea
S0612	they're like the last
S0428	the sea be so big you don't even realise they're big like they look small
S0612	you need to if you're yeah watch if you watch any episode of the hunt watch the sea one because they show do the whale
S0610	oh my god
S0612	and they they also have the section about like these jellyfish that look like they're rave underwater
S0610	oh yeah
S0428	yeah
S0612	it's
S0610	be it cos they light up or something
S0612	there's so there's so many different like you like when you see something like that i can't help think there be some sort of god
S0610	yeah i know
S0612	because it just doesn't like
S0428	who would put rave jellyfish in the sea
S0612	yeah they be incredible and like they're all these crazy shape that you would just think in your dream
S0428	er i remember we go onto this one beach and like you can't swim cos they're completely poisonous but all these jellyfish have wash up on the beach
S0610	oh
S0428	er and we be just walk in shoe and it's like they're it's like bubble wrap and they've get like like a bubble and you just and it's like it's horrible it's like pop pop pop pop and it's like they're completely like deadly if you cos there's so many of them and the whole beach be just like bubble wrap they've get a name
S0612	oh
S0428	i can't remember what they're call
S0610	cor this be so sad so yeah like you say er they their diet be almost exclusively of small crustaceans
S0612	oh
S0610	erm but
S0612	which we find out about last night
S0610	yeah
S0428	we need we need to come and tell us about that
S0612	yeah
S0610	blue whale be abundant in nearly all the oceans on earth until the begin of the twentieth century
S0612	and then humans
S0610	for over a century they be hunt almost to extinction by whalers until protect by the international community in nineteen sixty six a two thousand and two report estimate there be five thousand to two so between five thousand and twelve thousand blue whale worldwide in at least five group that's not a lot be it
S0428	no
S0610	twelve thousand
S0612	we we ruin so much
S0610	that's why it's so important people i just don't understand how people can't respect nature and like how
S0428	and we and it's it's get worse that's what upset me it's like we've we know this we know we're like we know we should protect them protect everything
S0610	i just don't understand
S0612	no
S0610	so before whale there be about two hundred and thirty nine thousand sorry this be really depress let's just look at how nice they be
S0612	mm well no it's
S0610	hang on what number's that
S0612	there be two group
S0610	hang on twenty fourteen the californian blue whale have rebound to nearly its pre hunt population
S0612	oh
S0610	this be completely
S0612	that's good
S0610	oh so hang on sorry
S0612	this journalist obviously doesn't write as er
S0610	there remain only
S0612	properly as you do
S0612	and all
S0428	won't be famous
S0610	yeah i don't really understand what they're talk about there hunt yeah well it's just erm fuck mad
S0428	well i saw three hundred so there be at least three hundred whale in the world
S0612	that's that's so cool
S0428	it's quite mental
S0612	but humpback whale so what do they look like
S0610	they're just really big
S0428	and we saw a hammerhead shark as well that just swim past the boat and it freak me out
S0612	that would freak me out when erm we go in the maldives and i be not big fan of the sea because in the sea i'm terrify of jellyfish shark i know i mean
S0428	be there maldives in the be there shark in
S0612	be there
S0428	be there shark in the maldives
S0612	yeah and but the the funny thing be when we get there like i love the fact also their health and safety be not as anal as we be here
S0428	yeah
S0612	cos we have we didn't get any sort of brief about what's in the sea they just say if you're go snorkelling don't go out when the current's do you can't go to the side of the island because you'll get wash away in a current so they they be just like just go to the end of the reef and then you'll be fine
S0610	that's quite scary
S0612	yeah erm and but they didn't give you er kind of there's this in the sea there's this in the sea and so on in the sea i'm petrify of jellyfish and on land i'm petrify of cockroaches i hate the fuckers so
S0428	oh they're disgust
S0612	yeah and erm and i meet this other couple there and er the man in this couple they'd just get marry too and he be an avid snorkeler and he'd be out every day twice a day for a couple of hours and he be just tell us everything that he'd see and ever since i go to cape verde and we saw a turtle on the beach i've just be obsess with try to see one in the it's like swim around like happy unaffected by humans because we be on a beach and it be try to lay egg and all these stupid tourists and we all
S0610	oh
S0612	yeah erm even though we be good we be respect the tortoise but then and they just say you can watch them and don't make any like you have to be really quiet
S0428	you should go to where 's just be
S0612	and they be like you just can't take any flash photography and then this dickhead take a flash and then the turtle freak out and run back in where's just be
S0428	i dunno somewhere in
S0612	oh yeah cos you you show us a video of
S0428	yeah
S0610	wow so amaze facts about blue whale their tongue alone can weigh as much as an elephant
S0428	woah
S0610	their hearts as much as a car amazingly though this giant of the ocean feed on some of the smallest marine life
S0428	ah
S0610	tiny shrimp like animals call krill
S0612	i mean isn't that just also incredible that it's not it's this huge thing and it doesn't need to eat huge things it just survive on the most tiny thing
S0610	i know
S0612	in the ocean
S0428	yeah and it doesn't it's not aggressive like it's it's big but it's not like i'm the
S0610	shark
S0428	king of the ocean and i'm gonna kill everything
S0612	be that in your way
S0428	no no not at all there's someone in the toilet
S0610	mm
S0612	do you wanna share the sixty six million pound jackpot
S0428	i can just share that out between sixty six like everyone
S0610	they be think to form close attachments then there's wow it's so crazy though we can't hear them blue whale
S0428	well don't don't worry it's fine
S0612	no cos you can't be comfortable
S0610	though we can't hear them blue whale be one of the loudest animals on the planet communicate
S0428	they're have a party down there
S0610	communicate with each other use a series of low frequency pulse groan and moan
S0610	it be think that in er good condition blue whale can hear over distance of up to one thousand six hundred kilometres
S0612	cor
S0428	no way that's mental
S0612	that's mental
S0610	it be think that whale feel emotions
S0428	i don't know the door's still shut it's always open isn't it
S0610	yeah someone's probably in it
S0428	i know
S0610	oh give it a give it a go then they could've be blue whale have few predators but be know to fall victim
S0610	to attack my shark and killer whale but many and many be injure or die each year from impact with large ship
S0612	oh that's er er actually say that his cos they're er he's on he's in navy ship and the they crash into a whale and you just felt it like reverberate around the
S0610	wow
S0612	the whole ship why can't they avoid them
S0610	i guess it's quite hard if i dunno
S0428	but they'd come on their track system wouldn't they
S0610	but maybe they wouldn't be able to i don't know
S0612	they probably don't give a shit
S0610	god i'd give a shit imagine that it's like that whale be more valuable than one human life
S0612	mm

S0610	oh
S0612	erm and like it's funny cos 's normally like really er he if he want to do it he'll do it and he doesn't really care but he be really like panic and he be like i don't wanna do this i don't wanna do this but we do it so we go out
S0610	be he scar about
S0612	cos he's just scar of like not be able to control the situation in the sea
S0610	mm
S0612	like you're in their habitat
S0610	mm
S0612	and we saw lot of sea cucumbers which er constantly make me giggle cos they're
S0610	what
S0612	sea cucumbers they're hilarious
S0610	what
S0612	really little cucumbers under the sea
S0428	oh really
S0610	oh my god
S0612	and they're just like worm aren't they but but they just
S0610	i've never see that
S0428	i've never see one
S0612	they're so funny oh i be giggle the whole way erm
S0428	it's really hard when you giggle in a snorkel
S0612	yeah mm erm
S0428	a problem i often have
S0612	and then we get to the edge of the reef and we be just like oh try to gear ourselves up to go over and then er we just saw this like this large thing like swim around and you look at it and it be a shark
S0610	what
S0428	oh
S0612	but it be it be a reef shark so they're about that long
S0610	and they're not
S0612	and they look like and they're they're call blacktip blacktip reef shark and we look at it and it didn't do anything cos it obviously saw us and we be like fuck and i be like mm no i'm not swim towards them because
S0610	no
S0612	you just don't know like we didn't know if it be a vegetarian shark or
S0612	anything like that so we
S0612	but as soon as we like
S0428	or a vegan
S0612	try we try like try swim like swim away which kind of push me closer to the shark and i be like no erm but we have flippers on so you can swim quite fast and then so we be try to get away like you just saw like four or five of them come out and they just start circle this entrance to the reef
S0612	and we be like oh my god so we couldn't have be er like where that sofa be that's how close we be to these shark
S0610	oh my god
S0428	oh fuck
S0612	yeah i know and we be like oh and then we start to swim erm back and then and i be like oh i don't wanna go in cos i haven't see a turtle and this guy at the bar have be like there's load of them and i be like i need to see one and like up until like we literally there's we hadn't be that far off the seabed and i i think that be it like that be snorkelling
S0428	mm
S0612	then we go down a bite and then go through this other gap and then suddenly the bed just give way to this kind of well there be nothing like you couldn't see the sea it be amaze but really scary
S0610	what with life you mean or
S0612	huh
S0610	like with sea life
S0612	well that yeah oh the fish be beautiful like again they're just all the colour under the sun they're gorgeous but it be just the way that by the seabed and then suddenly
S0610	and then suddenly it drop off
S0612	and like it's er the length of the house be where the seabed be and you're just like fly it be incredible and then
S0428	would you've do dive
S0612	no no i couldn't do that i i couldn't do it because i'm scar that i'd kill myself as in i er accidentally burp or something and then something would happen
S0428	what if you burp
S0610	no
S0612	i dunno but cos you're in control of that aren't you and also there's all those things that if you swim up too fast you can
S0612	blow your brain out or something i dunno no that's too hectic for me but
S0428	you can get you can see so much just snorkelling that's crazy though just see the sea drop away
S0612	yeah er i've never see
S0428	wow
S0612	i've never be very like be out that far ever in anywhere and it be just so beautiful because it be just so
S0610	wow
S0612	it be like disney bedknobs and broomsticks and then and then be like there's a turtle and i be like what a turtle and i didn't and he be point and i couldn't see what he be point at and he be desperate to leave by this point so he be like look at the fuck turtle
S0612	and then there be one just
S0610	ah
S0612	like
S0428	oh and you saw him
S0612	i yeah i saw him and he kind of come a bite close to us and then go away but it be just so nice to see him in his habitat just like like
S0610	ah
S0612	and he be like that big like he be good decent size one and then we saw another one
S0428	oh i'm so please you saw one
S0612	oh i i know otherwise i would've have to keep go back out i mean it be literally the most amaze thing i've ever see a one off and then we go back and er as soon as we get out of our back onto our thing you just saw this reef shark swim up to and they don't come that close because it's quite shallow and it be just funny the way that he just swim up to our
S0610	thing yeah
S0612	thing go under it and then away and it be almost like stay out of our habitat
S0610	yeah
S0612	or
S0610	oh keep out yeah
S0612	we let you live this time
S0612	but not next time
S0612	so after that be google reef blacktip reef shark and they're not like scary ones but it's i mean it's just like the thing that they have be know to bite somebody
S0610	okay but i guess
S0612	so
S0610	that's when they feel
S0612	yeah
S0610	yeah yeah
S0612	threaten so
S0428	god shark swim around
S0610	so do you then avoid the sea cos i guess be that the only time you go in the sea or
S0612	yeah the rest of the time we be
S0428	in the pool
S0612	in the pool and they have a pool and a beach bar which be really nice with the bed in the water so we
S0428	i just the love the sea like
S0610	yeah i know
S0428	that's why i like to be in like the med cos i feel safe in the med like you get like
S0610	that's the thing i'm a like i'm a right pussy so if i be to go to the indian ocean i'd feel really scar to be in the sea when there be probably a stupid thing to be scar of i don't know
S0612	i wouldn't say it's i i think it's just you have to be sensible and the thing be there be nothing like there be no net around the island to protect like if for example a great white
S0428	in singapore there be net
S0612	have go off course
S0428	mm
S0612	and be in er like we wouldn't've know we could've be out there we would've
S0428	mm like in in singapore they have net on the beach to stop the shark come in
S0612	oh
S0428	but there be a shark in valencia who get lose
S0610	oh really
S0428	and erm
S0612	yeah that's the thing er there's always that one time when
S0428	but they can trap them in the med cos they come in through the gap between gibraltar
S0610	of course
S0428	and they can see them come in
S0612	can they
S0428	yeah
S0612	so what do they do they don't kill them
S0428	no i think they just say there's an they put alert out
S0612	mm
S0428	and it
S0612	er do they guide the shark erm
S0428	yeah
S0610	yeah
S0428	the get some they get some sheep dog
S0610	yeah once it's in the med it'd be pretty hard for the shark to get out again
S0428	yeah it doesn't like it there i don't think
S0610	no it's too warm isn't it
S0428	claustrophobic
S0610	mm
S0428	it's so scary though
S0610	the sea do scare me i'm such a fuck

S0610	what he punch him in the face
S0428	mm
S0612	he do something or yeah he do something
S0610	get him in the eye
S0612	easier say than do i mean
S0610	mm
S0612	it's a split second isn't it when you're like you're either gonna just go like that cos you're scar or
S0610	that's what i would do
S0428	you never know
S0610	i'd be like
S0428	no no
S0610	okay just take me quick
S0428	yeah
S0612	oh it'd be horrible
S0428	especially if it like take a bite and they don't like the taste of humans and then just spit you out and you're leave there like
S0612	don't they like the taste of humans
S0428	no
S0612	cheeky fuckers

S0612	polar bear eat them too er
S0610	yeah i be just yeah
S0612	they eat they literally eat the on you watch this hunt it's erm beautiful and i love david attenborough but they like come up to the seashore to try and get seal and they kind of launch into this pre plan attack of like get the pup as they're like
S0610	they're very intelligent aren't they
S0612	but then they can beach themselves and then it's like well that's your own fault but then
S0428	they
S0612	it's not really
S0428	recently they've stop like cos they use to keep killer whale in captivity didn't they and i watch a documentary do you see that
S0612	no but be that where seaworld in america
S0428	yeah it be just i
S0610	oh no
S0428	i be cry
S0610	i have not
S0428	i be cry
S0610	i can't take that
S0428	but i think now they've stop
S0612	it's like free willy
S0428	they've stop a lot of the killer whale in captivity after that documentary
S0610	after the documentary i'm so glad jesus
S0428	oh
S0612	i don't see it's it's sad isn't it that erm that's for entertainment
S0428	mm
S0612	but fortunately my parent never and i'm glad they didn't because you kind of go from what your parent like if they're gonna take you to sea life centre or something you're gonna go
S0610	yeah
S0612	but i'm so glad that they never take us to anything like circuses or
S0428	no
S0612	any er thing like in america where they do those show
S0610	it's awful yeah
S0428	i felt really bad in the oceanogràfic in valencia i didn't like it when i saw er see those dolphins and
S0610	yeah when you see like i remember like see quite like a not a huge whale but a whale
S0428	yeah in a smallest space it be so sad but then it's nice to see them i dunno it's
S0610	but it's it's nice to for us to see them but
S0428	not for them to be there
S0610	yeah it's get nothing to do with us why they exist humans be be fuck knobs
S0428	imagine if they
S0612	mm
S0428	collect us and put us in cage
S0610	i know
S0428	we'd be mental
S0610	the problem be with human be and i
S0612	we'd turn on each other
S0610	i do i must say the bible do er not the bible religion also like make you think that as well that men own the earth but really the earth be not it doesn't own us but the er the earth be we're live on the earth basically what be i gonna try and say we're not the king of the earth and we don't own it we just happen to be live on this earth and its it's allow us to inhabit it like it's
S0428	and we're like quite high up the chain
S0610	it's give us the condition to be able to live on earth but we don't own it we don't own mother earth do we it's not and er we don't own it more than a whale do or a seal or whatever
S0612	mm no
S0610	like we're all equal animals on this earth
S0612	the funny thing be that humans only do because of cowardice because gun gun control populations really but it's a cowardly weapon humans actually wouldn't be able to survive a lot of them wouldn't be able to survive in the wilderness
S0428	no of course not no
S0612	we wouldn't we're actually not that great at survival now because we've get lazy so actually if they take all the weapons away we'd be screw
S0610	yeah i know but we think we have this like
S0612	and they can bomb
S0610	mortal right
S0612	bomb each other from thousands of miles away what's the kind of that's cowardly
S0428	yeah
S0610	but we think we have this mortal right that we own this earth and we do not own it and that's what's sad because we then we think we think we have the right over all animals and think we can kill them and there's no comeuppance and we think we can do whatever we like it's disgust
S0612	i think the world be i think more and more people be like go more towards animal right they be
S0610	mm
S0612	like things like facebook i think help when you see these different erm it's like that shoot of the lion and er
S0610	mm
S0612	and like er that happen everywhere like
S0610	i know
S0612	hunt happen in this country but the more like i think more and more people be kind of against animal cruelty
S0610	yeah i think so
S0428	then you think there be so many like countries that be so massive that you know don't respect it and
S0612	mm
S0428	i mean like whale happen in norway and they're like so civilise
S0612	yeah
S0610	yeah
S0612	and they have that yeah
S0428	like they're so that's like the the country on this planet that's so broad think
S0610	i read this interview with the head of new head of greenpeace oh no well the head of greenpeace be step down and he's be replace oh yeah yeah so it's the new head of greenpeace and he's like greenpeace environmental erm our campaign the worst mistake ever to have be make be that it's about save the planet it's not about save the planet when we get extinct when we become extinct the planet's gonna live on it's just gonna resuscitate and revive and
S0428	yeah
S0610	it'll live on cos it's a powerful thing but it's about not about save the planet it's about help people live in harmony with the earth for for as long as possible without basically make it an inhabitable place and that be interest because lot of people when you see environment oh shut up like we don't give a shit about the animals or whatever but it's not about that it's about make it habitable for us for as long as possible
S0428	yeah
S0610	and i don't think people realise that you have to work with the environment rather than think you can rape it for all its worth dunno
S0612	that's why i like it when grass grow through tarmac
S0610	yeah
S0612	that's a very good example of nature be more powerful than man
S0610	that's true
S0612	and also it just need to make a tornado and it's wipe out nearly a population or a volcano or some tsunami they it's
S0428	weather bomb
S0612	weather bomb
S0610	i think it'll be a virus that wipe as out
S0612	there's too many human be
S0610	there be really kind of scary anyway doomsday
