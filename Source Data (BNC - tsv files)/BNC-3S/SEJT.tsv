S0262	in fancy dress though
S0261	barber jacket and
S0301	well i don't know because i don't you know i don't know 's friends that well
S0262	mm
S0301	but there probably will be but
S0262	mm
S0301	i don't know it's difficult to say because a lot of 's friends be a bite like me they'll say fancy bloody dress oh come on
S0262	mm
S0301	you know all the girl
S0261	the the fellas
S0301	all the girls up to they can come as tarts if they want to but yeah
S0262	yeah exactly what what other be it a surprise party though or do he know about it
S0301	well it's a semi surprise party
S0262	mm
S0301	erm in the sense that yes it be his birthday party but the surprise bite be the shoot aspect
S0262	mm
S0301	erm and er he he you know this be my particular role something that play all that well to be absolutely frank because 's sort of she erm she think it's all a lot easier than it actually be
S0262	mm mm
S0301	she say you know initially in her email erm could you go out and buy a rifle for me
S0262	mm
S0301	and just give it to him at the party of course you can't do that he's get to have a firearm certificate and
S0261	mm
S0301	erm he's get
S0262	she really well well yeah she's just kind of
S0261	misunderstand the rule
S0301	yeah yeah absolutely
S0262	she's get a misconception of what it's like
S0301	mm mm
S0262	she know now though
S0301	oh yeah
S0261	we're not in america
S0262	mm
S0261	mm
S0301	yeah exactly
S0262	quite yeah
S0261	which be the way you see it do on the telly
S0301	mm
S0261	mm
S0262	so what be the outcome in the end that you be gonna go off with him and advise him on a on a rifle
S0301	yes erm i i download print er download print off the application to join
S0262	mm
S0301	and er the the the shoot club that and i belong to
S0262	mm
S0301	which be the rifle and piston club
S0262	mm
S0301	erm so you fill that in
S0262	yeah
S0301	and and she'll give him that with a cheque for i think she agree for five hundred pound or four hundred pound i can't remember
S0262	mm
S0301	erm birthday party and she will say no i would advise you accord which which i will
S0262	mm yeah
S0301	and as well
S0262	yeah
S0301	and she say oh well you've get to go with him and and advise him to go and buy the rifle you know where to go
S0262	mm
S0301	that's more or less true
S0262	mm mm
S0301	but it's never quite as simple as that because erm in the shoot club people might like myself who be fire pretty sort of what you might call you know the ford focus type level of rifle
S0262	mm
S0301	about four hundred quid it's worth
S0261	mm
S0301	but there be guy who you know who who be fire the porsches
S0262	yeah yeah
S0301	two thousand pound special three thousand pound special so
S0262	wow
S0301	it it rather depend on how much money you want to to spend
S0262	yeah well didn't erm how much do erm spend on his to get start
S0261	no you know erm our friend who be erm
S0262	live in brisbane
S0261	like our second best man
S0301	mm
S0261	yeah he live in brisbane he's recently get quite into shoot
S0301	mm
S0261	so his australian erm firearms licence
S0301	yeah
S0261	buy himself a rifle he's get a erm erm
S0262	he's get quite a nice one actually i quite like it cos he get it out and show me and he help me
S0261	be it it might be a triple two
S0262	mm
S0261	try to remember erm can't quite remember
S0262	i what i like it actually
S0261	mm
S0301	erm so his his his an australian firearms licence read across okay into the uk do it
S0261	no no no he live in brisbane
S0262	no he live in he live in brisbane
S0301	oh he live in brisbane he live in brisbane ah
S0262	he live actually with
S0261	he live in brisbane and they have a local erm a local range that's fifteen minutes drive from his house
S0301	mm right
S0261	so he take me down there one day we just go down a saturday morning
S0301	yeah
S0261	the whole range be chocka and they have arrangements there where they could hire you out rifle if you erm if if you didn't have a licence
S0301	mm
S0261	as long as you be with a license member
S0301	mm
S0261	so on and so on so i go along and erm we simply share erm share 's rifle but erm like you say there be some people there there be some very serious people come along with a a good aluminium case with a you know well pad erm gun that they would have to assemble
S0301	mm
S0261	get all the get a little tripod out get the scope all work out and so on so on
S0301	yeah
S0262	yeah but i mean he didn't he didn't pay very much for his to start off with do he
S0261	no i think the whole thing all up cost him under five hundred dollars
S0262	mm that's reasonable
S0261	that include
S0301	have pay four or five hundred pound actually
S0261	mm
S0301	funnily enough
S0261	mm mm
S0301	sound about you know right for the uk as well
S0262	and have have much experience and shoot practice
S0301	well in in a sort of way he have because he be erm an officer in the the merchant marines
S0262	mm
S0301	and and when he be an officer in the merchant marines he be erm he work for p and o
S0262	mm
S0261	mm
S0301	and p and o erm be the sort of in those days it's all change now but in those days they be the reserve navy they be royal naval volunteer reserve officer to a man
S0262	mm
S0301	and to be er an officer erm with p and o you have to be a royal naval volunteer reserve
S0262	right
S0301	which be obviously a requirement
S0262	right
S0261	well that's quite interest
S0262	so he have his basic train then
S0301	so he have all his basic train
S0262	mm
S0301	which be all about shoot the rifle and so on so and actually he be naturally a good shoot as i have find when i've be out with him so he's fine but i'm not sure there isn't an element of decide ah i know what my man should do and you know erm
S0262	get him out the house
S0301	yeah get him out of the house and out of my feet type of thing
S0262	mm
S0301	erm cos he never
S0262	well no maybe maybe he sit maybe she think it's good for his erm hand eye coordination and
S0301	that's probably there's lot of things about him
S0262	yeah
S0301	as women do about their husband
S0262	mm
S0301	erm so i'm i'm i'm slightly wary because you know you know how men be he's go out shoot with us on a number of occasion i think that if he'd be really serious about it with and myself
S0262	yeah
S0301	he'd say listen mate something like i wanna i wanna
S0262	i wanna get involve
S0301	i wanna get you know
S0262	mm
S0261	mm mm
S0301	but he sort of say thank you very much that be very interest i really enjoy that
S0262	mm
S0301	blah blah
S0261	mm mm
S0301	and i say i'm not sure that she's not push a bite in the direction he doesn't want to go
S0262	oh god well at least have be out with you i mean it show an interest
S0301	well erm sort of but i'm not sure that again it wasn't because say listen you yeah if you're quite a good shoot and i'll tell the people you're quite a good shoot so you'd better bloody well go out with him at break and have a good time with them for god's sake really you'd get a ra ra ra
S0262	ah okay cos i mean it's you know it's quite interest because i mean just that you know erm i would imagine that have quite a few you know close friends that you know other hobbies and interest
S0301	mm
S0262	would take up your weekend or time
S0301	mm and they're bloody motorcars in his case on which he spend vast amount of money
S0262	mm
S0301	and quite right
S0262	oh well who know let's hope he like his present
S0261	well i've i've get myself i've get a lot of good friends who own rifle but hardly ever use them but they will go out at least once a year with the guy
S0301	mm
S0261	erm
S0262	they go duck shoot
S0261	and that's pretty what it be they have a traditional duck shoot thing at the in new zealand and erm first weekend in may and they're all go to the same duck pond that they always go to and they've be do this for crikey twenty years
S0301	yeah
S0261	you know
S0301	yeah
S0261	but some of the guy only have a rifle or the shotgun for that reason
S0301	mm
S0261	that's that that's all all it be but they will go because everybody's do it and erm i think if i be in a place and somebody basically say well you know erm his rifle you could go along and use this i think just with a little push i i would do that
S0262	well that's maybe what's what's what's 's interpret
S0261	mm maybe maybe yeah
S0262	that he erm you know he need a bite of a push but give him a bite of a push he'd probably quite enjoy it
S0301	mm
S0261	you do have to be i i feel like it's not something i would just go and do by myself
S0301	mm
S0261	i'd want to go along with other people
S0262	yeah i think it be one of those kind of things
S0301	yes in my case it's and myself you know we're park go to the shoot this saturday
S0261	mm right
S0301	erm yeah it's a bite lonely if you go to a club where there's lot of people where they all know each other and you know and then you don't
S0262	mm
S0301	but there's a large social aspect to it
S0262	mm
S0261	mm
S0262	oh well i see where they film seventy one last night talk about gun mm mm
S0301	mm
S0261	mm
S0262	very good very very good there be actually quite an interest character erm characterisation of a soldier who get leave behind and they've only just get to erm belfast and they you know they're all a very erm fresh you know about the whole thing even their command officer be cos they sound like they just you know straight out of sandhurst kind of thing and there's this section where you see how there be a sergeant who say they put all their riot gear on to go out into the streets and erm and the the the the lieutenant come and say no no i want everybody in berets because i want people to see i want them to see that we be here to do a different type of job you know which be the peacekeeping element and i want to reassure people that you know we're not here to kill them erm and the sergeant say be you sure sir he say yes i'm sure but when the scene play out a whole bunch of very angry people turn up erm and you know it's a riot you know a full scale riot on their hand erm and it's chaos just kind of reign erm the these paramilitary i'm not quite sure who they be but they have like you know they have armour cars but they go inside the house and they actually be talk to the well they weren't talk they be say show us where your fuck gun be you know and i'm not quite sure where they look more they look like maybe police military or something i wasn't quite sure they weren't the army erm they sort of wear black kind of big black coat that they have black erm helmets on sort of kevlars kind of thing be quite dark colour certainly not army anyway
S0301	sound like police actually
S0262	the police though the police
S0301	yeah
S0262	right so they be the police and they be quite and then they're do their bite and then the army well the troop you know the soldier try to keep the line they're not about to maintain it and er one little boy pick up a soldier's rifle run away with it the soldier who's lose his rifle run after the little boy and then then the whole big bunch of erm men just basically surround these two soldier and er one of them just come up with the pistol and just shoot the this guy straight in the face and then this woman who's actually catholic stop everyone and say how dare you to all these boys to these men you know how dare you you know what be you do be you turn into animals so this one soldier save but in the whole big scheme of things he get leave behind and that's where the story start so he's leave in belfest belfast only with a minimal brief of you've get to avoid this place call delvis flats or something like that devlers flats or
S0301	divers flats
S0262	divers flats get to avoid there because that's hostile that's pretty much all he know and then it play out erm that's he's really try to erm you know get himself back to the barrack more to it i don't think he really know where the barrack be you know erm and that and then it's you know it's the story it's the drama but it's i think it's very well do because it wasn't really about the it be suppose to try to show the complexity of who's involve so you have the army the police and undercover army i'm sure they be definitely in the barrack with these soldier
S0301	mm
S0262	with these this erm b b erm you know what be it b company but they be in civvy kit
S0301	yeah
S0262	and they'd wear like a pistol sling like a sort of thing like this you know
S0301	yeah
S0262	so that's what they be wear and they go out and they'd be do they'd be cut all these deal with all kinds of manner of people you know and you saw how much backstabbing and shift ground and even amongst the ira you saw like how they all want to kill each other they didn't trust each other and you know it it be kind of it be very well do though cos you do actually understand what be go on but it be complex yeah
S0301	it's interest it be a long time ago in seventy one but dirty war
S0262	mm
S0301	mm
S0262	but it's a it's a it's a good good to see that because you don't see many film really of of that period not cinematically anyway you know you don't see the you don't really see it i er i try to think back to a film i've see that's cover that kind of area you know the the that particular period and i can't think
S0301	there be
S0262	well there might be the orange that that's different though isn't it that be more that be later there's be there be a very very good film about the orange march
S0301	mm
S0262	but that's different that's not the same as what you're look at there i don't think but i remember see a bloody good film about the orange march
S0301	mm
S0262	really really good the orange men but erm but that's yeah the i haven't see a film like that about
S0261	kind of different isn't it
S0262	er yeah and actually be direct by a you know i think from belgium this director so it wasn't like he have any you know
S0301	mm well you need someone who's rather distant cos he'll be able to
S0262	yeah i think you do
S0301	look at something like that
S0262	yeah and try and make head or tail of it yeah
S0261	well that's interest
S0301	well be so embarrass with irish you know that the the whole thing be just such a oh such a fuck up you know
S0262	yeah yeah you saw that kind of in the film get the idea it's a fuck up yeah it's erm
S0261	do you want another sausage
S0262	no i'm full thank
S0301	yeah i i think i'll probably i think i'll probably look at it when it come out on dvd erm
S0262	mm and i think and yourself will enjoy it
S0301	mm
S0262	it's erm it's very well put together and you know you the the sense of the streets you know what it's like you know operate in this close kind confine space and
S0301	i i think there's a
S0262	bomb go off and you know car er cars on fire and
S0261	there's a a really interest point about it that it it's it's erm a period that would have be record and film as part of television
S0301	mm
S0261	and
S0262	yeah
S0261	if you go back much further that simply just wasn't the case
S0262	yeah
S0261	that you didn't have that kind of that type of journalism go on
S0262	mm
S0261	so there's there's a
S0301	that's true
S0261	a lot stronger record erm to base the film on which
S0262	it and you do get that sense of that too in fact at the begin when you when they do a they do like a erm panavision erm sweep of belfast and you can tell it's be colour correct but it's a it's actually original footage
S0301	right
S0262	yeah you know so you get that impression they've really go to the journalism and to you know
S0301	and the archive
S0262	to archive and really try to get everything right erm so yeah be interest to see what you make of it erm but the drama itself be very good you know you really be leave it be suspenseful kind of film you know
S0301	right and and the director be a belgian be he
S0262	i think so yeah i know he's not irish anyway he's certainly not a brit erm i actually have to look into who he be cos i think he do a bloody good job and the the lead actor who's the solder who's leave behind i be tell this morning that i've see him on television he be in a series in the uk but it really this be his first feature film and it's really his act that carry this film
S0301	well it's good mm
S0262	very well cos it's really all about this soldier who get you know leave behind and he's try to make sense of who to trust what's go on and people be try to kill him and you know
S0301	mm
S0262	and he's just only arrive you know he's fresh off the boat kind of thing
S0301	yeah
S0262	so doesn't really know what's go on
S0301	i mean to a certain extent it's base on a know incident because they do and and it's to the british army's shame forever and one of the patrol they leave a soldier behind and and he be execute by the ira a weapon
S0262	oh jees
S0301	erm and the women close in on them and they be bang bang bang bang on the
S0262	bang on the yeah with the dustbin lids yeah
S0301	and shoot them dead
S0262	mm
S0301	only seventeen years of age
S0262	mm
S0301	erm and and it's sort of one of things in the british army mythology we'll never go there again type of thing
S0262	no no no
S0301	and they know the woman who do it
S0262	there be a woman who shoot the soldier
S0301	yes yes
S0262	crikey
S0301	and she's in the republic of ireland and they extradite her
S0261	because she's in the republic
S0262	oh god
S0301	yeah i know not because the republic of ireland wouldn't extradite her but they can't they can't actually put the evidence together
S0262	mm
S0301	they to and to to to pardon me to mount a convince case
S0262	yeah yeah
S0301	in spite of the fact that her son be shoot by the southern irish army try to do a hold up erm on a erm oops pardon me on a erm up wagon which be carry a tonne of money at some
S0262	oh i think i remember that story yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0301	he be kill dead
S0262	yeah yeah
S0301	she's still run around in the er republic
S0262	yeah
S0301	and and you know they've look at how
S0262	mm
S0301	how how can we actually get the evidence together and seemingly they can't so she's go to go free for ever more so you know there's a lot of history and a lot of baggage about the whole northern irish campaign that everybody want sweep under the carpet
S0262	mm
S0301	which be fine
S0262	mm
S0301	things have to be like that eventually
S0262	mm mm
S0301	erm though that's painful it be painful
S0262	yeah that's painful yeah
S0301	mm cos the regiment concern who leave him behind they be label as shit in the british army
S0262	yeah which regiment be that cos i couldn't make it out
S0301	it be very unfortunate it be the royal fusiliers erm
S0262	fusiliers yeah think it be yeah okay yeah
S0301	who up to that point have actually since be you know have be look at or view as rather the major the crack regiment the british army
S0262	wow and then that one incident have er change their reputation forever more
S0301	mm yeah
S0262	yeah crikey yes and i be discuss that cos we be wonder whether some of that story have be base on something factual you know and i be think well it must be because
S0301	it be yeah
S0262	it's such a yeah
S0301	it's totally base on factual there be one guy who be kill
S0262	well yeah
S0301	but there be they make a second guy who go on the run
S0262	get get on yeah that's right yeah yeah we that's right well that's right you see erm yeah they actually come back later for the body
S0301	mm mm
S0262	cos they can't actually get to it at that particular moment in time because the chaos just be you know out of control everyone be just get into their army vehicles and try to get the hell out of there
S0261	yeah
S0262	mm mm
S0261	mm
S0262	it's just very a very very unfair yeah oh well i hope everyone have enjoy their sausages
S0301	mm quite good
S0262	mm
S0261	mm
S0262	think it'd be nice to watch a film wouldn't it well we'll have to have a look at your erm dvd collection dad but before we do that
S0261	i be gonna ask you something else about erm when i'm in germany meet up with a whole pile of erm software entrepreneurs and erm one of the guy have he's just be to er kind of a gather in the us and he come back and he's suggest this idea that we erm as a group erm have this kind of hot seat session he call it which be basically you you get twenty minutes per piece erm and you pitch er pitch kind of what your business be about or your particular interest in something erm and and and a problem that you wanna have solve and then the group kind of help help you get over a hurdle i suppose
S0301	yeah yeah mm mm
S0261	erm now interestingly through the kind of method of of kind of events over the last few days this guy's end up schedule it pretty much everybody within twenty minutes which mean that we end up with a whole five hours of this kind of
S0301	yeah
S0261	which sound a bite it's a bite frankly
S0301	bite dramatic
S0261	yeah bite yes
S0262	yeah
S0261	oh be it do you think so
S0301	well yeah yeah yeah yeah it be
S0262	everyone have their turn
S0261	well that's quite interest okay erm i hadn't really kind of think of about
S0301	mind you don't say don't say that to
S0261	no no no but i mean
S0301	i i think the way the germans would play this be to say yeah well everybody and they've all get their twenty minutes have a look at the programme which one do you wanna listen to fuck off and have a coffee you know in between sort of that's the german way
S0261	right i see they'll be this kind of erm the way i i kind of appreciate it be you could have you could spend your twenty minutes and then you've get four hours or something sit around or something listen to what everybody else be say
S0301	yeah
S0261	you're kind of like how's how's the value there and
S0301	yeah
S0261	sure you'll learn something out of other people's experience so it's a give
S0301	well that's probably true yes
S0261	but if they're not practically erm relevant to your point in time
S0301	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0261	you're unlikely to use them or find them of a benefit for for for all
S0301	yeah yeah so
S0261	so why would you
S0301	have a yeah that's that's that's germanic
S0261	so what i've erm be talk to some friends about be this idea of if the business a problem so this be kind of the i suppose the context of this this particular session erm what i do be talk about some of these various people in their they're start up businesses i be talk to my friends about it and and i kinda say well there be all these people who be individuals try to start a business by themselves so they've get to upskill and learn and do everything all by themselves to get to some kind of point where they've get enough of a customer base to get the software up and run right
S0301	mm mm
S0261	and they don't have the resources to hire people generally so it be pretty much a long march for by themselves
S0301	mm
S0261	so i frame this idea of erm what if erm we could get er the appropriate erm skilled people together identify a particular objective for a session erm for the benefit of that person and their business but that it would by by do this exercise it would propel it would make their business jump for some reason and it would be about not just solve a problem it be actually take action and do the work during the session as a collective group so you could imagine if you get together ten people to help solve a problem that might take one person erm three months to do and that maybe you could do all that in a day and this this kind of the grand the grand kind of vision of it
S0301	yeah maybe yeah
S0261	so erm my friend seem to quite like that idea and so then it make me think well and i've get this germanic approach to things erm
S0261	that that actually more how
S0301	i'm joke about that
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah i know i know
S0262	yeah but he be the one who want to get the slab of beer in doesn't he he want to yeah
S0261	yeah this be this be right yeah
S0262	yeah he he preordered the beers so that everyone could have beer
S0261	yeah he basically want probably sit around so everybody could have a beer while while we're all listen in on what somebody else be go on about
S0301	oh that that sound germanic that's
S0261	so so i'm kind of
S0301	that's a good that he's a good german
S0262	that's a good yeah
S0261	yeah i'm kind of curious erm to get your thoughts about if i have my twenty minutes and i want to try and test this idea with that it's not the right type of place and there's not enough time to really demonstrate the value or the benefit of do such an exercise
S0301	i'm not i i quite agree but anyway go on
S0261	mm okay so okay well that's interest so what be what what what what approach might you take in to
S0301	well i i i tend to think that if you're put over a business case if you can't put it over in about ten minutes
S0261	mm
S0301	you haven't think it through
S0261	mm
S0301	would sort of be my view but but it'd be you know the horse for course seem terribly complex you know you'll need more time but as as an opener i'd say if you can't put it over in ten minutes er just give you a a feel for this erm i've get to go out and talk about erm and talk about the whole issue of erm erm the the the the village and the problems we've get with traffic etcetera etcetera erm and a particular a particular erm application which be for a new tesco's erm er
S0261	down the other end of the village
S0301	no not down the other end of the village
S0262	halfway in the middle but yeah it's the super place
S0301	yeah to in the er it be the er it be the er the car showrooms i'll be give three minutes
S0262	wow it's not long at all be it
S0261	that's as a part of what a plan erm hear or something
S0301	yeah yeah
S0261	three minutes okay right yeah so
S0301	yeah so you know it make one think
S0261	yeah of course
S0301	it make one think
S0261	yeah that i i appreciate
S0301	get succinct
S0261	i appreciate what you're say and and maybe i didn't make it clear the the intention be that erm you have the floor for twenty minutes they're there to listen and to pitch in and help the point be be you pitch your idea in two or three minutes and then the remainder of the time you can erm get their support or their feedback on particular things so you've
S0301	oh well that's different
S0261	get an opportunity to to
S0301	that's that's different that's different
S0261	use them and test them to either find a solution to some problem that you're have or maybe to trial something out with
S0301	no no no that that's different i i misunderstand i misunderstand
S0261	so you know you could say you could imagine this be some sort of device or product that i've just
S0301	yeah
S0261	manufacture give each one of them and go okay have a look at it feel it erm point it at the tv see whether it turn on whatever it be
S0301	yeah
S0261	and get their each of their erm opinions on it or something
S0301	mm
S0261	or something like that so i be kind of think we have this er kind of problem which be to hear everybody else take such a long time period of time and the and and the context of my idea be about try to get all of that kind of thing do in a shorter amount of time if it if i actually have the time to apply my real thing i would say let's have a whole day and demonstrate how much value we can actually create as a group in a day
S0301	you've get a
S0261	yes that's that's true so i can i can tie that down as a message to two or three minutes that people get that but what i be think be you've get a big group of people so imagine like a lecture hall and and er somebody's get the opportunity to speak and not everybody can speak at the same time so it's always one by one typically in a group it'll be the ones who like to be hear or put their hand up and and the quiet ones who may have some good ideas don't really shout
S0301	always the way
S0261	so what i be think be to my idea and then what i want be their feedback and their opinions about whether it's something that might be valuable to them personally personally and also how they might imagine how it would work so if if i say to you you've get my attention for five hours and i'm bring ten of my mat what would you like me to do for you and can i provide you a ten time result on on what you could do in this period of time or something
S0301	i think i i i think i'd i'd sort of say oh christ i'm not sure if i'd want to go in that direction to be frank i i think if you've get a very short period of time erm my my inclination would be to give them a teaser and they're i i i can do this and i can do that and i can do the other and just speak for a very short period of time and if they've get twenty or thirty minutes er you know if you give them a teaser they may come and say oh christ what be you bloody talk about er what be you say you know what you could do you could wa wa wa wa what be you talk about
S0301	erm and and then you've get the retention you're actually in pole position
S0262	mm
S0261	cos the other way i be think of it be take them and simply just put them into group erm so you've not get the big crowd and say okay as a group take this teaser problem away work on it work on it for
S0301	but you could you could
S0261	fifteen twenty minutes and then i get four time the answer than everybody else get for the same
S0301	well you could i mean you you could do that and and you know and that would i think probably entail set the teaser all the more short
S0261	mm
S0301	probably
S0261	mm
S0301	probably
S0261	so you get more effort and time go into the think and and
S0301	yes
S0261	discussion
S0301	what the hell be what the hell be he talk about jesus bloody christ
S0261	mm yeah
S0301	that sound listen what be you fuck talk about come on ra ra ra ra ra
S0261	but you see that's the nice thing about it because if if we're do this on on friday and we're still there saturday and sunday then you've get all of this other time to get to know people and talk about your ideas in the background
S0301	yeah to yes
S0261	so it kind of help you go further than just this particular session
S0262	mm mm
S0301	yeah
S0261	and potentially get people who be interest in trialling it out
S0262	how how large be the group go to be in this
S0301	i think there's about twenty of us
S0262	i think that's about an okay erm number to do the first one without have to break people into group cos i find with erm organise you know classroom and train and stuff like that it's try to get people who don't know each other yet very well without a clear objective to actually do group work in quite a short amount of time erm you know it depend on the personalities that be within the group
S0301	you tend to get the dominant personalities
S0262	yeah
S0262	and it can be a bite loose and a bite kind of and a bite chatty and a bite not quite on task and you you know you don't wanna come across as be lose as you'd say the teaser part of it you don't wanna look like you're come across go right come on you've get to you know give me something at the end of your group work i want some kind of result you know which be you you you really want them to actually each other's voice you want people to be able to say look you know i think i i think i understand what you mean but be it like this or be it more like that so their question be the question that be gonna set your think go about what kind of things they want to know more about so in some respect actually keep them all together and watch look and listen from each other be quite a good way to get those people who haven't actually even cotton on to what you're really ask them to do yet to have a bite of think time and then put their hand up and then say something and then say something and there'll always be people who wanna go last because they want to hear other people's opinions
S0301	yes
S0262	they like to hang back to say
S0301	in fact i always go last
S0262	be go last yeah
S0301	i always go last i have to tell you
S0262	yeah so people like that they like to be give that opportunity to sort of order where they might go in term of ask question and then there'll be people who just won't ask question cos they prefer to listen you know
S0261	mm
S0301	yeah so yeah it's an interest point you you you think twenty be sort of the break even point for you
S0262	i think so yeah
S0301	yeah
S0262	in my in
S0301	i i you know
S0262	i often do that when i've do workshops you know i keep everybody ask me question twenty people can ask me question but that you it require a bite of skill
S0301	and and you've get a fair amount of time by the sound of
S0262	yeah
S0301	you know you probably get more time than you actually need i would have think but you know see how it go yeah
S0262	i agree with dad like if if you talk less and get them to talk more they're go to find the whole session much more interest
S0301	yeah that's i mean that's a none everybody like the sound of their own voice absolutely
S0262	yeah and it's the same with me if i'm a teacher i'm always the same you know less teacher talk time more student talk time you know that's the whole kind of thing that you get you know train into know that you've speak for too long
S0301	mm mm
S0262	and and i think yeah if you prepare something very succinct but just enough to tease them into actually ask question the question then pose new question and then pose new problems so actually it's quite a a beneficial erm it's a beneficial process for you because if you actually have some way of record the question and some of the discussions around the question you could help you really see where their mind be go towards first with this teaser
S0261	so you think if you put the people into group then you're kind of hide part of the discussion
S0262	at this stage yes once they get if you do group work at the end on a sunday i think yeah you could do it because they've actually familiarise themselves and i think they've warm up to each other
S0261	yeah
S0262	but group work require warmth for it to really be productive
S0261	fingerprint and stuff like that after the greasy sausage yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0301	what's oh what's in the box
S0261	that's a good question
