S0617	mm
S0525	erm cheapskate didn't do it properly both the combi and the forklift get stick in it
S0614	stick
S0525	the transport company have to come and lift them out this morning with a hiab which be erm a lorry with a crane on the back
S0617	how do they
S0614	and it's a forklift truck
S0525	the combi as well i mean the combi's massive
S0525	so it's i say brilliant go yeah it's a laugh a minute erm say wasn't in this morning there's nobody in there be no one seem to know that the combi be stick until they arrive this morning so i don't know what have happen be off first thing probably drive it in them so they tell to drive
S0525	the other one on it which immediately sink and get stick too
S0525	poor
S0525	poor be rush off her feet and then say and be off to lunch and after lunch we're go to so 's the only one in and he'd have plenty to say about it this morning so i don't know when they get stick i bet drive the one in and leave if he be in on monday and now they tell the young lad to to use the other one if he couldn't get that one work so he drive that one and
S0525	get sink into the grind i mean can you imagine i mean how
S0614	there's that bite of er land next door isn't there that er 's get
S0525	be be that what he's
S0525	be that what he's do
S0614	something like that yeah
S0525	so but next erm
S0525	so before the car park area cos they've get the their yard
S0614	yeah
S0525	be there a bite still next to the yard before the car park cos they've make one
S0614	well i think so yeah
S0525	they've make one for all the cars in it
S0614	he do yeah yeah
S0525	it's before that be it or after
S0614	no i don't exactly know
S0525	oh dear
S0614	but all i hear be he'd get he'd get three months free rent from er
S0525	well there's two forklifts stick in it now
S0525	imagine a great big hiab have to come and lift these things out
S0614	yeah
S0525	so he's gonna have to redo it properly now
S0617	be that cos they do it cheap
S0525	yeah yeah he didn't put down enough erm well he cos er er they vary tarmac and what you can get down but obviously if you're carry big heavy
S0617	you want the best
S0525	tonne
S0617	yeah
S0525	a tonne erm could be a fit could weigh up to a tonne
S0617	gotta be hardwearing
S0525	and that's why they couldn't use the the forklift they have the big combi truck which be three time the size of the little forklift
S0614	yeah
S0525	so that's a massive truck to lift the big fit so if you've get that truck and a fit on it of course you need a really substantial and it's gonna be expensive
S0617	oh my life
S0525	he's gonna be try to argue now against the company that do the hardcore i'm sure but go he just do it on the cheap
S0617	yeah
S0614	yeah yeah
S0525	well that's make me laugh i tell you
S0614	cos if you
S0525	how funny be that
S0614	if you look down the erm from the avenue down near the the gate
S0525	yes
S0614	er you can see there's a couple of pip actually where the cars usually go so i don't know whether they've
S0525	oh unless it's on the it's the other side of the cars could be
S0614	feel like you can see but er anyway it's er obviously not haven't do a very good job
S0525	oh dear say half a day be enough for this week
S0617	oh yeah she go in today didn't she instead of come to
S0525	yeah yeah so erm
S0617	that sound hilarious
S0614	have they erm those big blue pip in glasgow weight three tonnage
S0525	that's about right yeah
S0614	yeah
S0525	yeah
S0614	so if you've get you've get some hardcore hold you know these type of pip yeah
S0525	yeah i mean we we don't tend to move anything quite that cos they're thirteen and a half metres long as well aren't they i mean we do get some that big but we tend to get they might have a bite less than that job
S0614	oh
S0525	the odd five metre length or a and they do tend to bring that back there because sometimes they use it for demonstration purpose they cut it and weld it again to show people how to do it or if somebody want the odd offcut and they can sell it so we don't but we don't tend
S0525	to get the the big big pipe but yeah it of course it's heavy stuff i mean as i say a fit can weigh a tonne i think they buy that truck which could take be the truck to take up to a tonne or up to four tonnes i forget what why
S0525	they buy a truck but erm
S0525	yeah when you're when you're carry those erm those pip on it and they do do that
S0525	oh dear me
S0614	they get stick in the
S0617	have send me a link

S0617	this be the new aeroplane isn't it
S0614	the big one that's come to yeah
S0617	be it
S0614	yeah they've extend the runway and er they can now take the big a380 which be a double decker six hundred people carrier
S0617	here
S0614	yeah so that'll be good for er
S0617	come to what airport
S0614	if if
S0617	
S0614	yeah yeah
S0617	when do they
S0614	they've already have them in and and and so
S0617	oh
S0614	i think it be just inevitable that we would we would have it here
S0617	isn't that what we go on to erm come back on from thailand i'm sure it would have be you know
S0614	well no it's only just come
S0617	no no to heathrow we go to
S0614	oh i see
S0617	i'm sure we fly on a massive plane like that
S0614	could have be yeah
S0617	the plane go out there i keep say to be smaller than the one that we come back on the one that we come back on dad i've never be on a plane like it i don't think
S0614	right good
S0617	you know erm
S0617	where else so you've get like the three seat by the window you know how when you're by the window normally it's just the window here isn't it
S0614	right yeah
S0617	on this plane you go a big circle
S0614	oh yeah
S0617	so like could or put your arm and you could put your head in the the window almost
S0614	oh okay almost like a sort of
S0617	like a
S0614	pod
S0617	pod yeah yeah
S0614	you could sleep in there
S0617	yeah the the
S0614	sleep in the pod
S0617	it curve out so much
S0614	oh well there you be
S0617	cos like no this isn't bigger this isn't bigger i be like it a hundred per cent be bigger
S0614	right yeah they're massive plan now look at the size of that thing
S0617	yeah do they have to extend the runway cos it take so much longer to stop do it
S0614	yeah yeah
S0617	why do it take longer to stop
S0614	cos it's bigger and yes anything bigger and travel at a faster speed be gonna take longer to stop
S0617	do they travel at a faster speed
S0614	although yeah i think they can probably sort of the same speed but anything bigger will take longer to stop if it's bigger
S0617	right
S0614	wouldn't it
S0617	okay yeah
S0614	so er amaze bigger and better look at the size of that
S0617	yeah it's massive how many people six hundred
S0614	yeah
S0617	be that the most a plane can hold
S0614	any plane you mean
S0617	yeah
S0614	well i don't know i presume it must be close to it yeah so should be erm the fanfare about this plane that it must be er
S0617	be this the
S0614	the biggest no no no
S0617	oh it's not
S0614	it's it's that's the that's national news that be that's the steelworks
S0617	oh
S0614	yes

S0614	anyway i er oh there's the hijack let's check my tea shall we see whether it's erm whether it's do or not do you want a chip
S0617	no what have you get in there
S0614	erm fish fillet steak fish and erm

S0525	or it's not gonna be worth the money they want for it i mean you haven't gotta keep it as erm a house and an office you could have two home there could you i suppose and
S0614	mm
S0525	like a granny annex or something
S0614	mm
S0525	it's hot
S0617	too much salt you've get on there
S0525	i know i do spill it down that end mm oh i should have have some chip now be go to the shop before he come round not not that i want anything

S0525	be she
S0617	she be indeed
S0525	that's good
S0617	so i'm just try to have a look at rotas for
S0525	oh work
S0617	yeah i think i've do them unfair
S0525	why
S0617	cos one girl's do two lates this week and then she's do them a lot next week and the week after again
S0525	two lates
S0617	yeah
S0525	do some of them prefer lates
S0617	no nobody want to do them
S0525	oh nobody want to yeah but before in you have some people that
S0617	yes be very different to
S0525	prefer that because if they have little kid they get them to bed or
S0617	yeah
S0525	or they do the school run
S0617	no nobody like do them
S0525	yeah that's a shame
S0614	yeah
S0617	mm
S0525	do they have to a certain amount be it part of the contract or
S0617	yeah yeah but i i'd i don't i find do a rota be so tricky
S0525	why
S0617	cos there's so many people
S0525	oh do you have to be fair then with the number of hours you give everybody
S0617	yeah everyone's gotta do certain hours and some people can only do some days and
S0525	oh
S0617	you've gotta have enough people to open and enough people to close and you can't have too many people
S0614	yeah
S0617	do too many close in a week and then if they've do two close the week before they can't do two close that week
S0525	really why
S0617	just because otherwise you'll give more i'd probably give one girl all the close like and not realise i'll give her three close every week
S0525	oh
S0617	kind of thing and then
S0525	crikey it's like erm it's like a game you should be able to enter all the criteria and up come a name she take this shift that's what you need a programme that you can go
S0617	yeah
S0525	right didn't do any
S0614	sort it all out for you
S0525	didn't do any
S0614	yeah
