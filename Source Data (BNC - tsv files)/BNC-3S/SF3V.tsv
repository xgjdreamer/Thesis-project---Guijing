S0282	right so every tape start with me talk about whether it's on or not
S0287	hello hello be it run
S0282	yes about if everybody who do a tape corpus just spend the whole time talk about what they're do be we tap be it start
S0282	you know what happen to the tap dunno
S0288	well yeah yeah no i suppose there's a value in that
S0282	yes i know
S0287	it's just a bite limit
S0282	yeah well i mean they only have vocabulary on one particularly subject which be whether you're record or not
S0282	they might not want that
S0287	not even a lot of slang around that either be there
S0282	no not really

S0287	no i mean get choir
S0282	oh no we rehearse we rehearse at erm a church which be in village where she use to take her children to playgroup so she use to walk up there every morning with the kid to playgroup at this particular church so it's not very far
S0287	oh right okay
S0282	but we need more recruit because
S0287	but she's a good she's a good singer isn't she
S0282	if they're too she's a very good singer yes she's have lessons
S0287	i don't know why i know that or be i just assume that because all the kid be so musical
S0282	no she be she be always sing she be she have sing lessons at university i don't know if you meet her when i be do you ever meet her when we be all at university
S0287	erm no i think it be only subsequently

S0287	three little maids
S0282	with our choir if there's not enough people we don't you know it's very difficult to do gigs because if you go and do a gig and there's less than twenty it sound really pathetic

S0287	what kind of thing do she want then
S0282	i can't bear these good time choir
S0288	oh oh dear mm
S0287	what's a good time choir
S0282	well you know where you're not
S0288	it's it's where you have a good time
S0282	serious musicians
S0288	mm
S0282	and i say well that's a bite snobby of you isn't it

S0282	no i mean i can sing in tune actually mostly
S0287	mm mm
S0282	although the arrangements they do for this choir be so weird some of the songs you know it's just and it seem to have no rationality to it at all it's quite scary you know unless you know your part you just don't know where you be at all because it go up and down in a really weird way
S0287	they have erm you know load of buskers on the high street here which be quite a lot of fun but they have erm the er youth choir every so often and they particularly with christmas carol and things like that and they're quite jolly so load of good stuff there and there's a bloke that busk with his sons and like he play the double bass and er the boys play guitar
S0282	oh that'd be quite fun
S0287	and er yeah and then er they they're quite popular and then we go where be they mexicans or something but mexicans
S0288	oh that lot they're well they're south americans
S0287	oh yeah
S0282	oh not the ones with the panpipes
S0288	be they
S0287	well you do get them from time to time but there's no there's a different lot

S0282	lisa bonin something
S0287	no
S0288	no i don't have i've no idea what she's call
S0282	laura no
S0288	but it be a it be a jolly good programme i like that
S0282	do you see the one where they have a series of three of her cat where they put gps trackers
S0288	i saw some of it where they could track
S0287	yeah see where they go yeah
S0282	on those cat
S0288	that's it
S0282	that be very funny and they they be they have the the urban cat in bristol where
S0288	they be good yes oh yes that be it
S0282	this family find out that their cat be menace all all the other cat in the street and there's this other cat down the street that be so nervous and its owners couldn't work out why this cat be have a nervous breakdown
S0287	it be beat up every day
S0282	every time it put its nose outside
S0288	but it get it get batter
S0282	outside the cat flap this other cat go ah
S0282	jump on it
S0282	so oh no it's our cat ha ha ha
S0287	what can you do about that that's awful
S0282	no i know well you can't do anything can you
S0288	it's the same as
S0282	but then there be the farm cat where they have they put trackers on about six or seven of these farm cat and they be in the middle of nowhere and they all have a different route every day
S0287	mm
S0282	but they do the same along this hedge over that wall
S0287	yeah
S0282	they but they all they do their own route
S0287	down that field
S0282	every day
S0282	so you know ginger tom go this way along this hedge over here he do six miles he come back home again this one go over the it be strange cos they be either ginger or torties these ones
S0287	mm
S0282	so half all the girls be torties and all the boys be ginger but they all have their different rout they all radiate out in completely different directions it be very very excite watch what they do but so i think that be quite a good no who win on the cat versus dog thing do they come to a verdict
S0287	well it doesn't matter what verdict you come to cos you're still go to prefer the one that you prefer
S0282	that's true yes it's not a question of which be better really
S0287	no it's what you want out of them really you know
S0288	different different kinds of creatures
S0282	they be different kinds of creature i don't understand people well i mean i suppose if you get you do go actually go out for a walk twice a day so theoretically
S0287	well quite a lot of people do
S0282	you're quite fit and you have exercise and you live longer because you're
S0288	and a lot of dog people take their dog out every day
S0288	hence my brother be very successful with his business
S0282	i know perhaps i should do dog walk
S0282	so actually everybody round our way actually walk their own dog i mean actually that's the nice thing about live where we do it's like what have somebody else walk your dog why would you have somebody else to walk the dog or
S0287	why have a dog go out yourself yes
S0282	why have a dog yourself yes
S0287	so quite often work at home so erm so she take her dog out twice a day
S0282	have she get oh she's get a dog as well have she
S0288	she's get a very old dog
S0287	yeah she's a black lab but she's very old she's get she's get bad hips
S0282	oh they do
S0287	so
S0282	don't labradors have bad hips
S0287	well she get one particularly bad hip that i also think be damage when she be quite young and she's
S0287	get one ear that she's tilt her head on one side all the time so one ear stand up that one stand up and that one flop down all the time
S0282	oh really
S0287	yes
S0282	i'm slightly worry about the cat because it put its head on one side look very endear but i think actually perhaps it's get neurological problems
S0287	might've have a stroke
S0282	yes already at the age of eighteen months
S0287	but er
S0282	i i'm actually wait
S0287	's very she's very fond of
S0282	wait for oh right
S0287	yes cos
S0282	the dog
S0287	yeah the dog be yeah erm dog's probably one of 's best mat really and er
S0282	who isn't fond of though
S0287	even the dog and erm er he go round their house and the dog climb all over and sit there and gaze at him
S0282	ah
S0287	and he go with her he walk
S0282	that's
S0287	he walk her every so often as well
S0282	do he
S0287	it's yeah
S0282	oh that's nice
S0287	especially now 's away cos he's in study
S0282	oh be he
S0287	yeah
S0282	be he what foreign foreign university
S0287	yeah
S0282	that's very sensible 's at the foreign university she's in germany and it's work out really well and fee be really cheap so why shouldn't you go
S0287	well indeed and i expect her german's come along quite well as well be it or not
S0282	no well actually that be the reason they think she might fail her degree because she have to get to a certain level of proficiency in german and she didn't so you know they have to kind of do lot of cram and things
S0282	she's not very she's not very academic and i think she probably get erm some i think she's get some kind of learn disability really but she's a strange child and all of 's children have quirky hang up really one way and another
S0287	mm
S0282	so erm it's er or at least i don't or whether be make heavy weather of it really one or the other
S0287	we usually screw up the first one so
S0282	well
S0287	if you're go to make mistake it's gonna be with the first one
S0282	yeah i know well look at me basket case

S0282	i don't he just unless he be just say that really could've just be say that
S0287	well cos even with three you're gonna have conflict aren't you cos you you know one's the oldest one's the youngest and one's one's in the middle you know the only way you aren't go to be if one's the eldest and one's the youngest

S0282	that with the what the what be those things they have those play card
S0287	oh god those things pokemon card
S0282	pokemon
S0287	oh bloody hell
S0282	that be dreadful that that erm kind of addiction stuff
S0287	yeah

S0287	well yeah i know but er yeah just doesn't he doesn't compete he's not
S0282	no
S0287	positive he doesn't want to beat other people
S0282	no well there be some unpaid debts though really
S0282	the truth be know but no erm 's into these erm octonaut things
S0287	oh yeah see them
S0282	and there's always like a trillion billion things to collect there's something that's marginally different from the other thing and these creatures and when i be visit i find myself have to read this novel for children by stephen fry
S0287	oh what's it call
S0282	at bedtime can't remember what it's call it be about grandpa story about grandpa
S0287	oh yeah oh stephen fry be you sure

S0287	be it not david walliams
S0282	oh no david walliams yes david walliams
S0287	about the gangster granny
S0282	be it gangster granny
S0282	no it wasn't no it be about a grandpa rather than a granny no i haven't no i haven't get onto can't speak now gangster granny
S0287	there's there's mr stink
S0282	wasn't mr stink no it's definitely about grandpa
S0282	and grandpa imagine himself as a first world war fly ace or have be a first world war fly ace or something
S0287	oh right no i don't know what the name of that one be he's very roald dahl esque
S0282	yes
S0287	especially when you have the illustrations be the same as well
S0282	well i do but i do wonder
S0287	but he's hugely popular in in the children's bestselling list he's he occupy five out of the ten first ten slot
S0282	really
S0287	and then you get the remain three you know three out of the remain five be wimpy kid and then you get one or two other things tack on the bottom
S0282	mm erm i wonder whether he would've get into print if he hadn't be david walliams
S0287	oh oh no well no i think there's a certain amount of appeal actually i don't they're not they're all you can see where he's come from
S0287	you can see where he's come from but you've get you've also get
S0282	but there must be people
S0287	lampard write children's well in invert commas
S0282	what frank lampard
S0287	frank lampard apparently
S0282	oh really
S0287	in invert commas write children's stories about football
S0282	really
S0287	yes and apparently chris hoy start write children's stories
S0288	yes he have
S0282	well that's cycle
S0287	yes
S0282	cycle stories mm
S0287	yes
S0288	mm
S0287	so erm you know whether whether he's write them and whether he's he's you know i don't know not quite sure whether frank lampard have write any of his or whether somebody else have write them for him i don't know
S0287	i don't know about chris hoy whether he's any good at that kind of thing or not it remain to be see
S0288	who be who be who be marry to prince andrew
S0282	oh yeah
S0288	she she do didn't she
S0282	little budgie budgie the helicopter
S0287	oh yeah budgie
S0288	budgie the helicopter
S0282	yeah
S0282	and it be difficult to know because i think you get your break that way when people sort of say well oh gosh it be do all on my own talent and you think yeah but you know somebody listen to you in the first place you're son or daughter of x
S0288	well yeah
S0282	so how would you get your break otherwise there must be people who be more talented who just don't get a break
S0288	no
S0287	well j k rowling get reject by
S0282	i know
S0287	don't know how many publishers first
S0282	yeah
S0287	and then you know you open up book one and you read the first sentence and you think pff sorry no thank you which be probably exactly what happen
S0288	mm
S0282	well i i mean i think it's so derivative i mean it's tolkein and it's erm who be the other one
S0288	c s lewis
S0282	c s lewis yeah i mean it's so derivative of both of those
S0287	yeah but you don't expect your average ten year old to know anything about either of those people do you it's news to all of them
S0282	well yeah but then that that's what i when i think to myself do you know what i need to kind of do something i think well what's the trend that's come up what be who be there that's out of fashion that's that's old fashion that young people don't know about that you could actually zhuzh up
S0288	yeah
S0282	and kind of turn into a modern version of say same thing
S0288	mm
S0282	i mean like you know for example just be read stella gibbons you know you know helen field be stella stella gibbons isn't she really so that's kinda come round again bridget jones et cetera
S0288	mm
S0282	be the equivalent modern equivalent of so you've get to work out i mean like with interior decoration and all sort of things you've gotta work out whether
S0287	like with you've get you've get george george nicolson you see you won't know him though
S0282	who
S0287	george george nicolson that's louise rennison have a character call george nicolson who would who's who would be the er equivalent
S0282	oh right
S0287	bridget jones
S0282	mm so you have get to work out what's about to come round again you know and catch the wave i think i get quite good at that in term of interior décor cos i be read so many decorate magazines i think i could anticipate trend in them but
S0287	well i want purple curtain upstairs and could i find any purple fabric
S0282	no
S0287	no i bloom couldn't because it be completely out of
S0282	yes
S0287	kilter
S0282	and when i be try to do our shower at road and i be why don't they make an integral shower cabinet you just buy
S0287	it would be so easy wouldn't it with all your the only hole you have be the plughole at the bottom and a door at the front
S0282	yeah and the hole
S0287	yes
S0282	the hole where the electric shower come through
S0287	yes
S0282	where the pipe electric and everything else be just a cubicle a whole cubicle
S0287	yeah with no hole
S0282	no hole
S0287	with no seam
S0282	no gap no seam no no leak no anything and you just you just have it deliver on a lorry and you just slot it into the corner of the room be there such a thing no
S0287	there still isn't i don't think be there
S0282	there be
S0287	be there somebody's invent it
S0282	yeah they somebody have invent them now and they've also invent these wedi board wall which be so instead of have to tile your cubicle you've get a whole great big sheet of wedi board which be waterproof which be waterproof and erm and so you just you just gum it to the wall and then you put your shower in on top of it your shower tray and your shower and everything so then you've actually just get one waterproof wall with with with the only seam in the corner mind you i suppose you can have a leak in the corner but but you know when and i be sort of think how do you get this invent 's
S0287	oh yes
S0282	have invent something
S0287	have he what's he invent
S0282	he have invent circular kitchen roll
S0287	i'm sorry circular kitchen roll
S0282	circular kitchen roll yes
S0287	how how do a circular kitchen roll work
S0282	well you have you have a round thing with a cone in it and you fold your circular kitchen roll into a cone and then you stack them up so you've get two hundred separate kitchen roll circular ones in a cone and then it's get a little
S0287	but they won't be in a cone will they they'll be in a they'll be in like a stack of pancakes they can't be like a cone
S0282	no no cos they're in a cone
S0287	they can't be in a cone how can they be in a if they're circular they can't be on a cone there'd have to be a fold
S0282	and they've get they they be fold yes they're kind of there's an origami thing so you have a circular thing and then somebody take a a triangular fold and then put it on this stand so it's in a cone and you have a little plastic
S0287	so be there a lot of witch hat on top of each other
S0282	yes yes
S0287	okay
S0282	yes two hundred witch hat on top of each other with a little plastic cone on top to keep them in place so then you take the plastic cone off and you pinch out your kitchen roll
S0287	like a box of tissue
S0282	and then you unfold it and it's yes and it's circular so
S0287	what's the what be the advantage of it be circular
S0282	ah you can transport twenty percent more kitchen roll in the same
S0288	space
S0282	in the same space on the lorry
S0288	oh
S0282	so it's
S0288	good
S0282	really good for the environment
S0288	it's like
S0287	what but it circular be no way better than square
S0288	it's like
S0287	when you're transport things
S0282	yes it be
S0287	how can it be
S0282	because the pack be
S0287	cos you fill all the corner if it's square and you can't fill all the corner if it's circular
S0282	no because it come like this it's wrap so they're all round
S0288	box
S0282	so they all
S0288	mm
S0282	squash up together
S0287	but they don't all squash up together you're still gonna have space in between
S0288	yeah they're probably smaller space though it's like wrap kit kats on the on the
S0282	apparently you can
S0288	it's
S0282	sorry what
S0282	kit kats
S0288	you know they change the way they do kitkats instead of cos they use to just do them square and them somebody say well if you do it on a slant you can use less silvery paper and they save a humongous amount of money
S0287	i'm not sure it's true well i don't know how it be true
S0282	what the kit kats or the paper
S0287	the paper
S0288	on the paper
S0282	ah
S0287	yeah so instead of have a bite of paper that shape and the kit kat square like that they turn it
S0288	in the middle
S0287	it turn at an angle
S0282	ah
S0288	you turn at an angle and you can do it with smaller
S0287	and you fold over the corner instead
S0288	with less
S0282	yeah
S0288	paper
S0282	although the reason i won't buy munchies from the shop
S0282	be because they're always unwrap at the end so they've always be expose and you think mm who's be touch those so you have to be careful with things like
S0287	isn't that the same with
S0288	eat the eat the munchies
S0287	fruit gum and
S0288	i'm very fond of munchies
S0287	those sort of things
S0282	munchies be good
S0287	pastilles fruit pastilles with all the sugar on
S0288	i can't remember when i last have them
S0282	mm no then they take your fill out
S0287	well that's not the point though be it it's it's it's the tube shape with the foil on the end
S0282	well apparently apparently accord to it be twenty percent more efficient to have circular kitchen roll and they be quite neat you have this thing and it's sit there and you take the little lid off and you go oh and you pick your kitchen roll out and then you've get a circular kitchen roll
S0287	be they they're the paper ones that absorb liquid aren't they
S0282	they yes
S0287	those ones
S0282	yeah like kitchen roll like like er juan sheet no juan
S0287	so so instead of like a toilet roll where you've get a hole in the middle but it's much narrower presumably
S0282	yeah yeah it's about erm
S0287	well that's where the the space be save isn't it
S0282	it's probably about as big as that it's probably about as that palm of my hand
S0287	that's not very big
S0282	because it's cos it's up in a cone
S0287	so how big be they when you spread them out the palm of your hand
S0282	they're like that they're about that big
S0287	okay so be he go to make his millions out of this
S0282	well it be somebody he meet on the train from in the morning so somebody thank you very much there be somebody he meet on the train
S0282	who who have this idea and then he go to somebody else on the train who be a financier
S0282	and the and say to the financier will you fund the production of this so they get a factory to make it and they get it they get it in erm tesco's you have to go to tesco's though only tesco's have it
S0287	shouldn't er shouldn't he have go to harrods
S0282	well i go i go to tesco's
S0287	wouldn't it be better if he'd go to harrods
S0282	i go to tesco's specifically to buy these things i want to see what they be like and they're good they be good it's quite handy
S0287	well there you see if you'd go if you'd go to harrods you'd be spend twice as much on each one
S0282	i know
S0287	like that bloke with his chocolate
S0288	it's where he
S0282	well you need to yeah you need to have your margins and everything don't you but because it this be this be the high power carriage obviously on the way from to london in the morning because you've get you know you've get your financier
S0287	well you know i think there's an awful lot of business do on fag break you know
S0282	yes that's true
S0287	people people people spend fifteen or twenty minutes you know right i'll meet you outside at eleven o'clock and spend twenty minutes on a fag break while everybody else be still slog away do the bore stuff
S0282	yeah
S0287	and they're all have a discussion in private about how this be go to work and that be go to work and let's let's get this together and so on and so forth
S0282	when i be when i be a trainer you know you always you make friends outside with the other smokers so you've get
S0287	there's a it's a whole environment which be
S0282	yes
S0287	exclusive
S0282	so you have you know so you've get chums by the time you start your train session you've make some chums already and they're on your side cos you've have this illicit relationship with them outside on the step
S0287	yes i'm quite tempt before now to pretend that i'm a smoker so then i can go and
S0282	yeah
S0287	join with these things
S0288	join in
S0282	i'm sure they'd know of that
S0287	and yeah and not only that but you know you're the one who's leave behind at the desk slog away while they're all out there you know have a bite of a chinwag
S0282	yes that's true
S0287	you're do all the work and they're stand back outside
S0282	no but they're no but they be
S0287	network
S0282	they're slave their addiction
S0287	well they might be but actually in some case there be advantage to walk out of the office and stand around for twenty minutes chat to other people
S0282	mm
S0287	where nobody else have the authority or the er or the ball to do it
S0282	well i have erm
S0287	cos you wouldn't just go out to the corridor and stand for twenty minutes would you
S0282	no i mean i have a friend who be a civil servant who erm who i mean er she work at the department for and she be the first in the loop about everything because even the minister would go for a fag so she would be in the in the smoke room and so would the minister be or even the secretary of state and some really quite senior people so she get all kinds of gen about things that you know be way outside her pay grade through chat to people in the smoke room so definitely worth be a smoker sometimes
S0287	or hang out with them at least
S0282	yeah although these days it
S0287	depend whether you're passive passive smoke do you as much damage doesn't it
S0282	well yes probably probably and these days so so few people smoke actually it be you know the level of smoke have go down
S0287	i don't know i think there's a a surprise number of people still smoke actually i think
S0282	it depend what which age group you're in actually
S0288	yeah young people smoke like mad especially young girls
S0282	i know and they take drug and they drink think they know better but well i suppose that's be young really isn't it get more sensible as you get older
S0287	it depend what your opportunities be doesn't it you know those weren't opportunities when we be their age
S0282	well i don't know i do get worry because erm i be say to earlier that erm you know in our day spirit be really expensive so you didn't you didn't buy half a bottle of vodka erm drink half a bottle of vodka before you go out at night because it be prohibitively expensive and nowadays it seem that people do
S0287	oh yeah you get tank up first before you go out
S0282	yeah yeah
S0287	cos it's too expensive to drink out
S0282	yeah yeah somebody who work for me get into terrible trouble he go to a conference and he and he kind of regard himself as a man of the people and he be
S0282	and he fell in with this whole pile of women from liverpool
S0287	oh dear
S0282	who be community activists they be work class community activist women from liverpool who be erm kind of quite er ballsy women really
S0282	anyway erm they be at this conference and they be all in the residential block and they have bring their bottle of vodka with them in their luggage so they be they be drink in their bedroom this vodka and he turn up and try to sort of pal up with them and erm actually get too familiar with them and what do he do erm i can't remember i get an official complaint from them cos i think he call them i don't know what he call them he he he he say something he call them something they be drink and he be drink but they weren't so drink that they didn't notice that he be be rude to them and so they report him afterwards and he be like yeah but this be a term of endearment in scouse
S0282	when you're drink and it's just like well no they didn't actually find it very endear when you use this word slag or it be something like slag or something like that that he use and it's just like no that's perfectly fine
S0287	there be no circumstances under which that's endear
S0282	i can't what do he what do he call them i can't remember anyway he be indignant that they i mean they make a formal complaint against him so i have to investigate this formal complaint do you or do you not go to their bedroom at one o'clock in the morning and call them slag or
S0282	well yes i do but i think it be perfectly alright well no it actually wasn't perfectly alright cos they've now make a complaint against you and you be on duty and you be work for us
S0287	yes
S0282	and you can't just go to conferences and turn up in somebody's bedroom at one o'clock in the morning drink and accuse somebody of be a slag this be not right well no they think it be fine
S0282	i say no it's not it's you're work for us
S0287	it's not good under any circumstances let alone one o'clock in the morning
S0282	yes
S0287	or whether you've have a drink or not
S0282	then what be you do in their bedroom at one o'clock in the morning there might be six drunken scouse ladies in their bedroom at one o'clock in the morning in a conference block at a university but you shouldn't've be there with them should you you should've be in your bed
S0288	it's it's probably not a good
S0288	not a good
S0282	and
S0288	place to be unless you're a gay bloke
S0282	no
S0288	and then you might get away with it
S0282	mm he be just a nightmare that man honestly turn up on linkedin the other day it be like oh my god bar him immediately don't let him come anywhere near he wouldn't go away he be one of these people where you just think oh please god let him get another job he be always
S0282	every time you know he get into trouble
S0282	he would turn up to a meet and he'd say with a notebook he'd say right okay get his pen out put his pen above the page and say right okay fire away what have you get to say to me and so you go er well er nothing really
S0282	so
S0282	so and it be you know he be just like real kind of unionise

S0282	sort of shop stewardy sort of thing and erm he be around for age like please get let him get a new job let him get a new job let him go away and then erm he do get a new job hooray hooray and then i give him a reference and be like mm okay i have to make something up on this reference
S0282	so i give him this reference and then i meet somebody at a conference about eighteen months later say ah yes he's be a bite of a pain in the neck since he join us
S0282	and he's very very combative and when you sit down and try and talk to him about what you're suppose to be do he get his notebook out with his pencil and say right what have you get to say to me so like oh no he doesn't really do he really oh my word
S0282	mm be he like that work for you when he work for you
S0287	oh no
S0282	no perfectly alright absolute nightmare of a man dear me how many minutes have we do might have to listen to us chew for fifteen minutes so i can get my eighteen quid
S0287	we can see who make the most noise
S0282	yeah i know
S0288	who be the academics run it
S0282	sorry
S0288	who be the academics lead on it do you know
S0282	i don't know it's lancaster university
S0288	they've always be very strong linguistic
S0282	and erm cambridge university press so i presume it's a lot of linguists sit in the lab somewhere
S0288	mm
S0282	i don't know who's in charge of the project this sauce be really nice
S0287	what be it they're listen for
S0287	what's the point
S0282	i don't know erm i think it's about erm english language teach
S0282	and about erm idiom and
S0288	the corpus be a way of er of see what the current language really be
S0282	mm
S0288	and because computers can manage huge huge pile of data you can you can collect all of this stuff erm and just just see how people be talk or you you can analyse the whole range of different aspects of of language
S0282	mm
S0287	they've be do it with five hundred word actually haven't they the write competition the
S0282	oh right
S0287	the kiddies' write competition every year they actually do a bite of analysis on erm all the all the kids' stories and find out what be the theme that they're all write about and what's the most popular word and
S0288	mm
S0282	oh right okay
S0287	mum be up there most
S0282	oh really
S0287	yes
S0288	mm
S0282	oh really
S0287	oh yes
S0282	be it you who be tell me that somebody
S0282	i've write this story cos i've be tell to
S0287	yeah
S0282	my teacher make me do it but actually i don't care
S0287	yes definitely
S0282	so i'm sabotage it
S0287	they make me do it
S0288	mm mm you take the file and run it through a concordance then it'll tell you exactly what frequency of usage there be and you can
S0282	what frequency
S0288	mm
S0282	oh of word
S0288	or you can do it on individual word and
S0282	mm mm
S0288	you can do it on run of text as well so if you're look for expressions you can actually set it up to that as well
S0287	mm mm
S0288	and collocations a whole range of different things it'd be good
S0282	very interest
S0288	mm
S0282	but very scientific really

S0282	mm
S0287	well the computer do the tot up doesn't it but there's no there's no answer unless somebody's interpret it
S0282	mm
S0288	there's also stuff like where you actually you you you create your own structure to
S0282	mm
S0288	if you're look at a much more subjective approach to to to what the language be about you mark things up in in relation to your project and then you run it through the program and it'll pull it all out for you and tell you these be the positive things these be the negative things and work within the context of of your own appraisal of of the situation
S0282	mm
S0287	the other thing we need to do be chew loudly
S0282	mm
S0287	cos if you ever listen to the archers if they're at meals time they're all they're all do
S0282	ah
S0282	oh i hate that
S0287	and talk with their mouth full because obviously it's meal time you see
S0282	i so hate that it's like there's an actually way of do chew isn't there
S0287	yes
S0288	mm there must be learn it at drama school
S0282	yeah
S0287	we've get someone in the sound booth go do all sort of chop and scrap noise

S0288	i dunno
S0287	don't listen to radio four any more so can't help you with that one
S0282	oh right erm who's the main guy on radio four news humphrys

S0287	there be erm a one moment a few years when john humphrys be talk to some american non environmentalist
S0282	mm

S0288	shouldn't've say that
S0282	but then actually they should do that more often give people their own rope to do
S0288	mm
S0282	rather than just harangue them and harry them and whatever because actually you never hear the argument and all the stuff about europe everybody's go well i need to hear more so i can make my mind up you think well that we've be talk about this for like five years now have you really hear enough to know whether you want to
S0287	no but half of it's lie that's the trouble

S0282	what so you have to go over to the to the cubicle and
S0288	mm mm
S0282	ah so be it a erm an arab version of your name or a completely different name
S0288	a completely different name

S0282	have to put your leave shoe on first
S0288	put your right shoe on first step into the house with your right foot and out with your leave
S0282	oh really
S0288	mm
S0282	how excite so erm
S0288	the least of it
S0287	it's fuck pointless
S0288	oh yes
S0282	do you have lucky days or something or bad luck or good luck or
S0288	no no
S0282	or be it just respectful
S0288	mm sunni
S0282	erm so hang on a second i no i need to get to the bottom of this then so be this this be not an arab version of your name
S0282	so it's not a what your name would be if it be in arabic it's an alternative name that what you take when you become a muslim
S0288	no more complicate than that
S0282	oh
S0287	for the purpose of the tape
S0282	how excite but for the purpose of the tape that you're a native english speaker and that you be bring up in this country and that english be your first language
S0288	i'm from
S0282	cos otherwise it's not valid
S0288	mm
S0282	mm mm
S0288	their full name spring what it mean aviv in hebrew as in tel aviv mm mm spring hill make it less attractive
S0282	mm so do the hmrc know you're which name do hmrc know you're under
S0287	oh they they be very quick to click weren't they
S0282	have two two tax cod
S0288	no no cos i have one national insurance number so
S0282	ah
S0288	so there's no problem there
S0282	you only get half your pension though cos this other bloke will get have the other half
S0288	my pension's worth tuppence so don't really worry about that
S0288	i be i be abroad for twenty years so the chance of me get a pension worth look at
S0282	my pension's quite respectable actually and i i i there be no employer contribution to it it be just my own contribution but because it's so long ago that i start it
S0288	mm
S0282	it's actually turn out to be quite a respectable amount
S0287	well be say last night wasn't she
S0282	oh
S0287	she's gonna have to stop contribute to hers otherwise she's gonna be tax too much
S0282	yeah yeah
S0288	yes yeah yeah yeah
S0282	she's get over a million pound in her pension pot
S0288	so this be this be this be why my dean be be erm be retire this year because of the erm the the tax implications and he's sixty three
S0282	how extraordinary
S0287	god if only
S0288	and finish last year the same thing well he go down to point four and it's because of the new tax regulations it doesn't pay him
S0282	can't you just stop pay into your pension and carry on work
S0288	i oh no i don't know the complexities of it but i
S0282	i mean surely you could just stop contribute
S0288	erm
S0282	i mean if you've get er your own scheme if you're self employ
S0287	well well well presumably you don't be employ
S0288	i i i think it's to do with the with with tax liability in relation to the lump sum payment if you're in work or in full time work and it's something to do with that it's quite complex
S0282	mm it be that be quite sensible what be say about those workshops run by county council
S0287	mm
S0282	what's gonna happen to you when you're old what do you need to think about before you retire sort of thing it seem to make quite a lot of sense to do that for people
S0288	maybe i will
S0282	rather than just let them run into problems
S0287	i haven't haven't see any of those
S0288	what
S0282	no
S0288	county council things on
S0287	look after their employees no not a lot of that go on at the moment
S0282	be that cos she work for them
S0287	er she's work for the sixth form college until very recently
S0282	oh right she a teacher then
S0288	oh
S0287	er no no
S0282	lecturer
S0287	no
S0288	so she'll be on a council thing my my pension's a county council pension
S0282	oh
S0288	i've get two i've i've get three actually one of them's i think
S0282	mm
S0288	but erm
S0282	well you never know i mean if you leave them sit for a bite of time sometimes they do end up be worth something and that's what's happen to mine i stop contribute to mine
S0287	they surprise you don't they
S0282	years and years and years ago but because i start when i be twenty eight twenty seven twenty eight
S0288	mm
S0282	then it's be sit there for thirty years or something
S0288	well i need to get
S0282	so it's actually appreciate it all on its own without my attention really
S0288	mm yes they they will do well i need to get in touch with the british council pension people can't remember now government thing
S0282	mm
S0288	and then the other one's the uss which be the universities pension
S0282	mind you didn't dad get shaft through that
S0287	mm
S0282	when he retire they say to him that that they can deduct the state national pension off him or something
S0287	yes
S0282	how he miscalculate that god only know
S0287	well probably not his fault be it
S0288	mm
S0282	i don't know
S0287	well you don't really expect the man on the street to delve into these things and find out what's go on
S0288	no they're truly complex these pension
S0282	well i think you need to rely on your erm the employee representatives who be your trustees of your pension i think a lot of people go to sleep on the job a few years ago and didn't realise that i mean employers for example say oh let's have a pension because we're ahead in our fund
S0288	next
S0282	and they all say yeah that's fine and actually then they all fell behind and
S0288	massively
S0282	contributions weren't what they should've be so they they carry on kind of contribute through the good time they would've be able to weather the bad time
S0288	mm oh no
S0282	so i think there's probably quite a lot of charity er quite a lot of pension trustees that really ought to have be sue by the pensioners in their scheme for make really silly decisions in the eighties
S0288	well it be it be it be company take the piss it's the same as cut back on your train budget and those sort of things that's what they always do
S0282	mm
S0288	oh stop we'll we'll stop put into the pension pot cos things be go really well and erm
S0287	then iceland happen
S0288	yeah
S0282	well there be that isn't there
S0287	mm where you've put all your money fall over what's
S0282	theoretically i'm entitle to start draw down my pension
S0288	yeah one of my pension should've start six years ago
S0282	really
S0288	fifty five yeah
S0287	but when what happen why
S0288	but i be well it be worth tuppence so so i haven't get round to find out what's happen with it should do that at some point
S0287	that could be our weekly bottle of wine
S0288	i don't think so
S0287	not even that much eh
S0288	i doubt it
S0282	well people be complain about how if you want to get proper advice it just cost a huge amount of money cos anything free be just
S0282	self interest
S0288	no i i i come across some paperwork the other day so i need to fill in the form and send it off to them and say what be my options and they'll say we'll give you your cheque that's fine i credit card company

S0282	there be just so many of us

S0282	no
S0287	wasn't they do everything they could
S0282	yeah well no absolutely i feel i feel that they have their life chance be very much limit by the fact that they that they
S0287	have four children very quickly
S0282	they have four children very quickly they don't get on their feet really they couldn't get on their feet before they start have children and then they never they be on the back foot always after that really so anyway just in childhood
S0288	my father make quite a lot of money mend cars when he wasn't work my er i remember my mother get angry because she insist he never charge enough
S0282	ah she should've take over the bill then
S0288	mm
S0282	take you know she didn't think he charge enough she should've be his account department
S0288	yeah i think she just like moan she she's stabilise now though she's still slightly violent

S0288	ah well it's probably worse tell you when deal with the with the students in sudan there be erm physical violence be infinitely preferable to er have a go at them for
S0282	choose your poison really
S0288	mm mind you one of the teachers have a breakdown and jump on the desks run to the back of the room on the desks and kick somebody in the head which wasn't a good idea
S0282	ah
S0282	well you know strategically you know convince your pupils that you're a bite mad can often be helpful
S0282	use to do that when he be a teacher he use to try and persuade the kid in sort of session one or session two when he first meet them that he be a bite of a volatile and unpredictable sort of person and they really need to watch out
S0288	therefore they ought to be very careful
S0282	yeah very careful indeed woah what's gonna happen next sort of thing

S0282	use of these things really suppose to be able to use them for career purpose i haven't nobody's give me a nobody's offer me a job yet or anything like that
S0288	i've be headhunted a couple of time through linkedin
S0282	have you really
S0288	mm
S0282	how do you do that
S0288	well headhunters be lazy bugger so they just use linkedin
S0282	do they
S0288	mm
S0282	well i do get look at from time to time people'll think who the hell's that why be they look at me but nobody's ever offer me a job an interview or suggest i might go for
S0288	i've have oh i've have interview
S0282	have you
S0288	yeah yeah
S0282	oh my god i'm do something terribly wrong i need to have a look at my keywords or something i think probably
S0288	yes revisit your think i i need to bother to sort mine out as well
S0282	yeah no i know no i go to a seminar on job search and i be quite scandalise because in the sector that i work in charity sector it's so proper really really proper i mean i apply for a job
S0288	mm
S0282	that i could've do stand on my head really with cvs and it be a research job and it be just easy peasy and it be the kinda thing i do when i be about twenty five and i think oh that's brilliant part time job not very well pay but
S0288	mm
S0282	within eight miles of my home and i can do it stand on my head it's really easy so i apply for this job and then they write back to me and say i'm terribly sorry but erm we've just acquire some more fund so we're gonna make it into a full time job and the other half of the job will be apply for european fund so i think do you know what
S0282	the worst thing in the whole world be apply for european fund because
S0288	it be
S0282	the regimes for european fund be so appal
S0288	mm
S0282	really vile and you have to get the proper match fund and if it's not match fund for the right source you end up have to give the money back and you go bankrupt
S0288	no
S0282	and i've know people i know
S0282	one of my friends go to jail over not keep his european fund separate
S0282	so it's just such a absolute nightmare anybody like when say about the european union not be audit really
S0288	oh excuse me
S0282	quite frankly you know do not do not ever mess with european fund er as far as i'm concern
S0288	that's i can see
S0282	so then the so then cvs say to me well you have to apply again because we've now make the job full time so it's a different job so you have to apply again
S0288	reapply mm
S0282	and i say well i would want a job share cos i don't want the full time job i want a part time job so they say well you have to apply anyway and see if there's anybody else who want a jobshare and then we'll see if they want a jobshare in the end so i apply again and they interview me and i have to go through this ridiculous interview and then i have to do this test where i have to they give me an hour to write a fund application
S0288	oh i hate i the test
S0282	ah
S0288	ah
S0282	go through all of this and then they reject me because they say they say would you work part would you work full time if we give you the job and i say no i don't want a full time job i want a part time job and they say well what about if er you start and you start full time and then we try to find somebody to do jobshare with you
S0282	and i say no
S0288	no
S0282	no i no still no
S0282	so then they reject me
S0282	and it but it's so proper it's just like you know the whole process i have to go through and and all the pain and suffer they put me to for not to not give me the job because actually in the end there wasn't anybody suitable to do a jobshare with
S0282	and you just compare with your headhunters look at you on linkedin and just send you an email say would you like a job
S0288	oh dear yeah mm mm yeah always yeah
S0282	and the sector that i work in be just like so proper
S0282	you can't possibly can't possibly do this because
S0288	oh headhunters just
S0282	wouldn't be proper
S0288	just out to make money that's that's the problem
S0282	yeah well
