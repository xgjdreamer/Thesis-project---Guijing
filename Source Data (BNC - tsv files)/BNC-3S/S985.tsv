S0337	very expensive
S0346	i know the one the one in in
S0336	i always find chinese food be though it's the same with indian like because you buy things in like
S0346	cos you have to get side
S0336	mm
S0346	with the mains that's why it's easier when you've get a group cos then you can get like one rice because you don't need that much rice
S0337	i we always use to cook rice
S0336	unless you've get a
S0346	do you

S0346	mm my dad didn't
S0337	with peas in it as well
S0336	so if isn't an option where else cos obviously we're not we're not native locals
S0346	er the only one i know be which be one right near me it's really good
S0337	be a gourmet you have to eat there

S0336	yeah they'll all be restaurants as oppose to
S0337	yeah but takeaway's the only good chinese that i've hear recommend to me
S0336	mm
S0337	but but
S0336	the only other
S0337	chinese

S0336	but it be delicious so it warrant the name
S0346	oh nice
S0336	and actually it prove that you shouldn't be put off

S0346	yeah
S0337	just couldn't get them right
S0336	yeah i think indian be the
S0337	couldn't get them right
S0336	last one we actually
S0337	yeah
S0336	kind of
S0337	discover
S0346	we have a really nice
S0336	like find yeah
S0346	yeah we have a really nice curry place actually we'd always get curry for that reason we'd always
S0336	yeah
S0346	get like dhal because they be vegetarian so it be really cheap as well
S0336	oh see like when i when we first go to uni there wasn't really any like domino's around here or anything or certainly not near me in

S0336	chinese place
S0346	hardly ever get a takeaway

S0337	how to get there
S0346	cool
S0337	i have the same pizza place that i'd go to it be call and it be like stonebaked pizzas so it wasn't

S0346	you know the little tesco near me
S0336	yeah
S0346	there's a chinese restaurant there me and discover the other weekend they do takeout but what they do be at the weekend they have a buffet on and you basically come in you're give a pot and you just fill it up and it's like four pound fifty
S0337	what
S0336	that's interest
S0337	what
S0346	yeah that's their takeaway they don't do takeaway at the weekend cos they only do a buffet menu you can come in and take a pot and fill it up and then just pay for it
S0337	take your own pot
S0346	not your own pot they've get their own pot there sort of thing
S0337	fill with whatever you want
S0346	yeah fill with whatever you want although we discover that that's actually harder than you think you have to plan it because we end up put like saucy stuff in with like wontons and it's like then you get soggy wontons so need to do it have a starter as one and like a main and a rice and then a noodle cos otherwise you get
S0337	and you get three pot
S0346	otherwise you mix sauce and stuff and it get a bite
S0337	that's nut
S0346	so yeah

S0337	it's friday
S0346	friday
S0337	that's
S0346	the food be actually quite good but there wasn't a huge selection but i think er that's why it be quite good because they like instead of add what they want

S0346	the erm peking beef sound quite nice
S0337	which one's that oh chicken in black bean sauce do it have to be hot

S0336	it's three weeks
S0336	after mine and that's
S0346	it's gonna be really cold isn't it way colder than
S0336	well that's what annoy me this year most of the girls

S0346	i'm plan a really big event for
S0336	yeah
S0346	to come
S0336	most of the girls
S0346	mm
S0336	most of the girls bail on her birthday this year
S0336	and i make a point of go and like i'd go to a massive effort of like like sew her a cushion and all this kind of shit i just feel like i'm constantly go out of my way
S0346	yeah but place mat
S0337	they're clever
S0336	clever
S0337	reversible oh oh
S0346	see whatever you design her to go for in the live room they're suitable
S0336	i just think and she rub me up the wrong way the last time she come round by sort of like tell me on the morning that be come and then also
S0337	she always keep try to rub me up
S0346	yeah i would never tell you last minute be come anywhere
S0336	and it's
S0336	but like you know er
S0337	as long as he's not grumpy
S0346	yeah yes
S0336	i i perhaps er i probably would've be more annoy by that if we be cook though do you know what i mean
S0346	yeah it's and if you be cook i wouldn't have invite him
S0336	exactly
S0346	but cos i know get takeout i know no difference
S0336	whereas er she
S0337	oh yeah
S0346	whatsoever
S0336	she know we have to get
S0337	and we'd buy three chicken breast
S0336	we'd buy three chicken breast she
S0337	we didn't expect him to come
S0336	we didn't expect him to come and then like i'd also get the train that day to make sure that i be home a little bite earlier and then it turn out that she'd go home obviously cos be come but she tell me on the morning basically as i be get on the train i just think that's so selfish
S0346	that's really rude
S0336	and the last few time like she's do that she's also she just like she end up like belittle what happen to me so like when she move in with we we go round on the day she move in like with champagne and flower and stuff and make a big deal of it then we go round to her housewarming i've be round for dinner et cetera et cetera the first time she come round here be kind of out of pity cos she didn't wanna go off on holiday have not see it she text us on the day to say she be come
S0337	she texted me
S0336	yeah text you on the day
S0346	be that
S0337	texted me
S0336	literally run round the house for like ten minutes and then we be like well we've gotta go
S0337	yeah
S0336	because you've kind of invite yourself like unannounced kind of thing
S0337	we we be we be eat dinner at mum and dad's weren't we
S0336	yeah and i just think i just think it's so rude like everything's so like she's just not very thoughtful and everything's on her term and i just it's
S0346	i feel like she do everything because er she should do things
S0336	yeah
S0346	rather than actually because she
S0336	and it's also like you can kind of tell when you're in place of something like oh
S0346	well she's only do like she's so
S0336	i i could pop round tonight
S0346	much like which be
S0336	yeah i could pop round tonight if you want
S0336	oh you mean because whatever you have plan have fall through like oh
S0346	yeah 's like that like
S0336	great
S0346	hundred percent sort of you feel like you're just be squeeze into her busy schedule because she feel like
S0336	yeah
S0346	oh i need to spend time with now
S0336	and i feel
S0346	i'll do it
S0337	basically her
S0336	yeah
S0346	yeah
S0336	i also feel like she think she's get this excuse that because her and live all the way out in god forbid they come back into like of a weekend or anything like
S0346	but you guy live out in and you still saw me
S0336	mm
S0346	in
S0337	and we didn't see her
S0336	i dunno she's really shut herself off and like the thing be my like i don't know why but my group of friends seem to be a lot more tolerant of me kind of be a bite like out of the loop
S0337	cos you don't crave attention
S0346	yeah but you're not a dick at the same time you know what i mean you do your own thing then you do your own thing you're not you don't
S0336	yeah
S0346	do your own thing and then be a dick
S0336	she just
S0346	when you be there if that make sense
S0336	yeah i just don't get her like she i know she i know she's busy with work at the moment but all she seem to do be go home and stay in with every even during the week and he do stuff he go like he go to football and various other things
S0346	but that's the same with like cos wherever you saw like before she be pretty outgo and like sort of
S0336	quite independent
S0337	yeah she
S0336	et cetera et cetera
S0337	well i'd i'd say this to
S0336	nobody nobody see her anymore
S0337	yeah i say this to you know er you meet him
S0346	yeah i meet at your birthday
S0337	yeah erm and i be just like yeah it's just totally it's just not she's a totally different person it just it isn't her when she's with him
S0336	and that's
S0346	yeah i
S0336	that's probably what i'm more worry about say to her because i know she'd be quite hurt if she think like that we didn't like or er if we think that she be change she'd be more hurt by that than me just be a bite piss off that she's be a bite rude
S0337	yeah
S0336	and it's not like i'm gonna go out of my way to say it but you know like it's situations like that when you're
S0337	when you're drink and you
S0336	yeah
S0337	open your mouth
S0336	and it's also like you know when you're there it's quite an intense situation to be with your friends like all day for like two days it's just
S0346	yeah it's very bad to say something that really irritate you
S0336	exactly
S0346	rub you up the wrong way and then she'll say something else and then that will just be it
S0336	yeah
S0346	you won't be able to like bite your tongue anymore

S0337	do you see
S0337	that he text me about oh no it be to tell you he texted me about the tent

S0337	well i didn't reply to it but i go into work yesterday no sorry on wednesday and say oh yeah i'll get you the money for the the i'll get you money for a tent but obviously he's go on holiday so so whatever but i think i don't mind pay for it but he never pay he's just never pay for anything
S0346	he never like contribute to the group
S0336	no and that's the principle of it like i feel really i feel really petty now go back and say oh well you know that eight or nine pound that you owe me for like picnic that he never pay me can i have it back
S0337	think it be seven pound wasn't it it be something like that but
S0336	but do you know what i mean
S0337	but it feel
S0336	i feel petty do
S0337	pathetic yeah
S0336	it sound petty go back and do that now but if you add that on to all the other stuff of ours that he's just like kind of help himself to and not really think about
S0346	yeah and the same with like when he's come to mine and i've obviously put his food on and stuff
S0336	yeah
S0346	same principle
S0336	he just doesn't think about it do he
S0346	no not at all and like at bestival
S0337	breakfast breakfast stuff
S0336	yeah bestival be a joke
S0346	bestival be a joke consider and he be literally sit there eat his
S0337	with his tin
S0346	one tin and we be share like bag of food that we have between us because
S0337	the nibbly bits
S0336	yeah
S0346	yeah
S0336	not understand the concept of share
S0346	i'm just like yeah i don't get how in his head he doesn't see what he's do
S0336	yeah
S0346	like especially on the rib night when he be literally the only person to turn up empty hand
S0337	i know he'd eat
S0337	yeah
S0346	yeah but he still eat while he be there
S0337	and he eat
S0336	and he eat a fair bite in the end as well
S0346	yeah and
S0337	have we still get the rib
S0346	be the only person that turn up
S0336	yeah
S0346	empty hand
S0336	i think
S0346	although
S0336	i i be
S0346	turn up with stuff by default these days
S0337	yeah
S0336	it's
S0346	but just pay for it and i just do it
S0336	er yeah
S0337	do he pay you
S0346	huh
S0337	do he pay you
S0346	er we go to tesco's and he'll pay for stuff and then i'll like sort out whatever we're do
S0336	yeah
S0337	that's good cos he's kind of get away with that
S0346	yeah that's
S0337	whereas
S0346	be never bad but he use to bring weird things like fortune cookies to a dinner party
S0336	mm
S0337	that's pretty cool
S0346	yeah like he'd always just bring something weird like
S0337	bring a goat and stuff
S0346	yeah
S0336	yeah i my the only way i can think of get round that be every so often make sure that host and not give him anything
S0337	but what it's
S0336	or make a point next
S0337	it's totally different now
S0336	or make a point
S0337	it's gonna be different now
S0336	yeah
S0337	er he want to go all the way up to
S0336	yeah i know
S0337	christ
S0336	okay well then my i might have to start make a point of say bring this
S0346	or think big
S0336	come in
S0337	oh it might be be it the takeaway
S0346	oh yeah
S0336	oh that'll be
S0346	come in
S0337	i haven't get any money
S0336	come in some chinese man
S0336	oh it be you weird chinese man
S0337	you not a chinese man
S0337	oh where have you park by the way
S0336	yeah that be the most redundant peephole ever
S0346	why where be it
S0336	it's like there's obviously glass pan in the door and then the like
S0336	peephole be there there's no way you
S0346	to get a better look cos you can't even see through peepholes properly anyway
S0336	so no but whoever it be outside can see that you're look through the peephole
S0336	he's probably show him where to park across the way
S0346	oh right
S0336	he seem in better spirit already
S0346	yeah he'll be fine
S0336	maybe he's have time to like
S0346	i think he usually like
S0336	calm down
S0346	calm he's not grumpy erm that grumpy
S0336	it seem as well like his job's unfortunately of the nature where it's kind of like pot luck
S0346	sometimes he get the better bite sometimes he get the worser bite i think
S0336	he's go into a quieter period now isn't he i think over christmas it would be a bite
S0346	i think proper winter it do but at the moment there's plan for next season so and then he it's never as quiet as he think it's gonna be
S0336	yeah
S0346	but erm no i think it's quite nice that he phone me cos he be that's the only reason he phone me it's cos i don't know what to do what should i do
S0336	oh bless him
S0346	i be like well er er these be your options and like i know it's not exactly i know you want to go to but you can come round it's not as if you're do nothing
S0336	yeah
S0346	tonight he be like be i invite i be like invite
S0336	be this be this something that require an invitation
S0346	yeah i be like cos er cos he know we be do takeaways like it make absolutely no difference
S0336	yeah
S0337	if he's there or not so obviously if you be cook i would be like well i can ask but
S0336	i but that that's that's the other thing though like we could i'd i'd accommodate because we see
S0346	he's actually a friend
S0336	yeah we see each
S0346	whereas 's only
S0336	see each other so often exactly
S0346	yeah
S0336	and that's that's the thing she still treat me quite casually which i i wouldn't mind if i saw her all the time and she make load of effort for me and like
S0346	yeah
S0336	i wouldn't mind her just drop in whenever she want if she do drop in
S0346	yeah
S0336	but like to to drop to be so casual with me even though i only see her like once every few months be actually quite rude
S0346	yeah
S0336	it's like actually if i haven't see you for two months the least you can do be a proper time to see me
S0346	yeah rather than just
S0336	rather than just turn up
S0336	hello
S0346	hi
S0346	good
S0346	
S0336	i do i do
S0336	i do shout come in and then we think it would be really awkward if it be the chinese
S0337	or
S0336	yeah
S0337	hang around outside
S0336	for future reference you actually really don't need to knock and stuff
S0346	i know i'm get use to it
S0346	but i'm
S0337	we lock we lock up almost all the time
S0336	if er yeah but you
S0337	unless people that be come round
S0336	but check check

S0337	you sleep during the day and you you're awake during the night
S0346	she mind though i put her in
S0337	that mean you're nocturnal
S0346	i put her in a cardboard box
S0337	so you're always nocturnal

S0336	she's awake during the day though
S0346	yeah i make sure she's awake
S0337	yeah but it'll be dark
S0337	she's nocturnal
S0346	that's what's get me confuse well no she won't have that sort of like
S0336	yeah
S0346	erm
S0337	but my point be that she's a nocturnal animal so
S0346	she erm
S0337	she you you can't

S0337	she be
S0336	you could say that about owls doesn't mean they wanna be under fuck stairs all the time

S0346	on the way there
S0346	no she be in the cage in the car but like we put her in a shoebox cos i think it'd just would be a bite safer and she chew her way out and it be like
