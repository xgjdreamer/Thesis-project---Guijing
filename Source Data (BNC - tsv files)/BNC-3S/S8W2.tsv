S0669	yeah
S0669	we're er gonna be discuss two theories cos i want to hear your thoughts on like whether you think they're very accurate one of them be more about infants than erm actually they're both about like children
S0669	erm yeah so the first one be a theory by piaget have you hear of piaget
S0670	piaget
S0669	yeah
S0671	didn't he invent pasta
S0670	be he
S0670	really it's just
S0670	mine wasn't much better i be gonna come up with some joke about him be erm some concerto pianist
S0669	well piaget
S0671	sorry sorry
S0669	okay guy this be a serious discussion
S0671	sorry
S0669	so piaget erm oh
S0671	oh
S0670	nice pen
S0669	yeah great isn't it i just think it would help us if we discuss use this visual aid
S0670	yes
S0669	of the whiteboard
S0669	piaget okay so piaget be one of those like be one of those psychologists that's have really change the way we view children and how they develop in term of how they learn new things and how they think
S0671	okay
S0669	so
S0670	mm
S0669	piaget instead of like emphasise the parents' involvement he really believe that children be actively try to understand the world around them they're actively do their own learn and it's they're really independently explore and try to figure it out for themselves
S0670	yeah
S0669	and it's important as parent
S0671	mm
S0669	that we let them do that
S0670	yep
S0669	so he say there's two aspects of his model he say that when a child see something it so a child might see like a zebra and they've never see one before and they erm
S0670	really
S0669	do a process call accommodation i can't spell accommodation
S0669	so when they do accommodation they go hold on that's a new thing what be i gonna how be i gonna figure that out like what be that so they go oh i've see a horse before cos it have four legs and erm
S0671	oh okay
S0669	a similar head
S0670	so they'll look for similarities in whatever they've
S0669	so they look
S0670	come across
S0669	yes well do
S0671	oh come on
S0669	so that's what they're do
S0671	good good job
S0669	they're they
S0671	so they say horse
S0669	yeah so they they
S0670	good job
S0669	they look for like horse however when they're like compare it
S0670	but it can't find them cos it's separate
S0669	yeah
S0670	there's no horse
S0669	so the er
S0670	what do they do
S0669	stop it
S0669	so they go
S0669	er yeah
S0670	oh
S0669	shush you so then they go but horse don't have strip so they're in this state of disequilibrium
S0671	mm
S0669	equilibrium and erm
S0671	yes
S0669	and er they're go oh i'm not like this i can't figure it out and they start go okay this be a new thing and i'm gonna learn that so they go okay they have strip they must be different and they sort of seek they er explore eventually someone they hear that it's a zebra and when they hear and learn the term zebra they have whoop i've do it the wrong way round i'm very please we've discuss this
S0670	accommodation be the last thing isn't it
S0669	yes and assimilation
S0670	cos they're accommodate
S0669	be the first thing
S0671	oh assimilate
S0670	oh okay yeah
S0669	good thing that be in my note
S0670	cos things assimilate to other things
S0669	yeah
S0670	and they're accommodate in their head for a new
S0669	er yes
S0670	erm concept or object
S0669	indeed so this be a continuous process and this happen like all the time like whenever they're
S0671	okay
S0669	do a new thing so they're always like look for new things however piaget also think that we go through stag
S0670	need a hand there buddy
S0669	erm we go through stag which be discontinuous do anyone know what discontinuous mean
S0670	not continue
S0670	yes
S0669	another piece of chocolate
S0670	wahoo
S0669	erm yeah so infants i'm not gonna outline all the stag because you'll get bore but i want to see whether you could you could erm apply this to education but
S0670	okay
S0669	in brief every single age group of infants have different like stag that they can cope with in their think
S0670	yep
S0669	so from the age of nought to two
S0669	they go to the sensory motor
S0670	think it be an i
S0669	stage
S0669	yeah motor stage
S0671	be that things like like er hold stuff that feel different
S0669	yeah yeah sort of sort of yeah but
S0670	tactile stuff
S0669	basically yeah so the difference between like the sense and move and all this sort of things
S0670	hence
S0669	they
S0670	sensory motor
S0669	exactly
S0669	well do so
S0669	they in this stage they're really try to figure out cause and effect relationships
S0671	okay
S0670	oh okay
S0669	cause and effect relationships blah blah blah and erm a thing call object permanence so they when a when a pen disappear from view infants find it really difficult to believe that it still exist even though it's
S0671	oh okay
S0670	hence the classic game peek a boo when you hide your face it's that they
S0669	exactly
S0670	don't understand where you've go
S0669	they
S0671	ah
S0670	but i get your note so it's
S0669	mm exactly so that be a really good
S0669	application
S0670	yes
S0669	to real life
S0671	oh good grief
S0670	that's three nil
S0669	so erm give this give that children like need to be able to explore and they learn best when they explore independently and learn this stuff on their own how do you think we can teach children to do cause and effect relationships in real life
S0670	leave them alone to discover stuff like leave a baby next to a fire and wait for it to realise
S0670	that it can burn itself
S0670	i mean it's to be fair that be cause and effect
S0669	it be cause and effect if a little inhumane
S0670	i mean obviously you wouldn't do that that be call a joke cos
S0670	but it's the same concept
S0669	but if they be in day care
S0671	oh okay yeah yeah
S0669	what toy would you give them
S0671	probably things that
S0670	burn them
S0670	erm
S0671	well like things like you say earlier that feel different to each other so like
S0669	yeah
S0671	something that's smooth and then something that's
S0670	feel like ouch
S0670	i'm sorry
S0671	i dunno you'd try and get as much different as many different sense in there as you can
S0669	yeah
S0671	as many different things as you can as well it's and the come and go things you could have something that
S0669	well
S0670	so
S0669	one toy that you could use
S0670	would be that the shape one where you have the shape toy and then the box which have the hole in and
S0671	oh i think that's the next stage mate
S0670	oh be that a next stage
S0671	well i think that's the next stage
S0669	probably but the this stage
S0670	our teacher know so much
S0669	i don't know that
S0670	maybe it's
S0669	what you could use be toy that be squeaky toy so when they squeeze them
S0670	it create a noise
S0669	it create a noise so they
S0669	but they only learn that from squeeze it themselves if we be to squeeze that for them they wouldn't learn it probably
S0670	so that's motor and sensory work
S0671	oh yeah good
S0670	in in coherence because they're use motor skills
S0671	yeah
S0670	to squeeze something and then sensory
S0669	yeah
S0670	be there
S0671	okay
S0669	or like a button and it make a noise like music
S0671	okay okay cool
S0669	musical noise okay
S0671	or a jack in the box
S0669	a jack in the box yeah very good have a piece of chocolate
S0670	good job
S0670	i call this psychology be call positive reinforcement
S0669	so erm
S0671	you're really good at teach
S0670	mm
S0669	thank you
S0670	yeah
S0669	thank you very much
S0670	probably not the greatest students be we
S0671	well i'm not
S0671	no i reckon it's pretty both
S0669	erm
S0671	no ask me question
S0669	i'm just gonna seek my note just to check i've get the right order
S0671	can i ask a question about piaget
S0669	of course you can
S0670	mm
S0671	so his model be that children it's more to do with children
S0669	yeah it's all about the children
S0671	but the last stage would only you say
S0670	the cognitive
S0671	they only find out it's a zebra when someone tell them so if it's
S0669	wait wait
S0671	all the children then
S0670	oh yes that's a good question cos what if
S0671	be it literally
S0669	wait so
S0671	all down to the parent
S0670	what if no one
S0671	teach or else they're or else they're just stick in
S0669	that's so true
S0671	assimilation and
S0670	oh so would would
S0671	and
S0670	would it come a stage where a child would come to its own accommodation it would label an object as different and know it be different and give it another name
S0671	if there be just children a new language would develop to accommodate that
S0670	yes
S0669	mm
S0670	no it would wouldn't it
S0669	it be true though
S0671	so really the adults be only need to accommodate children into society so it's a societal
S0670	into the current society
S0671	into the culture
S0669	oh that's so interest
S0670	yeah
S0669	but do you think but if the parent if they're just hear it do you think that's still them they're still explore the world they're still just hear it or do you think
S0671	oh okay oh that's deep
S0670	quite mm
S0669	but i guess if the
S0671	oh that's true it's their job to like fit it together
S0669	yeah yeah
S0671	yeah yeah fair enough
S0670	yeah
S0671	fair fair okay
S0669	but i guess it be er it be true the parent someone else as an adult have to say it cos they
S0671	mm
S0669	can't read an infant can't read
S0671	no
S0669	so
S0670	so er here's a question that i've get be that you know on piaget so assimilation be the moment where an infant will realise something be different and identify it as different
S0669	yeah
S0670	it won't label it but it will realise oh that's not quite what i've see before at what stage do do this stop become a constant process because if an infant see a horse as a a picture of a horse
S0669	mm
S0670	and you teach it that's a horse it'll learn that's a horse
S0669	yeah
S0670	then if it see a horse in real life it'll again recognise that's a horse or recognise that from a photo at what stage do an object become different at what point would it begin to assimilate something different would it be a different colour to a horse would it have to be a completely different species or
S0669	yeah
S0671	yeah that's a good question
S0669	oh i guess obviously
S0671	you don't have to know the answer
S0669	the amount
S0670	no
S0669	of experience a child have have like be important
S0670	mm
S0671	oh that's true
S0669	there will be like much broader general categories like basic level as it's call oh no superordinate level categories so they'll like think it's really broad and they'll call quite a few things horse
S0670	yeah yeah yeah
S0669	but i think as they gain more experience
S0670	mm
S0669	they'll be like hang on a minute maybe that's not a horse or maybe that's a different horse and then they get their category level of specificness they it get more develop to subordinate categories
S0670	but they do i i assume baby understand that things be different because although if you teach like if you teach an infant that's a horse
S0669	mm
S0670	it might see a dog and say
S0669	exactly
S0670	little horse
S0669	yeah
S0670	but it would recognise for example a rock as not be a horse but if it didn't know what a rock be
S0669	so when
S0670	do it just understand that i know what that be i don't know what any of the other things be
S0669	it's more when children be younger
S0669	they're very much rely on their perception to make and their different like part of
S0671	reality
S0669	yeah the different part of things in order to make
S0670	okay
S0669	judgments so they're
S0670	mm
S0669	they're very simple it's like how many legs have it get and and like if it have legs or it doesn't have legs what colour be it it's very simple
S0671	mm
S0669	so i think in term of like a rock and a horse they know that they're different but a horse and a dog because of it they're so perceptual they're so rely on like
S0670	on basic structure
S0669	yeah
S0670	they identify things oh it's get four legs
S0669	yeah
S0670	therefore it be
S0669	okay
S0671	yeah that's cool
S0670	clever
S0671	nicely do
S0669	phew thank you very much okay i'll just do this stage because it'll be bore if you have to go through all of them erm preoperational be the next stage i think it's when they're when they're four and erm in this stage children be really egocentric
S0670	mm
S0669	erm
S0671	some of us never grow out of that one
S0669	erm
S0669	so for example
S0670	i'm great
S0669	it's just and they
S0670	i just know that
S0669	they find it really difficult to know that other people can't see what they're see so they erm so there's this task where there's two people either side of a table and there's load of mountains in the middle and there's like
S0670	a table
S0669	yeah
S0670	how big be this table
S0669	it's like a model
S0670	oh okay
S0669	so
S0671	and the children aren't very big so
S0669	so there's a tree on this side
S0669	and
S0669	a erm
S0670	just imagine a mountain range
S0670	and like literally in the centre of this thousand mile just a table
S0670	and kid on either side like where be we
S0671	sorry sorry
S0670	what be this monstrous test
S0670	all i can see be mountains a horse
S0670	horse
S0670	the table the table have four legs the table be a horse
S0669	oh erm anyway
S0670	be you cry
S0671	i i yes
S0671	sorry
S0669	anyway
S0669	the erm the children be sit either side of the table with a model of the mountains and the adult go what can you see and er this be the child
S0671	oh okay
S0670	that's a
S0669	and the adult
S0670	really large child and really small adult
S0669	so this be the child this be the adult erm so the adult go
S0669	what what can you do what what can what can you see erm from where you be and they say and the child go a tree and then the adult go
S0671	oh okay
S0669	okay erm what can i see and then they say a tree when really they can't see the tree
S0671	oh okay so they
S0669	and then they say and then he say erm the adult go now i can see a house erm can you see my house and they go yeah i dunno they're just really they're not
S0671	confuse by it
S0669	they get very confuse so
S0670	don't have erm an understand of a detach identity
S0669	very good very very good yeah like their self awareness erm
S0671	mm
S0669	awareness of others be very
S0670	so
S0670	i mean do it have to be a mountain range or could be like a divider in the middle
S0669	oh yeah yeah
S0670	oh just just check it wasn't like the items have to be relate but it's the physical barrier of
S0669	yeah
S0670	what they're see
S0671	and they can't see what
S0670	they understand everyone else to be see at the same time
S0669	it's like erm there's also a task where er it's call like false belief task and so when a child be they're give like a smartie box and they go here's a smartie box er here's a here's this thing what's inside it and they go smarties and then they go okay open the box and then they open it and there's pencil inside and they're like
S0670	that's awful
S0669	i know so then they go what's inside the box
S0670	why
S0669	and they go pencil and they're like what do you think be in the box and they're like pencil and then they go okay be gonna come along and look inside the box what will she think's in be in the box and they always and at this and at this sort of stage until they like succeed past here
S0671	the ego stage
S0669	they erm they'd be like will think pencil be in there cos they can't understand that think a different thing
S0670	oh okay
S0671	oh okay
S0669	so yeah
S0670	mm
S0669	so
S0669	there we go there's a bite of piaget i'm now gonna talk about another thing because if we talk about all the stag you're gonna get really bore
S0671	mm okay this be very interest
S0670	i think i think we're make our own interest from it at least
S0669	erm so this be this be erm crazy name come up fenbrenner
S0671	bronfenbrenner
S0669	yeah something like that model
S0671	bronfenbrenner
S0669	of relationships so this be very similar
S0670	this be gonna be fun
S0671	no this be really good actually
S0669	this this be like you er the sphere of influence that we do
S0671	okay oh cool okay
S0669	so here be the baby
S0671	be this still about child development
S0669	yeah
S0670	where's the baby
S0670	there's the baby
S0669	there's the baby and this model suggest that surround
S0670	
S0670	that smile it go all the way to one side
S0671	i think you should penalise him i think you
S0671	i think you should take away all those stickers
S0670	alright then teacher's pet
S0670	get an apple for as well
S0670	i polish it on my er on my on my school uniform trousers it's very shiny
S0669	so erm what this model suggest be that there be a microsystem
S0669	and inside the microsystem be your immediate family
S0671	mm
S0669	so like your parent and all this sort of stuff
S0670	and
S0669	and they
S0670	siblings perchance
S0669	yeah yeah so they they erm be really heavily influential on you but because they're so influential on your development it's actually bidirectional because they be actually influential on the immediate family as well
S0671	yep
S0669	so
S0671	so
S0669	for example
S0671	oh so the child be indirectly affect itself
S0669	yeah
S0671	by affect those around it
S0669	exactly so
S0670	all good gift around us
S0669	mm
S0670	send
S0669	so a bad marriage
S0670	from heaven above
S0669	a bad marriage can influence the child but a fussy baby can also create frictions in a marriage
S0671	wow
S0669	so
S0670	oh
S0669	and then vice versa just keep go
S0671	oh dear
S0669	so yeah so that's the main
S0669	principle
S0669	of the microsystem
S0671	mm
S0669	then there's the macrosystem or the my note macrosystem no you won't be able that's so small
S0671	bronfenbrenner
S0670	what's the general area i'm look for
S0669	bronfenbrenner
S0670	be that gonna be like er
S0671	it's the relationships model of
S0670	be that still on piaget's or be that
S0669	i think it's on the back oh you're not gonna find it
S0670	yes no i've get it
S0669	oh you've get it
S0670	bronfenbrenner's microsystem mesosystem
S0669	mesosystem okay
S0671	oh like mesomorph
S0669	okay
S0670	yes
S0669	so
S0670	nice
S0669	what's mesomorph
S0670	geology isn't it
S0671	sorry no carry on
S0669	oh so in this one it's more like the relationships between like the teacher and the parent and how that can influence the child so there's things like the school and the neighbourhood no that's not there so the teacher their relationship with the parent influential
S0670	be not all relationships to a degree erm bidirectional
S0669	interest you say that in what way
S0670	well i mean just for example in the mesosystem
S0669	yeah
S0670	erm if a child behave really badly in a class some teachers may be less incline to give it the attention they'd give to an otherwise behave child
S0669	that's true
S0670	probably not good teachers but teachers would do that some
S0669	yeah
S0670	at least
S0669	yeah it's true
S0670	which would affect the way the child develop and be teach
S0669	but do you think it's more the relationships in this layer that be affect the way the child be behave in the class
S0670	oh no definitely that's what affect it
S0669	yeah
S0671	what age be this child sorry
S0670	
S0669	erm that's another part of the thing it's like through time so
S0671	oh it's okay
S0669	whenever really
S0671	clever
S0669	so you can consider it that's a strength of the model that you can consider it at any point
S0671	okay
S0671	that's cool
S0669	so erm yeah then there's the exosystem now this be erm something more indirect effect on the child so erm like the parents' workplace so if the mum have a bad day at work that can have
S0669	a way on the way they act at home and hence influence the child
S0671	okay yep
S0670	mm
S0669	do that make sense
S0670	yeah
S0669	so could you think of any other ways erm any other indirect so there's like neighbourhood or maybe church or religion
S0670	oh oh oh
S0669	very good
S0671	don't
S0670	yes chocolate for me
S0671	how about the weather
S0669	the weather it it be true that could affect it
S0669	it's true
S0671	or other external circumstances not to do with people
S0670	well do sherlock
S0669	what sort of things
S0671	well
S0671	well i dunno like like er
S0670	how much things will affect it
S0671	no no it's a serious point like erm
S0671	like the er
S0671	i dunno think about people er i dunno other situations like storm or
S0671	freak weather condition
S0670	hurricanes
S0671	yeah
S0671	no i dunno i dunno
S0671	financial situation of the family
S0669	yeah yeah that's true finance how do you
S0669	what about church how do you think that will influence things indirectly
S0670	well it introduce a child to a new social circle doesn't it a new set of people
S0669	true and do you think
S0670	as well as of course the whole theological impact on a child
S0669	mm
S0670	spiritual
S0669	very interest
S0670	which have a deep impact psychologically i assume especially from a young age
S0671	mm
S0670	and yeah horse and other four legged things
S0669	mm
S0670	they have a deep impact on children i've learn
S0671	what would you say
S0669	erm i would say indirect effect erm i guess oh gosh i've give all my examples away
S0669	erm indirect effect i guess oh grandparents like ill grandparents
S0671	that's
S0669	like could impact the mum they don't live er nearby i dunno quite stressful
S0671	what about move house
S0669	move house yeah so that sort of
S0671	could impact their live
S0669	so yeah
S0670	would erm geographical location also make an impact if you live in a
S0669	yeah neighbourhood yeah
S0670	er in a
S0671	yeah
S0670	more dangerous area like it be really icy all the time and people keep slip over
S0670	and break their hips that could have an impact
S0669	well do you remember
S0669	this model be about relationships
S0671	oh yeah do you forget
S0670	yeah well
S0671	you forget that didn't you
S0670	no i didn't forget that
S0671	yeah you do
S0670	if i be a father and i fell and break my hip
S0671	you just
S0670	and my child be whine when i come home i'd be less incline to be quite so nice with the child
S0669	you be correct in part though because neighbourhood if it's er there's quite aggressive criminal
S0670	oh
S0669	oh dear
S0669	that's not good
S0671	aggressive criminal
S0670	but i i wasn't actually look i be just
S0671	throw
S0669	so yeah
S0669	do you think
S0669	okay here's a question
S0671	okay
S0669	erm there's also another layer but it's not that important
S0670	what the macro
S0669	cultural yeah
S0671	oh
S0669	it's your value so like culture and erm
S0670	polite cos you're british
S0669	so how do you what do you think a child who live a child who what do you think be fit for a royal baby how do you think their relationships would be affect
S0671	i dunno cos i
S0670	i be not a royal baby i have i haven't
S0671	i haven't have that experience
S0670	i haven't meet any royal baby so
S0671	what i'm gonna guess be
S0669	yeah what would you guess
S0671	my guess be
S0670	they'd have more of a penchant for classical music
S0670	i assume
S0670	erm they probably get out less
S0671	maybe the you're you may have different people who be in the micro circle like nannies
S0670	mm
S0671	and et cetera
S0669	yeah
S0670	yes
S0669	that's true
S0670	mm
S0669	how do you think that would affect a child
S0671	erm i think if there's still ample contact with the immediate family as in like still contact with mum and dad what you'd have be you'd probably have different strand then go out you'd have the nanny's mum and dad and how that affect
S0669	true true
S0671	so there'd be those different force go
S0670	mm in my it cos er it's possible unless there be ample contact with parent be it could cause erm disachment from the actual family and that can create issue
S0669	mm
S0670	with children erm angsty issue
S0669	yeah definitely i be think erm yesterday about how a board environment
S0671	yeah yeah
S0670	mm
S0669	like really make
S0671	what do you think that happen in that
S0669	well i actually look up some research they they have like it's so different to a child who's go to a day school because you're so you've get one socialisation set so
S0671	yeah
S0669	your teachers be all here like your peer be very much here
S0671	especially in a small school
S0669	yeah so erm it's just different but they actually i be expect all the research to be like they're mess up people like they i dunno with their parent but they actually say that it's quite good because the teachers be train to support your emotional need
S0671	yeah
S0669	so
S0671	so
S0669	you actually the effect
S0670	mm
S0669	aren't as negative as you could think
