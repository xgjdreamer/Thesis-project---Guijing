S0653	okay so you be gonna tell me about what you learn about recycle
S0654	i learn that some bite that er the first piece of plastic ever make be still alive today and that plastic cannot rot put it in the bin it's still there it's not go and erm do you know what
S0653	mm
S0654	there's so much plastic that in the sea which er and it could circle the earth four time
S0653	mm
S0654	and if it go outside and i think don't think people be take care then because i cos er today i see load of wrappers everywhere
S0653	we do spot some rubbish didn't we on the way back from school
S0654	yeah and do you know what
S0653	what
S0654	animals can die of plastic
S0653	how can they die from plastic
S0654	cos like if they've get a sharp bite of plastic or and it's fray come up and get hurt
S0653	mm
S0655	oh
S0653	yes
S0655	mm erm er maybe last year or the year before at some point people find a dead whale on the beach and they or dolphin and they want to know why it be dead erm so they look inside it
S0653	mm
S0655	and there be like a huge load of rubbish inside it
S0653	oh no really
S0655	yeah it be swim in the sea and it and it get all of it in its mouth and it die because of that so some er so some people have just be chuck their rubbish in the sea
S0653	well sometimes it end up in the sea
S0655	yeah well they haven't be put it away
S0653	but where do it go cos you go to see where it rubbish go didn't you last year
S0655	what on a school trip
S0653	mm
S0655	nope
S0653	you do
S0655	i might've but i don't remember it
S0653	do you guy know where the rubbish go when it's collect
S0655	yeah they go underground
S0653	it not really it go to a big landfill site
S0655	yeah where they bury it
S0653	they don't bury it it's just there so
S0653	you know we have three different bin what be the three different bin for
S0654	they're for food
S0655	recycle
S0654	and and erm
S0653	and general waste
S0655	yeah
S0654	general waste
S0655	non recyclable but not food
S0653	yeah
S0654	yeah mm mum
S0653	and that's what go to the landfill
S0654	yeah
S0653	mm
S0654	and i think every bite of plastic we have like that container we recycle
S0653	we do although i think you can't recycle erm plastic if er if meat have be on it even if you wash it i can't remember
S0655	but i know a great way to get rid of plastic
S0653	mm
S0655	dig down quite deep find some lava pour it on the plastic and it sizzle away
S0653	well that be a good theory actually perhaps we could all put stuff into a volcano
S0654	mum
S0655	no not into a volcano
S0653	i'm be serious
S0655	because er when it because if the volcano be like able to erupt
S0653	mm
S0655	then it might erupt and there will bits of plastic still leave in the lava
S0653	no no it would it would burn but how do you think you can get to the lava without the lava come up to us
S0655	mm
S0653	you see
S0655	exact time
S0653	it's pretty well it's pretty dangerous isn't it
S0654	yeah
S0655	some people have be near volcanoes lava be generally travel slow slowly so
S0653	no no that's a good idea i think we could drop stuff into the volcano
S0655	unless the volcano do a gigantic spit eruption which it where it go kaboom then you'd probably be safe
S0654	mum don't
S0653	why not
S0654	because mum some volcanoes be know to hold treasure in
S0653	know to hold treasure be they
S0655	no they're not you just watch tom and jerry
S0654	no i didn't
S0654	no some no i've hear that some volcanoes be so special that nobody put anything in
S0653	i don't think i've ever hear that
S0654	well i've hear it
S0655	well i'm just go to ask a volcano expert about that
S0653	we do use to burn rubbish but then we realise that the burn be very bad for the environment yeah cos of carbon monoxide and things but if a volcano be already burn i think that yeah
S0655	for the air mm maybe if we dig a tunnel through the centre of the earth
S0653	maybe if you do dig a tunnel to the centre of the earth
S0655	if we dig a tunnel to the centre of the earth
S0653	mm
S0655	like really near to it
S0653	mm
S0655	like close enough for us to drop it it's close enough for us to see the all the lava inside it or just to find some lava underground mm and then
S0653	mm
S0655	they could drop the rubbish in and it would either sizzle away or explode
S0653	i think that would make for a very unstable tunnel though and it
S0655	what do you mean
S0653	because of the heat and do you know the gravitational pull it do pull things into the centre of the earth so if we get too near people be dig they'd just get suck into that bite
S0655	mm they we would turn rubbish alive and it would dig inside
S0653	well how's that gonna happen
S0655	cos they would go whee
S0653	i think it's a kind of quite a a dangerous option but we do recycle our recycle bin have get paper and glass and plastic in it so that be recycle
S0654	yeah the ketchup bottle for something
S0653	i don't want us to start recycle things because er well however we be go to keep this ketchup bottle because we're go to do that pancake recipe where you can do do two different type of pancake mixture so
S0654	hey
S0653	i guess we'll be reuse it that way mm
S0654	we'd erm soon we might need to get my a container for the
S0653	for the forest for what
S0654	might need to get a container for
S0653	for forest school what do you need a container for
S0654	you know the small container for drink
S0653	you just need a carton or a bottle but
S0654	mm

S0653	so it'll be you next half term or the last half term of school
