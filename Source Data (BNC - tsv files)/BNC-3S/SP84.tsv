S0485	i i well i talk for a live but i when it come to just talk ad lib it's rather difficult
S0432	mm
S0485	i've just be i've just be say to your colleague erm i've do a a cruise round the mediterranean about two or three time in a row
S0432	oh wow
S0485	erm cos i i'm a guest lecturer on the ship
S0432	oh wow
S0428	oh great what a fantastic job
S0485	yeah well somebody have to do it and it the only problem be the eat and drink really that's the
S0428	be the food very good
S0485	i'm afraid it be yes
S0428	too good
S0485	and so be the so be the wine
S0485	so that
S0428	and do you give lecture on archaeology
S0485	yes because we're the the group be go to see archaeological sit
S0428	mm
S0485	er through the greek islands and then up the turkish mainland and er so i talk to them about the sit they're go to see about the background of them and the history and so on before they see them
S0432	oh wow
S0485	and that way they get to understand the
S0432	yeah
S0485	er last week i be in troyer and er troy be an archaeologist's site it's not really a visitor site
S0428	mm
S0485	er archaeologically everything be there but it's in it's in display in such a way unless you understand it first you don't grasp what the site's all about it's get three thousand years just one layer on top of another er and you can't see it but i get everybody to understand what they be about to see
S0432	mm
S0485	and i say you go from here to there and there you know get through the site that way round it go all the way back to the early bronze age
S0432	wow
S0485	well
S0428	and what can you see like what what what's visually be there to see there
S0485	it's it's an it the main part of troy be a bronze age site so it's er from about three thousand two hundred to about twelve hundred bc
S0428	mm
S0485	so the earliest be about five thousand years old and these sit in the in the east mediterranean middle east all develop in the same way they're er what they call tell or tepes or in in turkish which be erm a mound which contain many periods
S0432	okay
S0485	if you imagine you start off in a small village you put stone out as a foundation and you build a house and the house be build of sun dry mud brick
S0432	mm
S0485	so you make a mud brick by the water
S0432	yeah
S0485	the sun dry it you then take it to to where you're go to build the house and you build several house and you make the roof say with thatch
S0432	mm
S0485	at a particular point in time in the middle of the winter you've get a spark hit the thatch the whole thing burn down so you're go build another village so you go back to the water make more bricks take them to the site put the stone out build the bricks put the thatch on top if you do this for several thousand years you actually get layer upon layer
S0428	of like mud from different place be take to another place
S0485	yes
S0428	if that make sense that's amaze
S0432	oh
S0485	that's and there be thousands and thousands of these sit all all over the east mediterranean
S0428	that's fascinate
S0432	and you can see all the the layer
S0485	well the archaeologically the trick be when you excavate them be to separate those layer out
S0432	oh wow
S0485	er because you've get to you've get excavate each one separately
S0432	yeah yeah
S0485	discretely
S0428	and do you find things in the layer
S0485	yes
S0428	of maybe i don't know kind of tool or
S0485	yeah you can well tool you find but particularly in the bronze age pottery
S0432	yeah
S0428	ah
S0485	because and pottery change with every generation i mean you've only get to look at the pottery your grandparents use for example to see it's different to the to the kind of cup you drink with now
S0432	mm
S0485	er the the ware itself change the manufacture change the shape change the decoration change and the use change
S0428	that's incredible
S0485	and so we use you can use it as a push pull arrangement when you excavate the site you actually can separate you have to separate out the layer in any give layer you have a time capsule relate to that that particular period don't you
S0432	yeah right
S0428	so you can tell what when when you get the layer you can tell exactly well not exactly the date but you can date the
S0485	there be some extremely tedious people who spend their whole work life just compare different
S0428	layer
S0485	different style of pottery from different periods and i know this i know they're tedious cos i be one of them
S0485	erm and you say well this site we can date to that period and have this kind of pottery so if you find this kind of pottery at that site it's go to be about the same period
S0432	yeah
S0485	do you see
S0432	yeah
S0428	yeah
S0485	so it's know as ceramic typology
S0428	ceramic typology
S0432	ceramic typology
S0485	it have a fancy name and the what you be try to achieve to get your ceramic typology be stratigraphic analysis so the analysis of the different strata
S0432	yeah
S0485	different layer layer upon layer see what i mean
S0428	yeah yeah
S0485	so in troy there be basically nine layer of the site
S0428	yeah
S0485	from early bronze age through to roman erm but the main
S0428	so what sorry what what years be the the i'm really bad at
S0485	the bronze bronze bronze age be the neolithic
S0428	yeah
S0485	which be the new stone age be the begin of agriculture begin of erm village build city build the whole thing er predate troy it's it's from about ten thousand years ago to about er five thousand years ago you then start with move into the bronze age where bronze replace stone
S0428	mm
S0485	as a but i mean you get all sort of other change as well and that last for about two thousand years to about twelve hundred bc and then you come into the iron age and hopefully by then you've get some kind of write so you move from prehistory to history
S0428	mm
S0485	but before history everything be an archaeological artefact
S0432	yeah
S0485	of itself you've create that by analyse the site
S0428	wow that's absolutely fascinate
S0485	well that's how it's do and it's it's the british that actually invent this system of dissect these these tell it be er do do the name mortimer wheeler mean anything to you
S0432	no
S0485	oh no he be the first person to popularise archaeology on television
S0432	oh oh
S0485	steam drive black and white television in those days and er another lady call kathleen kenyon who be the daughter of sir frederic kenyon the director of the british museum and so it's often know as the wheeler kenyon method of excavate where you have to you cut it if you imagine you've you've have black forest gateau haven't you
S0428	mm oh okay yes
S0432	yes
S0485	and you know it's actually a layer of sponge a layer of cream a layer of cherries a layer of whatever
S0432	yeah
S0485	you imagine that be what your tell look like and it can cover thirteen hectares say so a big site
S0432	yeah
S0485	you have to cut into this and determine those different layer
S0428	and how thick be a layer i mean
S0485	it vary
S0428	oh it vary but
S0485	it vary because as you get as the site get bigger and more important they might even defend it with mud brick wall
S0428	yeah
S0432	mm
S0485	which mean you get even greater preservation of the material inside the site er usually on balance you're look at about erm of let's say one storey build about a quarter to a third remain just the bottom
S0432	yeah yeah oh wow
S0428	oh that's a lot i be
S0432	that's more than i be think
S0428	i be i don't now why i be imagine something
S0432	yeah
S0428	yeah
S0485	and the well if you go back into early prehistory
S0432	mm
S0485	the stone age er the there be sit that i've excavate where they're only a few millimetres thick
S0432	oh right yeah
S0485	because there there'll be a stop point for a hunter gatherer group you know for just a few days and then they move on so they
S0432	mm yeah
S0485	but if you're deal with an urban site you know you're deal with a fairly major occupation and that's how it work that's be know as stratigraphy
S0432	mm
S0428	i've never ever hear of hear of it but i mean it make sense that you would you would do it that way but
S0485	yeah well because but unless you cut it like so the section you cut it in usually it's either two three of four metre square
S0432	yeah
S0485	and you control the analysis of the different layer by refer to the section on the all the four side
S0428	mm
S0432	oh okay
S0485	to see exactly where you be because curiously enough all er occupational debris will leave its own fingerprint for some reason or other erm either through the way it be destroy er or through any erm alterations be if it be abandon for a a few decades you'll get mid brick wash over the site and you you the the trick be technically to to define those differences as you excavate so you scrape away at it and you look at the textural differences between one layer and the next
S0428	how how do you get into archaeology
S0432	wow
S0485	ah that's a different question
S0428	no it's it's fascinate it it's something that i find
S0432	yeah yeah
S0428	really interest but i've never come across
S0432	my sister always want to do it but she just never do and she still regret it now she's like i should have go into it
S0485	well the first the first thing to say and i i you know i i'm pretty long in the tooth now but you don't go into archaeology if you want to make any money
S0432	no
S0485	because it's it's not really a way of make money it's a way of life
S0432	yeah
S0485	to me it be anyway
S0432	yeah
S0485	i be totally and absolutely absorb by it and have be since i start but i didn't want to do archaeology i didn't didn't think about it i actually want to be a geologist
S0432	ah
S0428	ah
S0485	which be why i get those specimens there which be in themselves totally interest but in a totally different way
S0432	mm oh yeah yeah they're very pretty
S0485	right so er i want to be a geologist and that's why i do middle east ancient middle eastern languages
S0428	and where where do you do that be that
S0432	oh yeah
S0485	what what
S0428	that make sense
S0485	do that make sense
S0428	be that here or
S0485	no i i er erm er er from london university of
S0428	wow so which so which
S0432	so then you get from the languages to the
S0485	oh i mean
S0432	geology
S0428	we're both language graduate so maybe we'll go in to
S0432	yeah
S0485	er east semitic akkadian which be from mesopotamia it's the first that's one of the first languages ever write down
S0432	er
S0428	oh wow
S0485	er five thousand years ago
S0428	wow
S0485	in cuneiform er aramaic canaanite classical hebrew classical arabic
S0428	load of languages
S0432	wow
S0485	oh yeah i be that
S0432	that's amaze
S0485	and i i be the only student in four years
S0428	oh how do you choose that course
S0432	and they still
S0485	well i i didn't really somebody say that's why you should do you should do that so i say oh alright then
S0428	okay
S0428	give it a go
S0485	but when i when i finish erm i didn't know what to do so i go to the career advisory service and they say what be you best at and i say well translate tenth century bc canaanite inscriptions and they say we don't think there's a lot of call for that at the minute
S0432	yeah
S0485	and and they be right er and this chap interview me and say but but you want to be a geologist do you do any field work and i say i all my teenage life when all my friend be run after girls i be run after rock
S0485	cos i could understand those better than i could understand
S0428	there you be
S0485	so so that's what i do and he say you should combine your field work interest with you ancient languages and become a middle eastern archaeologist
S0428	there you go
S0485	so i say alright then i will
S0485	and he say i know just the place to go and it be the institute of archaeology in
S0428	wow
S0485	er which be then and still be the foremost archaeological research institute in europe
S0428	oh wow
S0485	and i be there er man and boy for a good few years erm i finish my doctorate there and then er teach there and so on
S0428	and that's that's lovely that now you're you're able to travel be in those wonderful place use your your skill and use your passion as a way of communicate to everyone who you know
S0485	yes
S0432	yeah yeah
S0485	well
S0428	what a what an ideal job yeah
S0432	and still be there in the
S0428	yeah
S0485	yeah it be i suppose it be you could say that
S0428	mm
S0432	so do you do tour of these place of be you just do you just do the lecture
S0485	there we be
S0432	do you do you erm lead the tour or just
S0485	not only i i do lead tour we also organise other tour and er the temple world actually create see it say
S0432	yeah yeah
S0485	incorporate ima travel under ima travel we actually set up the alumni programme travel programme for
S0432	oh
S0485	in nineteen ninety two it be actually a colleague of mine who do it and i take over from him
S0428	so it it be they be they trip for alumni
S0485	they be that's that's all we do and alumni
S0432	oh just purely the
S0485	yeah and some some from the state as well
S0432	oh wow
S0485	erm we're look
S0432	oh yeah
S0485	yeah we're look at the possibility of expand the and programme to combine with one or two of the universities in the state like harvard and unfortunately i have to go out to greece again next week
S0432	oh no
S0428	do you want us to go instead
S0485	no
S0432	we can come down
S0428	now we know all about it
S0432	do you need do you need some help
S0485	well i'd love you to but unfortunately they they're expect me to be there cos i'm go to lecture on yet another ship erm to to show these alumni organisers what it's all about
S0432	oh just have to put up with it won't you
S0485	so that's what i do so what do you do
S0432	oh dear
S0428	well it's not nearly a excite we work at press in the language and pedagogy research team and we work on the language side of that so we both we both study languages as uni erm
S0485	what languages do you study
S0428	i do spanish and italian
S0432	i do spanish and chinese
S0485	chinese yeah that's that's er er and how do you enjoy that
S0432	it be at at first i be question why i decide to do it but it be actually really really really interest really it wasn't as hard as i think it would be to learn it be yeah i'm glad i do it i'm definitely i'm definitely go to carry on
S0485	well yes i mean i i do like every schoolboy do french and so on but the language i think in if i have to think in a foreign language be turkish
S0432	oh
S0428	oh really
S0485	yes cos i've spend a lot a lot of time in turkey
S0432	mm
S0428	i be say my mum grow up in istanbul earlier
S0485	right
S0428	yeah its but she doesn't she doesn't speak any turkish
S0432	do she not no
S0485	it's it's a beautiful language it's it erm well i think it's beautiful it's it's from mongolia
S0428	be it
S0432	oh
S0485	it have more akin to korean than it do to anything in european
S0432	i didn't know that
S0428	that's fascinate
S0432	i do not know that
S0428	i have
S0485	yeah it's an agglutinative language you can stick bits together and make new word and it have suffix and prefix and infix
S0432	oh
S0485	the negative of a verb be actually an infix in the centre of the verb
S0432	wow
S0485	so you'd say erm i be come or i be not come
S0432	oh
S0485	so the m in the middle be
S0432	so you've get to be really pay attention when you speak
S0428	yeah
S0485	yeah you do yes
S0428	you can't you can't miss the word there's no not
S0485	yeah
S0432	wow that's interest
S0428	so we we we work on on look at english and how english be change and kind of take a descriptive view and that feed that into the english language publish that press create and at the moment we're collect erm the british national corpus
S0485	yeah right
S0428	so twenty years ago they collect i don't know if you do you have you hear of the british national corpus
S0485	no i'm afraid i haven't
S0428	erm so twenty years ago they collect a hundred million word of write and speak english and i think it be ten million speak so they record conversations like this and they just transcribe them all and it's a freely available source on the internet that you can search and they collect yes erm the write as well and we're basically erm with university update this resource for the twenty tens
S0485	with university
S0428	we do it with
S0432	yeah yeah
S0485	how fascinate
S0432	yeah
S0428	they're kind of world leaders so the it's call corpus linguistics and they're like the they're just brilliant they've get such great resources and people out there it's really good
S0432	yeah yeah
S0485	why how do they get involve with that
S0428	we're what with or
S0485	yeah no well how do get involve in the first place
S0432	not sure
S0428	it's a it's a branch of linguistics that that kind of since the sixties fifties sixties have be grow and and become
S0432	mm
S0428	we erm we can show you how it work so it's erm press have in the corpus that we have we have two billion word that's be collect for about twenty five years and we also collect learner data
S0432	yes
S0428	so we can search for example they they get all the exam script from university exams from spain all all round the world and then we can find like the top ten errors for example of spanish speakers at a particular level er and then we can use this to fee back into the publish
S0485	right
S0428	so we work
S0432	and we can show them examples erm of how english speakers use the language so we can teach them up to date stuff so we won't teach the it's rain cat and dog for example cos no one say that any more
S0485	do do you no oh they don't
S0432	apparently not not like we use to
S0485	but erm do do you concentrate on pronunciation at all or be it only on
S0428	mm
S0485	individual word
S0432	yeah we just just on word and grammar structure and it's
S0428	yeah
S0485	because i i er erm i'm currently work on linear b which be a language be find in crete but it actually be from it's a middle bronze age language from or a bronze age language from mainland greece from the peloponnese and it's the earliest form of write indo european er write by the mycenaean's and unbelievably i be do this the other day and i find example in this of rhotacisms now you will have come across rhotacism won't you
S0428	rhotacism
S0485	it's the inability of a speaker to distinguish between l and r
S0432	oh okay yeah
S0428	oh okay just didn't know the word yes
S0432	yep yeah
S0428	yeah yeah
S0485	well it's call rhotacism and you actually get this in linear b
S0432	oh
S0485	you know four thousand years ago three thousand years ago
S0428	wow
S0485	isn't that amaze
S0432	yeah that be
S0485	where they they actually miswrite or mishear the
S0428	the r and the l
S0485	the r and the l
S0432	yeah
S0428	that's fascinate
S0432	that be
S0485	yeah
S0428	yeah we'd have to
S0432	yeah
S0485	no i'm i'm i'm in in i'm really interest obviously in languages cos that's where i come from
S0432	yeah
S0485	erm and wherever i've work i've learn the language concern
S0432	yeah there's someone in our team actually she's erm she do the pedagogy research but her background's in pronunciation
S0485	yeah
S0432	so it would be it be fascinate to include that but we there be you do have to kind of ignore some bits and just concentrate on others and
S0485	well the other thing on on on the ship that i be teach on i be talk to the barman he he be from the philippines and he like to learn different languages you know wherever he happen to be so i be teach him about greek and particularly turkish so he would get up in the morning and i'd say which be good morning er and he he start in a er now the ship be go to be go to the er erm n the in the spring and it's go round southern africa
S0432	yeah
S0428	oh wow
S0485	and i actually work in southern africa for about twenty years so
S0432	oh wow
S0428	oh wow
S0485	so i've be teach him zulu cos i learn zulu there
S0428	how many languages do you speak
S0432	yeah
S0485	well
S0428	you're a polyglot
S0485	my my son say my son actually count them and he say dad be you aware of the fact you speak fourteen languages
S0428	ah
S0432	wow
S0485	and i say that that that might be the case i say but
S0428	it's like a dream
S0485	but my father tell me i say i know a man who could speak fourteen languages and he have nothing useful to say in any of them
S0485	that's that's what i would say
S0428	but at least you can talk to a lot more people than we can
S0485	yeah we zulu be a fascinate language it's the only other language i know the the zulu group be actually nguni er which have the same phoneme as we have in welsh which be actually my first language erm which be
S0428	oh and what's that thing
S0485	an aspirate l
S0428	and how would you
S0485	as in llangollen
S0432	ah
S0428	oh
S0485	and zulu have the same sound
S0432	oh
S0428	that's incredible
S0485	in in for example or it's quite extraordinary and english people cannot hear this sound
S0428	mm
S0485	and they pronounce it as a sh so
S0432	yeah that's yeah that's
S0485	so and it's actually but they they don't know how to pronounce it
S0432	wow that's
S0485	yeah it's interest
S0432	yeah
S0485	although a lot of people would tell you that english people be the worst foreign language speakers because they have the lowest number of phonemes in their in their er battery of sound
S0432	yeah
S0485	they just can't hear them but obviously you prove this to be not the case
S0428	i think it's it's that mix with a kind of attitude of everyone speak english so we don't need to learn
S0432	mm yeah
S0485	yeah that's the other thing
S0428	which obviously i don't agree with but
S0485	yeah but you unless you learn the language of people you're with you have no idea how they're think
S0428	no
S0485	you know you presume they're think one way but particularly in africa and i have two or three african languages all cognate but erm
S0428	in be this be in south africa do you say
S0485	in in in swaziland actually
S0428	ah ha
S0485	and and south africa but their their mental construct of of what they see be quite different to a europeans they actually well they see the same thing but the construct they put on it in their mind be quite different
S0432	yeah yeah
S0485	and so you think well why aren't you see what i'm see well they be but they're understand it differently and that have be a sore point between british colonials and africans forever
S0432	mm
S0428	mm
S0432	we
S0485	when i start to learn the their language and see how they saw things i think oh that's what they that's how they're think of it
S0428	yeah
S0485	that make a tremendous amount more sense
S0432	yeah that's what we be talk this the other day weren't we say learn a language isn't just learn a language you learn kind of there way of think their way and their way of life if you visit the country and
S0485	no it's a no yeah it be it be it be it be it really be
S0428	and the mean of word
S0432	and you see things in a lot of different different ways to what you would if you didn't learn a language
S0485	yeah yeah i mean
S0432	it be fascinate
S0485	you cannot understand foreign people unless you understand the language
S0432	yeah
S0428	yeah
S0485	you can't sympathise with them at all
S0432	yeah i'd love to speak more if i get to learn more
S0428	yeah me too
S0485	well you and but the chinese be fascinate but it it's too late now for me to do that but i erm they do say that there be a similarity between turkish and er you know chinese certainly mongolian but i can't i can't sense any any similarity at all when i listen to chinese people speak i can't hear anything that i recognise
S0432	i would try and help you but i don't know turkish so
S0485	no no it it's a learn turkish in a village in southwestern turkey and it's fairly colourful turkish erm
S0432	mm
S0428	i really like the sound of turkish
S0432	yeah
S0485	it be it be it's a it's a super language but when i finally get to istanbul and start use it there they say you know who be the country hick you know
S0485	i modify it slightly now but other day i be in a a tea house and order tea erm and i want it a particular way and this girl come up to me a turkish girl and say erm which part of turkey be you from and i say no i'm not i'm from london and she say what what's it like for a turk live in london

S0432	that's when you've conquer the
S0428	that's yeah
S0485	so but
S0428	you master it
S0485	but just amaze but er
S0432	i want to get to that stage in chinese
S0428	yeah
S0432	i think they'd be able to tell that i'm not native chinese
S0485	but you know it it's be one of the great joy i mean do do the degree be one of the hardest things i've ever do
S0428	i can imagine
S0432	yeah
S0485	classical arabic be by far the most difficult language particularly quranic arabic
S0428	how do the script i do erm i do a course in like arabic erm in spain actually when i be on study there
S0485	oh right yeah
S0428	and how do the script differ have it change a lot like ancient those ancient script to the modern one or
S0485	yeah the the it be the umayyad caliphate which take spain erm and and the omayyad's write in what's know as kufic script
S0428	mm
S0485	which be almost individual letter so it's not so cursive
S0428	okay yeah
S0485	and it then latin it become more and more cursive so and then very er colourful colourfully draw er but the the early form be a completely different script
S0428	and not as join together that's quite interest it's so beautiful arabic
S0485	i yeah i i be i excavate a site in southwestern turkey a long time ago now yes a long time ago
S0485	and it be a byzantine church which date to the sixth century
S0428	mm
S0485	and on the floor of the sanctuary there be a kufic arabic inscription and and they be this be one of the very few inscriptions outside arabia
S0428	mm
S0485	this umayyad i think what the hell do this mean and i just couldn't make it out and i i take an arabist there with me and he sit and then we slowly slowly work it out and it it's only a few word but it's the most fascinate thing i think i one of the most fascinate things i ever find the it's actually a piece of arabic graffiti
S0428	ah
S0485	and it say that's all it be be the erm er er evocative oh god be from the arabic to to pardon or forgive pardon yazid ibn sufyan and yazid ibn sufyan we know we know exactly who he be he be the son of muawiya who be the second caliph of the umayyad empire and he same around that coast in six seventy two ad and he must have stop in the harbour at knidos where where this be and write his name on the already destroy byzantine church
S0432	oh
S0485	but the more important thing about yazid be what he do next you would hear about on the news every day of the week every day of the week it be he that er eight years later er when he become caliph himself
S0432	yeah
S0485	er take an army into iraq and kill hussein er the grandson of the prophet
S0485	at the battle of karbala and that cause a great schism between the shia and the sunni muslim
S0432	sunni
S0428	oh
S0485	and he be the person hold responsible by the shia for do that think of that so you hear about what he's do every day of every all the crisis you're get right now today on today's news between iran and saudi arabia be because yazid kill hussein in six hundred and eighty ad
S0428	yeah
S0432	wow
S0485	and there be his name he's write his name on the on the stone and i've i've see it i've see his handwrite i mean it's like the thing jump out of the grind at me
S0428	yeah
S0432	his name
S0428	it's i mean it's it's fascinate we be at erm a talk in about how erm about erm the representation of muslim er muslims in the press and
S0485	yeah
S0428	and that be say you know he i remember him say oh erm they're you know these sunnis and these and he be like do you know what that mean do you know do you know what that be do you know what that come from and we don't know but we read it every day
S0485	well well shia shia be shiat al ali
S0428	yeah
S0485	the the party of ali and the reason why that be the case in six twenty two you have the first haj when let's let's go back to mecca you hear about mecca in the last few days
S0428	oh yeah with the
S0432	mm yeah
S0485	right mecca be actually erm a polytheistic shrine
S0428	what do that mean
S0485	many gods
S0428	ah
S0485	there be a thousand gods worship at mecca for hundreds and hundreds of years because it's a water shrine
S0428	mm
S0485	there be load of water shrine you get them all over britain holy well this that and the other
S0428	yeah
S0485	they're you know they're they're all
S0428	yeah
S0485	erm animistic shrine from the past
S0428	yeah
S0485	and the one in mecca be important because it's a strong spring in the middle of the desert on the main caravan route from south arabia to gaza
S0428	okay
S0485	so it be a huge er hugely important spring er and the the kaaba at mecca you know the one they all parade round this black box
S0428	yeah yeah yeah
S0432	mm yeah
S0485	be actually a nabataean it's either a temple or a probably a tomb so it go back into you know years bc
S0428	yeah
S0485	so it's it's not what allah put there it's a man make box if you like
S0428	yeah
S0485	now erm muhammad come from a family er from the quraysh clan who actually administer this this shrine and obviously they be take tax from all the caravan go up and down and they have these thousand gods include allat allat be the female of allah
S0432	okay
S0428	oh wow i do not know know that
S0485	yeah so there be a female deity and even allah do you know what it actually mean
S0428	the
S0485	the lah be what it mean
S0428	be lah not a letter or
S0485	no al
S0428	no
S0485	al be the lah be we have no idea what it mean
S0428	oh
S0485	it's the lah so that's where the name come from now tell muslim that and you know he might chop your finger off but that's that's actually where it come from it's probably some prehistoric deity that be worship there along with all these others
S0432	yeah yeah
S0428	wow
S0485	right now muhammad say that there can be only one god and that be allah and his his family disown him and they nearly kill him and he escape from mecca to er a town north call yathrib which be now know as madinat al nabi the city of the prophet and that's the first haj the escape of muhammad
S0428	ah to
S0485	about six twenty two ad or year zero in the er er muhammad have a daughter
S0428	mm
S0485	call fatima and she marry ali so ali be the prophet's son in law
S0428	yeah
S0432	yeah
S0485	and fatima and ali have two sons hussein and hassan right you're talk about seventh century ad things be pretty vicious at the time and everybody dislike everybody else and one by one actually muhammad die of probably malaria but erm certainly hassan be first kill ali be i think he be kill as well and the last member of the prophet's family be hussein the grandson
S0428	and he
S0485	the grandson of the prophet and he be kill in six eighty in karbala which be why it's you you may of hear of that during the iraq war it's very very important religious shrine
S0432	yeah yeah
S0428	yeah
S0485	now the shia absolutely totally blame the sunni muslims for for this murder as they still do as though it happen yesterday
S0428	that's crazy isn't it
S0432	it's crazy the impact
S0485	and if you go to the great mosque in damascus there's a special shrine on the side of the great mosque which be where they say the head of hussein be take by yazid and put in the great mosque as a trophy and i've see people there you know er religious religious tourists from iran who be shia muslims go there and flagellate themselves with chain until the bleed and cry and scream and you know blame the syrians because they're mainly sunni for this particular disaster as though it happen yesterday or last week
S0432	it it the impact it have on their live be just
S0485	yeah it's just
S0432	and that long ago
S0485	it's it's a schism which be far far worse than anything to do with the er catholic and protestant religion and it's much deeper and it's last longer and they're not go to solve it
S0432	no
S0428	but that's almost fascinate in itself that it can last that long and still be that strong
S0432	that yeah
S0485	it it's probably more virulent now than it ever have be
S0428	yeah but that's fascinate in itself how like yeah culturally how how it's keep up and
S0432	yeah yeah still central to
S0485	yeah yeah
S0428	yeah
S0485	oh it's more than and if it's possibly more than central but it be absolutely totally what they think what they think and the reason why they be go to syria in the first place by to a sunni country be because assad be an alawite which be more relate to the shia than they be to their own people but if you ask a thorough go iranian shia be the alawites be he'll say oh they're basically pagans you know they they they they don't believe in the same thing but they be take as shia er in in in a mainly sunni area i mean it's these things go back to the to the seventh century
S0428	yeah
S0485	six hundred and eight
S0428	you want to shake them and say
S0485	it be yazid this lunatic that cause this and there be his name write on this you know carve into the stone with a with a chisel
S0432	yeah
S0428	that's mental
S0485	so when he when he say allah oh god pardon yazid pardon me he need it believe me
S0432	yeah
S0428	yeah
S0432	yeah
S0485	but isn't that fascinate
S0432	that be really fascinate i didn't know any of that
S0485	i i like
S0428	and do and be it quite a like famous be it do like the the graffiti on the floor have other do other people know it be there or
S0485	no
S0428	no you you
S0485	we find it
S0428	wow
S0432	that's amaze
S0485	yeah
S0428	would would you say that's
S0432	be it still kind of be it preserve
S0485	it's still there it's still there
S0432	wow
S0428	would you say that be your like greatest or like moment of er
S0485	well you might you might think so mightn't you the great moments of archaeology the great moments in archaeology
S0432	it sound like erm a tv show
S0485	yeah it be well that's one of them
S0432	just one
S0485	but it's by no mean the most important thing i've ever find er i've just publish a book last month about one of the one of the most important things that i be involve i didn't particularly personally find it but i be there when it be discover and i be the first person to survey it there's a an extremely famous statue produce in classical world
S0428	mm
S0485	er it's call the aphrodite of praxiteles praxiteles be an athenian sculpture sculptor and the he produce it in his erm studio
S0428	yeah
S0485	in athens and the people of knidos which be here in southwestern turkey extreme southwestern tip
S0428	yeah
S0485	er buy this statue and what it be important about it be a a statue of the goddess who be totally undrape it's nude and it be extremely beautiful
S0428	mm
S0485	he base it on his mistress who be a woman call phryne which actually in greek mean the toad
S0432	it's not so nice
S0428	very elegant
S0485	erm apparently because erm she have rather sallow skin but i think it's the the other ladies call her the toad cos she be you know too beautiful
S0432	the lizards
S0485	but it's it's exquisitely beautiful and it become the best know sculpture sculpture in the ancient world for eight hundred years people come from all over the mediterranean to go and see this sculpture we don't have the original but we have endless copy of it
S0428	mm
S0485	er and have you see ever see the venus de milo
S0428	yeah
S0432	no i haven't
S0485	that's that's one of them that's a a a drape copy
S0428	oh oh wow
S0485	er and it's that famous and it be a moment in human history at the begin of the hellenistic period which be so where civilisation change so much and it a way this statue represent that change now i excavate at nineteen mm
S0428	i didn't quite catch that
S0485	and erm people have look for two or three hundred years for either for the statue or the special temple in which the statue be display because plinia amongst other things be a guy who die in the vesuvian earthquake of seventy nine ad he he describe it describe the temple the temple as a very special temple where you could see the goddess from all angle and so on
S0428	oh okay
S0485	well we didn't find the statue but we do find the temple
S0432	oh wow
S0428	ah
S0485	people have look for two hundred years for this temple and we find it and i be the first person to survey it so whenever you see a plan of the temple of aphrodite it's my plan it's
S0432	wow
S0428	i'm gonna hang on i'm gonna write that down and i'm gonna look it up can you
S0485	well the book be call look for aphrodite

S0485	it's about my experience
S0432	that moment that you find it
S0428	that must have just be yeah incredible
S0432	yeah wow
S0485	but that wasn't the most important thing i've find either
S0432	oh really
S0485	look for aphrodite and it's publish by markosia
S0428	oh if it's not press
S0432	no
S0428	we're joke we're not too bias
S0485	markosia
S0428	mm
S0485	that's a new publisher it's digitally publish but it's it's you can buy it you can buy it on amazon
S0428	oh
S0485	and that's about sorry the site
S0432	the enemy
S0432	yeah
S0485	a site be call knidos
S0428	knidos
S0485	sometimes wrongly spell knedos like that but it's knidos be the right name
S0428	have you see the erm the the museum in the classics department here where they have erm plaster cast of all the ancient sculpture
S0485	well i'm sure they'll have
S0428	that one it's
S0485	the toad somewhere
S0428	yeah i'll go in and have a look
S0485	cos every every museum i've ever be into
S0428	have it
S0485	i be in rhodes museum a couple of weeks ago and there be two toads there you know i i collect toads you see
S0428	mm beautiful toads
S0485	yeah
S0432	so be you still look for the the sculpture or
S0485	no
S0432	do you look for it and that's
S0485	curiously enough
S0428	do someone else find it
S0485	no praxiteles create two statues of aphrodite
S0428	mm
S0485	of his mistress they be identical except for the fact that one be drape and the other one be nude the nude statue become inordinately famous and last at knidos until it be take to istanbul erm the end of the fourth century
S0432	mm
S0485	er where it be display on a palace there and apparently be burn in a fire in about four hundred and sixty ad so she last about eight hundred years but the drape one er be buy by the island of kos
S0428	oh
S0485	just across the water from knidos
S0428	yeah
S0485	and that apparently disappear but i think i've find it
S0485	two weeks ago i think it's in the in the museum in rhodes and for some reason or other they say it's fourth century bc and it's certainly get the hair and it's get the the the bum be be greek rather than roman so it probably be
S0428	wow
S0485	er er and it's drape
S0432	so that's one to investigate
S0485	and it's drape and i think it's the aphrodite
S0485	yeah
S0485	no no it it wouldn't have be
S0485	i think it's be a long time ago it be steal but that that's true they do take a lot from that area
S0485	but you know it's it's amaze but that that's not the most important thing i find either
S0485	i i i i i'm not know for any of that in in in academic circle erm i work on for thirty years on paleo climate the effect of climatic change on human evolution
S0428	ah
S0485	that's what i'm best know for
S0432	ah
S0428	you've you've do a bite of everything
S0432	we should get your autograph
S0428	yeah
S0485	erm yes
S0428	and what erm which part of the world
S0485	er i be in gaza for about six years because it's an environmentally extremely sensitive area it's also politically sensitive but it be then but then they be
S0428	yeah do you think they could be link i don't know
S0485	no i don't think so
S0428	don't think so
S0485	and then i work in southern africa for twenty five years er the the same latitude south
S0428	yeah
S0485	to find out human evolution take place in the mid latitudes of the earth not in not in kenya or northern america it happen somewhere in the middle erm we didn't know enough in those days about what what climate be like through time
S0432	yeah
S0485	so we've have to invent brand new ways of look at the evidence for climatic change
S0432	mm
S0485	er go back five million years so i have a team of people mainly didn't have anybody from i have people lot of people from oxford
S0428	and be that something could you tell in the mud like how you know when you be say about all those layer of mud
S0485	yes in a way
S0428	could you tell the weather in the mud or
S0485	you you can yes but it's it's a very different way of approach it
S0432	i'm here
S0485	i have with me a really first class paleobotanist er and and i work for well twenty years together and we invent new ways of look at what climate be like in the past particularly in this part of the world they'd say oh well what what you do you look at pollen
S0432	yeah
S0485	and pollen survive can survive millions of years
S0432	oh
S0485	and if you can identify the pollen grain you can identify the species of tree which be grow form
S0428	and that's how they do it
S0485	but it's not that clever but we be use er charcoal which be inert
S0428	right
S0432	yeah
S0485	and provide it isn't destroy it will survive hundreds of thousands of years
S0432	yeah
S0485	and we be use electron scan microscopes
S0432	wow
S0485	to identify we could get down to subspecies level
S0432	wow
S0485	and find out therefore what the rainfall be like
S0432	yeah
S0485	what the temperature be like what the assemblage of tree be like and therefore what animals have live there
S0428	that's amaze isn't it
S0432	that be yeah
S0485	yeah and
S0432	i think we're in the wrong field
S0428	yeah
S0485	but
S0428	maybe we'll skew it like you know we'll go back to work on monday and we'll say we be do language research we're now look at
S0432	yeah
S0485	well the the other thing they have a a a a one well i have several research project at in the school of geography one of them be erm what they call particle history where you could look at an individuals an individual sand grain from a deposit and find out exactly what have happen to that sand grain from its inception to its present form whether it have be in water what kind of water whether whether
S0428	wow that's crazy
S0432	just one tiny
S0485	yeah yeah particle history it be it be fascinate
S0428	i think we're go to have to stop this research
S0432	yeah it's like the
S0485	there you go
