S0192	yeah
S0228	he be like i say well i say vary degrees but it's just not you get to call him your grace
S0192	really
S0228	yeah and i be like it's just not

S0228	no well he be a duke there's only one below really and the thing be it's just you're not
S0192	i mean that's a pretty big one below how many monarchs be there and then how many dukes be there
S0228	there's only you get it's just respect the rank i mean you be in the army and stuff like even if you think someone's twat you've get and they're an officer or whatever or sergeants and you respect it
S0192	i think
S0228	yeah so you don't have to respect who they be it's just a rank so anyway and i be like ah erm blah blah blah i'm your grace but i use a sign and a shotgun so it's not too loud he's like what what calibre be that i be like a four ten he's like that won't be strong enough you need a twelve gauge i be like he be like fuck the noise it doesn't matter so it's loud though he's like ah fuck it or get yourself a rifle
S0228	i'm like i ain't get a licence your grace he's like ah get one in time
S0192	i'll get you one
S0228	he's alright with me he love shoot mate he's mean to be a fuck good shoot

S0228	but you know er a thirty five thousand hectares mate
S0192	that sound like a bite of a wanker then if you ask me
S0228	why
S0192	well cos if he's get thirty five thousand hectares and i've get nothing then i i'm not particularly please with that setup
S0228	yeah but that i mean he bring that it wasn't inherit
S0192	i know but he's i just don't think you should be able to
S0228	he use to own land he use to loan own land from here to do you know where that be
S0192	no
S0228	be like er the closest beach so right in the coast east
S0192	i mean i presume it be the coast if it be a beach
S0228	yeah but it they lose a lot of land through inheritance tax you see when someone die the inheritance
S0192	ah
S0228	so what they do be even though he's the duke of he doesn't actually own the estates it's actually own it's actually class as a charity and it's run by a group of trustees
S0192	to get round that
S0228	and he's the yeah and he's the head of the trustees and it's just to get around that tax law basically
S0192	jesus
S0228	someone at work be like i hate people who be like don't pay their tax and they just you know cheat tax and put money in offshore account i be like mate that's what a duke do that's why he's you call this place a charity and he's the head trustee so he doesn't have to pay inheritance tax you know and he just shut up be like you're a fuck egit mate

S0228	cos i be a bite fuck mash then er in front of me yeah there be like four people like women and men in fuck high vis with twenty four seven write on their back with all these fuck light on their bike and they be cycle dead slow and i think mate i'm too mash to overtake them and then keep a constant speed to get some distance away from them so i'm just gonna linger behind them mate i look like some fuck stalker or something mate
S0228	just linger on the bike mate i'm twenty minutes late from that big group of bike think just go dead slow i just must have look such a dick
S0192	it be dark be it what be they all do out
S0228	i don't know mate i be think what's this the bike safety group or something like check on night riders
S0192	out for a night ride
S0228	i be think why have you get twenty four seven maybe they're on some sort of challenge or something
S0192	do their cycle proficiency test
S0228	yeah i think mate they be like street angels on bike
S0192	sort out
S0228	i've get a flat tyre don't worry the street angels be go

S0192	yeah it amaze me that we have good enough balance to sit on those two wobbly wheel
S0228	i wonder when it be invent though
S0192	er when it be invent
S0228	yeah sure they could've make a bike in ancient rome
S0192	i think the problem be rubber wasn't it like something that they need to roll the wheel on cos
S0228	they could've do it they could've do it with leather
S0192	they try to make it out of like wood or something it be like yeah you'd think of leather wouldn't you that would work
S0228	yeah my grandad use to run a bike make out of leather cos he be too poor to
S0192	yeah
S0228	afford tyres inside it be amaze
S0192	i'm imagine the whole bike's make out of leather so
S0228	the tyres
S0192	some weird little floppy bike you know probably i saw my car in greece that remind me
S0228	you saw a what
S0192	it be a tiny little car and it have no doors it just
S0228	a car

S0192	i'll find it hang on
S0228	say thank you in portuguese
S0192	i don't know mate i'm look it up
S0228	no no look yeah that's what i'm say you wanna google it
S0192	you like those boobies don't you
S0228	yeah it's quite a good you think what the fuck be that mate be it black and white and just her feet be blue
S0228	cos it's not much colour go on so
S0192	i look for one of those yeah
S0228	yeah it's just like a grey scale apart from on the feet
S0192	yeah yeah
S0228	it's a bite surreal
S0192	well what be i look for thank you in portuguese portuguese be
S0228	ah i bet you can just say that
S0192	that's the same in spanish
S0192	er it's kind of like obligate or something much oblige
S0192	i think in spanish it's
S0228	yeah you can say that in portuguese but then you say it casually everyone's just like they don't even like finish it off it's a bite hard to exactly know what they're say cos they just don't say
S0192	ah
S0228	they're just like they're gonna say but they just like think
S0192	do you know like letter like r and l oh it doesn't work so much for r and l but like s and z be exactly the same letter and b and p and g and k be exactly the same letter
S0228	mm i think that x sometimes when i see x it's pronounce as a z isn't it
S0192	yeah
S0228	like what the fuck do they z then
S0192	but if you put your hand on your throat here
S0228	yeah
S0192	and you go ssss
S0228	yeah
S0192	and then you go zzzz tell me the difference
S0228	ssss zzzz there's a hum when i do zzzz
S0192	yeah it vibrate yeah
S0228	yeah
S0192	but that's the only difference in in linguistics it's call voice and unvoicing so s and zed be the same fuck sound
S0228	mm
S0192	but one be vibrate the vocal cord and one isn't you have a lot of those bipolar bipolar by i can't think of the word whatever erm letter in the english language so take g and k
S0228	mm
S0192	k be k doesn't vibrate and g do and then like b and p
S0228	isn't this the difference what of
S0192	b p
S0228	between a vowel and a consonant be like vowels
S0192	no they're all consonants
S0228	all they all come from your throat or one come all from the throat and the other one be produce outside the mouth
S0192	every sound i just give you be a consonant vowels be like a e o you know
S0228	yeah and they yeah so they'll be pronounce differently
S0192	yeah
S0192	well they're they're from all of
S0228	or something
S0192	well they're all voice and so consonants can be voice or unvoiced
S0228	and yeah so
S0192	but vowels be all voice
S0228	yeah
S0192	you can't make a vowel without vibrate the vocal cord
S0228	yeah yeah yeah yeah because there be no vowels until the greek language be there like in a simple way
S0192	erm
S0228	everything use to be consonants like the like the greek
S0192	i think you might be talk about the alphabet but not actually pronunciation
S0228	oh no no no well then in the alphabet no cos
S0192	because we always require vowels
S0228	well in the greek alphabet
S0192	there's no language which have no vowels
S0228	well maybe they already have the vowels
S0192	but like in hebrew and in
S0228	but in
S0192	in classical arabic it's write with no vowels like write be just consonants and then
S0228	yeah well yeah well phoenician
S0192	you can after that
S0228	ancient greek language originate from the phoenicians
S0192	okay yeah yeah that's
S0228	so the phoenicians have
S0192	that's that's the that's the only in the world
S0228	yeah yeah so the phoenicians have yeah
S0192	that's the original
S0228	and they have mate they have like a hundred odd letter
S0192	mm
S0228	and it be all for keep stock and all shit like that but then over time it influence into what be now greece and there be four like similar languages like prototypes
S0192	yeah
S0228	before the ancient greek one
S0192	mm mm
S0228	but there be no vowels or say where it be in the phoenician ones they be develop later through the greek one
S0192	well apparently
S0228	and i think that's why like
S0228	they start write load and do music and there's like all the music and drama and all that shit
S0192	every i go down to every single language of how
S0228	of how express more
S0192	every single alphabet in the world come from the phoenician alphabet every single one in the whole world there's not an alphabet that doesn't come from the phoenician alphabet
S0228	erm look it up because i think you you're right cos then it's split into erm
S0192	cos there're other languages if you go to the east
S0228	don't don't yeah there's
S0192	they have logographic languages which aren't
S0228	yeah but what be they call they they call what's
S0192	it's not an alphabet
S0228	what's what's an insult name for a jewish person someone from israel
S0192	i er if if you're be anti semitic
S0228	semitic yeah cos don't you get semitic language
S0192	yes that's
S0228	and i think that where it's split it's split into what we have now what we have now into the ancient greek and stuff and the other one go semitic so hebrew
S0192	okay
S0228	and then like later into i don't know fuck arabian or whatever
S0192	yeah
S0228	be that what semitic be
S0192	erm yeah i mean we be talk about alphabets though weren't we
S0228	yeah cos you be say phoenician language be the first language and everything come from it
S0192	all what i say be all every single alphabet
S0228	well that's
S0192	in the whole world
S0228	look up semitic language cos i think it'll come from a similar place but if you think the language we speak now have come west while the other language would've go east it
S0192	but do you know like what do they have in china
S0192	do they have an alphabet
S0228	erm i don't really know what it be cos it's
S0192	it's call logographic it's when
S0228	just look up semitic
S0192	i will do in a sec but let me just explain
S0228	so so we don't forget
S0192	it's like semitic one word it's like erm in the alphabet we have different erm graphemes which be the letter
S0228	mm mm
S0192	to represent phonemes which be the sound
S0228	mm mm
S0192	effectively so we have one letter and that represent a sound we have
S0228	mm
S0192	it can be a combination of letter but you make letter to represent how you say things in chinese they don't do that
S0228	mm
S0192	it's logographic they have a one image that represent a word so instead of have lot of symbols that represent a sound
S0228	mm
S0192	they have an image that represent a word and sometimes they can have extra line that indicate pronunciation
S0228	mm
S0192	but in general it's er and that's logographic you then also get hieroglyphic which be more pictorial it's get like image that connect so the image be actually somehow a draw of
S0228	mm
S0192	represent it do you know what i mean
S0228	yeah yeah cos erm
S0192	so what i'm say be that
S0228	isn't cuneiform a major part of this
S0192	cuneiform be one of the oldest languages in the
S0228	isn't that like one of the bridge for erm cos cuneiform be
S0192	cuneiform be a type of write
S0228	yeah but it's after the egyptians isn't it
S0192	but it's a type of write it's like the clay slate or something that they write on and that that make their write very angular and very like cos they be write all
S0228	but i think their
S0192	i think if you google cuneiform i think it's a type of write it may come from some culture i don't know any more detail about it other than that i think but i just know that it's a write system
S0228	yeah yeah yeah it's just cuneiform come up here somewhere cuneiform
S0192	yeah yeah do you know what a diacritic be
S0228	no
S0192	diacritic be any kind of marker that indicate some phonological difference so for example when i tell you if it's voice or unvoiced you can have a symbol that will show you that
S0228	mm
S0192	if it's aspirate or er er let me take a word for example say p a t what's that word
S0228	no
S0192	p a t
S0228	oh oh pat sorry i think
S0192	pat now say splat
S0228	splat
S0192	if you notice in the english language the first p that you say be aspirate a puff of air come out the second one it doesn't hold your hand in front of your face and say the first one pat
S0228	pat
S0192	pat
S0228	pat
S0192	can you feel a p like a puff of air
S0228	yeah pat yeah
S0192	now say splat
S0228	sometimes you spit
S0192	say splat
S0228	splat
S0192	there's no puff of air afterwards splat
S0228	splat splat splat
S0192	so that would be mark by
S0228	yeah it could be maybe
S0192	by it's minimum
S0228	you go splat
S0192	it's minimal
S0228	yeah
S0192	you'd have to enunciate you have to go splat
S0228	yeah yeah yeah it's not p you're not like proper push the air out
S0192	that's call aspiration it can either be aspirate or not aspirate so a diacritic would put a little h above it
S0228	mm
S0192	and the h indicate that it's get an air puff it's like er do you know what i mean i i've literally have to learn so many word it's ridiculous
S0228	yeah
S0192	i'll show you in a second
S0228	yeah man
S0192	do you want me to show you
S0228	yeah go for it
S0192	you might recognise a bunch of these word cos you seem to know quite a bite about languages so erm
S0228	i tell you what's weird yeah when i be learn greek cypriot's different from the greek a little bite but i just the way they do some letter and er they put this word yeah only a greek people will say this cos when i say to my cousin or to my er grandad's sister she burst out laugh so do some other people cos there's a word it be only like a cypriot greek or maybe turkish whatever would know and it's and what a be be this be why i could understand it it's a shepherd's knife and a shepherd's knife be the sharpest knife or it's like the best knife you know what i mean shepherd carry the best knife so if you say i'm or you say oh you're you're like say you're the sharpest
S0192	oh
S0228	you know what i mean or you're the top you're the best of the best
S0192	yeah
S0228	i but i say to my grandad how do you spell cos another word be they call tea yeah but there's no letter no you know diphthongs whatever they're call
S0192	yeah diphthong diphthong
S0228	yeah there's a few in the greek ones i learn them all
S0192	eh ah
S0228	i learn them all but there's no there's not one for so i say to my grandad how would you write that and he he say so
S0192	it's not a diphthong
S0228	when you read when i read though he didn't know how to write it yeah but there's no sound there's no individual letter will make a
S0192	but a
S0228	but they use that as a word but when i ask my grandad
S0192	but er a diphthong be only a
S0228	he struggle to spell it
S0192	i understand that a diphthong be only a vowel so we have a monophthong monophthong be one you know mono so like monophthong would be one vowel sound ah eh oh
S0228	mm
S0192	that would be a monophthong a diphthong would be a double vowel sound like ow ear and then
S0228	a diphthong be in
S0192	a a triphthong would be a triple one like
S0228	mm
S0192	eh ah
S0228	yeah
S0192	ah eh be ah er
S0228	a diphthong's in erm
S0192	but what you're talk about be call erm consonant cluster i think where you get two consonants sound together
S0228	yeah but they didn't have there's no other word like it er i couldn't find one or come across any letter that make a in the language do you know what i mean it's just like as if it we use and accept it but it's not officially in the language
S0192	right it doesn't have it's own symbol
S0228	yeah it's not in the greek alphabet
S0192	but we've get
S0228	so you've get the alpha
S0192	we've get plenty of sound in english isn't in the english alphabet
S0228	yeah but you've get c h and when you see it together you know it's like for church or channel
S0192	yeah but that's two separate two separate graphemes it's not we don't actually have them in the alphabet
S0228	i know but there's yeah but if you if you say
S0192	but we can draw it that's what you're say
S0228	yeah as in church
S0192	so you can't write in
S0228	there's no sound in
S0192	greek
S0228	the greek like like if you go
S0192	they don't have bunch of sound in all fairness
S0228	they get alpha yeah it's weird right look under greek language greek alphabet
S0192	i be gonna show you this i've see i know the greek alphabet
S0228	yeah just let me show quick
S0192	ah
S0228	ah you'll show me this in a minute it's not go anywhere
S0192	i just need to see who i get this email from could be important newsletter easyjet oh do not have version that's what we're do okay
S0228	well you might be able to explain this to me
S0192	gmail ah stop request this shit i've put some free book up er what be it
S0228	greek alphabet
S0192	greek alphabet
S0228	right so there's no sound okay right
S0192	yeah
S0228	alright just click on this one
S0192	alpha beta gamma delta epsilon
S0228	okay so there's no sound okay
S0228	where be you
S0228	mm
S0228	it's actually
S0228	yeah
S0192	
S0228	and that's mean to be
S0228	er no no no that's not chi be it that's letter b you know how you say lock and sort of sound like lock
S0192	ah okay that's cool
S0228	it's it's sort of k k
S0192	yeah that's a glottal
S0228	it's an it's like a c k sound
S0192	kind of thing
S0228	yeah
S0192	it's like a h
S0228	yeah you know like how also have
S0228	yeah it's so that's like that it's he
S0192	it's a guttural something or other it's a it's right at the back of the
S0228	yeah it's right at the back innit like when my grandad's try to get me to pronounce word he's probably like that
S0192	yeah
S0228	i'm like i can't do it
S0192	no no well that's because that sound
S0192	we don't have it in the english language
S0228	yeah that's mean to be like he okay so there's no there and i can't remember what all the diphthongs be and everything but you get the vowels and consonants sort of thing but there's letter so these be just when they're write out like that i think that's just help you pronounce it
S0192	yep
S0228	okay so any e sound be like you pronounce it as in you know for tea like the e for tea be no that's just the one way to pronounce okay so eater and there's another one they all er when you see it in the word yeah they always have the same e sound so when you write a word with an e sound then you can use any of them letter okay you can
S0192	you can change the vowel
S0228	yeah but why why have that er
S0192	why do you change the vowel though be it for inflection do it change the grammar
S0228	i don't know my my
S0192	or change
S0228	grandad be say like it's just the way it be and like people always sort of spell it one way or the other there's no there be an official way but there's so many so many people
S0192	it's just
S0228	yeah like change it
S0192	have you even see iph
S0228	oh what's that all about why don't they have one why just have one fuck sound you don't need four make the same i sound do you e sound
S0192	no have you ever see
S0228	but why tell me why that's what i'm ask
S0192	i don't know
S0228	be you not curious why that why
S0192	yeah i mean i have be i might be able to find it better in one of these book actually you might like these book you i think you would probably like this
S0228	they're big fuck book mate
S0192	these be encyclopaedias both by david crystal cambridge encyclopaedia of language and a cambridge encyclopaedia of the english language so this go through all through middle english and historic and all this kind of stuff it's a nice book as well it's really like they've put a lot of effort into it
S0228	mm
S0192	right i'm just look for the ipa chart it's in pretty much every textbook i've ever buy it's just i don't that i don't have my other textbooks erm so that'd be structure language and language and identity medium of language languages of the world language learn disability your ideas about so where's phonology
S0228	i see what you're try to do here so
S0192	ah okay one thirty
S0228	so instead of say heel we'd say eel i don't think so like land he's go land land land
S0192	what
S0228	like here so you've get land land long land in central east which would be us he's like land
S0192	yeah
S0228	as if it's like essex like land
S0192	no that's a symbol
S0228	yeah that yeah so mean what then
S0192	that sound be an a sound
S0228	so why have he do that
S0192	the same as in land
S0228	why why not just do a like the rest of it like land
S0192	that's what i'm try to show you there's a phonetic alphabet there's a completely different alphabet
S0228	no but i mean you pronounce that one with the a
S0192	well it depend whether they're talk i haven't look at the book be they talk about an old form of english
S0228	no it's
S0192	be this spell of the old form of english or be this the pronunciation
S0228	pronunciation
S0192	be you sure
S0228	erm
S0192	it may very well not be
S0228	oh it say dialects
S0192	so it's erm spell spell if it be accent then it would be pronunciation i'm gonna show you ipa here you go this be the phonetic chart you'll see some of your greek symbols on here some er genius invent this phonetic chart so these be pretty much all the sound in the english language these be the not in the english language in all languages in the world this be one alphabet that you can pronounce all languages in the world in so i mean that look like some greek ones go on down here i'm pretty sure
S0228	yeah
S0192	so these may be the sound i know that x be that lock sound that you're talk about
S0228	yeah it's that
S0192	so that's write as x
S0228	he he
S0192	when when you're read ipa when you get a dictionary and you look at the thing these be all the different vowels that exist in the whole world
S0228	mm
S0192	how many vowels do we have in english
S0228	i dunno five i think innit
S0192	everyone think five but we actually have twelve
S0228	be it five
S0192	in the english language and may even be eighteen
S0228	be it five then
S0192	no we have
S0192	we have five write vowels a e i o u
S0192	but vowels sound
S0228	that's what i mean that be a guess
S0192	vowel sound be like twelve or eighteen and you can see how many different vowel sound there be so when you saw that one here can you see that one
S0228	mm
S0192	that you say be like s x something or other
S0228	mm yeah yeah
S0192	that's an ah sound this one that look like an a be an r sound like bath
S0228	ah right
S0192	so it's ah a eh
S0228	yeah the
S0228	man men men
S0192	yeah then you get diphthongs here
S0192	that one there be or
S0192	so that you know the sound that you be talk about
S0228	yeah
S0192	they're they're affricates where be they ah so the epiglottis this show you like glottal stop so like if you say butta and not butter
S0228	mm
S0192	that uh sound be represent by that symbol if you know what i mean erm you know when you say which or which
S0228	mm
S0192	which you know some people like which house be it
S0228	yeah
S0192	that that sound be an upside down w that make that voiceless labiovelar fricative
S0228	ah mate complicate now
S0192	it be complicate but that's what i be talk about so this be diacritics that be do you not think that's amaze though that somebody's invent one alphabet for all sound in every single language
S0228	yeah well
S0192	you could write any language in this alphabet i don't know them all but i've study all
S0228	be there more letter than in english
S0192	than in english we probably i would say use about eighty percent of all the sound we use quite a few sound
S0228	yeah
S0192	we definitely use a few we use a hell of a lot more than korean they they use probably about half of the amount of sound than we do
S0228	yeah
S0192	erm which mean they really struggle to put english word into that er they never say fish they always say pishy
S0228	do they
S0192	no fish pishy
S0192	they don't father pather
S0192	what because i be tell you earlier about and
S0228	mm
S0192	in in english those two sound be different they make two different word
S0228	mm
S0192	er pam and blam or whatever you know what i mean but in korean they're not they can use them interchangeably so instead of say run they say lun or lice instead of rice because l and r
S0228	yeah
S0192	be not distinguish in their language
S0228	no i know
S0192	and b and p isn't distinguish so instead of boo sound it can poo sound it's like it's the same thing
S0228	it's probably why they
S0192	it's it make them terrible at speak english because they don't see the difference my friends can't say zachary z in general they go chachady chacady like no zachary zachary chacady
S0228	why can't they say it though just copy the sound
S0192	i don't know we play screen golf and i erm i type his name in on the computer mine be be like people kind of like in like japanese
S0228	yeah yeah
S0192	and he come out come out as
S0192	so golf yeah i just say golf golp
S0228	yeah
S0192	it's terrible so i have to teach them these symbols so
S0228	yeah
S0192	my my students can read this alphabet
S0228	in arabic they go a lot
S0192	yeah
S0228	why be that
S0192	it's just the er sound in their language
S0228	yeah but
S0192	there's no reason behind it
S0228	yeah but
S0192	they just use it to distinguish a word
S0228	and that their language what spread over a lot of countries so
S0192	mm
S0228	so you'd think it will change drastically
S0192	it do change there's load of different type of arabic
S0228	be there though
S0192	there be there's like every single egypt's get its own form of arabic
S0228	but i read in a
S0192	it's a little bite different to to arabic
S0228	er yeah i suppose so i suppose it's regional isn't it
S0192	yeah it's like dialects
S0228	but there be like a mother
S0192	but that's the thing
S0228	a mother language i think
S0192	i think argue what be a different language there be no different languages
S0228	cos i'm sure people speak different english
S0192	there's just different dialects
S0228	in different place
S0192	would you agree with that what i've just say
S0228	you know what i mean what's that
S0192	there be not really there aren't really languages in the world there be just dialects
S0228	mm yeah i'd say there be languages because i'd say some people can't produce some of the sound that others can
S0192	there're some quite interest map in here that show like
S0228	different different language you try to
S0192	but a dialect the whole
S0228	and different sound
S0192	what be the definition of a language
S0228	and and no need to
S0192	how do you define if we're speak the same language can you give me a definition
S0228	cos i can say a word and you would understand it
S0192	exactly that's perfect yeah it's call mutual intelligibility if you say something that i can understand then we're speak the same language that be the only definition of language
S0228	yeah
S0192	but there can be quite some pretty difficult dialects of a language where you don't really understand what's be say you know what i mean you you understand most of it but like a lot of colloquialisms or thick irish accent or thick scottish accent
S0228	oh yeah mate the scottish accent
S0192	they can be pretty difficult
S0192	yeah but they're speak the same language apparently but it's a different dialect now there's a map in here which show a map of europe and it's amaze i didn't realise that it quite go to this extent but you know you hear like oh you know austrians can understand germans but germans can't understand austrians and like the people they can understand like it's all like kinda bite like this and like
S0228	mm
S0192	the dutch kind of understand them but they don't understand them and you know i think
S0228	the
S0192	it's the closest to the english language so if you what you can do on a map
S0228	like that
S0192	it's pretty interest you can trace a line across europe
S0228	yeah
S0192	you can trace a line across europe
S0228	yeah yeah yeah
S0192	and from this point to this point there'll never be a gap where this culture doesn't understand this there's mutual intelligibility move along the line where the the dialect be simply change
S0228	so i can understand a frenchman so i you're say if i don't speak another language but i meet a frenchman like i could sort of get on with
S0192	no you'll follow a line where it's one way reciprocal like we can understand a bite of frisian if we listen to it it's a bite weird
S0228	oh right so you're say
S0192	but like but we can't understand french so it follow a line
S0228	a frenchman might understand me
S0192	but a frenchman might understand a bite of belgian dutch or something like that
S0228	yeah well no apparently there's a place in belgium cos you know you've get frisia and all that and then there's alsatia and they're all part of like france belgium or whatever
S0192	mm
S0228	but they're actually like regional place
S0192	yeah
S0228	quite important place they're erm where you can have the er three people from three different countries like sit at a table one speak belgian one speak french and another one cos you know you get local languages and they can all understand understand one another
S0192	yeah that's what i'm talk about
S0228	they speak a different language in northern
S0192	so effectively there aren't really any different languages there be kind of the indo european and the
S0228	ah i think it depend how you grow up do you know what i mean
S0192	but effectively it's just dialects there's a famous quote
S0228	oh yeah but if you grow up in a place where all these dialects be go on it would just seem like one language
S0192	yeah
S0228	but you just get a lot of fuck different ways of pronounce the same word
S0192	yeah actually there's a famous quote by someone about what a language be and it say a language be a dialect with an army and erm basically like languages be just simply really just border now today there be countries that speak the same language like hindi and urdu be basically the same but they're from like pakistan and sorry not hindi and urdu urdu and ah what's that other one urdu and ah you'd know it maybe it's hindi and urdu i don't remember effectively it's the same language but because one country be pakistan and one country be india they don't call it the same language one's urdu and one be something else if we google urdu do you know what i'm talk about
S0228	do you know what i think
S0192	what
S0228	that we do not know who we be or where we're go in else political the media and inform us and inform in our in our mind their view
