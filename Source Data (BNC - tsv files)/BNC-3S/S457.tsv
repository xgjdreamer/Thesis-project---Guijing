S0614	yeah he's a young lad really or a young ish lad
S0525	he's a man then
S0614	mm
S0525	a lad you don't know if it's a boy or a girl where's the nearest hostel
S0525	mm
S0617	he'll probably be all round you just don't know them do we
S0614	he couldn't get in anyway
S0617	why
S0614	i'm not sure because er hasn't get permission to stay or he's overstay you're only allow so many visit i think
S0617	oh be you friends with this guy then do you normally speak to him
S0614	no
S0617	no
S0614	i say hello and that's about it
S0617	do you buy him a coffee
S0614	no but people do
S0617	yeah i be gonna say the same people that put in for you at
S0525	well stand out there with my
S0614	mm
S0617	get coffee
S0617	he would not do that meet people
S0614	and then of course you get the odd one or two people come up to me and say when be he gonna get a job
S0525	ask you that
S0614	yeah
S0617	when's he gonna get a job
S0614	why doesn't why doesn't he do something useful get off his backside
S0525	so everybody else think he's a he
S0614	i would have say he cos i think it's a he but er
S0525	mm we have a conversation about this in bulgaria we be at a table in fact it be last friday at the in and apparently your uncle and your dad be down one end of the table they be discuss whether a person near the table be male or female well i hadn't hear what they be say so i kind of catch up with the conversation a bite later and say what you know what be it your dad say really loudly we're just wonder if that person there didn't just go what and i say be quiet i think this be gonna be embarrass and i didn't
S0617	do do they see it
S0525	i don't think so i didn't it be gonna be embarrass but he say i'm only speak so you can hear go the whole restaurant can hear the whole of can hear shut up
S0525	i be sit opposite and it be quite funny cos be sit there discuss erm the fact that he hadn't do his homework
S0617	for monday
S0525	yes
S0614	yeah
S0525	erm and he'd get two lot of sociology homework so he'd email his friend and
S0617	yeah
S0525	he's get the title of the essay now say well i'm happy to write you a note to say you've be on holiday because you're not allow to i think it be a fair point actually you're not allow to take holiday in school time so you've take your holiday in half term so therefore you can't do your homework as well and i think to be fair that that's a fair comment she say if you be
S0617	what because he's on holiday he doesn't have to do his homework
S0525	yeah no no no not he doesn't have to do it but can have an extension would ask for an extension of maybe a few days because if he's be give a week of half term to do his homework and he's go on holiday and you have to take your holiday in school in the school holiday time and you can't take it any other time
S0617	ah
S0525	cos they will fine you therefore he's on holiday so she's erm i'm will to write you a note to say you've be on holiday can you have an extension of a few days or whatever
S0617	yeah okay that's fair enough yeah
S0525	i think it be fair enough and then she say however if i find this homework be set three weeks ago then
S0617	that's the other side
S0525	yeah and he say no no no it be definitely set on the friday she say well i will write you a note and he say oh i i don't want a note that's not gonna work and then then he find out the other homework be actually revision for a test so he be quite please about that because he hadn't get to hand anything in and say well you haven't revise yeah but i haven't get to hand anything in so that's that's a plus
S0617	a bonus
S0525	yeah anyway i think it be a good fair point of to say well just get an extension
S0617	yeah
S0525	you insist we take our holiday in school time he's have the holiday so therefore he hasn't be he hasn't be do homework
S0617	but then expect to do homework in the holiday at that age and what year be he in
S0525	no why should they well gcse year
S0617	oh yeah
S0525	even so i just i think it's fair comment to ask for a few more days i think that's fair comment
S0617	i see what you mean but
S0525	i i'd i'd fight the school over that
S0617	well i do think that
S0525	if they're fight you over days off in school time i'd fight them over that without a shadow and be quite anyway the point be
S0614	i think he could have do it all the friday night before he come out
S0525	well he have saturday morning as well but that's just isn't it
S0614	but that's
S0617	and the sunday night as well
S0525	yeah
S0614	yeah
S0617	so he do have three nights
S0525	or the sunday
S0614	he probably could have do it
S0617	yeah
S0525	but i still think i'd have ask for an extension
S0617	yeah but mum when you're in gcse year you've get to take some more responsibility
S0525	yeah well
S0617	and you've get exams that count haven't you in gcse
S0525	anyway the the point of it be talk about the next table because we're this close to the next table touch distance the guy turn around and kind of say to just be careful what you're say a table of teachers here
S0617	oh
S0525	he be just be funny but we have a laugh they be all teachers on that table and we be discuss the fact that teachers be unfair about the homework and he say we're all teachers just to let you know yeah alright then whatever be quiet but
S0614	yeah
S0525	he be a nice lad but it be
S0617	do you think they er be or do you think he be just have you on
S0525	no no i'm sure they be teachers
S0614	yeah they be
S0525	but he be just erm obviously cos you know you either they pack the table in in bulgaria and
S0617	yeah
S0525	you're right next to you feel like you're all on the same table
S0617	oh when do 's exams start
S0614	well it be quite funny that be
S0525	i don't know when do his he's get oh he's have his mock i don't know
S0617	they'll be around now
S0525	well no they don't start until after erm oh be this your mother again the only person with the phone number

S0617	put a coat on
S0525	she'll book at twelve o'clock so we'll be the first people in a table right down the middle of the room and everybody else have to walk around you

S0525	oh well that's i suppose 's gonna turn up then if he hasn't get
S0617	yeah
S0614	that's what i think
S0525	oh right there's three of them and and

S0617	but primark's primark be our customer like you say it's not expensive

S0614	but you do the rota though
S0617	yeah i do the rota i haven't do these rotas the old manager do them i haven't even look at do a rota yet there's that many people i don't know how to do a rota to be honest
S0525	well the old manager never work by all account so there's no surprise she book herself off for these
S0617	yeah well she didn't valentine's and she's not do mother's day well she wasn't book in to do mother's day anyway
S0614	oh so you've just take over her slot on the rota

S0614	okay so so she she plan that well then she
S0617	yeah have both off she's have this whole week off as well to have time to think
S0614	but
S0617	she's have a week they've just give her a week's pay
S0614	to think
S0525	what
S0617	for not yeah to have time to think
S0525	who tell you that
S0617	about what she want to do it's it's that absolutely insane
S0525	but you get you get better reward for be rubbish at your job at that place
S0614	well for her yes but
S0525	well why not for everybody then
S0614	well for she's she's get a
S0617	i'm new
S0614	a ladder a a a a step up haven't you because of your good work so i'm sure it doesn't work every time it can't do surely the company wouldn't
S0617	be run
S0614	be successful otherwise
S0617	you wouldn't think so would you
S0525	be you gonna contact over the weekend then because he won't call you know that'll happen and you'll just forget and then he'll phone do you hear what he say to your dad can you get the next flight
S0614	i i read it i read it so until
S0617	we be together when he have that
S0525	oh right so
S0525	what he'll do be forget to call you over the weekend and then monday morning he'll go
S0614	ah
S0525	where be you be you get the next flight up so you'll have to make an effort to phone him
S0617	be you be you gonna go
S0525	by tomorrow night
S0617	dad be you gonna go next week and help
S0614	if he want me to the only things i can add well i can help or i can add value or something yeah
S0525	as long as he's pay you i don't care what he think
S0614	mm
S0617	mm how come he's up there as well on his own
S0614	well he he do employ somebody
S0525	we haven't get any man manpower leave
S0614	but accord to they employ somebody up there and then they they refuse to do the manual bite
S0614	they think it be just tick off pip
S0525	yeah
S0614	and erm apparently there's some spray and so clean inside a pipe as well or something cos the
S0617	they didn't want to do it
S0614	and then this other bloke didn't wanna do it so say why can't you do it
S0525	the other bloke just want well normally it's just
S0614	something
S0525	all it be be write pipe number down
S0614	mm
S0525	say that when she be here about the fact that they want the pipe clean inside cos the end cap have come off but
S0614	ah
S0617	ah
S0525	so they want it clean out well they don't no they don't get really dirty
S0617	oh
S0525	that's the point it be a bite and and the thing be it's once they put all this stuff in the grind and all that dirt and leave it for age
S0525	what what they do be they have to flush it through with a a high pressure water anyway before they start use the pipeline so
S0617	oh
S0525	it seem a bite pointless to scrub every pipe
S0617	to put it underground
S0525	they're they're just i think they're just be stall for money that's all and they're usual tactics anything they can do to stall payment but you have no choice when you're you know when you're a small company like be you have to just go with what they want or they just delay it even further but i'm sure once that bit's do now which it be you would mainly be tick off pip i i'll write down the number for you because the the the ones in the sevens and the fours and the nines look the same
S0614	mm
S0525	that's where you go wrong but i doubt whether you've get anybody plot it on a spreadsheet like i use to anyway
S0617	but why why be you so why be that all you're go to do clean the pip but be gonna get
S0614	i don't i don't know i don't he say in
S0525	just clean the pip
S0614	all he's describe it as a as a er a fair degree of manual labour ten hour days that's all he reckon
S0617	ten hour days
S0614	i'm sure a ten hour day for be probably a five hour day for everybody else
S0617	oh okay so he just the one day ten hours that's what he want you to do
S0614	that's what he's say isn't it
S0525	it won't be ten hour days because for a start it's too dark to offload at the moment after well say for because it's still gonna be five o'clock in scotland they're not go to offload anything else you get there at eight in the morning and it's not gonna be any longer than that because you you tend to have maybe three or four wagons of pipe arrive a day they might have up to six arrive a day with four pip on each that's twenty four pip maximum you have to right i mean cos it take two hours generally to offload those four pip
S0614	mm hm
S0525	up to two hours with the crane or the suction pad or whatever they're do so by the you know they're offload the pip they're check the quality they're look somebody else be look and they might see a nick and you'll have to photograph it and say well this be what they complain about on this one and then sometimes there be and just you can you can repair them quite easily and what he might do be teach you how to repair them and there's a patch that you heat on you know erm or generally you're just take the the number down and put it on a on a delivery sheet and get somebody in authority to sign it so that they'll pay for it that's all it be but it's slow because erm you need a flask of coffee and book half the time because you you know two hours to offload a wagon and then the next one come in another two hours to offload them it's only four pip each time so it's not difficult it's not like you've get mass of things to look at you've only get these
S0617	mm
S0525	four pip on a wagon to look at it be bore though i would imagine but
S0614	so well that's what he say so i don't know you know we'll see
S0525	if we haven't get
S0614	his ten hours be probably
S0525	and it won't be ten hours if we haven't get anybody he mean from when he get up to go to bed
S0614	it'll be be a lot less
S0525	when when if you haven't get anybody on site then erm they'll just claim that they never have the pipe or they didn't have those number or anything they can do not to pay that the the only reason be to speed up payments cos what he'll have they'll have have eighty percent of the value of the pipe upfront but the remain twenty percent will be you know probably on thirty days net after delivery and those thirty days net be when they mess around and say oh we didn't have that pipe number oh we didn't well that be damage well we didn't have that or they didn't turn up that's what they do
S0617	mm
S0525	it's it's just to get well these be all your sign delivery note from your guy on site to say you have them so pay your money
S0617	yeah
S0525	that's what it's for it's nothing more than that but i don't know where in scotland it be and if you're fly up good because like i say you'll be able to hire a car and you don't take your car on site your car won't cope
S0614	fine
S0525	there's a you need four wheel drive for the place they go to so yeah yeah so phone him and find out and if you offer like you say three days a week or something
S0617	three days a week for how many weeks
S0525	well they've get two shipments this be the first shipment they've get another container load of pip come in
S0617	how do you know
S0525	so
S0617	this mum
S0525	er as well be talk about it at christmas cos you know what 's like you can't shut him up
S0614	mm
S0525	christmas meals it's a four million turnover job
S0617	wow
S0525	there's a lot of pip so they're do it in two halve from what i could gather and er actually ask me cos he he want to know how to defer the vat and do the payments when i be in i've only be in once this year and that be his question
S0617	mm
S0525	so that's why i know they're do two shipments so the first shipment have only just arrive that will probably go on for maybe six to eight weeks and the next shipment will be another eight weeks i imagine i'm guess but
S0614	well he hasn't he hasn't really he didn't give me any detail at all on most of the stuff i've get be er
S0525	he won't give you detail you'll have to learn on the job but that's all you need to do be write down pipe number and and just make a note of everything that you think they might complain on that you think they might stall payment on really if you can just be aware of that's all you've get to be aware of and like i say if there be damage to pip photograph it and send it to
S0614	photograph the number
S0525	don't send it to send it to lose everything just photograph it send it to and this be a problem and might go well they know they're they're there's nothing wrong with that or the ones who go okay we'll repair that
S0614	fair enough
S0525	work in one
S0614	something
S0525	as long as you cover your track like that then er 's get no problem and if 's go no problem hasn't get any problem
S0614	it's something different isn't it
S0525	well yeah just take a few take your thermals you'll be need it more than
S0617	it'll be cold
S0614	mm hm
S0525	be it just you for tea tomorrow normal time

S0617	push your like finger like around because it come up about this much
S0525	yeah
S0617	so people can try it on with different ring
S0525	yeah yeah
S0617	and stuff and you've just get to pull it like that and
S0525	i wouldn't think
S0614	and yank it
S0525	you'd be yank it i
S0617	yeah exactly you wouldn't nobody would
S0525	no
S0617	unless you're a scumbag
S0617	which be what these people be that steal them
S0525	mm and she's just go to sell them or she's get them to order and she's
S0617	oh she's sell them and then she's buy drug isn't she
S0525	oh yeah
S0617	the old drug run
S0525	everybody what off erm what's his face and
S0614	yeah desperate time come desperate measure and they they'd do anything to get their money don't they
S0525	you have a very cynical view of the world for a twenty two year old you know that don't you
S0617	what do cynical mean
S0614	she's probably right
S0525	what do cynical mean
S0617	it be right it be definitely right she mum this woman be not do anything else other than steal and buy drug and take drug
S0525	mm
S0617	she's completely out of it she's off her face she can't even she doesn't even know where she be what she's do cos who in their right mind would think that's okay to do that unless you're on drug and you be high
S0525	i don't i don't know have never be on drug be high or meet anybody like that
S0617	well that be you wanna work in retail for
S0617	a week and then meet a few people
S0525	maybe she's try to fee her family maybe
S0617	oh she hasn't get a family or to be fair she probably have and they're probably
S0525	on benefit as well
S0614	in care
S0617	in care that's the right word dad it's a shame mum but it's it's true i'm afraid and you can't go around the truth
S0525	you can't go around it
S0617	no you've get to face it
S0525	you've get to go straight to it
S0617	and that's what she's do but they're not gonna catch her be they and she'll be back and she'll probably
S0525	well she's probably move onto another area by now
S0617	reach the next oh i highly doubt it
S0525	i mean it
S0617	she can't get very far she won't drive she won't pay for a bus
S0525	well she won't she'll go on train and bus without pay if she's that type surely you can get anywhere you like then
S0617	you can't get into though without pay
S0525	well how do she get into
S0617	she probably walk doesn't she she probably live like on a street somewhere
S0525	mm you've get a whole profile of this woman but the thing be i wanna
S0614	what's her name
S0525	what i can't believe be there must be people steal within shop in constantly it must be go on constantly so why be the police interest a week later in this woman you know be they just see to be do their job because why weren't security on it quicker what be security do how many
S0617	she's steal from our high street store and ours and now we have some more on that night so she's they obviously want to try and catch this woman because she's gonna keep do it isn't she
S0525	how many security have you get in the
S0617	oh i could not tell you i've tell you haven't i if you want security you have to go out onto the
S0614	to book an appointment
S0617	you have you have to go out and flag one down
S0525	oh
S0617	well you wouldn't walk out your store that make you more vulnerable than anything doesn't it well you just steal all the ring you want i'm gonna go and find a security man you
S0614	yeah you wait there a minute and i'll go and find
S0617	you follow me if you want to er beat me up outside that's not a problem i'm not
S0525	well yeah no of course it's no it's it's not i i just think
S0617	and then the panic alarm's in the office
S0525	well i you just think erm that end of the you've get selfridges you've get swarovski you've get erm a few jewellery store you've get h samuel opposite you i'd have think there'd have be a fair amount of security on that floor
S0617	mm you'd think so wouldn't you
S0525	well i i do think so
S0617	i mean we do we do some on a saturday that's when you'll see the most but compare to the amount of people that you see it's nothing
S0525	mm
S0614	there's a there's an item for the next security agenda
S0617	we're have security at christmas though
S0525	what
S0617	a security guy for our door
S0614	right yes
S0525	lay on by pandora or th baker
S0617	th baker
S0525	not by the centre
S0617	not by the centre
S0525	oh well that's
S0617	so we're gonna pay for somebody to be our security man
S0614	right well that's
S0525	oh well that's good
S0617	i'll love that i will
S0614	a step in the right direction
S0525	absolutely
S0617	i'll be able to say anything i want to any of them you see if i have a security man there and
S0525	oh you could have oh you could have yeah
S0617	i empty empty bag
S0525	absolutely yeah cos you've get some backup you can't do that when it's on your own it's not worth it
S0617	but i would have love to have do it
S0525	yeah i know but you it's not worth your safety
S0617	and it's mm it's still get to me now think like i don't want to think about it cos it's annoy me cos how stupid
S0525	yeah but
S0617	do she think i be oh i haven't get that ring well where have it go then there's a gap
S0525	she know you're not stupid she know you know she have it
S0617	but she's take it
S0525	yes yes
S0617	and it's in her pocket well give it me back
S0525	but she would have hit you or thump you or and then
S0617	and she try
S0614	stop you
S0525	yeah but then you're in danger so what's the point for a hundred and sixty quid
S0617	a hundred and thirty
S0525	well what's it cost pandora a tenner in thailand
S0617	that's so true isn't it
S0525	it's it's not worth it
S0617	and then when the owner come in and laugh it make me feel much better because he's obviously not arsed about a hundred and thirty quid be he
S0525	no and it and it happen i mean they've get you know they they've build that into their figure they've get theft in there there's a figure for that
S0617	yeah
S0525	they're they're they're happy to lose a certain amount through that and a certain amount through your stock losses or whatever
S0617	yeah
S0525	there's figure build in for that
S0617	yeah
S0525	they take account of it
S0614	they would be more concern or more erm annoy if you enter into some sort of erm battle with her and get injure because then
S0617	mm
S0525	you could sue them
S0614	and then th baker would be in right trouble then
S0525	and then they yeah yeah
S0617	would they if she have have hit me
S0525	yeah because
S0617	what would happen
S0614	oh yeah
S0525	well if you you could have sue the company
S0617	what
S0614	for not provide adequate
S0525	for not provide the adequate cover at work and you could probably come away with thousands hundreds of thousands
S0614	so then more
S0525	depend on what damage they've do to you so they be well happy for you to
S0614	they would yeah
S0525	let her walk away
S0614	if she want the ring let her have it type thing
S0525	yeah
S0617	well that's that's me i don't want somebody to hit me
S0614	no of course not
S0525	that should be everybody's philosophy

S0525	well why do get you vouchers do you ask for vouchers
S0617	no i didn't do you know what why don't you use the voucher
S0525	well yes and just give you the money

S0617	so you use the voucher
S0525	give you the money then can't i
S0617	there we go all problems sort
S0525	well it be really yeah yeah
S0617	so i don't have to try and book a date off four months in advance
S0614	no
S0617	cos i don't really have the time to do that sort of stuff these days
S0525	you need people to fit in with you really don't you you can't fit around other people it's not an option for you any more be it
S0617	no it isn't mum
S0525	no
S0617	not an option
S0525	ah it's busy be you i remember be busy oh a long time ago
S0617	i wish i wasn't
S0525	fit everything in you need to be what would you do if you weren't work you'd be bore stupid
S0617	no i wouldn't
S0525	yes you would you're bore every time you get a day off
S0617	i'm not
S0614	do leggings aren't you
S0525	have you buy your train pass yet
S0617	nope
S0525	when be you gonna do that
S0617	i don't know where to buy it from for a start
S0525	well i would say because chance be you be not gonna be walk to the station because you're too lazy
S0617	i'd say
S0525	be that where you're gonna do it from
S0617	because if i work a late or if i go in at ten o'clock there be no way i'm gonna be able to park there
S0525	okay that's one day a week well get it from then
S0617	yeah but sometimes i do a ten till half six cos that's a shift
S0525	well get it from then or surely or you could just buy a ticket the odd occasion you get it you could buy a ticket from to street you can just do that
S0617	mm
S0525	which be a couple of stop can't you then you've get your pass so you could do it that way if you think you're more likely to be go to street it's gonna pay you to get a pass isn't it because it's cheaper than pay every time you go
S0617	it's yeah it's only like it's i think it work out at five pound something to get a pass or eight pound to not get a pass
S0525	for a day
S0617	so yeah a day so i'd be save what a couple of quid a week
S0525	five pound to get a pass or eight pound not to get a pass a day
S0614	eight pound a day that be
S0525	that's three pound a day
S0617	three pound
S0614	it's almost half price that be
S0525	that's fifteen quid on a five day week
S0617	oh yeah
S0525	that's sixty pound a month
S0617	that's a good save
S0525	of course it be
S0617	alright
S0525	why have it take you that long to work that out you're save a couple of quid a week so how do three pound a day equate to two pound a week
S0617	mm
S0614	you should go online and find out how to get a pass you use to have to do a have a photograph with it
S0617	yeah you do i ask him
S0614	oh right
S0525	have you get any photograph from passports visa any recent
S0617	yeah i should have a photograph somewhere
S0525	if you've get a recent one that save you do that as well doesn't it
S0617	yeah it certainly do
S0614	mm hm do it
S0525	go online sort yourself a a train pass and then you're sort then aren't you
S0617	yeah
S0525	and you're save money which can't be a bad thing
S0617	no it can't
S0525	okay
S0617	every penny count
S0614	i use to when i use to get mine the bank use to er pay it and i'd pay the bank back do the same it's like an interest free loan for the year
S0617	really
S0614	yeah i don't know whether they might not
S0525	i don't know that be always a bite of a thing peculiar to the bank i think
S0614	i don't know staff benefit travel so that you can get to work help encourage people to get to work i suppose
S0617	mm
S0525	what about your bus pass make sure you come to work mm
S0614	i don't suppose there'd be and i don't know whether the there's a a payment arrangement with network rail or what be it london midland rather
S0617	no london midland
S0525	well it'll tell you on the website won't it
S0617	yeah
S0614	yeah
S0525	what you can do i don't think th baker will pay you but er you're best to do it sooner rather than later and start save money
