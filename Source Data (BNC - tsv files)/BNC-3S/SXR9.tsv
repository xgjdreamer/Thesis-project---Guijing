S0556	just make sure your parent be alright with it first
S0405	as long as we're not all yeah as long as we're not all erm so i want it to stay whenever we try and do all nighters we have too many people and it's worse we think more be better but
S0556	that's true
S0405	less be better
S0556	less be better actually
S0555	true
S0405	you feel more like a group erm
S0556	i'm gonna be the only girl yay
S0405	yeah i know be that gonna be fine
S0556	yeah that's fine don't worry
S0405	alright
S0556	our parent don't need to know i'm the only girl
S0405	so yeah do that and erm that's i'm have an identity crisis like
S0555	why
S0405	about who my friends be and like
S0556	really
S0405	just i hope you guy know i'd always hang out with you guy
S0556	oh
S0405	ten time over all my other friends but like just because i have really high with them and like when i'm like we're talk as a group and like these guy make me laugh and i've know them since year seven
S0555	cool
S0405	but then then they can be such dicks like genuinely and that's not just from you guy i've think this for like probably since year ten i've like not not just in so many ways and i like i dunno i dunno
S0556	i think erm cos you go
S0405	just i can ask you guy i would never ask them this
S0556	i mean cos you go to the same school you see them all the time and you have to deal with that side of them more i think
S0405	mm
S0556	when you let like when you go to uni next year and you all go to different place even if they go one of them go to the same place as you it's not gonna be the same
S0405	yeah exactly
S0556	and when you tend to see less of people you tend more to have the good moments rather than the bad moments
S0405	yeah that's true yeah yeah totally agree
S0556	i think i think you this year what's leave and then i think next year it will i think it will fall into place
S0405	it's just gonna die away anyway
S0556	and even if you don't see them i don't think you've really lose much
S0405	mm
S0556	i know that sound really harsh
S0405	yeah that's right
S0556	cos i don't really know them that well
S0555	there's only one more year until you probably might not see them again
S0405	i know that's why i i don't wanna like make an issue of it so i just just carry on with what just
S0556	yeah
S0405	yeah you we all you have different friendship group we all do we all we all hang out with different people but erm
S0555	kind of
S0405	yeah yeah think of the day

S0555	do you feel like religions need to accept people if they're gay and stuff
S0405	yes
S0556	erm i feel like
S0405	should read an open letter from two muslim brothers
S0556	i feel like they should
S0556	okay fair enough right if if you don't agree with it
S0555	yeah
S0556	but i don't think you should act base on that opinion of yours
S0405	yeah
S0556	i think you should just leave that opinion to the back of your head
S0555	yeah
S0556	and i think you should treat them exactly the same
S0555	yeah
S0555	but i don't think people need to people need to force other religions to accept it
S0556	yeah i don't think they have to glorify it but i don't think it's fair to come out and put down like gay people campaign people you know people spend big big money to try and stop homosexuality
S0555	that's oh
S0556	to try and get marriage illegal
S0405	yeah
S0556	religious and non religious people spend big money to do things like that
S0405	i dunno be after the american legalise same sex marriage to our fellow americans just tell me if i'm get bore hey there it's two of your it's two of your brothers who be write to you about the supreme court decision to legalise gay marriage the good news be that a whop forty two percent of you muslims support marriage equality as do both of our muslim elect officials in the unite state congress one even serve as vice chair of the lgbt equality caucus there be many faithful gay and lesbian muslims in the us and we love and support all of them at the same time many of you be scandalise by the rule we know because you keep tweet about it many more of you be equally perturb but have choose to keep it to yourself with all the rainbow flag wave and self congratulatory pat on the back this country be give itself right now you don't need another reason for americans to dislike you sure rick santorum and mike huckerby call the supreme court decision the precursor to the end of days and final battle of armageddon but if you try say something like that on tv you may end up in guantanamo so you're stay quiet you may not like the supreme court's decision but you're deal choose to tolerate it we understand when you're where you're come from be a muslim in america be not easy on the one hand you're a part of a mainstream culture you're a warriors fan you listen to kanye you watch game of throne you even go to the office christmas party and sing silent night on the other hand you want to stay true to the faith and traditions you go to the mosque and send your kid to islamic school fast during ramanam and swap turkey bacon on your blt all in an attempt to establish a firm muslim identity in a non muslim country but now that now but now but now that same sex marriage be legal in america it's shake up your faith you're afraid of the future and what this could mean for your kid you recognise this grow acceptance of gay right but personally you just can't bring yourself to embrace the shift you may feel okay with have gay acquaintances or coworkers you may even agree that be gay doesn't disqualify you from be a muslim but privately you still feel like the lgb community be a live contradiction to what you be bring up to believe but here's the thing when you be an under represent minority where the muslim african american female er democracy be an all or nothing business you fight for everyone's right and the operative word here be fight while you get none for yourself democracy isn't a buffet you can't pick and choose which civil liberties apply to which people either we be all equal or the whole thing be just a sham we muslims be already a deeply marginalise people in mainstream american culture more than half or us americans have a negative view of us one third of americans that's one hundred million people want us to carry special ids so that we can easily identify us as a muslim we shouldn't be we shouldn't be perpetuate our marginalisation by marginalise others reject the right to same sex marriage but then expect empathy for our community struggle be hypocritical think about the way er people look at your hijabi sisters what i say earlier or your beard brother when they walk through the mall think about the grumble and star you get at airports think about the vitriol that that's spew on you by your own elect political leaders that's how lgbt brothers and sisters feel every day of their live be you okay with that we don't know about you but our faith teach us to care for the weak and the marginalise the poor the dispossess those who be trample under foot those who be persecute no matter who they be no matter what they choose to believe no matter who they choose to love there's a quran quote doesn't get any than clearer than that you may think lgbt right be a new conversation something that's only recently come into contact with modern islamic think but er trust us it's not challenge the status quo for the betterment of society be one of the very foundations on which islam be build no one be ask you to change beliefs if you still if your faith still tell you that homosexuality be haram fine we disagree with your interpretation but you're entitle to it erm yeah bottom line be stand up for marginalise communities even when you disagree with them be not just the right thing to do it's the muslim thing to do remember that whole god be merciful and compassionate thing that extend to all people not just those who be straight celebrate don't tolerate love really do win yours truly reza aslan and hasan minhaj
S0555	oh reza aslan
S0405	yeah i love that i love reza aslan so much
S0556	what do you think about that
S0555	erm it be interest
S0405	what do you think about it
S0555	as a father as someone who's a muslim father
S0556	okay erm i think it become difficult i think it become difficult for erm religious people to stick up for erm things that they don't believe be right i think and i think it's the same with people who be erm homosexual and be follow an abrahamic faith or any other religion i think it become difficult because i know some people say it's not the person that's bad it's the action that's bad so if you're a homosexual then you're accept that lifestyle as correct but if you're religious you're say that no it's not correct and it's a you acknowledge it as a mistake but if you're homosexual that be normalise to you that be your normal life but if you normalise that in in from a religious point of view that become wrong so it's like you're not accept something for a mistake if do you know what i mean like
S0556	i think it just become difficult i think erm i think okay fair enough i i think people if they wanna be religious and erm homosexual i think that's fine but i sometimes i don't understand why
S0405	why would they would be religious
S0556	i think yeah
S0405	okay
S0555	why who would be religious
S0556	someone who's gay
S0555	erm well the thing be there be there be interpretations of religion which aren't the mainstream in that case
S0405	every religion be an interpretation of of
S0555	which could accept it
S0405	scripture but you can literally support practically any stance or ethical theory
S0555	yeah cos they they use to have they use to use christianity to support slavery
S0405	or misogyny
S0555	and then after that
S0405	or kill nature
S0555	they say okay no we we no that be wrong cos look at these bible quote that say it's wrong that they do that
S0405	yeah
S0555	so
S0405	so just so it my problem be the idea that these texts be inerrant and they're they're perfect and think that's just
S0555	well why be they perfect
S0405	think that's that's decline yeah that they're free from error that one that's decline so much in that popular belief but just read them as texts or the way that they contradict themselves in even in our language let alone if you choose to study biblical language or quranic language and you actually try to analyse the way it's translate it still there be no way that this be a perfect text that can be interpret in the same way by everyone
S0555	the thing be that you can't say that islam for islam
S0556	yeah
S0405	i know that's what the
S0555	quran be the perfect
S0405	i know but there be still multiple interpretations of it
S0555	there be multiple interpretations but
S0405	and
S0555	but but accord people many of them be wrong
S0405	yeah basically yeah
S0405	i just think it's there's a misunderstand of what religion be for so many people and
S0556	i think it i just think it become too complicate
S0405	mm
S0556	i think you have to begin to pick and choose now i know that sound like you shouldn't have to but i think it become a situation where you do have to pick and choose so
S0555	like liturgical part of religion be so depersonalise
S0405	in what way
S0555	like you can't even connect to it especially for like quran and stuff cos you can't read the quran in english because otherwise it's not the quran
S0405	right
S0555	just a just er it's not the same thing
S0405	i think they always try and highlight the personal element to it or you know
S0555	the thing be it it sound weird because they don't encourage any like individual think they encourage repetition of what people say like eight hundred years ago
S0405	yeah
S0555	they don't encourage you to think of new ideas
S0405	right
S0555	this be why it's just so bore
S0555	it's so bore they don't want you to think
S0405	do the process involve you think for yourself anyway though just read the quran doesn't it require you to
S0555	no it's no but you you're not suppose to think like you're not suppose to rethink how something's interpret you're just use to think about how someone else have interpret it
S0405	right yeah
S0555	there be erm a book about muslims er young british and muslim
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0555	it's get some
S0405	good ten minute read be it good be it good
S0555	be it good i i've i only i only finish read it
