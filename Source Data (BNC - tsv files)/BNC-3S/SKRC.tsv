S0439	twat just very unlucky of all the flats there in in that apartment they
S0440	well
S0439	get rob
S0440	i reckon it be do by some either well i've get two theories one it be either do by someone in the apartment block
S0439	yeah
S0440	or it be do by
S0439	shut up mother it's not do by by would she nick 's laptop without the battery pack
S0440	i think hang on a minute i think a erm overdraft of six hundred er a a thousand euros and a in france and an overdraft of twelve hundred pound in britain could be something to do with it
S0439	no mum she nick a she would've nick the laptop without a battery pack it's useless and she nick a first aid kit if one be want to sell stuff to make money those would not be the things you steal
S0440	mm
S0439	so that's a stupid idea
S0440	mm
S0439	course it wasn't who steal everything
S0439	have like actual euros she have actual money in her room she wouldn't have just
S0440	five hundred dollars
S0439	exactly

S0439	oh
S0440	anyway do you do you see the piece on the in the oh no you wouldn't've do the they be talk about our english football fan yesterday
S0439	yeah
S0440	say how absolutely marvellous they be to sing la marseillaise and
S0439	oh christ
S0440	yeah and they say and only british fan could sing we're go to france we're go to france fuck you isil we're go to france and i think that be really amaze our our no our our fan certainly know how to you know nothing's gonna cower our football fan
S0439	it's because they're stupid
S0440	well it's the thing be you know if you send a load of millwall chelsea fan out to syria i'm sure it'd be over in a week
S0481	well they would be
S0440	mm
S0439	well i don't i do no i don't agree with erm isis blow up paris and so the french and the americans drop bomb on them
S0481	exactly i don't either
S0439	how do that how do that how do how do you justify legitimately drop bomb when you condemn them for blow up bomb
S0481	yeah i agree
S0439	where do you where's the logic in that
S0440	well that's well there be an article on the radio come home tonight someone from lebanon have write in to say erm we have more people kill in a bomb attack this week in lebanon er be that that hasn't be report
S0481	no
S0439	same as that erm earthquake
S0440	well we say we be talk the other day there be nineteen page of the paris bomb in the sunday telegraph
S0439	mm
S0440	if it have be a bangladeshi boat with fifteen hundred go down it would've get wouldn't've get nineteen line would it
S0439	nope but it's the west isn't it
S0440	yeah
S0439	and also it be a mass murder well not mass but be a murder whereas a boat go down
S0440	mm
S0439	isn't murder
S0440	mm
S0439	it's not premeditate be it
S0481	well drop a bomb somewhere
S0439	no yeah
S0481	be the same isn't it
S0439	but no i agree with that i don't think that's right
S0481	no
S0440	well i understand that they wouldn't let them out of the stade de france to start with because one of the bombers have splatter himself all over exit j
S0439	oh god don't
S0440	so erm they have to coordinate the exit
S0481	they have to just keep them in there
S0439	mm
S0440	yeah
S0439	but erm apparently isis
S0440	mm
S0439	be kind erm evacuate all the civilians from the area when they know that the americans and the french be gonna drop bomb on them
S0440	yeah that be er
S0439	wasn't that nice of them
S0440	that be kind of them yeah
S0481	there's not much leave of that place anyway
S0439	no twats
S0440	no i know i don't
S0481	it's not
S0440	raqqa
S0439	like it's just stupid but then i feel sorry also for all the other muslims and the refugees who be now be group together as terrorists
S0481	yeah yeah
S0439	because one of the terrorists be a refugee
S0481	well they're flee they're they're flee the terrorists
S0439	yeah because apparently one of the attackers on friday night come to france like claim to be a refugee
S0481	oh
S0440	and they get him by his fingerprint
S0439	yeah i hear that
S0440	but he'd get the same passport as four other people
S0439	oh
S0440	someone in turkey have have get a
S0481	they're forge passports in turkey
S0440	they're yeah the someone in turkey be forge passports and the one that they be use be one from a dead syrian
S0439	oh don't
S0440	soldier
S0481	all these gun be leave over from the balkan war
S0440	yeah
S0481	there's nearly five million weapons they say available
S0440	mm
S0481	so don't think that take seven or ten or something
S0439	will mean anything yeah
S0481	these people have get a continual you know
S0439	mm
S0481	and
S0439	yeah
S0481	you're you're better off in fact he say the west would be better off target crime than it would terrorism because
S0439	yeah
S0481	that's the real thing that's take money every day out of the system whether it be gun drug
S0439	yeah
S0481	everything
S0440	well one of the one of the suspect get stop in holland
S0439	and they let him through
S0440	because he'd get erm on he get
S0439	mm
S0440	arrest for drug
S0439	yeah one of the attackers apparently
S0440	and they let him go
S0439	have a petty have a criminal record of like four petty crimes include burglary or something well also
S0440	mm
S0439	another also what be i gonna say there be an interview with a with a neighbour or something and he say yeah one of one of the attackers come and ask if they could store some erm gun in our house and we be like why would you want to do that i be like if somebody come to you and ask to store gun in your house would you not report that to the police
S0481	well the other thing be that
S0439	like
S0481	the bloke do say he say problem's this
S0440	mm
S0481	we're in britain we don't have gun on the street
S0481	and our gun laws be very strong so if you see people with gun it's unusual
S0439	yes it be yeah so you phone
S0481	it it really be quite strange how so we don't have this problem you're not likely to get shoot in england by anybody
S0439	no
S0481	to be fair he say so er and of course we're an island it just make it harder
S0439	yeah cos you've get to get gun and stuff through
S0440	well when we be when we be go through to when i be go through to calais the other night this guy turn around and he pull me in check the car and everything and while they get

S0439	god how fuck er that's illegal isn't it
S0440	mm yeah
S0481	how stupid be that
S0439	i know i know i know i know
S0481	but however there be er a a court case just throw out this week there's be a major case where a japanese er er camera company call olympus
S0440	mm
S0439	yeah
S0481	who the manage chief executive leave and all the rest of it and there be fraud and there be a big hole in the account
S0439	mm
S0481	and they they be take to court and the judge say there be no case to answer because nobody in law a company cannot be take to court for deliberately mislead the auditors an individual could if you be do it yourself
S0439	shit
S0481	but the law now somebody find that loophole in other word they couldn't be prosecute because nobody have
S0439	nobody actually take responsiblity for the company
S0481	actually write the law in that a company they never think well obviously no one ever think
S0439	but how be that legal like that shouldn't be legal
S0481	and you think
S0440	and so tesco's aren't guilty then
S0481	well that's the point in fact you can't well that's the definition but i dunno what they're be but you they couldn't take them to court so it be throw out
S0439	shit
S0481	which be an amaze decision and
S0439	yeah
S0481	it just go to show that however good parliament think it's cover everything it it just cannot you know
S0440	well it's like these obscure when i work for years and years and years ago this guy have a swan fly through his door through his patio doors completely and utterly wreck the house
S0439	mm
S0440	really do a tremendous amount of damage
S0481	yeah yeah okay
S0440	so turn it down because it didn't have impact by bird in the er you have damage to your house
S0481	yeah okay we know what it mean
S0440	no no listen you didn't you have damage to your house by cattle
S0440	or by domestic pet but not bird
S0439	that's stupid
S0440	so this guy go back and there be a sixteen ten
S0481	yeah whatever
S0440	whatever law which define swan as cattle
S0440	never be repeal have to cough up
S0439	mm well we've be look this week at we've ring because have i tell you our landlord's be repossess
S0481	yes
S0440	mm
S0439	we actually have the even though the repossession could take place which it probably will cos apparently the let agency won't can't get hold of the landlord they're still make us pay the last month's rent even though
S0440	mm
S0439	it get repossess on the fourteenth of december and our contract run out on the on the sixteenth of january
S0481	oh
S0439	they're still make us pay that month even if it get repossess
S0481	and be they allow to
S0439	we don't know it depend if it's a bind contract
S0481	because your contract be with them as oppose to with
S0440	the landlord
S0439	it depend on it depend if it's a bind contract if the mortgage be a bind mortgage
S0481	oh
S0439	or something like that then yes we do have to pay if it's not
S0481	and how much deposit have you get
S0439	four hundred and something each
S0481	so it's a month's rent
S0439	yeah cos we're gonna we we're gonna have to pay it i think but
S0440	but hang on if you pay if your contract's with the let agent and
S0439	yeah
S0440	not with the landlord
S0439	yeah
S0440	then the let agent have get your deposit under a protection scheme
S0481	yes we know yeah we know that
S0439	we do and we yeah we do and we have the thing to prove it like our deposit be safe
S0481	yeah
S0440	mm
S0439	but we still they're still gonna make us pay that last month's rent even though the landlord's gonna have the house repossess
S0439	and we're like but we're not in the house and they're like we don't care
S0481	well that's a bite wrong isn't it
S0439	yeah
S0481	that's not very nice i might appeal on that one

S0481	they're claim he be up there with tiger woods and
S0439	yeah there be a stupid erm jason jason blah blah blah who's the black guy jason robinson they have an interview with him today and the interview be ask a shit question he's like and in the world cup from this date jonah lomu score the second try which win new zealand the match and you be the one who miss the tackle how do it feel have him run at you and jason robinson be like well you know he's such a great player i be like bollocks do you remember that one tackle that you miss shut up
S0481	they all run out the way
S0439	yeah i would
S0481	they all leap
S0439	he be massive
S0481	they all leap out the way he walk straight over carling he walk straight over rory underwood or somebody and just
S0439	and just get a try
S0481	he be huge
S0439	he be like eighteen stone apparently
S0481	and then that much be normal now
S0439	yeah yeah yeah
S0481	that's a
S0439	then at the time yeah
S0481	that's yeah that's a difference and then in the same world cup they play france in the quarter finals or the semi finals and they score a try the first they just leap out the way the french
S0439	yeah i can imagine
S0481	and then the french come out the second half and win it be
S0439	ah
S0481	it be a tremendous game it be
S0439	yeah
S0481	up that be really that be at cardiff that be that that really you say unbelievable that be the most you know
S0481	england would never have be able to turn over the all black the french
S0439	no
S0481	just go for them and such
S0439	yeah but then this time they roll over
S0481	they roll over they be pathetic weren't they
S0439	mm
S0481	and i don't think that i i just don't think they i just think it mean more to the all black than it do to anybody else
S0439	yeah
S0481	like they players that's the pinnacle for them as all black
S0439	mm
S0481	this lot just go back and it doesn't matter that much
S0439	no but it's a it's a shame that they've have this world but it's a i think it's a shame how the world cup go but it just prove that the rugby isn't good enough
S0481	what
S0439	in the rugby in the uk isn't good enough the team isn't good enough lancaster step down though didn't he
S0481	well yeah he be force to wasn't he
S0439	i think he have to if he hadn't've be step down
S0481	but then the danger they've get be that you know erm woodward
S0439	i wanna cup of tea if you're make one
S0481	woodward go through a woodward
S0440	i'm not make a cup of tea
S0439	can you make a cup of tea
S0440	i will do yes
S0481	woodward go through the nineteen ninety nine world cup and didn't do much but he have an experience of world cup before he go to two thousand and three
S0439	yeah lancaster hadn't
S0481	yeah so martin johnson have eighteen months of the world cup didn't do very well and they fire him so he
S0439	mm
S0481	if you have the it be just it be naïve to expect somebody in my opinion
S0439	i know i agree it be naïve to expect him to win or do er very well in the world cup but it wasn't naïve to expect him to win or do something when in the six nations and he didn't do anything in the six nations
S0481	the the the write be on the wall long before the world cup
S0439	yeah they need to fix it before the world cup and they didn't yeah
S0481	yeah and they didn't they just never get a team
S0439	agree no
S0481	he he be too commit to some players and yet in the centre they never get the centre sort out in the whole four years
S0439	no there's not one player on the england team that you think wow they're fuck awesome there just isn't
