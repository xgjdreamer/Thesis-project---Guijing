S0018	yeah
S0047	skate through the theory test
S0018	i hope so
S0047	cos you'll do the work won't you to do it but my daughter's partner he get within two years of pass his test he get six point on his licence
S0018	what be that for
S0047	for speed
S0018	uh huh
S0047	and that mean you're ban
S0018	huh
S0047	and you have to take your test again
S0018	oh no
S0047	yeah you have to take your test again so
S0018	blimey
S0047	he have to take his test again and he he have to have two test before he pass again
S0018	mhm
S0047	yeah it be both time be on the m54 he get do for speed and
S0018	be he speed a lot or
S0047	no he be do seventy in a er there be a fifty mile limit for roadworks but there wasn't any roadworks
S0018	fff
S0047	rather the work have finish or hadn't start
S0018	uh huh
S0047	but they still do him
S0018	nightmare
S0047	yeah yeah yeah
S0018	tut
S0047	so
S0018	so have he do
S0047	you've gotta be careful of that because if you get six point on your licence within two years of first pass your test
S0018	uh huh
S0047	you'll have to take it again so just have to be good
S0018	really careful
S0047	yeah
S0018	it's difficult sometimes though isn't it
S0047	very very difficult yeah
S0018	to see where the to just i mean be there be it signpost the speed limit
S0047	oh no doubt i mean i i i i've only have a ticket once in the last fifteen or so more than that actually and i get do and it's on the a34 come from er through towards
S0018	mhm
S0047	yeah oh sorry not from to and it's fifty miles an hour down that road
S0018	mhm
S0047	then all of a sudden it change it to thirty miles an hour
S0018	mm
S0047	because there's an old people's home
S0018	oh right
S0047	on er the right so i suppose it's correct i be do thirty four and i get thirty four miles an hour in the thirty limit
S0018	oh dear
S0047	and i didn't believe it actually until they send me the photo and i be like okay i accept it and you get offer er you could either have your three point on your licence and a sixty pound fine or you could do driver train
S0018	oh you have to go for a day
S0047	yeah
S0018	yeah
S0047	a day's train
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0047	now the day's train er you it's only available in lancashire and er and um
S0018	isn't it
S0047	west er er staffordshire sorry
S0018	uh huh
S0047	staffordshire and lancashire be be the pilot scheme
S0018	uh huh
S0047	they're the only apparently the only counties that do this scheme anyway you go you think well um that's only sixty pound for the course
S0047	so it's comme ci comme Ã§a so obviously you don't want the three point so i've go on it and it's er really good er er you go there and you think ah load of load of bunkum this be
S0018	uh huh
S0047	er anyway the guy who do the course who like they they'd drive and what they'd do their function in life be train fast response drivers for the fire service the
S0018	uh huh
S0047	the police and rapid response at airports and all that so they're try
S0018	ah so they know their stuff
S0047	they're really good well now they they're get you to drive slowly carefully
S0018	uh huh
S0047	and it be brilliant it be actually brilliant we and me and this guy this this he be a lorry driver truck driver and i've get er er quite a lot in common with him cos i sell scania truck so he like me straightaway well i'm the scania man you know
S0047	and er we we be top of the class we get er we get a hundred per cent
S0018	oo
S0047	think it be so chuff like
S0047	and then you do a hundred per cent absolute yeah it be great
S0047	we be we be reform reform
S0018	er so what do they teach you on this course
S0047	well it's just really good because they take you round and and the the the the idea be well thirty or forty be the maximum speed that you should do
S0018	mhm
S0047	or or fifty or whatever that be the maximum they they very they take you out when the school kid be out
S0018	uh huh
S0047	so and like you're it's true i mean sometimes twenty miles hour you're go down a little street with park cars
S0018	mhm
S0047	and a little kid run out
S0018	yeah
S0047	imagine if you hit one
S0018	yeah
S0047	you know i wouldn't i well i just couldn't stomach that you know
S0018	i quite like drive quite slowly at the moment i don't mind
S0047	oh you will
S0018	drive up to forty when it's when you can but as you say like you never know when someone's gonna jump out but then again i feel the pressure to drive more quickly because of the cars behind
S0047	yeah you've gotta have a happy medium you can't i mean on your test you can fail sort of thing or get point against you for go too slow
S0018	mhm
S0047	you know this be er er you you you can you can do that but er it'll be a nightmare till you pass your test it's horrible really
S0018	really
S0047	i have three test when i be er yeah three three test
S0018	uh huh
S0047	and it be er in them days it wasn't so hard
S0018	uh huh
S0047	and er
S0018	what do you have to do back then then
S0047	well there be no theory test
S0018	no
S0047	there be no check the oil and water and stuff which you have to do now
S0018	oo god
S0047	you have to open the bonnet don't you i think
S0018	i think so
S0047	part of the test now isn't it also er the gear change be different because er nowadays it's you're teach cos i've teach i end up teach both my daughters to get them i both get both my daughters through the test
S0018	yeah
S0047	because they be do they both be do hopeless with the instructors
S0018	mm
S0047	so then it be down to dad and of course you can imagine the the er the row but the one thing that my youngest daughter i use say well you've gotta first second third fourth and fifth
S0018	mhm
S0047	but now you can go through the gate can't you you can go you can go from second er from second sorry from fourth to second
S0018	uh huh
S0047	you i don't know whether you've be teach that
S0018	yeah no i
S0047	but that's allow now well it wasn't allow then
S0018	oh you have to go down to third first
S0047	yeah er yeah yeah um
S0018	and what be the reason behind that
S0047	i think it be the design of the cars be different now
S0018	oh okay
S0047	you you only have you didn't have synchromeshing you the gear the gearbox be different synchromesh mean er easier gear change in all gear now
S0018	mhm
S0047	the cars have move on haven't they
S0018	mm
S0047	since my morris minor
S0018	i've get a friend who want to she's get a morris minor in her back garden
S0047	mm
S0018	she want to do it up and er er put pay the road tax and start drive that
S0047	it's no road tax on it cos er
S0018	no exactly cos it's a vintage car
S0047	no no well yeah if it's over twenty five years old yeah
S0018	uh
S0047	but they they're not very environmentally friendly cos there's smoke out out of them
S0018	oh right
S0047	but how badly be the condition of it
S0018	i'm not sure actually
S0047	yeah they're worth dough they be
S0018	really
S0047	mm yeah they're worth well er i've have three of them actually
S0018	what like as a collector's item
S0047	er no no
S0018	or as a drivable
S0047	i'm i'm old
S0018	i wasn't insinuate you be that old
S0047	it be an old car yeah yeah the first the first car i have be a a ford popular you see them in old film
S0047	in old black and white film
S0018	oh really
S0047	well it be it be twenty five years old when i have it so
S0018	aw
S0047	my i get it my my uncle sell it me for a fiver
S0018	a fiver
S0047	yeah a fiver yeah
S0018	blimey
S0047	a fiver
S0047	yeah
S0018	well that's the thing cars be so expensive to run though aren't they nowadays
S0047	now they're cheap to buy
S0018	yeah
S0047	very cheap to buy it's six pound fifty a gallon if you
S0018	mm

S0018	mm
S0047	she's er craftily watch eastenders upstairs isn't she

S0018	really
S0047	i well i suppose if i er have a knife to my throat i would would then i'm not stupid or a gun but um

S0018	well i be work in
S0047	heathfield road and all round there use to be it's calm down quite a lot now
S0018	have it
S0047	i i mean that place have be up in flame er in the past
S0018	yeah no i saw when
S0047	yeah
S0018	i be work there over the summer just at the um you know the campus
S0047	yeah you see it
S0018	by the sack of potatoes that
S0047	yeah the sack yeah i know where you mean yeah
S0018	um
S0047	well that's more city centre though isn't it
S0018	yeah
S0047	by
S0018	mhm
S0047	yeah that's um that's not really
S0018	oh right
S0047	it's further further out
S0018	uh huh
S0047	that's that's um really be central town ain't it really
S0018	yeah
S0047	by the fire station
S0018	yeah
S0047	not far from the old fire station
S0018	that's right
S0047	yeah yeah the so it should be okay round there but no you wouldn't wanna be go round
S0018	oh but during the riot in the summer that's when we be work and the place go into lockdown cos they be all be all come in from
S0047	oh
S0018	and through there and
S0047	mm
S0018	set fire to everything smash all the windows that they could and
S0047	mm
S0018	they
S0047	be this the recent riot this
S0018	yeah
S0047	yeah
S0018	the ones last
S0047	yeah
S0018	summer
S0047	yeah over this kid who get arrest in london or something
S0018	yeah he get shoot yeah by the police
S0047	and shoot him yeah
S0018	yeah
S0047	yeah yeah but they just do it just just fun to them they don't even know why they're do it half the time
S0018	oh i think it be just the fact that it coincide with school holiday
S0047	and texting each other aren't they say come on we'll have a good riot
S0018	yeah hot weather school holiday they didn't have anything to do
S0018	and then it's just mob mentality they get yeah it's they i'm sure have it have it be individuals they probably wouldn't have make that decision to go in and do it but
S0047	yeah
S0018	if they see
S0047	trouble with the the the ability to communicate so much now by er with the phone isn't it
S0018	mm
S0047	texting and mobiles talk to each other and mob mm
S0018	but also the way that society's set up nowadays i mean these kid be be bombard with image to consume and that
S0047	mm
S0018	you know their only
S0047	get to have it
S0018	status you've get to have this cos you'll be cool if you do and if you don't you're not cool or what not and that's a problem they'll never you know er in the current climate economic climate they'll never get a job that's gonna pay enough to be able to get all these things so they just think yay a free for all
S0047	and they can't all be musicians or rock star can they and or on the telly where they er you know they they've gotta do mundane job
S0018	yeah well that's a that's another problem all reality tv and stuff it just set an example of such a uh such a low level of achievement

S0047	it's about dog right
S0018	oh no
S0047	right right which be great well er i think it's great it's a laugh isn't it you know
S0018	how dirty be this conversation gonna be
S0047	it really really well the song's really really bad
S0047	and it's funny it's very funny but the only trouble be the place there be a lot of youngsters children in the place now i i know from my experience with my granddaughter that most of that sort of smutty stuff go over their head
S0018	mhm
S0047	doesn't it
S0047	i mean i think violence and badly swear upset children certainly do my grand daughter but anything like we've be in my house my flat and my friend and um the you know they're all round there and they're talk adult really which be bad i don't do it but er flip my friend who live in a flat er er she's an air host but she's a real ladette
S0047	she's on about oh you know what all the time and er 's sit there well just pff pff just er you know just doesn't really take any notice er but it's the parent would get upset which so she sing this song about er which be call dog
S0047	which er i dunno whether we're suppose to be record this
S0047	and then the other song she do be er it's about shag pile carpet but it's not
S0047	about shag pile carpet
S0018	oh dear
S0047	and it get really rude
S0018	oh and what be the other act like
S0047	some pretty good there be a couple of um it be all it be all amateur you know it's um there be er er three girls or women three there be one young girl the the one at the right at the end she be a seventeen year old girl who be a really good singer i think and she be very pretty too and then there be a girl there be er they be semi pros these be these the two other one they be semi professional they'd do you know they'd do pay work sing sort of mariah carey type stuff and that you know and er er what's that er what's that new girl um that's just win all the award er adele
S0018	mhm
S0047	i think they sing adele er you know nice sort of songs like there be a couple of lads sing like robbie williams type stuff yeah which be quite good and er but er be completely she sit at the piano do this like really more suitable for er the the glee club type
S0018	mhm
S0047	slightly blue
S0018	cos her
S0047	comedy er
S0018	hers be comedy isn't it really
S0047	comedy yeah it's comedy and
S0018	and be everyone else just pretty much straight sing
S0047	sing everything else be sing she be the only comedy one
S0018	uh huh
S0047	yeah it be good though i mean i could it would've go down a lot better in a slightly different environment cos it be kind of family orientate
S0018	mm
S0047	you know which wasn't really and plus the fact that she'd get a really bad cold and she be you know
S0018	tut aw
S0047	um not the best of form yeah
S0018	there be new songs as well no weren't there the first time she'd perform them
S0047	no she'd do do them before i think
S0018	uh huh
S0047	i think she'd do them them before um i've i've get the video of er cos er katie's grandfather do a video er of the previous performance
S0018	mhm
S0047	which be actually quite a lot better
S0018	mhm
S0047	and er the audience response be better but this time the audience response be it be still okay but it be a little bite mute and there be some good act there be the one the two girl two of the girls be sing be very good i think anyway
S0018	who win in the end
S0047	um er a er the one who there be three go through to the final and er one be this young i think the one i can't one be two er one of the lads sing katie
S0049	yeah
S0047	who who go through to the final in that um talent show do you remember
S0049	there be four singers wasn't there
S0047	three yeah the two boy two lads who sing together another lad who sing on his own man and then er which girl go through do you remember
S0049	no i be too drink
S0047	i think it be the young seventeen yeah it be the seventeen year old
S0049	mhm
S0047	she be good she be a different class to the rest er
S0018	so what kind
S0047	she's get a good strong voice
S0018	what kind of competition be it be it er
S0047	just talent like
S0018	ah
S0047	you know er x factor type thing it be
S0018	be it to get on tv or
S0047	i don't know no i think it be just a local thing you know er and the i think first prize be two grand
S0018	oo
S0047	so it be yeah
S0018	nice
S0047	mm
S0018	i'd be up for i'd be up for that i wouldn't win it but i'd have a go
S0047	so it's a way of put some entertainment on um in the in the club er well you could say er a reasonably cheap way of do it so you get you know cos they don't get pay unless they win and i dunno whether there be a second and third prize there might've be mm
S0018	but they
S0047	no
S0018	do they give two thousand quid out a night
S0047	no no for the winner
S0018	er for the er
S0047	the winner
S0018	oh be there different heat
S0047	which so it be over several nights
S0018	oh okay
S0047	so they're get a bite of mileage out of the
S0018	yeah
S0047	two thousand quid
S0018	cos i be think that's not a cheap way of do it
S0047	yeah er yeah
S0018	two thousand quid a night
S0047	i think there be er there be probably about three or four appearances i think they end up to win to win it yep so a good idea really ain't it
S0018	mm
S0047	to to to get and they be pretty good yeah the place be pack
S0018	be it i guess
S0047	yeah full
S0018	all the people participate get their families along
S0047	yeah
S0018	and their supporters
S0047	all the families and friends and families and it's like four quid in so do they do alright
S0018	ah okay they charge you on the door that's
S0047	it's four well no you have to have ticket it's four quid
S0018	that's how they make up the two grand then isn't it

S0018	mm
S0047	and it's quite sad but that's the way that's the way it be you know
S0018	c'est la vie
S0047	c'est la vie as they say in france
S0047	what's the say they say es la vida
S0018	que sera sera
S0047	that's that's italian
S0018	whatever will be will be no it's um

S0018	que sera
S0047	oh no it's it's the that verb be what whatever what will be
S0018	uh huh
S0047	but i think that be an italian when er
S0018	maybe it be the same i don't know
S0047	que sera it's just a very similar language isn't it
S0018	yeah
S0047	i think
S0018	no when i learn spanish i be able to understand italian
S0047	the the spanish one be perhaps ain't it quizÃ¡s quizÃ¡s quizÃ¡s that's
S0018	quizÃ¡s quizÃ¡s quizÃ¡s
S0047	that's a more spanishy song but i think the rest of the word to that que sera cos there's more er they're italian
S0018	ah
S0047	if i remember rightly yeah ah
S0018	oh look how international we be
S0018	multilingual
S0047	but er have can you speak italian can you speak any italian or
S0018	no not really i can understand
S0047	have you speak to cos if they can understand
S0018	yeah
S0047	if you speak i can understand most of what they say
S0018	when i be in india and i be hang out with some italian guy
S0047	mm
S0018	and they speak to me in italian and i speak to them in spanish
S0047	oh
S0018	and um we understand each other perfectly but i i couldn't couldn't speak
S0047	well
S0047	my er a friend of mine well i haven't i haven't see her for a few years now er her name be she's fluent spanish speaker and she's be an interpreter
S0018	uh huh
S0047	very fluent spanish speaker interpreter for er you know politicals you know politicians and that and her sister be fluent italian so one of them do a degree in spanish
S0018	mhm
S0047	one of them now spend six months in spain or and both
S0018	mhm
S0047	so both one of them's do italian one's do er spanish anyway get a gig at the nec er as an interpreter for some italian people
S0018	mhm
S0047	italian company but she couldn't go so
S0047	um er say well well i i'll go well er you don't speak italian well i'll blag it she say
S0047	i'll speak you know er it's not too anyway she's go there it it's all like technical stuff
S0018	oh no
S0047	she's
S0018	then again the technical word tend to be quite similar to the english
S0047	yeah i guess so but she er she be she be er she couldn't do it
S0018	really
S0047	they stand they stand for it
S0018	she she couldn't pull it off
S0047	er she er they just accept her you know
S0047	cos er none of them could speak english anyway it's really funny
S0018	well i be teach english to this guy in spain who say i've get this conference he he be um tut he be a director of the of the transport and roads er department
S0047	huh
S0018	of the regional government
S0047	oh yeah yeah
S0018	and he say oh i've get this um conference everyone's come here from all the different countries in the world to er it's like to swap knowledge and to
S0047	yeah er their transport systems
S0018	swap best practice yeah and he say i've get people come from africa they speak french and i've get people come
S0047	senegalese probably yeah
S0018	from er germany they speak english so i be want to have somebody on site who could speak french spanish and english
S0047	mm
S0018	would you be up for come for these two
S0047	as a go between
S0018	two days and just be the person who facilitate um tut the communication if
S0047	mm
S0018	anyone have any language problems i say yeah no problem no problem okay i get there nine o'clock on the first day i get usher into the conference room and get put in this booth
S0047	uh huh
S0018	er interpret booth
S0047	oh a proper one oh no
S0018	a proper one with the headphones with the janet jackson
S0047	and you have to be
S0018	mouthpiece
S0047	you have to be quick don't you
S0018	oh my life i mean i say
S0047	mm
S0018	i er the way he kind of tell me about it it be just to be there in case anyone have any problems with vocabulary understand i just
S0047	er yeah yeah
S0018	think it would be the odd translation and the odd whisper into someone's ear but they want me to do full on interpret
S0047	so you get so english be come through and you've gotta do french and
S0018	no the worst thing be the first presentation be in french and i have to translate it into spanish
S0047	oh so oh god
S0018	which you shouldn't even normally do cos normally you're only suppose to er translate into your native tongue
S0047	native yeah yeah oh yeah so
S0018	oh do you know what i do though er cos i mean when you're in the booth you have to have about five different think process go on at the at the same time you have to have memory for what's just be say while you're translate the bite that come before your brain have to be translate the bite that come before so you
S0047	mm
S0018	listen attend to the spanish and then your french and then your brain's work it out in spanish
S0047	yeah yeah oh
S0018	at the same time you have to be listen ahead and then at the same time you have to be speak and oh my life i do about the first three sentence
S0047	that's er
S0018	then get completely behind so do you know what i start do i just start mouth the word because i felt like such a
S0018	so embarrass
S0047	pretend pretend that there be a problem with the
S0018	yeah
S0047	the
S0018	but i be so embarrass and i just couldn't do it
S0047	that's really cos er you
S0018	it need train
S0047	yeah
S0018	i mean there's
S0047	yeah
S0018	you
S0047	no that's er that's a real hard call isn't it that be
S0018	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0047	because i think if you're
S0047	er you you you you sort of think spanish don't you you when you when you get to a certain stage in spanish you start to think in spanish don't you
S0018	hm
S0047	that's the that's when you know you're get somewhere but to then to think in spanish and french so and then
S0018	which i can do fine when it's no pressure
S0047	er so well you cos you see you probably have to go through in your head to spanish to english then to french
S0018	yeah yeah
S0018	no i can do straight from spanish to french
S0047	can you go across yeah yeah
S0018	cos they're quite similar
S0047	yeah
S0018	i can translate between them but er you know in a informal environment there be three hundred people in that room all turn round to look at me in my little booth
S0047	them senegalese though they can they tend to speak a lot of they can nearly always speak obviously french and english
S0018	mm
S0047	and they've get a couple of tribal languages quite a few i meet a mind you they be in spain who could speak spanish
S0018	mhm
S0047	senegalese they could speak spanish they get spanish english french and like well what tribal language well they can do whatever i dunno two or three tribal languages
S0018	mm
S0047	as well amaze
S0018	i think people who grow up in a country that have get a lot of languages within that country they're more open to
S0047	mm
S0018	learn languages and pick it up i mean in england people be awful about learn languages aren't they
S0047	in england it's really bad isn't it
S0018	mm
S0047	really bad yeah
S0018	but i guess everyone around the world speak english so they don't feel
S0047	no
S0018	that they need to learn
S0047	but it's just courteous isn't it we should you should like and it's the education system there's not enough teachers or that's the excuse they should that shouldn't prevail now there should be plenty of well polish and romanians
S0047	to teach to learn well well certainly german there's i imagine that most polish people speak german can't they
S0018	mm
S0047	and we've get um i i would've think there be enough people now to teach but that's always be the excuse there's not enough teachers
S0018	well i think the problem be that you know they're try to teach class of thirty kid at a time
S0047	mm
S0018	so you're not actually teach how to communicate in the language you're just teach the academic nature of the language like the study of the vocabulary and grammar and kid just don't see you know they have to work really really hard memorize things and they don't get a feel that like they're learn anything or they can use it
S0047	mm
S0018	they don't see an objective
S0047	they're not motivate be they
S0018	exactly and as soon as you lose them they're go
S0047	mm
S0018	and they er they have no mm they take no joy in it they don't
S0047	mm
S0018	enjoy the whole
S0047	i do i use to enjoy er well it be only french and a little bite of latin but i've learn all my i've learn more since you know in recent years than i ever do at school so in er er
S0018	what from travel around
S0047	yeah well just just just just like from go to night school and go yeah from cds and that and
S0018	mhm
S0047	that's that's how i've learn it yeah
S0018	where have you study at a night school
S0047	in in in um
S0018	in the brasshouse
S0047	yeah yeah
S0018	ah
S0047	up there yeah yeah
S0018	cool
S0047	but i find that that i find that like frustrate cos i think most of the people who go there go for social reason rather than actually to learn to speak the language
