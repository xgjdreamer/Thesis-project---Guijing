S0521	back cos they delete the number from the presumably because they don't want me to do business with the
S0519	them directly
S0521	directly and so they cut
S0520	oh the agencies yeah
S0519	but i don't i don't want to do business with someone if i don't know who the firm be
S0521	no of course not
S0519	cos then you can't google the firm and say how have their removals be you know get review on them or whatever
S0520	oh no
S0519	that's no good at all be it wish bloody pickford's'd pitch up and tell us what they want to do
S0520	be you wait to hear from them
S0521	yes
S0519	they're not in your junk mail
S0521	no mm
S0519	how be your boys then
S0520	they be my boys those two we always work the three of us a lot because 's the man in charge and be need for everything really and be consult for everything because he's very wise and he always think of things in a really clever way he's just good at stuff
S0521	sound
S0520	and i do all of the texts which be almost always something involve and all of the graphics so whenever we launch something we're like a little triangle of get you know kind of be initiate it all and also make it you know be a quality controller really and ask if necessary what he think about a b or c and how we should present things and be er be the mm sort of implementer so anyway yeah they're good erm it's a lot of things always it's a lot of you know what it's like in there's a lot of small things that need do and erm problems that you have to kind of solve along the way and excuse me and er and you know we just recently write an email to everybody because we use to be a small very small group of us really do these retreat and it be just a few time a year and it be almost do everything at that time himself and you know we've just expand everything and there's a really lot of retreat as you know
S0519	mm
S0520	and in india it's a community really it's not a retreat it's quite a long period of time and there's a huge amount of administration that come with it and then on my side you know all the book and the website and texts and videos and erm all kind of variety of erm of present information really and knowledge and so it's a huge thing and a lot of people be involve you know so it's just like you know as anything do you know it kind of grow organically if people be motivate to but it yeah we have we be carry a very large portion of the work the three of us and and we still be because you know there's always you know the people who be the most involve and the most in charge but we've try to initiate a process now where other people be contribute a lot more so that it's kind of more democratic
S0519	mm
S0520	not democratic what's the word just share really 's really good at it she's a delegator i like to sort of sit in my little office and do everything for myself you know so i have to learn to mm delegate this things to other people and er be be a like more a facilitator and supervise everything and check that it's do properly but not be the one do it you know i'm like a little one man band at the moment or have be and erm so that's quite fun it's nice to change things i really like work with both of them it's a lot of fun they're very different mm erm but now also with this girlfriend on the scene she's erm she can do a lot of stuff and she's you know the fact that they're together be a huge help because like if you do design things he'll i'll design it in photoshop and then he'll erm programme it in html and whatever blah blah computer speak translate it into a web page program it and then it'll come out really squiffy usually you know and then you have to look at it and say that space need to be bigger
S0519	mm
S0520	that need to be further away from that and that element doesn't work and then you have to make it live so whenever someone's hover over the page you know with web page things happen to show you
S0519	happen
S0520	that you can click
S0519	mm
S0520	for instance if you go over a link usually it change colour or it bounce or it get bigger or something erm and whatever things move and be responsive so all of those things be in addition to just the sort of flat design
S0519	mm mm
S0520	and normally the two of us be try to do it over skype you know with erm look not quite look at the same thing and all you want to do be sit in front of same screen and go try this try this try this
S0519	mm and then she can do that
S0520	so she can do all of that yeah cos they're anyway together
S0519	mm
S0520	and she's get a good eye for things and erm and that's all good news and also it mean cos the the website you know we do a huge project set it up and when once it's be set up we've hardly touch it and it's suppose to be an alive thing
S0519	yeah ongoing
S0520	and it's mostly
S0519	it's really really you you actually need somebody to just do that all the time
S0520	their permanent job see that's none of our permanent job it's like our it's our like back
S0519	the lowest on your list
S0520	always usually cos there be live things happen you know like now we're do this and you always there's a project go on i have three book four book go on at the moment
S0519	mm
S0520	and so we never get round to it and it's a pity because for the majority of people that's exactly where they're go to come in touch with the teach they're go to go on the website they're go to read that that's go to be their constant contact with it
S0519	mm
S0520	so really it should be our priority
S0519	mm
S0520	so i'm think now that i would like to set her up as kind of the one who would develop it all graphically
S0519	mm
S0520	and erm there's another boy who's a swiss guy who's also like to do graphics and be learn how to use the program and he seem really good and he's erm just like an incredible precisionist which be really nice to have because i don't have it at all
S0519	mm
S0520	so when i do design work i quite like good at the think up an idea bite and have you know i can kind of make things look nice but i don't ever go into the nitty gritty and if you look at good design it's usually do by someone extremely pedantic cos it's all erm mathematical really so he make for us a big logo of the teach for the hall erm print on a kind of a canvas you know which we hang kind of at the at the top of the hall when you go in and er it's just beautiful and you can't even say why
S0519	mm
S0520	but he work on the erm original scan of the logo and just go into detail pixel pixels detail and go sort of smooth certain things over and choose like slightly different colour for the and it be just lovely yeah so
S0519	amaze talent
S0520	yeah he's really good at that he's that nature of person but he could be definitely involve as well on the website so when be your competition for the choir
S0519	end of october last weekend in october
S0520	so it won't be interfere with by all the move and stuff mm
S0519	and the erm follow weekend be a a competition in in wales
S0520	a real one or just that you're go to be the victory team
S0519	a real one oh i don't know
S0519	but erm yeah i don't know it's a proper
S0520	no i mean real as in you're actually compete you're not just go to
S0519	we're compete no no no no we're not just go to show off
S0520	have a jolly and show off yeah it'll be fun to go there and not have to compete for the big for the main one
S0519	yeah no very excite
S0520	mm be a lark well you have to sing and you have to be grade don't you
S0519	yeah
S0520	so it's not without pressure
S0519	no and that's at like nine o'clock in the morning so that's not jolly either
S0520	do and dust oh but yeah
S0519	erm and then the next morning we it's call sing with the champ erm that's at nine o'clock in the morning as well please
S0520	hate do things at nine o'clock in the morning anything
S0519	and erm and then i'll we do our sort of it's kind of terrible slot really they take us out of the show and put us as to sing four songs while people be wait for the result and frankly they don't give a damn
S0520	my dear scarlett
S0519	erm yeah yeah i mean they're wait for the result they don't want to see some other choir sing who aren't even in it
S0520	they just want to
S0519	they just want to know
S0520	they're just distract
S0519	but anyway that's what we're do
S0520	well it's always good experience to perform the songs cos it's completely different isn't it
S0519	oh yes i don't mind at all i you know but that's our our job and then we're on the doors and you know we have other job

S0521	we're go to be in
S0519	and and see what they offer
S0520	mm i'm not that optimistic about but
S0519	isn't that in wales somewhere
S0520	it's not exactly on the map of the er usual
