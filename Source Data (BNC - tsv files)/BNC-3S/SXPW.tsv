S0655	that's go to be hard
S0654	erm mm
S0653	yeah
S0654	give out free flower in the street
S0653	that's a nice idea
S0654	and and bubble for the children
S0653	i love the idea of give out flower that's so lovely
S0654	and and bubble and it all free
S0653	yeah we could get a big bunch of lot of individual flower oh my goodness that would make people's day wouldn't it
S0654	so we could get like orange and purple and green
S0655	i have an idea
S0653	and yeah bubble on a different we could go to a pub now of course because we want to try and do this over the year when it's a bite nicer weather like a sunny day that would be a lovely time to
S0654	yeah a lovely time
S0655	i have a dream i have a dream er in a part of my dream i erm have an idea
S0653	aha
S0655	it be maybe to give out free charity box
S0653	right
S0655	so then when people get them they could place it around the town
S0653	yeah
S0655	and then people would put in money for charity
S0653	yes we could do that but we
S0655	that be in my dream
S0653	i've get an idea i've get an idea
S0653	okay yeah
S0654	go round town with erm
S0653	bubble
S0654	with some box
S0653	mm hm
S0654	and they fill with charity and they fill with charity box and therefore all and if we have enough money we could raise the water age
S0653	yeah but i think what we should do rather than just leave charity box cos maybe they might not put anything in it be that we should try and fill a charity box ourselves that would be a good idea wouldn't it
S0655	yeah
S0654	yeah we could get a charity box and put money in it
S0653	yeah
S0654	and then give it to a charity
S0653	i would like to do something for the homeless shelter
S0654	yeah
S0653	erm we could go and volunteer one day and help give out food
S0655	yeah we'd like to do that
S0653	would you like to do that yeah
S0653	that would be a very important thing to do
S0654	we could we could give out anything
S0653	well they they will have food cook and provide there or we could make something and bring it ourselves and give them out
S0654	yeah maybe we can make erm a cake for them
S0653	yeah i will at some point when we finalise all the random act of kindness we're go to do the some of them we can just do but yeah like the homeless shelter i would need to ring them and then we could talk about it and work out when we could go and visit that would brilliant i think good idea anything else that you can think of i think that perhaps i can't really think of we could erm we could babysit for somebody perhaps
S0654	i could babysit for
S0653	well that's sort of have a a sleepover
S0654	yeah
S0655	i could babysit
