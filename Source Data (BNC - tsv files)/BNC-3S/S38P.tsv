S0278	the that's it they get in a slipstream
S0012	it's er
S0278	and they use it as
S0012	yeah
S0278	fuel but you've get to have a mate in front that you know erm it you get suck along by him you see
S0012	yeah
S0278	if you if you your you use less fuel but he's get to know you're right stick up the well it's illegal anyway isn't it
S0013	it's a stupid thing to do
S0278	it's daft
S0012	it's so illegal isn't it
S0278	yeah and he know not to brake all of a sudden
S0012	well and he can't help it if
S0013	no
S0012	something happen can he
S0278	well well if

S0278	i mean
S0013	that's it isn't it
S0278	mm
S0012	well we all know not to brake all of a sudden
S0278	mm
S0012	that's not
S0013	yeah
S0012	that's not the issue be it
S0278	yeah
S0012	that's
S0013	no
S0012	tailgate be the issue
S0278	yeah
S0012	which be really stupid
S0013	that's why they tell you if you're that far back
S0278	mm
S0013	you should
S0012	two chevrons they say
S0013	yeah
S0012	we always get into that one in er near don't we
S0013	yes we do
S0012	keep two chevrons apart
S0278	mm well it's it's the same as when i'm drive you're a hundred metres
S0012	yeah
S0278	and always drive a hundred metres apart and that way it's nice and steady and you've get
S0012	it be
S0278	you do you do it it go a bite
S0013	mm
S0278	like that anyway
S0012	yeah
S0278	the whole thing be a bite elastic before you
S0012	oh yeah yeah
S0278	if you've get a hundred vehicles in a convoy it'll all go a bite elastic
S0012	yeah
S0278	but erm that's safe and it's comfortable just to
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0278	but
S0012	but they
S0278	do you know what they do to get it right for my lads cos i think we're gonna get this spot on right so no one could ever say anything i put two mark on the windscreen little mark on the windscreen
S0013	yeah
S0012	mm
S0278	and when the truck in front fit those
S0013	i see
S0278	in between those
S0013	yeah
S0278	two you're in the right
S0013	yeah right
S0012	that's great
S0278	you're a a hundred metres
S0013	that's a good idea
S0012	that's a great idea
S0278	we still we do it on the on the vehicle park er
S0013	yeah
S0278	put one vehicle at one end a hundred metres and sit in the vehicle and
S0013	yeah
S0278	it's now where be it
S0013	right
S0278	we've put two little paint mark on the screen so there you go
S0013	that's great for let you know isn't it
S0278	you're a hundred metres
S0013	yeah
S0012	that's a great idea that be
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah
S0278	mm
S0012	they all have sensors now though don't they they get sensors for everything else
S0013	it's come very quickly isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0013	now
S0012	but the trouble be if
S0013	yeah
S0012	you've get sensors and they're only go thirty miles an hour you you gotta pull out to overtake them
S0013	yeah but if it's a thirty mile limit
S0012	yeah well if that's a thirty mile limit
S0013	i mean
S0012	that's fine but if you're a long way and you're behind some silly old codger that's only do about twenty
S0278	mm
S0012	that's against the law anyway they stop people who be too
S0013	mm
S0012	too slow
S0013	yeah mm
S0278	mm mm
S0278	yeah i have one of those as well on the way back yeah
S0012	you do get them don't you every now and then
S0278	yeah yeah you do
S0012	yeah
S0278	yeah yeah yeah
S0012	but then if you've get patience that don't really
S0278	mind you all the roads where i really do think on the country roads it should be forty

S0278	it should be that should be the rule country roads
S0013	why do
S0278	forty

S0013	god you can't do it
S0012	this road they you you can do and people you know that big sharp corner down there
S0278	mm
S0012	they come down there there's the youngsters especially
S0278	mm yeah
S0012	they come down there and think that they can get round that big old sharp corner
S0278	and they go off into the leave
S0012	and they go off yeah you there's there's no end of problems
S0278	yeah
S0012	and the poor old farmer across who's who's right on the corner

S0278	with with your use your wooden chop bits and piece but this be for for the arts festival and that's what the front will look like
S0013	uhu
S0278	there's a i think that's probably about two foot high i think or something like that and they're two foot high something like that
S0012	yeah
S0013	right
S0278	but that's a board on a board yeah but there's a round tower come out from half a round tower come out with a
S0013	oh okay
S0278	a half of it and that's about the shape of the church look from the end
S0013	uhu
S0278	and i'll only have one just one window in it
S0013	right
S0278	and i've get a giant bell that will so so that that's look at it oh and er and a thermometer with the figure hundred one
S0012	yeah
S0278	a hundred and twenty thousand and then i'll mark it
S0013	right
S0278	all the way up so that we can put the red where we've get
S0013	uhu
S0278	erm and then i be gonna make it all about 3d but i think you know i'd this be silly i may as well just board that sit on a table
S0012	yeah
S0278	erm and so look down on it on on the top of it
S0013	right
S0278	there's the tower stick out it'll be it'll be on a be on another board
S0013	uhu
S0278	yeah so that i so that the flat piece the timber at the front with block of wood there go up yeah
S0013	right
S0278	and and then make the tower out of the semi circle of foam pvc just curl it round and screw it in sideways
S0278	so it'll hold you heat it up a little bite
S0012	yeah
S0278	and it'll keep its shape and that will have a window in the front just to
S0013	yeah
S0278	so er only get one one window i think and the bell will hang see by have a piece of timber come up here i can make a a right angle have a shelf bracket or something to hang i've get put the bite big bell in
S0012	yeah be you
S0278	and i've get a a really big one
S0278	and it's get and then that it's the
S0012	what and it's your bell
S0278	oh it's bigger than that it's a lovely one it will sit in it will sit in there
S0013	oh right
S0278	it will sit in there alright
S0013	so this be
S0278	no the bell be that that big heavy one
S0013	oh
S0278	and that will sit just underneath the window so when they put the money in it'll go ding each time and i might have another a flap or something or a lever or a piece of string come from the
S0013	mm
S0278	the bell bits down the side so if somebody put money in er you know paper money pull the bell pull the cord a pull cord from the outside
S0012	oh i see
S0278	you see or something like that i don't know how to do that yet i'll er i might not do that but it would be nice
S0012	so long as their money don't get catch up in the pull cord
S0278	oh well that'll come sideways somewhere but anyhow so that look down on it and that's a that's a block of wood and that's the back of it
S0012	but don't you think if if
S0013	yeah
S0012	if they're put money in and they get to do it their self that's a bite that's a bite sort of
S0278	well you can't er how be you gonna work it with a
S0013	well just
S0278	erm

S0012	if they
S0013	the coin will ring the bell

S0013	so if they didn't put any
S0278	if you want to be quiet put a quiet one they can drop one in now so it'll all drop say you imagine this be the same shape at the bottom all the money would i i think i'd put erm a biscuit tin that well would just fit that size
S0013	mm
S0278	a round one in the bottom
S0012	yeah
S0278	to collect it and i could do a flap here
S0013	oh

S0013	oh yeah oh
S0278	and that'll work or i could have another flap anywhere but you've get to pick it up
S0013	mm

S0278	and you've get oh no no
S0012	or
S0278	no foam pvc will be great
S0012	yeah
S0278	and then then er i'm gonna put erm vinyl round that
S0013	mm
S0278	then it's just gonna be grey
S0012	yeah
S0278	but up the top come down from the top i'm gonna put these sort of split like that yeah yeah
S0012	yeah that's it yeah
S0278	so so like that little flap and then that red'll gonna have a red cap on there on the top there and i think rather than cos i could do a photograph of it but that it's better just as
S0013	yeah
S0278	the model be better
S0013	yeah
S0278	isn't it
S0013	it be better
S0278	i think it's better yeah
S0013	well you can only have a photograph if if it's flat like you say
S0278	yeah
S0013	then
S0278	and that and that and then this be this
S0012	yeah
S0278	putty but i think that'll work and then that's that'll just be rough just a rough just a rough image er sort of windows like that isn't it there
S0013	well then you can do it
S0278	so
S0013	like the the
S0278	the way i get the get the i've get the shape exact
S0013	oh right
S0278	but i from the photograph off the internet
S0013	oh yeah right
S0278	and that so i've get the proportion right those proportion be right cos they're measure onto the photograph
S0013	right
S0278	someone take
S0013	really
S0278	erm and
S0012	so what's go to work your your thermometer
S0278	i just keep stick extra bits of
S0013	yeah
S0278	red tape on
S0012	oh i see
S0013	yes that's what i be just think
S0278	yeah
S0012	i think you be go to
S0278	so that that it'll be a white it would be a white the back the background i think the light light grey we need three grey really i be just wonder whether to have a light blue at the back have a sort of greeny bite around here for yeah greeny bite for tree
S0013	yeah
S0278	for tree there and then a light blue or er no just start it up here actually something like that you know that come down that greeny bite and then a light blue there yeah so you've get tree the green for the tree cos they be all around aren't they and the light blue at the top
S0013	and you could have some real greeny bits round make it like nice
S0012	yeah
S0278	mm
