S0519	turn this slightly that way oh you can't
S0520	i mean it could just be the specific taste of the coffee but it's kind of a weird there's something weird happen
S0519	erm so what i'm think be it's not even really strong be it
S0520	it's not strong at all and i put this and i do that
S0519	so no you should where should that be what's that that's that's the strength the amount of coffee
S0520	oh i think that be the groundedness of it
S0519	so keep that up no
S0520	mm
S0519	or min max
S0520	min max min max
S0519	this be how much it ground it grind it in here
S0520	yeah
S0519	so and then this be the volume
S0520	yeah
S0519	so you would put it to half and do a double and then you get two reasonably strong ones be what should happen
S0520	well that's what i do in there but
S0519	mm
S0520	i didn't have that crank up
S0519	okay but
S0520	but but i don't you know
S0519	yes
S0520	i think it's just not really if you smell the bean it's kind of a bite mm odd you know
S0519	mm i don't know erm now what in here we would have to look up on the instructioonies this be like the default set
S0520	yeah
S0519	erm and it seem to be oh
S0520	i find it with this machine in general though that it's
S0519	it's not be quite no i
S0520	it's not strong enough for me
S0519	no i agree
S0520	and doesn't have a rich flavour there's something a bite dishwatery about it and i don't think i should be like that cos it's quite a good machine
S0519	i i wonder if somebody's fiddle with that that should be more middle
S0520	naughty people
S0519	middle fadiddle let's try that next time
S0520	yeah
S0519	and i've only move it a bite that way
S0520	mm
S0519	erm so erm yeah i've be feel a little bite less satisfy with the coffee
S0520	it's just not the best be it
S0519	at in the last while so i've think
S0520	i think it be because you put be put those taylor's bean in which be english and i think maybe it's just weak english coffee
S0519	now it no mm no the taylor's should be good this be on ooh that's not all good either
S0520	i just empty the cake but they kind of spill over in there i mean bean to cup essentially should taste like erm
S0519	starbucks
S0520	well yeah exactly even better than starbucks cos it's not get all the crap in it
S0519	mm bite of storage here
S0520	mm so be dad sort the move out
S0519	he's do better and erm
S0520	you've instruct him
S0519	he be very very excite because somebody come in at about one thousand five hundred
S0520	see we have the opposite reaction don't we we're like what's wrong with that person
S0519	that's completely wrong so i tell him to ring him back up and then he realise it didn't include vat or insurance or pack
S0520	all or which you would need to include
S0519	all of which you would need to include
S0520	dad'll pack it himself no
S0519	have say that we haven't get as much or hardly much kitchen equipment and that's what a lot of the pack be about
S0520	yeah fair enough it's the small things we've get a lot of book
S0519	we have get a lot we've get a lot of book so no
S0520	but you don't have you're not peel to hoard and crowd things
S0519	chuck in bin
S0520	so you don't no chuck it erm you don't have er you know ornament and bits of what have you you know the house be quite it's basically just the bookshelves isn't it and then the whatever's in the garage
S0519	yeah and we don't actually want any of the bin bookshelves
S0520	they're from ikea since circa nineteen seventy or something
S0519	exactly
S0520	yeah
S0519	erm so er but you know what can i say yeah that look a little bite better
S0520	mm it do
S0519	it's pour more freely whereas we get a little bite of brown and then mostly white
S0520	mm the white stuff be the good stuff isn't it
S0519	that's better no the white be oh the creamy part
S0520	yeah the creamy bite
S0519	you like this in it don't you
S0520	go on
S0519	and you like sugar
S0520	sugar i've get a funny taste in my mouth from it lavazza deliver no it smell very nice in the bag
S0519	just one
S0520	yeah okay
S0519	try that
S0520	give it a go significantly improve
S0519	good somebody have
S0520	so crank it up
S0519	think they would fiddle with that and make it better because that use to always be in the middle that be like the default
S0520	and what do it do
S0519	erm it's how
S0520	that's the the groundedness
S0519	it's how big be your bean and therefore how grind do it need to be
S0520	oh
S0519	and i've always think the bean that we have be quite small
S0520	and that can make an impact can't it cos then it depend on how the water filter through
S0519	so what i do
S0520	mini bean
S0519	i
S0520	those be small bean and those be big bean
S0519	and but it's kind of say move it towards big bean or move it towards small and i move it towards small
S0520	mm mm
S0519	and i could just go a teensy bite more i don't want to overdo in one go cos i already do turn it
S0520	you could experiment with it couldn't you to set that to different settings
S0519	yeah erm and now we what have happen it be turn to more there
S0520	mm
S0519	see that's the dial thing there
S0520	and it's probably like grind them like
S0519	it wasn't it doesn't seem like we be get the full flavour out of it water be go down but nothing else be happen so i'm happy now i'm happier
S0520	happier yes
S0519	so how be you do here
S0521	so he want an extra he say it the pack would mean it be two days
S0519	yeah
S0521	because he doesn't want to try and pack everything and drive back to and store it in one day
S0520	fair deal fair deal
S0519	but what but do he understand that there's hardly any kitchen equipment
S0521	i tell him that he say it doesn't make any difference it's more to do with the distance that he's get to travel
S0519	mm
S0521	so anyway erm it turn out that er it's an extra roughly five hundred
S0519	mm
S0521	for pack
S0520	mm
S0521	erm and then he he say they they don't put the piano in a crate
S0520	mm
S0521	they just wrap it in their protective thingies
S0520	mm
S0521	and i say well look i'd rather have a crate he say well that'll be an extra hundred and forty
S0520	that's nothing
S0519	that's nothing and be it pack on it flat or on its side
S0521	yes so it it er so that would be store in the same place he say it's a warehouse at a reasonably constant temperature
S0519	reasonably
S0520	no dad
S0519	no
S0520	this be the problem reasonably be not the word
S0519	you're talk you're talk you want an air condition
S0520	not only that dehumidify
S0521	well i think
S0519	environment dehumidify you can't get the whole thing back and your furniture's damp or you know
S0521	it won't be damp
S0520	i mean it's alright if it's a
S0519	no i
S0520	well it would be in the winter
S0519	it could be look i'm
S0521	no they're not go to let the stuff go damp be they that would be a
S0519	well i don't know but reasonably constant as long as you understand
S0520	research it
S0519	exactly what he mean by that
S0521	yeah
S0519	and you know erm
S0521	well he mean that there's no there's no thermostat that they're put in there keep it at a constant temperature
S0520	that that sound dodgy to me
S0519	but at but you'd want to know wouldn't you if you're store your furniture for a long time
S0521	yeah
S0519	and your piano
S0520	mm
S0519	you know if he's say a reasonably constant that that's fair enough but what temperature be it how be the how be it control
S0520	yeah
S0521	yeah
S0519	what be the temperature and erm
S0520	and be there a damp issue
S0519	be be there you know
S0520	i mean you're talk about six months potentially that's a long time
S0519	that's right
S0521	yeah
S0519	so you know anyway you you carry on
S0519	and do you understand what the vat and all that be
S0521	yes so it's as it's as you say it's twenty percent on everything then on top of that there's twelve percent for insurance
S0519	yes but not on top of the twenty percent you can do the two separately that's what i understand you don't it's twelve percent of the removal
S0520	pre vat
S0519	not pre vat and twenty percent of the removal pre vat pre everything
S0521	yeah
S0519	so you don't have to pay vat on your insurance
S0520	so and what's
S0521	yeah yeah that'll be right yeah
S0520	and what's the total cost then
S0521	well i haven't work it all out yet but it's go to be about two thousand five hundred which be
S0519	which be back to where we be
S0521	more than the cheapest quote we've get
S0519	yeah
S0520	mm
S0519	but anyway
S0521	but i don't know anything about the cheapest quote we've get yet
S0519	no that's right at at least we know what this be
S0520	i would definitely include the erm storage condition into you research
S0521	the quality yeah
S0520	i mean i just you know
S0519	when we come to the final decision that will be really important
S0521	yeah
S0520	because the most in i mean specially with an instrument even if it require that you do get it separately and stay with you know keep the cheaper deal but do the piano separately
S0521	we could do that yeah
S0520	the piano be go to suffer in an environment that's not very strictly control
S0521	no that's right you need
S0520	can't be get cold and warm all the time
S0519	you need a piano specialist and a and a special environment for the piano or somebody who be guarantee you
S0520	who know what they're do yeah
S0519	what that like pickford's say they send a piano specialist to the job on the day and they pack it and it go to the same
S0520	how much be pickford's
S0519	we don't know yet they can't reply till tomorrow
S0521	they're go to give us a quote
S0520	i just like it when people you know we've get it cover we know about piano's we send an expert that's this be music to one's ears
S0521	yeah
S0519	to one's ears to one's music to one's piano
S0521	it be er
S0519	what be you do with the earphones on
S0520	as well
S0521	oh have i not
S0519	cos it
S0521	sorry
S0519	you can still hear it you've get a big thing on your head
S0520	it's a tiny erm
S0521	that's a little bite that's a little but daft isn't it
S0520	difference it be in the jack
S0519	yes i know
S0520	it be just you know like it's just that extra
S0519	i know that
S0521	need an extra push
S0519	i've do it that the children want to have a little play and i couldn't make it turn on and it be cos it wasn't quite it the whole headphones weren't in just the little end piece
S0521	yeah
S0519	and i couldn't i hadn't notice it so er then eventually i pull it out
S0521	oh that's right yeah
S0520	it's ideal isn't it if you've erm and bang on there
S0521	yeah there you go it look it look like it's go two three thousandish maybe a little bite more
S0520	yeah
S0521	for the total pack
S0519	three to four thousand
S0521	yeah
S0519	erm it
S0520	well that's sound erm
S0519	it's a lot of money
S0521	it sound
S0520	well no
S0519	have dad tell you what his original estimate be
S0520	to be fair i'm not really surprise by these things
S0519	i'm not but
S0520	i mean it's
S0519	but guess what dad's original estimate for removals be
S0520	i don't know five hundred or something
S0519	three hundred
S0520	three hundred
S0521	thirty five quid i think
S0520	a tenner you do wonder why it have to cost that much but i guess the storage be i mean be the storage the main expense or be it the erm removals that's more expensive
S0521	the storage well he he he's quote thirty two a week for the storage
S0520	warehouse be really not my favourite word but
S0519	it's not mine either
S0520	i just imagine like some horrible dilapidate build
S0521	so they're go to with the storage company be offer a room
S0519	dehumidify and
S0521	which be basically the size of a double garage
S0519	yeah it's these company where you get you have constant access
S0521	there's the instant access
S0520	purpose build storage be what i would mm
S0519	it be purpose mm that be erm this warehouse here
S0520	some dilapidate factory in somewhere
S0521	you're very sceptical aren't you
S0520	i'm sceptical of people that don't that say things like approximately the same temperature
S0519	warehouse roughly it'll be alright don't you worry mate
S0520	it'll be alright that's not really scottish accent be it
S0521	seven forty two
S0519	jack the lad be on the case
S0520	what be you do be you on excel or something
S0519	i'm on excel copy my formula down fifty nine million time
S0520	i want you to have an excel lesson with do he'll he'll just
S0521	so here i be try to do my stuff and it just
S0519	he'll sort me won't he
S0520	he's like the king of shortcuts
S0519	oh i love him
S0521	the erm
S0520	he hat watch me use the computer cos i faff faff about and ramble around on it
S0519	right
S0520	he doesn't like use the mouse
S0521	i once have a computer that i could use more or less at er
S0519	at
S0520	you should just have one each it's not really an issue
S0521	now it's er you know i i can have an hour in between the
S0519	i'm have a i might have a macbook air be what i'm think
S0520	if you just get yourself a macbook air
S0519	as long as i don't have to pay
S0521	you could you could have my dad's actually if you want it
S0519	well at the moment all of us well i i don't know i suppose do he use it
S0521	no he doesn't i discuss it with him i say what about dad's computer he say do you want it
S0520	mm also that blue one that i be use i mean if you just want a word processor
S0521	the blue one
S0520	do you remember the blue one do i have the blue one last time
S0521	i'm not sure about the blue one
S0520	i do have the blue one last time i have this little blue computer that be basically like virtually no specs whatsoever but it be natty little thing and it have it's really thin and light and it's ideal for kind of but yeah you should just get a proper one you should definitely have one each cos there's a bite of competitive er rivalry go on specially now that mum be treasure for the er
S0521	okay this treasure seem to be
S0521	a job that grow by the minute
S0520	treasure
S0521	you'll be get an obe for it soon
S0520	obe
S0521	service above and beyond the call of industry
S0520	mm what be you do
S0519	something weird happen to my copy two people get miss out how can that be
S0520	copy paste be an incredibly unreliable method of do things i find
S0519	and another one
S0520	you get in trouble very easily
S0521	just spell trouble
S0520	just spell trouble so be feds any good last night then
S0521	feds
S0520	or be he crumble in the face of
S0521	well he start off a bite shaky i mean it seem like he be nervous or something and then
S0520	mm
S0521	and then he lose the first set just so it could have go either way and then the second set he have this purple spell where he be make these huge shots
S0520	purple
S0521	and everybody say oh federer's back
S0520	mm
S0521	but he didn't really keep up the standard
S0520	his confidence be wan maybe
S0521	yeah well he be always as little bite like that to be honest it be almost like he only just be good enough to beat somebody
S0520	not like completely domineer yeah
S0521	he have this huge he have this great knack of be able to just raise his standards
S0520	pull it out of the bag yeah i remember that
S0519	just once in a every five it's not do the formula i've get to go through them all and check that the formula be there
S0520	baffle
S0519	ridiculous thing
S0521	once in every five
S0519	seriously i've get control v all the way down and i've get a
S0521	be you serious be you serious
S0520	be you sure that that be the most efficient method
S0519	it's the only one dad can tell me
S0520	dad
S0521	what
S0520	control v all the way down the column like be there not can you not teach it to
S0519	you can write a macro or something but you know
S0520	make a macro yeah
S0519	whatever macro smacro
S0520	yeah
S0519	erm so that's not very good be it
S0520	mm
S0519	load of people haven't pay
S0520	i think you should revolutionise the system get strict reminder email and stuff that's what we've do
S0519	mm
S0520	friendly but more
S0519	do you do them all one group or cos i do them all in the group
S0519	it be only three people but i just think come on it's three people and you're three month late you can have a group email then you know it's just you three
S0520	well just bcc oh well you could do bcc that's not really the
S0519	i don't care i think come on do it
S0520	no i'm sure they don't mind either but yeah
S0519	right retreat you have not pay
S0520	so have you see this picture of the new labour leader with all these dancers dad be that in the time as well
S0521	who
S0520	on the front of the guardian today there be a picture of this guy corbyn
S0521	corbyn
S0520	with these with these three young lady dancers
S0521	his cohorts
S0520	no
S0521	oh
S0520	he's just go to meet some dancers it's a bizarre picture on like the first day of the leadership you know just like ladies in kind of scampy clothe do some kind of a dance that he'd meet it be a very funny picture to have like
S0521	yes
S0520	to you know to kick off your reputation it be on the front of the guardian it be quite funny
S0521	okay guardian be leave wing isn't it
S0520	yeah it's a labour paper
S0521	they should be they should be please with him should they or
S0520	erm i haven't really read anything interest to be honest i think people be a bite confuse and erm i'm not sure if the guardian really know what kind of a stand it want to take on on the whole thing i mean it's a leave wing newspaper always have be but erm there's leave wing and there's leave wing as they say
S0521	yes
S0520	i be chat to some people about it in the train station it be quite funny erm they come and sit at the table when i be wait and
S0521	today
S0520	i have a paper in front of my with a picture of him
S0521	yeah
S0520	so we start chat about it and she be actually a quite smart lady liberal democrat
S0521	oh yeah
S0520	and er her and her husband so we be discuss whether what the implications be
S0521	well i hear the lim dems the lib dems be spot and opportunity cos labour party would self destruct and therefore they
S0520	they would become the second party
S0521	would be the de facto er de facto leave wing party
S0520	i don't yeah it's a possible scenario i guess i'm not sure about self destruct
S0521	yeah
S0520	but it seem to be one of the potentials
S0521	one of the yeah one of the outcomes one of the scenarios
S0520	we be well we wonder whether it would signal like a kind of swing to the leave overall you now whether it be symptomatic of a like a spirit of the young generation or whether it be less profound than that
S0521	yes the analysis i saw be that the nobody trust the labour party to handle the economy
S0520	mm
S0521	in the election anyway so whatever the of course that's be always the always the challenge that the labour party be full of socialist ideas but they can never pay for it
S0520	mm
S0521	so i don't think that's change
S0520	well it's quite a big question it's like where the most voters i think aren't that bother about politics be they what they're bother about be pay back their mortgage and erm you know feel financially secure
S0521	yeah
S0520	and erm have affordable house and education you know things that have an immediate impact on their life you know but the general political scene be not of interest to them
S0521	no i think you're right
S0520	so i just wonder whether such a person can really gain voters because it's very base on idealistic ideas isn't it
S0521	idealistic exactly
S0520	mm i'm not sure i don't see it happen particularly
S0521	i read robert peston's analysis of erm quantitative ease for the people
S0520	who's robert peston
S0521	which be what corbyn have recommend and he say it's complete garbage
S0520	who be he be he a time guy as well
S0521	he's a bbc economics expert
S0520	mm okay
S0521	so quantitative ease be basically where a bank generate a little bite of cash in a very control way because if if they overdo it then the market react by say that they're just invent money
S0520	mm
S0521	which be essentially what corbyn be say he say let the bank generate a lot of money so that we can build school and railways and hospitals
S0520	mm
S0521	doesn't make any sense cos nobody's pay for it so
S0520	well how can it just be that
S0521	what do you mean
S0520	how can it be that unviable do you know what i mean like surely he's be hold to task by someone
S0521	he be that's why people think that he's in cloud cuckoo land
S0520	that he's a looper
S0521	but they don't evidently cos they vote for him i i i think this
S0520	maybe it's more what he symbolise i don't know
S0521	it's idealistic and symbolic and all just a protest vote and all of those sort of things
S0520	mm
S0521	i think do you see what blair say
S0520	no
S0521	blair say before the election actually take place he say er if you're emotionally attach to his ideas you probably need a heart transplant which be very tactful of him
S0520	oh gosh i i imagine they're probably like personal enemies or something though
S0521	possibly
S0520	because you know blair be the one who do everything
S0521	but er mr blair be hold to task for
S0520	it's not very constructive be it within your own party mm
S0521	yeah
S0520	interest
S0521	anyway er twelve twenty plus vat at twenty percent when i saw the number come in he say it'll cost seven hundred and twelve pound
S0520	mm
S0521	i think wow that's cheap and then you get er that be only for remove when you add some more on for storage add more on for vat you add more on for insurance
S0520	then they just chuck it on the street
S0521	you add more on for the piano then suddenly you're up to three thousand
S0520	it's like a book with easyjet
S0521	yes it be a bite yeah
S0520	so that excite feel follow by a series of disappointments ooh it's twelve ninety nine and if you if you want to check in that'll cost you another hundred quid
S0521	it's yeah
S0520	mm i quite hate that method of advertise actually
S0521	me too
S0520	like be there any need whatsoever to advertise price prior to vat
S0521	well the americans do that that's
S0520	mm they love it
S0521	we use to get and even and even if you you know it happen we still get surprise they put quote everything without tax
S0520	yeah so strange and then erm menus and stuff you know they do that in europe as well you know you read the whole menu and then right in the bottom there's like a tiny little sentence price you know not still subject to vat so you get the bill and they and they whack on another twenty percent it's not that
S0521	that's right
S0519	mm mm
S0520	jolly any more be it
S0519	no
S0520	mm
S0519	right i just need to take those things because that be really a bite scary okay they have pay
