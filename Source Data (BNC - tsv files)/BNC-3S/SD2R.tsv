S0013	i don't think you're gonna catch anything off me or don't you know i reckon it'll be alright
S0152	no you're not gonna catch anything off you
S0013	i don't want to
S0012	i think i oh i've gotta put record now ain't i
S0013	give you a bad cold or anything
S0012	cos that's only the chapter two insert there off we go
S0152	yeah so it's er somebody that i work with basically say this girl could have the two days holiday so they put the holiday form in it come to me and i look at it and i i say well she's get an exam on the on the monday i know she might have you know almost a hundred percent attendance and the woman say well i be tell that she could do the exam again well that's a cost implication of somebody not take the exam so it's a cost implication to the to the school so i i speak to the deputy mr sorry and er he say no mark it down as one day unauthorized and one day holiday
S0012	oh right
S0152	so the mum so i speak to the lady who have say about that it be okay so then the mum phone up and say er i speak about it three weeks ago and say it be alright i say i'm sorry but those be the rule i you know i've speak to somebody this be what they've say
S0013	mm
S0152	and she say well what do it mean unauthorized i say it mean that we're not authorize your daughter's day off from school right but what do it mean it mean we're not we're not authorize it so it's not have a code in there it'll have a code in there which will go against her attendance well why can't it be authorize i say even if i authorize your day off as holiday it still go against your daughter's attendance so it doesn't make it doesn't make any difference
S0012	no
S0152	it's still it's still gonna be you know it's still gonna be an absence whichever way you do it so she be a bite oh that's not fair i'd have do something different and i think no you wouldn't you'd have take your daughter in any case
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0152	cos you've get it book
S0012	yeah
S0152	you know so oh i just leave it i leave it at that and she be oh in she be alright in the end and then another girl come to see me about i've get a meet with er her parent tomorrow and er she just doesn't wanna come to school
S0012	no
S0152	so i so i i've not meet her before and she turn up at my desk on friday and she go i've come to see you er okay tell me who she be and er i put a few facts to her i you know i just speak to her normally i say look i say i don't think you actually realize that you've get ten weeks leave that's all you've get ten weeks
S0013	yeah gosh
S0152	i say your attendance be run at seventy nine percent she say well if i'm here every day until i finish will my attendance be a hundred percent
S0012	oh gawd
S0013	oh
S0152	mm no i say it won't actually be a hundred percent i say but it will go up i say it'll go up probably if you're here for the next ten weeks here every day it will go up by five percent so you'll be at eighty five percent which be far better than it be
S0013	mm
S0152	at seventy nine percent i say you don't understand that do you and she go not really no so i say look if you start in september and you're here for the full week i say five days at school equal a hundred percent
S0012	a hundred percent yeah
S0152	if you're here for the second week at school ten days of school equal a hundred percent so you can see her mind go over i say but if you have a day off in those two weeks it go down to ninety percent this be the easiest way i can
S0013	yeah
S0152	put it to you i say er if you have if you er if you be here for three weeks but have a day off in those three weeks it would go to something like ninety five percent and i work it all out for her
S0012	yeah
S0152	so i say that that's the way that it work so the more days you're here the better your er your attendance i say but what we can do i say be we can say right you're back in school now and we'll look at your attendance from now through to when you leave and then we can say you've have a hundred percent attendance from this date
S0013	right
S0152	to this date yeah we know your attendance be bad
S0012	beforehand
S0152	before i say but you have show an improvement
S0013	yeah that sound
S0012	yeah
S0013	good then doesn't it
S0152	and she and she look and she go thank you and then she come back twice and cos and then she say what about court and i think oh okay i say er where's court come in all this well i've be tell that if i don't go to school my mum's gonna go to court i say yeah that's true
S0013	yeah
S0152	i say but i don't really think that's very fair on your mum when it's you that be that be say as a sixteen year old i'm not come to school
S0012	that's right
S0152	i say but your mum will get the fine your mum could have the fine of two and a half thousand pound
S0013	mm
S0152	i say or a month in prison if your mum can't pay it i say that's that's what they can do
S0012	yeah
S0013	that's terrible ain't it
S0152	and she look and she say would they i say er yeah that's they do and i just i just think to myself they won't push it she's year eleven get ten weeks to go the time you've get your court date in they won't push it
S0012	no they won't no mm
S0152	it'll be somebody in year ten they'll push or something but i weren't gonna say that to her and she say oh i say look i say you know i say i wouldn't be happy if it be one of my daughters i say but from what i gather you give your mum a lot of grief why all she's do be be a a parent tell you you've gotta go to school
S0012	yeah
S0152	yeah yeah i say do you want an easier life or do you want it a hard life where you're argue all the time cos it's cos what i've pick up on two conversations with your mum that's what's happen and your mum's get tire of it and be go to the doctor
S0013	mm

S0013	no
S0152	cold on not heat
S0013	mm
S0012	oh be you
S0152	yeah you should
S0012	a cold compress
S0152	yeah you shouldn't put anything hot on it any more it's er it's er
S0013	really
S0152	yeah which be
S0013	oh
S0152	interest concept because if you think of years ago if you injure yourself you put the deep heat on or you
S0013	mm
S0152	pull something the idea be
S0013	loosen the muscle then

S0152	you put ice on
S0012	mm

S0012	position they seem to they seem to relish in the position they're in and then they well i dunno
S0013	mm
S0152	i think you're right when er huh you say about parent er hm er hm it be very much about what or where people live
S0012	where people live come into it quite a bite don't it yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	because if they see it happen around them
S0012	yeah
S0152	then it become the norm
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	so therefore that's what you do
S0012	that's what you do yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	but it's also like hm er it's a it's a culture thing isn't it a culture
S0013	mm
S0012	it be a culture thing trouble be
S0013	i mean you you say from go to school that you be never give the the even think that you could go on to further education
S0012	never
S0013	or anything
S0012	never give the chance
S0013	leave school early
S0012	didn't even know there be a further education
S0013	whereas it be push my school you go on to do
S0152	but be that because again back to that area
S0013	well mm
S0012	i don't know but we be expect as a secondary school to take up not the academics
S0152	the the apprenticeship route
S0012	but the apprenticeship route and when when you be fifteen you leave school and work a year before you get your apprenticeship so we have to work a year to see if you be any good
S0152	yeah
S0012	and if you be any good you er you get an apprenticeship
S0152	get offer an apprenticeship
S0012	i mean it didn't cost anything
S0013	but you weren't give load of options be you
S0012	we be give no options no
S0152	i don't think you i
S0013	no
S0152	but go back i don't think the options be there as such
S0012	well the point be i don't think the people who have er like the you have the these people come round and interview you not interview you talk to you about your future and your job
S0152	career people
S0012	the career people i don't think they have any idea because they have their career they didn't give two monkey about other people
S0013	mm
S0012	especially what they look at as second class citizens
S0152	yeah but at your but at that point in time all the people with certain level qualifications end up work at norwich union
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	and on the on the other side you have people go either into work at carters or laurence and scott
S0013	mm
S0012	yes that's right yeah
S0152	or autowrappers be autowrappers
S0012	yeah autowrappers
S0152	autowrappers
S0012	heatrae
S0152	heatrae there be job that
S0013	yeah or matthews turkeys
S0152	yeah
S0012	british tin box company the
S0013	mm
S0152	you know you have er you have those people fill those job there so there be never that issue
S0012	yeah
S0152	of you have what you have smiths crackers didn't you
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0152	cos that be people
S0013	on rotation
S0012	yeah
S0152	um
S0012	you work there didn't you
S0152	start rite
S0013	i do part time
S0152	start rite shoe
S0012	yeah well there be i tell you the shoe factories in norwich be enormous there be norfolk start rite er clarks there be load absolutely load of shoe factories in norwich plus there be that great big um courtaulds factory as well
S0152	mhm
S0012	a huge courtaulds factory then all of a sudden they're go well what happen to all these people just like the steel work up in corby and all that they're just chuck out aren't they shame but then we have the chance i mean when when we be young when i be young when i'd do my apprenticeship i could walk into any job and demand well not demand but ask er the pay i want
S0152	yeah
S0012	and either they give it to you or they didn't and there be so much work about
S0152	mm
S0012	load of work about
S0152	but if you look at what work be available now
S0013	mm
S0152	it's all shop work
S0012	well it's all service industry
S0152	it's all it's service industries
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	i mean
S0013	yeah
S0152	that's all that be er be around unless you go into these little industrial villages type thing
S0012	yeah
S0152	where people take some more people on
S0013	mm
S0012	that's right
S0152	you know um
S0012	but i mean this be this be half the reason half the people er leave the countryside and go to huge cities because they think they'll be able to get job better i mean you think about the countryside and how many people work on farm in the sixties and seventies even
S0152	yeah
S0012	which isn't that long ago and now you get one farmer and a boy to a couple of hundred acres of land
S0152	machinery have
S0012	yeah
S0152	take over hasn't it
S0012	yeah
S0152	and the way you farm things make er make it easier
S0012	yep yeah
S0152	make it easier
S0012	but that use to be good that use to be good but now uh i i feel so sorry for the kid nowadays
S0152	well they huh they don't take on board what you tell them some of them
S0012	no
S0152	you know i i don't need this qualification
S0012	well that's true yeah
S0152	but you do need the qualification
S0012	yeah
S0152	no i don't you don't know me um i might not know you but i know full well that you need the piece of paper that open a door
S0012	yeah
S0152	otherwise you're just gonna end up do nothing
S0012	yeah
S0152	which be why which be what i've witness
S0012	well er
S0152	recently
S0012	well you have you've have quite a lot of experience in kid haven't you all them years work
S0152	yeah
S0012	but as you say they don't they don't take on in on board the advice any more
S0152	you know and when you say to them look you know you're not the first person that have have turn round and say you don't care i say but you're not won't be the first person that in five years time or ten years time or fifteen years time will turn round and say i wish i'd have try at school
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	i say because the majority of people that at your stage five ten fifteen it will happen you'll say you wish you'd have try when you realize you're not get everything that you want
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	what i felt like say be but in some case you'll nick what you want so
S0012	well that's true
S0013	oh dear
S0012	that be true
S0013	huh
S0012	in some case that that's what they do and last resort let's face it they go onto drug
S0152	mm you know you know if if i'm sorry but if parent know that their child be take drug shouldn't something be do about it huh
S0012	well i should've think so yeah
S0152	but it's okay for him to do it at weekend as long as he doesn't during the week
S0152	that's the attitude of one family
S0012	hm
S0152	that i've hear of recently
S0013	really
S0012	what
S0152	yeah
S0013	huh gosh
S0152	because it's er because again it's in this area
S0013	yeah
S0152	that's where it all happen from
S0012	yeah
S0152	and you're think to yourself this be not
S0012	it's not good be it
S0152	it's not good
S0013	they just they don't care do they
S0152	you know
S0013	parent just don't care
S0152	it's like it's like drink
S0013	yeah

S0012	sixteen years old dear oh dear i can't remember what they do whether whether they be angry or not
S0152	but you but you
S0013	didn't need to be
S0152	no but you but you learn from it
S0012	you do
S0152	but unfortunately youngsters at the moment don't learn from that experience
S0012	no because they dare each other to do some more

S0012	that's the trouble where you get peer pressure
S0152	yeah
S0012	oh i can have i can drink this and i can drink that

S0013	yeah
S0012	we have a

S0152	i er pff
S0013	mm
S0152	i don't know what it be
S0012	no i that that seem to have seem to go on over over the top don't it in these recent years but then you gotta blame half of the stuff on on er the power that be
S0152	mm
S0012	for allow it to happen in the first place i mean the police can't do anything when i be a kid if you be drink in the street they'd have you for drink and disorderly
S0152	yeah just think how many people would be do on a saturday night now
S0012	yeah but if they'd have carry that on there wouldn't have be so many now would there if they just instead of let them let them walk the streets
S0152	mm
S0012	absolutely blotto and piss break windows and pee up wall and stuff like that
S0013	you see the pubs use to close early
S0012	yeah they use to close at eleven o'clock

S0013	mm
S0012	but i mean that's only recently that the they've have pubs open all the time
S0152	but it's make no difference
S0012	that's make no difference at all no
S0152	i think in some respect that side of it apart from the number of pubs close down because there isn't the money around that bit's alright it's this it's this binge drink on a

S0152	who be the academies accountable to
S0013	mm
S0012	well that's true yeah who be they
S0152	be be they accountable to the government
S0013	mm
S0152	because the government have allow them to become academies
S0012	academies yeah
S0152	or be they accountable to their sponsor
S0013	right
S0152	which isn't the government it's their sponsor be their sponsor then accountable to the government so who's in charge so where do you get the accountability

S0152	nothing to do with them
S0012	nothing at all to do with them
S0152	nothing to do
S0012	that be that be a think that be ain't it yeah
S0152	and you you kind of think that you know here's a person that be work for an academy have be an adviser in one of the academies who be who be tweet that out
S0012	yeah the trouble be you see the people that be work within the the academies be get so much money they just don't care
S0152	they don't care you know i have a i have a text this week from somebody from oba academy say that they cannot buy anything they cannot buy anything they can't do any er they've get no money
S0013	mm
S0012	how do you work that one out
S0152	and what they're say be it's all because the er predecessor school have a deficit budget predecessor school have a deficit budget but it have nothing to do with the oba budget
S0012	no
S0152	because it be wipe clean on the thirty first of august
S0013	right
S0152	when it become an academy that deficit budget be share amongst all the other school within the
S0013	mm
S0152	county
S0012	yeah yeah
S0152	so they all get a little bite less to cover that budget
S0013	mm
S0012	well
S0152	you know and when you take all the school though it well it didn't work out to be that much but some head be say it do but but this oba be say they have no money so they can't do things
S0013	tut
S0152	which
S0013	mm
S0152	you know where that's gonna lead to that's gonna lead to say
S0013	yeah
S0152	we've gotta cut some more staff
S0012	well yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	yeah yeah and even more good teachers'll go down to the
S0013	yeah
S0012	er the great teacher pit and what'll happen they'll have teachers that can't teach
S0152	oh well er what will will happen be they'll have teachers in there for two years three years then they'll be burn out because of the pressure they've be put under or the way they've be treat
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0152	and some will end up with nervous breakdowns some will end up not carry um on in teach where that's where they need to be
S0012	yeah
S0152	and some people will will move on to do something else
S0013	mm
S0152	and they'll keep the cost down by have lot of nqt teachers in for three or four years where they don't have to
S0013	mm
S0152	pay them a certain amount of money
S0012	yeah that's that's what i mean
S0013	or parent do some bite of voluntary work to help out
S0152	yeah
S0013	mm tut
S0012	do they still use parent in academies or not

S0013	mm
S0152	you don't want you don't want people who care in school in academies
S0013	mm
S0012	well that's right er it er it's like the the nurse nurse and they they use to have a vocation now they've just get a job and they've only just get that job so they that's not a vocational job any more it's just a job that they have to do day in and day out cos they don't get any appreciation for it

S0152	but er so you're gonna take it off your other sit then
S0012	well we i be go to do a freesat one but if i get this this er booster i'll that'll probably work off the freeview again cos we get a freeview recorder you see
S0152	yeah you say freesat
S0012	yeah that
S0152	why do you need a freesat recorder
S0012	well
S0152	when you've already get one
S0012	we we get we haven't get freesat recorder at all we get a freeview recorder
S0152	so why don't you put get a freesat recorder then

S0012	that crack that keep go kr kr
S0152	mm
S0012	don't it
S0013	but at the moment we don't know why
S0012	no cos we can watch free freeview and that's fine but as soon as it come to record it
S0152	sound like the hard drive's go down
S0012	yeah
S0013	it's no but it's just bbc mainly isn't it

S0012	all over the house any more
