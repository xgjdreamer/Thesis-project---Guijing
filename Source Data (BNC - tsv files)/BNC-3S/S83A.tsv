S0655	yeah
S0653	yeah and i saw you try the club as well
S0655	yeah i try to juggle with two club but it just hurt
S0653	i think you just need to practise with one because the
S0654	what club
S0653	the plastic
S0654	oh yeah
S0653	things where they're sort of wider at one end than the other
S0655	yeah but they be they be the
S0653	they're very tricky aren't they
S0655	they be the hardest things to juggle
S0654	there be three things which be the hardest things to juggle knife
S0653	right
S0655	knives
S0654	fire stick
S0653	yeah
S0654	and hoop because hoop
S0655	no club
S0653	club
S0655	they're they're harder
S0654	yeah and hoop because
S0653	club
S0654	i always think hoop because
S0653	oh the little ring you mean oh okay
S0655	i juggle with two of them
S0653	okay
S0654	because you could
S0655	i juggle with two of them
S0654	no because if you juggle with more of them you could cut your finger so
S0655	no they're make of plastic
S0653	i don't yeah i think you would with knives but not with not with little ring
S0655	well you can kill yourself if you juggle knives
S0653	i know
S0655	so you've get to be pretty and
S0654	and fire
S0653	you've gotta be pretty confident yeah
S0655	yeah
S0653	and fire
S0655	and fire you go da da da da da
S0654	remember the remember the
S0653	guy in circus wonderland
S0653	what be he do
S0654	he be rid on a motor
S0655	not a motorcycle
S0654	a unicycle
S0654	and he be juggle three knives and he be rid er a six foot tall unicycle
S0653	yes i know
S0655	that be pretty good multitasking
S0653	it be good multitasking but with at least with fire you can protect yourself you can coat your skin with something that protect you a little bite whereas knives you don't get any protection but yes the
S0655	wear damp clothe
S0654	you do get protection
S0653	that's not gonna from knives
S0655	no from
S0654	not
S0655	fire
S0653	yeah but i be just say that you can protect yourself against fire but not really so much
S0654	you can protect your erm your things from fire wear load and load and load and load and load and load of clothe
S0653	you can't protect yourselves from knives be what i'm say
S0654	i say knife knives because it
S0653	you can't because your hand have get to be free haven't they they've get to be out of the glove so yes you could protect your chest but it's not really your chest that's gonna get hurt be it come and sit down
S0655	okay
S0653	sorry
S0654	it's your head
S0653	your face oh i think you would be very unlikely to get them near your face if you be if you be already a very good juggler but club be difficult because they've get different sort of weight heavier at one end than the other aren't they so you have to really work out the balance of of have of around so but there be some people do amaze juggle today weren't there
S0654	yeah they juggle with like
S0655	yeah
S0654	six things
S0655	but the person who be juggle the club be the best
