S0179	i actually didn't understand a word of that um the fact that someone do be slightly disconcert to me
S0058	it's about moby who be i don't know why he have a problem with moby he's an electronic artist
S0179	who's this chap
S0058	eminem you know eminem
S0179	oh i be think moby but actually yes

S0058	yeah ha ha i be about to say it's so lucky it spell cheese ha erm
S0179	it's interest in friends though because they mock cos it's quite clever a lot of it but they but but they seem to mock cos well they don't mock ross for be intelligent necessarily they're mock him for be an academic
S0058	yeah well yeah i mean academia be mock yeah which i guess be different yeah cos they mock joey for be stupid
S0179	exactly
S0058	so i guess yeah that it's not intelligent it's the fact that he choose to use that in a particular way
S0179	yeah
S0058	i mean it be quite funny be a palaeontologist like that be moderately reasonable it's just when they mock academia generally and when they they sort of fall asleep i mean he's tell them about anything he's do it's a bite like well
S0179	nice friends
S0058	pardon yeah exactly yeah
S0179	in all fairness he be a pain in the arse
S0058	yeah and maybe it's just like in um
S0179	as in you should realise that you don't you may well be interest in the detail of his work
S0058	yeah no well if if he say i'm get a paper publish they're all like yeah yeah yeah
S0179	no no they're interest in that but when he's actually say what be in it
S0058	mm anyway in all fairness like in um what's that film with hugh grant notting hill they mock the guy who's the worst stockbroker in the world that's maybe because he's bad at it rather than because he's a stockbroker
S0179	yes exactly that be quite funny

S0179	yes i'm very health and safety conscious
S0058	except when you pour salt and the top come off of the salt cellar
S0179	yeah oh there's so many things that annoy me so much about the health and safety it's like there's so many things be inherently very dangerous that you let people do and on the other hand some things aren't dangerous but you massively object to like put like keep like but no they wouldn't like it if they know i have a personal supply of plaster
S0058	yeah no you're not allow to
S0179	someone just nick my hand with like a wire cutter why do that need to go in an accident book

S0179	i don't mind that this happen
S0058	yeah
S0179	if i be self harm
S0058	yeah
S0179	then maybe that's a separate issue but
S0058	if you're not bother yeah
S0179	yeah
S0058	okay
S0179	right um um
S0058	oh escape
S0179	brilliant okey dokey
S0058	yes er
S0179	um tomatoes olives or anchovies oh not anchovies

S0091	i'd be a bite careful
S0179	mm
S0058	thank you
S0179	oh that lettuce be aggressively crisp
S0058	hmm hmm
S0179	seriously it's like a structural element to the sandwich
S0058	nice i can hear it
S0179	mm
S0058	mm quite nice
S0179	so we be walk through town centre last friday
S0058	um
S0179	yeah it would have be last friday
S0058	okay
S0179	and we be mean to go to this erm fish scottish fish restaurant call but we hadn't book and when we turn up they didn't have any table leave so we end up just sort of wander about and we we go to an iranian restaurant
S0091	a a what
S0179	an iranian restaurant
S0091	mm mm
S0179	which be different
S0058	it be really good but one of those things you never expect to end up do
S0179	mm
S0058	but it be it be nice it be a bite like greek food
S0091	and what do you have there
S0058	um
S0179	um be it
S0058	we have er for starter it be kind of um bread and dip and things like that and then we have two they be both chicken dish i think
S0179	mm
S0058	um but it's not like indian food it wasn't hot at all it be just sort of lot of herbs
S0179	mm
S0058	and it be like serve with rice but it be it be really nice
S0179	mm and then my personal favourite saffron ice cream
S0058	hmm
S0179	which be bizarre you couldn't have very much of it it be very sweet
S0179	i think i might have one of these it be sort of like eat gold
S0058	yeah hmm hmm extreme
S0179	ice gold in fact ar oh dear um oh that remind me um after lunch i've get something to show you from work um i've be do a lot of electronics recently much to my sort of against my will but um i've be do all sort and like i now know er my solder have be improve no end and and crimp and what not but um we've get this er i've get this thing on my ipad which you can design circuit electronically and sort of look at how they're behave
S0091	oh
S0179	it's really cool
S0058	mm what to have next mm
S0179	hmm that's really good
S0058	one of those or ham mm i don't know if i want another one of those salmon ones
S0179	okay
S0058	do you want another roast chicken one or
S0179	um pick choose whatever you want i'll go with the flow
S0058	wouldn't mind a ham one be it be it a shame to open it or just go for it
S0179	go for it
S0179	mm cos what we're do at the moment be essentially it's design what i can only describe as a crossbow um as in it accelerate a um it's actually for an injector um so we're look at how a needle array interact um with human skin we're actually use pig skin because it be easier to get hold of um as in the local butcher didn't have much human skin
S0058	strange that
S0179	um but we're fire this needle array at a target at the skin it's from eight metres a second which be all about thirty miles an hour and the only way we could get it to do that be by have massive spring so and sort of crank it back so it be essentially a cross bow um
S0058	nice
S0179	hmm there's the risk assessment form be go to be hilarious
S0058	be it a very small cross bow
S0179	it's not actually a cross bow
S0058	i know but
S0179	it's sort of about this big
S0058	oh okay quite big then
S0179	mm it's move pretty fast
S0091	and what part do you take play it
S0179	target
S0058	i be gonna say i'm not involve stay well away
S0179	mm mm i mean just imagine your team try to pull this off you know you'd be quite scar
S0058	yeah
S0179	i'm quite scar that we're do it
S0179	cos it's gonna take in total erm about fifty kilos of force to cock this which be pretty big
S0058	mm about me
S0179	mm
S0058	i'll just sit on the end of it for you
S0179	it wouldn't exactly work actually we could probably rig up a pulley so that that do work
S0058	that'd be a lot of effort but not a lot of er realistic gain
S0179	mm i'm not sure which one to have now
S0058	so there's ham salmon chicken
S0179	i think i might have a second chicken if it's alright
S0058	yeah it's fine
S0179	mm and your um your sister's come to stay with us for a week
S0058	mm yeah um my sister's go be do some work experience in my office so she be

S0091	be she older or younger
S0058	younger yeah she's twenty two
S0179	i take it you're go to be boss her around
S0058	ha ha yeah that's gonna be fun mm mm i'll essentially be her manager
S0179	mm she's currently at university at leeds
S0091	oh as a pupil or teach

S0091	oh
S0058	she's um as an undergraduate yeah

S0058	what do she think she want to do
S0091	what
S0058	what do she think she want to do yeah
S0091	mm

S0179	she's a little bite what you call work shy
S0179	um
S0058	but she she might find that she really like publish
S0179	if there's a lot of tea and cake i suspect she'll love it
S0058	mm mm
S0179	oh dear
S0058	huh huh don't worry i'll er i'll keep her busy get lot of task
S0179	could we not just employ her in the house as a domestic servant
S0058	no fewer transferable skills

S0058	bakewell
S0179	bakewell erm and it's get erm it's eight miles long so we do there and back sixteen miles total well at least two of us do um and er one of our friends erm have to stop due to feet relate issue so we then two of us walk back to the car and drive to pick them up erm er because we be so kind and generous
S0058	mm
S0179	um but um it be a bite of a problem cos there be one of the feature of this walk be that there's load of really long tunnel um which be obviously from the disused line er but then during the day they're light erm with strip light in the ceiling erm but they're not at night and there's big sign say light go off at dusk do not enter when the tunnel be dark and we be halfway through one of the tunnel when the light go out
S0058	scary
S0179	yeah it be terrify erm fortunately i know where my torch be um er um so that be all okay
S0091	i use to know all that part of the world very well

S0179	erm and then set off sort of earlyish on sunday get there about twelve do the walk which be mean to take about five hours take seven huh hmm and then get back to the car just after it get dark and be home by sort of tenish so it be a fairly long day but
S0058	but it be good i really enjoy it
S0179	mm
S0058	it be nice to see somewhere new and you know go somewhere somewhere different it be good
S0091	mm
S0179	mm and um cos it's easter bank holiday come up well easter both bank holiday come up um so we've get four days off in total um and we're plan to go up to er this place call near um
S0091	it's near what
S0179	near
S0091	yeah what do you say
S0179	er
S0091	no i don't know
S0179	erm it's a farm er mum and dad have stay there a few time er it's sort of a bite like farm actually sort of just a convert farm yard into holiday cottages
S0058	mm
S0179	and um they've just get a new one though just finish convert it be just an abandon barn and it's this really swish erm two person cottage and it's get its own private hot tub at the back um so you can sort of sit outside in a a warm bubble water
S0091	mm
S0058	we're look forward to that
S0179	yeah
S0058	so we need to need to book that
S0179	if it's not rain which it probably will be
S0058	it probably will be rain but
S0179	so you're essentially sit in a bath outside with an umbrella
S0091	ha
S0179	which i'm keen for
S0058	i suppose if you're already wet then
S0179	exactly how much wetter can you get
S0058	yeah
S0179	so that's go to be um yeah hopefully quite relax cos we haven't have any leave yet this year
S0058	yeah so it'll be nice to have a a bite of time just not do anything
S0179	um um yes um we're also try to have holiday plan excuse me so er one option be to go up to scotland and have a drive around so we'll probably stay in again and use that as a centre to erm sort of drive up to north the north coast and whatnot and another option be to go to wales so go to erm probably er farm again or possibly and er do some explore from there because we've get some friends who haven't stay there before
S0058	mm
S0179	erm ooh and i do i think i tell you about my channel swim plan
S0091	no
S0179	in that case i this the goal for this summer be to do a channel swim erm but it's have to be revise for two reason the first one be my plan be to do it one year as a team of like four people and then do it the next year as a solo effort erm but i haven't actually be able i've only find one other person who's will to do it
S0179	which be a bite of an issue erm i mean and it's it's prove quite difficult to persuade people that this be actually a good idea
S0058	rather than insane
S0091	it's very cold the channel
S0179	well it's warmer than pretty much anywhere else around here
S0091	really
S0179	well it's warmer than the north sea
S0091	no no no the channel be suppose to be very cold
S0179	oh great now you tell me compare to like the mediterranean or the indian ocean yes
S0091	oh yes
S0058	pretty cold
S0179	um but um
S0091	well i think it's always run the water isn't it through the channel one way
S0179	oh okay
S0091	one way or the other that keep it cold
S0058	oh right
S0179	yeah and it also slow you down because you sort of have to swim diagonally
S0091	mm
S0179	um as if you would if you be in a boat um but it also cost two and a half thousand pound to hire a boat for the day it's insane
S0091	good gracious
S0179	erm and you also have to pay the coastguard five hundred pound to stop cargo ship hit you which seem like good value for money
S0058	yeah you're will to pay that
S0091	yes
S0058	it's just it turn out to be really expensive you can't just turn up on the day and go for it
S0091	mm
S0058	you've gotta
S0179	well you shouldn't
S0058	you shouldn't yeah
S0179	i mean er it's generally like
S0091	but don't they have occasion when it it's sort of a mass swim the channel
S0179	no
S0091	they use to have
S0179	really
S0091	mm
S0058	ah
S0179	because only how many of those people die because there be only about sort of it's less than a thousand people who have ever do it in history so
S0091	oh no i don't think so
S0179	well there's a record keep like the first
S0091	in in in my youth it be the best sort of popular swim
S0058	maybe it wasn't officially register
S0179	maybe it be a because
S0058	maybe they just use to get in a do it
S0091	oh yes i suspect a lot of people swim it and and nobody know about it
S0179	because the first person that do it it be in nineteen fifteen i think
S0091	i don't know if it be a captain i use to know his name
S0179	be it captain something
S0091	pardon
S0179	it be captain in the army
S0091	mm
S0058	be it
S0179	erm mm
S0058	mm
S0179	erm that would have be before you be bear anyway
S0091	really
S0179	erm anyway the um so yes that goal have be postpone for a bite and this summer i be think of maybe swim or or something like that
S0091	that there be very cold
S0179	i know well i be in earlier erm last year
S0091	yes i be swim in
S0058	ah
S0179	really
S0091	and
S0179	well actually i'll show you some photos after lunch of er us up there
S0091	and the one what's the one in the south the erm west corner
S0179	
S0091	no
S0179	er
S0058	the
S0179	er the i'm not sure
S0058	i'm not sure i don't know them very well
S0091	i think it's one of the largest lakes it's sort of like a
S0058	erm
S0179	road atlas
S0091	pardon
S0179	road atlas
S0091	no
S0179	that'd probably tell us
S0058	yeah cos and be pretty big but then there's like which be all really small
S0179	mm i'll try and read it i'm sorry
S0058	hmm
S0091	it's not be it
S0179	no it
S0058	that's
S0179	that that's moderately small think of which we need a new road atlas
S0058	yeah we do there's bits of road which it doesn't have on
S0179	oh i don't know you've get a road atlas do you mind clear the table

S0058	the two foods that i really don't like i'm um you know i'm not i'm not picky i i'll eat pretty much anything but
S0179	unless caviar or melon
S0058	unless it's caviar just i really don't like them
S0179	you'd be surprise if you be in a situation in which you find it's a problem

S0179	um and have a very good time er i think some of us have slightly too much of a good time
S0179	mm mm um actually that's an idea er have you get any um good suggestions for holiday destinations as in you've be to sort of of far more in different place than we have any ideas
S0091	i think er norway be as good as anywhere
S0058	oh we haven't think about norway
S0179	you can get the ferry

S0179	mm
S0091	newcastle to well there's two
S0179	bergen isn't it
S0058	mm
S0091	sometimes to bergen but sometimes they go to a place south of bergen
S0058	oh okay
S0091	and then you could stay on it and go up to bergen but um i think it be a place call um quite a big town south of bergen
S0179	oslo
S0091	no oslo's in a different country isn't it
S0179	i'm fairly sure oslo be the capital of
S0058	be it oh oh oslo's the capital i think

S0058	oh
S0091	i i've be there about three or four time

S0058	mm
S0091	with a car and then motor across sweden and into norway
S0058	lovely

S0091	mm
S0179	mm mm
S0058	mm that would be nice if we want to go somewhere a bite more exotic
S0179	mm what might be quite fun be we could do it via poland so do a loop poland russia finland sweden norway
S0058	so we start in get the ferry to can you get a ferry to poland or fly fly to poland
S0179	mm no we'd probably drive

S0058	mm

S0058	ha ha you can speed through that bite
S0179	it'll be much quicker

S0179	well

S0179	expensive
S0058	mm
S0179	but er

S0179	no erm um i mean you know i might have to sort of have a coffee before i take off

S0179	mm well cars have get wider now so they'll have to
S0058	yeah true
S0179	but erm yes do you want to describe that time we play mini golf at that zoo crazy golf
S0058	oh yeah so we we be at the sort of wildlife park and we decide to have a game of crazy golf which be a bite of a mistake because i be win every time
S0091	yes
S0058	and peter didn't like this very much and it end with you go off in a sulk i think you accuse me of cheat and then go off in a sulk
S0179	that's not exactly what happen
S0058	that's my memory of it
S0179	but ever since then we have a rule where we can't play crazy golf
S0058	huh huh er yeah if you end up win it's fine

S0179	it's nineteen eighty five
S0058	mm

S0091	that's in norway yes that's a that's pretty well north
S0179	you don't look that cold

S0179	oh look at the house
S0058	oh they're lovely aren't they
S0179	so grand and baltic which be kind of what you'd expect

S0179	wow
S0058	mm
S0179	that's a big ship

S0179	that one it's huge
S0058	nice volvos
S0179	yep it's almost like an advert
S0091	mm
S0058	oh yes perfect set as well
S0091	this i that this be um oslo isn't it i think bergen hmm no i be wrong
S0179	ahh
S0091	oh yes i think it's very nice norway you'll like it
S0058	hmm we'll look into it we'll see how much it cost to get there now
S0179	mm cos the other place i be think about be um not south germany sort of black forest switzerland type of area cos then you can drive through the alps into north italy and then sort of come back through france
S0091	oh right
S0179	the subtle advantage to that be i speak some french
S0058	where as you don't speak any norwegian
S0091	well in in norway everybody speak english
S0058	mm
S0179	that's no fun
S0179	i have this problem in belgium everybody speak english and you don't want them to
S0058	yeah you try really hard to get someone to talk french to you and everyone just speak in english you do try very hard
S0179	exactly
S0058	i love the guy who say in english 'shall we just speak in english '
S0179	that's really annoy no damn it
S0058	yeah i want to practise
S0058	but yeah um i there's a singer i like who's from bergen
S0179	that's obscure
S0058	it's very obscure he's very good and his english be impeccable he write songs in english cos that's how to sell
S0179	look at abba
S0058	well exactly yeah i mean that's how you sell your music to a an audience because otherwise you it's a very limit market for it
S0179	mm it maybe that explain why all the english singers be so dreadful
S0058	what because they don't need to worry about it yeah
S0179	yeah cos there's no sort of intelligence threshold
S0058	yeah
S0091	mm
S0179	imagine the spice girls do translation
S0058	no huh
S0179	erm wow hill
S0058	impressive
