S0208	quite a few years ago
S0202	we can talk normal
S0208	i know yeah quite a few years ago erm there be a girl call who live here
S0202	mm
S0208	not here obviously erm she live in i can't remember the name of her village and erm she be her whole family come out and move here
S0202	yeah
S0208	and erm on christmas eve it's really sad but her dad pass away
S0202	mm
S0208	heart attack die
S0202	yeah
S0208	erm her and her mum find him in an armchair like dead christmas eve
S0202	yeah
S0208	like really awful bless her erm but they be rent that house
S0202	yeah
S0208	and the house they rent my mum use to do the clean for
S0202	right okay
S0208	the blanket that they wrap him up in my mum take to clean and it be in the erm laundry room outside
S0202	mm
S0208	for quite a while now i didn't i didn't know i didn't care whatever but that laundry room be exactly underneath my blue room
S0202	yeah
S0208	my blue room be where i think all the stuff be come from it's where i hear the stuff it's where the footsteps stop all of that kind of stuff
S0202	yeah
S0208	so it might just be coincidence it might be my mind put mean to something that there doesn't need to be mean to or anything
S0202	yeah
S0208	basically all the stuff like me be scar of the room and all that it start as soon as my mum have that blanket like before i even know about it
S0202	really
S0208	yeah it's like it really really freak me out because it be like someone do die in that
S0202	yeah
S0208	and get wrap up in it so i don't know it's weird it might be coincidence but it really freak me out and me and cos this be when he be live here
S0202	yeah where do he stay when he move here
S0208	in the the little blue room that you stay in the begin
S0202	oh right yeah
S0208	he sleep in there erm like we do a test like i tell him about it and he be the same like he doesn't really believe like he would never ever pay attention when i would tell him and i'd be scar and stuff and try and get reassurances and he just didn't really care at all
S0202	yeah
S0208	he'd tell me i be stupid so he be like right we'll go do a test we get a plain piece of paper and like a lid from like a a spray sort of thing like an aerosol
S0202	mm
S0208	it's like a little circle lid put it on the paper draw a circle around it then we'd know if something happen if it be to be move or anything we'd see that it would move from around the circle we forget about it and a few days later we go back and we we couldn't find the lid and there be the paper with the circle around it but i couldn't for the life of me find the lid and i haven't find it since it's just literally just disappear and i've always think that it be him play a trick try to scare me
S0202	yeah
S0208	but when i really get it out of him of him i be like be that you you have to tell me i be get really really scar and he swear that it wasn't him
S0202	yeah
S0208	but i don't know might have be him try to freak me out
S0202	i don't think he'd do that to you
S0208	but still
S0202	personally i don't think
S0208	cos anything bad that i've hear or felt or anything have it come from that room
S0202	yeah
S0208	it's like when me and hear the footsteps and he hear them as well you could hear them in that room and they would stop like you could judge where distance be they would just stop in that doorway never in my bedroom just that room
S0202	yeah
S0208	i just don't like it
S0202	maybe someone's die in there before
S0208	well i don't know because this be a family home and like the amount of generations that people have live and die here but i don't
S0202	cos didn't didn't you convert it when you move here weren't it just a shell like there be nothing in it
S0208	mm mm there be load of stuff in it it my dad just demolish wall and put them up in different place
S0202	right okay
S0208	so it didn't look anything like it do now
S0202	right
S0208	but erm just but my mum when i've talk to her about this stuff she say that she choose this place on purpose because there be no spirit here like she didn't feel anything so she choose it on purpose cos she want a neutral place cos her house in apparently be very haunt
S0202	right
S0208	and she say that she use to feel it all the time and apparently like i don't i remember one instance but i don't remember at all any of the stories that she use to tell me
S0202	mm
S0208	when i'd apparently like talk to people like see people or feel them and stuff
S0202	yeah
S0208	but she say that there use to be people there all the time like she'd feel them and i don't remember exactly have speak to her about it like since but there be something apparently that like a white lady use to live in at our place it use to be her place
S0202	mm
S0208	call her the white lady because she always use to be dress in white and stuff
S0202	mm
S0208	like she wasn't evil
S0202	mm
S0208	it wasn't anything nasty my mum would just sense her sometimes and she use to do spiritual like heal healer train ritual something
S0202	mm
S0208	like all about spirit and like heal and all that kind of stuff
S0202	yeah
S0208	as the name imply
S0208	and erm i have a friend in the village can't remember her name i know it be 's mum my sister's friend and erm she use to do it i remember one day they be in the live room talk and i come in and my mum's friend just randomly ask they must have be talk about it and she just say go over to that corner over there in the room do you feel anything so i do and whatever and i be like yeah it's a bite cold it's a bite weird she's like yeah but do but do you feel anything and apparently i tell her i be like yeah there's someone stand next to me cos like apparently she could sense it and she want to see if i could or something like weird
S0202	mm
S0208	but it's happen before where i've see something like not particularly someone but something
S0202	mm
S0208	in my bedroom when i be really young but i use to have these really really horrible nightmares about it wasn't a person it be like black smoke in chain
S0202	mm
S0208	and it would always come into my bedroom and i'd hear the chain outside my bedroom and all that kind of stuff and i never bring up my mum cos i be always too scar
S0202	mm
S0208	but i just use to put it down to be like bad dream but there's be some point like in my bedroom when i still live in england like you say i wasn't sure if it be a dream or real
S0202	yeah yeah
S0208	it just use to freak me out
S0202	i can remember once when we be kid i'd say more teenagers about like thirteen fourteen this field we'd always use to go to meet lads on a sunday we'd erm we'd meet up in the morning at ten o'clock we'd all play football like play football till twelve and then everyone would go home and have their dinner at home like sunday dinner and all that and erm we'd come back after and then we'd like get piss so everyone would bring some wine or whatever they could nick from their parent just the fact that whatever they could someone to buy them and erm this once we weren't get piss we we be drink but we weren't really get piss like and we be sit at the top of the field and so we be face this way and on your right hand side be a school like a primary school that i use to go to everyone in the village go to and then on your leave be erm a separate field with a fence so you're in this field there's tree at the top and then there's a fence and then there's a golf course behind you in the in a wood
S0208	mm
S0202	and then there's a fence and a pub and just like some empty grind sort of a field and erm at the bottom of the field there's an old fence that you have to jump over to get on to this field cos it's mean to be the primary school's field like they own it and erm we be just sit at the top of the field and we be all just sit chill out i sit with my boyfriend and everyone else be just sit with whoever and we be all just sit chat and we saw these white light like it be shape like a human like a not a woman or a man just like a human it be not like really big like five foot nine or something like that in height and it speed from one side of the field to the other and it and behind the pub on the leave be a big mansion and it open up onto the golf course and the wood as well and it turn out that this old woman who there be a story like this old woman that have die erm she's die and then her son come back off holiday a few days later and erm he be he'd have a chat to her like how you blah blah blah and then brother find out she she'd die a few days later he be like oh i be only talk to her the other day and they're like hang on she die while you be on holiday like while you be abroad she die when you weren't here it's like well that's impossible cos i be talk to her like two days ago it's like no she die when you weren't here this be the first time i've be able to get to see you cos of whatever and like turn out that he be talk to a ghost that's the story anyway don't know how true it be
S0208	yeah
S0202	but we saw that three or four time in the whole time that we go there like we saw this this thing just shoot from one field to the next like a shoot star just like there's one second go the next like so fast like it weren't a human it weren't a torch cos if it be a torch car like
S0208	yeah
S0202	spin round the corner and that's why it go so fast but there be no road
S0208	yeah that's weird
S0202	like and we be all freak out we all legged it like to the bottom of the field and like fuck freak out but
S0208	that's really weird
S0202	but yeah that thing with my mum all eh her and her friends do a ouija board and erm they all like leave the game so like they all get freak out and just stop play they didn't like ask permission to leave from the spirit or anything like that and whether it's a coincidence or not a few days later one of her friends a black girl erm that she be friends with erm die she be cross the road and a car be come one way
S0208	yeah
S0202	and a car go that way and she get hit by both like she get sandwich between them both and get chuck up in the air and she be dead like instantly and then a few days after or a few weeks another girl die i don't know how she die though can't remember i think she kill herself or someone murder her like it be pretty bad
S0208	it's awful
S0202	but my mum i can remember be say i'm go to a sleepover be it okay blah blah blah and she be just like oh what be you go to do like i tell her she freak the fuck out like my mum doesn't freak out about anything smoke drug sex anything if i tell her that i be do something she'd be like right okay and she'd give me some advice about it she would never freak out she would never go fuck mental even if i tell her i be high off my tits on heroin like she probably would go mad but she wouldn't freak out like she do and she go fuck mental like proper freak out she be like you don't ever fuck do that if you ever do that you're never come back into my house and all this and she be like if i ever find out you've do that i will kick you out and i will never speak to you again and all this stuff and woah
S0208	erm do you remember
S0202	happen like proper freaky it's like i can feel s grandad all the time not all the time but like at odd instance i can feel him and i've tell you a million time
S0208	yeah but that thing that i just tell you about the black cloud i know it be a woman but the black cloud and the chain
S0202	mm
S0208	i literally i don't think i've even think about that since it's happen
S0202	that would freak me the fuck out
S0208	it's just a think that's just come to me i've never bring it up with my mum like i've literally i feel like i've not you know when something happen and sometimes you replay memories
S0202	yeah
S0208	and think about it i don't genuinely think i've ever think about that since i be a child until now
S0202	yeah
S0208	like it's just sort of hit me so it just remind me that tomorrow i'll talk to my dad or i'll erm talk to my mum about it and just see if it fit anything she ever felt or
S0202	but maybe that but maybe that that weird dream because of like maybe you felt something as in like you you want to be free but you didn't feel free stuff like that you know just like smoky chain
S0208	maybe it just it it just feel like something that's too graphic and too grow up like too metaphorical for someone of that age
S0202	yeah
S0208	cos when i live in that house in i mean i move here when i'd just turn ten
S0202	mm
