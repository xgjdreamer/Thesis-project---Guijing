S0238	to get the strimmer work erm then obviously i'm not i'm gonna be want to wear my real scruffy clothe
S0242	right yeah
S0238	because you can get oil on you and all sort of things
S0242	yes
S0238	i've already i've get a mark on those white trousers which i'm think could be oil i mean i haven't use them in the garden but you sometimes get oil on you even from things like a car door
S0242	yeah it can happen
S0238	erm but i've put them through the wash machine and it didn't shift so erm
S0242	oh
S0238	things like oil be difficult
S0242	yes
S0238	erm so cereals cutlery no get both bread things to put on bread
S0242	right
S0238	the milk erm be still in the fridge er there be some juice as well if you want it but otherwise i wouldn't i've hold my coffee i haven't have coffee yet
S0242	okay alright i'll start off with some
S0238	erm
S0242	cereal of some sort
S0238	and oh yes what i didn't say be there's a little bowl with a few strawberries leave in it in the fridge if you want to put those on your cereal they could do with use
S0242	oh oh well
S0238	i sort of i've be tend to do that i sort of start it in the strawberry season and then carry on erm if if something doesn't seem to have a lot in i've get that maple and pecan one there's another packet in here so that would be fine i could have be do this knit when we be talk last night i've never take so flip long to knit a sleeve
S0242	to what sorry
S0238	to knit a sleeve
S0242	oh right
S0238	erm i start cos i start it before i go away and then of course i didn't take it with me because i always worry if i'm travel if i take knit with me either the needle might break in the suitcase or i might have something steal and lose that wool or you know so erm but i have be back a week and i still haven't finish the damn thing
S0242	you still haven't finish the sleeve right
S0238	mm
S0238	no once you've get what you want i'll go in there and and make the coffee but
S0242	wait wait sorry go again
S0238	i say once you've get what you want i'll go in there and make the coffee but there isn't really room for both of us at the same time
S0242	yeah right this look like a new milk be that it
S0238	yes erm because i've be use that almond milk
S0242	oh right
S0238	which be actually quite nice on cereal i don't know how it cook though so i would have need to buy some normal milk anyway because i want to use some in cook
S0242	mm
S0238	erm and i don't really want to present you with a fail experiment
S0238	so finish those strawberries i say
S0242	yeah alright
S0238	no i'll start do that put a few strawberries on cereal in the strawberry season and then i sort of gradually realise that it's not really the strawberry season anymore and i'm still do it
S0242	yeah exactly
S0238	but er well they can't be that expensive cos i would have notice i mean there come a point with a lot of fruit where it's still available but it's suddenly become ridiculously expensive
S0242	mm
S0238	at which point i normally stop buy it
S0242	yep
S0238	erm so i don't know where they get their strawberries from at this time of year
S0242	mm
S0238	i know actually that the fruit from where i go fruit pick
S0242	mm
S0238	which be just beyond erm i know that seem like a long way to go but it's really good quality stuff and so on
S0242	mm
S0238	whereas anything more local i've go and it if you plough your way through nettle and thistles to get at the strawberries i just think
S0242	no no
S0238	and they've get a lot of place just have strawberries and this place have get a whole range of things
S0242	mm mm
S0238	include you know peas and stuff as well erm and i particularly like raspberries they're my favourite fruit erm but their notice say up to the end of august for both strawberries and raspberries
S0242	really
S0238	which surprise me
S0242	mm
S0238	so they obviously just have a whole range of varieties
S0242	mm mm
S0238	and plant them at at slightly different time and
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	just manage it because it's in their interest
S0242	mm
S0238	to have it go as long as possible
S0242	if you can keep it the season go great
S0238	mm
S0242	great of course for them
S0238	true no i i the only reason why i didn't try raspberries this year be i be just it be just there would have be too many things you know my mum grow them but they're a bite pathetic
S0238	erm but i've actually be over three time to their i normally just go once you know but i go once on my own and then i take my mother cos it's a farm shop with er a café a er
S0242	mm
S0238	in the café i realise why this year that they've expand the café since last year erm so i take her for lunch one day erm and i just go and do a very little quick pick whilst she be walk between the car and the café more or less i mean
S0238	slight exaggeration there but you know
S0238	erm
S0238	she she's very slow these days
S0238	erm and and then buy some some things from the shop cos they have stuff that they've pick in the shop as well you know
S0242	mm mm mm
S0238	erm and then i be oh i know where i go i go to erm desert medieval village do that mean anything to you
S0242	no
S0238	erm there be quite a lot of desert medieval villages around i think
S0242	uhu
S0238	but this one's in er it's english heritage er and obviously a lot of of such place may have be desert in medieval time but then they be build on later so this be
S0242	right
S0238	just in a in a field kinda thing so i mean it's mostly lump in the grass
S0242	mm
S0238	erm but the church be still
S0242	you need a vivid imagination
S0238	yeah erm the church be still a build albeit roofless it be use for quite a long time as a parish church
S0242	mm mm
S0238	after people have go from the village itself erm but it be excavate for quite a long something like between nineteen fifty nine and nineteen ninety nine you know i mean a really long period of time
S0242	right
S0238	and presumably not continuously but but every year they'd go and do a season erm so i presume that the grass that you're see there now have grow over since they excavate
S0242	yeah
S0238	erm and it's a nice day out so
S0242	and be the history a bite know you know be it
S0238	well
S0242	be it the plague or or do
S0238	no
S0242	or be it just economic
S0238	it be just it it yes er
S0242	be it a
S0238	enclosure the initially the the you know the it be take over by a new landlord who enclose the land
S0242	mm mm
S0238	for erm sheep farm and and
S0242	right
S0238	therefore they didn't need the tenant farmers so much
S0242	mm mm
S0238	and that sort of start the decline and then just the long slow decline i think
S0242	mm m
S0238	and it wasn't a sort of but it be later than the plague
S0242	mm mm okay
S0238	erm but because it's a free site there isn't a little kiosk with a little man in it you know
S0242	mm mm yeah
S0238	but when i go to er priory which be probably last year now which be the nearest man site in their in their shop they have guidebooks to and think that would be a good idea because i've be before but i mean obviously yes there be notice up on the site but you get more information from the guidebooks that they do so i think right okay i'll do that i'll go and erm i'll buy the guidebook now and at some point i'll go over there and and just hadn't get round to it and hadn't get round to it and it be a beautiful day so i do that and and it's actually really near the fruit farm so it just make sense to go there on the way back
S0242	right
S0238	and oh yeah that be one i have this really weird experience with my car that i'd come through it's that sort of area
S0242	mm mm
S0238	and there be a bite of a mess because there's a bridge that have get a traffic light on it cos it's too narrow for two way traffic
S0242	okay yeah
S0238	and then just beyond that be some really serious roadworks with a one way traffic light and the traffic be come through and block everything so that
S0242	yep yep yep
S0238	erm and i realise also when i finally get beyond the lorry that be in front of me and could see what be happen it be it wasn't a it wasn't a traffic light it be a convoy which be always slower so you're wait for this thing to come and lead you through you know
S0242	yep right yep yep yep
S0238	erm but i be stick behind something big that i and so i couldn't see past this you always be in those situations
S0242	yeah right
S0238	and we be sit for age so i switch my engine off finally we start move i switch my engine on and start move and there's this horrendous noise as of engine knock
S0242	mm mm
S0238	you know and i think something be gonna fall you know i think the engine be gonna fall on the floor through through the it be just awful i only have to go a couple of hundred yards before the end of the roadworks be actually the entrance into the fruit farm
S0242	right
S0238	so i go in there and park when i set off again nothing at all and the only thing i can think of be i have my windows open cos it be hot but actually it wasn't my engine at all it be somebody else's i be hear
S0242	yeah
S0238	but it be so alarm
S0242	yeah maybe it be
S0238	and i'm drive on think well i can't break down here because i'm in the middle of all this one way whatsit and
S0242	right right yeah
S0238	it would hold everybody up for hours
S0242	yeah right
S0238	but er do you want your coffee with your breakfast shall shall i make the coffee now or do you want it
S0242	yep yeah that'd be fine
S0238	and be you a milk in coffee person
S0242	no
S0238	no so you're like me black no sugar
S0242	absolutely
S0238	right jolly good i'll clear that
S0242	oh okay
S0238	well they suggest do it while you're cook or something cos it give you something to do which be all very well but you do move around and you do bang things on the table when you
S0242	so what what bread be this
S0238	er that be wheat and rye that's not one i've make that's morrison's
S0242	oh i see
S0238	erm i'm wait until i get this stuff before i do any more bread make which as i say should be arrive soon so you've get a homemade raspberry from the place i stay last week
S0242	uhu
S0238	and unhomemade blackcurrant and honey and that be quince jelly that my mum give me that somebody that she know make if you see what i mean
S0242	what
S0238	oh and the other
S0242	which be quince jelly this
S0238	that one that's say quince jelly on the side
S0242	that one oh sorry
S0238	and that be my marmalade
S0242	oh rye
S0238	which i can recommend
S0242	i'm sure you can i will take these straight off to the table
S0238	right
S0242	ah
S0238	yes i stop bother to make raspberry jam because it's very easy
S0242	yep
S0238	erm but i be use raspberries from this fruit farm which be fairly pricey and though when i know i be make jam i sort of they've get quite big punnets that you pack into and i find because it's quite a long way by the time i've drive home if you fill the punnets fairly full the thing that's in the bottom have already start to get
S0242	oh i see
S0238	it's really squash you know
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	so that be actually quite good for make jam
S0242	right yes yeah
S0238	and as i say
S0242	pre squash
S0238	pre squash raspberries yes erm but although it's very straightforward actually you can buy perfectly nice raspberry jam whereas the marmalade
S0242	mm
S0238	you cannot buy even in a farm shop marmalade as nice as that i don't think
S0242	right
S0238	i mean see what you think maybe you don't agree it depend what kind of marmalade you like but so even though marmalade be very faffy i make some every year
S0242	yeah
S0238	erm
S0242	mm that's nice marmalade
S0238	mm that's just delia
S0242	mm yeah
S0238	erm but i've never have the recipe not work erm and it's a bite you know you you're boil it well no you're simmer it for two hours so that the er pulp soften and everything
S0242	mm
S0238	well that's a bite difficult to gauge because one person's simmer be another person's boil if you see what i mean
S0242	yeah
S0238	for for when it's as long as two hours that could make quite a bite of difference
S0242	yeah
S0238	to how much water have actually evaporate and therefore to the whole consistency so i would have think it would vary enormously from year to year but actually doesn't that much
S0242	it doesn't right
S0238	there we go so now check that that be the right sort of strength for you
S0242	okay
S0238	cos i've do it at the right strength for me
S0242	they be nice mug aren't they
S0238	and yeah and if it isn't i'll put a little bite more water in
S0242	mm that's fine
S0238	that's fine good you're about the only person i know who doesn't go yar when they drink my coffee
S0242	it's a good solid brew i mean definitely yes but that's fine with me
S0238	mm and that be that quince thing be so weird because if you flip the top you realise it obviously be something hold cinnamon or something it's it's not mean for jam at all
S0242	right right
S0238	it's mean for slice
S0242	right yeah yeah it's a pepper pot or whatever isn't it
S0238	and it's actually it's yes and it's too narrow to put a spoon into
S0242	ah
S0238	you can put a knife in but you couldn't put i erm you could not fit a spoon in very weird
S0242	and do do you say your mother make this
S0238	no no
S0242	no
S0238	somebody that she know make it and give it to her
S0242	somebody she know yeah
S0238	i'm always get she's well 's go now the be the woman who live next door to her
S0242	mm right
S0238	erm you know when we be kid the the and live next door and he be something like latvian and i'm not actually very sure
S0242	ah
S0238	and she be italian
S0242	right
S0238	so they both speak fairly break english erm i mean obviously they use english to communicate with each other and
S0238	manage to have a perfectly good relationship for all those years but erm but she he die quite a long time ago and she'd be continually live next to my mum
S0242	yeah
S0238	and she after what 's three years older than me and obviously she be bear here cos they must have meet here you know
S0242	mm
S0238	so she must have be in this country for about fifty seven years or something like that and she still sound as if she just arrive off the boat from naples
S0238	i mean just so difficult to follow
S0242	mm
S0238	really really heavy accent really peculiar grammar and and erm even i find it difficult so and erm you know my mum would sort of sit there smile and nod sometimes you know
S0238	erm but er she grow oregano in her garden
S0242	mm mm
S0238	erm as possibly italians will you know i don't know
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	erm but obviously far more than she need so she'd give my mother an enormous polythene bagful of oregano well however much you like herbs you don't really need huge great bag of them one normally buy them in little sachets from the
S0242	yeah right right
S0238	so my mother pass things like that onto me and then as i say she's get these apple tree erm which be cook apples so i get those
S0242	right
S0238	erm and tomatoes which i don't mind at all
S0238	which i have try to grow but because i tend to go away in june
S0242	yeah mm mm
S0238	that's then they i'm away when they need water erm
S0242	right
S0238	one year i take my tomato plant around and leave them in my mother's greenhouse when i be away but then in what sense be they my tomatoes they're really hers
S0238	erm so i've stop bother but again actually home grow tomatoes particularly if you do not put them in the fridge if she just when she bring she'll give me a little handful and i'll try and keep most of them out on the work surface and and use them fairly quickly
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	they just have so much more flavour than anything from the supermarket
S0242	yes yeah very good
S0238	but that's why really why i guess why i want to get my orchard up and run
S0242	yeah
S0238	because she's not gonna be around forever and i suspect you know she's get two blackcurrant bush and i love blackcurrants and i've be go and harvest from her
S0242	mm
S0238	previously er and i do a bite this year but of course i do have a few of my own next year i'm sure i'll have more but i suspect if one of hers die or something she probably just won't bother to replace it
S0242	right
S0238	erm and then of course we don't know how long she's gonna go on for
S0242	no well well how old be she
S0238	eighty three
S0242	mm mm
S0238	erm and i think her mother be something like eighty seven erm and my grandma be ninety two or ninety three that sort of age
S0242	uhu
S0238	but she be in a home you know she could really couldn't manage on her own
S0242	mm mm
S0238	erm she have she have shingle and be take into hospital and because of her age before they let her go back into her council house they sort of run her through various test in the hospital you know i think they put take them into a kitchen and see whether they can make themselves a cup of tea sort of thing
S0242	mm mm
S0238	and decide that she wasn't fit to live on her own and we be go oh my god because my mother's mother be really really adamant she be not go into anywhere and she have stroke after stroke at intervals you know and every time she she lose a little bite of mobility and
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	and she be mentally she be absolutely fine but but she could just about move around her own house with a zimmer frame and luckily it be a bungalow and she have meals on wheel
S0242	mm
S0238	for lunchtime five days a week
S0242	right right
S0238	er and a home help who come in i don't know how frequently and a very nice next door neighbour who be just as old as she be but use to
S0238	go and knock on her door every day and on at least one occasion he he basically save her life because she what she didn't he realise that i don't know whether he'd actually knock on the door but her bedroom curtain be still draw and she be always up
S0242	mm
S0238	so he call an ambulance and she'd actually have a stroke while she be get undress the night before and spend the whole night sit in a chair in her underwear unable to move
S0242	right
S0238	and be sort of end up be rush to hospital wrap in foil cos she have hypothermia
S0242	yeah right right yeah
S0238	a non central heat bungalow of course
S0242	of course
S0238	erm and that be weird as well because it be when i be at school and i use to be take to school but a neighbour whose daughter go to the same school and i be stand by his car on his drive wait for them to come out of the house
S0242	right
S0238	cos they be faffing about and i hear an ambulance go by along the main road and you can be it's quite a long distance away but it come up cos my parent house be higher than
S0242	mm
S0238	the road and i remember think i hope that's not my grandma
S0242	mm
S0238	and it probably have be cos she have be take in at about that time
S0242	that time oh really mm yeah
S0238	but well she have her wish in the end she do die in her own home
S0242	mm
S0238	but you know if she'd live in a country without all those social service she obviously wouldn't have be able to carry on
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	erm but no my dad's mum we be as i say we be sort of go oh dear because we know what my grandma have be like and think she's not gonna like this
S0242	yeah
S0238	erm so my dad and his sisters sussed out a few place and take her to look at them and she like oh yeah this be really nice and she
S0242	oh oh yeah
S0238	settle in and she use to gossip about the erm what do i mean i don't mean inmates i mean i actually
S0238	and i don't even mean i don't mean the patients i mean the staff
S0242	the staff right
S0238	you know and she find a a gentleman friend
S0242	mm
S0238	who use to have a very mild flirtation with over a cup of tea i that be really be all that happen
S0242	ah right
S0238	erm and be perfectly happy so people just be so different
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	but i i know my mother wouldn't she's more docile than her mother but she wouldn't be happy
S0242	no no one of the people i visit on this trip where i be er er da da da round round britain as it be
S0238	mm
S0242	be erm er who be ninety four
S0238	right
S0242	and she's live in the same house for about forty years or so but it be a bungalow
S0238	mm
S0242	and she can erm er she can just about look after herself she's she's bright as a button but her her legs weren't always do
S0238	mm
S0242	what she want them to but she she's get a a a sort of trolley on wheel
S0238	yes
S0242	things and she er make a point of go down to round to a village shop at least once a week
S0238	mm
S0242	which be a big well it's only i could sort of walk it in well five minutes probably but
S0238	mm but it's a big trip for her
S0242	but for her like that's that's a big trip what i really like about her be that she be determine she be gonna do it and i mean she's not bloody mind when it's be snow or something
S0238	mm
S0242	she she say no i won't go today but but she be determine that she be gonna keep on go and she's get lot of friends who say oh you know we'll run you down there in the car
S0238	mm
S0242	or we can get things for you no no no
S0238	no oh it's much i if you don't keep do it you see i i think my mother be have be say lately erm things that she's find it she's actually find that her legs aren't very happy just go from the car to the supermarket and i think it's cos she doesn't do enough walk
S0242	yep
S0238	whereas my auntie which be my dad's sister be much more like your
S0242	mm
S0238	she's older than my mum and she have she definitely wouldn't go out in snow because she have a bad fall a few years ago just go she live in shelter house
S0242	mm mm
S0238	and she be just go from the community centre to back to her little bungalow
S0242	oh right yeah
S0238	erm and go down and break her wrist and her ankle and it be her right wrist and she's right hand and
S0242	ah
S0238	and be in and it have get and when i say break i mean smithereen kind of break they have to really pin the ankle and so on
S0242	yeah right
S0238	erm and therefore she still although she can now use her hand things like cut up steak be a little bite tricky
S0242	yeah
S0238	she hasn't get the full strength back in it and so
S0242	right right
S0238	erm but she's get one of those like a zimmer but on wheel
S0242	yeah yeah yeah
S0238	so she can yeah i think it what you be talk about and she insist on go into into skipton from where she live which be she use to walk it quite comfortably and i think she's still do it with this trolley
S0242	mm
S0238	and then get the bus back cos it's up it's slightly uphill from the
S0242	okay right fair enough yeah good compromise
S0238	but again the bus that they have which be one with the that be design for old people
S0242	mm
S0238	and have a really good driver who you know they bloody cancel
S0242	yeah
S0238	so now the bus be come round at a less convenient time for shop and it's it doesn't have the the step at the right height
S0242	right
S0238	so luckily there's a really nice driver who get off
S0242	who jump out
S0238	and help her on with her
S0242	right yeah
S0238	but otherwise she wouldn't be able to get into the er shop how's and it's
S0242	yeah
S0238	that that bus be full of old people a lot of people just stop go into town because they can't
S0242	yes yeah yeah yeah that that's that's that's
S0238	but she's get a tame taxi driver
S0242	uhu
S0238	er whenever she's go a little bite further afield she just ring him up and say right
S0238	erm
S0242	yeah
S0238	you know and and she's get various allowance and so on because she and and i don't think she's get a lot in the way of save or anything they run a shop you know i wouldn't have think they manage to put a lot away erm and she just think it make sense to use that money on things like like pay for a taxi from time to time to make her life a bite more interest
S0242	absolutely absolutely
S0238	and i just contrast that with my mum who just who just er have let her life get narrower and narrower and i know it kind of have to happen when my dad be ill cos she couldn't leave him
S0242	mm
S0238	and even when she could leave him she felt guilty about do so you know and er but most of the widow that i know sorry
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	have sort of blossom after their husband die
S0242	right
S0238	and my mother be the opposite
S0242	right right mm
S0238	i mean even someone like someone call that she work with that they sort of share a class as it be that do three days a week and my mum do two and a half and they so they overlap by half a day for quite a few years and and her husband i think it be a heart attack but he die really young you you know
S0242	mm
S0238	forties perhaps
S0242	oh right yeah
S0238	certainly not more than fifties so a long time ago she's now find somebody else i mean she's spend a long time mourn
S0242	mm
S0238	you know and i think be quite lonely
S0242	yeah
S0238	er but er she's now with somebody else so
S0242	ah
S0238	which be really nice
S0242	right great
S0238	not that i would have expect my mother to go and find somebody else but it would have be nice if she'd take advantage of things like the theatre
S0242	yes
S0238	have a whole lot of women of a certain age involve
S0238	some of them be widow some of them be not but they just they like do things
S0242	right
S0238	without their husband from time to
S0242	right right
S0238	and so there be a kind of little social group there that she could do things with and they keep invite her and and she just oh no i don't feel like it
S0242	oh i don't yeah yeah
S0238	erm and and now it's oh well i don't think i can leave well you know yes you can
S0242	yes you can yes yeah
S0238	but there be time when she'll only come out for coffee not lunch because she doesn't want to leave him well i'm sorry that's my doorbell could be a parcel
S0238	hello hi thank you
S0238	yes
S0242	be this flour
S0238	sorry
S0242	be this flour
S0238	no no no it's a it's a i've get i've order two different things online from amazon
S0242	right
S0238	and both of them be potentially small enough to go through the letterbox but it depend how they're pack and i didn't know how they be gonna be pack erm one be this erm gum that i need for for the gluten free
S0242	right
S0238	erm so i i don't know if you'd see i leave a little note on the door say erm if i'm not in and it won't go through the letterbox can you leave it in the storage bin round behind the dustbins
S0242	right
S0238	cos it's totally out of sight there
S0242	right
S0238	it's waterproof
S0242	right
S0238	and i don't want to have to go right into there use to be a parcel office in
S0242	ah but now
S0238	and now there isn't
S0242	right
S0238	erm and it's just such a nuisance and it's a good job that i do that i be in actually because it wouldn't it should have be able to go through the letterbox but they'd pack it square rather than flat if you see what i mean
S0238	so it would you know barclaycard why do we get look at that weight of paper
S0242	yeah
S0238	what a waste and that ditto but at least that be i mean why barclaycard think i want a barclaycard i've no idea i've never you know it's not my bank
S0238	erm at least this be from a company that i have order things from but it's the second thing i've have from them in a week
S0242	yeah yes
S0238	erm and every time i it's the plant company so it's like i order a lot of those plant from them erm but every time you do an order with them you get a free gift that you don't want erm last time it be er it's down it's by the shoe cupboard in the hall a little backpack well i've get a backpack and if i want another one i want one that have all those compartments like
S0242	mm mm
S0238	the current one because i take it to work and i need to be able to put different things in different place and and it's actually quite difficult to find one with all those compartments
S0242	yeah uhu
S0238	so i'm not just go to accept any random backpack that's just get one compartment
S0242	right
S0238	it's of no use whatsoever
S0242	right right right
S0238	i think have say that my kitchen scissor be from them
S0242	uhu
S0238	one time i some kitchen scissor and a set of knives
S0242	ah
S0238	er which be that my phone
S0242	be a peep
S0238	yeah oh the answerphone'll pick up that be the loudest i can put it on and it's really not
S0242	no
S0238	very loud i don't think
S0242	no
S0238	erm i mean this
S0242	that be that be it ring
S0238	and it's only there
S0242	yeah
S0238	yes
S0242	right
S0238	erm and with with this new phone there's a base unit and a handset so i can and i do i mean it's not very useful in there because we're not in there at the moment but i do that yesterday when i be in there before you arrive
S0242	mm yeah
S0238	think if your be hold up you would ring and i would need to be able to hear it
S0242	right right
S0238	erm but there's no way before that it or if i just if i if i leave the handset with the base unit they're in the office i can probably hear it in the live room with the door shut but i don't think i would hear it in any other room of the house
S0242	mm
S0238	erm i mean obviously that's why you have a detachable handset so you can put it in whatever room you're in but then you've get to remember to do it
S0242	yes
S0238	erm
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	that's not and i find with that that sometimes it's a bite like a mobile phone that sometimes there's a bite of a sort of echo on it it's not as
S0242	oh
S0238	as brilliant as
S0242	uhu
S0238	erm it's not as good as the old phone except that the old phone didn't detach you know cos it be a
S0242	mm mm
S0238	erm i can't remember what actually go wrong with the old phone something do plus i mean in a way i wasn't too bother about have a to replace it because it be actually a fax machine
S0242	okay
S0238	i buy it when i first come back to this country cos i'd have a fax machine in japan which be really quite good for keep in touch with mum
S0242	mm mm
S0238	cos they have one at that point
S0242	uhu
S0238	erm and then i get that job er with the in where i be actually involve with it all year round but that it be only run in the summer so i need to be able to communicate and this must just it must just have be before everybody be do email so i mean obviously email exist
S0242	yes
S0238	but it wasn't as widespread
S0242	right
S0238	and a lot of offices be still use fax
S0242	yeah
S0238	and they actually offer to buy me a fax machine erm and i don't i don't think they do i mean i think i pay for it in fact cos i it be it be my main phone
S0242	mm
S0238	you know erm but obviously that mean it take up quite a bite of space on the desk and periodically i would still get unsolicited fax from people who offer to collect my debts for me and things like that because they assume anyone with a fax machine be a business
S0242	a business yes yeah yeah
S0238	erm and at the other house because the people that i buy the house from have be run a business he build kitchens
S0242	okay
S0238	and that number be the company number they have a different line for personal things
S0242	ah
S0238	i when i first move in and i just have a phone with no answerphone and no nothing i be get fax come through in the middle of the night you know which obviously couldn't come through
S0242	yeah
S0238	but you've pick the phone the phone would ring and i have no mean of switch of do anything with it because it i didn't have an answerphone yet
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	and i pick it up and all i be get be this bloody beep noise
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	and i end up have to unplug the phone every night and it be so annoy
S0238	erm
S0242	yes yes
S0238	so it be actually quite useful to to get a fax machine so it could actually cope with the fax that be still come for somebody else
S0238	but er i don't i think that's kind of tail off now
S0242	and have you have any contact with the old house with people in
S0238	no not at all no er i leave the new address erm and but i but with a note well i mean i sort of leave a something tell them a few things about how to use things in the house
S0242	yeah
S0238	because i wasn't do a i wasn't there when they move in
S0242	mm
S0238	erm they be just get the key from the agent and i be at work so we weren't actually talk and i've never actually meet them because the agent show them round the house
S0242	you've never meet them
S0238	no
S0242	oh right
S0238	erm no they they cos the agent that i move to they do view themselves on tuesdays thursdays and saturdays or something like that and so the only i show a couple of people round who could only do sunday
S0242	mm mm
S0238	but anybody who could do those days the agents do it be much i it be so much less stress with the second agent
S0242	mm mm
S0238	erm and that's partly why you know that i just
S0242	yeah
S0238	so they didn't even tell me that someone have be view until afterwards erm so yeah i'd never meet these people
S0242	oh
S0238	erm so as i say i leave them a sort of a piece of paper that be say this key's for that one this key's for that one
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	and erm you know you need to do x y and z with a thermostat that sort of you know little things like that
S0242	right right
S0238	that i would have say if we'd have be able to do a handover leave my address but say as far as i know i've give the new address to everybody who need it so any mail that come for me be probably junk
S0242	mm
S0238	but use your judgement about that nothing have be forward at all so
S0242	nothing mm
S0238	i didn't bother to ask the post office to forward stuff because most of the mail i get be junk
S0238	erm and what's the point
S0242	yeah
S0238	in forward that
S0242	yeah
S0238	as i say i think i tell everyone as it turn out i'd forget the doctor
S0242	uhu
S0238	as i realise when i go to the doctor's
S0242	yeah
S0238	but i have i mean bank and and utility bill
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	and all of those well i don't get those in the post anyway but erm i i have tell everybody so erm but i use to even after ten years very very occasionally i would get mail for the people who live in my old house it be ridiculous that people don't just get things off their databases
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	erm you know things that be obviously junk and you just think this be mad
S0242	yeah
S0238	but i think i think it's wasteful enough to send stuff like this out in the first place but
S0242	yeah
S0238	erm to keep on send it after ten years
S0242	right right
S0238	without just check that people be still there er i mean the house could have be pull down in that time couldn't it anything could happen
S0242	sure yeah indeed indeed
S0238	yeah so my my spy who live in the house behind
S0242	oh right right
S0238	house you know tell me that they've change the kitchen you know the the you remember my kitchen have that bar down
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	that counter in the middle
S0242	yeah
S0238	that they've pull that up and and make it all into one big room
S0242	okay
S0238	well i can understand that actually because i love that whole layout and everything and it be great if you be cook
S0242	mm
S0238	people could be sit at the table and you could be sit at the table and you could put the food on the counter
S0242	yep yep yep yep
S0238	and everything but the din area be a bite small
S0242	yeah a bite yeah
S0238	erm so that's fine if you have two people there and you can manage with four but but the person who go round the far side couldn't get up and go to the loo in the middle of a meal very easily
S0242	mm well okay yeah
S0238	erm but if you have any more people than that there it wouldn't have be possible
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	erm and you know this be a young couple who possibly be entertain and i've no idea what their families be like and so on so
S0242	right
S0238	i can understand why they would decide to do that
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	erm but i think she's be a from her kitchen she can see into their kitchen which be a bite naughty really she shouldn't be do that but
S0238	erm she's see workmen come and go and sort of what's go on and i gather they want to turn the garden into a more of a vegetable garden
S0242	oh well fair enough
S0238	yeah i think it's a i keep that square of lawn because i think it's quite nice to have a bite of lawn
S0242	oh i would agree i i think a bite of lawn be a good idea but i if they're really into grow as much of their own as they can then
S0238	well i presume that's one reason why they buy the house a lot of house have have house at that sort of price probably didn't have much in the way of garden
S0242	mm
S0238	and there be enough there to do something with it it's one of the reason i buy it
S0242	yeah
S0238	erm but when i move in there be three lawns that the front bite where the roses be
S0242	mm
S0238	be a lawn and i dig that up
S0242	oh okay
S0238	and the side bed be a lawn
S0242	oh okay
S0238	and that be a real really difficult to to mow because it be slightly below the level of the concrete path and so when you get to the edge you you couldn't really do the edge of the lawn like you know
S0242	understand understand yeah yeah yeah
S0238	erm and i didn't see any point in have just lawn there because you weren't ever go to sit on it or anything
S0242	no
S0238	it be in shade all day
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	so i just er dig that up as well and and find some shade love bush which be relatively little trouble
S0242	yeah
S0238	but er no i wouldn't have want to have none
S0242	no no i well as i say i i agree with you but i can see if they really want to maximise for grow your own then fair enough
S0238	mm yeah yes cos you couldn't really do that in the front cos with those terrace well i suppose you could if you have it reterraced some a bite more manageably
S0242	you probably could but yeah
S0238	yeah
S0242	tricky
S0238	but so it'll be interest to see how they're get on with the people who move into not the other half of my house but next door and over the fence
S0242	uhu
S0238	be a young couple who'd only be in about a year and they'd do a lot
S0242	uhu
S0238	to the house really a lot you know i mean erm not just new kitchen all new windows and doors and then then they be do all sort of things with the garden because where my front garden be terrace that one be just a slope
S0242	mm mm
S0238	which be quite dodgy to work on i would have think
S0242	yeah
S0238	i don't know why have leave it like that because she be be well into her sixties by the time she move she come to this area and she be up here for five or six years i would say before she die
S0242	mm
S0238	which be just before i move here you know
S0242	mm yeah
S0238	erm and she be potter about weed she really keep up with the garden god do she keep up with the garden
S0242	yeah
S0238	she be never out of it you know
S0242	oh right right
S0238	erm and i would just have think it be she she would have felt unsafe on a slope like that
S0242	mm
S0238	but obviously not erm but they'd actually have it terrace
S0242	they have okay
S0238	well have it do it with help because they be young and fit you know
S0242	mm mm mm hm and the dog be still next be it as far as you know
S0238	i no i don't well their house have finally sell it be also for sale
S0242	oh it have oh yeah yeah
S0238	it have be for sale longer than mine
S0242	yeah
S0238	erm so whether they'd move out or not i'm not sure erm now you'd have think i'd have that conversation with the last time i saw her but that be a while ago i need to call on her again
S0242	mm get the latest gossip
S0238	well partly she be one of those people we'd chat over the wall and sometimes it would go on a bite long and you'd think i want to go back in the house now
S0238	but she be very kind and she be a good neighbour to have
S0242	mm
S0238	she watch out
S0242	right
S0238	you know and if she'd see something go on that shouldn't be go on she'd have call the police you know
S0242	yeah
S0238	erm and indeed the guy in the other half of her what be a couple i didn't i know the bloke better
S0242	mm mm
S0238	and sort of one time when i be cut my apple tree down i be make a bite of a meal of it cos i have rather an old saw and he call over do you want me to come and do it for you and i say no well do you want me to lend you a saw yes i well i wouldn't mind that actually
S0242	well yes you're right
S0238	this one's a bite ancient
S0238	erm which he do er and things like that you know
S0242	mm
S0238	and and and he there be one day when i'd be you know i be go back to check the house i'd be in and i must have open a window and and leave it open and
S0242	uhu
S0238	then we're off of course for a few days and and he'd ring the estate agent to tell them that there be a window open
S0242	oh right good
S0238	erm so you know they be really
S0242	that's nice
S0238	they be good people
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	erm but 's husband die of parkinson's oh three or four years ago now
S0242	mm mm
S0238	erm and they'd be marry for fifty seven years
S0238	er and don't have kid so
S0242	mm
S0238	you know i think she's a little bite lonely
S0242	yes yeah
S0238	so i do feel i should keep in touch and i've i've call round a couple of time and i bring her up here to see the house
S0242	oh that's nice yeah
S0238	er you know obviously she didn't have transport so i go and fetch her
S0242	yeah
S0238	but that's quite a while ago now and you know it's it's just time just go
S0238	and and probably for her it's not just go you know she i i doubt if she have enough to do
S0242	drag around the yes
S0238	yeah erm try to don't know i see my my auntie not like that at all she's get a million things that she do and you ring her up and say how be you fix next week can i come over for lunch one day and it's well i'm do so i've get monday club on monday and i'm do so and so on tuesday and i might just be able to squeeze you in on thursday
S0238	and actually last time i be suppose to go over ah it be bank holiday monday so it's not actually that long ago
S0242	right
S0238	i'd ring her up the week before and say i suddenly realise that it be a bank holiday monday i'd completely forget about it do you happen to be free well if we do something in the morning yes cos it's she do something on a monday afternoon right so i be gonna go out for coffee and then she ring me up on the sunday to say could we make it lunch rather than coffee because she be take some antibiotics that have to be take an hour before a meal and it just fit in better with the way she do things
S0242	right okay okay
S0238	which i say yes and then after i'd come off the phone i think oh because that mean it's the whole day rather than the morning
S0242	mm
S0238	kind of thing if you go in as far as from here and she be want to have lunch at twelve o'clock which be way early for me and in any case i'm just have so many problems eat that i really didn't put particularly want to do it
S0242	yeah
S0238	er the coffee have be much a better suggestion and in the end i ring her up on the monday morning to say look i've have a bad night with my indigestion which i have erm and i just think it's not a good idea sorry and she say right well i've order a taxi i'm go to go anyway that's my auntie for you i i for my lunch on my own because
S0242	nice to hell with it yes
S0238	yes erm so you and so i don't feel even though i don't see her that often and and well i mean she's get two sons anyway you know
S0242	yeah
S0238	erm but i don't feel guilty about that i go and see her because i like to talk to her
S0242	yes yes yes
S0238	she's you know erm but er mm so
S0242	so
S0238	have you finish or have you
S0242	i have definitely
S0238	you don't want another thing of coffee or anything
S0242	no i'm fine i don't nothing more
S0238	oh right erm
S0242	so the job i know about be tall man in bathroom
S0242	er the floor and the strimmer
S0238	yes
S0242	and the compost area
S0238	yes i think that's probably enough don't you erm
S0242	a good open bid as you may say
S0238	mm yes something else that i'd forget about until we be sit in there last night
S0242	oh sorry and possibly go and buy or carry some
S0238	well yes but that's kind of to do with the compost isn't it
S0242	some concrete yep yep
S0238	erm be i know this sound really the the live room window sill have get a sort of nasty plastic veneer on it which i think look horrible and i'm assume that you can't because it's shiny that you can't just paint it white because it wouldn't take the paint
S0242	okay
S0238	so i start remove it and i get part of it off and then the rest of it be so bloody well glue that i can't get it off so i could actually do with some help with that but that's not exactly it's be sit like that for a year literally so it's not erm so if we've get time we can
S0242	we can certainly
S0238	that be on my list but
S0242	put that on the erm er provisional list
S0238	so erm so i think it would make sense to look at that er bathroom thing first
S0242	i would say
S0238	and then
S0242	one two three four
S0238	yes i would say that
S0242	okay
S0238	erm so
