S0202	right tell me the answer
S0208	er we all hear our own voice as a more deep and resonant version than how others perceive it but why exactly be that put simply it have to do with the difference between air conduct versus bone conduct bone sound transmission so it's basically because we hear our own voice go through our bone it come out different than people who hear it through the air interest

S0208	yeah
S0202	like even admit that she

S0202	yeah but like like she be very er she's very easily sway
S0208	yeah
S0202	like and she do and she do want to leave because want to leave and that's what rachel's like and i understand that me and aren't really that close anyway and i don't really care about that cos she's annoy but like i understand that and do actually want to leave but and didn't and be make them and be like you're such a bitch like why be you be so rude like it's my party i've invite you

S0208	and i be like i don't i don't want to feel paranoid and i be like i don't i don't want to feel paranoid that someone doesn't like me cos it's an awful feel
S0202	yeah it be awful
S0208	especially when no one else see it and no one and agree with you and stuff you do think that you're just go crackers
S0202	but i be just give her the benefit of the doubt
S0208	yeah
S0202	like cos i've i've always get that vibe off them but i would give them the benefit of the doubt cos i be like maybe it's just me be paranoid because i be a very paranoid person i'm insecure i know that
S0208	yeah
S0202	and like every single time i've be out even for her birthday right she be actually really mean she i be mean she be mean to be pick me up when she pick every up from the train station
S0208	right
S0202	and then she say i'm pick them up and i'll have to drop them off to come and get you so do you mind just like make your own way to my house on your own like and she say that last minute like at five o'clock she's mean to be pick me up at half five and then i find out that they all go out for a meal didn't invite me didn't ask me to go and then like she be just like oh you need to get a taxi to my house like i be like okay

S0202	no and i be get the feel that i weren't want and i be just like
S0208	that's an awful feel though isn't it
S0202	and i be like why be you be so fuck mean like what what problem have you get exactly against me like
S0208	yeah i think that she's just not really interest in go outside of her circle like make the effort with new people which you know fair enough i don't care
S0202	but no need to be fuck rude don't invite me if you don't want me there
S0208	yeah but yeah
S0202	if you're gonna make me feel like that
S0208	that's that's exactly what i be go to say not everyone be gonna like you you're not gonna be everyone's cup of tea but like don't don't make an effort to like invite them to things just to purposely make them feel unwelcome
S0202	yeah
S0208	it's like i wouldn't be offend if like for example want to do a birthday thing and like didn't want me to be there i'd be like okay
S0202	that's fine
S0208	it mean but like it's better than
S0202	be there and feel like you're not want
S0208	yeah exactly
S0202	but yeah like i tell about it and when me and be on our way to chesterfield and she be like she's such a bitch
S0208	wow
S0202	and i've never hear hear say that about cos she use to worship but ever since have get with she say she's change she's not the same person they be
S0208	that's a shame though cos they be friends weren't they
S0202	yeah like really close friends but like
S0208	what happen
S0202	well doesn't like because be really mean to in the first part the start of their relationship like he be really like he be really i don't know like he be just really rude to like he'd say stuff to her and like he be use her at first and then obviously they start go out but like have never really forgive him she doesn't really like him
S0208	yeah
S0202	because change when she's with she's not a nice girl erm and like well fair enough but she still wouldn't let anyone say anything bad about but then when she say that to me on her way to chester i be just like well er it's obviously not just me that think she's a cunt then
S0208	yeah
S0202	cos it weren't cos and at the end of the night everyone just leave me everyone leave me i didn't have a phone and one minute i be with erm and and like er say about her go i'm okay and i stand there and then i go to the toilet i come back and they be all go they just leave
S0208	that's awful
S0202	and like i be like i didn't have a phone or anything i couldn't ring a taxi i have nothing
S0208	yeah what do you do
S0202	so i i literally just leave the club go to the pie shop have some pie and then get andy to ring me a taxi
S0208	yeah
S0202	it be so fuck cruel i be like why do you do that why do you just leave if you don't like me fair me fair enough but there's no need to be fuck horrible
S0208	yeah or like if
S0202	cos be batter so i know didn't do it like
S0208	yeah cos i be gonna say sometimes people will just assume that someone else have say something and then just sort of like go do you know i mean
S0202	yeah it have nothing to do with i know that cos be batter like absolutely batter especially after she lose her phone she get even more batter
S0208	yeah
S0202	like i didn't blame for it but i be just like why you know i wasn't there
S0208	yeah
S0202	like it be your idea to leave to go back to your house
S0208	she just didn't care
S0202	and she just didn't care i be just like you're such a horrible person like i don't want to be your friend
S0208	yeah
S0202	but like if you don't like someone you don't like someone there's no need to be fuck horrible to them but like i always make an effort to like to talk to them or something we're never gonna be nasty to her like cos that's stoop to her level but that's what she's like so just be wary like if you ever out on a night out and she's there then don't let them leave you
S0208	i'm not particularly like i don't really well i don't really like her i don't have any desire to get to know her better or anything
S0202	no i mean like if you're with and
S0208	yeah
S0202	just watch because like
S0208	yeah yeah yeah i'll be careful
S0202	make sure they don't leave you
S0208	well usually really good so
S0202	yeah she's she's not a very nice person like i haven't get nothing against her but i just don't like her she's just not my type of person like i would never consider her a friend or trust her
S0208	what's that you're put on
S0202	erm protect and protect and perfect just er cream
S0208	that's nice
S0202	to stop me get wrinkle cos i'm get to that age now where i need to start look after my skin
S0202	fuck old oh it's such a nice feel live in a house where it's not awkward and horrible
S0208	i know
S0202	but like i've learn a lot from the year that we spend with them like
S0208	yeah
S0202	i've learn a lot myself and a lot about live with other people
S0208	yeah i'm obviously not glad that it happen but
S0202	obviously
S0208	it's teach me a lot
S0202	yeah
S0208	so i mean everyone's well it's a fact of life you know you've get to take lessons from your life experience
S0202	yeah
S0208	it's a shame it happen but
S0202	ah yeah it be horrible when it happen i just go to put my
S0208	yeah yeah
S0202	i know i i mean i've learn to let something go like i've learn that like if it require a big deal to me make the make it but if it doesn't then let it go
S0208	yeah
S0202	and like stuff like that like and i've also learn to have a think about stuff before i do them if that make sense so like before you text someone or have a go at them or something think about it first
S0208	yeah it's not a bad thing to learn though
S0202	no and like patience as well i've learn a lot of patience cos i think well like and stuff like instead of have a go at them and like go mad about stuff i've just like just think do you know what it's not worth it
S0208	yeah
S0202	like just ask them nicely and then if they don't move it then just move it yourself or just put it somewhere where they can get it like it's not a big deal it's not something worth argue about or fall out over so why make it into that sort of thing
S0208	yeah definitely
S0202	and i'm really glad that they that i have that opportunity to learn that i mean i wish i hadn't have to learn it in the way that i do but we do so at least we've both take something from it
S0208	yeah it's not like it happen and it ruin us it happen and it make us better people it make the other half worse so i mean
S0202	but it's it also it's make this situation so much nicer
S0208	yeah cos we can now appreciate a good situation cos we've have such a bad one before
S0202	yeah cos we can appreciate it more yeah
S0208	yeah not take it for grant
