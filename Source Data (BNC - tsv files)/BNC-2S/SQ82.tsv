S0607	know our luck
S0644	isn't it your point though
S0607	sorry
S0644	what you be say earlier like you're not even allow to say anything
S0607	i know you're not allow to say anything without have to apologise
S0644	this this be it's not a i don't think it's a experiment in oh maybe it be i don't know it's more linguistics i think rather than
S0607	yes
S0644	rather than a study of cultural beliefs
S0607	they're not suppose to be easily offend
S0644	no
S0607	you can't not not not be offend or whatever it be you say last night
S0644	yeah you don't have a right not to be offend you don't have a right not to be offend
S0607	yes i get it now when you say it last night i think i be too tire
S0644	oh
S0607	but i know what you mean but i couldn't get the sentence
S0644	yeah
S0607	but by the way erm i'm i feel like i'm quite lucky because i believe in god but i don't believe all these strict things that these other christians believe
S0644	mm
S0607	erm but that but i do think that everyone can believe what they want like people can be really strict to the letter of the bible if they want
S0644	yes
S0607	erm in their live
S0644	yes
S0607	erm and i also but because i don't think that you have to be strict to the letter of the bible cos i believe that life have move on since then and things be different erm wait there there be there be a point there be a really good point
S0644	yeah
S0607	er because i because i yeah because i believe that
S0644	yes
S0607	it make me think be there people who might believe in god if they think that it could be a bite erm elastic like like me like or or do some people get put off cos they think it's all like
S0644	yes
S0607	cos i i don't think like her
S0644	no well that's this be the whole topic
S0607	and there be all sort of different type of christian church and erm whether or not they're really strict or erm
S0644	this be actually the problem with religion this be actually the problem with religion but it's because you will never get everyone to agree on everything all the time and nor should you want to do it
S0607	yes
S0644	nor should it be like that
S0607	maybe it should be a private thing cos i actually don't really like it when people ask me about my religion cos i'm like well what's it get to do with you you know it's my own private thing and it usually get people work up if you talk about religion
S0644	well they shouldn't ask you then
S0607	no
S0644	can't ask someone and then get annoy with their opinion
S0607	but do you know what i think be really bad be that erm usually most of the time if you're english and you you admit that you believe in god people look at you weird and i think that's really poor
S0607	i think that's really poor
S0607	they'll like go they'll like go really
S0607	oh i didn't think that about you i didn't think you would be like that like what you know it's like you're a fuck pariah or something
S0644	what's a pariah
S0607	don't know
S0607	i think it mean that you're somebody who's like out of society someone who's like a leper
S0644	like a leopard
S0607	shall we look that up later erm
S0644	leopard
S0607	and i think that's really rude and i think people should bloody be a bite more i should go and you don't
S0607	you bloody weirdo what's wrong with you
S0644	you're gonna burn in hell
S0607	so it mean that like my friend have to like keep it to herself because erm of the way people be about it they think you're odd and i don't think that's right oh and there's another thing i almost daren't bring this up though because if i have a discussion with about this and we disagree and it really leave me in a bad mood for about four days so i'm worry that if i bring it up
S0644	mm
S0607	but this be the other thing my dad say to me you can't talk about things where people don't agree with you you get so enrage you know when i be at home go i can't talk about skinny people
S0644	mm
S0607	i just can't even talk about it even if you're agree with me because it's so upset
S0644	no you can't go through life like that you can't
S0607	but the but this topic be a bite of a hot one i'm not sure i should bring it up but the point of the topic be the way that people immediately judge you for one thing and i find it very narrow mind and shitty
S0607	what erm
S0644	be it that you can't say what the one thing be
S0607	it's the fact that i go to private school a lot of people
S0644	oh
S0607	be really shitty about it and
S0644	that's just dumb though
S0607	i actually think that the next person who's shitty with me about it i'm gonna punch them in the face
S0607	or the verbal equivalent if i could get the verbal equivalent of the you know obviously
S0644	yeah
S0607	i don't punch people in the face
S0607	erm but i'm gonna bite their head off basically because i'm sick of it and i be really disgust cos my really good friend at work who's gay
S0644	yes
S0607	and i'm totally fine with that
S0607	so if i'm fine with that can't he be fine with me go to private school when he work
S0607	when he realise it no no no i don't think he have this be the cool thing right if you haven't tell people and this topic come up
S0644	yeah
S0607	they'll say all this stuff about it and then you go i go to private school and then they're all like so super shock and embarrass
S0644	oh
S0607	and and that that's what happen with my gay friend at work he go on a
S0644	oh do he
S0607	rant about erm how outrageous it be for anybody to go to a private school and i let him go on and on and on about what bastards we all be and then i go yep i go to private school i win a scholarship actually and erm and what i really hate be that win a scholarship like excuse me for have go to a private school so i think i'm gonna stop say it
S0644	yeah
S0607	because it's actually like an excuse
S0644	yeah
S0607	like it's not my fault i be just so clever that i get in on a scholarship
S0607	do you know what i mean and it and i realise that i actually mention it for that reason i'm not now i'm not gonna mention it not gonna give them that satisfaction
S0644	yeah
S0607	i'm gonna go yeah i go cos i'm really privilege
S0607	and you all lose out and i it be so unfair cos i get a much better chance in life than you and er and yet here we all be in the same job so i don't know why you're so upset erm
S0607	erm but no go on and on about it she couldn't stop it work her up so much cos she say erm it's not fair that some people should be able to go and some people shouldn't
S0644	mm
S0607	and i and i just keep yell that i win the scholarship
S0607	and erm and then oh yeah oh but then she apart from the fact that it's not fair it's also not better
S0607	so i be like well if it's not better how be it unfair so it's like there's no need to go because it's not even better so it's like so therefore it's fair erm
S0644	yeah
S0607	and then and then i say to her erm the class be a lot smaller that's why it's better
S0644	mm
S0607	and i'm not even gonna go into any other reason but i'm just tell you
S0644	yes
S0607	why it's better so you have thirty people in your class and i have six so
S0607	you get individual attention but of course what you just say be true it's not better so but therefore it's fair and it get really really heat and everything and
S0644	yes
S0607	and i'm i'm some privilege arsehole who should feel bad erm and i be just like well i'm i'm afraid i say to her if i could afford to send my kid to private school i would
S0644	mm
S0607	but one of them's probably gonna have to win the scholarship because it's very very expensive
S0644	mm mm
S0607	and you have to earn a lot to
S0644	mm
S0607	erm to go there
S0644	mm
S0607	and erm but i just find it i find it outrageous how people judge that that one thing
S0644	mm
S0607	it's almost worse than be a christian if you've be to private school i be really i wish i could remember some of the things that say at work about it cos i be really like but i actually do really enjoy him not know that i'd be and then and then say it
S0644	tell you
S0607	and his face
S0644	be he embarrass
S0607	yeah really embarrass
S0644	oh what do he say after
S0607	i find that i've rarely have that pleasure
S0644	what do he say after about it
S0607	i can't i can't remember isn't it annoy
S0644	cos it's it's when they
S0607	i can't remember
S0644	change people's mind or not
S0607	yeah
S0644	erm
S0607	but i would think that they would know that i go to private school cos he's one of the people cos he's like a supervisor he would have see my cv and do you think if you saw on a cv school wouldn't you think that's a private school
S0607	i dunno maybe it doesn't but to me it always sound like a private school
S0644	i think no i mean there's probably load of school
S0607	yeah
S0644	erm
S0607	to me it like stick out like a sore thumb you know
S0644	school yeah
S0607	head of house i i don't have that on my cv any more
S0607	but when i be younger you know when you haven't get anything on your cv except your education
S0644	yeah
S0607	so be like head of house game captain
S0607	i think that would be quite obvious
S0644	a giveaway maybe to someone who be au fait with things like that
S0607	mm
S0644	but someone like me will just go and
S0644	and get it
S0607	also not only private school have house but i do think it's a bite of an antiquate thing
S0644	there be this woman so one of our discussions when i be do my erm last uni and i really love it cos it be all about things like this it be all about what's right and what's wrong and what's this and you've get to really reconsider things like just when you think your mind be make up about something someone would give you another opinion
S0607	make you think
S0644	yeah and it be really really really good so there be this and this particular erm semester all these this lecture that i be go to be all about real life scenarios so there be one mp english mp and
S0607	sorry what be your course call
S0644	er it be legal and political theory
S0607	mm
S0644	it be very good because
S0607	do you enjoy it
S0644	i love it i love it i love it i love it
S0607	be it a fulfil year
S0644	yes
S0607	oh
S0644	i didn't want to leave i be gutted that it be only one year i love it i love it i love it but not just the not just the study
S0607	everything
S0644	everything it be just brilliant the place be fantastic the uni be fantastic
S0607	ah
S0644	the little cafeteria be fantastic the student uni oh brilliant
S0607	be it difficult like be it be there in any way the possibility of like
S0644	not pass
S0607	yeah
S0644	do you know this be it's the story of my life that clever really if i actually apply myself on top of be clever i'd do really well
S0644	but i can't really apply myself so there you go i'd rather go to the pub this be the whole thing erm
S0607	but it wasn't like oh my god i'm so out of my depth i don't understand what's go on or
S0644	er somehow do you know i be look last just as i be clear out some stuff before i come away here i be try to get rid of some stuff the joy process you know
S0607	yes
S0644	and i be look through some of my essay cos i really like read some of my essay and i mostly get bs and i'd never really really put myself out
S0607	excellent no that's brilliant
S0644	i mostly get bs and be who's very clever she be much worse she'd be up the night before every time and she get quite i think she get a couple of as really throw in or very high bs b plus
S0607	this be an interest thing in itself by the way because i always kill myself with things like that like literally have a nervous breakdown erm over it
S0644	mm mm
S0607	and get top mark but which it what you know it could say
S0644	i think that be a gift in itself though i think that's
S0607	be it better to just enjoy it and get a b
S0644	no cos it's always the same
S0607	erm and actually be able to relax and not kill yourself do you know what i mean
S0644	do you know what the problem be i've never be able to go when i be occasionally i do like really really work on something and at uni as well like really enjoy something and go out of my way
S0607	yeah
S0644	but most of the time it be like i could have do better than that i could have do why didn't you just try if i'd actually try and it's you get sick of yourself say that to yourself like oh yeah i could have do better
S0607	but maybe maybe you should erm try and erm accept it like live with it
S0644	mm
S0607	and enjoy the fact that you didn't have to kill yourself because i think with me it be actually that i cannot live with that i can't live with know that i
S0644	mm
S0607	haven't do my best that's a real erm not a scar what be it a erm
S0644	yeah
S0607	what's the word i mean it's a a burden

S0644	weight
S0607	it's a yeah it's a
S0644	it's a
S0607	it have a real crap what's the word it's a really simple word as well it's a real
S0644	like a burden or a scar or a
S0607	yeah not a scar but a something that weigh you down it's a real cross to bear no anyway doesn't matter
S0644	it'll come to us
S0607	yeah you know cos then you you can't ever just go
S0644	relax
S0607	and it be the same when i be apply for my own job all the time you know i nearly kill myself three time try to apply for my own job and it be like but but because i have say to myself i'm gonna die if i don't get this job
S0644	oh
S0607	cos i want it so bad so therefore
S0644	yeah
S0607	i have to like do my best and i know that if i do my absolute best they're totally gonna pick me
S0644	yeah
S0607	so i have to do my best and if i don't and then my friend erm who be also apply we be both apply for our job

S0607	oh
S0644	ah do you not see that
S0607	i really wanna do that
S0644	would you really
S0607	be cold in february though to be naked in the woods
S0644	apparently not
S0607	do you remember how cold sorry pardon me how cold it be in the in the erm
S0644	greasy spoon café
S0607	actual spoon how cold it be in the erm whatchamacallit woods
S0644	what woods in the in the red forest
S0607	the redwood oh it's difficult for me to say anything cos i be like coffee house greasy spoon safari ah
S0644	see these little towns be wicked these little place i could stop at every single one
S0607	i wish i could remember where
S0644	only be in california though wouldn't it
S0607	i need to remember whether be before or after where we're go i can't remember but anyway so go back to your this be how we get onto this me tell you about
S0644	oh can i just tell you though
S0607	it be your uni
S0644	no yeah but about the dissertation so i get by with mostly bs and the odd c
S0607	that's great
S0644	it be good until it get to the dissertation where you're suppose to you have it's like ten thousand word it's
S0607	it's the hardest the hardest part the dissertation
S0644	you have to start plan it months before
S0607	be it a master
S0644	yes
S0607	this be the problem isn't it
S0644	and i
S0607	don't you sometimes think i'd rather just have a diploma because then i wouldn't have to do the dissertation
S0644	no this this be the best example i think cos i really love the subject and what i be do i really love it
S0607	oh what be your subject
S0644	it be about animal right and how
S0607	oh of course
S0644	it's gonna evolve
S0607	fantastic
S0644	erm and no be animal and there be a really excellent erm lecture that we have on terrorism all about terrorism
S0607	wow
S0644	and it be so fascinate erm and i decide to do a bite of a combination of terrorism and animal right and the rest of it i can't remember what it be anyway it be really fascinate brilliant brilliant brilliant subject but with propensity already to not do the work when you're suppose to do it plus around that time i meet that young chap
S0644	and end up chase him about for about three weeks before
S0607	which one
S0644	the
S0607	oh the uni one
S0644	the uni one yeah he be lovely
S0644	so the last few weeks revolve around hang not hang about with him i only go out with him on like a few date it be terrible though
S0607	but be it fun
S0644	it be load of fun it be so much fun he be lovely he's he's really smart he's on youtube erm someone tell me cos he's erm do really really well with his stuff
S0607	ah
S0644	erm anyway so that just through an absolute spanner in and by the time it get round to do the work i get fifty percent which be the minimal pass you can get
S0644	so but and the reason i get that partly be cos you know they do plagiarism now like they can scan your work to see if it's plagiarise mine be forty percent plagiarise which again be the maximum
S0607	oh no
S0644	yeah it be the maximum but i be do it the night before the night before i be an absolute wreck for once couldn't even do it and she erm forgo the you know if you hand it in a week late but they automatically deduct ten percent
S0607	ah
S0644	have you hear of that so she have to do that erm and i that's the thing i be most gutted about because that dissertation i really really really want to do well and just couldn't seem to manage it i be too busy chase after that
S0607	good that you pass though
S0644	by the skin of my teeth i pass that
S0607	i also only just pass my master because of one thing that i get fifty percent on that be like interpret
S0644	really
S0607	and erm cos i couldn't do the interpret er let's just recap that i be the best one at the translate
S0644	yes
S0607	but the interpret i couldn't i just couldn't do it at all
S0644	mm
S0607	it's so difficult and then the exam the exam come and i basically so they call my teacher call me up about the result i didn't know what the result be yet
S0644	mm
S0607	she call me up and she go just to let you know what's happen erm there's be some complaints about the exam
S0644	mm
S0607	now i didn't realise this because i couldn't do it anyway
S0644	mm
S0607	but the exam be completely wrong
S0644	oh
S0607	they have use a text that be write and you can't do that you have to have a speak text
S0644	right
S0607	so they have or something like that they'd read out a completely outrageous text that would be difficult for anybody to interpret
S0644	yeah
S0607	because it wasn't a a proper speak text
S0644	right
S0607	so they'd completely fuck up which by the way i find absolutely inexcusable
S0644	yeah
S0607	to not even be able to get off your arse and find the proper text for an exam
S0644	it's pretty bad
S0607	which affect the rest of our live
S0644	yeah
S0607	so anyway she call me up and she go erm there's be an enquiry into the exam
S0644	right
S0607	and it's be find that it be completely completely er not unacceptable er inappropriate
S0644	okay
S0607	test material
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm and therefore everybody's be bump up five percent
S0644	oh
S0607	and therefore you've get fifty percent
S0644	so you pass it
S0607	yeah but only because the
S0644	the because of that
S0607	but the thing be i i sort of like couldn't stop laugh that day because i be like i hadn't pass it but i do because of the thing but actually you could say i would have just scrap it if the text have be correct
S0644	right
S0607	do you see what i mean so like i be
S0644	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0607	i be proper borderline and they use a shit text
S0644	and that help
S0607	so i go down five percent
S0644	yeah
S0607	so either way i guess i would have be dead on fifty
S0644	yeah yeah
S0607	and when she after i put the phone down i be just like oh my god thank god
S0607	because i would have fail my master because of interpret and and the reason i do both be to find out which one i want to do you know
S0644	to do yeah
S0607	and erm luckily i have the other half that could do erm but so it's amaze when you get that fifty
S0644	well i think to myself as diabolical as it be it be a pass
S0607	yeah yeah
S0644	if they if they could have fail me they would have fail me or
S0607	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0644	if they should have do they would have do so it be a pass but it's more the fact that i be embarrass cos i that really be poor i be up the night
S0644	i be up till five o'clock or six o'clock in the morning copy somebody else's work
S0607	do do some fun stuff happen with that boy
S0644	yeah
S0607	oh good
S0644	oh yeah he be he be really nice
S0607	well i vaguely remember about him
S0644	yes
S0607	but can i ask you so i wanna go back to your course
S0644	yes
S0607	but also can i ask you so your friend what's her face from ghana she
S0644	yeah
S0607	you meet her the first uni
S0644	no no no no so i finish the master degree and then have to go back to work and go to and meet her there
S0607	ah okay okay cos i cos i get confuse earlier think you've know about the theory of everything since you be eighteen
S0644	oh no
S0607	no
S0644	no no no no no
S0607	erm but so erm so your friend what's her face from ghana erm miss thingy
S0644	yeah
S0607	be a christian
S0644	yeah
S0607	like proper majorly
S0644	hell hell fire type christian
S0607	now that i like that because now i can say to you when you meet people and they announce that they're christian do you think flip heck
S0607	so you know you've get me and her i don't know if you've get anyone else
S0644	well no
S0607	it doesn't sound like you're that judgemental cos otherwise you wouldn't be friends with her right
S0644	erm i think that would be see that's i dunno if it's right so
S0607	cos some people just think you're a nutter by default then
S0644	i use to be a bite like that i use to be a little bite like that and it's not that i would ever try and change someone else's view
S0607	mm
S0644	but i might use to think to myself you know it ain't true like we know that ain't true
S0644	you've get science you've get you've get all this stuff you know it ain't true but then i learn about the theory of everything
S0607	mm
S0644	and now i see the importance of it
S0607	so really the the key to everything be
S0644	the theory of everything
S0607	the acceptance of other people's erm like you do what you want there's the buffet
S0644	well i've get a really good it i need a pen and paper but i'll i'll show you later what how it make sense and it might it might sort of help but i want what i want to tell you first oh you see there be load of subject just there
S0607	i know
S0644	there's load of subject
S0607	i think that we shouldn't be try to persuade each other to to come round to the other way of think but you can have
S0644	you can have a discussion with people
S0607	discussions
S0644	yeah
S0607	but i don't think it's right for either you or miss thingy to be try to force the other one
S0644	no
S0607	to think differently
S0644	no
S0607	but it's an interest discussion do you think that could be a key thing cos i think that's a key thing because erm people should just bloody leave you alone if you don't believe in god or leave her alone if she do erm like nobody should be say you're wrong you shouldn't be think that because everybody's different
S0644	well of course exactly that's that's the whole point be that you i'll give you a good example as well recently there be some parent it be on the radio there be some parent that write into the school and say no our children will not be join you on their trip to it be either a mosque or a church or a it didn't matter which cos they be total atheists they they just say their opinion be that it it's more trouble than it's worth it's cause so many along those line yeah so they say no we don't want our kid to go to any religious erm things we're not we be not religious we don't want them be bring up religious
S0607	decide for their children already but hang on it depend how old they be i think when you're get into teenager years
S0607	or when you get older you decide your own that stuff don't you
S0644	well as parent you you do decide cos you that's your job
S0607	yeah
S0644	when it until they're old enough so you have to do that but but what i say to be erm it's it feel almost it feel as bad to me to say we will not tolerate any religion as it as it do to say you must you must believe our religion it seem
S0607	yeah
S0644	it's it's all extremism it's just extreme nothingness if you see what i mean
S0607	people need to just learn to coexist without you know cos also what i don't like be so there's one thing be erm you hurt people because their their beliefs be different
S0644	mm
S0607	another another be judge them so me judge you cos you don't believe and you judge me cos i believe i i think that's wrong too and i'm terrible at judge people
S0644	no but this be the good thing about that be that you can't when people say about don't judge this and don't judge that all you're say really to an extent be an opinion cos everyone be entitle to their own opinion
S0607	mm
S0644	so you you've gotta not care what other people think if you if you've gotta have strong enough erm strength of mind yourself to say well that be what i think and if you don't like it get on with it
S0607	mm yeah
S0644	you've gotta not worry about what other people think and if they're that offend by what you think then they're not people you're suppose to hang about with
S0607	no cos i don't judge people who don't believe in god and so i don't see why they should jump to conclusions about me because i do but again who care what they think
S0644	yeah you can't you can't say
S0607	arseholes
S0607	oh sorry no judgement
S0607	isn't it difficult
S0644	no but you couldn't have erm
S0607	thirty six and don't know how to behave
S0607	or think or anything
S0607	have to start again aren't i
S0607	from scratch
S0644	no cos it's constantly erm evolve isn't it your thoughts about things as i be gonna that's what i be gonna say to you about religion i use to think i wouldn't actively i would never pick on someone or tell them off
S0607	but would you rule them out
S0644	i just think i don't see how you can think like i wouldn't be able to relate to it i wouldn't like you know you've get geology just just as a small example
S0607	mm
S0644	you know you've get geology and that tell you how old everything be and how and it's it's sort of it's evidence
S0607	yeah but this go back to the whole thing of erm how some people listen to the bible down to the letter and others don't like you know i don't think it necessarily mean that the world be create in that day
S0644	but that be always 's that be always 's thing she say it be true it's in the bible
S0607	she's a traditionalist yeah
S0644	it's in the it it's be write thousands of years ago it's true
S0607	she's the proper old school christian type who you know er take it all literally
S0644	well i think that's that be frighten because that's that show how erm myopic their your view be like it cannot be sway you be so and no matter what anything no matter what anyone say or anything that happen you you can't take into account the possibility that maybe something be not quite so this be what i be gonna say
S0607	can you this be an irritate thing to say can you take into account the possibility that she's right
S0644	yeah she can be right for all i care if you see what i mean like she's totally entitle to
S0607	like could be could be that her version be true
S0644	yeah yeah
S0607	i do think that you see this be why i quite like my situation because i i don't sort of like feel like the science and the religion conflict with each other cos i'm not such a traditional er by the book
S0644	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0607	christian type so it doesn't actually have a conflict
S0644	yeah exactly
S0607	i don't sit there worry about that
S0644	yeah
S0607	and what i think be really maybe this be go too far if you're not a a religious person but erm i hardly ever go to church and erm when i live in turin there's that turin shroud
S0644	mm
S0607	erm do you remember what it be it's where
S0644	a face imprint on it yeah
S0607	yeah so it's you in theory it's the thing that jesus be wrap up in
S0644	mm
S0607	and when my mum and dad come to visit me and we be do touristy things we go to see the turin shroud
S0644	mm
S0607	and i forget this be thing but usually the real shroud be not there
S0644	mm
S0607	it's erm keep because otherwise it would be like disintegrate if it be constantly out
S0644	yeah yeah
S0607	i'll have to check with dad i think it be out when we be there so that's why we go because it be like for one month the real shroud
S0644	be there
S0607	can be see and it's only in this one church this really small church
S0644	yeah
S0607	not in the centre of town
S0644	yeah
S0607	and erm so we go and we're not fanatical so we have our doubt you know we be like what do you reckon do you think it's true and all this stuff and erm so we my dad ask the priest and he say erm so you know what about all this carbon date and things like that like
S0644	yeah
S0607	be it really true
S0644	yeah
S0607	and the priest i won't be able to my dad can tell this story better i won't be able to say what he say as well as he do
S0644	yeah
S0607	but the priest say but we don't need to we're not bother about all of that erm all of those arguments be we because we just believe and we be all like yay we just believe
S0644	oh
S0607	and it be so he be so holy that guy he just make us feel wonderful
S0644	yeah
S0607	and and i agree with him like but that's what it's about for us
S0644	yes
S0607	and for people who don't believe in god they're interest in the carbon date
S0644	yes
S0607	erm whereas to us it doesn't really matter whether the carbon date back to then or not kind of thing
S0644	yes
S0607	erm and i think that be really wonderful how he kind of
S0644	oh
S0607	and we and we go off go yay
S0607	erm but i actually can't remember all the stuff about the carbon date it's really interest about the shroud but i actually can't remember the facts to tell you
S0644	well the thing be erm what be i gonna say oh there's so much to say
S0607	also
S0644	i love the discussion on religion
S0607	yeah also i do think science erm be generally reliable but could also be wrong about many things
S0644	well right and
S0644	and these erm cos i say to her look you've get a thing call empirical evidence erm which be you've get one theory i've get another let's test it by mean of which we both agree on and therefore we will be able to get a result on something
S0607	flip heck
S0644	that's science innit
S0607	yeah
S0644	and she say yes but these methods that you're talk about so say i say geology and therefore you can tell how old this rock be and and when life begin on earth and all that kind of caper she say yeah but these be man make machine and systems and all that sort of thing you know of course they're gonna be design to do that because the devil want you to and i'm think oh i give up
S0607	well she's very old school
S0644	yeah but this be the point of it be it doesn't matter because she's perfectly entitle she's
S0607	yeah
S0644	totally totally totally entitle to it and the world would not be complete without it the world would not be like
S0607	i wouldn't go with the devil theory i be gonna say erm what annoy me about science be i watch a lot of erm
S0644	bank of america
S0607	oh where
S0644	leave
S0607	leave here
S0644	yeah what i'd do turn round here right
S0607	go right yeah
S0644	well you could do
S0607	yeah oh well do
S0644	fitness train
S0607	where be it i can't even see it
S0644	it's right next to that car right behind that car i should say
S0607	oh fantastic yeah no what i be gonna say be i watch load of erm you know i love all these detective dramas and stuff
S0644	mm
S0607	and it drive me insane because one of them i watch be call the good wife it's basically lawyers
S0644	mm
S0607	and erm so each team of lawyers the defence and the prosecution always have scientific evidence and it always have completely opposite er find
S0644	oh
S0607	so one that one of them will get a scientist who'll say that this happen
S0644	mm
S0607	because base on this er
S0644	mm
S0607	test and then the opposite will will find a scientist who believe the opposite
S0644	mm mm mm hm
S0607	and then that that do throw me for a loop cos
S0644	yes
S0607	i'm not even think about religion when i'm watch these at all
S0644	yeah just go to show how
S0607	i'm not think oh this prove about god or anything
S0644	no
S0607	i'm just think how oh everything be completely erm mess up so you can't actually what you know
S0644	yes
S0607	obviously some some lawyers be really erm morally erm have no morals and they just pay somebody to say something
S0644	mm mm
S0607	but i mean aside from that
S0644	mm
S0607	it's really upset that so cos i also find science to be very like you know ah we know this and we know that but then
S0644	yes
S0607	when i watch those program which admittedly be just stupid box set
S0644	yes well no they're base on erm
S0607	but it's they're base on real life right
S0644	well the idea have come from real
S0607	it's really realistic
S0607	but you know so then so then what you know it's like
S0644	well
S0607	wouldn't you like to know more about science and stuff and and be involve not really erm
S0644	i'm not very scientific i never really get it
S0607	maybe animals you know like find out about how whale this that and the other you know whale the animals not the country
S0644	yeah yeah i'd have like to of be a animal studier
S0607	marine biologist
S0644	sort of thing
S0607	yeah yeah
S0644	but then i say that i could have do well it's another one of those things where i could i could have do that if i'd try harder
S0607	where do i go
S0644	could have do chuck a leave so there be bank of america on your leave
S0607	i still can't see it
S0644	it's a bite worry
S0607	here where the dog thing be
S0644	er well pull up anywhere you can basically cos it's about thirty second walk
S0607	but i just can't see it anywhere
S0644	it's right there man
S0644	it's probably best to walk from here
S0607	yeah
S0644	yeah erm
S0607	this be sort of break up a a conversation but it's too good to miss see a bank of america
S0607	well do you're so erm you're
