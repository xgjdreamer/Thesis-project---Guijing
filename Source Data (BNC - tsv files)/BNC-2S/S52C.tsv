S0203	i think you be
S0202	i'm bog standard and blah blah blah
S0203	rough as owt
S0202	rough as owt and but like they just look from the outside and they see this they see this person and they just think oh my god your life's amaze you're so lucky and then i think if you actually know
S0203	what you go through
S0202	what i've be through to get to where i be now then you wouldn't think that like but i don't wanna sit and tell my life story to every single person that i meet
S0203	yeah it's really interest though i'm not i'm not i've never be bore in in the last ten minutes
S0202	for ten minutes
S0203	that
S0202	thank i'll just stop talk shall i
S0203	no i'm not say that's a bad thing
S0203	i'm not say it feel like it do feel like it feel like it's a very interest i'm better off for know this
S0202	mm yeah
S0203	i don't like not know about this sort of stuff cos i might say something cos i hate talk about things when other people haven't get them that's really piss me off
S0202	yeah me too
S0203	because i've have a family where i have be lucky enough to be stable and everything so when i say things like about my mum and dad i realise that other people don't have a stable mum and dad
S0202	yeah
S0203	for most of their live so
S0202	er you feel bad don't you
S0203	identify with people so when people put it this way i've never i've never ever be er well off so my my family have always have like a holiday every couple of years like that
S0202	mm
S0203	and some of my mat have never be abroad and i can't identify with that cos i wanna say i i've never be abroad i just go why don't you save up for a bite or summat i can't really get get the grasp of it about how how it's be sort of thing
S0202	you can't understand yeah
S0203	so it's like that very interest though
S0202	no before i be my first my first trip abroad be when i be
S0203	you have roll me a shit fag here
S0202	i'm sorry
S0203	that's alright
S0202	i do roll them too tight sometimes my first trip abroad the one i pay for like i use to lie a lot so i i move out of my mum and dad's when i be sixteen and i live er i've live on my own since i be sixteen
S0203	yeah
S0202	and i and when you meet new new people they normally make an they make an assumption about you about straightaway it's human human nature you make a judgement about someone
S0203	yeah
S0202	in the first ten second
S0203	for it
S0202	yeah me too and i use to lie a lot like i i use to be a compulsive liar so like because i always want what i didn't have so i want a rich family i want experience
S0203	yeah
S0202	i want people to think that i be this person that i wasn't like i use to make up lie like oh yeah my parent take me to disneyland and my parent be well off but i just don't see them very much cos they're work all the time
S0203	yeah
S0202	it be a complete fuck lie my parent have never take me abroad my parent have never do a lot of things for me but the the one thing i could say for my parent they might not've have a lot of money to give me what i want but they always give me what i need
S0203	yeah yeah
S0202	and there's a big difference
S0203	you want for anything
S0202	no like clothe and food and stuff like that like some kid go want for that
S0203	yeah yeah
S0202	but my parent always give me what i need not necessarily what i want like a trip to disneyland or whatever
S0203	you're in the same boat that i be when all er there be some kid that just seem to always have sick trainers and stuff at school and it be the little things like that you be like why can't i have them
S0202	yeah
S0203	why can't i always have stuff like that
S0202	yeah
S0203	and then you realise as you get older it don't matter mate like your family be there for you when you when you need them
S0202	exactly
S0203	and all the rich kid that i know now be all just live off their mum and dads they don't have
S0202	they don't have any er self respect do they or integrity or anything like that
S0203	don't have any any sort of personality at all and all they wanna do be and pull bird and stuff and i'm like yeah but what be you gonna be in ten years be you gonna be that guy who sit int pub on his own like think he's mint and all this and it's like er i'm gonna have er a lot of friends i'm gonna have a good career sort of thing
S0202	yeah
S0203	and you know you you're gonna be a better person for it
S0202	even if you don't have a lot of money it don't matter you've have a better life
S0203	yeah yeah experience do count for a lot more than money
S0202	yeah
S0203	and you've have quite a good experience as far as i can tell
S0202	yeah yeah but it's not this be what really annoy me though right like people and i do it myself like i put things on facebook and the reason i put a lot of things on facebook about how amaze my life be be because a lot of people who i be at school with who bully me be on my facebook
S0203	so you can see how shit their life be and you're like look what i'm do sort of thing yeah
S0202	and that's why and that's why i brag a lot not because my life be that amaze i make out it's more amaze than it be on facebook because a lot of the people who use to bully me and use like cos i use to hang around with all the lads cos i'm not a girly girl
S0203	yeah
S0202	like i be a slag and i be a slut and i shag everything that move blah blah blah like that's what i be to all the girls
S0203	right
S0202	but all of them who call me a slag get pregnant at fifteen
S0203	yeah
S0202	and i'm just and that's why i put a lot of things on my facebook that i do because i just think do you know what you fuck bring me down and say all this shit about me but who's get a better life now
S0203	but them people they probably might seem like that but for people like me it doesn't i just think she's have a good life i wish i be have a good life sort of thing like that
S0202	yeah
S0203	i don't ever think i don't ever begrudge you it i don't ever think like oh begrudge
S0203	i don't
S0202	big word
S0203	i don't ever think like oh like oh what a dickhead for do it i would think like that's good like she's sort her zen out she's do er she she's get engage that's a pretty cool thing
S0202	no i don't know about that
S0203	do you know what do you know what though and i've i've be the last year at the uni cos i'm i'm a bite more mature than some of my mat who be like go to uni but when you go to uni at eighteen i don't think you're ready for it
S0202	no
S0202	there should be a a that's why i and that's why i go when i be twenty twenty one cos i think at eighteen i weren't ready for it
S0203	do you wanna go inside i'm cold
S0202	yeah do you wanna go inside
S0203	so erm i i feel this all all my mat have be talk about stuff that's happen and and i'm like twenty one now so i'm i'm not mature by any mean but i'm much more mature than i be so
S0202	yeah
S0203	i wouldn't've be able to handle uni but right now it's about the time i would like a steady girlfriend and i would like to settle down and you know it's not necessarily to have kid or summat
S0202	yeah but just to have a a relationship
S0203	but i would be i would be ready to ready for summat like that and er i reckon
