S0261	okay this be er session number one for the and take over the world domination experience
S0262	creators of our own universe
S0261	we shall be create something that we can make to bring both of us to er the best lifestyle that we enjoy without have the spods at work take over our world
S0262	we don't even need to mention them
S0261	no spods
S0262	they be nothing in fact there be no they
S0261	okay so from there we will just er today what we wanna try and get out of our session be to er provide a plan platform do some brainstorm about ideas and to try and get something out of 's journey to singapore and how we can tie that into come to indonesia because she might be able to experience a little bite erm of some of that connection as well when she's erm when she's around but that's more about have a cool holiday and groove and go dive and stuff like that so
S0262	yeah
S0261	if we have time to make one connection there together then that's useful but erm if it doesn't happen it doesn't happen but the idea be that at least so have a connection so that we can come back with something to er build upon anyway
S0262	mm i'd agree with that
S0261	erm so at the moment where i be i've get things that i can i can take forward out of the experience of work with and
S0262	can you see if my eye be close or open
S0261	i can see that they're close
S0262	oh that's good cos i'm listen too
S0261	that's fine erm so er part of that i can use as a tool in the short term to try and get something go erm that bring in er a small income stream but maybe on a consistent basis erm so there's a consideration of whether it's worthwhile put the time in to do that erm which i think it be because it's it's er just to have something that's kind of trickle away without occupy too much time erm and then from there er use the rest of the time to build what be a bigger plan for the future and stuff like that
S0262	mm
S0261	so if i can find a mechanism or mechanisms to erm er put in plan something that can be outsource to asia
S0262	oh yeah
S0261	then erm the part of the purpose of the journey would therefore be meet some people who can assist me in that
S0262	yeah
S0261	or at least provide me er an understand of connections of culture or how it can work without put too much effort in
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm and something that's reliable et cetera so that would be one part of the remit of the journey
S0262	mm
S0261	and the other part would be to erm er to employ my time as best as i can to bring together some ideas for what we might want to do
S0262	mm
S0261	erm so what be it that we want to do that's the question
S0262	well what what be it in the what sort of money stream do you think you can bring in for this trickle effect what's your sort of ideas on that
S0261	well erm the the small side of it be that there be erm things that i could spend maybe maybe erm probably a week develop erm through some of what the location rebel have to offer so there be income stream that be similarly relate to the blueprint that come out of that
S0262	mm
S0261	and that could be outsource erm particular write topics et cetera that people pay money for to erm put information up online
S0262	yeah
S0261	so it's simply find somebody who's a good writer erm get them to write some content and be the go between erm to front the front the client and supply the products erm at whatever quality they need
S0262	right
S0261	erm so that's one idea another idea be from the and stuff erm i just put together a simple automate kind of process for clear cut image to put up for er whatever purpose yeah erm and er you can take that a bite to the nth degree but it be to look in quickly into something online maybe spend a half day look at what kind of erm market there be out there whether it's something that's worthwhile put forward and and effectively you'd employ somebody as as as the bod who would do the clear cut
S0262	right
S0261	and so you just go to a client and you say erm give us five hundred image we'll clear cut them in a certain amount of time for a certain amount of money
S0262	right
S0261	erm and the idea would to be competitive would be able to turn it around at a very quick rate so if you've get a reliable person who can actually chew through this stuff effectively erm in theory in a day if they do a half day's work erm you'd be look at erm one every four minutes so that's fifteen so four hours fifteen so you'd be do sixty and a half days so you might actually employ more than one person to do larger quantity
S0262	right
S0261	sixty and one half day so a hundred and twenty a day but you really need to try and have that er probably at a higher level so you might have some outfit you want to have five hundred do overnight so if you can do something that's connect to a time zone where you're effectively get twenty four hour work out of a day
S0262	yeah
S0261	so you'd outsource it to one place in one particular country and another place in another country so you can send it out at a particular time of the day in such that it come back in one day and all of that stuff's do
S0262	right
S0261	yeah erm so that's one idea erm another idea be be web design effectively and that's a longer process erm that can be do under a variety of platforms and erm er one could employ a graphic designer and a web developer to do this stuff for you and you've just gotta communicate the ideas to them from your client and you you maintain the interface with your client to make sure that they're happy with what they're get yeah so i think i've get er er a small enough er awareness of of you know if you keep it simple that you can define these things such that for a particular price you get this product
S0262	okay and what i'd make a before you go and i don't know how erm busy you be busy be but i would recommend that you get a meet with 's husband and er get get some ideas some business ideas from him about what you're what you've just tell me erm because he's get a lot of international experience
S0261	in in what
S0262	and he be set up his own well you'll just have to find out but i mean he's a businessman
S0261	yes
S0262	he's be a businessman for all of his life
S0261	yes
S0262	and he set up businesses now willy nilly
S0261	right
S0262	so i would i would er talk to someone who know what the fuck business be about
S0261	mm
S0262	before you go and do any of this
S0261	yes
S0262	get some get some good ideas i mean tip and advice from a really hard core businessman
S0261	right
S0262	cos they'll shape your ideas into something that i think seem a bite more streamline
S0261	yes erm i mean i'm just poke out ideas there i expect that it's a very competitive type of market
S0262	mm
S0261	but what you get be you get people who do it as as purists they they be web developers
S0262	yeah
S0261	they do er people who do it on wordpress say they do word wordpress templates churn them out and you can charge anywhere between five hundred and several thousand dollars for that
S0262	yeah
S0261	and what you do be you just say five hundred you get this product for five thousand you get this product
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm and there be many many people who do that erm and that be actually from my point of view the quickest and easiest way to produce something
S0262	okay
S0261	because it's basically take a template plug stuff in
S0262	yeah
S0261	and adapt that to the content that somebody need you know
S0262	yeah and what another thing be be that you know you've get a certain framework in your head about what you've just mention but also when you er speak to somebody who's get potentially cos he's be here in australia for quite a long time
S0261	mm
S0262	an almost pan asian er overview
S0261	outlook yeah
S0262	he'll be able to tell you where the real action's go on and whether you're somehow align yourself with a bigger kind of you know business growth area erm and er and you know he might just turn round and say yeah you're in the right area if you forge ahead with some of these ideas grow into bigger ones or he might go no you know you're really in the wrong area for this you need to be look over here er and have er exploration you know he'll be able to make some recommendations whether you choose to follow those up or not
S0261	yeah
S0262	but he'll be er i think you know he's a he's a real businessman he's really set up businesses right now
S0261	yeah my my in what's in my head be erm that i er that i accept that some of this might not actually go into any particular growth but what it er provide be a short term measure to bring a short short term income minimum
S0262	yeah yeah
S0261	that er that also allow you the freedom and time to build the stuff that you need
S0262	yeah but it's good for you to know whether you're on a if er what what sort of trajectory be you on
S0261	if you're on a trail that's worthwhile follow
S0262	yeah
S0261	yes of course
S0262	cos you might just go okay i'll do this for a couple of months and get some trickle money come in
S0261	yeah yeah
S0262	but i also want to know where the real growth be gonna be happen
S0261	yeah
S0262	i want to know where it be even if i'm not actually go to be anywhere near it in term of develop but i know i wanna know where the power be come from these countries er where be they locate which cities be they in where do these people hang out
S0261	mm
S0262	cos if you need to go and talk to people in foreign countries you need to know exactly where to go
S0261	and erm whatever
S0262	and get access to them
S0261	yes
S0262	that's why you need people who know how to get access to people
S0261	yes
S0262	fixers
S0261	mm mm yes exactly
S0262	like you know for example erm 's dad work in business
S0261	erm
S0262	in indonesia
S0261	yeah okay erm that's that's a point erm
S0262	could you go and meet him
S0261	yeah but he'll be in jakarta
S0262	oh well
S0261	erm er well i mean there's nothing stop me make that diversion but
S0262	if you could understand why you'd meet him
S0261	you you have to just weigh up weigh up the the the benefit of do so that's all
S0262	well you'd actually have to sell it to him that he'd wanna meet you
S0261	yes of course now there that's another part of it
S0262	yeah
S0261	so we can go into that detail a bite later
S0262	okay
S0261	but erm okay so then there's there's him but er and and you know there be the context that some of these be people who have work in asia have build some connections in some context and to understand the different point of view help you know where i'll go in under there rather than up there or
S0262	mm
S0261	around that way or that way or whatever
S0262	true exactly it's look to say i want a map
S0261	mm
S0262	i want a sort of decent one to start off with
S0261	mm
S0262	you're just gonna get some map some people gonna help you then locate you on the map
S0261	yes
S0262	and then you're go to take the map and figure out for yourself where you how you need to orientate yourself
S0261	yes exactly
S0262	you need a decent enough map as you'll get lose in it
S0261	for sure and and some of these people who be in location rebel who have be base in asia do work or the other outfit all have some connection and some manner
S0262	yeah
S0261	that they've do
S0262	yeah
S0261	and some some of these guy live in china and
S0262	mm
S0261	and do manufacture in china for instance you know erm
S0262	well yeah and i'd say they're second tier because even though you're in a community of interest with them online the first tier of people the people you've get immediate you know er er erm mutual contact to people who be a recommendation from a real person
S0261	yes of course of course yes and and er and i'm right online with that so
S0262	mm
S0261	erm er one of those things an action would be to erm strike a list of those people
S0262	yeah
S0261	and contact them and even if it's just a telephone discussion to say
S0262	well i'm sure 'd meet you for a drink
S0261	right
S0262	and apparently be tell me he's get er not enough to do at the moment
S0261	well that's what she think
S0262	well that's what she say
S0261	mm
S0262	but anyway it doesn't matter the point be you're both in the slightly similar situation
S0261	yes
S0262	you've get a wife who go to work nine to five
S0261	mm
S0262	yeah and you're not
S0261	yeah
S0262	so yes you can meet for a drink
S0261	mm
S0262	cos he's quite happy to
S0261	mm
S0262	have a chat
S0261	oh okay
S0262	and he's get his own thing go on so he might even wanna run some ideas past you who know
S0261	mm see how it go
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah okay erm so as i say so action one be to er list er contact in asia in asia or with asia asia and to discuss erm mechanisms
S0262	i mean if you if you be cool that when we go to burma for example erm we get to see how effectively how businesses be be run we be just there as tourists
S0261	yes
S0262	but you know if you have a contact in er jakarta and be like okay i can meet you for maybe a morning but i really want you to come and meet this guy who'll be his two or three down
S0261	yeah
S0262	and i want you want this guy to show you our business
S0261	mm
S0262	how we operate
S0261	mm mm
S0262	you just go yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	even if he isn't in your direct line of interest
S0261	no absolutely because you might find it quite interest
S0262	because culturally you'll pick up on how business get do
S0261	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	so it's all gonna be a bite of you know experiential learn through culture and be open mind and it'll be some of it'll be direct target to what you think you know will get you
S0261	and and some of it you might see some other benefit out of have experience it anyway
S0262	yeah but it mean that if you're not too focus on the revenue stream you've get more open mindedness to actually take up an opportunity if somebody say oh look tomorrow we're gonna go out to this place er you know and we want to show you something that we're do
S0261	mm
S0262	we're build a factory of some kind you know
S0261	yeah mm
S0262	and you can go yeah alright yeah i'll come along
S0261	mm
S0262	okay
S0261	exactly and you get the opportunity to spend time and talk to people about whatever
S0262	yeah and i would really say that you're a project manager when you go to asia
S0261	yes
S0262	i would just keep it simple
S0261	mm yes exactly erm your your bang on the the money there erm so well i mean my er my er what's in my head be not kind of focus on an income stream per se it be simply erm get a lay of the land get a feel first feel of of er er of of what it look like what it feel like erm and what will be good be if that you walk out the door with er contact people that you can go back to
S0262	mm
S0261	and and and work on
S0262	mm
S0261	over a period of time
S0262	mm
S0261	to try and build some relationships
S0262	exactly and the other thing that you know you know by move from here to another country mean move temporarily shift the foci be all those location rebel people and many others they've become a different person from basically shift er from one country to the next so they leave their home country and decide i'm gonna take a risk i'm gonna go and look for opportunities in other countries cos you know that's how it's do
S0261	mm
S0262	that's a real common powerful theme and i think what you're do be you're trend in that way you're trend by say i'm go to see you know if that could work for me erm and i'm go to just you know hook up with a few people and and just keep talk all the time about what people be do
S0261	mm
S0262	ask lot of question
S0261	mm yes exactly
S0262	and you'll stumble upon something if you just keep look as a detective you're just like i'm not entirely sure what i'm look for but i know that if i keep on talk to lot of people somebody will say something which just strike a chord with you straight away and you're like yeah okay and then you don't tell anyone
S0261	yes exactly yes
S0262	mm
S0261	erm so so a part of what i've get to work out be be of course er i've get this time in singapore or somewhere else wherever that might be before i head to indonesia and i don't you know i i could change that if there be see to be er a different or a better benefit elsewhere erm if if the benefit weigh up in a certain fashion you know erm but i will er effectively have a whole week
S0262	mm
S0261	to to to
S0262	mm
S0261	you know i'm think third place
S0262	yeah
S0261	or second place i mean if you arrive in singapore you've get to at least stay overnight you can argue that the next day you can meet somebody and then fly out in the afternoon to somewhere else
S0262	yeah
S0261	and and then you're not spend all your money in singapore
S0262	mm
S0261	which be an expensive place
S0262	mm
S0261	and i would prefer it be that way
S0262	mm
S0261	erm and say you can fly to the philippines in two hours
S0262	mm
S0261	you know but er our mate kind of refer fondly to a few place as brown brown paper bag place
S0262	what do that mean
S0261	erm give you yeah
S0262	oh right
S0261	erm and indonesia er and the philippines be the two that yeah so erm you you have to be wary you know he's kind of proactively positive in his mind about give this a go
S0262	mm
S0261	whereas my discussion with the other night be quite negative
S0262	she be
S0261	she be quite negative she be negative about the context and the concept of erm try to work in with these countries and people in these countries be be at a higher level and er erm that that involve some kind of er government approval
S0262	what evidence do she have to back up support what she be say
S0261	erm er she er well what she what she say in the first place be a lot of these countries aren't democracies that quite often in order to do things you need some kind of approval at some level some authoritative level erm an example would've be be a foreigner live and stay in vietnam she have to register well her landlord have to register the fact that a foreigner be live in his place with the police
S0262	mm
S0261	yeah as an example and she say well from her point of view she be lucky because she never have a visit from the police
S0262	yeah
S0261	but that all rely on the idea that she be trust somebody else to to to to sort that out
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah
S0262	yeah well that's
S0261	so then you know and and
S0262	very vietnamese
S0261	how whatever the mechanism be
S0262	yeah
S0261	and she say six or seven years there she never once have a direct experience of the brown paper bag thing be expect to to fork out something for some benefit
S0262	yeah
S0261	however she be aware that others have
S0262	yeah
S0261	so erm her opinion be in order to try and facilitate something happen it could take you years
S0262	yeah
S0261	because of red tape
S0262	yeah
S0261	right erm and one of her her direct observations be that as a foreigner as a laowai erm that only certain people be happy work with the foreigners and that you're certainly in a minority which be expect and that your access to to to competition in comparison to locals or other asian countries be likely to be a lot different
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah that you won't benefit necessarily unless you have very good partnerships
S0262	yeah
S0261	so what you could argue be that a good partnership would be with somebody who live in asia
S0262	yeah
S0261	so they be the facilitator for that
S0262	mm
S0261	kind of thing so i er i don't know that be the right person but somebody like that somebody that we know that could be a connection who who might be live in the country
S0262	somebody somebody you can trust
S0261	who have an interest in what you're do and somebody that you can trust
S0262	yeah
S0261	and and he's get all of the the right things in the box straight away without actually have to talk to him erm and another way to look at it be that you know there be asian people who work in the location rebel society
S0262	mm
S0261	who erm who who could for their own reason have that kind of outlook too
S0262	buddy up
S0261	you could buddy up
S0262	mm
S0261	you could say and i'm very tempt to say sometimes some of the people here because with more people you go forward quickly
S0262	yeah
S0261	a collaborative kind of i don't know that i would work er with on my plan first off but er create something else together
S0262	mm
S0261	as a business strength get some money in collectively
S0262	mm
S0261	so then and the power of two or three get you a share a lot quicker
S0262	yeah
S0261	and the scale of it a lot quicker as well
S0262	and you're gonna wanna have fun do it
S0261	yeah
S0262	you're gonna have to wanna work with somebody who you know genuinely interest you and you feel that can grow you know in the right direction cos you know 's try to cut out an an er career for himself and so be you
S0261	he yeah he might wanna do something totally different but
S0262	well but that's the exploration you take
S0261	mm
S0262	you know you go somewhere so far
S0261	yeah
S0262	and then you sort of say right well be this somewhere where we can go look at what happen with and i
S0261	yes
S0262	generally interest in her as a person she must've felt the same way at one point
S0262	but then you know she she want to go in one direction i wanna go in the other
S0261	exactly
S0262	and that be it
S0261	and that's it and that and that's that's that's alright that's fine
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm and and er i think you'd draw a line and you'd say well if by this time we re evaluate and we decide whether it's something that we want to go to toward forward collectively or if somebody drop out or somebody be be buy out
S0262	yeah
S0261	at the early stage such that the others can carry on and do whatever they want
S0262	mm
S0261	and you can pick up and go on er off in your own direction
S0262	yeah quite hard to do that but yeah yeah
S0261	so you you can manage that without too much pain and suffer
S0262	yeah
S0261	and erm with without have to go to
S0262	well if you both learn each other's rope then that's sustainable but if you keep one the one person do one role and the other one do the other role
S0261	er of course
S0262	then you you'll
S0261	and and you need to very much cross culturalise that
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm and if you're collectively learn stuff together that's really good
S0262	yeah
S0261	because you're both able to say well you learn this but i learn that but we'll teach each other
S0262	yeah
S0261	and it's so much more effective and
S0262	yeah
S0261	and and quicker to do stuff
S0262	yeah and i also wouldn't be put off by people like where you know they they they've get no
S0261	no no no of of course
S0262	they've get no interest in do that type of work
S0261	no no i i i realise that
S0262	erm
S0261	and and and the reality be you're gonna have naysayers
S0262	you you can get rip shaft
S0261	yeah
S0262	rip off anywhere
S0261	mm
S0262	yes of course if you be erm in walk into a corrupt country where corruption be the way it get do erm then you have to learn to either live with it put up shut up and just work the system or or fuck off and go somewhere else
S0261	or or go and do something else yeah where you're even more relax it's it's better yeah
S0262	where you can it's more er more appropriate to you culturally but yeah it depend on how how you stomach those kind of
S0261	mm mm yeah and and i think erm er have an open discussion about these this kind of idea with and to get a sense of of those issue that he come across and maybe how he see that he deal with it because they have to negotiate that stuff all of the time i'm sure
S0262	yeah yeah
S0261	erm and er they be they've probably over time build up the right relationships but they still say they come across difficult people who try to bury them in the grind who who who stagnate and and and try to stalemate them
S0262	mm
S0261	to the point where they wanna give up
S0262	mm
S0261	and carry on with it you know
S0262	mm
S0261	so he survive that because of his sheer mind you know sheer mindedness which be good er that's why he succeed
S0262	mm
S0261	because he be like that he's belligerent erm but i think that there's maybe a few things to learn out of respective countries with that as well and i would very much like to learn to be able to cherry pick straight off i i work in these place but not those place
S0262	yeah
S0261	and say that's where i'm gonna focus the energy
S0262	yeah
S0261	and leave it at that
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm and there be examples
S0262	have you hear much about taiwan can you fly to taiwan
S0261	well i'm sure you can fly anywhere
S0262	taipei from singapore
S0261	yeah but erm relatively be it
S0262	it's pretty cheap live there
S0261	yeah yeah yeah yeah okay erm
S0262	i've hear very good things about taipei from er from
S0261	yes
S0262	very good things
S0261	so if we would just quickly let's just while we're talk about that stuff let's just quickly brainstorm and write a variety of countries yeah so we've get taiwan indonesia and that's only because we have we know somebody and we happen to be go there
S0262	yeah
S0261	but don't know what to expect erm er vietnam thailand philippines where else
S0262	that's about it i'd say for now
S0261	you wouldn't say china
S0262	no
S0261	erm and you wouldn't say any of the other countries which be peripheral at the moment cambodia
S0262	mm
S0261	laos erm burma you they're they're not on the card
S0262	no
S0261	singapore but they're the kind of i think the core countries that that i have an awareness of certain operations out of
S0262	yeah
S0261	er india
S0262	oh god you wouldn't wanna go there
S0261	well i have to write it down
S0262	oh right
S0261	because it's still a place where a lot of outsource happen and a lot of skill base be
S0262	yeah
S0261	and and you're er erm i think you're probably more likely to be able to negotiate er an understand there because of their their it's just just the english level thing
S0262	maybe
S0261	but
S0262	that's what a lot of people think
S0261	well and there's a lot of business operations that come out of it
S0262	there's actually a public lecture on erm come up this er this week about how to do business in india
S0261	right okay and where's that
S0262	business and economics actually might be on a weekend can't remember i'll find out for you
S0261	yes please erm now regardless of whether it's india or anything those kind of things flash out useful business knowledge
S0262	sure i think we be try to talk about real reality though of where you might be head to
S0261	erm yes that's right so i i want to write those down in the bigger picture sense
S0262	oh okay
S0261	which be which be these be the feasible place one might be able to go
S0262	well anywhere's feasible
S0261	yes
S0262	so you could actually keep on add
S0261	they're the these be the place where certain stuff happen that that can benefit
S0262	right
S0261	the er er er an outsource or something like that
S0262	okay
S0261	yeah
S0261	if that's the way you want to do it that's fine
S0261	that in term of in term of i wouldn't go to india
S0261	yeah
S0262	so where would you go then for these few weeks you're go away
S0261	well we know that i think indonesia vietnam possibly philippines possibly taiwan and and i i can only get a context in thailand that erm it it would it would be erm foreigners live there that be carry out those particular service that benefit you but they're go to have they'll be wise to everything anyway
S0262	yeah
S0261	so you're only if you be er be go to meet with people who could teach you stuff
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah so i don't think i'd write it off but i'd give it a small tick and from what and say erm the people of thailand naturally don't have much of a work ethic
S0262	okay
S0261	they're not very good at business they all like to think they be
S0262	yeah
S0261	but they're not good at business

S0262	mm
S0261	erm whereas the philippines have you know the american tie the english language thing
S0262	mm
S0261	erm taiwan maybe to a certain it's probably more of a a a chinese asian mentality in term of work
S0262	mm
S0261	i don't know really but you know
S0262	it'll be an interest comparison for you have be to china and then go to taiwan it's kind of always always good to see things
S0261	yeah different outlook
S0262	comparative way
S0261	the yeah that that kind of thing erm indonesia erm i'm i i really don't know what kind of fundamental basis apart from people tend to to to live there for to benefit them that's simply it
S0262	mm
S0261	i don't think that actually the indonesian people per se be the ones who be do the work cos their infrastructure's not good enough
