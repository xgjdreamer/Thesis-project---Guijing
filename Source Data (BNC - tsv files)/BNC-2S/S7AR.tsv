S0443	oh right so they be quite good lecturers then
S0320	they be very good they be very good speakers
S0443	and who organise it the conference
S0320	erm so it's english uk be the accreditation body for english language school and then they have regional erm
S0443	oh that's right cos what's her name be gonna be original rep wasn't she
S0320	who's what's her name
S0320	er no i don't think so
S0443	oh right
S0320	they're regional group so it's english uk southwest and the the one of the directors of the school be the chair and then they have various other committee people but it's a lady in actually call who be who's be who's the director of study in one of the school in the and she's be do it for about twenty years but she's really good actually she's still very enthusiastic
S0443	well she better be she be do it for twenty years everybody
S0320	no not no but all the people at all the people at have all be here for twenty years and they couldn't care less
S0443	no organise the conference twenty years
S0320	no she hasn't organise the conference for twenty years
S0443	oh right
S0320	she's organise she's be work in tefl for twenty years
S0443	oh right
S0320	and after all the lot the be normally just stick in school just don't care
S0443	oh right
S0320	like all the ones in they couldn't care less they never go they never go to anything they don't go to any seminars they don't go to any conferences they don't they don't really care
S0443	oh
S0320	whereas she be really good she
S0443	well no it's a no
S0320	she manage to convince all the people by the sound of it
S0443	well that's right when i be in the there be this really really quite lady call she be really nice but painfully shy and she use to organise the most amaze conference
S0320	do she
S0443	yeah with really funny extrovert speakers she's a bite like she could organise anything but she hat public
S0320	oh okay
S0443	limelight so if they give her a bunch of flower she look really embarrass and
S0443	she remind me of your classic kind of girl guide but she have a very dynamic partner call
S0320	oh right
S0443	who be an expert fundraiser for the university of and he be peacock and extrovert
S0320	yeah
S0443	and they end up go to australia cos get a job in the university of fundraise
S0320	oh wow
S0443	so she be er quite colourful underneath but she be just
S0443	very quiet
S0320	yeah
S0443	in public but a great sense of humour and she could get anyone to do anything for her
S0320	well
S0443	so there's the key to get the people to do it for free i've do load of it actually
S0320	that's what exactly what she do
S0443	yeah
S0320	she be really good i also know that she present this year at the conference in london
S0443	right
S0320	so i wouldn't be surprise if she twist a few people's arm while she be out there as well
S0443	yeah that's about it that's what you do
S0320	she be very good the the plenary speaker at the end of the day be very good he's call he's a big he's a big he's write all sort about teach and train and all sort of things he be he be good actually he be talk about how you learn and how you remember stuff not only but stuff and what be he talk about add a nice illustration while he be talk you have a lake of subconscious bubble away
S0443	mm
S0320	and things whoosh up to the surface and you have a epiphany moment
S0443	oh okay
S0320	and his example be his brother who's an english language teacher but they go off to spain for six months and he phone his brother and say i just i've learn these phrase and then in order to remember the phrase i just go and use them over and over and over again and then i remember and he be say his my brother's a language teacher and he's only just realise this be what you have to do
S0320	it's funny he wasn't say anything new like not many of them be but i've notice that they often don't say anything new but they have a slightly different slant and different word for the same thing
S0443	oh okay oh right
S0320	so he'd read some book that's not to do with languages at all
S0443	right
S0320	and erm have
S0443	yeah
S0320	come up with this whole presentation which be nothing new cos i've hear it all before
S0443	yeah that's true actually it's just get a different slant on it to make it entertain
S0320	very difficult to bring up anything new he's a good speaker as well he's funny
S0443	mm
S0320	erm and he's yeah he's good he's interest
S0443	erm the opposite to this girl who be really quiet be the chair be a guy call who be an amazingly funny public speaker and very charismatic could get
S0320	mm
S0443	you know two hundred three hundred people total entertain but he couldn't network for toffee
S0443	hat network just couldn't do it
S0320	how funny
S0443	so they be a funny pair they compensate very well for each other
S0320	yeah
S0443	and she be obviously a pretty deadly networker to get everyone to do everything for free
S0320	yeah definitely
S0443	and he be the kind of the brain of it all
S0320	yeah
S0443	so so be you a member of this body it sound like a professional body
S0320	er no it's not it's for school
S0443	oh right so the school of the members
S0320	so school be accredit er members
S0443	oh right
S0320	erm but i'll probably twist 's arm to let me go back to the academic meet in london actually
S0443	oh yeah you use to like those didn't you
S0320	i use to really like them yeah so i reckon i might be able to convince her to let me go to them again and it'll only be a day's travel it won't be too long
S0443	right
S0320	cos i'd i would just go up and down the meet be usually in the afternoon so i can get up and down in a day
S0443	right
S0320	erm yeah i'm hop i can convince her i don't think i'll be able to convince her to send me to i think the iatefl conference be in this year i don't think i'll convince her to send me to that again but i think that academic meet i might be able to get them
S0443	i think they'd be really good actually
S0320	the academic meet be very good i really like them
S0443	yeah that's cool
S0320	so yeah that'll be once a dunno how often they do them actually be it a few months perhaps she's now the chair of her one
S0443	be she
S0320	yeah well there's a activities one and she's by far the most experience so she's now
S0443	well she's pretty active isn't she
S0320	they'll
S0320	well she's a social programme person and operations so they must've convince her to go on the committee i think
S0443	oh okay
S0320	so yeah
S0443	so what's go to do now that he's not gonna be a tree surgeon any more
S0320	oh he's go back to do erm expeditions
S0320	she reckon that she tell me this in the summer she they she i think she must've say that he have to give it six months and she reckon he'd be count down the days
