S0631	i'll have a little bite of erm a little bite of soft cheese sometimes
S0632	yeah i've never really think about it as an option because i always drink so much milk in my tea and coffee like
S0631	mm i only i drink tea but i kind of like i drink tea in the morning
S0632	mm
S0631	and sometimes that's the only tea i drink because if i go to work i won't drink tea in a day like no
S0632	so that's a smidgen of milk isn't it
S0631	mm
S0632	in one like one cup of tea
S0631	exactly and then i'll come back home and i won't have a tea in the even most of the time because and if i want to i'll have green tea
S0632	erm yeah no that's a good option i need to drink more green tea and herbal teas really because
S0631	there's still caffeine in green tea and that's all you really
S0632	that's true i've get my sweet rhubarb i like that but it's a different thing it's just a different
S0631	though

S0631	mm
S0632	one have get like no calorific content whatsoever what do

S0631	erm mm or something
S0632	yeah

S0631	all about the rice but i love rice
S0632	well i like an interest rice so i've never have a rice with cauliflower cheese before which and i don't know if that's weird to you
S0631	mm
S0632	be it be it something that you
S0631	some people just haven't i'm all over it love it
S0632	it's just it's not tradition in my house
S0631	i love it
S0632	i think it's mean to be like a handful per person but i put in
S0631	i dunno
S0632	two handfuls per person cos me and eat a lot
S0632	rice brown rice no less
S0631	i don't know how much erm be in erm ketchup because i have a lot of ketchup yesterday because i buy some pop chip and a sushi
S0632	mm
S0631	and i have a dollop of ketchup and normally in place of that dollop of ketchup i'd have have a little slimming chocolate bar
S0632	ah
S0631	i don't know whether be more
S0632	no
S0631	it won't be be more than a little chocolate bar
S0632	no
S0631	the same calories shouldn't be eat
S0632	yeah maybe
S0631	to be honest
S0632	well you say you say this morning that you'd lose eight pound this year
S0631	mm
S0632	so do you weigh yourself this morning and that's how much you've lose in total that's amaze
S0631	well i get get on the scale and it say erm ten stone eight and i'm no and i be that the other day and i be like okay that's fine
S0632	yeah
S0631	but then i get back on it this morning and it say it again so i be like but exactly the same for the same quarter
S0632	so the same quarter wow
S0631	and i be like
S0632	that's a good system
S0631	i be like okay so i get off it so i give it a kick like to see if maybe the floor or maybe it be just kind of stick on the same weight as i get on and i get on again and it go ten stone six so i be like right better but it could be the floor
S0632	yeah
S0631	so i get i move it around a lot and i get on
S0632	yeah
S0631	it again and i get on it again and it keep say the same thing
S0632	i've do that for i i have three different read the other morning
S0631	yeah
S0632	and one be lower and one be higher
S0631	obviously
S0632	and then the one in the middle
S0631	yeah
S0632	keep come up over and over again when i move it to a different point and i be like
S0631	yeah
S0632	and again and again and again
S0631	yeah get on it
S0631	and i be like it it would be very strange for it to be precisely the same weight as the other day
S0632	yeah
S0631	when erm like to the same quarter of a pound
S0632	yeah
S0631	and erm so i think i'll move it cos i expect it
S0632	yeah
S0631	and then well hopefully you know
S0632	yeah finger cross
S0631	i keep move in that direction so you think it would be
S0632	yeah
S0631	so i move it on the floor to a floor that because you know the floor be obviously the floorboards get creaky
S0632	yes
S0631	so maybe it be just sit differently so i move it a lot and i keep get on it and move it around and it just keep come up with ten six
S0632	that's really good
S0631	my lowest last year be 10 five
S0632	like you be it's like why than my goal
S0631	oh do you know what erm and that's why it's
S0632	yeah i mean i know but it actually do make a big difference and i have to
S0631	yeah
S0632	remind myself that
S0631	you be i be shorter
S0632	because yeah i just can't even imagine weigh that though
S0631	i just don't want to have the wobbly bits do you know what if i get to nine something
S0632	mm
S0631	i'd feel like when i be like i be the size i be at school
S0632	oh
S0631	and that's kind of like what it's all about
S0632	i think i be about twelve and a half at school
S0631	okay
S0632	and that's like when i look at people obviously at the time i think i be huge a huge heffalump
S0631	i think i be huge though
S0632	but isn't that ridiculous
S0631	it be ridiculous
S0632	and then you look back and you're like
S0631	do you know what though at school i wouldn't have walk around in a bikini i wouldn't though
S0632	no
S0631	so
S0632	no chance you'd have be mortify
S0631	i wouldn't have ever get in a bikini and walk around no i didn't at school
S0632	no i know i know i know
S0631	but i would
S0632	i do have that vision initially of just like
S0631	it would have be but it would have be inappropriate wouldn't it
S0631	but i wouldn't have i wouldn't have just come to and get in a bikini but because now i'm bigger than that obviously i'm a bite like oh no why wouldn't i have do that then and i wouldn't do it now
S0632	it's the curse of a teenager to be like the slimmest that you're like probably ever gonna be and then also hate your body more than you'll ever hate it because
S0631	yeah
S0632	you're a teenager
S0631	but then it's the legs thing so really i just need to get my legs move it's cardio rather than strength and stuff i need to do
S0632	do you think so yeah
S0631	i read it online if you cardio just like burn it away where it like like it doesn't build up muscle as fast as the cardio
S0632	no and it do build up yeah but like less
S0631	yeah it it do
S0632	yeah
S0631	but it's not like i'm just gonna put on like i'm do the bike thing again now
S0632	you should do your special sofa cycle
S0631	oh god
S0632	that you be do the other night
S0631	yeah
S0631	oh
S0632	where else though to be honest
S0631	it i don't i be just like ah ah
S0631	sofa cycle be good though i like that erm but yeah do you know what part of it probably be though
S0632	mm
S0631	it's probably because of my sister because she be significantly tinier
S0632	so that
S0631	and i'm not try to be like that cos i don't
S0632	no no but
S0631	want to be
S0632	i think when you have a sister who be like significantly small that
S0631	her legs be too thin have you have you
S0632	i think i have like i think i i do see her when you
S0631	if you see her in skinny jeans her legs be like
S0632	i've always think that be really really slim
S0631	she yeah she be
S0632	yeah
S0631	erm but if you see her in jeans like i take her out for her birthday like last year and erm only to like out for dinner
S0632	mm mm
S0631	come on let's go for dinner erm and she wear jeans and i be walk behind her and be with us as well and i
S0632	mm
S0631	her legs be too skinny and she have admit that she's be a bite obsessive generally not like she have be previously obsessive but then i suppose if you're try to maintain be it doesn't mean you actually be ill it just mean
S0632	yeah
S0631	and then she be naturally thin she's slim she's a slim person
S0632	yeah i mean people people be
S0631	but you see you see her legs be really tiny but i just i don't wanna walk around like on holiday with my legs go woohoo
S0631	and it's like and hers be just like that i don't i'm not like i don't want to be that size
S0632	but you
S0631	i really don't
S0632	well if you're just happy you know if you've like accept that you're not go to look like your sister
S0631	but i don't want to
S0632	cos you're different people you just want to be happy
S0631	cos that's stupid
S0632	with yourself
S0631	yeah so like there's that there's that
S0631	it's that it's all there that's where it be now and it need to come off there
S0632	i think yeah if you do that sofa cycle that'll be it
S0632	you know what i just need some amaze result from workouts in just a few months like not just not not
S0631	yeah
S0632	even not even when i'm jog jog on the spot because
S0631	why do we not just do this anyway
S0632	yeah just like cook and jog
S0631	we could one day one one treat day we could get a really nice picnic but then
S0632	mm
S0631	we could go on a boris bike around hyde park
S0632	let's do that that's a nice idea
S0631	why be we not do that
S0632	i think maybe treat day could also be like exercise day cos then you're like you know what
S0631	and it's a day off
S0632	yeah exactly it's always a day off and you know how food always taste better if you work for it like if you're really hungry
S0631	yeah
S0632	you're gonna appreciate that burger a lot more then
S0631	and we might not feel so shit after we've eat it either
S0632	no because it'll be like necessary
S0631	and my appetite do get smaller but i always feel like just say no put it all on all on
S0632	it's the greed of like oh i really want all the and i've only get twenty four hours to eat everything i want
S0631	oh we can oh we can
S0632	we can
S0632	i don't know if i'm mean to be do anything else all i'm do be boil rice erm that take age
S0631	i'm do now
S0632	okay
S0631	i need to vomit
S0631	oh i'm gonna retch in the sink
S0632	it's full
S0631	oh dear let's go in the bin then
S0632	go in the mop bucket and like which i still haven't take outside
S0631	it's alright like every time somebody
S0632	yeah it's like kind of handy though to have because i've be do that too and go eh just get it
S0631	yeah maybe we should get you know one of the flat ones the cheap flat you know
S0632	that's the swiffering type ones
S0631	and then just spray the floor a little bite and just go this and just of course spray it do
S0632	yeah
S0631	so it's not wet then
S0632	so true
S0631	so so true
S0632	a nice little and then you don't need to do the big mop as often
S0631	no
S0632	oh good there's lot of egg
S0631	of course
S0632	of course
S0631	that's i i say though didn't i
S0631	you'd go on this diet and i'm gonna go for egg like there's no tomorrow
S0632	that's true you do say that and i love an egg
S0631	i love an egg and those ones be free as well box
S0632	they're like add extra bickies
S0631	be they nice be they nice
S0632	they look nice yeah they look
S0632	egg
S0631	oh they're big
S0632	they be big
S0632	i be gonna do some fish with this dinner
S0631	i'm gonna start buy freeze food you know but not freeze everything but
S0632	some things freeze be really handy
S0631	yeah i'm gonna just start buy quorn and put it because ocado sell more quorn products than tesco they just have a better range and so i say to if i get a fresh box every week do you wanna just once a month quorn shop
S0632	yeah
S0631	but i'm think i might cancel all that fresh box already because it's just and to be honest there might be a broccoli in there that look really nice but it's still cost me two quid and it cost me forty nine p at tesco
S0632	yeah i do think that's a particularly big healthy look broccoli but two pound
S0631	yeah just be nice
S0632	yeah
S0631	but it's like
S0632	no
S0631	i might as well because it's organic and it's not
S0632	yeah that's so true
S0631	yeah
S0632	and it's like oh no now it's go off instantly
S0631	yeah and like as good as good as it be to eat organic and stuff at the same time i'm a little bite like well if you throw enough of it out which i hope not to and that's why i've get might cost me twenty quid a week but throw some of it out but actually
S0632	yeah yeah
S0631	i like the novelty it's the novelty that's
S0632	i know i order some one of these eat fresh box and and i do it for like a week or two but i be like actually it's not worth the money i be like maybe it will be but then like actually have it and see the money go out of your account be a bite like no it's not really worth it
S0631	yeah i might keep box if my money's gonna go down i might box because i like that
S0632	mm that be one of the things though like i i use to when we be talk about though where do your money go when you've get plenty of money because like i be on more money at i be on more like one thousand five hundred a month
S0631	yeah
S0632	one thousand seven hundred i think i be on
S0631	yeah
S0632	and erm but obviously you know save for the wed and everything and then i would i spend fifty pound a month on gym membership and there be all sort of
S0631	you just do don't you you kind of
S0632	like hair appointments
S0631	be it within your mean yeah oh i'll do it then
S0632	yeah go for like wax and things before my honeymoon and it all just add up to the point where i just didn't feel any better off than i do now on on less money
S0631	be it be erm the thing though isn't it like there's only a certain amount you can earn where you just start live differently
S0632	yeah
S0631	so like say you could be on like fifty grand a year right but you're not gonna live any better than somebody on thirty grand a year because you'll just have a better car you'll have a more expensive car
S0632	it's true and then there's tax
S0631	and you'll have a more expensive rent
S0632	it's true it's true you'll just you'll get a nicer car and a nicer house
S0631	but you'll live the same
S0632	but you realistically your lifestyle will be the same and er you get up to a certain amount and and most
S0631	it won't make you happier
S0632	most of it go in erm go in tax and i like i be pay a lot more tax and pay back my student loan a lot more at as well so a lot of that money would go out of my account before i'd see it whereas now i'm on i'm on such a small amount that i don't pay back my student loan
S0631	mm
S0632	at all and i'm pay tax but they tax me a stupid amount when i arrive and now they can't charge me any more because i've basically i've pay all the tax that i should in a whole year in one go
S0631	yeah yeah put on emergency tax so you would get a rebate until it balance out
S0632	yeah and now it's like my wag just go in and i just get it
S0631	mm
S0632	apart from when it doesn't work and
S0631	i pay a little bite national insurance
S0632	yeah
S0631	but i speak to that who i work with cos basically the reason that i've be tell to by be because the one pharmacist and he be like basically manager bitch about how like he's not happy and he doesn't wanna have no dispenser in like so into the even even though like you have train but whatever
S0632	yeah
S0631	so obviously she's base in the him that that i work with that i work with she do every day she work every day but she work seven thirty until fourish but they wanna move her hours so she start later slightly later so she's do eight until half past four but she's get childcare arrangements in that it's her sister's child that she look after that enable her to sister to go to work
S0632	okay yeah and then swap
S0631	so she so yeah there be a childcare issue for her and so so actually though the reason that i'm not allow to work there be literally it would take her three hours every even oh no on the thursday even they won't have a dispenser because in three hours i
S0631	they're so stupid
S0632	so i'm i texted her say do you reckon and she ring me back and she chat to me and that's how i know about
S0632	uhu
S0631	because then move her hours it would make it so it's literally three hours
S0632	yeah
S0631	erm
S0632	that's that's like nothing and you're say you could get your work do way ahead of time so
S0631	i could get it do by five and then i'll be out the door earlier but if i just happen to stay later
S0632	if they're will to be flexible it would save them money
S0631	mm exactly and then so like it's like either they have me like apparently my the two pharmacists there's who's erm who's a snake right i get on with the him to his face apart from when we do argue and i tell him when we're get on and we argue
S0632	yeah
S0631	you pick arguments with me and anyway but he's a snake right but then there's who be completely fair and completely nice which maybe a little bite too he he say he's too nice and i tell him there's no such thing as too nice but like if there be such a thing as too nice
S0632	he would be it
S0631	right erm but he even pick up and do you know what you've do though right you've stick your oar in about have to go to uni have mean that now we don't have a dispenser you're gonna have to work on your own now anyway because we don't we won't have a dispenser because you say
S0632	but for way more time yeah the three hours
S0631	yeah you've just make it worse
S0632	do she say that to him
S0631	no he say that to no he say that to
S0632	oh
S0631	and so be very much just he doesn't care just do whatever
S0632	ah okay phew
S0631	so she's just respond to what say to her about how erm for three hours so anyway i genuinely really good dispenser from now
S0632	yeah
S0631	i'm an old school now
S0632	yeah you look better in dispenser now
S0631	yeah because i be i be teach the old school way
S0632	yeah
S0631	and then they change it so that now people be learn stuff on the computer but then they're never actually do the practice so no one's any good like not job but they're not throw in up at the deep end okay
S0632	mm
S0631	and so she's say
S0632	i wish i do
S0631	it's just ridiculous i wish i could get cos part of me say that i be you record me
S0632	i be
S0631	well part of me say that i don't even want that job now
S0632	yeah yeah i know because like you'd have to work for her and
S0631	uhu
S0632	and
S0631	if it wasn't that down the line but what
S0632	yeah yeah you can look at it that way as well and just think well i be a little bite like that at as well and i be a bite like i kind of i didn't really feel like i be gonna get push out any time soon but i could see it happen to people around me
S0631	mm
S0632	so i be like i'd rather jump before i be push
S0631	yeah that's like how i feel yeah and so if someone know that so that er at she will genuinely always be lovely
S0632	yeah
S0631	and so part of me just think do you know what she'd look after and then they get really funny because i leave
S0632	mm
S0631	and now she's help me again just
S0632	such a nice person
S0631	yeah

S0631	no
S0632	like it's not it it's not structure that way
S0631	because they're not they don't run morally they run regard number and i be say though to my friend that like i i don't believe that you can have it both ways if you've get target i don't believe that you have to be a strict manager and to achieve those target
S0632	no
S0631	and you're kind of diplomatic and you respect your staff and help them out where you can they will help you out and cos then you're just put won't you
S0632	yeah
S0631	as long as you make everyone happy in their work
S0632	yeah absolutely it's
S0631	and you wouldn't have to be one of these managers that go around threaten you shouldn't manage by threaten
S0632	threaten people do not work no
S0631	to achieve what they should be achieve you should
S0632	i work rather well with the system myself
S0631	i yeah
S0631	i work well if i've get someone i'm actually like who be actually gonna say thank you
S0632	yeah
S0631	because the thing be i be also say to erm her though as in my friend
S0632	aha
S0631	erm that if so we have stupid target service blagging people up that need review right so she'll come in and she'll look and she'll see she'll say she'll see say if i do ten sign up that day she see that as a good result someone could come into work and they could be feel unwell and i could be spot that as sign of a heart attack call them an ambulance and send them away
S0632	yeah
S0631	heart attack
S0632	but that wouldn't be
S0631	and there would be no recognition
S0632	nothing for that yeah that's stupid
S0631	and mine mine be a job where and i'm do this job because i wanna do this job well and to do the job well i'll probably just need target hand in hand
S0632	yeah
S0631	don't come in and just take all that away from me about be a nice you know be a good person and do the actual care
S0632	yeah
S0631	side of the job well
S0632	like actually focus on completely the wrong aspect
S0631	yeah
S0632	of like what should essentially be a care profession really
S0631	everything everything be remove from like the focus be should be on care and stuff and that's completely remove by have erm me do a tally chart of the things i've do that day
S0632	yeah
S0631	and it's all hit and miss because they don't have many customers so erm be that cajun

S0631	it's get like yeah i think what it be really erm yeah but there's no explain that to that lady i can tell but i'm gonna er explain that to the area manager though and i'll say like i know it's about target and things but i do believe that you can do the two and you can be a
S0632	yeah
S0631	nice manager and have everybody respect you for be a nice manager and i might say that's why this like that's why who take me on be brilliant because you want to do well for her
