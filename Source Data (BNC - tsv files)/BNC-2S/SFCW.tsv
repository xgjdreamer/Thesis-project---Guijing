S0263	international corpus you've decide to help them out
S0264	yeah erm i think by the time you oh yeah you've gotta well you have to sign er a form just
S0263	i'm
S0263	i've sign up for the erm corpus mooc start in september
S0264	oh yeah that
S0263	just to add to my things to do
S0264	that's the the the repeat
S0263	it's the repeat
S0264	of the one that i sign up for and never carry on with yeah
S0263	yeah i'm go to i'm go to maybe not do all of it but look at some of it
S0264	the first week or two be be quite straightforward cos you just watch a video and they they make sure it's all bite size and you and you click when something be do it give you a great feel you've you click through all these things but then it start get more demand
S0263	after a bite yeah
S0264	the problem erm
S0263	so what other grievances oh yes oh i have you know the students
S0264	yes
S0263	they be quite tricky
S0264	yes
S0263	do you remember
S0264	i do er
S0263	er so i go to the end of year sort of examiners' meet and a get a few email beforehand from the head of that
S0264	their kind of tutor their course tutor
S0263	yeah and she say i need to speak to you so i say okay so from the email i think well it's go to be something negative so i be expect the worst i have get i have get them to do some transcription do you remember so i think it be gonna be about that
S0264	oh your transcriptions
S0263	i have get them to do some work on the law and things like that
S0264	well they agree
S0263	they agree and they all so they seem happy enough anyway and they like they like have you they say
S0264	oh
S0263	and erm
S0264	that's unexpected after the last session
S0264	they nearly
S0263	well they be not they weren't great be they anyway
S0264	i think that it be very french i mean that's what i i tell tell you when you tell me about the riot and how the kid upturned the cars
S0263	mm
S0264	i think this i like this about france they they can say what they feel
S0263	yeah they're very
S0264	demonstrative
S0263	the opposite of what the experience i have here
S0264	mm
S0263	and the oh and erm
S0264	so you go along
S0263	she say yes erm you've get to change your course you know the students be not happy with it and i be they er they want to do a they want to do more things like cvs and i say oh but we do cvs and we do video cvs
S0264	yeah and why didn't they tell you anyway
S0263	cos i get this cv idea from you the video cv
S0264	can't remember
S0263	you film yourself do sort of presentation well it i think it be i don't know
S0264	somebody else but
S0263	anyway
S0264	a good idea yeah
S0263	i say oh well okay and er so then she say well i suppose i say well i i need some more concrete sort of feedback shall i write to the students and say would you mind give me some feedback
S0264	mm
S0263	and then so i send them that
S0264	mm
S0263	and the feedback that i get be absolutely lovely they say we really appreciate it
S0264	oh
S0263	cos it's not at all their style to sort of say that they like things when they don't
S0264	no cos they
S0263	they say
S0264	no no
S0263	we really like do the workshops
S0264	mm
S0263	erm one guy say i don't usually like english but as you let you let us a lot of you let us have a lot of freedom and erm i be happy to you know i think i think that's what they need to not to be sort of mithered too much they be want a lot of freedom
S0264	it wouldn't work with them would it
S0263	no
S0264	they'd just rebel
S0263	and i get really nice and the last after you leave we go to the to the pub with some of them and i give them all my second hand book that i don't want anymore and they be really touch by that
S0264	mm
S0263	and they say i'm read er i'm read some of the book you give us and
S0264	you mean novels or what
S0263	novels yeah and the feedback didn't at all correspond to what this woman have say
S0264	but do you make this woman read the feedback do you er send send the feedback to her
S0263	no cos she doesn't read english she doesn't speak english she's always go on about how she doesn't speak a word of english
S0264	well i reckon it would be worth translate that feedback cos it's so such a contrast isn't it i
S0263	think so it make me feel pretty low already just have a low
S0264	mm
S0263	end of term and then i get this criticism and i be think oh no and then i get the feedback from those students which be really nice which really cheer me up
S0264	yeah but it make you wonder where do she where be she come from where do she get this idea from it must have be one student on one morning or maybe she say what don't you like about er 's course
S0263	and also it be interest you know when you give feedback you usually say one well the the sort of practice be to say one nice thing and then
S0264	one thing for improvement say
S0263	and she didn't say she go straight into you know negative negative negative as if the whole thing have be a and i be think well that's not the impression that i get at all
S0264	i think you've gotta be quite clever to manage that group because it's a it's quite a large group and they're not linguists they're it so they don't perceive language to be necessarily the most useful thing for them
S0263	mm
S0264	and so if you can manage that which you have which you do
S0263	so i'm a bite i'm sort of erm a bite feed up with er
S0264	mm
S0263	university
S0264	yes would you like some fruit i've get a whole bag of stuff here
S0263	but i could imagine it's erm the same anywhere
S0264	within reason i think that's i think that's true but i
S0263	thank you
S0264	i once work in erm and
S0263	thank
S0264	but now i be well actually the staff be alright but he be very good because he be very mm what's it call democratic he he put people into er little committees er with a revolve chairperson and say okay you're in charge you're you this group be in charge of it procurement or it development for the department
S0263	mm
S0264	and so he would delegate decisions it be quite clever really
S0263	mm
S0264	so you felt involve i think
S0263	mm
S0264	you felt that it be a kind of more a flatter organisation rather than have say make all the management decisions
S0263	mm anyway and then i've have a horrible shock cos i've see er the accommodation here and last time it seem to me that i pay a hundred and something for the week
S0264	
S0263	yeah
S0264	mm
S0263	and erm i get a bill for two hundred and eighty a week the only difference be that i've get a pull out bed that you can pop up it's the same room
S0264	but that's erm you should be pay less not more if it's pull up shouldn't you more like a studio than
S0263	well i've get one bed and the pull up before it just have
S0264	well why don't you ask them to change to er the other room
S0263	well i ask for a sort of family room for
S0264	oh that's why
S0263	for and to come
S0264	that's why
S0263	but actually here i'm all on my own
S0264	be not come
S0263	he's go off cycle
S0264	where
S0263	but he'll be come down then
S0264	oh be he in the uk
S0263	no he he he go back yesterday he stay one night here so i oh i've get eight hundred and something bill
S0264	oh my gosh that's a lot
S0263	well three weeks
S0264	gosh
S0263	erm
S0264	why couldn't you okay why don't you negotiate with them and erm move into a small room for two of the weeks i mean er when be gonna stay with you be that whole time or
S0263	next week
S0264	for one week or
S0263	every other night
S0264	oh i see you why every other night that'll disorientate him
S0263	because work every other day
S0264	er be his
S0263	my my brother
S0264	oh i meet yeah
S0263	yeah mum mum be too old to look after him on her own so she can only
S0264	so that's the deal
S0263	look after him when work monday friday wednesday friday mm
S0264	that's annoy because erm if you could persuade to have for a whole week then
S0263	well they be this week
S0264	then you could go into a smaller room
S0263	mm
S0264	save some money and then move back into the family room
S0263	mm there's no difference in the size it's just
S0264	yeah
S0263	but it's get a slide it's you know it's those bed that fit underneath you know
S0264	yeah but they obviously make a well ask them
S0263	i will i feel a bite embarrass cos i get give the bill sort of stand there and look at the figure
S0264	your jaw drop
S0263	and then i go off
S0264	you probably didn't even take it in do you right at that moment
S0263	i didn't take it in and then i speak to my mother and she's last this morning and she go what
S0264	what
S0263	ah you how be you gonna pay for that and i be like i don't know she no she be say how be how be you gonna pay for all these extravagances
S0264	well except it isn't it isn't such an extravagance be it it's not like you're stay at i don't know the holiday inn or something
S0263	well it would be a hundred a night if i be stay in a hotel
S0264	mm and what what be it here fifty something
S0263	thirty seven
S0264	thirty seven that's good
S0263	so it's still quite cheap isn't it
S0264	yeah i mean it's cheaper than er er what do you call that chain erm not ibis the other one with the moon the half moon
S0263	holiday inn
S0264	no but it's one like that
S0263	
S0264	similar
S0263	premier inn
S0264	yeah premier
S0264	premier that one
S0263	so
S0264	that's quite cheap
S0263	the thing be a do get you know i pester them to have that room with when i be last here in march so they do they've make a sort of compromise cos i'm not really suppose to have children in there
S0264	oh i see
S0263	so i don't feel i want to sort of quibble now about
S0264	no but you could er you could ask rather than quibble
S0263	mm
S0264	i mean it could be a question
S0263	so i could say
S0264	can i check something
S0263	mm
S0264	that's like how it be originally put it
S0263	i be surprise at the figure cos it be i have to go back to my old email or from march and see how much i pay then
S0264	well
S0263	it be it's this be my own fault because i didn't get the firm price through the from them it be all up in the air
S0264	well you wouldn't think would you because you you've stay there only last year so why would you think it would be different
S0263	well not last year er a few months ago
S0264	oh yes it be only a few months ago
S0263	it's er
S0264	well there you be
S0263	feel like a year ago
S0264	yeah
S0263	so i'm gonna go back and see how much i've pay and say you know why be it double the price
S0264	mm
S0263	and
S0264	no i think that's perfectly reasonable
S0263	it could be yeah
S0264	i be gonna say that one of the erm the you know one of the change about this place be the erm outsource
S0263	mm
S0264	but be er independent isn't it
S0263	mm
S0264	so
S0263	what's happen about that have they still all well the same staff or so it seem have they er outsource or not
S0264	yeah they've take the same staff on i think the exist ones be suppose to be more or less under the same condition but all the new ones presumably under worse condition and also the room at the end of my corridor with the erm researchers in there's one very deject because he spend most of last year help with the campaign
S0263	mm
S0264	and so he get a he didn't get his he didn't submit his phd on time and now he's in overtime you know when you pay
S0263	continuous
S0264	yeah so he pay a low fee but get no money come in so
S0263	a continuation
S0264	yeah so he's look very sorry and
S0263	i didn't know you have researchers at the end you've get a study room have you at the end of your corridor
S0264	on the right hand side opposite the language study room be the researchers' room
S0263	mm
S0264	for the philosophy students
S0263	philosopher
S0264	yeah
S0263	philosophy
S0264	yeah it's that sort of mix corridor yeah in fact it's quite a strange corridor
S0263	mm
S0264	he's get some teach come up autumn term that'd bring some money in but until then probably live on nothing
S0263	mm
S0264	don't think he he's
S0263	i be think maybe i could do some work if it's in the summer not that i particularly want to but
S0264	no and what could you do anyway erm it'd erm it could be something horrible like you know some service type thing
S0263	mm
S0264	well you could just be teach and go and see erm or
S0263	mm mm
S0264	and offer to poison the water supply
S0264	and erm do some teach cover
S0263	mm
S0264	i think that be 's job cover
S0263	cover
S0264	but
S0263	for people who be sick
S0264	yeah but if two people be sick
S0263	yeah
S0264	or there might be some development work to do you could offer to erm write some materials or something
S0263	mm uhu i'll have a think i'll have a look at my finance
S0264	i think that's the that would be the best option and the better pay option compare to work behind a counter somewhere
S0263	mm
S0264	you could try the library by the way that wouldn't be so well pay often in the summer they take on people usually undergrads i think to do various weird things they don't have time for in the year
S0263	oh right
S0264	like vacuum book
S0263	vacuum book
S0264	cos yeah they do that all last summer it be horrible
S0263	oh yeah i tell you what after spend three weeks with my in laws i when i go back to i'm gonna have the biggest tidy up they live
S0264	oh no
S0263	they live in such clutter you can't believe it you cannot you can't even walk in and they've get both get crutches and rollators and things
S0264	why
S0263	there be pile of paper every guardian that they get and they get it every day they don't they keep they keep
S0264	every garden they garden
S0263	every guardian
S0264	guardian
S0263	paper newspaper so that you've get pile
S0264	yeah
S0263	like ten pile of guardians nearly like this high
S0264	what do that say about that explain a lot doesn't it
S0263	it's bonkers
S0264	i think you can
S0263	it's really bonkers like old estate agents magazines from nineteen eighty five like and just clutter break things things that be break
S0264	which they be go to repair one day
S0263	so i'd say do you want to keep this they've get three or four of everything as well which be very bizarre five potato peelers erm i say well shall i throw this away it's break oh
S0264	no
S0263	no no no no no anything you show them a piece of dirty tissue almost shall i throw this away
S0264	no recycle
S0263	no no no which all the erm cereal packets all the egg cartons it's all keep which mean that you just can't move er
S0264	when when you start that i think you be gonna say they be hyper organise and hyper and so you be sham into think you must tidy up at
S0263	no well this make me think like i'm gonna purify my home to such an extent that there's no cos my office be a bite you know pile of paper and it's really make me want to sort of
S0264	but nothing like that nothing like you what you describe in
S0263	no
S0264	that sound quite serious
S0263	it's so serious
S0264	cos people do get more untidy as they get older anyway
S0263	do they
S0264	well i think so i read about well iris murdoch and her husband
S0264	and they have bottle everywhere you know on table top
S0263	there's not a table top there's not a table top free
S0264	mm
S0263	er also to add to that there's mice scuttering around and pooing everywhere
S0264	oh
S0264	well
S0263	it's really really serious
S0264	well it's a
S0263	i felt quite sick and i'm i'm quite glad i come away alive and too
S0264	you didn't get sick
S0263	i get sick a bite actually yeah but we be okay and i i we try to clean up and help but they they say that we be bully them
S0264	oh gosh
S0263	they
S0264	how old be they
S0263	er seventy nine and eighty seven
S0264	eighty seven
S0263	so they say we we be bully them i think they'd say thank i spend hours clean up the kitchen
S0264	we use to do the same with my mum i think my brother have a go at reorganise tidy things and er her response i think be she may have accept when he do it but when i try to it be very much very similar very defensive so i'd feel that i be almost well attack her so i i you stop
S0263	mm yeah i do stop eventually cos it it's it's not a it's not something you particularly want to do be clean i don't particularly get much joy
S0264	mm
S0263	it and you do expect a bite of thank
S0264	mm
S0263	but er anyway
S0264	be they erm in good health or despite the mice
S0263	er well for their age they can hardly they can't move very well they're both on crutches
S0264	yeah you mention the crutches well all the more reason
S0263	to have
S0264	yeah
S0263	have a clear
S0263	well
S0264	well what if there's a fire or something
S0263	oh
S0264	actually the
S0263	oh my gosh
S0264	more reason why there should be a fire with all the guardians pile up one drop of lighter fuel and a match the whole lot could go up
S0263	but i i'm interest in this erm this hoard what do it mean
S0264	mm
S0263	what why why
S0264	it's call old age must be some genetic like squirrels
S0263	i realise though when i be at er a meet i use the work interest wrong in france
S0264	mm
S0263	because some somebody there be some teacher be moan about a student you know these these miage students they do two weeks at university and two weeks in a company
S0264	company yeah
S0263	anyway one of these guy well who well you never saw and nor do i he never turn up
S0264	oh
S0263	apparently at his at his job his it job they're really happy with him and want to keep him on
S0264	mm
S0263	but he doesn't come to any of the course at uni so the teachers be go oh well it's a disgrace he doesn't turn up blah blah but i say ah and i say and i
S0264	well that's the same use isn't it
S0263	it's not because one woman look at me as i start and she go because i'd use it in a way you know one of my supervisors would have use it oh that's really interest
S0264	well yeah
S0263	the the dichotomy between all the contradiction
S0263	you know or that's an interest you know contradiction or something and in french mean that you can have gain something from it
S0264	oh
S0263	it's interest either you know it's that it's you get you get some gain or it's it's worthy of some
S0264	oh
S0263	benefit
S0264	because there's that line on on the cds i'm listen to in the car
S0263	yeah
S0264	one of the actors say so the oh and i think he just mean oh that's interest but it must be the sense that you've mention there
S0263	well i suppose in a beginner french something maybe but in general it if something's like a price you can say that price be interest be french you can say it mean oh i'm get good value for money although
S0264	oh
S0263	if it's in english you can't say that price be interest
S0264	no
S0263	you go well there's nothing interest about that price
S0263	but in french it really mean
S0264	value
S0263	there's a value it's it's valuable
S0264	oh
S0263	so when she
S0264	right
S0263	when i say it and i or i immediately realise my error but i then i think i can't cos it be meet of course
S0264	oh
S0263	well i can't go on and say well the mean in england i'm sorry i've misuse the term so they be absolutely horrify
S0264	of course
S0264	so it's relate to the english sense of interest like the interest on something
S0263	yes
S0264	yes
S0263	yes
S0264	mm
S0263	but i'd use it wrongly in this
S0263	it's not what i mean to say and what i mean to say that it be it it be in the english sense
S0264	yeah curious or
S0263	curious
S0264	yeah
S0263	of how he could be so different how
S0263	you know in ones milieu he be really appreciate and the other you know
S0264	yeah
S0263	detest by
S0264	i
S0263	and
S0264	i didn't
S0263	they all look at me or after get my bad feedback and then they look at me when i say this
S0264	the outcast
S0263	how can think this guy be a great you know to them it be as if i be say he be really you know great
S0264	a paragon
S0264	i didn't realise they be suppose to be spend two weeks in either in both base level they be do both at once or something
S0263	two weeks on two weeks it's two weeks on and two weeks off
S0264	oh
S0263	yeah
S0264	cos they weren't come to uni everyday be they it be just two days a week or two like erm
S0263	no yeah every day for two weeks
S0264	oh but the rest of the time they be do other things other class
S0263	yeah mm
S0264	oh okay
S0263	so er
S0264	like it mm
S0263	i think that be very interest
S0263	how i'd make that error
S0264	mm
S0263	because i've be you know think in english
S0264	come back on yeah
S0263	than french and i i find i do that in both languages and get misunderstand
S0264	but last last time we talk i don't mean er i mean back in april i i think you'd take the decision or you felt you be become more french
S0263	er i'd take a decision
S0264	almost it be almost conscious or you well you be aware let's say you be self aware you be seem to recognise that
S0263	well maybe
S0264	you be go into that mode or role
S0263	well er yeah
S0264	not surprise it mm
S0263	especially when i get a lot of erm a lot of my write have to be rephrase i get a lot of style style errors from
S0264	but that's that would happen anywhere i think i don't know tend to think it's a necessarily
S0263	what even if i be live in england
S0264	to an extent
S0263	oh right
S0264	all of us and that could have
S0263	yeah i think some of it's more that it's informal it's er she say it's it's probably not french it's informal she say you know
S0264	cos i just go through a colleague's erm it's call a scholarly piece for her pg cert at he and they be just say you they be just personality they be just habit
S0263	mm
S0264	er i be
S0263	mm
S0264	notice i'm surprise it's not more like busier i think august must be the down month
S0263	oh i think it's quite busy compare to last august
S0264	do you
S0263	yeah could be really quiet at night time
S0264	oh
S0263	it's really quiet
S0264	yeah of course you know there's this summer at or whatever it's call you know these americans do this undergraduate
S0263	oh yeah
S0264	physics or oh
S0263	last year when i be at we these students at night be like scream and shout
S0264	what party and sort of
S0263	party and really drink i think they be the visit
S0264	probably
S0263	students
S0264	they seem very young i mean
S0263	be you work for the whole of august
S0264	yeah but
S0263	and then straight into the new term
S0264	no there's two weeks i have two weeks erm what's call erm compulsory leave you er cos you have to use it up
S0263	oh so what be you go to do
S0264	well i'm go to toulouse for
S0263	oh
S0264	three days
S0263	three days
S0264	i decide that's all i could afford well you know the it's exactly the same look at well it be gonna be strasbourg
S0263	yeah
S0264	that that they go gatwick to strasbourg as well
S0263	uhu
