S0092	it be a sort of delay reaction
S0018	oh dear
S0092	but these things be for everybody though it happen to everybody
S0018	yeah
S0092	and eh it's like a lot of things until you've have things happen you can't really empathise with anybody else
S0018	mm
S0092	you can talk in a certain way but unless you've be in a relationship that's die or you've have relatives or you've mess up this that and the other
S0018	mm
S0092	unless you've do that
S0018	mm
S0092	you don't you can't empathise
S0018	yeah
S0092	people say you just normally i don't know maybe you can but i think if you have things similar happen to you
S0018	mm
S0092	you're more likely to
S0018	yeah to be able to understand what that person's go through
S0092	so linguistic origin now eh i think it's i'll put england there shall i
S0018	yeah and so how do your mum cope with that cos
S0092	she's a well my mum's a brick she doesn't say anything she won't say anything
S0018	mm
S0092	she just keep it all in cos i'm like me mum and my brother and my sister be like me dad to look at they're like my dad but em i get i mean i've get a lot of habit i i i'll i haven't analyze it really but if you look at my brother and sister have brown eye so have my dad i've get green eye so have my mum i've get freckle so have my mum
S0018	mm hm
S0092	they're slightly tan without go in the in the eh sun so they just like darker complexion but we're definitely relate but eh so at certain facets i get off my mum i mean she's like when she be in hospital we be clear the house out we find like bean bag hundreds of them all under the cupboards we find load of stuff stuff book
S0018	she's a hoarder
S0092	paper money in envelop all over the place
S0092	em things and you know and i think and i look at some of the things and i think blimey this i know where i get all these things i'm not gonna stick money in envelop all over the place but no i mean em and so i work out if there's something she doesn't say i think well would i do in that situation maybe if i'm like her you know what i mean
S0018	mm
S0092	and i'm usually right
S0018	mm hm
S0092	but she doesn't she only tell you what she want to tell you and in a way that some people don't realise it the best way a lot of people tell me things and i don't know why and it's because i'm not ask
S0018	mm be you a good listener
S0092	and if people some people be always ask and prod and they never get anywhere because people and i'm not say anything to him he's get a big mouth and the gossip so i never i'm not curious if people want to tell me something they can and if they don't it's fine i'm not gonna cos some people seem it's like when i go on my walk some people always wanna know what's go on i'm think and they can't help it
S0018	mm
S0092	so i don't know it's not a big deal really
S0018	so where do you normally go walk
S0092	well i'm i'm the team leader i organise all the walk
S0018	oh okay
S0092	so i i organise two walk group
S0018	be it an oh it's an organisation
S0092	not a big organisation now one be from school and it just develop friends and friends and friends
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and the other one we retire when i retire every tuesday second week during the day we go on a ramble and they could invite their friends relatives neighbour whatever
S0018	super
S0092	there's more women on the one on tuesday and on sunday it's about fifty fifty
S0018	mm hm
S0092	eh sometimes it's a small number like five or six sometimes it's twelve thirteen fourteen
S0018	mm hm
S0092	eh but it's good because there's no and the reason they like it be because there's no eh obligation if you don't want to turn up for one two or whatever you can turn up out of the blue that's fine i'll just give you the walk and you turn up when you like
S0018	mm hm
S0092	there's no eh it's totally unconditional
S0018	where be your favourite place to go walk
S0092	well weather make a difference
S0018	mm
S0092	but em i like em i go to the peak cos the peak district isn't too far away
S0018	mm
S0092	cos once you hit litchfield which be only twenty five miles away then it's just about another half an hour
S0018	mm hm
S0092	from there and you're at and 's on the edge of the sort of you know the lake peak district and you've get lovely roam hill valleys you've get farm and camp sit
S0018	mm
S0092	lovely river i mean what we do when i say we depend on who i'm go with it's either friends or whatever you know it's always different people eh and i love church
S0018	mm
S0092	that's why i mean bell ring just happen just because i like i like architecture
S0018	oh do you do bell ring
S0092	i do bell ring
S0018	oh fantastic
S0092	cos em what's her name

S0092	and i do that on it's usually wednesdays and fridays i start at this be when i just retire when i be fifty five and i stick it till about just under a year
S0018	uh huh
S0092	but the thing be i use to get a bus to kings i still have a car but i didn't i think well no i can get a bus there but the problem at be when you get there you have to wait for everybody then you have to go up this massive spiral staircase to the top and then when you finish and you're knackered you have to come all the way down and there's no banister
S0018	oh no
S0092	it's just a piece of string you hold onto as you go down
S0018	oh be it it steep
S0092	yes and i go up into the bell tower and it's massive massive bell tower but i be watch these old people like i mean i know i'm get on a bite now i'm sixty next year but these people you're talk be seventy plus eighty and they're ring miles better than me it's not about how you much power you've get it's all about technique
S0018	so you're actually ring the bell in the church or be they hand bell
S0092	no they're church bell
S0018	fantastic oh can i come
S0092	ay
S0018	can i come

S0092	if you and want to come along
S0018	yes that would be great
S0092	that way you'll feel better then
S0018	yeah yeah yeah oh that would be super
S0092	cos but you're right cos usually it's beginners on a friday
S0018	mm hm
S0092	eh there's two blokes that be learn at the moment and one guy nearly pack up because what they think they think it's just pull a rope
S0018	yeah
S0092	and it just all it won't you pull a rope then it will go back the other side if you don't do it properly it's all about control it
S0018	yeah
S0092	and i'd i'd do it for a year then i stop because the people that help me one guy ray he his family have all die he be never marry he be a bachelor
S0018	mm hm
S0092	but the thing be close family and stuff sisters and stuff
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and the nearest ones be in winchester that's get a cathedral down there and he have no reason to stay except for the bell and so i go down there he move down there and he be really helpful to me and another guy he be a fireman and he have three job but he wasn't always there and the other person be eh his name be but the woman who be in my maths department she retire the year before me that be her doctor and i say to this be who come on the walk i say when i retire i want to do something really different and i wanna do it because there's nothing worse than think you'll go down the pub or you'll you watch a
S0018	mm
S0092	because you might as well be dead
S0018	yeah yeah
S0092	so i mean i stick with my chess i kinda play chess for warwickshire county player
S0018	oh really
S0092	and i like chess but i don't like the people i'm with
S0018	mm
S0092	because they're they're i mean as i say to i say that i use to think i be weird but whenever i go to the chess club i realise i'm normal you know eh so but i stop play this year because i want to spend more time do something else
S0018	mm hm
S0092	eh not too much cos if you do too much you're not really do anything you're just not so what i do what i em i start the bell ring at and then these people leave and i use to turn up and i didn't they don't give you a chance unless you're if they want to ring in a group and you're not able you can't you'll mess it all up for them
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0092	so you're watch and they'll say come along we'll just help you a bite but i be stay there for two hours and get like five minutes
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and sometimes i get there it be rain and i get soak so i just think no so i decide i've get to do what else do i want to do i want to do norwegian so the next year i sign up to do norwegian at the brasshouse on the tuesday nights
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and i do that for a year be my tutor she's lovely she's about the same age as you too and she's get a little baby
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and she's a laugh
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and i use to like go there and eh she use to bring in cake and bake cake and everything and she be like it be more like a social club
S0018	yeah okay
S0092	more than anything else
S0018	do you learn any norwegian
S0092	oh yeah
S0018	be you speak norwegian in the class be it
S0092	yeah and then i stay another year but the thing the then the third year eh we get this guy who would who'd i'd have before when who be ill and i didn't like him call em but i'm not a good judge of character initially cos i'm always i if i say something i just judge it on what i see straight away
S0018	mm
S0092	but em they all all the people in the group say you've get to go in the high group you can't stay in this so i go to the high highest group cos everybody i start with just fell by the wayside
S0018	mm
S0092	or leave or whatever and eh this higher group eh there wasn't enough there be only six and we need eight so the reason we be at the university's cos he's one of them have be do it for about for nine years he work at the university in security and
S0018	yeah
S0092	so under the great hall there's a whole office with lecture theatres and he say we can get this room for x cheap amount of money and the most of the money will go so i say alright so we go there now every tuesday
S0018	be it run by the university
S0092	no it isn't
S0018	oh
S0092	it's run by em we just pay this guy who'd eh who get it all tax free
S0018	oh brilliant
S0092	well that's not gonna
S0018	oh don't worry they won't know you're say it
S0092	but he he lecture he's a very academic guy eh be it peter or something but the thing be i didn't like him at first when he cover the lessons cos he be too pushy but now i can see a different side to him
S0018	mm
S0092	but you know what it be when you see you just see one aspect of something and
S0018	mm hm
S0092	sometimes people do take eh oh i don't like that
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0092	so em
S0018	but pushy in what way that he be push you to speak more and learn more or
S0092	well eh when he'd cover everybody be away except me and this other woman so it be nonstop ask question
S0018	mm
S0092	and stuff and i and he's he's a very academic sort of guy who he he be bring up in norway eh and he's marry to i don't know he's i think might might must be norwegian but he say he's totally english and he's lay back but he's everything his joke and everything be all very academic sort of joke and i'm think you know so eh not that there's anything wrong with that it's just that eh sometimes it take you a while to work out what's go on
S0018	yeah
S0092	there's nothing worse than when you're in the group and everybody's laugh and you're think what the you know and you can't look like you don't know what's go on so i'm think you know what's go on here so i'm i'm blank to it all so eh
S0018	do you feel you've improve a lot since you
S0092	ah my norwegian's better but it's i'm do a level in a way i it's too difficult for me
S0018	right
S0092	but the others say to me so what you're learn because you're not realise it there's certain things that be sink in even though you're not aware of it
S0018	yeah yeah
S0092	because because eh and also he realise i don't do all my homework all the time so he say you better do your homework
S0018	naughty boy
S0092	but sometimes i mean like anything i think if i get if i'm stick i'll go to ask my mum to help me because she's eighty but she do my homework anyway and she get it all wrong i can't tell my mum because it's all cos she's the old norwegian
S0018	oh okay
S0092	do the old norwegian
S0018	right
S0092	so eh
S0018	mm hm
S0092	you know and she's eighty nine and i'm think you know i mean she i mean she can read stuff but she's slow anyway but i forget that cos i just say you know if it's your own mother you just don't take that into if it be somebody else eighty nine you'd think blimey
S0018	yeah
S0092	but you don't do that on your own time you just expect i mean she still think i'm a fifteen to twenty five year old kid you know she just i go i go over there today and she go here's an easter egg for you
S0018	aw
S0092	here's your card
S0018	that's a mum's prerogative though
S0092	you know and i'm think if i'm sixty next year and she's treat me like i'm a so but that's that's that be that isn't it so
S0018	but go back to you be in a higher class than maybe your level be that's actually quite good if you're if you're if you feel confident in that class
S0092	well i'm
S0018	as as oppose to just learn the language you're actually acquire it
S0092	when i'm in a group situation if i'm not confident with the topic i'll i'll i'll compensate by be more myself like i be now
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and i'll interrupt and say i'm a strategist i mean cos you're a teacher you can tell the strategy like you make out can you say that again or something even though you haven't get a clue what they're on about cos i'll think you're you know or you haven't do any question except two so you make sure they know you've do these two or pretend you've do some other one
S0018	you know all the trick don't you be a teacher
S0092	well i don't know i mean when you look at other kid cos when you're teach a class and they're stick you've get to work out why they're stick
S0018	yeah
S0092	and if you don't want to bollock them you've get to work out how to get the best out of them without make them feel that they're be sort of marginalise cos if you marginalise kid or people
S0018	yeah
S0092	it's obvious if you've get any common sense what their reaction's gonna be they're just gonna get more marginalise and they're not gonna get involve
S0018	yeah they'll be demotivated
S0092	so eh i would work out strategies that eh blur the actual reality
S0018	uh huh
S0092	so that they feel part of it cos you're never teach that at when i go to em cos i teach for a year before i go to my postgraduate education
S0018	mm hm
S0092	when i leave sheffield and get me i get my degree in chemical engineer and field technology and not maths but it be all physics maths chemistry and other things
S0018	mm hm
S0092	em then i leave cos i cos my dad have just die i do cos i get my degree when i i'm a july baby so i actually do my degree when i be twenty
S0018	mm
S0092	i didn't i graduate when i be twenty and i didn't sort of and i didn't want to do a job straight away so i get a job in a factory in seliy oak i be work on a lathe cut metal i work in the post office i work in the railways flog tellys
S0018	butlins
S0092	butlins and then i write to four different job i write to laboratory i write to a education authority i write eh to the police and i write i don't know if it be the army or something else i write to place where and i get a job teach
S0018	mm hm
S0092	at i hadn't get a teach degree and it be i get eat alive there
S0018	oh
S0092	but that be the best way to learn
S0018	mm
S0092	because then i go to university and get my pgce and all these other people i be with have just finish their degrees in or nice universities
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and have just start when you're go to do teacher train and stuff
S0018	mm hm
S0092	i me i have come from a i have just be eat alive in an inner city birmingham school and i be listen to these lecturers talk about discipline and behaviour and i be listen and i think these people haven't get a clue
S0018	clue yeah
S0092	about anything and these be tell me what to do
S0018	yeah you'd have the baptism of fire hadn't you
S0092	so what happen be i end up at eh i the school i end up it's there be a really rough area
S0018	oh 's yeah they're they're
S0092	mega rough and i get a job at
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and the kid be all disturb there and strangely enough they have maths there you're do alright here i say yeah i know and then my tutor come in and they didn't like him and then i say and then i haven't get a car so what do they do it's a terrible winter where do they send me on my main secondary practice they send me to derby i'm in nottingham in a bedsit they send me to derby when other people have get cars can teach in nottingham so i have to get a bus in the morning to derby then a bus out in to to mickleover
S0018	how long do that take
S0092	bloody age
S0018	yeah
S0092	and then the head of the school at mickleover where i be he run a chess team and he find out i could play chess and i win all my game for him and suddenly he if i have any discipline problems he use to sort it all out for me
S0018	brilliant
S0092	and eh it be amaze really that eh you know my tutor come and watch me in one lesson and this kid call me a bastard and he he look at me after he say that's terrible isn't it i think my god this guy be nut
S0018	it's quite polite from what i hear in the classroom
S0092	but i know but the thing be what i what i realise when i leave there be that the people run it aren't haven't get their finger on the pulse and even now
S0018	mm hm
S0092	if you're in the certain management situation you just want to maintain your job you don't want to ruin your job your immediate high people so you just pretend it's all let's pretend
S0018	mm
S0092	and the ones at the bottom be be eat alive
S0018	yeah
S0092	so what it's their problem they're the ones that haven't get a proper strategy
S0018	well i i just felt that eh the tutor in university know that it be a completely unrealistic situation
S0092	oh yeah
S0018	but they be pretend that it wasn't just because
S0092	okay oh
S0018	otherwise everything just break down i mean all the the class that i be teach i have a for example just for one class i have four visually impair children four hear impair children about ten children with anger management issue who as soon as they felt angry they have a leave of absence to go and talk to someone about how to deal with their anger on the moment and then in during that time you have to have lessons aim for three different level of the within each lesson so you're try to teach three different class at the same time
S0092	mm
S0018	while you've get all you've get to cater to the visually impair students you've get to cater to the hear impair students and then all the anger management the eh these students that don't deal with their anger very well you've get all this to manage and then on top of that i don't know what it be like for maths but for teach languages you have to prepare so much material and it's the fashion nowadays not to rely on course book all the teachers that i saw in about three or four different school that i visit they
S0092	yeah
S0018	generate their own materials i mean you know probably from your norwegian class that in an hour you can get through about four or five bits of material
S0092	mm
S0018	that will stimulate conversation
S0092	yeah
S0018	or stimulate you know read skill or level
S0092	cos what he do cos it's we use the textbooks and she use to digress if we talk about make cake or something
S0018	mm
S0092	or a walk or something cos she use to she be one of these she be very funny she be wacky she have a hobby it be call i don't know be it plank or plain she use to get on place and
S0018	oh plank yeah
S0092	yeah she use to bring picture on her phone and anywhere on a mountain and
S0018	a few people have die do that haven't they try to plank on bridge or cliffs
S0092	and then this other one which something iron where you have to put an iron board
S0018	on a motorway
S0092	or on the top of a hill or on a bloody rock in the middle of nowhere i mean for god's sake but she be funny she be wacky but she be funny
S0092	very crazy yeah
S0018	yeah but i mean you know at least you know where you're come from i well i i i felt sort of felt more and i don't know why i should feel more relax with people like that but i do sometimes if people be too serious and stuffy and stuff i don't feel relax with them
S0018	mm
S0092	i don't know why but em no i mean you've get to have a bite of eh you've get to have an edge somehow
S0018	mm
S0092	just to give some momentum in a situation
S0018	yeah yeah
S0092	otherwise and i mean that's the trouble and a lot of the people i work with eh i use to do crazy things all the time well crazy relative to what they'd say be crazy and i mean
S0018	what in the classroom
S0092	i get oh my god i've get picture of me em when i be at you know the girls school
S0018	uh huh
S0092	i be there for two years i get oh we have a blind date competition and i dress up as this woman i have three balloon in here i have a pair of wellys i have an apron and i have my hair all do properly i have a mop eh and i be one of the eh the girls go absolutely bananas when i come into the room but the the scheme of things i they always give me the bottom form and my form and you know i have the bottom form they'd run after me with compass try to break my balloon and i think bloody be careful you know what girls be like together they're worse than boys they be scary i tell you
S0018	very scary
S0092	i know the only time i've ever be hit be try to stop girls fight
S0018	really
S0092	stop boys fight they'll stop
S0018	mm hm
S0092	you get in the way of two girls they won't stop try to hit each other
S0018	passion involve in a girl fight
S0092	oh i oh girls together wow
S0018	so how do you cos one of the biggest problems i find in the classroom be i mean obviously your norwegian class everyone who go there be motivate
S0092	yeah
S0018	they've get their internal motivation reason that they want to learn
S0092	yeah
S0018	so they come and they're happy to be there and they're happy to
S0092	well
S0018	participate but obviously as you know in classrooms in secondary school
S0092	well
S0018	and also kid don't kid don't want to learn a foreign language they don't see the benefit of it
S0092	i know that's i mean i know with maths but if i be do as i say to you the other day you've get to have a combination i know it's difficult for women i mean i'm a big bloke and when you dress really smartly
S0018	mm
S0092	and you look after you make your hair all and you're clean shave and you your voice project a manner of eh i'm not gonna be mess about but you're not nasty with it
S0018	yeah yeah
S0092	so i have a mixture of fear they have a mixture of fear and cos some teachers though they do not play up it's if it's more fear than anything else
S0018	mm
S0092	give an opportunity they'll like if they're away to cover but like with my form i have the same form five years and then i be another form i keep they use to em if i be away nobody play up they all do they everybody shut up because they be use to it
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and all the kid associate with the room that day my room as a place where nobody play up
S0018	mm that's good
S0092	and it's strange how you do associate a certain build or something or they won't play up as much they might play up a bite if i'm not there
S0018	mm
S0092	but em and also i never use to send the kid to the management i never use to send them to head of year
S0018	mm
S0092	ever i use to sort all my own problems out
S0018	that's good
S0092	and i never make threats i say i use to say to them if you do that now i'm gonna do something i won't tell you what i'll do but i'll do something cos if you let them know what you're gonna do
S0018	mm
S0092	you have have it
S0018	yeah
S0092	cos they'll push it so i never and i say that i use to do at the first start i use to make like my first lesson after i've throw the book at them and tell them just and tell them a load of rubbish and so they work well basically they didn't know if they be come or go with me because they didn't know how what i be like and cos all their mat use to say be a laugh he's funny
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and then they be think no he isn't cos i the new kid
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and then i use to say well i'm gonna have the first week i'm not gonna do any maths we're just gonna learn what you've get to do to be behave for me i say and i use to say i've get no control about what go on with the rest of the school so if you doss around and mess about in somebody else's class that's not my problem but i i look at this nice top set of first years that come in and then i say i just star i say everybody in here know how to behave but you also know how to play up now don't you and i point to this nice well you know girl sit there and yes sir then i also who else know how to play up put your hand up they all put their hand up i say see but you're not go to do that with me be you no sir and you do that for the first week they'll not forget that that's there for the whole five years
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and then and then i say rule like you don't come late and then i use to say i don't want you to go on why not can somebody tell me i want five reason so i use to reinforce them from them
S0018	mm hm
S0092	i never use to eh go on and just say and what about your book and i say here's a book and i say one and here's another one which one do you think if you be a teacher you'd tell a person off i'm get them reinforce what i want
S0018	yeah
S0092	by get them why somebody's put some graffiti on it what's what's that mean and then they be tell me why isn't that a good idea and then i set them a ruler what's that it's a ruler now somebody tell me that i should use that to hit people over the head with but and i and they think they think be he a nasty so and so or what and just try and smoulder about it think let me think about it
S0018	okay
S0092	but i only think of a nail a draw pin at one end yeah they're really scar then and then i'd go on to say well who can tell me what a ruler be for draw line sir but what do he mean by that i what a margin and then i'd get them so i'd spend age
S0018	mm
S0092	i don't just do it quickly so it all sink in because the teachers worry about the bright children in class
S0018	mm hm
S0092	they're go to follow it anyway it's the ones that be go to give you trouble later on
S0018	mm
S0092	if you let that sink in big time at the start
S0018	mm hm
S0092	later on they might be they do it with other and when they do start get away with things with other people unless you've make a big deal about it you're go to be on the receive end cos it's like a virus
S0018	yeah yeah definitely
S0092	but
S0018	i think that's what have happen in my in the school that i be in that basically senior management
S0092	what school be it
S0018	em the one i tell you about last last week in bournville
S0092	oh bournville
S0018	and i think senior management hadn't get just at the top down discipline and so the the teachers basically didn't have the support behind them to be able to to use discipline themselves
S0092	be nick osbourne still there in pe
S0018	oh i don't know
S0092	we use to go there and play basketball i remember we go to bournville i'll tell you why i remember bournville cos we use to go to the pub afterwards
S0018	oh yeah
S0092	and we go to the country girl and i have my car nick from the car park there
S0018	oh doesn't surprise me that area be be a bite dodgy
S0092	and do you know me mat ask when he give a little i say eh i say eh i can't find my car and eh he say and i be look under i be look you know what you do you look over the fence you look in the most as if the car's gonna jump out over the fence you know so eh and this bloke he just bugger off he say oh well i better catch the bus then i be go to take him home he didn't no i'll stay with you and stuff
S0018	didn't help you or anything
S0092	no no no
S0018	nice bloke
S0092	i go to king's heath police station to report him and you know what the policeman say to his mate thank god that's not on our patch
S0018	oh god
S0092	in bournville so really when you're look for sympathy the worst thing be the shock be when you don't get it when you and so sometimes when you want to lean on somebody you can't and so you've gotta
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and that in a way you get inure in and harden to it make you stronger but at the time you feel really vulnerable i i find it or the police phone me up five days later i be in spark hill in the inner city
S0018	mm hm
S0092	eh i have to start it with a screwdriver somebody have all my mark my tap my book everything cds they nick
S0018	oh no
S0092	yeah they they'd screw the doors with a screwdriver the coursework nick i be gonna mark
S0018	oh no
S0092	yeah i get in trouble over that
S0018	you get in trouble
S0092	yeah initially i do till i tell them eh and also the fact that i couldn't go anywhere without you know and i just felt bloody hell it's just go where have it all go to
S0018	oh no
S0092	you know
S0018	why would they steal coursework
S0092	they didn't know what be in it
S0018	oh
S0092	they just take everything and then just like what they do when they burgle a house if something look and then they'll dump it later on won't they
S0018	mm
S0092	so that be that
S0018	and what do the kid have to do do the coursework again
S0092	no but in a way i think that's good but some of them be crap they'll probably get an average mark now you know what i mean but these be things that happen to you and you just don't want them to happen again it's like a lot of things you know
S0018	mm
S0092	what people don't realise when they're younger anything you see somebody who's a lot older than them the things that happen to them the chance be fifty or sixty percent of the things happen to them you're gonna have
S0018	mm hm
S0092	or maybe more because part of live be not just have fantastic things happen to you
S0018	yeah it's get through the
S0092	but things like
S0018	awful things
S0092	either meet have a nasty experience with people or in that or a health scare
S0018	yeah
S0092	or a job it may be lose a job or get demote
S0018	mm
S0092	or not keep whatever or if you've get family split up or your kid be in trouble
S0018	mm
S0092	i'm not say it's but it's a combination of them or
S0018	yeah
S0092	even families that be sort of stable you know like cos i mean it's a tough time for middle class now really
S0018	yeah yeah
S0092	because they they say they work hard and they've get all this and then all of a sudden they realise things have get to they've get to sacrifice things
S0018	yeah
S0092	you know i mean my sister i mean my nephew be at it's ten grand a term but i say may my wife's husband's on two hundred grand a year
S0018	wow what do he do
S0092	he's a big chief exec for an induction company
S0018	really
S0092	but it's it own eh race horse and he's like mega mega mega buck he's boss he's just a minion he be he's just lucky he's impress and i mean he only get the job because he be go to be make redundant he's on thirty grand a year at birmingham city council
S0018	mm
S0092	and he get so he have to find somewhere and then this he get rapid promotion
S0018	mm hm
S0092	so it's just luck really
S0018	it be i'm wait for a bite of luck i've have nothing but bad luck for the past ten years or so
S0092	but i mean you know i mean you might think you've have bad luck but you might meet other people who've have a lot worse
S0018	yeah i know it's true that's when
S0092	it's all
S0018	i go i get mug when i be thirty and they break my jaw i break all my bone down my arm
S0092	be this in birmingham
S0018	no that be in barcelona when i live there
S0092	cos barcelona i mean my my friends go there and em they get rob
S0018	oh it's yeah i be teach i be train teachers to be english teachers and we'd have like thirty students every month and at least two of them would get mug on a it be a monthly thing
S0092	but then you didn't know that you'd be rob till you get back to your
S0018	no no no
S0092	they be really sophisticate
S0018	yeah yeah yeah they they've get so many methods of do it unfortunately well i be mug about six time eh what rob but the last time be a violent mug cos they be on a motorcycle and they come up onto the pavement behind me and grab my bag off my arm but it have short strap so i end up get drag behind the motorbike that be go about fifty kilometres an hour
S0092	so they didn't intend to break your arm
S0018	no they didn't do it like
S0092	i think they be just gonna break your arm
S0018	no they didn't do it like
S0092	oh
S0018	here take this bang bang bang
S0092	no i mean
S0018	but still
S0092	i know if it's the case it's the big place for robbery in the whole of europe
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0092	and rome be not too good either they say
S0018	mm hm
S0092	but i mean you know when things like that happen it do make you well it take a while to sort of feel confident to go out again
S0018	definitely but i i would have get over that fine but the problem be that the consequences of me be ill i get sack from my job for while i be off sick and i have to take them to court
S0092	mm
S0018	cos it be illegal what they'd do and then i hadn't have the doctor hadn't diagnose me properly i be complain about my neck cos every week or so i'd get a bolt of lightning in my neck
S0092	and what do they do
S0018	they just send me to a lot of different specialists that tell me
S0092	be it sort now
S0018	kind of i still have problems it be a herniated disc in my neck
S0092	yeah
S0018	and so i have to take so much time off on my next job
S0092	mm
S0018	because sometimes i couldn't even hold my head up eh or breathe properly that i lose that job as well and then the next job that i get teach at murcia university cos
S0092	which university
S0018	in murcia in spain
S0092	yeah
S0018	and cos they do dodgy work contract over there because they don't want to make you permanent because they have to
S0092	yeah
S0018	pay more social security for you
S0092	right
S0018	and so murcia university be illegally employ us and one of teachers complain to the department of employment who come and do a big inspection and and say we're fin you half a million euros and you're no longer allow to employ people on these contract so they just terminate everybody's contract and only take on teachers who have the civil service em
S0092	so anyway you get punish for
S0018	yeah it be just be bang bang bang and that's
S0092	yeah
S0018	in the end the reason why i move back to england and think i'll carry on be a teacher i'll do a pgce
S0092	yeah
S0018	and then it be the difference it be just such a shock to get into
S0092	behaviour
S0018	the behaviour be a nightmare i mean i've teach all age and level of kid in spain and yeah there's you know they be they're kid aren't they
S0092	mm
S0018	they're gonna play out they're gonna misbehave but there be no hostility there be no violence
S0092	how many school have you teach in here then be it all secondary school
S0018	yeah
S0092	if you get have you ever think of private school
S0018	yeah
S0092	i mean you could still get them play up but they play up in a totally different way
S0018	mm hm
S0092	eh i don't know i mean it's the good thing be i think language you're at an advantage now because some of the news headline the other day about they haven't get enough interpreters
S0018	mm hm
S0092	for criminals there's a massive problem now with recruitment get people to do languages so i think if if someone change
S0018	mm hm
S0092	in your i mean what language would you be able to teach just spanish or
S0018	french and spanish yeah and because of the ebac that be in at the moment be be bring in
S0092	yeah
S0018	you know a language for a lot of people be gonna be essential
S0092	oh you
S0018	to get their ebac so i think there's go to be quite a lot of teach job
S0092	it's just that i
S0018	but i just don't know whether i'll be able to cope i mean you say that all teachers and be so stress and don't get to enjoy their holiday cos they're always work
S0092	well the thing be i mean it might sound bad in one way but because i wasn't marry or have kid myself
S0018	mm hm
S0092	in a way it be a benefit in one way because some of them use to go home and i'm not say their marriages be on the rock but to have their strong marriage you're get to put a lot in to it
S0018	yeah yeah
S0092	and so that mean you've get to be eh either understand or say you have eh not in the right frame of mind one way and you've get to do a b c d and you if i come home i don't want to do anything i just use to do what i like
S0018	mm hm
S0092	which be basically either soak in the bath or go to bed eh or just chill out
S0018	mm
S0092	and i mean i i i i didn't know i have diabetes for a while so i'd end up go on that i use to get my blood pressure check regularly and then it wasn't that long cos if it be too long it would cause all the damage but eh so i must have be at school work and i be wonder why i be tire and stuff
S0018	really
S0092	but there must be other teachers go in and have other things go on with them but partly i think some of the stress must affect create a situation where it make you ill
S0018	yeah i'm sure of it
S0092	so you know and it be a stressful job i mean i eh i start teach in nineteen seventy five
S0018	mm hm
S0092	i stop i retire in two thousand and eight i mean it's not long in compare to some but it be long enough when think about the intensity of the job you're on your feet all day i use to get in i use to leave the house at about quarter past seven
S0018	mm hm
S0092	so i could get on the photocopier and then chill before we start
S0018	mm
S0092	so be it be only the last fifteen years at hall green it isn't that far but there's nothing worse if you've get a long train journey or traffic
S0018	it be take me two hours to get to the other side of birmingham
S0092	what side do you live then
S0018	em solihull
S0092	you live in solihull and you have to get to bournville
S0018	yeah public transport
S0092	what time what route do you go
S0018	i'd catch the thirty seven down to acocks green
S0092	yeah
S0018	and then get the eleven around to the bristol road
S0092	yeah
S0018	and then get the eh sixty two
S0092	yeah
S0018	down the bristol road which would have be fine if there hadn't be in traffic eh
S0092	be there teacher that work live near
S0018	no there weren't any that live by me
S0092	oh
S0018	it be such a shame but yeah i be spend four hours a day travel and then get home at night and then you've get to plan your lessons for the next time and
S0092	so how long be you at bournville for
S0018	eh four months it be my first
S0092	i bet you weren't upset when you didn't stay any longer
S0018	well it be my first placement it be only for
S0092	where have you be do since then
S0018	well that's the thing i defer i defer it in january because
S0092	be that with the university
S0018	yeah
S0092	which birmingham or
S0018	yeah birmingham
S0092	okay
S0018	cos i put i've do the five five months the four months before christmas
S0092	mm
S0018	literally every day all my wake hours be work and then at the weekend i'd be write the research project
S0092	mm hm
S0018	for the university so i have no free time to relax
S0092	mm
S0018	and i sustain that for four months and then i have the christmas break and then i go back in january and i just couldn't concentrate and my brain just break and i think there's no way that i could continue
S0092	mm
S0018	i'm gonna defer i don't know whether i want to to be a teacher in in this environment and i'm gonna take the year
S0092	but what what options have you get now
S0018	well i'm look into em publish cos the english as a foreign language
S0092	yeah
S0018	there's such a big big market worldwide there's quite eh a few big publish company that em publish materials for
S0092	yeah
S0018	different market within the english as a foreign language market so i've apply for a few job em in oxford work to promote
S0092	yeah
S0018	primary resources and that would seem natural for me to go into
S0092	oh yeah
S0018	for me to take advantage of the experience that i've get cos i've get fourteen years experience
S0092	yeah
S0018	in teach english and
S0092	yeah you've get to do something like that
S0018	mm hm
S0092	it's just unfortunate the job situation
S0018	exactly it's just not the right time to well be make a career move
S0092	but it's the same for everybody and i mean
S0018	mm
S0092	you know you need but i mean i never think about what other people's problems be i just think well i'm out of it now
S0018	mm
S0092	i mean
S0018	thank your lucky star
S0092	well i'm lucky in one way it's no good i give it i somebody tell me a joke the other day that make me really think about a lot of things they say this be who come on the walk she's a very interest woman she say there be these two two blokes in an old people's home they're about ninety five years old each sit there star at the wallpaper just like that and one say to the other aren't you glad we stop smoke basically they probably live eh not do anything
S0018	mm hm
S0092	so they'd live a long life but they're just live like morons
S0018	yeah
S0092	and yet some people don't live so long because they're take risk
S0018	yeah
S0092	and do this that and the other and i'm think yeah i know it's it's terrible in a way but it's far better than i i think you don't think though that if you're ill or something but to do lot
S0018	mm hm
S0092	i'm not say it's cram so it's unbearable cos some people do have a life where they're do a lot more
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and i'm not say that they're go to die young but other people don't do anything
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and that's not a life be it
S0018	yeah exactly it's just an existence
S0092	so so you know i mean some of your experience and i know they be unpleasant they might hold you in good stead later on
S0018	yeah
S0092	because at least you're aware of what's there
S0018	yeah
S0092	then you're aware you know some people be totally naive and didn't like
S0018	mm hm
S0092	you know and go through life and they think that everything be all just go to be alright it isn't but education people in charge as you say they know they're play let's pretend
S0018	yeah totally would you go back into teach well if you have to do a career start a career now would you go into teach
S0092	no
S0018	really
S0092	well it's sad one thing i the scary thing at hall green one thing be it be too many women i mean i don't hate women but there's ninety percent women
S0018	mm
S0092	and some of these age lads cos i say the culture and although women can do the job just as well as men in a lot ways that when you get a certain number of women together other things kick off i don't know what it be but i mean they go to extremes men will say no i mean
S0018	mm
S0092	but if you get women together they'll go to extremes to do something
S0018	mm hm
S0092	men will think oh no i don't i don't that's a good idea we should stop there and if you've work for a boss that's totally determine they're scary some of them that eh and the way they bully each other as well when women bully women it's a lot worse than men bully men i mean i saw it when i with girls just over the interview and some woman be rant down some other woman's earhole and the woman get bully be this head of department and i'm think jesus christ what kind of people be they
S0018	mm
S0092	you know so em i work there for a while i mean it's an eye opener
S0018	mm hm
S0092	but em mind you i've work in all bloke environments that's not nice either but for a different reason
S0018	a bite smellier
S0092	well i it's i don't know i mean my i'll tell you something really weird at this be really weird most school i've be at you get in the gents there's about three cubicles and then a load of urinals about five or six and i think you know you get to which be a girls school right you go in the blokes urinals there you saw about five thousand urinals it's get the biggest gents toilet i've ever be in and i'm think this be a girls school they don't have as many men anyway it's get the biggest amount of toilets you could have a bloody three classrooms in there i just couldn't get my head around it i think what you know how things strike you and you just want to know why and i couldn't i still can't for the life of me understand why you know and people say and i say well
S0018	it sound quite typical of the logic that be in operation in a lot of school
S0092	oh tell me about it but em there be the reason i like teach for me personally it's nothing no matter what system's in operation i still do me own thing
S0018	mm
S0092	and eh and if they don't like it they'll try and sort of some of the bully type will make some threats but with me it won't work because i'll just play the game and then if they start get nasty i'll just i won't it's like what people do they just pretend nothing be there and i mean i've be threaten by her management
S0018	mm
S0092	the tough guy in management
S0018	why what be it that they didn't like that you be do
S0092	well i be union rep in two school
S0018	oh really
S0092	you know but the thing be once they'd guarantee me be just dig my heel in
S0018	mm
S0092	be somebody come around it's like you know actually i mean i'm not a tough hard guy but if people start do that i'll i'll i won't act hard to them but i won't back off
S0018	mm
S0092	so i know what i be say but eh because you can see that now with em well with this government really things be gonna get nasty soon
S0018	yeah definitely
S0092	and cos i'm i mean i'm i'm really leave wing i be very people i bell ring with don't there they're all fascists they're all i mean they're all sort of bankers
S0018	really
S0092	they're alright
S0018	mm hm
S0092	but they're in a nice rich area
S0018	yeah
S0092	and i never talk politics with them and i daren't bring my copy of socialist worker in i mean i've get it in the house you know but i mean you know i just want to get on with them i don't start mouth about things i'm think just don't say anything so i keep me mouth shut
S0018	that's a good plan
S0092	and i go there the the rotor club they're all there you know
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and they're talk about scroungers and all that or whatever but the thing be when you think about it it make sense because it's all this country there's a lot of a little different many worlds
S0018	mm hm
S0092	everywhere
S0018	exactly
S0092	i mean i go to there's you don't see any ethnic minorities there
S0018	mm hm
S0092	you see big house and they're nice people i mix with because that's the environment they live in
S0018	mm hm
S0092	but people might say well this that they might be but you know i still want to ring bell in church and if i if i start upset people i won't be able to do that
S0018	yeah definitely
S0092	so i've get to play a game as well i play let's pretend just like everybody else but certain things like the health bill i might go on a march on that if i have to cos i go on the abortion bill in london that's where i be march at hyde park then i hope the police didn't have me on film anywhere
S0092	but em my brother be a rave all my family be tories
S0018	really
S0092	yeah me brother ex policeman what do you expect
S0018	mm hm
S0092	eh my dad be a tory they're the worst a work class tory
S0018	mm
S0092	because the they're you know it's like vote for the person who be go to be beat you up
S0018	mm hm
S0092	but you can't tell him all my dad's side of the family they're all tory all of them and yet who be go to suffer with all these cut it's go to be the work class
S0018	yeah and they're all it all it be all they be already i mean the amount of
S0092	they be already and i mean you talk about unemployment here look at spain fifty percent youth unemployment
S0018	yeah
S0092	fifty percent
S0018	and it's quite interest actually to see cos see normally in spain people don't really challenge the establishment that much but the young generation nowadays they're really organise themselves
S0092	you know why don't you
S0018	yeah
S0092	cos franco do so much
S0018	yeah
S0092	psychological damage to everybody
S0018	yeah
S0092	i mean even when he take power he's still kill people years and years and years afterwards with his cohorts anybody that be on the side if they find out they just arrange something
S0018	mm hm
S0092	i've hear stories of people hide in build for ten fifteen years
S0018	yeah yeah
S0092	you know and i mean something kick up the other way we have some french lawyer who get in trouble over something and i mean what they do there be awful i mean the only reason franco he be go to be beat but apparently hitler eh
S0018	mm
S0092	go to north africa where all the spanish colonies be and bring all the spanish soldier that be in the colonies back to the mainland spain and when to reinforce franco's army
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and it be that that swing it otherwise and it be just the army he have at the time
S0018	mm
S0092	they'd have be overwhelm but they get the actual force back from north africa
S0018	yeah yeah
S0092	and that swing it and then then and then you have all this eh all this genocide really
S0018	completely and the people still don't like talk about it
S0092	well they don't cos some of them be
S0018	it's like thirty thirty years later and it's still they just don't talk about it
S0092	because they be yeah cos some of these people be murderers they be complicit in it
S0018	mm hm
S0092	well it's like a lot of things just like all this abuse in the catholic church and stuff
S0018	uh huh
S0092	people be still get you know
S0018	yeah have you hear about the judge garzon em
S0092	the one in spain who's
S0018	yeah he be try to
S0092	that's the one i be on about
S0018	oh right yeah cos he's try to bring to justice a lot of the the war crimes they not even war crimes they be just crimes against humanity he be the one that try to bring pinochet to justice
S0092	i know i've read about that
S0018	and maggie thatcher help help him escape
S0092	well i mean you know when you think about a lot of a lot of the problems now thatcher eh you know this like the big bank crisis
S0018	mm hm
S0092	bank weren't allow to do what they do and then thatcher and regan
S0018	they deregulate everything
S0092	and then eh clinton didn't help sign some bill a as well but everything kick off like we've get problems with house now who decide to sell council house thatcher
S0018	mm hm
S0092	because everybody should have a right to buy but the thing be council house be build for people who couldn't afford
S0018	yeah
S0092	house
S0018	yeah
S0092	and eh it's obvious the when you look at the the different amount of money people earn some people like and in germany most people don't own their property
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and look at their economy they haven't get a problem with it
S0018	mm
S0092	i mean i didn't buy that house next door till when i be twenty and it's only cos i think i be go to settle down so i end up buy a house a good job i do think i be go to settle down otherwise i probably would never have buy a house but it didn't work out so i end up but the thing be i'm glad i buy it i buy that house next door in nineteen eighty one
S0018	mm hm
S0092	guess how much i pay for it
S0018	eh in nineteen eighty one gosh thirty thousand forty thousand more or less
S0092	fourteen
S0018	fourteen thousand blimey and be that like a year's salary two year's salary back then
S0092	eh i've get me payslips from when i em when i start teach i can't remember how much i earn though i didn't earn a lot but it be a hell of a lot of money then
S0018	mm
S0092	a hell of a lot of money and eh i think no i think it be too much cos it have go up a lot in a short period of time anyway
S0018	mm
S0092	but i didn't buy it to make money cos i've live i i mean people say oh how much be this but i didn't buy it to make money
S0018	mm
S0092	cos i haven't sell it i don't need i don't want to sell it and if i i have any intention to sell it i have to do so much work on it i mean because i've live there and i just let i haven't need to i've have things do but i'm not a diy expert i get people in like i have the roof do when the next door on the other side have theirs do i have double glaze do when my brother's mate he say double glaze i'll do it i have the floorboards do when i have a problem with them i have to get all that sort i have a new wall outside when some bloke come round have a chimney when these things happen but the thing be there's only so much you can do
S0018	mm
S0092	and then you think why keep it up to date immaculately it's like you know every day go to the bar or have your hair cut you know why what for you're not go on a date every day you know what i mean so and also but it's not sensible because at the end of the day you want to feel comfortable in your house
S0018	yeah exactly it need to be your home your castle
S0092	you know it's just when someone else see what but so you know depend what people be i don't see things other people do
S0018	mm
S0092	which be good really but em no and then each to their own everybody's get their own way of do or cop with things
S0018	yeah i know i think your cos i don't think that nowadays a teacher on a teacher's salary you can buy a house can you
S0092	i don't know i mean i be never promote i well i be but i didn't i didn't i mean i didn't creep around people for promotion i just be happy with what i get and i just budget within that
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and i mean i didn't learn to drive till i be thirty

S0092	so but i don't like i mean drive into town you get to park and you get to worry about be late and you've get all the traffic
S0018	mm hm
S0092	and i don't like that i don't like hassle like that i hate hustle no matter what it be
S0018	mm
S0092	i just like a nice easy i say to i say what do i want out of life i want peace and quiet
S0018	i agree with you
S0092	peace and quiet that's all i want i don't and people don't understand this they say don't you want anything else well other things come anyway
S0018	yeah
S0092	if you're not look for things they'll come along anyway
S0018	mm hm
S0092	because they do
S0018	strange that you choose to be a teacher then if your life goal be to

S0018	mm
S0092	i but i don't know i think it depend with what kid you deal with
S0018	yeah true
S0092	but the thing be i've em kid be more violent now not less violent
S0018	mm
S0092	when there's no discipline
S0018	mm hm
S0092	there's more and i'm not just say weapon i'm say beat up gang and everything
S0018	yeah yeah
S0092	and kid respect know where they stand i never use to go around em you only have to do it once and what i use to do be you do one thing once and if you're in school for ten fifteen twenty years that incident will be pass on through mat and stuff and whatever
S0018	mm
S0092	and eh they'll and they'll sort of ornate it and make it bigger and you know chinese whisper thing
S0018	yeah yeah
S0092	the kid will do that with a story where you push somebody you know as if throw them out a window or whatever so you don't have to do anything and eh if it's and also it's not what you do it's the way you do it
S0018	mm
S0092	it's like when you talk to somebody some kid will react to i mean i've get i've swear at kid i've call my kid a a wanker in front of the whole class and he's never grass me up other teachers say something like you're a slime a git or something like that they'll go and complain
S0018	mm
S0092	because it's the way the way you say it and who you be
S0018	yeah
S0092	and you can't i mean you know but then also at the end of the day if i do things wrong then i'll say i'll face the music if you're prepare to face the music
S0018	mm hm
S0092	but if you're a valuable asset to the school and you don't have trouble or anything and you don't they're go to think twice before they try and get rid of you
S0018	yeah yeah they're gonna want to keep you
S0092	you know
S0018	especially nowadays with the
S0092	the only time when i be away be the last year i be away a bite because i be hardly ever away
S0018	mm hm
S0092	i be never away and i do my first year of over and when i cover that in that class class riot like sometimes you get a supply in
S0018	yeah
S0092	you know i remember once i be at god i must have have a good reputation then but i some of these class there be shit scar of me and they use to come in and behave and one day i have a i have a cover for music and this woman be really play up alot she be neurotic and she be do you know what i mean and i think oh i go i go to her room before the bell ring and i hide behind the door and they all come in this be the class i have dead quiet and they be scream and yell and the and then the door's close and i be stand there and i have a smile and all of a sudden suddenly they all go quiet and they all sit down and i say hello
S0018	mm
S0092	and i do it all like it be a little play and it be lovely and it be i be like an actor in a play and i use to love all of this think you couldn't do this better if you try and i say eh be this a drama lesson i say i be just take the piss out of them all the time and in a way i've always use that because if you do it like that it's even more effective
S0018	mm hm
S0092	because they do that with each other
S0018	mm hm
S0092	so you're just do what they do so they know exactly what they sort of and also their put down and you know and they don't want you to think they're naughty and so they suddenly you know especially if it's a nice quiet little girl who's always well behave and she think you've sussed out she's not they don't like that so eh
S0018	it's like
S0092	so you've get to be careful you don't
S0018	but it surprise me the amount of kid that just don't care that they'll just push the boundaries and push the boundaries and they've just get no i think maybe cos at home they don't have any boundaries or anything
S0092	well the thing be like in a way they're the kid that be lose and not the teachers because it
S0018	mm
S0092	in their whole life if that's gonna be what their life's like that mean they're never go to have a situation they're go to have a situation in respect or intimacy
S0018	yeah
S0092	or be able to relate to people in a sensible
