S0509	yeah so er i do some photography model for my friend and he be do darkroom photography so
S0510	right
S0509	he be take it on film so he's no idea how any of them have turn out
S0510	oh okay
S0509	be it yeah
S0510	so be he do it black and white or colour
S0509	yeah black and white
S0510	right
S0509	so it be i i didn't can you do colour in darkroom
S0510	of course you can yeah
S0509	oh i didn't know that but yeah i think it must be easier to do
S0510	right
S0509	black and white
S0510	right
S0509	he's never actually do darkroom stuff before so he's like well hopefully i won't mess it up you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	oh yeah it's quite a process wasn't there when you be that be quite appeal for you darkroom photography
S0509	i mean it er seem quite cool to me but
S0510	yeah
S0509	we have at college at college at school we have erm this light sensitive er like i want to say paper but it's not paper it's like flimsy plasticy stuff
S0510	okay yeah
S0509	and so you could like create stuff that look kind of dark roomy
S0510	right
S0509	by like put all these object on it and then
S0510	yeah
S0509	you'd just expose it to light and then you could like wash that and it make them develop it and then it would just be like the silhouette of these things
S0510	mm
S0509	and by layer different things you could create different like depth of light and shade on it
S0510	yeah oh i don't
S0509	which be quite cool
S0510	remember see any of those
S0509	well no because i couldn't do it like as a proper project
S0510	right
S0509	because we didn't actually have the the liquid stuff to develop it in
S0510	the chemicals right
S0509	to to like
S0510	yeah
S0509	so it would it would all just change colour completely
S0510	right
S0509	i use it in my book as like back stuff though which be lot a lot of people
S0510	oh okay
S0509	use it for
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	it be that be the only thing really
S0510	so how many be be you of be be there of you as it be
S0509	er
S0510	do the model
S0509	there oh i don't know cos they weren't all there when i be there but er
S0510	be he just do portrait photography
S0509	yeah he be do erm he want to do like his project's on fear
S0510	right
S0509	so he be he like would ask er us he ask us the other day like what our fear be and then he would do something relate to that
S0510	oh okay
S0509	so like one girl er who i meet in a ncs but she go to my college and she's friends with them so i see her sometimes
S0510	yeah
S0509	but erm her fear be clown so they get to get make up and and dress as a clown and stand behind her and
S0510	but you do tell her beforehand
S0509	yeah yeah
S0510	he be gonna do that right
S0509	and she be like i i don't wanna have to look at him i can't look at him
S0510	right
S0509	and so
S0510	right
S0509	she she say it she say it be terrify but
S0510	really
S0509	she do it anyway
S0510	oh dear
S0509	so yeah
S0509	yeah
S0510	so and what be your fear
S0509	er i just like oh there's plenty but i just go with failure
S0509	so erm so it be quite funny actually but er because i turn up and he he'd want to do erm like er a projection behind me with like a cardboard cutout to do like er an f or whatever you know
S0510	oh okay
S0509	cos that's not really the kind of failure i be think of but whatever anyway that be what he be gonna do cos it be easier for him but he find out with someone else can't really project cos the light just doesn't work
S0510	oh okay
S0509	in this scenario so erm i'd just get my test paper back from psychology
S0510	yeah
S0509	er which be my mock which you know i she say oh keep this for your file
S0510	oh okay
S0509	so erm he's like have you get some paper that i can write on and i be like well why don't you just write on my actual on this actual test paper
S0509	cos obviously it's get like the actual cover then
S0510	yeah
S0509	and so he just write failure across it and do an f
S0510	oh god
S0509	i say he could he be like be you sure i be like yeah go for it i mean it's just gonna sit in my in my file
S0509	i'm only gonna be
S0510	right
S0509	the only one see it
S0510	yeah
S0509	so yeah and then i be i be i be say to him yeah i'm gonna have to my parent be gonna see that i'm gonna have to explain explain it to them why's failure write across your
S0509	exam paper it be for art
S0509	so
S0510	you suffer for your art
S0509	yeah
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	so he do that so erm i want to see them
S0510	and what be the actual grade an a grade
S0509	yeah
S0510	yeah
S0509	so so he'd he'd write failure across it first of all and then somebody else in the room go it's quite funny cos there's just an a below that so he
S0509	he be like can i change it to an f and i be like yeah go for it
S0510	deface an exam paper i don't know
S0509	yeah
S0509	it's quite funny
S0510	so what do you have to look mournful and hold the paper
S0509	he yeah i have he get me to like hold it in my mouth it be really weird but yeah
S0510	right
S0509	and then yeah he didn't really i just sort of look quite serious and miserable but
S0509	and he just take the photo
S0510	yeah
S0509	it be cool
S0510	oh there weren't any snake slither about be there
S0509	no but
S0509	they'd find erm his dad word in a charity shop
S0510	yeah
S0509	and and he'd find him this erm it be a real spider but a dead one
S0510	right
S0509	and so they just have a dead
S0510	preserve
S0509	a like a yeah a big dead spider cos somebody's fear be spiders
S0510	oh my goodness
S0509	yeah so that be interest
S0510	and i'm guess that that person wasn't prepare to hold it in their hand
S0509	no i think
S0510	be it dangle above her or something
S0509	i think she erm she say no i can't do it in the end cos she be just too freak out
S0510	freak
S0509	out too freak out by it yeah
S0510	oh
S0509	yeah
S0510	bite of photoshop oh no you can't photoshop cos it would be a darkroom photography
S0509	no so she he just have to lose that person
S0510	right right
S0509	but yeah yeah
S0509	and he be cos we be talk about it at lunch on wednesday and erm cos he he be ask for people to volunteer to do it and erm
S0510	mm
S0509	he be ask what his fear be and go i don't really have a fear and then he go actually no i do it's walk down a dark alley at night and then a guy on a motorbike come along and shoot me
S0509	and he be like so he's like right so so somebody shoot you then it be like no no no it's gotta be these very these very specific circumstances of what i'm afraid of
S0510	if somebody be come down a dark alley at night
S0509	yeah
S0510	on a motorbike
S0509	on a motorbike and shoot me
S0510	that he should be pretty safe in the uk
