S0530	i plan to actually sleep through the night at that point because i be so tire
S0529	mm
S0530	but then i wake up again at ten so
S0529	oh right yeah yeah go to sleep at seven and then attempt to sleep all
S0530	mm
S0529	night be pretty tall order
S0530	it be a pretty ambitious think but
S0529	yeah
S0530	i that's how tire i be think i might be able to do it cos this be what my family do because they're weird like my mum can go to bed at like eight o'clock at night and sleep all night and i just don't understand how she do it
S0529	mm
S0530	but yeah
S0529	our in a situation where i think that my family know about my blog and that's just
S0530	no
S0529	the thing you don't wanna hear isn't it you know what i mean like
S0530	they know where your blog be or they know you have a blog
S0529	i don't know cos what happen be
S0530	my family know i think
S0529	do they know oh how do you deal with it
S0530	they know i have a blog but they don't know what my blog be
S0529	do they know what it be though cos i'm worry that
S0530	no no no no
S0529	i'm worry that they know what it be be the problem
S0530	i tell them it's like a writers' blog
S0529	oh yeah cos
S0530	because it's partly true
S0529	yeah well like no that be for you cos you do actually write no but what happen be like my mum ring me up yesterday and she be like i think you've be on like this you've just be like write talk to people like on the internet for too long and i be like how what why would you say something like that cos she never say stuff like that
S0530	mm
S0529	and i kind of be like oh shit do you like know something that you wanna tell me and then erm we have a bite of a fight so i just like hang up on her
S0530	oh my god
S0529	but she didn't like say whether she like find it or not cos i didn't wanna like bring to her attention that i have a blog if she didn't know
S0530	mm if she didn't know
S0529	and then just like just find out if she have be on it but she say something that kind of sound like she might have an inkling and then i write that on my blog i write like i've gotta hope my mum didn't know about this blog i hope like hasn't tell her and then my friend just texted me this morning that i'm gonna be really honest with you me and like erm write a message to your auntie on facebook like tell her like we're worry about you erm and i get like really angry at that because they know how much i don't like talk about it to my family and they like
S0530	yeah
S0529	what i tell them in confidence i expect to be kind of keep in confidence
S0530	mm
S0529	and i be really quite angry erm
S0530	oh yeah
S0529	but i say like yeah i get what i get like kinda why you do it but you've just gotta like take this with a pinch of salt like i'm up here you know i'm write all this stuff when i'm on my own and i do actually have people to talk to like i you know i've get you i've get the college i've get you know like i'm see counsel and stuff so they don't need to worry
S0530	mm mm
S0529	and she be like okay that's fine and then and then my other friend though who's the one who actually write the message i'm try to get in contact with her but she's not reply to me
S0530	no
S0529	so i don't actually know if she have like she could have do but also i don't think they tell her like my address the blog address
S0530	mm
S0529	like i i would hope they didn't but
S0530	i'm sure they wouldn't of tell her
S0529	i know it just seem to be the no apparently say like she just say i have a blog like in the message but i mean my auntie kind of know i have a blog cos i think i mention it but i don't know what they tell her like it's really really scary er
S0530	i doubt they would have tell her where you're at on your blog or what your url be
S0529	i know but even so it's
S0530	but yeah it's not great
S0529	it's really like piss me off a lot i kind of get why they do it but also i don't get why they do it because they know me and they know that that's like
S0530	your
S0529	one hundred of things you should not do
S0530	mm
S0529	to piss off
S0530	i mean if
S0530	if they say i'm worry about they could of just say like i just i ring her up and speak to her and she's not very happy if they have to do it you know what i mean rather than say er look on her blog
S0529	yeah
S0530	like i wouldn't yeah
S0529	like why didn't they just tell me
S0530	yeah mm
S0529	like why didn't they just say to me like i'm worry about you because they haven't do that they've just be like like routinely ask if i'm okay
S0530	no
S0529	and then i say to like to be fair would you rather i kind of like unload on you like i do on tumblr every time
S0530	mm
S0529	cos that's what 's be do about her situation and 's like completely exhaust with it and i say to her like do you really want that and she be like yeah fair enough like cos i don't mind that i understand that you know not everyone can take it at once and so that's why i kind of like keep my answer short when she's when she's ask me how i be
S0530	mm
S0529	cos she look on my blog anyway and it's just like that's really annoy me and now i wanna change my url cos i don't want yeah cos i i mean the ideal situation would be if i could just like delete it completely but do that
S0530	no i don't think you should have to do that
S0529	but i don't know if i can do that at the moment like i do think i mean i know it's like really toxic and i be like really dependent on it but uh i don't know i think i have get better with it like last year it be way worse than this on tumblr like i be literally just go on there all the time
S0530	mm mm
S0529	but now i kind of only go on there to re blog stuff and then if i get message i'll answer them but i'm make a lot more like a lot less kind of actual like personal post
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	than i use to
S0530	definitely
S0529	which be kind of an improvement but i don't think i can actually delete it yet and
S0530	well you shouldn't you shouldn't feel like you have to like there's nothing wrong with it but
S0529	well no it be
S0530	there be a point like where maybe it can detract from your real life
S0529	yeah definitely
S0530	just for your own yeah i mean for me now like i go on it in the even a little bite
S0529	yeah
S0530	but i don't go on it during the day really
S0529	mm
S0530	which help cos it's like routine maybe
S0529	mm
S0530	i dunno but yeah i mean sometimes the reality like get addict to this sort of thing like the line between real life and tumblr can kind of get blur
S0529	yeah and like that and
S0530	mm mm
S0529	but yeah like when you're feel really low you do get wrap up in it and it's difficult not to
S0530	yeah definitely cos it's an easy way of express yourself really
S0529	well exactly that that's what like my argument be like i feel better talk like write about it than i do actually like
S0530	mm
S0529	verbally speak and oh it's just problems when it's friends yeah but she just she show it to everyone like like and that
S0530	mm
S0529	i get that she's scar and she's worry and stuff but she show it to her boyfriend er she show it to her friends and they all know about it and it's just er like i know it's public but you have to find it like you have to have the name of it to know what what it be
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	and she just give out the name of it and it's like
S0530	that's not that's not right to be honest
S0529	no
S0530	i wouldn't ever give out anybody's tumblr
S0529	no i know like i like i i erm i sympathise with her because no i empathise with her even like i get doesn't know what to do and her and her boyfriend talk about it a lot but i just i don't really like what she
S0530	go behind your back and do it yeah
S0529	well no i'm glad she tell me today cos didn't fuck step up like she hasn't even reply to me and she hasn't gotta read more things so i bet she's read it and just isn't reply cos i've send her like five message it's really annoy
S0530	ah
S0529	but enough of my stupid dramas
S0530	it's not stupid dramas
S0530	i get piss off and anxious when people read my blog that i don't know
S0529	like if my family have read it that be like a massive like a massive drama
S0530	yeah yeah literally i don't mind if my friends read it sometimes
S0530	like some of my friends like
S0529	mm
S0530	people that it freak me out a bite like people say i know you in real life and i really like your blog
S0529	oh god i know yeah
S0530	it's like okay like be you real or be you just try to create drama i don't know but
S0529	yeah like do you mean when they're on when they're on anon yeah
S0530	yeah they say like i know you in real life and i think you're really cool and stuff i'm like okay
S0529	mm yeah that's really weird
S0530	it be strange but like i don't like the cos my family just don't get it
S0529	no
S0530	like they don't get what my blog mean and what i do on it and
S0529	no
S0530	stuff and
S0529	no i mean i hope my my family don't but i'm just worry about my sister as well like
S0530	mm
S0529	if i say anything on there that's like really bad which i have do in the past
S0530	mm
S0529	which be you know i should stop do but she always like i dunno i'm just worry she's gonna like tell my mum everything
S0530	yeah
S0529	oh just like
S0530	er i mean like
S0529	that would be the worst nightmare in the world
S0530	mm
S0529	if they find my blog like if they be literally on my blog just imagine it ah
S0530	i mean er be your mum the kind of person who would like she would read it secretly er she'd keep read it
S0529	yeah she's nosy she's nosy like that
S0530	my you see my parent be like that
S0529	she's like extremely nosy like she's like aunt petunia nosy
S0529	like honestly my mum be aunt petunia there be so many similarities she's a neat freak she's nosy she care about what the neighbour think
S0530	oh my god
S0529	she's quite severe she's really tall
S0530	do she have a lot of neck
S0529	long neck long neck yep
S0529	honestly they be like the same person i have an epiphany about this a couple of months ago and i be like oh shit
S0530	she's aunt petunia
S0529	she's aunt petunia
S0529	it's amaze yeah no she would definitely be one to do that i can totally see her do that i know she use to read my diary
S0530	really
S0529	and my sister's yeah
S0530	oh
S0529	i leave it lie around when she come to clean our room
S0530	be she how do you find that out do she tell you
S0529	no cos i find it in a different place
S0530	oh
S0529	i do certain things that like so i'll know exactly where it be and so i know exactly when someone hasn't move it and it would it have move
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	my sister and she be like no i would tell you and she would so it be my mum
S0530	yeah it do freak you out when parent like cos i don't i don't think like they really get it at all like why people do it they just think
S0529	no they really don't well it's just a different generation isn't it
S0530	and i don't think yeah
S0529	they don't get that we're kind of tumblr obsess this these days and we have be warp a little bite by you know what's on that website cos it's not all good like some of it's absolutely bullshit and people just need to go outside
S0530	mm
S0529	but but for the most part it's like you know you people your own age
S0530	yeah
S0529	and you all have like of like common issue and interest and things like that
S0530	yeah definitely
S0529	but yeah like it's ironic really that i've stop use a diary and start use tumblr like
S0530	cos it be almost a diary
S0529	because it it feel more private to me than the tumblr it's like
S0530	than a diary mm
S0529	a worldwide thing that anybody can see if they know my it's quite ridiculous but it feel a lot more personal than a diary
S0530	if you ever want to keep a diary like here would be like the best place ironically
S0529	i know it would yeah it really would
S0530	because like nobody's gonna come here in here and like steal it
S0529	yeah but typing's easier
S0530	yeah it be
S0530	it be like i've try keep diaries recently but if
S0529	yeah
S0530	blogging be easier
S0529	and people reply to you as well
S0530	yeah and try and comfort you and be like you're okay
S0529	and it's like yeah yeah i know and like i i know that sometimes that's not very good either but it's just yeah
S0530	the thing be though like people understand like like tumblr be one of the only place leave on the internet where you can like say shit without be judge
S0529	yes exactly
S0530	like they only say like now like on facebook and twitter they threaten you with erm like they say what be it they say like employers will look at it and
S0529	yeah
S0530	not hire you and stuff
S0529	yeah
S0530	and it's like i dunno like i i i wouldn't want to post the sort of thing i write on tumblr anyway to people that i know like no way in hell but tumblr be just different like it's
S0529	mm
S0530	almost hide within the depths of
S0529	it be
S0530	the world
S0529	yeah cos i i forget sometimes like how many people like in my actual life like know about my blog
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	and it really worry me
S0530	me too
S0529	like cos they sometimes like pick up on it and say like oh i saw that on your blog last week and i be like oh god you know about it too
S0530	no no
S0529	it's just it's really bad cos it just feel like this internet thing for only people you don't know
S0530	mm
S0529	to see it but then i think like some of the anons that i get must be people i know you know like this
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	it must be
S0530	well who else would like
S0529	exactly
S0530	care
S0529	who else would like be so invest like it's just erm i don't know it's really
S0530	cos you do get a few dodgy question like
S0529	i do i know
S0530	well not even dodgy just strangely interest in certain bits
S0529	i know yeah
S0530	like some of them admit that they know me in real life and i'm like oh god who be like i always wonder like if they be somebody that i know vaguely or somebody like my
S0529	yeah
S0530	one of my best friends or something i'm like oh god cos like surely my
S0530	my best friends can just talk to me about shit
S0529	exactly
S0530	so it's not like
S0529	i know i sometimes think that that erm 's do it like sometimes i think that she send like cos she i know she keep up with it all the time erm and she probably doesn't wanna like just say it on her own blog and stuff
S0530	mm
S0529	but then sometimes like i get well not sometimes but a few a few time i've have people on facebook like message me say like oh i i know your blog like i've be like kind of follow it a bite and i just want to say that i have a lot in common with you and shit and
S0530	wow okay
S0529	this be too much now it's
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	a real life thing and this be not okay i can't deal with it i really can't
S0530	it's like when people on let's be friends like i don't know who you be so we can't be friends
S0529	yeah i know i put like oh you need to come off and on then and then but in reality i'm like no please don't i don't wanna ever know who you be like i'm too scar i don't i don't want it to be reveal i'd rather they stay anonymous
S0530	yeah i part of me really want to know but then another part of me be like plus when they're on anon you can't block them
S0529	i know
S0530	so it's like
S0529	yeah
S0530	like the i wouldn't ever say i know you in real life on anon cos i know it would freak somebody out like the only time you'd ever use anon be like i don't know just send a secret nice comment like you look nice or something but i wouldn't ever do it on anon because like i have tumblr so
S0529	yeah
S0530	you know
S0529	no i probably would have i would do it on anon i think i'm too shy for that
S0530	yeah if somebody have come across come across their blog or something and then i be just like but i wouldn't ever hint like i know who you be sort of thing you know
S0529	no no no no like if you're not gonna reveal yourself which they never do then what's the point in say it like
S0530	i know
S0529	cos you know they say to you like oh i know who you be i wish we be friends blah blah blah and then you're like okay well come on anon and then we can you know whatever but then they just never reply like
S0530	i know
S0529	ever again it's really frustrate but also you're kind glad about it
S0530	no it isn't it's
S0529	the solution be to turn off anonymous but i don't want to do that because
S0530	it's not worth it for the good anons you can get you know
S0529	yeah yeah yeah cos most of them like the majority of them which be really surprise cos i have a lot of problematic things on that blog that people could pick into and really have a go at me but mostly people be nice
S0530	they be like
S0529	mm
S0530	i have a feel on my blog like people that do they're like my friends that be quite close to you but like i can't we don't just start chat crap to each other like
S0529	yeah
S0530	you know sometimes some of them be like some sort of trigger like i've get some friends that we just don't talk about like
S0529	yeah
S0530	personal stuff until something like major happen
S0529	yeah
S0530	whereas i've get other friends like they see my blog and say what's up be you okay
S0529	mm
S0530	i saw your blog whereas others'd just be like
S0529	so 'll know about your blog as well
S0530	not all of them only a few
S0529	oh yeah
S0530	yeah but i think others do though like cos it's so weird and i'm just like oh god like
S0529	i know that's the problem like when you have one friend who know it just get out and it's just horrible
S0530	like i have like i think it be three friends that know at the begin that be it and then there's like there's some people though my friends who be friends with them find it because they've start re blogging some of my stuff and i be like
S0529	yeah
S0530	oh god i didn't consider this
S0529	oh yeah
S0530	and then some of the girls in my sister's year be follow me
S0529	oh no
S0530	so i'm like oh god please i bet you fee back to my sister
S0529	shit
S0530	about me and my life and i'm oh god but my sister like
S0529	oh that's horrible
S0530	my sister deny anything like she's just like your she's like i'm not interest in your life i'm not that sad
S0529	yeah
S0530	but i'm like surely you be though because you're my sister
S0529	yeah
S0530	like you know
S0529	i know mm
S0530	so it's quite strange but then again my sister's friend post really depress shit so i could just like
S0529	why do we get so much flak for it like we everyone do it
S0530	yeah
S0529	it's not that bad
S0530	i might just make a little page on my thing like if you know me in real life click this and i'm like if you if what i'm if i'm probably fine
S0529	yeah
S0530	so just don't fee back stuff i say to friends
S0529	i know i've kinda do that i write that on my about me i say i don't have a filter so just like you know expect everything
S0530	yeah
S0529	just like that
S0530	yeah yeah they should do that
S0529	and it have be in the past but i can't help what i'm write cos you know in the moment you can't really so
S0530	exactly like it's just my outlet to express myself so
S0529	yeah which sound totally like lame but it's true
S0530	it be it be like you can kind of release your mind onto it and not be fear of put
S0529	literally like people that like go out like party and things and things go on in my town like people have come up to me and say like oh i know i know your blog and then she's like how do it get round i don't i don't understand
S0530	no yeah
S0529	how it get round it's really scary
S0530	er i mean it's just i don't know how it happen
S0529	mm i i really wanna change my url i dunno what to change it to
S0530	how about the opposite of what yours be so it could be
S0529	what like backwards cos would find it
S0530	no like use it use erm be it be it a how do you pronounce it
S0529	oh like loud
S0530	loud and reveal
S0529	loud and reveal that would be funny no it need to be something that people won't guess cos i don't want them to find it you know
S0530	oh okay
S0529	ah
S0530	we need to think of something deep and meaningful
S0529	exactly exactly cos the first one's like
S0530	that be deep and meaningful we need to think of something even more deep and meaningful
S0530	how about
S0529	i make it when i be fourteen and i wasn't even like i be still fine at that point which be funny
S0530	mm okay
S0529	mm all the good ones have go anyway
S0530	yeah we don't want you to have to be like you know fill it with number
S0529	it be like a four three and

S0530	like fry chicken queen one
S0529	oh
S0530	it should be fry chicken queen that'll be amaze

S0530	oh
S0529	this be what they mean when it's just constant rain
S0530	yeah this be this be the reality of our situation now we're just here
S0529	yeah we're if really erm for some reason cos there's a little bite warm down there i suppose but erm yeah my mum be like oh it's just constant rain up here and like for the first kind of like month i be like oh this isn't too bad it's kind of like nice weather
S0530	it be really nice when we first come here
S0529	it be yeah it be such a nice day and it be kinda like that for another week and but now it's shit
S0530	it really be i this be what we're gonna have for
S0530	mm
S0530	it's a rot day today it's like
S0529	it's the fifteenth
S0530	so we've be here six weeks longer than six weeks
S0529	longer than that
S0530	six and a half
S0529	mm
S0530	it do feel longer than that so we've be here six oh fuck hell like how how be that even
S0530	i don't know
S0529	i can't believe it's the fifteenth of november already jesus
S0530	mm yep
S0529	come up so quickly
S0530	but then again we have by the by the time we get to next weekend it'll be three weeks till christmas i think which it doesn't sound long do it at all like i think a month sound quite a while but then
S0529	what until christmas day or until we break up
S0530	break up
S0529	ah damn
S0530	don't get your expectations too high
S0529	be it three weeks this week
S0530	be it this week
S0529	i think so cos it be four weeks i remember say it's four weeks till we break up last week
S0530	see what the date be today the date be the fifteenth
S0530	yeah maybe it be then
S0529	not it's no it's just under a month so it's not quite four weeks i think
S0530	alright okay that's good though
S0529	mm
S0530	oh it's gonna be so good and we'll be at home for a month how good be that
S0529	mm
S0530	a month at home
S0529	i'll probably get sick of it though
S0530	you probably will you'll have to tell me how be go and whether you're like i miss which probably won't happen
S0529	i'll be my out
S0530	no i think i think a month be a a nice amount of time to be at home but it might be a bite it might feel a bite too long but i bet you'll have a really good week when you first get back
S0529	yeah
S0530	or first two weeks at least
S0529	mm
S0530	just yeah
S0529	yeah i think christmas'll be good
S0530	cos christmas be a nice time of year anyway like even if i it's kinda shit when you go home for the summer because there's not really that much to do but christmas there's things go on
S0529	mm
S0530	like even probably where you live there's stuff go on
S0529	there's a little bite go on
S0530	little bite go on christmas so yeah
S0529	i dunno can also be really awkward be at home cos then everyone'll be like oh
