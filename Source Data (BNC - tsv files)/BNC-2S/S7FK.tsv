S0517	mm
S0558	there will be one hundred thousand people
S0517	over the age of a hundred
S0558	of the age of one hundred
S0558	which be absolutely okay but my question be okay so you get to the age of fifty you get your hot sweat
S0517	yeah
S0558	and your memory loss
S0558	be we gonna live longer and the problems will start later the ache joint the
S0517	well mm
S0558	arthritis all and all the rest of it or be they still go to happen when they would normally happen and then
S0517	and you've just gotta put up with them for longer
S0558	you might pop off and put up with it for longer
S0517	dunno
S0558	we need to do some research
S0517	i don't know
S0558	because that's what we need to know because i think the alternative we invent a tablet that we
S0558	could patent
S0558	that people can buy
S0517	and just say my time's up
S0558	my time's up
S0558	i'm go and we have produce the tablet
S0517	ninety five that's
S0558	we'd make a fortune

S0517	my mother would have one
S0558	yeah she would bless her
S0517	she would
S0558	she would
S0517	she'd you're right there
S0558	she would
S0558	but it make you wonder mm
S0517	that that's that's a lot of people over a hundred isn't it
S0558	a lot
S0517	that's a lot
S0558	because that be become of course unless the erm i wanna say hiroshima but it's not
S0558	what's the bomb
S0517	the bomb the
S0558	the north korea
S0517	the nuclear bomb
S0558	it's not nuclear though
S0517	oh north right
S0558	it's the other one they do isn't it last week
S0517	oh i don't know
S0558	or this week mm
S0558	it's an alternative to nuclear of course if that go off
S0517	problem solve
S0558	there'll be no need for any tablets
S0517	and then we won't
S0558	we'll er
S0517	be rich

S0558	mamma mia we can get up and have a dance have a bite of a laugh and a giggle and it might
S0517	oh why not
S0558	you know

S0558	rather than just
S0517	she's just
S0558	sit and talk
S0517	yes
S0558	i think shall i do like something like a movie night
S0517	mm
S0558	and like do that what do you think
S0517	yeah why not good idea she be down about it again on box day
S0558	be she down
S0517	she be a bite
S0558	i ask at school and she say they have a lovely day she say and nanny and her grandad come
S0517	yes
S0558	say and they don't normally both come but they do
S0517	mm
S0558	and then it be obviously mummy and the three girls she say they have a lovely day and erm daddy come round on the morning to open present but then er he go and then they her and the girls obviously go to daddy's on box day
S0517	well that's good then that's good that erm that's good because 's you know it be slightly different
S0558	exactly
S0517	to that
S0558	but 's version be
S0517	so as long as
S0558	lovely yeah
S0517	oh good so she have a nice day
S0558	cos i didn't know whether to fee it back to but i think again i i don't want her think i'm
S0517	well she she might appreciate have a nice christmas day she say erm yes it's unusual obviously her mum and her dad come
S0558	yeah
S0517	erm but they seem to be get on much better
S0558	mm
S0517	lately don't they her
S0558	i don't know
S0517	anyway so they both come she say they both leave about six seven o'clock and leave her with all the clear up to do say they didn't help at all erm but the issue be that have come round on christmas day morning to open the present with the girls which apparently he he always do doesn't it
S0558	he's always do it apparently
S0517	he's always do it hasn't he
S0558	cos he's before now he's sleep on the settee hasn't he so he's there
S0517	oh have he
S0558	when they wake up
S0517	when they be much younger well anyway
S0558	i know in the early days yeah
S0517	well anyway so he come round again to open up to open the present say her mum and dad both arrive around eleven eleven thirty she's think he'll be go soon it get to about one thirty and she be get ready to serve the lunch and he be still there and she say you know he always just outstay his welcome he always just take it too far until it get to the point where she have to say er you know it it's time for you to go it be never the arrangement that you'd stay for lunch you've you come to open the present see the girls open their present and so he go but apparently this and obviously box day which be when i be out with her she say she'd get up that morning to a really really abusive text from him full of expletives about how she'd ruin his christmas kick him out wasn't allow to spend it with his children you know just really
S0558	but it be
S0517	eff
S0558	never the original arrangement no
S0517	no i know it be never the original arrangement so she say you know obviously his health isn't good at all erm and she say you know i'm will to support him and i'm will to do everything i can but she say then i i wake up and i get this you know
S0558	see as well
S0517	if
S0558	from point of view if you think of it this be the first christmas that hasn't be around
S0517	hasn't be
S0558	and he might have see it as an opportunity of
S0517	yeah
S0558	to be able to stay there for the day
S0517	but on the other side of that though i mean he's that's 's house
S0558	i know
S0517	they're live in it and how weird be that to then say oh i'll you know i i'll go and see my ex wife or not even my ex wife they're not divorce i do tell she need to get divorce in twenty sixteen erm
S0558	they won't though because
S0517	well she say she say she think she might anyway erm i say so you know to go round and see your still exist wife that you've be separate from for so many years in another man's house it's just weird but anyway so you know so from her point of view it hadn't be as smooth as obviously have perceive it which be nice that they have
S0558	yeah and she get a smile and bright sparkly eye when she be tell me so all the body language be right
S0517	but they yes but they er and his dad be have a christmas day with people family over
S0558	that's right
S0517	on box day so
S0558	yeah
S0517	he have nothing really particularly to go home to cos his dad be out at friends or something
S0558	yeah cos he go to friends for christmas day
S0517	so he have so you know part of it part of me think i didn't say it to but part of me think do you know what what's an extra plate and an extra slice of turkey
S0558	yeah yeah
S0517	and who know
S0558	and that that far into the day
S0517	er into the day and who know what his health will be like next year
S0558	yeah
S0517	you know if he's on this transplant list you know versus i know it's not the arrangement i know they're separate i know so you can see it from both side
S0558	but if they can go out shop together
S0517	well yes
S0558	what's the difference of him
S0517	what's the difference in
S0558	have a place at the table
S0517	the well i know i know so so you know it's the usual it's the usual with i mean i feel
S0558	i mean i i would like
S0517	sorry for her but she have bring er load of it on herself but i i do still feel sorry for her but erm
S0558	what happen if something happen to before it happen to will everything
S0517	i don't know
S0558	go to the girls cos cos be absolute at he would have want them i mean i haven't have a conversation with for a long time but when i be see him weekly
S0517	mm
S0558	he would turn in his grave if if his inheritance end up on 's lap
S0517	go for
S0558	oh absolutely big time
S0517	well yeah but he's erm he he'll have all that sort won't he because
S0558	well yeah because he want he he have want to get divorce from ever since it happen
S0517	yes well well it's i mean
S0558	because she will automatically be his next of kin if they be still marry so if 's no longer here and everything's go to and something happen to him
S0517	you're right
S0558	she's his next of kin therefore would get it and he doesn't want that to happen under no
S0517	right
S0558	circumstances
S0517	and it wasn't until be it who be it that say at your house or be it you that be that why the house isn't it joint name because 's still marry to
S0558	i never say that
S0517	so
S0558	but that could be
S0517	it be at your house i'm sure maybe it be
S0558	must be
S0517	somebody say and i think what a er it didn't occur to me cos he end up get the mortgage
S0558	mm
S0517	not a joint mortgage and of course if she's still marry to presumably
S0558	but also
S0517	he then would own half the house would he i don't know i don't know
S0558	no no because it would be the
S0517	or it could go to some of them
S0558	name on the deeds it would be the name on the deeds wouldn't it
S0517	yeah
S0558	so
S0517	i don't know
S0558	would have to do a will then
S0517	what what
S0558	you can come in
S0517	you may speak
S0558	talk to me and i'll tell her
S0558	oh
S0517	oh
S0558	work
S0517	well it's quite costly these days for you be it a board report
S0517	how many page
S0517	thirteen
S0517	when have you get to send it in
S0517	oh fine okay then
S0558	do that mean you've get to do it tonight after the weekend so that's either tonight or monday
S0558	that's what i mean
S0517	well yes
S0558	you've gotta do it tonight if you don't wanna do it on the weekend
S0517	yeah that's very true
S0558	that's no wine for you
S0517	oh i we've give it up pretty much for january
S0517	right off you go
S0517	you've have your say
S0558	oh bless him
S0558	erm no what would it would be the people on the deed right on the deed
S0517	yeah okay
S0558	so it would be and would have to do a will if she be legitimately half an owner
S0517	right
S0558	but erm for example if anything happen between her and her half would go to her children
S0517	right
S0558	yeah she'd have to specify that otherwise it would just fall to cos he's the other person on the
S0517	oh okay
S0558	on the document
S0517	right
S0558	isn't he
S0517	oh okay
S0558	but i think it's probably more because now we're in negative equity so she probably hasn't she's she's probably come out of it i would imagine with absolutely
S0517	with nothing
S0558	no profit
S0517	i yeah yes
S0558	she's probably have nothing to put in
S0517	probably not no
S0558	so why would put include her name on the
S0517	i don't know but he'd draw up this trust agreement to give her equity after two years
S0558	well i suppose he think they be
S0517	i dunno
S0558	they would be together
S0517	but it didn't last six months do it since they buy that house that be the worst thing they do anyway i don't know
S0558	but
S0517	but thing i think she'd still have him back
S0558	do you think
S0517	yes after my walk
S0558	so why do he walk out then
S0517	i don't really know
S0558	so he's walk out
S0517	he leave her
S0558	because it get nasty didn't it
S0517	er well yes the atmosphere
S0558	the influence on the children apparently
S0517	be awful oh yes yes
S0558	you know say that time she say it be so tense and it be just over a bloody cheque
S0517	yeah no the the atmosphere be not good in the house but he leave i always think it would be but he leave erm but the way she talk about him i think she would still have him back and yet she say erm you know oh the warn sign be there i should have run to the hill long ago i say you should have i say because we've have many a walk or a a drink where you've be really upset about what he's do how he be you've say he's have a different mindset to you he doesn't think the same as you you know he didn't get he get divorce from his first wife and he didn't tell his son he be divorce do you remember that
S0558	no
S0517	when get to together with the son er
S0558	yeah
S0517	still think be marry to his mum obviously separate but they have never actually tell their children that they have get a divorce so you know and that be right at the very begin and be say then that's not right that that that's just not right and now he's get a you know a a new girlfriend and i say you i say the warn sign have be there and you have see them i say you've choose to ignore them she say yeah you're right i say so but i be just get the impression she'd have him back and i be try to sort of say you be better off without him as hard as this be right now you've never be i do actually tell her that i didn't think she'd ever come across as completely happy in all the time she'd be with him and she agree with me you know so it wasn't like i be say anything
S0558	so
S0517	out of turn or or say anything er you know to upset her i just sort of say you as as an outsider
S0558	as it be
S0517	you know we've have these walk you've be upset i say there's be many an occasion where you've be on the edge of tear she say i know i know but i still get that impression she'd have him back i say well i think as hard as this bite be now you be better off without him
S0558	but for what reason would she have him back
S0517	well
S0558	for love or
S0517	well i didn't ask her that
S0558	financial convenience you know
S0517	oh i know cos there be all the other stuff of how be she gonna manage the school run without him and
S0558	how do she manage it on her
S0517	i dunno she didn't have a plan at the time she she she didn't have a plan because of course i don't know how get to the station every day
S0558	well er er when it all first start she be kind of in partnership with
S0517	right
S0558	and they be do either a week of that whatever the arrangements be
S0517	whatever it be
S0558	i'm not sure but they be share it and in the end stop because she say it's all take and no give
S0517	give yes yeah
S0558	and she stop it and i go
S0517	how come do you
S0558	well i she didn't tell me it be she tell erm and i say to well i i yeah i can
S0517	you well of course you can
S0558	yeah
S0517	yes you can see that a mile off
S0558	yeah
S0517	anybody would be mad to er to get involve in that type of arrangement she didn't have a so i don't actually know i mean that's the difficulty of not send your kid to the local school i suppose where they can just get on the bus
S0558	mm
S0517	with everyone else but
S0558	yeah
S0517	i don't know anyway watch this space
S0558	well see won't be go there will she cos she hasn't pass
S0517	no she didn't pass no i don't know where she will
S0558	be she go to at
S0517	well she wasn't er 's not happy with the she doesn't want her to go there at all
S0558	mm it's so funny cos not long ago pop in to collect her avon and pay for it and she say something and she say that have highlight the fact of why be it a sport and arts college when they don't offer a level art or something
S0517	oh don't they
S0558	apparently not
S0517	it's perform arts
S0558	exactly
S0558	well i didn't pick up on it i be like
S0517	oh
S0558	all i could think be it's very astute of to come out with a comment like that
S0517	must come from her mother
S0558	and she's kind of read that and she so i be more go down that road
S0517	oh
S0558	and i be think oh blimey there's no fly on her be there blah blah blah blah
S0558	so i be tell about like cor come out with this comment and look at me and she go mum it's perform arts on paintbrush arts and i go you're right
S0517	well of course it be
S0558	just tell just tell her just i awe of tell about her comment erm and she's actually point out that
S0517	it's perform
S0558	of course it's perform art
S0517	perform of course it be although
S0558	not paintbrush arts
S0517	theatre all those theatre productions
S0558	well i be just more
S0517	all those fantastic theatre yeah
S0558	i know i be more
S0517	of course it be
S0558	think like god 's very like
S0517	well do reply
S0558	she do she reply erm something very nice something like erm erm equally sort of like complimentary to 's
S0517	oh okay yes yeah
S0558	sort of you know
S0517	yeah
S0558	erm er sort of erm observation if you like
S0517	yeah but no obviously it's perform arts at that school
S0558	and i say you might you might want to tell
S0517	that yes
S0558	you know
S0517	yeah
S0558	erm
S0517	i didn't realise they do er do a level art but then er why would i my children have never entertain that idea
S0558	no
S0517	mr 's go down to watch at the tennis club tonight coach for part of his
S0558	be he
S0517	a level
S0558	a level
S0517	pe
S0558	his assessment
S0517	yes but when we be at parents' even he say that coach tennis be a difficult one to assess and he wouldn't necessarily recommend that we use it as one of his two practicals for a level you have to have two so obviously one be his play of tennis and the other one he say you know he's get he's get a he's get a few to choose from erm but he say coach wouldn't he say it's just a really difficult one to assess and hard to get higher mark in
S0558	mm
S0517	so which be why they seem to be go down this umpire of badminton well i mean really umpire of badminton
S0558	cos i would've think badminton would be more difficult cos it's so much
S0517	no but the
S0558	faster
S0517	no umpire not play
S0558	oh
S0517	call out the score er er how that work i don't know anyway but of course mr be it mr which one of them mr the his er that be his sport when he be a youngster he be very very very good
S0558	oh
S0517	at badminton apparently so that's his always his emphasis and he say it's really easy to get a high mark for for umpire er anyway but so it so that be an option and there be hockey be an option there be this orienteering that they do in the park there be options erm and then on before they'd go back to school after christmas oh it be the monday the inset day i have a er an email from mr say oh cos we have to record do tennis shots he have to be record with all the different stroke have he do any video have he videoed any of his tennis and erm when would be a good time for me to come down and assess his coach so i tell him when he do do coach and i say i didn't think you'd think that be a good idea to do but he say well we're gonna keep our options open so anyway the upshot be it's a bite warm in here he's go down to coach tonight to watch at half past five but say oh you're joke me i say why he say saturday morning would be much better cos then he have his own group on a friday he's just really help saturday morning he have his own group they're much smaller erm i say well just tell i say and ask say can you
S0558	yeah
S0517	take it so he have
S0558	yeah
S0517	he's and say oh yes you can you know he's tell him what he need to do what
S0558	yeah
S0517	they're gonna do he say yeah you can take it but how stupid be this have ask to ask his teacher to send through his crb form er if he's gonna
S0558	apply for it yourself
S0517	no no
S0558	oh
S0517	no erm mr can mr er i always get them confuse whichever pe teacher be go to watch fax through or email through his his crb form
S0558	oh
S0517	before he's allow to go and stand and watch i say that's ridiculous anybody could go and stand on the edge of a tennis court and watch can't they
S0558	yeah that's yeah
S0517	you know he's a teacher at high school but any but anybody could
S0558	yeah
S0517	anyway
S0558	but you know i
S0517	it's ridiculous
S0558	er er perhaps because the because he's there on an official
S0517	maybe
S0558	status
S0517	maybe
S0558	if if the question be ask it may be policy of the club
S0517	yeah
S0558	to go and watch be one thing but to be there on a official
S0517	to be er yeah maybe
S0558	status it may be
S0517	anyway so apparently the pe teacher's get to
S0558	i tell you
S0517	it's go mad hasn't it
S0558	absolutely go
S0517	but the funny
S0558	stupid
S0517	i know but the funny thing be the group that help coach on a friday night half of them be at the
S0558	oh
S0517	they're in years like nine ten eight nine and ten half of them be there so mr 'll know them all i say
S0558	he'll know them all
S0517	i say to i say you'll have to get make sure they don't play up for you
S0558	give them a slap mr can i introduce discipline
S0517	yeah
S0558	speak to your head teacher about this
S0517	mm
S0558	this be what you do when they don't behave
S0517	oh dear
S0558	oh
S0517	so have go off to school this week in his black jeans on the basis that there's a new head of sixth form who won't mind

S0558	well would have be sort of reception stroke year one
S0517	oh oh oh okay
S0558	do you know what i mean
S0517	yeah
S0558	you know when you think
S0517	mm
S0558	and i and never ever anything since but i've never be in their company long enough i've be in 's at like
S0517	yes yeah
S0558	or athletics i mean when be go to athletics we be car share for competitions and and i use to sit and have a good old natter about anything and everything never anything
S0517	no
S0558	i would never have question what she say or how she say it
S0517	but when she be do when she be do athletics be she discipline then or be she
S0558	yeah
S0517	enjoy it
S0558	yeah
S0517	but she doesn't do that any more
S0558	the only reason
S0517	no
S0558	no the only reason she give up be because she be tell she have to make a choice because of the time
S0517	oh why
S0558	more than anything
S0517	what else do she do
S0558	football
S0517	oh yes there will be that yes
S0558	and she choose football
S0517	right
S0558	because it be just
S0517	yes yeah
S0558	be you know
S0517	time
S0558	say it's it's just the cost cos athletics can be quite an expensive sport with the trainers and all that as you know erm like tennis you know have to restring and buy
S0517	oh i know
S0558	new racquets you have to replace your trainers more often than you would normally
S0517	mm
S0558	that sort of thing erm and she say you know she's gonna have to make a choice but
S0517	mm
S0558	never once in all the time i've be in 's company have i ever think what she say or how she say it you know you'd think oh
S0517	no no they always come across so nice so that's really surprise that 's so erm
S0558	oh yeah her behaviour be
S0517	oh what a shame
S0558	just just whether you want to call outspoken disrespectful erm
S0517	it's get to be a bite more than that to get expel
S0558	because it be ongoing
S0517	oh okay
S0558	it just keep go on and it just be things like she'd ask if she could go to the toilet do i tell you this story
S0517	yes you do
S0558	yeah
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	things like you know like this persistent
S0517	yeah oh gosh
S0558	but then sometimes i think you know like lovely girl quite witty but always for whatever reason i don't know and and and i only know this because 's confirm it from scout will ask the most ridiculous of question
S0517	oh yes
S0558	a ridiculous right so apparently say to me the other day that they be in english and the teacher's return from maternity leave
S0517	mm
S0558	and the book they're read be the christmas story
S0517	right
S0558	you know the scrooge

S0558	that's the word
S0517	yes
S0558	and erm in the class put her hand up and say miss why be we read a christmas carol when christmas have just finish i think it's a logical question why not choose something else
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	if you be lead up to christmas you know
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	it's a logical question apparently oh i'm not put up with your silly question this year think about what you're say
S0517	oh
S0558	so come in come in mate
S0558	come in mate
S0517	oh okay

S0558	you take care
S0558	negotiate nothing other than the best
S0558	erm
S0517	oh so the oh so the but the
S0558	so be it a case that
S0517	mm
S0558	you sort of like create yourself within this picture of a
S0517	no you cannot put some proper shoe on
S0517	he's not
S0558	garden shoe
S0517	he get those horrible plastic green clog things and he's i've tell him he's not allow to leave the property in those
S0558	wear these like walk trousers stroke trainers and he'll take the dog out for a walk that's fine or he'll go trek across or whatever it's fine it's absolutely fine but he's into a real bad habit of wear them all the time
S0517	the time i know well
S0558	and i've tell him i've tell him now i be not
S0517	absolutely
S0558	go out with him

S0558	yeah
S0517	mm
S0558	i tell you
S0517	oh er ignore him
S0558	we're ignore you
S0517	he can never

S0558	don't read the gauge it's faulty it's very low
S0558	need fill up
S0558	so
S0517	anyway
S0558	erm
S0558	oh he's go in a stomp now i have my own key all of a sudden
S0558	erm so do you create this image person of yourself so it it's a bite like isn't it that
S0517	that people be short temper with you
S0558	exactly
S0517	before you've begin
S0558	before
S0517	mm
S0558	and and they don't think actually that's a logical question i'll answer nicely
S0517	yeah there be a bite of that
S0558	there's the history of what have be and and all the rest of it do you know what i mean
S0517	mm
S0558	or be it that the teacher's have a bad day be a little bite unprofessional
