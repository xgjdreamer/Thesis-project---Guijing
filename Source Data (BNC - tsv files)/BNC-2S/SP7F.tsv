S0439	no
S0440	see you
S0439	cos you've be come up to see him for years why suddenly now
S0440	that's right
S0439	be it because he think like be
S0440	yeah i think
S0439	he's try to make it even or something
S0440	yeah i think i think there's a bite of
S0439	do he ever talk to her about the eight grand
S0440	no but that's gonna come up when we erm sort the the
S0439	yeah you need to sort it you can't
S0440	no that's yeah he's gonna he's gonna see the he's gonna change his will because he want to leave you lot five thousand pound each
S0439	yeah i know you say
S0440	won't let him because it mean there'll be no no money leave for her
S0439	what she's such a bitch it's his money she can't she have no influence over his will
S0440	i know she doesn't
S0439	if if he want to write a will where he leave all his money to charity she can do
S0440	she can do nothing about it
S0439	nothing about it anyway so he want to change it there'll be twenty thousand leave full stop okay
S0439	yeah
S0440	erm he want to change it and my view be what he should change it to be that you know you lot get a minimum of i think be that way oh god oh well it's take me anyway isn't it so
S0439	yeah
S0440	yeah erm you lot get a minimum of four thousand
S0439	yeah
S0440	pound each and if there's anything leave at the end of it yeah whatever but he want to leave a thousand pound to the witness as well
S0439	yeah of course yeah
S0440	but there isn't gonna
S0439	he do say that
S0440	yeah and he want to leave a thousand pound to alzheimer's now that'll take him to his twenty three grand
S0439	yeah
S0440	the what what he have leave that mean there's no money to pay for funerals or whatever now my view be it doesn't matter whether there's no money to pay for funerals because bollocks me he's
S0439	oh mum
S0440	oh god he's you know he's do enough hasn't he you know that's what i view he's do enough
S0439	yeah
S0440	erm throughout his life that to pay for a funeral he's only want he only want the cheapest coffin
S0439	yeah
S0440	he's gonna be cremate so he doesn't want an expensive coffin
S0439	whack him in a cardboard box
S0440	well that's right you know that's the new that's the new thing
S0439	yeah
S0440	be the cardboard the cardboard coffin and my view be that you don't want you know all we want be a car to take him to the funeral we don't need cars for us
S0439	no oh god
S0440	you know
S0439	not at all
S0440	that'll do so my my view be what we should do be just let him do what he want to but we
S0439	how much do he he have like a hundred thousand
S0440	yeah
S0439	at the moment or something
S0440	but what
S0439	oh he's yeah he's in the home isn't he
S0440	he's get that now he's yeah
S0439	yeah
S0440	so what i my view be be when we come to read the will i they'll say be there any other any other things leave and i'll say yes there's ten thousand pound which be pay into 's account a little while ago which hasn't yet be declare and she'll go what and i'll say yeah you know the the isa on the isa that be pay into your account
S0439	you need proof though you need proof of that
S0440	i've get proof of it
S0439	good
S0440	i've get proof of it
S0439	as long as you have
S0440	cos she's get she's get the payment into her account hasn't she
S0439	yeah but er no but as long no but you need that proof cos she can just destroy that
S0440	she can't destroy it because it's a bank transaction
S0439	okay
S0440	and she can't destroy that bank transaction so
S0439	well as long as you get
S0440	and i will just turn around and say you know
S0439	technically she'd have to prove that you she didn't have it didn't she
S0440	yeah she'd have to prove she didn't have it
S0439	yeah
S0440	but my view my view be that what she should do be erm i'll just say well i'll take four and a half thousand pound extra onto the
S0439	so have get
S0440	so there's no money leave what could be
S0439	do grandad not have his bank card then i think
S0440	no no
S0439	she throw it at him
S0440	she give now she give it to now she he he she's get it back
S0439	how do she get it back
S0440	i don't know but anyway she's get it back and have it when he when they go on holiday
S0439	this this situation be bollocks it's
S0440	i know it be and i
S0439	it's he but he's
S0440	but she bring him up some more money last weekend erm and
S0439	she's such a skank
S0440	i
S0439	uh
S0440	i know she be i i absolutely loathe her i really do

S0439	well yeah well cos they just well they shouldn't have sell their house to somebody who need a house in september
S0440	i know i know i'm just i i i'm
S0439	they've just shoot themselves in the foot haven't they
S0440	i'm completely and utterly gobsmacked i really be
S0439	i guess like you say they could rent they could live in nan's house and erm and come and stay with us
S0440	but i don't see why that that be even a a a a a that be a valid suggestion and nobody be put it on the table
S0439	well why don't you put it on the table
S0440	i'm go to
S0439	cos when's nan's kitchen be do okay end of august
S0440	well yeah end of august september but i mean
S0439	yeah
S0440	it doesn't matter be it they could be you know
S0439	yeah
S0440	the kitchen isn't gonna be a problem
S0439	yeah if nan come and live with you for or live with yeah
S0440	which she's gonna live with us when the kitchen's do anyway so
S0439	yeah she might as well stay for an extra month or so
S0440	she might as well stay there for
S0439	mightn't she
S0440	yeah exactly
S0439	but yeah but then dad say that be look at a house something forty thousand pound over her budget or something it just
S0440	that's a minimum of forty thousand pound over her budget
S0439	why would you do that to yourself
S0440	i do not know
S0439	why would you
S0440	i
S0439	put yourself in more debt
S0440	i don't know
S0439	that's a massive amount of debt
S0440	but they're say that they're gonna get erm a er
S0439	an endowment be they
S0440	an endowment
S0439	yeah
S0440	but i don't think they know how much they're gonna get on their endowment we be suppose to be get fifty thousand
S0439	what be an what be an endowment
S0440	well you pay a life insurance for over twenty five years or whatever and accord to how the stock exchange go you get an endowment at the end of it well we be calculate to get a twenty six thousand pound endowment at the end of ours we end up have to pay more towards it cos our endowment never materialise
S0439	so how much do you get
S0440	nothing
S0439	you get nothing from your endowment
S0440	nothing from our endowment so if be say oh we're gonna get a thirty thousand pound endowment next year she need to work out whether she be gonna get a thirty thousand pound endowment next year
S0439	yeah
S0440	because if not you know
S0439	cos like no offence but er how much they they sell theirs for two hundred and sixty thousand
S0440	yeah
S0439	like i do understand that house house price be increase and they be go up to like between three hundred and four hundred thousand pound but if they can't afford it don't look in that price bracket
S0440	they couldn't afford it but they need a mortgage
S0439	yeah
S0440	and they don't wanna take out a mortgage but my view be if you don't take
S0439	do they not have a mortage then
S0440	well they
S0439	have they pay off their house
S0440	their mortgage finish next year
S0439	oh i see okay so they've only it's only get a pathetic amount leave on their mortgage
S0440	yeah they haven't get very much leave on their mortgage but the fact be that you know they've just get to be sensible about it and you've get to actually sit there and work out how much it's gonna cost because yes it will actually eat up all the profit that you've all the money that you've make if you rent it for a thousand pound a month
S0439	yeah of course they just they've just rush into it like don't get me wrong i know it's sad that have cancer but
S0440	yeah
S0439	she's make this massive decision base on the fact that she want something to look forward to
S0440	yeah
S0439	but now she's become more stress than
S0440	yeah
S0439	it's worth
S0440	yeah
S0439	like it's ridiculous and they wouldn't have to take out a very big mortgage they what a forty if they take out a fifty grand mortgage
S0440	well no they've get whatever mortgage they've get now they'd have to add another what bite onto it
S0439	well they can't if they've only get one year leave on their mortgage they can't have much to pay off
S0440	thank you
S0439	yeah they can't have much leave to pay off but
S0440	mm
S0439	just seem so stupid borrow forty thousand pound for now when it's in save when it's in really good save
S0440	i know
S0439	and then they're gonna lose money because they're nan will have to pay a fine to take it out
S0440	oh well
S0439	why do we live with why be relatives such like bloody morons
S0440	i know we have
S0439	have we
