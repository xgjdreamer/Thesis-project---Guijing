S0238	no these be the ones that i buy do i tell you where the place where i stay
S0243	you say it be somewhere i couldn't remember where
S0238	down erm that she make pottery
S0243	heavy very nice
S0238	i'm not thrill with the colour but it's a lovely shape to hold very satisfy and a decent size of handle that you can put your hand through
S0243	yes
S0238	erm so i buy four and what do you think of the coffee because that's get almond milk in cos i
S0243	it's strong for me
S0238	oh do you want some more hot water some more milk or
S0243	no leave it i'll i'll drink it but it er it be too strong really
S0238	that be a silly thing well if it's too strong i can add a bite there's still a bite of space in the mug mind you that would make it heavier
S0243	oh you
S0238	i really mean what do you think of flavour can you taste that it's not milk milk
S0243	i don't think so
S0238	i think that i've try both almond milk and soya milk erm the soya milk be slightly higher fat it mean it's still it's comparable to semi skim and the almond milk be actually slightly less erm so i think it do taste a little bite richer but there's not a lot in it erm
S0243	i wouldn't have know it be anything different
S0238	no i mean there's a range of when you go there's a different ones some of them have get flavour in and god know what erm and some of them be sweeten well to me that turn them into then not then a milk substitute there's
S0243	mm i agree
S0238	they're something different erm so i just go for the original you know
S0243	although there be sugar in milk it's lacrose isn't it
S0238	yes but
S0243	i remember at school be tell there be sugar in er there be sweetness in milk
S0238	mm
S0243	and think mm sort of thing and they give us a glass of water and a glass of milk and if you compare the water with the milk yes it be sweet
S0238	mm
S0243	you could tell
S0238	well isn't it isn't that what the problem be that you're that you can be lactose intolerant
S0243	i suppose
S0238	erm
S0243	do i didn't say lactose what do i say
S0238	you say lacrose and i think that's
S0243	i be gonna say that be wrong
S0238	yeah and and i listen to it and think
S0243	no
S0238	no it it be
S0243	you should've say
S0238	yeah well erm but
S0243	yeah i like this beaker to hold
S0238	yes erm cos you get the the chunkiness of of a a bowl if you like a breakfast cup
S0243	yes
S0238	without it be so wide and difficult to to hold
S0243	mm
S0238	yeah
S0243	well erm when leave her mum and she come down to my house and bring me a beaker and it be these colour and it be that lovely curve shape it didn't have a sort of stand on the bottom
S0238	mm
S0243	and eventually it get break and i try all over to get one like it cos i'd really like it
S0238	yes
S0243	the hold of it and everything but i never find one
S0238	well if you see together the four that i buy you would you'd know that they be hand throw these two be pretty similar in shape and everything but the the other two be very they be all slightly different height and and
S0243	mm
S0238	you know erm and i hadn't really realise that that's inevitable with hand throw pot isn't it
S0243	i suppose it be
S0238	erm she'd get a range and i i get the four that seem most similar but it be kind of two pair rather than a four if you see what i mean
S0243	mm well i didn't think i'd be sit here in this sunshine
S0238	no
S0243	this morning
S0238	well i'm relieve it's give me that's those be the sheet that be on the bed when be here which be over a week ago
S0243	mm
S0238	and it's the first opportunity i've have to erm to wash them i do one lot of wash you know just of clothe and hang them out and basically they be as wet when i bring them in
S0243	mm
S0238	as they have be when i put them out it be just such a damp grey day
S0243	mm
S0238	erm i do it and have to dry them inside and of course at this time of year they don't dry inside very quickly
S0243	we've have perhaps a couple of hours of slightly sunnier than all the gloom
S0238	yeah
S0243	each afternoon cos when come he be sweat you know with just do things
S0238	well it hasn't necessarily be cold
S0243	no
S0238	but
S0243	but i've have the fire on each year in
S0238	if oh yeah but if it's grey and damp that doesn't necessarily help do it
S0243	no
S0238	there's one of those spider's there's a spider's web there i don't know whether you can see it
S0243	what be i look at the glass
S0238	just there through the glass a spider's web
S0243	yes
S0238	yes er
S0238	there be one
S0243	there's load of spiders at the moment
S0238	yes it must be that time of year there be one in the the big shed when i walk in the other day right across the middle of the shed and i hadn't see it and i walk straight into it
S0243	yeah
S0238	and it actually end up i have to come back and clean my glass cos they end up with the parallel line of the of the cobweb right across one lens it be really weird but i be very happy that i didn't end up with the spider go down my neck cos it be a large one
S0243	well as i go into the greenhouse each each day i do that as go through the doorway
S0243	and if you go between the greenhouse and 's hedge you're do this
S0238	yes yes well i've i get very large ones in the house sometimes sort of and they stand out particularly on the din room carpet of course erm but well i mean they don't bother me particularly but it it be annoy to walk into the the cobwebs they seem to do that round all my doors they do it at the front door as well
S0243	mm i've have one or two pretty big ones in the bath which tend to rescue with a glass and piece of card
S0243	well i don't want just to wash em down the bath it isn't fair
S0238	well yeah but there be millions of spiders in we
S0243	they're suppose to bring good luck aren't they spiders
S0238	well if you believe in things like that
S0243	mm
S0238	mm
S0243	well i'd rather believe in it than not
S0243	oh i've try to get up that white buddleia
S0238	right
S0243	i trim it back to about a foot and i've dig and dig and dig and i've get it clear around the three side but one root be go right back i think it might even go under the wall and into the hut
S0238	right
S0243	so i'll get to finish off dig it up
S0238	okay fair enough that mean it's go to be difficult to plant though doesn't it
S0243	well i think you can root trim
S0238	mm you could do that before you dig it up then couldn't you
S0243	well i think about that as well but i i'd wait and see what he do
S0238	yes erm
S0243	he's
S0238	well i'll hold off on what i be think see as it be white and i end up you know i be suppose to have blue one pink and one white
S0243	oh yes
S0238	and i didn't i end up with two purple and one white and i don't know whether the purple ones be mean to be blue or pink because well blue or red they didn't look quite like either of the of the ones
S0243	mm
S0238	in the er catalogue anyway i end up with the two purple ones together erm i want to grow up a bite more a barrier because where that tree be cut down
S0243	mm
S0238	there's now a space through to next door now you can't see it when you're sit here because of that bush but if you're further down you can or even
S0243	mm
S0238	when i'm up on the deck i can i can if he's potter around in the in the greenhouse i can see him
S0243	mm
S0238	i mean it's not exactly hugely intrusive but the idea be to grow the buddleias erm
S0243	mm
S0238	in that space erm and i think i'd put the white one between the two purple ones well at the moment they're still in pot and i won't plant them out until i've get yours
S0243	well spend his couple of hours last week get the raspberries clean up and clear er i'd spend a good three quarter of an hour for about three days run get rid of all the stuff they be not take care of at all last year i always use to weed them and everything and i just didn't do anything and i don't think i have more than six raspberries anyway
S0243	but you can't blame em but what they've get and it's happen over the last about three years but this year be worse be bindweed and it's around all the raspberries or it might be that way i don't know tell you erm and as he be say if you leave as much as that in the grind it will sprout so i might be stick with bindweed forever more but if i can do something about it in the spring so it doesn't get a a big hold
S0238	yes
S0243	as it's do
S0238	yeah
S0243	we'll see but he's he's spend a lot of time there and i've get now well he finish get the last apples off er cos he be faffing around by the tree so those be all on the bedroom floor and i have have i do go in about every two or three days and pick out anything that look as though it's go bad and chuck it
S0238	mm
S0243	but have have two lot i take some and fortunately have be blackberry so they have blackberry and apple pie they be very
S0238	mm
S0243	please to see them have have some have have some 's have some so oh and when she come so i'll
S0238	so you've have a good crop
S0243	well yes because
S0238	cos i think you have a good crop last year
S0243	i be gonna say last year it be embarrass
S0238	yes so i wouldn't have expect you to have have a lot this year mm
S0243	oh you've have some of course
S0238	mm yeah well i will have some more erm you could have bring them actually i i've i've get a drawer in the kitchen that doesn't normally have anything in
S0243	mm
S0238	that i've line with newspaper and i can i can put the space to put them in slightly separate from each other erm
S0243	right yeah say she wrap each one in newspaper
S0238	well we i remember do that at at
S0243	i use to do it
S0238	at grandma's house
S0243	oh
S0238	and put them in the back bedroom do you not remember that apples and pears
S0243	well i must have do it and and everything
S0238	when i be a kid i can i remember do that
S0243	we be certainly do it at our house when we'd apples there
S0238	well i er i use to do that with my apple tree actually when i think about it it depend how many you've get i suppose
S0243	yeah
S0238	as to whether it's worth it erm and you can of course do stew apple and freeze it
S0243	yes i've do that i've get a big bag full of that and i make three apple pies in erm those little foil things cos one of those be big enough for two
S0238	mm
S0243	in fact a bite too big
S0238	well again you can freeze apple pies can't you
S0243	mm that's where they be
S0243	in fact i do one apple and blackcurrant which just
S0238	wow
S0243	make it a big different
S0238	there's two butterfly have a right dance just there i don't know it's well surely the wrong time of year for them to be mat but they be er one of them's there but there be there be a pair sort of fly together you know
S0243	oh well perhaps they're befuddle by the weather
S0238	i'm glad there's a bite of a breeze as well as the sun because well firstly that'll help my wash dry but also i want to cut my lawn it's need do for a while and when it's wet it's it's not particularly nice and also i've have other things that also need do in the garden shall i show you my latest project er i can't take you down the garden
S0243	no
S0238	to show you but i've get some photos erm this be you know i i think i probably say i get to er help me sort the where the compost bin be
S0243	yes
S0238	erm so i've be build a compost heap as it be build you know do it with the bricks er and that be well i don't know what you can see for that towel but but you know where those bush grow out sort of
S0243	mm
S0238	behind that
S0243	right
S0238	the garden do actually seem to curve slightly to the leave so you really can't see it from here but obviously that's be oh take me time and every i've it's take me three go probably five to five and a half hours altogether spread out over three go cos it do my back in and every each of those three time i've carefully check the weather forecast and see it wasn't suppose to rain today or first thing the next day and every single flip time it's rain earlier than it have be forecast to do i mean the last time it actually i mix the cement and it start drizzle
S0243	mm
S0238	have be nice and sunny when i start off so i just have to carry on i think i've actually get them in here
S0243	i think we're gonna end up with a darker cloudier before so long it's
S0238	mm
S0243	grey over but i certainly think your wash will be dry
S0238	okay oh it's just it's still come on that's it can you see
S0243	oh excite
S0243	yes i can see
S0238	so that bite i build there and that's the the compost bin you see that and i
S0243	yeah
S0238	and i put all the compost into those bag and then it's that's that's compost and that's compost as it where
S0238	oh erm so and i'm please with that
S0243	yes
S0238	i mean okay it's very rough brickwork
S0243	well that doesn't matter do it
S0238	but as long as it stand up
S0243	and it do the job
S0238	and it doesn't even need to be able to stand up you know amazingly mm oh what's that over there cos it hasn't get a lot of pressure on it or anything that be the biggest i could manage and i just think if it's open at the front i'll be able to
S0243	yes
S0238	put a spade in which be a lot more convenient than the the compost bin erm
S0243	yeah you don't stop do you
S0238	well i mean the other thing i as i say i get to do a few job erm
S0243	what sort of age be he
S0238	sixty nine
S0243	oh
S0238	erm i seem to have miss a year somewhere cos i he his birthday be in august and i think that be his sixty eighth but no so erm but i mean he's do this train for a half marathon so he he contact me before he come would it be okay if he use my treadmill and he be out on the patio do his exercise at half past six erm and then i didn't he didn't do that much on the treadmill to be honest i think he only do about three kilometres which isn't very much
S0243	we have a letter i should think about three weeks ago cos i'd forget about it erm to say our electricity's go off in the morning
S0238	oh
S0243	they're do some cable work er where there be cable i don't know i don't know what it's all about it will be off for a short time it say it be very badly write i end up do teacher's corrections to it
S0243	i can't bear it i have to
S0238	yeah
S0243	and erm oh er you know if you've get computers have em all switch off and this that and the other and it be for the twenty second of september which be tomorrow
S0238	mm
S0243	but as i say this come at least three weeks ago and i'd completely forget about it whether it will matter or not i don't know because i haven't anything fancy switch on it mention burglar alarm and seem to think if it's all off when they switch it on again our alarm might go off in other word be at home
S0238	oh right
S0243	but
S0238	i wouldn't have think i mean i certainly
S0243	they ought to have remind us
S0238	yes if they tell you that early i if i have occasionally i don't know about at this house actually but at the other house more than once there must have be some sort of power cut
S0243	yeah
S0238	because you notice that some things be flash or whatever
S0243	yeah
S0238	you know erm and burglar alarm be never seem to be affect at all i would just have think that a modern burglar alarm be design so that it it could ride out things like that because it do happen
S0243	mind you ours isn't all that modern you see it'll be
S0238	no but mine at the other house wasn't
S0243	no
S0238	i mean it might have be newer than yours but i when you when you have the new
S0243	double glaze
S0238	no no thing put on on that those be not the button that you originally have be they
S0243	probably not
S0238	so keypad that's the word i'm look when you have that be it a whole new burglar alarm or do you just have a new keypad put there
S0243	i think it be just a new keypad cos do it with your dad
S0238	mm
S0243	in the first place
S0238	right
S0243	and we never have any deeper work do in other word
S0238	mm
S0243	climb in the loft or anything so it must just have be a new keypad and i don't know who do it and i don't know why so we shall see i mean as er as we be say all we need to do be be punch if it go off punch the number in
S0238	mm
S0243	but erm i mention it to and she didn't know anything about it so i say well it must just be our side of the road and we be wonder if it's something to do with 's
S0238	well it could be couldn't it
S0243	yes
S0238	if they're do all that er
S0243	yeah
S0238	build work
S0243	i haven't see to ask whether they're erm
S0238	mm
S0243	involve or not but the other day they have what i'd call a rubber hose probably that much diameter run from the back of 's right up the drive across the little road and onto the island and the end of it just prop into one of those tree where kid climb
S0238	mm
S0243	and where it cross the road there be a concrete slab weight it down so that nobody trip or whatever
S0238	mm
S0243	and we can't imagine what that be
S0238	mm
S0243	there be nothing drain from it there be no water come out
S0238	oh that's weird
S0243	well i mean it couldn't be gas and it couldn't be electricity so goodness know what they're do
S0238	oh that be i'm not sure what something come some sort of do you see
S0243	no
S0238	go to my bird feeder and then it fly off into that tree
S0243	no
S0238	cos i haven't see anything at the bird feeder for at least a week and i find that happen last year at this sort of time i'd have quite a lot of activity over the summer and then not in the autumn and i don't know where they go and what they're do and whether it's because you you actually get different bird in summer and winter and this be the changeover period which it be
S0243	mm mm
S0238	erm but i don't know about you see i would i would have assume that with tits and things that it be the it be the same bird but i'm not sure that it be necessarily because i've be tell that robins yes he be there that robins for example if you've get a robin in your garden in winter and in summer it's not necessarily the same robin they that even they migrate
S0243	they're come
S0238	yes these be the grey tits hello darlings all look very handsome that be a i mean i know there be adults come before but also there be a lot of youngsters and i think that could be the youngsters that now have be in full adult plumage
S0243	mm
S0238	because that all three that land then look to be adults to me and i don't think there be three
S0243	well they're quite sizeable
S0238	it's not the size it's the it i mean they the they be they be the same sort of size it's just the mark
S0243	when i be down with the raspberries obviously i i take that little erm seat that i sit on to weed and so on and i be quite happy down there by myself bite of birdsong around and suddenly there be a a movement and it be a robin and it come and it come round the other side of me and it come down there and it look at me and i i think he must have think i be gonna dig a wormhole for him
S0243	erm but it didn't go away particularly mind you i didn't make any big movements and it's do it about three or four different days
S0238	oh good
S0243	so
S0238	you see the robin that come here be i think robins be like that be quite confide be the word that birdwatchers seem to use
S0243	oh
S0238	but the robin that come here isn't like that it's very shy the tits be much less nervy than the robin
S0243	mm well i haven't see him i mean occasionally i've see a robin in the garden but this be sort of persistent
S0238	mm yeah but the jay hasn't be for quite a while so
S0243	no i haven't see the jay for a while and we we
S0238	i saw it in the tree the other day but it hasn't be to the feeder that i think it's probably move on you know
S0243	mm
S0238	the things like that do seem to go in in phase erm
S0243	and i've not hear a woodpecker this year i don't think
S0238	no
S0243	and we always have do
S0238	and i well i wasn't hear it last year so much as it come to the feeder quite a lot and this year that's why i've have those peanuts out even though the squirrel come but no not a sign which be a shame
S0243	i'm feel something yes
S0238	and you're finish and you turn it
S0243	oh it's there
S0238	and look on the if you don't turn it and look on the bottom unless you've finish
S0238	it say
S0243	you might
S0238	it say on the bottom and that be her name
S0243	oh
S0238	which i think be odd because she wasn't that old i mean she wasn't young but to me be
S0243	s be our 's lot
S0238	yes be at least your generation if not older whereas she clearly wasn't
S0243	older i hadn't any s at school
S0238	right yeah no go back to job that sort of set up erm you know the compost bin be one thing erm but the other another thing that i've be work on i've i've paint the
S0243	right
S0238	front room windowsill it's
S0243	oh
S0238	it's doesn't it look a lot better because it's white but it end up with a lot of quite deep groove in it and i sand it and what it really need be plan well i haven't really get a plane so i didn't
S0243	mm
S0238	so it still look quite sort of scratch but most of it you don't really see it because of the blind and the fact that it's now white instead of a nasty tacky brown varnish stuff not
S0243	mm
S0238	not brown varnish veneer erm
S0243	oh mm
S0238	do look definitely better so i'm i'm leave it like that for now
S0243	so have you much more to do with your house
S0238	well there's the upstairs room to do which i i'm plan to do probably at christmas erm and yes i mean to talk to you about the bottom terrace of the orchard need to be soil so that i can plant vegetables and things and i be an idiot to plant that grass there at all so
S0243	oh
S0238	in other word the work that do have kind of be waste because i plant grass and now i want to dig it all up again
S0243	mm
S0238	i don't think that i'm go to be able to do that myself and the one of the reason be that i can't get the big powerful strimmer to start when be here after a lot of effort he manage to get it go and i do some strimming but you do one lot and then you need to do another you know i need i need to get it right down to as close to the grind as possible and i didn't do that and i try to start it again and i just i can't do it it for a start it really need two people it jump about like fury when you when you pull the you know it's one of these
S0243	mm
S0238	it's a it's a petrol drive thing and you need to pull a string to spark it erm and even if you've get one foot on it it's a lot easier if someone's also hold it
S0243	mm
S0238	but also you need to do it a few time with the throttle open and that's this it you basically need three arm
S0243	oh right
S0238	and a very long body you know or very long arm or something it's just a stupid design erm the other one i can start because it's not so stupidly design but that one erm and i actually i couldn't pull the string out of the it's full length it be stick for me
S0243	mm
S0238	which mean obviously it wasn't gonna spark erm so i be i mean it's i don't know how many hours work it would be to clear it it's hard to tell erm but i be wonder about ask to do it because i really think that it's beyond me even if i could get the what i want to do be try and get the strimmer work strim it down to stubble and start dig it up with the fork and see er how much it be do my back in and how much i could do at a time and whether i think i could manage it but if i can't do the strimming then i can't do the the
S0243	mm
S0238	the four kilo though
S0243	mm
S0238	because
S0243	so er how much would you want him
S0238	well i need him to come and look at it and tell me what he think really
S0243	mm
S0238	erm it's hard for me to judge because it would take me weeks and weeks because i would i know how long it take me to do that front garden dig it all up
S0243	mm
S0238	i could only do half an hour at a time and then my back be seize up
S0243	mm
S0238	erm and i can't get a lot do in half an hour he could probably do more than me in half an hour anyway
S0243	mm
S0238	but i don't know so
S0243	well he's go away at the end of this month i think only to scotland or wales or something like that
S0238	well i mean it's not urgent but it need do this autumn
S0243	well
S0238	so that i can
S0243	i'll certainly ask him but i don't know how much time
S0238	no
S0243	he's prepare to spend on things cos i don't know who else he go to of course
S0238	well it's not go to be an ongoing it's a sort of one off job get it clear that i've plant it with this meadow grass and i shouldn't have do i should have leave it clear so it need get back to soil again
S0243	mm
S0238	and then i would have to keep it weed free
S0243	yeah
S0238	well there's no point in do it too soon because the grass be still grow a bite
S0243	mm
S0238	but so it it's an autumn job erm i've get another gooseberry bush on order
S0243	right
S0238	to replace that one that die so it need do before that would come erm but anything that's
S0243	i'm please with that rhododendron you find
S0238	oh good
S0243	it er it look a really good bush so we use to have i'm keep the receipt because they will replace things well like
S0238	mm well i mean it wasn't exactly cheap be it but it
S0243	no
S0238	i find that two or three time i've at garden centre i've look and think oh yes that look like a good bush and then back off when i realise how much
S0243	yes
S0238	things like that be
S0243	well i wasn't expect to pay that i think i'd think probably thirteen or fourteen pound but i've think about a rhododendron down there for a long time
S0238	mm
S0243	so i think right i'll have one
S0243	lovely sunshine's go
S0238	well the amount of trouble once they're in you just leave them
S0243	well yes and it's exactly i mean deliberately where i can see it from the kitchen
S0238	mm
S0243	which be be what i want because there's a fuchsia there that hasn't really grow much at all and when i think about fuchsias there isn't a right lot of colour for the size of the bush
S0238	i think that depend on the fuchsia well i go walk in on thursday and one of the garden that i go past have well a range of things along er they have a sort of flowerbed by the by the edge of the garden as it be and it have several different small fuchsias which be in full bloom
S0243	mm
S0238	and they be they be they be sort of this size a mass of bloom and not as much erm
S0243	mm mm
S0238	actual foliage now it may be that when they get bigger that happen less i think the one that i have at the other house be pretty good value but this one here
S0243	yeah that be when you come up the step weren't it
S0238	yes but this one here be as you're say it's a lot of of foliage and not very much blossom
S0243	yeah
S0238	erm i'm just kind of wait for the blossom to die down a bite more and then i'm go to cut it down completely and put something else there because it it also just grow so much in a season that i'm constantly have to cut it back to able to use the path which be silly
S0243	mm oh i've have the notice about the brown bin
S0238	oh right so you be get them
S0243	so i've an october collection of green bag
S0238	mm
S0243	and then that's it till something like april fourth when it will be bin it you know you have to ring up to order it
S0238	mm
S0243	which i think be a bite odd and then i think well there must be a lot of people who've have green bag who've never ever use em
S0238	mm
S0243	so same with brown bin i suppose
S0238	well i don't think that and i can't remember what the son's call have get a brown bin when i've be put mine out there hasn't be one go out there
S0243	oh
S0238	and and they certainly put other things out
S0243	but you ring up to order it
S0238	oh yeah
S0243	mm
S0238	so but i mean obviously they've get quite a big garden so i don't know why they've make that choice
S0243	mm i can't say i'm thrill about this brown bin i just cannot see it hold as much as i need it to hold when the two hedge be cut
S0238	yes well i mean it say
S0243	er
S0238	something like it hold the equivalent of three to five
S0243	yes
S0238	green bag well for a start there's a big difference between three and five and secondly no way do it hold five green bag worth that's just ridiculous
S0243	mm
S0238	erm and anything that's a bite of an awkward shape quite often would go into those green bag because they're quite wide
S0243	yes
S0238	whereas it won't into the bin so you're have to spend more time cut things down to fit i'm still use the green bag as well
S0243	well i'm keep them at the moment to see how it all go
S0238	yes well i've exactly i mean i have five or six er and i'm keep those
S0243	i think i have five now
S0238	and
S0243	i think i once have seven
S0238	i'm have to go to the tip as well although to be fair i miss the september brown bag brown bin collection because that be when i be away
S0243	mm
S0238	erm but yeah no it it's it what annoy me when they send out the information with things out be they they try to present it as if it's better for you if they be just honest
S0243	yes
S0238	and say we're sorry darlings but it's a lot easier for our bin men
S0243	yes
S0238	then fair enough because it be erm but you know they're pretend that it's in some way more convenient for us which be clearly isn't and if you read the rest of the thing
S0243	it go cold
S0238	it's a bite cooler now the sun's go hasn't it
S0243	mm
S0238	erm you know if you read the rest of the thing which
S0243	it's blow more
S0238	which be clearly sort of address possible complaints and and query and so on
S0243	mm
S0238	it's obvious that a lot of people's immediate reaction be oh no that's not very good for me
S0243	mm well it just depend how much garden you've get really
S0238	yes erm well i suppose they must have have some idea of how many green bag
S0243	mm
S0238	people average if you see what i mean
S0243	mm and they're very generously let us keep our green bag
S0238	mm
S0243	mind you i've have two fairly new ones i i mean a year older more than that with their handle sort of in the middle of the side rather than on top and they've be very difficult to carry
S0238	oh oh no i haven't get any like that but erm i mean a couple of mine be bite sort of tear and batter
S0243	yeah
S0238	but they're still worth keep it depend what you put in them anyway doesn't it
S0243	mm
S0238	if the if it's mostly branch that's fine if it's small things they might fall through the hole but er
S0243	mm well i've cut my own buddleia back as well because that's er finish i don't think there's anything else that want cut back those bush where the leave come red when they're new
S0238	mm
S0243	erm say i'll cut that back a bite but he's a bite one for shape it all beautifully
S0238	mm
S0243	and i like a natural shape
S0238	yeah well i i'm go to have to buy a hedge trimmer because
S0243	i've get one you could have it because he use his own it he he doesn't use mine
S0238	yours be have get a cable though
S0243	mm
S0238	i mean actually i might take you up on that and and borrow it if you like this season
S0243	well you can try it yeah
S0238	i mean i've get an well i've get your extension cable but i have actually get erm not one on a i've get yours that's on a drum and i've get another one that that isn't
S0243	oh you've get that have you
S0238	er yes
S0243	not that i've be look for it i'd forget about it
S0238	well again i think that you say that bring his own stuff
S0243	he do
S0238	and therefore you
S0243	yeah
S0238	didn't really need it erm and obviously i need that for mow the lawn and and things and and erm i like that better than the one that i inherit which be a lighter sort of thing erm so i could see how that go i just think that with a garden this size it's more convenient to have a petrol drive thing but as on the other hand as say i'm find it so difficult to start petrol drive things that maybe that's not the best the hedge
S0243	yeah
S0238	i inherit a hedge trimmer and it have be leave with petrol in it over winter which you're not suppose to do and that have perish something inside and try to get it fix and it be some little he replace the spark plug and then there be some little sort of tube thing and he buy some and and fiddle about and he's spend so long on it erm that i say apart from anything else if i'm pay him and hourly rate er it's cheaper to buy a new hedge trimmer
S0238	and he and he be just determine to sort it but he never do of course and it and it's still up there unfinished and so unsorted and i suspect it never will even
S0243	mm
S0238	even if i take it in to be repair i just think it's probably beyond repair erm and you pay so much for a professional to do that sort of thing i might as well buy a new one but i've get i mean that thing there need trim erm that green thing in by the pond
S0243	mm
S0238	erm but now in the front garden there's another green thing like that that grow over where you walk up the path
S0243	mm
S0238	that i haven't do anything to for quite a while that be get a bite straggly and need sort erm the hebes need a bite of trim and as i say i want to cut that fuchsia down if i start do all that with my hand clippers it really make my hand shake i find
S0243	mm
S0238	erm and there's quite possibly things down the garden as well i'm not very sure so i think at some point i will come over and borrow that
S0243	mm
S0238	and see how it go but it may just be too awkward to use a er an electric one in this garden
S0243	it could be yes
S0238	i mean i do borrow it for that holly hedge at the other house
S0243	oh do you
S0238	mm erm
S0243	well you may as well give it a try
S0238	mm so i certainly know i can i mean it's be say she be hop would come back er in time to to erm cut down their hedge you know they've get this well allotment you would call it if it be in england in german it be call a garden but in germany it's much more than allotment you know it's get a hut in it that's swish enough to it's get run water and and you could sleep there
S0243	mm
S0238	for heaven's sake you know when say hut i don't just mean a shed
S0243	and be it by the house
S0238	no no no i mean it's where there be others but there's
S0243	right
S0238	be germany there's all sort of rule and a certain percent of it percentage of it have to be give up to produce
S0243	oh
S0238	which i think be good and all sort of things but they come round and inspect it from time to time and and she be say they're go to get into trouble cos their hedge be too high and she couldn't use the hedge trimmer so she be hop would get back in time to do it
S0243	be she the same sort of age as him
S0238	she's a few years younger erm i would say
S0243	i'd imagine her your age i mean
S0238	no she's
S0243	i must have see her
S0238	erm she's more than ten years older than me but not a lot more so i would say she's probably about sixty three or four now
S0243	mm well didn't you go for something like a special birthday
S0238	that that be her fiftieth though that's quite a long time ago
S0243	fiftieth good heavens
S0238	yeah erm and that be the same year that i go to so it must have be two thousand when we think about it
S0243	mm
S0238	so she must be sixty four
S0243	mm
S0238	cos her birthday's at the end of august
S0243	yep
S0238	erm yes she have a bite do well she she do have a do for her sixtieth erm but where they be before of course they have a big they have a detach house with quite a big garden and they rent a marquee and put that up
S0243	mm
S0238	erm and invite all the
S0243	and do you go
S0238	all the neighbourhood and everything no only for the fiftieth yes
S0243	oh
S0238	but for the sixtieth obviously they're they're now in a flat so they couldn't do that
S0243	mm
S0238	and i think they rent the village hall which be probably if it's attach to the church it'll be kind of next door cos the church be just over the wall stroke hedge from where they live because sometimes when i've be skyping the flip bell's be ring and he's have to shut the window cos we couldn't hear it other
S0243	mm i think the sun might be come back it's down there
S0238	well yes i can there's a you can see a bite there but there's quite a lot of cloud up there it's er it's not as nice a day as i think it be go to be however
S0243	mm
S0238	as i say i
S0243	do you iron those sheet
S0238	no
S0243	well i don't i just wonder if er if you have to depend quite what they're make of
S0238	they're just cotton but i need to buy a fit cotton sheet i don't know why i haven't get one because i use to have flannelette sheet on in the winter and cotton ones on in the summer
S0243	mm
S0238	and then i stop bother with the cotton ones because actually even in the summer it's not particularly warm in this country
S0243	no
S0238	erm and i just like the feel of flannelette but i would've have at least one fit bottom sheet i mean i would have have two now i've a vague recollection of one tear and i don't quite know how i i i never quite know how it have tear whether it be in the wash machine and if so on what or or you know but
S0243	bite unusual that
S0238	yeah but as i say i would have have two because i'd have be alternate so i don't know but
S0243	mm
S0238	the last time stay here i realise i didn't have one erm and 's come for a night in december
S0243	oh
S0238	erm she's do what she do last time which be come over
S0243	have she be here
S0238	no she's see photos but she come well in the spring sometime i can't quite remember when and do you remember i go over to manchester airport and meet her in a café at the airport
S0243	oh yes
S0238	at the airport sort of thing
S0243	yes
S0238	because she be she's get a great aunt who live well west of the airport rather than east of so she be go there for lunch which be why i meet her for morning coffee er but this time she's go to visit the great aunt and then come over here for a night and then go down south to her sister erm because she's basically do her christmas visit at the begin of december because they be house sit for a friend in italy for two months from something like the nineteenth of december to some time in february
S0243	great
S0238	very nice in umbria erm cos they've actually invite me to go over in my christmas holiday their friend who normally spend christmas with them be go er and they say there's enough space in this house for me to be there at the same time or after her cos
S0243	mm
S0238	the last time i go which be at least two christmases ago if not three it i go when leave if you see what i mean
S0243	mm
S0238	because they've only get one spare room with
S0243	you know
S0238	no i've never meet her because
S0243	oh
S0238	we we've always sort of do this in and out thing you know
S0243	yeah
S0238	because well at their flat they they've basically get a spare bedroom i mean they've get they've each get a study in theory it's a four bedroomed flat
S0243	mm
S0238	but that's what they be look for because they'll each like to have a study so i suppose they could put up a camp bed in one of the study
S0243	mm
S0238	erm but so no so i don't think i've ever meet her erm
S0243	so be you think you'll go
S0238	well my first think be it would make sense to go she's go out pretty much the day after they arrive i think about something like the twentieth of december and stay till something like the second of january that's what say and i be think if i go sometime between christmas and new year and stay a bite longer than her i we could overlap and then you know then they're not then they haven't get the whole of the first fortnight that they're in their new place with visitors i think that's a bite much really
S0243	mm
S0238	erm but then i realise the second of january be when i'm go to see this consultant
S0243	oh
S0238	so that doesn't really fit and at the moment unless i can get my stomach under control it's not really very comfortable i wouldn't be very comfortable be in somebody else's house
S0243	mm
S0238	it's so bad
S0243	i'm surprise that coffee doesn't upset your stomach
S0238	well i don't i it do if i have more in an afternoon that's why i don't
S0243	mm cos it's quite fierce
S0243	yes erm but so i just don't know we'll oh i sort of leave it as well the other thing be he say i could fly to rome but perugia be nearer only of course that's a small airport and there be flight from stansted well i don't want the you know ryanair of something i don't want to drive down to stansted in order to fly to perugia but otherwise he would drive to rome to pick me up and it's a something like a hundred and fifty kilometres well i don't really want to land him with do that now so in er i didn't say much but at the time i be think oh that's make me feel awkward
S0243	mm
S0238	and i look and there really weren't any flight to perugia from a from anywhere reasonable up here erm cos i be hop that there would be from erm and then i could do i could go from leeds bradford you know
S0243	mm
S0238	in a double thingy but
S0243	well the thing be you will be drive in the worst of our weather to get to an airport here
S0238	yes so i don't know i want to go from anywhere but leeds
S0243	there be quite a lot of flight cancel this last week because of fog in the south
S0238	mm yeah but er
S0243	mm lose my ring on the
S0238	i mean when i go to rome i think there be it there be a jet two flight from direct from leeds to rome which would be the best option but i try to check that and they weren't come up so i don't really know about that so that's all a bite in the air
S0243	mm
S0238	what would be fantastic would be if this consultant do do a friday afternoon and i could get in to see her sooner than that
S0243	be there be that on the card
S0238	well i didn't i say that her secretary say she would get back to me if
S0243	oh yes
S0238	i even wonder if it would be worth in another week or so ring up the i've think i've still get the secretary's number somewhere a direct line
S0243	yes i think it would be
S0238	and say have that rota be sort out yet and so on because
S0243	cos you're make a just a polite query aren't you
S0238	well you see use to do that she use to ring up and natter and she do get things do and sometimes she get things sort that should have be sort but wouldn't have be if you know
S0243	mm
S0238	somebody should have let somebody know something or a note
S0243	mm
S0238	should have be send on and that sort of thing erm so yes i think i will be i'll i'll i will give it a week or two because actually that secretary do respond she if you remember erm she be away when i first ring up and somebody take the call and leave her a note and she do get back to me
S0243	oh
S0238	so she obviously be fairly efficient
S0243	mm
S0238	but
S0243	yeah so what's for the rest of the day then
S0238	well as be say i want to mow the lawn this afternoon erm and i think that that those orange roses have pretty much finish and i'm go to cut them back a bite because one of them have grow very tall erm and nearly blow over in in
S0243	mm
S0238	the strong wind so mm
S0243	well i look out of the window as i pull the curtain back each morning and see which of my roses have get a flower bud on that might come out
S0238	mm those little white ones look as if they have still get er bud on actually
S0243	yes
S0238	i might have another bloom of those
S0243	i've a pink one that with a sort of open rise that er it i think it be buy as grind cover
S0238	mm
S0243	and that's do extremely well this year but it need to spread a bite
S0238	mm
S0243	it's get a fair space around it i know what i be go to say to you i be talk to about this buddleia that you know you're go to take
S0238	mm
S0243	and she say er oh i've never see a white buddleia
S0238	oh
S0243	er but i've get an orange one
S0238	good heavens
S0243	mm
S0238	but you see that one of mine be suppose to be orangey yellow that's actually turn out white
S0243	well i've never see that
S0238	no
S0243	anywhere
S0238	well it be it it didn't say buddleia it be it have a name
S0243	oh
S0238	but when you look at the latin name it be a it be a something but it it that be where i saw the buddleia bite
S0243	right
S0238	erm and it's definitely smaller than the other buddleias that i get
S0243	so it's presumably the same family but
S0238	mm
S0243	slightly off
S0238	mm well except that what i've actually get isn't what i be suppose to have clearly
S0243	yeah
S0238	yeah there's a lot of butterfly activity today i mean i've be
S0243	i've notice it while i've be here
S0238	mm i've be look in the in a butterfly book a lot since i come here because i do seem to see quite a few and quite a lot of them say something like april may and august september in other word
S0243	oh
S0238	they seem to have two periods when the when they're active and i don't quite know what that's about
S0243	well now i've cut my buddleia back which be only a few days ago there's not a lot for em to come to out of my kitchen window
S0238	mm
S0243	which be where i look
S0238	well i be obviously be look to see also not just in my butterfly book but in that garden for wildlife book to see what they need
S0243	mm
S0238	and quite a lot of them lay their egg on nettle lovely
S0243	yes i think i know that
S0238	erm but quite a few of them ivy well of course there's tonnes of ivy over there on that that be a wall there that look like a hedge
S0243	oh
S0238	erm
S0243	right
S0238	so that may be one reason why i i've there've be a lot of butterfly come here ever since i move in you know it be not anything i've do particularly
S0243	it never stop do it the garden
S0238	no
S0243	there's always something you have to do
S0238	well no things like create something suitable for wildlife a lot of it you you do it and leave it
S0243	mm
S0238	it's either
S0243	mm
S0238	make sure you've get the right plant in or things like you know i've get quite a few piece of stone that i've just sort of pile under those tree down there at the end of the garden
S0243	yeah
S0238	that isn't in the bite that isn't really be use so that things might hibernate
S0243	ah right
S0238	you know
S0243	yes
S0238	erm
S0243	like slug
S0238	well preferably not like slug but
S0243	i haven't have any in the kitchen lately i think for about a fortnight
S0238	well
S0243	and i be see them quite often
S0238	mm
S0243	yeah well i suppose i'd better make my way home it be still busy at sunday morning
S0238	oh i didn't tell you i be i be in well it be the festival that's why
S0243	oh yes yes
S0238	erm i be man a stall there yesterday for the rspb
S0243	oh right of what information
S0238	well they sell things and erm a tombola that be kind of aim at kid
S0243	mm
S0238	erm i mean
S0243	be
S0238	it wasn't a tombola it be actually a bag
S0243	lucky dip
S0238	yes but erm
S0243	be it well attend
S0238	yes cos i the first year that i join the local group i go along to do to help them with that and it be a nasty wet day and we get hardly anybody and it be really not good at all well do i say i've join the committee
S0243	no
S0238	i think well i'm not do the theatre any more so i can do it and he's he be always be ask for extra committee members erm you know there be people who be will to help with the tea and coffee at the meet and things like that but nobody want to sign up for the committee erm and he have be i say he cos because there's one bloke call whose wife do stuff as well erm and everybody else be female erm and he be the leader and until this year he be the treasurer as well now somebody have step up to be treasurer erm so i go to the first meet and say you know i'll i'm volunteer for the committee i mean it obviously it's between agms but they they can do that relatively informally it's not like i have to fill a form in that go off to
S0243	mm
S0238	er hq erm so there be a committee meet last monday erm partly to sort things out for this so we do a rota and i be do one till three
S0243	mm
S0238	which actually be a bite of an awkward time cos i think well then how when do i eat so in the end i walk down cos i think that'll give me my exercise for the day and i go i be go to go to but i end up go to be it the a caff on that same thing as the
S0243	there's a new italian one i think
S0238	well i wouldn't have say it be italian but well
S0243	no
S0238	yes it have pasta but
S0243	the reason i haven't be but i meet by chance and she be meet a friend in this italian one and i say i didn't even know there be an italian one
S0238	well there's there's i pass somewhere else that i would have call a caff and of course there's which wasn't open at lunchtime
S0243	oh
S0238	erm and the terrace and this all along that one little stretch erm i mean in fact there be quite a lot of things down in but i didn't quite know what there would be there so i i deliberately walk at that row and
S0243	there's a something call the other side of the road
S0238	right well where have get the grind floor and upstairs this have get the grind floor and actually a basement which i only discover when i go down to the toilet and realise there be more seat there be more table down there
S0243	oh oh
