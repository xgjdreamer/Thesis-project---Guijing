S0450	we we'll see how it go from work
S0439	yeah at the moment we're go through a restructure and they say that basically they can move us position if there our job doesn't change
S0450	yeah
S0439	the thing be we've already over the last four months be merge with production so my job have now change fifty percent anyway
S0450	yeah
S0439	so i've gain another fifty percent extra work
S0450	yeah
S0439	so
S0450	it's not the best but it isn't bad
S0439	so now they're like have another restructure it's fine like i'm not worry about it i don't think they're not gonna make us redundant
S0450	yeah
S0439	but you'd really want them to like re evaluate our contract and i don't think they're go go
S0450	yes but i most place don't they're like
S0439	no
S0450	they're like oh you know they're in the they're not gonna leave unless they make a big fuss
S0439	yeah exactly
S0450	and some you know some people be make a fuss and like i'm not get what i need but
S0439	yeah
S0450	most people and i don't think it work and they didn't they won't do it either
S0439	no
S0450	so like our company say ah you know we'll review pay and benefit to go in it and be competitive with like the market
S0439	but they're not
S0450	but ours be probably like everyone know we get pay less than people around here you know for a midlands business like you everyone know that but no one like
S0439	yeah
S0450	they don't change it you'll get more you'll just get inflation every year and like
S0439	yeah that's the thing that i really don't like about london though be that you just unless you're earn over like thirty five thousand pound you can't have a you can't enjoy the same lifestyle as what you can in other part of the country
S0450	no that's it's true though isn't it cos i have lot of where like cos i'm just live at home like if i be in you wouldn't have it you'd
S0439	no yeah
S0439	but you obviously save a hell of a lot more than most people because you can live at home
S0450	mm yes yeah
S0450	thank you thank you
S0450	but it's just yeah that's what i think i would make if i have to go back to london or anywhere else
S0439	you'd suddenly realise how expensive it be yeah
S0450	yeah cos i'd obviously like basically i be you know it's a reality check that like i will i it'll didn't like go into like you know you just have to be so tight in what you do and have to limit yourself as to what you do
S0439	yeah it's not just like rent it's like
S0439	then you've get council tax and you've get bill and you've get travel and you know and it's just everything add up
S0450	travel food nights out meals out cos you always go for more meals
S0439	yeah in london like at lunchtime so i go out all
S0450	in place yeah
S0439	if ever i'm in london for the day i have like a coffee in the morning
S0450	mm
S0439	and i have lunch out i have a coffee on the way home it's really like and it's just so completely cos it's just
S0450	and it's just so convenient cos it's just there and you're not have time for it
S0439	and it's like so how much be they two pound for a cup of coffee three pound and you're like
S0450	yeah
S0439	that's two a day it's like six quid six time five be thirty that's thirty pound a week on coffee
S0450	mm
S0439	like what the fuck
S0450	yeah and you would think i could make that up i'm gonna go and take it with me like
S0439	yeah exactly
S0450	and you know like like you'll you get i think you'll probably realise that it's like i need to take them home but
S0439	yeah
S0450	you you do in the end so i'm spend like thirty five thirty pound a month when i've be in london
S0439	yeah
S0450	so like a hundred pound a month then i be like yeah need to only eat out once a week at lunch
S0439	yeah eat out a week be
S0450	but you
S0439	eat out in london's just anything and it doesn't seem expensive at the time yeah yeah you're it's only six quid
S0450	it's good though
S0439	but then you have six quid every day
S0450	so when you see a statement you're like
S0439	yeah
S0450	oh oh all my money be basically food i can't i can either go home for a weekend but i get really cheap ticket all the time when i be go home
S0439	yeah
S0450	but if i be pay like fifty quid for like return ticket for like erm
S0439	no
S0450	i need to like
S0439	how much be your ticket here today
S0450	eight pound about eight pound fifty return i think it be
S0439	it's so good isn't it it's so good
S0450	or be it like eighty or something for a day return i think it be gonna be more expensive
S0439	that's ridiculously cheap
S0450	fifteen sixteen pound like
S0439	yeah that's so cheap
S0450	but it's on my rail card as well so i think it must be
S0439	yeah
S0450	about twelve quid or something
S0439	i've get a rail card as well
S0450	i mean it'll last another year and a half i think i don't know
S0439	yeah twenty five isn't it
S0450	i get three i think i get a three year one so i don't know when it expire
S0439	i've gotta get it
S0450	i get it last year
S0439	i'm get another one next year
S0450	and that's it
S0439	twenty five tell me about it i've only just turn twenty four
S0450	i think that would be a reality check like what do i do
S0439	i know i'm a twenty five year old what happen i don't feel like an adult at the moment so
S0450	shall i move out stay at home
S0439	mm
S0450	i always look at the the house there for sale they're like still can't afford to buy anything
S0439	no it's ridiculous er buy house nowadays be just extortionate
S0450	until you know exactly where you wanna live cos then you don't wanna be either too far from where you're work cos it's just too the amount of time you spend in a car that's why i wouldn't have want to do be like spend
S0439	yeah
S0450	so much time travel to work travel home then you don't have a life
S0439	exactly
S0450	i don't want that lifestyle it's like i finish at a decent time
S0439	yeah
S0450	cycle to work
S0439	that's why i like i really like the industry i'm in i get into work at half past seven i leave between half past three and four o'clock

S0450	mm
S0439	really really easy and
S0450	mm it's an easier life isn't it
S0439	yeah and i enjoy it like that's the problem with like consider the industry isn't the most well pay i have an amaze work life balance
S0450	yeah it's what you need more it's like what do you do with more money that you can't spend

S0439	exactly
S0450	i always think like everyone's like you know when they're like oh it'd be really great i wish i finish uni and go travel for a year but it's like i would do but then you think you you need money to do that
S0439	yeah exactly
S0450	and then when you're in a job it's like do you wanna leave it do you not
S0439	yeah you love have money yeah
S0450	not have a job to come back to you probably could get a job easily when you get back

S0450	but something like but erm yeah cos everyone else cancel them cos they're like we haven't get any money
S0439	yeah no one ever have any money
S0450	which be which be obviously yeah it's like i can understand it but at the same time it's like i've save up you know when you know that
S0439	yeah
S0450	you're gonna save up enough of a kind of to keep you go but stringy i always find noodles messy
S0439	me too i didn't know this be soup

S0439	oh yeah let's go in
S0439	it's not even be like over a year since do croatia and it's just like the years have fly by
S0450	i be look at the picture i be look at the picture of like
S0439	i saw yeah
S0450	you know i get i get reminiscent every time i look at picture like i wanna go on holiday or i look at them because i'm on a holiday but i do i do love them it be it be sunny and warm i miss the sun that time i love the winter that time but not cold but
S0439	yeah i know what you mean
S0450	but
S0439	i just i think this it's just so weird cos i'm not i don't we obviously have have a summer but you know when you spend so much time like anticipate and wait for the summer
S0450	and then it go so quickly
S0439	and it's over yeah you're like oh
S0450	i didn't do much this summer though i do a few things but you know when you think oh i should've do more
S0439	yeah
S0450	i do i do start bike rid though
S0439	yeah i know you've become like a keen cyclist haven't you
S0450	yeah i cycle to work for two days it take me forty five minutes each way to cycle to wor
S0439	that's not bad that's good
S0450	it's six and a half miles
S0439	yeah
S0450	and it be it wasn't too bad it wasn't like you know i didn't cycle too fast i wasn't sweaty
S0439	no
S0450	i be like if i'm sweaty i can obviously have a shower before start work cos i you know when you leave enough time
S0439	yeah
S0450	but and it be like more energetic for the two days and i be like yeah it's rain now
S0439	yeah
S0450	and then and then i wish i buy it in like april
S0439	mm
S0450	may time like the bike cos i buy the bike for like sixty quid cos like i'm not and i be like if i don't spend any money on it
S0439	you wouldn't no you don't wanna spend lot on it though do you
S0450	specially if i be like just in case i don't need it you know i'll put use it a few time and then i'll just leave it
S0439	yeah
S0450	and that happen sometimes you know with stuff you're like ah i feel for the for the first few months it's like amaze and then you won't use it
S0439	yeah exactly the novelty wear off doesn't it
S0450	but i don't spend any money i don't spend any money on it that's fine if it just sit there for until next year or i give it away to someone you know
S0439	mm
S0450	not too bad and then i really enjoy it and then i think every few weeks i go for a good cycle for like an hour
S0439	yeah
S0450	specially until it get really cold well until like i'm gonna see for the next few weeks try on a sunday just er park at like nine in the morning or something
S0439	mm
S0450	i get out at like not the nothing really around me so
S0439	yeah
S0450	have to be in the park for a bite and it's quite busy anyway so
S0439	i just like i like i do enjoy exercise
S0450	mm
S0439	it just make you feel so much better about yourself you do exercise
S0450	i'd rather be outdoors
S0439	mm
S0450	any time or yeah i prefer the outdoors as well i find i do enjoy it but you know when they're all work at like my friend someone have shift work
S0439	yeah
S0450	and then it's sorta like it can't be every week it's like cos it's not organiser plan so it's
S0439	mm
S0450	like every other few weeks on that week but no it's good start play badminton again
S0439	oh have you
S0450	yeah hadn't play in about seven eight years and i book a court last week and i be it be so like there's like erm you know like there's like local swim pool inside one of them sport halls
S0439	yeah
S0450	so i'm gonna walk to my house i haven't be there in about five or six years i'm like it's so close to my house it's not too bad in price how come i haven't be in it like sooner you think you know when you think i can't believe i didn't think about go there
S0439	mm
S0450	and it be so badminton be so much better
S0439	same as squash i find squash really fun to do
S0450	yeah
S0439	it's find someone to do it with you isn't it
S0450	mm and you forget how tire you get
S0439	mm
S0450	that quickly like in half an hour we be both sweat we be knackered
S0439	yeah
S0450	we hadn't play in age so we be like but they be like no one be go on but just the
S0439	i just love sport
S0450	yeah me too i think i would prefer it any day to go to the gym
S0439	mm
S0450	i just feel like cos you know when you're sit round all day at work and then at least cos i walk a bite to work and back so i can get some sort of like my legs move leg bite of leg movement
S0439	mm
S0450	apart from that there isn't much i mean when you don't want to do anything at the weekend you just sit around
S0439	i try go to the gym at lunchtime at work cos they have a gym on campus so
S0450	oh yeah bet that's much like so much better than
S0439	mm
S0450	compare to the convenience of have it
S0439	yeah i just get up and like i get up at one
S0450	mm
S0439	go to the gym one till two come back and i've do an hour's exercise have a break from my desk
S0450	mm
S0439	i've get away for a bite you know just
S0450	that's a definitely good idea i wish we have something closer and i would probably do it
S0439	mm
S0450	sometimes it's like afternoon like you know some people organise run in the afternoon and stuff but then you're like i've get the same there's time you just can't leave well we kind of only have half an hour lunch break
S0439	yeah that's really weird we have an hour
S0450	don't know not sure but it depend you know it's it's different between different team cos some team have an hour but then they end up stay longer anyway so
S0439	oh yeah
S0450	it kind of come out your own time so i guess if you want to take them it some people like if they want to take longer they'd longer they they probably would work longer
S0439	mm
S0450	then it's like when you've get a meet and stuff it's like and they always yeah you know when you end up have so many meet like at lunchtime though why do you organise it then
S0439	mm
S0450	like yesterday
S0439	i hate to have meet over lunch it annoy the hell out of me
S0450	we we be busy from about midday and then to
S0439	yeah
S0450	i think half twelve there be a meet they have meet until three until three like future website plan sessions there be like twenty of us in a room with post it note decide what we want like the you know like development priorities or like
S0439	yeah
S0450	new futures like be it you know erm you know what like we be try to finish like plan for that meet so like we we just didn't have time for lunch
S0439	oh
S0450	get to like halfway through it we've get a massive buffet in the even we're like we want to eat and then everyone be like thank god there be snack by my manager
S0450	cos he buy load of food for
S0439	i love snack
S0450	if not i would literally be like die in that room like post it note talk about
S0439	we have erm we call it the trans fat table
S0450	mm
S0439	and it's literally like a just a table at the end of our desks
S0450	mm
S0439	not everybody's desks like one table at the end of a like a row
S0450	oh yeah
S0439	and people like for birthdays and stuff bring in food and dump it on this table
S0450	mm
S0439	and it's just like call the trans fat table cos sometimes you're on a friday and you're like why be the trans fat table empty
S0450	that's worse when you want something
S0439	yeah
S0450	it's the days you want something there's nothing there the days you don't want something it's literally like full in your face
