S0030	hello um i'm um
S0096	and i'm
S0030	and we're career consultants here at um the university so thank for ask us to do this um what we think we'd talk about um for a short period of time um be about cvs because as career er consultants or advisers we end up spend a lot of our time think and talk about cvs um for people who be actually apply for job so um they consume a lot of our time and energy um and they're something that we know a lot about but also probably drive us mad on occasion
S0096	yeah
S0096	i would agree
S0096	at the end of the day they be the number one query if we have to kind of er compile a list of everything that we do cvs be the number one query and i guess the thing about cvs be first and foremost there be no right or wrong answer be there
S0030	mm i know i know and people come um and it's a very important thing actually your cv i can understand why people worry about it really because it be your call card it be your your document which if you're apply for a job or anything you you really wanna make sure um it's good um i've probably in my time see thousands of cvs and i'm always amaze about how very clever people can actually er sort of struggle sometimes to actually present themselves very well in a cv really so um so we spend a lot of our time sort of talk to people really and people talk about chronological cvs and skills base cvs
S0096	mm
S0030	and infographic cvs and and so on um so a lot of time you know it's talk to people about what kind of cv um they like and er i mean my personal thing be huh i've get a a kind of a view point that i think actually do the cv's really useful because it make people think about themselves
S0096	mm
S0030	and er who they be and what they wanna say about themselves and and often sometimes people when they do their first draft of the cv it's very much like a list as er sometimes as career advisers we're try to kind of get them to think well you may have have as a student maybe a very ordinary job in a bar but what be your responsibilities what skills do you develop and um just people need quite a bite of coax to do that and to move away
S0096	mm
S0030	from just a check list of little things they've do
S0096	yeah i think it's sometimes people just see it as quite an it's kind of not a natural thing to do and maybe it's er a british thing where we're a little bite more reserve about our achievements and it's change your mindset
S0030	mm
S0096	about have to do that because
S0030	mm
S0096	for all the change to recruitment cvs be still predominantly
S0030	mm
S0096	ask
S0030	mm
S0096	by a lot of the major sectors
S0030	mm
S0096	so people be still
S0030	mm
S0096	unsure of how to phrase them and what people
S0030	mm
S0096	look for
S0030	mm
S0096	and that's when we say there's so many wide and vary occupations it's do your research first that's the thing don't produce a cv and then look for work
S0030	mm
S0096	look for the opportunities think about what suit your need what you're look for now be it part time work or be it an academic position
S0030	mm
S0096	and then tailor
S0030	mm
S0096	your cv and i think it's try to trouble shoot some of the myths round cvs
S0030	mm
S0096	and
S0030	mm
S0096	and the question people have and people struggle because they'll produce a cv
S0030	mm
S0096	and then just say what kind of work can i go for
S0030	mm
S0096	so as a start point it's the other way round think about what you're look for
S0030	mm mm
S0096	you know what type of opportunity where be you now
S0030	mm
S0096	in term of your career plan
S0030	mm
S0096	and then
S0030	mhm
S0096	produce a cv to match that
S0030	so tahira do you think that people should always have an up to date cv
S0096	yeah
S0030	and have you get an up to date cv
S0096	no
S0096	this it's funny you should ask me that actually cos just recently i've be look at my cv it's not completely do but yes
S0030	and what do your cv look like what kind of head do you have on your cv
S0096	my cv have a personal profile so obviously my name and my contact detail and then a personal profile which be basically the years of work experience i've have my professional qualification and the career opportunities i'd be look for and then my work history and then my education and a skills section
S0030	okay okay
S0096	what about you
S0096	fiona it's an interest one isn't it
S0096	er to ask a career adviser
S0030	it be it be um well i've not update my cv very recently um but my cv have get er my personal detail at the top um i very much have my name at the top rather than curriculum vitae i always tell students don't have curriculum vitae at the top of your cv put your name in big bold letter at the top of your cv i'll then have kind of what i call a personal profile stroke career objective where i try to convey what be my unique sell point
S0096	mm
S0030	and summary of who i be together with what it be that i'm seek um so that's my kind of short career objective which would be probably no more than about three line i then have a section which be um personal skills stroke strengths so i actually identify things that i think i'm very good at that i choose which kind of capture my skills and my achievements together in one section
S0096	oh that's er interest mm
S0030	so i've get that next on my cv
S0096	mm
S0030	and then i've get um in reverse chronological order my employment
S0096	mm
S0030	um so um detail my responsibilities um so far in different job that i've have as i've be work for a long time now i er i probably can lose some of the job that i do a long time ago and within that i try to interweave
S0096	mm
S0030	responsibilities and skills within within the those section and then i'd have maybe a section which be achievements which be more kind of miscellaneous things it could be about maybe voluntary work that i've do currently or in the past um i might have a section as well which be more i've forget my education section need to be in there what my qualifications
S0096	mm
S0030	be i'll also have a train section if i've participate in any kind of work base train which isn't really a qualification as such not like have a master or a degree it's more like have a qualification in psychometric test or something and then i would have interest as well cos i think that interest do indicate you're a little bite of a round person um and then i'd have at the bottom reference available on request
S0096	ah
S0030	and even though i've be work now for quite a long time over twenty years really i'd still probably try to get my cv on two page with my with the view that it's two page of my best bits
S0096	yeah i think yeah maybe it's worthwhile er actually then cover cv etiquette
S0030	yeah
S0096	cos i think that's the other thing it's how long should a cv be
S0030	yeah
S0096	and then i always sort of say well who's it aim at
S0030	mhm
S0096	and what type of opportunity
S0030	mm
S0096	so what would you say for a part time cv how long part time job cv
S0030	um i think it depend if you're a brand new er um undergraduate and you've
S0096	mm
S0030	not work very much and you've only get gcses or a level then probably a page be long enough
S0096	yeah
S0030	um so really i'd say a page or two page but you know if you be a mature student and you come in and you've get quite a bite of experience you might not want to lose some of that so you'd want two page
S0096	mm
S0030	um i do really it's interest i have we have i'm sure you're the same tahira so many people who come with really quite long cvs and um huh they might have a whole half a page which be just their personal detail
S0096	yes
S0030	you know nicely lay out and space out and um and i think there be cultural differences here but i do always say to people it's two page of your best bits so
S0096	yeah
S0030	it's not suppose to be like a comprehensive document of absolutely everything you've do um
S0096	er it's interest about cultural differences as well though isn't it
S0030	yeah
S0096	i think er from what i see from a lot of international students be the the er the information of of mm you know want to put more information on
S0030	mm
S0096	so obviously the
S0030	mm
S0096	i've see a lot of cvs where they run
S0030	mm
S0096	to three or four
S0030	mm
S0096	page i think the most i've see be seven page
S0030	mm
S0096	i don't know how many
S0030	mm
S0096	page you've see
S0030	mm
S0096	for the most
S0030	mm
S0096	um but other things there that i wouldn't ordinarily
S0030	mm mm
S0096	see you know things like
S0030	mm
S0096	your health
S0030	mm
S0096	and whether you're a smoker or a
S0030	mm
S0096	non smoker
S0030	mm mm
S0096	your marital status
S0030	mm
S0096	which i know we've not see for a number of years
S0030	mm mm
S0096	um and things about sign off your cv as a declaration of
S0030	mm
S0096	the truth
S0030	mm
S0096	and i think there be a lot to be say in
S0030	mm
S0096	term of cultural differences in the cv
S0030	mm mm
S0096	photos
S0030	that's right that's right yeah it's funny isn't it people even after we've be do this a long time people will still surprise me for their question like i think only a couple of weeks ago a student say to me why do i need to put my address on my cv
S0096	yeah
S0030	and i be a bite surprise really cos i think well well kind of because you want the employer to contact you so you want to give them as many ways as possible to contact you um so why wouldn't you put your address on it really so it seem um a strange question to me even though they may well have a point and actually really um give an e mail address they're probably gonna be contact you through e mail through phone why do they actually need your address
S0096	yeah i know
S0030	so it's quite
S0096	mm
S0030	it's a reasonable point even though i would always tend to assume you should put your address
S0096	yeah
S0030	on a cv really
S0096	i would agree with you because i think it depend on the type of employer doesn't it
S0030	yeah
S0096	and the opportunity
S0030	yeah
S0096	but as we know if it's a council on the i mean cvs might be the first
S0030	mm
S0096	thing they accept
S0030	mm mm
S0096	you might be send an application form
S0030	mm
S0096	or you might be send additional
S0030	mm
S0096	literature
S0030	mm
S0096	things that they need to
S0030	mm
S0096	to cover so it's it's useful like you say to give them all avenues to cover but interestingly what do you think about put more than one contact number down or more than one address or more than one e mail
S0030	um okay alright well my view would be that um you want to make it er easier for the employer
S0096	mm
S0030	to contact you so if you want to give them more than one phone number like a landline and a mobile number or two e mail address one your own e mail and one your student e mail then then do it but obviously don't go over over the top
S0096	yeah
S0030	um don't if you be if you be gonna include a few contact detail try and make sure that doesn't kind of then take up a load of space on your page really
S0096	mm
S0030	so i i would be fairly um relax about kind of contact detail i wouldn't be say to people you only should put one on
S0096	yeah
S0030	what about you
S0096	you see i i kind of take a different view
S0030	do you okay
S0096	i i do say make it easy for the employer so put one on that you know you're gonna check all the time
S0030	mm
S0096	and same for students if you're live in share accommodation or student
S0030	mm
S0096	accommodation and you're worry about your mail then have it to a secure address
S0030	mm
S0096	whether it's your
S0030	mm
S0096	family or somebody else
S0030	yeah
S0096	then then
S0030	mm
S0096	do it that way but put something that you're go to
S0030	mm
S0096	be able to access
S0030	mm
S0096	every day and similarly with e mail address i say this particularly to graduate or
S0030	mm
S0096	final years
S0030	mm
S0096	you know jobseeking can take a good two or three
S0030	mm
S0096	months
S0030	mm
S0096	and by the time the employer's get back in touch with you
S0030	mm mm
S0096	you might have already have leave the university
S0030	mm
S0096	and not have
S0030	mm
S0096	access to e mail
S0030	mm
S0096	so mm set up
S0030	yeah
S0096	a professional e mail account
S0030	mm mm mm
S0096	and they can contact you
S0030	so what do you think about this whole dilemma between this debate between skills base cvs which have a really big skills section and the more kind of standard chronological cv what what's your take on that
S0096	i think my take ideally you should have both you know so what they'd call a functional cv or a combination
S0030	mm
S0096	cv
S0030	mm
S0096	if you like be to i mean again if you've be work for a number of years it's useful to start with your work history
S0030	mm
S0096	and just as you've do summarize your key skills but have a separate key skills section
S0030	mm
S0096	um whereas if you're a student maybe who's just look for that first graduate position
S0030	mm
S0096	it's probably better to start off with your education and
S0030	mm
S0096	work history
S0030	mm
S0096	and then your skills section but i think you
S0030	mm
S0096	do need
S0030	mm
S0096	to include a skills section because that's one of the big grip that we
S0030	mm
S0096	hear from employers
S0030	mm
S0096	be lack of self awareness
S0030	but do you not think that it's better to interweave your skills into your um achievements or your job rather than have a separate skills section that's what some people think
S0096	yeah i think you can have both it's the phrase that you use you know
S0030	mm
S0096	obviously you want to highlight
S0030	mm
S0096	mm er the i think one of the things that really also i find frustrate on cvs be when you know people have copy and paste the same job duties for like three or four different job roles
S0030	mm
S0096	and as an employer you would guess okay well they've not
S0030	mm
S0096	really push themselves they've not show initiative they don't have
S0030	mm
S0096	different responsibilities
S0030	mm
S0096	and i think you can show that so i think that's what you need to do be to aim for um demonstrate your responsibilities but have a separate section so you can still say you plan or you coordinate or you have experience in
S0030	mm
S0096	you know or you develop you initiate
S0030	mm
S0096	but then also have a skills section
S0030	mm
S0096	where you know the employer value business awareness
S0030	mm
S0096	or value communication
S0030	mm
S0096	or interpersonal skills so you could have a separate section
S0030	mm mm
S0096	because you know er you might want to kind of make sure that they're highlight for those two or three competencies that they're seek
S0030	okay
S0096	mm
S0030	and um do you put your date of birth on your cv
S0096	yeah that's an interest one see i i would say follow the guidelines for cvs or applications from the advert but i wouldn't put it on there i mean it's very few circumstances that you need that unless the employer be ask you to work with vulnerable people
S0030	mm
S0096	i mean it might be recruitment agencies that
S0030	mm
S0096	actually ask you for that detail if you're work for social care or
S0030	mm
S0096	social work
S0030	mm
S0096	or teach opportunities but i can't think of any other
S0030	mm
S0096	situations where it's a necessity
S0030	mm mm
S0096	for you to put your date of birth especially give the equality act
S0030	mm sure and age discrimination and so on
S0096	yeah
S0030	yeah how about nationality would you put nationality on your cv or would you encourage your international students to put nationality on their cv
S0096	see that's a hot potato isn't it i mean how many career advisers can you put in a room to discuss that
S0030	absolutely
S0096	and will you get consensus at the end of it
S0030	mm
S0096	um no i er personally i would say there's things that be gonna give you away i mean i'm a british citizen but my name isn't your standard english name so i put my nationality on because other things will be indicators to employers you know your name um your education work experience especially if you're an international student
S0030	mm
S0096	so i do believe there will be elements of that that will already make an
S0030	mm
S0096	employer
S0030	mm
S0096	question whether you're a british student a home student eu
S0030	mm
S0096	or international
S0030	mhm
S0096	in which case if they're already ask those question by you put in your status or your right to work
S0030	mm
S0096	your visa status
S0030	mm
S0096	you can make it much clearer
S0030	mm
S0096	for an employer
S0030	mm
S0096	so my personal take be yes put it on there
S0030	mm
S0096	but i know others would disagree
S0030	mm mm
S0096	what do you feel
S0030	yeah i think actually um er er sometimes especially you know we we see international students who be look for part time work and they're allow to work twenty hours a week while they're here you might make it might make sense to put nigerian er nationality nigerian and permission to work in the uk twenty twenty hours a week
S0096	mm
S0030	um as a student and actually straight away you've allay any fear or anxieties that employers may have about
S0096	exactly
S0030	employ international um people really
S0096	mm
S0030	so it's pragmatic probably me i've get a british sound name i probably wouldn't put british on my cv
S0096	mhm
S0030	unless i be apply for like er potentially a job um you know outside britain where my nationality may be relevant
S0096	mm
S0030	um so um i think this be interest i think that that's the beauty of cvs actually um but um even though there's some very general guidelines um and some rule in a way er it's also very you've get to judge it each on each situation huh there be interestingly
S0096	yeah
S0030	there be a discussion i don't know if you saw it on um a linkedin group about should we have a um should in britain we adopt a kind of more standard cv type a bite like the europass cv
S0096	ah no i miss that
S0030	there be a discussion er on the linkedin uk he career professionals linkedin group and somebody start that um because i think they work with they be work with college students and they be say that cvs be so bad that they always think it would be a lot better to say look this be your structure follow it um but it generate quite a lot of debate and um i think kind of i i think actually for candidates and recruiters actually have a bite more huh general guidelines but some flexibility cos it mean you as a candidate can make your cv your own
S0096	mm
S0030	your own sales document
S0096	yeah
S0030	um and then also as recruiter sometimes if everybody's fill in a standard thing then it might make it harder for you to to kind of um sort of differentiate kind of the the different personalities er you know kind of
S0096	yeah
S0030	that might be apply so it's er it's an interest one
S0096	it be because i mean er what i say to students be don't assume that your cvs the first one
S0030	mm
S0096	in front of that recruiter
S0030	mm
S0096	or that indeed they're look at it at first thing in the morning when they're sort of likely to be awake you know and fresh and and you know your cv might be something that they're review on a train
S0030	mm
S0096	it might be something that they've sort of
S0030	mm
S0096	have make time for at six o'clock er in the even once the rest of the day's go by
S0030	mm
S0096	so how do you make your cv number thirty nine
S0030	mm mm
S0096	stand out in a pile of sixty
S0030	mm mm
S0096	and then you we all know that cvs have
S0030	mm
S0096	set information you've get your personal detail on there you've get your education your work experience your skills section so it's look at what be your unique sell point now
S0030	mm
S0096	it might be your social media if you're on linkedin if you have a blog might be
S0030	mm
S0096	worthwhile include that
S0030	mm
S0096	on there
S0030	mm
S0096	you know it might be er other things like
S0030	mm
S0096	your language skills mm drive licence again be overuse but things that be different
S0030	mm
S0096	or that be gonna be useful
S0030	mm mm
S0096	for that employer
S0030	mm
S0096	to know
S0030	mm
S0096	you know it's it's useful to put on there and your sort of
S0030	mm
S0096	professional associations think of er achievements that they sort of be above and beyond what you've actually you know what you've sort of accomplish and you're proud of so above and
S0030	mm
S0096	beyond what would be expect of you on a day to day basis to make your cv stand out
S0030	mm
S0096	dunno how you
S0030	mm
S0096	what you feel about that
S0030	mm
S0096	or even social media
S0030	yeah yeah yeah so yeah no no i i agree i agree i agree with that so um
S0096	what about infographic cvs what do you think about them
S0030	um i haven't see many really you know in term of clients er i it's what be interest actually be that i think that er there's content and presentation and actually have a
S0096	mm
S0030	fairly plain simple presentation but if you've get some rock solid content that's the most important thing
S0096	yeah
S0030	um obviously infographic cvs be part of a a style which be make presentation fancier and more attractive and actually display your it skills as well the fact that you can do these
S0096	mm
S0030	things um i think they can look nice um you know so and they're still fairly novel
S0096	mm
S0030	maybe less in some industries than others um so you know i can see their their value i know that actually there's a technique say on linkedin where you can actually there's er there's some sort of er application programme where you can get your have you do it tahira
S0096	it's visibility i think isn't it
S0030	yeah you can get your
S0096	that you can put on there
S0030	linkedin cv
S0096	yeah
S0030	detail to convert into an infographic cv
S0096	mm
S0030	and i do do that and it look okay it look okay
S0096	mm
S0030	but it be really more just a bar chart of
S0096	mm
S0030	how many years i'd work in different place and things like that so it didn't wasn't that excite really so
S0096	no i think that's the thing as well be be careful of gimmicks
S0030	yeah
S0096	isn't it and er and be it something that's necessary
S0030	mm
S0096	for the industry that you're
S0030	mm
S0096	go into
S0030	mm
S0096	so for
S0030	mm
S0096	things like medicine would it be necessary
S0030	mm mm
S0096	compare to an advertise
S0030	mm mm
S0096	career or a
S0030	yeah
S0096	graphic design career
S0030	mm
S0096	so again it really go back to know your employer
S0030	mm
S0096	do your research
S0030	mm
S0096	what's expect of them and other things that people forget things like when you see advert and they say send in your cv
S0030	mm
S0096	they usually have a name and contact
S0030	mm
S0096	number
S0030	mm
S0096	somebody in hr or somebody who's responsible for recruitment
S0030	mm mm
S0096	if you're not sure call them
S0030	mm
S0096	and ask
S0030	mm
S0096	you know what be the kinds of things
S0030	mm
S0096	that they're expect what would they like to see cover
S0030	mm
S0096	and then have that determine your cv as well
S0030	mm and i've get another question to ask you
S0096	mm
S0030	if a if an employer say um apply um er er you know make er applications through um please send your cv
S0096	mm
S0030	um would you assume that you would just send a cv or would you send a cover letter as well with the cv
S0096	i would possibly send a cover letter
S0030	yeah
S0096	i mean even if it's a small to medium size enterprise
S0030	mm
S0096	and you're
S0030	mm
S0096	think
S0030	mm
S0096	they're not gonna have many opportunities
S0030	mm
S0096	i think it's good practice and a courtesy because that employer between the time they're place the advert
S0030	mm
S0096	to the close date you know er there's
S0030	mm
S0096	so much that they could be do
S0030	mm
S0096	that it's just worthwhile as a courtesy to kind of explain a little bite more and the cover letter be your chance again to really demonstrate your knowledge and
S0030	mm
S0096	and your suitability
S0030	mm
S0096	for the
S0030	mm
S0096	role you're
S0030	mm
S0096	apply for
S0030	mm yeah
S0096	what do you feel
S0030	yeah no i would i always say to students if it say apply um with a cv always include a cover letter
S0096	yeah
S0030	you know so um and i be actually also i know as career advisers we talk a lot about tailor cvs
S0096	mm
S0030	and i completely i would er completely um agree huh with that um but i think often the real tailor be do be an er in any letter that go with the cv that er sometimes you can have a cv that may be fairly similar
S0096	mm
S0030	actually you know you might tweak it slightly depend on what you're apply for um but it could be a fundamentally very similar document but the real tailor of your application be go in your cover letter so sometimes i think as career advisers we may overplay the your cv must be really tailor
S0096	er yeah
S0030	when in actual fact yes you can tailor it a bite it might mean change the objective or the the the order of things and how you you've kind of play around with the cv a little bite
S0096	mm
S0030	but the er the real tailor can may be in the the letter
S0096	yeah
S0030	um that go with it really so
S0096	no i agree
S0030	mm
S0096	because the letter's when you can actually write down why you're interest in that particular
S0030	yeah
S0096	employer
S0030	yeah yeah
S0096	and how your skill set match
S0030	yeah
S0096	what they're look for
S0030	mm
S0096	whereas your cv be to showcase the skills that you feel you've get
S0030	mm
S0096	your skills and experience
S0030	mm mm
S0096	and also er any other things like your technical skills and your er professional associations memberships that be a requirement
S0030	mm
S0096	of the job role
S0030	mm
S0096	that you're seek
S0030	mm
S0096	so yeah
S0030	mm
S0096	so it's it's kind of er it's find the right kind of marriage
S0030	mm
S0096	between the two
S0030	mm
S0096	really isn't it
S0030	yeah okay do you think we've say enough about cvs i think we probably have
S0096	probably bore them with cvs
S0030	yes
S0030	let's stop
