S0486	hello erm right you're go to talk about your childhood experience today what would you say really stand out to you when you look back on that on those time
S0507	one of my earliest experience when i be about two years old and my brother be take very poorly with appendicitis and be rush into hospital and because in those days there be no antibiotics he go on to get septicaemia and i can remember my father take me down to the local hospital to see him i wasn't allow in but i could look at him through the window because children be not allow in the hospital at that time when he be due to come home then we go down with father to collect him and not have a car at that time we collect him in a taxi and bring him home and it be just lovely to have him back home after so many months not have him around it felt so good at that time one of my next experience would be i suppose about when i be about three or four my grandmother live with us and she have a lovely bedroom with picture all around the wall erm some which have texts from the bible and picture and a lovely big double bed with a feather mattress and i use to love to go into her feather mattress bed and snuggle up beside her and she would tell me stories and i know the stories well because she would say well which story do you want today and i would say oh this one please nana and she would say oh you've hear that one before and i would say oh yes i know but i want to hear it again so that be erm one of my earliest memories i suppose erm i be only two when war break out so there be many memories as war take hold and i think my father be call up when i be just three and a half to go with his call up paper and i can remember the call up paper i didn't know they be that but be put through the letterbox and have great distress in the family with my mother cry and nana upset er because father have get to go and leave the family home and go to serve in the force so that's another sort of thing that i really stand out in my memory as a little young child that that take place and obviously in time erm then he have to go and we be on our own we have quite a big house and because we have a big house we be oblige to have lodgers we weren't allow to have any free room where they be free and no one sleep in them so we have quite a series of lodgers come in to the family home which be quite a strange feel really erm to have strangers among us but my mother and grandmother be such good cook i think they all think they be onto a good place for stay and we certainly make them as comfortable as we possibly could as a child i remember during the war because we might be in a location where bomb might drop we have what they would call in those days not an outside shelter we have to go into but my erm mother and grandmother we have a big like erm an iron shelter cage in which my brother and myself be make to sleep erm just us two children and we be shut in there during the night and i sleep at one end and my brother sleep at the other end and he always use to make a fuss i remember about oh he didn't like little sister's feet poke in him erm
S0507	and erm i use to probably make a bite of a fuss about this and we there we be both in this cage erm i i remember that vividly and because er mother be a bite sort of anxious about us erm she also have a bed in that room and i remember one time when father come home on a very short leave before he be go to france erm it be over a christmas period and at the morning when we be let out erm we use to love to come and romp on the bed erm mother would be up but father be you know it's so lovely to have him back he would play erm well game with us and we would do things like head over the heel and you know funny things like that well least i do as a girl and on one occasion it create great panic on the box day because i do a head over heel so far that i go over the end of the bed
S0486	oh
S0507	and i hit my head on the corner of the iron shelter
S0486	oh
S0507	and i obviously knock myself out and when i come to i let out the most horrendous shriek and cry they'd ever hear in the household
S0507	and there be great panic station with me because box day my head bleed and oh dear it be i be in a state and so be they so anyway it be decide i have to be take down to the local hospital erm which be quite a little distance away so how be we to get there because as i say earlier we have no car at that time and obviously bus be not run and there didn't seem to be taxis about at that stage i don't know but anyway the next door neighbour to us they have erm children too of a much younger age and they have a little pushchair and so the pushchair be borrow from next door and i be wheel down to the accident and emergency i suppose department erm it wasn't call that in those days but the equivalent as that today er and there erm my head be shave at the back and i erm wind clean and then i have a little row of stitch put in erm and i suppose i be erm you know tell i be a good girl and erm i'd be very brave erm and then they be i be bring home and then we have you know some treat erm and i be make a great fuss of which be which be rather nice but i it's something i always remember in my childhood so that's another memory that really stand out vividly for me erm later on in the war my father when he be in france have quite a bad accident and he have to be bring back home to erm this country our own country to go into a military hospital he have erm as i call it in those days erm break his spine
S0486	oh
S0507	and he be erm very poorly for a long while and in fact my mother say he be never the same man again erm really for the rest of his life but as he progress and he be allow out in due course of hospital they be give erm a blue uniform so that people would know that they be not people who be not will to fight but that they be soldier and they be invalid out of the force and they be give this blue uniform and he come home and i can remember erm mother go to get him and i be with granny and then we go to meet them come off the bus not far from really a large park we have near us and i remember my parent walk arm in arm erm so lovely and i be skip along in front of them and to come back home they be come home and it be just such a joyous moment i remember that skip through the park as we you know come home again so that be another lovely little memory erm school days erm it be still the war when i go to school and start my primary school we have our own little classroom and playground separate from the erm larger children i suppose who'd move on and be there a year and we have milk at break time and it be we have to take our own mug to have it in and i think we use to have like little enamel mug and erm milk be dolloped out from a milk churn for us and in the bitter cold winter weather we get on the east side of the country er drink this cold milk which i be not very keen on at all erm from this churn erm be another memory i have erm later on i suppose erm i have a change of school because we have er a bomb drop at the end of our road and this be still do when my father be in the force and we be evacuate my brother and myself with my mother erm up to stay with an aunt and uncle in and my cousin live there so there be two boys and just me as a little girl and the two boys well they be erm probably a bite of nuisance to erm erm aunt and uncle and my mother because they be always up to game and trick and erm what have you but i go to a little school i remember it be quite a hilly area and i go to the take to the local children you know where the children go to school in the young class and one of the things we do erm be to be teach knit er i be not terribly keen on this class because although i could i be teach to knit i keep drop stitch and get into awful trouble because oh dear i'd lose a stitch again and bring it home and erm mother and aunt sort me out with the knit and back i would go and the school have a long corridor where we have to leave our little coat and there be cubbyholes erm opposite your classroom where you hang your coat erm and put your wellington boot and things like that and then you go into your classroom opposite but the trouble be all these little cubbyhole place all look the same to me i couldn't quite make out where my coat should go which classroom i should go into and i think after about six months of cop with all this erm i say to my mum mummy can we please please go home again i don't like this school to which erm i'm go so erm after a probably about another month six weeks we all troop back again to erm to the home where erm grandmother still be and where the lodgers be and erm life continue on erm much until the end of the war so that's some of my memories of early childhood i suppose erm
S0486	be
S0507	that stand so vividly in my mind
S0486	be there er any of the lodgers that you find interest or quirky or be be there anybody be there anybody there who stand out
S0507	erm yes i would say perhaps there be two that stand out erm one be a lady call erm she be and we keep friendly with her and one of the the gentlemen that come as well erm again over the years we keep in touch with and i think those two stand out really as
S0486	mm
S0507	be really nice people hard work and would help in the home as well as go out to work erm so they be really lovely others seem to pass by in a bite of a a daze for me really er one thing i do remember with when i be a very well i be just a very little girl erm mother make me do something that i really hat do erm whether it be i don't think my brother do no he definitely didn't but i i have to do it erm she want the lodger to see that i be all alright and there be nothing wrong with me erm and one day when i be due for my bath she make me come down just and show her me with just my skin with nothing else on me at erm before i sort of round the towel round again to see that i be all you know clean and nice erm and i always remember hat absolutely hat that erm but she be such a nice lady you know she they probably have a laugh erm
S0486	mm
S0507	another little memory i have of childhood be erm when i be a little bite older i suppose i be perhaps eight or nine yes that be probably about the age i be i be very poorly for about three months and erm initially they think i have mumps erm in fact the nurse come round and say that's what i'd get but i didn't get better at the end of what they think the mumps spell should be my face be get fatter and i be in a lot of pain and i seem to be lose weight and it obviously wasn't mumps and i think it be my cervical glands have become terribly swell erm i have a little bed down in the sit room and i remember on one occasion erm because we have open fire coal fire we have erm the chimney sweep come and i beg mother i want to see the chimney sweep so erm amidst all the room be cover up with cloths and all around the fireplace erm protect with things and the sweep come erm i be allow to lie on my little bed with a sweep in the room
S0507	and and see the brush the brush go up and all the rods go up and obviously there be oh dear me erm you know it wasn't a very clean process at the end but anyway erm i be give this special permission to see the sweep which be very kind and erm i think in the end they probably think my glands possibly have be tb and i be poorly probably from about oh i don't know four four five months erm i be off school and erm i remember that christmas you know we didn't have a lot of toy or anything like that i mean you just couldn't buy them we be all on ration book and one of the things you know we have be a toyshop mummy say erm be there something i would really like for christmas i could just have one thing and say oh mummy i would really like a dolly erm be it possible with the coupon to get a dolly so she say we'll i'll erm when i'm down i'll call in the toyshop and we'll see if we can get one for you well she come home but erm no there be no they there be not enough erm in the ration book to get a dolly and they erm we couldn't manage one but if i would like there be one thing they could manage for me with what we'd get and that be i don't know we probably wouldn't be allow to say the word now but it be a gollywog and it have a little black face with erm nice smile red lips and sort of fluffy black hair erm so i say oh yes please that would that would be lovely so for that christmas erm i have a gollywog which be my pride and joy and my love for many many years and erm it be just super it do the trick it be not a dolly but it be just lovely and i be so much appreciate it so that's another little memory erm and while i be so poorly i be not erm you know i have special food and drink and that sort of thing and i know i be on tablets call m and b tablets erm which be i suppose the ones they could only ones they could give me for antibiotics and i'm afraid to say that erm i be a little bite naughty on occasion i didn't want to take this medicine erm i shouldn't've play up but erm i think i do and erm i know when mother have a one of the neighbour round and they be try to persuade me to get down this horrible stuff which erm mum use to crush erm i suppose it be tablets which have to be crush down she crush them down to like a little powder and to try and get me to take it erm they have we have one pot of jam erm per month erm and so i be give a teaspoon of jam to eat with all this crush white powder in it er it be erm it be not nice at all but erm somehow it get it it be put down me anyway whether i like it or i didn't like it i it have to be do erm so erm i have it and we have nice things like gruel i remember
S0507	erm and in the war you know butter erm be very very scarce we have erm sort of i think one half a pound a month erm and then we have the block margarine and my grandmother you know to make things go round would erm spread one slice thinly with butter and then one slice thinly with margarine and it would be cut up well my crafty brother two years older than me erm if he could get his hand on the bread first he would see that he get the bread with the butter on
S0507	and i and i be leave with the one with the erm the margarine erm so that's another little memory erm and i remember my brother and i you know for play game erm we have a large table in our din room and we have erm could have a long cloth over it erm might've be a sheet mother provide i can't quite remember but anyway it go down to the floor so brother and i use to have this like a little house inside and we use to play could we go and play game in the house and mother would get it all erm organise for us and that be great fun erm i can remember on one occasion when probably we'd be play up erm and it be very very rare but i can remember my mother chase us around the chase us around the house we'd be naughty about something but i can't quite remember what but erm that sort of stick out in my memory so that's my young childhood memories i think erm of young childhood yeah
S0486	well thank you very much they're very you obviously have a very nice childhood didn't you erm and er er you know erm wonderful would that be call an anderson shelter the one you be in
S0507	i think it do
S0486	yes it may have be an anderson that's the only shelter i know the name of basically
S0507	yes i think yes yes i think it be
S0486	yeah and
S0507	yes
S0486	and if you could see your lodger now how would
S0507	yes
S0486	you describe her if you could if she walk into the room today
S0507	yes
S0486	what would you how would you describe her
S0507	well obviously i would describe her as i last know her erm i would say medium height sort of light brown hair erm blueish eye erm and a lovely smile and always sort of a very erm happy demeanour in the house and very kind and helpful
S0486	and do you know what sort of job she do at those in those days or be you too young to know that
S0507	no i do know erm because where erm we live be not too far i suppose from er the factories that erm be in the nearby town be change for wartime work and some of them build erm well i don't know whether it be erm bomb make things but things that the germans erm would want to bomb if they could to stop
S0486	right
S0507	the production
S0486	right
S0507	so she be in what we would call today i suppose war work
S0486	right
S0507	it wasn't her normal job but erm everybody have to if they could have to come on for war work
S0486	right right and do you think erm your brother for instance who have that rather nasty erm illness earlier on
S0507	mm
S0486	do you think it weaken him for the rest of his life or do you think that be it that be just a period he get over it and he get better
S0507	well as a child i would say i be the sturdy one
S0486	right
S0507	erm strong my brother be more what i would've think be a bite sort of a erm more of a weakling really erm and he be very fussy about what he eat erm i will say erm he be bring up on bread and marmalade sandwich because
S0486	right
S0507	that's the only thing i remember him erm see him erm erm eat it probably wasn't because erm you know grandmother and mother be very good cook particularly for the main meal of the day and erm i mean in those days they be not give all these choices but you be good give good meals erm and everybody have to eat them
S0486	yes
S0507	erm and that be it er but in his adult life erm i would say he become the really strong one and sturdy one erm and have really no ill health for the rest of his life
S0486	cor that's marvellous isn't it
S0507	where erm mm where i be more erm well not so strong as he be
S0486	no
S0507	no
S0486	er it's funny because i'm sure live on er marmalade sandwich when he be younger for a long time and he and he also strangely enough wear a duffle coat all the time so really maybe he
S0507	mm
S0486	be a a sort of paddington bear really
S0507	yes
S0486	because marmalade sandwich
S0507	yes
S0486	be really the food of paddington bear aren't they so
S0507	absolutely under his hat he always carry them didn't he
S0507	erm and last time i be up at paddington railway station with my brother erm we sit very close to the lovely statue which they've get
S0486	oh yes
S0507	of paddington bear erm on sort of the erm
S0486	concourse up there
S0507	it's yes the concourse of the erm of the station
S0486	and brunel's there as well now isn't he
S0507	that's yes
S0486	yes mm
S0507	yes so erm yes that's a memory too
S0486	it be and
S0507	and course when i travel on the train as erm youngsters it be the steam train and one remember you know they have a special sound really the steam train erm different to what the diesel and the electric ones
S0486	definitely
S0507	have today and if the windows be open then we get you know quite a lot of black erm speck use to come in through the carriage windows and
S0486	yeah
S0507	quite smutty really erm it's much cleaner travel today er
S0486	you be always tell not to look out of the window weren't you never look never put your head out through the window
S0507	oh yes yes
S0486	always because of smut also other pass train but not to put your head out through the window
S0507	yes yes
S0486	er whereas today you don't really hear that be say do you really you don't nobody seem to say it
S0507	no no
S0486	it's common sense i suppose not to do it erm so erm i remember go on a train to erm down to the coast when we go over when i be seven we go over erm and we go on a steam train down to the coast down to dover and we go on a a ship go over to erm to france erm with all with all our army erm army people and their wive basically and i remember be cram into this really small cabin with my mother there and i remember the steward bring her a cup of tea in the morning and it be stone cold erm which be quite well it wasn't funny for her but erm i remember she didn't like it erm what be the food that you have when you be a child what would you say your favourite meal be during those war years i mean apple crumble would that have be available i mean obviously in season apples
S0507	i can't really remember apple crumble when i be erm a child although have say that i've have a lovely piece today which be very very nice erm
S0486	oh
S0507	but that's quite beside the point isn't it
S0486	yeah
S0507	erm erm i can remember we have erm we didn't have egg very much erm we have erm dry egg powder in erm war years erm er we didn't have a fridge of course so erm most of erm you know sort of meat be buy on a very regular basis from the butcher and erm grandmother use to make nice home make bread i remember erm vegetables we grow in the garden where we could and erm my father have a little orchard and erm
S0486	mm
S0507	we have apple tree and plum tree erm and we he have a an area for raspberries and gooseberries and redcurrants all that sort of thing erm and we use to make a lot of jam erm which be erm very nice
S0486	ah
S0507	so erm yes just fresh wholesome food i think really
S0486	mm people be
S0507	particularly after the war you know when the ration be lift a bite
S0486	yeah
S0507	erm
S0486	people be much fitter during the war they're say that now because of the ration not so much fat not so much sugar
S0507	yes yes that's right
S0486	erm and therefore not so many erm health problems
S0507	no
S0486	heart problems diabetes didn't much then
S0507	no
S0486	no obesity really
S0507	no i can't remember any obese people at all as a child erm that would've be erm a real rarity there's one thing though i think have improve erm be you know with we use to have perhaps a penny of pocket money and we use to like to go down to the sweetie shop i remember there be a sweets be ration but as long as you save up your ration erm and teeth really suffer because that seem to be the thing one like to spend one's pocket money on and and of course we didn't have any fluoride in the water or in the toothpaste or anything like that so erm our teeth didn't keep near as well as erm
S0486	no
S0507	children do children's teeth do today
S0486	yeah yeah erm well we i remember when i go to school we have penny chew and things like that and it be you know they're absolutely awful for your teeth erm you know but we have them erm but then we didn't get much pocket money so we we
S0507	no
S0486	we didn't get them very often so shall we end it there do you think
S0507	thank you very much
S0486	thank you very much that's great so we didn't thirty three minutes thirteen second
S0486	right oh
S0507	that's not too bad then
S0486	no no
S0507	that's not too bad then be it dear
S0486	no no stop record
