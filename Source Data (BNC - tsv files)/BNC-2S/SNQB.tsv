S0442	do she know who you be then when you say
S0320	when i say i'm she say oh do you know what she say she say do you know what i've hear so much about you i think i would recognise you instantly
S0442	bless her
S0320	but yeah we're in a really interest talk actually a clil which be really good erm by the same guy that do the erm fce talk but he be a lot better and he be talk about his own thing erm and yeah yeah we just have a chat and she say why haven't you work at it be a bite weird for me at the conference cos kaplan be there be there be there be all there and i be like oh like and also some people kaplan from kaplan in salisbury be there as well so i get to scope out the guy who i'm probably go to have to have some contact with this summer which be quite good because they're always notoriously difficult
S0442	mm
S0320	and the principal who i've meet on various occasion have lot of conversations with either didn't recognise me or didn't want to talk to me which be fine because he's not but yeah it be a bite odd especially like so who do you work for then i be like last year i work for and they're probably go to expect me to work there next year and secretly i'm go to go and work for but really i'd like to go and work for so you know it's all just a bite it be it be really good but it be a bite weird
S0442	mm
S0320	erm yes so i talk to and she say why haven't you work at and i just say well i don't know which i don't know why i haven't then i'd work everywhere else so yeah yeah that be it really but yeah it be nice and she be talk about she be go back into the classroom
S0442	be that what she say
S0320	teach students yeah
S0442	be she
S0320	that's what she say and she describe it as a demotion
S0442	she yeah she's all over the place
S0320	yeah
S0442	at the moment
S0320	i also saw the other sunday at this christmas fair and she be like yes i'm go to manage and i sit there think that place next year until everyone find their feet sound like an absolute nightmare yeah
S0442	well 's new role be a bite of everyone's role
S0320	yeah that's yeah that's what she say
S0442	yeah and a lot of people weren't happy about it but
S0320	so a bite of everyone's who's then
S0442	a bite of everyone a bite of mine a bite of a bite of a bite of
S0320	okay
S0442	they just create this role for her and
S0320	yeah and how be you about it you've work with her quite a lot this year though haven't you you alright with it
S0442	we get on yeah well we get on really well
S0320	yeah so you're fine with a bite of because you've work together this year so you know what it's like work with her with you in your position and her not happy then
S0442	no
S0320	why not
S0442	she feel victimise at the moment
S0320	oh
S0442	she feel like
S0320	everything to do with work or not everything to do with work but she have to go off and do that job didn't she
S0442	yeah she feel that they're try to make her quit her job
S0320	okay
S0442	that they're push her out they're try to so
S0320	do you think they be
S0442	i don't know they're not make her feel very comfortable or welcome
S0320	but there's so few people that could do 's job well
S0442	but no one understand her job
S0320	i totally understand it
S0442	that's the problem
S0320	yeah you have to be yeah i would say i haven't meet them all 's the only one who can do it because you have to partly because you have to travel so much they'd be silly to try and push her out because other people aren't go to be able to do it you wouldn't be able to travel so much wouldn't be able to travel probably could do it but probably wouldn't want to
S0442	mm mm i know be do three out of the seven summer school and be do the others
S0320	well that's quite enough for though on the on the other hand like how be she gonna do seven summer school that's far too many just for her
S0442	mm
S0320	i bet she doesn't like that
S0442	no i don't think that's a problem erm i don't really know what the problem be
S0320	mm well but yes no it be nice to meet her but yeah the conference be really good out of all the years to miss you really shouldn't have miss this one it be really good it be actually genuinely good not just good for a southwest conference
S0442	okay
S0320	and most and lot of people who i speak to say talk be their talk be really good
S0442	mm
S0320	it's really interest so they have the new chair or chief exec whoever he be of english uk who be kind of blah blah blah blah blah blah you know like they be erm until this really pompous guy ask the most stupidest question which be really long wind and clearly design to test this guy's knowledge and trip him up so he say well you say this but obviously accord to so and so's research from 1985 blah blah blah oh it be awful and the guy the guy that be do the plenary very politely very thoroughly completely slam him it be brilliant it be really good
S0442	oh good
S0320	erm so he be really interest and then
S0442	wasn't there
S0320	be there in the afternoon he be wasn't say particularly groundbreaking but as always have a slightly different slant on things it be he be talk about erm that he'd read some book and therefore be talk about it in the term of the book that he'd read but yeah and how we learn and stuff but yeah he be interest it be at the end of the day though so it's a bite much
S0442	bite brain dead
S0320	yeah erm and i go to a talk on about teach advance learners which be really interest
S0442	oh yeah
S0320	with a guy who's a doctor i think he's write quite a lot of course book
S0442	his wife die last year and that's why he didn't go
S0320	oh
S0442	that's why the one the other one get cancel last year erm how to make the best out of your team
S0320	he do that this year
S0442	yeah
S0320	oh i didn't realise he be suppose to go last year oh god well he do both of those this year how to make the best of your team i talk to about that it sound interest however he be come at it from the point of view of work in a university
S0442	oh
S0320	where you have minimum the minimum length of course be what four weeks erm so it's quite different for have a permanent team of teachers as oppose to have a very fluid team of teachers
S0442	yes
S0320	it's interest though they'd erm i think i might do try and implement a couple of at the summer school actually one of things they do be to have certain things that you have each lesson so erm every teacher put a list of ten vocabulary word on the board and they all put them in the same place so either on the right hand side or the leave hand side each lesson have three aim erm at the begin of the lesson you write at the top of the board and they'd also introduce things like colour uniformity so you use colour for the same things so
S0442	that's what we try to do for the inspection week
S0320	oh just for the inspection week
S0442	well
S0442	the inspectors be there well it's something that come up lead to because we do so many workshops lead to this
S0320	yes yeah
S0442	and one of the things be to standardise the way we do we mark stress for example
S0320	yes yeah exactly
S0442	because if you have a teacher then you go and get another teacher and the other teacher do it a different way it's just
S0320	well yeah i think erm it sound it sound interest erm and one of the benefit i think be when the students come and say well i don't like my teacher i don't feel like i'm learn enough if there's a clash of personalities he can go well actually i know that all the teachers do this in their class so the kind of the director of study have a clear idea of what's actually go on and can talk to the students go well i know what's happen in your class because it happen in every class be nice i think i might try and they they'd do it as a negotiate thing with the permanent with the sort of permanent teachers so so they've negotiate all of these different things and without standardisation but with a summer school that's not really go to be possible i didn't want to have have to impose it because there's not time to negotiate with the teachers and if you've get an inexperienced teacher then they don't really know yeah i think i might talk to the and implement it have it as a top down thing you must do it like this i think although i think one of the london school be go to have the director of study and possibly some teachers from the london kaplan school so i'm sure they won't do it
S0320	but yeah no i didn't go to that one i go to what do i go to when that one on i go to teach advance learners and clil i go to a clil talk which be really interest by that guy he be wear a turquoise silk shirt with a gold and black waistcoat it be i be like not what you look like yesterday that be really interest erm not really offer money solutions to problems but interest
S0442	mm
S0320	and then i go to one on storytelling
S0442	ah
S0320	which be really interactive like almost i almost didn't go because he i walk in and it be all set up in a horseshoe and i be like oh no we're go to actually have to do something it be really nice though he's part of the charity call the philosophy foundation so partly storytelling it wasn't anything majorly interest but it be mostly discuss philosophical ideas
S0442	ah
S0320	trick people trick the students into discuss philosophical ideas it be very interest actually it be all really good i be really surprise i didn't go last year and then this year it be great
S0442	okay so what freebies do you get
S0320	no bloody ticket
S0442	no
S0320	i be really annoy just load of pen and book and i don't know but no ticket i be i be quite annoy by that
S0442	what do say about the guy that get run over
S0320	erm that they the school be close on friday morning out of respect that because he be here with his brother there be two of them and the body be still in or another but they're sixteen brothers i think brothers possibly brothers and sisters erm i i cover a class one the day that go off to hospital and cover a test day for one of the teachers down at down at a hotel on the seafront erm maybe
S0442	uh huh
S0320	really nice
S0442	yeah
S0320	so i cover that and the two boys be in that class and after they finish their test we just have a chat with them they be very sweet yemeni boys not saudi but i think they possibly live in saudi
S0442	oh i think they be saudi
S0320	yemeni so really hard work and sweet not your typical lazy arse saudi boys erm and they they've the school have be in in contact with the mosque in so take lot of advice from about how to handle everything and how to deal with it so the two the two boys be here they have some cousins in plymouth of course and another brother have fly over to help deal with everything really sad
S0442	it be really sad
S0320	i i could only remember one of them because i just teach them i just have them in the class once and i i'm not sure which one it be but they be just both very didn't cheat once in the test there be three of them sit in this hotel room and me no cheat whatsoever like none it be totally unprecedented
S0442	do you know any of the detail of
S0320	no i no
S0442	because who be on the mobile phone the driver or him
S0320	i don't know that i i only know what i read in the herald express the other day and what have tell me i don't know that many detail someone be on the phone though
S0442	well that's what i've hear i don't know if it's true because
S0320	yeah it just could've be either of them really couldn't it but it be just
S0442	where be it
S0320	just
S0442	because i hear that he be the driver be blind by the sun
S0320	yeah i remember you tell me that it hasn't be very sunny recently though have it not exactly blind sunshine weather be it
S0442	when you come round that bend and the sun's
S0320	which bend be it
S0320	which one's that
S0442	you know where the train station be
S0320	be it be it on the pedestrian cross or sort of between the two pedestrian cross
S0442	between the two i think
S0320	it be so hard to drive fast around there
S0442	mm
S0320	be he not drive very fast
S0442	i don't think so no
S0320	but that's quite hard to it's quite hard to a drive fast and b hit someone in that short space because you've get the pedestrian cross then you've get the oh dear
S0442	mm
S0320	no i don't really i don't know anything else other than that
S0442	and his poor family
S0320	yeah so sad
S0442	and the driver have get to live with that
S0320	yeah but why be they appeal for witness cos i i think it might've be a hit and run but then they say the forty two year old man blah blah blah blah blah but there be they be still appeal for witness
S0442	i guess to see if anyone be on their phone if he be look the right way
S0320	mm
S0442	erm if there be any other cars that might have cause him to
S0320	yeah
S0442	swerve
S0320	i suppose i think erm i think his brother be with him do you tell me that
S0442	yeah
S0320	yeah yeah must be yeah devastate and so unexpected as well because whenever you talk to them i'm go to do this i'm go to university then i'm go to go home and ah you know i think he be eighteen i don't think he be sixteen
S0442	really i think he be sixteen
S0320	yeah i'm pretty sure he be
S0442	i think he be sixteen
S0320	yeah i don't think he be sixteen i know age tend to be quite fluid with the erm with the arabic boys but i'm pretty sure he wasn't sixteen even though it say so in the paper i don't i really don't think he be possibly seventeen or eighteen but i'm pretty sure he wasn't sixteen he never come up in any of the safeguard things which he'd have to if you're sixteen so i'm pretty sure they get it wrong i don't think he be sixteen unless of course they lie which be always possible
S0442	yeah
S0320	yeah right then shall we go into town
S0442	yeah
S0320	what time be it what have we get to do in town
