S0315	yeah
S0255	whereas for for me this this be nice i enjoy it and it's relax and it's sort of do something rather than the relax you know what i mean the pamper side
S0315	mm yeah so it's do something actually for your body isn't it

S0315	inside
S0255	yeah that's right
S0315	okay so let's see right okay how have you be sleep

S0315	yeah
S0255	and it's obviously you know tag rugby and stuff like that but
S0315	yeah
S0255	and say she be really impress because of the way the coach be with the kid er start them off and explain every single bite of how how you do this and how when you're do that in the scrum you have to be exactly like that cos if you don't you might hurt your neck you might hurt this when you're come in for a tackle this be how come into the big pad do it like this you need to get your shoulder right down and tuck your arm and your you know so she say they be explain all these bits which mean that he'll be safer do it rather than just run round and bash
S0315	you do wonder don't you how they protect themselves as much as they do because it's pretty physical stuff isn't it
S0255	oh yeah i mean come back most match he's fine he's get you know stuff mark where people have stamp on him and scrap and cut
S0315	they just carry on don't they
S0255	that's fine but after this last one he say he erm he's hurt his neck a bite erm and he say he actually get kneed in the head by somebody accidently or whatever but get kneed in the head
S0315	yeah
S0255	and then something and he say he and he go down and they be say oh be it a neck injury cos he be hold his neck and he say no no i'm fine he say jump up start go round and then he say he be run round think where be i go what be i do and they actually take him off for a few minutes
S0315	he be a bite stun
S0255	cos he be a bite yeah erm but then he say ah i'm fine and go back on and he have a headache afterwards but
S0315	yeah yeah always use to come back so he be ah he just use to come back he you could tell when he'd be play he'd rugby come in the door like this
S0255	yeah
S0315	and for days afterwards and i say look you've just get to face it you're too old
S0255	yeah
S0315	to play now you're too old
S0255	yeah you need to get him to the vet and have an easier game
S0315	yeah you're not yeah definitely
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	because play against work and he'll be play erm because he play for work but what they do be they play like erm local erm er prison service or whatever
S0255	mm
S0315	you know and some of them be quite big guy
S0255	oh yeah
S0315	i mean 's quite big but he's not really what you'd call muscly
S0255	no no
S0315	he's not really that fit to be honest
S0255	what position do he play
S0315	hooker
S0255	oh right
S0315	so he's in the scrum isn't it
S0255	yeah i think yeah on the edge but i think
S0315	start play he's be play for the last couple of season actually he really enjoy it he go to something call little scrummers at the er rugby club
S0255	oh yeah
S0315	yeah and he's erm
S0255	yeah
S0315	he enjoy it i mean he's i think it's more about show them the discipline of the game to start with isn't it cos they're just run around all over the place
S0255	yeah it's yeah yeah
S0315	jump on the coach back honestly some of them be little beggar
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	they're naughty and the parent don't say anything
S0255	no no
S0315	but he's a nice coach but sometimes i think he do get a bite mad with them
S0255	yeah i suppose he's let them
S0315	just let them go for a little bite
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	and then all of a sudden he'll just like you know say right get off the pitch
S0255	yeah yeah yeah i mean rugby be really good with the the discipline of it as you say it's
S0315	mm
S0255	you know you you see them like even the adults and stuff and on the all the match on telly and yes sir no sir to the referee and when the referee say and
S0315	yeah not like football
S0255	oh no no
S0315	totally differently
S0255	no no
S0315	yeah so i have a lot of respect for rugby players more than i do football i must say
S0255	yeah
S0315	he start play football so i think it's just a matter of decide what he want to do but i think would prefer him to go be into rugby
S0255	yeah
S0255	yeah i must admit rugby be i i think that with i mean we keep say that with with
S0315	do you
S0255	yeah he ought to be do rugby buy him a little tiny rugby ball when he be a baby as well
S0315	yeah
S0255	but his dad be an absolute massive football fan
S0315	be he
S0255	oh oh and in fact he play almost like professionally erm until he hurt his knee when he be in his twenties so erm
S0315	yeah
S0255	so he's like mad keen on football and he take take to a lot of man unite game and
S0315	so it's good that he's into both isn't it
S0255	the game oh yeah
S0315	as well
S0255	yeah yeah yeah
S0315	not just prefer the one but i wonder if he ever have to choose between the two what he would choose
S0255	yeah be dad keep say about rugby it's just a phase the boy will grow out of it it's just a phase
S0315	ah
S0255	and we all start tease him no no no no
S0315	know what i prefer
S0255	yeah yeah well say she prefer the rugby she say the the way the kid be when they play it she say even the parent at the side of the pitch she say you know you're stand at the football things and yeah there's people they're nice and you're get on with them but she say some of them
S0255	yeah

S0315	i didn't get to go this year
S0255	no that's painful there
S0315	that's your lung area in there but then again it run into your neck which be just in that spot
S0255	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0315	yeah that's your neck
S0255	yeah so yeah that's it so
S0315	yeah all under that bite there be your neck
S0255	yeah
S0315	it's amaze isn't it the reflexology
S0255	yeah it's like everything sort of hurt at the minute
S0315	yeah i bet you're really aware of what your body be do
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	sometimes your feet can be just tender all over
S0255	mm maybe you've just get strong finger
S0315	i'm not hurt you
S0255	no no not
S0315	sure
S0255	yeah no i to be honest if i'm have something do i'd rather have it do properly
S0315	rather have it rather have it do yeah
S0255	if i have a massage i i like to really feel it
S0315	have some firm treatment not be tickle
S0255	yeah no
S0315	nothing worse be there
S0255	be your hand affect by all the massage you do
S0315	no not yeah wrist
S0255	yeah
S0315	yeah wrists be erm sometimes i get a few shoot pain but i think after the years of do it i think i've get use to it
S0255	mm mm
S0315	you know it's more my back i've get a trap nerve at the moment
S0255	oh have you
S0315	so i'm have to have treatment on that yeah cos that's
S0255	yeah
S0315	be give me gyp but erm i go last night so erm it's help
S0255	mm
S0315	but it be give me gyp
S0255	i suppose you've always get to be so careful how you bend and what you do cos you spend a lot of time
S0315	i know and i'm i'm not i just i'm not
S0255	no
S0315	up on it i should be but i'm not sometimes i massage far too low than what i should do because i like to be able to put my weight through my arm
S0255	yeah
S0315	so i'm almost lean into them for the for the pressure but that isn't really do my back any good
S0255	yeah mm mm
S0315	because i'm bend over too far with the pressure
S0255	mm could you stand on something have a slight like a long step thing you can put next to the bed
S0315	could do cos i mean i come up and down
S0255	and you be just slightly higher yeah
S0315	i mean i can lift this up but i don't like them to be too high because i then i feel like i'm not be able to put my pressure through properly
S0255	mm
S0315	do that make sense
S0255	yeah yeah but if you be actually just stand on something you would actually just be at a different angle and lean at a different weight onto it
S0315	yeah that might help try it she say get as close to the couch as possible and then what you do be you're bend from your hips then not lean over
S0255	yeah yeah that's the thing you've get to just be really conscious the next so many time you do it to get in a different position and once you do that you'll remember won't you then and
S0315	yeah yeah and then it become second nature
S0255	yeah mm
S0315	no i've be a bite naughty think it doesn't help pick up you know
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	cos you're always pick up kids' stuff on the floor aren't you
S0255	oh yeah
S0315	and all that so that's probably do a lot of it
S0255	start do that breathe that you say you know the
S0315	yes
S0255	in seven out eleven
S0315	the seven yeah seven eleven breathe
S0255	yeah
S0315	how do you find it
S0255	the first the first couple of days i keep remember and then what i find be if something be maybe a bite stressful i start do it then and then i do it the next day and then i totally forget until today that i'd be do it
S0315	really do it without think
S0255	no no as in i'd forget to do it
S0315	yeah
S0255	so cos it have just go out of my mind that i be even mean to be do it
S0315	yeah
S0255	but i think today right now i must remember and start yeah
S0315	do it like just take yourself off cos you know
S0255	yeah
S0315	just practise about
S0255	i find i be do it as i be drive
S0315	yeah
S0255	cos that be a a good thing thing i'm drive i'll actually get in the routine of do that
S0315	good
S0255	not that drive stress me but it's just a a routine of something you do quite regularly
S0315	a time to do yeah
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	and you can still concentrate can't you
S0255	yeah that's why i do pelvic floor exercise
S0315	yeah yes
S0255	when i'm drive yeah
S0315	yes cos erm that's really important isn't it
S0255	yeah
S0315	something i should do
S0255	add it to the lose
S0315	i don't like do them i find it weird
S0255	do you
S0315	yeah
S0255	i remember be about fourteen and read something it must have be like jackie magazine or something this be a good idea to get into the habit of do now girls and i i just start do them then
S0315	and that's it
S0255	and i've i've do it right through my life yeah
S0315	go
S0255	and that's what they've always say i've get
S0315	strong pelvic muscle
S0255	i've get really good yeah
S0315	so obviously when you have your baby
S0255	yeah
S0315	do you have caesareans or natural birth

S0255	yeah yeah yeah they keep them there and then when we move to i say to them yep this be where we're gonna stay now yeah i think if you want to go to the local school you can have a think cos i start to give them as much so they have some choice cos obviously they'd be sort of one day just suddenly now yeah i think if you want to go to the local school you can have a think cos i start to give them as much so they have some choice cos obviously they'd be sort of one day just suddenly get in a car we're go to to stay with your auntie
S0315	yeah
S0255	oh now we're go into the refuge in oh now we've be find by matey therefore we've get to go to another refuge in now you're go to this school so they they have so much that they couldn't control so i i say you know if you like we can go and look at the local school and if you like it you can go if not you can stay go to this to where you're go now
S0315	yeah
S0255	right the way through and then obviously there be the secondary school after it so they both go we'll go and have a look we'll go and have a look and we go and look round you know the school and they seem to like it and they they both say we want to come here we want to be able to walk to school we want to do this we want to of that
S0315	brilliant
S0255	so i say okay and that be again they be sort of six and seven age but i just i think yeah that's fine you know so i go in and thank the school very much and they say they be really please with how they'd get on and they be settle
S0315	great really come round
S0255	mm and that be the other reason why when when they be leave primary school they could've take the exams to go to school again i be tell both of them you know they should pass the exams no problem they'd get in there
S0315	yeah
S0255	and i say to them do you want to take the exams do you want to go you know you can go to we can go and look at it or you can go to and they both when it get to their time say we want to stay with the friends we've make we don't want to start move and make more friends again fine you know
S0315	yeah just go with what they want to do
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	do they go to
S0255	yeah they go to yeah
S0315	be that quite good at the time
S0255	yeah it be actually cos i think it have have a time of not be brilliant
S0315	mm
S0255	erm and then there be a new headmaster or somebody come in and make it better and
S0315	yeah
S0255	yeah i think
S0315	so they sort of have their last years there okay
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	yeah
S0255	and i think to be honest school be what kid get out of it
S0315	yeah
S0255	i mean when they be really little in and that be all a bite cos it be chaotic at the time but once you get into secondary school if the kid be go to put in the work they can get out what their potential be
S0315	absolutely
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	it's a good sport college up there isn't it
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	up at erm
S0255	be that where your two will go
S0315	i don't know because they be on about build another school over
S0255	oh be they
S0315	which be go to be call so literally behind us
S0255	okay oh right yeah
S0315	so and will be in catchment for that as well
S0255	mm
S0315	but you know what will happen there've be far too many house on on the new bite across the way and they won't be able to fit us in i think
S0255	no no yeah no but you'll be in the catchment for as well here wouldn't you
S0315	yes
S0255	that's another thing cos
S0315	yeah but that i mean hopefully by that point my mine go to senior school that would've turn itself round cos that's obviously special measure at the moment
S0255	isn't that a very good one no oh be it oh i don't know
S0315	yeah
S0255	i once your kid leave school you sort of you're out the loop a bite
S0315	you're out you be out the loop yeah i mean the er head he erm i think he be on his way out really but he be just bid a bite of time and erm you know things be just have just get into a bite of a state
S0255	mm
S0315	so they're just go in and have to sort it out
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	so but usually after you know they pay so much more attention to it it turn round quite quickly
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	so it's not always a bad thing really
S0255	no no
S0315	it's like well in that's in special measure as well so
S0255	be it
S0255	yeah but again it's turn itself round so
S0255	yeah yeah i think erm years ago school have the same teachers and same head teachers for years and years and years and they be a set school you have your grammars your comprehensives your all girls all boys
S0315	yeah
S0255	you know secondary modern school or whatever and they they be very steady and they just carry on be the same the same the same
S0315	mm
S0255	and now everything's all mix up and chop and change
S0315	yeah
S0255	teachers come and go head head teachers come and go
S0315	people can't cope with it
S0255	it no no ad there's so much bureaucracy and paper work and and ofsted and what's need
S0315	ah it's crazy
S0255	yeah
S0315	i don't know how any of these teachers do it
S0255	no
S0315	i really don't i really don't no i think your dead right there completely agree they don't know whether they're come or go half the time
S0255	no
S0315	cor that's crunchy across there that's your fallopian tube
S0255	yeah be it
S0315	yeah
S0255	oh yeah i'm just fall to bits at the minute
S0315	you've still get your shell
S0255	yeah yeah yeah just fall off inside it's all just go horribly wrong
S0315	it's like you can just imagine like bits fail off a clock or something can't you
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	all the mechanisms
S0255	yeah yeah the spring all go dong dong
S0315	yeah spring like go ding
S0255	and then the number six turn into a number nine or whatever
S0315	yeah it start turn round and then and then the hand's fall off it's like that's a bite how i feel at the moment
S0255	yeah that's about right never mind it's start snow in
S0315	have it
S0255	yeah they've put some picture on
S0315	well i well i see you put a picture of that that really nice one of you on the the
S0255	ah yeah
S0315	yeah and i think ah i wonder if that's cos you're get ready to go ski
S0255	no that be because it be monday and i be really feed up
S0315	be you
S0255	and cos at that time i didn't know what when the new op be go to be
S0315	yeah
S0255	and have my op if i'd have it monday i might have be able to do a bite of gentle ski when i go christmas new year time
S0315	so you don't reckon you'll be able to ski now

S0315	where's it's different from the dry ski
S0255	yeah
S0315	like completely
S0255	yeah yeah it's it's like imagine go and slide a long with with your shoe on slide across a carpet or slide on a wood floor if you go and slide it's that different so if you've get your sock on a carpet and your yeah or your sock on a wood floor it's just that little bite of
S0315	yeah yeah yeah

S0315	that's what i wouldn't like
S0255	no and they've be
S0315	do you like them now
S0255	oh yeah no i be never bother with heights erm
S0315	yeah
S0255	i just love look round at all the scenery so
S0315	yeah yeah
S0255	so it be fine erm so that they sort of they'd ask where they could go once they get go and the guy say well at the end of the week you could maybe go up that chairlift get off at cos you get part way up and there's a a bump you can get off there or go up to the top
S0315	oh okay so you can keep go as far as you want to go
S0255	yeah yeah with this one most of them they're not most of them you go start to finish but this particular one you could go up so far so then you could just get off or you carry on
S0315	right
S0255	so he say oh by the end of the week you might manage that so five minutes after he'd go and his mate decide i've have enough of this little baby slope and they're go to go on this it's the the girlfriend of or it's his wife now but of the other guy she say oh yeah i'll have a go and i'm like don't be stupid i'm stay here i'm just get the hang of move i'm get hold of that rope i'm not gonna go and oh right right
S0315	i'm not let go
S0255	honestly yeah i'm fine off you go so they disappear off i do a few more time and then i think oh i'll sit and have a break and then i'll have another go and i sit at this café and i look and i could just see climb down this bite erm and it wasn't the bite you're slide it be off the slide bite with all the snow and she be throw her ski down and then climb down throw her ski down climb down and then she appear down oh i'm never go ski again in my entire life oh
S0255	and apparently they'd go up there on how do we get on it i don't know get on the ski thing how do you get off it i don't know and sort of fell off and manage to get off half way up this thing start look and go oh you do a bite of this oh it it's a bite scary oh it's a bite steep and then sort of think oh 's get the hang of it she be fly down really really well which be fine until she actually start fall because she couldn't really do it she just get out of control and her old man go
S0315	yeah how do she stop how do you stop
S0255	well she just fell and she be lay on the floor her old man go to get her and get hold of her under the ankle er ankles armpits pull her round so her ski be go the right way and then he sort of she slip a bite and and he let go of her so she's then go down on her back on her ski so she's lay down like with the the ski go
S0255	yeah go ah she be and then she actually
S0315	sound like something out a comedy
S0255	yeah then i know and erm there's and be laugh roll laugh she's go down sort of go ah get me out one of the ski come off she then manage to stop somehow cos they weren't even on a big slope it be you know the beginner bite so
S0315	yeah and you be watch all this though
S0255	oh i didn't see all this no no i be do my little round in circle and then i stop to have a drink so she then take off her other ski never f ing ski again in my f ing life and that's it de de de
S0315	and do she
S0255	no no she then climb down and she never ski again that be it
S0315	do she ever
S0255	no no no
S0315	never go with you again you two
S0255	no totally that be it
S0315	put her off
S0255	yeah so she come and sit in the café bite with me i then go and say right i'm gonna do well then and come down and start tell me what have happen with and they be laugh so much they be cry and she's a real good sport she be laugh about it as well
S0315	yeah yeah
S0255	like she be just like that's fine i'm quite happy i'm go to sit here with my book and my hot chocolate i be like right
S0255	so then i say right and then say well come on he say honestly the bite we come down isn't too bad be it and she say no it isn't she say i just get go it wrong i've scar myself now and say well i'm gonna stay with and say ah come on come on come up it's alright i'll help you down i and i be like alright then alright then you know think cos i've more or less get the bite i be do okay okay
S0315	yeah
S0255	so we go to the chairlift and i say how do you get on the chairlift then he's like well you just sit as it come and so yeah it it come and we sit and then we put the bar down yeah that be fine and you're go up and i be think oh i say well how do you get off he say well you just sort of stand up as as you get to this bump you your ski touch the snow and then you stand up and you go and then the chairlift carry on
S0315	so you go up with your ski on do you yeah
S0255	yeah yeah so you have your ski on
S0315	how do you get on with your ski on on the chairlift
S0255	cos it's
S0315	suppose it's come behind you and then you literally pop your bum on
S0255	yeah that's it cos it's it's either snow or the the bite you stand on it's like a mat bite so you don't you stop slide and you stand and yeah it come round and then it just you just sit down so you just look and you sit down on it it lift you up and then you just pull the bar down carry your pole
S0315	mm right
S0255	so then when you get to the other end the idea be you you lift it up and then there's a bump so as you get there you you're sit and your ski hit the the snow
S0315	yeah yeah
S0255	and then you stand up and go down this little bump here and go off to ski
S0315	you make it sound so easy
S0255	yeah so do he
S0315	and do you do it
S0255	no
S0315	no
S0255	it i i say to him how do you do it how and he's like you just stand up you just stand and i'm sort of no explain explain
S0255	and he say well you and i think right totally forget about it enjoy the view and i be just look round ah it be absolutely stun scenery
S0315	ah
S0255	so ah this be beautiful this be yeah yeah yeah right we're get nearer okay okay what do you do and i think i'm just cos i i learn by do so i think i'm gonna follow him half a second after he i'm gonna follow his movements so as he stand
S0315	you miss it
S0255	well he stand and then i so i just after i start to stand but obviously the chair be go so i didn't actually stand and it just take me and he stand and i carry on
S0315	and you go on
S0255	yeah and i lean over backwards go i didn't make it and he just say he just saw these ski go past his head think that's not good
S0315	oh no so he's think you've get to go round again
S0255	well i have to go right to the top which be the bite we weren't mean to be go on cos it be harder so
S0315	right you have to get do you have to get off there or can you just come round again
S0255	oh yeah no no you can't get off
S0315	you get to get off
S0255	yeah yeah yeah you have to get off so matey behind be at the where you get off be go put the bar down put the so i think okay put the bar down i think okay just enjoy the scenery so i i do you know and be sort of go stay at the top stay at the top and i be go yeah alright then think
S0315	so be he go to come up and follow you
S0255	that's what he say yeah so i be there look mm de de look at all the you know
S0315	just stand there and he's think why she's
S0255	yeah look at all the scenery yeah and then
S0315	do you get off alright though when you get to the top
S0255	no no no
S0315	that would i would've be you i would've do the same as you
S0315	i'd by oh my god
S0255	well i just get as i get towards the top and there be there be a woman there and i be sort of wave to her say i can't get off i i don't know so she slow the lift down i think bless her bless her and then i put the bar up and then she let go of the thing and the lift speed up again and i be like what and she come over and she put her arm out so i be like oh i think okay so i grab hold of her arm my ski hit the thing i stand up and then cos i be think ah i keep hold of her arm and i be pull she be headfirst backwards on her back i be pull her like this and she be go pe pe pe pe in french and i be go down go ah oh sorry sorry let go of her i be go i say i couldn't get off you know and then i have to stand
S0315	i'm surprise you go back
S0255	i have to stand at the top then just over there for ten minutes or so until have ski down this bite that he just about manage to do get back on it come all the way back up get to the top and then obviously he get off and like and there's this woman keep look over give me daggers and i'm like
S0315	oh no
S0255	so then he he come up and it's more or less the end of the day then and we're sort of say right we're at the top of this mountain you know
S0315	what do we do now
S0255	i know cos when we be think oh it's down like a fairly easy run but you be actually up a mountain you have to remember this so we're like right okay so we start go down okay first bite yeah not bad not bad and then all the cloud start to come in cos they do often at the end of the day so it's it's fog you can't see and it's like okay and 's very sort of shit or bust so he'd just head you know and he'd go yeah yeah i make it it's this way or and i'm edge down we be go across a bite across a bite
S0315	do it really slowly
S0255	yeah and then occasionally think no like go down on my bum
S0315	be people go down past you
S0255	there be people come yeah and and we and i be go down on my bum a bite down on my bum a bite and then it'd clear a bite i'd be like right a bite right a bite and then this skidoo things come down with the person from the lift they'd go up to get her and she'd go down and we suddenly think we know now normally that they come down and go down each each run to make sure it's clear
S0315	yeah
S0255	and and they just go down and leave us and it be just like so we be come down this thing didn't know where we be go you know edge down edge down and say they'd nearly call the search party out by the time that
S0315	where have they go
S0255	we'd either break legs or god know where we'd go and ah dear and we get down the bottom bite but actually by do it the bits that i do ski i think i do quite enjoy this but i be still quite scar so then from then i the next time we go up we only have a couple of days there on the next day have burn all his face cos you have to put sun cream on when it's sunny
S0315	and he didn't
S0255	yeah ad he didn't and didn't but she'd get moisturiser and make up which all have the spf in it

S0255	but but but yeah but but eh he say we're not go down it he say we start he say follow me exactly and he go across like that and he say now you turn and we go across and we just keep do that like a few time and then he say stop he say now look he say see what you've come down and he say you haven't come down you've go across he say if you're ever worry he say just go across you can't get faster go across and then you sort of do a little but but then you turn and that slow you and then you come across and it be like oh yeah so we do that and yeah i get i be still more nervous then i be okay ski and i'd do blue but i wouldn't do red and after a couple of holiday i still wouldn't do reds and keep go why not no no no
S0315	be he get into reds then
S0255	he'd want to do them but i wouldn't go with him a so he'd sometimes go with if we meet up with people he'd go with them but i be like no no i'm quite happy do my blue and then one night somebody say in the bar well they're not they're not reds i say what he say they're not red they're dark blue he say just think of that he say you get a a lot of red be easier than the hardest bits on the blue he say cos they cross over he say you've get a blue which be fairly easy and then it's get some harder bits it's easy harder easy harder the harder bits one the blue be harder than the easy bits on the red and i be like oh he say they're dark blue and the next day i go out and go alright let's do a dark blue then and i'm like alright then
S0315	okay
S0255	and we do
S0315	and you do
S0255	yeah and it be fine and it be easier that so so many bits of the blue that i'd do
S0315	and never look back isn't it funny so erm so you don't actually just go in a straight you do go in a straight line don't you
S0255	you you go
S0315	but you go
S0255	yeah side to side you sort of yeah like that
S0315	ah
S0255	or you can go more straight down and then you do this to slow yourself down or
S0315	so do you think after that it's just practice
S0255	yeah it be and it's get the technique right as well because we we sort of carry on from then and just do a lot of ski and get better but actually we should have have more lessons earlier on
S0315	right
S0255	because we get a lot of bad habit and bad ways whereas he's get a lot better ski technique than me erm and we have some lessons and he now be get more and more advance in how he's ski whereas i've i've still get certain bits that i'm not quite do right and i can't understand cos they say do this i i need to get once i've do it and it click into place i'll be alright but we can go down anywhere we do we do black reds everything erm
S0315	black now as well
S0255	oh yeah we do off piste we go
S0315	really
S0255	yeah yeah i mean off the side we're go along where you come to a mountain you can go along the top here and then actually ski down sort of next to the piste as such so yeah we do that sort of stuff and
S0315	so that as you say come from just you so how many years have you ski now
S0255	erm well probably about eight
S0315	really it's a long time now
S0255	yeah
S0315	and you just go every year do you
S0255	yeah and and go a few time every year
S0315	yeah yeah wow so it just show you can at any age doesn't it
S0255	yeah oh definitely
S0315	do you ever hurt yourself
S0255	erm oh i detach ligaments from this collar bone here erm i do that i've concuss myself a few time even with a helmet and
S0315	really what just hit something like
S0255	like no just hit it on the floor just even not go too fast just go back and actually i do a like a bedump like two hit thing when i go back which just i be only literally potter go from one leave thing to another and go go back and a concussions for a couple of days and
S0315	wow
S0255	but it's the same as any sport you can hurt yourself
S0315	yeah yeah
S0255	you know erm as i say well touch wood i've not
S0315	do anything any too serious and hasn't either
S0255	no no no he's er
S0315	so be the kid good now as well
S0255	yeah 's 's fairly good but she's she come about once a year or maybe twice a year so she's not as as good as we be but she quite enjoy it you know you know she ski fairly well and she's quite regularly have lessons which be what we say to her when we realise we should have have more lessons so we whenever she cos she'll always have a lesson every year erm hasn't be for a few years but he's come this this year
S0315	mm mm
S0255	he go about five years ago i think with a friend they go snowboard with the friend's family over in germany erm cos his dad have be in the force and he know somewhere there to go and they go and you know he he be snowboard and have a good time so he say he's probably forget how to do it
S0315	yeah
S0255	but he he just get on it and do when he be ski and snowboard so not necessarily the best technique i mean he might find it's a bite different this time cos he's a lot bigger now erm and he be always tall but he be tall and gangly more than anything whereas now
S0315	he's fill out a build more
S0255	yeah he's seventeen no sixteen stone now so he's he's big
S0315	mm mm
S0255	so he might find it's not quite as easy just to stand on it and head down
S0315	god he use to be tiny skinny didn't he
S0255	yeah yeah he do yeah he do
S0315	god
S0255	he's just he's totally fill out i mean cos he's a the gym as well and he's do you know he's

S0315	the body wrap look good i actually have the body wrap last week
S0255	yeah
S0315	and i actually do lose quite a few inch off my tummy and legs
S0255	yeah
S0315	so that's something that i'll probably cos you have to leave that on for an hour so you could do a facial
S0255	yeah
S0315	while that's on
S0255	oh yeah well if you want a guinea pig next week just
S0315	yeah i'll have to think cos i need to buy the stuff in
S0255	yeah
S0315	and then you just clean wrap them up and then lay them on the bed
S0255	yeah
S0315	that's it
S0255	yeah yeah yeah
S0315	so it's er look quite a good erm product
S0255	i know one of my friends do do something that i don't know what brand it be as such but she do that er and i think it be last christmas before we go to the work party she come round in the week before anybody that want it she do it like two or three people at a time at people's house and
S0315	oh
S0255	yeah she come she come and do mine and you you really could see
S0315	yeah
S0255	she say i lose the most in inch which she say for some of the people who be bigger you'd have think they'd lose more but she say because my waist be there quite be there quite define it really just suck that in
S0315	suck it in
S0255	and up here and yeah and she do sort of like the thighs and then all up just round here
S0315	how long do the result last for
S0255	erm i can't remember actually i mean it wasn't it's just one of these things that gradually come back doesn't it so
S0315	yeah you don't really see it do you
S0255	so no no but for the for the night it be brilliant and then for a few days afterwards my jeans i could tell be definitely looser and
S0315	mm
S0255	yeah go like that but i can't remember she still do it you know if i want it do she'd do it
S0315	yeah yeah
S0255	i'd need one on a regular basis at the minute with this
S0315	it's bloat isn't it
S0255	it be yeah it be
S0315	it's probably you're probably carry a a lot of water as well
S0255	yeah yeah
S0315	with all this
S0255	well this be why i go to the doctor in the first place cos my stomach be just get bigger and bigger and bigger and i get this pain
S0315	mm
S0255	and my stomach be get bigger and bigger and i get this pain and it just carry on and on and on and that's when i go and that's when i start do all these different test and scan and things and
S0315	then find
S0255	that's when they say
S0315	what they find
S0255	yeah they say it be it's the fibroids er but even the gyny nurse er consultant have say it doesn't normally give the pain that you've get but she say i think it's just press on something
S0315	mm
S0255	but she do say just to cover herself that it could end up be something else but she's you know she be happy that there's enough go on in there that could be give me this problem and therefore you know so
S0315	right
S0255	i just hope this'll get take out and it'll sort itself out cos they check like the scan and check and say all the bowel look fine and
S0315	good so nothing's like sort of attach itself or anything there
S0255	no no so they say all that look fine and
S0315	that's good then
S0255	yeah
S0315	so you just never do you
S0255	no this be it
