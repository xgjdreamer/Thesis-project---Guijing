S0255	right there you go so what be you say you've get plan for halloween
S0256	yeah i'm go to a murder mystery
S0255	where's that
S0256	at erm holiday inn sort of near i think but it's it's through work it's well it's it sort of be and sort of isn't there's like a group thing that they put on events or they they get ticket certain amount of ticket go for er certain events and things like that
S0255	okay
S0256	and then if you're part of this group you get them extra discount if you're not part of the group you get them discount so twenty pound and you get a three course meal and a murder mystery even and erm mention it and say do we wanna go erm and so i'm go 's gonna go and so's erm and her boyfriend and then a couple of other people be go as well
S0255	so be it just something that come round on like a work email that show
S0256	yeah er well it's there's like a folder like erm of events that er they have cos er they do all sort like trip to erm france like for the christmas market
S0255	oh right
S0256	and they do all sort of bits
S0255	so er so could you do it so like if one person decide they want to go from work they could go and join in cos it's a group like as in like the murder mystery's on
S0256	yeah yeah
S0255	so you don't have to get a certain amount of people
S0256	yeah usually yeah i think that's what it normally be
S0255	mm that sound really good
S0256	yeah so it'll be good i mean erm i might sign up to the actual group cos that get you er a lot cheaper and i think it's like fourteen pound if you're part of the group or
S0255	okay
S0256	or whatever or eleven pound or something it's only like one pound a month but
S0255	oh sound really good
S0256	yeah so it should be good fun so yeah i'm do that instead of just sit in for halloween like i normally do
S0255	and give sweets out to the few children that might come this far
S0256	yeah but no one ever do
S0256	not really
S0255	look marinate tuna
S0256	i can't really smell anything not properly
S0255	mm smell nice
S0255	smell nice
S0256	yeah i'm sure it smell nice i'm sure it taste nice
S0255	you just have the confidence in my cook
S0256	i yeah i just can't verify that right now
S0255	well i go to a murder mystery although er it's a few years ago now gosh a lot of years ago actually
S0256	yeah
S0255	i can't even remember i go with it be a group a group of er group of women and it be for for someone's birthday i think they'd just decide let's do something different and it be
S0256	yeah
S0255	and you go for the weekend and you actually have the time to go round as well as stay at the hotel and the actual murder mystery be just erm like one even of it
S0256	yeah
S0255	erm but you can do them where you actually go for a whole week i think or not a whole week a weekend
S0256	yeah
S0255	and it start and go over the weekend
S0256	that sound good
S0255	but i tell you something actually bite of a tip erm what they actually say be afterwards we could've actually go and ask them question not as in who be it but we could've maybe ask the people that be do it and the character you you could actually ask them some quite obvious question i can't even think what it be but they say that if we'd ask this they would've tell us so and so or if the if we'd ask so and so
S0256	yeah because i think you all tend to get like a card don't you with information on it
S0255	mm
S0256	about who you be and what you're do
S0255	yeah
S0256	and the idea be to go round and to speak to people obviously and find out information
S0255	yeah that's it
S0256	erm i have do er a little one before with the guide
S0255	oh yeah what be that with er
S0256	on a guide camp
S0255	oh okay
S0256	it
S0255	yeah yeah
S0256	sorry
S0255	i think when we do it the people people come round and we have sort of ten minutes to question each of the people
S0256	yeah
S0255	with what be happen when you've be tell the scenario
S0256	yeah yeah and i don't
S0255	we be go to do one again for er she be forty this year
S0256	yeah
S0255	and we'd plan to do something and somebody come up with the idea of it but it it be a really expensive one
S0256	yeah
S0255	and then actually we we say we'd do it and we be gonna go and stay at the hotel as well but it get it be cancel cos there weren't enough people
S0256	yeah
S0255	it's certainly something i would like to do again
S0256	yeah it i think it'll be good hopefully
S0255	yeah i think you'll you'll have a laugh with er so who do you say be go
S0256	and and then there's erm who's also on 's team she's new
S0255	right
S0256	and er who be on 's team but's go downstairs now and then a couple of the their partner be come along as well i think by the sound of it mm
S0255	mm
S0256	so yeah should be good
S0255	sound alright
S0256	yeah so no should be good fun erm have you hear the new iphone sixes be bend
S0255	yeah
S0256	in everyone's pocket
S0255	oh i yes i hear that i think there's no official response yet so i might hold off get mine for another few days until they just er
S0256	yeah make sure it's not gonna snap
S0255	cos it if you if you end up have to have a case er or cover on it that sort of defeat the object doesn't it of have
S0256	er
S0255	well i know you always do but i never do do i i've never
S0256	no

S0256	i have a cover cos i drop it
S0255	and i
S0256	i drop mine under my car today

S0256	literally like not even just just slightly under like in the middle under my car
S0255	oh god
S0256	bear in mind it have be rain and i'm like how be i gonna get that back
S0256	and i have to get my the mac that i've get in the back of my car not obviously an apple mac like er you know coat mac
S0255	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0256	and i put that on the floor lean on it and then like lean right under my car to get my phone back
S0256	cos i have to decide like do i really slowly creep forward cos it wasn't near any wheel
S0255	yeah
S0256	so do i like really slowly creep forward and risk drive over it or do i erm do i lean under my car
S0255	like like do with 's
S0256	er yeah exactly yeah
S0255	that be
S0256	and i didn't didn't really fancy do that cos the thing be i've only have it like a couple of days
S0255	oh no gosh i'd forget that as well yeah
S0256	yeah so i'm like erm
S0255	yeah
S0256	can we trade back
S0255	oh goodness
S0256	yeah and then erm the other other funny thing on the way to work i be drive down the road and i be drive down the main road
S0255	mm
S0256	and this woman be come out from one of the side roads
S0255	yeah
S0256	and she one of those people that decide they be gonna start pull out
S0255	mm
S0256	even though nobody be let them in but they hadn't be there long
S0255	yeah
S0256	they'd only just sort of pull up
S0255	yeah
S0256	but they be edge out and out of principle i never let anyone in if they're edge out because i think it's rude
S0255	mm
S0256	so i didn't let her out and she be right alongside me and she flash her light at me
S0255	mm
S0256	because i didn't let her out
S0255	yeah
S0256	and then she pull in behind me and like flick her hazard and i'm like i'm under no obligation to let you in love
S0255	no
S0256	my i have right of way here
S0255	yeah
S0256	i don't have to let you in if you'd have wait patiently i would've let you in
S0255	yeah exactly
S0256	because you didn't i didn't but she be like and then she have her light on and they be on like full beam and i'm like you're really annoy me now
S0256	so i be like yeah that's all that's the that's the fun of drive my route to work though cos it's
S0255	mm
S0256	always really busy so like
S0255	mm
S0256	there's people come out everywhere
S0255	mm
S0256	so you get some muppets
S0255	mm
S0256	people that think they own the roads and they don't i own the roads
S0255	i think that time of the morning everyone it's like rush hour isn't it
S0256	school run
S0255	everyone's go to work go to school get to be somewhere drop someone on the way
S0256	yeah i know
S0255	and and they do people get all wind up you think the the best thing be if everyone just chill and relax and like yeah you let
S0256	mm
S0255	somebody in and you don't
S0256	yeah
S0255	try and push in and and then everything would move a lot better wouldn't it
S0256	if people don't cos then about five minutes down the road there be a car wait patiently at the side in like one of the park bits
S0255	yeah
S0256	indicator on just wait
S0255	yeah
S0256	so i stop and let him in
S0255	i bet she be behind you go oi oi
S0256	no she'd go the other way by that point i think erm it be no actually no she hadn't she would've see it yeah probably i be like yeah
S0255	yeah
S0256	yeah
S0255	but i like it when you're drive along and you sort of get a chain reaction so
S0256	yeah
S0255	you stop and let somebody in and then they're go along and then they stop and let somebody else in
S0256	yeah yeah
S0255	and then they're go along and then that person stop and you think it's like good karma isn't it
S0256	it's like they say if you if you smile at somebody erm
S0255	yeah
S0256	in the day
S0255	yeah
S0256	then that normally make their day feel better or they'll then smile at someone else
S0255	mm
S0256	i i just think that er if i randomly smile at a stranger on the street they'd probably think weirdo what's she do
S0255	yeah
S0256	crazy and run the other direction
S0255	mm
S0256	so
