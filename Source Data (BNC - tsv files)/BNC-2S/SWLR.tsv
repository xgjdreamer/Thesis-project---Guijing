S0393	just as long as we get there in time
S0391	that's why er i think we'll go the fast way see i haven't get anywhere and it's nearly ten past ten
S0393	which way's go
S0391	he's go the way he know past past the you know where we be the other night for
S0393	he say he say airfield be that what he mean when he say the airfield do he be that what they use to call the airport
S0391	no i think that's there as well
S0393	the main thing be just to relax because er we don't start play till one o'clock
S0391	yeah i'm sure they could even hold it up couldn't they
S0393	it it it would literally take five minutes
S0391	right
S0393	to get the those two amps up the stairs right
S0391	ah right it's just like play for mass
S0393	it be really they do a tune up and stuff like that
S0391	well the thing be they can easily wait it's not like you've get a registry office spot be it it's less pressure
S0393	yeah
S0391	cos they be already marry there's no registrar there there's no
S0393	ah
S0391	there's no sign in of the register
S0393	oh i see right
S0391	they just go and do that on their own and this be their wed celebration
S0393	so what's this then they're just do their vow
S0391	this er they they they only go for a small official service to the registry office just before we meet them they'd do it two weeks before that or something
S0393	right
S0391	so that they didn't wanna be bother with all the official stuff at their wed
S0393	okay
S0391	they do you see what i mean they've plan this wed day themselves sort of celebration that be today
S0393	er so there there won't be a minister or a
S0391	no that might fall
S0393	yeah that's anyway isn't it
S0391	i think the rain would be worse
S0391	see how clear that be i'd rather follow that than try a different route
S0393	the sit nav
S0391	i'd rather follow the sit nav than try a different route even if the other route be gonna be shorter what would you rather do
S0393	i i must admit i would've look into it beforehand and and find the the quickest route
S0391	but you're a navigator
S0393	no i'm the guitarist
S0391	no you're the navigator as well
S0393	well do you want me to have a look on the atlas
S0391	no cos we know the two rout it's just which one do we take the easy one follow the sit nav
S0393	if if you keep on go right and disobey the sit nav
S0393	and go to would the sit nav pick you up and start direct you
S0391	yeah yeah yeah
S0393	the only thing be
S0391	it would take longer
S0393	yeah as i that's what i'm say
S0391	yeah
S0393	because er often people who take as i have do in the past it doesn't end up be shorter do it
S0391	no
S0393	just take shorter in miles but longer in time
S0391	yeah well that's what say he say this way be shorter in miles but longer in time so for the purpose of this journey i think we should just go the easy longer route
S0393	yeah there's a kestrel
S0391	evidently it flare up the further south you get
S0393	yeah
S0391	so
S0393	i mean i we must remember to see if they want some slow air in the
S0391	oh at the end of the service yeah
S0393	you know when they're sign the book or
S0391	no there's no book to sign
S0393	oh well whatever they do
S0391	i think they will want music even
S0393	yeah
S0393	we've get the music it's not a problem
S0391	they they've design their own service so they must be creative
S0393	they be aren't they
S0391	yes they're quite
S0393	i tell you i know what we'll do
S0391	have you bring the thomas hardy
S0393	i've get all the poems and stuff yeah
S0391	have you get the thomas hardy though cos he want literature and he like that
S0393	oh yeah but listen i've drive it from my mind
S0391	
S0393	oh yeah i know what we'll do we'll tell them i'll just start invent
S0391	oh yeah
S0393	the origins of these dance cos no one know you know waulking songs
S0391	yeah
S0393	w a u l k i n g
S0391	yeah
S0393	in scotland they do them everywhere like you know tune for for er specific task
S0391	yeah
S0393	one of the main ones be when they dye yarn and all of that in urine
S0391	oh yeah
S0393	to preserve it
S0391	yeah
S0393	so i'll say this be reciprocate the
S0391	yeah
S0393	yeah do you want some of this can before i have a go
S0391	no thank yeah that's a good idea to make it specific to this one
S0393	i mean they sound
S0391	it's really good if you can do those poems cos it just let me find the next dance get the into my head
S0393	yeah
S0391	give a break cos it's quite
S0393	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0391	physically demand for him
S0393	i've get one by pablo neruda
S0391	oh good idea yeah
S0393	i've get one by er john agard it's quite nice
S0391	what's that one
S0393	it's er something like let your love be a river you know that kind of stuff
S0391	oh right
S0393	there be a guardian thing where it have they ask modern poets to er write verse about for weddings
S0391	they've probably i bet there's one they've choose at least from yours we'll have to listen to the service
S0393	no cos i avoid the search google search for wed
S0391	ah very clever
S0393	i go into another one just
S0391	very clever
S0393	i know that would be a bite
S0391	have say that
S0393	there's a heron
S0391	have say that oh yeah have say that you can't beat the ones at the though you know where they come right down
S0393	that be amaze wasn't it
S0391	have say that i think they would quite like the ones they've choose for the even guests cos it's a different group come tonight to dance
S0393	do we know how many guests there be
S0391	no they weren't sure at the time be they
S0393	be we deal in what a hundred or two hundred
S0391	i i think he i think he say there be enough for people to go upstairs and downstairs so he envisage them swap so probably about seventy or eighty upstairs seventy or eighty downstairs
S0393	right yeah it's a lot isn't it
S0391	yeah it be quite a lot
S0393	how many be at 's do
S0391	er about that
S0393	hundred and fifty
S0391	about that yeah
S0393	right
S0391	but a lot of hers have just come to sit down haven't they i'm guess they'll have
S0393	do you want of seven up
S0391	no thank i'm guess they'll have upstairs erm with a buffet and downstairs with the ceilidh if people don't want to dance or listen to the music they can go and sit upstairs
S0393	yeah
S0391	but for the very start it would be nice cos i think there'll be a lot of people for the first dance that's why i'm think if we get them into the middle for circassian circle we can even have a circle round a circle round a circle we could fit everybody in if they be careful when they go into the middle
S0393	what be that dance be it quite simple
S0391	that's the simplest
S0393	ah good idea to start with it then
S0391	yeah
S0393	i be think maybe why not get them in the circle to start off with
S0391	oh right yeah cos
S0393	do you without tell them that er just gather round the couple you know
S0391	gather round
S0391	they might be anyway
S0393	cos do you remember the chimney sweep use to say
S0391	yeah
S0393	he didn't you know you'll never walk alone with everyone in the middle
S0391	yeah i remember
S0393	yeah
S0391	they're not quite i think they're a more a different bunch she say she'd carefully look at the other ones on the website and she think this look like more their thing explanations about the music
S0393	say it again
S0391	i'm try to drive she choose us because we be different to the others
S0393	right
S0391	because we offer read and she like the aspect of it be as well to explain to the crowd
S0393	yeah
S0391	about the music be that the strip the willow one
S0393	which one
S0391	the music one
S0393	er i don't know it's about
S0391	i think it be keep right up here the other day when i
S0393	so you put this you put this venue into that sit nav
S0391	hang on this be it's er bad visibility what do she say
S0393	bear in the right lane i think you have to be
S0393	oh we're alright we're in the south yeah no that's alright yeah
S0391	oh alright i've still gotta overtake this be it a caravan
S0393	yeah
S0391	it's suppose to be brighter it's darker down here look at it
S0393	there's a copper don't be speed
S0391	i'm not speed i'm not even up to seventy get into trouble for not do seventy sometimes in this lane
S0393	i'd love to do one of these events where people aren't panic all the time
S0391	who's panic
S0393	well about get there on time or about erm
S0391	yeah that's why the ones'll be lovely absolute bliss cos you know if you've forget something you can just pop home we've get two of those haven't we
S0393	we have indeed
S0391	that'll be fantastic
S0393	my only thing about the 's one be er if someone fall down like they do last time flat on their face they'd crack their head open
S0391	this'll be a hard this'll be a hard floor as well do i get over in the other lane
S0393	yeah you join it i don't know about the floor cos er when i work at the the upper floor be wooden but i suppose that's like a hazard these days be it
S0391	i don't know what you mean
S0393	well you say a hard floor it might be there might be wooden floor but the ceiling's lace with
S0391	oh i see
S0393	ceilings'll be lace with asbestos
S0391	yeah well they'll have to be careful and look for hazard i didn't like it when she say i don't want the dance on the first floor
S0393	well
S0391	
S0393	that's obviously why
S0391	no she think we'd cave in
S0393	yeah god the visibility's terrible
S0391	poor isn't it i think it be brighten up though i think it be get darker but
S0393	yeah
S0391	it be brighten up a bite it's suppose to this afternoon isn't it
S0393	yeah i wonder if i should write a poem for them
S0391	oh that would be nice maybe you need to see the mill what do you reckon
S0393	yeah
S0391	aren't they leave the mill behind i'm just guess the venue'll feature in it
S0393	they be leave the mill behind just have the lease
S0393	her dad lease it before
S0391	yeah
S0393	so this be probably a bite of a wrench isn't it in that respect
S0391	yeah they obviously want to have one last celebration in it
S0393	i should've just take the those poems use to do for and people like that
S0391	have you still get them
S0393	they're quite sort of simple aren't they really
S0391	well 's get hers in a frame on the wall in her house with erm she's get the poem and the bouquet or part of the dry flower with the poem

S0393	yeah
S0391	craft and yarn and stuff
S0393	yeah i mean they must be quite entrepreneurial to make it work cos it sound
S0391	arts and craft make me think they're quite creative like and they buy stuff like that

S0393	yeah i could lift everything and er match match lead up with
S0391	yeah
S0393	before you get into this business you have no idea how much of a pain it be
S0391	well that's er
S0393	with the equipment

S0391	and then quarter past eight till nine o'clock where we might have a tiny break at quarter past nine
S0393	yeah but
