S0624	it be about how all those nutrients and like in like it's er basically like say that you should completely fuck load your diet with nutrients
S0629	yeah
S0624	and like it's like they're the kind of his like it's like vegan gluten free which sound really annoy like when you say it like that but it basically mean like it's like i think it's like really bad when you say it like in term of what you can't have
S0629	yeah
S0624	basically just say eat
S0629	you just have to change what you're eat then
S0624	yeah so you just like you eat like fuck load of delicious vegetables fuck load of like erm

S0629	right seed
S0624	and tofu and like
S0629	yeah
S0624	and it's actually really delicious it's get a very specific taste like
S0629	i could probably do it for a week but then i just get
S0624	bore
S0629	well no it's just like need a bacon sandwich
S0624	yeah it's very simple but the thing be that you can like that's what i'm do with it it's just like
S0629	right
S0624	you have like
S0629	days of it
S0624	they just the majority of like i change my breakfast like the staple ones and then like yeah and then it's just like like that and then sometimes i don't i'm pretty sure it's make me feel much better i could be wrong but i'm pretty sure
S0629	erm
S0624	yours smell good bacon
S0629	oh yeah 's get her crit today
S0624	oh no
S0629	she call me last night
S0624	really
S0629	yeah
S0624	be she alright
S0629	she seem yeah she seem alright
S0624	she have i say to her like the thing be that now i kind of that maniacal laughter though cos like she laugh a lot about it which be like quite new
S0629	yeah
S0624	like you know what i mean she's like
S0629	she do laugh but she's also erm she be also quite stress about it though
S0624	yeah oh yeah yeah no doubt she's more stress than she's ever be before i think
S0629	yeah
S0624	but like she kind of like but maybe she's the way when i see her she's like she laugh rather than cry
S0629	yeah
S0624	it's like no the drawing's bad and then like
S0629	yeah
S0624	laugh like rather than be in tear or hyperventilate
S0629	she's not use to be the the bad student
S0624	yeah
S0629	yeah so it's i i know what that feel be like it's just
S0624	you feel like you're at a completely uphill you feel like you're stand at the bottom of a mountain and everybody else be already halfway up
S0629	and throw rock at you
S0624	and throw rock at you
S0629	yeah it's horrible
S0624	the thing be with like i just keep say to her she just need to make decisions about programme stop like stop like cos er if you're tie yourself in knot about think about it too much
S0629	yeah
S0624	and once she's do that she will know knock out a beautiful build with like really poetic space
S0629	yeah
S0624	and be like beautiful and imaginative like she's not she's never gonna be someone who like who love the theory of like japanese like society like she's like she will like take all the aesthetic stuff she's see and the kind of nuance of things and she'll repurpose it like architecturally
S0629	mm
S0624	she's like she's very much kind of an architect like she's architecture be her kind of her
S0629	yeah she's or she's like
S0624	rather than kind of the
S0629	i see the build i want to make but i don't know what to put in it like what you can't you can't think about your programme
S0624	yeah
S0629	around a build that's in your head that's that's gonna cut you in half
S0624	will it
S0629	before you've even get a programme you've gotta build it and then you have to somehow repurpose your programme
S0624	yeah
S0629	to the build yeah see er to me it's stupid
S0624	yeah
S0629	cos then everything be post rationalise
S0624	yeah that's true
S0629	and the whole point of the the the like what happen within the crits especially when like the ones that i've be in recently you have to be able to justify everything
S0624	yeah
S0629	if you can't justify it then you you shouldn't be there
S0624	yeah
S0629	and then if you're try to yeah that's why i think it's hard cos i think she can she can design great build whatever but she need to be able to have a logical method to it
S0624	yeah
S0629	and they need to be able to see that otherwise it's like well this be very pretty but what be it
S0624	yeah
S0629	why be it like this you don't have an answer
S0624	i don't think it help that
S0629	i mean it's er there be so many ways to skin a cat it's completely up to i'm sure there be people who live their whole life the
S0624	yeah if you go i think she's she would work really well in a studio they give you a specific brief they give you a place they give you a site they give you client
S0629	yeah
S0624	and then she'd just fly
S0629	yeah
S0624	she's be give no site no client like she's be give like mythology what the fuck be even that like which be so vague some people love that be like
S0629	yeah
S0624	it's not her style be it
S0629	i have to find a fuck site
S0624	what do you mean
S0629	get to go to and find a site
S0624	ah
S0629	or more what i think i'll do be try and go round and identify
S0624	google earth it
S0629	yeah but pick gap sit and and er
S0624	yeah i have a really interest conversation on sit with someone call from

S0624	i can come to you let's go to this really great pub that i know and er like in so i be like not really sure like what the vibe be gonna be
S0629	yeah
S0624	and part of me be like be this like a like a like
S0629	a hook up
S0624	yeah and then i be like be she like set me up on like a blind date anyway it turn out definitely not a blind date erm but it be kind of so a strange thing to kind of like cos it like neither of us like i don't think we'd really state our interest but it's be like suddenly we're meet strangers
S0629	so what do you know that i know
S0624	so strange but he erm he he work for for for a group call
S0629	
S0629	oh do i know that
S0624	they do erm
S0629	okay
S0624	but he's a really really interest guy he's so interest and he doesn't talk shit like or like but he's be do some research with and he's be argue like it's clts in the way it's so complicate
S0629	mm
S0624	they're that like and and like the whole the mechanics the plan system make everything so complicate that you have to like make it your full time job if you wanna do like house so
S0629	but that's also what yeah sorry
S0624	so yeah so he's but no so he's try to unpack and like make he's he's think about try to do a series of lecture or something on it
S0629	yeah
S0624	erm
S0629	or you need your company to be do that
S0624	mm
S0629	and if that's what you do then you know the way around the legislation
S0624	mm
S0629	and it's and it speed it up
S0624	mm
S0629	and your whole company be about put this together and get
S0624	yeah
S0629	the people together and
S0624	yeah yeah i think it would be a really interest angle for your project
S0629	that that's what i'm do anyway
S0624	yeah but like i think like
S0629	i just don't wanna touch legislation though i don't wanna go through with the plan
S0624	no but
S0629	for this
S0624	if you're like if like if you like just you kind of state it as your thing like role of the architect as be like
S0629	developer
S0624	the developer and navigate all that shit
S0629	yeah
S0624	you need to do it as you do it for your project but like
S0629	that's
S0624	if like
S0629	that's the
S0624	if there be in there
S0629	yeah i think that be part that's definitely it
S0624	yeah that's really cool mm and erm
S0629	you should watch that film
S0624	and i'm go to i'm go to yeah he be say about like so the guy who's run it only one in ten of the people on the committee be likely to get house from it which be really interest
S0629	why be that
S0624	because because they just because they're gonna go like they'll go they'll like interview people for the rest of it so it's not like the i think it's really good because it mean that it's not self interest
S0629	right i see
S0624	so like lot of the clts things like erm lot of clts have it's just self interest
S0629	mm
S0624	the guy who set it up he's the guy with dreadlocks who be on that film
S0629	yeah
S0624	be like he's probably not gonna get a house out of it which be really amaze
S0629	what the guy with dreadlocks wasn't it his father who's get the dreadlocks
S0624	yeah i think he have as well doesn't he maybe not
S0629	i think his father do i don't remember him have i think he quite actually quite a well put together
S0624	yeah he be but i think he have dreadlocks still
S0629	maybe
S0624	maybe not
S0629	maybe
S0624	mm but yeah so erm i think that be interest i mean he be talk about the loan come from bank as well
S0629	the what
S0624	the loan come from bank mm
S0629	oh i've read about this
S0624	and erm the reality check in term like where the fund will come from
S0629	yeah
S0624	they're a cooperative bank
S0629	yeah
S0624	and there's like a specific
S0629	would they loan it to the do they loan it to the council first then
S0624	oh do they
S0629	i think it's loan to the council
S0624	okay
S0629	and the council
S0624	yes no that be true
S0629	then it come back from council
S0624	cos then yes that's true that's true cos that become a erm like that's the insurance policy
S0629	yeah
S0624	basically mm erm and erm what else be he say he say anyway load of stuff
S0629	so how do it end up
S0624	er it just it be just like a chat it be really it be like really funny erm he be very cool though i mean when i organise my thing about cooperatives
S0629	mm
S0624	i've invite him to come along erm
S0629	what's your thing a discussion
S0624	so do i tell you about this guy that i meet
S0629	you've make nine pound already
S0624	erm so this guy that i meet
S0629	you could go round leave like in place and bug people and then send it back
S0624	mm you need to get er erm permission
S0629	oh right
S0624	yeah
S0624	erm
S0629	oh be the company
S0624	i know i may not have
S0629	be the company
S0624	yeah then those two guy erm well maybe actually if you wanna speak to him while you're here
S0629	er
S0624	like he's very like i don't know and i have a good like and he be like he's he's still learn about it at the moment as well
S0629	yeah
S0624	but so yeah both both know both they do village
S0629	i think so as far as as far as erm the course go all i need to know be it's possible
S0624	okay
S0629	i think i and i think i need to make sure i don't get too tie up in the fact that it's
S0624	mm
S0629	there's problems with it
S0624	mm
S0629	because otherwise i'll end up with no architecture
S0624	mm
S0629	so it's just show that there be a way to do it
S0624	yeah that's very wise cos that be definitely the rabbit hole that i've go down
S0629	no but i want to er at the same time i want to know cos i think it could be a possible new to do stuff
S0624	mm
S0629	so the practicalities be definitely you know an issue
S0624	mm
S0629	but i'll need to try and get more for the record like on in interview and stuff
S0624	well maybe
S0629	i think i need to get more about the positivities of communal live and about
S0624	yeah
S0629	erm
S0624	well why don't you
S0629	so it's more of a promotion for what i'm do rather than er
S0624	yeah
S0629	yeah but we've get all these problems
S0624	yeah
S0629	but then i think there be kind of problems can be
S0624	solve
S0629	yeah
S0624	yeah
S0629	i think it's more of a challenge to make it a good thing rather than a
S0624	mm
S0629	although in denmark it's quite erm their house into they're quite communal lifestyles i guess definitely not in london
S0624	no it's not i might be like yeah it must be interest to know like like be they just gonna like with the ones be they just gonna do the kind of like walter segal self
S0629	say that again
S0624	like i'm not entirely sure whether they're just do the actual walter segal self build
S0629	whether they be would be surprise i mean it's there's discrepancies
S0624	or whether they're moderate it
S0629	i mean no you couldn't
S0624	yeah
S0629	you you would never get build on it
S0624	yeah
S0629	that's what's a massive problem with self build at the moment there's be no leeway for
S0624	mm
S0629	erm if for do your own for like you know doors have to be certain size
S0624	mm
S0629	and then you have to have
S0624	that's really interest
S0629	but they're gonna have to that that's the thing with plan
S0624	they have to relax it
S0629	that's that's part of what the that's where i think this film the it aa thing be so interest because it come at
S0624	be this the film that you send
S0629	yeah it come at the house problem from many different angle show what's wrong and show how
S0624	who make it
S0629	it's an aa discussion
S0624	okay
S0629	so it's like load of people sit round and it's only in november so it's still current
S0624	mm
S0629	erm and how perhaps a slack of the a loosen of plan erm legislation for self build and stuff like that could
S0624	yeah
S0629	really pick up
S0624	who say that who be make that point
S0629	he be a he's a planner
S0624	uhu
S0629	a young one architecturally train
S0624	finn williams
S0629	yes finn yeah yeah
S0624	he's erm yeah he's brilliant
S0629	seem like a good good soul
S0624	i really wanna i wanna see i wanna watch that i will watch it
S0629	how do you know him from the stuff he's do with novus
S0624	novus
S0629	novus
S0624	i've see him speak before but he also do he do a lot of project with as well
S0629	mm
S0624	like he do he own i think it be the
S0629	how old be he
S0624	super young
S0629	i be gonna say he look younger than me
S0624	super young he's like unbelievably competent but he
