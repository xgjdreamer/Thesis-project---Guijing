S0517	oh after the
S0558	college or
S0517	doesn't know
S0558	uni
S0517	hasn't hasn't think about it he do not know
S0558	they do say a level be harder that uni but you would be able to answer that so i think he would be okay at university
S0517	i think if you
S0558	if he want the lifestyle
S0517	i think if you can do if you can do a level you can do a degree personally i think you can
S0558	mm
S0517	to be honest with you i'm sort of hold my breath to see if he can do a level
S0558	oh
S0517	he come in today after his exam and he sit down and he say i forget what he say however he phrase it whatever he say i say be this just the chat down to prepare me that you're not you didn't do well in business study
S0558	but you say he hasn't put no work in so how can he expect
S0517	he hasn't put enough in he hasn't put enough in he have do some
S0558	he's do some
S0517	but he doesn't do as much as i would have like
S0558	you don't think he's
S0517	no i don't
S0558	yeah
S0517	but he have do some but it be just you know he's i forget what he be say oh he have to do this or this be i say if this be just the talk to prepare me he go it's only the mock i say i know it's only the mock but
S0558	the prep talk some people be naturally gift aren't they i be say this some people be naturally gift and they can sit in a lecture or a classroom as far as their you know at their stage and be feed this information and store and retain
S0517	oh yeah he's
S0558	and never really
S0517	yeah no
S0558	have to
S0517	oh no don't have to try he's still wish
S0558	i get to the bottom of a page and i can't remember what i've just read
S0517	he's still wish he'd get a photographic memory and do that really exist and wouldn't that be good how good would that be
S0558	i know
S0517	say but you haven't so you're just gonna need to keep re read stuff
S0558	yeah
S0517	he still get extra time for a level
S0558	good
S0517	i didn't realise that he won't use it though
S0558	no be offer it and i say to him you qualify for extra well i don't need it i say well you qualify for it
S0517	mm
S0558	it doesn't matter if you be give it
S0517	because er
S0558	and you don't use it
S0517	cos on that that sheet it say how long they be doesn't it the exams their mock sheet
S0558	mm
S0517	and it be a really peculiar time something like one hour fifty three or he say oh that's with my extra time
S0558	mm
S0517	but still i say do you use it today no
S0558	yeah so you because didn't take it up for gcses i don't think he get the option
S0517	oh
S0558	cos he hasn't he hasn't come to me and say i quality
S0517	mm
S0558	you know
S0517	anyway we will see so to be honest with you i'm i'm you know i'm gonna wait and see if he get his a level i've tell him he have to get a level and i'm not class es as a level
S0558	no
S0517	or ds even really i want cs and i've tell him that he's not to have waste two years but we will see
S0558	he won't he won't at the end of the day he can only try his best can't he but what's frustrate
S0517	well yes but he's not try his best
S0558	no yes that's what's frustrate it's like you know this be what and supposedly have get although sometimes i do question myself erm this you know retain information and this they they would for example have to read something three time for it to sink in
S0517	to sink in mm
S0558	er where somebody else could read it once and i'm go well i can relate to that easily i can relate to that
S0517	mm mm
S0558	erm so whether there be my mum be dyslexic
S0517	yeah
S0558	uncle be so whether there be something
S0517	something possibly
S0558	along the way
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	erm and but when i be at school i mean i come out miss average i didn't take any i take cses but
S0517	right
S0558	but i come out average you know
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	i didn't do gcse er no
S0517	o level
S0558	o level i do er and i get sort of ones and twos twos mainly threes one but a mixture but miss average but if it be now i wouldn't be surprise if i be in that category that
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	i don't retain information and i have to read it three or four time
S0517	mm mm
S0558	to understand
S0517	then it's just down to yourself isn't it self discipline and how much you want to do it
S0558	yeah and i be too busy with sport then i just love my sport
S0517	mm
S0558	they always use to say to every parents' even so much better if only she apply herself
S0517	yeah
S0558	cos she's capable of so much more but i be happy to plod along
S0517	yeah
S0558	couldn't wait to get to the next netball lesson
S0517	and at the end of the day you've get to you know
S0558	or that's
S0517	and it didn't do you any harm anyway
S0558	no
S0517	when you go into the work world do it so
S0558	no no i've always be employ
S0517	yeah
S0558	never be out of work
S0517	and i sort of think 'll be the same he'll just he will find his little spot but
S0558	mm
S0517	who know what that'll be do with that boy
S0558	but you know we i mean i i don't know whether it be a different generation but i can't ever really remember my mum and dad be overly concern whether it be a private discussion
S0517	mm yeah yeah
S0558	i don't know but sort of i can't really remember erm and i be never encourage to go on to university i don't i don't know whether it be girls wasn't or
S0517	mm
S0558	they didn't think i be capable or i don't know my brother go but even my brother you know my brother didn't really excel until he be at college
S0517	well i you often get that with boys don't you they they get
S0558	mm
S0517	better as
S0558	apparently when my brother be at primary school they speak to my dad about put put into remedial class cos he be really struggle
S0517	mm
S0558	but it be when he actually leave school and go to college he go to technical college that he excel
S0517	yeah
S0558	so whether he find his
S0517	so well i know it's like you you often get that as well don't you
S0558	mm
S0517	it's not diagnose as anything that they get help with and then people work out how to get round it themselves and then eventually get better it's like 's brother in law he he have all sort of problems at school which i only find out fairly recently like load and load of problems and be not good at all and and he's get a phd in astrophysics
S0558	it's like my brother he's get that many degrees now
S0517	yeah
S0558	under his belt you know and he's get four or five different degrees now and erm honour be that the
S0517	mm
S0558	yeah i mean he's you know he's like er write program for bank and everything he's
S0517	yeah
S0558	you know
S0517	but i don't know
S0558	but
S0517	so i don't really know
S0558	i don't know
S0517	you can't and they've get to want to do it themselves anyway and as we know never have do doesn't really want to
S0558	no
S0517	doesn't
S0558	do be
S0517	he's go a little bite off
S0558	more studious
S0517	yes he be but he's go a little bite off the boil in year nine he's get this typical year nine attitude of subject that he know he definitely doesn't want to take
S0558	oh yeah
S0517	there's zero effort go into
S0558	yeah
S0517	erm he's very you know he miss a day last week cos he be at hockey tournament they do very well they're through to the midlands final so that'll be another day miss whether he pick catch up i ask him have you you know be and see the teachers and all yeah yeah yeah you know but whether he do or not i don't know
S0558	mm
S0517	he spend so much time on his phone he be he be definitely we need to keep an eye on him at the moment but he's definitely in that year nine mentality of
S0558	mm yeah
S0517	no this year's not that important
S0558	oh
S0517	and i know where they're come from cos i think half the time they they pick on er pick up on that at school cos they're the ones
S0558	yeah
S0517	that get the supply teachers and
S0558	i know
S0517	they're the ones that get the you know and anyway so subject that he know he doesn't want to do like d and t and art and music he's really lackadaisical and then it's really hard to to get them to do it cos no it doesn't mean anything if you're definitely not
S0558	no
S0517	gonna take that as an option
S0558	i know
S0517	but the you know
S0558	and what what make me laugh be like when they've do when once they've choose their subject choice why don't they start them immediately
S0517	i know i know
S0558	just with even the briefest of briefest introductions
S0517	i know
S0558	why carry on with french for example with if you're take spanish
S0517	oh i know
S0558	it's ridiculous
S0517	it's too much timetabling isn't it
S0558	well this be what i say to the thing be be to restructure the timetable for that short period would be a massive job
S0517	mm mm
S0558	massive job and the thing be be although yes everybody's choose their subject they may still actually up to the deadline
S0517	oh
S0558	change
S0517	i don't i don't yeah i suppose so
S0558	you know
S0517	and also i suppose they're oblige by the curriculum to have a basic
S0558	well it will just oh yeah
S0517	education to a certain level in all these subject i suppose i don't know but i do know what you mean but be very much in a year nine type of attitude at the moment
S0558	mm
S0517	cos i keep say to him you know you've get to you've gotta buck up your ideas a bite
S0558	mm
S0517	cos i mean he be do very well for effort but the last report i think he be slide to about sixty three in the year whereas before he be like twelve or something
S0558	mm
S0517	so that's what happen when you get a girlfriend and you're just chat in lessons and in science that's that's what he that's where he sit with her that's where he meet her cos
S0558	mm
S0517	he go down a group at the end of last year

S0558	but erm so i think it's not like you come home you have your even meal and you think and you relax
S0517	no you haven't get that yeah
S0558	because you're either think i've get to drop her out in a minute and i've gotta go back and pick her up
S0517	see you'll miss all that
S0558	and then
S0517	when they've leave home
S0558	i know
S0517	no you won't
S0558	that's what i keep tell myself
S0517	you won't you'll think oh this be nice
S0558	oh i'll be i'll be like you know oh what shall i do it's bore
S0517	really no
S0558	i don't know what do you think
S0517	oh i think i'll get use to it
S0558	i think i'll be glad to sit down and put our feet up
S0517	yes and not think oh it's rain it's cold i've get to go out and pick them up yes it can be so nice
S0558	do you think
S0517	not to have to do that
S0558	do you then we'll be like oh the weeks be so long
S0517	no
S0558	do you know that's another reason why i think time go faster as you get older because where we're at a stage now for example our even be take up by take and fetch and all this and that you know support your children no matter where you live even if it's on your doorstep you'd probably still drop or pick up
S0517	mm
S0558	or you're think where be they and you don't settle till they've come home whatever i think maybe life go faster as you get older because those seven nights a week when you're at home and you haven't get to do all that could be pretty bore couldn't they
S0517	no that would make it go slower not faster
S0558	no but that's why time go faster so it doesn't seem like
S0517	oh i oh maybe i don't know
S0558	it's just you know you
S0517	i don't know i don't know
S0558	that's when you start find all these hobbies
S0517	mm
S0558	and new interest isn't it
S0517	yes something to look forward to something to look oh it's five past four i'd better go
S0558	i would just really really really really like to not feel tire
S0558	i would just really
S0517	like to not oh

S0517	do you
S0558	i wake up yesterday morning and i get up and by the time i'd empty the dishwasher have a couple of piece of toast with a cup of tea go upstairs to get wash and dress and all the rest of it i be even like brush my teeth lean on the sink because i felt so tire
S0517	you've have too many nights out you need to stop go out every weekend
S0558	i feel like it all the time
S0517	do you
S0558	yeah it's horrible horrible i feel tire all the time sometimes i feel so tire it's a strain to
S0517	really
S0558	to hold my eye open yeah honestly i have do for a long time
S0517	do you think you should go and see the doctor
S0558	no because i've mention it to the doctor before
S0517	and what have they say
S0558	cos i say oh do you think my thyroid's play up i'm so tire i i wake up in the morning and sometimes i can get to the bottom of the stairs and my legs be so heavy

S0558	yeah cos my thyroid be fine
S0517	oh that's something to look forward to then
S0558	i know i can't i can't honestly
S0517	really
S0558	remember the last time i felt like i've get energy and enthusiasm to do anything because constantly everything i do be kind of like a battle
S0517	oh god
S0558	not a battle that's probably extreme erm
