S0378	i've not get plan
S0167	anything
S0378	on on my
S0167	i'm not go to be do anything it's gonna be it's just suck that they're
S0378	okay
S0167	that monday be my day
S0378	i know can you change day
S0167	no it's like a strict thing
S0378	yeah i guess they must have to be quite strict
S0167	yeah i guess to make sure people aren't just go off on holiday or something make sure they're actually
S0378	yeah
S0167	look for job
S0378	that's true i always think it be really stupid actually cos i i apply for jobseeker's allowance
S0167	uhu
S0378	when i first move to london and they
S0167	refuse you
S0378	yeah
S0167	why
S0378	because i'd leave staple voluntarily even though i'd just
S0167	you move away
S0378	i move away i finish my degree but i because i leave my last job voluntarily
S0167	yeah
S0378	they say no
S0167	that's very strange
S0378	i know but all i the only thing i manage to get out of them be erm oh and i'd go on holiday as well
S0167	so you
S0378	since my job
S0167	well i've do that
S0378	i know but i don't know why they and erm
S0167	that's a oh
S0378	yeah the only thing i get from them because i literally have zero money zero zero zero zero
S0167	yeah that's what i do
S0378	be a travel card cos i say i've get an interview i can't get there
S0167	yeah
S0378	what be i suppose to do i have no money to to eat to get the bus to my job interview
S0167	that's ridiculous
S0378	so then they give me like i think it be a month's travel card
S0167	well i guess that's something but
S0378	yeah so that be yeah really lucky
S0167	that's stupid because it just discourage people from take job then cos you think well i may as well not take this job because i may as well just go on jobseeker's if they're gonna start punish people for have a job which essentially be what they've do to you
S0378	yeah
S0167	i mean it's not like so if you'd just sit at home be a student and not bother to do anything
S0378	mm
S0167	you would have get money from the government like how why do that make sense
S0378	yeah exactly yeah yeah that's true but because i leave voluntarily it be just so stupid it's like yes of course i do because i finish my degree and know
S0167	yeah
S0378	to get an actual job like
S0167	oh
S0378	well what be they like aye
S0167	ridiculous
S0378	oh my god look back on the time be when i when i first move to london it's so funny
S0167	yeah
S0378	you know about how i set up i have nothing like i i have to spend my last pound in that starbucks that day i have to send off my thing because i
S0167	and then you be like well i hope i've get it
S0378	yeah cos i have to have internet and i have to buy something to get the internet code
S0167	yeah oh
S0378	and i have to take sandwich from work home to eat because i didn't have any money to buy food
S0167	oh no could you not apply for a different
S0378	but that's so funny
S0167	there must be some kind of other benefit you can look out for
S0378	er probably but i didn't i didn't bother
S0167	yeah
S0378	well if i just
S0167	at least you're alright now aren't you
S0378	pardon
S0167	you're alright now aren't you
S0378	yeah yeah
S0167	yeah
S0378	yeah i'm good now actually mum's help me now
S0167	oh that's nice
S0378	which be nice it's really really nice i'm really lucky because she can she's never be able to before and she sell the house quite recently
S0167	so she's get a bite more income to do it yeah
S0378	and so she say cos i be really worry cos my job be end and i be do what you're do like
S0167	yeah
S0378	send out application application application not hear anything back and also it be really difficult cos i have to find something that wasn't waitress cos i'll tell you about it in a minute
S0167	okay
S0378	but that be enough money part time to support me
S0167	uhu
S0378	well and do and flexible hours for for uni so she say don't bother i just want you to pass this degree
S0167	yeah
S0378	just pass the degree i will so i'm on minimum like possible money for the next couple of months so she's help cover my money
S0167	oh that's so nice
S0378	it's a loan
S0167	yeah
S0378	i've decide that it's a loan and i'm gonna pay her back when i
S0167	yeah when you've get the money
S0378	when i've get a job
S0167	it's it's easier isn't it
S0378	but it's just amaze that she be able to do that for me it's just amaze so yeah
S0167	well at least
S0378	so that's nice
S0167	you know where your next meal's come from
S0378	exactly
S0167	you don't have to steal sandwich
S0378	bloody hell
S0167	that's i'm sorry
S0378	i know isn't it so funny
S0167	i know
S0378	it's so funny but that's what you do isn't it to set yourself up somewhere like
S0167	yeah
S0378	the things that you do
S0167	like i don't know
S0378	in order to do it
