S0320	oh good haven't you oh i always go there although i don't i have and i really don't love my hair cut but part of it be because i'd it be about a year since i'd have my hair cut
S0323	yeah
S0320	and i'd forget that i have to tell them to keep the layer quite short
S0323	yeah
S0320	otherwise they all want to give me long layer and it just make it a bite triangular
