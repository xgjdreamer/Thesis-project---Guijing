S0261	and talk great ideas and at the moment be gonna spill the bean about her great idea and something to do with the and a chiropractor
S0262	yeah so you could like you could the first ever video you can video somebody and then you go right how do we know each other we know each other because this be our connection point then you explore common interest and then somebody say oh and then my friend or my lecturer or my mum or my dad or something like this right and then you go okay would you ask your friend person whoever if we can erm if they wanna be videoed and you go yeah alright okay so straight on yes or no then the person agree or not and they come along and they're videoed and then they're talk about their connection point and then you've get this kind of little cluster which be about how people be actually form network either over the internet or in physical world or in a virtual world or whatever so when it come to it the person who you originally start talk to be the person you be genuinely interest in their story but the backdrop story be how people actually help each other and what they're try to achieve and how you've get this common interest with people so it's kind of like you've get the main character in a film but you've get these secondary character and they be actually drive the story forward so it's kinda like you can have a little bubble thing where you've get this world of this be about 's social network be these people and the way that these people be operate within this 's world be what's important to and that's how things get do okay so what's the outcome of talk to his lecturer be his lecturer say you've get a fantastic idea i think this should be an undergraduate research project and then say oh if i hadn't have that lecturer and be able to talk to him physically i wouldn't have be able to get to the point that i need to be at
S0261	okay so that's great in the context of what we saw as an er that example on the foundation erm for the job for a developer which be erm that they be display that people be happy to help and so what you're do be you be provide people through this film's video this chat with somebody a storyline that demonstrate to somebody well how i could go about it so they might not be aware of but they can see through somebody else's example erm if i go and have a chat to my lecturer about the idea i have and i get over a particular barrier that i've get then i might be able to er er well i'll i will be able to find out and know whether it's something that's feasible that i can go forward with
S0262	mm
S0261	or i can have a chat to that guy
S0262	mm
S0261	and get to know him et cetera et cetera
S0262	mm
S0261	and the other thing that you be talk about be be kind er i suppose relate to network theory in a way isn't it erm er i don't know a lot about it but it's interest because you could allow your your interview process maybe over the period of a week you could do one each day and could allow that just to erm organically go on a certain direction
S0262	yeah
S0261	and then you could sum it up at the end of the week with either a google hangout type thing where they all get together and you might find that none of them know each other as a group but each one know each other on a respective connection down the path
S0262	mm
S0261	and yet they have some common thing in and that you can draw together which be what their network actually mean
S0262	yeah it's like a chinese whisper like you could do say you know monday to friday or or whatever so you start out with on monday and you end up with by friday and then you interview on friday and you go okay so you're come here through a connections of other people who's your connection well my connection be okay right well we meet on wednesday so we know a little bite about him so tell me okay what's go on there oh right well we're try to solve a problem okay this be the problem right good so let's talk about it and then it's like okay er not have you erm meet from monday no but i can do now because i know how this work i know that we're connect through the social media or we be connect because we be introduce physically at a caf√© whatever so what you're do be this you're reflect back on the initial person who start off the here's a problem and then you've actually show how people be come on board share their common interest and share their common concern and that they're show that they can go back to that person and have the connection that they didn't originally have have the videos not be make cos the videos in a way this be the narrative it's push the story forward
S0261	yeah and er well you could put it in the context of the six degrees of freedom thing where you go i'll run a video from monday to saturday yeah so you interview
S0262	mm
S0261	a person each day
S0262	right
S0261	six six time so that mean the person at the end of the process have six degrees separate from the first person
S0262	yeah yeah
S0261	and then you can explore all of that connection
S0262	yeah
S0261	but what do that actually mean what do that provide people
S0262	well it provide them with erm i suppose insights into how people
S0261	communicate
S0262	communicate and make connections and what they do with the connections cos it's easy to just connect with someone on facebook but if you're unless you're actually make some value attach to that connection and really try to understand where these other people be come from like what be they what be their common interest what be they call common concern be there something that you can work together on that you've actually find out now that you'd like to work together on and do something together
S0261	mm
S0262	and that be a community that's build something at least at least that's show a growth in the area that technology do have connectedness but what you do with that connectedness that count
S0261	and and there's a big thing that you fee off that thread which be erm all of those elements of the student ish type things which be about your your learn your motivation your erm get on and do it your experience your share your community your network and all of those you know there's a must be a core of elements which be all encompass in that erm which allow you to explore have something and get from er take a journey from here to here and you can use it in the example of the guy who's be recommend to do something by a lecturer because he's have an idea which be connect to this thread
S0262	mm
S0261	of people
S0262	mm
S0261	or whatever
S0262	it it i think it work on the level
S0261	you could take it in that circle
S0262	that the story the narrative be drive be drive the growth so it's it's actually other people who be just er who stories every time they contribute something that story be be you have to have a good sense of narrative but in a way people be drive their own narrative it's not me or you who be sit there go okay in the next video we want this to happen it's actually go to be quite impromptu
S0261	well and that kind of go back to what we be talk about erm kinda 's mechanism of of market and advertise and storytelling journalism
S0262	mm
S0261	and you know imagine if you have a community and a of x amount of people in them however many let's say several thousand and that you post this as a as an experiment and you say that within this community we're gonna explore this idea but you're not gonna tell them what the idea be
S0262	mm
S0261	and that on this particular week we would like everybody to in their mind make themself available in case on an impromptu basis we're gonna interview
S0262	mm
S0261	and then you start at one point and you don't know where this go to go
S0262	yeah
S0261	but it's gonna thread through the community and come up with something
S0262	yeah
S0261	and so you draw the whole community into this whole this this observation of it all
S0262	yeah
S0261	and that that create the ball within which all of this network conversation must go go on
S0262	yeah but what's what's different about it be that you get a sense of continuity cos we've get lot and lot of videos up on the internet but they're one stop shop videos they've get the begin they've get a middle and the end but that's just one video it's try to tell a story in two minutes something like this
S0261	well i be go to well let's sorry i'll let you carry on yeah
S0262	so what i'm say be that you know the the the well the reason why we're use videos be not because we just wanna make a video that's two minutes long we're actually use a video just to simply capture form of communication the way that we communicate erm and that's the only reason why we're videoing it be because normally you sit down and have a conversation and you can see the person unless you're on the telephone
S0261	yeah erm i think it's also get the potential to demonstrate a different way of go about do something and it erm if you take that idea of a short video which tell you a lot in a short period of time yeah and then you scale that to the size of a whole community of several thousand people
S0262	mm
S0261	right and you so you're stretch that story from from be this short to take a longer period of time but scale it in such a way that that the learn you get out of this bigger thing be massive compare to this tiny little piece of time
S0262	that's true
S0261	even if it be just the the difference between two minutes to a week that that scale by many tens of thousands
S0262	yeah
S0261	right
S0262	yeah
S0261	so you could you could say you've get this mechanism by which erm you could even call it a business thread er way to er brainstorm ideas such that by the end of a week you've come up with some kind of proactive brand new idea that you could use as a thread to follow on down a path to start a new business or something
S0262	mm
S0261	er whatever i who know i'm just freefalling with this erm and er i i can kind of see er er i can see that it's an interest experiment
S0262	it's the difference between it just make me think of quite a few things that we be do filmmaking wise back in the nineties that actually i think it be ridley scott do pull off erm he's do two i think in there's you know both of them on the internet i think it's just the day in the life and he first start it in the uk where he want everyone at just at certain a day to film their day their individual day and they have to send their footage in and they pore through all of this footage and in the end they they make a story out of it they make a narrative and the other one that he do be a world one so people from all around the could send in a day in the life of and they somehow incredibly put a narrative together which be fuck powerful
S0261	i i remember this yeah
S0262	now the
S0261	i've see that
S0262	what we're do be the reverse we're not we're not get quantity to start with and then condense into quality we're start off with quality to start with and it's go to scale into quantity we'll hopefully without lose the quality so rather than edit it we're gonna be grow it so it start with the day in the life of but in the life of know these people and these people come in and go yeah i've get a day in the life of myself let's just say and then i've bring these other people in because these people be in my life and these be the sort of things we're talk about at the moment and this be the sort of things that we wanna try and achieve together and these be the sort of resources that we need and then ah that's the key because if you start to get people talk about the things that they need you can start to see what resources they need
S0261	and that's what you pin be your your products
S0262	right
S0261	you know you you go you get them to chat first
S0262	yeah
S0261	you could you could just do this as an experiment tomorrow
S0262	yeah
S0261	and you could see what come out of it and you could erm synthesise it all and you could go okay i can see five products there that we could do tomorrow
S0262	yeah
S0261	and that and and then you can so those five ideas you're go to carry out some kind of analysis on to decide which one you're gonna go with
S0262	yeah well i think that's a great idea because erm like if you if you even find that you need two things or three things by the end of the week to solve a thematic problem that people have come in to solve erm or even just to talk about what they this what they see as the problem communicate what the problem be be the first thing they uncover that they need some things then you can have the on the sunday you could have like a the video which summarise what the resources need to be in term of er of all you know solve the problem so you don't have to go and watch all six videos you can just go straight to sunday and sunday be go well now we know what the problem be we now know what we need to do to solve the problem but we need these things and those people who come in at a later stage can watch that video and they're like oh okay i can do that i can offer this i can co create these things with these people i'm gonna jump into their world and i'm go to attach myself to these people who be work on this particular thing and then i can grow you know i can offer my service i can grow business i can do whatever i want with these people
S0261	mm
S0262	and we what we can do be we can cherry pick the ones that we wanna offer ourselves so you can say straight up hey guy like thing be be that this be our areas of expertise like english language stuff that's what i can help out with erm i can help out with study skill stuff because i'm a learn skills advisor but there be other things on the website that i won't necessarily be able to help out with because i don't have that area of expertise so people should jump in where they feel that they have the areas of expertise and want to get some experience
S0261	and that go back to what you saw there be people display what their skill base be and say happy to help and that immediately provide a mechanism for people to connect
S0262	yeah
S0261	and you be obviously build a profile and stuff like that blah blah blah blah blah
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm that provide an ongoing network of of which be kind of it it's a more streamline version of of a facebook of a linkedin of a you know
S0262	well the other thing be be that you can help
S0261	it's a more it's a more day to day live mechanism
S0262	it it's an evidence base so that when you go to get a job erm and you haven't yet have any experience because one ways or another you haven't really get experience yet erm you can show people that yeah you have to use your cv to sell yourself but one way of do that be by evidence the type of ways that you've be work collaboratively which be one thing that's hard to evidence and i would even go so far to push through another product which be in the in the in the media world we use and i know photography if you wanna be a photographer you have to have your photograph as a portfolio
S0261	your portfolio mm
S0262	erm if you wanna be a filmmaker you have to have er what they call a show reel
S0261	mm
S0262	there's nothing wrong with the idea of push through a product for young people which be how do i sell myself without use the stereotypical cv which be very hard to really make yourself look appeal
S0261	okay so that's where the attraction be for our idea all of this be contain within our our framework okay
S0262	yeah
S0261	people can only access it through our framework
S0262	yeah
S0261	so they can only reference our framework to their employer to demonstrate this be what i've do as a part of this product
S0262	yeah
S0261	we own the product
S0262	oh okay
S0261	yeah
S0262	yeah it's an exploratory product and it's not it's not obviously either if it will work but in some areas it will work in the in the less traditional areas it will work cos you could you could actually evidence it by take part of the video part of the actual text that people have write around what you've be do your work any evidence that's collate you can then find a way to put that into er erm what i would call a digital cv i don't really know what that mean
S0261	yeah well we have to cv
S0262	something cv yeah
S0261	yeah because i mean the reality of of the the traditional cv be be that it's antiquate
S0262	yeah
S0261	and so i'm sure erm
S0262	and it's hard for young people to write anything on it
S0261	i'm sure in creative the creative world i mean i i be listen to how some people actively engage in interview their people they want to work for them right and these be you know and they're obviously try to bring very bright people on board but i have never ever come across anybody who be interview in such a way and
S0262	ah see that's actually really clever too because if we start off with the interview thing that you know there's the person who's interview like me you can see how the person answer the question right and that's kind of like a skill be answer question that be really impromptu question you don't know where you're go with them it's what happen in an interview
S0261	and that's the great thing about mixergy be and
S0262	yeah
S0261	and and it er provide that it's those er this kind of hunt question so who i be listen to in this interview he want what he describe he he put it out there as i wanna get connect with the top people in the one percent and of that one percent i want to hire the one percent of the one percent
S0262	right
S0261	so he's say the cream of the crop okay
S0262	mm
S0261	and so he they develop a a a process by which they would interview people quite in depth and they would explore things like erm er what motivate you to apply for your last job erm what be your interview like what be your boss like erm what kind of interaction do you have with them and explore things to all sort of level that apparently have no real connection with the job
S0262	yeah
S0261	it's all about the psychology of
S0262	yeah
S0261	how you think how you do things
S0262	yeah
S0261	how you relate to people the relationships and what you think okay and maybe your ability to challenge ideas and you might proudly stand there and go well i resign from my job because i fundamentally didn't agree with their business approach and this be why
S0262	mm
S0261	erm but that provide somebody that mechanism to to to to discuss that scope
S0262	mm
S0261	so go back to what you be say be that erm through these interview online you can demonstrate those examples by which people can learn from
S0262	yeah i think it's better because in a way you have you have
S0261	i don't like frame in the context of a cv but it provide people an awareness of communication at that level
S0262	er yeah erm i think what i'm try to say be that these days if you be be creative about try to get a job you could send a company not your cv but or a cv a traditional cv but actually a a creative content that actually personably you introduce yourself you've get some cut to the type of things that
S0261	it would just be a website of yourself with a video on it and
S0262	yeah
S0261	other resources
S0262	yeah
S0261	and so we're you know
S0262	whatever
S0261	website
S0262	yeah or we could even fashion a product which say look this be actually what you need to do as a kind of format to get yourself across in the best light rather when we saw the if we'd give them some direction that would have come off better i know that if i have talk to a couple of those students i would have get a lot better out of them they would have get a lot better out of themselves
S0261	absolutely of course and that would have demonstrate things
S0262	so what i would say be that it be we can encourage that product to come through
S0261	mm
S0262	as an exploratory product
S0261	that's right
S0262	that allow people to be creative co create because they can then evidence the way that they've work with their peer the way that they've work with people who be older than them and most importantly i think the things that they can safely say be their strengths you can almost look someone in the eye and go i've i i believe these be my key strengths and i've be read about videos and why they're so powerful that's why viral videos be so powerful be because see be believe
S0261	who's say that
S0262	there's a lot of psychology behind that now that's why everyone want to make videos and put them on the internet
S0261	there be examples in there though of where see wasn't believe in my point of view and
S0262	right
S0261	and and that be because they you know there be like the lady who get who lecturers and her friends and you know she interview them right but we don't know who those people be
S0262	no
S0261	there there's no there's no actual quality behind that they could just be anybody
S0262	but it's a good idea
S0261	yeah
S0262	and that's actually a really
S0261	but but with that roundedness to it
S0262	yeah
S0261	it would be a strong idea
S0262	well that's a good way of actually show investors if there be if we're gonna go to that point we go this be where it's a start point this be how you would make it look a lot better and the idea be that if you have creative commons access on the website people can actually download only part of the video where they have be where they've be involve okay obviously they wouldn't download other part of the videos where they hadn't be involve cos it wouldn't work but say if there be a video where i be interview somebody and they've be particularly articulate about work with people or do something whatever it be they could edit that take that bite and put it into their their digital cv and then they can reference back that information and say this be an interview that be conduct online about this particular topic and you can see how i answer the question and this be me and what i really think so the strength of the interview will come from firstly from my line of question and secondly from their ability to answer coherently concise ivly with a you know articulate the main point these be all things that we value still in the world and a lot of academics tell me or teachers tell me that students be lose this ability to articulate themselves
S0261	and that go back to that lady's talk
S0262	but i don't know if that's true
S0261	she
S0262	i mean you know i i i don't know if it's true because i generally talk to younger people and i find them very articulate i mean on a face to face i talk to young people all the time on a helpdesk
S0261	yeah i think we've get to remember that we're talk about deal with er people that be at this part and she's probably talk about the wider society
S0262	mm
S0261	she's try to say the eighty percent that be actually otherwise there
S0262	mm
S0261	that aren't er you know they aren't at university or deal in an academic sense be operate in such a way that be like that and you see that in the real world you see that in business you see that on the street you see that on the train you see it on the day to day thing simply walk down the street look at their phone
S0262	mm
S0261	so you're you're right about the students erm the they might be articulate but maybe that's because they be at university
S0262	okay so like say if we say a dogma be we we never edit out
S0261	mm
S0262	that mean that the the person who agree to take part in the interview erm agree that it will be unedited and that
S0261	well that shape the the rule for the interview which be quite simple if you ask them a question that they're unhappy answer they will just say i'm not gonna answer that
S0262	yeah yeah
S0261	and and that's fine and you do find examples with mixergy sometimes where he have to go back and say i'm sorry i've have to edit this out because i be push a point that didn't wasn't actually go to be factual
S0262	yeah okay
S0261	okay
S0262	yeah
S0261	it explore something on the basis of of some erroneous research or whatever
S0262	okay
S0261	yeah so he have to make er that's errors and omissions
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	yeah
S0261	but that's the way it work so it's fine
S0262	but what's good about this be that where we can add more credibility particularly cos they're younger people and younger people might not be as believable as older people even though it's unfair to say be that if we use this idea of of connect monday to tuesday and tuesday to wednesday wednesday to thursday the credibility be lend by the relationships so when we meet on monday we get to on tuesday and then we get to on wednesday the credibility be through the fact that they know each other and they can talk of each other about what they do
S0261	and you get that with nearly every interview that you hear online that the people who be be interview and the people who be interview them have either meet them in the past or they've meet people that they know in common and that's hence how they be interview them
S0262	mm
S0261	it's not by chance
S0262	mm
S0261	so erm that demonstrate exactly your point
S0262	mm
S0261	most of the time
S0262	right okay
S0261	mm
S0262	you hear them you know my friend or i know this guy or ah and have you hear of this yes i do buy that guy's product you know i do like this stuff you know so they find common point of interest
S0262	okay because our target group be younger what we're do be we're break down the social relationships into manageable chunk so we be explicitly demonstrate how monday connect to tuesday tuesday connect to wednesday that's where they can learn be how monday connect to tuesday tuesday connect to wednesday so that
S0261	how relationships connect
S0262	yes
S0261	and network be build
S0262	yes and how communication be the vehicle for that to happen how we communicate with each other erm and if
S0261	okay
S0262	it do involve a lot to do with courtesy politeness there's lot of things in there
S0261	yes erm
S0262	like sort of grow an awareness of business etiquette you know if you're nineteen you might be feel like you're on top of the world but you need to be able to show a respect to your elders et cetera et you know rather than tell people that let them see it for themselves
S0261	okay erm so we we're think about something that's a bigger picture than just interview students you're talk about an an an interview people who who can provide a benefit for the students as a whole as a community
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm and that can be people that be either internal to universities or external and work in business and can be good er
S0262	sorry
S0261	role model et cetera et cetera
S0262	yes absolutely
S0261	yeah
S0262	mentor
S0261	all of that stuff
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah so that absolutely widen your scope of your er business focus
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm and connect a lot better from our point of view as a business model to er other things
S0262	yeah so we're gonna have to roll we're gonna have to test this out
S0261	yeah just hold on a sec dude
S0262	okay so this be gonna be quite interest because
S0261	can you just wait until you come through here and chat
S0262	because if we be to do a trial run of it and it do just happen by chance that students want to have me introduce erm interview say for example a member of staff in a university the student go yeah you know the reason i want you to really interview my mentor at or at the uni or my lecturer at the uni be because we share these common interest and er we you know think along along the same line and i would say you know that's great so you know would you ask your lecturer to see if they'd be available for an interview and you'd go okay fine we'll see if it happen
S0261	and that's great
S0262	and you leave it just like that like a cliffhanger
S0261	mm
S0262	you've gotta leave it like that
S0261	yes
S0262	so the audience be look at go i wonder if the lecturer will say yes i really hope the lecturer will say yes cos i wanna know what the lecturer's gonna say about the student
S0261	and if you want to you could like wait a whole week or two weeks and you can thread of that story through each of your subsequent interview whether it's er a little bite at the end where erm i like the way the they're quite often structure there's er an introduction a storyline and then there be kind of things to learn at the end
S0262	right
S0261	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	or reference at the end
S0262	yeah
S0261	and that's a time where you can provide that ongoing connection and say well you remember like last week when we be talk about this well this be what's go on
S0262	yeah recap recap
S0261	and this be where it's head to
S0262	recap
S0261	you can recap that
S0262	yeah
S0261	and you can provide a little little bits of information to maintain
S0262	yeah
S0261	that thread of interest
S0262	or something like
S0261	you know
S0262	well what would you do now if this be you what would you be think of your next step how would you be go about set something up and just always get those kind of like out there kind of question to people erm
S0261	and it could be somebody be interest in how the heck do you become a a lecturer and what's your background i've read that on your profile and you've do this this and this erm and so how would i do this
S0262	yeah
S0261	how could i connect with people who be do it
S0262	yeah
S0261	and i think a lot of the problem be this stuff be in the back of people's mind but they're too busy to actually take it along their journey from start to finish through university it become something that they focus their mind on at the end
S0262	mm
S0261	when mm it's sort of probably like my case you've stop and you've gotta start something new rather than run a thread by the time you're build it
S0262	mm
S0261	so when you get to this point it's more than just grade it's gotta be more than just
S0262	oh yeah
S0261	get get top as
S0262	yeah
S0261	and be accept into something
S0262	mm
S0261	or be headhunted by a corporation it's provide yourself the best possible foundation on which you can jump out of education into the real world
S0262	mm
S0261	erm and there be many many examples of you know people who be gonna want to er get a good job work for a corporation work for a big place work for a small place work in community work on volunteer basis travel all sort of different things
S0262	yeah
S0261	thread er and this er they're gonna wanna start their own company the the young guy there who be talk about you know i want to develop interstellar you know travel or whatever it be
S0262	yeah
S0261	you know it's big picture think but it's a lot of psychology behind all of that
S0262	yeah
S0261	and er that you're try to run this thread which can take people from the start of university age they're learn from their peer that be above them
S0262	yeah
S0261	and this be something i be teach when we be at school we use to have we you would have peer supporters who could be people in the final year who be responsible for people who be start
S0262	yeah
S0261	school
S0262	yeah
S0261	and to be their mentor
S0262	yeah
S0261	and so you're create this learn from each other experience which i think get lose it do get lose because because universities be intrinsically erm segregate societies they be build of faculties er there's not much cross faculty interaction that even within the faculties quite often it wasn't uncommon for people who be do master or phds didn't even talk to any of the undergrads
S0262	yeah that's true
S0261	only when they have a job as tutor or a lecturer
S0262	yeah
S0261	do they do so
S0262	yeah not much have change
S0261	and otherwise everybody be hide in their corner
S0262	mm
S0261	and they be not share anything with anybody else
S0262	no because in some discipline you be not encourage to
S0261	well this become a it's a matter of manage competitive advantage
S0262	mm
S0261	and things like that
S0262	mm
S0261	however you're talk about the brightest people in the world be hide and lock in a corner or a cupboard for the benefit of something and they're not share any of their bright intelligent knowledge with anybody else
S0262	mm
S0261	and that have get to be
S0262	a waste
S0261	that's er such a waste
S0262	yeah there's a lot of wastage
S0261	yeah
S0262	in intellectual think
S0261	and if if if you consider er a lot of the the kind of discussions that go on at universities and a in a public forum sense and predominantly around erm er orientation time or or er no erm intake time
S0262	can
S0261	when you're try to get students
S0262	can you write that down
S0261	what i be say
S0262	cos i think that's a quite a a think provoke there's a lot of wastage in intellectual think
S0261	there be a lot of wastage
S0262	waste er waste
S0261	waste in
S0262	in intellectual think
S0261	intellectual think
S0262	that will get someone think what do that mean
S0261	erm people be lock away not share with the er community within the university erm or otherwise now that's a perception whether that's true but that's just my experience from when i be at university that's what it felt like i might have be the type of student who choose not to engage with these people maybe they do engage with others but erm but i don't think so i don't think it be like that it be definitely an us and them type society
S0262	oh yeah yeah yeah there be there be
S0261	er and that's the same kind of thing that you're bring up on through you start school and it's an us and them they be the old ones you're the you're the newcomers
S0262	mm but
S0261	and then you go to university and it's the same thing and then you start in business and it's the same thing
S0262	but everyone know
S0261	and
S0262	the the this won't change if you get on with your form tutor as a pupil you'll do well
S0261	mm
S0262	if you get on with your lecturer at university or a lecturer you'll do well
S0261	mm
S0262	if you get on with your boss at work you'll do well
S0261	and the reason why
S0262	but that doesn't change any time
S0261	er but the that that be about build relationships and the reason why you'll do well be because you learn more because you're connect to these people
S0262	yeah
S0261	and and i think quite often they're it's probably because by default they be a kind of mentor whether it's formally or informally
S0262	mm
S0261	erm and of course with a mentor you will learn things because there's somebody who's show you the way
S0262	mm
S0261	so if you can create something that exist on a bite by bite basis which be erm use that ladder within the university to share knowledge from top to bottom i didn't last year and this be what it be like these be the things you could learn you know without it be a a a a mechanism to plagiarise stuff or whatever
S0262	mm yeah
S0261	but it be about that of community people learn life skills which be learn and be a continuous learner and share their knowledge with others share be the important thing
S0262	yeah yeah and i actually you know what there's so many mentor program at universities around the world
S0261	they become dilute
S0262	they're very dilute and they're not actually visible
S0261	exactly
S0262	they only have like award nights at the end of the semester where only a handful of bigwigs come down and it's all a bite tongue in cheek and it's a just a bite stag
S0261	my example be er when i start the job here erm somebody er at the time be a proactive hr person who say everybody who want a mentor put your hand up and i'll try and connect you with a mentor now she simply join two people together by name who she know but they didn't know each other
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm and but not relate in a context of a departmental
S0262	mm
S0261	context or anything like that now that could be a good thing or a bad thing
S0262	mm
S0261	however there be never any forum for you to actually meet together unless it be both of you do it so all she be be a go between
S0262	mm
S0261	she wasn't facilitate anything really
S0262	mm i have that at
S0261	yeah
S0262	and i have a mentor i never meet with them the whole time i be there
S0261	and this be so you didn't have a mentor
S0262	no i didn't
S0261	so but and that's where the failure be in the whole thing
S0262	but the reason why be cos it felt fake cos i'd be assign someone
S0261	and i have felt exactly the same thing
S0262	i felt it better to find my own mentor
S0261	mm and you may do that and some people may do that but some people don't have the confidence to do that so by provide a mechanism which be relate to you be just a year ahead of me then that's a an easier relationship than you've already go so far
S0262	yeah
S0261	or you be the expert
S0262	yeah
S0261	and i've get this massive gulf to cross over
S0262	yeah
S0261	to meet you in the middle and you're still way ahead of me when i meet you in the middle
S0262	well actually you're right because
S0261	you know
S0262	when you're probably
S0261	that's like break down er into a smaller problem
S0262	it it be it's break down the relationships into more explicit erm demonstrations of how it actually get put together cos i think you when you're seventeen or eighteen you're ambitious no matter what and you probably want to know richard branson let's say yeah you're eighteen and nineteen you love business you you just wanna meet him once in your life so you can have a conversation with him about business and then you've gotta figure out how to get to richard branson to have your conversation with him and the thing be be that wow if you only know that a mentor who be a year above you have already make a connection with virgin and that person and virgin also have a connection to richard branson you can see that quite quickly if you want to you could try and make that kind of thing happen
S0261	and it fit in within the block of six
S0262	yeah so you do need to see that people above you by one year or two years
S0261	have the potential to
S0262	be also relevant mentor
S0261	be very relevant yeah yeah
S0262	it's not always look for the person who be the director of a company who's gonna be or a manager you know i go oh i know somebody who work for kpmg well yeah so what what how's that gonna help say other people for example well it doesn't it only help me but that's what we wanna sort of erm demystify be you think that your connections only help you but that's not true your connections actually can be put to good use
S0261	well it can help a whole community
S0262	yeah and that's another thing that we can explore be by unpack those relationships people learn how relationships get put together they can start to form their own ideas of how to put their own relationships together and most importantly of all this be what we have to learn be how to maintain relationships cos that's the hardest part
S0261	mm okay so erm we've discuss quite a lot from and and i think we're we're explore some interest things there's no doubt about that we we we need to do some test erm so and on tuesday we've get the short film thing with these students
S0262	mm
S0261	and that's just something for your work relate stuff but be it something that can have some kind of benefit to what we're do or be it just something on the side something else
S0262	like what
S0261	i dunno i just just the topic of what be be film for you know do that actually interrelate with anything that we're think of
S0262	yeah definitely because you know you could say to somebody erm okay you i'm ask you about academic integrity who be the people who have help you to understand what academic integrity be and then they might fire off a few people and then you'd say okay tell me a little bite more about that tell me a little bite more about these people tell me a little bite more about the relationship tell me a little bite more about that and then by the end of it you'd say okay this person we've be discuss erm would you ask them if they'd be available for an interview
S0261	mm
S0262	yes or no
S0261	yes
S0262	and that's always the end
S0261	mm mm
S0262	and that's the story the story either go somewhere or it doesn't it's just the way the story be be drive people will drive it forward
S0261	mm
S0262	and that's true because if contact his lecturer and say oh i've be talk to this person and they're interest in about academic integrity i explain to them how you've help me which be always nice to hear and the lecturer go yeah okay yes i guess i have help you that's good okay well erm we'd like to learn a little bite more about academic integrity from your perspective would you be interest to be part of a video er part of an interview and the lecturer go yes or no and then the lecturer say yeah and then i get in contact and interview them and i ask them question so the reason why we're here today be because have recommend that we interview you because put forward these ideas and that's the recap and then you can say well you know how how have you learn for example about how to either act with integrity or teach with integrity or whatever the case may be and then the the lecturer would talk a little bite and then you'd find out well who be the people who you've be connect to who have help you in this area and you know the whole thing could go really really random it could be so random and that's the whole that's great about the story be that you just don't know where it's gonna go i mean one thing that we you know we've gotta say be that obviously we can't be interview children because
S0261	what be you talk about
S0262	well
S0261	we're not we're not deal with children
S0262	no i know but it's gotta be it you know it's gotta be clear that you don't we don't interview children so nobody get some any funny ideas
S0261	okay erm
S0262	but i think to get the story go it's a it's a much broader topic not just about academic integrity but you have to phrase the topic in a way that encourage people to ask others to be interview so i would probably refine that by say something like erm er yeah something like you know integrity be something that's core to to the everything that we do everything that we say erm but but how do we actually really realise that how do we demonstrate that how do we think about it how do we reflect upon it what what's go on when we're think about academic integrity and act with integrity oh sorry even academic integrity it could just be personal integrity or you don't even have to put an adjective in front of it you can just talk about integrity and then you'd have to link it to a problem so you could say for example these days lot of students be ask ghost writers to write their assignments for them and this be not only an issue for er integrity but it's also an issue for other stakeholders and what can we do to solve this problem what sort of things be there that's available to us to solve these problems and maybe one way of get to solve the problem be have people talk more explicitly about what the problem be and then we can get some solutions go so that i would that's how i would start to frame out the theme
S0261	yeah so that i mean that that be the the kind of the service that you're try to provide for the community and solve some people some some particular problems that the community be tell you about
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm so so that's that's it's interest that erm can provide a i think a good forum for to help to build a community in a proactive way erm and try understand some problems and what what we need we'll need to explore be how to relate that community to some kind of business model that start attract some some money whether it's that to be in the community you have to subscribe to be a part of it or whether there be certain products that you're sell to the community or erm or resources it could be a totally a a an a whole side business that be connect to the community
S0262	mm
S0261	through a thin line that you're just steer the community to that side of the business
S0262	mm
S0261	but that's really give the attraction
S0262	mm mm
S0261	erm
S0262	i think what you do be once you've start to get a feel for what
S0261	the problems be
S0262	the problem be and the solutions you start to go and the background to the interviewees do you wanna co create do you wanna co create something together and put it as a product and sell it
S0261	as a resource
S0262	through this website
S0261	mm
S0262	yeah
S0261	yes that's quite possible erm and like with the with the interview well it wasn't an it be a chat i do with and i say let's record it let's put it up on to share with everybody else okay so i ask about it and he say yeah that's cool and then you guy could like if you do it like this then you could put it up as bonus content on the site
S0262	yeah
S0261	and all we be think about be share a conversation we weren't try to present any particular learn from it
S0262	yeah
S0261	but there be something valuable in there to learn about but immediately he be try to attract our information which we would provide him for free into to provide more value to the community and to his product
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah
S0262	yeah of course
S0261	so he he's he's cleverly allow his community to build his own product for him
S0262	yeah well my initial reaction be what i be ask you to do before you go off and do the other thing but it be to make
S0261	what other thing
S0262	erm be to do the case study so the reason why a case study be useful be because case file study normally involve erm character they use usually involve a situation that need some manage or if there's some kind of problem that's arise the character need to organise themselves that they can start to align or something or group themselves so that they can resource something or they've be give a task where they have to solve a problem so the case study be always pitch up with something that need to be do and then you take this character in the story from monday to friday and then you say okay actually this have get enough meat on it to become a case story a case study do you wanna co create a case study which have also get move image in the case study so the case study be not just a bore old text with some answer to some question at the end the case study be a a real life case study where they have agree to co create and act and be in this in this case study so it's not imaginary it's real
S0261	mm
S0262	and the reason why you would do that be because you you believe in the case study enough because it's real it's not make up and secondly you would do it because you could sell it and earn money from sell it to higher education institutions that can't keep up and can't keep adapt to the new theme that be come through all the time and higher education institutions don't know how to make move image case study they wouldn't fuck know how to do one if it bloody well bite them on the arse so this be an innovative way of say you know your textbooks and how bore they be well you could show this case study in your tutorial which have already get some teach materials connect to it and some learn materials connect to it and therefore you can even put this online you don't even need to show it in a you can put it in an actual unit of study and this be a way to engage your your learners so if you're learn about collaboration but you can't collaborate because you're physically not able to you're an online student and you you need to learn about it this be a move image case study which be a real life example of collaboration and you pepper it around teach materials and learn materials so that basically the instructor know how to use it and the learner know how to get the most out of it
S0261	mm
S0262	and you sell this at a premium
S0261	mm
S0262	because it's real
S0261	who be you sell it to
S0262	higher education institutions
S0261	right okay
S0262	because their online content won't move as fast as this the narrative in the storytelling of the case study will never match anything that they're capable of do themselves and i can tell you that for sure unless the one with the have get that entertainment content concept go the learn the learn that come from an entertain and entertainment's hard cos it's so subjective so that's why a real live case study be almost as good as watch a film but it's better because it's real and it's not a documentary cos the documentary come from a different documentary filmmaking come from a different perspective it will have most time it's get preconceive ideas of what the story's gonna be so like when you watch louis theroux for example the narrative have already be write before they've even go to america to interview the people so that's not really fair we're project it as real life but it's be write by
S0261	and it's not essentially script
S0262	a producer yeah
S0261	yeah mm uh mm cos
S0262	but this be different this be not me write the script it's not you write the script it's the people who have agree to co create a a move image for want of a better word a move image case study that's base on a real life problem
S0261	who who who's the creator sorry
S0262	the creators be the people who have be in monday to to thursday or friday so say there's monday be tuesday be wednesday's erm
S0261	this be through the centre of your thread
S0262	yeah
S0261	and then they're and then you're create a case study relate to that interview process
S0262	yeah but you edit it
S0261	that you've explore
S0262	you you edit it into a narrative at that point it's become here be the character thingy and thingy what do they do for a live well they be chiropractors okay what's the problem well the problem be that their profession be under fire okay what can they do about it well what they can do about it be x y and z and normally the thing that they're do be something connect to their relationships with people so for example might know the head of this group he be talk about yesterday call friends of science or something friends of science director be not only the friends of science director but he be also one of the lead academics and chiropractors in whatever country
S0261	mm
S0262	you see how it can go wherever it go
S0261	yes of course
S0262	we just don't know but the point be be that once you start uncover some connections and people like the way you uncover the connections then and they trust you and they're co creators so when they choose to create the case study by co author it and co be in it then they get a cut from the sell they be get some royalties from it so sort of like if you
S0261	er if it work in a business model then fine
S0262	well if it's use a music a music model you know you're gonna have people who be get a lot of money from sell an album they're more than likely gonna be the producers and the the band will get a cut
S0261	yeah well that that's a very old and stagnant and die business model
S0262	alright so how be band afloat nowadays financially
S0261	erm er i i think that band be because they get a a larger cut of the deal now it use to be they get no money they're just pay a a rate by a producer or a manager the manager get the pot yeah
S0262	alright
S0261	the difference be that it's be share more but also there be less true musicians around and there's more tat which be be create by production company or record company yeah
S0262	okay
S0261	which be you know they do a short term business relate hollywood style we invest this much we get this much out of it it live and die a short life
S0262	right
S0261	you know
S0262	okay well somewhere in there
S0261	an example of get around this be like spotify or netflix use subscription model okay so they're provide people access to get around a music problem which be that they be make the content not get money for it because it be get pirate and the argument go that because somebody be get some money out of it that's better than get no money out of it so it still get pirate but more people pay a small amount to use it through a subscription model
S0262	yeah alright well
S0261	it mean that it's some some money okay
S0262	there's there's some somewhere between there and there and publish there be a model for us to sell to higher education institutions
S0261	mm
S0262	there be a model because what you're provide be a high quality content which will engage with a student target group cos the the universities be go to have to get a lot cleverer at produce content to engage with certain age group they're really gonna have to get clever at that so if we be pitch in at the here be our our roundabout our age group of who we be able to attract on our websites and make these case study with kid in them and adults
S0261	professionals
S0262	and professionals
S0261	mm
S0262	erm no not only be you go to be able to provide some learn to fill some stuff that's gonna be difficult for you to fill otherwise but certainly it's also give you that warm touchy friendly feel because everybody want to say oh we be a lovely university and we be so friendly with our students and they love us so you're try to warm warm up the bed so to speak by give people this expectation that okay this case study may not come university but the fact that you've put it in your online course at university by association mean that students might expect that they can do something similar themselves they they too could go to a lecturer and say well you know what i've have this great idea how about we go for a coffee and have a chat about it and the lecturer be like oh my god somebody's come and ask me to go and have a coffee with them and they're an undergrad student i don't even talk to undergrads the you know what i mean so there's this kind of like you're sell on a a feel you're not sell just a product you're sell a feel of the product too like a warmth to it bring in this idea of like oxford and cambridge where you use to go round for a cup of tea with your you know your personal tutor and your personal tutor would ask you all sort of question about your life and what you want to do with your life and give you biscuits that idea you know friendly warm helpful and the good thing about it be be that what you're what you're prove to others be that it's sustainable cos what they're say be you can come if you want to you can come to our website you can have a look and preview at some of our case study if you want to make a case study with us about something we be happy to do that but it need to be do in a format way mean we need you to come and do monday and then get a person to come and do tuesday and then wednesday and thursday it's not just come and ring on our door on our door and say hey and have get this fantastic idea for a case study you're like great but it's a format that we have to put that into
S0261	mm mm
S0262	cos the one thing that you can you know and you should obviously be aware of be that format er be very powerful
S0261	mm of course
S0262	and they're also very rip er offable as well
S0261	yes
S0262	and the reason
