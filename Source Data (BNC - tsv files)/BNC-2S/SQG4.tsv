S0525	so what's your concern with him start nursery then you're want er some sort of routine
S0623	well not a routine only that he'll fall asleep by himself in the day
S0525	that's unlikely that's gonna happen
S0623	mm why do you say that
S0525	well you never do it
S0623	yeah
S0525	even as a toddler
S0623	what always have to be hold
S0525	or have one of us
S0525	one of us lie down with you in bed
S0623	mm
S0525	to get you to sleep at night
S0623	i know
S0525	and the end of the day and of course it's gonna be a different surround and it's only gonna be now and again and
S0623	uhu
S0525	he might not have a nap at he might just stay er end up stay awake all morning
S0623	yeah
S0525	cos he's only gonna have half days there isn't he
S0623	i suppose it's not gonna be
S0525	i mean at least when you start back september it's just those two half days
S0623	uhu yeah that'll
S0525	so
S0623	be easier yeah probably
S0525	so that that's that's not gonna be difficult be it
S0623	hopefully not
S0525	oh well it's the three weeks in july isn't it
S0623	mm
S0525	have you get him book in for any sessions yet or or just the two mornings like you're gonna carry on
S0623	he just well at the moment i've say the two mornings
S0525	monday and
S0623	in july
S0525	tuesday
S0623	yeah
S0525	yeah that's okay
S0623	but i'll book him in for more you know it's not a
S0525	well it's not ideal be it and if the weather's nice it'll be lovely to it would be better to have him wouldn't it and
S0623	yeah but it's how much you can do obviously will be off for a day but
S0525	yeah you're not gonna wanna put him in nursery any more really be you
S0623	i will because obviously with go back full time it's i don't expect anyone to be able to have him
S0525	be you gonna approach it with
S0623	i don't i want well it's not a question that i'm it's not that i'm against it but it's mm they haven't obviously he's aware that i wanna speak to about it this week cos obviously it's get closer and closer
S0525	yeah it's about ten weeks away isn't it now nine weeks
S0623	yeah but it yeah it's like they they've obviously or he's make this offer but hasn't make any kind of i mean they do say obviously they'd have him in the even or i'll have him on his birthday but they only kind of mention that on the morning
S0525	then they didn't want to come round on his birthday anyway
S0623	no didn't wanna come round
S0525	cos have have a bad day so
S0623	yeah
S0525	if that happen
S0623	well exactly
S0525	do it all get call off do it
S0623	yeah obviously so
S0525	they need to spend time with him and see if they think they can do it
S0623	well exactly because i don't think be
S0525	he's not a difficult baby but he's still a baby that need
S0623	exactly yeah
S0525	constant
S0623	i don't think be erm very much well he obviously probably wasn't leave with and very much at all when
S0525	don't you think
S0623	they be baby no cos they have childminders and all sort
S0525	oh right
S0623	cos of be you know at work and
S0525	mm
S0623	whatever she she use to take them to but not even that it's it's different for a bloke isn't it
S0525	yeah
S0623	i wouldn't see look after anyone else's child even though he's get his own
S0525	mm
S0623	know what i mean wouldn't think he
S0525	although he might turn out to be better than
S0623	yeah well wouldn't be difficult
S0525	no i don't think it would
S0623	mm it's yeah no i wouldn't think her have him would i wouldn't be comfortable with that either at the moment the way it stand
S0525	mm
S0623	cos they don't they don't if he start cry it's like well obviously i'll give them a rough idea of what he do in the day by then
S0525	yeah
S0623	hopefully he'll have get himself into a pretty consistent one by seven months but dunno
S0525	mm er and it change cos again if he get
S0623	well exactly
S0525	a bite poorly or
S0623	yes start teethe mm
S0525	get teeth come through anything change their routine
S0623	exactly
S0525	and then once you know nothing's set in stone as you've find he's do a few weeks of sleep through
S0623	oh yeah yeah
S0525	and now he's wake up again
S0623	uhu
S0525	that's just the nature of baby
S0623	mm i know but if he's cry you can tell why he be but they would be like
S0525	mm yeah
S0623	i'd have and she just oh well i've forget everything about baby i i don't okay then well doesn't fill me with hope for
S0525	no you're gonna have to either well either get involve a bite and give him
S0623	mm
S0525	to him for a couple of hours now and again
S0623	yeah
S0525	beforehand and see how he
S0623	mm

S0623	yeah
S0525	so when you're back at nursery and he's at work and he's if he have problems or
S0623	yeah it's just er it's not i know they wouldn't
S0525	and it will you know hopefully july'll be fairly easy for me and your dad because well take this week he's he's work
S0623	yeah
S0525	erm i think thursday friday saturday
S0623	okay
S0525	so he only do three full days and if if if he make that saturday and sunday
S0623	yeah
S0525	do one full day in the week and then he have his meet as well but he do spend a lot of time like he's go to meet his friends in birmingham he'll be around at
S0623	mm
S0525	his parent but he can take in the car
S0623	yeah take yeah
S0525	erm

S0623	who be his who be his friends
S0525	you know our friend and
S0623	vaguely
S0525	be it and
S0623	vaguely
S0525	and they meet about an hour away so he say well there's no point come back
S0623	no
S0525	and i say
S0525	well i hope they pay for your lunch at least
S0623	mm
S0623	yeah as you say you can take him to it's just everything though isn't it cos it's you know three weeks be a long time to change your
S0525	i know well i know it's i mean
S0623	complete schedule for the day isn't it you you can't do what you want you can't
S0525	only for three weeks
S0623	mm
S0525	mm but at the same time you just think in nurseries i mean all the he'll be in a room with all the cry baby and they're all
S0623	yeah yeah
S0525	just leave to
S0623	mm
S0525	and he won't come to any harm but you just
S0623	no
S0525	kind of think oh
S0623	two mornings be
S0525	it's a bite of a shame but as he get bigger and play
S0623	yeah
S0525	a bite more
S0623	uhu yeah cos they take them on from three months in that nursery
S0525	you just think when they're that age they need one to one not
S0623	yeah they do
S0525	even one between two
S0623	no
S0525	baby and do they do that with all or be it
S0623	they have like so they're in group
S0525	mm
S0623	they have like a little group leader and i think they're responsible for about four of them so yeah it be still a large
S0525	mm
S0623	i know
S0525	it's just a dilemma isn't it
S0623	yeah
S0525	that's why i just didn't go back
S0623	mm that's not an option
S0525	well we didn't we didn't have any money either but
S0623	yeah
S0525	it well we our house be about the size of yours and we stay there until i get
S0623	uhu
S0525	and we need another room although we do have the third bedroom
S0623	you do have three room
S0525	mm
S0623	upstairs didn't you
S0525	yeah yeah that's the but i need a couple of afternoons a week if that when i start and er and and that you know that be perfect
S0623	yeah oh it's just win the lottery be crack
S0525	it's difficult isn't it
S0623	mm
S0525	cos you wouldn't go back out a choice i don't suppose no
S0623	no absolutely not i don't wanna go back people be like oh miss it i miss it when i'm on maternity leave no you don't it's a bleed lie
S0525	mm
S0623	miss be at work miss the kid wanna get back mm
S0525	some people do some people want a job but the
S0623	some people be weird
S0525	well yeah

S0623	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	you've get no idea have you before you have one
S0623	no
S0525	and of course you think everything's gonna be
S0623	mm
S0525	it's funny cos your friend the hairdresser
S0623	oh yeah
S0525	be say how she's already book a holiday for next year
S0623	oh okay
S0525	abroad
S0623	mm
S0525	that she's take the this baby's gonna get a passport that's the first thing it do and be gonna get use to travel cos that's what she like to do
S0623	okay
S0525	erm you know and i just think well fine but it's like i say to you
S0623	yeah yeah
S0525	just hang on till you've have him and see
S0623	yeah
S0525	how you feel
S0623	uhu
S0525	cos i don't think you wanna be jet off to other countries there's a lot hassle involve and a lot of
S0623	where's she go
S0525	oh i don't know spain or fuerteventura or
S0623	oh okay
S0525	there i don't know
S0623	uhu
S0525	something like that yeah all baby friendly but
S0623	yeah but still it's
S0525	yeah if they catch a cold or they get a bite ill while they're over there
S0623	yeah
S0525	you've get all that hassle you've get everything
S0623	yeah
S0525	that's what i be think about the iceland trip cos and keep ask i say well i'm just not convince it's a trip for a toddler he'll be toddle by then it's a sightsee trip and even the day at the blue lagoon you're in the water when you're out you're cold
S0623	mm
S0525	that's not a place for a baby to spend a day out
S0623	no
S0525	he won't he won't want to erm and that airbnb i'm think you're so isolate
S0623	it be yeah
S0525	what if
S0623	if anything happen then
S0525	if i know i just think
S0623	mm
S0525	we're just miles from anywhere
S0623	mm
S0525	and all of that in my mind i don't know i probably worry too much anyway your dad always say i do
S0623	uhu
S0525	and you go oh yeah it'll be easy but er it would if if everything go smoothly but
S0623	mm
S0525	the minute you're just a long way from anywhere
S0623	yeah anyway he'll he all he'll wanna do be run around and
S0525	that's right and play
S0623	move and play yeah
S0525	and like if you've get a swim pool or you've get a like bulgaria
S0623	mm
S0525	would be fine
S0623	uhu
S0525	you know as long as we're watch him with all the step but you've get
S0623	yes do what you wanna do and
S0525	you've get beach you've get the apartment to go and sleep in
S0623	mm
S0525	with the air con you
S0623	uhu
S0525	we know what we've get
S0623	mm
S0525	erm
S0623	yeah yeah it's different
S0525	there be hospital facilities on the yeah you know might not be great
S0623	mm
S0525	but i'm sure
S0623	yeah it's different out there cos you know what to expect you know what and as you say it's a very
S0525	and i think with spain and all the spanish anywhere like that
S0623	oh yeah
S0525	i think you'd be erm you'd a lot of the european countries you'd feel a lot safer as long as you're in some sort of even like the euro camp in the we we do that
S0623	mm
S0525	when you be three and five
S0623	yeah yeah
S0525	erm and you be out and about in the tent cos be say how wonderful that be the other day
S0623	mm
S0525	she say be it wonderful i say no you be a child
S0525	still camp and
S0623	yeah
S0525	the bed be still horrible i think
S0623	yeah uhu
S0525	i do have a socket and a wooden floor and
S0525	a hard floor and and a
S0623	yeah
S0525	fridge full size fridge
S0623	yeah
S0525	so it be quite good i say
S0623	mm
S0525	but only because the weather be good cos if you've get bad weather
S0623	mm
S0525	and you're all in there and you can't
S0623	yeah
S0525	dry anything it's horrible
S0623	it be yeah it's awful if you can't
S0525	but the weather be lovely
S0623	do anything and you can't go out
S0525	and the same when we go with
S0623	mm
S0525	and you have your swim pool
S0623	yeah yeah well it's just
S0525	and that's what want you can't and you can't take him to new york and you can't take him i don't think iceland's it's a lot of money for what it be and i think you'd have a better holiday
S0623	yeah
S0525	and and while he's still this age i mean i there's no rush to take him abroad and i think go to be a much better option
S0623	mm yeah yeah
S0525	because we know where we be we've get everything we need
S0623	yeah definitely mm
S0525	you can take him down the beach we can do the
S0623	uhu
S0525	there'll be like the little trampolines and things there'll be little crazy golf when he's there'll be all sort of things
S0623	yeah
S0525	little fairground rid that's what you want when they're little
S0623	oh yeah yeah definitely mm and even if
S0525	all the stuff that you use to do get one
S0623	and even if the weather isn't great then it's not an issue of
S0525	no that's right and we have some great
S0623	just gonna be
S0525	our caravan holiday be
S0623	yeah
S0525	be great and then you know you'd sit on the beach and then eat your little chip and then fall asleep
S0623	yeah uhu
S0525	just put a blanket over you and put you in the shade and you'd be
S0623	mm
S0525	you'd lie there for an hour
S0623	uhu
S0525	wake up again oh we'll start play again
S0623	mm
S0525	it's just easy
S0623	yeah
S0525	and let's face it the whole holiday revolve around the baby
S0623	oh of course yeah well everything do anyway cos obviously yeah
S0525	well yeah if he's miserable then you may as well forget it
S0623	mm
S0525	what's the point of go anywhere
S0623	yeah uhu yeah
S0525	that's why you're not invite to new york cos it's no place to take a baby
S0623	where it's er
S0623	obviously where yeah if you've get iceland and you've get the day book or something and you've get the day at the blue lagoon and he wake up and he's not very happy then it
S0525	well i just think it's not an ideal place for him yet
S0623	no not yet and it be a lot of money
S0525	and it be it's sightsee because you'll be take hike to glaciers and waterfalls and beautiful things but that's not what a toddler want to do
S0623	no no no
S0525	be bore stupid
S0623	uhu
S0525	and you'll just say well we'll get back or we'll then we'll only have the you know how many cars be we take it just i don't think it'll i think we'll put iceland on hold
S0623	yeah well you you you do something for your big birthday
S0525	yeah don't mention the number i know but i'd rather go somewhere warm come on if i'm if i'm have a choice really what
S0623	mm yeah
S0525	but that's gonna be caribbean
S0623	yeah cos yeah
S0525	well actually thailand's probably better
S0623	january yeah
S0525	that time of year
S0623	mm uhu
S0525	but that
S0623	yep
S0525	you know but and then i think well will i no i probably won't
S0623	uhu
S0525	probably won't go anywhere for it
S0623	mm well next summer be it next summer yes when will be thirty and will be sixty
S0525	yes of course have they mention this trip to
S0623	no erm and i i say cos mention it the other day like oh i wonder you know he say again i wonder if we will get invite i say well erm sorry what would you want to do if we do what would you you know what do you think we'd do well it depend where it be doesn't it and if it's you know gonna be okay for but well yeah probably if they say oh yeah i've get no objection to go but obviously i say it can't be your mother shout right we're go out at seven o'clock in the morning or
S0623	we're book dinner for eight o'clock at night or whatever
S0525	no
S0623	so i just don't think that's why part of me think we're not gonna be invite
S0525	cos you won't fit into the schedule
S0623	cos i'm think yeah
S0525	will it be florida
S0623	i don't know or whether it'll be like a villa in portugal or something cos they have do that a couple of time
S0525	well that would work for you cos you could have a bite of freedom then and
S0623	yeah
S0525	with your own car and you haven't
S0623	yes
S0525	get to go out at eight at night although portugal i don't think any of the restaurants open till seven thirty
S0623	yeah
S0525	but you be four six and four when we first go there
S0623	oh yeah yeah
S0525	cos it be always a bite of a you have to wait
S0623	mm
S0525	but you enjoy it when you get there
S0623	yeah yeah
S0525	you love the restaurants
S0623	yeah yeah
S0525	and you you
S0623	well 'll only be one and a half won't he
S0525	yeah yeah you just have erm mm yeah it's sleep more in the day and
S0623	yeah
S0525	it's difficult to get
S0623	mm
S0525	a routine go without
S0623	a change
S0525	yeah
S0623	yeah definitely
S0525	mm
S0623	well we'll see but well we need to see if we're gonna be invite yet
S0525	well they say well you can come but we don't think it's your sort of thing
S0623	then i'm not gonna bother if they if they say that then
S0623	no i'm out just gonna go and check on him
S0525	he's asleep still
S0623	uhu yeah well if they do if that's him with the invitation i don't think it's go to be your sort of thing
S0525	mm will it just be them and and if she's still with him and you or would they invite other members of the family
S0623	i've no idea well if they invite other members then we're definitely say no because she'll spend her entire time complain about them and i'm not
S0525	mm
S0623	and also then throw in well if they pay for it then i say well obviously if they pay for it then yes we're go but
S0623	well mm
S0525	what time of year will they do it be it
S0623	probably will depend on a lot of things it'll have to probably in the summer holiday
S0525	their wed anniversary's august as well as 's birthday be it
S0623	uhu
S0525	so it's all around the same time
S0623	well 's sixty in march but

S0623	or whether they'll go in like no he still won't be warm enough will he
S0525	depend where they go
S0623	mm
S0525	go out to the canaries then they've do that before they do spain in easter
S0623	yes they do i suppose mm
S0525	it's probably be better weather for you cos it won't be bake hot
