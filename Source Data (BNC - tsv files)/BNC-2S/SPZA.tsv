S0510	you'll have dry flower by the end of it yeah
S0509	i will indeed
S0510	but less
S0509	but yeah i've finish my amaze patrick ness book
S0510	yeah so what's so amaze about patrick ness then
S0509	he just he write i don't know he write really beautifully it's just it and it's yeah
S0510	be he always of a particular style or do he mix it up
S0509	no he seem to change style like between his book
S0510	right
S0509	like his last one be really sort of quite complexly write
S0510	yeah
S0509	and then this one's sort of write it's write from the point of view of this guy and it's really sort of erm colloquial
S0510	right
S0509	not like you know the apostrophes replace letter in every other sentence but just like slang and that in it
S0510	okay
S0509	and it just read like someone's talk to you
S0510	oh
S0509	but erm at the begin of each chapter it's get an excerpt from what the indie kid be do in their town do i tell you about this
S0510	no
S0509	and the indie kid erm well they're the group who always have the massive adventure in the town and you know ten years ago it be the zombie ghost and then five years before that vampires blow up the school
S0510	oh right
S0509	and it's always the er the indie kid the people with name like satchel and dylan and finn
S0509	who these adventure always happen to
S0510	right
S0509	erm and the time of the indie kid have come again and the immortals be attack
S0510	okay
S0509	and at the begin of each chapter it have a little kind of paragraph of what's happen with the indie kid
S0510	yeah
S0509	while that chapter's take place
S0510	ah
S0509	and then it go into the rest of them cos it's the rest of us just live here
S0509	so it's like you know the indie kid do all this but the rest of us just live here
S0510	live here right
S0509	and we're just normal people who want to graduate high school or whatever
S0509	and erm and then occasionally the world of the indie kid and the character of the novel will cross over like at one point they run over a deer with glow eye and then the deer come back to life it's really weird
S0510	oh
S0509	and then yeah and then one of the friends in this group i mean they're suppose to be the rest of us
S0510	yeah
S0509	but one of them be erm a quarter god of cat he he's the he's the grandson of the god of cat
S0510	meow
S0509	yeah yeah
S0509	so at one point one of the indie kid things be that the gods come down you know and eh
S0510	right
S0509	that so one of them have all this heal power and like at one one bite where they interact with the indie kid he heal this guy and it's really it's really cleverly do
S0510	if you put certain herbs under his nose do he go a bite wild
S0509	no but like cat flock to him
S0509	and i would have think gather round him it's quite funny
S0509	like the mountain lion come down and just sort of cuddle up to him
S0510	oh right
S0509	it's quite funny but erm yeah they've all get like their all these kid have get get like their own problems like one of them's get ocd and that
S0510	right
S0509	and it's all then the main character have the ocd and it's really interest and kind of mm oh gosh and then like at the end the the guy who's quarter god be like the gods have be try to get me to take over from my mum for years and become a full time god and i've be say no but i say that i will if i can heal well cos normally he can just heal cat but he can do a little bite of heal on humans
S0510	right
S0509	erm he he say he would if he could heal his friend who have the ocd cos obviously the ocd be like in the mind so it's like
S0510	mm
S0509	a different thing and so he's now bind to this contract with them his friend be like i don't i don't want you to cos i want to see if i can overcome it myself which be really cool
S0510	ah
S0509	it's a really nice end
S0510	just stop that malarkey
S0509	but erm there be all of the drama go on between them all cos yeah it be great though
S0509	and like one of the character in it who's like this sort of the new boy who's roll into town you think that it's the prince of the immortals like the way it's write it's set up so that he could be the prince of the immortals but then
S0510	right yeah
S0509	it and then you get to a few chapters before the end and it's write in a way that's like oh he isn't then
S0510	oh right
S0509	but like you've be trick me all along because really they be all normal and that's what you're try to say
S0509	that's quite very good
S0510	ah
S0509	yeah
S0510	so what's the moral of the story be that it like don't be fool by
S0509	you've be trick me all along no it's like friendship
S0510	right
S0509	they're a really cool group of friends
S0510	right
S0509	yeah they're really yeah it's cool
S0510	ah
S0509	and yeah friendship and trust your friends
S0510	mm
S0509	yeah
S0510	we like that kind of thing yeah
S0509	yeah but the other one that i love of his be more than this which be just like send you into the onto the floor in like spasms of literary pleasure
S0510	oh really
S0510	be this be this the complicate one or be it
S0509	yeah it be more sophisticate language would have be the word
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	erm yeah but that's cos he always twist a bite of fantasy into it
S0510	mm
S0509	like his his trilogy that he do be like full on fantasy then more than this be like futuristic kind of fantasy
S0510	okay
S0509	and then this be just like normal world but there's all this stuff with the indie kid go on
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	yeah so it's eh it's very good
S0510	so ah he's on your must read list then now
S0509	yeah yes
S0510	i've get actually another patrick erm that i really
S0509	patrick gale
S0510	yeah patrick gale
S0509	yeah
S0510	and it's funny cos what you be say about you know erm er the book with the indie kid
S0509	yeah
S0510	about how at the begin it give you this little description of what be happen with the indie kid
S0509	yeah
S0510	but then it go into what be happen with the rest of the world sort of thing
S0509	yeah
S0510	erm and patrick gale this particular book that he do call on an exhibition
S0509	i remember that one
S0510	aw such a good book that be the first one of his that i read actually and the main character the essential character be this sort of well american woman live in cornwall but she come to the uk sort of as a student erm
S0509	yeah
S0510	i think she move to london first and then end up in cornwall meet meet this amaze guy who take her on with child
S0509	right
S0510	and all the rest of it
S0509	oh
S0510	and erm she be like this really typical sort of artist artist who have crazy moments
S0509	yeah
S0510	and you know shut herself away for weeks on end and all the rest of it but at the begin of every chapter he would focus on one of her paint so the open sort of if you like
S0509	oh
S0510	be just a description of this incredible paint that she have draw or paint
S0509	right
S0510	erm and then in some way it link into the overall story it wouldn't necessarily
S0509	mm hm
S0510	always link into what be happen in that chapter it might have be that particular paint she paint in a period of her her life where it have particular significance because she meet somebody and you know there be some theme in there to do with it but you know it be just an interest kind of concept if you like for a a book a
S0509	right
S0510	just a thread through
S0509	yeah yeah yeah
S0510	particularly as it be about her her amaze creativity
S0509	yeah yeah yeah
S0510	and her in her life and you know how how that change over the course of her life i mean in the end she be sort of well she always be she a sort of manic depressive really

S0509	right oh dear
S0510	and the final chapter be this start off with a description of a paint that she'd leave to her children
S0509	right
S0510	which be i won't go into it any more but you know it be very poignant and very significant to the overall sort of

S0509	i'm not entirely sure what that mean but yes
S0510	well you know it's to economise in such a fashion be sort of not false but you know there's no point in you do it because it doesn't help you actually end up spend more or have more you know trouble

S0509	and i be just like do the wheely bite go on do the little blunt bite go on

S0509	do i erm tell you about you know from drama from
S0510	er okay yeah
S0509	erm do i tell you about him faint
S0510	no
S0509	he erm in science when they be do dissection he faint twice
S0510	ah bless him
S0509	i know
S0510	can't blame him really it can get pretty gruesome
S0509	it be like when we do it in class cos we have to do the heart and stuff

S0509	and there be no point well i guess there be cos some people learn practically but
S0510	mm
S0509	but like it wasn't like how do you dissect a heart on the exam but then i guess they have to teach you cos you probably do have to do that at like a level or uni or whatever
S0510	mm but they could at least wait till then if you're really interest in the subject and you really want to put yourself through that
S0509	yeah yeah apparently biology be really hard at a level
