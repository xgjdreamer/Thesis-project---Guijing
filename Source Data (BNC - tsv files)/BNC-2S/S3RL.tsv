S0432	yeah
S0428	he's get an amaze cv i he shouldn't have any problem at all
S0432	no
S0428	like he's get an incredible cv

S0428	erm but obviously he want to like leave erm the uni in on good term cos they're like the world leaders in what his like field so
S0432	oh yeah
S0428	er but
S0432	so he hasn't send in his notice or anything yet
S0428	he's tell them that he want to leave
S0432	oh
S0428	and they're like oh you have to finish everything
S0428	so they're that's why

S0428	erm and he work in the same kind of field and they get on really well so it'd be so lovely for those two to work together
S0432	mm
S0428	like but i think it's just money and you know

S0428	like want to leave like like academia i think because you just end up do like so much work and like he spend his weekend it just take over his life and
S0432	yeah yeah you don't have life to do anything else
S0428	like he doesn't even have like the money to like fly home
S0432	oh
S0428	like he he every time he doesn't cos like the rent's really expensive there
S0432	mm
S0428	so
S0432	so even if he do have the holiday which he doesn't now
S0428	which
S0432	he he wouldn't be able to come over any more
S0428	no so
S0428	it's it's just a rubbish life at the moment he's work like seven days a week earn no money
S0432	oh god
S0428	but do something he love which be great
S0432	yeah
S0428	but i think there come a point in your life when you're like
S0432	at least he's get
S0432	yeah
S0428	stop
S0432	you need to like think about yourself a bite more and
S0428	yeah and and as well
S0432	yeah
S0428	which be so amaze
S0432	and yeah like your his yeah like your family and
S0428	yeah
S0432	ah ah that's so good that they're gonna be here though
S0428	yeah yeah
S0432	even if even if it be like a hour drive it's still only an hour drive
S0428	yeah
S0432	it's not a eight hour flight or something
S0428	it's just so nice cos like i think now it be definitely gonna work out between them now and i couldn't imagine him with anyone better
S0432	mm
S0428	she's like if i could pick an ideal person for my brother it would be her

S0428	yeah
S0432	ah
S0428	she's so amaze so
S0432	have he get over his ex's family like situation
S0428	i think he'll he'll always have this weird
S0432	mm
S0428	relationship
S0428	and like
S0432	even when he come back here
S0428	probably but i mean none of them be here so it's fine but yeah like he go sail with them every weekend in
S0432	oh
S0428	he's so he's just such a joker
S0432	i don't know what i i don't know what i'd think though
S0428	cos when when we when i go to new york
S0432	i would find it frustrate
S0428	yeah when i go to new york last summer he be just stay in his ex's parent's house and i be like do you not find that slightly weird he's like this why what what what's weird about it like totally fine
S0432	no idea
S0428	last christmas it be his like it's it be his best friend well one of his best friends go in who be marry his like first love and
S0432	your brother's first love
S0428	yeah
S0432	oh god
S0428	and then like she break up with my brother for him yeah
S0432	oh
S0428	so my brother be at the wed so his ex ex his ex
S0428	and another ex be all there and he be just like chat to them all
S0432	oh god
S0428	and like like didn't go and i be just like if i be in that position i would be fume like i'm not
S0432	yeah i would be
S0428	i'm not overly possessive and like i really wouldn't ever stop anyone do anything but not i don't know like
S0432	it's quite
S0428	it's it's extreme i call him the international man of mystery
S0428	cos he's just like
S0432	yeah it's quite funny though that i mean there's nothing wrong with it but it's quite funny that he's kind of just like yeah
S0428	yeah he's see absolutely no
S0432	it's totally fine
S0428	like i really admire him for be able to keep a friendly relationship
S0432	yeah yeah
S0428	i really admire that but there i think there have to be a bite of a line draw at some point where you're like
S0432	yeah
S0428	okay their family
S0432	especially if it's gonna get in between him and his girlfriend
S0428	yeah yeah i won't go to a wed with my ex
S0432	his current girlfriend
S0428	my ex ex's wed
S0428	listen he's just so like

S0428	yeah
S0432	you know there shouldn't be a problem between like
S0428	everyone get on no
S0432	but it's just not the way be it
S0428	i think if him and be live in the same country and like they be live together and their like relationship be like solid solid solid
S0432	mm
S0428	then it would be fine but because she's in he's in
S0432	yeah

S0432	yeah
S0428	all a bite up in the air and it's like they they be only together in for like three or four months before he move to

S0428	so it's not they have
S0432	be that when they first get together as well
S0428	yeah they haven't
S0432	yeah
S0428	have like a good solid patch of like
