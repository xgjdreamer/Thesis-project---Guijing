S0619	only cos i've get you know set test and mark test and i'm get all of these kid to actually write the essay
S0618	oh god
S0619	that they be suppose to have write in sort of in december or november er and then they hand them in and i'm like i don't want them because it mean i have to read them
S0618	yeah
S0619	on top of the twenty eight that i have to mark from the mock exam
S0618	yeah
S0619	and they send it by email and i've just get this constant stream of like email that i've get to do just don't care
S0618	be your work email different to your personal email what i do with mine because it's the same be i on my iphone hide it in a folder that i have to
S0619	uhu
S0618	do about four swipe to get to the folder so whenever i open my phone for everyday function and purpose i didn't see the grow number of email
S0619	nice
S0618	yeah i think it's just a psychological thingy to give you a break from that i guess
S0619	uhu yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	and i'm make like a kind of need analysis by email i think because it's i don't know i think there's something in the this type of way of communication they've get to email me they've get to start with hi it's not like they're fill in a worksheet with how they feel about the course and stuff and da da da
S0618	mm hm
S0619	uh they're just like answer these question by email and i think it sort of doesn't break down a barrier necessarily but it make us a bite more one to one with each student er
S0618	yeah and be you email them back
S0619	yeah and they always try and add
S0618	that's cool
S0619	even if it's oh thank so much we'll look at this
S0618	yeah
S0619	er i've get this i'm get quite stress about two of them
S0618	mm
S0619	and like go home and go how can i solve this problem
S0618	yeah what's the
S0619	and they're just they're shy
S0618	okay
S0619	so i say i be try to talk to yesterday and she be like well you can't change their personalities
S0619	er so not really sure what you want to do it's like i don't want them to fail
S0618	ah
S0619	erm but they're you know they're so shy there's a couple of boys like this and they just won't look er at the person they're talk to
S0618	mm hm
S0619	and they sort of look straight ahead or they look at the table and this boy yesterday he's so sweet and so nice and i just bully him and i be like right you get a point every time you look at your partner and he be like do sort of the quickest movements so he didn't have to look at the person sit next to him
S0618	ah
S0619	and i be like yeah they just need more social skills and social interaction
S0618	mm hm
S0619	and you can see the difference between boys and girls because girls be much more open and personable er the boys be slightly more er
S0618	yeah reticent
S0619	for sure yeah they're just a little bite oh i can't look at someone in the eye it would be weird what
S0618	yeah that's what people do which be normal everyday
S0619	they kind of have this like attitude yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	something attach to it sort of too erm emotional or too i don't know i don't know how to explain it but it's definitely a difference at this age between guy and girls and the girls be like so tell me more tell me more and the boys like just don't look at anywhere apart from at her face
S0619	and then these girls be like well do you're try your best and these boys be just not respond to you

S0619	yeah
S0618	i think now yeah you know i want all of my pay employments forever more to feel this way

S0618	mm
S0619	where as in all the other class
S0618	yeah
S0619	they do
S0618	you can't shut them up and yeah

S0618	you could set them a homework next week of erm when you arrive and you're wait to come into the classroom next week learn something about somebody you've never speak to and that can be your begin of the class thing who do you talk to and what do you learn
S0619	yeah yeah even if they do it in polish like i just want them to talk to each other
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm cos they don't know who they're go to be with in the exams so they and you know they perform much better in the exam if they get on well with the person
S0618	mm hm
S0619	it's just common sense you feel comfortable you feel more relax you have this good relationship and you get score
S0618	certainly level of trust
S0619	you get mark on the relationship you have with the other person
S0618	mm hm
S0619	er so if people come in as friends they do better than people who don't but

S0618	like if i make my bed properly and fold my blanket and stretch my sheet out again and pop my pillow up i think ah it's very invite
S0619	yes
S0618	yeah it's good
S0619	yeah it look great so i think it be good cos it mean you know once a week i really have a motivation to deep clean
S0618	good
S0619	not that sort the person who would notice
S0618	no
S0619	she's one of those like young people who's like i hate clean it's the worst
S0618	but that's another advantage of private students i find it sort of help me keep on top of stuff like that yeah because again i don't really care that much of other people's opinions but i just feel you know to be a professional i need to be offer a professional environment yeah
S0619	yeah so it be it be nice she's just she's not shy she's really outgo she's just really just unsure about her english
S0618	mm
S0619	like she just doesn't think she's good
S0618	that seem to be a common trait in poland lack of confidence
S0619	it's just a yeah it's just a cultural thing i suppose
S0618	mm
S0619	er and i be think about this today and i be gonna ask on twitter so you know in england if you if you're do something would you say oh i'm really not very good at this like as a preface like you know before you do it would you sort of give this disclaimer
S0618	some people do
S0619	yeah
S0618	i tend not to hang around with people like that cos it just seem to me like a little bite of a control drama
S0619	it's too self defecate
S0618	yeah and they're be a bite of a victim and expect some kind of rescuer to say oh no you're not you're great
S0619	yeah uhu
S0618	erm
S0619	yeah it's people who go oh i'm so fat well either you you be fat or you're not fat so er
S0618	yeah
S0619	so you know so i don't know i don't think i'm sort of person who would do that but at the same time i don't think
S0618	i don't think you be
S0619	be that erm i don't think i do things that i can't do or that i'm not very good at i either get good or stop do it
S0618	mm hm i'm just think about
S0619	good at persevere
S0618	you at the gym and
S0619	that's not me go i don't say
S0618	come on you can do it and me tell him to fuck off
S0619	no i don't say erm i'm not very good at this
S0618	yeah
S0619	i just go i can't do this it's fuck stupid because i know my limit and i know i can't actually do it
S0618	so it's a little bite different say i can't do it before you've even try
S0619	yeah but i but i would never go in and be like oh i'm not very strong i'd just go in and be like i be so strong i'm the strongest girl here even if it's not true sometimes i have too high an opinion of like my own er what's the word
S0618	physical capabilities
S0619	thank you
S0618	you're welcome
S0619	physical capabilities er and i'm like yeah i can do that i try to do a pull up the other day i be like right i want to be able to do a pull up by april he be like well have a go now he he he and i just sort of hang there
S0619	he be like go on go on you can do it i be just like hang like a pomegranate be what i think
S0618	oh pomegranate they're in season and in the shop
S0619	be they
S0618	just speak of pomegranates yes i buy one of the other day

S0618	but you will you will
S0619	yeah i will i will move even if i can just do one by april i'll be so enthuse
S0618	god i use to be so strong i suppose i think sort of age eighteen to thirty one
S0619	uhu
S0618	i use to work for this recycle organisation lug wash machine up four flight of stairs with no lift and i go to the gym as well and i use to do pull up and
S0619	yeah
S0618	and those dip things
S0619	uhu
S0618	all sort knock ten out no problem
S0619	mm hm mm hm
S0618	yeah few set
S0619	it's take me forever
S0618	but that's life back in the day
S0619	uhu
S0618	yeah
S0619	it's gonna it's take forever to build that kind of i think you know that's that's real strength
S0618	mm
S0619	like be able to move yourself around and it's fine be able to do these kind of assist things or do things with
S0618	mm hm
S0619	bar bell or do things with weight but that's like the real test of strength in my opinion
S0618	yeah
S0619	so struggle with it but i know that everything will come together eventually
S0618	do you have any core condition class yoga or pilates or anything like that that might i mean seriously
S0619	yeah
S0618	give some think to some pilates particularly as my experience be that everything come from the core
S0619	the core yeah
S0618	so if your core be really strong you'll find it so much easier to do every single other exercise
S0619	uhu and my core isn't strong er in fact my core be incredibly weak it's probably the weakest part so it really affect my balance
S0618	mm okay
S0619	so if i do anything that require balance like lunge or squat
S0618	mm then maybe some yoga
S0619	i'm all over the place so
S0618	yoga's a lot of balance
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	but i'm at the moment i'm every other day that i'm not train with i'm do this core day like core and cardio
S0618	mm good for you yeah
S0619	it's awful er
S0618	i don't necessarily just mean you know like do a hundred sit up or whatever
S0619	yeah i know but it's
S0618	but you know proper stuff like plank and
S0619	yeah
S0618	i suppose pilates get into such technicalities and such tiny tiny movements that can hurt like hell but
S0619	mm hm
S0618	yeah that might be the difference
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	mm so it's all gonna come together though i've get my sort of deadlines
S0618	yay
S0619	so i'm just work towards them basically i can't get less fit i can't less strong
S0618	mm hm
