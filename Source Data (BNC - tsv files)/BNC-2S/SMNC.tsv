S0024	mm
S0144	while this storm's spin around above us then it's actually move about a bite yeah so what be your plan you be gonna say
S0024	what plan
S0144	i think you have a plan
S0024	today
S0144	for our future
S0024	no i say i be gonna spend some time think about it
S0144	oh
S0024	about what to do you know like i i always go oh let's just live in a suburb with a massive garden and grow vegetables and write a book but that's never gonna happen because i'm rubbish erm but this year i've decide my main goal
S0144	mm
S0024	this year my main goal be to improve my organisation and my self discipline
S0144	how be you gonna do that
S0024	by attempt to get things do as soon as i get them like you get that email through say do your visa and you just go and do your visa straight away no dilly dally about no leave it and then forget about the email and write yourself and note and none of that just do it
S0144	mm
S0024	get it do that's my aim and i think i think that and i'd like to start you know just mess about on the computer write some stories and i think well if i can improve my self discipline then i've get more chance of any kind of work at home cos at the moment i'm rubbish at work from home
S0144	mm
S0024	now if i be do make materials or do this or do that i'd just stress myself out to bits it would just be it would be the most stressful job i could have with all these deadlines and approach i'm be like it would just be on my mind for three weeks of the month and then in the last week it i'd be panic something like that so i need to adjust my myself yeah that's my aim this year be to just get job do as they come
S0144	mm
S0024	and then i because i think anything that we do in the future if we've get a chance of work from home it would be good but neither of us have the self discipline to work from it so
S0144	no
S0024	so i need that skill
S0144	i when we when we be in oman i do
S0024	not work from home but
S0144	no but
S0024	you have the discipline
S0144	cos i have to
S0024	yeah have too much work to fit in that's why
S0144	yeah i think i'm always look for how to make my life easier
S0024	it doesn't make your life easier we have to
S0144	yeah
S0024	do paperwork we have to do it
S0024	and get it do
S0144	yeah
S0024	otherwise it's just in your mind and then and then you rush about try to do it and then you think it's really difficult for
S0144	that sound like quite an easy aim to be honest
S0024	no i don't think it be i've be try to do it for twenty years like i've be try to to to organise myself every year that that's one of my erm
S0144	all you need to do be just take action on the begin
S0024	well can you do it then
S0144	yeah
S0024	right will you do the tax form tonight
S0144	no
S0024	well then
S0024	let's just get it all do
S0144	i've get other things to do tonight
S0024	do you see that lightning well exactly that's what it's all about
S0144	well what about your chinese be you still gonna study that
S0024	yeah i've be study every day
S0144	oh
S0024	look er look i've get it right next to me
S0144	oh yeah well that's another aim
S0024	yeah
S0144	just do your hs course the test
S0024	no it doesn't matter about the test really but it's a good thing to aim for isn't it to try and learn all the vocabulary
S0144	i think it's a good thing to do a test it's pretty cheap isn't it
S0024	yeah
S0144	to take it you might as well get it and stick it on your cv that you've get elementary
S0024	yeah
S0144	chinese language
S0024	yeah
S0144	it's not a bad thing to have
S0024	mm
S0144	and you're pretty much there already to get the elementary one
S0024	i need vocabulary there's a bite of grammar i'm short on too that i keep forget
S0144	yeah but
S0024	mm
S0144	i think that's a good thing
S0024	mm
S0144	i mean once you've get that
S0024	i can't believe 's catch up so fast
S0144	yeah
S0024	mm
S0144	well she just go blab to everyone doesn't she
S0024	yeah
S0144	that's the best way to learn a language
S0024	yeah
S0144	plus she speak five languages anyway and she's get a knack for it
S0024	she know to yeah she have get a knack she just know
S0144	mm
S0024	know what what have to be do
S0144	yeah
S0024	i've never be very good have i
S0144	well the main thing
S0024	it's
S0144	be just use it
S0024	that's why
S0144	and not be shy about make mistake
S0024	yeah that's i've be but 's really really good in one way but in another way not so because she she do she doesn't ever correct me but she do give me if i'm struggle ways of say things but she's really really good to talk to and she she work out what you're say so easily not many people can do that
S0144	mm
S0024	she could be a teacher of chinese because she just she just work out what's she talk okay she must be say this
S0144	mm
S0024	and i'm say it completely wrong most of the time but what she doesn't pick me up on be my pronunciation she repeat it back to me completely different from what i've say and then er but she understand
S0144	mm
S0024	just from my gesture and things so i think when i go to speak to other people i'm not as good cos with she she kind of know what i'm talk about
S0144	no but it's gonna be helpful though
S0024	and she know my mistake oh yeah oh yeah i've learn load of vocab already this week like little bits and bob i learn sock i learn weight and just even if it's
S0144	sock be
S0024	no
S0144	no oh what be it
S0024	that's a hat
S0144	oh
S0024	it's a bite that's a hat
S0144	a hat sock be something se

S0144	
S0024	they say that people from er haven't get a very good accent
S0144	really
S0024	yeah couldn't believe it i say but surely it's gotta be better than ningboese and he go and say oh what do you think of the anhui accent and she say oh
S0144	where be anhui
S0024	it's just northwest of here it's not far away not far away but it's ningboese where they've get completely different word
S0144	what you mean near
S0024	in the vocabulary and well it's in it's northwest of here closer to here than
S0144	right
S0024	just about half half an hour forty minutes away from here but they don't speak the ningboese
S0144	okay

S0144	or
S0024	yeah in do you research that

S0024	you be gonna have a look at how cold it be in in february
S0144	yeah i imagine it would be pretty cold but
S0024	colder than the north of
S0144	probably not so that might be an option
S0144	or
S0144	do you fancy
S0024	i'd like to stop in again at some point
S0144	there's a week
S0024	cos we we be just too poor there where we go
S0144	yeah
S0024	like i think you need to some some cities you just need money some cities you need to be poor in because you experience it better some cities you need to have some money
S0144	yeah well we didn't eat anything we just eat plain rice i think cos that's all we could afford last time
S0024	we stay in that shitty little room with just a bed
S0144	yeah
S0024	wall all the way round the bed
S0024	it be horrible
S0144	yeah i think that's just isn't it
S0024	er
S0144	no we be
S0024	no room be small they have to be small don't they
S0144	yeah
S0024	but that be that be ridiculous and that
S0144	and we be live off about twenty dollars a day
S0144	in
S0024	i don't think you could do now i don't what we use to do i don't think you could do anymore
S0144	no
S0024	i don't think you can be such a poor traveller anymore oh gosh she's so heavy i nearly she just
S0144	yeah
S0024	tip
S0144	but that that's quite a long time isn't it three weeks
S0024	yeah i think it's quite a long it be quite a long holiday whether
S0144	cos i'd need
S0024	you'd want another week somewhere instead
S0144	i don't know if i do want three weeks
S0024	three whole weeks holiday be quite a lot unless you've get a definite plan i mean your brother's wed that's that's basically the well we might as well take the last week be start on the twenty third and take that
S0144	the last week
S0024	yeah so that's
S0144	oh you've gotta finish the holiday in
S0024	yeah yes we do we have to finish
S0144	oh shit
S0024	the holiday in er yes we're teach on the second of march so twenty third er unless we leave the day after the wed and spend a week somewhere we could do that if you leave the day after the wed
S0144	well we can't leave the day after the wed well but hang over
S0024	well not the day after then the day after that and then you could have like six days no we'll six days somewhere
S0144	mm
S0024	or you've get to get back here and recover too
S0144	shit
S0024	yeah mm
S0144	well maybe then we could
S0024	on the way back
S0144	mm
S0024	on the way back i mean could we get different flight like stop in on the way there and
S0144	okay yeah okay
S0024	stop and come back on the flight
S0144	alright let's have a a week in a week in
S0024	mm
S0144	and then a week in
S0024	yeah
S0024	yeah
S0144	that sound fuck awesome
S0024	like and then we wouldn't have to pay for any flight
S0144	but be that too much travel
S0024	yeah
S0144	i mean we'd have to do the distance anyway
S0024	we have yeah the distance be the same as wherever we would
S0144	but it's break it up
S0024	yeah so from an airport i mean i wouldn't be be er i mean i'd get taxis i'm not gonna wait around for bus and stuff
S0144	well no well we've get
S0024	with her i just get have to travel light

S0144	that's all good
S0024	on the way back we buy load of stuff we buy load of electronic stuff
S0144	yeah
S0024	i mean that's why they be that heavy i mean it would be expensive cos we'd you know have people like get a taxi straight to a hotel put our bag down like you can do it we can do it it's not impossible
S0144	alright
S0024	once you're in the hotel and if you know it's not like we use to move about

S0144	the flight will be completely free
S0024	the flight be free yeah
S0144	but not for her
S0024	oh not for her
S0144	but we have to go to anyway so there's no gonna be no difference
S0024	another option
S0144	and if we do it in advance we could do it with british airways which be a a lot cheaper
