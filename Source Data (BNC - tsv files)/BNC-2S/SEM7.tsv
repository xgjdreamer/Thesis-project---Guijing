S0557	yeah erm yeah just get an email from the bt scheme thing it's like an in house thing that sound really good didn't get that
S0539	oh
S0557	it's just so hard like all the psychometric test that they expect you to do and then
S0539	oh my god i know
S0557	the assessment centre and stuff i just don't know how anyone get employ i really don't
S0539	yeah well the psychometric test i i don't know they're a bite strange really aren't they and so abstract
S0557	i know yeah
S0539	like didn't you say you get that that weird question
S0557	yeah it wasn't anything to do with law it be just like palm read but it be really hard like a massive paragraph and the amount i know it's all mean to be how you deal with time pressure and stuff
S0539	yeah
S0557	but it be about fifty question in twelve minutes like massive paragraph and then like and then the actual question itself be like four line long
S0539	mm
S0557	it be just ridiculous
S0539	well uni when i be apply to there they say well i didn't know this but i want to go to the open day
S0557	mm
S0539	but it be fully book i only find out about it like a month before it be
S0557	the postgrad open day
S0539	yeah yeah
S0557	yeah
S0539	and they didn't like tell us it be happen on our course which be quite annoy when i'm like a student there
S0557	yeah
S0539	and i can't even attend cos it be fully book but erm because i i'd in express an interest in it
S0557	mm
S0539	they like email me to say erm like to give me the information on like the powerpoints and stuff that they'd
S0557	yeah
S0539	present in the open day and
S0557	yeah
S0539	they say that they don't even read your application so you spend like so long on your personal statement and everything like that
S0557	yeah
S0539	and they don't even look at it it's all base on this psychometric test and they
S0557	it shouldn't just be that that should be in addition to
S0539	i know well they justify it by say that like they don't want to erm you know advantage students that come from like wealthier background but i don't understand
S0557	no it should just be as a whole
S0539	yeah surely students that come from
S0557	yeah
S0539	more privilege background will be able to get people to answer the question for them you know
S0557	yeah
S0539	it should be base on the experience you have and things
S0557	it should be everything overall like you know you might not be as strong as that but you might have load of experience to talk about
S0539	yeah yeah
S0557	so cos i have quite a lot of experience i think but
S0539	yeah
S0557	obviously not
S0539	no i think the application itself and your personal statement be a pretty a good indicator rather than your answer on a test really
S0557	yeah it show how you like you really want it and stuff and what you can offer to the course doesn't it
S0539	yeah
S0557	i dunno i think i'll do the master for a year and that give me a bite longer to decide what i'm actually gonna do
S0539	mm
S0557	yeah so erm what do you do this weekend do you say

S0539	everything so she's move down there now but she have like an amaze flat in glasgow in
S0557	yeah
S0539	it be so nice and she's still get like a nice flat but it's a lot smaller than the one in glasgow
S0557	well it's just not the same value for money be it
S0539	no not at all
S0557	you'd literally get a studio flat in london for like eight hundred pound a month
S0539	yeah yeah well she be pay i think like three fifty in glasgow for a really nice a really nice flat like right in the centre
S0557	how much be she pay sorry
S0539	three fifty i think
S0557	and she be halve that
S0539	with all the bill in no she wasn't halve it that be
S0557	that be just what it be
S0539	yeah
S0557	no way really
S0539	her share it with someone else for three fifty each
S0557	oh i be gonna say
S0539	but erm but now she's in i think she pay like seven hundred
S0557	yeah each
S0539	yeah each for a one bed
S0557	that's ridiculous
S0539	flat and quite a way out of the centre
S0557	be she happy there though
S0539	i think she be yeah i mean there's plenty go on all the time and stuff and she's with now which be good like
S0557	yeah
S0539	they only use to see each other like every few months or whatever so
S0539	yeah but she's still have to travel quite a lot up to like
S0557	yeah
S0539	we stay at erm 's on
S0557	er do you ever get get a taxi back to hers then like how much be that
S0539	yeah we oh i can't remember i don't think it be too bad because they have this app call like uber

S0539	yeah i'd never hear of it
S0557	yeah it's mean to be really good yeah
S0539	yeah so it's
S0557	i don't know what it be really it's just
S0539	well it's like people that have like cars and be free that even i think and like they check them out
S0557	oh be it i think it be just like a an er just a different taxi service
S0539	no no
S0557	and like you can just do it on your phone and then you see who's available i didn't know it be like random people
S0539	i don't i don't know i think it be
S0557	be that safe

S0557	i dunno we'll we'll google it later
S0539	i'm not sure so yeah we stay at 's on sunday night
S0557	yeah

S0557	oh she fly there then
S0539	yeah yeah
S0557	be that not a bite of a faff with like security and stuff do
S0539	oh i think it's a lot quicker than get the erm the train there so
S0557	really though cos you have to get there like two hours before then wait and then

S0557	but i mean i i i i don't think there's like a one set time for everyone but
S0539	no no but at the same time there's like no need to rush into things i don't think

S0557	maybe like two years
S0539	mm that's not long be it
S0557	but they've they've have a they've get a baby that's almost a year old

S0539	really
S0557	well i feel like sometimes i do like when i think of name i'm like oh that'd be kind of nice
S0557	but they just annoy me
S0539	yeah
S0557	like fit in with school the bore school routine like every morning you can't just have a spontaneous weekend away and just take the excitement out of everything
S0539	yeah
S0557	it's just bore and mundane like i feel like there's a lot of good things out of it you know it's obviously a very reward experience but
S0539	yeah
S0557	i don't know
S0539	no i definitely don't want children yet i want to go travel and things i know you can take like children with you obviously but it's a lot harder

S0557	what
S0539	yeah

S0557	like and and also like have you see in america they they go round with the barcode scanners
S0539	oh yeah
S0557	like you put they put it on your list or whatever what's it call there's a name for it
S0539	oh i don't know but yeah i know what you mean
S0557	you know what i mean and i think that's rude to let you
S0539	yeah yeah
S0557	i i think it's just what i i dunno i'm not gonna contribute to their holiday like if they can't afford to have a holiday then don't get marry like
S0539	no you shouldn't request unless it's like erm money towards charity or something instead of a gift you can sort of understand that but
S0557	yeah i personally i i've just get them a voucher
S0539	yeah
S0557	erm
S0539	yeah well i think that's fair enough
S0557	so yeah
S0539	i don't i don't think my mum and dad will be ask for any wed gift at all
S0557	oh it's polite though to get something isn't it
S0539	mm they're all there now aren't they
S0557	
S0539	a log basket probably

S0557	yeah well they own their own business don't they but it's erm
S0539	yeah
S0557	it's lovely it's so nice it's probably like eight hundred thousand
S0539	mm good grief do they just
S0557	they have like a pond and
S0539	do they just have the then or do they have any other
S0557	just the as far as i know
S0539	mm
S0557	but that's do well obviously as you know
S0539	oh yeah
S0557	so yeah
S0539	i'm still wait for our free meal there
S0557	yeah i know well we get free coffee but
S0539	yeah free meal would be nice
S0557	i mean i don't know if we go in for dinner they'd probably give us a discount i'm sure
S0539	yeah
S0557	but erm yeah
S0539	ah so how often be you see her now it seem to be all the time
S0557	
S0539	yeah
S0557	well when i'm at uni mum see her erm she see her monday thursday sometimes at the weekend
S0539	mm
S0557	and then obviously when i'm home erm i'm only back for a month till the eighth so i'm just gonna see her as much as i can in this month while i can and then obviously mum bring her up at the weekend occasionally to see me in
S0539	ah
S0557	but yeah it's a nice little arrangement
S0539	do you think you'll get like a dog any time soon if
S0557	think it'll have to be when i move out because obviously the rent situation
S0539	yeah
S0557	so that's a shame
S0539	so do they say a definite no then
S0557	she didn't no she just didn't get back to us
S0539	oh
S0557	so i assume erm you know for the amount we're pay and like we're obviously really close like my mum buy them christmas present
S0539	do she
S0557	like they're really close like they they meet up and stuff because
S0539	oh right
S0557	like her and her husband and my mum and dad like you'd think she'd you know
S0539	yeah be a bite more lay back
S0557	yeah exactly she know like we're not gonna do anything that's gonna oh well it's fine
S0539	oh that's a shame
S0557	i'll just get one myself
S0539	yeah
S0557	but she's so funny she's such a wuss like she's scar of the dark
S0539	ah
S0557	a little puppy come in yesterday erm to the mum be say and she just run away she's so funny
S0539	ah
S0557	she's a lovely dog
S0539	i really want a dog
S0557	mm
S0539	so have you think about where you're gonna live next year if you stay in
S0557	er grad college
S0539	be you
S0557	i wasn't gonna pay but i i think i dunno i'd prefer to be close to the library
S0539	mm
S0557	cos my internet's so bad i just can't really do you know what i mean and er i i don't drive at the minute so i think i'll just be at grad college
S0539	yeah be it expensive
S0557	er i think it's just the same really as the dorms but it's it's a nicer standard
S0539	yeah it look really
S0557	you've get the
S0539	be it quite new the grad college
S0557	yeah yeah i think so they've update it yeah
S0539	yeah yeah i haven't be in but it look nice
S0557	you know it's a couple of thousand pound more in debt than i already be so it won't make much difference
S0557	to be honest i probably won't pay it back anyway
S0539	so how much be the master
S0557	erm six thousand i think isn't it in
S0539	oh right okay so similar to mine then
S0557	mm
S0539	what and then you'll do your lpc after that will you
S0557	well the lpc qualify me as a solicitor but erm the master isn't a full master so you're pay for that with the element of risk that you might not get a train contract
S0539	right
S0557	so if i do a master i can do anything with that and then if i get a train contract then they'll pay for me to do the lpc
S0539	yeah that's good
S0539	so you'll apply
S0557	so i think i'd prefer to do that really than the one
S0539	you'll apply for the train contract before you do your master will you
S0557	yeah
S0539	yeah
S0557	but you have to do scheme and they're so competitive for like a two week placement you have to do the assessment centre and all that stuff
S0539	yeah
S0557	it's a bite ridiculous
S0539	yeah
S0557	yeah
S0539	i'll have to erm start apply for assistant psychologist post
S0557	yeah when be you do that
S0539	well there's no point at the moment
S0557	mm
S0539	i think i teach finish in march and then i've just get my dissertation to do
S0557	yeah
S0539	then we graduate in september so i guess like over the summer i can start sort of apply for things
S0557	yeah
S0539	and see if anything come up there's actually be i i actually get two interview like just i'd i apply for them like just before i start my master cos i think
S0557	yeah
S0539	well if i do get one
S0557	yeah
S0539	like i'd probably go for that instead of do my master
S0557	yeah
S0539	but yeah as soon as i start i get two interview in like the same week
S0557	mm
S0539	it's just typical isn't it like you
S0557	do you not go no
S0539	well no there be no point then cos i'd pay all my fee and everything
S0557	just yeah but you don't know though that you they could've say well we'll have you after your master if you impress them
S0539	no i don't it it doesn't really work like that
S0557	yeah
S0539	i think they need someone there and then really
S0557	that's fine
S0539	but yeah yeah it be
S0557	where be where be they at then
S0539	i think one be in
S0557	mm
S0539	and then oh i think one might've be in like or somewhere like that
S0557	oh you say that
S0539	yeah
S0557	oh right yeah would you move there then
S0539	i don't know like it's a bite of a commute isn't it but
S0557	yeah yeah
S0539	yeah maybe
S0557	yeah people like live in and commute nowadays
S0539	i think
S0557	cos it's so much cheaper commute to london
S0539	yeah yeah it's crazy
S0539	i think i'll just have to apply like everywhere after i graduate though and see
S0557	yeah
S0539	but there have there's there's be more job available round here lately i've notice
S0557	have there
S0539	yeah
S0539	for assistant psychologist post
S0557	oh right whereabouts then like round edinburgh way or
S0539	no round us like
S0557	oh right
S0539	well no no i haven't see any in lancaster actually and
S0557	yeah
S0539	like and erm yeah there there be one in actually with like uni i think that be more research though
S0557	good
S0539	yeah so it's look a bite more promise really
S0557	i think it's improve now isn't it cos in the in the in the decline or whatever it's get better the job market
S0539	yeah hopefully
S0557	mm
S0539	we'll have to see and then i think a few people on my course be like gonna do phds but
S0557	oh yeah do you not oh no you're do your
S0539	yeah well if i do a phd that would be like three years
S0557	be that different to the doctorate
S0539	yeah
S0557	would you pursue that if you didn't do the
S0539	no er i think if you want to do phd you're kind of er want to go into academia so like lecture and things like that but
S0557	oh really
S0539	yeah but the doctorate be for your clinical or educational train
S0557	oh right
S0539	so you're train to be an educal educational clinical psychologist so
S0557	yeah i would not want to be a lecturer
S0539	no
S0557	have you even get to yet
S0539	i'm not no no cos 's like literally just outside
S0557	oh be it
S0539	but we weren't stop
S0557	i might nip to the loo as well
S0539	yeah we weren't really stop for that long be we
S0557	no i think it be gonna be half an hour
S0539	yeah
S0557	maybe it mean like near the we have to stop
S0539	the train erm back will probably be delay by a bite as well i think
S0557	i hope not cos it's gonna be quite late isn't it when we get in
S0539	do we change on the way back
S0557	i don't think so
S0539	no er i didn't think it say a change but
S0557	i think it's just direct
S0539	yeah you use to have to change at but maybe they've change that now
S0557	will we find out like when we get back on or
S0539	we can just look it up on our phone it'll say if there's any change or not
S0557	yeah okay
S0539	but i didn't think there be
S0557	i think no i don't think so i'll have a look but
S0539	be your mum okay to
S0557	yeah yeah
S0539	pick us up then
S0557	that's fine i just didn't want it too late if it's delay by lot it should be fine
S0539	yeah they generally catch up time anyway though actually
S0557	yeah
S0539	it's generally not too bad
S0557	erm would it say if there's change
S0539	yeah it should do you you might have to go onto like the actual
S0557	just to no it doesn't say anything about
S0539	yeah oh that's good then
S0557	we'll have a look nearer the time
