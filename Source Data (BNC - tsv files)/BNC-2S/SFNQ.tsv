S0237	yeah they're always like erm oh no la like they'll always say la after everything and i think it's like and i be read about it
S0192	yeah
S0237	cos it's really interest like in what sort of situations it happen but i think every article on the internet be wrong to be honest
S0192	okay
S0237	i've read load and i be like
S0192	that's a great topic
S0237	and i be like i've be there and that's not right i know it's not right and i know it's not right and
S0192	no they're generalise
S0237	so a lot cos a lot of them be like oh blah blah er they only use it in this situation and i be like they use it all the time
S0192	all the time
S0237	like
S0192	what do it mean then that suffix
S0237	it doesn't really mean anything
S0192	no
S0237	it just it's just like a emphasis i guess
S0192	like a discourse marker type of thing yeah
S0237	yeah it's not even it's not even anything my dad doesn't do it now
S0192	be it kind of like do you get me
S0237	yeah it's kind of like that
S0192	do you get me
S0237	someone will i'll be like like if my sister if my dad's sister and he be talk erm he'll say oh you know she'll be like oh like why be you put that in the rice la like why be you do it like that la like she's like
S0192	oh okay

S0237	it's really good though
S0237	erm but i be but i just
S0192	well that's perfect isn't it you've find a perfect topic
S0237	i be kinda like i wanna go there and do my research
S0192	yeah
S0237	and then i start look at flight
S0192	yeah
S0237	and then my whole afternoon just disappear
S0192	and you've get family and everything out there that can put you up
S0237	mm yeah but my family be a bite weird they're all
S0192	why be they weird
S0237	my auntie like a couple of them they're all really religious why's it suddenly go dark zombie apocalypse
S0192	yeah i know it's like it's gonna rain or something yeah

S0237	erm they're all really religious but like erm i dunno they're just not very they're still very not very westernise
S0192	no okay
S0237	so
S0192	so you feel a bite uncomfortable around them
S0237	i can do it for a little while but i wouldn't do it for er any amount of time
S0192	but to go over there and do some research
S0237	yeah it'd be so good
S0192	you could get they'd put you up and you could live with them yeah
S0237	i would love that i be look at flight i be think i could go like maybe in the easter holiday then that's probably too late but er this isn't due like till september be it
S0192	no it's not till september i don't think we're mean to begin collect our research until we finish the second semester so i reckon
S0237	oh right
S0192	you probably need to know what you're do and maybe have a literature review and all that kind of stuff
S0237	cos we we get a month off yeah we get a month off in easter so i be like i could go in the easter holiday
S0192	sound like a great idea
S0237	it'd be so good
S0192	and i mean as they want people to be research other languages as well
S0237	yeah
S0192	you've get a in have you finish that
S0237	think so
S0192	thank you very much you've give me your soul wah ha ha

S0192	oh no
S0237	and i erm
S0192	which subject
S0237	erm discourse and i don't know language and social discourse what's it call hold on
S0192	yeah i don't know
S0237	discourse of social and personal identity
S0192	oh that's very neat isn't it
S0237	isn't that i've get my my welcome to the school of english and my induction schedule
S0192	you're very very organise
S0237	i think it be pretty good
S0192	you have to be at this level don't you
S0237	yeah
S0192	how do this uni compare to your last uni like with what they expect from you and all that kind of stuff have you notice a step up from
S0237	i don't really yeah i don't really know yet because i feel like i haven't really meet any of the lecturers on like a
S0192	yeah
S0237	but at my old uni i i dunno yeah like a lot be expect from me but like i just get on really well with most of my tutor so it be fine so
S0192	yeah
S0237	i use to go also i like do things that be a bite different so i use to have ideas for like essay and stuff which wouldn't be like the kind of standard stuff and they'd love that they be like oh yeah like do something different that's really cool
S0192	oh that's good
S0237	but i dunno whether they'll like that here
S0192	erm they're quite they're renowned for be a leave wing university here aren't they
S0237	yeah
S0192	so maybe you've come to the right place
S0237	hope so
S0192	maybe if you do that kind of stuff
S0237	i hope so
S0192	push the boundaries get out there
S0237	i dunno
S0192	so you haven't you haven't even be to that class yet then the discourse of social and personal identity
S0237	no how bad be that
S0192	be that an undergraduate module that one
S0237	yeah i think so
S0192	yeah
S0237	i email her
S0192	so you're do two undergraduate modules
S0237	yeah
S0192	what's the other one
S0237	forensic
S0192	oh yeah you do say that
S0237	that be quite good though it's a bite weird
S0192	yeah
S0237	i dunno
S0192	i i be interest in it but i just think it's very narrow
S0237	mm
S0192	kinda like
S0237	i don't know anything
S0192	but then i'm do syntax
S0237	i don't know anything about it
S0192	and that's extremely narrow
S0237	mine's like you have to go and you have to go and visit a law court
S0192	oh god
S0237	and then
S0192	it's like legalese and all that kind of stuff
S0237	yeah i be a bite like really
S0192	mm
S0237	i want to write about judge judy
S0192	be you a fan be you
S0237	i be a fan
S0237	but apparently that's not well i don't think that there's room for that
S0192	you're not allow no okay
S0237	but i think i think i could do really i be like yeah i can do a really interest essay on like how judge judy be like you know have all the legal discourse but also erm er appeal to popular culture and i be like
S0192	okay
S0237	it'd be such a good essay
S0192	yeah
S0237	and i be like oh do that
S0192	do you bring it up in class
S0237	no
S0192	no okay
S0237	i be like i don't think that's really
S0192	this isn't gonna fit do you find it a bite weird be with undergraduate students or
S0237	no 's
S0192	i suppose the age difference isn't too
S0237	be her name yeah 's in that
S0192	oh she's in that as well
S0237	erm and i think she might be in my other one as well but no cos a couple of
S0237	in forensic linguistics there's a couple of part time master people as well
S0192	oh okay
S0237	so i sit with them last week but they be like
S0192	that's not too bad
S0237	they have you know when they have that know look about them where they're like just you wait
S0192	it's come
S0237	they be like so you're do a master in linguistics too and i be like yeah i'm do it full time and they be like ah
S0192	yeah
S0192	so i must've choose the weird modules that nobody want to do then cos i've do two undergraduate modules also pidgins and creoles and syntactic theory i'm the only master student in in both class
S0237	be you really
S0192	so
S0237	i be gonna do syntactic theory but erm
S0237	then she put me on
S0192	bet you'd be glad you didn't
S0237	i say i'd prefer to do be that really bore
S0192	it's it's not really bore it's very conceptual
S0237	yeah
S0192	it's very like and er the the problem i've get like the first class i felt i know what i be talk about and i could comment and all that kind of stuff but today they've already be do tree structure and all that kind of stuff which i've never study before so
S0237	mm
S0192	i felt a little bite under everyone
S0237	be they so when er they say undergraduate module be they third years
S0192	they're third years yeah
S0237	yeah okay
S0192	third years so they're final year undergraduate i think it be a bite strange that we can take undergraduate modules
S0237	yeah i know
S0192	and they kind of ask me how come you i didn't really have an answer for them i be like i dunno
S0192	i be like
S0237	cos they haven't get enough for us probably
S0192	yeah
S0192	well i be like it's cos i'm do you know more modules i presume that they be do only three modules cos in my university we do three modules a semester
S0237	yeah we do four
S0192	you do four
S0237	yeah
S0192	they're do four here
S0237	oh be they
S0192	yeah i guess be just really kind of relax
S0192	it's definitely a different standard here
S0237	be it
S0192	like yeah i er look back i realise how the standard be definitely lower at
S0237	do you think so
S0192	yeah i think so
S0237	i think sometimes i get piece of work back and i think that definitely wasn't a first and i get give a first so
S0192	you get a first oh
S0237	not overall like
S0192	yeah what do you get overall
S0237	two one
S0192	two one
S0192	which percentage
S0237	oh only like er well like sixty five so comfy
S0192	yeah that's good yeah a good solid two one
S0237	yeah i do really
S0192	i get sixty seven
S0237	that's really good
S0192	it be i just make up the whole thing didn't i it be just creative write so
S0237	i do really badly in my second year i don't know why i be work like in a shop and i work days a week and i just didn't er like wasn't bother and i start get two twos and i think
S0192	yeah
S0237	that's er obviously the best i can do so i'm not gonna try
S0192	yeah
S0237	and then i don't really know what happen but something make me freak out and i be like i really don't wanna leave this uni with a two two that'd be awful
S0192	no
S0237	so i be like okay
S0192	thank god you didn't
S0237	i know i be like you really need to step it up so i like in my third year i didn't work so i have load more time
S0192	yeah yeah yeah it's important isn't it
S0237	erm and i like pull my grade up like in second year i finish on a fifty eight i think and er
S0192	and finish on a sixty five that's a big
S0237	and yeah
S0192	big pull up
S0237	and and in third year i think i actually like get like er overall like obviously cos it level out but i think i get like a sixty eight so i pull it up like a good ten mark so i be like
S0192	nice so you must've get a couple of firsts in there yeah
S0237	yeah i do i get a first on a shakespeare essay
S0192	oh wow
S0237	that be my proudest moment
S0192	i can't stand shakespeare
S0237	that be my best moment
S0192	i get one first in my entire degree
S0237	and what be that
S0192	i be consistently hit sixty fives to sixty sevens like the whole time
S0237	yeah i be the same
S0192	but like i get one for it be er it be the module be call into print
S0237	mm
S0192	so the whole idea of the module be to get publish in as many things as you could
S0237	oh that's cool
S0192	and i i write quite a bite for my university magazine
S0237	be it like a competition who can get publish the most
S0192	yeah i mean effectively yeah to a certain degree it be
S0237	that's really good
S0192	yeah erm so it be all about you know how you approach publishers and how you do all that kinda of stuff
S0237	yeah
S0192	and erm i through that module i end up be the music editor for my university magazine
S0237	oh
S0192	cos i write for them and then i take over the job i win a short story competition
S0237	that's so good
S0192	erm i also win er another well actually i come as a runner up in a competition but the winner couldn't do it so do you know ents24
S0237	no
S0192	it's like see ticket or like ticketmaster
S0237	oh yeah
S0192	it's like this kind of thing
S0237	okay yeah yeah
S0192	so they have a competition they come to our uni and say you know we're gonna ask people to write some piece and and if you win the competition then we're gonna send you off to review these band so
S0237	wow
S0192	i have to go and interview the band afterwards do you know kosheen at all
S0237	no
S0192	they're like er ah you'd like them i think they're like electronic dancey female singer
S0237	yeah
S0192	good lively band i have to go and interview them at which be quite cool
S0237	that's so good
S0192	so yeah i get seventy two in that module
S0237	that's a pretty good module isn't it cos it's kind of like prepare you for for real life
S0192	yeah it's vocational isn't it you've gotta go out and do the actual thing yeah
S0237	definitely
S0192	but i go to uni to do drama not to do creative write
S0237	how do you end up do
S0192	because well i tell you i do terribly in my a level and i just i manage to get into university with one b and one d that's it
S0237	that's
S0192	like two grade and but the year i after i go they change the grade and bring the grade up so i kind of get in
S0237	just before yeah
S0192	be really lucky and then i change and have i apply to creative write or english i don't think i'd've get in but my drama grade be a b erm but i do drama and it be all theory there be no performance in it
S0237	oh no
S0192	and i be like this be really bore so er i start i end up do a major minor so i minored in drama and major in creative write
S0237	oh do you oh that's cool that's really good
S0192	mm
S0237	do you do like scriptwriting and stuff
S0192	yeah i do do a module on scriptwriting
S0237	be you interest in that
S0192	i be yeah but the script that i write be a bite erm in your face out there i don't know if i think my lecturer like it but i think everyone else just think i be weird so i kind of
S0192	make me feel a bite strange afterwards look back
S0237	yeah
S0192	have a good degree though i enjoy it
S0237	i almost do a whole degree in creative write i'm very glad i didn't
S0192	yeah
S0237	cos i didn't do very well in that so er
S0192	why didn't you do well what be what be wrong with your write
S0237	just cos it be like erm i can't write poetry and it be
S0192	ah i never take any poetry modules
S0237	and it be load of poetry and and i be
S0192	do you not have a choice
S0237	it be only poetry and short stories and that be it
S0192	oh
S0237	and like i think there be like a like a scriptwriting
S0192	yeah
S0237	module and then in third year there be like a radio drama module
S0192	yeah
S0237	erm which i i'm not interest in either
S0192	no
S0237	so i be a bite like well this isn't really i think there'd be more choice i think there'd be more like scope so i could do like journalism stuff and like travel write and make i dunno i could probably do short stories but i just mm
S0192	yeah i do a travel write module
S0237	that's really cool yeah
S0192	which i love and i do really well in that erm i also do a science fiction and fantasy module
S0237	oh really
S0192	i quite like sci fi so
S0237	yeah
S0192	that be good and then obviously that into print scriptwriting and then i have to do novel write twice er novel write part one and then novel write part two
S0237	oh blimey
S0192	effectively my dissertation be just try to write a novel
S0237	do you write a novel
S0192	er i've never finish one i've start four novels
S0237	really
S0192	yeah and i write i do like the first third of the book so i write like twenty thousand word thirty thousand word
S0237	that's crazy
S0192	forty thousand word
S0237	yeah
S0192	and then i i decide that what i'm gonna write next be too difficult that i
S0192	i can't possibly write it so i get bore of it and start something else
S0237	i've start i use to start numerous piece of write and then like i be like when i start like my master i be gonna write a book i'm gonna write a book this be gonna be awesome and i sit down with my laptop write like a page and i be like yeah that's really good i'll write again some more tomorrow and then i be like no
S0192	no
S0237	no
S0192	it's really difficult to write a book hell of a lot of
S0237	i know but then i go back and i read it and i'm like that's rubbish
S0192	yeah
S0237	what be i think
S0192	yeah it's embarrass isn't it i've go back and read a few things and go oh my god
S0237	yeah
S0192	not only that but my grammar be terrible
S0237	oh really
S0192	this be the point actually because i don't remember them teach me grammar at school and
S0237	no i don't think i be really teach
S0192	i go into this class and of course i hadn't be study english for the last few years i'd be do drama and not really go to school at all and the first class that i take in we sit down he say right let's introduce ourselves go round the class and say your name and with the first letter of your name an adjective that describe you and he ask me first i go completely blank i didn't i couldn't tell you what an adjective be at the time
S0192	terrible terrible
S0237	but what do you do you freak out
S0192	i just er i just tell him i say i'm sorry i i just i don't know
S0237	i don't know
S0192	yeah and he that same lecturer i have him the first year and i have him in the third year and he tell me in the third year he say at the begin of the course when i meet you your creative level be quite high but your technical level be very low but he say by the end of the course you've really bring your technical level up because
S0237	oh that's really good
S0192	yeah cos i erm i end up i get i didn't wanna sound like an idiot in class so i i take a couple of tefl certificate to do my grammar
S0237	oh okay yeah
S0192	i start do volunteer teach with the students i start study japanese at the uni and like stuff like that so i just really focus on like improve my grammar so i kind of bring it back up
S0237	that's really good
S0192	and turn out we're now study grammar as a master
S0237	i know do you feel like cos you be so cos you've do so much creative write that like academic writing's a bite like difficult or like hard or
S0192	i'm a bite nervous i'm a bite nervous to be honest with you
S0237	cos i've do so much academic write but you're like the complete opposite
S0192	yeah i'm quite worry to tell you honestly erm i think i've get the ideas and stuff but i
S0237	yeah
S0192	not sure if i've get the framework
S0237	i know so i know a lot of people as well like who i've kind of not get the ideas but i can write really well so
S0192	yeah
S0237	quite often i can just pull stuff off cos i'm a bite like in exams
S0192	i might have to come to you then
S0192	when the as well
S0237	in exams if i'm like i haven't get a clue what that question mean i'll just like kind of wing it
S0192	yeah
S0237	but i know other people who have such good ideas but just can't like convey them
S0192	construct it properly
S0237	yeah
S0192	i've be i've buy a couple of book on how to write essay recently so i'm just try to read up on that and catch up
S0237	ah i don't know how to reference here either i need to go and talk to someone about that
S0192	yeah
S0237	cos it's different than how i use to do it so
S0192	well there's a document online
S0237	oh be there
S0192	yeah they post it erm
S0192	the ma english english department yeah it's like a sixty page book and in in it it's get like a bite about reference and stuff
S0237	oh okay i'll read that
S0192	and like i think provide that you're erm you follow the same reference pattern throughout all your work i think it'd be okay
S0237	yeah they don't really mind
S0192	yeah
S0237	they say use to say that in they'd be like as long as you're consistent then you're fine like
S0192	yeah
S0237	it doesn't really matter if you get it a bite wrong
S0192	cos i've see them reference here in a variety of ways so
S0237	yeah
S0192	i i'm just i'm do harvard standard
S0237	i haven't use harvard before
S0192	no
S0237	i use to use what's the other one
S0192	oh god i have look at it briefly but
S0237	the other one where you do opposite i use to use that
S0192	yeah
S0237	and stuff and like ibid and like erm er really confuse
S0192	what's that ibid
S0237	yeah like
S0192	what do that mean
S0237	you don't write the you like footnote and you write the book and then if you use a a quote from that book again you write ibid it's just really confuse and weird and
S0192	right that sound a bite strange
S0237	i'm glad that we're that we don't use that
S0192	don't use that one do you have to then at that be like standard
S0237	yeah that be their like their thing
S0192	funny how they make a convention don't they why don't we just have one way of reference
S0237	i think you could i think you could use harvard i know
S0192	what's the point in have a variety of ways
S0237	who be like er be like i don't like this way so i'm gonna invent another way
S0192	yeah who care
S0192	you know what i mean erm yeah they should just have a standard shouldn't they everyone should just have a vote which one's best that one right let's all do that one then
S0237	
S0192	i believe so yeah do you know where the study room actually be
S0237	mm train room
S0192	train room i'm sure
S0237	what be we do be he just gonna show us how to do stuff
S0192	probably we're gonna have to go and get some book out and do something bollocks that i've already do probably
S0237	mm
S0192	so
S0237	i hate it when they're like when er what's her name be like go and get a book out the library

S0192	yeah
S0237	as well but erm
S0192	so do we
S0237	be like i don't
S0192	to tell you honestly we have a pretty strict budget like
S0237	oh of course
S0192	we have x amount of money to last us the year
S0237	yeah
S0192	and if it run out we're gonna get screw so we'd already spend our money for the day and it be kinda like i can't really afford to stay out you know what i mean
S0237	that's really good that you've do that though
S0192	we kinda have to like we save up x amount of money to come here and if we end up spend too much then
S0192	then what i can't finish my degree or something so
S0192	kinda have to don't you at that point
S0237	be you pay it in instalments your
S0192	no it's go the money's go yeah
S0237	oh really well that's good though that's a worry off your mind
S0192	i pay we pay it a few months before we come so yeah so we pay the rent in advance we pay that in advance
S0237	wow
S0192	and we've just get enough money for you know we've get enough money for food and a couple of drink out a week
S0237	yeah
S0192	but not a lot like we could come to the bar maybe once a week and like do it's a bite lame but and i normally be like a tuck a bottle of whisky under the coat and go to the bar
S0192	and kind of get a cup and like pour it
S0237	that's really good
S0192	those kind of trampy people
S0237	yeah
S0192	kind of have to be though to afford all the travel that we've do we've have to we've basically live on a budget for years now
S0237	yeah you get use to it don't you
S0192	it's quite sad but i have an excel spreadsheet that go back for about four years
S0237	everything you spend
S0192	every day i've put in my budget
S0237	that's amaze
S0192	but it help because although i say on that day we couldn't afford it erm some weeks we've not spend as much
S0237	yeah so you can
S0192	so then i know that we've get money to spend
S0237	and you can yeah
S0192	cos i've get an eye on what what we have spend and what we haven't spend so
S0237	do you either of you drive
S0192	no neither of us can drive
S0237	oh okay then that's really
S0192	yeah no
S0237	you just well i guess you both skip out the country pretty soon
S0192	yeah i mean we leave immediately after we graduate and then we consider i consider pass my test in korea
S0192	erm it's a lot cheaper and a lot easier
S0237	mm
S0192	have our original intention recently when we go back we want to get a uni job for two years
S0237	yeah
S0192	when we return and we get one but our friends who be really good friends before we be live with them in tennessee at the time they say fuck it we'll come back with you and we couldn't find us all a uni job
S0237	oh
S0192	so we all go back through the system we be in before the public school but we say look if we do this then we have to get a uni job the next year which we do so when we get that uni job we kind of think well a year's not really long enough at uni kinda so we're potentially gonna do a couple of years but then there be a lot of there be a lot of hoo ha with maybe people be gonna get fire or lay off so
S0237	oh gosh
S0192	so as a backup plan we apply here and then we get in and once we start think about the actuality of do it
S0237	you be like yeah
S0192	we get excite about it and be like screw it then let's go
S0237	oh yes i dunno i only decide to do it like a few months before

S0237	i be kind of like if i'd have know the timetable i probably would've take like syntactic theory
S0192	yeah yeah
S0237	instead of forensic linguistics cos it would've like save me two days of come in
S0192	yeah
S0237	so but it's okay it's cos they have seminars on different days to lecture
S0192	yeah
S0237	which be good cos you get time to do the work but
S0192	to think about it and do that kind of stuff
S0237	and to yeah
S0192	but yeah i be erm i i look at it i really have a good think about it and i be like you know what i'm here to do the work i'm here to be in i be like i could do two days with these modules or i'm more interest in these modules but it be four days instead of two days so i'm in today from eleven till six
S0237	mm
S0192	tomorrow from nine till twelve

S0192	bloody hell five days though that's terrible
S0237	mm
S0192	maybe next semester make sure you go for the er
S0192	we haven't choose our ones for next semester
S0237	no i be i be think that
S0192	yeah
S0237	i'm really confuse
S0192	cos all my undergraduates in my class they've plan out they know what they're do semester
S0237	no i'm pretty sure there's like a there's a couple of modules that i want to do which haven't come up so i presume they're next semester
S0192	yeah
S0237	like language and mind or something
S0192	yeah and well they change them as well don't they
S0237	mm
S0192	they've definitely i think they've get it in the new module handbook they've definitely get phrenology definitely get first language acquisition
S0237	phrenology would
S0192	i wouldn't mind do that but i reckon it'll be quite difficult
S0237	mm
S0192	cos it's go pretty deep phrenology so but i'd quite like to do that i'd like to do world englishes that'd be quite interest erm
S0237	that'd be really good
S0192	no i guess we don't choose them yet but i'm tempt next semester to go for an easier schedule especially cos this semester and i have get our best friends visit
S0237	yeah you
S0192	and they're live with us for three weeks
S0192	and it's right bang in the middle of the course
S0237	and it's like both of you have get so much to do
S0192	yeah so we're a little bite worry erm and i've get four assessments in the three weeks that they're there so i'm like oh god but they're chill and we're good friends with them
S0237	yeah
S0192	so then they they should just kind of get on a little bite
S0237	entertain themselves
S0192	we're go to amsterdam with them for a few days
S0237	be you
S0192	because cos it's read week when they arrive as you know so

S0192	but i'm pretty sure from the people we meet that they
S0192	it be limit to certain place and like you could it be basically between the capital cities you could go from you know this capital to that capital
S0237	yeah
S0192	to that capital
S0192	and anything else in between you have to pay for and and i don't really travel like that so it's

S0192	take a twenty five hour boat journey up to er the north of greece

S0192	okay
S0237	for which be completely not relate to this
S0192	mm
S0237	but you know never mind i wanna do this so this be fine
S0237	erm but then i also wanna and teach in like dubai and stuff and
S0192	oh that's cool
S0237	thailand and maybe like china erm
S0192	thailand's easy you'll get a job there no worry
S0237	yeah
S0192	middle east you'll probably need a little bite of experience first yeah
S0237	really okay so thailand would be better to go to first
S0192	you could get a job in korea no worry if it interest you in any way
S0237	yeah
S0192	you just need to get a little tefl certificate
S0237	yeah i know i be gonna do that after i finish this
S0192	yeah
S0237	i want to do it i go to career and i be like do you reckon i could do a tefl thing alongside my master and they be like we wouldn't recommend it a lot of work
S0192	yeah
S0237	and i be like okay i won't then cos i also have a job and stuff
S0192	although they're so easy
S0192	like the basic tefl certificate be almost not worth the paper they're write on
S0237	what do you need though cos there's about a million different course
S0192	yeah i would personally i mean i've get three certificate
S0237	oh wow
S0192	i have a celta which be from cambridge university i then have a basic so that be like a five week observe every day eight hours a day course
S0237	oh that's good yeah
S0192	but the first one i do be a twenty hour weekend course
S0237	yeah
S0192	as like an introductory tefl course i then like that so i take a distance course and that be a hundred hours and that be basically read this book and take two exams and do it all distance
S0237	oh that's good yeah
S0192	that certificate be enough for me to get a pay rise when i go out to korea at the time when i go out to korea you didn't need any tefl stuff cos now you do
S0237	oh really
S0192	you have to have that basic one
S0237	yeah
S0192	you need to have a hundred hour certificate i would personally say if you can afford it and you have the time skip all the crappy tefl certificate go straight for a celta
S0237	and just do a big one yeah
S0192	erm it's a well recognise and quite difficult certificate erm it's gonna cost about a thousand to fifteen hundred pound though
S0237	really
S0192	yeah and it take four to five weeks and i do ours on the beach in ecuador
S0237	that's amaze
S0192	it be amaze so like all of our students be like surfer stoner ecuadorian people that be like
S0237	that's so funny
S0192	make surfboard and stuff so really cool
S0237	no i feel like yeah so well i do er cos i know it's gonna cost like do a tefl's gonna cost a bite er i will when i finish this i will just work in the shop for a little while
S0192	mm
S0237	see how far i can get up cos i've only be there for three months and i've be promote twice
S0192	yeah that's amaze
S0237	so i'm think
S0192	they obviously like you the face of
S0192	or i don't remember which one you say

S0192	yeah as a gesture of good will
S0237	i think basically i don't each much food so that kind of just cover my food
S0192	no you're quite small aren't you so
S0237	erm erm so i pay fifty quid a month as a gesture to my mum and then i don't really have any other outgo to be honest
S0192	no
S0237	so that's it
S0192	so everything you earn be for you to drink
S0237	be well i owe
S0237	i owe my dad a bite of money not for this but for like for other stuff
S0192	yeah
S0237	erm but yeah erm
S0192	nice of him to give you a couple of grand though
S0237	i know
S0192	yeah
S0237	especially when i owe him
S0192	and your grandad as well do you say
S0237	yeah but i have to pay my grandad back i don't have to pay my dad back
S0192	oh okay so it's a loan but it's a loan without interest
S0237	mm
S0192	from the bank
S0237	exactly
S0192	and that kind of thing yeah
S0237	i be gonna get a bank loan that's what i be gonna do cos barclays do like a nobody do any fund but barclays do like a postgrad loan
S0192	mm
S0237	where you can it's like ten grand and then you get a year like interest free and then you have to start pay interest on it
S0192	and you know the interest's quite a bite higher
S0237	and exactly and i be talk to my dad about it and he be like let's be honest in the grand scheme of life six grand isn't that much money
S0192	no
S0237	he be like it's not worth get a bank loan and get in load of debt for it so
S0192	no do you have student loan
S0237	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0237	erm
S0192	how much do you have out of interest
S0237	erm i think i owe
S0192	cos you be with the top up fee be you not
S0237	no i wasn't i just i get in the year before
S0192	so you be no
S0237	i only pay three grand
S0192	yeah that's what i would call top up fee
S0237	oh sorry yeah no
S0192	cos when i go it be twelve hundred a year
S0237	really
S0192	yeah and then the year after i go they they bring what they call top up fee
S0237	oh i see
S0192	and that go to three grand
S0237	oh the year after me it go to nine grand
S0192	and then it go to nine
S0237	yeah
S0192	it's crazy
S0237	i know
S0192	and my brother's just sign up so what do you have like twenty grand in debt or something like that yeah
S0237	yeah like twenty five
S0192	twenty five i've get fifteen i haven't pay a penny off since i've be
S0237	really
S0192	i mean we've have to pay them but they have
S0237	when you're work abroad do you have to pay
S0192	yeah you do it's a bite of a pain in the arse cos it's not automatic so you have to contact them all the time and every month i have to sign in and pay and all this stupid stuff but they have you know they have like a threshold
S0237	mm
S0192	and if you earn over this then you start pay
S0237	yeah yeah
S0192	that threshold change depend on the country you're in
S0237	oh okay
S0192	so in england i think it's like eighteen grand or something like that yeah
S0237	yeah eighteen
S0192	but in korea it be like twelve grand
S0192	and we be on about fourteen grand i wasn't on that much money so
S0237	so if you be earn that in england you wouldn't've have to pay it
S0192	no yeah so in korea we didn't have to pay much though i be only pay about thirty pound a month or something
S0237	yeah
S0192	it be basically just cover the interest so i've be pay off the interest and it's still exactly what it be six years ago
S0237	but after twenty five years they just write it off
S0192	yours mine they don't
S0237	oh really
S0192	mine get write off when i'm sixty five
S0237	okay
S0192	so for me that's forty five years so you get although you have to borrow more you'll probably not end up i'll probably end up pay more than you do
S0237	yeah
S0192	so that's crap so this to pay for this course and i save every single penny for the last two years possible
S0237	that's amaze
S0192	to pay for this it be difficult though because on the one hand when we be like just about to pay our tuition fee we be like i could do an ma for a year
S0237	yeah
S0192	or i could travel africa for an entire year
S0237	i literally i be like
S0237	not like i er travel but i be like i could do a master or i could have like six grand to save for like a house deposit
S0192	yeah
S0237	i be like mm
S0192	be that what you want then
S0237	i want to like but i be like cos i just think how be i ever gonna get on the property ladder
S0192	oh and i never will
S0237	i just don't think
S0192	not gonna happen

S0237	only like we be together for like a year but then before that we do all that like oh no string
S0192	okay yeah
S0237	and it be really complicate
S0237	yeah exactly
S0192	yeah
S0237	erm so we be kind of together then but it be yeah he be like oh yeah no i don't want a relationship but then he'd we'd like go out for dinner and then we like go to er you know we'd like go to and like shop and stuff and he'd like buy me present and that

S0237	yeah
S0192	and i really like her and my parent divorce and she basically didn't want the baggage so she like dump me and end up go with one of my best friends at the time
S0237	oh god
S0192	and i be pretty heartbroken at the time
S0237	yeah that's grim
S0192	and i get to uni and be just very blunt and honest and say i don't wanna be in a relationship you know what i mean so and i be kind of well i meet her she be the first person i meet at university literally the first person
S0237	really
S0192	we be in the same halls er we be in the same room in the same flat
S0237	ah wow
S0192	erm we didn't do anything for the first six months then we kind of get together but kinda have an on and off relationship for er maybe two years like kind of we be together i never do anything else with anyone else once we i kind of
S0237	yeah
S0192	i didn't i be loyal but i'd always be say to her that you know
S0237	you didn't wanna yeah
S0192	after uni i'm gonna go to japan or i'm gonna do thing so i kind of wasn't include her in the next plan
S0237	mm
S0192	if you know what i mean and i look back and think that be a bite of a twattish thing to do but i just didn't wanna be tie down at the time
S0237	yeah
S0192	but the more i travel with her the more we we get closer and closer and then it be just like okay we're clearly together so
S0237	get marry
S0192	er well i propose recently erm while we be in cambodia
S0237	oh nice oh my god
S0192	that be about three months ago
S0237	that's amaze
S0192	mm
S0237	i didn't know that
S0192	so in front of a temple
S0237	and she say yes i presume
S0192	but we may never actually get marry
S0237	really
S0192	erm because we wanna go and work in the middle east we have to be marry to even be anywhere near each other
S0237	mm
S0192	so we have for a while have about the pragmatics the practicality of get marry to the point where we're actually talk about who would come and where we'd do it and we wouldn't get a marriage we'd just sign a piece of it wouldn't be a wed just a marriage we'd just sign a piece of paper
S0237	yeah you'd just
S0192	and i be sit there think that's not very romantic be it if she we just go and sign a piece of paper so i think i should propose to her but she's only get it's a wooden ring it's not a metal ring or anything
S0237	be she expect it
S0192	no she wasn't i think she might be but she be very surprise so
S0192	in our eye when i propose and say will you marry me and she say yes
S0237	yeah
S0192	we be marry
S0192	and the rest be just a you know a formality
S0237	yeah
S0192	kind of thing do you wanna go and get a coffee or something
S0237	what time be it
S0192	erm let's have a look
S0237	what time's our thingy
S0192	oh fifty five so we've get five more minutes and then we've do an hour
S0237	how long do we need to
S0192	and it's three twenty five so
S0237	oh awesome
S0192	we have thirty five minutes until class
S0192	can you do five more minutes
S0237	yeah it's fine erm
S0192	again thank you very very much
S0237	that's okay so you're so you're not interest in like the wed
S0192	erm i guess a part of us think
S0237	bet your mum would want that
S0192	oh yeah she push for it quite a bite same as children but erm
S0192	a part of us think you know down the line it would be nice to have a big party with our friends that kind of stuff
S0237	yeah
S0192	but there's no way we can afford it for years erm
S0237	mm they're so expensive
S0192	so yeah
S0237	if you do it abroad it won't be too bad
S0192	well won't get anyone to come will i
S0237	mm
S0192	all my family and then i think about the practicalities i mean i haven't see my mum or my dad in the same room for ten years so think about try to get them together and
S0237	mm
S0192	my dad would beat the crap out of her husband i'm pretty sure so
S0237	oh be it still a bite like
S0192	i mean you know i don't think he would but he certainly doesn't talk to him
S0237	be you dad with anyone else
S0192	yeah yeah he be but she's erm she's be die for like the last few years which a bite tragic
S0192	she go blind recently last year completely blind
S0237	that be awful
S0192	she's get the the tumour have spread to her brain but er she's now the best i've see her in the last few years so this be the second time it's come back though and they've get rid of it this time so i don't think she's get too many years leave in her unfortunately
S0192	and she be the old best friend of my mother
S0237	oh
S0192	yeah it's all very complex my dad grow up in a children's home
S0192	his his mother commit suicide to get away from his dad and his dad put him in a children's home actually 's dad have a similar back story which be quite interest
S0237	really
S0192	and then my mum work at the children's home and so do her best friend and that's so my dad be with his mum and then a couple of years after they break up he get back in contact with her friend and now they're together so it's all be very and my mother's now back with her childhood sweetheart that she be with from sixteen so
S0237	oh so your mum and dad aren't on good term or
S0192	not really no erm they can talk to each other through me but they don't talk to each other directly about anything so
S0237	yeah oh dear
S0192	and that's ten years later so it's a bite rubbish isn't it
S0237	make you think doesn't it
S0192	just every time i come home there's some crap you know what i mean
S0237	yeah
S0237	have you get brothers and sisters
S0192	erm i have originally i have one brother my you know blood brother but more recently i now have two step sisters and two step brothers
S0237	yeah oh wow
S0192	and i have a half brother who's five
S0237	oh my gosh do you really
S0192	so my mum my mum have a child at forty seven so he's call
S0237	wow
S0192	so i just saw him at the weekend so he's a little five year old boy
S0237	be he really cute
S0192	yeah i mean he er i find children a little bite annoy so he's
S0192	he's a bite of both i can handle him for a couple of hours but like after
S0237	he's your brother
S0192	i'm good with children i be but
S0237	yeah well you you're a teacher so i'd hope so
S0192	yeah but it's a bite of an act like inside i'm actually go where's the adult conversation here you know what i mean
S0237	mm
S0237	why can't you speak
S0192	i know yeah talk to me but i do some interest linguistic test on him at the weekend
S0237	oh good
S0192	i'd read that five year olds can't understand passive constructions
S0237	mm
S0192	so like the sentence the zebra be kiss by the monkey i ask him who kiss who then i say the zebra be kiss by the monkey and he say the zebra kiss the monkey
S0237	oh
S0192	they can't understand because the
S0237	they don't get the thing
S0192	syntactically the structure be say the zebra kiss the monkey the zebra be kiss by the monkey
S0237	that's really interest i'm quite interest in erm my dissertation be on like peter pan and erm this thing call text world theory so if you like when you read a text the kind of constructions that your mind make
S0192	yeah okay
S0237	sort of like connotations and stuff

S0192	that kind of stuff yeah my dad have to do that as well
S0237	but erm yeah no they're fine
S0192	but do they divorce just because you know they'd come to the end of their tether or be someone cheat on someone or
S0237	i don't really know i think so i reckon my dad might i think my step mum might've be on the scene a little beforehand
S0192	ah okay
S0237	but i don't know the detail i've never really ask i'd never be like
S0192	there's no way of tell because i mean my my family give me the impression it be my dad that be cheat cos like

S0192	so yeah he be erm she kick him out of the room and like all of this kind of stuff and like
S0192	for ground for divorce she have to basically convince my family that my dad be an alcoholic when he wasn't at all so my dad have no contact with the rest of my family now which be kind of sad
S0237	yeah
S0192	so
S0237	oh dear

S0237	oh my god
S0192	it's quite bad statistics
S0237	sometimes when you think you have problems and you hear about stuff like that and then i'm like i don't really have i don't really have any problems
