S0432	my erm friend be have a party tonight
S0432	for her twenty first and i just yeah i i say to her i'd go for an hour
S0428	yeah you can just pop in it's not too far be it
S0432	but i don't know cos everybody's gonna look really dress up cos it's a black and white party and she's gonna go in colour so i i have a feel that everybody's gonna be in like really smart like all the lads'll be in like smart black suit trousers won't they and a white shirt i just don't know if i can be bother to get dress up that much just for an hour
S0428	yeah probably not
S0432	i feel really bad but i'll see i might just see how i get on with pack for holiday cos i don't even know exactly what time i'll finish here
S0428	yeah like
S0432	and then i've gotta get home pack we've get to make sure the house be tidy cos we're have a inspection when we're away
S0428	really
S0432	yeah bite weird i'm a bite worry though cos i don't cos i think we'd have to be there at the bite worry like let them into my house it's not my house but do you know what i mean
S0428	it's not very i dunno it feel a bite
S0432	no i'm a bite especially like
S0432	cos we're away as well we're not just at work or something we're away so
S0428	be you definitely gonna stay there now
S0432	erm i we be for now we might do another year there but we don't wanna rent it's a bite it's kind of like dead money isn't it but we don't know where we want to live yet so we might as well rent until we know what
S0428	yeah do you have like different ideas of where you wanna buy or
S0432	erm kind of i think want to go abroad
S0432	i be like cos the i don't i think when it we actually come to like seriously talk about it he won't want to cos we've both do it we've both live abroad for a while i know i only do like a year abroad but
S0428	yeah no it's still
S0432	yeah and he's live in new zealand
S0428	where do he have he get anywhere like in mind or
S0432	what abroad or
S0428	yeah
S0432	originally before i get the job here we we be look into gibraltar
S0428	oh i remember you say yeah
S0432	yeah cos i want somewhere where i could speak spanish and he want somewhere where he could speak english so we be just like just go to spain cos but then he look into gibraltar and cos he want to learn spanish as well and he just think that's kind of but i think it's quite expensive
S0428	mm
S0432	to live there
S0428	i think it's might be a bite claustrophobic as well
S0432	yeah cos it's apparently it's like the population's like south of or something
S0432	i be like i'm not sure i could manage that
S0428	and i think like you're kinda cut off cos it's you have to like go through quite strict control like backwards and forward and stuff so
S0432	yeah to get out anywhere unless you just go by boat to
S0428	yeah
S0432	spain the south of spain
S0428	and then you'd be like i just wanna live in spain
S0432	yeah yeah cos some people kind of live in spain and then work in gibraltar or something didn't they
S0428	yeah
S0432	there be like a programme on like britain in the sun or something
S0428	mm
S0432	and they be say they live in south of spain cos it's cheaper but work in gibraltar but just get across be just manic
S0428	i think you can be stick for hours
S0432	yeah i wouldn't wanna wouldn't wanna go there so yeah we scrap that idea
S0432	i don't know if we will
S0428	but would you stay round this area
S0432	yeah yeah think so
S0428	can his job like could he work abroad with his job yeah
S0432	i think so yeah
S0428	that's really cool
S0432	yeah and i mean not with this job but probably could go into like teach or something dunno
S0428	yeah
S0432	i dunno what it depend where we go and like i'd have to do a qualification first yeah cos if we my sister go to australia in the begin of this year and she be like you have to go and live out there because they there's so many chinese people and they want there's advert for chinese teachers everywhere so you have to go and i be like i don't know if i'd wanna
S0428	it's so far like
S0432	and it's and it's expensive as well like i know it's
S0428	yeah
S0432	it's all relative so you'd probably get pay a better wage but it be it be really far
S0428	i think the boom's like come and go there my cos my when my family move out erm there it be really cheap like they buy house for nothing and now they're like they've go massively up but the food be so expensive like
S0432	mm
S0428	like they can't afford anything now
S0432	yeah
S0428	although they do have like swim pool in their garden and stuff like i don't feel that sorry for you
S0432	yeah
S0432	but it's totally different in new zealand isn't it because they all live in like tin house don't they
S0428	do they
S0432	like some of them be like still in like corrugate like tin i remember when we i skyped my my cousins who live out there they're not live in one now but be a a few years ago they be
S0428	before
S0432	and i be like be that your house and they be like yeah why i be like nothing
S0432	just look like a portacabin or something but no yeah now they live in in a nice area but yeah i be just like what it's really
S0428	yeah that's crazy
S0432	doesn't just didn't seem very develop for this
S0428	yeah i'd love to go there
S0432	yeah i'd love to i i do want to visit
S0428	yeah
S0432	but then we be say like we be we be sit in in our lounge last night or the night before we be it's cos it's quite an old house we be like and we be watch a a documentary
S0432	erm just post war and we be like can you imagine people like sit in here like listen on the radio like all gather around and then he be like see like new zealand doesn't have anything like that it's
S0432	it doesn't really have any history cos it's only like a hundred years old or so isn't it
S0428	yeah that's the same as erm you know as as erm in spain
S0432	in spain
S0428	no not in spain sorry
S0432	oh
S0428	in australia
