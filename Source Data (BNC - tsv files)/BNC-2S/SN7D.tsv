S0076	when when we get our i mean this be years ago when we move into a house that my mum live in she buy it in winter so we have no idea really what it be like on the road and i think it come to life when the sun's out
S0010	yeah
S0076	that's well good
S0010	yeah
S0076	ooh
S0010	yeah so so we'll just have to wait and see what happen

S0010	i know so
S0076	i'm nervous now

S0076	i'm really excite
S0010	then we have to then we have to move house which be always a trauma but i just i just hate move house
S0076	yeah
S0010	so em last it be okay last time we em last time we move we do over a week
S0076	eh huh
S0010	eh just hire a van for a week and
S0076	yeah
S0010	kinda do it we be work at the same time eh both of us and it be just a nightmare
S0076	yeah
S0010	em i by the friday i be just i mean the i be so tire cos em i hadn't go to bed any night before midnight and between when we finish work and em to go to bed
S0076	yeah
S0010	we do nothing but pack and move pack and move and pack and move and we be move from kinda em south
S0076	eh huh
S0010	to em over to where we be now
S0076	oh right
S0010	so it's a good old drive to the
S0076	yeah
S0010	between stop as well
S0076	yeah
S0010	it be just yeah it's just not pleasant
S0076	yeah
S0010	em but em a time before that we try to do two days rather than a week
S0076	oh my gosh
S0010	and it be just it be unbelievable
S0076	oh
S0010	so eh so yeah so we're do it over a a a longer period eh this time
S0076	yeah
S0010	at least a week but we'll see
S0076	eh so when if you find out today that you get it when will you be able to move in if they do
S0010	i don't actually know
S0076	oh okay
S0010	cos i mean in theory it will be pretty quick cos we've already get the mortgage in principle sort em so em it will need to be alter slightly cos it's not for the right amount at the moment
S0076	yeah
S0010	but that's not a problem eh we need to get money sort em cos mum's help us with the deposit so we need to get that transfer and
S0076	mm hm
S0010	and em but we've get to get a survey do em but in theory it's pretty i think it should be pretty quick
S0076	hmm
S0010	i reckon probably a month six weeks
S0010	it could be complete
S0076	oh my
S0010	so eh
S0076	that be so good
S0010	yeah
S0076	do you like pack your box
S0010	oh tell me about it
S0010	we still haven't unpack some of them from the other time so we the one we rent be a lovely lovely house but it's just that little bite too small
S0076	yeah
S0010	and we kind of know that when we move in but em we want to cos it's next door to some friend's em and it it's a lovely house and i love it and it's be really nice
S0076	yeah
S0010	em but they're kinda move they're only move around the corner and we're not exactly move far
S0076	yeah
S0010	and it will be a shame cos em they've get two kid em and
S0076	aw
S0010	and em so we've be quite em we we i mean we've not be round every day or anything but we've be quite involve in it be
S0076	watch them grow up
S0010	it's a bite of a shame yeah yeah so it will be a shame to not be not be next just next door
S0076	yeah
S0010	em but em
S0076	just invite them round
S0010	yeah like i say it's what two two stop on the tram it's nothing really
S0076	yeah that's not far at all be it
S0010	so em and i mean the mortgage be probably go to be less well it be go to be less than our rent
S0076	eh huh
S0010	so we be gonna end up with probably about a hundred pound a month extra
S0076	right
S0010	and eh if we've get that we can afford a car
S0076	yeah
S0010	so em we'll just have to wait and see
S0076	oh it's still here
S0010	so
S0076	yeah definitely
S0010	yeah
S0076	that's so excite
S0010	yeah it's yeah it's very strange though
S0076	yeah it be
S0010	yeah
S0076	quite a lot of my friends be all move into house at the moment cos i've only just graduate they graduate a few years ago they're kind of a few years ahead of me and the think of it scar me
S0010	it doesn't not scare me
S0010	i tell yeah

S0076	i bet a few years ago on on my course we em we actually film in and it be so the most freeze cold day of our life and we be there from like eight in the morning till six at night
S0010	yeah
S0076	it be freeze i have and they have like we say we've get to go to we're not go to any other park it be nice
S0010	yeah
S0076	it's right near the tram stop
S0010	yeah yeah yeah
S0076	it be good
S0010	yeah nice it's eh it be i'd i mean we be kinda look more round where we be now which be which be a couple of stop up eh but em they just they just weren't as good for the money

S0076	yeah exactly
S0076	it be lovely round there
S0010	so
S0076	it be oh wow i love it
S0010	yeah
S0010	i just i just can't stop grin i can't concentrate until until i get this phone call
S0076	yes
S0010	i'm find it really tough to actually do
S0076	yeah
S0010	some work so it's be quite nice to have eh to have this as a like
S0076	oh that's so good ah you'll have to i don't know the the think of pack box i don't like but the think of empty box and move into place i like that part of it i just don't like the pack up
S0010	yeah it's
S0076	it's hard
S0010	yeah i mean it's em well i'll just have to buy we we've get so many book and that's the problem
S0076	oh right
S0010	cos em cos work in
S0076	wow brilliant
S0010	so it's we've get a silly silly amount of book
S0076	yeah
S0010	and so we're gonna i just have to buy so many shelve
S0076	yeah right
S0010	which be not a problem but again it's it's kind of all money on top of it
S0076	yeah yeah
S0010	so eh although if em if if if the house go if he accept a hundred and five em then we can probably we can do a hundred and ten
S0076	hmm
S0010	so it might keep the money from the mortgage to be able to kinda do it up
S0076	yeah
S0010	and and and not do it up but buy things for the house furniture and so on
S0076	oh that's the excite part ain't it make it look like it's yours
S0010	yeah exactly yeah
S0076	that's so good
S0010	exactly cos i mean when we move into this one it be unfurnished so we buy things like a sofa and bits and piece so we've get like furniture
S0076	yeah
S0010	em but it's things to to improve it like shelve and that kind of thing that we've not get that we need
S0076	ooh

S0076	ah okay
S0010	so hopefully he won't want to bother take carpet and stuff cos it'll
S0076	yeah
S0010	well they'll just end up with carpet hang around
S0076	yeah so em
S0010	ooh excuse me ooh

S0076	yeah it's hard at the moment
S0010	yeah
S0076	and all that stuff's sort
S0010	it's which be such a shame because em the payments themselves be fine
S0076	yeah
S0010	i mean they're not it's less than rent it's it's fine it's just that the eh that scrap the deposit together be
S0076	that's it
S0010	so so tough
S0076	yeah it be hard
S0010	yeah
S0076	my sister live in malta and she's move into a different apartment soon hopefully with her boyfriend and that's what she say she be like once we get in there the rent's actually quite cheap
S0010	yeah
S0076	but just get that deposit together be a nightmare they're really struggle
S0010	yeah
S0076	both get full time job and they still can't manage it
S0010	yeah
S0076	it's weird
S0010	yeah have em one of my old boss em before i work at the university eh she be canadian
S0076	mm hm
S0010	and em she buy a house for twenty grand
S0076	yeah
S0010	equivalent in english money which be just about and it's it's bigger than the one we've buy now
S0076	yeah
S0010	for which be like ten time well not ten time that
S0076	oh no
S0010	but eh but you for for a lot more and em it's just crazy the the difference
S0076	yeah
S0010	and she be say that she love work over here because em when she take the money back over it basically double its value
S0076	wow
S0010	em so em you can't argue with that
S0076	yeah definitely
S0010	so eh
S0076	that's incredible my friend live in australia and she say similar stuff about that really the price for like if you're buy foods and things be about the same

S0076	mm hm
S0010	there's no reason to
S0076	mm hm
S0010	there's no yeah i've get i mean i've get friends and stuff here that's not say we couldn't find them over there but
S0076	definitely
S0010	it's a bite eh
S0076	it's a big step
S0010	it be
S0076	it's a massive step
S0010	it be it be and there's issue with visa and all sort over there so
S0076	yeah of course there be yeah yeah oh i'd love to go out even if it be just for eh like a few months a few of my friends have do it for a few months
S0010	yeah
S0076	and they've all want to end up go back there but
S0010	yeah well
S0010	she eh that's where she's go
S0076	oh nice
S0010	so she travel the world for five or so months and then
S0076	oh yeah
S0010	and now be eh live and work in australia

S0076	yeah
S0010	em but em like from i can't imagine she'll come back to be honest
S0076	no majority of people don't want to
S0010	no
S0076	why would you when you've get the sunshine and the sea
S0010	yeah exactly yeah so
S0076	it's such a good lifestyle out there it's lovely
S0010	it be definitely so cos i i mean live in a foreign country be not something that's ever ever appeal to me much
S0076	mm hm

S0076	yeah
S0010	em i've always have kinda have that opportunity

S0010	exactly yeah i mean
S0076	yeah
S0010	in september i might actually have a member of the family in the same country as me
