S0023	yeah it's record now
S0022	yeah it be okay so tell me what you're most look forward to about erm go away next week
S0023	ah well it's come round amazingly quickly but it's my birthday and so i'm look forward to be you know treat like a king really er even more than normal so erm we're go to the cos of the erm in the main place we're go to i'm look forward to all the industrial heritage and see that museum
S0022	that sound amaze doesn't it
S0023	where they all dress up yeah
S0022	yeah
S0023	yeah it should be it should be i want to use old money and actually be able to pay for something with it cos i be bear in nineteen seventy which be the year they stop use it but there's i've always have some hang about the house
S0022	but i think use victorian coin
S0023	no they well one or two carry over the florin carry over the ten p the big fat old go on
S0022	i think i think at the museum they use victorian coin
S0023	oh well that's alright what i mean be it's real money it's brass it's not just plat copper it's worth something or plat nickel or whatever it be so erm that will be fun and you'll be able to buy penny chew for a penny well maybe more than one that will be nice
S0022	that will be good i think erm you know that write assignment the one about write about a place
S0023	yes yes
S0022	i think i'm go to use that and write about it
S0023	that's a good idea maybe we'll both be inspire
S0022	yeah
S0023	but it's it's famous for be you know in the heartland of industrial revolution and er it all be grassy and sort of pleasant that it look now it be a furnace of creativity at the time and it's what make the country what it be so i'm really interest to see
S0022	really yeah i think it will be very interest
S0023	oh that remind me don't let me forget that next this year be the anniversary of that steam engine down the road two hundred years
S0022	yes
S0023	it's a good reason to try and submit an article
S0022	you should yeah you should definitely you should get a wiltshire magazine
S0023	yeah that would go well in there you're right
S0022	it be in wasn't it
S0023	yeah yeah
S0022	oh right okay here's a question for you erm what amendments these these card must have be make in america so the question be what amendments should be make to the us constitution
S0023	hmm well nice er hmm the main one that i know of and think about be the need to explicitly mention the right to property so they've get if you remember the the what's in the declaration of independence
S0022	i know very very little about it i'm ashamed to say
S0023	something about inalienable right to er life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
S0022	mm mm
S0023	along those line anyway so right to life no one really argue about that liberty mean can't lock you up unless there's good reason to er pursuit of happiness i think it should even if it doesn't say it say the pursuit of your own happiness as oppose to make everyone else happy
S0022	mm mm mm mm
S0023	which otherwise you'd just be back into slavery but yeah the bite they're miss there be property because erm america despite be a very individualist capitalist country over the years er and particularly right now with obamacare have decide it's go to not let you be free they're go to tell you what to do and take your property away well all the time though in america unlike this country whenever anything come up they often refer to the constitution and say that's unconstitutional and and you know an individual can bring a court case that will go all the way to the supreme court if they can make a case for the fact that it be to do with the constitution so if you put in a line there about erm property probably something else about interstate commerce as well people justify the regulations they have now load of them they have these federal regulations like er what you can and can't do with gun and stuff base on
S0022	so be federal the whole country
S0023	yeah federal be the whole country
S0022	right
S0023	so there's there's a there's a thing in the original constitution that allow erm it say and there be mustn't be any laws between the state that restrict trade
S0022	mm mm
S0023	but they've take them that to mean the negative which mean the federal system can make laws because it's not a state
S0022	right
S0023	so they've twist the constitution in order to fit it in with socialist type ideas with which i obviously don't agree
S0022	mm no
S0023	so to be true to what the original people of the constitution say i think we should put in a thing about property and make trade erm free that's my basic answer what's yours
S0022	hmm ah well see i know so little about it erm i mean i think it's really good they do have a constitution something that we're lack
S0023	why what's the what's important about have one do you think why do you miss it
S0022	well from what i understand from you be what you've just say that you know there be there be that that a that a citizen can can kind of that you can't just make up any old law you fancy there be there be a there be a document on you know the found of the country which be base on the fact that it be a document that that that people can't do x y z but governments can't do x y z either
S0023	yep yeah
S0022	and i be think this morning for some reason i'm not quite sure why but erm you know you know the erm you know the smoke ban in this country
S0023	mm
S0022	and i've hear this too many time for it not for me not to believe it's correct that that you can smoke in the bar of the house of commons
S0023	i know it's outrageous isn't it typical
S0022	yeah i know and i hear it the first time and i think it can't be true it just can't be true
S0023	oh yeah
S0022	but then i hear it again and how could you and that be just so much like you know one rule for us and one rule for you i e one rule for the government and one rule for you
S0023	yeah well that make perfect sense look at it this way they're the politicians be the ones who make the rule up because we're not fit to run our own live so if their and the the implication and the definite position be we're not intelligent enough or wise enough or right enough to do the right thing they be so whatever they do be okay by definition because they're the ones with the with the all the cleverness and all the all the right and they have to tell us what to do what they the idea that we should be equal ooh no that's that's all out the window in the first instance so yeah they wouldn't even look at that as a contradiction
S0022	yeah no mm
S0023	they'll happily put up with it contradiction have nothing to do with it we have to be control
S0022	okay here's another one can i ask you this oh it's kind of your turn but i really like this question
S0023	oh go on then as long as long as we both as long as i get to hear your answer as well
S0022	well i just think well i know you're not go to approve of this but i think this be quite funny
S0023	uh oh what
S0022	right if you get a tattoo where would you what would you get and where would you put it so
S0023	well obviously i'd have a have a a heart with an arrow through it and it would say a for r or r for a or something like that
S0022	okay
S0023	and i'd have it somewhere so that you could see it but it wasn't too painful wasn't too large and erm i'm not quite sure
S0023	traditionally men have it on their arm
S0022	could you get a dot and that would be your tattoo
S0023	no no
S0022	a dot you could pretend it be erm a beauty spot
S0023	yeah i would want to get something that you know if i be go to or like go through all that be something that hopefully be aesthetically please and traditionally men have things about their ladies but that's not always true there's this bloke at work now and erm because he wear suit normally i didn't notice but he's be he's wear a t shirt the other friday and he's get these elaborate tattoo all up his arm with god know what they're mean to be snake or something like that but it's he must have spend hours in the tattoo parlour
S0022	yeah
S0023	and i can't think what it's for i mean why it just look odd
S0022	i think if you're if you're well i be go to say if you be young but if you have well muscle arm then they sort of i suppose they sort of showcase them
S0023	mm
S0022	but you'd have to keep your arm well muscle
S0023	oh be it like if you have picture of snake and then you sort of stretch your biceps then it make the snake move that's a bite
S0022	well i think there be you can get tattoo that be very very clever and i think they like i've hear of someone have a panther on their leg and when they when they run it look like the panther's run
S0023	oh okay
S0022	which be it's kind of clever but the trouble be that if you're very hone and tone you've get to stay like that otherwise it's go to look horrible isn't it
S0023	cos it the panther would get a bite fat won't it
S0022	but i be think if i have to have one erm i would you could you could either go for the well okay i've get to get one so i'll have to that say it as erm er what's the word
S0023	obtrusive
S0022	yeah unobtrusive as possible but then i think well in a way you could have a like a sort of erm a maxim for life
S0023	oh there you go like a motto oh that's good
S0022	like yeah like something carpa diem but a bite more than that
S0023	oh okay
S0022	and and then i think well you'd have to have it then so you could see it all the time so i suppose you'd have it you could have it somewhere like your wrist for example so you could see it but then you could cover with a bracelet or a watch or something
S0023	oh okay yeah i'm not in favour of the idea in general i think it's er it's a bite of a strange thing to do
S0022	yeah i'm not
S0023	it's a marriage of slavery actually brand of course be a a mark of the skin for you know bad reason
S0022	yes but then you have erm but then you have them tribal mark don't you like you like i think they erm
S0023	mm well again i wouldn't agree with the reason for that i mean what's the reason for that to make you part of the collective
S0022	mm yeah
S0023	yeah well you may change your mind and join another tribe then what be you go to do you're a bite stick aren't you
S0022	mm
S0023	mm my turn now or be it you
S0022	yeah go on no no you ask me one
S0023	let's see what's on this list so oh this will be fun what's the most significant problem face the world and you have to answer in less than twenty four hours
S0022	hmm mm mm mm okay i be go to say well i be go to say bad philosophy
S0023	oh
S0022	because you can up with something like hunger
S0023	mm
S0022	but if you take a country like africa with the person who's listen to this i hope they're not a rave socialist but erm
S0023	they'd stop listen a long time ago
S0022	i know but erm if you take a sort of country like africa then they africa should be the richest country in the world with all its resources and i can't help and maybe it's me be very simplistic but there be there be countries that erm have be obviously what i start again there be there be unsuccessful countries and i think why aren't they look at the successful ones and kind of think well why don't we do it the way they do it
S0023	hmm mm
S0022	like for example erm and i know it sound very arrogant and it's not mean to but erm i think it be two thousand eight when there be erm oh there be some well anniversary's totally the wrong word but there be oh live aid live aid that be it
S0023	mm
S0022	and there be another big sort of charity erm drive to get money to africa
S0023	oh i remember it yeah
S0022	and there be a program about aid in africa and it be sort of say how much of a problem it be and as i be watch it i it be say you know how many people die of aid blah blah blah and i temporarily forget that the western world doesn't have a cure for aid either but we have the western world have deal with aid through behaviour largely
S0023	mm yeah i guess yeah
S0022	but africa hasn't manage to do that and i think it's down to beliefs i think it's down to the church but
S0023	yeah
S0022	so yeah i would say and that's just one example erm
S0023	well what i take that from that excuse me for interrupt
S0022	no that's fine
S0023	but be it would lead on to what i would say which be basically it's erm the biggest problem face the world be a lack of rationality people believe things that there's no rational basis for for example that er you know god will punish you if you wear a condom
S0022	yeah
S0023	or you know you could say the fiscal crisis that we're in be erm down to lack of rationality as well people have pretend that they've get money that they haven't and you could point the finger at lot of different people who be make the same mistake but er again it's erm not think properly
S0022	mm
S0023	pretend things be the case when they you know they're not
S0022	yeah
S0023	we're evade the need to try and figure out whether they be true or not so yeah a lack of rationality be the biggest problem
S0022	yeah yeah and and another another classic erm answer for that would be people say oh poverty but again there be i think the trouble be like
S0023	that's a symptom though
S0022	yeah it be and i think chuck money i mean that i'm go to bring up africa again but how much money have be chuck at africa
S0023	oh yeah
S0022	and it's about i think if you really want to help someone you've get to help them the biggest thing be help someone help themselves you can't just it's like if someone's crap with money i mean in an individual if an individual's crap with money you don't just you don't just throw a hundred pound at them because if they can't manage money they're not go to be able to manage a hundred pound the if you really want to help someone i would say you've get to teach them how to deal teach them themselves how to solve the problem
S0023	mm mm
S0022	it's like you know the maxim erm give the man a fish and you fee him for a day teach him how to fish and fee him for life
S0023	yeah
S0022	i think that's true i think it sound harsh but
S0023	so if there be a way to yeah i know what you mean though if there be a sort of way to impart er to educate people who can't help themselves then that would be a better long term solution yeah i think you be right i'd agree alright
S0022	world peace
S0023	yeah but that's how you've would achieve it people wouldn't fight each other if they didn't think they could steal things from each other or they have to do it that way
S0022	yeah okay oh here's an interest question ah okay do you want a philosophical question or do you want a sort of easier question
S0023	let's have the let's have the other one for a change because we've be very deep already
S0022	the easy one okay
S0023	yeah give us the easy one for now
S0022	what make a house a home
S0023	oh that's a good one as i as i sit here in in our beautiful home which have be largely make by your good self er well you could look at the i wouldn't say superficial but not in the sense of unimportant but you could say decoration and tidiness so that you can it's not just a big mess it's actually our home which be a lovely place to come to every even and to wake up in because it's beautifully arrange and aesthetically please and have colour scheme and object of value around the place erm so many things that make it very erm personal and pleasant place to be er so that would be you know the sort of physical things but then you could look on the more spiritual level and you could say well be a house a home be where i suppose it's where things like the artefacts come in
S0022	mm
S0023	you know the things that you put in place aren't just there for utilitarian purpose if you be say share a flat or you be in a barrack you know there's your suit there's your knife and fork there's your blanket that's it
S0022	mm
S0023	no we've choose things because they're what we value and all the things kind of
S0022	yeah so it's kind of put your own stamp on it it's a cliché but i think that's true isn't it it's it's erm
S0023	yeah yeah it's a part of us because of all the choices we've make to make it the way it be and all the mementos there be that remind of things that we've do together in our life together and so on
S0022	yeah mm yeah so what what you've be this room for example everything everything in here be be pretty much i mean apart from the sort of hard furnish if that's a word
S0023	mm
S0022	it's be choose by us and and erm yeah so there's obviously photos which be very personal but then there's picture that we've choose cos erm flower that we've choose
S0023	furniture
S0022	yeah there's furniture that we've choose and and it's they all reflect to a greater or lesser extent our taste and our what we like
S0023	it's like an extension of yourself in a way isn't it the house
S0022	yeah yeah
S0023	i suppose that's what it be when you walk in to someone's home for the first time you know you get a very strong impression base on what you see as to what kind of person they be you get huge amount of clue don't you when you see
S0022	i find it really really odd when i walk into people's house and there's no
S0023	oh stark place right yeah i know
S0022	yeah but there's like no it's no reflection of them it's just it it seem to be
S0023	like a show home you mean
S0022	i'm not sure i mean i think sometimes you can get a sort of you can get that show home effect but but more i would say erm don't need to determine be the right word but there's no sort of any any any sense of make things decorative or in some way other than totally
S0023	mm
S0022	i find it odd go to people's house when there's absolutely no attempt to sort of style or or colour or but then that's quite important to me so
S0023	mm yeah i don't know cos i don't have the knowledge or the time or or the interest to do it but yeah maybe they
S0022	but you like it though don't you
S0023	oh i love it and i wouldn't say that i be totally ignorant of the of the need for it but certainly didn't have the skills and arrangement ideas of how to arrange colour and so on like you have that's very clever on the other hand i can do diy which help doesn't it so
S0022	yes it do
S0023	we put the two together and you've get the best er best of both worlds hopefully handy andy you know
S0022	programme
S0023	no
S0022	oh
S0023	okay that's all i be go to say on that one
S0022	okay who be be it me next or you
S0023	oh i'll pick one let's have a look
S0022	you you pick one
S0023	erm oh we've do that one what do your perfect day look like
S0022	erm perfect day be oh it certainly not a day i have to get up really early or it i tell you what it might be oh yes it could be erm in a hotel wake up in a gorgeous hotel and there's a lovely day outside lovely maybe it's sort of spring so it's like sunny but it's not hot hot
S0023	mm
S0022	and then you get a lovely breakfast bring to your room and so you put on a nice fluffy robe and you go and have your breakfast and you sit there
S0023	would it would it have a balcony maybe that you could sit on outside in the sun in private
S0022	oh yes sit on yes and ah overlook the sea like saint
S0023	oh yes that's lovely
S0022	oh yes and you might get because it might be a special occasion you might get a little glass of fizz with your breakfast
S0023	oh okay it's never to early to start with that
S0022	and then you know sometimes it's a tricky one sometimes it's nice to have things plan but then sometimes i can really enjoy just not have any specific agenda and just sort of erm maybe mooch around the shop or go have a look at something and then have a nice lunch and or maybe laze by the pool or something like that
S0023	mm yeah
S0022	so it wouldn't be it wouldn't be totally devoid of do stuff but i think there's something lovely about not have a fix agenda and kind of kind of do what you feel like at the time
S0023	yeah i know what you mean
S0022	what do you think what's your perfect day
S0023	it's a good question some ways you want to say well the perfect day would be the day when you feel the happiest because you know something have happen so obviously our wed day would be my perfect day
S0022	thank you my love
S0023	but we can't repeat that i don't think that's what the question's exactly about except we might renew our vow but that's you know that's another occasion
S0022	yeah
S0023	er yes it's sort of a day you could you could have you know by design as oppose to say things that happen very rarely er yeah i think it's because of you know work so hard and be out of the house all the time there be something very charm about relax and i although i'm a man i'm prepare to admit that i like spas
S0022	yeah you know what we're i be think we're it's age since i've we've be to a spa we should go
S0023	it be rather mm well we've get relatively on our doorstop we just need to get a few quid together and go there that's lovely that's my favourite place wokingham's okay but it's not as private
S0022	no it's not quite expensive though
S0023	yeah but that's the reason why it's exclusive you see
S0022	that's true
S0023	but it's get wonderful facilities there i really like it there
S0022	it do
S0023	some of my favourite time have be go to spa you know obviously have do load of work to justify it and earn the money and then go to a spa and then with a big fat harry potter book of course there won't be any new ones of those and then just drown myself
S0022	yeah oh yeah she's write a new novel though for adults
S0023	oh good
S0022	yeah
S0023	you know and then just drown yourself in the book in a sense
S0022	okay
S0023	you know no i mean figuratively
S0022	mm okay
S0023	so you just immerse yourself be the word sorry not drown immerse yourself in the in a in a really book and then have nothing much else to do that would be nice
S0022	the trouble be with i really love the spa but i just i don't really like the food at
S0023	you don't like the food do you no you can always take a sandwich take a pack lunch
S0022	so we should erm no i don't mind the food in the erm
S0023	or the popcorn in the cinema
S0022	yeah i don't mind the food in the er spa place though
S0023	yeah
S0022	but we should there's a new place near in erm in hampshire er er call erm
S0023	oh towards the erm the new forest or in the new forest
S0022	it's at i think yeah it's always in the it's always in the paper i think it's quite expensive although mr and mrs smith as in the website mr and mrs smith they have glen erm two nights for the price of one
S0023	oh that's amaze value it's quite an expensive place be it i bet it's a limit offer certain season etcetera
S0022	probably yeah
S0023	but that might be a good opportunity to go there because it's so expensive otherwise
S0022	mm oh i could really fancy just laze about i
S0023	be there a spa there at glen
S0022	yeah
S0023	yeah okay well look we're go to have some free time soon probably so er that might be a good thing
S0022	yeah but i could fancy be it would be lovely to go somewhere and oh if we can get two nights that would be brilliant because you could in effect have three days by the spa ah how lovely would that be
S0023	i do also enjoy days when you have plan load and you get load achieve and you come home and think do we really manage to do all that
S0022	yeah
S0023	but as the mood take you at the moment yeah i would go for the more relax one but
S0022	mm
S0023	yeah there be something good about change be as good as a rest that be true as well so i could i could do that so you're go somewhere for the first time that's amaze like say rome or venice that's just mind blow that's that's an amaze thing to do
S0022	mm mm
S0023	but there be only so many cities like that that you actually go to so i'd find us more of those probably that would be another goal
S0022	mm mm yeah
S0023	it's just that they're really impressive i would really like to go to istanbul sometime be it still call that be it still call that or something else
S0022	would you yeah
S0023	yeah well just briefly but you know you can dig dig into the history of it it's get lot of roman architecture and greek architecture and all sort of things still go there it would be interest
S0022	mm yeah
S0023	anyway that's our twenty two minutes that will do for now i think yeah
S0022	be it
