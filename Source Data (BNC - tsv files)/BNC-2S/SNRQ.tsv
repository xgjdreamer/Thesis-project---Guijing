S0018	yeah
S0170	do you ever look on monster monster job
S0018	monster job i do in spain but i haven't look at it here cos you have to sift through so much

S0018	oh wow that's em
S0170	it's really hard to do to get in to do it
S0018	really
S0170	yeah and i want to find something that's not too far away i find one in wolverhampton i do apply for that that be last year but i didn't get
S0018	mm
S0170	shortlist so
S0018	so what you'd start off as an assistant speech therapist
S0170	mm hm
S0018	ah
S0170	and whilst you're do that do a course
S0018	yeah
S0170	and then you can become a speech therapist or there's a one year course but it's in essex or london
S0018	eh huh oh what's wrong
S0170	you'll have it with your relevant degree and then you can do a one year sort of like fast track to be a speech therapist
S0018	fantastic
S0170	i be interest in it but i'm not sure it's just
S0018	yeah
S0170	now i've get little
S0018	and what do they class as a relevant degree
S0170	well something with well languages linguistics em they didn't really list it what what it be but i think linguistics be a main one
S0018	what do you study
S0170	linguistics and spanish
S0018	oh really
S0170	yeah
S0018	ah that sound really interest when you're a speech therapist what em be that work with the nhs
S0170	yeah they that so they they've get their
S0018	so yeah tell me about speech therapy be it be it quite em a demand course
S0170	i think so i mean i read about the modules a bite and it's quite an intense one year course
S0018	mm
S0170	because you have to learn about everything but and i think you have to specialise i want to either do em speech therapy for people who have have brain injuries or children
S0018	mm
S0170	so but then to do the speech therapy em assistant you have to have some experience of work with children
S0018	oh
S0170	before so i didn't have that
S0018	oh don't you have you not teach kid
S0170	i teach for two weeks one easter but em i haven't do it more than that no
S0018	and doesn't have your own kid
S0170	well now i have
S0170	now i have and i'll see how his language develop well i've hear cos he'll be hear cos he's hear polish and english that he'll take longer to start speak
S0018	yeah i hear that cos i do em psycholinguistics in my degree and write write a paper about the bilingual lexicon and yeah i hear that that they develop they still develop the two language systems you know like natives
S0170	mm hm
S0018	but they do take a little longer
S0170	yeah cos you can imagine it's a lot to take in isn't it it take long enough when you're learn one language
S0018	mm
S0170	let alone two em my friend who be from quebec
S0018	mm
S0170	in canada so she speak like french and i think her mum be eh german so in her house she hear english german and french and she say she use to say sentence in a mixture of all three languages cos she know something like cup she only know it in french so she'd say the whole sentence in english but the french word for cup and she didn't know what it be in in english
S0018	i miss speak spanglish yeah most of my friends in spain be em english speakers and spanish speakers so you could always mix up the two languages in a sentence cos some expressions or some word
S0170	mm hm
S0018	different languages have better ways of express it so it's it's weird not use eh spanglish
S0170	my thing be i put english grammar we use the english grammar but with spanish word sometimes i didn't know and you know you'd be like what
S0018	so when do you learn spanish
S0170	just do the degree i think that be my mistake i think well but uni offer it as an intensive but it wasn't really that intensive it be like six hours a week
S0018	uh huh
S0170	and then you be suppose to finish your degree the same level as someone who's do gcse plus a level
S0018	blimey
S0170	so
S0018	that's eh that's a lot
S0170	and it be then we be we be put together then after the first year with people who have do gcse a level plus the first year
S0018	crikey
S0170	and then intensive
S0018	and do you spend time in spain as part of your degree
S0170	yeah i be in granada
S0018	oh lovely
S0170	for nine months and i think i understand some spanish but when i go to granada i didn't understand anyone
S0018	mm
S0170	except my landlord and he be an english teacher and he speak really slowly and everything my friend i know how she do it she didn't speak a word she be from germany
S0018	mm hm
S0170	and she phone up place not speak any spanish try to find a place to live how would how you know what do you say to them on the phone cos i wouldn't have do it
S0018	it be so much more difficult on the phone as well isn't it cos
S0170	yeah we do have when i be when em and luckily i be with eh and she speak very good spanish she's italian she she learn really quickly and em she would speak to people on the phone and arrange but sometimes they wouldn't want eh non spanish
S0018	mm
S0170	there be certain areas that we phone and they would say no sorry
S0018	yeah
S0170	we want spanish speakers
S0018	i guess they didn't want people who would be only there for like nine months or something
S0170	yeah
S0018	mm
S0170	and hey
S0018	have you be back to granada's since you live there
S0170	no i haven't i want to i want to go with and show him where i live and everything i be really lucky we find a lovely apartment in em
S0018	uh huh
S0170	and it be like a the traditional part
S0018	whereabouts be that i know granada a little bite em yeah
S0170	it's up by it's not far from the
S0018	uh huh
S0170	so it be really close and like that's on top of the hill and it's down the side
S0018	ah lovely where all the little white house be
S0170	yeah
S0018	with the patios and aw
S0170	yeah
S0018	that be
S0170	but we do we have one of the apartments where you know you get the square hole in the middle and
S0018	oh
S0170	and it's quite dark
S0018	i like them though
S0170	but it's lovely
S0018	nice
S0170	very traditional spanish
S0018	mm and do you go to uni while you be there
S0170	i do yeah i think that's why my spanish be very em passive knowledge i
S0018	mm
S0170	i can watch spanish film i can hear people speak and i can understand but try to put sentence and express myself
S0018	yeah it's difficult isn't it if you don't practice actually produce it it's it's a lot more difficult to cos you learn a lot of word through
S0170	mm
S0018	hear them don't you
S0170	yeah
S0018	but you you don't your brain doesn't actually automatically throw them out until you've actually use them
S0170	weli i read spanish and i say em like i understand that story so i don't understand then why i don't know it when i try and speak it's really weird i and i just really
S0018	i think there's some theory that say you have to use a word seven plus or minus two time before your brain can produce it
S0170	mm hm
S0018	so you can you can recognise it but you have to actually produce it you know a a certain amount of time before you know it's integrate into your vocabulary
S0170	mm but the accent as well when i go to granada it's they say it's like a brummie accent here people make fun of the the accent from down south in spain and and when i come back here and speak with eh boyfriend
S0018	uh huh
S0170	he say oh you sound like you're from granada
S0018	be he from the north
S0170	i think so yeah
S0018	yeah
S0170	no madrid
S0018	ah okay
S0170	he's from madrid
S0018	well in granada do they speak with like if they say gracias do they say gracias or
S0170	mm and they cut the end off of everything
S0018	eh yes it's similar like
S0170	gracia
S0018	yeah similar in murcia
S0170	yeah they don't have the ss on the end it's like como esta
S0018	but do you practice it a lot or do you like em have a lot of spanish friends and speak with them or be it a more erasmus students stick together
S0170	more erasmus students not not so much but we be in the faculty of em of translation and interpretation well not you know the translation part
S0018	yes
S0170	you know translation em part and a lot of the students want to practice their english with you
S0018	uh huh
S0170	but they say this university be like the equivalent of oxford and they be you could tell it be it be very good
S0018	mm hm
S0170	university and their english be very good
S0018	mm
S0170	with no accent some of the younger students
S0018	well they learn it from such a young age over there don't they
S0170	and and you can imagine they like the equivalent of the like rich students they've probably be send to england every summer and and they they speak english incredibly well so they just use to practice with us with me another english guy there we always use to get people want to to talk with us in english and em he be the same he didn't improve his spanish he be quite good before but he be there with his family and that be different
S0018	mm and do you live with the italian girl
S0170	i live with who's from italy and another girl from poland
S0018	uh huh so you speak english at home
S0170	yeah but we we try sometimes to speak in spanish
S0018	it's really unnatural though isn't it it's difficult no i be lucky when i go to spain because i be apart from lisa who's em bilingual cos her father's spanish and her mother's english all my friends over there be spanish so i have to start produce it and
S0170	yeah
S0018	and i i be lucky in that respect be that i become fluent in about six months i know nothing when i go there
S0170	it be i things like have to order and by the end i mean i could do all things like i would things i have to do quite often order bombones
S0170	things like that or have have to eh i go to the dentist and have to explain in in spanish what what be wrong and you know and and things like that my spanish be a lot my spanish be a hell of a lot better than when i go i would say
S0018	mm
S0170	i be a beginner when i go i didn't understand anything
S0018	mm but it's the yeah the communication likely you be able to communicate in a shop it's the thing that probably come first isn't it
S0170	mm
S0018	be you're interact in society be your be your class in spanish
S0170	they be they be well and this be the funny thing because it be the translation and i have to take a language so i learn italian
S0170	i end i end up give a presentation in italian oh give a presentation in italian when i be there to learn spanish
S0018	oh no
S0170	and i sort of three six nine nine hours a week i do italian
S0018	mm
S0170	and it be either italian french or german i have i have to take that fit in into my timetable
S0018	uh huh
S0170	and i do a translation from spanish to english science and technology i do translation of newspapers article and stuff
S0018	mm
S0170	but i couldn't do it the other way because my spanish wasn't good enough
S0018	uh huh
S0170	so i be just take it the higher level
S0018	mm hm
S0170	modules of because for them that be a higher level translation start with english to spanish
S0018	mm hm
S0170	and then spanish to english so i be in like
S0018	yeah i do a a translation course em at international house in barcelona and oh yeah it be it be really interest the teacher be really good but i find it really difficult to to translate i don't know cos when you're use to speak other languages and learn them when you're abroad
S0170	mm hm
S0018	you're not necessarily translate you're not really develop the skill of translate cos if you learn it through immersion you have kind of a separate system in your head
S0170	yeah
S0018	so i find it quite difficult to to i don't know sometimes english would just sound when i translate it into english it just didn't sound english and i didn't have that capability of be able to
S0170	yeah i have to yeah i have to change it i do one module of theory and of translation and that be quite interest
S0018	mm
S0170	but can you imagine like sit in lecture and i be please don't ask me a question please don't ask me a question
S0170	for the first semester i didn't understand what the hell they be go on about and i just want to not go i think no no i've get to go i've get to go and i'm glad i do because i think that help me learn but at first you're just sit there just listen to them blah blah blah blah blah blah and some of the lecturers be really it's a proper lecture
S0018	mm
S0170	there be an older guy we do em spanish history and em he be just like la la la la la la the whole
S0018	monotone
S0170	yeah he just and he have like his note in front of him and turn the page la la la la la it be it be awful and then he'd ask question at the end and it be like
S0018	head down don't pick me
S0170	please don't pick me
S0018	what be your class lecture
S0170	pardon
S0018	be all your class lecture format
S0170	no no i mean the translation ones they be really good
S0018	uh huh
S0170	but the translation from spanish to english the science one it be teach by an english guy
S0018	uh huh
S0170	who do the lesson in english
S0018	ah
S0170	and eh so that be that be i mean cos then he would always use me as the the person to explain things
S0170	to the some of the students
S0018	do they set up any language exchange for you
S0170	yeah they do and i have an
S0018	oh good
S0170	i have em i do with one girl call eh and eh she be really nice and another girl call and we end up go to morocco together which be good
S0018	oh okay
S0170	because everyone else be with erasmus students
S0018	mm hm
S0170	and i have with me
S0018	mm hm
S0170	and she be talk constantly in spanish with me
S0018	fantastic while you be in morocco speak french too no
S0018	you have a right hotch potch of languages spanish eh italian at home
S0170	oh i know i know it be it be just so funny that i couldn't believe that i'd go to spain and end up my main exam be a presentation in italian
S0018	my friend he come over to university to do the erasmus and he be live in a house full of italian people
S0170	mm hm
S0018	and his english actually improve quite a lot when he be there but he learn fluent fluent italian when there as well
S0170	i think italian and spanish be it complicate thing because they're so similar
S0018	yeah definitely
S0170	really similar that some sometimes you i'd be pronounce things like the italians would and in my i have an intensive spanish class as well at the language centre
S0018	mm hm
S0170	which be good i really really enjoy that cos they do it how we teach esol here
S0018	uh huh
S0170	which it all like at university it be very dry
S0018	yeah more like study it as oppose to learn how to use it
S0170	yeah and then i but i really enjoy those class but all my classmates be italian except for em well the german girl and i be like sometimes i didn't understand when they speak spanish because and the teacher say you know why because they're not speak spanish to me they're speak italian
S0170	and they're just hop that it's
S0018	but it be it's so similar i think sometimes it might be more difficult to learn a language that be similar to yours because you know it it come so naturally to you
S0170	mm hm
S0018	to say something a certain way as if it's completely different maybe it's easier to remember but no when i i think i go to india about seven years after i'd start live in spain
S0170	mm hm
S0018	and i hang out with a couple of italian people and i be surprise that i could understand pretty much everything that they be talk about
S0170	yeah
S0018	because i speak spanish
S0170	yeah
S0018	and i speak spanish to them they understand and they'd speak italian back to me and and i'd understand
S0170	and french help as well if you've get french and spanish then you can understand pretty much everything
S0018	yeah definitely
S0170	cos there's a lot of crossover between them if it's not similar to spanish then it's similar to french
S0018	mm yeah but no say that all the erasmus students the em the ones who do get english friends they make fantastic progress but i remember we be live in in the first year with some i think they be chinese maybe em and they just stay together in their little social group all the time and
S0170	mm
S0018	it be funny at six o'clock all the chinese people would walk across the quad there be like em all the the accommodation be around a grassy quad and they'd all be there carry their woks and their their ingredients over to someone's they appoint someone's house every night to go and eat together in but they'd just stick together all the time and they didn't learn at all
S0170	yeah that's like the students they're the ones we have in the summer isn't it
S0018	yeah well i'm em friends on facebook with quite a few of the students we have
S0170	mm
S0018	mm last summer not the ones from the summer before
S0170	mm hm
S0018	but and i think because they be they be art students they be all do oh you know from the eh mine be fashion and
S0170	mm hm i have one fashion
S0018	interior design and they i get the feel that they'd make more of an effort to actually integrate and meet people and communicate
S0170	mm hm
S0018	in english more than the students we'd have the years before who be do business and stuff
S0170	yeah
S0018	but
S0170	it be hard over the summer though who who do they have to integrate
S0018	but they haven't
S0170	no
S0018	they've all join the chinese church and all of their social activities revolve around the chinese church
S0170	really
S0018	yeah and i think the only english they're get be em at university
S0170	mm
S0018	they haven't you know make any english speak friends
S0170	mm
S0018	and all their status update be in chinese and it it's just such a shame cos
S0170	yeah
S0018	i understand during the presessional course
S0170	mm hm
S0018	you know they stick together cos it's a new a totally different situation for them
S0170	mm
S0018	it would be comfort to to have you know chinese around them but they
S0170	yeah
S0018	it seem like they're do it all the time it's a shame
S0170	yeah there be a few people i mean there's i don't know if you know and they've em integrate well i think
S0018	have they
S0170	they're they're come on really well
S0018	oh super
S0170	they be but they're taiwanese and not chinese
S0018	ah yeah actually the taiwanese students i hear they already have a better level of speak english
S0170	mm
S0018	their write ability wasn't great but do do they speak english
S0170	yes
S0018	more in taiwan
S0170	they must do i don't know why why it be but they didn't need the visa do they so maybe they're from
S0018	eh okay
S0170	one or two have have be here before
S0018	mm hm
S0170	and maybe for like summer or something so
S0018	and what be they do be they em meet up with their course mat and stuff and speak english
S0170	yeah they're just like write things on facebook in english and they have they seem to have friends from other nationalities maybe not just english but maybe i don't know if they be european students who be their friends and stuff that's encourage them to use english
S0018	that's good
S0170	yeah
S0018	that's fantastic no i reckon when they do the presessional that they shouldn't all be put together in a hall of residence it's it kind of create a ghetto doesn't it
S0170	yeah
S0018	and it set them up with bad habit from the start i think if they if they have a home stay for the five or ten weeks and a presessional
S0170	mm
S0018	and actually integrate into life in a family and kinda get a bite more expose to the culture and embrace live in a different country
S0170	yeah that's and and separate them when don't let them choose the same roommates for a whole year
S0018	yeah
S0170	and get to separate and
S0018	mm
S0170	but the the people who have move out it's like they be eh one they be one couple and and and another one they've all they all move out when they have that opportunity to move out
S0018	uh huh
S0170	and they they're the ones who be do better
S0018	yeah it's not surprise isn't it
S0170	mm hm
S0018	that's the thing it be so difficult to improve their mark over the ten weeks of the course
S0170	mm hm
S0018	cos you know
S0170	you're just speak with well just in the class with us but then
S0018	and even then they weren't particularly forthcoming in speak in english actually i i think by the end i think they've be train to
S0170	i'm pretty good for the first couple of weeks they speak nothing but english
S0018	mm hm
S0170	and then it's slowly slide into
S0018	as their social life because they didn't really know each other before do they i think they become more socially em active with each other they start slip into chinese more yeah i guess it's typical
S0170	i don't know it be hard learn a language it's not an easy thing especially when you when you when you start when you're older i mean i i learn french at school but i it be a large class of thirty or so students i didn't think i really know french but i still remember some phrase but i i be definitely not fluent or anything in it
S0018	mm
S0170	and apart from that i've never study a language and then i suddenly start spanish
S0018	but it must have be easier for you to learn a bite of spanish because your brain be use to learn french
S0170	yeah
S0018	i think just the the skill of of be able to memorise word and spot pattern even if you can't speak it fluently it's definitely
S0170	i don't know it's how how how easy it be to learn italian
S0018	mm
S0170	not even just cos of the similarities but it be it just be easier the more you use that part of the brain
S0018	mm
S0170	i think it do get easier to remember word and everything
S0018	yeah definitely
S0170	but it be funny cos every time i want to think of a spanish word i think of the italian word
S0170	or even now like i'm learn a bite of polish and i'm try to think of the polish word i think of the spanish word and it's like oh
S0018	be you go to class for polish or
S0170	no i'm just try to learn from home with and his son
S0018	oh
S0170	his son's a better teacher than be
S0018	be he bring up bilingual his son
S0170	no no no no he just learn english since he's be here in eh in england
S0018	oh really
S0170	but he come here when he be about three
S0018	oh okay
S0170	so yeah he's he speak like polish at home
S0018	uh huh
S0170	but at school he's speak english and he laugh at his dad
S0170	i speak better english than you
S0018	do he have a little accent when he speak english
S0170	no he sound like a brummie
S0018	oh really
S0170	yeah
S0018	oh crikey but he didn't start learn till he be three
S0170	mm hm
S0018	i guess that's in that sensitive period for learn
S0170	yeah i don't know well
S0018	learn the accent and stuff
S0170	mm but he can't he can of course polish be his first language but he can't write in polish
S0018	mm
S0170	he can write in english he be send message to his em his aunty and i say why be you write message to her in english i say eh be you not go to write it in polish and he try and he couldn't spell the word
S0018	oh be it phonetic
S0170	it be but there be a few sound that em you have to learn majority of it be be phonetic but there be like the shhh chhh chhh
S0018	mm hm
S0170	kind of sound that you have to learn those
S0018	mm hm
S0170	it's the same in english isn't it when they learn phonetically there be certain sound you just have to to learn
S0018	do help you do you speak a bite of polish when you're together
S0170	not really no she's surprise at time when i'm with and she's like oh you you understand again i understand
S0018	uh huh
S0170	more but i can say a a little bite
S0018	be it similar to spanish at all
S0170	no
S0018	no
S0170	oh there's one thing be the same and playa be plaga
S0018	uh huh
S0170	in polish be plaga
S0018	what be the root of the polish language then be they similar to german or
S0170	it's like slavic language
S0018	eh okay
S0170	there's no similarity to german
S0018	mm hm
S0170	there's a few latin word in there
S0018	mm hm
S0170	but eh no it's mainly slavic
S0018	mm
S0170	then it's like it's just like shhh khhh shhhhk and lot of like those kind of sound
S0018	that's like czech
S0170	yeah
S0018	probably
S0170	yeah
S0018	i live in prague for a couple of months eh do the teacher train
S0170	mm hm
S0018	and oh it be so difficult to learn pick up word just cos there's they seem so alien
S0170	i know say i think i'm say it how he say it to me and he say like no no no and he keep say it i'm like i'm say it like that he say you're not it's like a because you know like be like thank you but you just say it and then one be little pig
S0018	no
S0170	and one be thank you careful when you say that little pig little pig
S0018	that's like chinese though isn't em cos it's tonal if you say if you say one word with a certain intonation it mean god and if you say it with a different intonation it mean i don't know i can't remember if it's eleven or something like that hello yeah mm i don't think i'll be learn any more languages
S0170	no i'd like to if i go somewhere to learn a few word so i could just be polite
S0018	mm
S0170	but to learn a whole new language i might i think i'll learn polish because i'll want to understand when he's speak with his dad and
S0018	yeah
S0170	even if i just understand it rather than speak it
S0018	yeah
S0170	and with 's family cos they're come over at easter
S0018	oh
S0170	and when 's not there
S0018	mm
S0170	he be at work the last time they come and i end up like say something really embarrass yeah cos i think i tell you well i say this when i be with i say like little
S0018	oh yeah
S0170	come come and eh but in hodge podge in in polish and it's like how you would speak to a child child a little little baby
S0018	i'm sure he find it endear as oppose to insult though
S0170	yeah things like that i'd i'd like to be able to just communicate a little bite with his family
S0018	mm
S0170	cos i know on skype it's like i just say hello how be you and that's about it really
S0018	but you understand more or less the the thread of the conversation when they're speak
S0170	yeah cos there be word that i understand now like i know work i know car i know airplane i know i know word
S0018	mm hm
S0170	but their grammar be so hard
S0018	really
S0170	yeah
S0018	do it have a lot of tense or be it
S0170	it's em not tense i forget what they call it when it's one word em it's a it's a verb like in spanish where you change it fully to the person
S0018	mm hm
S0170	like and depend on i be you be
S0018	uh huh
S0170	there's those things but also you change it depend accusative
S0018	oh the case
S0170	yeah the case that's it the case
S0018	be that call decline or something decline the verb oh i yeah cos i study latin for a year
S0170	mm hm
S0018	at school and remember
S0170	it's that sort of case god
S0018	oh really nightmare
S0170	there be eight case
S0018	oh
S0170	so it change cos i know like i'm sure he say something about work cos it's and it's and so i'm know it's about work but i'm not sure who it's talk about his work or their work or
S0018	ah
S0170	i don't know the end of the verbs and that
S0018	that's so complicate so do every different conjugation in every different tense have eight possibilities depend on the case
S0170	yeah
S0018	but that just make
S0170	what be it german have eight case and this one have seven
S0018	for a lot but still that's a lot a mighty load of end to remember
S0170	it be cos like i'll say like em little but that you in spanish like or depend on male or masculine or feminine
S0018	yeah yeah
S0170	and then he say something else and it's like well why have you change it for that
S0018	yeah i remember the i i didn't i didn't even get my head around the concepts of the different case i think when i be i think i be only twelve when i'd study latin
S0170	mm
S0018	but be it stuff like genitive accusative dative
S0170	mm hm yeah those things i mean i don't even i don't understand it totally
S0018	mm hm
S0170	so i like try to learn it it would be really hard
S0018	have you a teach yourself book
S0170	i there be i have get a work book and a textbook i think i need help with it i don't think
S0018	mm
S0170	it's all in em polish so i just and i don't want like learn a language like that
S0018	yeah
S0170	either
S0018	but you might find because you're hear a lot of it em if you get a a teach yourself book and just start to become aware of all the different end and all the different you know pick up some more vocabulary maybe you'll start think when you listen to eh huh that would be that word
S0170	yeah
S0018	with that end
S0170	yeah i think i'll learn better i think i'm an oral learner rather than a
S0018	uh huh ah no i'm a visual learner i need to see it write down before i
S0170	be you no that's not how i learn best i think watch film in spanish and be in the classroom just listen just listen
S0018	mm
S0170	it help me a lot
S0018	yeah i remember a phase that that i go through i think it be about three months after i i i live in spain em and i could i could just put together sentence and express pretty much a lot of basic things and have conversations socially
S0170	mm hm
S0018	but because i could put together a sentence quite easily em then people would think oh she speak spanish they'd just go brrrrr back so i develop this em defence mechanism of just not let other people reply just speak speak speak and not give them a little space to respond cos as soon as they'll something and i'll be like i don't know what you've just say sorry
S0170	yeah and when you've learn it you've learn you say this then they say that then you say this and then they say that and then you say it and they say something completely different and it's like em
S0018	one tiny word can throw you no i em before i go to spain i i get a bbc teach yourself spanish book
S0170	mm hm
S0018	and it be it wasn't it be all communicative in that every at the begin of every chapter there be a little dialogue
S0170	mm hm
S0018	and then afterwards it pick apart of the dialogue in term of vocabulary and the different little grammar bits that we use but as chunk not
S0170	yeah
S0018	okay we're gonna learn the present tense no it be what be use in that dialogue
S0170	yeah
S0018	be explain and i think that be a fantastic way of of learn it help me a lot
S0170	yeah
S0018	to to be able to recognise a lot of speech obviously produce it be more difficult after but
S0170	mm i remember be in in spain somebody come up to me and i'm think i understand what they're say but they're not speak
S0018	oh bless you
S0170	bless you they're not speak spanish to me and then i realise they be italian
S0018	oh
S0170	and i didn't see it and i be study italian at the time and that be really bizarre because i don't i didn't know what to reply i understand what they'd ask me but i wasn't sure how to reply cos i like that's not spanish but for a second i be a bite frighten that someone have come up to me in spain and speak to me not in spanish but just in italian and i be a bite confuse
S0018	i have that when i go to em i go to em i go to monaco with eh two spanish friends and an english friend and i be the only one who speak french and the two spanish friends didn't speak much english
S0170	mm
S0018	so we be we be pretty much operate in spanish apart from me and the english girl we be talk english to each other
S0170	mm hm
S0018	but everything any kind of interaction with the french world have to come through me so she'd say it to me in english and i have to translate and then the spanish guy would speak to me in spanish and i have to translate that into french and there be a moment when just my head and explode especially because it be culturally as well i be interpret because em the two guy from eh murcia they we be at breakfast and they want to order toast with tomato on
S0170	oh no
S0018	i say yeah but look in we're in france you can have croissant you can have pain au chocolat you can have anything sweet and pastry like but toast with tomato on be not part of their culture hello what do you mean everyone's get toast surely they've get some tomatoes i be like they don't know how to do it
S0018	then again i remember in the first month i think i be in spain i order toast with tomato on and i think it be gonna come in slice of tomato and when it come with just yeah
S0170	like the tomato paste on
S0018	yeah cos they just squeeze out the juice and grate a bite of the flesh into it
S0170	mm
S0018	and add olive oil and i be like where be the tomato i order tomatoes and they be like it's there on it and i felt very put out
S0170	i remember order tea with milk just get a a cup of hot milk with a tea bag in it
S0018	oh
S0170	so i have to soon learn to say can i have eh tea with milk separate
S0018	cold milk on the side
S0170	yes my friend be laugh she be she be italian she be laugh at me another italian girl i my friend and we go we travel round a little bite and she just laugh at me because of my face when i be give this tea with milk with a tea bag in it i be so disappoint cos i like my tea in the morning i could cope with coffee i don't mind it be such strong coffee wasn't it
S0018	yeah no i always have em decaf in a sachet
S0170	mm hm
S0018	and just a cup of hot milk and i'd just sprinkle a bite of decaf coffee and cos yeah they make it so strong
S0170	yeah
S0018	then again when i be in france i use to have em le petit noir like a tiny little cup of really intense coffee and when i be like eighteen nineteen i could quite happily drink three or four a day but when i don't know what when i be about twenty one twenty two i just develop this complete my body couldn't take caffeine i think maybe i'd drink too much in france em yeah it be just ah
S0170	i'm the same i never use to like coffee and then i work in eh costa coffee and have it there i just try it a few time and actually that's it's alright now i like to drink a lot of it and have a café au lait with a croissant ooh yes
S0018	yum yum yum yum yeah i hat olives before i go to spain and then it be cos when you visit people's house they always want to give you things to eat and drink and you know it's from their from their earth olives how can you not like olives it use to be like a personal insult so i'd have to eat olives and then i actually develop quite a taste for them which be good cos they're nice and healthy
S0170	mm
S0018	but i never manage to develop a taste for seafood
S0170	oh it do oh i love it oh octopus
S0018	urgh
S0170	calamari oh i love it love it love it
S0018	disgust
S0170	i remember eh order some i be like i didn't recognise anything on the menu everywhere you go it different dish and different part and you don't know what it doesn't say what be in each just the name of the dish so i be i want seafood it be my birthday and i want seafood i'm gonna treat myself
S0018	mm hm
S0170	and i get this whole big it look like a round squid a whole one and everyone be look at me cos he say it's like calamari
S0018	uh huh
S0170	cos i say what be what be that like and he be explain and what's that like and he be explain and that one be like calamari i though okay that's the one then
S0018	be those the little small ring
S0170	mm hm
S0018	they look like onion ring
S0170	yeah
S0018	they do those well in granada don't they
S0170	mm and you have them sometimes with free with the as tapas part of the
S0018	eh the first time i visit granada we arrive at the the bus station i think
S0170	yeah
S0018	and get off the bus after a five hour rather worry trip around all these very thin country roads on a mountain and worry that the bus be go to drop off so we go straight to the bar when we get off the bus and i just order a little beer and it come with like a a ham sandwich
S0170	oh yeah
S0018	and i be like no we didn't ask for that no it's alright it's free eat it yey
S0170	that's great that's why i'm think my my other half will love it in granada you just you order a drink and gain food my dad actually get to the point where he say eh how do you ask he phone me up not bring cos he my dad be great like that he'd just go off and go to place by himself and try and speak a little bite of the language cos i go to uni and em i phone him oh dad i've finish where be you i'm in the hairdresser
S0170	he go to have his hair cut i mean not many people would go and do that would they if you don't speak the language and just i be okay i take my guide book with me and just you know try to say the sentence you know short back and side
S0018	my mum's quite my mum's the same but my dad be completely not i remember we be in this em we be in majorca i go over to visit them when they be on holiday there and we'd stop off at a little restaurant on the motorway so it wasn't even like a little restaurant for tourists it be for truckers and they probably didn't even speak spanish cos it be all majorcan catalan
S0170	uh huh
S0018	and there's my dad in the middle of the restaurant eh excuse me excuse dad shhh i can translate for you and everyone's like look around who be that linguistic imperialist over there who will only speak english but my mum well she come over to murcia when we just get a cat and the cat be a bite ill em so while i be at work she'd go to the chemists
S0170	eh hm
S0018	with no spanish whatsoever she want to get some ointment for the cat's eye
S0170	uh huh
S0018	and she manage to communicate to the the chemist em that she need ointment for the eye and then she say em it's for a cat meow meow so she be just stand there go meow meow at them and they must have think what in the end they realise that she be ask for medicine for a cat but
S0170	yeah it be funny
S0018	crazy crazy crazy crazy i find it do you have a nice lunch have he eat well
S0170	yeah he have actually yeah so that's good so he doesn't seem too bad today with the injections he i think get in there with calpol early
S0018	yeah
S0170	it seem to stop the em the symptoms
S0018	yeah do they say that he might have some specific symptoms
S0170	yeah they say for a few of the injections especially the ones with a live em virus
S0018	uh huh
S0170	that he can i mean the mmr thing that's why it be so controversial be that they can have
S0018	be that the super bug thing
S0170	no it's the eh mumps measles and rubella
S0018	oh okay
S0170	and the injection have it all together em he can have the well he might never have he he might never get the the any of those things
S0018	uh huh
S0170	but if em he have the injection he could possibly get one of the you know like mumps or something
S0018	mm hm
S0170	and he could be really ill and even have em convulsions
S0018	oh no
S0170	i mean it's a one in so many one in a million that it could happen to
S0018	uh huh
S0170	but there be a small chance that it be just as dangerous as him get the actual disease
S0018	right
S0170	i mean he's but you've just get to take all of these things to consideration
S0018	yeah
S0170	i think that's the most that be the most dangerous one
S0018	mm
S0170	the mmr one that's why some people choose not to give it to their children
S0018	right
S0170	cos it can cause problems if their their brain can swell and cause brain damage and things like that i've read about
S0018	lordy
S0170	and it must be horrible if and autism as well
S0018	mm
S0170	so it must be terrible if you do give your child the injection and you know and he be one of the ones that
S0018	mm hm
S0170	do have autism and
S0018	do you need a towel or something
S0170	i
S0018	where's your bag yeah which one this one
S0170	yeah
S0018	that's the one what be we look for baby wipe
S0170	mm no we get like a little muslin cloth muslin
S0018	let's see oh here it be oh no no that's a baby wipe
S0170	oh that's a wipe i'll use a wipe
S0018	oh gosh sorry
S0170	no it's okay maybe i've leave it in the car eeh a baby wipe will do ooh dear
S0018	no he seem fine
S0170	he do
S0018	survive his traumatic experience how many time do they inject him
S0170	twice in one leg and once on other
S0018	aw
S0170	like that leg and chht that one
S0018	do he do he scream every time they do it
S0170	he be smile at the nurse and then suddenly she like chhk and he be waaaaaa not a little not a little eh grumble it be a real what have you do to me what have you do i think you look nice
S0018	how dare you you be smile at me and then you hurt me
S0170	but i i do before i hold him like this way and look at him and i'm think well maybe he think it's me
S0018	yeah face the nurse face the nurse
S0170	it's her she do it
S0018	aw and do he usually sleep after a fee or
S0170	sometimes
S0018	do he get like energetic
S0170	it's because he's somewhere new and em he seem to be quite like oh what's that what's that and he get excite but when i be with camilla and em the lady and he just he be sit like this and he just go bumm he he'd stop himself sleep for so long he fight he'd fight it for so long then he em he be just bumm but he doesn't do that very much usually i have to fee him to sleep or rock him to sleep or something but he'll get tire he'll just go
S0018	do you notice do do baby normally get burp after a fee
S0170	with breastfeed not so much no
S0018	eh okay
S0170	it's not like with bottle where they can get a lot of air
S0018	uh huh
S0170	breastfeed they tend to not need it so much you can just sit him up like that and be upright it will tend to
S0018	it will come out
S0170	come out yeah need out
S0018	burpy burp burp
S0170	yeah he's not really a windy baby be you cos some some baby have it worse and they just need every stop burp stop burp
S0018	mm
S0170	but with bottle it's a lot worse
S0018	i guess you get a lot more air go in don't you
S0170	yeah
S0018	he seem so placid though
S0170	he be
S0018	how do he compare to the baby of the other mums that you know
S0170	em one or two like they can be a bite manic but i'm alright em but he's alright until he get hungry or tire and then he'll be a little bite waaaa
S0018	do you recognise what he well if he's cry to do recognise what kind of cry it be
S0170	yeah yeah but i try now i think to i think well now he must be get hungry he will get hungry soon so i fee him now just before he get to that stage and then he kind of do less cry so i just sort of
S0018	and if he's in pain just can you tell
S0170	yeah because you can't stop him cry with a toy or something
S0018	ah
S0170	so i just know it if you can't console him then must be something wrong and he have that once with the second injection and he be just inconsolable
S0018	aw
S0170	i just have to carry him around in a in a sling just with me and i take him to the chemist like it be about mm seven o'clock at night in the winter and so it be quite cold and dark and just have him in my sling run up to the chemist what can i do he's not stop cry for two hours
S0018	oh no
S0170	they say calpol it be it's wonderful wonderful stuff isn't it magic calpol i don't like to give him too many medicine and stuff
S0018	no but i mean if it's go to stop him suffer so much it's not gin be it
S0170	no
S0018	that's what they use to dose up the baby in victorian time stop and give it a whiskey bite of gin and do he he sleep through the night well
S0170	no because he's breastfeed they digest it really quickly
S0018	uh huh
S0170	and they don't last as long cos em bottle feed baby bottle feed baby can be very placid because it's like what be it a nurse say
S0018	do you want me to pull the curtain over
S0170	it's like what's ah that's better
S0018	there you go
S0170	it's like give them a a sunday dinner
S0018	mm
S0170	every time you fee them whereas breastfeed they take how much they want if they want a drink if they want a snack if they want a three course meal they choose and they take what they need and with a bottle you just kind of fill them up cos it say you know you've get to be seven ounces so go go come on you've get to be seven ounces so you you you know sometimes you fill them up too much
S0018	mm
S0170	and then they're em very quiet and that's why and it take a while to digest it
S0018	mm hm
S0170	but with breast milk it can be digest within when they're younger an hour and they're hungry again so but their stomach be like so small that they can't take very much
S0018	how many time do you have to get up in the night to fee him
S0170	last night be a bad night
S0018	oh dear
S0170	we wake up quite a few time didn't we but the night before he sleep all the way through
S0018	how bizarre
S0170	yeah
S0018	very weird do he sleep eh in the same room as you at the moment
S0170	yeah he do sometimes sleep in bed with me yeah
S0018	oh
S0170	especially when he's wake up so often cos it's just easier to fee him
S0018	yeah
S0170	and then go back straight to sleep again
S0018	yeah definitely
S0170	so i can get up get him out and
S0018	do you find it quite easy to get back to sleep after
S0170	yeah i'm get very good at it i didn't i use to really bad at if someone disturb me it would make me crazy and i couldn't get back to sleep for age now i don't sometimes i don't even know i've wake i i remember it a little bite i'm sure i feed him cos he's in bed with me
S0170	cos i put him to sleep in his bed
S0018	uh huh
S0170	and then he wake up a few time and he'll end up stay with me so he's in the bed with me but i don't remember really it's like half half asleep feed sometimes
S0018	then again i guess i believe we've get in build mechanisms to cope with that no
S0170	yeah you just get you get use to it
S0018	yeah
S0170	you don't probably wake up like half asleep feed and then it's easier to get back to sleep if you wake up that's it then
S0018	be do wake up as well
S0170	sometimes but i try and get him like he cos he'll be he'll be like this he'll be move and you can hear him move and i think i'm not even deep sleep cos i wake up
S0018	mm
S0170	when i just hear him move
S0018	mm hm
S0170	aha here's the time for food i just get to him before he he get to cry stage
S0018	yeah
S0170	because then that cry stage be harder to
S0018	yeah
S0170	calm them down and
S0018	and when he start drink bottle be you gonna share the get up in the middle of the night
S0170	oh yes definitely at weekend
S0018	you're like right i've carry him for nine months and i've get i've get up to breastfeed him for six months and it's your turn
S0170	well i tend to with definitely with nappies and stuff and do bath doesn't he it's daddy time so he can have time to bond with him and daddy bath you
S0018	oh
S0170	yeah except when he's on late shift and then there's time they have together and at first he be just he always i would give him to him and he start cry so he always want me but now he's really good he's really good with him
S0018	good
S0170	yeah i can't imagine be with someone who refuse to change nappies or anything weli i don't know if i would be i wouldn't
S0170	have a kid with someone who refuse to change any nappies or do anything
S0018	be he work week during the week or at weekend too
S0170	yeah no he sometimes do an extra for the weekend cos i'm not get very much at the moment so he's go to take ooh you know in the other bag there's a blue blue cloth
S0018	yeah
S0170	yeah
S0018	and what's his late shift timetable like
S0170	late's two till ten and it's that one week six till two one week two till ten so
S0018	oh he's spat it out again well at least he get to spend time with him in the morning no then
S0170	yeah well i mean like
S0018	can you get a lie in
S0170	sometimes yes yeah but then he try to get his things do doesn't he in the morning sometimes so

S0018	mm hm
S0170	so i'm earn some proper money
S0018	what about the chinese students be you go to do that again
S0170	i think i'll send a message to see but there's nothing nice about em where be i gonna where be i gonna put him
S0018	oh yeah you be talk last time they have a childcare at the university though don't they

S0170	do they
S0018	and how much easier it make go back to work after
S0170	well it would i mean even if it be just like partly subsidize or something i don't mind pay but when it's like three hundred pound a week three hundred pound no it's not three hundred pound a week some place it's about fifty pound a day
S0018	yeah that's horrendous isn't it
S0170	but weekly then maybe two hundred one fifty to two hundred and unless you're earn a pretty decent wage that's the fair whack of it isn't it
S0018	yeah definitely
S0170	and then you just feel like but i want to to to put him somewhere i don't want to just warehouse him cos it my sister say she's in em social policy warehouse or greenhousing i don't want to just stick him somewhere where it's just he's there and so i've get somewhere for him i want him to be somewhere where they can help him develop and
S0018	what about what about polish grandma do she not fancy come over for
