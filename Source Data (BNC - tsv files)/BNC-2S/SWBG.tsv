S0251	i think yesterday go quite well don't you the ruby wed party that we go to
S0252	yes it do and i think everyone have a good time
S0251	yes
S0252	and er it's nice to have a chat to er extend members of the family that i have not see for some time
S0251	that's right mm
S0252	to what extent do you think it be a surprise
S0251	well she say it be a surprise i ask her and she say she hadn't get any idea whether it be a good idea or not i don't know because a few weeks before the party she'd say if anybody give me a surprise party i'd really hate that
S0251	so i don't know and er also they'd only just come back from holiday the day before so i think they could have be a bite tire
S0252	yes
S0251	and the other thing be i think if she'd have know it be a party she'd have probably get dress up a bite more
S0252	mm yes
S0251	also might have make a better and longer speech if he'd have have a bite more time to consider what to say
S0252	be that an advantage or a disadvantage
S0251	it depend whether you like listen to 's speeches or not really
S0251	i think we the journey go quite well we get there easily didn't we
S0252	yes i think one advantage be er not have to drive in as many er urban areas
S0251	yes
S0252	i think the erm a18 manage to mm to some extent provide a bite of a ring road between the and the venue
S0251	yes it's a spectacular bridge the isn't it
S0252	it be yes
S0251	it's quite stun be that mm
S0252	yes it be er erm on on the landscape for at least about a fifteen to twenty mile radius from
S0251	definitely yes it be it's stun
S0252	itself
S0251	and it be a nice bright day as well
S0252	yes i get
S0251	show to the best advantage
S0252	with a nice view of the and we could see
S0251	we do it be all a sparkle
S0252	the sandbanks
S0251	yes
S0252	and yacht and
S0251	yes
S0252	pleasure boat
S0251	yes it be lovely
S0252	yes
S0251	mm you operate the satnav very efficiently didn't you
S0252	yes
S0251	and it take us straight to the venue
S0252	it do
S0251	so as grandad say it's not the drive but the park that's the problem but another problem can be the navigation can't it
S0252	indeed it can
S0251	but the satnav do take some of the guesswork out of it doesn't it
S0252	it do although erm admittedly sometimes it do take you on a rather obscure route
S0251	true
S0252	such as when we be on erm our holiday we be
S0251	mm
S0252	go down some almost single track
S0251	yes the good thing about it though be if you want to go a certain way it do recalculate it doesn't it
S0252	yes
S0251	if you want to take a particular route
S0252	mm it also let you know whether you be happy that the road be a toll road or not
S0251	oh right yes actually i think the toll on the bridge be less this time than when we've be before
S0252	so do i i
S0251	i think it have go down
S0252	yes i think they seem to be do some refurbishment to the toll booths
S0251	oh
S0252	i think they're try to make it into some sort of plaza complex
S0251	oh why be that then
S0252	well it be part of the refurbishment programme
S0251	oh right it's mm we really need to find the charger for that satnav because i don't think it's get much battery leave now have it
S0252	it have not you can recharge it via the plug erm
S0251	in the car
S0252	no from a a three pin socket in the house
S0251	oh right yes
S0252	we've get the charger at the
S0251	right
S0252	but we don't have the in car charger which
S0251	oh i see
S0252	be just mean that if you're do a journey of more than ninety minutes
S0251	yes
S0252	erm you be not really able to use the satnav
S0251	yes oh right and i have my first selfie at the party
S0252	you do you've have it even before i have
S0251	of all the original bridesmaids on that day forty years ago
S0252	yes
S0251	i don't know what i think to selfies really they look a bite funny sometimes really like you have to group in so tightly you look like you're in one of those photo booths don't you
S0252	yes
S0251	which er be a big strange and it's amaze how things have change really my parent have their wed photograph take on glass plat
S0252	yes
S0251	it's amaze what's happen in a generation
S0252	it be and from my point of view if i be show that photograph erm without know what occasion it be be
S0251	yes
S0252	wed photograph i i think i would have fail to have recognise a er the people in it if i have just come it across it by an off chance
S0251	mm
S0252	the the people have change so much since then
S0251	yes
S0252	also it highlight the different fashion blonde hair and
S0251	it do didn't it
S0252	aubergine jacket and
S0251	yes it
S0252	er rather sturdy boot for the occasion and
S0251	well it be the seventies it's call the decade that fashion forget sometimes
S0252	mm yes
S0251	yes and we also get give from one of my other cousins a digitalise dvd of an old cine film
S0252	mm
S0251	which i'm hop to watch apparently
S0252	that's
S0251	it's of christmas 1961
S0252	mm
S0251	of my cousins open their christmas present
S0252	yes
S0251	so that'll be interest to see
S0252	it will
S0251	i think it'll be colour
S0252	oh will it
S0251	i don't know
S0252	right i don't it might be about the time the transition time
S0251	mm
S0252	i would have think
S0251	it be on the television yeah and then we have a photograph take of all the people that be present on that wed day forty years ago
S0252	yes
S0251	i'm afraid we're dwindle in number
S0252	we be but also percentage of the people who attend the party
S0251	yes mm be there yes so it kind of fill me with a bite of nostalgia really
S0252	yes
S0251	which be a long for something that you can't have the past but there again
S0252	at least you've capture the moment
S0251	yes if it be the past then i wouldn't have you would i
S0252	mm no
S0251	and i wouldn't want to miss out on that and er we get back safely take the same route didn't we
S0252	yes we do
S0251	i be pretty tire though when we get back
S0252	we do yes
S0251	so how long do it take us that journey
S0252	i think it be approximately a hundred minutes
S0251	yes and how far be that
S0252	er how far erm well i think it's be about twenty nine miles from the
S0251	yes
S0252	and then i think it's thirty four from the to the house
S0251	yes
S0252	so i think it be possibly about sixty two miles in total
S0251	yeah but it's a lot quicker than when we use to go when we be young and of course the wasn't there
S0252	mm
S0251	we have to go round via which take us hours and hours
S0251	that be really a tortuous route
S0252	yes
S0251	go out of your way the wrong direction before you could turn round to come back
S0252	mm
S0251	you couldn't cross the river in those days
S0252	but er disadvantage of use the erm boat at the time be that the
S0251	no the ferry yes
S0252	the er sandbanks that accumulate in the over the erm mean that sometimes you would be strand on a sandbank
S0251	well that occasionally happen it never happen when i be on it but and it be quite good fun on the ferry anyway
S0252	yes
S0251	we use to get lemonade and crisp and be look out it be quite nice really
S0252	yes so long do do that take
S0251	i can't remember i'd only be quite small i don't know not very long would it
S0252	no maybe a quarter of an hour
S0251	maybe yeah i be go to say twenty minutes yes
S0252	mm
S0251	yeah one thing be load up get the cars on and
S0252	yes
S0251	all the people and that sort of thing
S0252	that would take er quite a bite of time
S0251	mm it do yeah
S0252	it's erm amaze the erm suspension bridge that be currently in place
S0251	yes
S0252	erm that er do use to be one of the world's longest suspension bridge
S0251	it be for at time yes i think it's be supersede now hasn't it with
S0252	yes er i think it it's a bridge in china but i'm not sure
S0251	yes i think you're right mm yeah i don't think they've get the record any more
S0252	no but the chinese have be erm build significant er infrastructure project with their
S0251	mm
S0252	the erm three gorge dam
S0251	right
S0252	and lot of suspension bridge have erm lot of railway project
S0251	mm
S0252	high speed rail they've really spend a lot of money
S0251	mm investments
S0252	mm
S0251	mm and er they get some nice present didn't they
S0252	they do yeah
S0251	somebody get them that rise that's call ruby wed
S0252	yes
S0251	we nearly get that didn't we
S0252	we do
S0251	but i think somebody else might get it so
S0252	yes
S0251	i decide not to
S0252	yes
S0251	i think they get some theatre vouchers
S0252	yes
S0251	quite a good present
S0252	mm
S0251	erm get er some sort of candelabra
S0252	mm
S0251	i didn't see what anybody else have buy do you
S0252	no
S0251	that be what i saw
S0252	mm do you think the er i suppose a book of memories that be present
S0251	yes
S0252	be a good idea
S0251	it be lovely i i be surprise that the book be make of wood wasn't it
S0252	yes
S0251	and it have little erm hearts carve out of it didn't it
S0252	it do
S0251	so it be very attractive haven't see one like that anywhere else
S0252	no
S0251	and er a lot of old photograph and that i hadn't see before
S0252	mm
S0251	quite interest to look at
S0252	yes
S0251	and er there's the er place be nicely decorate with balloon and
S0252	it be
S0251	rise petals and bunt think that the girls have do a good job
S0252	yes i be not expect to help out actually
S0251	no well it be a good job we be a bite early because i i don't think they would have be ready be we hadn't turn up actually
S0252	no no
S0251	there be still quite a bite to do wasn't there lay the table and
S0252	yes
S0251	get all the food out set up the glass and cup and saucers
S0252	mm
S0251	i think they'd er do well to get it all ready and think they'd obviously stay up late make the cake and decorate it
S0252	ah
S0251	and put the vases of flower and the candle for the table decorations
S0252	yes
S0251	they'd be very busy
S0252	i in some ways i mm don't like pin things up when i have to stand on a chair because
S0251	i know it's a bite dangerous isn't it
S0252	i i be nervous that i might fall or especially when the they have to particularly overhang the
S0251	i know
S0252	cup and saucers
S0251	yeah oh yes and i never think i who i must admit be not a very athletic person
S0252	mm
S0251	would ever hold one of the olympic torch
S0252	i know absolutely
S0251	but er but 's husband have be one of the
S0252	torch bearers
S0251	yeah torch bearers as the the relay go around the country didn't it
S0252	yes
S0251	and he have er get the torch which be quite big what
S0252	mm
S0251	would you say how long do you i'd say it be about a metre wouldn't you
S0252	mm er yes it be
S0251	maybe not yeah
S0252	yeah
S0251	about that
S0252	erm
S0251	fairly heavy i think
S0252	the thing that surprise me be i think it be quite top heavy
S0251	it be top heavy wasn't it
S0252	cos just when i first hold it i hold it at a a slant because i be expect the weight to be evenly distribute
S0251	yes it wasn't be it i think because there must be the burner in the top end
S0252	yes
S0251	it's make it heavy but at the pointy end it be quite light wasn't it
S0252	yes
S0251	so you need to hold it higher up didn't you
S0252	you do
S0251	yes that be unexpected pleasure
S0252	it be
S0251	yeah another one for the album there
S0252	yes er but perhaps a an unusual one
S0251	er very yes not many people can say they've hold the olympic torch can they
S0252	no
S0251	so he do well to get choose didn't he
S0252	yes
S0251	surprise but er
S0252	well i suppose he do have a lot possibly have a bite to do with sport and athletics
S0251	he's interest in it
S0252	in the community
S0251	do he still do he still play rugby
S0252	erm i think so
S0251	yes yeah yeah
S0252	rugby be not really a a sport that i er would like to do really any more i think it's a little bite on the rough side
S0251	it's a bite dangerous really isn't it
S0252	yes
S0251	it can be very physical i think you've try it but you didn't especially like it do you
S0252	no
S0251	it didn't really appeal
S0252	mm
S0251	no and i'm not too sorry really because it's not much fun stand on the touchlines on
S0251	cold rainy sunday mornings
S0252	one of the things i i don't particularly like er sort of get soil all over my clothe and
S0251	oh no you get dirty definitely
S0252	er legs et cetera
S0251	oh yes and you need a good bath after that don't you
S0252	yeah i know yeah i know i think it's er well that be when i'm try to do tennis it's er that shouldn't happen
S0251	no yes it's that's more of a summer game though isn't it
S0252	yes i no it be have say that that be a more of a summer game rather than
S0251	yes
S0252	a winter game
S0251	it be isn't it and we saw airport
S0252	yes
S0251	as we be come back
S0252	we do
S0251	but we didn't see many aircraft there though what
S0252	no it's it's dwindle a lot since the start of the recession the original airports such as and have really see a massive reduction in air travel i think have see the lowest level for about fifteen twenty years
S0251	why's that because there aren't the number of people go on foreign holiday or
S0252	well erm airlines have pull out erm certain airlines have close down erm have they've just er they have not be able to keep it up
S0251	so it restrict consumer choice really because it mean you've get to go to the bigger airports like manchester
S0252	yes
S0251	or london
S0252	yes i think one issue be be that many airlines tend to operate like to operate the same class of aircraft so that they erm all operate within say the a320 group or
S0251	yes
S0252	boeing seven three seven group because that mean lower maintenance cost
S0251	mm
S0252	so those aircraft be at least a hundred and twenty possibly up to two hundred and twenty depend exactly what and just simply will not be the demand for that er
S0251	two hundred and twenty what
S0252	people
S0251	oh right passengers
S0252	yes
S0251	passengers that they can have yes
S0252	mm whereas really you want to be use smaller aircraft with maybe fifty to seventy seat
S0251	mm
S0252	which erm would would be a commercially viable option but it's just not what airlines like to do
S0251	because you think you could fill them up easier
S0252	yes
S0251	yes yes
S0252	there be er one commercial aircraft at the airport when we come back
S0251	which one be that
S0252	it be an eastern airways bae jetstream thirty one
S0251	oh right
S0252	it's only a small little aircraft with thirty one seat
S0251	oh that be very small isn't it
S0252	it be
S0251	and there be a couple of
S0252	yes well i think they get quite a lot of trade from north sea oil rig
S0251	oh i see
S0252	yes i think that be a a significant erm source of revenue for the airport erm i'm not sure what the future be go to be like erm i think there's an element of change from er aircraft use to more high speed rail i think er cos eurostar be put er more pressure on rout such as paris and brussels and and obviously you can connect there to as far as spain and italy and germany and erm northern europe so that be a new source of competition that have really erm start to take over domestic rout domestic and short haul rout
S0251	mm
S0252	er from the uk
S0251	i actually prefer go on the eurostar because i find it less stressful than have to go through all the check that you have to go through for the airport it seem much more relax and i think the the ride be more pleasant it's more airy
S0252	it be
S0251	and you can get about and er go down to the buffet car and things
S0252	you can
S0251	there aren't as many restrictions on your luggage be there
S0252	no
S0251	you can more or less take on as much as you can carry and as much as
S0252	yes
S0251	you can manage so i think it's more relax
S0252	it be
S0251	and it's a very smooth ride isn't it
S0252	it be well i think they be weld track
S0251	oh right
S0252	yes it's a special erm type of track for that sort of speed
S0251	mm yeah i've enjoy it
S0252	yes
S0251	and er and you can see the countryside
S0252	you can that's lovely some of it yes
S0251	it's much more interest isn't it especially when we've er be through france
S0252	yes yes yeah
S0251	they're quite rural areas aren't they
S0252	all there be village church and
S0251	yes they're quite attractive aren't they
S0252	er sometimes harvest the crop
S0251	yes
S0252	and sow them yes what i think er would be a good boost except i think in some ways er the italian railway operator trenitalia be erm buy some train that erm be able to recognise and receive all the type of signal and power across europe
S0251	mm
S0252	because each country have different voltages and signal systems
S0251	oh right
S0252	so it should allow er more flexibility in
S0251	yes it would
S0252	erm international rail service
S0251	yes mm
S0252	furthermore they be erm open a new railway line between turin and marseilles
S0251	oh
S0252	erm which will almost halve the journey time between paris and milan so from seven hours to about three and a half
S0251	yes
S0252	so halve
S0251	gosh that would be an achievement that wouldn't it
S0252	it would but it's will take quite a bite of time because they're have to drill under the alps
S0251	oh wow so there's quite some technical challenge
S0252	yes
S0251	by the sound it of
S0252	yes but i think it would definitely be well worth go on i think it will definitely mean that the mid and southern part of italy be reachable from the north of england in a day
S0251	good heavens mm
S0252	it would mean you can just about get to milan in a day
S0251	well yes
S0252	but mm you can't get to erm rome or
S0251	no so that's
S0252	er sicily or
S0251	mm
S0252	anywhere like that in a day
S0251	no yeah that's still good though
S0252	yes
S0251	yes and you you could have a different sort of holiday you could have
S0252	stop off
S0251	yeah stop off have different centre that you visit and as you make your progress to the furthest destination couldn't you
S0252	you could yes
S0251	i think that would be quite an interest way to do it
S0252	it would it would it would require some very effective organisation because
S0251	mm
S0252	those sort of high speed train if you buy the ticket on the day it will cost
S0251	mm
S0252	er a fortune
S0251	yes there'll be a penalty
S0252	so if you you have to book it you know at least for a few months in advance to to get the
S0251	yeah so it would have to be well plan
S0252	the well price ticket
S0251	yes
S0252	because if you do book on the erm not that far in advance
S0251	yes
S0252	it would probably be more expensive than fly
S0251	right mm
S0252	which be a shame because i think with the european union go from one extreme to ban hoover that be too er powerful
S0251	yeah
S0252	they don't think about well what be a significant cause of pollution how that would be an easy fix to have
S0251	mm
S0252	electric railways
S0251	yes
S0252	go at high speed
S0251	yes
S0252	compare to do something as i don't know that's not go to make as much difference like ban
S0251	mm
S0252	hoover size
S0251	no yeah but they're try to make it competitively price really
S0252	yes
S0251	mm
S0252	i think the issue be ban hoover be an easy target and build a lot of railways be a big organisation
S0251	that's more difficult isn't it definitely
S0252	and cost a lot more money
S0251	it do
S0252	but erm i think it be start to come together i think they be get erm new railways build and
S0251	mm
S0252	obviously train that can run in most of europe it should help to
S0251	yeah that's very versatile isn't it
S0252	erm connect europe better
S0251	yes it'll be good
S0252	good would you be tempt to go on that or
S0251	yes definitely it sound er quite an adventure doesn't it
S0252	yes i think one place which we have go on holiday be greece and i i think
S0251	yes
S0252	that would be quite tricky to do by rail because erm you're go through countries that don't really have a really impressive rail system
S0251	mm
S0252	i mean greece doesn't have such an impressive railway system
S0251	no
S0252	and bulgaria and
S0251	mm
S0252	er that sort of area but
S0251	mm
S0252	er just a bite
S0251	need more development
S0252	most of the some of the roll stock be sort of from the former soviet union so it's a bite
S0251	oh it be bite older
S0252	yes it's a bite older
S0251	mm
S0252	but apparently it can be do in three days
S0251	to where
S0252	to athens from london
S0251	oh right three days
S0252	yeah yes
S0251	mm
S0252	it's a bite of time that
S0251	yes
S0252	but it should improve because there's a a new line between and athens which should speed things up a bite
S0251	yes
S0252	i think they're try to erm invest in er public spend project in order to help the deficit in greece
S0251	oh the plan yes
S0252	to try and get people erm
S0251	in more work
S0252	back to work
S0251	yes yes
S0252	yes so the
S0251	that'll be good
S0252	it would have say that they be make improvements to the greek rail system because they be erm be now online you can book ticket online now which you
S0251	oh right
S0252	i couldn't do
S0251	yes
S0252	very long
S0251	very forward look yes
S0252	yes so i think that would help them because
S0251	mm
S0252	they have make some big losses erm in the past
S0251	mm you
S0252	years
S0251	mm say that she wasn't really interest on go on any more flight because she find it too tire now that she's get a bite older but er they've just get one holiday leave that's already book which be fly and they're go to israel
S0252	oh
S0251	so she's just a little bite
S0252	anxious
S0251	concern yes about how safe that be go to be
S0252	mm
S0251	they're go to fly and they're go for six days
S0252	yes
S0251	but they really want to go and look at bethlehem
S0252	yes
S0251	in particular erm but she doesn't know whether she's go to be disappoint when she see it because i think you possibly have a preconceive idea that it's go to look something like a christmas card and if it er be a situation that be a little bite tense in that country it might spoil your idea of what it look like and what it should be there potentially be a bite of a mismatch
S0252	mm i think in some ways they've pick the wrong time to go really because i think in the past few years the tensions between gaza and israel have not as be as heighten
S0251	mm
S0252	as they have in the last
S0251	well yes
S0252	six months
S0251	yes i suppose they've be wait until they've get retire and they've pick one or two other holiday they recently want to go to crete erm because that's where their father be fight during the war
S0252	yes
S0251	and what with the anniversary of the first world war come up they think it would probably be appropriate to go and walk in the footsteps of where he be in crete and er well not see what he have to contend with but just look at the countryside and they didn't tell us too much about what they actually find there do they
S0252	no
S0251	no they
S0252	i think he do survive so
S0251	yes he do survive yes he do get back
S0252	erm there wouldn't have be a a grave or anything to see
S0251	no no but there could have be some other landmarks or museums and
S0252	yes yes i think in some ways it would have be very emotional for them to think
S0251	it could yes
S0252	that erm a hundred years ago the
S0251	well it wasn't the first oh yes it be the second world war that he be fight in though wasn't it
S0252	oh be it
S0251	yes
S0252	oh right so that would have be
S0251	the thirty nine forty five war
S0252	the then it wouldn't be a hundred years
S0251	no i think it's the hundred years anniversary that just prompt them to think about it i think
S0252	i see oh
S0251	mm
S0252	yeah i it must be a surprise to think that that would have be the case
S0251	mm
S0252	but obviously er i think they'd have have a rather more enjoyable experience than the
S0251	i hope so definitely
S0252	her father
S0251	mm
S0252	er i don't suppose i suppose er on a the slightly positive side of it it i don't think it would have be as bad as the somme and that lot
S0251	mm no
S0252	i think it will have still have be very er emotional and er
S0251	definitely
S0252	a horrific experience
S0251	traumatic definitely
S0252	but so which erm area do he fight in be it army and navy or air force or
S0251	army i presume i think yes army i think
S0252	yes
S0251	yeah do you remember so you remember see him do you remember see
S0252	no
S0251	no
S0252	no
S0251	no
S0252	no i do not
S0251	you may be a bite young to remember him
S0252	yes but in some ways it's a a little shame that they didn't go when he be er alive
S0251	mm to take him back yeah to see him to see the place in a better light
S0252	yes
S0251	yeah
S0252	yes also he would have be able to tell them that that
S0251	yes
S0252	that footsteps
S0251	to point out the venues and that yeah you're right
S0252	yes
S0251	i think he be probably just glad to get away from it
S0252	yes
