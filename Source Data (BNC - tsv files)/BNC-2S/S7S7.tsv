S0115	never get them off
S0037	that's my fault
S0115	be it on
S0037	yeah i think i'd
S0115	just not press it it's a bite funny actually cos it's the sort of thing that you might humorously leave it on when you didn't realize and uh
S0037	well i might've do
S0115	and uh take it take it with you everywhere and stuff but uh
S0037	i'm sorry about that it's my
S0115	no that's that's fine uh
S0037	i just saw it blink out the corner of me eye and i be like whoop
S0115	yeah so it's like i'm gonna i'm gonna find some stuff about uh about easter but uh first of all i be just go through the axis of evil and uh uh
S0115	we find out that uh i find out that there wasn't just three in the axis of evil
S0037	ah i haven't hear this song for age
S0115	well the the original axis of evil be three but there actually be beyond the axis of evil that's another three and there be outposts of tyranny um
S0037	there's like an it's oh my goodness
S0115	and uh so they
S0037	like yemen be yemen an outpost of
S0115	no it's not it's not part of the nine um
S0037	i'm surprise
S0115	the axis of the axis of evil describe by george bush be iran iraq and north korea uh this article's place iraq
S0037	but iran haven't do anything what's iran do
S0115	it's place iraq first north korea second and iran third like they're all in order like
S0037	what's iran do though
S0115	uh it's it annoy israel a lot by by fund um group like hezbollah which attack israel
S0037	mhm
S0115	um it uh it the the main the official excuse be that it uh the the the official excuse that the government use be that it's uh it's develop nuclear weapons
S0037	yeah
S0115	um
S0037	but they don't know that though surely
S0115	and uh it have some nuclear facilities in there i think it already have some um it already it already have nuclear power i think
S0037	yeah
S0115	but it but it's uh you know people like america and israel be say that it be gonna develop nuclear nuclear weapons but i personally don't think even if it have them it would use them uh other than as a as a as a a a deterrent sort of thing
S0037	bomb yeah
S0115	um so personally no i i'm not a
S0037	but you can't tell other people
S0115	i'm quite anti war so i'm not in favour of
S0037	you can't tell other people not to have nuclear weapons if you have nuclear weapons like that's just obvious
S0115	well yeah i mean obviously america have a very large number of nuclear weapons uh isreal have a lot of nuclear weapons uh pakistan have a have some nuclear weapons india have as well i mean so there's there's quite a few of them in the in the sort of middle eastern area
S0037	yeah
S0115	they have them i mean but if you look at iran you've gotta understand it's uh it's geography actually
S0037	yeah
S0115	it's a very big country it's actually bigger than um i think it's bigger then england france and italy combine
S0037	really
S0115	and and its landmass be very large
S0037	i never really think about
S0115	it's it's yeah cos you've gotta look at it geostrategically like um
S0037	yeah
S0115	it's a it's a strategically quite an important place um it it's
S0037	i just wish it wasn't so war tear and like i mean obviously iran's not
S0115	that that that area's in a terrible mess isn't it
S0037	but i mean the area i mean it would be so nice to go there there's so much stuff there
S0115	well it's it's it's one of the world's oldest continuously inhabit areas isn't it it's part of the cradle of civilization
S0037	yeah gulf of the cradle of that's right
S0115	crescent whatever it be
S0037	crescent that's what i be try to say
S0115	uh sound like a good version of the uh the axis of evil it they should've it should've be like they could have use the word crescent as well because have a really islamophobia in it as well so it could be like the the crescent of sin or something or
S0037	yeah yeah yeah
S0115	the uh the crescent of of destruction or something
S0037	no i like the crescent of destruction
S0115	um so yeah if you iran be a massive country and also it's get quite a big economy which be forecast to grow like a lot of people reckon that it's gonna become uh one of the bigger new economies like uh bite like turkey and mexico and stuff
S0037	yeah
S0115	um that area's really in a big problem with tribal conflict and uh opium in afghanistan um
S0037	yeah
S0115	areas like that where there's that much sort of tribal problems tend to have dictators in them who who um like saddam hussain
S0037	yeah
S0115	um assad from syria uh syria instead be be in the beyond the axis of evil trio alongside cuba and libya
S0037	that's like the that's like the championship not the premier league
S0115	this be like the championship the championship be cuba libya and syria uh obviously libya's now gonna be change uh it's get a different flag and everything uh then and the the division one be uh third third division
S0037	yeah
S0115	be outposts of tyranny
S0037	outposts of tyranny that sound like a cocktail
S0115	that's um i'd like to have it uh
S0037	what would be in a outpost of tyranny
S0115	it's it's it's it's it's one part belarus two part zimbabwe and three part uh myanmar or burma um so um they're
S0037	maybe we should put something on that's a bite more like us
S0115	what what's wrong with this be rui da silva
S0037	yeah i know but
S0115	touch me from the album touch me
S0037	d'you know what it's touch me in the morning that one last thing at night d'you know it
S0115	no um
S0037	it's from like when i be at school
S0115	right um so
S0037	it remind us of like go to like chamber it's this nightclub in sunderland
S0115	right
S0037	like they just actively encourage underaged people to go in cos obviously anyone who could get in anywhere else wouldn't go there cos it be horrible
S0115	there's some horrible place in sunderland aren't there
S0037	and they use to sell they yes they use to sell bottle of red pig
S0115	mind you
S0037	this drink call red pig for seventy p
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	oh and it's horrible they just get everywhere then there'd just be like purple splat of vomit outside on the pavement like
S0115	oh right uh yeah i mean well well i think i suppose that that's just something that that that you know kid do isn't it though they they go through that that phase you know maybe when they're at college or something and they uh they just sort of go round you know go mad and discover uh discover alcohol and um uh
S0037	yeah yeah i know
S0115	and sort of but they're throw up because because the stomach like aren't use to the alcohol so they just throw up everything
S0037	but like all of the all of the boys use to have like load of horrible aftershave on and like
S0115	yeah
S0037	those ben sherman shirt and
S0115	well that's part of the whole like as as you get from watch inbetweeners isn't it
S0037	and like i would go out full on dress up not like now when i just wander down the pub in whatever i happen to be wear you know
S0115	oh yeah yeah we we we're quite sort of casual
S0037	cardigans and little shoe and that
S0115	how do we get from axis of evil to uh to drink
S0037	sorry i just i just ask about
S0115	no yeah it be cocktails you say you say axis of evil that remind me of a cocktail
S0037	no i say it should be a cocktail and then no then i be talk about this
S0115	outposts of tyranny
S0037	i'll turn it d'you want us to put like kerrang on or something
S0115	um whatever you want
S0037	or should we just leave it no we're alright we'll just leave it it's like a saturday party
S0115	well uh yeah um oh yeah so about so about so iran i be say like it's really mountainous and apparently although a lot of people be talk about invade it a lot of american uh hawkish people
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh be talk about invade it uh
S0037	oh excuse me
S0115	apparently it's it's not um
S0037	invadable
S0115	it's not a place that you could feasibly conquer and hold um you just couldn't couldn't hold it because of the because of the mountainousness it be it's really difficult to invade um only a few people have successfully conquer iran i think
S0037	yeah
S0115	um uh and it to hold it you you wouldn't really be able to to um to hold it because there'd just be too many people who'd come come out from the mountains and and
S0037	yeah tribes
S0115	yeah i think uh it's similar to afghanistan and i think afghanistan have pretty much demonstrate the problems of of fight in that tribal mountainous environment like uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	you you really don't have the you don't have the can't please the people in the in the in the in the in the mountains
S0037	yeah
S0115	you might be able to please the city people in kabul but you can't uh can't you can't tame the uh the tribes very easily
S0037	no
S0115	they just just don't like um
S0037	you can't reach them can you i mean
S0115	yeah it's very it's a very difficult environment to fight in i mean i mean the all the sort of um the militias that be go around and
S0037	d'you remember this one
S0115	no i don't 9pm till i come
S0037	you know it go
S0115	be it
S0037	yeah
S0115	it's like a different remix of that though isn't it
S0037	it's like from nineteen ninety five or something
S0115	oh right well i think this be a different remix isn't it what do that say viva channel viva freddie
S0037	listen
S0115	oh yeah yeah feddie le grand
S0037	this really remind us it's it's freddie le grand who apparently
S0115	it say feddie in this though

S0115	feddie le grand's top fifty dance number ones
S0037	he's a dutch he's a dutch dance dj
S0115	well that's that's just i can imagine him sort of uh holland be really the centre of europop i suppose isn't it
S0037	i dunno if this really classify as europop but yes
S0115	no yeah yeah
S0037	um but yes i agree
S0115	euro euro club
S0037	yeah
S0115	but uh
S0037	so
S0115	you've be to a euro club haven't you in switzerland
S0037	i have be to a euro club it be very unusual
S0115	oh really well uh i i i feel in some ways perhaps i'm too old but i would like to go to a euro club and uh
S0037	would you with a white suit
S0115	yeah be it be it be it it hasn't die have it
S0037	no no ooh no it's fine and wear like a white suit
S0115	yeah so that we don't wanna be go on for like half an hour and find that that's
S0037	well we'd just be talk anyway let's be honest
S0115	yeah i mean uh you know may as well just yeah what be you say a white suit be a lot of a lot of people wear white suit be there
S0037	there be a number of people in like a white like jeans and like a white jacket
S0115	ah like miami vice sort of style
S0037	exactly like miami vice sort of style
S0115	kinda that's just like fresh off fresh off the yacht
S0037	in fact that sum up that sum it up very well
S0115	come off the yacht be you in a place near a lake that might've have like yacht on it
S0037	um actually yes i mean it be in austria so it be very near lake constance you know
S0115	oh right so you actually go across the border
S0037	well it be just like
S0115	go to the club in a different country and then drive back
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	that's pretty good to go club in another country and then come back
S0037	yeah but it wasn't really it be like it's like us just go down the bottom of the road like
S0115	do he drive
S0037	yeah
S0115	you back
S0037	yeah
S0115	that's a bite strange though it feel weird go to a club and then sort of drive home across the border on the way back
S0037	yeah i know i think that as well everyone do the club be in the middle of nowhere
S0115	but like
S0037	it be like off a junction off a motorway
S0115	but
S0037	like you couldn't get there unless you'd drive
S0115	can you not even you can't even have like more than one drink or something
S0037	no no
S0115	i don't think i could do that sort of thing personally
S0037	well i do i have more drink obviously
S0115	have to get a taxi but like through through through the alps
S0037	no no you could like it be yeah exactly
S0115	alpine taxis
S0037	ski home or something no it be uh
S0115	just walk home
S0037	no it wasn't next to anything it literally be like on a industrial estate
S0115	it would be a great place to uh to go i think we'd have to go to austria some time
S0037	yeah well i mean i didn't really see very much of it i only saw that tiny like tiny bottom corner like that
S0115	i remember my school say that they they have their ski trip to austria cos they be the friendliest of the uh the nations that uh yeah
S0037	yeah ski countries well there's a lot of newer ones though isn't there like you can ski in bulgaria and stuff now
S0115	have it go i think of um as i be say about austria and um austria and czech republic be that be that you've gotta think of them kind of as southeast germany yeah like
S0037	croatia uh czech republic and stuff
S0115	like they be they really be kind of part of germany like
S0037	yeah
S0115	there be load of german people in in those you know course germany wasn't originally like one single country be it
S0037	look feddie whoever he be
S0115	but yeah there be load of german people in there in in bohemia and place
S0037	oh this be a good one
S0115	oh yeah this be bonkers uh by
S0037	this remind me of when we first move into our flat in lancaster
S0115	yeah i remember you have i know i originally start listen to it actually uh even earlier than that before like it before it be release i think because uh uh so it be on youtube but i wasn't listen to uh uh i search for him on youtube um for some reason i think it be because i hear i find out that there be this type of music that i'd never hear of that be call grime and uh
S0037	yeah it be cos we go to that thing in furness
S0115	i'd never hear of grime and then there be all sort of different type like grimecore uh
S0037	it's because we go to that thing in furness d'you remember
S0115	yeah yeah it be like a drum and bass party i really didn't know much about
S0037	and grime grime party
S0115	so grime be basically a cross between rap and uh rap and drum and bass i suppose it's like a london urban sort of thing isn't it
S0037	yeah mr rascal that always remind me of that
S0115	this this this isn't grime though this be this be really kind of poppy dance isn't it
S0037	it remind me of that like jeremy paxman interview
S0115	oh yeah when he interview yeah jeremy paxman interview dizzee rascal and and address him as mr rascal which be uh extremely funny i think uh but it be quite a nice interview i mean i think it go like dizzee wasn't uh
S0037	be too naughty
S0115	like wasn't that offend by the fact that paxman be maybe talk down to him but yeah address him as mister i mean that it's just it's very funny um mean this remind me of the summer and uh sort of
S0037	yeah
S0115	um quite good effect you've get like a three hundred and sixty degree camera thing go on there one of those cameras that's sort of like a total panorama
S0037	oh yeah i like this bite
S0115	um right so i be what i be do about uh suppose to be about easter wasn't it

S0115	ah well all all all of the time i've just uh it's uh it's come up obviously the eighth of april for us but for the eastern church it will be the fifteenth the the sunday after
S0037	yeah
S0115	um they say religious service um it it they have you have like a festival family meals family meals uh easter egg hunt and gift give um and you're suppose to have like all night vigils and sunrise service
S0037	oh yeah i know i saw on that leaflet that come through the door from the church that there's like a five be thing light the easter fire or something
S0115	yeah here's something that i be interest in it's the sort of comparative religions uh it's relate to passover
S0037	mhm
S0115	it's consider the uh christian equivalent of passover it's also relate to a whole load of other stuff uh include septuagesima sexagesima oh septuagesima and another one call sexagemina and then one call quinquagesima
S0037	what what be these gesima ones
S0115	um shrive tuesday ash wednesday clean monday lend great lend
S0037	greater lend
S0115	there's a great lend as well as the ordinary lend
S0037	ah it's obviously better than normal lend
S0115	what's it's like i can see they're count quinque five sexa septua that's seven
S0037	right ow ah me little toe's hurt that i've bash
S0115	so if i look at quinquegesima be um the sunday before ash wednesday um also call shrive sunday uh and then sexagesima be like the um the second sunday before ash wednesday oh right fair enough
S0037	so when's ash wednesday
S0115	well simply simply put it's after pancake day isn't it
S0037	alright so we've have it
S0115	lend follow doesn't it and then lend end um at easter doesn't it
S0037	easter sunday
S0115	great lend be um and just to clear up we've get palm sunday so if lend end at palm sunday or if lend end at easter
S0037	yeah what's what's the difference
S0115	well between what
S0037	be they not the same thing
S0115	no palm sunday's the sunday before
S0037	oh
S0115	easter sunday
S0037	ah right this sunday tomorrow
S0115	yeah so tomorrow will be will be palm sunday
S0037	what do that mean
S0115	uh it's the day it commemorate when jesus uh ride in ride into jerusalem on a donkey which didn't have a cross shave in its back
S0037	what go down the palm yes it do
S0115	uh like with uh
S0037	what be the palm about then
S0115	he get he rid in he rid into jerusalem on a donkey
S0037	ah do they put it down on his feet cos he's tire
S0115	they put palm palm um to welcome him in they put palm and their clothe on the grind for him to for his donkey to walk over
S0037	why be the donkey tire
S0115	i think it's just a sign of respect like like a path like a bite like a red carpet
S0037	ah red carpet yeah
S0115	hold on um i'll i'll read that cos i might be totally wrong but uh great lend ooh there's a picture of a czech republic church there
S0037	which one peter and paul
S0115	it's just inside i don't know uh great lend or the great fast be the most important fast season in the church year in eastern christianity they prey as christians for the greatest feast of the church year which be pascha easter it's similar to the western lend i think great lend be merely an eastern version of
S0037	i see
S0115	our lend western lend
S0037	but better
S0115	um they have some differences of time in um um right so yeah lend i think it start on ash wednesday doesn't it
S0037	yeah
S0115	um uh lend be call quadragesima mean fortieth uh be uh it's about six weeks lead up to easter run from ash wednesday to maundy thursday
S0037	aha
S0115	in um western most western uh denominations or to easter eve which presumably be easter saturday um it's a penitential preparation well it's uh okay so you've get you've get shrive tuesday ash wednesday lend maundy thursday
S0037	yeah
S0115	lead up to um
S0037	what do it say about
S0115	easter so what i be interest in be the the comparative religion of it oh i like this one
S0037	it's a bite stupid
S0115	easter come from
S0037	maybe we should turn it down a bite
S0115	i think it's alright uh jesus rise from the dead obviously
S0115	some say he resurrect in ad twenty six some say ad thirty six and some say in between
S0037	hang on jesus
S0115	yeah
S0037	i think it be the next day
S0115	no ad twenty six the year talk about the year that it happen
S0037	how old he be you mean
S0115	i'm talk about what year it be suppose to have happen
S0037	like how old he be
S0115	well not not his age but the the year it occur he
S0037	yeah but it be if we're start from bc
S0115	um yeah but you see if they say if they say twenty six then
S0037	that mean he's twenty six
S0115	i don't know if it do i
S0037	well what else can it mean
S0115	not sure um you're assume that he be definitely bear in ad
S0037	well that's
S0115	but not every church maybe believe that he be bear in what we call in ad zero you know what i mean
S0037	well i don't even believe he be bear full stop so
S0115	ad we we might say like there be no year zero be there but it be like it go from b one bc to one ad and then the ad the bc ad changeover as uh eddie izzard call it
S0037	yeah
S0115	but obviously that be write you know after the fact wasn't it so
S0037	yeah
S0115	um so uh well anyway um um the last week of lend be holy week that's the one that's the week that we're gonna get next week um it's follow by a fifty day period call easter tide
S0037	yeah
S0115	end with pentecost sunday um obviously it move first council of nicaea three twenty five establish it as be the first sunday after the full moon
S0037	right
S0115	follow the northern
S0037	be that why easter change then
S0115	follow the northern hemisphere's vernal equinox which be twenty first of march
S0037	that's that's why easter change its day then
S0115	yeah it's the first sunday after the full moon follow the equinox which be the twenty first of march
S0037	clock forward yeah
S0115	uh
S0115	yeah so it it be actually twentieth of march this year and at precisely five fourteen be uh
S0037	right think i be asleep
S0115	uh
S0037	nevermind
S0115	it's the it's the tilt of the earth's access be incline
S0037	d'you think i've make that wide enough
S0115	it's when we're align like we're neither tilt towards or away from the sun we're like perfectly
S0037	face it
S0115	um level
S0037	d'you think these be gonna look stupid
S0115	it's possibly bigger than i think uh i think you be just tie a piece of string with some hole in the side
S0037	no it's a pot warmer
S0115	ah um
S0037	it's a pot warmer and then it have a loop at the top like that
S0115	like i'd have think like you'd probably just drill a couple of hole in the side of the pot and then tie a string and hang that from a hook
S0037	but where's the bonniness in that
S0115	bonny
S0037	where's the beauty in that
S0115	yeah but like it's just it's a it's a functional plant man
S0037	no no no
S0115	it isn't beauty
S0037	but you've gotta make things look
S0115	um i'm i'm a bite functional you know
S0037	well yeah i'm about function too but it may as well if you've just get like a crappy pot and you just drill a hole in and tie a twine round that's no fun like it just look like
S0115	oh right
S0037	there's gotta be something about make it look nice isn't there or be you not bother
S0115	fair enough
S0037	ah no but i
S0115	uh because if that's what you you know it's a hobby isn't it so
S0037	appearances aren't important
S0115	oh yeah i say that didn't i
S0037	um no

S0115	some people just like you know just like um remember if you think about all these like donor you know sperm donors and that like if you go round look for a if you if you want to to to um to take you know from a from a donor
S0037	will you do it be a sperm donor
S0115	um i don't think so because i think uh um i think i i um i like you you know um i'm a bite sort of i don't know if i'm good enough but uh
S0037	ah don't be silly
S0115	that's just
S0037	i think it's a bite of a weird thing but i think it's a good thing that people do it i mean if they want to but
S0115	no no i think it's it's it's great i mean if if people want to but but yeah if you look at the way that that sort of culture work i mean it be very appearance and also mental um feature as well isn't it like they they do the the the the fact of the matter be it's there be a lot of genetic factor in in life aren't there so
S0037	oh you mean choose a sperm donor yeah but also you just don't know what which ones be gonna be express like it's all very well say i want someone who's tall dark and handsome and and brain surgeon and a triathlete but equally they could have genes for like stupidness or like laziness or you just don't know not all the ones that they have be will be express
S0115	yeah yeah it it at the at the moment it's very hard to predict isn't it um
S0037	well the
S0115	success of uh you know it's very hard to to predict that you know if someone have if you have a successful father or mother you know it really doesn't it really doesn't guarantee that you'll be successful but neither be it a guarantee i think if you have good look parent i mean even then it's still not totally guarantee that that they way that their jeans will merge together will create a good look child

S0115	hold on so where be i on this um
S0037	i sort of like can't remember what it be like when before we have a smartphone like
S0115	ecclesiastically they reckon march twenty first be the equinox even though astronomically speak it's actually the twentieth of march and the full moon isn't necessarily the correct date either uh
S0115	uh but it easter vary between uh march twenty second
S0037	mhm
S0115	uh it can't be on march twenty first cos it have to be the first it have to be sunday after
S0037	yeah
S0115	the full
S0037	so you gonna get your mam to come over on her birthday
S0115	so it's gonna be it have to be it have to be sunday after a full moon follow the equinox i guess that mean it's impossible for it to occur on the twenty first it have to occur at least the twenty second till could be as late as uh april twenty fifth um
S0037	be your mam gonna come on her birthday
S0115	but in the eastern church um yeah maybe uh we'll have to get in touch um get in touch and um
S0037	i don't mind you know she can come whenever
S0115	but uh we'll do some more record with them um
S0037	sorry
S0115	could record them again
S0037	yeah
S0115	um eastern christianity put a slightly different date um so they they go between april the fifth and may the eighth
S0037	mhm
S0115	right it's link to passover this be quite interest uh while much of the symbolism as well as its calendar position
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh a lot of them have similar word to passover in these languages uh um
S0037	i really like the cadbury's creme egg as well like and i think i still would like a really big one of those just fill with all that goo
S0115	you what a big a massive a giant creme egg
S0037	the size of my face in fact of my face like chocolate mould to it so it look like my face and then when you thank you
S0115	that really would be quite bite that would be big
S0037	and then when you crack it head open and you bite like the ear off like it would just be cadbury's creme egg insides
S0115	would you want it to look like your face then
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	i find that a bite disturb
S0037	i'd get i'd get a um
S0115	just eat your face
S0037	i'd get you know those bandage that you see those bandage and i'd make a mould of me face then i'd fill it with chocolate and then it would be the shape of me face then i'd make another half like with the back of me head and then yeah i think that's a good idea
S0115	and the the creme inside what what will that be make of
S0037	yeah cadbury's creme egg cream
S0115	basically sort of ice sugar
S0037	it's like a fondant isn't it
S0115	bite of vanilla and
S0037	yeah
S0115	boil with water
S0037	with yellow colour
S0115	oh yeah yeah for the yolk
S0037	maybe with some chocolate chunk in for like brain piece or some jelly sweets
S0115	oh right so now you're go to into the horror sweets genre

S0115	it's yolanda b cool and
S0037	d cup
S0115	d cup
S0037	yeah it's like an italian film he's eat the spaghetti at the end isn't he
S0115	and there's a um it say here that god have give christians into a live hope through the resurrection
S0037	oh yeah little fly i don't want all the christian things
S0115	oh no i'm just i'm just read you know
S0037	i hate all that sort of stuff
S0115	it's link to passover and exodus from egypt um through the last supper and crucifixion accord to new testament jesus give the passover meal a new mean um um
S0115	um
S0037	what's she do carry that massive heart around
S0115	um they have unleavened bread don't they
S0037	at the passover
S0115	yeah and also um at the communion
S0037	oh yeah be they not like wafers at the communion thing
S0115	yeah well it's not it's not get yeast in it have it
S0037	right
S0115	um jesus be compare to the passover lamb uh we be gonna get a leg of lamb actually
S0037	oh one day i'll get that leg of lamb
S0037	the one that i have before be really nice but be really unappreciated
S0115	and they slay the lamb in the temple they like to slay a lamb don't they in the mediterranean we saw that on uh
S0037	oh yeah that be a be that not a goat
S0115	there be a it be a programme where you you you take a fat person and send them over to uh
S0037	even fatter people
S0115	to to some other fat people in in um it's cyprus i think it be actually or crete
S0037	be it oh that's right
S0115	be it cyprus or crete
S0037	it be crete
S0115	and um which be very near jerusalem actually and uh israel isn't uh
S0037	um
S0115	and in in crete you know and in a lot of the mediterranean like whey they have a visitor they slaughter one of the lamb
S0037	yeah
S0115	um in the traditional cut throat style and then cook that and uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	that's something that i think they do at passover um in the temple
S0037	lamb be tasty i'd much like i obviously we don't have it very often but i like it better than like turkey and that
S0115	the scriptural instructions say the lamb be to be slay between the two even
S0037	like at christmas i'd much rather have lamb than have than have turkey
S0115	well ah right well you know we'll have to get some uh a leg
S0037	i know your mam always want all the trimmings in
S0115	you can get a leg for if you get a leg for twelve quid in aldi
S0037	all the trimmings that's what she want
S0115	twelve twelve quid in aldi you can get a leg of lamb
S0037	yeah
S0115	then you gotta you gotta do it right though you know you can't just like
S0037	i know you slow cook it
S0115	can't just stuff it in the oven and uh hope for the best you know you've gotta like
S0037	give it some love care yeah
S0115	i mean you've gotta prepare them and i mean depend on what sort of thing you would do i suppose obviously if it's a leg of lamb we're presumably gonna be roast it aren't you so
S0037	yeah with like
S0115	um
S0037	well that that one we do last time be really nice like it be just a bite unappreciated i think a moroccan sort of one
S0115	um it's just i'm think difficult to like to like actually slaughter a lamb i think it
S0037	ignore us no it wouldn't same as anything
S0115	depend how you do it i suppose doesn't it
S0037	do you not just like
S0115	cos if you do it like in a you know like a like a pellet in in in the head
S0037	no they just cut their throat
S0115	well yeah no i'm say that would be harder for me than than than a pellet base you know
S0037	yeah
S0115	pellet base method
S0037	yeah but if you breed lamb
S0115	sorry i ignore the
S0037	you do yeah
S0115	what do you say
S0037	um who what do i say uh oh i can't remember mustn't have be important
S0115	right
S0037	um something about lamb i can't remember
S0115	right and um
S0115	right so yeah i be just say no i think it would be would be fairly hard to to to like slaughter an animal in that in that way but um but i guess everyone it's very popular in uh
S0037	ooh wonder what that be
S0115	it's very popular in uh sort of you know mid eastern mediterranean
S0037	be there some post
S0115	it's a paper
S0037	ooh what be it
S0115	it be the
S0037	oh what's be happen in the
S0115	which be the which be the uh liberal democrat
S0037	aw
S0115	uh the liberal democrat newspaper
S0037	think it be gonna be like
S0115	there's a picture of uh of uh our mp
S0037	
S0115	be that his name
S0037	oh what's he do
S0115	be the recorder still go be it work
S0037	yeah
S0115	i'll probably uh probably go to the shop in a you know in a bite
S0037	yeah i'll just finish this piece
S0115	um hold on you see quite a big beard there uh there's a guy with a beard say save our libraries
S0037	which bite like be it
S0115	hold on so the main headline be libdems deliver railway station
S0037	oh yeah one
S0115	um good benefit but yeah side action be need to make sure the access road be up to scratch
S0037	yeah it's in it's in ten years time or something though it's not like next week
S0115	i be wander if the liberal democrats gonna get quite badly punish in uh the elections
S0037	well the local elections be they this week or next week or
S0115	i don't know d'you i suspect liberal i suspect there may be a swing a swing from libdem to to labour but um
S0037	i think i ask a postal vote for both of us so
S0115	alright fair enough um
S0037	although i can't really remember
S0115	ooh there's look very serious
S0037	oh what's he do now
S0115	with his he's hold up a little flyer say worst bus cut in the country exclamation mark
S0037	
S0115	put it say put a hundred k into help youth into work
S0037	yeah
S0115	liberals want to spend the councillors' pay rise money on free youth transport to address the council cut last year uh they've call for uh the hundred grand that uh tories be plan to use plan to use hundred grand as pay rise for themselves
S0037	but a hundred grand's not gonna go very far be it
S0115	to be spend in on transport to get young people into work um to provide free public transport to help young people age sixteen to nineteen
S0037	yeah
S0115	sound quite a good idea to make it free uh
S0115	they've get a list of proposals that labour didn't support uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	include eighty grand a year investment in youth and community engagement officer i don't know what uh community engagement officer be forty six grand to improve recycle rat
S0037	right
S0115	and sixteen grand a year to support road
S0037	what that they didn't improve i don't understand like so labour didn't support it and then they be do anyway or what
S0115	i dunno
S0037	right
S0115	doesn't say whether it actually happen or not uh when it say support road i mean be they be they be they sort of how be they
S0037	do it mean the commerce
S0115	be they subsidize um some businesses or or cos they be talk about you know politics be always annoy isn't it cos it's often like
S0037	yeah
S0115	there's often sort of two side to everything and then it become hard to to decide what to do because you cos you tend to get two side and you tend to get the people group themselves in two side and you tend to get like a a one group of say i want a big tesco in this road
S0037	yeah
S0115	another group of people say um i don't well i don't i don't because um i'm a small business and i'm gonna get i'm gonna be put out of business by this big tesco so you've get like one group of people say one thing another group of people say another and it's basically like politics be essentially sort of somehow mediate
S0037	yeah
S0115	between them where it be effectively take side uh
S0037	i've nearly finish me uh
S0115	um maybe compromise uh you know make a compromise but
S0037	yeah
S0115	cos obviously there's certain advantage you know if you have a big tesco you know whatever that uh have an advantage that um you may get cheaper price than the smaller local ones
S0037	yeah but i don't think tesco's that cheap
S0115	no well i mean or sainsbury's whatever but they they do have some of the i think some of the own brand uh stuff be cheap but
S0037	yeah
S0115	um apprentice a success story it say uh um city council's celebrate the uh success of its apprenticeship scheme which uh
S0037	aha
S0115	uh eight young people achieve qualifications
S0037	what be they do what type of apprenticeships
S0115	there's the halfords picture of uh in halfords there um
S0037	uhh well i suppose it's it's like he it's obvious his face be gonna be on there if that's the libdem thing
S0115	his face be everywhere he's in almost every picture
S0115	in a variety of different pose different look
S0037	oh dear
S0115	there's one on the bottom where he look really sort of proud he's proudly hold a piece of paper
S0037	right
S0115	in a crowd who be also hold piece of paper the headline for that one be county tories put new council tax up bracket and stash away some for themselves
S0037	uhuh
S0115	um conservatives on the county council have put your council tax up and set aside a hundred thousand of it as a pay rise for themselves
S0037	oh for their yeah
S0115	um libdems run the city council have freeze council tax that be actually because of uh like conservatives want to give it yeah want to take some more money and give it to the party
S0037	yeah
S0115	whereas the democrats didn't want to take an um um hold on um
S0037	this song's quite recent i think
S0115	there's so the so we've get like the city council say one thing um
S0037	yeah
S0115	which be liberal democrat and we have like we have the county council's conservative um uh freeze council tax apparently but you be say that our council tax have in fact go up
S0037	yeah i know like they say
S0115	or be that in the inflation
S0037	on the thing it say like oh it's go down by so many percent and then but then on the but then the payment's more so how can it be cos like last year they be pay a hundred and twenty eight and this year we're pay a hundred and thirty five first and then a hundred and thirty unless i pay more at the start last year or something
S0115	libdems on the county council launch a campaign against pay rise for the council the petition which be like they be hold um gain three thousand signatures um
S0037	they shouldn't be have any pay rise although actually do county do county councillors have other job
S0115	the county council actually be be opposite the castle hill isn't it
S0037	yeah but do the councillors have like day job or be they full time councillors
S0115	i dunno it depend like a lot of civil servants and might be the management
S0037	yeah but i just
S0115	i dunno it depend like some of them might simply be party members of
S0037	yeah
S0115	interfere in uh
S0037	no i be just wonder
S0115	oh i don't know um it look like our campaign to freeze allowance have win out this serve the tories right say county councillor
S0037	aha killian that's a funny name
S0115	uh
S0037	hey d'you think we should go to the shop then before it get too late
S0115	yeah we we should uh try to give themselves a twenty percent
S0037	okay well i'll just
S0115	you'd think i i don't think in in in a time of cut you can't really have a pay rise can you cos
S0037	i'll just finish this bite and then not really okay
S0115	everyone else be feel the pinch can you turn it off
