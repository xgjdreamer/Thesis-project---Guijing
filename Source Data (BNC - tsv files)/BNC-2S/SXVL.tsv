S0115	yeah i've get avocado there
S0037	it's like it be quite cold outside actually i think it's like i've be lull into a false sense of security because it's be so warm
S0115	yeah
S0037	like over the past few days like really hot and that
S0115	yeah it come it come at you
S0037	eh
S0115	it come at you the cold

S0115	d'you wanna tea or a beer
S0037	uh tea uh yeah beer actually i'm not that i'm not as cold as i be before so i think i've finish this now i'll just tie the last bits in
S0115	just put it on the bar um
S0115	the bar which be could be the world's smallest bar would be like uh
S0037	d'you remember the last time we be away d'you remember when we saw
S0115	it's it's like ten centimetres wide
S0037	d'you remember the last time we be away we when we saw that world's smallest bar
S0115	oh yeah that be um i dunno i i saw a tiny one in in northfield birmingham once uh it be like someone's house
S0037	yeah
S0115	you know like the pub be like the house but the bar be it be very small and very unusual actually i mean there be some there be some interest pubs you know uh hide away like uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	sometimes go into a pub and you think this be like the most bizarre pub like
S0037	what's the pub you've ever be to
S0115	but the the one we go to uh on holiday be uh um
S0037	what's the best pub
S0115	cos the the place look quite posh from outside but
S0037	yeah
S0115	there be like a there be like a reserve table like someone have reserve it but but it be actually quite empty inside
S0037	what's the best pub that you've ever be to
S0115	well i be i think i've say this before actually uh
S0037	oh the berlin one
S0115	it's the it be the student one in um hall of residence in berlin uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	because of the i mean you could run the bar yourself um
S0037	that's pretty good
S0115	but you could you could you write your name down and you get a partner and you and you and the partner um when when
S0037	when it's your turn
S0115	you book you book a a night
S0037	yeah
S0115	and i think it be pretty much any night of the week or or be it just the sunday i can't remember um
S0037	do you do it then
S0115	you book a night
S0037	yeah
S0115	and uh no i never do it um
S0037	why
S0115	you could keep some of the profit like uh
S0037	you shoulda do it
S0115	i know but i didn't uh i just didn't un didn't
S0037	prefer to be on the other side of the bar
S0115	didn't
S0115	yeah i mean well that's the thing i mean obviously there there be always an element like you can you could kind of i think the what i like about that bar be just the sort of freeness of it like
S0037	yeah
S0115	the pool be the pool and uh you know table football be free and um
S0037	i hate when you have to pay for that sort that sort of stuff
S0115	the the music you could play your own you could bring your own cds to play i mean it's just it be just like a it be
S0037	someone's house
S0115	and it be quite cheap as well i mean a bottle of it would've be like one euro fifty for
S0037	yeah
S0115	that's like in those days be a pound um and these days it's more like one one forty or something isn't it
S0037	yeah
S0115	but like yeah it be eins fuenfzig for uh um ein ein euro fuenfzig for uh for like a like a bottle of um
S0037	yeah
S0115	cos they didn't have draft they it be just bottle and stuff like uh
S0037	what do you think
S0115	it's interest
S0037	d'you think i shoulda make the strap longer
S0115	like a little uh uh but gotta be careful that it will stay in place like when it's when it's get load of soil in
S0037	well i be gonna
S0115	so could get like theo paphitis on dragon's den and like try and wreck try and wreck it
S0037	ah don't snap it stop it matt
S0115	sorry no i'm sorry i drop it
S0037	i be gonna i be gonna
S0115	um
S0037	d'you think i should've make the strap longer
S0115	it will have to be able to withstand quite a lot of weight um so hopefully you can
S0037	d'you think i should've make the strap longer
S0115	um uh oh yeah like the plant's not gonna fit be it
S0037	yeah
S0115	but you've already get like
S0037	i'll just redo that bite

S0115	have schmouthern schmumfort
S0037	so i decide to get nice juice i decide to get nice juice like rather than the concentrate one it's the same price you know
S0115	i still didn't even realise there be a difference until you mention it
S0037	well i just watch a thing about it and they be say like if it's from concentrate it's just like dilute juice nearly it's the same
S0115	they be pulp up i'm think the drink makers you know they like to they like to use cos they're cheaper to
S0037	make sense
S0115	a bite of this uh that starch
S0037	hey oh

S0115	sometimes
S0037	okay
S0115	no i mean i be try to be i be try to say the sort of thing that you would say
S0037	i think you be trivialize my um like for a stupid date show
S0115	no it's just like you can't uh it's be replace with um something i don't watch and um yeah
S0037	britain's get talent
S0115	yeah
S0037	it might be good though cos it's the early stag you know what i mean
S0115	uh the freak show stage
S0037	the freak show stage
S0115	no i'm not not a big fan of that actually but this the voice seem better
S0037	i don't understand the i i mean i understand part of it but i don't know how like them people get on the show in the first place
S0115	i quite like it tepid actually
S0037	ooh it doesn't need to be like totally boil not uh i just think it be a bite bite cold i'll have my sausage later on that i have leave i totally forget about it
S0115	uh recyclable
S0037	oh leave it cos i'll put some seedlings in

S0037	purple broccoli um sweet genovese basil
S0115	right
S0037	autumn king carrots and white lisbon spring onions
S0115	they put like the
S0037	so the idea with these i think i be read something earlier be that you keep sow them like you do them every two weeks
S0115	yeah
S0037	and then you have them all the time
S0115	yeah
S0037	sow thinly in row ten inch apart cover with half inch of soil
S0037	okay i like spring onions as well carrots
S0115	oh yeah uh you know the shallots what be they call um scallions
S0037	scallions aha carrots i dunno where we're gonna put all these
S0115	yeah so this orange juice be good innit unfortunately i think i've have a bite too much of it
S0037	what sorry
S0115	i've have a bite too much orange juice
S0037	put a bite more lemon in then i always think that orange juice be too too much like i always nearly nearly often nearly always when i have like fresh orange juice i i slosh a bite of water in the top cos i think it's a bite heavy
S0115	oh yeah
S0037	oh there's some really good ones
S0115	on the topic of do things ourselves it'd be good to do um yeah i be think of what be it i be gonna try and make oh yeah i be try to make um like a fizzy drink
S0037	so which should we grow
S0115	and i be think about like if i want to make like my own coca cola type thing
S0037	yeah
S0115	and how i would do that like so i be gonna get a sodastream make a syrup get the water get a soda stream and hop that would work
S0037	yeah i bet you'd get a soda stream for not very much on amazon
S0115	you you seem to suggest that they weren't that they weren't legal in england be that be that true
S0037	no i didn't no you say can i get one here
S0115	yeah
S0037	and i say do you mean in aldi or do you mean in the unite kingdom
S0115	but like
S0037	and you say oh yeah like there's gonna be ruh ruh so it be you who say that about it not be legal
S0115	i be no i be no no cos um
