S0510	mm yeah that that rice be very tasty i know i know you find that a little bite hot didn't you
S0509	yeah yeah really hot
S0510	i be try to figure out why it be so hot i know that she do when she make it she obviously do use chilli but i mean not excessively but i think
S0509	yeah
S0510	what give it that particular heat be the mustard seed that she use in it
S0509	oh
S0510	erm cos i notice there be a lot of mustard seed in there
S0509	yeah
S0510	so i think it be probably a combination but the lemon for me just perfectly balance balance it out
S0509	no it doesn't take anything away it
S0510	really
S0509	yeah
S0510	no she be erm she be tell me that she'd be cook rice on saturday because in southern india where she's from she's from
S0509	right
S0510	erm oh no hold on hold on no she's not from i lie she's from erm but still south
S0509	right
S0510	erm during monseen monseen monseen susan
S0509	monsson
S0510	erm monsoon season
S0509	season
S0510	monseen
S0510	yeah erm they tend not to eat meat and they eat a lot of vegetarian food
S0509	right
S0510	and this be in part because of their the drastic change in temperature the heat and the rain
S0509	yeah
S0510	erm partly i think it's to do with the fact that erm with all those rain often come sort of waterborne diseases like cholera and things like that
S0509	yeah
S0510	and so they're more traditionally they've be more reticent to eat meat during that period because of the amount of you know
S0509	yeah yeah yeah
S0510	disease and that that could be transmit but also because obviously the cow and all the rest of it be sacred you know to hindus
S0509	oh yeah yeah
S0510	erm particularly as well erm during this month their sort of monsoony month er it's a sin actually to to kill a erm an animal
S0509	oh for what
S0510	that be because it's often their breed season as well so
S0509	ah
S0510	to kill one that be either you know erm with well i don't know with egg or or you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	sort of
S0509	with young
S0510	with well pregnant
S0509	pregnant yeah
S0510	or whatever yeah erm so there's lot of things that tie into it but mainly religiously also in the ayurvedic erm ayurvedic medicine which be sort of you know traditional indian medicine
S0509	right
S0510	erm apparently during monsoon season you know with those fluctuations in temperature and everything your immunity be suppose to be erm
S0509	oh right
S0510	lower so er they they just you know they encourage them to eat lot of vegetarian food or non meat food basically
S0509	yeah
S0510	so she be cook up a storm on saturday erm do lot of different rice and i don't know if you notice with that rice i'm go to have to ask her where she get it from and i have a feel she probably ship it over from india
S0509	really
S0510	because it's so much
S0509	yeah
S0510	it's such a longer grain it's more like a basmati rice
S0509	right
S0510	it's a much longer grain erm i mean she obviously cook it to perfection she's a very good good cook erm so yeah i wouldn't mind try to get hold of some of that
S0510	i mean it's possible there's an asian or you know erm like indian rather food shop that
S0509	that will sell it
S0510	that will sell it but i'd imagine it's it be
S0509	specialist
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	yeah i can't get those icelandic biscuits anywhere they're really
S0510	oh no
S0509	i know
S0510	they be like erm rich tea on steroids those icelandic biscuits aren't they
S0509	yeah a bite
S0510	do you not do you not see the parallel with rich tea
S0509	yeah but they're really the erm
S0510	that's true
S0509	the icelandic ones
S0510	aha yeah
S0509	yeah it's really nice
S0510	mm
S0509	mm i like it
S0510	i know i mean they be such they're like tablets aren't they
S0509	yeah
S0510	they're such big
S0509	they're like you know like they have sea biscuits that like seamen would take
S0510	oh yes yeah yeah
S0509	they're like those
S0510	yeah or those ration biscuits you know for when those mountaineer go up
S0509	yeah exactly
S0510	you know
S0509	yeah yeah yeah
S0509	yeah
S0510	yeah
S0509	except they actually taste of something which i think the other ones don't
S0510	yeah
S0509	i think they're kind of like sustenance only
S0510	mm yeah no enjoyment factor
S0509	no
S0510	or no flavour
S0509	no
S0510	mm
S0509	yeah
S0510	ah so how much do it cost to ship a packet of those icelandic biscuits
S0509	like fifteen quid just for the ship
S0510	oh my goodness and the biscuits themselves be
S0509	like three quid
S0509	i be like oh great i can buy some oh no i can't
S0510	yeah ah
S0509	that would just be ridiculous i might as well fly over there
S0510	yeah
S0509	and like stock up
S0510	actually yeah you might be able to you know make yourself a profit sell them on the open market
S0509	yeah oh my god
S0510	could go you know fund your fund your flight and
S0509	yeah
S0510	trip to iceland by
S0509	yeah get like one of those cheap flight on like an off day
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	and like just hop over there fill up a suitcase with
S0510	find a shop
S0509	fill like you don't even need to take any insurance cos you can just go there and come back on the same day
S0510	exactly same day yeah
S0509	just fill up a suitcase with as many of the biscuits as you can
S0510	yeah
S0509	and then bring them back
S0509	it's like probably there's nobody ever here who actually know what they be
S0510	call for them yeah
S0509	or would pay like three quid for them
S0510	yeah
S0509	which be unfortunate
S0510	ah maybe you could get a little you know market market stallholders mind you that's a long old
S0509	maybe i can
S0510	sort of trail then isn't it of kind of push it to lot of individual retailers and
S0509	yeah i be talk to erm this guy on sunday when i be at work who do the seafood and wine festival
S0510	oh yeah
S0509	and he be talk about how it's like literally a thousand quid for a pitch
S0510	i wonder how much it be cos there be a lot of talk in the social media
S0509	yeah yeah
S0510	this year about the exorbitant price but didn't say what the price be
S0509	cos he be one of the guy who start it this guy he do ciders
S0510	oh right
S0509	and he be in yeah he be i be oh do you go to see food and wine the other week
S0510	yeah
S0509	and he be like oh yeah i be sell cider and he's be do it from the begin
S0510	right
S0509	erm and yeah it's just not good
S0510	so how much do it start out at do he say
S0509	well i don't think it start out as much at all i don't i don't know
S0510	yeah
S0509	i don't know if it be anything but
S0510	yeah
S0509	but it's just become more and more expensive and like more
S0509	like he be say er less local and more like the big restaurants like and that
S0510	yeah aha
S0509	be do it which be kind of defeat the point you know
S0510	yeah cos it's although be local but yeah all the smaller local eateries and
S0509	yeah
S0510	producers and everything just can't afford those kind of
S0509	yeah yeah yeah no
S0510	a thousand pound a day be it
S0509	i think for the whole for the whole weekend include
S0510	or for the two days
S0509	but still
S0510	but you've still get to make a lot to cover that sort of
S0509	yeah
S0510	and then you've get all the staff that you're pay or you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	er okay if you're do it as a one man band fair enough
S0509	fair enough
S0510	but really you need more than that to
S0509	yeah cos he be he be say as well how it you know he'd be do it before and then it on the first time he ever try to do it it be like rain but then it get more popular and he be
S0510	ah
S0509	there be like two of them run this stall and one of them get food poison and be just like lie down
S0510	oh no
S0509	so he be run this stall single handedly when it become really popular
S0510	ah ah
S0509	you know and er yeah crazy time
S0510	that's not a very good erm advert for their stall though if it mind you it wasn't food it be alcohol but
S0509	yeah and he even get yeah no it be yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0510	it be unrelated food poison
S0509	yeah should've mention that by now
S0510	mm
S0509	mm
S0510	ah that's a real shame isn't it
S0509	yeah
S0510	and and also i know everybody i'm generalise now cos i just say everybody
S0510	that's not true but erm a lot of people erm don't like the fact that these sort of festivals you know that start off local and
S0509	yeah
S0510	kind of or
S0509	become
S0510	yeah and and then you know they become out of well just out of reach of the the local
S0509	community
S0510	community that they're they're service or you know producers and all the rest of it
S0509	yeah yeah yeah yeah cos that's what he that's it use to be producers and now it's it's not
S0510	aha yeah and and that's what it be suppose to be about showcasing just what amaze
S0509	yeah
S0510	you know local food and wine you can get
S0509	yeah yeah yeah
S0510	but yeah when it become as big as that then sadly what tend to happen be that the smaller man get cut out really
S0509	yeah
S0510	and that's who it's sort of all about in the first place
S0509	yeah
S0510	such a shame
S0509	it be indeed yeah well cos i be say as well it's the first year we haven't be
S0510	mm
S0509	so it's
S0510	yeah mm
S0509	it's just
S0510	yeah it didn't look that invite to be honest i think i don't know
S0509	no it just look cram and like
S0510	yeah
S0509	we be only go to go in and buy food
S0510	yeah
S0509	and i there be other place that i can buy food and i can buy food from most of these place without pay to go in there
S0510	yeah
S0509	yeah i know it's only a nominal sum but even then
S0510	yeah it's just the it's the fact that you be
S0509	if they they do have music go on though to be fair i suppose
S0510	i didn't hear any of it
S0509	oh well they have that tent though didn't they so there should have be
S0510	do they have that beachside because like
S0509	yeah
S0510	oh they do in the end oh
S0509	well it look that's what it look like to me anyway
S0510	right mm i know when they be do or suppose to be do the beach festival erm part of the problem with that other than the lack of fund initially
S0509	yeah
S0510	be that there be work be do on the rnli build
S0509	ah
S0510	so they couldn't have that spot
S0509	yeah
S0510	erm but you know the bigger thing be they be more likely to get fund put it where they put it in the end
S0509	right
S0510	erm the council support it more
S0509	yeah
S0510	mm mm i hope to go back though
S0509	yeah
S0510	just to check it out and see what it's like
