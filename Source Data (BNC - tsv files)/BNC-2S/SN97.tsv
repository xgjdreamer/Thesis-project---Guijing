S0282	how many bulbs do you buy in the end
S0283	i buy two hundred snowdrop bulbs and that's four different varieties of snowdrops fifty of each so i think we put them in the little verge at the front and i think we put them in clump of about ten lot of about twenty of about ten just dot around and then hopefully they'll all come up in the spring and hopefully they'll propagate or whatever the word be and then over time we'll just have a complete snowdrop lawn wouldn't that be lovely
S0282	that would be lovely what kind of snowdrops do you be they particular kinds
S0283	oh i can't remember some big some small some double some single don't know
S0282	do you just go for quantity or do you go for the kind that be more attractive
S0283	no no the
S0282	because they're taller or double feature or whatever
S0283	no there be four different kinds that be on sale and i think i'd get some of each of them
S0282	and when be there be arrive
S0283	hopefully they be arrive in the next day or so
S0282	right
S0283	so that's another task that we can by the end of the week
S0282	and do they have to go in straight away
S0283	they don't have to go in straight away they do have to go in sooner rather than later
S0282	i can't remember when we put bulbs in last year
S0283	we tend to put them in quite late we tend to put them in in sort of november
S0282	when it's dark and wet and cold
S0283	when it's dark and wet and cold so this time we'll do in october when it's dark and wet and cold
S0282	mm
S0283	and the tree or the tree be arrive on wednesday or thursday
S0282	and where be you go to put that
S0283	almond tree i think we should put the almond tree slightly in front of the plum tree
S0282	oh right
S0283	so under the underneath the apple tree
S0282	right
S0283	it say you can't have it near a peach tree
S0282	oh
S0283	but we haven't get a peach tree so it doesn't really matter if you have it near a peach tree then they cross pollinate and your almonds taste of peach
S0282	no that that can't be true
S0283	well
S0282	that can't be true that doesn't make sense at all
S0283	that's what it say on the internet and the internet never lie
S0282	yeah right that can't be true we've get a nectarine tree but that's never do anything
S0283	no that's no i know but that's probably because it's too close to the almond tree
S0282	no it's never have almonds in it it's just never do anything because it's lazy or something i don't know or it's a boy tree or something
S0283	anyway erm so yeah so the bulbs be come this week and they're the tree be also come this week i think the tree should go as i say slightly in front of the erm of the plum tree but it need a lot of sun
S0282	right
S0283	erm but that mean that we can't have the soft fruit
S0282	unless we have it at the front of the lawn
S0283	we could well it get a lot of sun there
S0282	mm
S0283	er but it only get sun until halfway through the day it doesn't get even sun and we need to put
S0282	be there anywhere that get sun all day i don't think there be
S0283	probably not which be a bite of a pain isn't it
S0282	we've get such a big plot and yet there isn't a bite which do get sun all day
S0283	no i know erm and we also need to work out where to put the cherry tree
S0282	which cherry tree
S0283	the cherry tree in the pot
S0282	oh right okay i think we be gonna put it where it stand
S0283	okay but it's so well no i think erm that the almond tree might look might nice with the plum tree at the top of the garden erm but again that would mean that we'd need to move all soft fruit
S0282	aren't we gonna put all the nut together
S0283	what nut have we get
S0282	i think we be go to put the nut
S0283	what other nut have we get
S0282	well walnut
S0283	what walnut
S0282	the walnut down in that corner
S0283	what walnut
S0282	the one that get eat by the date but no be it a walnut no it's not a walnut no i didn't buy a walnut in the end because apparently it poison everything within ten metres of it no sorry that be a mulberry tree i buy a mulberry tree in the end rather than a walnut tree no cos walnut tree be suppose to be really there be something about them that's quite toxic like rhododendrons
S0283	okay
S0282	well i don't know
S0283	well we could we could put the almond tree down there with the apple tree and mulberry tree and the fig tree
S0282	mm we could
S0283	but erm but the apple tree's not do well down there
S0282	no but i think that's that's cos the deer eat its grow tip
S0283	for anyone who's listen this isn't our own domestic deer this be a deer that walk in from the forest from the woods
S0282	what what think people think we've get a pet deer
S0283	well if there's
S0282	have we get a pet deer
S0283	the deer eat the apple tree
S0282	it's a pass deer
S0283	yes it's a deer
S0282	it's a itinerary itinerant deer
S0283	yes anyway okay so yeah so so we're gonna put the bulbs in we also need to i think dig up load of rhododendron er up by the soft fruit i want to do a lot of weed as well i think we need to get get all the fern up
S0282	yeah
S0283	erm and i'd like to thin out a lot of the weed in the bed as well
S0282	the weed in the bed
S0283	at the back and at the front
S0282	oh right okay be there a lot of weed
S0283	yes
S0282	oh no we need to tackle the tree though cos that sycamore be back by the rhubarb there's a stump right by the little engine room
S0283	when do you do that
S0282	and then i think i spray it so it's look really black and twist and horrible but it be never less persist in grow lot and lot of little treelets off the big stump
S0283	okay well we can kill those bastards
S0282	and also i need to get up more tree because erm i say to the woodland trust that we would remove lot of saplings and i would take along about i say i'd take along about thirty oaks which i think we've get more or less thirty oaks but also various other things such as sweet chestnuts and beeches and erm what's the other thing
S0283	when's that on the second of december
S0282	er thirteenth of december something around there
S0283	okay
S0282	there's a plant of the of the centenary wood
S0283	and who be go to be actually do the plant
S0282	i don't know there's a whole day where erm the woodland trust be look for donations to buy tree to go in the centenary wood but there's a plant day so they say to turn up with my saplings then
S0283	mm where be it
S0283	be there a wood in
S0282	not yet but there will be a wood in epsom it's one of these new woods
S0283	okay so what's there at the moment just plain grind
S0282	i don't know really i don't know what there be i don't know whether it's sort of whether there's a wood or the beginnings of a wood there now that they're go to add to or whether somebody's donate them a piece of land or what really
S0283	mm i also would like to mow the lawn but i'm not sure that's gonna happen
S0282	this week
S0283	yeah
S0282	well not if it's gonna rain like this
S0283	no that's a bugger i would've like to have do that
S0282	yeah it's about time really you might have to wait for a bite for that but that's not a long job be it
S0283	couple of hours three hours four hours
S0282	mm half a day that's not too bad
S0283	yeah i need to fix the trolley
S0282	mm
S0283	not happy about that
S0282	well no that's a bite strange that its collapse already
S0283	mm
S0282	when my dad buy a shed off the internet he buy a metal shed and the door be defective and it take about six months to get a door that fit
S0283	i've hear this story
S0282	have you
S0283	yes i hear it in real time and i've hear it since a number of time as well
S0282	but that's annoy because that's the kind of thing where
S0283	mm
S0282	you know you just keep on moan and moan and nobody take any notice of you
S0283	mm well erm it be just a question of fix nut so it should should be okay
S0282	do you do anything to it to make it fall apart
S0283	what like use it
S0282	well i think
S0283	have you use it
S0282	yeah but i think the log splitter be a bite heavier i think that be really push it to its nth degree that one
S0283	no it can deal with much more than that
S0282	eh
S0283	yeah it be it wasn't it wasn't the weight it be the twist on the axle that do it it have self lock nut underneath the axle
S0282	mm
S0283	and basically if you if you move the erm pulley arm
S0282	mm
S0283	then it just unlock the the self lock nut that's what happen so
S0282	but then that's not a self lock nut be it it's
S0283	well exactly that's why i'm a bite cross
S0282	it's the self
S0283	it's an it's a self unlock nut which isn't really what you want
S0282	mm mm
S0283	turn out i'm not happy
S0282	i can imagine it's not
S0283	i'm not happy about that
S0282	well no but this be be this the penalty of buy things off the internet you can't actually see them before you buy them
S0283	it would've do better with a cotter pin
S0282	oh would it
S0283	instead of a split pin yeah
S0282	you don't even know what a cotter pin be do you
S0283	yes i do
S0282	do you
S0283	yeah it's like a split pin
S0282	and what's a split pin
S0283	it's a pin that's split and you put it through the hole and it expand outside of the hole you splay it and it hold things in place actually
S0282	all this manly stuff you're learn
S0283	don't taunt me in front of others because it's not fun it's not big it's not clever
S0282	well this be a new variable life you see you be an urban creature before and now you're a rural creature and you're learn about these cotter pin and split pin
S0283	i know what cotter pin be before i
S0282	bulbs
S0283	move out of london
S0282	now know what a bulb be
S0283	what be kirsty wark wear
S0282	i know it's very strange isn't it it's a very savage colour
S0283	mm yeah so anyway okay so we've get all of that to do
S0282	that's if it stop rain
S0283	yeah and i also need to split log and to get the chainsaw out as well
S0282	you're not go to split log when i'm not here be you
S0283	why not
S0282	because isn't it dangerous doesn't it need two people
S0283	no
S0282	shouldn't i supervise you just in case there's an industrial accident
S0283	well you okay i won't but
S0282	what if i go out and i come home and the house be all quiet and dark and i couldn't find you and then i go down to the garage and there you be split in two by your log splitter and there'd be blood all over the garage
S0283	be that likely to happen that i would get split in two
S0282	i don't know
S0283	it's more likely that i'd lose a finger
S0282	yeah but what would you do if you lose a finger
S0283	well i'd look for it and then i'd probably phone the ambulance and say could you come and pick me up please cos my wife have get the car and they'd take me to a and e
S0282	would you have your mobile phone with you if you be log split in the garage
S0283	possibly possibly
S0282	well you'd have to crawl back to the house wouldn't you to get your mobile phone
S0283	i wouldn't have to crawl
S0282	you might not make it
S0283	i can walk without a finger
S0282	no but what if you have a catastrophic loss of blood
S0283	anyway
S0282	you could be faint you could be light head because you lose a finger what if you lose an arm or a hand or something
S0283	i could okay
S0282	there could be blood go everywhere
S0283	well okay well i won't do that tomorrow then i
S0282	it might make your phone malfunction cos of all the blood
S0283	i won't do that tomorrow then i'll wait until wednesday and you can you can be around watch me use the chainsaw and the log splitter
S0282	mm that would really be excite
S0283	and what be you go to do you're so drink for anyone who's listen she's drink and what be you go to do while i'm do that
S0282	what in london tomorrow
S0283	no
S0282	on wednesday
S0283	yeah
S0282	oh who's that emmanuel prime minister of france
S0283	i've never hear of him
S0282	that no that he look most unlikely he's not french have he get a french face no and she's still wear that top
S0283	can you talk into the recorder please
S0282	sorry okay erm
S0283	what be you
S0282	on wednesday
S0283	yeah while i'm do all of that manly stuff i suppose you could do some weed
S0282	i don't know well we're wait for the bloke from the phone company aren't we
S0283	be we
S0282	yep i think that post at the end of 's drive be a phone post don't you
S0283	well yes be there any what's come off it where's our electricity come from
S0282	it come from a post across the road er come over the drive it come over that gate
S0283	right
S0282	and it come back to the house but but the post it come from be over the other side of the road so i think the post outside 's which where he's get his cottage sign on it i think that's a phone post
S0283	mm okay
S0282	so i think i'm gonna say to the phone engineer they've get to come off that post and come to the back of the house where the electricity come in
S0283	okay
S0282	and then that mean they can come through the wall there by the bathroom
S0283	yeah
S0282	and then there's a minimum amount of wire inside the house
S0283	okay they must have drill
S0282	do that make sense
S0283	through the radiator
S0282	through the radiator no that would be that would be that would be very serious wouldn't it no i think they need to come in actually i think they need to come in higher i think they need to come in towards the top of the of the room by the eaves rather than at the bottom because we don't want a wire go overhead that's snag on things we want to go as high as possible don't we so that it avoid
S0283	yes yes
S0282	erm any kind of snag from beneath
S0283	yeah it's the space between be there a jam above the door to the attic could it go above the door to the attic
S0282	i don't think it could go that way i think it would come in
S0283	above the bathroom
S0282	between the window and the bathroom door and then run a wire across the top of the bathroom door
S0283	avoid the radiator
S0282	well it would be up higher than the radiator
S0283	yeah okay okay whatever whatever
S0282	if i can persuade him to do that but i think he's get to put in a master bt switch of something
S0283	okay well i hope he know what he's do
S0282	he will do but we've get to persuade him to do what we want rather than take the easy route into the house really
S0283	yes which be what they'll want to do
S0282	yeah but then apparently it be talktalk they use telephone line rather than cable
S0283	yeah
S0282	or they're quite happy to use phone line and in fact it's not even talktalk that's come it's bt open reach that's come
S0283	yeah
S0282	so theoretically they've get authority to use the phone line and things it might be he's get a better connection than we've get in the end
S0283	we've get fibre optic he's get copper wire
S0282	be that worse
S0283	yes
S0282	no they're say bt open reach be use erm be use er fibre optic now
S0283	okay but the cable from a er telegraph pole isn't fibre optic
S0282	isn't it
S0283	no copper wire
S0282	and what do that mean
S0283	it mean that it's not as fast as fibre optic it's probably fast enough for his purpose but it's not superfast
S0282	isn't it
S0283	no
S0282	well we've get superfast
S0283	we've get extraordinarily fast
S0282	well think that he's that he's get faster
S0283	erm
S0282	with sky have he not get a best service than us a better service than us
S0283	i don't not necessarily no
S0282	why not he think he's get a better service than us
S0283	i'm sure he do but i'm not sure that he do his come off a satellite not off off a cable
S0282	be that better or worse
S0283	i don't know i don't know i don't know
S0282	he think it's better
S0283	fine if you get i mean i i've get no problem with ours be perfectly fine there's not a problem with it at all
S0282	there be a problem on a friday sometimes i can't get online if you've get online before me
S0283	no
S0282	that's true it be true
S0283	that's nothing to do with
S0282	if i have a problem and i can't get online it's on a friday when you're here
S0283	it's nothing to do with that
S0282	well
S0283	it really be nothing to do with that
S0282	something happen
S0283	mm anyway so
S0282	erm so we have to hope on that he actually turn up on wednesday they do actually that letter i have say if you don't make a new appointment we'll cancel the contract altogether so i think he he
S0283	okay but
S0282	but there's not enough time to organise a freesat or the alternatives to to what he want i mean if he be to have a new phone line he would have to have a new bt master switch anyway wouldn't he
S0283	er well can i just they're turn up on wednesday i think have we get a piece of paper that say they're turn up on wednesday
S0282	no there's no piece of paper say they'll turn up on wednesday when they didn't turn up on the first i phone them up and say where be you i be expect you they say no no no it's on the eighth and then after they tell me it be the eighth i then have a phone i then have a letter from them say erm you weren't there for your appointment on the twenty fourth erm we need you to make another appointment unless you make another appointment we will cancel everything but i have already have that phone conversation say they be come on the eighth so unless there's some cross wire internally
S0283	right okay well if they turn up on wednesday they turn up on wednesday
S0282	mm
S0283	he can have his own phone if he want his own phone he can have his own tv if he want his own tv and his own broadband if he want it if he want to pay twice for everything
S0282	well he would have to have his own phone wouldn't he he want his they want they're own phone so they'd need to pay for their own phone the fact that then they be pay for extras that they don't need be unfortunate and if he have his own phone surely it would be a bite cheaper would it not be a bite cheaper
S0283	how do you mean
S0282	if you just have
S0283	can you talk into the thing please
S0282	sorry if you just have a phone
S0283	yeah
S0282	rather then if he have broadband and television
S0283	yeah of course it would be cheaper yeah
S0282	but do he get his his free call to france only because he's get the bigger package
S0283	no no you get that off your phone package no he's decide to get the tv package and he's decide to get the erm broadband because someone sell it to him he doesn't need either of them it's a waste of money
S0282	there's nothing we can do about that now be there
S0283	no because it's his contract
S0282	i suppose over time perhaps over time we can persuade him that he's buy more than he need
S0283	he will always say he will always say that he's lock into a contract he's just an obstinate old git and he's not gonna stop he's he know i have i tell him what to do he's do something different he's do it deliberately
S0282	mm
S0283	so you know
S0282	have it do it have it do it because he think he know better than you
S0283	i have no idea no he's do it because he think he know best he's do it i don't know why i don't know why i don't know what's in his head
S0282	i think he also think that unless he have a contract with them he can't keep his email address which as i which i can't blame him for because i think well actually if we swap we wouldn't keep our email address either
S0283	erm
S0282	but you can keep your email address
S0283	you can keep your email address you don't need a television contract to keep your email address
S0282	no that's true perhaps he think he's get particularly good value
S0283	well it depend
S0282	will he get better broadband
S0283	if you think if you think if you think
S0282	will get better broadband here than he's have before
S0283	i don't well he would get better broadband than he's have before because he's get shit broadband before but it it's not good value for money to pay for something that you don't need it's not good value for money to pay for something that have already be pay for but be better than what you're pay for
S0282	no but he'll he'll be think well if i'm on the same circuit as them they'll be able to see my email or something
S0283	but he's not think that at all he's just think this be what i want the the same way as he's think he think that he's set up his own house in our house
S0282	yeah
S0283	which be why he's bring his entire house with him
S0282	yes
S0283	so actually he's not he hasn't actually work out that he's not live in his own house any more you know i wouldn't be surprise to when they come back from france if he tell us that he's organise insurance for us and he's sign us up with a new deal for electricity and gas
S0282	yes well we'll have to try and explain to him that we think that we owe sse thousands of pound and that's the reason why we can't swap
S0283	yes well i think we do owe them thousands of pound
S0282	but that doesn't explain why they haven't stop bill us since they read the meter
S0283	well they say they be gonna bill us in october so we're wait for the bill i've say this to you several time
S0282	i know but if they think that we owe them several thousand pound why would they wait until october to bill us
S0283	i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know they've be peculiar and bizarre all the way through and they're still be peculiar and bizarre
S0282	be there any chance at all that we've misunderstand the meter
S0283	yes there be a chance
S0282	and we're actually thousands of pound in advance because the 's pay
S0283	well well we're not thousands of pound we're not thousands of no er the meter
S0282	perhaps pay so much that they
S0283	no the meter be read the meter be read when they leave so it's nothing to do with them be it we we give them a meter read when we arrive here and the 's give them a meter read before they leave here
S0282	but we've have
S0283	so it be possible that i've misread it and it be possible that er we don't owe them money but we're not thousands of pound in advance because we haven't give them thousands of pound
S0282	no no no but erm they've they have actually read the meter twice now and that hasn't
S0283	yes i understand that
S0282	result in the bill
S0283	i understand that i understand that i don't know what they're not do but there's not a human be involve be there cos it go into computers and computers don't decide things they just do what they're program to do
S0282	but if somebody go no but the person who come round to read the meter be a human be
S0283	yeah
S0282	and they put it in their little machine and they take it away and theoretically then the machine at the other end should generate a bill
S0283	should generate a bill yes it should
S0282	and the fact that be hasn't would surely indicate that we don't owe them money cos that's now happen twice
S0283	no well you can say that but it doesn't indicate any such thing it just i don't i don't know why they haven't bill us well i don't know why they didn't bill us three months ago when they should've do i don't understand but i don't think it's because they owe us thousands of pound
S0282	do you phone up
S0283	no
S0282	i think you phone up
S0283	no
S0282	really i think you phone up and and say why you haven't you bill us
S0283	no i look online to see whether or not they have bill us and they hadn't bill us so erm i check and it say when it it say that they be go to bill us in august and then they didn't and now it say they're go to bill us in october so i presume they will and it may be that they bill us for thousands and thousands of pound in which case we have to work out what to do about it
S0282	well we have to throw ourselves on their mercy
S0283	yep yeah not good
S0282	well no bite worry isn't it
S0283	yes it be worry what be you do now
S0282	make list
S0283	what be you make list you can't make a list we're do a tape record at the moment
S0282	no because you have to say on on the form that you send in what you've be talk about
S0283	okay what have we be talk about
S0282	bulbs garden it connections gas bill this be scintillate
S0283	i know the person who's listen to this must be thoroughly excite by by this conversation
S0282	say to me be it go to be a machine that listen or a human be and i think oh i don't know
S0283	i'd imagine it's a human be
S0282	be there machine that do that sort of thing yet i don't know
S0283	well but if if the
