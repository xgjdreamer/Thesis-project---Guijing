S0363	mm
S0336	oh the joy of adulthood
S0363	i know
S0336	when you're worry about mattresses
S0363	oh funny
S0336	any work we're cook tonight
S0363	we get 's sister erm i hate the word fiancée boyfriend come over
S0336	fiancée fiancée
S0363	come over for dinner i haven't see him in a while
S0363	er well i think erm you know have you be watch that shop for less
S0336	no
S0363	recently erm i've watch two now it's where they basically go and do an intervention with a family
S0336	okay
S0363	who be like shop ridiculously
S0336	yeah
S0363	and they've all get certain problems and erm basically firstly this this family they they their biggest problem's where they don't look what's in their erm kitchen before they go
S0336	i hate that
S0363	and don't write a list and don't plan meals erm so they're always just basically a hoarder of food
S0336	just get too much food yeah
S0363	so they're buy way too much food and the husband he buy he like to just try things new
S0336	yeah
S0363	so he's always just pick he doesn't really know what they be he pick up like jar of stuff
S0336	yeah
S0363	and say oh we'll try that some time so their biggest thing be they have to plan their meals and then obviously only buy the stuff that you need for those meals
S0336	yeah
S0363	and then they have a day off for whatever the husband's name be for him to do whatever he like
S0336	yeah
S0363	so he can still go anyway er this last week's one their biggest one be family er be buy brand
S0336	okay
S0363	basically just buy brand cos they think it's better
S0336	yeah
S0363	erm and the wife she's get four kid so she's buy things she say she not the biggest cooker
S0336	yeah
S0363	and she and even that she'll buy
S0336	okay
S0363	and stuff like that
S0336	yeah cos she can't be bother to cook
S0363	yeah
S0336	right okay
S0363	things like that they be extortionate whatever their their shop be
S0336	really
S0363	like well close to four hundred quid a week they would spend
S0336	it's
S0363	it turn out be like something like eight grand a year six grand a year
S0336	on food oh my god
S0363	on food so their thing be obviously erm first of all er shop around don't just go cos it's a brand
S0336	yeah
S0363	so cos what they do they then go in and they they change your kitchen over and they take everything out of package they do it with the first one
S0336	yeah
S0363	they take everything out of package and just label it like tea
S0336	yeah
S0363	or coffee and it's so funny some people when they haven't even change their brand they're like this isn't the same this have definitely devalue stuff erm it's like
S0336	cos they they be expect it
S0363	yeah for instance one thing they this couple the other night like marinate chicken
S0336	yeah
S0363	from mark and spencer
S0336	okay
S0363	and but they hadn't change it at all and they be like this just look awful and then she be like i can't even eat my chicken cos i know it's value value brand and that chicken just taste awful dry and disgust i i can't eat it
S0336	that's hilarious
S0363	and they be like it's the same she be like no so it's that be weird but also they be talk about convenience and be in jar and stuff i now and i be think about you cos you've obviously you've be have to make everything from scratch as well
S0336	yeah
S0363	but i've all the time don't buy bolognese sauce any more or lasagne sauce i make that from scratch
S0336	yeah
S0363	but i be like how the fuck do you make a curry sauce from scratch not that i would
S0336	yeah a little bite it's it's like tin tin tomatoes and coconut milk essentially
S0363	yeah
S0336	erm obviously it's get load of other spice but that's like the bulk of it
S0336	yeah and it's like two tin for a pound it's really cheap to make it from scratch but it's just an effort
S0363	yeah and then obviously one of the things they make her do be erm they didn't give her carrot batons they give her carrots
S0336	yeah
S0363	just she be like and then she be they taste so much better than carrot batons be like yeah because carrot batons have be peel and be wash and they just soak up all the water all they be be water base soon as you open that bag they dry up
S0336	yeah
S0363	so she say you should see when she's cut these carrots she's like oh so much effort
S0336	oh my god
S0363	i be laugh so much anyway they make this main attention to get this make this meal it be quite quick erm and it taste good and it be all prepare yourself
S0336	yeah
S0363	out of nothing and they make that it's just like chop roast vegetables like courgettes
S0336	yeah
S0363	and there be little tomatoes and bits like that then you shove your chicken on top and then you drizzle it in oil and
S0336	yeah
S0363	and shit and spice whatever you want with that and then i don't know what you put it with yet
S0336	well it sound nice
S0363	probably new potatoes or something
S0336	sound good we're mean to be erm erm and my mum tonight
S0363	oh yeah
S0336	and i kind of like spring it on mum i be just like oh and we've not get plan for saturday shall we just invite our parent round cos apparently since we've move in we've never cook for his parent which i think be quite bad
S0336	it's be like six months erm and like mum bless her doesn't often go out on saturdays so i be like oh might as well and then last night i be like have you have any inspiration about what to cook and he be like no you organise this you sort the dinner
S0336	i'm like okay oh
S0363	oh
S0336	i haven't i haven't think about it at all so i be go to go this afternoon after i go round tesco and try to get
S0363	well if you wanna go to tesco on the way back with me i need to pick up my stuff
S0336	i haven't get a clue and the like opinions that me and have get into such a habit of like cook the same kind of meals cos we've really get really like kind of like comfortable with them
S0363	yeah
S0336	and i don't really wanna do that and i don't wanna like i don't wanna pick something that's gonna take me age either
S0363	no yeah that's good
S0336	yeah
S0363	i text your mum yesterday
S0336	do you
S0363	last night i be like i text her really bad really grumpy
S0336	i'm sure she appreciate that
S0363	what do she say i be like i know she'd be watch it i text her go that's a win to england like hopefully watch the game and hope you're well she say yes i've see you throughout until the last ten days well should have win that good to watch i say i'll give you the first half but i'm afraid i'm afraid you've win no point in the second half
S0363	i think i've lose my voice from scream so much she's like harsh my boys take some knock for this i have that's cute
S0336	yeah she love it i bet she have like a whole host of those as well like go like ha ha
S0363	yeah probably i do think that after ours that i'm go to support wales now
S0336	i do i do i do enjoy the six nations we be actually out last night my dad dad's go to saudi on monday
S0363	oh yeah
S0336	i don't know if i tell you
S0363	you do say age ago about it but i don't think it would come round so quick
S0336	yeah so he's off on monday for three months so he call us and he say what do you want to do for dinner so we go to the in which be really nice but obviously the rugby be still kinda on but it be like round the corner from where we be so we couldn't see him so i didn't actually watch it last night though
S0363	it be a good game
S0336	i do enjoy it it's a hard game cos like 's definitely not a rugby person so like
S0363	well he's not sport at all be he
S0336	no
S0363	so maybe tennis but that's about it
S0336	yeah i can't really see him have it on although he might get into it like he's also like fairly easy in that respect like it might take a little bite of convince but once it's on he get really into it
S0363	i mean i don't i don't watch sport like really i think i'm just a like what's the word national sport
S0336	yeah
S0363	like just really watch
S0336	no
S0363	watch
S0336	yeah
S0363	cricket
S0336	it's a lot easier when you've get somebody to like get behind
S0363	yeah
S0336	i can't i don't i don't understand like like football supporters who like just watch like any football game
S0363	they like don't like support either convenience
S0336	yeah
S0363	they're like well we really want to see where they come in the cup it's like how on earth do you keep track of that i'm like what fuck cup be they play now
S0336	yeah it's so exactly
S0363	be it a league game or be it
S0336	and it's so unnecessary as well because if you watch something like match of the day you kind of get a round up anyway so why do you have to watch like all of the game
S0363	it's more fun to watch that
S0336	weird weird
S0363	then i say that and then it's on and then i get into and i'm like i'm like tell they're stupid idiots look at them fannying about outside the goal and i'm like oh obviously it just irritate me
S0336	yeah
S0363	irritate wind me up thing be as soon as i pick a side that i want to win cos i don't support anybody they're the ones that be fuck lose
S0336	yeah always tend to be the way so excite about your holiday
S0363	yeah i've really not be think it it's crazy
S0336	yeah
S0363	not think about and i just think today oh god we're go to
S0336	that's very excite
S0363	two weeks today
S0336	yeah
S0363	have you decide what day you're do your or be you go to
S0336	no i haven't really i haven't really plan anything i be actually go to speak to you about it because i didn't know whether you fancy do like a joint something at some point like joint meal or a joint something i don't really know
S0363	yeah
S0336	i'm not do anything on my actual birthday erm me and be gonna go away on the friday night erm i think we're just gonna head out towards then
S0363	find somewhere
S0336	yeah and then go go for some nice walk in the peak yeah on saturday
S0363	that sound really nice
S0336	erm so i'll be out friday and saturday anyway i don't really fancy try to like rush something together on the sunday just for the sake of do something so i'm not really that fuss like i probably should be i'm just not like
S0363	i know i'm the same though
S0336	i just don't really care it's another birthday i don't know 's be ask what what i'm do i'm like i don't know like i don't care which doesn't really help i'm like don't set aside any time because you know i feel bad i feel bad if we don't do anything cos i think it's like it's obviously like 's birthday be the same weekend so it's like if 's do something you do it don't worry
S0363	how be erm be she good
S0336	yeah she's alright
S0363	she settle down south
S0336	yeah kind of like i haven't really see her in age to be honest erm i haven't see her since new year i don't think she's have like a few busy weeks and paths haven't cross etcetera erm i think she's do okay like she's not like she's not really that comfortable in so she tend to come home every weekend or like or she's be up to see her friend in and stuff like that so i don't think she's settle settle it's a weird one
S0363	it's more of a she's just there for work
S0336	yeah she's literally there just for just for the job and i think i think it's hard cos she enjoy it but
S0363	the social side do grind on you a little bite doesn't it
S0336	yeah it's just and like she's already admit that she's not go to be able to do it long term and then i'm kind of think like how long be you plan to stay there like you know what what benefit be it to you really but it's her decision at the end of the day like
S0363	her and 's
S0336	yeah i mean i think they have they have they have a tricky time of it after new year i think because they've be together a while now they've be together since sort of like may time and like 's just like you know what 's like he's just so chill about everything but like to a fault like he just didn't seem to care about anything and like you can tell he like her but like he just wasn't like go out of his way to do anything like and like you know
S0363	yeah be spontaneous or
S0336	yeah well the thing be he actually just didn't wanna make plan he'd be like oh we'll probably do something at the weekend but then like wouldn't wouldn't actually like commit to do stuff and she's like how on earth be i like mean to plan my life bear in mind i like i live miles away like and we need to have plan like otherwise we're not gonna see each other i'm not gonna just hang around and hope that on a saturday afternoon he ring me and say like be you free do you want to do something
S0363	that sound more like date
S0336	i know it's weird
S0363	ring on a saturday afternoon you know what i mean
S0336	and like like i mean she's not the first person to tell me and i don't not not one to judge but before christmas she do tell me like they've not use the l word yet
S0363	mm
S0336	and i think right well everybody come to that of their own kind of pace but like guy have be see each other like eight months now like that's quite a long time she's like well i think we're there but i just don't think either of us want to say it i'm like
S0363	well sometimes might be just my judgement but if if she do love him
S0336	yeah
S0363	why worry about say first
S0336	exactly i say it first and i don't
S0363	i say it first i couldn't hold it in any longer
S0336	i don't really care i know like that's the thing though as soon as you feel it it be really weird it feel like it's ready to burst out
S0336	yeah
S0363	if you definitely love that person and still they haven't say anything and you're still hold back though that won't
S0336	yeah
S0363	i think that would really grind on you
S0336	it's weird and i think she's worry about push him away like because this be his first proper relationship so i think he's
S0363	and he's very blasé about it
S0336	yeah i think he's find the whole situation really intense it's really weird like i have quite an in depth conversation with her about it at one point in that like it kind of seem like for age he be hold onto the idea that like he didn't want to meet someone now like he
S0363	have a set plan in his head
S0336	yeah he have a he have plan in his head you know he want to move to cambridge he want to he want to do his own thing and you can see that in him like you can see him very much like do his own thing he's really independent erm so i don't he be ready to meet a girl who be then gonna like dictate that or like have an opinion on like you know what he's do and so for age i think he be hold onto this idea that like he want to be independent he want to be single he want to be this he want to be that but actually like you can't choose when you meet someone like
S0363	no
S0336	like if if somebody say to me a few years ago oh by the time you're twenty five like you'll be in a really serious relationship you would of buy a house you'll be talk about kid you'll be talk about marriage and it won't and it won't scare the shit out of you i'd be like fuck off
S0363	yeah
S0336	like i have no plan to be in that position by the time i be twenty five like
S0363	no
S0336	twenty eight approach thirty maybe but like not twenty five
S0363	maybe cos everyone have a little bite of a plan in their head don't they
S0336	exactly like but the thing be when you meet when you meet someone that you're will to make those plan with
S0363	things change
S0336	yeah things change so i think they're actually all the better for it it all come come to a bite of a head when be like look i really like you but i'm not gonna just kind of deal with all of this and do as you please like you have to make more of an effort you know you have to kind of prove to me that you want this because at the moment it seem that you can take it or leave it which isn't very nice
S0363	mm
S0336	erm and apparently they both have a bite of a cry and apparently like it be on a sunday so she go home then and then on a monday night straight after work he be call her sort of say like i'm sorry i've be stupid so
S0363	i mean that would be the best opportunity
S0336	yeah i think i think they're better for it now but i think he's also one of reason i haven't see her in age cos i think i think she's still kind of like she's a bite like me in as much like she's get a lazy boyfriend so that she end up run round do everything and that's what it be with me and at the start like i felt like i be make all the plan and i be make all of the effort erm and it sound like she's still do the same so she's still run round like she's drive to in the week and she's the one that's kind of
S0363	they're the same group aren't they i mean they're useless at make plan
S0336	yeah i mean and i they haven't spend time together that they've plan in a year and a half the only time they see each other be when me and have make plan and they've tag along i'm not joke it's be really bad they're so they're just shit at keep in touch erm that's like semi amuse but it's just like stupid
S0363	could have
S0336	mm i don't i've i've only ever be once i don't know the way
S0363	oh i'll take you back
S0336	yeah
S0363	what a douchebag he should of let you go
S0336	sit there
S0363	i know it's a roundabout but seriously
S0336	i know
S0336	yeah everybody's good seem seem good although i'm die for him to meet someone because he just i think he's ready for it like he obviously enjoy be single for age and i think he's just really ready to have have somebody in his life now but he erm he go to he go to canada recently for ten days
S0363	yeah be he with a girl
S0336	yeah it's all very strange so like obviously go to the philippines
S0363	philippines i think it be with her
S0336	yeah so he meet a couple of girls out there erm apparently they be all very into which be all quite cute and he have a bite of a weird romance while he be out there with erm a girl that he'd actually meet before cos she'd come to she'd come to the uk for one reason or another
S0363	mm
S0336	erm so they'd meet before and they'd kind of hit it off so they start kind of like oh it's sound crude but they be basically just sleep together
S0363	yeah
S0336	so she'd come to his hotel room and at the weekend they'd kind of like sleep together and just hang out and whatever and then erm say she start to develop feel so he have he have to end things cos that be the gentlemanly thing to do erm but what we didn't know be there be this other girl that he happen to have meet out there who he's kind of be like facebook chat to like
S0363	so have a bite more of an intimate relationship
S0336	yeah like he say like he say the like they always have plenty to talk about on facebook they talk like every couple of days and stuff which be quite nice and then she invite him over to canada which be where she actually live erm so be and kind of embrace life cos he tend to do that he's like oh yeah cool i'll come to canada erm so he book some flight out there they weren't too expensive and then she plan basically his whole trip like she book him book him ski she book him like on all these coach tour and all this kind of stuff so he turn up and like i think it be fairly like what do he say open mind about the prospect of romance but be also quite aware that you know
S0363	she live in canada
S0336	yeah and she he wasn't really sure what to expect erm so he say he arrive and he be like really open mind about it all but in a few days he'd kind of already realise that they actually didn't have a lot in common he say it be really weird to say that they've be talk for like months on facebook or whatever as soon as she as soon as he meet her in person he find it really really hard to talk to her so like
S0363	god you two be like kind of similar aren't you really you and
S0336	yeah oh i mean yeah
S0363	quite picky
S0336	me and like it's i think that's well we're both sarcastic knobheads
S0336	erm but yeah so he sort of think like oh god like even things like you know he's ask her what her hobbies be and stuff like that she just didn't have any and it's just like what do you talk about with someone if they don't have like
S0363	i'd be like
S0336	hobbies or interest or whatever and i be like i don't know erm so he still sleep with her because he's
S0363	and he be there
S0336	and he be there and he be in canada and embrace it and all this kind of shit but erm yeah it be all very weird he say and then like she's a bite older she's like twenty eight or something and she just wouldn't let him pay for anything so like and she'd book him on all these tour and stuff and she wouldn't let him pay her back
S0363	try and be a bite like a toy boy
S0336	yeah so he basically get keep it be really weird he say he have a great time and obviously he get to see some cool things but he say it be weird but always come back with these stories he go to like i think he go to no maybe berlin actually he go go somewhere with some friends some uni friends maybe and erm he come back say that he'd like basically meet this girl on the street and end up bring her back to their like kind of hotel room suite whatever and end up have sex with her in the bathroom and i be just like like why and like he even like regale the fact that like they be to get to it as he as he phrase it and erm they realise they didn't have a condom so they actually then go out back into town on the hunt for a condom
S0363	well at least he be smart
S0336	yeah
S0363	that way
S0336	it's a bite of a mood killer that though isn't it
S0363	little bite
S0336	yeah erm but yeah he always have stories it's quite funny he's on tinder now as well which be hilarious
S0363	well meet a guy on tinder and she's still date him
S0336	oh right my cousin be date a guy off tinder and my friend be in a relationship with a guy she meet on tinder like it happen
S0363	well i get it though a little bite more because well not get it that sound wrong but for instance well she's she she obviously didn't know anyone from her primary school or anyone from uni there
S0336	yeah
S0363	so it work quite well but also it's give you the chance to bump into that person locally without need fate to help you i suppose
S0336	yeah it be nice in as much as like even though that it's bad that it's like do it's like
S0363	yeah
S0336	sometimes it take away the like cos you know like and have get themselves into situations where they're talk to someone online they don't really fancy them but they're really nice or whatever and then they go on a date and they're like i didn't really fancy them and it's like well that's just a whole waste of your time at least if like initially you know like yes i fancy you
S0363	and then
S0336	it's a step in the right direction then isn't it cos if you get on then you know they already like like the look of you
S0363	yes yes yes yes
S0336	apart from there's obviously people on tinder that just go yes
S0363	yes yes yes yes yes erm but also like i what i don't like be the fact that well it's it's because it's convenience again
S0336	yeah
S0363	don't have a inner world where you have to go to dance you don't
S0336	exactly
S0363	those
S0336	and like we live in a world where like a lot of guy do just go out to pull and it's really hard to decipher between those and the people that be actually look for a girlfriend or something a bite more serious
S0363	yeah or once you know where they do pull
S0336	yeah
S0363	might be something else
S0336	easy world but i'm sure he'll meet someone but he's just like he's at a he's at a really weird point in his life where i don't think he really know like what he want so he doesn't know if he want to stay in and like all this kind of stuff
S0363	he seem like he's live on the edge on the start of an adventure like try to do all these different things
S0336	yeah it's really nice to see actually cos for age he be just like properly squirrelling money away like cos he pay a little bite of rent at home but not a lot and he doesn't have a lot of outgo so he be save like five hundred pound a month just like literally squirrelling it away like before he know it he have like fifteen grand and he be like oh i've get a deposit for a house blah blah blah and i be like that's great but like be you sure that's what you want and like since go to manila i think he's just realise that that's not what he want like
S0363	he hasn't spend all of it
S0336	no
S0336	but he go
S0363	he spend five of it
S0336	yeah he basically do turn round he buy himself a new car and he's be go on all these holiday and he want to travel and he want to do things so i can't really blame him like it's what it's what be young's for isn't it really yeah yeah i haven't see the girls in age
S0363	no no
S0336	be texting a bite because obviously she's be move so i've be like try to track her down so i'm hopefully see her next week but i think she's just have i think it's be really stressful cos i know like when i'm when i what i kind of like catch up with her before christmas she have so much stuff plan in january with it be cost her a small fortune and it be so she know she wasn't go to have any money and then she have all the stress of like look look for well look at house and stuff and they're talk about put like reservations on plot and all this kind of stuff and then she just be really stress last time i speak to her she just say 's an idiot with money as well which you kind of see like
S0363	yeah
S0336	he doesn't i don't think he pay rent to live at home so he's just get use to kind of like
S0363	have load of disposable cash
S0336	yeah and just do whatever he want
S0363	what do he do again
S0336	he work at erm travelex something
S0363	oh
S0336	so he won't be on huge money anyway but i think she be just get a bite annoy cos she be very much like pay for everything like
S0363	yeah
S0336	and and when they're talk about like save for a house and all this kind of stuff like she's already basically admit she know that she's the one that'll have to pay the deposit and she's just get a bite annoy that 's still go out and do whatever he want and not really acknowledge that
S0363	do they definitely want to do it then or
S0336	i think so all it's all a bite it's a bite strange anyway like sometimes when you hear them talk like they like come round to have a look at the house at one point erm and we be chat about stuff and he be ask like what come with the house and all this kind of stuff and like they couldn't even agree like really stupid like obviously our din room be technically in our live room so it's carpet
S0363	yeah
S0336	and erm be like i really like this you know i think i think carpet be like underrate like they're just so much warmer like it's nice to have carpet like underfoot and be like no way you're have a carpet anywhere in our house like like maybe upstairs but nowhere downstairs be go to be carpet because you just can't be trust and i be just like wow oh this bode well when you can't even agree on this
S0363	mm true
S0336	and then think about it and think well no like to be fair like 's house never be carpet downstairs like she's always she's always go for like a hard floor
S0363	yeah
S0336	because she know like she know she like host and all that kind of stuff and carpet be just dangerous erm and i'm think of like 's house like be a brand new house that she's get the whole of the downstairs like vinyled like or carpet but it's funny that they couldn't even agree on that i think this bode well
S0363	strange
S0336	anything new with you or not really
S0363	no
S0336	same old
S0363	oh mum do i tell you mum and dad have book a family holiday
S0336	no

S0336	yeah
S0363	let's splash out so that's what we're do so we'll get back monday night or something
S0336	yeah
S0363	have to make dinner for everyone
S0336	will it get competitive
S0363	that's what i say i want to go first
S0336	yeah set the bar
S0363	set the bar high erm so that that will be really that's really excite erm cos i be really panic cos i tell you before i be panic about all these holiday we've get to take
S0336	yeah
S0363	but they've do it and it's like
S0363	i think it's fine but i've still get a few days leave so
S0336	yeah
S0363	i've get take for a hen do
S0336	yeah i'm really like i'm really irritate by that thread but i feel rude if i leave but it's really annoy
S0363	i know i saw the one that erm put up the other day and i be like oh that's go to irritate
S0336	yeah
S0363	i just could feel it
S0336	yeah
S0363	like i could i could sense that they won't put it and they just put a it's happen to me
S0336	yeah
S0363	i be like they don't wanna do that or
S0336	well i think it's also the case of like they they
S0363	plan on top of their plan
S0336	yeah and they've make the mistake of sort of say oh there's not much to do around the area so people be kind of go like oh what about this what about that but what they should of do be kind of just hold off
S0363	yeah
S0336	there's no need to put that really like cos i
S0363	oh don't be polite just by say if you've get any options it would be great and then not accept it
S0336	yeah yeah exactly like what they should of say i mean with a hen party as well i don't think people need to know miles in advance like you could of organise a load of stuff and then on the day be like if you wanna do this like a group of us be gonna go off and do this if you don't then you could do this or like if if they want to take control they should've take control but i i kind of think 's idea's kind of cute but
S0363	i like it
S0336	i think it's quite i don't know how she's go to
S0363	do it
S0336	organise it no
S0363	that's difficult cos the treasure the actual you've get to get out there and do it
S0336	yeah and like with clue and stuff how be you go to be able to organise clue until you've see the area like it's just a bite i mean i and also it doesn't sound like much of a group activity it sound like the kind of thing like you'd say to like oh you're go on a treasure hunt it just sound a bite bore like she's go on a treasure hunt and she get a prize but like what be the rest of us go to stand and watch like
S0363	yeah i hope we all get to go
S0336	yeah but we'll see i'm sure they'll have plenty to say about it all
S0363	just happy to get there when and just a nice house for a few days
S0336	yeah have if so you've get three holiday this year
S0363	i know it's ridiculous
S0336	that's so indulgent
S0363	yeah well it's not my fault my sister take a frigging week for her wed
S0336	i know christ it will be good you'll have a really good time though so much to look forward to as well this week this year will just fly by
S0363	i couldn't believe the other day i be like i know we be into february but i be like oh my god it's already the fifth of february i mean where do this week go
S0336	yeah and feb's always such a short month anyway so it just doesn't hang around very long
S0363	no it's crazy i be just like i think it must be like the first or second the fifth february and i look at the date and i be like for god's sake
S0336	i don't know where we're go
S0363	oh no you keep go
S0336	okay
S0363	you turn off at d
S0336	at d okay
S0363	yeah
S0336	it's it's be age since i've be over it's so bad i've just get so use to to see me like it's like so
S0363	why do you flash him
S0336	i be try to
S0363	oh
S0336	it's not my car i don't know where everything be
S0363	erm i've be do this route like this be the way i'd go if i be go to coventry so
S0336	oh okay
S0363	like i've be up here a few time this week
S0336	yeah yeah like be they i mean they come to a lot so i've see them you know if they've be to see or they've be to see i've like tag along and stuff so i i feel like i've see them load in the last year but i definitely haven't be out to see them which be bad it just do seem like a mile away
S0363	it be a mile away really
S0336	yeah i can see why they've do it like it must be nice for them to be closer to work and stuff
S0363	yeah absolutely i still find that i'm the one that to text them if i need to do something
S0336	yeah
S0363	which surprise me cos i think they
S0336	yeah like i don't know i don't know when when they do stuff with i don't know who it be that get in touch to be fair but i don't know whether they like they're so remove out here that they almost think like
S0363	no one
S0336	no and it's hard as well because like they're not the kind of people to host stuff like if i want to see you i'd probably say oh come round for dinner
S0363	yes
S0336	and like but they're not those people be they they'd be like oh guy shall we go for dinner
S0363	yeah
S0336	i don't know why they don't like cook i think they could be good at it
S0363	i don't i think they they wouldn't have anywhere to host it
S0336	but like you just make do don't you
S0363	yeah
S0336	yeah so tell me about 's new boy
S0363	oh yeah so erm his name be and he's thirty seven
S0336	okay
S0363	and he have two kid
S0336	okay
S0363	but not marry never marry the lady
S0336	okay
S0363	they just separate
S0336	yeah
S0363	last year they've be separate now for over a year i think
S0336	okay
S0363	and erm she really really like him and she she never say it about
S0336	yeah
S0363	yeah she really really like him and then i be like she say cos i be talk to her the other day about the holiday and stuff and erm she say about oh 'll probably come i don't know if he'll come for the whole week if he'll come up
S0336	yeah
S0363	he say that sound really cool and erm i be like how's things go she be like really good now like he's erm he's get a new little apartment which sound nice she's spend time there and she's get stuff there
S0336	ah
S0363	and i say oh she say i think i need to introduce him a bite earlier this time she say we're not technically official but we basically be
S0336	yeah
S0363	i say oh bring cos dad want to a meal well dad doesn't which really surprise me have all but want to organise a big meal for dad's sixtieth
S0336	yeah
S0363	like sunday the twenty eighth or something like that and erm he want us all to come and i say why don't you bring him to that she's like yeah i think i might do do you think it will be a bite full on i say whatever you do it's always gonna be full on
S0336	yeah
S0363	so
S0336	i think it's almost better to introduce somebody in an like on an occasion like that because they don't get bombard by like one person like you know if you literally just
S0363	yes
S0336	if she just bring him home it would be very personal like meet
S0363	parent
S0336	her parent and stuff whereas like when you when there's a massive group of you like that like you just have little conversations with people and even though there's a lot of people to take in like it's not serious you don't
S0363	yeah
S0336	people aren't like oh so you know tell me your life story like over dinner that's excite
S0363	yes and he look really nice
S0336	yeah
S0363	i've see a picture of him so you know it's this turn on the right erm
S0336	i i don't think i don't think i i don't think i'd be put off by somebody have kid
S0363	and i know i not any more i say to
S0336	i think it's change hasn't it
S0363	i think what i say to be because he be thirty seven erm and she say oh he he say he'd still be open to get marry cos he never marry before obviously
S0336	yeah
S0363	all i say the only thing i would be conscious of be that would he have more kid cos like you'd want to have kid
S0336	yeah
S0363	but obviously it's not something you want to do as an open line
S0336	no
S0363	but then you don't wanna get too far down the line and be like oh
S0336	i'm sure that's you'd like to think that's something he would pick up on though
S0363	yeah i think so
S0336	even if you've get kid if you're if you're with a younger person you have to anticipate that they might want kid themselves
S0363	yeah she be like joke about cos joke about obviously about nearly be thirty
S0336	yeah
S0363	she's a year away from it i suppose and erm blah blah blah that she wouldn't be single forever and whatever and she's like oh no i might just suddenly i just have two kid
S0336	yeah you never know how life turn out do you have she meet the kid
S0363	you don't no which i think be good
S0336	i think that's good as well sound like he's do things properly
S0363	yeah i think he's quite smart
S0336	yeah
S0363	both boys
S0336	that be my that be my biggest like begrudge of like people like when she get involve with people that have kid be just that like she become such an integral part of that kid's life
S0363	yeah
S0336	that the breakup wasn't just break up with the dad it be break up with the kid as well which be just horrible
S0363	yeah which be what i'm try to explain to you know who come around the other day whose get
S0336	yeah
S0363	girlfriend trouble
S0336	oh yeah
S0363	she's get a kid i be like she be probably keep you at arm's length because when you be there nearly all the time it be her son ask where you be and ask where you'd be and when you be come round
S0336	yeah
S0363	you know you've already start and she probably keep her life with
S0336	so what be the drama like
S0363	i think that he she just need her space
S0336	oh right
S0363	and she want to spend some more just one on one time with her son when she have the chance to rather than have him there as well
S0336	yeah
S0363	cos i can i can totally get that
S0336	yeah
S0363	but i say to just you know give her that time and like when it get to ridiculous amount of months or whatever
S0336	that way
S0363	yes god i haven't be this way
S0363	and then at the bottom of here you turn right erm i say the the only thing i say be don't worry about it for a while and if it get like ridiculously long be a bite like really serious it's better
S0336	yeah
S0363	but you don't want to push that thing you don't rush that thing like just focus on you and her for a while
S0336	he need he need he need to be a hundred percent sure that he's commit to that as well
S0363	oh he be
S0336	he be
S0363	he totally be
S0336	good that's quite sweet
S0363	he be oh god so much he like take him swim on his own he's like totally into it he like wear his heart on his sleeve this guy bless him like he want to always give so much that he can
