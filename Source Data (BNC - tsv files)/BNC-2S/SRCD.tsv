S0588	that's why we have things like plan permission which council don't take any notice of cos they install ugly concrete block randomly without ask anybody but there be that point in history where beer be safer to drink than water
S0589	yeah
S0588	oh those duck look so sweet bob up and down would probably be quite fascinate to look at them yes mm
S0589	ah cos we don't rarely very often open the curtain in the snug but i have them open during the rugby and so straightaway he get up to have a look out and his little eye
S0588	ah
S0589	be so bright
S0588	yes he's
S0589	his little chin
S0588	mm but he start
S0588	like the film we be watch when it
S0589	yes
S0588	have the rat on it
S0589	yes
S0588	he get quite into it at that point
S0589	yes mm
S0588	that's so funny i'm surprise they actually see things on television you'd think they'd sort of not be able to
S0589	well they're not see what we be see but he's see small things
S0588	yeah
S0589	move quickly which be
S0588	yeah
S0589	like a scurry creature well this be a success wasn't it darling
S0588	mm
S0589	it's not the best beer but erm
S0588	i'm enjoy it
S0589	it's greene king so this must be a greene king pub sort of you er normally hear it that way round
S0588	it's very nice to see the thames properly and london properly like this i do think you see london better from the point of view of the thames you really get a sense of the history
S0589	we should take a picture of the pub and we'll send it to cos she's a fan of thames side pubs now
S0588	well i mean this be something that we should bear in mind for meet because she could come from her direction and we could come from our direction it's take me all this time to actually get round to do this i cannot believe that that's bloody full time work thing look at all those seagulls on that pier there's a whole gather of them what's a gather what be the collective noun for seagulls
S0589	dunno probably flock but it might not be
S0588	oh of course it be but that's when they're fly isn't it no no it's really i seem to there's a flock now they're fly do that mean they're fly what about when they're sit it would seem like another word would be more appropriate than flock a gather a meet there's the dlr
S0589	yes there it be darling
S0588	there it be it's go to that's the one we get from
S0589	okay let's crack on

S0589	and then
S0588	i find
S0589	no because they're just potter around you'd be under pressure to go to the beach with me during the day i suppose but then then you'd just sit in the
S0588	mm
S0589	so then you've just get to erm
S0588	mm it's not just that
S0589	to cope with
S0588	it's the walk between place where people aren't
S0589	then you've just get to
S0588	bother about the sun and stuff where i be
S0589	then you've just get to cope then you've just get to cope with the actual journey there
S0588	yeah
S0589	and back
S0588	that's what i'm say
S0589	but potentially of course
S0588	but that's that's potentially very
S0589	potentially you could get
S0588	damage
S0589	drop off in the car then pick up
S0588	mm
S0589	gosh we'd manage you
S0588	i don't know it's really hard and especially when keep bloody ask i i just think oh stop fuck ask

S0589	well you won't get much more industrial landscape than this dear
S0588	it's cool oh it's not actually i want to be we've lose the thames when do we get back to it
S0589	that way
S0588	that's a con
S0589	we're near enough
S0588	they say it be a thames walk
S0589	i think we're near enough
S0588	we're not near enough
S0589	take my arm dear i'm sleepy
S0588	that's the beer
S0589	yeah it must be
S0588	we're not near enough can't call it thames walk and then make you walk how many metres away from it be we would you say ten
S0589	twenty
S0588	i've get a brain train game a sort of distance and it go
S0589	oh you'd be terrible at that darling
S0588	and you have to put them order yeah but the thing be
S0589	uhu
S0588	it wouldn't be as difficult if they hadn't change yards into no feet into bloody yards and then you've metres and then you've get well it's about change the old measurements into the new measurements which be bloody doubly confuse isn't it i mean you could get your head around measurements but dunno about old measurements and then you've get ounces and er grams and they're go and i haven't get a fuck clue it's order of so you put it in an order so they'll say something like six ounces and then they'll say i dunno five hundred grams
S0589	that would be difficult
S0588	and yeah it thank you it be difficult and especially if you well no we're we're er of the age where we have both so i mean we're suppose to know but i'm more in the ounces world than the grams world i must admit
S0589	i'm more grams
S0588	be you yeah
S0589	five hundred grams
S0588	cos er you're that much younger than me you see
S0589	half a pound ish
S0588	but i'm now move into grams more obviously cos things tend to be grams now
S0589	darling at least you don't get ask how much be a cup and a half
S0588	oh for fuck's sake how on earth do you get your head around that one
S0588	i've reject all book that be measure in cup i'm sorry i'm not there's enough to deal with in life without fuck cup it's not like a cup be a cup a cup be a cup if it's a liquid a cup if it's flour a cup if it's something else how fuck ridiculous be that just have one bloody weight please
S0588	or one weight for liquid and one weight for which be the british millilitres or
S0589	millilitres
S0588	hold on though be the weight
S0589	a fluid ounce you get
S0588	yeah so it's the same it's an ounce or it's a fluid ounce but it's the same if you be no be it the same
S0589	what not by volume no
S0588	oh why isn't a liquid just weigh in ounces why be it fluid ounces i know it's fluid but why be it not the same
S0589	i love these little
S0588	be it cos it's a lot heavier
S0589	well some things be oil would be heavier than water cos it's
S0588	oh there be so many things in life to learn i don't mind learn it it's just it's never do be it
S0589	look darling it's a little miniature railway
S0588	yes sweet where be we head now
S0589	gosh look you can see look at all the cement that fall off
S0588	yes
S0589	in those big pile they look like termite mound

S0589	it annoy me we're not
S0588	no i know
S0588	we i'm just be funny and go
S0589	look
S0588	we're look at another thingamajig
S0589	look
S0588	oh look at that one
S0589	there's so much spillage darling it's create a little sandbank
S0588	yeah so
S0589	that will be the wind the wind blow it off onto this pathway it's industrial waste effectively it's just sand
S0588	yeah i don't know what think of us today it's like where the fuck have they go
S0589	yeah i be think earlier on
S0588	he's gonna go off on a
S0589	a he would quite like to explore
S0588	awol
S0589	that factory we've just be past
S0589	and b this be well outside his normal roam territory
S0588	it be if he live here he'd quite enjoy it and he would enjoy look at the duck careful er what be wrong with use your fuck bell sorry darling
S0589	i think you're a bite tipsy
S0588	yes
S0588	sorry darling half a pint and i'm fuck shout at cyclists there's another signpost thames path greenwich peninsula east mm greenwich cutty sark be two and a quarter miles so that's
S0589	look darling here's a little er erm shipyard there's little sail boat that would be pretty
S0588	i wish people would use their bell you nearly get run over then
S0589	i know you worry about me would have punch the live daylights into him and then throw his bike into the thames would you have report me to the police
S0588	er for what
S0589	no beat him senseless and then throw his bike in the thames have he strike you for instance
S0589	i would have be merciless
S0589	in my revenge
S0588	ah really nice no i don't like the way they call it a thames path and then
S0589	ah this the yacht club so there be a pub call the yacht or at least a bar but it might be this place here it's shut we've walk all the way to a yacht club we've do well darling it's like be in er
S0588	yeah
S0589	oh look at this
S0588	we've do very well it's only two and a quarter miles to the cutty sark now
S0589	didn't be that the one that burn down
S0588	erm i think it have a couple of time hasn't it i mean it can't be the cutty sark any more if it's burn down twice er there's like one plank of wood that's leave of the original cutty sark
S0589	well that's like the philosophical question about the broom
S0588	well the it's the broom be a broom still a broom if you replace the end of it and then you replace the handle
S0589	be it the same broom
S0588	be it the same broom
S0589	the other philosophical
S0588	or be a girl band still a girl band
S0589	it's like that
S0588	if you keep replace the members
S0589	but the other philosophical question be
S0588	oh
S0589	which should we go darling right
S0589	be this a ship set out a wooden ship it's on a round the world voyage and of course during however long it take it repair itself so that by the time it get back to port none of the original bits be the same but be it still the same ship
S0588	no
S0589	cos normally you'd say yes
S0588	well oh god it's a really philosophical question though
S0589	but then oh but there's a secondary part of the question this be there's another ship that follow the first ship and every bite of wood they discard they cobble together to make a boat so be that which one when they get back be the
S0588	be the ship
S0589	be the ship that leave the so so when do this that should be a little er
S0588	yeah
S0589	bar the yacht club there
S0588	yeah it probably be
S0589	oh there's an old man that sail darling sweet he's not that old
S0588	he's not he's young
S0589	he's older than me
S0588	he's about the same age i think
S0589	look there's a bite of sculpture
S0588	oh yes
S0589	be there or do you have to be a member
S0588	yeah it doesn't look very public
S0589	well but there be the yacht
S0588	well it i don't know that would say the yacht though wouldn't it
S0589	it would make it more obvious yes
S0588	yeah
S0589	maybe it be up that bite
S0588	i wonder if 's in er another country at the moment
S0589	probably yes
S0588	there's something up there something riverside
S0589	i still get her email i'm back
S0588	yeah i do as well
S0589	or i get her text and i always reply thank god
S0588	yes
S0589	platinum
S0588	riverside
S0589	riverside they're gross they we'll have to look we've almost at the er
S0588	the dome
S0589	we're not though cos i think it just double right back and then come right
S0588	do you think that's an illusion
S0589	yeah i think so
S0588	i've never actually be to the dome
S0589	i go to the
S0588	i've be past it many time
S0589	i've be once to go to the brits launch party
S0588	to think they be just gonna build it and then knock it down again i mean how ridiculous be that
S0589	little activity centre oh there's the peninsula
S0588	oh sweet
S0589	ecology park
S0588	yes there it be look
S0589	nice
S0588	yes
S0589	look both ways so actually we could have walk all the way round that maybe
S0588	it's quite sweet
S0589	it's just basically it's just weed bed then
S0588	it there's lot of wildlife in there
S0589	loud industrial noise aren't there
S0588	yeah that's that boat make that noise
S0589	be it
S0588	what be oh it's a er
S0589	dull isn't
S0588	customer centre for the flats
S0589	yeah well royal greenwich it ain't look i mean they could have build something like that which be actually pretty horrible isn't it dear
S0588	yeah i mean there's actually not much difference
S0589	instead
S0588	between council flats and those
S0589	no
S0588	this be what always
S0589	and instead of the riverside
S0588	kind of make me quite
S0589	the riverside use lovely er bricks throughout even though it's not you know you wouldn't say it's architecturally
S0588	no they've do
S0589	amaze
S0588	a good job
S0589	but it's
S0588	definitely
S0589	it's alright certainly not an eyesore
S0588	yeah it's gonna be really nice i mean and it be really nice never be pier ah we can get the boat from there we could go either way we could get a boat then to for example yeah of course i might be out of action for a whole week after this walk i don't know what's go to happen i usually have to pace things but i don't feel like stop and it's get cold though
S0589	it's cold
S0588	it's colder than it be
S0589	i'm now glad i'm wear a woolly hat
S0588	yeah
S0589	cos have previously go go through a period of think maybe i didn't need one and now now i do
S0588	yeah
S0589	very glad i have
S0588	yep it's better than land in oxford street and then you've still gotta get home and you're knackered that be horrible
S0589	yeah strange
S0588	yep all strange very strange that's my general view be it's strange what be this fuck thing i've be
S0589	what be it good for
S0588	dump in it's all strange very clever but strange what's the next pub go to be
S0588	oh be that i think it be here
S0589	yeah probably that's the second longest walk last time would have be that cornish walk
S0588	oh my god
S0589	that you do not enjoy and you be like a troublesome twosome
S0588	oh my god
S0588	well you see that be my perfect example this be why i don't like go on holiday with families it's like what could i fuck do go no i'm not go
S0589	you want to watch telly
S0588	yeah i do wanna watch telly what the fuck's wrong with that it's a fuck holiday i don't wanna bloody
S0589	the hotel
S0588	wanna bloody
S0589	that's just weird
S0588	break my back on a holiday i be already work really hard oh but no get to go on this big long walk along the cliffs and but my point be how can i go no i'm not go i mean you can't can you hello
S0589	no
S0588	so there you go you can't so
S0588	to just go in the first place be a compromise cos you're gonna end up have to do stuff you don't want to do i mean actually stuff that's probably bad for you in fact cos if you're mean to pace yourself because of your energy level and all sort for example if you've get me or something
S0589	so look darling if we cross the river there's probably some of those weird like pontoon dock where the dlr stop
S0588	hold on the peninsula we've lose the millennium dome that's odd
S0589	straight ahead
S0588	oh there it be
S0589	they look like crane
S0588	so be we gonna see the peninsula go to the
S0589	it's also the
S0588	hold on be we gonna go that way there's a pier there the
S0588	that's the what pier be that greenwich no north
S0588	no north greenwich i think millennium dome yeah
S0589	no north greenwich be north of the river
S0588	oh
S0589	isn't it
S0588	can't remember the name of the pier
S0589	maybe not actually no you're right it be this side of the water actually
S0588	well north of the main greenwich presumably they're talk about
S0589	yeah
S0588	look there's a sculpture
S0589	yes i mention that already
S0588	oh
S0589	look at the lovely weed bank that's grow here
S0588	yeah
S0589	that look
S0588	very nice there's er lot of information here why be we go up here
S0589	get to be safe just this one then
S0588	safe from what
S0589	darling
S0588	yeah i don't think i want to go back yet
S0589	well we'll probably end up have a drink and supper
S0588	but i wonder where we'll end up how far would we make it i wonder suppose if we carry on and carry on we'd end up at bankside
S0589	could this be if i want to save a hundred and seventy six pound a month
S0588	yeah
S0589	and commute to work by do this walk
S0588	yeah
S0589	and i'd have to get up at sort of half past four
S0588	hold on though if you cycle how would you you'd go along here to where and then you'd you could go across the millennium bridge and then to holborn from there couldn't you
S0589	look here's this stupid thing
S0588	that nobody use
S0589	i don't think these
S0588	no it would be pretty exhaust but you could
S0589	i'd love to climb that ladder
S0588	you'd probably spend the money on food that you'd need for the energy the money you'd save up to two hundred pound a month probably how much be your travel card about a hundred and eighty isn't it
S0589	one seven six well it's probably go up actually it's maybe one eighty now
S0588	yeah as good as two hundred crazy that would be pretty knackering imagine reach the end of the day and you've still get to get all the way back no many time i've stop on the ferry on the clipper there be on the clipper there's one there they're amaze structure though i don't really know why they build it what be the idea
S0589	i miss it when you your arm look at that build darling with round windows mum would want to know exactly what that be
S0588	yeah
S0588	er loud no i want my arm free
S0589	it's nice and warm and secure
S0588	i know later on
S0589	couple like walk don't they
S0588	yes
S0589	it's mainly couple
S0588	ah
S0589	oh there's something call the meantime beer box
S0588	where be that a pub
S0589	yeah meantime
S0588	where
S0589	we should go there it might be quite fun
S0588	yeah where be it though i can't see it
S0589	it's in that behind those build there
S0588	oh not along the path
S0589	in fact i remember we once we once erm walk past it when we get drop off by and
S0588	yes that be i remember see that
S0589	yeah what's 's partner call again
S0588	where be the next pub i'm get tire
S0589	it's funny though if you think how long we've be walk yet when we jump in the car with granny you know we're we're only just beyond we're only beyond say the tk maxx or the b and q
S0588	yeah but it's a different world not drive
S0589	it's a different world
S0588	it's a different reality
S0589	a different reality
S0588	and your mum be firmly in the reality of drive
S0589	look here's the dome then darling we've never be there
S0588	and so many people be
S0589	be the closest you've ever be
S0588	and they only know the reality of drive
S0589	darling
S0588	yeah it be big umbrella where's the next pub i want to sit down look there's a clipper over there
S0589	yeah there it be
S0589	on the pier look here look darling here's another public artwork

S0588	no stop it
S0589	what go wrong there
S0588	i have decide i do not want to do that and you grab it anyway

S0588	er littles ones
S0589	like that
S0588	yeah
S0589	mainly be it girls tell off boys
S0588	erm yeah
S0589	that be sort of an observation you could have make
S0588	well that's not really about the language though

S0589	okay darling where cos that be the cos we wander when the dlr wasn't work that's where we get the bus from
S0588	that's where we get a bus from then it's good to know doesn't look like there's anything on the horizon literally and we've not eat either
S0589	er since that's where the bus for the talent
S0588	i need the loo
S0589	when you when you play the o2 darling that's where we'll they'll drop you off
S0588	yeah mm now i be get knackered
S0588	i mean it's sterile personally in my opinion
S0589	it's
S0588	if you're gonna build something you'd i mean
S0589	it's also a bore bite of the walk
S0588	yeah completely
S0589	there vip walk
S0588	i'm not inspire
S0588	when be i gonna be inspire again it's bore
S0589	get the no it go to down high street be i right
S0588	don't know yeah it sound familiar we could get god
S0589	that's what that big net be it's a fuck golf drive range in front of us
S0588	i go to a drive range once with my parent they be go to get into golf at one point but
S0589	i cannot imagine them
S0588	yeah well no the thing be it kind of fit their sort of erm their demographic do you know snobby middle class
S0589	right darling what be we do
S0588	i don't know what's that over there
S0589	be that the end of our walk or do we carry on go up
S0588	i want to go to one more place
S0589	well there's the meantime box
S0588	no that's not a place
S0589	why be it not a place
S0588	it's only a place for the beer it's not a place though
S0589	well then define what you mean by one more place
S0588	by the river

S0588	somewhere pretty and nice
S0589	look there's an irish dance festival
S0588	not a thing sweet not a bloody box on a main road that's not a place oh look like there's age before we get to a place though
S0589	well that's why you've get to make a decision
S0588	mm where do this bus stop go to
S0589	it's not a bus stop i think it's more of a shuttle service be it
S0588	dunno
S0589	probably
S0588	oh
S0589	don't know darling anyway i can't even see the thames
S0588	no

S0589	what
S0588	it's get a green sign on it no oh i just want to go to one more place this be crap i think it's a bite criminal to block it off like that
S0589	for a golf range and a car park i think we're probably gonna end up in the glass box at this rate anyway even though it's not a place it be somewhere warm
S0588	it's not a place
S0589	where we can go to the loo and
S0588	i mean be it even open

S0588	yeah i agree
S0589	that's where we be remember we catch a bus from here

S0589	oh the go to road oh fuck it's just pull out so do the i think darling
S0588	erm i think oh there go the what about well we're in the right place erm how about next time

S0588	we get a bus all the way to here and then we join the walk the thames walk
S0588	from here
S0588	yeah and do another walk
S0589	no the
S0588	yeah
S0589	oh there be it what else be there
S0588	we could go to
S0588	but i want to go back up to four that one would have do
S0589	go all the way to
S0588	if we go all the way to we could go somewhere in instead
S0589	i don't think so dear i don't think any of these help us
S0588	erm i'm happy to go to though i'd rather go to
S0589	you will but how long until that
S0588	we're here we've get a a choice of two

S0588	this be alright it's good
S0589	oh
S0588	get a nice fairly empty bus to
S0589	whoee

S0589	i don't think we're ever go to do that again
S0588	why not it be good
S0589	oh wasn't good enough to repeat though so
S0588	okay but i think we should do the next stage of the walk which mean get past
S0589	the o2
S0588	the o2 and get a bus to the o2 and past it and then join this walk again and then go i don't know really it's terrible plan really isn't it of mm london councils access to the river should be a give really in my opinion but no it's a bite like someone build on the land but they hog the river as well cos past here we could walk all the way to where i use to work and there's a little farm there do you enjoy that
S0589	yes darling thank you very much
S0588	mm be i be annoy now
S0589	i'm tire
S0588	yes it be quite tire at least you haven't get to go to work tomorrow
S0589	mm
S0588	er o2's horrible though isn't it
S0589	yeah
S0588	even what they've try to do there with the place to eat and stuff it be wasteland before wasn't it but it's kind of a wasteland sort of a wasteland another form of a wasteland i think we'll probably go past your brewery
S0589	yeah
S0588	then you
S0589	cos that wasn't it be it
S0588	no you can make a mental note of where it be for future reference so you wouldn't do that walk again then
S0589	not what the entirety of what we've just pub that's it pilot
S0588	oh
S0589	that be it
S0588	that look nice
S0589	well it's a fuller's pub which be a bite dull
S0588	it look nice though er er i do really want to go to one more place but
S0589	so look we'd walk up from there so you wouldn't go all the way round the dome and cut across the peninsula
S0588	right
S0589	that's that walk right down there and carry on down there until you get to the other side of the thames then you'll skip that great long circuitous route
