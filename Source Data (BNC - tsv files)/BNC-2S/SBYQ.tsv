S0086	he didn't say how it be but he didn't complain about it so although
S0082	i think that's the thing if if it be it's it's it's so disagreeable
S0086	yeah well yes i know cos you be complain quite loudly about it
S0082	i mean i don't think you realise how i mean it really be awful
S0086	yeah i've have it happen to me before but i suppose because it wasn't it wasn't happen to me on that phone
S0082	mm
S0086	it wasn't that bad
S0082	em
S0086	so
S0082	well i've have it a little bite at other time
S0086	mm
S0082	but it be so bad it be just like hear my voice like as loud as i be now
S0086	mm
S0082	um and then you've get the delay and i wasn't sure whether you what you be hear or what
S0086	mm
S0082	it be so bad you couldn't help say something so if if somebody doesn't say anything i think you can assume that it's not there
S0086	mm
S0082	i mean it i i'd be speak to you for a while before i actually realise that i hadn't hear it and
S0086	mm
S0082	you know
S0086	well finger cross maybe that's what it take to take the sim card out again
S0082	i mean i don't see
S0086	maybe it wasn't quite in
S0082	how these things work but um why that would make a difference
S0086	ah when i leave i'll call you from the car
S0082	yeah yes do that and um
S0086	mm
S0082	it's get an amaze cast but i think it's probably not a terribly good film
S0086	mm it's look like the sort of thing where they put the best
S0082	it's a bite cheesy
S0086	bits like in the trailer
S0082	yes and it's terribly cheesy i'm sure
S0086	mm
S0082	oh
S0086	it's go to be a little bite on the patronise side i think
S0082	oh yes
S0086	ah aren't these indian people lovely
S0082	mm
S0086	they're not uncivilised at all well i be have a very strange conversation with last night where she really sort of flag up her ignorance of some areas
S0082	mm
S0086	she she i think because she's she's twenty four but because she fell out with her parent when she be quite young she move out when she be sixteen so she grow up quite quickly
S0082	mm
S0086	so she give she give the big i be she be quite mature
S0082	mm
S0086	and she's very fiercely independent
S0082	right
S0086	but at the same time we be have a conversation and she be say she's on some charity board at work you know as a way of sort of get further ahead in the company and get involve in stuff
S0082	right
S0086	and then but she be say but our charity this year be something to do with africa and i say oh what be it be it cafod or you know oxfam or
S0082	mm
S0086	she say be it one of those big ones what be it amnesty you know what be it
S0082	mm
S0086	she like oh i don't know water aid you know name as many as i could she's like oh i don't know yeah probably one of those save the children oh i don't know then she say you know i'm go to sound really stupid but it's they're like alien to me it's so far away and i say
S0082	right
S0086	but the but the surely right like now that current day because of the fact that the world do seem smaller all the time you know in the way that we communicate and the way that we be see people in other countries
S0082	yes
S0086	in television or other kinds of media it's sort of make it seem smaller not further away
S0082	yes i
S0086	but the gulf between
S0082	mm
S0086	how we live and how they live be grow all the time
S0082	mm
S0086	you know they're they're get poorer
S0082	mm
S0086	as we get
S0082	yes
S0086	richer effectively the west as a whole and um she be say i just can't understand it i'd rather give money not i'd rather look after my own but she say at least i can see a direct um consequence to us donate money i think she's it's sound like they probably just haven't explain where the money be actually gonna go because
S0082	but that's pathetic though
S0086	well i agree and i do talk her down and i say she do i do say well they probably someone you know and they give clean needle they provide clean water or you know
S0082	uh mm
S0086	they probably do a multitude of things um and she say no i can't just i just can't see how it's actually go to help people i say well that's that's silly i say it a lot of it have to do with the desensitisation of the television as well
S0082	mm
S0086	like you see these image and it's completely heartbreaking and then it's go and then you've get a car car advert
S0082	mm
S0086	you know it do sort of it only stay with you for a matter of moments i say don't you remember like the live aid you know that be only a few years ago and their campaign be the fact that you know in africa a child die every three second
S0082	uh mm
S0086	she like yeah oh yeah i'd forget all about that i'm think well yeah like out of sight out of mind that's the problem isn't it
S0082	it very much be
S0086	mm
S0082	in fact yes i mean
S0086	mm
S0082	that's that's certainly the case but to feel that they're so far away so it have no impact so and and
S0086	so therefore you might as well not do anything
S0082	and and and also the idea that you wouldn't give to charity if you couldn't see where it
S0086	mm
S0082	what it be do
S0086	that be her and actually that's your own ignorance because you don't understand something cos i say well in that case why don't you find out much more about it cos it's probably do a good thing
S0082	exactly
S0086	like can't you see it's a charity and it's help people
S0082	yes
S0086	so why if you're on the board and you didn't know why didn't you ask
S0082	it would take it would take five minutes on google to find out what the charity be and
S0086	mm
S0082	what it's do
S0086	or ask the people if they be make the announcement in the meet
S0082	yeah
S0086	right this be go to be a charity why not say okay well i'm sorry i don't know who they be
S0082	tell us more about it yeah
S0086	and what they're do
S0082	yeah
S0086	it do seem very strange
S0082	yes
S0086	and she say why don't they help themselves and i think right don't you sound like a daily mail reader now
S0082	ooh
S0086	she say well then how come we've get so civilise in the west and they haven't get civilise there
S0082	oh god
S0086	and i think oh god
S0082	oh my god
S0086	oh no so i have to you know sort of talk her down but i think the worry be with her be she just she just you know she if she can't see it then she doesn't want to understand it
S0082	that's that's well that's the case with a lot of people i think
S0086	mm
S0082	and there be this perception which the west have do nothing to try and challenge that the west be civilise
S0086	mm
S0082	and everybody else isn't
S0086	well that's what i say do you not see soldier go into countries now and pillage and rap nothing's have really change when what make us what how do that make us humane
S0082	yeah
S0086	than people in those countries
S0082	what's what's civilise about that
S0086	and in fact we actually all come from africa we come from them
S0082	mm mm
S0086	you know and the reason be we've we've she say well why be their land so uninhabitable that's their own fault they should move and i say well not really actually they're really poor they've get nowhere to move to that be their land and if we help them
S0082	also the fact the fact that um a lot of africa be fertile land
S0086	mm
S0082	um and it's become lesser because um if land be clear
S0086	mm
S0082	um then you get um what do they call it um i can't remember what they call it now um but when it do rain it actually wash all the top soil away because there's no vegetation
S0086	oh god mm
S0082	or there's very little because it's all be um i mean you know we're talk about decades of drought
S0086	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0082	where it use to be fertile
S0086	mm
S0082	um but with um where land be clear for graze
S0086	mm
S0082	and then you have drought and then when you have rain it wash the top soil away so there's nothing you have you haven't get sort of um fertile land for things to grow on to sort of recover from that
S0086	yeah
S0082	so um it's there's a there's a whole range of things
S0086	well absolutely and plus i mean she say why they don't do anything to help themselves i say well actually you know there there be
S0082	and and that's not true
S0086	that's not true and also you know the problem be you see this thing this with charities all over the place where the money be just actually not filter down and that's because the charities aren't actually be regulate in the same way that maybe they should be look at the fund of money go to haiti
S0082	also you do have to deal with you do have to deal with corrupt
S0086	yeah
S0082	um governments
S0086	well in cuba the money never actually the majority of money that actually go into the country doesn't reach the people but they're all cater for
S0082	mm
S0086	they've all get a basic live allowance but they could have more
S0082	mm
S0086	but because they they live in a socialist country
S0082	mm
S0086	their their government the people the clothe they're get for example and then they sell them off
S0082	mm
S0086	to another third world country and make profit and then keep the money for themselves
S0082	mm
S0086	in haiti they're still live in shanty towns new orleans they're still live in shanty towns
S0082	i know
S0086	they're still live in tent under the subway
S0082	because the money the money isn't go to where it should
S0086	no it's not and you think well that's the big reason it's it's
S0082	corruption be be a huge thing it it will always happen vest interest you know
S0086	mm
S0082	so when you do get a disaster the money that go in will be will be put into project that you know um government or big corporations or you know developers
S0086	mm
S0082	will have a vest interest in in choose this route
S0086	yeah yeah
S0082	rather than you know just actually kind of hand it over and help the people that really need it i mean there's always a kind of there's always an element of that
S0086	mm
S0082	so the people on the grind don't actually benefit from that
S0086	mm
S0082	and that and that happen whether it's you know america or africa
S0086	oh absolutely yeah
S0082	so there's no difference there there's corruption everywhere there's vest interest everywhere
S0086	mm that's what i be point out about new orleans
S0082	mm
S0086	and try to make it so that it's not them and us
S0082	mm
S0086	you know i think a lot of it be just ignorance and i
S0082	mm it be
S0086	you know i'm ignorant to a lot of i as well
S0082	mm
S0086	but i think i try and read about stuff at the same time
S0082	well yeah and be open to it
S0086	yeah
S0082	absolutely
S0086	i reckon i'm a bite of a goldfish if i watch something or read something in the newspaper i think oh i don't really understand that
S0082	mm
S0086	i try and investigate it i might read a book or i might go online or i might read the paper and in that period of time i try and understand it and then i think or then something else come along
S0082	yeah well that's the same as all of us
S0086	that's sort of the nature of it but this idea that oh i don't understand it therefore i don't want to engage with it
S0082	mm
S0086	they're far away therefore
S0082	mm
S0086	i shouldn't give them money mm
S0082	there's also um you've get things like small farmers who try and sell this be quite a big thing that that be um we be sort of things be explain to us at the time of remember the drop the debt thing in two thousand
S0086	mm mm
S0082	um the world health organisation and the world trade organisation people like this you know they're set up to sort of provide um kind of help and sort of
S0086	mm
S0082	an oversee kind of role
S0086	mm
S0082	but they're hugely corrupt as well
S0086	mm hm
S0082	and and and even if they're not you know the balance be be out
S0086	mm
S0082	i mean they're there to sort of oversee like fair trade and trade agreements between countries and continents
S0086	mm
S0082	but actually the balance be always tip in favour of the rich countries the the western countries
S0086	mm
S0082	and the very large corporations i mean monsanto have a huge clout
S0086	mm
S0082	in place like this so all the market where you know the small farmers would want to bring their produce and trade them
S0086	mm
S0082	and which have be do for centuries they're actually have to compete now with european or american um goods that be import into into africa
S0086	mm
S0082	and sell at a fraction of the price in african market where their own farmers can't sell their own stuff
S0086	mm
S0082	because it's all to do with um trade balance and the trade agreements you must allow um the us and europe to um export to you you must have you must take these in
S0086	mm
S0082	in order to um you know all these trade agreements be set up
S0086	mm
S0082	so they're have to accept cheap import which mean that their their own farmers can't sell their own produce
S0086	oh
S0082	in order to make a live it's completely ridiculous outrageous
S0086	mm
S0082	but it's all to do with this you know we must have trade trade be good but who have the power to say what this trade agreement be you know
S0086	mm
S0082	you must accept x y and z and we will take a b and c
S0086	yeah
S0082	and it's it's the corporations and it's the it's the uk and us and european governments
S0086	mm
S0082	who make who have the power to say to to the wto
S0086	mm
S0082	you must you know this be what we're gonna do and you've get to agree to it
S0086	mm
S0082	and they do and you know the poorer countries have no say in the matter
S0086	no
S0082	they have to accept it
S0086	it's all run by money isn't it
S0082	because they want to be able to trade
S0086	mm
S0082	but it's the balance be wrong so even even if they're do okay and they're produce goods you know they're up against the west in in that respect so
S0086	mm
S0082	it's not like they can actually help themselves because they're always come up against
S0086	yeah
S0082	more powerful and richer governments and corporations well
S0086	bloody hell
S0082	they're the same thing these days
S0086	mm mm
S0082	so it's it's like it's it's not even possible to do that even even if it if it have be in the past
S0086	yeah as you say who actually regulate that
S0082	most destitute people
S0086	yeah
S0082	be those who can't even fee you know if if they if they weren't grow enough to to be able to trade to sell it at least they could actually just fee themselves and their families but they can't
S0086	but they can't do that
S0082	because they live in the poorest areas where you know
S0086	they can't grow anything
S0082	there's there's no water and the the land be be poor and won't you know they can't grow anything so
S0086	mm
S0082	if they if they have money and could live somewhere else they could do it but they don't i mean they're at the bottom of the pile they have nothing how can they help themselves if they have nothing
S0086	mm it's sicken isn't it
S0082	yeah there's you know they say always if you work hard you can get on with your life when you've get nothing you know
S0086	and you've just get nothing and
S0082	you don't even have a a a cow or you know a house if you're live in a in a tin shack or you know
S0086	mm
S0082	how if you if you're that poor how can you work harder to get on
S0086	mm and you're up against such opposition as well
S0082	these people
S0086	as you say
S0082	absolutely they they work so hard for nothing
S0086	mm
S0082	for no return for you know how how be they suppose to get on
S0086	i know
S0082	that's a it's a ridiculous thing to even say
S0086	mm mm
S0082	anyway well good for you for challenge her but
S0086	well i'm not as um well read on the subject either but um it it do make it do alarm me just the i do want to challenge that attitude
S0082	yeah
S0086	like if it's not my country but it's not in front of me if i can't see the direct impact my money's go to give me
S0082	mm
S0086	i'm not gonna engage with it if i don't understand it then i'm not gonna try
S0082	mm
S0086	and understand it cos she give it the big i be oh i always i've get on of those brain like a really enquire brain and i know how things work i don't think that's actually the case and particularly worry because she want to join the navy which she will be great at actually but the worry thing be if she be quite close mind about other culture and other people and what's go on in other countries
S0082	that's the
S0086	you can't be in the navy
S0082	that's the kind of person they want
S0086	but that's what they like
S0082	that be they don't want people to question things
S0086	no
S0082	if you see soldier start to question things that's when they have breakdowns and that's when they leave and they
S0086	mm
S0082	have to do something else
S0086	they drill that out of you yeah
S0082	yeah basically they don't want people to think for themselves
S0086	no they want sheep
S0082	yes
S0086	even officer cos officer
S0082	oh yeah
S0086	officer don't have to be tell what to do it just cascade down
S0082	well well officer be usually from a class where they have that sense of superiority anyway that's kind of natural to them so
S0086	well yeah because they're this be this be why she be do it now this be the last year she can do it cos she's five years out of university
S0082	mm
S0086	you can only be an officer if you're within that five years
S0082	oh
S0086	because i think that um you know you've get those life skills that you would need
S0082	right
S0086	to go to university therefore you must be a cut above which be what they call rat which be your cannon fodder
S0082	yes
S0086	so if you're out if i want to apply which obviously i would never do i would go in as rat
S0082	mm
S0086	but the i mean the money's ridiculous i mean she go in when she's train for the first three months she's on twenty seven thousand and after that she's on forty
S0082	oh
S0086	disgust isn't it and there's people out
S0082	good god
S0086	out in afghanistan with you know malfunction kit and you think they're actually pay people around forty grand a year it's ridiculous and then they're but they're but they're um they're you know they're fire lot of people aren't they they're cut back
S0082	they be cut back
S0086	within the service
S0082	absolutely
S0086	so it seem strange
S0082	i know
S0086	why you would look at everything just across the board
S0082	mm
S0086	but she have her entry exam the other day and she pass so at this point she only have to do the medical which she think she'll probably pass
S0082	mm
S0086	even though she's get she's long sight or be she short sight be it when you can see you can't see here but you can't see over there that's short sight
S0082	yeah yeah
S0086	yeah so she's short sight um but the fitness thing be a bite of a worry cos she's she's not big but she just carry a few extra pound
S0082	mm
S0086	probably a size fourteen but she's be try to lose weight for age and she can run
S0082	mm
S0086	and when she go for the entry exam the guy say right at this point you know those of you have pass need to do this and this to get ready for your fitness then he say you should be aim to run a mile and a half in sixteen minutes well she's run it in fifteen and a half
S0082	oh that's very good
S0086	and you should be swim once a week and you should be you should be do weight train she say i've already be do that for three months because she know that be what they would require
S0082	okay
S0086	and he say okay so how fast be you run it and he she say fifteen and a half and he say and i don't mean to be rude but how heavy be you and she say however heavy she be maybe like thirteen fourteen stone and he say i cannot believe you know i trust what you're say
S0082	yeah
S0086	but i cannot believe that you at your weight can run and your heart can take it
S0082	mm
S0086	he say if you turn up for your medical now you wouldn't pass like if you send in your cos you have to send in a medical slip and then they look at it before they get you in
S0082	mm
S0086	and if they saw that she be fourteen stone but run it at fifteen and a half minutes they'd think she be lie and dismiss her out of hand so she so he say i'm not say this but you should lie and put down your the weight that you're aim for and then push and the longest you can leave it at this point be six weeks
S0082	right
S0086	before have to actually have the fitness i mean it sound mad and then and then at that point you have to do this um these practical
S0082	mm
S0086	train situations because she's go in as an officer with problem solve and you've get to get your team of across
S0082	mm
S0086	some issue and then you've get to go out run around in your pack but we watch the propaganda dvd that they send through and it horrify me everyone's run around and i think the thing be what concern me be she's not engage with the fact that she will potentially go to war
S0082	mm
S0086	if you're in the service obviously
S0082	yeah
S0086	that's what you have to prepare yourself for
S0082	yeah
S0086	she say no no no
S0082	she could be go over to the falklands
S0086	yeah again cos she be say um oh i just want to be on the boat i just want to work in logistics and i just i'll be safe on the boat and i say you're a sit target boat you know there be boat target
S0082	mm
S0086	um there have be and there will be um
S0082	so just tell her to look up i can't remember his name something
S0086	who be he
S0082	um he be terribly burn um
S0086	oh yeah
S0082	in one in in one of those ship that be hit during the falklands
S0086	yeah
S0082	it be something i can't remember his name
S0086	i know who you mean yes i've see an interview with him
S0082	yeah um i can't remember what the name of the boat be
S0086	do it begin with b
S0082	no that be the that
S0086	that be the argentine
S0082	the argentinean one that that we blow up as it be sail away
S0086	yeah and then she say it be a danger
S0082	maggie lie
S0086	yeah
S0082	she lie through her teeth oh
S0086	disgust
S0082	er the belgrano that be
S0086	oh that be that's it yeah
S0082	um i can't remember what the ship be call
S0086	well i think she's she's not be very realistic of what they're expect
S0082	mm
S0086	she's get no idea about modern history at all
S0082	the thing be in the middle east um you know where where the tensions be in the straits of hormuz
S0086	mm
S0082	that's where iran be block the ship
S0086	mm
S0082	so if the tension ratchet up there
S0086	yeah
S0082	more then we'll be send ship there
S0086	it will be the navy yeah absolutely
S0082	so tell her that
S0086	yeah
S0086	you're go to iran enjoy i couldn't imagine anything worse
S0082	i don't like people who just accept what their tell why you know
S0086	well that's
S0082	we should all think for ourselves
S0086	well that's the thing about her i would never have peg her as somebody i mean she's she's not you know she have a bite of a um an authority issue
S0082	mm
S0086	but i think she think that she's go in as a as an officer she could tell everyone else what to do but it's not go to work like that because ultimately you're within the regime
S0082	uh
S0086	so i don't know the good thing be you get three months and at that point at the end of the three months you get to decide whether you sign up
S0082	she'll probably love it
S0086	well i don't know i mean she's decide because she love water and she like technical things and she's speak four languages
S0082	mm
S0086	that she that it will be the perfect job but in theory
S0082	mm
S0086	if she be more engage with what she be actually go to be do i'd think yeah fine
S0082	mm
S0086	go right ahead but the fact that she's just not
S0082	mm
S0086	be realistic she's be quite naive
S0082	mm
S0086	sort of worry you a little although it would be a bad thing if she do move out of the house i like the girl and i'll miss her but it's all kick off with the spanish girls
S0082	be it
S0086	yeah
S0082	why
S0086	well a couple of weeks ago she and i go out drink and we come home quite late and we wake everybody up
S0082	that's right you you do yes
S0086	and it be awful and i be really embarrass
S0082	yeah
S0086	and i have never do it before
S0082	mm
S0086	and eh we apologise to everyone in the house the next day
S0082	mm
S0086	and we felt very guilty unfortunately a couple of days before we put a sign up on the kitchen door to ask everyone to shut it
S0082	yeah
S0086	behind them and 's boyfriend be leave really early so that be the point
S0082	yeah
S0086	where it's it all we have a conversation with her about it
S0082	it get tense yeah
S0086	yeah and it's be a bite frazzle ever since
S0082	mm
S0086	's since then a new spanish girl's move in you oh yes so be there that be her first week
S0082	mm
S0086	and she be incredibly heavy foot
S0082	mm
S0086	bang around everywhere
S0082	mm
S0086	um and her room be above 's room so i think hear her quite a lot and they have very different hours she's in quite late because she work in the college as well
S0082	mm
S0086	so she's in at half nine and cook dinner at ten o'clock just like doesn't think that ten o'clock to cook dinner be late
S0082	no
S0086	and she doesn't think that eight o'clock in the morning be early
S0082	mm
S0086	and doesn't
S0082	well you know eight o'clock isn't early
S0086	well no but it be if it's the weekend
S0082	well the weekend i suppose be different yeah
S0086	so the point be the door should be close up until ten o'clock which be what put on the door
S0082	mm
S0086	from ten pm unto ten be
S0082	mm
S0086	because you can all agree that that's you know if you want to have a lie in
S0082	that's fair enough
S0086	that's fair enough
S0082	yeah
S0086	but never shut the door behind her so if she's on late shift start at ten
S0082	mm
S0086	she might have a lie in the morning and so wake her up and every morning she's go in and say look can you keep the door close um and go yes so this morning she go absolutely mental because again about half eight be up and and they talk so loudly together
S0082	mm
S0086	be up so i don't really know why she kick off but she text me texted me say be you awake and i say yeah but you know i wake up quite early i be awake at eight
S0082	mm mm
S0086	and she's storm out of her room say to the spanish girls why don't you keep the door close people be try to sleep be probably asleep even though i wasn't
S0082	mm
S0086	and she say no she's awake and she say well you know she might not be you don't know that and keep the door close and it go and it just get really nasty
S0082	no
S0086	start shout back and then go mental and start shout and start shout
S0082	mm
S0086	and i think i'm not gonna wade in luckily 's go away for the weekend um but uh yeah it's pretty tense in the house now
S0082	oh dear
S0086	it's hard and 's live out some sort of jeremy kyle esque drama have i tell you
S0082	no
S0086	he start see a girl about a month less than a month ago and he be there every night for a week she's get two kid she's twenty nine and he's twenty six
S0082	mm
S0086	it turn out the father of her two children her ex husband have an affair with 's fiancee he know that she'd obviously his fiancee have an affair didn't know who the bloke be
S0082	mm
S0086	turn out it's this fellow this girl's ex husband so that's weird in itself
S0082	that's so
S0086	weird weirder still the the new girl hire the ex fiancee and they work in the salon together so they know each other when the craig's fiancee be have an affair
S0082	mm
S0086	with her boss's husband and now
S0082	okay
S0086	's date this this girl who's a little bite on the edge
S0082	mm
S0086	i think she's get some quite dark issue she's get quite a trouble past
S0082	mm
S0086	um and she just call it a day a couple weeks ago and now they're back together again but the but it's not even a month and he be say to me yesterday in the kitchen oh blah we be talk about weddings and i say i've get a few come up yeah i say yeah i've get a few in july and i probably i've get to pick a room at the hotel oh though oh that would be nice you know
S0082	mm
S0086	double double room he say yeah i've get the kid to consider and i be like what do you mean he say well you know it's not just me and jenna now it's it's us and i be like what be you talk about it's be a matter of weeks
S0082	mm
S0086	the fact that she so quickly and so readily allow you to meet the kid he stay over on the sofa one night and they just bowl in and he and that be after the first week
S0082	some women be just they just don't seem to care and they don't
S0086	i think
S0082	it doesn't bother them that their kid have a succession of uncles
S0086	it's really bad
S0082	but think 's it's quite rare in that in that respect
S0086	well i think that would be the standard you know that you'd put your kid first
S0082	some women be just some women don't
S0086	if you that desperate for a bite of male attention
S0082	i think so
S0086	that you lurch from bloke to bloke cos be say he get really annoy that lot of the ex men in her life be still good friends with her and they come around for wine of whatever and i say if you don't if you don't trust her then it's game over from the begin
S0082	mm
S0086	you're gonna have to trust her or
S0082	mm
S0086	if you think there's something not to trust have it out with her
S0082	mm
S0086	but the fact that she's so willingly allow her kid to meet him
S0082	mm
S0086	be a bite concern and how many blokes have there be before
S0082	mm yes
S0086	you know when it's just you that's fine you're a single woman you can do what you like but if you've get kid it's
S0082	no it's different
S0086	it's very different i mean i you know i don't want to judge but it seem a bite
S0082	it's a bite weird
S0086	it seem a bite strange so it's like jeremy kyle
S0082	yeah it be yeah
S0086	every day i would get a new instalment i don't need to watch tv ever say to me the other day what be you go to do when you move out you're go to have nothing to talk about basically just live tenuously through the dramas in my house
S0082	mm yeah
S0086	it's quite nice not to be at the centre of any of the dramas
S0082	yeah i mean it must be a bite wear
S0086	yeah yeah cos you wanna just come home in the even and not worry that people aren't talk to each other
S0082	yeah quite oh yeah yeah exactly wow
