S0231	probably yeah
S0198	but i think because it's a bank holiday it's busier when we get to dover they just as we arrive they
S0231	as the gate open
S0198	no as just as we arrive
S0231	erm
S0198	they literally we saw them open and then somebody come on to shift and then come back they be they be a guy really hot on it on the train
S0198	he he he get off at every stop and you'd see him look up and down and there be an announcement about go to the toilet and hide from train collectors and stuff
S0198	whereas normally i don't think they have them on on a sunday
S0231	no probably not no
S0198	cos they don't pay for i reckon cos the train be busy we have a bunch of people in there
S0231	that's what fuck
S0198	yeah they be loud as well

S0231	well about two years ago
S0198	what cos what do she get just what her dad's her parents' house be or
S0231	i think she have about two year ago i think she have about a hundred and ninety grand
S0198	in her account yeah
S0231	because they have to divvy up an house
S0198	yeah and top yeah some inheritance as well i guess
S0231	i mean she have sixty grand
S0198	yeah
S0231	but then they sell the house
S0198	she get half of that as well
S0231	but her brother buy i think he buy they be oh what be it they have about sixty grand each and they have a house for sale
S0198	mm
S0231	and her her brother want to buy the house
S0198	okay

S0231	every time you walk to the front door it be like brand new grass
S0231	just don't grow
S0198	fuck man people give that amount of money
S0231	yeah
S0198	they just
S0231	she think of everything i'm tell you
S0198	what what be the point in spend your money on that eh
S0198	just what about the house be she can she be it a council house
S0231	yeah
S0198	do she be she still entitle to have that even i guess she be if it's not
S0231	well she pay the cos over here now you've get her
S0198	pay the rent for it
S0231	you get a bedroom tax as well now
S0198	and so she have to pay for the extra bedroom that she get yeah
S0231	well it's a three bedroom house
S0198	yeah so if she hasn't get three children occupy it er two children
S0231	but once her inheritance go
S0198	yeah

S0231	fuck don't last a week
S0198	no
S0231	i normally like shower in cold water me
S0198	yeah do you have it you have a meter for them both do you
S0231	what
S0198	do you have like a top up card for them then like or a key or something how do you top it up
S0231	oh yeah yeah the gas and the key yeah er what you get down yours
S0198	i don't know i would like cos everything's on electricity we would like it to just have a top up key
S0231	you must have an electric key then
S0198	and then and then unless we just get one no cos you couldn't get one bill from all those different unless we just get one electricity bill
S0231	no you must have electric key
S0198	but that's good and
S0231	you just all you do be walk in the shop say look i want three quid on there
S0198	yeah
S0231	you slide it in the thing
S0198	pop it yeah and then you can watch it go down
S0231	yeah
S0198	that's a really nice way to control your bill isn't it
S0231	i mean long as there ain't no make sure there ain't no debt on the meter before you go and do it
S0198	oh so it minuses it off the
S0231	yeah and just
S0198	oh can it go into the minuses the meter then
S0231	if someone's get a debt on there already you wanna
S0198	yeah
S0231	make sure that
S0198	that it's pay by the company
S0231	well yeah say look i've just move in that debt ain't mine
S0198	how do you get the debt on it though cos it's do the electricity just cut off when you've run out of money
S0231	cos the well no you can go into the emergency
S0198	ah ah
S0231	same as the gas the gas be the worst one
S0198	just go into emergency
S0231	yeah and then if you leave it it just build up and build up it's like two p a day or something
S0198	ah
S0231	well if you leave that for like six months
S0198	yeah yeah so yeah i reckon
S0231	then to get out the emergency you're gonna need about fuck two hundred quid
S0198	yeah
S0231	then you've get your own gas on
S0198	yeah so yeah alright well
S0231	well ring me up when you get down there
S0198	yeah it be only electricity so we're hop it will help us manage our bill better cos i mean we're not gonna
S0231	oh i i tell you what
S0198	i don't wanna waste money like in the winter we're not gonna put the heat on or
S0231	if i could just have electric i would
S0198	run a bath yeah
S0231	i'm so fuck off with the gas
S0198	that's good to know and like you say like things like use the george foreman and stuff we're hop that will help us save some money too
S0231	oh yeah i'd rather do that
S0198	mm
S0231	if i have an electric cooker
S0198	i mean even so it should be cheaper anyway
S0231	i'd be mug up
S0198	we figure put on an appliance like a george foreman will cost less energy than heat up an entire cooker
S0231	yeah
S0198	even if they be both electric
S0231	it take what five minutes to heat it up
S0198	yeah ten minutes to cook your whatever
S0231	you can literally cook anything on it
S0198	yeah
S0231	it don't matter what
S0198	as long as it doesn't have a sauce
S0231	yeah
S0198	so it so it can't run off
S0231	or like a packet of pasta
S0198	yeah yeah i mean i don't care about that but anyway
S0231	but you just boil a kettle pour a kettle into a bowl and whack it in the microwave for seven minutes and your pasta's do
S0198	yeah cos i think
S0231	even if it say you can't microwave it you can
S0198	i think i'm pretty sure 's get us a microwave too not that oh erm have you ever try anything like bean in your george foreman
S0231	no you can't do bean
S0198	you can't
S0231	unless you get
S0198	you've never even try
S0231	the only other way you do it be you get two bits of bread
S0198	ah yeah like sandwich them together
S0231	put the bean in the middle whack the bread together just
S0198	make it yeah
S0231	and then yeah you'd have like toast
S0198	but it's still still on edge
S0231	yeah you can do it like that you can do toast sandwich in it
S0198	oh you could do some well good toasties on it like
S0231	yeah
S0198	let me finish this
S0231	i mean like the uncut bread
S0198	oh yeah
S0231	i have some i do like a few chunk with him this morning for him
