S0404	i i have a i have a theory that i just come up with right now
S0405	yeah yeah
S0404	perhaps the only way to get the perfect review be to have no expectations of the movie at all
S0405	yeah i mean
S0404	or
S0405	even even to the extent of not watch the trailers
S0404	yeah
S0405	i try sometimes
S0404	to you you have no no in depth knowledge of the movie
S0405	yeah
S0404	you have no no predestine concept ideas
S0405	concept
S0404	you i don't know maybe even go as far as to put them in the cinema and have them watch the movie don't even tell them the title
S0405	that that would be the fairest review
S0404	that would be the fairest review i believe
S0405	yeah that's why i don't like yeah
S0404	cos watch trailers hear
S0405	what your friends say
S0404	yeah hear from what your friends say hear from what the actors themselves say
S0405	yeah
S0404	maybe though eh it sort of create a a pre predestine ideal or expectation of the movie

S0405	ah beyonce no they erm there's arguments towards her erm her well i be talk to a female friend of mine she she dislike her speech because she's talk to the unite nations and yet she's complain about western feminine issue and yet you look at the middle east or africa where i don't know female genital mutilation women be still erm you know expect to be in the kitchen all day and they still be and they're they have much greater setbacks than we do here i mean women be still pay less on average than men here and women be still you know er objectify but
S0404	i really can't i just can't understand it do you know what do you know er the you know erm er the religion of islam

S0405	yeah
S0404	in the middle east and north africa
S0405	okay yeah yeah yeah
S0404	and er eventually
S0405	yeah
S0404	one of the caliphates
S0405	yeah
S0404	whose family name be the the be
S0405	yeah
S0404	hence the name

S0405	yeah
S0404	southern italy
S0405	yeah
S0404	they conquer all of that and it be during this time that christian er christian intolerance be reach its highest peak and level
S0405	right yeah because the crusade and stuff
S0404	yeah the crusade be do in like twelve hundreds
S0405	eleven eleventh twelfth century yeah
S0404	but caliphate be around in maybe eight hundred eight the year eight hundred
S0405	yeah okay
S0404	ad
S0405	yeah yeah
S0404	and erm
S0405	just check that yeah two minutes go on
S0404	yeah and the
S0405	yeah
S0404	at its greatest extent under the caliph i think his name be abu something
S0405	yeah
S0404	under his leadership the grow to become one of the wealthiest nations in the world a proprietor of a proprietor of science and maths and modern medicine
S0405	yeah
S0404	in fact some of the mathematicians in the contribute to things use in modern day mathematics
S0405	wow
S0404	and modern day medicine
S0405	yeah yeah things yeah
S0404	one of the first one of the first modern historians of the time be muslim
S0405	yeah that's great
S0404	and they promote religious tolerance back then
S0405	yeah
S0404	religious tolerance and now
S0405	i guess that's the confuse to it
S0404	and now islam be view as one of the most intolerant abusive religions in the world
S0405	i don't there be i i guess
S0404	it's baffle how it take such a turn
S0405	yeah i i yeah i know but i don't think it really have take that much of a turn i think it's just people's view of of what they think in the sense of like
S0404	maybe i'm romanticise it
S0405	yeah i mean maybe it it wasn't so great then and maybe things be still as they be now just people assume that be all course people assume all muslims be evil because they're erm backwards and ignorant
S0404	maybe not all people
S0405	no i mean some people believe that be what i'm say
S0404	yeah too many people believe that
S0405	erm still too many cos there should be none but
S0404	yeah
S0405	erm but yeah i mean it's a difficult issue because there'll always be i i'd say there be some legitimate arguments for for both side in almost any argument always two side of the coin
S0404	you know when we be at the mosque
S0405	yeah
S0404	i ask the erm the imam
S0405	oh the imam be crap but go on
S0404	i ask the imam er do erm do i have to follow the principles and fundamentals of islam
S0405	yeah
S0404	to go to heaven to go to your heaven
S0405	yeah good question
S0404	and he reply with the only thing you need to do be follow the rule of allah
S0405	yeah
S0404	and the islamic religion to get to heaven
S0405	yeah so
S0404	but then it hit me cos that be inherently flaw
S0405	yeah cos what about people who be never expose to islam
S0404	yeah what about what mother teresa
S0405	yeah
S0404	perfect example
S0405	yeah
S0404	one of the most selfless human be to have live in the twentieth twenty first century
S0405	yeah but there be erm there be erm i forget their name but there be christian sects that believe that there be special place there's a special place in heaven for people who erm of other faiths who who you know i mean how can that be fair when tribesmen in in the jungle would have never they can't speak english or any modern language
S0404	i just find it so yeah
S0405	and and the concept of what islam be be force to go to hell cos they don't follow the teach you know so
S0404	yeah it's not fair but the
S0405	most religions aren't like that most religions be you know there's a special place
S0404	yeah sikhism sikhism i don't know about sikhism it just teach that er you just have to be a good person
S0405	enjoy life yeah
S0404	and that everyone need to be er need to follow their own path to god
S0405	yeah that's good
S0404	yeah that's good that's a good tolerant view of it
S0405	yeah
S0404	and in that everyone be resurrect and well not reincarnate and such
S0405	yeah yeah
S0404	depend upon your karma
S0405	yeah
S0404	but what i'd like to know be that the man say that you need to you need to be to be tell
S0405	yeah
S0404	what the proper way to live be
S0405	yeah
S0404	so here i be wonder what if you become that person
S0405	what the person that get teach
S0404	do yeah the no the person that teach
S0405	oh right yeah yeah yeah
S0404	do the people that you teach become erm well as long as you teach the same fundamentals of be a nice person
S0405	yeah
S0405	yeah
S0404	and be selfless and kind and love
S0405	yeah
S0404	if you teach that do your followers go to the equivalent of heaven too do you think
S0405	they should do
S0404	they should
S0405	i guess people only know what they're expose to you know there's a fundamental argument there about
S0404	i mean if you and i go soul search for the rest of our live
S0405	yeah
S0404	i still don't think we'd find the answer
S0405	yeah exactly well the answer be ourselves because everyone's different
S0404	oh that's deep dude that be deep
S0405	yeah may why do we have to find a purpose why do ourselves be be what you know we all feel like we have to conform to a particular set of view what if it's all a journey of self discovery in itself you know just cos we like conform that's that's our society you mention do you think that be be a good virtue in itself cos it's i i think that it's get to be flaw in some ways
S0404	how how would you how be it flaw for you
S0405	in term of oh obviously the concept of love be be be good but i mean christian value of turn the other cheek and you know let people just get on and be forgive
S0404	mm mm
S0405	if you're not religious and you don't believe that you'll be reward in heaven then you're basically let criminals get away with anything so you i don't believe that we should unconditionally love rapists and paedophiles and
S0404	well the the thing be the thing be people should be in the christian sense an ideal in that in those scenarios of rapists and paedophiles and murderers
S0405	yeah
S0404	people should be give a chance to repent
S0405	yeah okay but
S0404	and if they do solemnly repent
S0405	yeah
S0404	and if they do swear it and every fibre of their be do repent for the action of which they do
S0405	yeah
S0404	then i believe it should be right to accept them back into society
S0405	yeah okay but what but what about the situations where you know people aren't prosecute because you should love everyone anyway you know someone slap you you turn the other cheek that's not oh take them to court if they're er ask for forgiveness and you forgive them
S0404	well
S0405	that's straight up erm allow people to get away with stuff you know
S0404	i like to think that if humans abide not abide abide by the laws of christian agape
S0405	aboded yeah yeah abide yeah
S0404	every person on the planet since the dawn of human history i don't think we'd have paedophiles
S0405	no but paedophiles there's there's something
S0404	or people like that
S0405	they're not they don't choose to be evil they're just intrinsically wrong there be there be you know eh eh psycho killers who there be psychopaths who like kill people cause their brain be make that way in the same way that you and i would like certain things naturally
S0404	i'm more
S0405	the only the only issue you know i believe anyone should follow what they want and then they have a right to enjoy what they like as long as it doesn't hurt other people and that's where it's wrong to be a rapist or a paedophile but
S0404	i guess that be true
S0405	so yes yeah
S0404	well so you'd allow things like do drug
S0405	oh
S0404	to the point where you kill yourself from overdose
S0405	no because then that because then that then impact on other people in the way that alcohol can make you endanger other people drug will i do believe that the government have a responsibility of care to its citizens so you shouldn't let people overdose
S0404	the government already spend billions every year try to fix alcoholics
S0405	yeah and healthcare and stuff as well so
S0404	yeah and it spend billions just as much on security for drug and traffic and stuff like that
S0405	yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah so i mean it's a difficult issue cos you get into an issue about
S0404	humanity be too big i think
S0405	yeah
S0404	it's too big
S0405	so many view in itself anyway even if we take religion out of it there'd be so many ethical view on
S0404	yeah
S0405	subject that
S0404	people would still be like separate and against certain things
S0405	yeah they would
S0404	i mean i like the maybe even if people eh maybe if people we go that way
S0405	yeah sure
S0404	oh wait no yeah
S0405	if you yeah you hold the camera
S0404	even if people be even if you get er rid of religion
S0405	yeah
S0404	and apply religionless ethics to issue like euthanasia
S0405	yeah
S0404	i still think people would have a problem with it
S0405	oh yeah yeah it's not there there's fundamental other issue with euthanasia than that stem from non religious i mean all of bentham's ethics stem from a a non religious erm or even a non virtuous you know as in we're bear with virtues you know against that argument so erm
S0404	yeah i mean
S0405	i guess we need to just protect each other and when people go wrong
S0404	help each other
S0405	yeah i think that's
S0404	what happen if you keep go straight
S0405	er eh there's a path down yeah we could go that way then it go over
S0404	yeah
S0405	yeah it's a different way erm
S0404	nice light though that's one of the reason i say we should go
S0405	yeah oh good choice hold on let me check the time erm yeah yeah we get ten minutes erm yeah yeah it's all difficult really at least erm at least we're not ignorant
S0404	thank goodness we aren't
S0405	some
S0404	i couldn't bear to be ignorant
S0405	yeah
S0404	actually do you think you'd know if you be ignorant
S0405	no it's like the the socrates well no it be a a aristotle argument be he better to be no he say it be better to be a sad plato than a no a sad socrates than a happy pig as in he felt that people with higher erm sorry with eh who have not be expose to higher pleasures only lower pleasures would naturally be happier as in basically dumb people would be happier because they don't know as much of the horrors of the world and aren't as expose to it but that's an argument my brother once say go yeah go on
S0404	but but then how would you define have lower pleasures because lower pleasures you could
S0405	yeah
S0404	lower pleasures be define as be animalistic
S0405	yeah
S0404	virtues which do produce some sense of satisfaction and gratification
S0405	uhu
