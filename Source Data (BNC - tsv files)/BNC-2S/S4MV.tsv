S0607	the one where he catch the big fish
S0644	no
S0607	by the way you know for this record thing it's not mean to be a monologue and i'm sort of set off on a monologue
S0644	soliloquy that's alright
S0607	erm
S0644	once you get go i'll be able to interject with a bite of er
S0607	yeah
S0644	but i've gotta stop interrupt for you to do that so go on
S0607	well so basically we start go they invite us round for dinner with this other couple and that and that first night
S0644	do you ever like them
S0607	yeah that first night be really great and we all get on really well and even though i like to go to bed early it be like one be before i know it and all this stuff
S0607	and then i say at the time oh i get to buy me frankfurt monopoly for for christmas do you guy wanna come round and play it
S0607	erm and it felt like oh new friends
S0607	and so they all go yeah let's come round and play frankfurt monopoly so erm erm yeah so they all come round to ours and we play and then we all go round to the third couple's and and we play another game and then we go back to the first couple and play again but gradually it be get a bite like no so it doesn't really matter what what it be like with the couple cos the point be she sort of like latch onto me and be like me and you'll meet for coffee
S0644	okay
S0607	so me and her meet for coffee or a drink or dinner or whatever and 's really nice but she would just go on and on and do i have to erm i wonder if i have to go get a bite like
S0644	i know yeah one 0 one
S0607	they're all do it erm they're all do it and now i can't do it
S0607	come on guy get out the way
S0644	if we be in a field you'd just pull you'd just pull over
S0607	do it i'm do it i'm do it
S0644	go on go on
S0607	do i need to go even one more
S0644	yes
S0607	i'm not sure maybe i can still be in this one erm so but when when i meet for these things it would be like so she didn't know whether to marry him or not
S0644	why
S0607	erm because he's get four children already and she be say to me i'm use to have money because my parent be well off and i'm like
S0644	mm
S0607	and and i want my children to have be privilege as well and she say i don't wanna be like i can't afford drive lessons for my kid because he's get four other kid already and and i don't wanna be like struggle and
S0644	it's fair enough
S0607	he's gonna basically have to become ceo of the company for us to be able to have the lifestyle that we're use to
S0607	and cover all the kid kind of thing
S0644	yeah
S0607	and so we go on and on and on like this for hours where she be like he's the guy for me but i just don't know if i can do this
S0644	mm
S0607	and it's fair enough like it be a genuine problem but then she would sit there and go he's definitely the right guy for me and i would be like well then there's your answer i'm it's a shame about them four kid but they be in england and you're in germany
S0644	yeah
S0607	and erm anyway she do marry him in the end but the thing be that she i would meet her and she would she would thrash this problem out
S0644	again and again and again
S0607	or the thing be that's what i'd do so i i don't know why like it's a bite double standards to go bloody hell you really really thoroughly cover it don't you but it's just that i
S0607	it's just that after i leave her and go home i just felt drain of all energy you know how i think i hope that when we talk about stuff it's funny
S0644	yeah
S0607	so we just go oh my god my life be so shit ha ha ha you know whereas with her it be like i be drain and depress after i meet her so even though she's really nice i start to think oh shit i don't really want to meet her erm and then with the couple thing when we be meet erm in the couple group
S0644	mm
S0607	her bloke he be really start to get on my nerve and the two blokes work together and they use to leave out so they would be all like
S0644	chat
S0607	chat and and be in their in group and 's really shy so they be leave him out so i start to get a bite annoy about how cool think he be and i just think you're actually not that cool and then my canadian friend this be probably way too gossipy erm she say erm that he come onto her at a queen concert when be pregnant with their with their first child
S0644	really
S0607	and i just think do you know what i just don't even wanna and the thing be though 's really nice but i just didn't want to meet her
S0644	do you believe that that happen
S0607	well that's a whole other topic
S0644	because just that it just occur to me cos sometimes i think it's it's really difficult to say on one hand i find it difficult to believe that anyone would do that but then i know that they do and then i think when other people actually tell someone else do do the other people believe them
S0607	i know cos you sort of think unless you be there and could she have misunderstand
S0644	that's it but then do you know her well enough this girl to to know if
S0607	well the problem with be that i she's a very genuine person and i don't think she would lie but sometimes when when would be tell us this stuff would like pick hole in the story and go but like what exactly
S0644	that didn't happen
S0607	or you know but couldn't it have be this and couldn't it have be that and it be like a bite painful you know to listen to and i dunno it be a bite he put his arm around her from behind and snuggle right up at this concert
S0644	yeah i suppose you don't do that do ya your girlfriend's pregnant at home
S0607	oh also he hadn't tell that they would they'd get pregnant so then come and pick them up from this queen concert and and erm and go oh me and be think the three of us could go and see maroon five cos they're gonna be on in like july or whatever and go erm i can't really go in july
S0644	don't think so
S0607	and go why not and go because i'm due then and go what you're pregnant and then say to you didn't tell her i'm pregnant and they have a row
S0644	see that be weird innit
S0607	they have a row in the front of the car and be sit in the back go erm
S0644	what be the row though like what can you cos i'd say why do you say it and he'd say what
S0607	oh sixty five okay yeah erm she
S0644	but do the row go
S0607	i think know that it be weird that he have not tell that they be pregnant
S0644	that he hadn't say anything right
S0607	and it fit in with the story of him hug her from behind and stuff
S0644	cos all of this stuff when you hear these stories i think aren't it's all a little bite like a soap opera like you can't believe it actually go that people do things like this but then i know that they do
S0607	i know but you can't believe it can you
S0644	no i can't believe like
S0607	but guess what guess how he get together with he have an affair with her when he be marry
S0644	oh
S0607	she be the girl in the office
S0644	oh
S0607	this be so so hilarious erm
S0607	but yeah he have a he have an affair with in the office and his wife
S0644	cos of it
S0607	cos of it
S0607	cos i say at one point to at least know at least like he choose and say no that's not the way it go
S0644	she leave him
S0607	he have an affair with and do not choose but the wife find out and leave him
S0644	oh
S0607	and then he just stay with so the wife move all four kid back to england it's just like but the i think sort of get into the story but the point be that with even though she's a really nice person i use to feel exhaust after i meet her and i and i didn't feel natural like when i be tell her my stuff so i'd listen to all this stuff over and over and over and really agonise over all the problems and then
S0644	mm
S0607	i would try and tell her my stuff and it would make me feel worse about my stuff instead of like when i talk to you and i feel like
S0644	why do it make you feel worse
S0607	i can't explain it's like the the dynamic between us
S0644	be not good
S0607	it didn't didn't work even though you just can't force it can you be i still on the one 0 one
S0607	maybe this chat thing be a bad idea
S0607	erm
S0644	yeah we're go the right way it's four five seven no it's four six seven
S0607	oh my goodness
S0644	we've only get about another ten junctions

S0607	yeah but basically so i ditch
S0644	god bless america sorry
S0607	i i ditch her
S0644	do ya
S0607	cos i just do it i didn't wanna meet her
S0644	don't worry cos when she's have the baby she wouldn't have have time to talk to you anyway
S0607	but she still do she use to text and go do you wanna meet up
S0644	what even when she have the baby
S0607	yeah shall we have a drink do you wanna meet up shall we go for a coffee and i keep say no cos i just really didn't want to when i think about do it i be i felt like oh no i don't want to so i put her off and put her off and put her off until i leave the country
S0644	and then in be that the one that you reply and say oh i'm move country now
S0607	yeah bless her i do text her in january and say erm by the way it be really terrible but like i use my situation to get out of it so when she be always texting and me always say no at one point i say to her look me and be on the rock so i'm go through something so
S0644	oh leave me alone
S0607	and i felt a bite bad do you know what i mean cos i be like get out of it that way but it be true
S0644	well
S0607	but it be also partly cos partly i didn't wanna see anyone
S0644	yeah
S0607	but also partly i definitely didn't wanna see her and it's but it's not because she's not nice it's just that
S0644	yeah
S0607	didn't didn't click
S0607	so i do text her in january and say erm i'm like in the uk now and i've leave so bye
S0644	all the best
S0607	but bless her she reply
S0644	ah
S0607	cos i be think you know when you work yourself up and think they're gonna be annoy
S0644	yeah
S0607	and they're gonna like ignore me and stuff well she reply immediately which by the way i hate that
S0644	ah
S0607	but she but she say oh i'm think of you and i really hope that you enjoy this year
S0644	ah
S0607	and erm and it would be lovely to keep in touch and all this stuff so i be like ah
S0644	it's really sweet
S0607	so what do you think
S0644	but it's not
S0607	be it a good example
S0644	yeah but i think erm you've always be a lot better at that anyway like
S0607	just not see people yeah
S0644	i think you always just not don't care yeah don't really really care you be talk about it years ago with someone who live in manchester or go to manchester and you didn't you like her but you didn't you didn't you couldn't be arsed and when they move to manchester or or do you know who i'm talk about it be the girl who be a bite quiet out of that bunch erm
S0607	be it
S0644	i think it might have be she be small with dark hair
S0607	yeah and it just be a she be lovely but it be a nothingy friendship because
S0644	you be you be already start to get a bite arsy about things like this years ago like
S0607	yeah
S0644	couldn't be bother hassle
S0607	yeah it just wasn't enough of a friendship so and the thing be i can't when i be in frankfurt it wasn't like i could go oh i'd better meet up with cos otherwise i won't be meet with anybody i just think i would rather not meet with anybody because
S0644	i think that's good though i think that strength of character when you have the erm you know what i mean like to say well i it ain't actually worth this it's not
S0607	yeah
S0644	a genuine thing and i'd rather be
S0607	it doesn't fill me with joy the think of do it
S0644	you're say that and i'm totally agree with you but it's like a completely new concept to me this
S0607	mm
S0644	it's only really be in the last year or so it's a completely new concept that it have to be a proper thing or it's it's really not worth the what it be see when you're you meet people all the time and you go out with people all the time and it's not a big deal and you just go out with this lot and then you go out with that lot you meet more people and and there's something about your time be diminish or you haven't get so much time
S0607	yeah
S0644	and all and you start to really evaluate what who you're spend time with and all the rest of it and it's amaze it be with me it be all to do with with and and all the stuff that happen last year and i start think about people that you really do give a monkey's about
S0607	yeah
S0644	and who you can talk to
S0607	quality time
S0644	and what's the point in all the rest of it what be the point
S0607	yeah
S0644	and now but the worst part of it be not the worst part of it at all in fact it's be wonderful but
S0644	it have be wonderful because it's obviously sort of mutual with my ones because
S0607	yeah
S0644	i haven't hear from them either
S0607	i think that's that's quite a key point whether it's mutual or not
S0644	yeah
S0607	cos i always feel like i think i'm like attract people even more by be a bite erm aloof
S0644	yeah
S0607	and it's not what i'm try to do but it's like make them keener and then i sort of think why do you wanna meet up with me cos i'm awful
S0607	i'm a terrible person you know
S0607	and i don't listen it's not like i remember what your problems be
S0607	just wait for you to shut up so i can tell you my story
S0607	but by the way a key point be what about this feel of obligation that that you get with some people so it's like oh i should meet them and like and i should this and i should that cos i have another friend in frankfurt who's really she's sort of a bite of a step up from cos i sort of enjoy her company a bite more
S0644	mm
S0607	but she get really clingy really quickly so four seven two erm so she would be like erm so we use to meet for lunch cos i meet her she come to our office to work just for two weeks
S0644	mm mm
S0607	she only work up the road so we use to meet for so when we first meet each other we have one of those conversations where you can't stop laugh
S0644	ah
S0607	so we like our we click you know
S0644	yeah yeah
S0607	and erm we have another couple of those we be in a restaurant and i couldn't stop laugh so we use to meet for lunch on a friday and it be really nice
S0644	yeah
S0607	and then one time just one time i i agree to go for a drink in the even which for me be a really big deal
S0644	mm big deal
S0607	and erm i actually let myself go and we stay out till like one
S0607	but the problem be this open up something in and she be like right next time we go out we'll do this and i be like uhu it's back to lunch now
S0607	and erm but the thing be she start say things when we meet up like erm i think we need to meet up more often
S0644	oh
S0607	so i would like to see you in a few weeks and i be a bite like
S0644	oh what a shame
S0607	erm i'm talk three months from now dude
S0644	yeah
S0607	even though i really like her
S0644	this be the thing i think some people equate our weirdness with think that sometimes it's it's really really not them be it it's just you genuinely haven't get the energy or the inclination to see people that often you've get too much to do or you're and as soon as people start to kick up about it
S0607	yeah
S0644	it have the opposite effect because don't you think though that's the most simple thing in the world ever this be this would be your total worst nightmare and it doesn't happen any more but my friend use to be the worst culprit ever ever
S0644	and she would guilt you and it's only cos i've be friends with her so long and i didn't realise it be happen and it creep up on me but in the end it get to a really bad level of guilting you if you didn't go and see her
S0644	and then i go round to see one day cos you know i'm always well you wouldn't know this any more but i'd always go round and i'd go can't stop i've gotta do this and i've gotta do that and i've gotta do this
S0607	yeah
S0644	i wouldn't stop and go one day and she say oh she say it's lovely to see you she say come back whenever you want to like cos i say i've gotta go i can't do this i can't do that
S0607	sorry sorry next exit no hang on cos the thing be
S0644	four seven nine
S0607	it it could it be the one cos be on our route so do you think we should follow what the sign say or follow what i get on the internet shit
S0644	take exit four seven nine for then leave onto
S0607	but i just wonder if if the exit that they're say be different to four seven nine do we get it or do we follow the four seven nine cos
S0644	four seven nine
S0607	be like below where we're go so we be we be go past
S0644	i think then it doesn't matter like you can go either by the sound
S0607	oh oh hang on that just say one one six we don't wanna get the one one six
S0644	do that mean we're on the one one six
S0607	no i think it's like well i hope not do you think we're on the one 0 no wait a minute we're on the one 0 one so west one one six that must mean it's come up
S0644	so we don't get on it
S0607	i wonder if the one that they're send us on if on their sign be the one one six do you think we should press pause
S0644	if you could
S0607	no i mean on there do you think we should stop the thing
S0644	oh right
S0607	be it still on
S0644	be it still on it's probably oh it's go off again like the the whole thing
S0607	oh okay will you remember where you be at what you be say there
S0644	yeah no don't worry about that i mean that's fine it's more you've gotta be
S0607	this be typical me chat and i miss the exit
S0644	but we didn't miss it
S0607	we didn't do we
S0644	no no
S0607	so even though it say four seven nine
S0644	yeah
S0607	i what i really really want to happen be that their sign for be the four seven nine
S0644	i bet it be
S0607	what
S0644	we're about due for the four seven nine almost
S0607	yeah and that sign that we saw that say exit be it then like have it go now or
S0644	perhaps it's just a really a warn that's really early
S0607	highway one mile road no that's
S0644	get three three things to go that's exit four seven four seven six
S0607	by the way just really quickly there be one other thing about meet up with and start to feel like you're not proper friends till you've actually do things together because me and only ever meet up for dinner or lunch
S0644	yeah
S0607	and i start to feel like it be an empty friendship because we get on and everything but we didn't have any any common experience
S0644	you say that to me once that's what make people friends like it's when you've do stuff
S0607	like me and you we work together then we do like
S0644	holiday
S0607	drink together and go out together and
S0644	yeah
S0607	i don't know if it's the holiday that cement it all though or whether we would have be fine even without a holiday i mean
S0644	i think when you've when you've be friends with and it's work or it's study or school or something i think that's when you sort friends cos you really you're not just on your best behaviour over dinner like for an hour and a half or something
S0607	yeah
S0644	but you've really get to see to know them a bite so i think that's
S0607	go through things together sort of thing
S0644	yeah actually all my yeah i suppose all my friends have be that
S0607	and i think that's why i have a bite of a problem with and because i just didn't feel like we be close imagine if we be stay there
S0644	that's alright innit
S0644	i think that look really good
S0607	it would be nice to do just a sort of like trip where you just drive until you're feed up and then you get one of them
S0644	stick but that's what i'm say actually like you know how we be worry that we wouldn't get anywhere i reckon there's load of those things
S0607	yeah
S0644	we could just pull and say i wanna stay here cos there's it's so vast isn't it
S0607	yeah
S0644	so they've gotta have erm options like that it be a serial killer hangout but it nonetheless you could stop couldn't you if you want to
S0644	this be a little bite like austria or something don't you think it remind me of austria
S0607	yeah i dunno
S0607	it sort of feel i don't know what it feel like do you wanna carry on say what you're say and then if another sign come up i'll just cut you off again
S0644	it's it it's up to you cos i think sometimes it's annoy to have other people when you're try to concentrate sometimes i can't if i'm drive i can't
S0607	cos we can't tell how long it be till the thing
S0644	let's wait until we've get onto that bite
S0607	okay
S0644	that be a lovely cookie by the way thank you i think that be better than the erm yesterday's one
S0607	do you think it be fresh again
S0644	yeah do you remember wisbit
S0607	wisbit
