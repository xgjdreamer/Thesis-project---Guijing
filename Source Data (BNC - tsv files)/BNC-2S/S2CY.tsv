S0680	cos universities use to buy sun because they be expensive
S0679	mm we have we have some sun
S0680	i i mean they sell them more than anything they be kind of things people would have
S0679	mm
S0680	particularly or that many company
S0679	well they be bigger sort of things because you need different sort of stuff
S0680	yeah
S0679	cos we er our our ou system run on one vax computer
S0680	yeah
S0679	mm
S0680	oh use to do that
S0679	and then we have four vax computers a b c and d
S0680	do vax at i think
S0679	it all link in and then
S0680	be they big big cabinets do they have erm platters on them whatever you call those like big or be they tape things er what do they have go you don't know cos use to work on vaxs like wash machine

S0680	yes
S0679	sort of space out in like one here about sort of maybe this bite
S0680	mm
S0679	bite taller than this little table perhaps
S0680	mm
S0679	i mean it's a long time i mean we're go back twenty twenty well a long time twenty five years

S0679	mm
S0680	cos he have he have some naughty lads who work in there as well and i've forget the name of these particular naughty lads and they they they be quite lively and there be something about they all use to have to be erm be able to switch off
S0679	mm
S0680	these machine if there be a problem erm so you didn't so the whatever it be head of the thing or whatever didn't damage you have to switch it off really quick and there be a sequence
S0679	mm
S0680	to switch this off so you didn't crash everything but you have to switch it off or whatever i can't think why why you know if there be some problem you have to switch it off but you have to do the switch in the right order so you didn't
S0679	mm
S0680	sort of crash the
S0679	mm mm
S0680	or anything and erm i can't think what it be now something or other they do do something naughty to

S0679	mm
S0680	but he can get move erm when he want to and i don't know what somebody do i don't know whether some i i have a feel it be something like erm put some smoke near the fan so it give the impression it be smoke

S0679	oh probably very very respectable now probably own multimillion company
S0680	oh er no he's he's he's er he's still a bite of a lively lad the thing be er he be er he be a lad he be a lad who be very good at engineer and stuff
S0679	mm
S0680	erm but he wasn't academic but he be very bright
S0679	mm
S0680	erm good at sort of erm do that sort of stuff he be extremely bright and quick but he wasn't sort of academic in that sense

S0680	so he be er you know he he have to keep him occupy cos he be a bite of a live wire
S0679	mm
S0680	but he be a nice he wasn't nasty with it
S0679	but i guess a lot of the engineer now aren't that aren't really academic sort of people because it's move to a a regular sort of
S0680	yeah
S0679	technical job now hasn't it
S0680	yes
S0679	largely
S0680	yes
S0679	rather than be a academic skilled job on the
S0680	well it depend
S0679	think about the sort of people that use to have
S0680	mm
S0679	work as the field engineer with whatever do
S0680	yeah
S0679	what do do what it be some sort of compute something or other wasn't it i can't think what it the stuff that 's engineer do but they go out fix things
S0680	yes
S0679	and everything's get a computer in it these days hasn't it
S0680	yes
S0679	whether they actually fix these things or even in the garage they clip the computer on now don't they
S0680	yes but i mean it depend it's like at they have their erm about boys they have their about boys and they have their sort of erm ones who can stick wire in hole and screw something up
S0679	mm
S0680	and then then they have the sort of who actually know how it all work and then would sometimes lead over everything
S0679	mm
S0680	and have to explain it to the manage director
S0679	mm
S0680	but you know it depend what level you're work at
S0679	yeah
S0680	cos could do all the you know actually read the book and know what it mean
S0679	mm
S0680	and teach himself things
S0679	mm
S0680	like he be teach himself that erm whatever it be be it tcp ip
S0679	oh yes yes
S0680	or something he he be teach himself that cos he kind of know it but he be try to do it all the bits he use to skip over he be try to fill in the
S0679	mm
S0680	the gap of it yes
S0679	i it it always tickle me tcp er because of tcp
S0680	i know
S0679	it be tcp isn't it
S0680	tcp ip

S0680	for put on bite and things
S0679	on our for for our treat anything
S0680	yes
S0679	antiseptic
S0680	antiseptic yes
S0679	i don't think don't know if it's approve to do that these days
S0680	i think they
S0679	but do we have
S0680	i think they still sell it or they use to sell it until very recently
S0679	it's probably get really harmful chemicals in it
S0680	it's probably get buy out by somebody
S0679	oh gargle for gargle
S0680	it be for gargle and you could put it on cut but it be
S0679	oh
S0680	a bite oh
S0679	yes oh it be the only thing i ever have on cut we didn't have savlon or
S0680	you could put it on spotty things
S0679	acriflex yes it go on everything
S0680	yes oh we i i erm we have savlon sometimes
S0679	mm i don't remember savlon i just remember tcp
S0680	yes it be in a no it it be it it be in one of those you have erm one of those metal sort of tube that have
S0679	yes

S0679	no no
S0680	but it be metally
S0679	mm
S0680	yes
S0679	so it's get on for bedtime
S0680	think so i'm go to go and knit
S0679	erm what do you think we should do tomorrow er can we do anything useful in 's kitchen can we clear i think you be quite interest in investigate be it on top of the table
S0680	erm well if i move those box erm that box on the on the table be i believe be quite heavy
S0679	okay what do you think's in it
S0680	but
S0679	be it glass
S0680	erm possibly i it'll say on it
S0679	oh right
S0680	there be a box that be quite heavy there's two box on that table i think or do i move one anyway erm i can probably well i have pick it up before but it might might need a bite of you know steer me onto something
S0679	yeah
S0680	can put it maybe on a chair
S0679	mm
S0680	or something
S0679	mm
S0680	cos i don't wanna put it down on the floor cos it's too heavy to pick up er
S0679	would that small table help
S0680	i don't know whether it'll be too heavy on this table
S0679	well we don't want to break it it's a very important table do you have two of them
S0680	no i only buy i only have well they only have one that be they only have one and i buy it sort of cos i think about buy two at the time but there be cos cos they're only plain wood
S0679	mm
S0680	and er there be one that have get a few more knotholes
S0679	mm mm
S0680	and that be the best one so i buy it but they didn't have any more
S0679	mm
S0680	you know those ones they have that they call television table or whatever they they be ones that have that you still get them they're quite tall
S0679	mm
S0680	and they have a a top like that they they have hundreds of those but they only have
S0679	mm
S0680	a few of these and they didn't get any more in
S0679	mm i think about get a couple of table like this for
S0680	yes
S0680	yes
S0679	and they have some on freecycle i think they be make of something that sound quite i think it be bamboo
S0680	yeah
S0679	which i think er be it bamboo no rubberwood
S0680	rubberwood yes
S0679	which i quite like actually
S0680	yes but it you have to check how they're fix cos this one's quite good because
S0679	mm
S0680	it's get that little thing you twist
S0679	mm
S0680	but my that little brown one that's really an outside one you know the little one there's a i've get a little one like that that's slat
S0679	oh right
S0680	brown criss cross legs
S0679	yes yes
S0680	that's lean on that heap of junk
S0679	yes
S0680	now that one you open it up and it clip into and it go into a hook
S0679	mm
S0680	well if you pick it up
S0679	mm
S0680	unless you put your hand under and hold that it collapse
S0679	i'm very nervous about move this one actually
S0680	well this one's alright cos it's get a peg
S0679	mm
S0680	it's get a peg in it as long as the peg's in it it stand up without the peg in it
S0679	mm
S0680	but it have a little peg
S0679	i didn't go for these rubberwood ones because i just really wasn't
S0680	yeah it depend how high they be but that little one that's why
S0679	they look quite nice
S0680	that little one's quite a nice just small size
S0679	mm
S0680	that's why i have it in the house
S0679	mm
S0680	but er that's why i tie string round the top
S0679	mm mm
S0680	because
S0679	mm
S0680	you know you don't want it collapse
S0679	you don't want it collapse absolutely
S0680	and my little table that's at the side of the settee with the drop leave
S0679	mm
S0680	the small ones it's all very well cos you pull out these things that hold the flap up
S0679	mm
S0680	but if you put something heavy on one side it tip up
S0679	yes
S0680	it's alright if you put it on the side where the solid bite be
S0679	mm yeah
S0680	but if you put it on the other side it tip up because it it hasn't get another gate leg
S0679	mm mm
S0680	which i didn't appreciate at the time
S0679	i mean one assume that be make gonna be make in a sensible way
S0680	well it's make it's nicely make
S0679	mm
S0680	it's get it's nicely make
S0679	i think there be quite a few of those table with a similar sort of problem
S0680	but if you buy one with the you know so you can get little ones with gate legs
S0679	mm
S0680	but they're obviously more expensive because what i use to do with that one be put one leaf up you know and have a half circle table
S0679	mm mm
S0680	next to me but you can't put things on one side
S0679	mm mm erm consider it's get a bite late
S0680	yes i'm gonna have to go
S0679	oh okay
S0680	and knit somewhere
S0679	righty ho i think we how would you feel about leave the archers until tomorrow
S0680	oh we can do the archers tomorrow
S0679	be that alright okay
S0680	i'd forget it be an archers day to be honest
S0679	oh yes it's not saturday yet
S0680	i think be think it cos we've have music on
S0679	yes that's true okay
