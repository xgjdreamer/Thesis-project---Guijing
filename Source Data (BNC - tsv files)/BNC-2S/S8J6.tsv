S0037	you know like if you be go on
S0115	party bowl
S0037	ah d'you know what we miss masterchef yesterday watch that football match
S0115	ah well no i mean i think i think it's it's okay but i i wouldn't wanna watch it all uh you know all the time i think you've gotta have a bite of variety
S0037	i would i'm gonna watch it on catch up where's that have you put that pan on
S0115	uh no
S0037	um i would i'd watch it all the time
S0115	really
S0037	yeah it's dramatic anyway
S0115	um well yeah it be but
S0037	be there anything good on tonight when's that programme on about oh do we miss that programme on about the talk animals
S0115	the the highly intelligent chimpanzee
S0037	yeah
S0115	yeah miss it
S0037	do we
S0115	uh just remember a chimpanzee do a memory test really fast faster than a human could
S0037	that's right
S0115	and yeah now that look interest but
S0037	stupid football match imagine if we hadn't win then that would've be annoy
S0115	it nearly go to penalties
S0037	i know that would've be extra annoy
S0115	i hate penalties
S0037	i know
S0115	um
S0037	it kinda unfair isn't it but then again i suppose it have to come to an end at some point
S0115	they be get pretty tire towards the end
S0037	maybe it should just be a fight to the death
S0115	hm yeah just just keep see you again and see you next week for another uh see you next week yeah for more and then and then uh so technically we'd have to carry on until there be a winner be it
S0037	yeah until they just drop down on their knees to of exhaustion
S0115	or or d'you mean um carry on the you mean the same game
S0037	no i mean carry on the no i mean carry on in one go
S0115	well oh right want until uh they're basically just sort of
S0037	so it'd be like seven hundred minutes on the clock you know
S0115	they're just sort of they're lie on the floor and they're crawl
S0037	yeah
S0115	they're try to crawl it in the net and stuff
S0037	yeah i think that's a fine and fabulous idea
S0115	sort of head it along the grind
S0037	yeah
S0115	yeah
S0037	that i'd pay for you know people get those footballers get so much money and then they're all tire after like ninety minutes you know that's not right be it
S0115	well no it's very it's very exhaust though i imagine
S0037	yeah i know but they get
S0115	i never play ninety minutes but
S0037	if somebody give me two hundred fifty thousand pound a week i'd run around all you want
S0115	fair enough that be a lot of money but you have to
S0037	it's like buy a house every week
S0115	you have to put in a lot of effort you know all the
S0037	you could buy a house every single week like
S0115	gotta spend so much time you know and just
S0037	yeah but that's crazy
S0115	you be practise in the street and everything in the park
S0037	but that's oh crap i haven't put any water in that's crazy money though
S0115	yeah quite a lot d'you wanna potato in there
S0037	uh d'you think i should save those sweet potatoes for something else
S0115	um yeah maybe save those for the for the soup or something oh you mean the sweet do you say sweet potato or three potatoes
S0037	sweet potatoes i say
S0115	yeah save the sweet potatoes maybe put these two little potatoes in
S0037	oh right
S0115	uh
S0037	oh they be little little ones
S0115	like worry ball
S0115	uh butternut squash and two worry ball
S0037	fine well
S0115	yeah

S0037	get some pizza or something really naughty i haven't have pizza for age
S0115	have you now d'you mean a proper one or or the or you know the sort of make one
S0037	yeah well i never like i would we never really get takeaway pizza do we cos always we would
S0115	yeah oh can you do some cola into that
S0037	what oh yeah have you have we get any
S0115	yep think so
S0037	oh yeah um so no i mean like any pizza
S0115	yeah
S0037	d'you wanna go out tomorrow night then or or the saturday
S0115	um
S0037	i suppose we shouldn't go too crazy save it for me hollybobs
S0115	um well uh uh i mean it be good uh last time when we go out on the friday
S0037	yeah
S0115	that be quite good but uh it's also good on the saturday as well so
S0037	which one's better
S0115	um
S0037	there's only one way to find out no um i think like
S0115	which one which one would you prefer
S0037	i think i like friday because it feel like like cos if sometimes on a friday i i just really if i come home and just sit on the sofa then the whole night's go
S0115	yeah
S0037	before i even realize and i just get in a sleepy trance and then put the telly on watch the telly like
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	if we go out to the pub or something then at least like it keep you sort of from nod off or anything
S0115	yeah um
S0037	and then also because like the next day feel like it should be sunday but actually it's only saturday
S0115	but uh yeah that's that's right it it feel like the the sunday feel like an extra bank holiday
S0115	cos uh friday feel
S0037	so if we do have a bank holiday and i go out on a friday then it would be like a double bank holiday when be the next bank holiday it's not for age it's not it's like may or something isn't it
S0115	um may may uh easter uh good friday
S0037	nothing happen in february
S0115	it's it's good friday oh no that's not a bank holiday be it uh the easter monday
S0037	no friday be good friday's a bank holiday isn't it isn't it
S0115	um i dunno maybe it be think all normally
S0037	i think it be yeah it be it be
S0115	yeah yeah so good friday and uh then easter monday so we uh haven't get any plan for then but we could end up camp
S0037	i know yeah
S0115	uh and uh buy some gotta get a tent haven't we
S0037	well i might buy that one of those ones that i send you the link to so
S0115	yeah
S0037	be a good use for that free amazon voucher though like i never even expect that like
S0115	well that be really good that you that you get that with sort of like
S0037	i really didn't expect it to materialize
S0115	a free hundred hundred quid of hundred quid of stuff
S0037	you always think things like that be just a scam you know what i mean well i do anyway
S0115	yeah
S0037	give us that pan there
S0115	yeah i would be a little bite cynical about it yeah
S0037	mm put that lid on
S0115	it's take a while
S0037	i know big pan though
S0037	oh bless you but um
S0115	uh so yeah we'll be we'll try and go to uh to then with with and you know
S0037	i like i mean that time that i go oh god that chilli that chilli pork thing
S0115	oh yeah um
S0037	that be the single spiciest thing i've ever eat at the time
S0115	they say it's very hot so you've gotta watch out for it but i i dunno and if you have it now d'you think you you may be more use to hot food now so you might not
S0037	yeah maybe live with you force feed chillies at every turn
S0115	yeah
S0037	speak of which d'you want anything any chillies chop for in there
S0115	i just chop some of them little dry red ones um
S0037	oh right
S0115	i didn't uh didn't
S0037	oh it'll be nice won't it when the chilli plant be out again d'you think it will come back to life
S0115	yeah that one i dunno uh it look pretty dead doesn't it
S0037	have you water it recently
S0115	yeah today as it happen
S0037	oh have you oh
S0115	it be quite dry though um uh really not sure if if it may've get too dry while we be away
S0037	what about the other ones do you water this one
S0115	yeah i water both of them yeah that's the bell pepper isn't it but there's there's we've get tomatoes still with snow on them we've get
S0037	i know
S0115	tomatoes with fruit and uh
S0037	i think they're dead though
S0115	you know leave over but uh um so if they come back to life that'd be quite miraculous i enjoy grow them little uh
S0037	but i think they go to twig like this last year like i seem to remember the chilli be just like a stick last year and i be like oh maybe we should just throw it out
S0115	yeah
S0037	and then just in the spring once it get warmer it sort of come back to life but
S0115	the funny thing be that it be warm for the plant isn't it
S0037	but be it not about the sunlight be it not about like the the hours of sunlight and not
S0115	i dunno i dunno
S0037	cos in here yeah it be warm inside
S0115	till the we've put it in the corner yeah maybe it's not
S0037	yeah it's not even get any light so
S0115	something's not happen in the corner maybe
S0037	yeah maybe d'you know what i mean maybe it's not just like
S0115	well they they they they would progress slower in less light wouldn't they
S0037	yeah but maybe once it be it not once it's in its like dormancy thing that it just sort of sorry it just sort of
S0115	um it's just yeah it's just sort of wait uh i'd imagine and then it'll just spring back to life could put
S0037	maybe it need like a kick start like a blast of well not now the snow out there our garden's the slippiest place of the whole you know the whole of my journey to work the
S0115	can you chop that for
S0037	yeah the the journey to work our garden's the the slippiest bite
S0115	ay
S0037	i wish i'd clear that snow when when it first start
S0115	yeah it be it's go all freeze and um it's harder
S0037	but it be snow when i come in you know
S0115	well it's sort of slippery
S0037	it be snow when i come in
S0115	be it
S0037	yeah tiny bits actually like we
S0115	well i hope we get out of this cold snap
S0037	let me see what it be now
S0115	so be the new snow settle
S0037	no it wasn't like very much it be like just a few flake
S0115	yeah
S0037	it's not doesn't seem to be snow at the moment but the sky be like totally white you know when you're like oh it's gonna snow
S0115	yeah and that's cold though you get a blast of cold air
S0037	but the garden's really bad like the bike's really hard to get out cos obviously the first day that i push it out i create like a groove and now i have to like get it back in the same groove otherwise it just slip all over
S0115	yeah well yeah it be really slippery isn't
S0037	stupid they put the the um the um roads be better than the the footpaths and that now
S0115	oh yeah yeah well the roads be never a problem cos it they'd be all grit like they be just sort of
S0037	well other than the side roads
S0115	they be just sort of wet in the middle but not not slippy
S0037	oh there be drama today at work
S0115	oh really
S0037	so um there be like a guy apparently well
S0115	what kind of drama
S0037	well i don't exactly know so well i'll tell the two different bits of drama i'll tell you the other one first so i'll come to work this morning and then i'd put me bike away and then i be walk up to the door and load of people be like look up at the sky
S0037	and point and there be this massive heron like
S0115	a heron
S0037	like heron like you know from um
S0115	get sort of bits of water fowl
S0037	d'you remember from um animals of farthing wood it use to go
S0115	they're they're like a stalk aren't they
S0037	yeah well maybe it be a stalk
S0115	i don't know
S0037	well anyway you know like they're kind of grey white with like a sort of pointy head and like a big beak ooh sorry
S0037	wave me knife around and like a big beak
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	one of them but it must've be like
S0115	and it be just sort of swoop over be it
S0037	it'd no it be so it be sit on the roof like on the second floor there's like a veranda
S0115	there's a lot of dodgy there's a lot of weird animals around here in aren't there
S0037	so i don't know so there be like it must've
S0115	yeah there's a lot of sort of like species and like load of tree load of
S0037	yeah
S0115	plant and water bird and things go around here
S0037	but it must've literally be that big like um
S0115	they're pretty big
S0037	um but we've get like a like carp and stuff in
S0115	them sort of bird oh be it come for your carp
S0037	i imagine and i think it's come and like goldfish and stuff i think it be after that cos everywhere's freeze isn't it i mean that pond
S0115	so it's technically a pest um
S0037	well i don't know but uh that be part of the drama then after lunch i be on the way back and there be like
S0115	yeah
S0037	and there be like police and stuff all over and um this van
S0115	right
S0037	this van um like a grey van and they have the doors open and stuff and like policemen be look in it and that and
S0115	fair enough
S0037	apparently what'd happen this van'd come pull up at work and these people have get out of it and sort of like um sort of manage to get their way past reception like some people have hold the door for them and stuff
S0115	right so they try to break then yeah
S0037	and they'd get in the build they'd get in yeah and no one exactly know where they be or what they be do or who they be or
S0115	just just manage to get in but actually didn't that happen earlier as well
S0037	yeah stuff be steal once
S0115	yeah so they've they've break in in the daytime what time be this
S0037	at lunchtime they've just drive in
S0037	yeah park up walk in
S0115	park up open the door then what happen
S0037	and then i don't know that's all i know that's all i hear
S0115	hm
S0037	so yeah
S0115	your guard be gonna have to watch your uh
S0037	considerably more drama than
S0115	you're gonna have to close your gate
S0037	considerably more drama than usual though
S0115	yeah
S0037	so normally it's just like absolutely nothing ah the email's not work that my that's the biggest drama
S0115	well in some ways that's good actually cos then with less dramas you can focus on you know progression and your work
S0037	yeah i suppose
S0115	you know get through
S0037	no but everyone like bite gossip
S0115	move things forward
S0037	move those tomatoes everyone like a bite gossip though

S0115	i get i burn i burn and then react and knock that onto you it be like a double burn sort of thing
S0037	it's alright don't worry
S0115	a bite stupid but um try to think of something

S0037	it's horrible i couldn't just eat one like an apple like that though
S0115	do we need any more ingredients in this thing apart from the yoghurt
S0037	uh i don't know be it spicy enough

S0037	it's really nice the squash have like bring them down
S0115	really a tad bitter but i think it could cope with it like because it's quite a sweet dish so
S0037	right
S0115	um
S0037	i'm really glad that i buy this enormous pan
S0115	so we'll just wait for it to stew let it stew for a bite then

S0037	it's not like sweet wood it's
S0115	who wouldn't want sweet wood
S0037	maybe what we could do be like just put the yoghurt on the top when we have it rather than mix it in
S0115	ay
S0037	what we could do be like just put a bite of yoghurt on the top when we have it rather than mix it in
S0115	yeah you can i mean i think the curdling's cause by um if you put it in it's too hot it's too hot the heat uh cause the protein to to to join up so it curdle
S0037	yeah put the lid there sorry alright heston
S0115	curdle and uh yeah yeah but i like that programme with uh with heston

S0037	yeah my washing's break dot com
S0115	you know plumb experts like
S0037	if you ask if you're interest in that sort of thing you should
S0115	lot of experts available you know
S0037	you should ask me dad i bet he's get load of like multimeters hang around the house
S0115	that's what that's what i be think about he he's an electrician um
S0037	i know
S0115	um there's one group of people who have multimeters it's it's electricians isn't it uh yeah
S0037	i'll well i'll i email him today actually i'll i'll ask him if you d'you want one like
S0115	yeah but not not if it's expensive or anything i mean
S0037	well i'll just ask him if he's get one he's bind to have one
S0115	they've probably get a few useful gadgets actually um power drill we want
S0037	yeah i don't know if that'd go in the post as easy as a multimeter multimeter
S0115	mind you they they do post us like a a sort of massive crate uh
S0037	that's true actually actually yeah yeah that's true it won't matter
S0115	a list of if we could just sort of give them a massive list of uh of things
S0037	well i'll just ask him if he's get any good things lie around that he can send to us
S0115	uh oh you've gotta put vaseline on that
S0037	i have be it it's annoy us
S0115	what d'you get that uh witch hazel for
S0037	for me skin
S0115	oh right be it uh it's uh
S0037	it's an old witch's white remedy
S0115	to sooth it
S0037	well no it's just like i've look at a lot of i mean i like that that um witch hazel wash face wash um and i'd look at a lot of the cream and like stuff like that and all of them just seem to have different stuff in but they're all quite expensive and i think a lot of that's just package could you pour me a glass of water actually while you're there um
S0115	already get one here's one i make earlier
S0037	oh thank you um
S0115	or be that the plant one like uh only only joke yeah i
S0037	oh you better not have ugh the plant water um no and a lot of them have like different stuff in and i mean like fancy packets but i bet you they're just the same d'you know what i mean so i think i would just try that witch hazel gel see if it do anything well i think it have help it feel like the skin feel less irritate
S0115	no i think it can can do the job it's not really suit for eczema be it but
S0037	no
S0115	for eczema i don't know hydro whatsit cream hydrocortisone
S0037	i've buy you some d'you want it
S0115	no uh i don't wanna sort of use too much of it i only wanna use it for
S0037	yeah you're suppose to use sparingly
S0115	yeah yeah they're like you're not gonna put this on face be you
S0037	but have you be use that green soap or the white soap
S0115	no i don't i don't use that
S0037	i'm gonna throw that green soap away
S0115	i'm not i'm not use them at the moment i'm use like their butter
S0037	butter
S0115	yeah the um
S0037	oh the pink one
S0115	the it's not butter it's um
S0037	i know what you mean
S0115	it's it's uh it's sort of
S0037	the squeezy one
S0115	it's it's a soap but it have a certain
S0037	butteriness
S0115	buttery uh mayonnaisy sort of element to itself uh
S0037	in the in the big bottle with the thing on
S0115	soap and glory
S0037	the the lever
S0115	yeah yeah it's a soap and glory and it's call something like clean on me
S0037	yeah that's right it be quite buttery
S0115	they they always name their products after pun off uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	sort don't they
S0037	but it's i think maybe you should bet some of that like um you can get proper wash actually it's quite expensive but maybe you should just like body juice that's more moisturizery
S0115	don't know
S0037	cos anything the problem be with use like that that no 7 men one that you've get be that like anything that's like for men be usually quite dry
S0115	no it be it be that be worse than like than the box soap
S0037	smell nice but i think it's quite astringent
S0115	that that be really strong in fact that be my uh eczema worse
S0037	ah you delicate little thing
S0115	ah it's it's terrible i never uh i never take people seriously who say they have uh allergies before but uh
S0037	i know all these
S0115	when you when it happen to yourself
S0037	it's funny cos it's like actually i don't really have it i only have it there like in one really obscure place in between in between two of me finger it's so weird
S0115	yeah well i think that need a bite of cream on it that
S0037	ah i think it do actually i might just go and put some on but um no i mean i have it on a lot i have that horrible thing once do i tell you about about me hand
S0115	uh probably but uh
S0037	so one day um one day i be fine and then the next day i wake up and i think oh me hand be a bite itchy palm of me hand and i literally go like that and just all this skin start come off on me hand like flake off
S0115	that's that's horrible
S0037	like ugh what's happen like like i have a dead man's hand and uh so i go to the doctor's and i be like uh my hand like what's happen and he be like oh you've get contact dermatitis you've must've touch something and i'd just be to like school or whatever i hadn't do anything and i be like well i don't think i have so he give me this cream to rub in and then it go away so it be really freaky though like literally all my hand just peel off
