S0642	be that music a problem
S0486	no i don't think so
S0642	alright then
S0486	hi thank you for talk to me today erm so can you tell me about the art course you're run here
S0642	yes this be a a recreational course at the creative innovation centre so the creative the word creative innovation be key to the sort of course we do here it's not the normal erm sort of for instance watercolour for beginners type course so a lot of the erm the people who attend be the majority of them be mature people and quite a few have experience a reasonably good or very er professional art education but it's open to erm anyone really and we have about twenty do paint and draw in the morning and about twenty do the life draw and the nearest you could say be relate to would be a foundation type course
S0486	right
S0642	in an art school so it's quite diagnostic in a sense
S0486	right okay
S0642	but it's very erm liberally individually bias er in the sense that people be encourage to sort of work in a way that suit them and i suppose my philosophy would be that they'll learn more from each other than they would from me
S0486	right
S0642	cos cos they work they're encourage to experiment really
S0486	right okay so what sort of qualification do they get afterwards be it in line with an art access course or anything
S0642	no there be no qualification as such
S0486	no okay
S0642	so it's not it's not a ratify recognisable
S0486	right
S0642	erm educational qualification it it be purely recreational
S0486	right
S0642	but it's also see as part of the sort of a wider remit here where we do all sort of music and poetry and languages and performance
S0486	right
S0642	and even theatre occasionally
S0486	yeah
S0642	and we've get a new cinema
S0486	oh gosh yes

S0642	well the way it's go here
S0486	yeah
S0642	this although it's an extraordinarily good build it's not big enough
S0486	yeah

S0642	and i know it's still go
S0486	yeah
S0642	but this be sort of almost they've cross over
S0486	yeah
S0642	and this be on the up i mean i know they've apply and have get a a an access course
S0486	yeah yeah
S0642	run and er for next year so there be other possibilities where they could do sort of er fdas and all sort here
S0486	yes
S0642	but but that would erm need some more accommodation which they've
S0486	right
S0642	possibly acquire this huge place opposite
S0486	oh right
S0642	yeah but that wouldn't be anything to do with me i've really i don't know i'm very much an integral part i just really get the thing off the grind
S0486	no yeah
