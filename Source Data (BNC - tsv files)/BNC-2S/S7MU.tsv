S0037	what d'you mean
S0115	festivals innit you can get together with your family at easter
S0037	you mean you want to or
S0115	you can i mean no i be just say that people can i think what this be do be it's congeal and uh create like lump
S0037	ah it'll be fine it be nice in the um in the sandwich
S0115	sort of solidify hasn't it yolk be very uh very sort of thick isn't it when it harden it doesn't sort of
S0037	yeah
S0115	like um quite quite a pain to get off but egg's a pain isn't it cos you say when you be in uh people have to pay like hundreds of pound if they'd if they'd like spill an egg
S0037	well
S0115	if they'd like smash an egg and like it would take mass of effort to clean it off
S0037	yeah no i mean it wasn't um i suppose that should do with some qualify like it wasn't if you'd spill an egg you get pay hundreds of pound but
S0115	yeah yeah yeah there be just throw it yeah
S0037	if you'd trash your kitchen and you'd throw egg everywhere
S0115	yeah
S0037	like there be one guy who'd throw egg everywhere and they'd get all in like the fire um what's it call you know the the fire sensor
S0115	oh right
S0037	they'd have like a big fight and he'd like throw like egg everywhere and they'd get in there
S0115	yeah
S0037	and like you know they're like it's like glue it go so hard and crusty that you can't like it just have to be replace
S0115	yeah
S0037	so that be like you know some amount of money to do that
S0115	yeah
S0037	but if you're gonna get drink and chuck egg around then that's what you get really
S0115	yeah i mean that's kind of the problem with uh with like but we be talk about tuition fee that um a lot of people think that you know university's just like like a big party then
S0037	well
S0115	it it make it harder to justify uh fund it through the state
S0037	well even if it be a big party like people have different ideas about what a big party mean for me big party doesn't mean like crack the egg out and just scramble them all over your flat like
S0115	yeah
S0037	like you know what i mean there's limit isn't there like even i i suppose even if i be totally out of me mind
S0115	yeah a lot a lot of the youth of today you know i'm like an old like a granddad aren't i
S0037	well a bite but that's why i like you
S0115	you know today's young people
S0037	no but even if i be really you know have have load of beer or whatever i don't think i would ever i i could never entertain the idea of like smash egg everywhere it doesn't seem like a good plan and i don't know what i would gain from that
S0115	yeah
S0037	and in fact i've never really understand people who do that like who smash things and mess things up when they're
S0115	smashers
S0037	like i can understand people who
S0115	i be not a smasher
S0037	you know people get catch like go for wee in different place and stuff like
S0115	inside wash machine
S0037	but there's an element of you know you need to go and okay maybe you don't choose the best place or whatever so i can i never would condone it and i would never do it meself but i can i have an element of sort of compassion or i can sort of see why that might happen but things like just just smash things or just throw things out of windows or
S0115	yeah
S0037	i mean i saw a lot of it
S0115	yeah
S0037	when i be an assistant dean but um
S0115	yeah i mean this be probably a lot of that sort of stuff there be uh in that job like you know you could see from their point of view so
S0037	of course i mean
S0115	but
S0037	but i think we always give like we always do give people the benefit of the doubt like we always get them in and let them like explain like what they be do
S0115	yeah
S0037	or why they be do it and like from time to time we do get people in who be say who would say things like i'd be out and i'd get really drink because my nana have die and my dad have die my i'd have a really bad thing and
S0115	well that's terrible use that as an excuse isn't it
S0037	and like no but if if it have happen and if and if that be why they be do that like we do always cut them some slack but it's when you get idiots in go muh i just want to like
S0115	oh yeah well i guess uh the rugby team the rugby team moon the uh chancellor
S0037	you know like it when you get people do stuff like that it's just
S0115	that be a legendary you know it's like animal house have you ever see that
S0037	i have see animal house
S0115	think i try to show you that great comedy but in reality it's just a few bad apples uh be it it's good comedy but obviously you don't wanna be like that in yeah i yeah i videoed it and didn't have the start yet um
S0037	no
S0115	you know in reality like
S0037	what's the soup like
S0115	like i dunno i just like assume that it be okay
S0037	be it
S0115	i'll taste it now when it's new
S0037	it doesn't look as thick as normal but i'm sure it'd be nice
S0115	right well d'you want me to do anything to rectify that
S0037	no no no it doesn't need to be thick
S0115	um
S0037	oh thank you oh it's really good it's really nice
S0115	oh okay i think it's get quite a nice taste
S0037	it's quite sort of spicy it's nice
S0115	yeah i maybe put a little bite too much chilli in there but uh that's fine
S0037	no i don't think you do i think it's nice i think um with um
S0115	yeah
S0037	you can't go wrong with a butternut squash i think
S0115	it be a nice it's that sweetness be good um useful uh
S0037	you can't go very far wrong
S0115	yeah
S0037	few lentils
S0115	yeah i
S0037	what you gonna do with that mackerel tomorrow
S0115	put it like two two garlics and the bacon go in
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh i dunno um up to you really what whatever you wanna um
S0037	dunno it's just
S0115	uh what you would you like
S0037	it's kinda nice just with
S0115	maybe something like um chinesey just um
S0037	i quite like mackerel just just like just cook like by itself it's very tasty doesn't need much
S0115	noodles and that yeah yeah you just grill it and then you have it like you can have it with some chinese style noodles or something
S0037	yeah that sound nice
S0115	um i'd like yeah like so maybe to to do a kinda curry style would be interest to see or thai like a thai thing
S0037	dunno it's quite it's get quite a strong taste in itself hasn't it like i normally just put like salt and pepper on and just like either shallow fry it or grill it or something it's nice
S0115	yeah thai style sauce might be interest but uh uh that's that yeah so um

S0115	yeah that's really a lot of fun like um you know race around in the desert with nazis chase you and like
S0037	i like their sort of silly voice i suppose i don't memento be a really good film but it's very like it's very involve like it's it's not indiana jones be it
S0115	memento's brilliant it's it's plot be just this crazy plot like that that style of oh yeah well it it's more serious and cos it's more it's ethically a bite like it's a bite of a psychological drama isn't it and uh memento like make you think you know you've get a narrator and the narrator you've you've potentially get an evil narrator haven't you so
S0037	yeah
S0115	like you can't really side with it's it's ambiguous you know like you know it's not like a traditional granddad's film where it's just like the goodies and the baddies be like shoot everybody
S0037	no but i do like some of the film that i watch with me grandda as well like zulu have you see that
S0115	yeah well that's that's that's more of a granddad film innit
S0037	and um
S0115	i haven't i haven't actually see it but uh
S0037	watch a lot of film with me grandda like um bridge over the river kwai and um
S0115	that be about the ethnic yeah the ethnic zulus um but they lose didn't they they they have their
S0037	yeah and um
S0115	they they have their uh they be try to fight for their own land weren't they
S0037	the eagle have land and those kinda ones
S0037	war film really i suppose after his extensive military experience
S0115	oh one of those uh don't mention like don't mention the war with some people like he'll start talk about his war stories
S0037	well he wasn't even in the war he wasn't even old enough
S0115	he he his story he have he have quite a good story like like the one about the uh
S0037	it i mean it still must've be something like okay he wasn't in the war but it still must've be scary to go into like malaysia and that mustn't it
S0115	it'd be pretty horrible yeah i mean i'd i'd hate to be in in that situation where you've get
S0037	just be send there and he's
S0037	sorry it's my fault
S0115	it's alright like it be a very noisy pepper pot
S0037	sorry it hasn't damage that have it
S0115	no it be it be um no it's alright it be
S0037	sorry about that
S0115	no i'd hate to be in in in uh like a in the army in military combat like i mean it's all very well stay fit and survive you know survival train be good
S0037	yeah
S0115	like no it's horrible just have to you know you know to put your life at risk and you you know go into place where you know that someone's try to kill you yeah i mean that's pretty pretty
S0037	but it's yeah it's pretty bad but it's it's funny that he be sure that he be in there with with michael parkinson
S0115	inhumane isn't it well he claim he be i mean we don't know for certain
S0037	it's probably just one of me grandda's tall tale or uh
S0115	like you know i don't doubt that michael parkinson perhaps be a bite of a wimp
S0037	me grandda say he be if it be him he say he be call michael parkinson but obviously it might not have be michael parkinson but they be in the same regiment
S0115	i think you'd have you'd have you'd have know wouldn't you
S0037	me grandda think it be him but
S0115	quite a common name though unfortunately
S0037	exactly but he be from
S0115	well i mean yeah big county
S0037	but he say he be a right wimp but obviously it's me grandda so he's probably just say anything
S0115	what part of england would you live in ideally
S0037	me well i'm a bite bias i like
S0115	
S0037	you mean forever i'd like to have a number of
S0115	just like if you could live anywhere you want
S0037	i'd like to have like a flat in london a place like in

S0115	like a cabin like a castle in uh like cornwall
S0037	d'you know there's a lot of place i haven't be like i've never be to like cornwall exactly or the southwest i've never even be there like the nearest i've been's probably bournemouth or something and that's not even very near at all
