S0192	i mean as the car go there's only sixty miles between the two of us

S0192	yeah
S0199	i mean er the last time we come down when we come down to yours i think the traffic be heavy because there be a lot of road work
S0192	yeah

S0192	or the rail work and
S0199	i do ask if that's the norm for a sunday and she say no

S0199	but erm never mind you can't always trust satnavs can you
S0192	no he's just get a new one for his birthday cos he doesn't trust the old one so
S0199	no i don't think i would trust them fully anyway
S0192	no
S0199	i think i'd still like to have a map in the car and know where i'm go
S0192	yeah definitely
S0199	be you feel hot

S0199	be that better

S0199	yeah i have er i can't have much sugar i really can't
S0192	good
S0199	it upset my stomach big time now it's weird since i've go on this kind of low carb although i've be have more carbs lately erm if i have too much sugar in one go it really upset my stomach
S0192	well that's not a bad thing
S0199	no it's not it's good
S0192	avoid it
S0199	's er yeah 's go to erm sorry just concentrate go to go to the health clinic
S0192	yeah about his stomach he mention that to
S0199	yeah but he's already be he's be to the doctor here and have test and it's come back clear i just say to him well if you're gonna go ask them just to check you for dairy intolerance because that's what he seem to think it be
S0192	yeah
S0199	cheese and yoghurt and a lot of people get dairy intolerance so erm yeah i just hope he's not shut himself away but i'm sure he'll be fine
S0192	i mean he's bind to meet people on his course isn't he and
S0199	yeah he go to lecture he say there be like a hundred and forty odd people in the the lecture hall and it's a big university and he's be go to the gym so he'll be fine
S0192	he's never be quite as social as i be have he so
S0199	no
S0192	he'll er
S0199	no
S0192	he'll figure it out
S0199	he'll have a smaller group of friends i think
S0192	oh he's just gotta make friends before friends get make
S0199	yeah
S0192	i've tell him that before it's important to make as many friends as possible at the begin because within a month or so they're gonna have their divisions
S0199	they get into their kind of group yeah
S0192	and they're gonna decide that these be their friends
S0199	mm
S0192	but he'll erm he doesn't really listen too much do he he just
S0199	no no but then i think that's everyone's the same i think your parent or brothers or sisters talk to you but you still kind of do it your own way
S0192	yeah
S0199	hopefully when you get to kind of a certain age you do kind of listen to some things start a new football group this morning
S0192	do he
S0199	yeah he's erm they're very very good down at where he go and that they be do like in a general club er they're call
S0192	yeah i've hear of them
S0199	and they erm break them into three kind of areas age range and ability and then he speak to us last week and he call out about six lads and he say right i wanna try at eleven o'clock on a saturday erm set you up and maybe create a team within for your age group erm so we go there at eleven today which be much nicer than rush out for nine o'clock in the morning
S0192	yeah definitely
S0199	erm and it be really really good there be only six of them and he get them position properly and pass and think about where they're pass and all this stuff so he love it
S0192	good stuff
S0199	and he do he score a few goals and do a few cartwheel
S0199	i know well he's do gymnastics now at school
S0192	oh be he
S0199	he do dodgeball football and gymnastics after school
S0192	he's involve in a lot
S0199	yeah and then tennis on a monday it be still thirty miles isn't it so to go to
S0192	it's a lot of work for you guy
S0199	well the school ones be okay because i i can't pick him up until quarter past four anyway er so they do it from quarter past three to quarter past four so
S0192	oh so it's additional
S0199	yeah
S0192	they don't have to do it
S0199	no well i have to pay for that after school club
S0192	oh you do
S0199	erm
S0192	how much be it
S0199	er i don't know but they're the actual sport club be like three pound a session
S0192	yeah
S0199	so they just take it off what i pay for the aftercare club so
S0192	mm
S0199	i'm not pay any more
S0192	no
S0199	which be good i wouldn't have do it otherwise i couldn't afford to do like i think it work out about a hundred and five pound or something for these club but luckily it's take off what i pay for anyway so
S0192	you would have have to have pay that then because you couldn't pick him up
S0199	yeah
S0192	and so he'd have have to stay in school regardless
S0199	yeah yeah
S0192	i understand yeah what do parent do about that when the school finish at three and people don't finish work until five or
S0199	well they do what i do pay for the aftercare club but i think it's if i can pick him up by quarter past four i think it's six pound that i have to pay extra
S0192	oh
S0199	pay cos you know he go into breakfast club as well which i have to pay four pound in the morning because i have to start work at quarter past eight so
S0192	that's a joke everyone have to start work early
S0199	yeah
S0192	and then finish late
S0199	yeah
S0192	but you have to pay more for that
S0199	i but he can go there from half past seven in the morning but he doesn't i get him there just before eight sometimes or ten to eight so i only really need it for
S0192	it's quite a long day for him though isn't it
S0199	yeah it be but he go in there and if he hasn't have breakfast at home he'll have some toast there or breakfast and then just play with his friends but to be quite honest it's work really well for him because he didn't settle completely easily when he first go to school so to stand outside with parent and take him into the classroom on the occasion that i do do it he be cling round my ankles and cry so to go into this breakfast club he's get time to settle before he go into school
S0192	yeah
S0199	into his classroom so he's find that easier sorry
S0192	yeah it can't be easy can it for a little child adjust to school
S0199	no well we think he'd adjust really well because he be like the top dog at nursery don't forget he's be go to nursery since he be nine months old erm which i'm glad i wouldn't want you know ideally i wouldn't want to send him to nursery at nine months but he didn't have any other brothers and sisters around and he's thoroughly enjoy the children and the social side of it
S0192	yeah
S0199	for the first six months i don't know if i tell you but for the first six months in my lunch break i use to run over and spend twenty minutes with him and run back so i never get a lunch break it be just like i need to be with him
S0192	oh my gosh
S0199	so i use to sit on the floor and play with him and everything until he go up into the bigger group erm and then when i use to go over he start get a bite silly it be kind of like sleep time and they be try to get them onto bed for their sleep and erm he be just be a bite silly and showy offy with his friends so i think right it's time i've get to stop er i break my heart
S0199	it be horrible cos that it make me feel okay about leave him because i'd go over at lunchtime but erm
S0192	all this effort you put in and then we get older and just start shout at you
S0199	and then you just don't wanna know your mum anymore no that's not true
S0192	well
S0192	you and dad take a completely different route don't know where we be
S0199	what route do dad take then
S0192	i don't know i just don't recognise or the way you're go
S0199	so do dad go that way through the village maybe
S0192	yeah yeah it's this that turn there's a there's er be there a bridge over there
S0199	yeah
S0192	yeah
S0199	yeah so all i've do be
S0192	he he go that way
S0199	keep on the road and come round this way
S0192	yeah he always go that way
S0199	yeah i wonder if he come back this way though cos i'm not oh you can get back through the village and
S0192	i've never see him drive this way erm
S0199	cor my toe's hurt
S0192	yeah how be that
S0199	bruise still swell still
S0192	any less
S0199	erm
S0192	or would you say it's just the same
S0199	no slightly less i think slightly less but it swell up
S0192	that's not much of an improvement though be it
S0199	no
S0192	over the last two months it's like
S0199	no but it's erm it's a difficult one isn't it really your foot cos you're use it all the time
S0192	mm
S0199	it's better when i strap it up
S0192	be it not strap up now
S0199	no but erm but even then when i'm sit at my desk even cos i think maybe if i strap it up it'll be fine but it swell by the afternoon and whether that's just sit in that position so you're put pressure on your leg and
S0192	yeah
S0199	i don't know i don't know just give it time if it hasn't improve much more in another month i'll go back to the doctor's
S0192	yeah
S0199	but from talk to other people i've just you know they say it take months and months to sort out so just have to bear with bear with
S0192	i mean be it possible it will never heal

S0192	i mean if you keep use it
S0199	i might have to have physio maybe i don't know
