S0144	mm mm yeah which happen to me constantly
S0024	i don't know you can tell from their eye yeah if they're look at you like you're an idiot then it's like oh no hang on a minute you completely misunderstand what i'm talk about i think you can fix it
S0144	mm yeah
S0024	whereas on this facebook and stuff and on the telephone i find it really hard
S0144	mm mm
S0024	i find it really hard to
S0144	well i'm absolutely sick of facebook god i'm ninety five percent there to close it
S0024	no don't close it because it's good for the old correspondents you don't have to do all of the update and stuff
S0144	oh god
S0024	why
S0144	just irritate me well so many reason
S0024	yeah i know i know but there's
S0144	just the crap people put on it
S0024	well it's annoy there's so many other people and they're use it and and then
S0144	and then
S0024	like some people if you if you they don't get a message from you or from somebody they're they're offend
S0144	mm mm yeah
S0024	and it's like well i haven't be on it for for two weeks or
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	why would i have send you a message
S0144	and then i i keep get send all these fuck things say oh poor little 's die of whatever
S0024	mm
S0144	pass this on otherwise you're a selfless bastard basically be what it say you know
S0024	mm
S0144	it's like for god sake go away get out of my space i don't want to read all that crap
S0024	yeah it's horrible that people it's almost well it's like an old an old erm i don't mean this in a bad way but like an old gypsy woman cast a spell or something not bad not bad on the gypsies but but it's like a it's like people want to cast curse on you for not
S0144	yeah that's what it's like it's like the old gypsies go around with their lavender or whatever it be and i put a curse on you yeah
S0024	but that doesn't mean like i mean how can they say if you don't answer something like that that you're a bad person
S0144	well
S0024	it's just stupid to say that if they don't post this on their wall then they're a bad person
S0144	it's idiotic but that's how most religions operate as well mm yeah well if you don't go to church you're a bad person
S0024	oh dear that's not very nice at all be it who well not that many people say that nowadays not nowadays
S0144	well they don't now in this country but
S0024	even even people who be religious they say it's okay if you want to pray at home it's alright
S0144	mm yeah but another thing about facebook that i hate be how when you write your message your private message to people and then you have another chat about three years later your previous message be there
S0024	the whole history yeah no but i find a way i find a way to delete it
S0144	and if you've have you know you could be talk about anything
S0024	yeah i know it's not good
S0144	and then it's right there next to your new one so you've get all this history which be directly tie to the present and you can't escape it
S0024	yeah
S0144	i mean some people must be have nightmares with that
S0024	yeah
S0144	i don't like at all because it it it colour the the new message
S0024	it just pop up yeah
S0144	it's not a fresh message it's it's influence by all this baggage of the past
S0024	no i email the other day and that come up and and the last i'd say it be just after she'd get marry and like you know that we didn't go to and 's wed but erm it be just after she get marry and she have put oh hope you're do alright i'm i just get marry to and i say i say on the message oh congratulations that's great right i'm go into the jungle for a bite cos i'm have a rough time erm i'll speak to you when i come out
S0024	and i didn't speak to her since then that be four when do we go
S0144	i'm go into the jungle cos i'm have a rough time

S0024	but that be because we be enjoy and and and i'd put i'll email you when i come out and i never email her back
S0144	that be fuck up man no
S0024	but she be off obviously wasn't enquire how i be do and then i'd put on there the message now i mean how many years ago be that five six
S0144	oh it must have be don't know
S0024	six six years ago something like that and i didn't realise because she be only like an old friend from school wasn't she
S0144	five years ago wow five years ago
S0024	yeah but she be an old friend from school why would i contact her all the time and i don't really do that kind of thing
S0144	yeah yeah yeah
S0024	and she doesn't either obviously cos otherwise there would be some more message and erm yeah the next the next one be wow that be quite a long time i put wow that be longer than i think i haven't be in the jungle that long but how be you god can you believe it but
S0144	yeah and every time you message her she's go to go oh god yeah she never do bloody write to me in that jungle thing
S0024	no i mine be the last message so i'm please that mine be the last message cos
S0144	right well that's another thing well make sure mine's the last message i mean i don't want that kind of relationship with people
S0024	no but but that on the plus side you've you have get these you've get people
S0144	that that be the only plus side be that i've get into touch with people that i think i'd lose
S0024	people that you can yeah and you might not speak to them all the time but they're there and if you need them and you you know the special people that they email you
S0144	but it be only yeah but now you've get their email address can't you just leave it as that
S0024	well it depend on you doesn't it
S0144	well be there a way of get their email address
S0024	yeah well if you've get their email have you get all their everybody's email address nowadays
S0144	well i could ask for them couldn't i
S0024	i hardly use email these days i just use facebook
S0144	well no one do do they yeah
S0024	apart yeah apart from the there be a few people who be just on the
S0144	write like your status
S0024	i don't do anything like that
S0144	you don't even write anything you just click on a button now
S0024	i don't do too much of that crap
S0144	like what you've say
S0024	i only do that but this be the bad manipulative thing because i do that with the people that i know be gonna care whether i like their status or not
S0144	yeah
S0024	you know most of my friends wouldn't give two monkey they wouldn't give two monkey whether i you know be interest in what they say
S0144	but there's no effort be there mm
S0024	oh i like their picture but some people they do give two monkey
S0144	yeah but you can't live your life if you're try to please people who care about stuff you couldn't give two hoot about
S0024	no i know that's what make it well it hard when it's family because when it's friends if they if they're you know they probably wouldn't stay my friends too long if they have expectations like that from me
S0144	but if you look at half of your friends on facebook i bet you don't give a damn about half of those people
S0024	no no i should clean it up really
S0144	but then you can't it's so i don't know it's such a weird thing innit
S0024	it be really weird and now that everybody have get those stupid timelines i'm not get one i refuse unless they make me i'm not get one i can't believe everybody's sign up to it and just click on the button go yeah that look nice i don't
S0144	why don't you want it
S0024	because there's something about it i think erm i be i i saw something on the tv about it and it's to do with access of information again
S0144	i haven't even look at it what do it what be it
S0024	and erm them record your what you haven't look at it
S0144	mm
S0024	right well it's a timeline right from when you start all the way through so then you can look on a year and look at somebody's yearly post or you can click on a month so say like this christmas last christmas you could look at somebody's thing and go right er two thousand and eleven
S0144	but who give a shit who give a shit what i be do last september
S0024	what be you do it's it's basically a diary of your life
S0144	so you're look in other people's diaries
S0024	it's a diary with photos but it's it's different for you because and it's different for me because we don't put picture up right but people who who go round take picture and write load of comment and stuff it's basically a diary a record online diary that everybody can read
S0144	well a diary with entries of five word at a time
S0024	but it but all the photos it's like a photo album as well
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah well i hate it but you don't have yeah i hate it too
S0144	yeah huh so be they go to make everyone do that be they
S0024	they be talk about make everybody do it but i don't know if that's true
S0144	well it will eventually won't it
S0024	i don't want it though i just want my god they keep change it and i don't understand and i
S0144	but they have to keep change it that's the whole purpose you have to
S0024	but i don't want it to change because once i know how to use something then i just want it to continue and like when they change it last time all of the security settings change
S0144	mm
S0024	and like and you're suppose to know that and you're suppose to go on that and change your security again i don't agree with that
S0144	mm
S0024	if you've get security settings to say they can't look at my picture then it should be stick that should be for life why should you have to come and do it again why should they be able to change it but with google
S0144	mm well i be read something the other day it someone be say like oh how so what if they be take our facebook statuses you know what difference be that go to make to my life
S0024	mm depend what you write like we would write stuff about revolutions and shit wouldn't we we'd write
S0144	well
S0024	we'd be arrest
S0144	well we do get cut off didn't we but erm what be i say
S0024	like why why do it matter why do it matter that they have the information
S0144	yeah because it basically have you hear that all of this stuff be go to these big vault in the north pole
S0024	yeah yeah i've hear that i don't know about that
S0144	where you've get these underground storage facilities i don't know if that's cos it's cold and they need to keep it cold cos it run at a super
S0024	such a big hard drive it's go to overheat
S0144	but can you imagine the market possibilities like how to really get like with these computer software now with the amount of data you could really like the data mine possibilities would really intense
S0024	yeah but can you believe that they spend all of this mm
S0144	that's that's what it's about
S0024	but can you believe that this kind of market can produce so much revenue and so much money that it's worth it it's worth it
S0144	well no because it's it's produce nothing it's a point why this society be fuck because it's produce it's not produce anything physical
S0024	no
S0144	all half of no ninety percent of probably what this country produce be just abstract shit
S0024	well it's see what kind of abstract shit people like
S0144	so if it's generate ideas or i mean ideas be good you've get to innovate you've get to progress
S0024	mm
S0144	but when you're generate like market stuff that's just generate greed
S0024	mm
S0144	i don't know and then you've get all of these financial products
S0024	but tom you've get to be really careful on your google because i be on i be on it right erm every time you sign in you're the whole of the google address change to an http and http be what it use to be didn't it do you remember when you use to have to type http dot www
S0144	yeah oh right
S0024	right that's all go right
S0144	oh have it
S0024	now it's just www but if you want high security security where their access to your data
S0144	mm oh i want security yes please
S0024	it's now i don't know if you've notice now if you want high security hotmail be ask me to do it google be do it
S0144	what the phone number
S0024	as soon as you sign into google
S0144	it want your phone number be that no
S0024	no as soon as you sign into google it become a http address and i don't know what they've do but they be talk about their security that erm then anything that you go on while you're log into google any anything you search any website you go on anything like that be all connect to your web to you
S0144	hmm
S0024	to them build a profile of you
S0144	yeah
S0024	but http use to be a normal thing that you use to see
S0144	mm
S0024	so now they're now on my hotmail it flash up high security would you like this high security http and it seem like such a normal thing to do because it all use to be that anyway
S0144	mm
S0024	it use to be that i mean i really don't really know much about it but it i know that use to be that now they're ask me to do that for high security and google do that now and they've just have that erm big european legal battle haven't they with like the
S0144	hmm mm
S0024	with all of your data store all of your data
S0144	mm
S0024	and store while you're log into google they want access to anything that you've search on the internet
S0144	mm mm
S0024	and i'm stop use google chrome i'm not go to use google i'm use mozilla
S0144	well i've notice cos i be try to do something the other day i can't remember what but i have to find out where google chrome be store all of the information
S0024	mm
S0144	and it isn't it's not like internet explorer it store it in this really weird place like really deep inside somewhere and it's it's a real hassle get get to it
S0024	store what
S0144	well store the the cookies and all of the other stuff
S0024	well cos yeah with google chrome you have to delete it from the computer and then you delete it from the google chrome site as well you have to delete it twice
S0144	it's really weird yeah but it's bizarre the way they do it and i don't know why they do it like that
S0024	yeah
S0144	but i don't know it's annoy because you click on something and then every advert that bloody pop up be to do with that i'm still get marquees pop up
S0024	yeah oh marquees we've get to book that yeah
S0144	yeah but you know people would say oh that's convenient
S0024	it's not convenient because i because they're the company that we don't want they're the company that we research and we didn't want them and now they just pop onto the screen all of the time
S0144	mm
S0024	it's ridiculous
S0144	yeah
S0024	but that's why you've get to be really careful with google now
S0144	mm
S0024	and now i think we should change to can we change to mozilla fox
S0144	well it's like it's just well i don't know yeah whatever
S0024	i don't like google anymore i use mozilla fox on the other on dad's computer and it work fine and i'm happy with it and it's nice i don't know why we go on off it we go off internet explorer because we think microsoft take over the world weren't we
S0144	internet explorer's really clunky and it's just horrible
S0024	clunky
S0144	yeah
S0024	they're all the same
S0144	no they're not internet explorer's horrible
S0024	really
S0144	it look ugly it's slow to respond i don't know i just don't like it
S0024	well mozilla fox then i think we should do
S0144	yeah okay
S0024	and you've just get to make sure that you always sign out from your google account
S0144	mm
S0024	cos of those but it's so weird though that http thing i'd like to research it i don't really know what it's all about but that's my idea of it
S0144	and i like the google one because mm mm no i don't know i like the google one because you've get that igoogle stuff with which i use a lot for the currency converters
