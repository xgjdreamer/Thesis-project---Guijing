S0012	the only problem we i use to have when i be a kid we use to go chestnutting and we use to get some really good chestnuts and i like em with the when they're white at the end and you can eat you can peel em and eat em
S0013	yeah
S0012	and the white pith come off in the middle
S0013	mm
S0012	instead of go brown that's awful that oh ever so bitter and you get them when they're white and peel all that pith off
S0013	what and eat them raw

S0013	they do
S0013	mm
S0012	but we use to get load of chestnuts
S0013	yeah
S0012	when you when you think of of er the season when we use to go down to our our woods when we be kid and this be a long while ago in the spring there be bluebells my mum wouldn't have a bluebell in the house

S0013	a shame isn't it
S0012	yeah well someone bring them over didn't they and
S0013	there'll always be english bluebells though i don't think they'll
S0012	well the the other ones be big thugs aren't they they have thick leave that's the problem and they smother all the rest of em
S0013	mm
S0012	i mean bluebells come up in er in the woods in english woods er the english bluebells i mean they come up before there's anything else out
S0013	mm that's why they're so beautiful isn't it
S0012	and that's why they're wonderful and then the bracken and the bramble take over
S0013	yeah
S0012	but they be gorgeous really gorgeous
S0013	we haven't be for about three years now keep say we must go to see the bluebells
S0012	what at

S0013	erm some national trust one wasn't it
S0012	i can't remember what it be call
S0013	i can't remember either
S0012	i think woods be
S0013	but i like
S0012	er that be the best
S0013	yeah i like woods
S0012	if you can call a wood cos they in the sixties they cut all them beautiful english oak down
S0013	yeah but it's all come back now isn't it
S0012	three hundred years old they be
S0013	mm
S0012	and the idiots cut them down do you know the sixties be a really bad time i mean everyone think oh yeah that be great but they build stupid look house
S0013	mm
S0012	they build all them big er skyscraper things like and all that
S0013	yeah they do didn't they
S0012	and they be all damp and horrible and they use to go black with mildew
S0013	yeah they demolish load of them didn't they
S0012	they yeah they pull em all down now what a waste of time that be waste of money
S0013	mm yeah
S0012	but there you go they have to house all them people at the time so they just
S0013	be it a cheaper way of it must've be a cheaper way of build
S0012	well they they not only build
S0013	just concrete
S0012	yeah and that they use to have these big
S0013	mainly wasn't it the tower block
S0012	they use to have these big er concrete precast concrete that's what they use to call it
S0013	yeah
S0012	and they use to just stick em up and bolt em all together and then seal em with something or other but what they didn't know be that the concrete and the steel rods that they put in
S0013	mm
S0012	the concrete react with the steel rods
S0013	react i know
S0012	and that just blow the concrete off and rot the rods
S0013	what a mistake eh
S0012	well that be a quick way to build
S0013	mm
S0012	and they didn't know about that they didn't even they they couldn't've look into it could they they couldn't've research that sort of thing
S0013	no they couldn't they just assume it would be alright
S0012	well when they put these steel rods in floor and what have you they to to to reinforce the floor they put these great big steel rods in didn't they
S0013	mm
S0012	i suppose they get get over it now i don't know cos they still have to have steel rods to reinforce it
S0013	yeah it be just like they use asbestos for load of things and then they realise how dangerous that be
S0012	oh god yeah yeah and there's still load of asbestos about
S0013	yeah
S0012	the white one not the blue one
S0013	yeah they daren't disturb it really
S0012	well they say if you if you if you er seal it that's fine
S0013	mm
S0012	but the people who put them up in the first place have to drill them hole in to hold hold the roof on
S0013	yeah that can't've be good
S0012	no and they use to have asbestos iron board cover
S0013	yes they do and they use to just break up after a while
S0012	they do
S0013	yeah but that must've be the white white one not the
S0012	i don't know what one that be but i mean er any kind of asbestos be dangerous
S0013	mm
S0012	once you once you start play about with it
S0013	yeah
S0012	and of course the iron board cover use to just sort of disintegrate didn't they
S0013	like cardboard weren't they
S0012	yeah and they disintegrate
S0013	yeah and there be like talk about dangerous things like ddt
S0012	oh yeah
S0013	use for to kill fly and they realise how carcinogenic be it

S0013	yeah i know but they do they spray everywhere didn't they
S0012	they do yeah and they spray in the in them high wind that be the problem
S0013	mm right mm yeah

S0013	i suppose they're still discover things aren't they that be dangerous for you
S0012	well you just think what we go through when we be kid they be they have that flit fly spray that be call flit
S0013	mm
S0012	and that be in a little canister and you
S0013	yeah
S0012	pump it
S0013	that be ddt

S0013	yeah
S0012	and all that ddt get
S0013	what do that stand for
S0012	huh i don't know what it stand for you'll have to look it up
S0013	dangerous dangerous i can't think mm i can't even think what it could stand for
S0012	but all that stuff all that ddt get into the rivers
S0013	mm
S0012	and er ruin the fish all the fish build up the ddt inside them and that be kill the things that eat the fish you know like er herons and stuff like that
S0013	yeah
S0012	and it also kill thrushes because they eat the snail that
S0013	mm big chain reaction
S0012	that be a chain reaction
S0013	mm
S0012	and now we get
S0013	ebola
S0012	ebola yeah oh dear that be terrible that be scary that be
S0013	how be they gonna stop that don't know how they're gonna stop it do they
S0012	no they don't know how they're gonna stop it
S0013	if someone come up for a cure soon you well
S0012	but why didn't they stop it in the first place when when that hit rwanda or wherever it be i think it be rwanda ain't it
S0013	yeah
S0012	when that hit that place there be the first year there be around about two hundred and sixty they should've stop it then
S0013	but they obviously didn't know it be gonna spread like it do
S0012	well they should do cos ebola be terrible they know about ebola
S0013	yeah
S0012	otherwise it wouldn't have a name
S0013	yeah
S0012	i mean if that be something new they would go oh whatever's that and
S0013	well the symptoms be like flu though aren't they
S0012	seventy five percent of people die from it
S0013	yeah
S0012	i dunno well they think aid be go to wipe out the world but that didn't do it
S0013	no
S0012	now they think ebola's go to be the most dangerous thing in the world
S0013	yeah
S0012	but the whole point about these diseases be they come along and kill off so many people and so many people be immune to it so those people who be immune to it
S0013	yeah
S0012	live
S0013	yes it's
S0012	it's a weird old world it's i mean it's be happen ever since man begin if you like ain't it
S0013	mm
S0012	diseases and what have you
S0013	yeah
S0012	i mean what happen to er the american indians or no the incas and the aztecs rather when the spanish go over there they take over the common cold and measles and that wipe them out
S0013	yeah
S0012	they didn't know they take it over but that wipe out the aztec and the and the incas
S0013	yeah it's strange isn't it
S0012	yeah cos they'd never they you know they hadn't hadn't have it
S0013	mm i don't know what the answer be really
S0012	keep in your house
S0012	don't go out
S0013	keep away from everyone
S0012	everyone become hermits
S0013	yeah
S0012	then there'd be no spread of diseases
S0013	but will it would it eventually die out if no one
S0012	no because
S0013	catch it
S0012	what what what they reckon this ebola thing become more contagious in a dead body
S0013	really
S0012	yes
S0013	oh dear
S0012	they have er a dead body lay in the in the street for three days
S0013	er

S0013	didn't they know
S0012	yeah they know but no one daren't dare go near it
S0013	oh i see
