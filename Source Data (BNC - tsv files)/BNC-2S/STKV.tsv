S0439	so yeah kind of see me and you in the same boat
S0451	yeah er pretty much yeah
S0439	the exes be come back to haunt us a bite
S0451	and the thing be what's bad be that like part of it be kind of tempt
S0439	mm
S0451	and part of it be really not tempt
S0439	mm well yeah i'm have like a massive this be gonna sound really lame and dramatic but like a massive like inner conflict like a part of me
S0451	i i know i like
S0439	like it's really it's like it's quite overwhelm like
S0451	i know
S0439	i haven't see him in two years and now suddenly
S0451	that be a long time
S0439	yeah he want to come down and he keep send me message like you know you our my our friendship's really important and like
S0451	yeah
S0439	you're so close to
S0451	do you love him
S0439	yeah he be the first person i ever love
S0451	so that's so that be i think again it's so unlike us to talk like this
S0439	i know tell about it
S0451	but i think if you do cos if you people don't love really easily
S0439	no
S0451	but if you really do it's i i think it's it's harder to say like no
S0439	yeah like i it take me a long time to fall in love with him like we date for like eight or nine months before like i actually be in love with him
S0451	really okay
S0439	like i don't fall in love very quickly it take me a long time but yeah he be important to me we date for four years he be the first person i ever love
S0451	okay
S0439	but i just don't trust him as far as i can throw him
S0451	no i mean i like
S0439	i just whatever he say to me i would not i
S0451	no
S0439	wouldn't believe
S0451	i no
S0439	so
S0451	be it because of the stuff he be texting you when he be with
S0439	yeah well
S0451	that girl
S0439	yeah partly that and partly he's i just don't think he's i think he's not a very sincere person
S0451	no
S0439	like the amount of time he's be like he kind of have like this friendship cycle with me he'll talk to me load and load and load and load and then suddenly something will happen and he'll be like i can't talk to you anymore blah blah blah
S0451	mm
S0439	and then he'll just like ignore me and then he'll come crawl back
S0451	why do he say he can't talk to you
S0439	erm so er the last few time it's be because of his girlfriend

S0439	so i have to go and do the conversion course at like
S0451	and then you can do
S0439	and then i can go to a better uni yeah
S0451	okay
S0439	er the well the be quite interest because they link to a like a psychology company call and they do things like erm lie detection and deception and stuff like that and erm micro feature and micro expressions
S0451	okay

S0451	yeah oh god
S0439	like people i know it's creepy isn't it
S0451	like i like i'd hate it like
S0439	just imagine go on a date with somebody who be like a train lie detector you'd be like you'd be fuck
S0451	it would be you
S0439	i would be me
S0451	like online date you'd be like
S0439	liar
S0451	no way
S0451	like i when we meet up i will be able to tell

S0451	yeah
S0439	that academy erm
S0451	yeah that would be
S0439	but then
S0451	pretty cool though
S0439	but then be close to my parent and i could live at home
S0451	okay
S0439	save some money and then go there
S0451	that sound so not a bad idea
S0439	it's like exactly so
S0451	why don't you then like do three months in
S0439	yeah
S0451	erm and then you're not gonna be too much in debt like

S0439	exactly travel be expensive
S0451	you're get no money
S0439	no exactly travel be expensive and i i know people in australia and somebody be like well i can give you a job but because of like the stupid travel visa situation
S0451	mm
S0439	you can only work for the same company for six months
S0451	mm
S0439	and it's like well that's six months of work and then i'm fuck again like
S0451	and then yeah i think in a way it's better like in some you kind of know
S0439	mm
S0451	what you wanna do
S0439	yeah
S0451	do it like
S0439	exactly yeah
S0451	and then because australia's not go anywhere
S0439	no
S0451	but
S0439	and it's still three months' travel i can still
S0451	still exactly
S0439	in nine months' time so but
S0451	and you get such long holiday
S0439	yeah i could always go back out
S0451	then you can then just go back out again
S0439	what about you what about your university course be you still do that or
S0451	yeah so erm i'm like so i start pting in january now
S0439	that's cool
S0451	so yeah i'm really i'm really look forward to that and so then i'm leave it completely open to see if i do wanna do the sport science
S0439	yeah
S0451	or it depend on if those if i'd rather go down that route instead and like like earn straight away or i don't know so
S0439	so it
S0451	you can only you do a ucas so
S0439	yeah
S0451	i'm just gonna keep go with it and see when like when i once i've like train and erm yeah go from there
S0439	so when you start pt in january be that you train to become a pt or
S0451	yeah
S0439	you oh okay
S0451	train to be
S0439	and who be you do that with
S0451	but you can do it at the same time erm
S0439	oh okay
S0451	er pt
S0439	oh okay
S0451	erm so yeah i'm really excite it'll be really good but cos i've at first i think oh why don't i work there but i don't think i will i'll i'll just go either to a gym that's kind of like the one round the corner where you just have
S0439	yeah
S0451	cos i don't i won't have a trouble get clients that won't be too bad erm
S0439	i'll be your client
S0451	exactly there we go
S0451	you're like free pting
S0439	woohoo
S0451	erm so yeah so i'll have that probably and then just like work out if it's people like home or like
S0439	yeah
S0451	like their office gym and stuff like that erm rather than there because like at peak time that place be horrible
S0439	yeah it be yeah it's heave isn't it
S0451	like how be you suppose to like you can't so so yeah i'm just gonna go with it and er me and one of the other girl we like think at the end of it we'll do something together
S0439	that'll be cool
S0451	yeah so yeah
S0439	and also like you know everybody who work there and it's quite
S0451	and by that stage i might be
S0439	yeah
S0439	yeah i don't like you anymore
S0451	exactly
S0439	but it's quite insular and you probably want like
S0451	it it yeah
S0439	your clients to be like you want your professional and your personal live to be
S0451	yeah
S0439	to be separate
S0451	exactly
S0439	kind of
S0451	and i think as well like when you know how kind of things be kind of temporary like
S0439	yeah
S0451	you kind of outgrow things like
S0439	yeah yeah yeah
S0451	and they think that wouldn't happen but where
S0439	yeah
S0451	they've get like like that much i don't i dunno like i think like
S0439	yeah if you spend a lot of time there and you socialise
S0451	yeah
S0439	with the people there and then you start work there like
S0451	exactly
S0439	you know i think you probably could get bore
S0451	yeah and i do get bore
S0439	and just
S0451	so easily
S0439	you just need like friends outside of that and
S0451	exactly
S0439	it's kind of like the politics
S0451	yeah it be
S0439	or the political side of it isn't it
S0451	yeah so i think i'll like it's a or it depend or if i do the go down the uni route
S0439	yeah
S0451	i'm not sure and
S0439	so what
S0451	again it's just money reason uni wise because
S0439	so be you you're not do a course at the moment or you be do a course at the moment
S0451	i'm do another like there's a course on the side which be just like
S0439	oh okay
S0451	nutrition and
S0439	yeah
S0451	food sort of thing but erm but yeah i dunno like it's it's another one like yeah i dunno tear but
S0439	mm it's always how like cos go back to uni be such a financial and
S0451	it be
S0439	like mental commitment
S0451	yeah
S0439	like you really need to be focus how the you're go back to uni to learn like
S0451	exactly
S0439	as a postgraduate as a graduate you can fuck about but
S0451	yeah
S0439	as a postgraduate you've get to be really conscious of it and
S0451	yeah
S0439	like you can't just be like oh yeah i'm gonna go out every single day
S0451	no
S0439	and
S0451	the thing be now we can't at this stage
S0439	yeah exactly
S0451	but
S0439	i know it's so stupid like i'm twenty four years old and i'm still i'm like i'm so old
S0451	i know
S0439	like if i go back to uni
S0451	no
S0439	then just like ah
S0451	though when you go out at like er everyone be so young
S0439	yeah they be yeah
S0451	and i'm just like oh i be talk to some guy and they be like eighteen and stuff i be like oh
S0439	i know i remember go out in oxford with a friend of mine in freshers' week and there's one boy come over and be like how old be you i'm like twenty one and they're like

S0439	they look he look so young it be
S0451	i know
S0439	it be embarrass
S0451	i i know i didn't get id'd and i be like what
S0451	be go on like
S0439	but you look really young i think
S0451	i know
S0439	i think you look young
S0451	i know because everyone think i be like the guy be older
S0439	yeah
S0451	and er it be quite handy cos one of the girls who like be who be do the ticket erm go to one of 's like class
S0439	oh yeah
S0451	so we all get in for free
S0439	oh that's cool
S0439	be the one who do the grit oh no that's
S0451	yeah i think he might have move
S0439	oh really
S0451	i think he's go to do
S0439	ah
S0451	yeah
S0439	it's i'm guess you don't do lift anymore with
S0451	no i
S0439	do you never get back in contact with him
S0451	no i no i didn't
S0439	you should never speak to him again
S0451	i know i might yeah no i would definitely like to say to him like to have a couple of sessions every now and then but it's not every week
S0439	that's the thing like i get like it would be nicer if you do like if you could if you do about two people and it be like forty pound and you could split it
S0451	yeah i know
S0439	twenty pound each but
S0451	but like it's and no one do it like
S0439	no
S0451	like i in a like a group thing i guess it's not really a group thing
S0439	no
S0451	but it's an expensive thing to be really
S0439	yeah forty pound a week be like ridiculous
S0451	yeah it be a lot of money
S0439	and like yeah i don't have a hundred and sixty pound a month to spend on it
S0451	no no
S0439	like i don't actually know
S0451	and if you think about that that's a lot
S0439	how i even afford it
S0451	isn't it really
S0439	yeah
S0451	a lot
S0439	like if you could split then but i don't even think i think it's even like fifty or sixty pound for two people
S0451	really yeah
S0439	so it's still like expensive
S0451	yeah yeah that's a lot of money
S0439	yeah like i really enjoy it but
S0451	and i think you're right like he be not great at like follow through like
S0439	yeah
S0451	so if if that be me and someone hadn't contact back ever and just
S0439	you would get on to them
S0451	sort of chase them or
S0439	yeah
S0451	like you'd be like oh i hope everything's okay like
S0439	mm
S0451	like yeah like
S0439	yeah
S0451	just cos it's your money isn't it
S0439	yeah
S0451	it's so he lose a hundred pound practically in a week and he didn't really do that much to chase it
S0439	no to chase it
S0451	to chase it up
S0439	but it's like i have a physiotherapy session
S0451	where be that
S0439	well not a physio yeah erm like a sport massage it be twenty five pound for the hour because she be do like a new half price deal
S0451	okay yeah
S0439	and then it go up to fifty pound and she message me she be like you know how be you and stuff and i be like i be like i be just i be honest with her i say i can't afford
S0451	yes
S0439	fifty pound for an hour sport massage
S0451	no
S0439	i just can't
S0451	yeah it's
S0439	justify it
S0451	a lot of money
S0439	like like i could get like a pair of shoe for that
S0451	yeah no and that's what's hard now it's like like but the er thing be as well with that be that like cos gyms charge so much to rent
S0439	yeah
S0451	so they're already then have to ask so much
S0439	yeah they do
S0451	for er when it's it be really hard but it's too expensive
S0439	yeah and especially in i can imagine rent in a place in be
S0451	yeah
S0439	really expensive
S0451	to rent for sure if they can like it's like four hundred to four hundred and fifty a month and erm erm and like somewhere like gym
S0439	mm
S0451	they charge four hundred and you have to work there fifteen hours a week as well
S0439	wow
S0451	like crazy so yeah
S0439	yeah
S0451	this be the cheapest one erm but yeah it's really bad like this i can see i would like keep
S0451	i'm like i'm not eat this time
S0451	like
S0439	no food
S0439	oh no see i think you'll be a good pt

S0439	and you care about fitness
S0451	yeah
S0439	like
S0451	and i i hope i'm really look forward to it and i think cos the thing be anyone can be a pt
S0439	yeah
S0451	erm but yeah hopefully you can like i don't the big thing be like diet be be diet
S0439	yeah it's like
S0451	like that's how you
S0439	eighty percent diet
S0451	exactly
S0439	twenty percent actual workout isn't it
S0451	that's how you're actually gonna get the
S0439	yeah
S0451	result erm so yeah but i'm i i kind of wanna get go now so it's really annoy that i have to
S0439	yeah
S0451	wait now
S0439	i know i think wait
S0451	yeah
S0439	be the hardest part isn't it
S0451	it be yeah
S0439	it's really annoy
S0451	that's so excite though with your psychology thing
S0439	i've i'm so so keen to
S0451	yeah
S0439	i'm gonna go home this weekend and talk to my parent about it
S0451	yeah
S0439	just i know like that sound lame but
S0451	yeah i would
S0439	i mean talk to my parent
S0451	talk to my mum about everything yeah that's
S0439	i mean talk like important stuff like that through with them i think be
S0451	yeah
S0439	be important erm cos it will involve like a financial commitment and i will have to pay for it and it's not just one master it's two master
S0451	yeah
S0439	so i will probably have to borrow some money from them or my
S0451	yeah
S0439	grandparents erm
S0451	but in the long run
S0439	but i wanna do it
S0451	in the long run
S0439	yeah
S0451	you'll get a lot more money
S0439	yeah like i don't
S0451	hopefully
S0439	i don't really know where i wanna go with it i know roughly but i'm more do it because i want i'm interest in it
S0451	yeah and
S0439	like
S0451	that i
S0439	i'd want to do that
S0451	and it's like anything if you have an interest in something it's amaze
S0439	yeah
S0451	because not many people do really
S0439	exactly like i like the job i do and i'm good at it
S0451	yeah
S0439	not to not to sound you know arrogant but i'm good at it
S0451	yeah no yeah
S0439	but it's not what i wanna do for the rest of my life
S0451	no no
S0439	and so
S0451	erm and learn be actually great fun
S0439	yeah i really enjoy it
S0451	and like just why not like
S0439	exactly and like if i if i do the conversion and i find it too much or i don't enjoy it as much as i could i can stop it's only what
S0451	exactly yeah the
S0439	i think the the it's something like ten months it's a ten month
S0451	yeah
S0439	like ten so ten ten months of my life that's it
S0451	yeah yeah
S0439	so i can do that
S0451	and that be nothing really
S0439	and if not i still have a publish career of four years
S0451	exactly
S0439	to fall back on so
S0451	yeah
S0439	it's not i don't think it's bad but
S0451	i think that's like a great like a great like cv kind of progress
S0439	yeah
S0451	like i think that's awesome
S0439	like i'm really look forward to it
S0451	yeah no you're leave but yeah
S0439	oh yeah but i only live like fifteen or twenty minutes down the road so
S0451	yeah
S0439	i'll be back
S0451	so where be
S0439	er be towards but my parent actually live just just past
S0451	okay
S0439	so
S0451	so how would you
S0439	well you
S0451	so
S0439	just go up erm the a14 and then you get onto the m6
S0451	oh how long will that take
S0439	take about forty minutes
S0451	oh okay thing be as well when you're go not like to make friends or
S0439	yeah
S0451	like the amount of effort be gonna be reduce that
S0439	yeah
S0451	because you're not there to like be popular and you're like
S0439	exactly like
S0451	you're there to learn
S0439	it'll be nice to meet people
S0451	yeah that's
S0439	but i that be not like i have friends like
S0451	yeah exactly
S0439	and yeah i'm go i want to to learn to uni to learn and get a degree like
S0451	yeah
S0439	i've be to uni and i've do the whole go out all the time and meet people and
S0451	i know and er yeah it's do and that
S0439	like yeah
S0451	i think that's quite nice to just check that off and
S0439	yeah
S0451	like erm well how will you find move back home
S0439	i think that will be rough
S0451	yeah
S0439	like my parent annoy the fuck out of me
S0451	yeah that will be hard then
S0439	erm it's also it's really really well not annoy more sad my mum be probably gonna be make redundant
S0451	oh no
S0439	so her school erm her school become an academy
S0451	okay
S0439	and so the academy just come in and basically be just make everybody
S0451	okay
S0439	redundant and restructure so
S0451	oh that's so shit
S0439	yeah she's apparently be make redundant and their last day will be the thirty first of december so start the new year with a bang
S0451	oh that
S0439	woohoo
S0451	that be rough
S0439	yeah so erm i think
S0451	oh poor thing
S0439	and you can only start look for a job after something like three months or something but
S0451	really
S0439	yeah you can't go you can't look for a new job straight away because you then disqualify your redundancy package so you won't get pay the money basically erm but i think she's like i could take early retirement i be like no you can't
S0451	no
S0439	like i think my dad
S0451	yeah
S0439	would go crazy
S0451	yeah
S0439	if she be there all the time so
S0451	yeah
S0439	but anyway
S0451	and erm well and they won't mind you come home
S0439	i don't think so
S0451	no
S0439	not to go to university like
S0451	yeah
S0439	if i go to obviously it would be an issue and i wouldn't i would probably stay in
S0451	yeah
S0439	i don't know
S0451	that would be quite rough
S0439	but
S0451	mm
S0439	erm or i if i'm there two days a week and i stay in
S0451	yeah but that
S0439	like four days a week or something
S0451	cos that be true like the erm hours drive in probably aren't that much
S0439	yeah exactly which be kind of annoy in a way but
S0451	cos more of your parent
S0439	yeah exactly
S0451	yeah
S0439	i think or the conversion course be about five grand which isn't too much
S0451	five grand okay
S0439	yeah
S0451	that's not too too bad
S0439	yeah
S0451	so
S0439	like a lot of them
S0451	yeah
S0439	can be more like law er like a law conversions be like twelve grand
S0451	they be a lot of money
S0439	it's ridiculous

S0451	oh yeah okay
S0439	but i always want to be a lawyer
S0451	yeah i've always my dream
S0451	i guess for that cos they've get to cram so much into that
S0439	yeah
S0451	oh god
S0439	but also the amount of money they're gonna make in the future
S0451	yeah
S0439	off the back of it
S0451	yeah yeah yeah
S0439	be gonna be
S0451	a lot
S0439	massive
S0451	yeah
S0439	like so they can charge that much
S0451	yeah
S0439	erm
S0451	oh that's i think it's a bite of change anyway have you be er for four years at the
S0439	erm
S0451	at that place
S0439	no i be three year two and a half years at another company and then
S0451	okay
S0439	a year and a half if i leave in june it would be a year and six months year and
S0451	okay
S0439	seven months so altogether
S0451	well that's quite that's quite nice
S0439	it come to about four and bite years
S0451	erm time to have
S0439	yeah
S0451	a change
S0439	exactly
S0451	isn't it yeah
S0439	yeah but
S0451	excite
S0439	would if you want or go to uni would you go to university around here
S0451	i would go back here
S0439	in
S0451	so i can stay at home
S0439	yeah
S0451	erm yeah i like there be cos like it's the only thing be what you say as well like unis all the way round here be all
S0439	yeah
S0451	from they're really good ones
S0439	yeah
S0451	erm erm but that's what i i don't i
S0439	but a degree's a degree at the end of the day
S0439	like
S0451	yeah
S0439	so like that's why the conversion course get it from a polytechnic doesn't bother me
S0451	no cos you've still get a degree from
S0439	yeah
S0451	so
S0439	exactly and also they're still good universities
S0451	yeah
S0439	like for in term of like psychology be actually like in the top i think thirty universities
S0451	really
S0439	in the country which you know it's not the top ten but it's still
S0451	no but
S0439	it's top er
S0451	if you think how many universities
S0439	exactly
S0451	there be yeah it's like
S0439	so it's not they're not
S0451	no
S0439	bad unis
S0451	no
S0439	they're just it's that historical
S0451	yeah
S0439	snobbery
S0451	it it and it be that's all it be isn't it it's snobbery
S0439	yeah
S0451	but yeah i don't know i think i will probably to be honest i kind of have the idea that i think i'll get stick into work
S0439	yeah
S0451	and erm kind of be like well kind of enjoy the
S0439	yeah
S0451	and hopefully make enough money
S0439	but you've be successful without a degree so far
S0451	yeah
S0439	haven't you so
S0451	exactly yeah
S0439	it's not like you need one
S0451	and that's the thing i'm just like cos for me it would be three years
S0439	oh okay yeah
S0451	i'm just like i would i think agree to three years be
S0439	it's a massive commitment
S0451	quite a lot of time and i'm just like
S0439	and we all know you're a commitment phobe
S0451	exactly so so seriously
S0439	come from another commitment phobe
S0451	i i know
S0451	like a year i would be like okay three years if i'm
S0439	yeah
S0451	i don't think i can commit to that
S0439	yeah no
S0451	erm cos i'm just like well what if i want to do this or
S0439	or want to yeah like it'd be like you fuck hate it yeah
S0451	i know and i probably will but
S0451	probably will happen
S0439	yeah
S0451	so i think i will probably try and be sensible and in a way not do the uni
S0439	yeah
S0451	option
S0439	but also
S0451	erm
S0439	nutrition erm be an industry where you don't necessarily need like if you want to go into like you know like
S0451	it be that
S0439	football or
S0451	yeah
S0439	rugby club
S0451	yeah
S0439	like that type of level
S0451	yeah
S0439	but like yeah like professional sport level
S0451	yeah
S0439	but everyday like you know normal level

S0439	you can be just as successful
S0451	like like yeah exactly
S0439	without a degree like
S0451	yeah
S0439	people don't care if you've get a degree people care if you even know what you're talk about
