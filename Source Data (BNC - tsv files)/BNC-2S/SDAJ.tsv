S0084	the curry sauce be good
S0041	yeah it be
S0084	mm mm
S0041	it more i've never have before
S0084	mm
S0041	yeah and i've have that belt since i be seventeen
S0084	oh my god that's awesome
S0041	seventeen you know it's like my favouritist belt it's really not very fashionable now but it just fit perfectly on that hook on the tighter hook
S0084	mm oh nice mm winner eat more chip that's clearly the answer
S0041	yeah clearly the answer not to think yes this be go really well keep it up no eat chip and curry that be the answer
S0084	mm yeah uh huh that be always the answer mm
S0041	my next step which obviously won't probably be this year but you know it's alright
S0084	mm
S0041	be my aim be to wear a bikini i've never wear one in my life before like in my whole life never
S0084	mm wow
S0041	never never never never
S0084	but you wear a trikini
S0041	well yeah there isn't much to that
S0084	yeah
S0041	but that be the most naked thing i've ever own
S0084	right
S0041	swimwear wise
S0084	yeah i mean absolutely hate it but i don't know i don't know why i don't own a swim costume i suppose cos i don't go swim
S0041	mm
S0084	if i'm if i'm in beach wear it's because i'm on the beach and in which case i want to get a brown tummy
S0041	yeah
S0084	but only because i want to lie somewhere i don't want to go walk around so i always sarongs etcetera
S0041	mm parade yes so that's my aim before i die and i figure over the next couple of years he's probably go to be the closest i'm go to get to that
S0084	mm nice army train army boot camp
S0041	army boot camp do you think after the army boot camp take like twelve weeks or whatever it be you get a holiday or do you just have to go straight into it
S0084	mm i think they give you a holiday to like kiss your family goodbye i mean you will come back presumably you know
S0041	mm cos maybe that would be perfect time for eighteen thirties crazy holiday
S0084	ooh naked holiday
S0041	naked holiday basically yeah cos i really want to do this as well i mean i think i'm too old already so what's go to happen be
S0084	you're go to do an eighteen to thirties holiday
S0041	yes
S0084	right
S0041	and it all sound very good in my head and hilarious fun with load of teenage boys however i think in actual practice after five days i'm go to want rip my own eye out
S0084	you're go to want to kill everybody you know the staff all the younger kid because it's they're all go to be tiny and young
S0041	all the scream girls yeah yeah they will actually just be eighteen that's the problem
S0084	mm
S0041	but erm that i work with which you wouldn't think of this if you meet him he use to rep
S0084	mm
S0041	in greece and he say well you can still do those type of holiday at those resort but not with eighteen thirties
S0084	eighteen year olds oh okay
S0041	so there be place that be set up for that holiday but they don't specify themselves under the eighteen thirties bracket so they don't
S0084	mm
S0041	they get young people but most young people will go to the brochure club travel agent place and ask for eighteen thirties he say but there's quite load of other company that do it they just don't advertise as that so i could do that
S0084	mm there you go that's an idea that be always mine and my sisters backup plan be to be holiday reps i think there be some sort of tv show at the time that all look very glamorous and everyone be have a lovely time
S0041	yep
S0084	but i think in reality you would probably kill everybody
S0041	yes and you'd be knackered
S0084	mm
S0041	absolutely whack all the time
S0084	mm yeah
S0041	all the time
S0084	it's like my friend become an air steward she love it and have a brilliant time though like fly still drink the next day sober up on a plane

S0084	no
S0041	like get them fire they would be in really big trouble
S0084	well in theory it's whether it depend how far you take it
S0041	yeah i think from what from what my michael's say which be why he didn't want me to go in as an officer be so you know i don't think you'll have so much fun cos you know people won't be able to have a laugh and banter with you like they can with each other cos they're really not allow it's really really strict
S0084	erm that's a good thing
S0041	yeah and i'm think yeah that's a good thing thank
S0084	mm
S0041	which i can see where he's come from like if you want to go and have a piss up and a laugh
S0084	mm
S0041	yeah but i'm think twenty five erm that i would have probably find that amuse for about three weeks and then want to die
S0084	yeah and then you've get four years
S0041	yeah
S0084	mm
S0041	i suppose that's one good thing at least they won't actually be able to say it to my face

S0041	yeah yeah yeah you can't let your guard down really can you

S0041	you might have an officers' mess on the boat where you can just be where you can be silly together

S0084	i might need to start read you know heat
S0041	i hate that type of stuff
S0084	well that's my problem i actually detest it it's so negative you know the circle of shame you know laugh at everyone all the time if they've just get a little bite of if they've get a spot or a bite of bloody cellulite and you think no wonder girls have get eat disorder
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	that and i go in mango recently buy a a yellow jumper and a medium be a ten
S0041	i'm so glad you say that cos i go into mango and try on a a dress in a large and there be no way i be get in it
S0084	it's disgust mm but that's like that's a twelve
S0041	ah right well that probably make some sense then
S0084	in in mental mango world a large be twelve
S0041	cos i usually think a large be a fourteen and an extra large be a sixteen
S0084	yeah
S0041	that's what i would go for
S0084	well in european size i suppose it be cos they're all quite petite but even by their standards that's disgust because you're say to girls who be twelve which be an average size you're large
S0041	you're large
S0084	so no wonder girls have get eat disorder
S0041	yeah that's
S0041	it's it's so responsible isn't it
S0084	i can't believe that
S0041	a twelve be a large shit hell there's no hope for anybody
S0084	i mean you can fuck off yeah you might as well just kill yourself now

S0041	really love it
S0084	hmm it's fine love it it's like bella chat take a break
S0041	i like take a break
S0084	you've put that on the wrong way
S0041	oh piss oh
S0084	your life be so hard isn't it i mean other people might say they would hold up the er cover before they put it on just to check
S0041	no

S0084	erm the thing be though they'll actually you know train you in this that's their job but i suppose lot of people go in the army and navy and whatever and have you when you be young
S0041	i suppose they don't really know what they've get their work cut out for with me do they
S0084	well no
S0084	dearie me the noise
S0041	right that's it that will just do now all of you over there that's all do now
S0084	mm
S0041	all do now over now oh thank god for that huh
S0084	do you know what be tell me about be in the mess there when you do your train he be say that his drill sergeant be such an arse and want things so precise like he'd really punish the week before for not have his bed exactly like at a right angle all this carry on so they spend the whole him and his bunk mate spend the whole day get their stuff like wash iron they scrub the place on the floor they sleep on the floor naked so that they didn't mess up the bed and so when the guy come in at six o'clock in the morning he come in and he throw everything around like he'd pull everything out of the cupboards throw stuff on the floor he go mental and he be like you two you live in shit and he make them run around outside for like an hour
S0041	no what
