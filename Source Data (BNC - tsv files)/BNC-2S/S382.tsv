S0441	you could've pay forty seven pence less for your comparable grocery shop elsewhere today you could've put forty
S0439	oh good god
S0441	i'm fume
S0439	how how be you gonna survive without that forty seven pence
S0441	it do mean that i get four hundred and seventy point though
S0439	wahey i've always want i do think that's ridiculous like the amount of point morrisons give you
S0441	don't know if they do
S0439	if you save if they cost more
S0441	what you mean a lot
S0439	yeah i think it be a lot it's one point per penny like
S0439	that's excessive
S0441	no it's not it's like
S0439	i don't well it's ten point per penny
S0441	ten point per penny that's what i think
S0439	and that be that be an extreme to be honest
S0441	they must believe that they be really cheap then
S0439	mm they must mustn't they

S0439	they kill fly that's all they do
S0441	to be fair though i wonder if they weren't around have like thousands upon thousands of fly that we would just hate
S0439	probably a good idea but yeah i thing that's the erm the butterfly effect isn't it
S0441	yeah
S0439	the point be if you clear all one creature or you you make one small difference it's a massive impact

S0439	last week me and go to see macbeth
S0441	oh yeah
S0439	well it be fine it be like oh you know everybody know the story of macbeth it wasn't it wasn't anything different although didn't realise that it be actually in shakespearean
S0441	oh dear so that's
S0439	so
S0441	gonna be hard for her
S0439	so most of the time i think she be like i be like do you actually know what just happen no five minutes later do you know now do you now know what's happen no
S0439	do you know what he just say
S0441	to be fair i'd probably struggle with that as well
S0439	yeah definitely see like especially macbeth macbeth be a hard one but there's the whole point at the end where it's like erm macbeth cannot be kill by anything bear of woman and then the whole point be that erm macduff's then like but i be not bear of woman because i be rip from my mother at an untimely hour or something like that which basically be a really posh way of say he be a caesarean
S0441	he be premature
S0439	he be premature yeah
S0441	caesarean
S0439	erm and so there's a massive point of obviously macbeth's like shit i'm gonna die and just stop fight and in the end 's like oh i don't know why he stop fight because he be definitely gonna win that battle and it be like you just miss the whole point of that scene
S0439	but it's not i mean
S0441	keep up
S0439	yeah yeah and like english people struggle with shakespearean so i'm not surprise a french person will struggle
S0441	yeah
S0439	so
S0441	at least she you know be will to go there
S0439	exactly
S0441	good effort
S0439	so but no that be alright bite of shakespeare

S0441	i don't know
S0439	yeah you just
S0441	i won't do that until i've eat all the
S0439	yeah until you've actually cut through what you've you probably have like a pizza in there like snuggle away in the back
S0441	probably have get a pizza in there
S0441	secret pizza
S0439	you're like get through get to the bottom and be like what the fuck
S0441	be a happy day though
S0439	i be i submit the the request for the council tax to move out on the sixteenth or the seventeenth of december
S0441	okay
S0439	not that it er they're not gonna obviously monitor if we move out i think that's the thursday actually and i mean to do the friday or well either day it's it's the wrong day but it's that week
S0439	and it's not even though our tenancy might not end we'll probably be move out because i'm
S0441	yeah
S0439	not gonna come back here over christmas so
S0441	and you're not gonna
S0439	it'll mean we might pay a bite less to council tax
S0441	yeah so what be what happen then
S0439	so i think they'll resend us a
S0441	okay
S0439	and let us know how much cos we won't obviously won't have to keep pay a hundred and forty five pound each month
S0441	no
S0439	especially if we're only here for half of december they'll
S0441	be that like a year thing then
S0439	yeah it's yearly
S0441	so they all they're calculate it over the year
S0439	yeah so you pay a hundred and forty five pound per month and that come to the sixteen hundred or whatever
S0441	mm
S0439	the house be worth
S0439	and we start in april so
S0441	what if we have to pay more
S0439	we won't
S0441	be it do by sort of or by
S0439	it be yeah it's do in by installments yeah they per house for instalments they have so the cost of this house be sixteen hundred and they need to divide sixteen hundred by the amount of months you be here
S0441	oh
S0439	so if we're only here till mid december they should recalculate it and only charge us for the rest of november and then half of december or whatever
S0441	so don't have to six hundred pound
S0439	no no no no oh no it's per month it's per year
S0439	so whoever's have it's like remember last time when we move in like we have to pay like you remember last time when we move in like
S0439	we have to pay like two random council
S0441	yeah
S0439	tax instalments that be just to cover cover the last
S0441	instalment
S0439	three months of that last year
S0441	i see
S0439	so
S0441	make sense
S0439	so yeah and then i'll ring the electricity company and the gas and water company at some point so
S0441	okay
S0439	cos we need our final bill from them i don't wanna be stick like that woman who move out last time and didn't pay her water bill
S0441	no that's stupid she er yeah you need to tell them
S0439	yeah
S0441	shall i erm be we actually cancel the internet on the day that we actually move out
S0439	yeah to save us money
S0441	for example if i over christmas cos i'm gonna be work sort of between christmas and new year so if i need here i might just come back here
S0439	mm
S0441	i mean if we're allow that's all
S0439	yeah if we're not allow then
S0441	that's fine
S0439	they can't charge us to be here
S0441	no erm so i'll cancel the internet when i know that we're definitely not gonna ever come back here
S0439	yeah
S0441	should be less than how much do i say it be two hundred and fifteen
S0439	two hundred and that would've be in like
S0439	end of september wouldn't it
S0441	yeah
S0439	so there's still october november december
S0441	so it shouldn't be too much end of december so it should be i dunno it run out in august
S0439	that's eight what's eight time three twenty four no that doesn't make sense
S0441	what do you mean
S0439	cos you say the guy say it would be two hundred pound to cancel it
S0441	yeah i know i don't really know why that be cos that's a lot less than what it actually should be
S0439	that's a lot less than what it should be yeah dammit we should've cancel then no just be like i last speak to this guy he
S0441	yeah
S0439	give me two hundred pound to cancel this
S0441	please listen to the re record message of there there be one
S0439	yeah
S0441	or or or the record
S0439	yeah er you tell me this
S0441	mm so it should be well it'll only be what be it january february march april may june july august so thirty time eight
S0439	well that's twenty four two hundred and forty odd quid
S0441	ah
S0439	plus thirty five or thirty two or whatever so it'd be like two hundred and sixty two hundred and seventy quid still not quite sure what he be go on about to be honest
S0441	i don't know what they be go on about either i mean he think it be january he be most confuse
S0441	maybe in india it be january think he be go by a different calendar
S0439	maybe i be furious at the weekend cos i get my erm renewal for my car insurance and it come up and the cost be six hundred and thirty two pound i be like no no no no when i renew it last year i get it down to four hundred and eighty pound why have it now go up by over a hundred and fifty pound so i ring them up and i be like erm excuse me this be this be wrong and i'm not pay it and she be like oh okay they reduce it to four hundred and thirty five they actually drop it to two hundred pound just because i call up and complain about like
S0441	imagine how many people they they must get without
S0439	yeah
S0441	them realise
S0439	however they just people just don't care how much they pay for their car like i'm sorry i be like i've get four years' no claim bonus i'm sorry there's no way that this year have to be more than last year
S0441	try their luck

S0441	but if that's the case then that's really sad
S0441	to have that you need that in your life
S0439	i don't even like put things on facebook like if i be in a relationship i wouldn't put things on facebook with them anyway i just don't particularly like it it's my privacy it's my like i can't think of anything more crass than someone be like happy anniversary darling
S0441	oh god
S0439	we've be together for a year lot of love i love you so much we're gonna be together for ever it's like fuck off no you're not
S0441	if i do that would probably be like this be over now
S0439	yeah but but if i be in a genuine relationship with somebody and they write anything like that about me on their facebook page i would be have serious problems i'd be like why have you just declare your love for me on facebook get off
S0441	it's embarrass
S0439	it's just horrible can no longer do that
S0441	yeah but she's do it with all her friends now
S0439	yeah i do see that yeah
S0439	like she's always like look forward to see you so much
S0441	i understand that why be her main point of of communication with anyone
S0439	facebook
S0441	via facebook
S0439	exactly why not all
S0441	even their facebook wall
S0439	yeah like not even like a facebook private message but an actual facebook wall post it's like
S0441	just weird
S0439	not everybody care about what you do
S0441	next she'll be tag them in statuses she probably already do that
S0439	hang out with blah blah today
S0441	go away
S0439	don't give a shit like no offence no one give a shit when you be hang out with why do people care if you're not
S0441	be he actually go out with this girl
S0439	mm
S0441	they're just date
S0439	i don't know i think when i saw him a few weeks ago they be just date i don't know i think it'd be hard if they suddenly if suddenly go out with somebody else so quickly then do
S0441	mm
S0439	not that and be the same person but yeah
S0441	i think he aspire to be a lot though
S0439	mm
S0441	in term of relationship
S0439	but she look like she's completely different to i mean she look a bite more skanky i'm not gonna lie
S0441	yeah
S0439	she definitely look a bite more trashy
S0441	maybe he need a bite of trash 's a bite too prim and proper isn't she really
S0439	's very prim and proper
S0441	's so frigid
S0439	yeah i still despite that they be together for what seven years i still find it hard to believe that they ever have sex
S0441	they never have sex they never have sex
S0439	i bet they didn't could you imagine them have sex she'd just be like
S0441	no er he'd break
S0439	well she'd just be like that's enough now
S0439	i bet they just literally do one position like
S0441	well she'd just have one thrust and then that'd be it and then
S0439	yeah
S0441	she'd pat him on the head
S0439	i can't imagine get down and dirty like actually to be fair i can't really imagine get down and dirty with her exactly
S0441	no
S0439	but they just and you can just imagine be the person that would say thank you after or something
S0439	bless him
S0441	i be just about to say oh i love you but then that's that's that's not really that bad be it but then it be quite bad
S0439	i still think it's a bite weird if he just if he like he just he just come and then there's this i love you it's like so you love me because i just have sex with you
S0441	i think that's the wrong thing to say anyway when you're have sex with somebody
S0439	yeah there's there's a time and place for i love you
S0441	not when you're have sex
S0439	and it's not when you're have sex and it's not on a facebook wall

S0441	mm
S0439	but because i now go to the gym on friday lunchtime so i go to the gym at one one till two only there's like an hour and a half leave of my day so it's fine
S0441	do you get an hour break then lunch break
S0439	yeah
S0441	that's good
S0439	yeah
S0441	so you only work seven hours a day
S0439	yeah

S0439	yeah
S0441	i only get half an hour
S0439	ah this week's gonna be bore i haven't really do much
S0441	only monday
S0439	yeah i know i don't really think i have much go on for the rest of the week i've get some different things but that's fine that's only by thursday i've get run tomorrow and then netball on thursday night that'll be fun although in the winter it get really hard to motivate yourself to go
S0441	yeah
S0439	netball not so much run really need to motivate myself to go
S0441	yeah
S0441	plus i've a yoga class to go to
S0441	i think i think think there's one in which be mean to be good but
S0439	what in the village hall
S0441	yeah it's
S0439	yeah
S0441	charge be so expensive
S0439	yeah the one i do at be a hundred and twenty pound for fourteen weeks
S0441	what's that
S0439	like eight quid an hour
S0441	but then that's good because the ones that be in be like ten quid
S0439	shit
S0441	that's ridiculous
S0439	i think hers be ten pound if you just do a drop in
S0441	yeah
S0439	whereas it's a hundred and twenty for like a fourteen week block
S0439	and she's really nice cos i say to her i be like i'm really sorry i really wanna do this but i can't afford a hundred and twenty pound like off like straight off and she's like i be like do you mind if i pay you in instalments and she be like no that's fine
S0441	that's good
S0439	so that's good
S0441	have to see what it's like
S0439	like it's really good i don't buy into the cos she do like the whole like everybody join in with the om and i don't do that and i don't really she come out with some nice stuff but it's just stuff that doesn't really make any it it doesn't seem particularly realistic like she be say when you're yoga you have be one with yourself and clear your mind of all unnecessary thoughts and i think it's so much easier to say that than do that
S0441	it be but it's like a it's a a what's the word it's a what's the word like a skill almost isn't it
S0439	yeah yeah you've gotta learn how to do it and she be say like when a think pop into your head give it a number so number one be really important thoughts and then the less important the lower the number so if you have a think and you give it number five then just push all number fives out of your head and i'm like but again that's so much harder to do than actually it sound and she's like i'm gonna open the door let all your thoughts go away i'm just like no because now i'm just think that isn't gonna work
S0441	sometimes it really help me but sometimes it doesn't like
S0439	mm
S0441	when erm if like focus your beliefs it's all mindfulness and stuff isn't it
S0439	oh yeah it's all about mindfulness yeah and just be in the moment
S0441	which in theory work quite well but it's just really hard
S0439	yeah especially when you're someone who doesn't who be cynical about it
S0441	yeah
S0439	cos then you kind of don't expect it to work so it doesn't work
S0441	yeah
S0439	which i know be my fault but
S0441	i'm quite open to it i think ow
S0439	the oven glove
S0441	i think it doe oh help ow
S0439	they've just come out of a boil hot oven of course they're gonna
S0441	yeah but i wasn't sure if they be ready or not
S0439	no i think yoga do help it definitely help my stretch and it definitely make me feel better
S0441	yeah
S0439	but it's super hard
S0441	oh my god it's so hard
S0439	like i come i i come out sweat and everything
S0441	it's really hard
S0439	no
S0441	quite a lot of er mash there but never mind
S0439	but i enjoy do it on a sunday night like it's a good good way to end the weekend and get ready and
S0441	yeah i think it's quite relax actually
S0439	mm
S0441	a relax way
S0439	it's really peculiar because she's a very peculiar shape woman
S0441	have you say this to me before can't work out how she's do yoga

S0441	okay well erm have you find a new er a house blah blah blah yeah
S0439	i have a look on spareroom but it kind of erm it's difficult because obviously there's no one

S0439	yeah there's like so many up
S0441	that's good
S0439	spareroom have load of options and i'm really look for somewhere really cheap

S0441	you definitely go to australia
S0439	yeah i think so
S0439	i think either for three months and then go to university in september or erm go to oz for a year and then come back and go to university dad dad say to go for the year and then come back and go to university and a part of me want to do that and then a part of me also think i probably should go straight to university but then i don't think i'll ever have the opportunity to go have a break again so but it depend on what i can afford so cos i'm pretty skint
S0441	yeah
S0439	i think by like next june i'll have about eight thousand in save so which isn't bad but it's not really enough to do for university and go travel so
S0441	but it's not though
S0439	no but i can work in oz that's not a problem like i've speak to somebody who work at and they're like we can get you some casual work and stuff but it's still
