S0063	okay well let's get it start
S0147	okay
S0063	eh we'll talk about work in a minute aren't we
S0147	yeah
S0063	and i be just wonder you get you've get a yorkshire accent
S0147	i have
S0063	i be just wonder and you're from
S0147	i be
S0063	i be just wonder where in yorkshire be
S0147	it's in south
S0063	cos
S0147	yorkshire
S0063	oh right
S0147	yeah it's in south yorkshire i think they have actually change the boundaries em over the last few years but it's still but it be actually class as south yorkshire
S0063	gotcha yeah
S0147	but i think em that where i use to live em be quite a broad accent but em neighbour areas such as and
S0063	mm
S0147	i think if you compare their accent with you can really see the difference
S0063	they'd be different yeah
S0147	cos they're very very much more broad
S0063	yeah
S0147	and i think a bite more difficult to understand yeah
S0063	yeah yeah michael parkinson come from
S0147	he do
S0063	yeah i hear that yorkshire be a really massive place bigger than wales and it be in the map
S0147	yeah yeah
S0063	it's a massive place it's just get em
S0147	mm
S0063	it's it's all over the east of the pennines
S0147	mm
S0063	almost go up towards
S0147	yeah
S0063	but the accent change again to a different kind of one
S0147	it do it do yeah
S0063	yeah
S0147	yeah but i think my accent's change a lot because i've live in em for now thirty eight years
S0063	yeah
S0147	thirty eight years and i but when i listen to myself back on a record
S0063	yeah
S0147	i think sometimes that i sound quite yorkshire and there's certain things that i know i definitely say that be very yorkshire isms but
S0063	yeah
S0147	you might you know that better than me
S0063	yeah yeah
S0147	you might do you pick that up
S0063	yeah a little bite yeah you you you take you it's definitely the same accent as sean bean the actor but it's not as strong
S0147	be it now
S0063	so it's as if it's become more mild
S0147	yeah
S0063	and it's move towards move towards a neutral kind of accent
S0147	mm
S0063	but it's not not there
S0147	yeah
S0063	you know kind of thing
S0147	yeah
S0063	but it's like quite flat kind flat really direct vowel sound
S0147	mm
S0063	you know
S0147	i don't think i sound as though i don't know i don't feel as though i've pick up a boltonian accent because that be very very em unusual and our friends who be bear and breed in

S0147	yeah
S0063	so what happen be i spend most of my childhood try to speak posh without realise i be do it
S0147	mm
S0063	and then at about the age of eleven or twelve i suddenly get my burton accent and then the funny thing be when i be fourteen i move away from burton
S0147	mm
S0063	so i have this upper midlands accent probably
S0147	mm
S0063	for about three years
S0147	yeah

S0063	the accent down there be very different it's quite em it's quite nasal an essex and essex be basically after the second world war
S0147	mm
S0063	essex be very agricultural after the second world war em maybe start just before it there be lot of overspill from london when the londoners be bomb out and eh instead of like rebuild slum in the east end they build out and out and out into south essex
S0147	mm
S0063	so essex be really kind of well when i be there in the nineteen eighties it's like one generation away from be cockney's nearly all of them
S0147	mm
S0063	you know obviously you have to go right in the stick to get a cockney accent
S0147	yeah
S0063	which be more like kent
S0147	yeah
S0063	and it's like it's a bite like ooh ar ooh ar kind of thing
S0147	mm
S0063	but you just don't get it you know in the urban areas
S0147	mm
S0063	so i be there for a few years and then em i go to university down there in east london as well cos it be local eh like i could contact me family that be nice

S0147	to people and i know i do it but it be just the way that she say it
S0063	yeah
S0147	and eh she say it
S0063	that's a kind of a burtonian thing as well cos i mean
S0147	yeah
S0063	i i probably as a child i felt nostalgic for burton on trent
S0147	yeah
S0063	and the person that i imagine feel nostalgic for
S0147	yeah
S0063	would be my best friend's mum
S0147	yeah
S0063	cos she say oh me likkle cabbage would you like some treacle
S0147	yeah
S0063	yeah yes please you know treacle pie
S0147	yeah
S0063	and she'd fee me up until i be burst with cake you know you know whereas i move down to when i'm technically five cos i leave there when i be five
S0147	yeah
S0063	i don't feel so nostalgic you know
S0147	mm
S0063	and eh a lot of the accent and everything
S0147	mm
S0063	and em in my family often offer they're very nice
S0147	mm
S0063	cos they're my family but ultimately it's not where i'm from
S0147	mm
S0063	i remember be a kid in staffordshire and i remember things like the breweries and eh you know the marmite factory and the roadworks factory and you know the railway line i use to play on when i be a kid
S0147	yeah
S0063	avoid the train obviously cos i'm still here
S0147	yeah yeah
S0063	you know but yeah hmm
S0147	it's funny cos my grandson i mean cos my son and his wife they live in and 's now what two and a half
S0063	yeah
S0147	and he's now get a real accent
S0063	olden yeah
S0147	yeah and he's so
S0063	be accent different from a accent
S0147	oh yeah yeah really yeah
S0063	very different
S0147	really yeah it's very very different yeah
S0063	be it more like a yorkshire accent or be that just me be a bite naïve
S0147	no i don't think it's like a yorkshire accent but it's just get it's own unique em
S0063	yeah
S0147	i don't know but there's something about it
S0063	yeah
S0147	i suppose cos i don't
S0063	it's in its own kind of place kind of thing
S0147	it's just its own place but its
S0063	be like that for sure
S0147	yeah
S0063	be a class accent
S0147	yeah
S0063	yeah yeah
S0147	but it's funny now
S0063	i love accent
S0147	just as he's so cos he's so young and you can just hear that
S0063	mm
S0147	he's now get his own individuality and you know and all of a sudden he come out with something that you think oh that be really you know em it's it's kind of like really funny to hear him now
S0063	mm
S0147	em you know chat away in that type of accent really yeah
S0063	yeah yeah
S0147	but em yeah
S0063	i think that's my cousins be shock when they they hear me cos they're unusual i be put up in staffordshire
S0147	mm
S0063	not in the south
S0147	yeah
S0063	so they might they probably think i'm a northerner and on some level
S0147	yeah
S0063	which be as you know be a bite of a funny thing to assume
S0147	yeah
S0063	but that's how they'll be
S0147	yeah
S0063	they'll be they you know oh you don't say grass like that
S0147	yeah
S0063	you're say grass you know that kind of thing
S0147	yeah
S0063	you know
S0147	yeah
S0063	em
S0147	the other thing will be of course be my other grandson will be a southerner well cos he be bear in
S0063	well
S0147	so he's gonna have em a accent isn't he
S0063	yeah i be tempt to say never mind there
S0147	i know i know
S0063	it's just this this but it's a birth thing and you can't do anything about it
S0147	i know
S0063	and some of them be quite nice
S0147	yeah
S0063	i remember when i be in essex some of them be quite nice
S0147	yeah but we'll they'll we'll have to see what how what sort of accent he
S0063	yeah
S0147	he have
S0063	i i reckon what will happen be that in the future what we'll develop very agitate and angry accent because they'll be grow up and they realise how much as house cost this be my theory
S0147	this be true
S0063	you know
S0147	yeah this be very true
S0063	you know
S0147	that's just what my daughter be go through at the moment i know she be at em last yesterday she be at em oh you know that photograph that i show on the em on the computer today
S0063	oh the one with with all the children on on on the sofa
S0147	all the baby all the baby yeah
S0063	eh like like peas in a pond
S0147	yeah and they be visit em her friends that who who she meet through the national childbirth trust
S0063	mm
S0147	and they've all have baby within a month of each other
S0063	oh yeah
S0147	and go to lunch at one of the mum's house and she say it be a gorgeous house it be really really nice really big and everything and just the type of house that they would like
S0063	yeah
S0147	cos they have a flat at the moment em but em she be say that really once they get back they google what the cost of em what roughly what the price would be for live in that area and she say they could afford it
S0063	oh no
S0147	but the trouble be be the area
S0063	mm
S0147	wasn't that nice and the school be not that good so you've get to kind of balance it up whether you want to have
S0063	that's awful that's what this country be like
S0147	whether you have a good whether you have the house that you really want but it's not in a good area or do you hang fire and wait for something you know a bite less sort of you know well not expensive but less
S0063	it's true that's why this country just want what you can choose for education
S0147	yeah
S0063	that's it really i mean you get this kind of polarisation of quality everywhere don't you
S0147	mm
S0063	i always though it i have kid in an area that be run down a bite em my phrase but i'd probably try and educate them in the even
S0147	yeah
S0063	be an imagine professor to my children and
S0147	what's he like
S0063	and i would i would teach them about my world view i'll teach him how to gamble online successfully
S0147	no you no you wouldn't
S0063	and how to steal things no not really eh just how to lie to the police you know or all all the things they don't tell you in school but you know all the things in school that they don't tell you like you know like the fact i never know i have a right right to arrest people then i realise that policemen be just exhibit what our right to arrest with a few extra power on top and they get to dress up in a funny uniform but that's you know this be the thing what just to if it's to tell you who i be pick the subject to talk about i know what i'm like and i'll go off and talk about stuff
S0147	we be digress now
S0063	and i think we're talk a we're digress a bite really so let's just change change
S0147	you can go off into a different yeah i think yeah
S0063	yeah you know
S0147	yeah i think we've probably exhaust the dialect and accent bite now haven't we
S0063	yeah well we we've cover the fact that you're a northerner and i'm i'm a southerner in term of accent and there we go
S0147	that's true that's true
S0063	which be quite nice mm
S0147	do you have you ever watch the film the full monty that be that be
S0063	yes
S0147	em actually film in
S0063	the one you mean the the one where they're they're naked on stage and they get their ding dong out and you go ooh

S0063	you need a bravery award for that film
S0147	at the begin
S0063	yeah
S0147	of the film at the start of the film i think i've tell you that it it take you through in the seventies because it talk about the steel you know all the steel

S0063	mm
S0147	so it's like it be like go back in time really
S0063	yeah
S0147	like em it's like
S0063	and the film be base off the old steel workers who get lay off cos of the industry
S0147	that get make redundant yeah
S0063	yeah
S0147	but yeah
S0063	yeah
S0147	there's quite a bite of sadness in that film as well cos the guy
S0063	yeah
S0147	i don't know if you remember see it the guy who's in the band
S0063	yeah
S0147	em and he try to kill himself he try to he go into his car and put the to put the exhaust in the car you know to kill himself
S0063	oh awful
S0147	with the exhaust fume
S0063	yeah yeah
S0147	em so there's quite a lot
S0063	yeah
S0147	there be a bite of sadness in that and
S0063	yeah yeah
S0147	em then he be rescue
S0063	i know yeah yeah my cousin do that to himself but i'll move the conversation quickly on
S0147	yeah we won't talk about that yeah
S0063	yeah yeah yeah
S0147	we won't talk about that
S0063	it's not like he's mind or anything cos he's go but you know yeah yeah there be a similar film about em the north which i though be quite interest there's one call brassed off
S0147	oh yeah brassed off that's the
S0063	and it's be about you know not the steel work the colliery pit close
S0147	yeah
S0063	but the whole village be base around the colliery
S0147	yeah
S0063	and once the coal mine go the village go it's just wipe out you know
S0147	yeah
S0063	and em
S0147	what's the guy that's die who be the star in that he be em a really good actor eh
S0063	pete postlethwaite
S0147	pete postlethwaite that's it
S0063	with the big big pink cheek bone up to here
S0147	yeah

S0147	pete postlethwaite yeah
S0063	he be good he be
S0147	a good actor yeah but he die didn't he be it last year he die
S0063	yeah yeah
S0147	yeah
S0063	a very craggy he he have a face make for be a character actor
S0147	yeah he do
S0063	because it be he be kind of big bone and slightly pot mark and odd
S0147	yeah
S0063	you know
S0147	yeah it be
S0063	but he have an interest face
S0147	yeah
S0063	a kind of live in face
S0147	yeah definitely
S0063	yeah he be one of my favourite actors definitely
S0147	yeah mm

S0147	yeah he be good in brassed off
S0063	mm
S0147	joan collin's daughter be in that as well i think
S0063	oh she be the blond eh agent of the enemy state kind of thing that be try to they put a mole in with this brass band eh players to see what kind of em anti government action they might be ferment et cetera et cetera and the other part be be they be actually gonna close the coal pit but they say that it be gonna stay open
S0147	oh
S0063	but they close it so that they be even more brassed off in fact if that film would have be in a southern film it would have be call piss off but it be cos it be in the north it be brassed off that's right what i find quite funny about the film i be think oh let's watch piss off no it's brassed off whatever kind of thing you know
S0147	oh dear
S0063	american's use that as well cos they use the word piss without the word off but if you're piss in england you're drink whereas in america you're just angry you can create all kinds of weird things can't it you know
S0147	mm
S0063	cos like in america rubber be a condom so i think that that's a comedy sketch right there isn't it you know
S0147	oh dear
S0063	this be what i'm like i tend to go off on tangents
S0147	okay fifteen minutes okay

S0063	you don't have an ankle you've get a blue
S0147	i've lose my ankle yeah i've lose my ankle
S0063	i'm exaggerate it's not that bad
S0147	yeah
S0063	but it just look swell generally
S0147	yeah it be
S0063	doesn't it
S0147	it be very painful
S0063	and how do you do it you you be jump up down the stairs or something
S0147	yeah i i decide to exercise up and down the stairs but in my foolishness i didn't put my trainers on
S0063	oh no
S0147	and decide to do it in bare feet
S0063	bare feet
S0147	yes
S0063	you never tell me this be have you be it not bare wood on the stairs
S0147	no it's carpet on them as well
S0063	a little bite of carpet okay yeah
S0147	but i i just
S0063	mm
S0147	i didn't realise after i have just decide in a fit of you know ooh i'll just do a hundred step up and down get my for my fitness thing but then i realise
S0063	yeah
S0147	and then i be fine afterwards but it wasn't until
S0063	that's the thing
S0147	two two days
S0063	you weren't injure at the time
S0147	it be yeah it's the impact i think it be the impact cos i do a hundred
S0063	yeah
S0147	just up down up you know just up and down two step a hundred time
S0063	mm
S0147	em and it and i i felt alright afterwards and i get a bite out of breath and everything i though ooh i've do do a good bite of exercise there but what i fail to think be
S0063	mm
S0147	i do not put my trainers on cos they be downstairs it be when my daughter say afterwards you know what do you have on your feet mum and i say eh actually i didn't have anything she say that's it that's what's do it you've it's the impact of the
S0063	doesn't look very good
S0147	yeah
S0063	i have a funny thing on my feet
S0147	yeah
S0063	which similarly start out as painless
S0147	mm
S0063	but stay painless and what i have i might still have i have a big blue circle where my ankle be
S0147	mm
S0063	and i think how do i do that well it's a blue circle so there's there's
S0147	mm
S0063	blood there and what happen to my ankle be at some point a tiny little vein rupture
S0147	mm
S0063	and it never repair itself
S0147	right
S0063	and the blood keep go
S0147	yeah
S0063	and then slowly come back but it be completely painless but it just look very very weird you know
S0147	mm
S0063	if it have be too much bigger i would have have a blue foot and i could have take it out at party and and scar people with my blue foot
S0147	yeah
S0063	but i didn't of course cos i'm sensible so
S0147	well i think every day when i get up it's gonna go down or something but i don't i think probably the warm weather's contribute a bite to make it more swell as well em somehow
S0063	oh yeah
S0147	but em
S0063	can you put witch hazel on it or something you know witch hazel you use to you know if i bump my head when i be a kid
S0147	i put no
S0063	out the witch hazel would come out and the bump would go down
S0147	i put ice on it i put ice on it
S0063	mm
S0147	but the only thing i have in my freezer be a pack of aunty bessie's roast potatoes i put those on it
S0063	that's nice that's another use
S0147	yeah i just keep it on for half an hour
S0063	it's another use of potatoes isn't it
S0147	yeah
S0063	you know
S0147	but that be it really so yeah
S0063	no that's good
S0147	yeah
S0063	you can articulate it a bite which be good
S0147	mm
S0063	i think you've get to look at the positives haven't you you know
S0147	so i don't know
S0063	it's not like you you it's not in a plaster cast be it
S0147	no not no
S0063	it's just
S0147	and that's why i keep think i've be walk around on something that's you know
S0063	mm
S0147	fracture or something like that and i should have have it
S0063	yeah yeah
S0147	wrap up that's what i'm think i maybe should have have it wrap up in you know my something to give it a bite more support really
S0063	yeah yeah that's the thing it's impossible to know whether it's it's benefit your ankle walk around or whether it's make it worse
S0147	yeah isn't it
S0063	hooray
