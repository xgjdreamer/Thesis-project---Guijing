S0262	yeah so which one do you think be go to be the best for the blog then
S0261	that would be this one
S0262	mm tumblr or the other one
S0261	well well tumblr have get a bigger audience so i think that's pretty straightforward but erm it wouldn't hurt to publish different article on both of them
S0262	okay
S0261	mm
S0262	there's also macmillan
S0261	yeah and you can test these things
S0262	mm macmillan's get erm the late the the erm it have get a bite it have get a bite out of date but they do have erm some guest blog
S0261	mm mm
S0262	on the subject of small talk that's from a little while ago but that's okay i mean we could do that for for later
S0261	yeah
S0262	when i'm when i'm a bite more kind of into it
S0261	to start with i wonder whether macmillan macmillan's the right type of site what erm because it be a publisher isn't it
S0262	yeah but
S0261	and so do people buy book straight from their site
S0262	the guest blog be just about small talk
S0261	mm mm i know that
S0262	yeah
S0261	so you want to put it in front of an audience
S0262	and well yeah i see what you be say so what kind of direct direct sales would you say would come from tumblr be it push it to amazon or how do it click through
S0261	well the intention would be push it through to amazon
S0262	mm
S0261	erm so people read the blog click through that go to a website
S0262	mm
S0261	which then advertise the book and site that talk about small talk
S0262	yeah so it's really it's a you know
S0261	and then people click through from that site
S0262	and you be also have to advertise on amazon too to get people to amazon to the book
S0261	yeah
S0262	which be part of the way it work
S0261	yeah you don't want to be write something and advertise amazon or a click through straight to amazon because people won't buy it
S0262	ah right so how do you do it instead
S0261	you do the click through to your website which provide extra valuable information
S0262	oh so you have to have a website
S0261	yeah mm mm
S0262	oh right oh
S0261	so
S0262	and do that mean that people can also order a erm a hard copy too from the website
S0261	at the moment because of the erm the arrangement with amazon you can't you can't sell directly from your website
S0262	mm
S0261	yeah so if we have a different arrangement you could
S0262	right
S0261	so but amazon's obviously get a big crowd so erm millions and millions larger than than the crowd that we have so that that make sense to just have it there at the moment
S0262	mm
S0261	and you may decide down the track that you take the book off there and you sell it directly from your own website or something
S0262	okay so as long as you're as long as you be follow the amazon rule you should be sweet
S0261	yes that's it that's the thing
S0262	mm mm so okay and do they how do it how do you learn about what they're actually propose be there it's kind of like a you know a quite a detail bunch of information
S0261	who be propose
S0262	amazon how they how they get you to you know publish your book online and how do how you find out about the latest developments do they email you or do they just expect you to sort of know it
S0261	no they have a massive resource centre behind them
S0262	do they
S0261	mm
S0262	so there's people you can even contact and say look i don't really understand how to do this bite and they would get back to you
S0261	yeah that's right
S0262	oh okay
S0261	mm they run it like erm like a business you know you're you're a customer of theirs
S0262	yeah mm mm
S0261	and they be sell you the idea that you can publish your stuff on this site
S0262	mm mm
S0261	and sell your products through them or whatever yeah
S0262	mm mm
S0261	so the other day i be listen to a podcast where this guy be say how erm he have ask a question about he have a family business he have be run it for they have be run it for many years they manufacture products and they sell them from a store erm and that amazon have directly contact them and ask them do they want to sell their products on amazon
S0262	oh right
S0261	so this guy be seek advice
S0262	yeah
S0261	about bear in mind amazon have a large a lot larger customer base
S0262	mm
S0261	should should they do this should they be erm they don't have to worry about the hassle they basically supply amazon with the product and amazon do all of the sell and ship
S0262	mm
S0261	right
S0262	mm mm
S0261	so the feedback to this guy be well erm hey look man you've get your own exist customer base if you then go and sell your products on amazon your own personal customer base be move to amazon so it become amazon's customers they be no longer your customers
S0262	mm
S0261	so then what control do you then have yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	so as good a deal as it might be it take a lot of the hassle out of the business and all that kind of thing the major part of it be that amazon end up with your customers
S0262	mm
S0261	so that that isn't a great idea you know
S0262	no
S0261	now there might be another situation where you as a as a company be sell your products via amazon yeah
S0262	mm mm yeah
S0261	and then amazon pitch to you well we'll do all of that fulfilment stuff just leave it up to us and so there be a discussion behind that that kind of point of view as well and you could apply that first kind of reason
S0262	mm
S0261	with your customers but in fact they're not your customers they be amazon's customers who happen to buy your products that you're provide through amazon's platform store
S0262	yeah
S0261	so that in itself could be see as a as a benefit unless you be the type of business person who would actively try to chase amazon's customers have buy your products because once they've buy them you have get some of the detail
S0262	mm
S0261	and that you would then be seek to provide them with some kind of customer follow up base on you know you have buy my product here be some other products that you might like and that kind of stuff yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	now if they're amazon's customers amazon have that data you will only have that if you have get to ship stuff to them if you don't ship stuff to them then how do you get hold of that data
S0262	mm i see what do you think of the curry
S0261	yeah it be good reliably spicy
S0262	mm so mm so you who be you expect tonight then
S0261	well tonight we be have a chat about that event
