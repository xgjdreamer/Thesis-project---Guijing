S0037	i don't know actually um you've gotta put quite a lot of oil in i think but
S0115	first or
S0037	no no i think you you whisk the egg yolks for a long time and then you sort of
S0115	yeah that's what i be do
S0037	and then you sort of drip the oil in
S0115	i've get six in there like uh
S0037	i can find i can
S0115	i've get six or d'you think there's not gonna be enough
S0037	no no that sound like a lot te do you want me to google it i'll just get my thing
S0115	uh yeah yeah
S0037	anyway yes so then so then he um so then he be say that he
S0115	yeah
S0037	he be tell me what he'd be do so he be say that once the baby's bear
S0115	yeah
S0037	the plan be that 'll go back to work actually but 's gonna try and fit his work around look after the baby
S0115	why i mean he he what about like and presumably te you know and them lot be gonna do that like
S0037	so 's gonna be the well yeah and everyone else so so 's gonna look after it on a thursday and someone else be gonna look after her on like her sister's gonna look after it on a some sort of day and
S0115	yeah
S0037	um any way so
S0115	right well that sound very reasonable doesn't it
S0037	but he's gonna be the one like he's gonna be the main carer i think
S0115	um yeah fair enough uh
S0037	but he like kid doesn't he i mean
S0115	so be gonna do he reckon 's get a better chance of get a better job then
S0037	get a job well she have
S0115	yeah
S0037	she's like an administrator and he's like a general purpose dogsbody
S0115	well he do a he do a variety of things doesn't he um
S0037	do he
S0115	well he have do yeah a barman
S0037	yeah but
S0115	that's his main qualification isn't it
S0037	but no like skilled work at least sarah's like a financial administrator
S0115	well he do have that qualification te you know he's he's only get the qualification as a barman yeah
S0037	yeah he's a barman he's work in a factory he's work in a
S0115	he have experience as a bingo call
S0037	his work he's a bingo caller he's a furniture salesman he's a
S0115	a club um work in a club as a barman
S0037	te do you know what i mean he's just like he's
S0115	furniture salesman yeah
S0037	but he's more what he be say be he's get like the type of like work in a pub for example that's always on an even so
S0115	yeah that that do allow you to sort of fit in uh i guess bring up a child around that
S0037	i suppose like my worry there be though that he would like if sarah go to work all day and he's look after the baby all day then he go to work all night like that's not gonna be very good for them two
S0115	oh yeah i think they they gonna have to work really hard and like um
S0037	no but i mean like their relationship
S0115	i don't
S0037	te you know
S0115	uh well i mean they're already um they already spend a lot of time apart don't they uh i think i mean i no i don't know to be honest but like
S0037	cos he be like oh we can't afford childcare time apart yeah
S0115	they're certainly don't don't they te you know both have like spend part of their time with their own families don't they
S0037	i think so well do all his various task and
S0115	just uh
S0037	he's also be like do odd job and he's be he's sell those you know those and those t shirt i be tell you
S0115	be he still do
S0037	he say that's do really well he say he earnt like a hundred and twenty pound last month do that so
S0115	oh right well it seem like he he's make quite a lot of money then
S0037	well he always be but just never sort of never enough
S0115	te do you think that he get it and you think he earn quite a lot but spend quite a lot
S0037	he do definitely do
S0115	i'm assume the child i mean how much time how much do it cost to raise a child like as cheap as
S0037	well i don't know i've get absolutely no i've get absolutely no like nothing to go on but anyway so then i be say ah have you have your scan se and he say oh i've get a picture for you um i'll send you it in the post i don't wanna put it facebook i think it's a bite obscene which it be he be like he be like here's a picture of my child in inside my girlfriend lol like he doesn't really think that's a
S0115	like why be it do people not do that
S0037	well yes people do do that but
S0115	no i don't think it's disgust to put a to put a scan
S0037	yeah but i don't dunno if i would wanna do it like here's a picture of my insides like
S0115	well that's rather a negative view i would've think
S0037	i dunno i didn't really like the idea either
S0115	really
S0037	i sort of understand
S0115	really i think it's very interest
S0037	you you don't even like facebook at the best of time you wouldn't wanna put a picture of like
S0115	um no i know i mean like you you could put that well put a scan i don't see why i don't see why you wouldn't wanna put wouldn't wanna put a scan
S0037	i can't seem to find like the the the instructions
S0115	for mayonnaise
S0037	anyway
S0115	have you not google how to make mayonnaise
S0037	yeah i've get i'm on the bbc food one that i normally like
S0115	uh rather obvious
S0037	um anyway
S0115	be that my one actually
S0037	that's mine i've just open that te do you want yours be here
S0037	anyway so so then he be say um then i say have you think about any then they say he they decide not to find out if it's a girl or a boy
S0115	decide not to
S0037	yeah and he say and i say oh i mean understand like it's a good surprise i say oh be there any reason and he say well apparently te mam have loadsa miscarriages and so do her nana and her aunties and they're just worry like suppose they're just be a bite cautious he say like if he if they sort of start think about it like as a boy or a girl and then anything happen
S0115	make it worse
S0037	so okay here's delia's recipe two egg yolks put the egg yolks in a basin add the salt and pepper
S0115	okay i'll just get some salt
S0037	then hold your electric whisk in one hand
S0115	right
S0037	uh add a drop of oil to the mixture and whisk in
S0115	right it's just sort of whisk in
S0037	then it say however stupid this may sound the key to successful mayonnaise be make sure each drop of oil be thoroughly whisk in before add the next drop it won't take all day because after a few minutes the mixture will go thick and very stiff and lumpy when you get to this stage add a teaspoon of vinegar
S0115	so could use uh
S0037	so you pour it you you pour it a drop at a time
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	and then
S0115	could use um uh our um blender thing
S0037	yeah it that would probably be better
S0115	but uh wasn't sure like if that would like rip it up and
S0037	no i it'll be fine that'll be quicker
S0115	and um so any other news from tom
S0037	oh and then i say erm have you think of any be you stay with the same name and they say he say oh if it's a boy i'm still go to call him
S0115	fair enough
S0037	if it's a girl they're have a new idea and they're think of
S0115	oh right
S0037	but call her which i quite like definitely better than which isn't even a real name anyway
S0115	yeah i mean well i would have say you like there be a slight risk with with uh with rarer name
S0037	sound quite nice
S0115	i think the rarer name can be a bite like be a bite of a stigma sometimes
S0037	but 's quite nice
S0115	yeah i think that's that's that's alright yeah
S0037	i be like yeah do that one do that one never mind
S0115	that's pretty um
S0037	so
S0115	that's that sound good yeah i like it
S0037	that's where that be and then he be say
S0115	get kind of thicker now
S0037	have you put any oil in
S0115	yeah i have
S0037	but just do a drop like literally a drop at a time delia say
S0115	yeah i know that's the second drop yeah second drop's go in yeah
S0037	um
S0115	you've get to uh yeah like i guess you've get to uh yeah like i guess you've get to like whisk whip it for age so that it um
S0037	do you want me to do some be your hand get tire
S0115	uh yeah yeah whisk it to make sure all the oil be um distribute uh so that'll be fine
S0037	and then
S0115	so yeah 's a better name isn't it uh than
S0037	that's much better
S0115	i think it would it might be a bite of a stigma if you give
S0037	i know
S0115	if you have a name like and then uh anything else
S0037	um what be he say he be say they're think about like maybe move to a different place cos obviously they're in like a one bedroom flat at the moment
S0115	yeah yeah it's hard to raise a child if you've only get one bedroom
S0037	but he say he'll obviously have to just save up because they need to get
S0115	well he seem to be make quite a bite of money doesn't he
S0037	well they need to get the new deposit before they get the old deposit back you know same as us here
S0115	you need to
S0037	like we've get a like we've get like fifteen hundred pound of deposit hold with our let agent
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	but if we want to move we'd have to find a new fifteen hundred pound before we get the old one back
S0115	i see right yeah some house deposit be very high aren't they
S0037	oh if you want to buy yeah
S0115	yeah
S0037	no i don't think he's in quite that state yet anyway and then um what else what he say oh i say i be tell him about and he be like oh we should go there on like me you and matt we should go and i be think um baby
S0115	i think um
S0037	then i be say we be think of go to sunderland like in september the start of september
S0115	yeah around that sort of time yeah
S0037	he say once
S0115	i yeah yeah um
S0037	once the baby have have chance to stop like be weird
S0115	if i can hopefully i'll be able to get
S0037	do you want to put some
S0115	um integrate that um another drop
S0037	do you think
S0115	i mean cos if you look at it obviously it's you can't really easily see much much oil can you
S0037	no
S0115	um i guess it's kind of partly up to the discretion of the uh te you know how much oil you put be be up to te you know personal taste innit i think they make a lot of like you know those light mayonnaise and like light light mayonnaise where it's like really
S0037	yeah extra super super but we saw that programme didn't we they put in like
S0115	just wonder how be they make the mayonnaise runny
S0037	yeah
S0115	put them up
S0037	where we put in like gum arabic be it
S0115	ah you mean be that like uh how it how it's make
S0037	they put in no it be like um like jimmy's food factory or whatever it be te do you remember and he make like industrial scale
S0115	oh right oh yeah
S0037	yeah um yeah and then i speak to me mam briefly
S0115	yeah
S0037	she be ask about and then i be say like cos i say i go in c and a cos i use to really like c and a and me mam i know me mam use to love it like the shop c and a
S0115	oh right
S0037	and she be like then she be say ooh i get this i remember once me dad buy us this swing jacket from c and a and i be like ooh swing jacket be back in now and she say oh
S0115	shall i do it what be they
S0037	like those coat that sort of go like that they're kind of looser and sort well they sort of swing out like sort of
S0115	oh right oh yeah
S0037	not like a tight sort of fit coat like more like a
S0115	yeah
S0037	anyway um
S0115	yeah
S0037	and then she say she's gonna ring tomorrow for a proper chat i be like yay
S0115	yeah so i'm gonna invite my parent write an email and
S0037	do you wanna email i can help you
S0115	that's right
S0037	if you wanna
S0115	actually should have put a bite of garlic in there it's uh too late too late for that now
S0037	mm do you want some of this chilli some
S0115	just uh slip a little bite there like
S0037	huh whoop
S0115	no it's no it's alright um yeah and when they come they'll probably bring some plant and it'll be
S0037	yeah
S0115	um what be we on about before with uh we be on about um oh yeah the taxation actually we be on about which be uh
S0037	ooh quite bore
S0115	uh like and you be
S0037	do you want some of this
S0115	you be uh no i think it's a bite uh
S0037	bite what
S0115	it's a bite strong
S0037	oh i like it
S0115	not really in the mood for uh
S0037	mm it's nice um
S0115	so i don't really know when to stop with this i'm just gonna keep on uh
S0037	until it look like mayonnaise it's still a bite runny isn't it
S0115	yeah the main thing be that it isn't white it's yellow so yeah
S0037	no but the that's alright
S0115	that's like the probably the main uh observation that i would make
S0037	but real mayonnaise be yellow like
S0115	yeah i could put a bite of mustard in maybe
S0037	hmm
S0115	bite of mustard like might go nicely
S0037	oh yeah that'd be nice have we get any of that ones with the specs in
S0115	um
S0037	whole grain
S0115	think so
S0037	and i say like something like um be gonna be alright with the pregnancy i know she's can be a bite like sort of te you know
S0115	she she can be a a tad um uh well she seem to have quite a few health well she seem to get quite a few health problems like

S0115	oh yeah
S0037	she's obviously totally excite
S0115	alright i've need a break
S0037	i've see i saw in the um in the shop that i cycle past like that they do these um when i these
S0115	guess i could whip whip that up and have a raita or whatever
S0037	ooh yeah saw these things that say like when i
S0115	mousse chocolate mousse
S0037	yeah maybe
S0115	which if i'd be a bite if i'd think ahead i could've get some plain chocolate and te you know
S0037	no it's alright can probably keep it anyway in the fridge
S0115	like get some of this this be hazelnut chocolate i can you know melt that down and mix it to make a mousse
S0037	the um i saw these in the shop these things that say like when i grow up i'm gonna go to university
S0115	in a shop
S0037	with like the logo on
S0115	you sorry you do where where be that
S0037	in the shop on
S0115	where's that
S0037	like just near
S0115	oh right yeah yeah
S0037	i might get one
S0115	oh little baby things yeah yeah so yeah uh
S0037	as like an ironic gesture when i grow up i'm gonna go to university
S0115	no well you don't know you don't know baby could uh
S0037	have its brain from well not
S0115	mm no it it be he's he's not he's not uh he's not that bad be he
S0037	no he not but he wouldn't have go to university
S0115	i dunno partly it's partly cultural isn't it te you know um i think the sort of
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh what
S0037	yeah but i mean he wouldn't have
S0115	sorry i didn't what do you
S0037	no nothing
S0115	be you gonna close that
S0037	no no no it's fine shall i put some more oil in this
S0115	um i dunno i mean like
S0037	do taste quite nice
S0115	i don't know like we probably don't wanna put load of oil in
S0037	it it it be suppose to have quite a lot of oil in though i think
S0115	well it's as i say it it sort of um
S0037	it's very white peppery maybe don't put any more white pepper in for me
S0115	oh no i mean uh i uh
S0037	mm
S0115	i didn't i didn't intend to put that in like
S0037	it do taste like really white peppery
S0115	fair enough have have i screw it up
S0037	no you haven't screw it up
S0115	oh well never mind
S0037	no you haven't you haven't
S0115	uh it's alright well you don't have it on its own do you so i mean if you wanna put like uh put some mustard in if you wanna balance that out a bite balance those flavour
S0037	no have a taste what do you think
S0115	it's alright
S0037	what motivate you to put six six egg in like be it just
S0115	you could you could perhaps do you could perhaps do um
S0037	why six egg like
S0115	well cos i be think of make like quite a lot you know like to last for like more than one meal you know
S0037	i see yeah yeah no it's a good idea
S0115	well cos two cos like two two egg if you scramble two egg it's it doesn't come out with very much do it
S0037	no
S0115	two scramble egg isn't isn't load like i don't think um so yeah well we have a lot of egg as well uh so i think well we haven't get many so i think i'd uh use it up
S0037	we we need a beater though this be a bite
S0115	we um if you wanna just use the use the electric one we could do that
S0037	shall i give it a try
S0115	yeah if if you if you
S0037	need it out for me soup anyway might spurt everywhere though i'm i'm a bite clumsy
S0115	um i'll have it i'll do it
S0037	i can i can do it i don't mind
S0115	um hold on uh just get that
S0037	i always worry like about use this like cos usually it's oh what's in ah it's just the thing
S0115	i'll i'll do that it's uh if you if you think you know
S0037	no and let's just try it
S0115	uh oh it work then
S0037	be that do it
S0115	i think yeah slowly yeah
S0037	that look more mayonnaisey already doesn't it
S0115	it be a bite faster than i think
S0037	slightly slightly faster than the uh
S0115	it's do the uh well it's do in like one second what like take us like fifteen minutes to do it's go a lot whiter innit
S0037	huh
S0115	it's go a lot it's go a lot whiter isn't it
S0037	be it alright what do you think
S0115	uh look okay
S0037	ugh
S0037	it splatted on us
S0115	shall i have a go whoop yeah just don't like do any sort of sudden sudden movements with it
S0037	be it okay
S0115	yeah
S0037	ooh sorry
S0115	little bite of a shall i have a go
S0037	ooh taste more like mayonnaise
S0115	it's get it's get better but it's we've just gotta get it um you know like salad
S0037	need some vinegar in it's like too sort of thick
S0115	oh yeah lemon yeah with uh grab uh
S0037	it's too sort of thick and peppery
S0115	sorry about that pepper uh
S0037	you put too much white pepper in i think
S0115	i think you've you've say that a couple of time already
S0037	sorry i just don't really like white pepper that much i like a tiny bite
S0115	really i'd assume you
S0037	just a small bite like i find it just
S0115	you you never buy any black pepper
S0037	no no i keep forget
S0115	with uh your hatred of white pepper
S0037	no it's not a hatred it's more like um
S0115	i dunno actually for a mayonnaise like i would've think white pepper would go better
S0037	no maybe it you might even be right yeah maybe it do i just think
S0115	no i think there's a lack of aroma in there there's a there's a lack of aroma like um
S0037	yeah
S0115	like mustard or garlic or something like you know
S0037	maybe mustard would be better actually
S0115	we we don't have um we don't enough aroma in there that's that's why you know the only the white pepper's come out so
S0037	yeah
S0115	um uh
S0037	yeah maybe the i think the mayonnaise'll be nice
S0115	mm
S0037	be you gonna make a sandwich be that why you start make the mayonnaise while i be on the phone
S0115	it's tuna it's to go with a tuna sandwich yeah
S0037	oh that'd be really that'd be really nice i dunno what's wrong with my throat maybe i be snore ooh like it how you try to catch that drip
S0037	just press it like just let it go woo
S0115	anything else from uh then
S0037	no i only talk to her for a minute she be um

S0037	you mean like like hulk hogan time yeah
S0115	um so but that's sort of
S0037	me brother use to really like it he have like he have like
S0115	just let it go
S0037	i suppose we can't really talk over that
S0115	yeah he um he's always uh he's always like that hasn't he so i think he he's he'll probably get he'll probably do weight train eventually
S0037	do you think so no he's never be that health conscious to be honest like
S0115	think he could uh like he'd like to have you know some big muscle wouldn't he
S0037	i think he'd like to but also he also just like pies and
S0115	i think he just it's just inevitable to uh
S0037	na
S0115	like um gonna get like load of spit from this
S0037	na i think like it wasn't really spit that much i think if you lift it up too much it spit do you want me to have a go
S0115	um no i'll just hold it down and do it
S0115	whoa and then it do some i think you're just you're just inevitably gonna get like spit come out
S0037	just do it in little bits just redecorate you know a nice mayonnaise colour speckle this be gonna be so annoy to transcribe
S0115	oh no no no it's probably not that much
S0037	with a like blender
S0115	well you don't have to transcribe the blender though do you so
S0037	you could write blender in like square bracket
S0115	no you don't you wouldn't have to write blender every time
S0037	no i know
S0115	do you wanna move it further away then you wanna put it over there or something
S0037	yeah but then but then uh
S0115	right well well put it you're hold it for some reason during uh
S0037	i think it be gonna get uh mayonnaise splatter on its face
S0115	oh no they're quite espensive little things aren't they
S0037	these yeah very and i just chuck it in my handbag like
S0037	hey like those plant holders be like glow in the dark
S0115	those what
S0037	those knit plant holders that i've make
S0115	yeah they're pretty bright aren't they
S0037	well they'll attract the um bumble be
S0115	yeah well i mean i guess they will but i don't know for certain but because they're bright you're just guess that they'll be more attractive to
S0037	well you know like have you ever do it where you've wear like a bright shirt
S0115	you've get like what
S0037	where you've wear like a bright shirt and then you've be like bother by wasps
S0115	oh like wasps and that
S0037	na
S0115	uh sometimes yeah but
S0037	i suppose maybe you don't wear bright shirt
S0115	no but like sometimes you you you think that yeah that there's something like if you have like hair gel on it's attract like
S0037	yeah
S0115	it's get like sugar in and it's attract like wasps and that
S0037	yeah and like an an ice cream or something
S0115	yeah oh yeah and um no one like wasps we we're alright over here in this house where we don't really have any i've never see any wasps around here do you do you wanna do that
S0037	do you think we need some more oil in
S0115	i guess so
S0037	shall i have a try
S0115	i mean i'm just get a bite get really bore of of uh
S0037	do it
S0115	whip it
S0037	here you be then
S0115	i'll put this over here
S0037	ugh
S0037	feel like i'm just cover in speckle where's that oh
S0115	um how many plant do you reckon you think we'll be grow like how many how many tomatoes do you think we're gonna uh be we gonna grow
S0037	woah think i might just have spray me um i don't know what do you think
S0115	could go back to hand whip it doesn't seem to be doesn't seem to be do it
S0037	it do do a lot better though for a while
S0115	it look like it be much better but then it sort of i don't know if that's actually cos that's actually chop it you know what i mean i think we might've um think think we might've can i help i think we might've make a mistake because like that's the wrong type of instrument i think like
S0037	yeah but we haven't get anything else
S0115	we we we weren't we want to whisk it not chop it you know what i mean that's a chopper
S0037	yeah but we haven't get anything else like
S0115	you know what i mean i be think that the that the knife action from it might actually break apart the the yolk you know what i mean
S0037	maybe it be too much lemon
S0115	in a way that in a way that didn't want you know what i mean
S0037	no because once it's mix in you're suppose to do it with a hand blender i mean
S0115	yeah no no you're suppose to do it with an electric whisk it's not the same
S0037	i mean that's what i mean sorry
S0115	not not quite the same as um a chopper cos uh because because it's like a different shape um you know the bite be a different shape isn't it so i guess it will taste a bite nicer than than it do but uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	but it's just worth like we have a lot of egg so i just think we might as well try it i mean
S0037	well maybe we should just leave it there like
S0115	you think it's uh i'll probably could give it a few more hand whip and then uh
S0037	i'm just get sick of like whisk it i suppose
S0115	well you don't have to i'll just i'll do it then it doesn't matter it be just like an experiment you know
S0037	yeah
S0115	yeah it's get a decent
S0037	it'd be nice though anyway like as a little sauce
S0115	yeah yeah like one of them german yellow sauce innit
S0037	yeah
S0115	um do you wanna put that back where it be
S0037	um sorry
S0115	actually we'll we'll go through shall we cos uh you've get anything
S0037	um do you wanna make a sandwich now then or
S0115	have you get anything more to do i don't mind um
S0037	i'm a bite hungry
S0115	okay well shall we do that then
S0037	suppose so yeah
S0115	something like
S0037	what shall we have um how about like a
S0115	just tuna mayo innit
S0037	well what about like a tuna cheese melt like we could toast some bread and some
S0115	oh right yeah okay i i quite like that idea
S0037	yeah so if we toast some bread and then make some tuna and then put some cheese and that on the top and melt it a bite and then i think i've get a bite of salad and that we could put in
S0115	yeah
S0037	that might be quite nice okay i'll put the oven on excuse me
S0115	i'll leave that there for later cos um
S0037	i know yeah so we should try and remember to blend the soup tonight and that and like not in the morning cos i'm always aware that i'm like and it's the
S0115	oh well well yeah yeah we'll do it tonight yeah no problem
S0037	oh be this the last of the bread

S0115	yeah through be it still go
S0037	yeah
S0115	grab this and then
S0037	oh yeah
S0115	uh right um do you want be you gonna say like uh how many tomatoes we're get and how many like
S0037	we might you might need to move some stuff off the table oh yeah
S0115	no i'll just i'll just um
S0037	oh right i'll close this the fridge light's come back on do i tell you
S0115	it's on and off innit
S0037	i wonder what's do that like it's so annoy oh i forget we'd buy i didn't know we have this branston pickle
S0115	oh yeah
S0037	i know i keep forget
S0115	so like have we decide how many how many
S0037	oh that really need eat wonder if we should've put that in the soup
S0115	no we'll cook it tomorrow or something
S0037	okay
S0115	have we decide how many um how many plant be grow now
S0037	um well no so so i write down like the
S0115	yeah so i think want to talk about
S0037	i write down like the box that we have um at the moment
S0115	yeah
S0037	and we've get like um five of those sort of trough ones
S0115	yeah
S0037	we've get two of those kind of big tomato tubs round ones um that have get like the dead ones from last year in there i need to throw away
S0115	yeah
S0037	and then we've get um we've get like what else have we get hang on a minute oh yeah we've get like a big green like a big green planter
S0115	yeah
S0037	and also like a big um one that i buy last year but i didn't use in the end like um like a bite sort of what's it call i think it be for strawberries or something it's like a big um thing that's get like hole in the side
S0115	uh right
S0037	so it's like it's collapsible do you remember when i buy it i buy it from aldi
S0115	oh yeah yeah
S0037	it's collapsible so but it's get like hole in the side where things poke out of
S0115	right yeah yeah i think i remember that yeah
S0037	so you could put in like herbs or like um strawbs or something but so i think tomorrow i might i might buy that or later tonight even i might buy that um greenhouse thing that i saw you know those little like collapsible temporary ones
S0115	um yeah
S0037	because i be look at i be read some um article on um like this garden thing and they be say about like the like aubergines be kinda hard to grow here but not impossible and i think certainly give our
S0115	oh right because it's just too damn cold then be it
S0037	well it's a bite cold but they say they grow well in like a shelter spot or in like a little greenhouse thing so if we get a little greenhouse and put its little lid down then i imagine it would grow but there's certain type that be really good like ones that grow smaller and
S0115	oh right shall i just grab a chair
S0037	um yeah ones that grow ones that grow oh we can go through actually while we're wait
S0115	yeah right yeah whatever's easier
S0037	oh no actually i'll
S0115	cos you've get that bread on there
S0037	i know yeah i i'll just do the rest of this um you can get like ones that be like um smaller the plant grow smaller and they grow like like more more sort of fruit on the
S0115	i see
S0037	plant than the other ones and if you if you google it if you have a look here you go if you have a look for like aubergine seed i didn't realize how many there be you can get white ones you can get white and purple zebra like stripy ones you can get really long thin ones
S0115	yeah i think that that's the case with a lot of plant isn't it like uh they have you can generally get load and load of varieties of plant can't you
S0037	yeah like in the supermarket you only see you only see you only see those wel like those ones in there those kind of like sort of fattish like oval black ones but purple black ones but you can get all like crazy kinds so
S0115	black black ones yeah
S0037	but this article that i read say that this one call fairy tail this variety call fairy tail be good it they grow in kind of into like a sort of shrubby sort of uh bush
S0115	yeah
S0037	and um like produce a lot of uh fruit you know give the crop give the size of the plant so that might be worth have a look at
S0115	right
S0037	but the things that i like the most last year like in fact the year before we do have things the year before didn't we cos we have cucumbers didn't we just get a tomato
S0115	um yeah
S0037	like tomatoes be really good and chillies you could never have too many tomatoes and chillies or cucumbers even so i'd definitely like to grow those again
S0115	yeah
S0037	but earlier today i put in peas carrots which i've never do before i do we do peas last year
S0115	um yeah carrots be new yeah
S0037	carrots and spring onions which could be really nice
S0115	oh right that that'll be uh that'll be good
S0037	so they're in now and like we have to sow them every two weeks dunno how quite how we're gonna
S0115	no they be in they be the solenoids
S0037	i know same as potatoes yeah i be surprise
S0115	that be a sort of a guess that i guess at first but then i like wasn't sure
S0037	yeah
S0115	but in fact um they be the um like they that that's their name solanum uh melangina
S0037	oh they're like the the name the
S0115	they're they're the type
S0037	the county palatine
S0037	you know what i mean
S0115	the type of uh species or the uh yeah the i've i've i dunno what the word be but you know they're the type the um
S0037	i don't i don't know either no vocabulary anyway so so i'd really like to try some aubergines just cos i like the taste of them so much and then uh courgettes be good last be it courgettes we have
S0115	um
S0037	things that grow quite fast courgettes grow quite fast um
S0115	ah a lot of these be poisonous actually
S0037	i know poison ivy and stuff in that group yeah i read
S0115	so like yeah so what be you say uh find um different varieties or
S0037	so oh yeah so if you type go on amazon and then type in like uh aubergine seed
S0115	those like little round ones from uh
S0037	you can get like baby ones um
S0115	oh you want me to search for how many seed be available
S0037	well just like that's a i be just want to show you what i saw before like where so i type in aubergine seed and then there be like so many different and i don't just mean like different people sell them i mean like different type you know like they all look kinda different which i think be good
S0115	oh right so you can eat some of them can't you
S0037	sorry
S0115	you can eat aubergine seed can't you
S0037	oh i don't know
S0115	yeah
S0037	you mean like pumpkin seed
S0115	uh yeah
S0037	i suppose you can i never really think about it
S0115	no it be just google suggest uh i put in aubergine seed and it produce that
S0037	oh you mean like yeah
S0115	like it suggest it yeah it suggest edible
S0037	huh but um anyway so this have firm up a bite actually
S0115	yeah
S0037	anyway so yeah there there's so many different varieties
S0115	so
S0037	just think like we should get some different ones so i quite fancy do that i mean how about you what do you what do you fancy grow
S0115	ah i be interest in um like uh um like yeah like citrus and like stuff you make in a greenhouse that you make in a greenhouse
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh but i think pretty much the same as you i mean we've get a lot of things go so
S0037	no well i haven't get
S0115	i mean pretty much the same as you but perhaps to try and get quite a lot large quantity and then plan ahead so we try and save some money you know use it to to um to have like a bite of a strategy and like plan to save money
S0037	yeah the things that we would normally buy well i think we've get i think the one thing this year i'm more aware of like the space that we've get last year i've just be like put like um sort of things round the edge of the little bite of patio i think i'm more ruthless this year i think i'll be like well i've already start like hang stuff up and
S0115	yeah yeah i mean we do have you know gotta make use of the space you've get and we have get we have get space you know
S0037	yeah
S0115	well a fair amount of space so uh so what you want me to search for like um the availability of them
S0037	uh no i don't i suppose i just want you to see like the
S0115	so i've get uh real seed dot co dot uk
S0037	no just go to like amazon or something or well go wherever you want obviously
S0115	well this be like just google result um they grow a bite slower than tomatoes and pepper their relatives uh
S0037	but that's funny because for us the tomatoes grow really fast and the and the pepper grow really slow last year so
S0115	um
S0037	maybe it's a temperature thing
S0115	start them off with some heat and then either transplant out um or grow in a greenhouse
S0037	um where's the cheese be it still in my bag
S0115	probably
S0037	yes it be
S0115	well they get one call uh de barbentane
S0037	yeah
S0115	a medium size cylindrical black aubergine from france they've get ronde de valence which be a a new one they're try out this year
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh round black fruit like a tennis ball size
S0037	hm so yeah i think
S0115	you can save them yourself from the plant while they're inside it inside the uh inside the fruit
S0037	yeah yeah but sometimes the ones that you grow from like you know they've be treat or they're not like the best variety
S0115	uh well yeah but it's still worth try isn't it and these ones seem to say like you you could save it yourself but um
S0037	oh of course
S0115	if you cut the seed out of the middle of it
S0037	yeah
S0115	with a bowl of water or something yeah
S0037	okay
S0115	a very ripe fruit
S0037	well that one be very ripe we could maybe try that one
S0115	rinse it through a sieve to get the seed
S0037	mm this cheese be a bite disappoint
S0115	uh this be actually sell seed and it will sell you twenty five for two pound
S0037	yeah i saw them on uh
S0115	from um these these ones uh buy seed
S0037	i saw them on amazon and stuff so i might try well i might try that variety that be mention because like if it's a recommend you know uh it's in the bbc garden magazine thing
S0115	yeah
S0115	be there any news
S0115	amazon search
S0115	i'm just in amazon if i go to
S0037	yeah there's some good ones
S0037	okay
S0115	amazon
S0037	um sorry
S0115	enter
S0037	i've get some of that leave do you want some
S0115	just search amazon um what for
S0037	couldn't balance it on it's just the tuna i couldn't balance it all on the bread
S0115	oh right do you save any mayonnaise or do you put it all in
S0037	no no no of course there's load
S0115	oh right yeah yeah i be i be kind of think that like i would make like a whole jar you know what i mean
S0037	yeah yeah yeah
S0115	but i reckon you'd probably need about twenty egg for that um which we haven't get
S0037	no i don't know there's like that's quite a lot there
S0115	um viserba something call viserba aubergine
S0037	let me look
S0115	it's on amazon
S0037	uh if you open the amazon like um it's get like an amazon app
S0115	oh yeah oh yeah i mean okay i'll have a look on this
S0037	it's um it's not on the net it's on
S0115	it's not on the main desktop
S0037	no it's in um it's just here on the leave
S0115	will you uh see if be he uh be our recorder go okay
S0037	ay uh yeah it's fine
S0115	so would you like to be a farmer then
S0037	um i don't know
S0115	of of um like oranges and
S0037	i sort of like the outdoor thing but i think i might get sick of it like it's nice like in the summer like it's nice for us to be like ooh look it's a lovely day i'll potter round in the garden ah no it's rain never mind i'll do it next week let's go to the pub like
S0037	if you're a farmer it's
S0115	ah yeah i mean it's like it sound nice on paper doesn't it
S0037	you don't get that choice
S0115	maybe it sound nice but in reality it's not quite as idyllic as it sometimes
S0037	na i think i think i'd like a beer garden
S0115	and look like at grapes you know like grapes or or hop or something
S0037	yeah
S0115	i i i think that i would really like to be brewer
S0037	yeah
S0115	um of some sort
S0037	but be a brewer and be a hop grower isn't the same be it i mean
S0115	i guess not although
S0037	i mean obviously they go hand in hand
S0115	no they they they yeah i mean
S0037	wine fine fine grow
S0115	yeah but if i be yeah it sound nice sound nice like to get out and go south of france or something get a house and like grow load of like grapes and stuff but uh
S0037	but it's the same as anything like i think i'm realistic like any job any job it no matter how fantastic it sound there's always like crap bits isn't there like and i think
S0115	well i mean you get some some job be just some job be definitely better than others well you know i suppose
S0037	like if if my job be like knit things all day i would i'm sure i would get totally piss off with it like but because it's not and it's just something i like do then i like do it like i be just say there like the garden i'd like a bigger garden with like i'd like a greenhouse i'd like more space
S0115	yeah
S0037	i'd like some chickens really but i wouldn't want a farm where i have to get up at five in the morning and like every day and without fail you know
S0115	yeah i mean well there's a big big difference but you can employ i suppose you can you can sort of employ people can't you
S0037	well same with anything though you can of course you can you can employ someone to do your garden
S0115	um so i guess i mean like that you would employ
S0037	but i don't really see the point in like people who have you know like garden that've get like flower and that in i like flower and i think they're very beautiful but i sort of don't really like i think it's a waste when i see these garden that've just get like like bush and that in
S0115	so you wouldn't like to live in in spain and have a big massive load of orange tree and uh
S0037	yeah it might be really nice but
S0115	but it might be a bite of a pain
S0037	if you're the person who's in charge and responsible for those orange tree
S0115	yeah
S0037	then that might take the shine off
S0115	the problem with farm be that they suffer from you know like um
S0037	crop and pestilence yeah
S0115	it it there's a there's an element of gamble isn't there because you could get a very bad bad you know lack of sun and you could lose load of money if you don't the sun right
S0037	i think it would be nice to like for example go to stay in an orange grove and for a while think it would
S0115	well like i kind of like i i like the idea of be more more self sufficient you know
S0037	oh it's nearly do i'd like it if my parent have one and then i could just go over when i please loll around do whatever i fancy
S0115	yeah
S0037	not really one that i be responsible for and be down to me sort of thing ah i've eat all the nut
S0115	yeah um that be that be something that i'm guilty of
S0037	it's alright though they be yours
S0115	amazon's get two hundred seed for ninety nine p oh but a pound for ship so we're back on two pound again plus uh but these ones have more seed
S0037	do you want the crust or do you want me to have the crust
S0115	probably i dunno about amazon probably be better off go to a specialize specialize seed maker
S0037	sutton seed or something no but i just mean like
S0115	i mean that last website look good but i but i'd also like to
S0037	actually no you have this one
S0115	i'm not actually hungry so i can put if you put mine on the side somewhere so be we gonna move through
S0037	uh yeah
S0115	to
S0037	oh be you not hungry
S0115	not right now but i i might be like
S0037	i'm sorry i shouldn't have make it if you weren't hungry
S0115	no cos you be hungry so
S0037	well that doesn't mean anything
S0115	it doesn't
S0037	kinda always hungry a bite
S0115	uh i'll have it later yeah
S0037	what have you be nibble things in there
S0115	but the you've get the suggestions for uh amazon like
S0037	oh have i
S0115	customers who like this also like would like tomatoes
S0037	also like ah
S0115	tomatoes money maker it say
S0037	what's that
S0115	fifty seed
S0037	i suppose it do make you money cos you you know like you spend a pound on like
S0115	i think tomatoes and but we also use a lot of lemons like there's a sort of advantage of that
S0037	ah but those tomatoes last year the smell of them like and they be so tasty weren't they they be just like so nice in your mouth
S0115	yeah yeah them them cherry ones like really sort of tangy and sweet yeah
S0037	your parent bring those like maybe they'll bring some more maybe your mam'll bring some more

S0115	oh no it's no problem well you you gotta stay in touch with your family haven't you
S0037	you do
S0115	um ah so have get uh a a new job you be say uh
S0037	mm he's like one of those like you know when you're in the street
S0115	i overhear i overhear some stuff
S0037	when you see someone with a clipboard
S0115	i overhear the word clipboard
S0037	like me dad say he's a professional beggar yeah it's true
S0115	so he's he stand with a clipboard and um
S0037	try to no i think he's go from door to door or something it's not the first time he's do that sort of rubbish
S0115	who do he work for
S0037	he use to sell talktalk um broadband door to door
S0115	that be the sort of thing that that the job kind of job that be go around like when i be at finish school um like my friend sort of like try to do that sort of job
S0037	but now he's go door to door he's go door to door um ask for donations for a local hospice or something
S0115	uh okay fair enough i mean
S0037	well not fair enough
S0115	i i don't personally
S0037	they're just annoy
S0115	yeah i i don't like i don't like it when someone i don't like anything door to door to be honest
S0037	me neither it's just an invasion of your like home isn't it
S0115	it's i mean if it be here like i think we're benefit from the fact that we're in a flat and therefore like you you feel slightly safer like cos you you're not the only one so like but i generally don't answer the door or the phone unless i know who it be um
S0037	no i don't i've get no reason to if like
S0115	no it's
S0037	i think if someone be like
S0115	cos we don't we don't we don't get much knock round here i think
S0037	i think if someone be really urgently like ring the doorbell and bang on the door i would go and look and see what it be but if someone just ring the doorbell i just think i'm not expect a parcel i'm not expect anyone i'm not gonna answer it's obviously just gonna be people bother you
S0115	yeah i know it be it be um there be something that's sort of
S0037	i hate all that stuff i really do
S0115	i mean the thing with a charity be that you you have to beg otherwise you you won't get anything will you unless you can somehow secure government fund from somewhere or unless you you
S0037	yeah i know but the reason he's take be because it's like sixteen hours a week but you can do them whenever you want
S0115	yeah so he must be well as as usual he he's presumably work like sixty hours a week or or more than that like
S0037	oh obviously yeah
S0115	he he's always work many hours doesn't he um that's just that's just what he like isn't it
S0037	well he's work twenty four hours at the pub and sixteen hours at this thing and then
S0115	i suppose import and that seem like a really quite um quite a a quite a positive actually this import but be he just do that i mean how be he
S0037	yeah but never get anywhere
S0115	be he buy how's he buy it cos he's buy stuff from china isn't he
S0037	he's um mhm
S0115	and who's he where's he
S0037	he's buy them from china these so it's a wrestle thing so apparently um
S0115	yeah
S0037	certain wrestlers like i don't really follow the wrestle
S0115	no i don't don't follow wrestle no but
S0037	all these different wrestlers or whatever um and well it come about cos he want to himself to buy like a a t shirt with like let's just make up a name like steam or something
S0115	tent tent peg
S0037	right so he want to buy a steam steam tent peg
S0115	tent peg and his arch enemy stone or mister pebbles or whatever like
S0037	steam tent peg he want to buy his um want to buy a shirt a shirt with his face on or i don't know some sort of anyway he want to buy some shirt some wrestle shirt
S0115	yeah
S0037	and he realize he could only get it from the us or from china and it be really expensive it be
S0115	yeah so he choose china because it's cheaper
S0037	well no i mean to buy one for himself and it be like pardon me it be really expensive so then
S0115	yeah so buy like a like like he's like bite like del boy he's a bite of that in him
S0037	he he be definitely like del boy so then he work so then he look into how much he would cost to buy cos he have some mat who want one as well or something
S0115	yeah
S0037	and so then he work how much it would cost to buy ten and how much it would cost to buy a hundred or whatever so then he get in touch with some whoever and buy like however many
S0115	yeah
S0037	then start sell them online so he's be do that and then i think now i'm not sure if he's rent a a rail in like a alternative shop in the galleries alternative i mean like
S0115	yeah
S0037	goth punk rock you know
S0115	so he's rent rent a rail yeah that sound like like a promise thing although like like
S0037	well he say it's do some it's pay some bill
S0115	it it do sound promise um
S0037	so and he's like 's he's do 's nana's garden and he's wash someone else's car and
S0115	well he's he's really come out with you know mass of ideas mass of like plan and that
S0037	he have to i think he's just scar cos like obviously
S0115	i think i would've though that be it still okay i'd think though that like while he's in he he's put in a lot of time but i think it's also important to try and be you uh change it or
S0037	no no it's fine
S0115	well keep it keep it go or or
S0037	yeah i know
S0115	i think he he would try and maybe get something with a higher rate of pay so that if if if possible
S0037	yeah he really should i dunno i'm hop that he'll just scrabble around and eventually like find something that'll come good but in the meantime he's just like do odds and sod
S0115	i think i i'd say probably most likely that he would make more out of import and sell i think
S0037	well i don't know it's hard to tell
S0115	i think that that be that be more it's the most promise sort of thing
S0037	depend like how much the demand be for like these weird wrestle shirt
S0115	well yeah i mean i suppose you make connections and you make demand connections and make supply connections and in theory
S0037	yeah
S0115	um you could use those connections to sort of
S0037	well yeah i mean or it might lead on to different things you just don't know
S0115	although yeah
S0037	but he'll be fine like he always he always like
S0115	really
S0037	come out of it okay
S0115	would you say he would you say he always come out okay like
S0037	no because he he make it okay like he just he'd work he'd work a hundred hours a week if need to like
S0115	yeah
S0037	he's not one of these people who's like i've get nothing to do and i've get load of bill he'd just go out and
S0115	yeah i mean he's he's the he's the sort of person that who you would tell um you know uh like someone who's who's on benefit or something
S0037	yeah i know
S0115	you tell them what do and 's get like ten different job like you it's never true that there's that there's no that there's no like
S0037	no that's what i get that's what i get annoy about like
S0115	the the only
