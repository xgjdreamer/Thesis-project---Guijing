S0254	cos i've get an afternoon around museums and and i know we've do that one but i enjoy that so that'll be nice mm
S0253	do we do that one
S0254	yeah we do it a while ago didn't we and then we have in erm
S0253	weren't we head
S0254	that be a really nice day
S0253	weren't we head somewhere that way that day though
S0254	you go we go to look at those erm ship posters in the maritime museum
S0253	that be a bite of a let down that wasn't it
S0254	yeah but the two posters that they have
S0253	they're still there you know
S0254	yeah i know i know i be i tell you i be there the other day didn't i
S0253	do you actually have a look round the museum
S0254	no not really i be a bite eager to get out it's er
S0253	why why do they have meet there be there be there conference room
S0254	yeah on the fourth floor there there's a café and then behind the café there's like a just like a large room really so there be like circle table and then they have a projector and stuff like that
S0253	yeah
S0254	they do lunch which be nice erm it's just that the people who do the course be like a private company so they obviously be just promote themselves really and
S0253	yeah
S0254	say don't use the nhs cos they're rubbish come to us instead and obviously they be preach to their most like ninety percent of the audience who be work for the nhs
S0254	so it be a little bite awkward at time
S0253	yeah
S0254	but you know free lunch cost me six quid to park there though mind
S0253	that's how much it cost to park there
S0254	park there for three hours cost six pound have to claim it make sure i remember to claim it back
S0253	in our on on street it's four pound or something
S0254	i know it
S0253	they
S0254	the only reason i park there cos i there be probably more intelligent place for me to park if i'd have have time to walk but i be run late anyway from and i be in so i just think oh i'm just gonna have to park there
S0253	yeah
S0254	yeah so what do you want to buy
S0253	an electric toothbrush
S0254	i saw i've save the page on the thing if you want to
S0253	the the kindle
S0254	the ipad
S0253	oh yeah erm i think i just wanna get this one it's the cheapest one it's get good
S0254	yeah
S0253	braun oral b vitality precision
S0254	do it come with spare head how much be the head be it like a printer it's cheap to buy the actual toothbrush but the replaceable brush be really expensive
S0253	ah they're not soft be they
S0254	i don't know but i'm just think be that a way they make their money cos normally electric toothbrushes be quite expensive aren't they do it have a buy together with oh no you how much be the three brush head pack of three ten pound be that i mean that'll last age you're suppose to change your toothbrush every six months aren't you so
S0253	yeah
S0254	technically that would last you two years
S0253	so i don't need a shaver adapter do i or do i i haven't get one of them
S0254	i've get one of them
S0253	have you to plug stuff in
S0254	yeah
S0253	so i don't really need that set do i for the thirty two pound
S0254	no you don't even really need to buy the other brush head
S0253	just buy batteries

S0253	what the
S0254	swan
S0253	swan they're a bite of a creepy band sparklehorse be good
S0254	i be look at slightly more bore toothbrush holders though i suppose if you're get an electric toothbrush so we'd don't need a toothbrush holder cos you can't put an electric toothbrush
S0253	don't
S0254	in a toothbrush holder can you
S0253	don't let that stop you if you need to er
S0254	shall i show you what i be look at it's ten pound though
S0253	yeah by all mean
S0254	ten pound in john lewis for a toothbrush holder
S0253	i nearly buy a self help book today
S0254	do you buy a self help book
S0253	it be i don't know what it be that i it be just about it it's one of those those popular sort of psychology book where it be like about you know control get control of your life and control anxiety and stuff like that
S0254	mm
S0253	and i think i cos i be like i be in the train station and i be feel a bite anxious be be they orla kiely or whatever her name be
S0254	no it's just john lewis tulip
S0253	how much do they cost
S0254	the thing on its own be ten pound the soap pump's like twenty eight quid or something oh no sixteen pound for a soap pump i think er not this be why we should get marry
S0253	why
S0254	put it on our wed list posh toothbrush holder it's the kind of stuff that people buy you isn't it
S0253	that's not the only reason to get marry
S0254	well it's a pretty good reason
S0253	you're so cynical
S0254	i know
S0253	that's that's why i'm never gonna marry you
S0253	cos i know it would only be for the gift
S0253	not for love
S0254	i love you
S0253	i know
S0254	you know i do just be an add bonus if we get a load of present
S0253	i be speak to about this and he say that cos i be talk about how you know the way do his where he erm
S0254	yeah
S0253	er he he travel around and say that cos er i say wouldn't that appeal to you like you know basically pay for your honeymoon and he say no because we're get a new we're because we're buy a house we need everything he say
S0254	yeah
S0253	and he just say he say you know i mean i it's it's er cos i mean i dunno 's not like very materialistic to be honest he's not really bother about you know
S0254	mm
S0253	he's he's really not like about about like the interiors of place like he's
S0254	i think he'd more er he be more than you he do have an opinion i remember them argue over the style of din plat or something
S0253	really
S0254	cos be really particular he want a really particular shape of din plate
S0253	oh
S0254	i remember tell me
S0253	each to their own
S0253	but erm but it well he but he say i think when it come to furniture and stuff he just say you know you have an idea of what you want but the fact be that it's all so expensive you're just gonna go to ikea
S0254	mm
S0253	and you're gonna fill your your house with stuff from ikea and it's true isn't it because i mean
S0254	yeah
S0253	unless you've get bag of money you can't possibly furnish a house with like designer gear
S0254	no not straight away i think what i would do if i be buy a house be get hand me down and as many freebies from people as possible and then i'd replace each thing with what i really want
S0253	yeah
S0254	so say then i'd replace you know you know your sofa when you could afford it with a really nice one
S0253	yeah
S0254	so even if you be just completely mish mash for a while eventually you'd have everything you really want over time wouldn't you
S0253	mm
S0254	cos obviously very rarely can you afford to buy like everything you want straight away
S0253	yeah it's true yeah i dunno as i say er after after see 's it just make me really want my own place
S0254	mm
S0253	so be that where you'd live then
S0254	i dunno really i just er well i just like see my nan and stuff today like i would like to be able to go and just call round
S0253	yeah
S0254	to see her like you know once a week and
S0253	it's on it's on the balance of things i mean maybe there be a point i mean i you know where's we've be talk about maybe there be a point where i do more socialise over here than i do over on
S0254	yeah
S0253	but now
S0254	i just feel like i'm always travel over to
S0253	i'm but i'm start to feel a bite now like i mean obviously i've get i mean er i'm i'm bear in i've get 's er next week in the back of my head but you know i'm think about like sort of if i wanna see more and
S0254	mm
S0253	erm you know it's nice that 's come over on tuesday but i'd see him a bite more i just need to see my mum and dad i'm think i might go home tomorrow afternoon to see my mum
S0254	yeah
S0253	but i'm gonna do that that's definitely what i'm gonna do i've get nothing else to do tomorrow actually
S0254	yeah
S0253	i'll be back i'll be back by dinner time though
S0254	mm don't worry
S0253	erm
S0254	stay for tea at your mum's if you want
S0253	no
S0253	don't want don't want turkey burgers
S0254	turkey dinosaurs
S0253	turkey dinosaurs yeah
S0253	erm yeah i just feel like i need to see her really
S0254	yeah
S0253	i haven't see her in so long
S0254	well this be it and like it's just little things like my mum really want to start go to yoga but she hasn't get anyone to go with and it's like
S0253	yoga
S0254	you know just stupid things i know that's really daft but it's like
S0253	but you'd like to go with her
S0254	i could go with her or
S0253	yeah
S0254	you know we could ah i dunno i just
S0253	yeah i i know i get it
S0254	i dunno what it be really
S0253	i get it i'm start to feel a bite the same
S0254	then i could just feel like everybody you know all my friends well i say all and
S0253	but but you know er
S0254	but you know i don't have any friends in any more really you know like and aren't here and
S0253	yeah but i mean i'm i'm the same
S0254	you know like the majority of my socialise be go out with them and go out with the people so now that they're not here i kind of you know i can't even really remember the last time i be in like even just shop
S0253	the thing be as well i suppose be that i mean it it like anything i'm want to do over here you know i've i've be fine so that you know when i be when i be in i just commute so like
S0254	mm
S0253	or come over for you know like on saturdays if i wanna watch the match over here
S0254	mm
S0253	i watch the match
S0254	the only thing be the price of train ticket now isn't it
S0253	that would be
S0254	probably
S0253	there's and there's no way round it er if you drive it's gonna be more expensive
S0254	mm
S0253	cos of park erm
S0254	yeah
S0253	the only way round it would be to get the bus the four ten
S0254	i bet that's very expensive though isn't it
S0253	but i think it's quicker i think
S0254	do you think
S0253	i think i think it would be quicker to get the four ten from to town than it would be to get from here of a morning
S0254	maybe
S0253	because if you think about the route it go there's not much traffic even of a morning there wouldn't be much traffic like
S0254	no probably not
S0253	er
S0254	by the time you
S0253	well i guess what i'm say be it wouldn't be it wouldn't be ridiculously
S0254	and we couldn't afford
S0253	no
S0254	you're gonna get a new job soon anyway
S0253	well i happen to know two people who be rent a room in and would love love tenant
S0254	who
S0253	mum and dad
S0254	oh
S0253	yeah no i'm start to i just wish there be somewhere that i could afford to live that be a bite like
S0253	i guess
S0254	yeah
S0253	but that but that that feel a bite far away from
S0254	yeah that's still just as far as here really
S0253	mm well it's not
S0254	well it kind of be it's a good twenty minutes to from to
S0253	mm not as though
S0254	well yeah
S0253	i dunno though you know say that though like obviously i've be really busy the past few months but i know what'll happen as soon as say i mean by the way you know we can't realistically think about move to
S0254	no no of course not
S0253	but i feel like i know what would happen and it's i'd kind of like er you know you move away from somewhere and you idealise it think
S0254	yeah
S0253	oh it'll be a bite better and things like that and oh you know i i could i could see this person see that person but inevitably as soon as you move home you won't see anyone like
S0254	yeah
S0253	my my mum my dad's always out so i never see my dad anyway my mum's always in bed like
S0254	mm
S0253	i'm never gonna i'm not gonna see any of them three be i like around cos they never see each other anyway
S0254	mm
S0253	erm and and it i'll just and then the at least here like there's a lot to do even on your own on a saturday like
S0254	mm
S0253	i can you can go into town or you can you know
S0254	yeah yeah there's stuff stuff to do
S0253	or me and you can go go out for some food or go for a walk in the park
S0254	yeah
S0253	just little things like that that you you do take for grant a bite
S0254	i love go for a walk in the park after work i really like do that
S0253	well i should we should try and do it before it get really cold
S0254	yeah we should cos i really miss it or you know at christmas
S0253	certainly be well
S0254	i'm look forward to christmas though
S0253	i haven't i just i feel i just really feel like i wanna get i just wanna get on with the year i know that sound really stupid i just feel like i've get a lot wait in the wing i haven't really but
S0254	mm like what
S0253	you know i'll say about i dunno just in term of your
S0254	yeah well the next sort of month or so will be i dunno i feel like it's gonna be like decisive but it probably won't it'll be like well you haven't get an interview and it's like right okay then
S0253	end of discussion
S0254	end of yeah
S0253	i
S0254	mm
S0253	if if that happen
S0254	well i'll be really sad if i don't get an interview and i think i really deserve an interview
S0253	it's yeah
S0254	but
S0253	you never know with these things do you any more
S0254	exactly
S0253	it's hard to hard to gauge whether you'll get one or not
S0254	mm
S0253	but i be just sort of say this to i say you know i just i feel like that's kind of what i'm wait to find out about and i'll be so happy if you get you know and and even if you just get an interview
S0254	yeah i wish you could come up with me if i get an interview
S0253	i won't be able to
S0254	no i know
S0253	erm
S0254	i'm gonna do hen party things
S0253	while you're there
S0254	yeah
S0253	what do you mean like just on your own
S0254	bite mad though
S0253	like wear a sash
S0254	yes gonna wander round
S0253	woo
S0253	who's that weird girl erm
S0254	there's a few things like i wanna get like map for everyone so i need to like go into like a tourist information or something
S0253	er what
S0254	just wanna have a wander round
S0253	what would you do
S0254	and
S0253	er how would you like what would you do just stay there one night
S0254	yeah i'd have to
S0253	where would you stay
S0254	i'd a travelodge or something
S0253	that's gonna be really expensive
S0254	i know i be think of go on cos you know with that
S0253	i wouldn't drive
S0254	no you know if we book that one for it be like on hotels dot com or something
S0253	we need to cancel that don't we
S0254	yeah but you can book them and cancel them so i think if i book it now rather than wait until i know
S0253	yeah
S0254	and then it feel a little bite half of me think oh you're just tempt fate but i think well no i'm not really be i
S0253	or like book a day off work
S0254	that's just superstition
S0253	pre emptively book your day off work for a job interview you didn't get
S0254	yeah so i think if i just book it then you know i'm not book a last minute hotel
S0253	mm
S0254	i can't book my train ticket and that's gonna cost me a fortune
S0253	yeah
S0254	erm because they only give you two weeks' notice or something i mean i have a look the other day and it be about sixteen quid return
S0253	to to to
S0254	yeah eight pound sixty single each way
S0253	with a rail card
S0254	yeah
S0253	how
S0254	i don't know it be
S0253	be you sure
S0254	yeah
S0253	be you sure that wasn't to get on the train
S0254	that be mid week erm but i will be go mid week so
S0253	that's cor that's really good that
S0254	i know it's amaze isn't it
S0253	yeah
S0254	cos i know it be fairly cheap if you book it three months in advance because that's what i plan to do for the hen do but
S0253	mm
S0254	obviously i won't have the luxury of book three months in advance so but it's reassure if we end up live there that it'll just be cheaper to come home on the train cos
S0253	and if you book in advance you know when
S0254	yeah
S0253	and we could book a few in advance so like
S0254	exactly
S0253	so like we we could sort of have plan weekend home
S0254	plan weekend erm cos otherwise i don't wanna be drive that way
S0253	no
S0254	all that way
S0253	yeah it just erm
S0254	well i don't know
S0253	i mean i mean the thing be be like even if you don't get an interview i mean it doesn't change much really but i just feel like i've gotta make i just feel that we've get to make some kind of decisions about things and
S0254	yeah i feel like you've gotta you've get to try and get some plan together yourself really
S0253	yeah
S0254	so i don't feel like i'm dictate everything but anyway
S0253	that's what say the other day say you know oh make sure you know cos i be talk about this and he say well make sure you know you don't just mm but i i've make sense of it in my head i know exactly how i feel about it and i know exactly what i'm do so

S0254	so i can't throw one away
S0253	er how how attach be you to the pan cos they'll have to go
S0254	all three i'll probably
S0253	which one
S0254	your nan's one
S0253	that's horrible
S0254	i'm joke i wouldn't do that
S0253	and that be a better quality pan than anything
S0254	yes
S0253	else we've get
S0254	it be we'll throw the one pound fifty one away from asda i would like that and the erm ice sugar shaker
S0253	i don't like it it look a bite it's like
S0254	don't you like it
S0253	it's bite pastiche
S0254	what do pastiche mean
S0253	i'm not quite sure i just use word like that all the time i use i use word i use them and i don't know what they mean erm
S0253	pastiche
S0254	the person on the recorder will be like mm incorrect use of pastiche
S0253	yeah
S0253	i hope i hope no one judge that
S0253	no i think i believe pastiche be like be when you take you take like an old style of something
S0254	and do it badly
S0253	no cos that's parody so like
S0254	mm but parody be like a comedy isn't it
S0253	no
S0254	if you're parody something
S0253	yeah so like
S0254	you're look at comic effect
S0253	so it's so it's so it's without irony so like
S0254	okay
S0253	but this yeah it's where i think if you look at it it's like it look like that kind of fifties
S0254	yeah
S0253	retro style
S0254	but i don't i like i like the the motion of it the i like the gadget
S0253	but that's gonna oh see this be me say i don't care about what like what er go in my house
S0254	that's okay you don't have to if you don't agree then we won't have it in our kitchen
S0253	well it i think if if if you're one of those people that like love elvis presley and love the fifties and have like you know a a jukebox in your house then yeah
S0254	what other flour sifters have they get then have they get any nicer ones
S0253	and i'm surprise that there's there's there's more than one in existence
S0254	oh yeah i've never see them before
S0253	well what what about a nice chrome one
S0254	mm cos they're bore
S0253	they're futuristic though
S0254	mm
S0253	they're all pretty much the same aren't they apart from that one
S0254	yeah okay well we probably won't chase it then
S0253	how about that one mrs anderson's bake three cup stainless steel crank flour sifter
S0254	mm cos it's still stainless steel that's more expensive as well
S0253	so how much be that one so you want that retro flour sifter yeah i'm just gonna put it on the list add to wed list

S0254	mm
S0253	power
S0254	not the measure cup i think that's a bite pointless

S0253	diner style
S0254	yeah
S0253	things anything else you want
S0254	erm
S0253	just just say stuff cos i need to get ideas

S0254	spice tin i think they be
S0253	spice tin
S0254	might not have them it's old stock oh that's it so look see and it come with erm load of different label so you can put your own label on but it doesn't match all
S0253	do it
S0254	doesn't
S0253	do it do it actually have space these look rubbish
S0254	yeah they don't have they don't match my orla kiely so everything have to match orla now so i don't want to be one of those people that have like an entire collection of something
S0253	feel like i'm in like revolutionary road
S0254	you don't have to get me anything for the kitchen i'm quite happy with the spice be in their own spice jar that you buy them in i'm okay with that
S0253	mm i dunno i don't like it when everything match
S0254	yeah no i don't either
S0253	sort of just
S0254	i like it to be i like it to erm complement but not like the entire orla kiely set like it can't look it can't clash
S0253	but that's what it appeal to doesn't it like sort of people's like fascinate with like order and like
S0254	mm
S0253	everything match and everything look the same sort of kind of yeah

S0254	that's
S0253	occasionally
S0254	his brother's break up with his girlfriend
S0253	that's sad
S0254	yeah
S0253	i think he say it be i remember say it be a long time come though
S0254	oh i know be quite please about it but she's er
S0253	she
S0254	not take it too well anyway despite the fact that he be the one kind of hold her back really he's quite happy to sit and play game all day every day
S0253	yeah
S0254	like he doesn't wanna go on holiday he doesn't wanna move out he doesn't wanna get a job or a life
S0253	this be what a
S0254	it seem
S0253	say to me that be his concern
S0254	about his brother
S0253	yeah i mean it you shouldn't like you shouldn't sort of deride him you know because his interest be computer game it's no different from be interest in
S0254	mm yeah of course
S0253	play play the sunday league or
S0254	but i i like paint but i don't sit at home all day every day and refuse to get a job
S0253	but but but you're not
S0254	because i like paint
S0253	but you're not like er you know you're not obsess with it like and you know i think i tend to think with computer game people who don't play them often thing oh god sit at home and play computer game and they picture like a teenage boy in a bedroom with a lara croft poster
S0254	mm
S0253	but he one i know for a fact that be be like you know incredibly good at like certain computer game and it's it's his interest it's his passion
S0254	yeah i know but
S0253	but i know what you mean i'm not say that's an excuse i mean hamburgers be my passion but i wouldn't break up with you just so i could eat more i probably would
S0253	i probably would
S0254	i take it back i would
S0253	erm
S0254	but you know unless he's pursue that in some sort of
S0253	professional
S0254	yeah way
S0253	but why do everything always have to be job like
S0254	well it doesn't but you can't you've gotta make a choice haven't you you either try and make that your job or you have to get a job and do that in your spare time like you can't choose to not work and live at home with your parent and because you don't and like not want anything else cos you just wanna spend all your money on computer game that's you can't really do that can you that's not be
S0253	no
S0254	not grow up
S0253	no i agree
S0254	i feel like 's like that well i'm just gonna hold out until i'm a computer game expert how exactly do you expect to be a computer game expert when you're just sit in your bedroom as if like someone's gonna knock on his bedroom door and be like oh er there's this professional like computer game tester job open up do you wanna do it and that's just not gonna happen be it so people be quite naïve
S0253	yeah that's it i do see your point
S0254	like i don't
S0253	i think i think you're just really like it's just not in your it that's not in your sort of nature to to to think like that or to be like that so
S0254	mm no no it's not but like you know i it's fine for people to have
S0253	that sorry just to put that shirt be two hundred and seventy pound be they have a giraffe
S0254	a mountaineer mountaineer shirt number three
S0253	i'd feel i'd feel really cool in a mountaineer shirt
S0253	but i'm not pay two hundred and seventy pound
S0254	you would also feel very poor you'd have no money to go or anywhere and wear the shirt what possible reason can be two hundred and seventy pound
S0253	it's make from real fox
S0254	oh that's
S0253	it's not like an ethical company
S0254	make from fox entwine with gold thread
S0253	gold thread fox but yeah no i dunno i i think it be a bite of a male thing as well
S0254	why i wouldn't like i feel a bite bad that you don't play on your xbox at all like
S0253	well i've lose interest in it
S0254	well yeah
S0253	i've just grow out of it really i feel like i don't have the time if i be unemployed i'd be all over it
S0253	but it it's like it's like be say the other day like he's get a ps4 like cos he's he's move in with erm
S0254	really
S0253	yeah
S0254	i think he always say live apart that's the best way
S0253	it be that's why they're move in together next year
S0253	it be mean to be this year
S0253	but erm so they've kind of they've agree so they're gonna move in together in but i think i think he's quite happy without it
S0254	mm
S0253	erm but he say he say obviously i'm gonna have to get a credit card cos i don't think he can really afford it the or he can't afford the whole shebang
S0254	mm
S0253	he's on he's on like a he's get a good job erm but he say so he say i'm just gonna get a playstation on my credit card as well and pay it off bite by bite
S0254	might as well
S0253	erm
S0254	i'm all about the credit card
S0253	really
S0254	yeah you know i've get a credit card
S0253	oh just the stupidest thing
S0254	no the reason i have get a credit card be because when you buy flight and holiday it if you need the proof and you only get the proof if you've buy it on a credit card so when i go to australia i buy my flight on a credit card
S0253	yeah
S0254	then just pay it off the next month essentially or no a couple of months but it's interest free so now i just move it whenever i have to start pay interest i move the account to somebody else
S0253	yeah
S0254	and then what this one i've get now i buy my car insurance on it because i didn't have enough money to buy my car insurance all in one go
S0253	yeah
S0254	but if you buy it month if you pay the them monthly you end up pay an extra hundred pound by the end of the year so i think well i might as well put it on an interest free credit card and then pay it off monthly and i'll still pay the same amount rather than pay
S0253	oh
S0254	an extra hundred pound in interest to an insurance company
S0253	yeah i get it just don't
S0254	so that's why i do it i don't like i don't go out and buy things i can't afford on it
S0253	no
S0254	i'm nearly do i'm just pay off my car insurance on it
S0253	do you think i can get away with another grey t shirt
S0254	i don't like that
S0253	that logo
S0254	yeah
S0253	what's wrong with it
S0254	i don't know i think it's a bite how much be thirty five quid for that
S0253	yeah
S0254	no
S0253	no i'm not allow to buy it
S0254	it's it's not very nice it's like the most bore logo
S0253	i know
S0254	it's horrible you can get a much nicer grey t shirt than that
S0254	for less money than that
S0253	that's all i own just grey t shirt
S0253	yeah i don't know i just it's i i don't like the idea of money not be my own i really really don't like it and i hate
S0254	i i know exactly how you feel because if i have no way of pay that money off then i'd be freak out but i can afford to pay it i pay that off a hundred pound a month and i know i'll have pay it off before i start pay interest on it
S0253	mm
S0254	it's just useful to have for things that you have to buy that be very expensive and you don't have the money right now you know you will in like and spread over two or three months but to pay it all in one go be just a bite too much
S0253	yeah
S0254	so why pay interest on your overdraft when you can put it on a credit card for free
S0253	yeah
S0254	just make sense you've just gotta be clever with it
S0253	i just yeah i just lose track of it and then most people i know who have get credit card always have credit card plural never just one credit card
S0254	yeah whereas i just have one
S0253	i think of it a bite like the woman who swallow a fly
S0253	honestly it's like
S0254	like yeah i know i know it do
S0253	they're not do it
S0254	most people get out of their depth and then they can't pay what they've buy but that's when people go shop and put their shop on a credit card and then they're like oh yeah i'll put it on the credit card i'll put it on the credit card and then they completely lose track of how much they've get on their credit card and then they can't pay it back in monthly instalments before they have to start pay interest
S0253	yeah i dunno i just i whereas i'd like to be frivolous i'd like to be frivolous and just buy like a really nice camera or a really nice computer
S0254	yeah i know
S0253	for myself and and then just worry about it later but i just i always feel that i need to watch what i spend and stuff
S0254	yeah
S0253	don't know but erm
S0254	i mean i would say if you be gonna buy i think if you be gonna buy like a mac or something
S0253	mm
S0254	i'd put that on a credit card
S0253	well then have the point of say i mean get a mac didn't he and then he say i say how
S0254	
S0254	oh do he
S0253	and i say i say how
S0254	pay for by mummy and daddy like his flat and everything else he own
S0253	yeah i say
S0254	well it's true though how do he afford a mac on like one day a week employment
S0253	i say erm
S0253	like and he say well well basically a case of you get it on a credit card or borrow it off my parent and you know they don't
S0254	oh and pay them then
S0253	well they don't charge interest my parent don't
S0254	the bank of mother and father
S0253	mm
S0254	erm well that's right you could put it on a credit card and you could put you could pay three hundred pound off it straight away
S0253	yeah
S0254	and then put a hundred pound each month for the other six months or whatever it would be
S0253	yeah i mean you can afford it if you if you're really you're commit
S0254	if you really want it yeah just do you really want one
S0253	nope there's other things i want
S0254	exactly
S0253	as well like an electric toothbrush
S0254	mm and flight to australia
S0253	there's that as well haven't hear actually she be mean to ring me this weekend
S0254	yeah
S0253	and mum say she hasn't be in touch i'm sure she's fine

S0253	you don't have to wear something borrow do you
S0254	no
S0253	er do you watch that gogglebox
S0254	i have watch it on the past it's quite funny
S0253	yeah
S0254	there's a family on it that own a store in market and it's
S0253	really
S0254	yeah there's quite a few and families there be them that own the store there's someone in like or something in think and there's a
S0253	yeah
S0254	old couple from then there's like a posh couple i don't know if they've get different families or on it now
S0253	yeah
S0254	haven't see any of this
S0253	that's 's new dog
S0254	ah that's cute it look like a toy
S0253	probably be
S0254	i be say to my mum yesterday cos i be genuinely think about it as when i be drive home on friday i be like wouldn't it be really great if i go home and then mum have just buy a puppy and there be a puppy there
S0253	really
S0254	yeah and just be think about it and i be like that would be really cool and i tell my mum and she just start laugh and she say well
S0253	oh right and
S0254	so that didn't happen
S0253	i i i i think i think you be gonna say that and then she have one
S0254	oh no no i keep tell her that she should because it would make her go out for walk and stuff cos she keep go on about how she want to walk more and like every night they need to go out and i say well if you have a dog then that would make you go out wouldn't it
S0253	yeah
S0254	and she be like no
S0253	it's
S0254	don't start
S0253	be say like cos i i say i'm i'm devoid of something to do with my even and he say well he say i wouldn't
S0254	have a dog and a baby
S0253	yeah that's your solution but he say like because of er he say it it just get him out the house and he'll he'll get up really early in the morning and take him out
S0254	mm
S0253	and it's just a nice thing i use to love walk the dog
S0254	yeah
S0253	erm it's just a good way it it's you know it's sort of sad that you feel you have to have an excuse to go for a walk but
S0254	mm
S0253	have a dog just you're not you're sort of bite of company and you're not on your own and there's kind of a purpose to it
S0254	yeah
S0253	you're not just
S0254	force you out the door a bite more doesn't it cos you have to take for a walk
S0253	yeah erm so he be it be something like that i'm not sure i could handle a dog
S0254	well it's like that pre baby stage isn't it everyone i know who's have a baby recently have have a dog about a year earlier it's like a test
S0253	well say it do prepare you
S0254	yeah
S0253	he say he say it he say it he say it sound stupid but he say it just get you use to have to think about
S0254	something else
S0253	yeah and something depend on you and things like that so i'd be really i'd i'd like a dog but i just can't picture have one now
S0254	mm
S0254	it would be a cruel in a small flat in and although we be near a park so the thing be though it would be on its own from about eight in the eight o'clock in the morning till oh i suppose you come in in the afternoon
S0253	but not always and then it could be on its
S0254	yeah
S0253	it could be on its own like eight till five or something
S0254	mm it's just too long isn't it
S0253	yeah
S0254	it's cruel
S0253	what dog would you have if you could have any dog
S0254	a spaniel
S0253	you can't you've gotta get over like the
S0254	i know
S0253	your childhood dog it just would never be the same
S0254	mm maybe
S0253	you'd get it and it
S0254	but berta's exactly the same as barney
S0253	but you'd get one and it just wouldn't be the same
S0254	mm
S0253	it's like it's like our friend when she get that cat
S0254	when she get the cat
S0253	so
S0254	yeah i really like border colly but they're too they need too much walk they're too lively i don't want anything that smell like your dog or be load
S0254	really energetic or would like destroy everything
S0253	so you're not look for an animal
S0253	per se
S0254	a stuff dog would be perfect
S0253	or or one that
S0254	a toy
S0253	like a taxidermy dog
S0254	yeah what do would you have
S0253	erm
S0254	cos i like tish but tish isn't fluffy she's not cuddly
S0253	i'd have one that like rescue children from mine
S0254	what a kangaroo
S0253	i be think more of lassie unsurprisingly

S0253	but how do a kangaroo save people from
S0254	he's fall down the well
S0253	but how how do the the do do the kangaroo climb down
S0254	i don't know
