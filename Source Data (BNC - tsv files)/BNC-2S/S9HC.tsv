S0268	it's a become a bite of a competition then
S0269	mm
S0268	so where's their where's maddox and that lot where's their report where's their environmental
S0269	well they they've say they it's not necessary
S0268	mm
S0269	ideally you want to say well you do your bloody assessment
S0268	exactly
S0269	it put cost on them
S0268	mm
S0269	that's be the because they're what we have opt for the turbines think of as many ways as you can and duck and dive and kick the can down the road
S0268	yeah
S0269	and think of as many things as you can to put cost on
S0268	mm
S0269	and that's when we bring the heritage expert out of the top hat
S0268	absolutely yeah
S0269	but oh i don't i'm get a bite old for all these fight
S0268	yeah you're get very cantankerous in your old age
S0269	what you on about
S0268	what have i get to do so you don't like me do this
S0269	well what's it what's this read telegraph and all then
S0268	oh get it on
S0269	oh god well i be er we should have see press button won't we
S0268	right it's not really it's not really
S0268	so where be we
S0269	yeah well we we be kick the can down the road
S0268	yeah
S0269	as quickly as we could
S0268	mm
S0269	but i would think the the outcome would be the members say well it's all too much er to take in defer the decision kick it down the road for a month and then refuse it
S0268	mm
S0269	seek more information
S0268	but that would be the ideal thing absolutely and it happen so many time in our case didn't it er referrals and
S0269	yeah
S0268	so yeah
S0269	the worst the worst outcome be if they approve it but i can't see that
S0268	right
S0269	so they either reject it or defer it
S0268	be we all go be we the three of us go we be
S0269	i would think so
S0268	mm
S0269	half past six
S0268	mm er you sure it's half past six yeah i think it be just
S0269	ours be at
S0268	i think there's a possibility that it's six o'clock
S0269	oh oh yeah ah
S0268	just but i i six o'clock seem to
S0269	mm
S0268	stick in my mind more than six thirty
S0269	but the other thing that's concern me be er seem to be away
S0268	mm
S0269	in fact i go round her house cos she didn't respond to the email she didn't respond to the phone call and i think oh
S0268	so how much notice would she need if she agree to i mean we don't even know if they they're do anything er
S0269	's put a erm an objection in
S0268	oh they have
S0269	yeah
S0268	yeah
S0269	but what we don't know be whether anybody at be er gonna speak but they've only get three minutes
S0268	mm
S0269	and that's where 's really cos
S0268	yeah
S0269	she be
S0268	but if er have get three minutes how come have get three minutes
S0269	haven't get three minute
S0268	so they haven't get anybody to talk
S0269	the parish
S0268	but they they might
S0269	parish council aren't allow to speak the opposition group
S0268	oh right okay
S0269	have get three minutes objectors
S0268	okay get you
S0269	right
S0268	get you yeah okay
S0269	and if there's a lot of objectors
S0268	yeah
S0269	the three minutes be split
S0268	right
S0269	so they've really gotta get their act together and just get one speak
S0268	well i think they want one don't they this erm
S0269	yeah
S0268	this person he's gonna be the spokesperson i think
S0269	yeah unless you get the professional that
S0268	yeah well that's what you suggest yeah
S0269	cos i don't believe the plan committee will put much weight on the emotion they'll
S0268	mm mm
S0269	have to stick on the facts because if they don't these developers be quite clever
S0268	yeah yeah
S0269	and they'll appeal it and judicial review it and oh god
S0268	but that again kick the can down the road doesn't it and er
S0269	yeah that's right that's what it's all about
S0268	yeah
S0269	in my opinion kick it down the road as far as you can
S0268	will be there
S0269	who yes
S0268	she she will mm
S0269	yeah there's there's gotta be the the case officer there

S0269	mm
S0268	he you know cos he have a dicky bow on and everything
S0269	yeah
S0268	he look just just the part i think he look like the manager

S0268	mm
S0269	like i say he he don't look as bad as he do
S0268	no
S0269	twelve months ago but then you wouldn't expect him to
S0268	no
S0269	i don't suppose i notice there's one of the house up for sale in
S0268	i notice that as well
S0269	it's not 's though
S0268	oh it's er
S0269	i think it
S0268	what's his name
S0269	be it
S0268	yeah oh right
S0269	erm er that's up for sale
S0268	yeah i never see him i wouldn't

S0269	no i erm well er all i know him from the save cos he he turn up at
S0268	yeah
S0269	a few of the er hear
S0268	yeah mind you i think he be study the form in relation to his case rather than
S0269	oh yeah
S0268	yeah
S0269	i'm sure he be
S0268	yeah
S0268	so maybe he's go erm i dunno maybe he's go back to south africa cos he's south african maybe he's go back there i don't know

S0268	really
S0269	he build these two
S0268	yeah
S0269	erm cos of course the plan permission be initially for one and then he come along once they'd get the plan permission for one they come along for two on the basis of my my mother's get very old and we want her to move in with us er you know we wanna keep an eye on her so can we have two
S0268	so they just that be just lie
S0269	yeah and then it wasn't the sort of granny flat that i think people envisage
S0268	mm
S0269	because then old 's house get build which be
S0268	mm
S0269	like a four bedroomed half a million quid kick
S0268	and how much too high be it because er
S0269	it be
S0268	our our neighbour object
S0269	that's right
S0268	mm
S0269	well it be too high
S0268	it be too high yeah
S0269	yeah that's right but as be the want of our district council they get away with it
S0268	mm
S0269	in the same way as the get away with er new england lodge up there that be way
S0268	mm
S0269	beyond the plan application in term of square footage floor area and in term of height
S0268	but we've come to except expect this haven't we it's like push the envelope
S0269	that's right oh yeah
S0268	to its erm
S0269	that's right
S0268	i dunno to its bloom big envelope
S0269	that's it oh yeah
S0268	so what's the latest for that with the erm new england lodge
S0269	it's still up for sale
S0268	mm
S0269	and still the argument go on on access and all this sort of thing
S0268	and the the he's drop quite a bite on the price
S0269	mm he's
S0268	cos i remember it fall
S0269	down six fifty now
S0268	six fifty as oppose to
S0269	but it's it's stuff er 's move sort out the access
S0268	really
S0269	yeah
S0268	well that's be on on the market for age now hasn't it
S0269	yeah well i saw four months ago when it be sell and say when be you when be you move and he say oh we'll be move within two to three months
S0268	right
S0269	and i so when you be away i saw him on and say you know what's the crack now you know you
S0268	mm
S0269	when be you go and he say well i don't know he say they're still try to sort out the access issue with new england lodge the legal people
S0268	so do it be there a road that go to the back of
S0269	yeah around the lodge
S0268	or up the it's in dispute as to who can
S0269	yeah
S0268	use it mm
S0269	that's right
S0268	and how much you can use it
S0269	the easements that's right easements and all this sort of thing
S0268	oh right
S0269	so it's not just and that's in dispute with new england lodge it
S0268	mm
S0269	it's as well
S0268	i didn't realise it be
S0269	yeah and er the buyer's solicitor won't sign the thing off
S0268	mm
S0269	to allow to move until it all this lot's sort out
S0268	mm
S0269	and it ain't sort out
S0268	so it's
S0269	so
S0268	so he's get a buyer line up but it they're not go
S0269	oh yeah
S0268	yeah
S0269	yeah and he's get a place in
S0268	mm oh have he
S0269	yeah
S0268	oh right
S0269	but er
S0268	a bite more remote there isn't it
S0269	mm
S0268	it's er
S0269	no he be a bite he be a bite deject the other morning
S0268	be he mm
S0269	so
S0268	do i do you know about he's sell his house now in
S0269	have he
S0268	yeah
S0269	oh right
S0268	he get quite a good price for it
S0269	right
S0268	and er
S0269	so he's buy four in belfast now
S0268	well it's a bite like that the plan be for him to buy a house er the house that they're live in at the moment erm which be i i think that's 's father's house but he's gonna buy it off 's dad and they're then gonna buy 's mum's house so it's like two for the price of what or three
S0269	oh yeah
S0268	for the price of one
S0269	yeah
S0268	there's erm the erm the detach house that 's mum own be er four bedrooms just double garage plenty of land drive for fifteen cars or something hundred and fifty thousand there what would that be around here about six hundred thousand
S0269	six hundred five hundred or six hundred
S0268	so and and they're gonna buy that together my understand and 's also gonna buy this house erm that they're live in now for about sixty or seventy and rent it out so he's begin to be a bite of a landlord i think it's not a bad plan be it but
S0269	yeah
S0268	it's alright as long as he's in belfast
S0269	yeah and until inland revenue crack down on it inland revenue be gonna crack down on buy to let in a bite
S0268	mm yeah
S0269	but erm
S0268	yeah but
S0269	in the meantime
S0268	but if he's get the house i mean that's quite a lot of equity isn't it really
S0269	mm
S0268	so you know what i mean
S0269	yeah
S0268	and there's gonna be a big move in a couple of weeks and we've i think the plan be for to hire a van locally here and then and i and will go out over to belfast with all his stuff and then and i will bring the van back on the ferry so that should be a lot of fun
S0269	to where where would you go from holyhead or
S0268	i think he probably
S0269	stranraer
S0268	well he's he do that before he go to holyhead
S0269	right
S0268	cos he buy the car over at one stage
S0269	yeah
S0268	erm
S0269	cos it's either holyhead or stranraer isn't it
S0268	be that when he come back for the wed that he come that way yes it be no i think they come by oh cos he want to take his car back so they come over by air for the wed
S0269	mm
S0268	and then they take the car from here
S0269	right
S0268	and then er they go over on the ferry to well it's dublin isn't it dun laoghaire isn't it
S0269	yeah
S0268	and then it's two hours i think from dublin to
S0269	yeah
S0268	belfast
S0269	yeah that's probably about right
S0268	anyway so i be discuss it with him last night and i think what we'll it's not finalise but it's likely that the three of us will go over and then somehow we'll get that van back
S0269	you'd better check the insurance on the van too
S0268	i know it's gotta er you've get to look into this because
S0269	mm
S0268	especially if there's gonna be potentially three drivers
S0269	and if you're go through republic of ireland
S0268	yeah yeah
S0269	they might er
S0268	yeah we need to do all this
S0269	yeah
S0268	beforehand
S0269	sure
S0268	before before yeah it's a foreign country isn't it
S0269	yeah
S0268	yeah unless it be a there must be from liverpool can you go to belfast
S0269	erm well you can in the summer
S0268	mm
S0269	er you can go i think there always use to be holyhead ardrossan and
S0268	mm
S0269	stranraer
S0268	well stranraer's a long way to go
S0269	anyway yeah ardrossan's even further
S0268	be it
S0269	well ardrossan's quite a bite higher up than stranraer
S0268	oh i dunno where it be though what about liverpool
S0269	i'm not aware of the liverpool belfast ferry
S0268	i think there be one
S0269	be there
S0268	mm well literally
S0269	oh there use to be heysham as
S0268	the isle of man
S0269	yeah
S0268	from liverpool
S0269	mm
S0268	maybe would that be en route
S0269	no
S0268	mm
S0269	i don't think so and there's heysham up at morecambe that use to do it but that's only a summer thing i think
S0268	mm so that's gonna be a interest
S0269	oh right
S0268	few days away
S0269	might be cheaper to bung it all in a container
S0268	well he's be into it it's well i dunno if he's i think once you're into containers that's quite expensive isn't it
S0269	dunno
S0268	i i dunno maybe i should try that it's cos you you'd only have a little bite of a container wouldn't you
S0269	mm
S0268	so but then you've gotta get it all to where the container be presumably or
S0269	well they'd bring the container to the door on the back of a truck and you get three hours to load it up
S0268	oh right
S0269	in the price
S0268	so it's a small container it's not one of these
S0269	mm
S0268	bite things with maersk on
S0269	no i dunno i dunno how much stuff he's get
S0268	mm
S0269	mm
S0268	well i'll have to look into that
S0269	mm
