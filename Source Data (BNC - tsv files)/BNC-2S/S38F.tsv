S0441	mm
S0439	collapse didn't she actually when she be have
S0441	no do i think or do they both
S0439	i think it be both of them
S0441	mm
S0439	i don't know whether that be a reaction or whether it's just a fear of an injection to be honest
S0441	yeah
S0439	i'd assume it's just a fear of an injection
S0441	although i don't think be be scar
S0439	well maybe hers be a proper reaction then
S0441	yeah
S0439	i've always be fine with erm injections it doesn't bother me
S0441	i'm not faze
S0439	yeah i'm just like whack it in it's fine
S0441	it's like it's sore but although i didn't like i have a blood test recently and i didn't like that
S0439	really oh
S0441	it be weird
S0439	be that the one where the nurse couldn't find the your blood vessel
S0441	it just felt really weird i felt like i literally felt like i be go faint it be horrible
S0439	i've get quite a good blood vessel in that arm i always think i should give blood
S0441	yeah yeah i'd like to give blood but i never know really where to go and how to do it
S0439	no or it's always like it's always not the wrong time it's always just like you look and it's the next day or something
S0441	yeah
S0439	you're just like oh great
S0441	not not ready for that
S0439	no we should do it though
S0441	yeah
S0439	actually get erm a letter through from about the erm you know you when you have bone marrow take out of your back and you give to erm
S0441	what he actually give some
S0439	erm he's get the letter through they've ask him to send a blood sample to see if he's a match
S0441	mm
S0439	it's a really really painful erm procedure
S0441	yeah it's really it's really painful bone marrow
S0439	i be think i be like be you consider do it and he's like well yeah obviously i be like good
S0441	fair play
S0439	that's good yeah cos i i actually donate cos all you have to do be donate spit it's just saliva and i do that it be up in in something i be like yeah sure why not erm but yeah yeah they actually call him up and say we think you're a match for somebody so
S0441	pretty amaze
S0439	yeah it's just really sad though cos erm you know obviously die recently of brain cancer
S0441	mm
S0439	he donate maybe like five years ago bone marrow for somebody who have leukaemia
S0441	oh
S0439	it's just kind of like why be it that one man who you know save somebody else
S0441	mm
S0439	die of cancer doesn't smoke doesn't take drug
S0441	sad innit
S0439	and then other people who smoke and take drug and get nothing
S0441	mm
S0439	not that smoke mean you should get cancer that's not what i'm say but you know like somebody who really shouldn't and be a good person just get cancer and die it's not very karma for you be it
S0441	no
S0439	but
S0441	yeah
S0439	as long as he go if he do go through with it
S0441	mm
S0439	i can't yeah it's horrible you'd be out of action for a while wouldn't you
S0441	apparently it's very very painful
S0439	yeah that's all i've hear that it be excruciate but they take it out of your erm spine don't they they take it out your spine
S0441	yeah this be probably not the same but i suppose even if you hit your sort of bone i suppose it it hurt doesn't it so for something to be inject into your bone
S0439	and take out of your bone yeah
S0441	ow
S0439	oh god the thing be i be watch erm there be this netflix series call marco polo and there be this little girl and she be nine and it be base it's base in china or mongolia and they have to they decide to break her toe you know to make her feet smaller but they they start it when she's nine and like i be watch that episode and you know when you just feel your my toe for like the rest of the even just felt really peculiar cos you saw them crack her toe and break her feet
S0441	er at least it be a baby
S0439	i know it's just like er
S0441	probably like a traumatic event for the rest of her life
S0439	i know they try to when when she obviously get save by the goodies they try to like re straighten out her toe but that be probably just as painful
S0441	yeah just leave them
S0439	ah i couldn't imagine anything less well it's like when you hear like article like female genital mutilation don't you it's like cross my legs hope you do
S0441	that's horrid isn't it
S0439	yeah it's grim it's grim that it still happen
S0441	it get make illegal in nigeria i think recently
S0439	do it
S0441	mm
S0439	do you also know like a few years ago apparently erm bestiality become illegal in scandinavia
S0441	nice
S0439	i know i know i be just like only a few years ago yeah like
S0441	bite late
S0439	like pretty sure that become illegal in like england a long time ago
S0441	yeah like literally hundreds of years ago surely
S0439	yeah don't really think sleep with animals be the best thing to do
S0441	it's not okay
S0439	no no it's not
S0441	it's so weird how er i can't ever imagine look at an animal and be like hey
S0439	how's it go hey bunny rabbit
S0441	the thing be though i don't know why cos but animals don't do it for pleasure do they so why would they do that
S0439	apparently dolphins have sex for pleasure
S0441	yeah they do but that's go to be pretty hard to have sex with a dolphin if you're a person
S0439	i wouldn't even know how to have sex with a dolphin
S0441	where would you even begin
S0439	i certainly wouldn't want a blow job off one you're like chomp chomp chomp
S0441	too much teeth
S0439	yeah i'm not that sure how you would have sex with a dolphin either way i'm pretty sure it would not be a very pleasant experience
S0441	i wonder if it's like force
S0439	well yeah it would be rape wouldn't it essentially it would be rape on an animal
S0441	they wouldn't want to would they what would be the purpose of it they're go to procreate aren't they
S0439	er god it's it's a horrible horrible topic why would people why be there weirdos out there who do it i guess there's weirdos out there who do load of things don't they
S0441	yes
S0439	yes there be luckily none of them live here well we hope we hope isn't full of weirdos and scary people
S0441	when me and my mum go to the pub there be quite a lot of weirdos in there
S0439	ah
S0441	you never know
S0439	true lurk outside every door god i hope not it's weird though like you always hear the article in the news and you're like girl walk home get abduct and you just i'm always just like oh it's never go to happen to me
S0441	me too
S0439	i'm so complacent about it
S0441	i know but you can't think like that anyway can you though cos you'd never go anywhere
S0439	no you just you'd never go out yeah you'd just be confine to your home which be not what anybody want
S0441	car accidents and stuff you always think that will never happen to you
S0439	yeah i think i'm quite a safe driver though so but again yeah it's other people isn't it yeah
S0441	i've get a patient who really sad actually they erm be just drive along and a guy veer into the wrong side of the road and crash into them they both almost die pretty much they both get really bad injuries this be about four years ago but they're still not the same probably never will be
S0439	yeah
S0441	but that's just like ruin their life
S0439	yeah
S0441	and that wasn't their fault it be someone else horrible and they're still wait as well for money and like compensation and insurance and stuff like that
S0439	do you hear how erm bruce caitlyn jenner only get a misdemeanour for kill that woman in the car crash
S0441	the car crash
S0439	i i'm not actually entirely sure what a misdemeanour be but it's definitely not
S0441	but then i suppose what be the detail because if i drive say for example if i be drive along and i don't know someone jump out in front of the road and i didn't have time to stop and i kill them i wouldn't i don't think i'd get arrest for that cos it wouldn't be wouldn't be dangerous drive would it it would just be an accident
S0439	but they don't call them accidents anymore they're call incidents cos apparently there's always somebody responsible
S0441	yeah but i don't think i suppose you don't know the detail do you of the accident
S0439	no true
S0441	cos i suppose that wouldn't be my fault if i
S0439	no if you if someone jump out like if you be drive down the road and somebody actually jump out in front of you and you kill them
S0441	yeah
S0439	no i don't think you would get you wouldn't be prosecute i don't think you would be
S0441	but i suppose you don't know whether let's google it find out what happen with the accident
S0439	no cos like from what i gather he drive into the back of her but i don't know
S0441	that be his fault then isn't it cos that's always always the person's fault
S0439	yeah although 's sister be drive and she have someone in the back of her car and it be they be drive through torrential rain and she crash and he wasn't wear a seatbelt and he die and his parent didn't press charge so she be never arrest
S0441	but be that his fault though
S0439	yeah because he wasn't he be over sixteen if you're if there's people in your car under sixteen apparently the driver be responsible if there's somebody in your car over sixteen apparently the driver isn't responsible
S0441	no but in portugal cos my grandad be like make sure you've get seat belt on at all time because that's his fault anyone in the car be his fault
S0439	mm
S0441	so it's i suppose it's different isn't it everywhere
S0439	yeah it's like the whole erm you know the situation where he be flirt with a girl in america and like be try like do you want to sleep with me and then he get in trouble because she be she be underage no yeah under eighteen and in america you're not allow to have sex till your eighteen but in england you're allow to have sex when you're sixteen and she be scottish or irish or something
S0441	oh so
S0439	so actually it's fine
S0441	technically
S0439	yeah technically it be fine but everybody be like oh be a pervert i'm like i'm pretty sure that girl have be bang around since she be erm sixteen
S0441	yeah
S0441	she's probably alright
S0439	yeah
S0441	right
S0439	okay what happen
S0441	so look pretty bad
S0439	enlighten me
S0441	oh so bruce jenner's suv hit a car and push it into the path of an oncoming car
S0439	so technically it be the oncoming car that kill her
S0441	yeah it occur on a tricky stretch of the highway where road where the road be narrow and twisty er kimberly howe be drive her lexus blah blah blah when jenner strike the rim of her car propel her vehicle into the opposite lanes of traffic miss howe's vehicle be then strike head on by another vehicle kill her
S0439	god
S0441	awful
S0439	so he would get do for hit the back of her but he couldn't get do for manslaughter because he wasn't the one
S0441	because it wasn't her
S0439	yeah
S0441	so that's quite a technicality really
S0439	i do hate i do hope that the person who do her also be not do for manslaughter or whatever the know kind of the
S0441	mm cos that couldn't also wouldn't be his fault
S0439	yeah cos he cos someone push her she be in the way of his car yeah
S0441	yeah
S0439	i don't know i wonder
S0441	er oh it say authorities haven't determine who be at fault in the crash erm
S0439	he jenner must have a fantastic lawyer that's all i can say
S0441	he yeah i very much agree with that
S0439	i just can't believe how quickly he's become a woman
S0441	i know i think it be go on for quite a long time though
S0439	yeah
S0441	he be i think he must have take hormones for quite a long time erm they have open a vehicular manslaughter case
S0439	against jenner
S0441	it doesn't say
S0439	i don't really know how the american justice system work cos i know they they're not like south africa they have a jury but the the prosecutor and the defence lawyer be allow to pick who be allow or who be go to be on the jury kind of
S0441	mm yeah they can they can
S0439	yeah they can veto people but they can pick who be go to be on the jury and interview them can't they
S0441	yeah and pick who's go to give them the best case
S0439	whereas in england you can't do that
S0441	nope erm it say she'll only be charge with a misdemeanour report it be negligence that be the cause so but erm she'll spend one day behind bar
S0439	one day behind bar
S0441	the maximum penalty for misdemeanour vehicular manslaughter be one year in jail caitlyn's drive record be clean and she have no prior criminal history so it would be the same in any case wouldn't it really cos she's get she's
S0439	yeah
S0441	i suppose if that happen to me i haven't get any i've get a clean record haven't i so i suppose they wouldn't say you're go to prison for a year cos that would be not not a threat to society or anything i suppose
S0439	yeah yeah it's the same as like things like speed ticket and stuff normally if you get like your first speed ticket they normally not let you off but they kind of just be like don't ever do that again
S0441	yeah it's really awful
S0439	it be really sad because no offence but his life will carry on exactly the same way he'll still get all the publicity
S0441	yeah
S0439	and and that person be now dead because of him essentially
S0441	like can't you say you couldn't really it be his fault but you couldn't say that she die because of him i think it be just probably one of those
S0439	yeah i guess if there wasn't a car come in the opposite direction she wouldn't have die
S0441	it would've be a different outcome wouldn't it
S0439	yeah or like whatever he be do or however he be drive if he hadn't be drive that way that woman possibly would still be alive so
S0441	yeah
S0439	it's weird but that's the kardash way not a kardashian be he he's a jenner but me and be discuss this today at lunch if you win the lottery would you want your life to change that's what we think we be just like
S0441	maybe i would go on a few more holiday kind of thing
S0439	yeah i like i'd probably buy my sister a house in paris and probably buy my parent something if they want like a holiday home or something and i'd probably buy myself a house or some or go on travel or something but apart from that i don't think my life would change dramatically i wouldn't go out party every weekend or spend thousands and thousands of pound on jewellery or handbags and shit
S0441	no might give up work for a bite
S0439	yeah i might give up work for like a year and go travel and see the world but it wouldn't
S0441	i don't think no i wouldn't think it would change a lot at all
S0439	i don't think i'd become like superficial and just spend load of money on what i hate be when people get money and then buy sport cars and crap like that it's just such a waste of money
S0441	i wonder if these shoe be in the sale speak of shop
S0439	oh which shoe
S0441	i've see some that i would like to get for work in new look just for work
S0439	yeah
S0441	but they're twenty two but they're they're real leather but they're twenty two pound
S0439	mm
S0441	so it's a bite steep so i'm go to see if they're in the sale
S0439	everything be always better when it's on sale
S0441	exactly no matter what it be
S0439	exactly even if it's tea for one pound
S0441	definitely one pound to buy it
S0439	yeah
S0441	make the search a little bite easier cos they've get thousands
S0439	maybe to have in flats yeah i'm go to look through every single pair of shoe and find the specific one that i want to buy
S0441	right colour
S0439	what colour be they
S0441	erm they're sort of tan but there's not a tan option so i'm go for brown
S0439	yeah maybe be they flat
S0441	mm there's not that there's not many brown shoe
S0439	oh i see new look i always find touch and go sometimes they're alright sometimes they're
S0441	yeah they're not here
S0439	i buy a pair of office shoe recently and they be shit
S0441	really
S0439	yeah really really uncomfortable
S0441	take them back
S0439	no cos i'd already scuff them and wear them up enough but they be really uncomfortable and i shouldn't and they be really cheap they be like twenty quid but they weren't decent shoe
S0441	yeah
S0439	but still i expect them to not be as painful as they be it be like and the queue be a ridiculous
S0441	what in office
S0439	yeah and there be like one person serve about three or four people wander around the shop aimlessly like pretend to help customers and then like i be just like the queue have about six people in and i be just like
S0441	get a grip
S0439	yeah this be really poor customer service when we work at next if there be even two people in the queue we have to hop on the till and serve them
S0441	exactly they're not in the sale i've just find them in the non sale section
S0439	damn
S0441	damn
S0439	can you not get a student discount
S0441	yeah but it's not that much and like
S0439	two quid two pound twenty two twenty actually no new look don't even do student discount do they
S0441	yeah
S0439	oh they do now h and m don't do student discount
S0441	no well they're quite cheap anyway aren't they i suppose

S0441	it's five seven years
S0439	mm
S0441	i'll just claim medicine when i when i go
S0439	yeah i'm an oncologist cos then no one want to ask you firstly they probably don't know what an oncologist be and secondly they're like won't ask you because if they do know what it be they know it's really depress and to do with cancer so
S0441	student oncologist
S0439	student oncologist
S0441	i don't then you could be on rotation wouldn't you

S0441	they be like nope well they accept it
S0439	they normally do accept it but they kind of give you the whole we don't normally accept these like but you're go to aren't you
S0441	okay well maybe next time then
S0439	yeah
S0441	stupid
S0439	yeah it be annoy but then again unis should put expiry date on them
S0441	yeah
S0439	like uni should be aware of that then
S0441	yeah my old one didn't have an expiry date either oh yes it do yes it do
S0439	mine definitely do but then buy this card from which be like a it's part it's call a university card but it's for people at the who like want to get into the colleges and stuff and there's an expiry date on it and it look like a like a student card
S0441	oh that's good
S0439	it's seventy pound not seventy seven pound
S0441	that's good
S0439	and it last till two thousand and twenty one
S0441	she be a long time student
S0439	i know so she be like definitely be a student for a long time she can get away with it
S0441	sometimes they say they won't take it cos it hasn't get nus on there sometimes
S0439	i know they're really picky
S0441	really annoy yeah they be
S0439	it's like for christ sake
S0441	it's like two quid get over it you don't even you don't even care about the shop
S0439	and also you can just go on nus and just like make up a fake course and just get an nus card anyway if you want to i think
S0441	well it's quite hard that cos try to do that because he want to buy it but you have to send it to a your email have get to be a
S0439	oh really
S0441	whatever the a c dot uk
S0439	yeah
S0441	it's get to be one of those they won't accept it otherwise which be annoy
S0439	mm
S0441	i think her sister's just start do it but she's go mentorship or something so he's use hers
S0439	i guess cos you for like when you buy things online you need the nus number don't you
S0441	yeah yeah she can't cos asos do student discount but only
S0439	if you have nus number
S0441	yeah not if you've get a normal student card which be a stupid i suppose you can't really do it another way can you
S0439	even if you just have an affiliation with nus like student card should have an you should automatically get an nus number
S0441	yeah but then nus wouldn't make any money though would they well i suppose they would if the unis buy into it
S0439	yeah if the unis buy into it or if you have to pay five pound every time or for your student card you pay five pound or seven pound or whatever and they give you that
S0441	yeah
S0439	and they give you that but i never really go online anyway because i like try things on
S0441	yeah i suppose
S0439	i always find if i don't try things on i buy it they come and then i don't really like them but i can't be arsed to send them back so i just keep them what a waste of money do you erm see that harper lee's book come out today

S0439	it's weird though it's weird how women be make to feel bad about have hair
S0441	i know even if someone do have hairy pit they'd think it be disgust
S0439	yeah
S0441	but it shouldn't really be like that
S0439	no it's weird that men be allow hair everywhere but women
S0441	it's society isn't it it's all such ball
S0439	i know men be like we have a curse because we have to shave every day and it's like well we have a curse because society mean that we aren't allow hair
S0441	any hair
S0439	yeah
S0441	anywhere
S0439	apart from on our head and eyebrows
S0441	i remember like girls who use to have quite hairy arm that use to be like
S0439	i've get really hairy arm
S0441	yeah and i i remember girls that use to shave their arm because they didn't like have black hairy arm
S0439	yeah shave her arm it's really weird she do it every day because it get stubbly i'm just like
S0441	i'm just there's no point be there
S0439	no
S0441	i mean i've get a few i'm quite fair but i've get a few dark ones but i would never shave my arm
S0439	mine be quite dark but to be honest
S0441	can you imagine have stubbly arm
S0439	they're fully bleach at the moment yeah every day you'd have to to shave them
S0441	god
S0439	you'd just be like er
S0441	no thank
S0439	it doesn't bother me too much have hairy arm
S0441	no it doesn't bother me really i don't think
S0439	it's so stupid
S0441	really stupid
S0439	men get it easy
S0441	they really really really do
S0439	we talk about this cos obviously girls before they go to work have to do their hair makeup you know like have shower if they want to shave like all these things that a girl have to do before she go to work to be deem acceptable man get up put a shirt on put on put some like aftershave on rock up
S0441	he could essentially just come nobody would care would they
S0439	yeah no if a woman have a spot it's like oh she's get bad skin if a man have a spot oh don't worry he's just grow he's just go through puberty it's fine
S0441	mm mm
S0439	it's like great thank
S0441	yeah put a bag over my head next time
S0439	walk around like a bag lady they just yeah
S0441	and what's worse though be they can be sterilise and have it reverse so
S0439	they can yeah they just have it clip don't they they don't have it
S0441	if they yeah if they be like damn it i've make the wrong decision it just go fine i'll just reverse it but me
S0439	where we can't really have our uteruses put back in can uteri uterus uteruses i don't know wombs put back in there we go
S0441	i think we only have one womb
S0439	no but i mean like as in women in general can't have wombs put back in
S0441	oh i see
S0439	not like we have multiple wombs go on
S0441	all the wombs
S0439	all the wombs yeah
S0441	it's not fair i suppose it would be a much bigger decision for a woman anyway to have that to have that do
S0439	yeah definitely but also like if a woman accidently get pregnant it become her problem not the man's problem no it's her problem
S0441	when actually it take two
S0439	yeah and it's like guy think that they just don't have to take as much responsibility because it's not grow inside of them it's like true maybe it's not go to change your life dramatically every single day but it's still part of you
S0441	yeah you still bloody well have a hand in make it
S0439	actually they didn't have a hand in make they have a
S0441	probably do have a hand in make it at some point
S0439	probably do have a hand in make it yeah true
S0441	probably a hand be involve at some point
S0439	er yeah true they have a lot involve make it oh men mm think i just might become a lesbian or a nun or both a lesbian nun can you be a lesbian and a nun
S0441	only secretly i wouldn't it wouldn't actually matter anyway if you be a lesbian or not and you be a nun cos it wouldn't make a difference you still couldn't do anything
S0439	true okay scrub that idea let's not become a lesbian nun
S0441	i don't think you'd be able to you'd probably feel guilty about have fantasy so you couldn't even do that
S0439	okay let's we're not we're not become a nun
S0439	no nunning no nunneries come here be erm
S0441	a nun
S0439	no she be definitely not a nun she be a very naughty girl she erm she's yeah i tell you she's gay

S0441	oops
S0439	and she be like but i don't really actually find men attractive like i actually don't want to have sex with him but each to their own i might give it a go i be like so be you go to tell her before you turn up that you just want to do stuff with her and not him and she be like no i'm just go to turn up and see what happen so and they actually have it plan like it's in the diary for like two weeks away
S0441	that's really strange
S0439	like it's like a financial well not financial because it's there's no money involve
S0441	business meet
S0439	it's like a it's like a business meet like a transaction
S0441	weird

S0441	that would ruin it for me
S0439	to be honest i do say to her at least you're the guest could you i would hate if i be not that i ever would cos it not really into that kind of thing but if i be to have a threesome you have to be the guest if not that couple be gonna have it's open up a can of worm aren't you if i have a threesome and i would be like do you find her sexier be she be she better than me
