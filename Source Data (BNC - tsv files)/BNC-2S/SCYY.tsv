S0115	you kill the jesus plant
S0037	i can't believe it's come back to life
S0115	it's quite kind of just like
S0037	it's so good like i never think that it would but actually like when i um when i get it from she say that cos she bring load in to work oh thank you she bring load in to work and um she say oh actually um it have be on my windowsill in my din room and i'd forget about it and i just look at it and it be really like like she say but it have load of little shoot so i pick off all the little shoot and put them in smaller little tubs cos you know we get in a tiny tub and um and she say oh and i just think oh they might grow so maybe they just do come back to life i can't believe the dramatic change though
S0115	yeah but you so you say that she like the main one be brown but she pick off the shoot
S0037	yeah but i think her plant come back like i think it just start again
S0115	mm yeah yeah it must've just be uh thirsty
S0037	dry yeah
S0115	that that's all um that that's the only
S0037	but it's but some plant though once they go past that point of no return
S0115	yeah yeah definitely i mean you you have that one with the
S0037	like i think the chillis one
S0115	what be it
S0037	which one
S0115	yeah the one
S0037	ah the peace lily
S0115	that we overwatered
S0037	um liberal use of we there
S0115	well to be honest i think it be just a really fussy plant
S0037	's get a peace lily and it's so massive now
S0115	ah why don't we get another one it uh how much be it
S0037	maybe they be on offer i buy two for a fiver in marxies i've get one on me desk still i've like a like like uh
S0115	hm oh yeah
S0037	like a like a sort of just a green one with like leafy things it's quite nice doesn't have flower although i i kind of didn't water it it's bad cos sarah keep really good care of it while i be away over christmas you know before your birthday and that and it be lovely and then i i dunno where it what happen but i just sort of totally neglect it and like it's like the crispiest plant in town it's like every time i go near it think it's dead
S0115	ah
S0037	maybe it'll come back to life
S0115	um yeah i mean there some of some plant i think take a lot of uh effort so um but um
S0037	yeah
S0115	as for like you know a lot of the hot ones like oranges that you would need to grow in a greenhouse or something uh
S0037	yeah that's true
S0115	there's we haven't get much space so we can't really like have a an orange tree or anything
S0037	but i fancy get one of those like you know have you see those kind of removable one like greenhouses i mean like they're sort of it's like a shelf it's like a shelve unit but it's get like plastic over
S0115	uh yeah
S0037	can get them from b and q i fancy get one of them
S0115	oh right
S0037	they're only about twenty quid i think think me dad be say

S0037	um i think about as high as you be
S0115	oh right
S0037	so
S0115	where do we put it

S0115	um but uh
S0037	ah d'you know what me leggings like some of them be
S0037	what's your what's your thoughts on leggings
S0115	i d'you i don't i don't really it depend i mean like in principle uh i don't see why you should hate any type of clothe but uh
S0037	well no i know what you mean
S0115	but uh it's a certain just you mean ones that look like the the eighties
S0037	well they all kinda look a bite eighties i suppose but
S0115	but i think we use to wear stuff like that you know in shakespearean sort time
S0037	well yes the legging i suppose doesn't have its rout directly in the eighties although the advent of lycra might've
S0115	cos you see like you know like like
S0037	yeah what be they call again then like uh knickerbockers and that
S0115	men in tights sort of thing
S0037	or robin hood men
S0115	you know like men in tights like
S0037	yeah yeah i've never see that you know
S0115	basically they be knit like
S0037	i've never even see
S0115	they knit them uh they knit them sort of
S0037	well yeah
S0115	uh well i mean they're call
S0037	well woolly tights still be the best like my best
S0115	think i be
S0037	my best pair of woolly tights be the ones that i have on like them grey ones they're the nicest warmest ones i have and i just rip them to shred when i fell off me bike that time like the donkey that i be
S0115	so that uh bike thing uh
S0037	never mind
S0115	yeah there be it be a it be a
S0037	stupid thing
S0115	silly silly accident wasn't it
S0037	well i yo know like the bike man when i tell him about it like you know he he screw my lamp on like so it's fix like it doesn't move a centimetre
S0115	yeah
S0037	and i i never turn it off either i just cycle in the summer with me lamp on i'm not bother i just think i'll just leave it it's just work all the time i don't need to bother with it cos it's a dynamo so
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	i never turn it off
S0115	no oh i i suppose you don't need to do you if it's a dynamo
S0037	well though if you have your light on like if you're drive a car with your light on i mean yes maybe it's flatten your batter but drive your drive your bike with your light on be not do anything be it
S0115	yeah
S0037	so
S0115	alright
S0037	but yeah i'm not a big fan of the i dunno i think they look nice on some people but for example i would never wear a legging in public
S0115	well like i weren't those ones that you be talk about then uh wear in conjunction with something else
S0037	they be they be there's there's a few unusual outfit choices in here tonight
S0115	not not long ago um people use to wear like uh one piece uh leggings and dress combo
S0037	i be i be gonna say d'you ever remember those maybe you don't early nineties trouser skirt combos
S0115	and and a dress look like uh uh
S0037	do you ever have you ever see those they be really weird
S0115	ah no i be talk about the ones that be just like
S0037	oh
S0115	maybe like five or six or seven years ago
S0037	which ones
S0115	yeah it be a one piece leggings and dress combo
S0037	no i don't really
S0115	yeah like a uh
S0037	like a you mean like a cat suit
S0115	or a long top
S0037	that's what that that girl have on like a long top and leggings
S0115	no no no no uh no the the the dress part would have like it be like a lava lamp pattern on it
S0037	oh right
S0115	or a big floral pattern but it would like uh uh a tight dress but it with leggings like
S0037	underneath
S0115	and they'd be like part of the same thing
S0037	be they attach though or do you just seem them in conjunction with each other do you ever explore the attachment issue
S0115	like do we use to no i think they be i mean
S0115	people just
S0037	maybe they weren't man maybe they be just
S0115	uh i could explore the attachment issue like how could i have do that uh
S0037	i don't know you you know
S0115	well i um no um they no some people use to wear them in lancaster like uh like someone from
S0037	yeah but that doesn't mean they be attach
S0115	where i use to work in no i i just think like well
S0037	like
S0115	no but people use to like the sort of seem like they go together anyway i mean even if they weren't attach so that you you could only wear the two part with each you couldn't wear them with anything else
S0037	okay i'm not sure if i follow but yes
S0115	you don't you don't remember those things then
S0037	not not do curry girl wear them
S0115	yeah i think maybe actually uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	although
S0037	i don't think they be attach you know
S0115	i'm not i'm not sure about her like like but there there be quite a few people who wear them but but they be very they be very brief fashion
S0037	i've never be a yeah
S0115	but they they didn't last long
S0037	i've never be a fan of a fan of the legging really i think i'm mentally scar from when i be like nine years old and uh me mam buy us some candy stripe leggings i suppose obviously not not be a girl in the nineties you won't necessarily remember this equally as much as you won't remember like the head band with your name like glitter pen on
S0115	wasn't that eighties
S0037	well you know
S0115	early nineties
S0037	well i be you know i be only seven in the end of the eighties so
S0115	yeah
S0037	nineties really early nineties
S0115	so you didn't like the visor
S0037	but me i like i like a visor and ur um i've get well you've see
S0115	you do like visors
S0037	you've see like that picture of me and our tom and i've get like a a visor and like a a dayglo like green sort of dress on and tom's get like a teenage mutant ninja turtle two piece on it's like
S0115	ah it's awful i mean just
S0037	well it's just the style isn't it we'll probably look back at picture our of ourselves now and be like oh my god why do i think x y and z look nice like you'd be like look at that shirt i be wear look at my beard and all this
S0037	cos i look back i look back at now and my picture of my dad
S0115	oh yeah no i just wear like like ordinary cotton shirt these have be these have be acceptable for like three hundred years or something
S0037	yeah you do i know but it'll be like oh my god i can't believe i wear it tuck out or you know i dunno there'll be something won't there or it'll be won't it it'll be your hair and your beard won't it like
S0115	um i think people should just wear the same stuff like all the time
S0037	forever
S0115	yeah
S0037	but it'll be it'll be your hair and your beard cos that's what change when you're a man isn't it like
S0115	it should should there's no reason why you shouldn't just keep to the
S0037	but you actually you're right like though
S0115	but mind you have have say that i do wear denim trousers not um
S0037	denim trousers that sound like not jeans
S0115	denim base trousers
S0037	i do wear denim denim trousers
S0115	well you can't have denim trousers that aren't jeans can you
S0037	yes you can
S0115	can you
S0037	you could have like chinos make out of denim like a
S0115	those would be jeans though wouldn't they
S0037	like a no but like jeans mean a certain thing
S0115	why be they call jeans anyway be it to do with some french guy
S0037	um yeah i don't know actually i be about it's talk about nimes but then i remember that be denim not jeans
S0115	un no surely any trouser make of denim be a be a jean
S0037	i don't think that's the case
S0115	uh no i i wouldn't think of anyway but uh that's not like i mean this isn't
S0037	yeah but when you think of jeans
S0115	i wasn't that wasn't that wasn't my point my point be uh like you know if if if you want to keep
S0037	like if you see granddads in jeans they're definitely more of a denim trouser than a jean aren't they
S0115	if you be to genuinely have like what
S0037	if you see like a grandda in like a grandda jean that's definitely more a denim trouser than a jean
S0115	i haven't see a grandda in denim i've see a grandda in yeah i mean like not no no no my grandfathers that be both dead no they would not have wear jeans they would've they they wear like what i what i be talk about like uh uh cotton slack
S0037	i don't really imagine they be chinos like a chino like a chino yeah
S0115	what be a chino
S0037	well be be it not like a brand of cotton slack oh actually i think it's a cut i think it's a it's a certain cut cut of trouser
S0115	sound um specific
S0037	um
S0115	no i just mean like
S0037	i bet your cousins like a chino
S0115	do your your um no no no it's not chino i mean you're use like a silly word to refer to like like
S0037	or a corduroy
S0115	use to be like most trousers be suppose to be like that aren't they well they be
S0037	like a dress trouser
S0115	until until we all go mental about jeans like everyone be wear these uh cotton ones
S0037	like a dress trouser yeah
S0115	but then actually over history obviously trousers have change and actually use to have those we be talk about the legging type ones you know the like robin hood men in tights sort of type ones that the uh shakespearean
S0037	yeah like a pantaloon
S0115	them sort of shakespearean tight trousers they use to wear i mean
S0037	yeah like a pantaloon
S0115	and them ones with like the long johns and like uh big sock
S0037	like a drop watch
S0115	you know like georgian like so i mean
S0037	and then you've get like the um the mc hammer
S0115	i think that's that's cool if they just do
S0037	i be play i be play you know draw me you know the the app the game draw me
S0115	yeah
S0037	i be play draw me the other day and i get mc hammer and it be for it be for emma and so i draw i draw like this guy with like a hat on and then like these massive trousers and like colour them in all jazzy colour and write can't touch this so that be mc hammer pant i really know that
S0115	well no you can't write word that's cheat
S0037	yeah you can a bite a few ones
S0115	i don't think you can write word um
S0037	my cousin ross be really bad at it he just write no idea then write the word and i'm like yeah fine
S0115	fair enough
S0037	his spelling's really bad
S0115	well i i i get i just to be honest like i would write like this game be pointless
S0037	the other day he get um vikings ay
S0115	um and then like bye um something
S0037	no it be fun it be funny like the other day i get vikings and i draw like um like a helmet like that and then with the you know like the nosepiece
S0115	uh that wasn't vikings be it
S0037	no wait i draw the helmet like that and then and then the nosepiece like that i think i look more that just look like any hat doesn't it and then i draw two eye and then i
S0115	any hat with a nosepiece
S0037	no but if i just draw a hat like that it could be like a bobble hat i i want to make it look like it be a warrior or something
S0115	yeah oh yeah
S0037	so he type in knight
S0115	well they but their their hat be distinctive so that that
S0037	wait so anyway he he type in knight and then i draw like and then i draw like a massive beard and like an angry eyebrows and then start type in vikings and then i draw the horn on and it take him so long to spell it he be like v i e k no no no no v and i be like oh my god
S0115	so so some uh someone's learn something then haven't they
S0037	yeah
S0115	he's learn how to spell
S0037	spell be really bad though
S0115	you've learn how to draw a viking
S0037	well i know how already
S0115	the game have a point
S0037	it's just an it's just like a daft little game like
S0115	yeah well i i do a couple of ones yesterday didn't i
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh but since they be draw on top of something else that mean that it wasn't quite the same as as like a computer game
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	so so i be draw them on the chocolate bar so
S0037	on the wrapper not on the chocolate bar that sound wrong
S0115	yeah no no no not directly on the chocolate bar so yeah
S0037	anyway sorry i've distract you from your trouser discussion
S0115	um but well um oh yeah so yeah trousers i mean people have wear like strange ones over the years and i suppose if you go really back then everyone would sort wear a sort of jesus outfit wouldn't they
S0037	yeah like frock really
S0115	i don't know if jesus wear what wear a frock if that's what like
S0037	well the romans have like the old toga they like they prefer a a bite of blow in the breeze
S0115	i mean in in the hotter countries they would wear sort of think sort of toga thing
S0037	so like do um you know like a toga so do they wear like undercrackers under their toga
S0115	um uh i don't know um you'd have to go on like you know
S0037	i bet there's a phd on that
S0115	well many uh no i i do do they yeah they probably have like some kind of like long long john thing or
S0037	yeah and women as well i often wonder that like when do women start wear bras like
S0115	oh um yeah well i well i mean whether they do they not have like a variation of it in um
S0037	well you know you know in
S0115	do uh like
S0037	well the um elizabethans love all that kind of repress strap everything in
S0115	elizabethans
S0037	well yeah i mean well actually they have the wench didn't they i mean there be you see those that i mean from the paint and all
S0115	um
S0037	well i think they have like corsetry didn't they
S0115	right i mean didn't they what do they uh the elizabethans cos that oh be they the ones that look like that like pull them themselves into ridiculously tight corset
S0037	corsetry yeah yeah yeah well actually that that that come well the whole corsetry uh thing be be popular for a long time really i mean in the elizabethans yes it be all very truss up like the big the rough and the uh for the men like the tiny the waist tiny waist but
S0115	oh yeah the men the men be quite truss up as well i think weren't they
S0037	but also but especially like in the victorians the whole corsetry really come back again i don't know if it actually go away i'm not sure of what happen in like the seventeen hundreds you know in term of that but um
S0115	so where where be we in
S0037	so like the you know the sixteen hundreds elizabethans i mean they be definitely like certainly the upper class
S0115	the the fifteen hundreds
S0037	sorry the yeah well no actually
S0115	you've skip out the sixteen hundreds there the uh the the sort of oliver cromwell period
S0037	yeah well probably anything go then probably burn the corset
S0115	uh no no i don't i don't think they have much uh that many fashion innovations in england in that in those days like
S0037	well how would we know i mean
S0115	france be have a good time like with uh louis the fourteenth but uh
S0037	i think they always have uh
S0115	but uh we we be have a civil war and and like our country's a real uh in a bite of a mess at that time the sixteen hundreds
S0037	but i think it's a sort of the same now isn't it like people who get money always have
S0115	and that's reflect in their trousers
S0037	people who've get money always buy themselves nice stuff like
S0115	the best trousers uh available
S0037	the best trousers in town yeah
S0115	i don't know i'd like to see sort of a survey of the richest people and and like have that sort of like as a function of like trouser type
S0037	what now
S0115	like
S0037	yeah well now
S0115	trouser like wealth wealth to trouser type
S0037	they'd go down they'd go down ede and ravenscroft wouldn't they and get themselves a like rupert the bear
S0115	yeah in britain maybe but like but who's the wealthiest person in the world bill gate
S0037	probably some saudi prince be it not
S0115	i think bill gate wear cotton slack carlos slim
S0037	i be read a thing about um i be read a thing about
S0115	i mean sultan of brunei well he definitely have some fund like
S0037	i be read a thing about british industry and um apparently one of the most uh one of the british one of the company in britain that turn the biggest profit last year be this company in i think it be sheffield or nottingham one of those kind of midlandsy
S0115	you mean the biggest export profit
S0037	yeah be anyway i think it be nottingham or sheffield i can't remember which and um basically they'd you know those uh airbus airbus plan
S0115	yeah they're french aren't they
S0037	the french airbus plan so those be plan that have get like two two double decker plan you know it's like a total like giant like super giant plane
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	anyway some saudi prince have buy an airbus for himself from the french company who make airbus
S0115	yeah
S0037	and have it customize so that it include for example a turkish bath double you know queen size bedrooms
S0115	so if he need if he want a turkish bath like he might
S0037	a swim pool conference room
S0115	if if he if his own turkish bath be break then he'd have to get in his plane and fly it just so he could use a turkish bath
S0037	well he could just probably use while it wasn't fly
S0115	he'd have to fly it like round round the block or something
S0037	aye
S0115	come back up like on his uh
S0037	well i think he could probably use it when he wasn't fly but basically this kind of basically like you know like they do on cruise ship where it's like just opulence
S0115	ah well uh i don't think it would be the same uh
S0037	and it's things like solid marble this that and the other
S0115	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0037	but anyway this company in
S0115	like everyone like opulence

S0037	oh god do you see that thing where a picture of himself
S0115	i know i know that he's that he's get uh he's get like uh he's get a gym and he's get uh yeah like a treadmill a treadmill and uh and a and a photo of himself in front of the treadmill
S0037	oh it's bad it's so bad
S0115	so that's what he that's what he watch when he when he's in his on his treadmill he's like this be what i be this be what i will be
S0037	oh he's horrible
S0115	or something and uh and i mean i i dunno if he actually like he he
S0037	i dunno i find him really like oily you know what i mean kinda like
S0115	his hair's an interest sort of shade of you know biscuit isn't it like
S0037	biscuit
S0115	he's he's biscuit haired like
S0037	i like that i think he be more gingery like or be that just my imagination like
S0115	certainly some kind of biscuit
S0037	i imagine him in me mind's eye
S0115	yeah ginger biscuit colour quite like like a orangey
S0037	do you ever you know like this this be a seasonal reference here like
S0115	um
S0037	do you ever do at school where you have to take a boil egg in and like decorate it you know like as something like it could be like santa claus or like
S0115	maybe when i be very young
S0037	the easter bunny or like a person
S0115	yeah
S0037	no you must've do that like i do that all through school like michael jackson or something
S0115	well they they really uh they really teach you a lot of stuff don't they
S0037	me dad me dad be really good at it me dad uh make some really good ones but anyway
S0115	sorry i think school be about like learn and that
S0037	no it it be but it's just like an art crafty thing
S0115	right
S0037	but anyway um when i think of andrew neil i just think of him as like a massive egg with just like his little face like as a little sticker on the top like
S0115	well he he's get quite big ears actually
S0037	i never really think about that i just think about him like an egg
S0115	well yeah um so uh in in his own michael portillo obviously and uh uh alan johnson be on uh yesterday
S0037	uh from lancaster
S0115	no he's not from lancaster
S0037	he go to uni in lancaster didn't didn't he be he the health secretary
S0115	i don't think so no he he be
S0037	alan milburn i'm think of
S0115	yeah you're alan johnson be the one who be nearly the leader like uh but he have to resign because of an affair or something
S0037	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0115	uh he's quite old uh but he be like he be pretty like he be quite likable so in fact he he probably would've make a better leader than uh probably the other ones that they've get
S0037	oh miliband just oh he's just insufferable isn't he like he's so floppy and like you know when you see people and they just drain all the life out of you you just think oh like
S0115	well i guess it's something about his um his voice and his his his face i suppose be not be not perfect enough
S0037	be this like
S0115	cos people people always want like
S0037	na na it's not about his face to be honest
S0115	you know someone who's get the right shape face and the right voice you know
S0037	i'm not bother about his face i don't really care
S0115	but no you be though people be i mean
S0037	but he's get that horrible
S0115	if like if you have if you have the voice that you know if his face look more like you know tony blair or something then people'd be more you know
S0037	na i think he's get a really unfortunate lisp
S0115	like imagine tony blair's face tony blair's face and his voice
S0037	no i still don't think it would work because if he's get that horrible lisp
S0115	i mean like you'd be more people'd vote for him wouldn't they
S0037	he's get a and i the one the one thing where they're go wrong at the moment be that like like you be say before the tories have have a bite of a mare this week really and the best he can do be go down greggs and like order a pastie and pretend that he's always in there like that's really the best retort they have that you know the tories the tories be just cannibalize the nhs there's so many things they're do that be really bad
S0115	well him and ed ball be go to
S0037	and the best the best thing labour can do be just be like i'll go down greggs
S0115	well they i'm sure they i'm sure they do other things than go to greggs like uh
S0037	ah well do they you know it's just
S0115	well that's isn't it you you're just base it from the news cos obviously they
S0037	aye but how else be i suppose to know like i can't follow their own i can't follow them like
S0115	they they try to do things
S0037	i know what you mean the news doesn't show everything but how be i suppose to know like
S0115	mind you this uh this process with the nhs be probably probably have be go on on a for for age before i mean like if you're talk about i mean what specifically be you talk about
S0037	yeah but labour weren't do it be they like
S0115	well sunderland away to man city
S0037	ah they're gonna get hammer aren't they tomorrow
S0115	mind you the they might've think that uh
S0037	and who be birmingham play
S0115	birmingham be not in the same division so
S0037	that's oh of course sorry
S0115	they've
S0037	totally forget sunderland be gonna get knacked tomorrow or maybe they'll bounce back after the humiliation of uh earlier in the week na they won't will they
S0115	maybe they'll i mean that be pretty bad
S0037	man city be way man city be top of the league aren't they aren't they or second
S0115	no they're second uh it look like um
S0037	ah well that's not much of a difference
S0115	uh cos cos man unite have have uh an easier uh final group of game than than man city so that's why people think that man unite will will um cos
S0037	yeah run in well actually sunderland have be pretty good away from home albeit let's not mention west brom but they beat liverpool they beat arsenal like they do do some good stuff but yeah i don't know
S0115	well they certainly struggle against everton anyway
S0037	yeah
S0115	um d'you wanna pause it or
S0037	i don't mind d'you want some of this
S0115	yeah
S0037	then we can get one at the same time maybe
S0115	um so uh say that um nhs what be you talk about the nhs
S0037	oh no no i be just say like that i think it be pathetic that like all the things that be happen labour be like look i'm buy a pastie like
S0115	yeah well i mean
S0037	you know what i be say about ed miliband that i think he be like really unconvincing and i much prefer his brother really if anything
S0115	he be more like tony blair though
S0037	yeah but that's not that's not why i like him
S0115	that that that be a fusion like i be say okay so you think that if tony blair have his own face but ed miliband's voice that that the he he would get the same amount of popularity as um as ed miliband or a bite more
S0037	you know i appreciate it be about like um you know promotion isn't it
S0115	i mean it it's it's it's not just your face and voice it's obviously also your style and um your your your gesture and your your mannerisms you know and your
S0037	i think like a like a like a whole man of the people thing could work like i think that's why like ed ball could've could've do better really he's more like a bloke isn't he
S0115	yeah perhaps he's yeah he's the sort of guy who look like he'd actually buy a pastie you know whereas nobody else
S0037	yeah but he be he's along that he's have a few pasties like
S0115	i mean alan johnson be the be the the one that uh that be the most perhaps like ordinary bloke out of all of them
S0037	yeah but i think ed ball i like i like him because i think he be more like he just felt less like slimy and like sort of like the other ones felt like they be just well like they be raise to be politicians you know like that's i suppose i'm just inherently suspicious of these eton oxford type who be just
S0115	well i mean
S0037	like someone else say like oh okay so he go to oxford and then he work as a as a special advisor
S0115	but some of them be labour and some be you know conservative
S0037	and then he now he's a politician like well wow just you know i'm bowl over by that real world experience that he's have
S0115	so so d'you think that no yeah i mean uh i suppose i think that politicians should like
S0037	least they've do something like
S0115	but kind of the the job of politicians be be just like it's sort of waffle isn't it
S0037	yeah i wouldn't wanna do it
