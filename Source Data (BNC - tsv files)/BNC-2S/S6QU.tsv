S0483	perhaps when i'm less busy
S0482	how's your work
S0483	ah erm yeah meh you know just er
S0482	any news on the
S0483	no not yet not yet erm it's in hand with hr you know i've see the
S0482	okay yeah
S0483	see the email and things so
S0482	okay so it's it it's
S0483	it's out of you know it's out of my hand there's nothing more for them
S0482	the ball's in someone's court
S0483	yeah there's nothing more that me or can do so we shall see but yeah i dunno the italian stuff be now gonna go out to tender i don't know how much you know about this but basically you know they're they're ridiculously unorganised every year so every year we get to do it just on the ground that no one else be ready enough but this time
S0482	but you guy aren't ready
S0483	i know but this time erm they're already they've set some test date for september and it it seem like they've really get their act together and i imagine it will go out to tender and there's plenty of people around there you know around that would do it cheaper erm so you know we could we could lose that but at the same we've get to work as if we're gonna get it so
S0482	you've do it before that's get to put you yeah
S0483	yeah we've do it many time before but i mean literally you know
S0482	give you an advantage
S0483	somebody could undercut us by many tens of thousand you know it's
S0482	how much do you do you know how much
S0483	i can't remember cos they haven't pay us for last year but you know it's it's a it's a good deal
S0482	when do you get the money
S0483	neh dunno
S0482	yeah i'm say it's a good deal when you get the money
S0483	yeah when you get the money yeah i think it's about a quarter of a million i dunno erm
S0482	sound like quite it sound like quite a lot for the small team
S0483	yeah yeah well anyway erm so yeah
S0482	i mean that's the sort of grant we should be apply for
S0483	but you know doesn't doesn't change anything other than it mean that it's quite likely that we're gonna be do all this work for nothing but erm you know what can you do i just seem to be get you know rig into just endless email and you you know when you just sort of my boss be just say you know
S0483	we're just on the same carousel you know like the same email come around you know every couple of years you know someone ask the same stupid question that you've already think you'd sort you know
S0482	oh yeah yeah
S0483	you think you'd finally put it to bed like you know stuff about disabilities and
S0482	yeah
S0483	you know
S0482	it's almost like you wanna point to the frequent you need a frequently ask question
S0483	yeah yeah my own frequently ask question chart
S0482	it's such a yeah i'll refer you to this yeah before you email me
S0483	mm
S0482	look through these frequently ask question
S0483	i i you know
S0482	you know there's just it
S0483	i could deal with a lot of my like that
S0482	something along those line
S0483	yeah
S0482	so not actually the craziest of ideas
S0483	no
S0482	come up with a good idea me and my hairdresser well you know
S0482	come up with a good idea which be pay as you go haircuts
S0483	yeah
S0482	so it we think you could like cos he cos when he give me a tissue i say oh can i take a tissue when i arrive he say erm oh it'll be five p that carry on
S0482	i say and he go well no actually it'll be ten p they're two ply and i say well they're man size it's gotta be twenty p
S0482	and then we carry on this er this throughout and say you know you could you could like have you know sort of erm you know conversation
S0482	it could be a pound
S0483	yeah i suppose yeah
S0482	you could have you know the clippers
S0483	yeah yeah
S0482	that could be another pound as oppose to scissor
S0483	yeah yeah yeah
S0482	you know
S0483	i think i think scissor should be cost more expense than clippers cos clippers be erm
S0482	bike park well
S0483	it it's easier isn't it you know it's
S0482	yeah but it's quicker
S0483	yeah but you know
S0482	anyway
S0483	clippers be quicker
S0482	bag storage coat storage bike park
S0483	that's take it a little far
S0482	yeah but we're run out of ideas
S0483	yeah aren't you it's a good job you actually need a short haircut i'd be in there three and a half hours come up with ideas my hair
S0482	i think i might've insult him slightly as well
S0483	oh no
S0482	well i don't know no no it i'm only joke not really but cos er i i say oh i'm gonna have a bite shorter than usual and erm i say so you know cos i want people to actually like see that i've have a haircut
S0482	though though actually that sound a bite rude
S0483	no that's not rude no it's fine
S0482	but then it get me think i think who be you get your hair cut for and actually you're get your hair cut for other people not for yourself
S0483	yeah exactly cos you can't see
S0482	because if if people couldn't see you
S0483	yeah
S0482	you just wouldn't care
S0483	no
S0482	and if you couldn't see your own hair why would you care
S0483	yeah no exactly
S0482	it wouldn't affect how you felt about yourself cos you wouldn't that's it so
S0483	yeah this be why i don't brush it
S0482	well yeah
S0482	so if you don't care about anyone else
S0483	yeah
S0482	you're probably someone with really unkempt hair
S0482	that's it there you go
S0483	yeah yeah no absolutely yeah i mean you know
S0482	but you know
S0483	i frequently get to work look in the mirror and think oh probably should've brush my hair this week
S0482	like if i see
S0483	and sometimes i do it at work cos i've get a hairbrush at work for these such occasion but then you know
S0482	yeah
S0483	i i mean it doesn't matter what's go on the back of your hair as well i mean you could have some sort of piggish rat tail go by the back you wouldn't know
S0482	yeah that's true
S0483	everyone else
S0482	maybe that's why
S0483	everyone else'd be repulse but i mean you know that's why i don't care what the back of my hair's do could be a big tangly knotty mess don't know can't see it
S0482	yeah yeah that's it if you if you catch sight of your hair like if you go to the toilet and then you look in the mirror
S0483	yeah
S0482	then you do something about it but i don't go to the bathroom to look at my hair
S0483	no
S0482	not usually
S0482	unless i've just have a haircut and i feel like i've get like haircut hair
S0483	yeah it look nice this time no it's it's it's good
S0482	yeah it's get nothing it's get nothing in it so it's au naturel
S0483	yeah cos the side you know do tuft out though don't they
S0482	yeah i know
S0483	maybe you should've get your side shorter
S0482	well i i it's easily do
S0483	yeah
S0482	by razor
S0483	no not those not your beard like these side like here
S0482	oh i see yeah i do it on the six which be what i usually do
S0483	yeah i be i think you should maybe go four
S0482	maybe a bite shorter
S0483	well i mean why don't why don't you do it
S0482	four's a bite short
S0483	all i'm say be why don't you do it before you go on holiday cos you're clearly worry about how you're gonna look for the people at work so if you do it before you be go off grid for a while
S0482	the other
S0483	you have it do at a four
S0482	yeah
S0483	then you know two weeks you'd be a six so you know
S0482	there you go that's question for google isn't it
S0483	yeah
S0482	how long do it take to go from a four to a six
S0483	depend on your hair growth and how fast it go
S0482	yeah yeah oh clever clog i also realise that
S0482	you know i mean this be an obvious one but hairdressers have a
S0483	mm
S0482	conflict of interest when it come to do what you ask them to
S0482	cos if you ask for something really short
S0483	yeah
S0482	but you're likely to come back with the same length of hair as you've get when you be there
S0482	then erm
S0483	yeah maybe
S0482	it's their in their interest to not do it as short as you want it maybe
S0483	mm yes
S0482	so that you come back sooner unless you like come every on the monday of the first monday of every month
S0483	some people do yeah but i mean some people do do it really some people be very
S0482	but i suspect a lot of men do it basically on the point which they realise that they have to go and get their hair cut
S0483	i don't know i think a lot of i think a lot of blokes do do it once a month or whatever you know
S0482	and then that get me think
S0482	i bet you hairdressers don't know actually what why what trigger people to go and get their hair cut
S0482	so maybe they you can't can't tell
S0483	i think they don't care
S0482	no but they should care
S0482	because if it be base on look then they're better off not go as short as people ask so i remember when i once go into toni and guy's
S0483	mm
S0482	and pay a lot of money for a very stupid look haircut
S0483	yeah
S0482	which annoy me they'd barely cut my hair they'd style it they hadn't cut it and i hadn't realise you
S0483	yeah
S0482	they i think you just get a you know i make the mistake of go to a hairdresser's salon when i should've go to a barber erm but of course in that case you're gonna come back all the time cos they barely even cut your hair just trim it
S0482	be that
S0483	yeah yeah
S0482	sound alright
S0483	sound alright
S0482	basically i don't think hairdressers be look into their clientele enough they should learn a bite more about them
S0483	maybe
S0482	they could you know i have it figure if they if they reduce the shortness of their cut by about twenty percent
S0483	yeah
S0482	they could you know why shouldn't that increase revenue by twenty percent or or close to that if a lot of people go to get their hair cut base on the length of their hair rather than like every the first monday of every month
S0483	i'm think to myself that this be a two espresso record
S0482	what
S0483	as in that's how many you'd need to keep yourself awake while type this up
S0482	some people might appreciate my er muse on fix other you know er
S0483	er hair
S0482	improve and optimise other business model
S0483	well that's it yeah other recordings'll be toenail clippings
S0482	no we've get nothing to say about that
S0483	no
S0482	no
S0483	just hairdressing
S0482	yeah and okay here's another here's a business idea
S0483	oh oh
S0482	so load of young people
S0482	i'm gonna sound old but okay people who be
S0482	still at at college school university who ride to school college university on their bike
S0483	mm
S0482	in the winter they've so often
S0483	mm
S0482	not get gloves on and i have ask a few at traffic light think maybe they just feel the cold
S0483	yeah
S0482	and no they do
S0483	yeah
S0482	cos they've get freeze hand they just
S0483	yeah
S0482	aren't they're not good at plan
S0483	okay so what's the business idea you're gonna be a a glove seller
S0482	ahead sell gloves at at traffic light
S0483	at traffic light oh god that's a really good idea
S0482	it be
S0483	that's a really good idea
S0482	yeah
S0483	yeah
S0482	cos they're literally i remember stand by this guy and this guy be like like rub his hand and i say your your hand be cold aren't they and he go they're freeze i wish i have some gloves and i just think there you go he this guy's gonna pay some money
S0483	yeah
S0482	to have warm hand for the day
S0483	yeah you're right
S0482	not that i wanna like extort
S0483	no
S0482	take advantage of younger people but
S0483	no
S0482	you know
S0483	just young people so what i you know you know when it be really really cold last week
S0482	you can don't have to mm
S0483	somebody that i work with cycle in in short his legs look like they be dead
S0482	really
S0483	they're the most weird colour i've ever see on a live person they be blue
S0482	cos some get away with wear short to till till zero
S0483	he he look awful
S0482	pretty much
S0483	he i think it be minus something and he look awful
S0483	i've never see such a horrific colour on on flesh
S0482	really
S0483	yeah
S0482	he obviously wasn't cycle fast enough
S0483	if he'd've be lay down i'd've say he be dead
S0482	be like a proper be he like on a road bike or
S0483	no no he be you know
S0482	pootling along
S0483	no no no no i mean he yeah i work with the guy i dunno he look to be about fifty
S0482	do he have a cup that say five things i like
S0483	no i i don't know i don't think he's you know he's not like super cycle man or whatever but you know yeah he wear short his legs look incredibly painful couldn't've be good for him
S0482	mm no we've get er there's a guy well our it guy in our unit he's a really nice guy he erm he wear short all the time and sandals of course
S0483	do he cycle
S0482	yeah
S0483	in short and sandals even in the winter
S0482	i think so yeah i don't know i i not sure about that but he turn up to his interview in short and sandals
S0483	i know he do
S0482	you know he do
S0483	yeah you tell me that before
S0482	oh do i oh okay
S0483	yeah be you interview him
S0482	no
S0483	how do you know
S0482	cos
S0483	just a
S0482	that's the sort of thing that go round
S0482	oh the guy you find out about new appointees
S0483	he must be good he must know it
S0482	yeah no no actually it's probably it's the probably the a safe thing to do actually you know it's people who wear who look smart in it who don't fit in
S0483	yeah
S0482	who clearly aren't techies
S0483	yeah true
S0482	erm
S0483	or you need a black hoodie
S0482	mm yeah
S0482	you do my computer scientist erm colleague person who be who be who really help us out she's be do a lot of analysis today this be her wednesday off bless her
S0482	erm and er yeah but it's turn out we've lose a lot of data
S0483	oh
S0482	which be a real pain basically i figure there be possibly a paper in some of the quite unique data we have but they don't have anything up until the crash
S0483	mm
S0482	only post crash data which be a real pain i mean we've get all the other data apparently
S0483	be there some people that join after the crash or something
S0482	yeah yeah yeah there there be so we still have some data and we've still get data from the first study
S0483	yeah just yeah
S0482	which be safe but it's just a real shame cos also it mean that there'll be incomplete data for some people so it's just you know it's just it's amateurish isn't it
S0483	yeah
S0482	i i don't i really don't understand what be happen why things weren't back up
S0483	i'd say somebody scupper you
S0482	well the the disk on the the server break completely but that should be should be er er independent backup
S0483	well i dunno i think it be sabotage
S0482	mm i don't think it be sabotage
S0483	could've be though i think it be sabotage
S0482	you sound a bite chesty
S0483	mm yeah i'm alright every time i get on the bike in the you know in the outdoors i can feel a bite of a sore throat but i'm generally alright i imagine it's go to descend when i've get things to do at the weekend
S0482	oh yeah you'll get my cold then
S0483	yeah probably
S0482	then you'll know although you've get the right chromosomes for not
S0483	not make a fuss
S0482	not have a not have it full blow
S0483	i will just strap a tissue to my nose and get on with it
S0482	you know if your er if your xy you get you get the full blow you only get half of it cos you well i don't understand the i don't understand the genetics of it
S0482	of course but er yeah
S0482	you xx people be lucky
S0483	mm mm
S0482	pretty bad though
S0482	i when i be out there talk to erm you know the sort of one how you know he say how you do how you do and i say and and for a second you sort of think oh yeah bite of a cold and i think no better not cos the guy
