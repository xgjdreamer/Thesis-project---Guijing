S0084	kidney stone
S0041	that's the truth
S0084	after the christmas party yeah
S0041	a private shindig
S0084	yeah that's why i've be have hot water and lemon every morning before work cos it's suppose to flush out your kidneys so i have it an hour before eat i think that's why i take cereal to work so i have that at seven thirty and then i have my cereal well whenever i feel like anyway sorry if i'm rude but i keep forget i'm suppose to be record my fecking conversations right alex be mental
S0041	yeah no he's actually nut
S0084	yeah
S0041	he's actually crazy so
S0084	okay
S0041	we're drive to and i realise this be now a one way conversation that he's talk out to me
S0084	be that cos you're hang over or you just haven't have a chance to get any word in
S0041	yeah well or if i put word in you know i'm like i try and i'm not very good at the the touchy feel conversations
S0084	mm
S0041	so he's say to me that she you know she's be on her on own for single for so long that she didn't eh she just want her independence back and he say you know we've just be see each other for twenty weeks i think so you work out exact pinpoint twenty weeks like not a few months
S0084	twenty weeks when do he split up with
S0041	no sorry i'm on about
S0084	oh
S0084	i think this be the one in right okay
S0041	no right
S0084	him and they've see each other for twenty weeks
S0041	what a strange way to quantify it
S0084	who say that
S0041	i know
S0084	wouldn't you just say four months or five months or whatever it be
S0041	yeah no anyway
S0084	twenty weeks
S0041	which i think be weird in the first place
S0084	like check off on the calendar with red cross
S0041	exactly exactly
S0084	mm okay
S0041	em so i be like hmm that's a bite weird
S0084	so she want her independence
S0041	anyway so she want her independence back em and they be just you know see each other and have fun and you know it do seem to start to open up as if it be go to go somewhere and
S0084	mm
S0041	then she's run a mile and he say really i i just i think to myself if her heart's not in it then there's no point you know what will be will be
S0084	mm
S0041	and so really it be kind of mutual it wasn't at all cos the conversation prior to that when he explain that she say it be all basically all her do
S0084	mm
S0041	he's then try to convince himself that he can have some say in this
S0084	okay
S0041	which be really weird and then he start he say you know she she just she's get so many things that she want to do as if be now now now the way he's talk about her
S0084	mm
S0041	be as if she's this amaze fantastic person
S0084	mm
S0041	but they're just drift apart and i say oh oh right em you know what type of stuff do she want to do you know
S0084	mm
S0041	try and ask it about you know find out a bite about her try and put myself in his position a bite
S0084	mm
S0041	em you know well she just you know she want to you know she want to travel and you know and she's do the hairdresser thing and now she's do the premier inn thing and
S0084	the what

S0041	and that's the big dream
S0084	that's the live live live the dream
S0041	as the hairdressing be the big dream
S0084	okay
S0041	and so i wasn't quite follow and then i
S0084	so she be a hairdresser for
S0041	maybe this be me be a snob right i don't know
S0084	yeah
S0041	but she's like yeah now she's do the premier inn thing and you know and i think maybe a year from now you know she probably you know she might even work abroad i mean she's already move out of

S0041	it get better it get so much better
S0084	go on then
S0041	and then he say you know and she say to me you know you've do the whole travel thing you know you you go out there you know you go to new zealand and i haven't have that
S0084	yeah
S0041	it's the way
S0084	yeah but
S0041	he didn't go travel he go on a three week holiday yeah and i just think oh jesus like i want to i want to be empathetic
S0084	yeah
S0041	but i'm just think what the fuck be these people for real
S0084	yeah no
S0041	i i just really can't get on board with people that be like that i can't i just can't understand it
S0084	bless them they live in a very small world
S0041	really small
S0084	though don't they
S0041	really small
S0084	mm you know when you go back for a visit it's all very lovely you know you go to the village and you think oh nothing's change all the same people you know it's lovely and you can just pretend that it's all sort of the same and it's em you know comfort
S0041	yeah comfort yeah
S0084	but then you leave
S0041	that's it
S0084	and you go and do your other life
S0041	your real life
S0084	you go and you know you're ambitious and do a job and you look at where you're go not not for them
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know they're just go to go to the pub everyday and see the same people every day
S0041	yes exactamundo
S0084	their aspirations be move from a two bedroomed house in to a three bedroomed house in maybe off the high street like you know
S0041	that's it i've never know people like that
S0084	mm
S0041	i've never like
S0084	quite a village mentality isn't it
S0041	yeah and it just really shock me
S0084	oh bless him i suppose like it doesn't worry me if that's what make people happy
S0041	yeah
S0084	if it but it you know if he be i mean it's difficult to say whether he sound unhappy cos it sound like he's live in denial a little bite which probably mean he be kind of a bite unhappy
S0041	he say well you know i just don't want to lose a friend over it
S0084	mm
S0041	and i be like well to be honest i think i'm come to the realization that perhaps you can't be friends with an ex
S0084	not immediately
S0041	you know and he say yeah we've get the same circle of friends we're always go to be bump in to each other so hope we can be civil i say i'm sure you will at some point don't worry about it now
S0084	mm
S0041	and he say you know well just i'm have a realisation and just the clarity i really know what i want now and i be like oh right yeah so what you know what you think not em move somewhere or travel somewhere or get a better job or improve his own job
S0084	mm
S0041	no eh a girl
S0084	mm
S0041	i be like oh okay em
S0084	so where do she come from
S0041	they've know each other for years eh i think it be his ex girlfriends they meet somehow through break up with people
S0084	as you do
S0041	yeah really kind of weird ash ish situation
S0084	where everyone know each other
S0041	yes
S0084	and everyone's cheat on each other
S0041	yes and then she basically get screw up screw over by this guy
S0084	yeah
S0041	and alex get to know about her better he spend a lot of time with her and basically for three years they kind of push boundaries quite a lot and he say you know i just this be what i want and i don't want to rush into it i think yeah cos he sleep with her
S0084	and you leave her in bed which you just declare in the kitchen earlier
S0041	yeah and he be like you know we both you know we both you know our last serious partner be both younger than us and you know we've both be screw over you know these people come back into our live and we welcome them with open arm we get shit in again and we just both have be through very similar things i just think you know i think you know it might be something so and i'm think be there only me that's sit in the world right now scream at people have you all go fuck mad
S0084	well yeah i think it's the begin of the year because think in january and february everyone say fuck i'm single i've have enough of be single i know i'll just throw myself at the nearest nut job and hope for the best
S0041	yeah
S0084	the two quite damage mental people think do you know what would be a brilliant idea let's get into a relationship together and be mental together
S0041	together yeah
S0084	at least they're not afflict it on anybody else but surely that's just gonna end in disaster cos they're just gonna be more and more mental together so
S0041	i know
S0041	hi
S0084	hi anna
S0041	no no
S0084	be we in your way no come in
S0041	we can retire to the boudoir
S0084	yes em
S0041	well what
S0084	and when really what they actually have to do be think i i just need to be single for a little while
S0084	i know i know i just
S0041	but surely
S0084	it's actual nuttiness
S0041	it's the same thing with that isn't it she just need to be single sound like she's just lurch from one disaster to another
S0084	yeah i know
S0041	in actual fact be in a relationship do you more damage oh well that's not as tidy as i want it to be
S0084	well you've do well though consider when i poke my head in this morning i mean it really be em it's really not that bad
S0041	urgh
S0084	it's nice and warm though
S0041	nice yeah it's i just the whole whole thing's oh dear
S0084	what be that
S0041	what be this on my head
S0084	where do this grow from oh come round earlier and i say about the shower and she say well last week i get a message say it be cold so come in and turn it up and well what can i do i have to get him to take the regulator out of the shower cos you say it be cold i be like hang on a
S0041	she take the regulator of the shower
S0084	yeah and the the it's fuck boil and i say well mine be okay but it get hot by the time anna who have the next shower come in it be too hot and then have to shower and say she have to keep get out of it and say well you know let me know on sunday but she wouldn't even really talk to me so that be quite interest she be only really talk to and she say to text me on sunday
S0041	i think it's because she know that with she get somewhere like
S0084	yeah
S0041	she doesn't have to be very committal she doesn't have to say much
S0084	mm
S0041	will just let her get away with stuff
S0084	basically yeah it's because i'm i just tell her how it be like no you're not get more rent from me these be days you will get rent from me this be what we agree do not be mental what be in that bag you run away to sea
S0041	yeah
S0084	be this you join the navy now
S0041	yeah this be it
S0084	all in the bag
S0041	eh this be my swim stuff actually i really can't be bother to pack my bag now i think i'm go to do it tomorrow
S0084	yeah
S0041	which i always do this and then in the morning in the morning i think why the fuck do you do that why didn't you just pack your bag maybe i'll just put my clothe in it
S0084	oh could you just why don't you just make a pile make it like throw things here not throw them like fold the clothe that you want to take and then at least it's all out on the side and then you can just you know scoop and place in the bag
S0041	em i really want to wear these
S0084	be ah
S0041	it's just not the weather yet
S0084	not yet soon no yes tuesday be go to be fourteen degrees it's gonna be a heat wave so em maybe you can wear them to work
S0041	yes
S0084	i think they're probably appropriate
S0041	yes i can definitely do that
S0084	yeah darling can't stop yawn today
S0041	yeah i tell about the message that i send to and be like yes she's like that's great what else can we do do you know what if you've be on her facebook she'll have be on yours i say but she can't see mine cos it's private
S0084	oh right
S0041	she just be on to the profile picture
S0084	mm
S0041	she's like so what you need to do be take photograph put them on facebook put them in profile picture you and
S0041	so i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it
S0084	ah
S0041	she basically the through through all this crapple apple she just say i i just don't it just make me really sad he would behave that way cos she know him quite well
S0084	who do eve
S0041	yeah em and she just say i just don't understand it and it's be just a tosser the way he's go about things
S0084	i think that blokes be like that though like when you're in a relationship with them they're nothing but as sweet as pie and then as soon as it's over they're like right well i can just be totally selfish which in their head mean act like a twat which be unfortunate i mean not all blokes let's not all generalise but i think in his head he's like right well that's it now you tell me that i'm single and that i just that you don't want to be with me anymore and so i can just do what i like
S0084	this be not appropriate dinner wear be it
S0041	the sex top have you get a blouse like em a vest top that you could wear underneath it or do it not really go with a vest top
S0084	i don't it doesn't really go but i'm go to take it just in case it's definitely not dinner wear i can't wear that to go out for a meal can i
S0041	no you can't i mean unless you don't take the eh the jacket off but you might wear something really warm
S0084	yeah
S0041	so that's a bite that's a bite dangerous
S0084	i'll take the sex top and maybe i'll put the sex top on
S0041	mm
S0084	and wander round the room in it a little while and then say do you know what i can't i really can't wear this to dinner i'm go to put my other top on
S0041	yeah fine
S0084	just so then he can see the sex top but i just won't wear the sex top out
S0041	yeah
S0084	that's fine
S0041	i like it as a plan
S0084	it's a definite plan
S0041	so wear the wear the leather cos that that's the even outfit the leather trousers i'm go to have to have take in
S0084	really how excite
S0041	yeah but i'm keep them i love them
S0084	well obviously yeah so fourteen be too big now
S0041	yeah
S0084	winner
S0041	i mean i think it's just the trousers i think obviously i don't know
S0084	can you wash them though
S0041	maybe as i've wear them
S0084	boil wash
S0041	you can't wash them
S0084	oh
S0041	wipe clean only i think all it would all it need be just the dart
S0084	mm
S0041	do a little but deeper cos they're not very deep at all
S0084	no it's quite an easy job there's a woman at the market who do em tailor
S0041	yeah she could perhaps just take them they're not they're really not very much too much big it's literally just the waist band
S0084	mm
S0041	they're fine everywhere
S0084	mm
S0041	but the waistband they they slip down
S0084	mm
S0041	as i walk and i think i think because my legs just aren't fat enough to keep them tight to here so
S0084	mm
S0041	they slide down my thighs then my thighs then pull it down from the waist so
S0084	yeah no you you just don't want to feel uncomfortable in them
S0041	yeah i don't know i don't know what the best thing to do would be whether perhaps it might be better for her to take them in on the leg rather than the waist cos the last thing you want be muffin top bulge
S0084	well that's not gonna happen cos you're gonna just gonna get smaller so but it's probably worth do the leg and waist while she's there
S0041	yeah maybe
S0084	i mean it's difficult isn't it cos you kinda want her to do it not so you can wear them now but you're just if you're gonna get skinnier again you'll have to do it again
S0041	mm
S0084	i mean can you put up with it for now
S0041	i think so
S0084	i would wait
S0041	they didn't annoy me too much last night em i just have to it sound ridiculous but i just have to make sure that this be on my skin and not on my underwear
S0084	mm
S0041	cos against skin it tend to to go less
S0084	yeah it stick a bite doesn't it
S0041	yeah so cos they're they're just quite straight do you see what i mean
S0084	mm mm
S0041	like they're not they're not large
S0084	mm
S0041	they're they're not a small pair of trousers it's not like they're ridiculously too small they're just very straight so they
S0084	mm
S0041	they should really go in at the waist to kind of hug on a bite
S0084	yeah pick up well i'd just wait a few weeks like if you can put up with it for now and then eh
S0041	yeah maybe
S0084	see how you go see how you go with the old not eat
S0041	we'll see how we go with that
S0084	yeah be you go to see the gp this week make an appointment i be go to send you that link actually get to dig that out the nutritionist link
S0041	yeah i i don't really know what to do cos i just i just feel like i'm be stupid
S0084	you're not though be you i mean you be eat quite healthily generally speak you're not eat an awful lot i mean what it could be be you need to be eat more of smaller things
S0041	mm
S0084	to boost your metabolism
S0041	yeah more often
S0084	yeah you need to just sort of reverse what you're do
S0041	sexy little top sexy little top
S0084	so what be you go to wear down there tomorrow

S0041	like it's a really young dress
S0084	it be a young dress yeah
S0041	and i haven't em i haven't try it on lately like i haven't have it on since i graduate and really i think i'm too old to wear this type of dress now do you know what i mean it's a very young print isn't it
S0084	the pattern on it be very young yeah but i mean it's
S0041	it's a very young print
S0084	it's the sort of thing you don't want to get rid of because it's you know because of the memories attach to it
S0041	mm
S0084	there's nothing to say that you have to get rid of it i mean your wardrobe be pretty bare
S0041	summer tea party i could wear it to a summer tea party
S0084	you could wear it to a tea party yeah
S0041	yeah
S0084	you'd have a tea party
S0041	we could do that
S0084	we can have a tea party go punt
S0041	we can have a tea party i think i could wear this to a summer tea party
S0084	well to be honest i be look at photos from last april maz come over from berlin and she stay for the weekend and it be so hot it be about thirty degrees and we go on a punt down to grantchester and it be so hot we have a barbeque in the back garden and it be the day before easter sunday it be easter saturday so it be the second of april and it be yeah it be like twenty seven thirty degrees
S0041	so i might even be able to wear it
S0084	so for your birthday we might even be able to have a tea party
S0041	that would be awesome i would love to have a tea party for my birthday
S0084	you could have like a mad hatter's tea party you could be alice
S0041	that would be my favouritist thing ever
S0084	it would be pretty fun
S0041	alice would probably wear something like this yeah
S0084	i think she would wear exactly like that
S0041	alice in wonderland be my favourite disney film ever
S0084	be it
S0041	yep i love i love the mad hatter's tea party i play the mad hatter once in a play it be great
S0084	mm
S0041	that would be my favourite birthday ever i be actually go to make it my wed
S0084	we might have to
S0041	not just a tea party
S0084	yeah no i know a few hens that have do it as a hen in fact actually my friend this week have go to a mad hatter's tea party and she's go as the mock turtle you know in the story the book
S0041	yeah
S0084	as oppose to the film they've get mock turtle and she get some paper plat and paint them green and a couple of years ago we have a christmas party at work and she be go as robin hood because she buy a beautiful green dress and say right what can i wear it to fancy dress party em then we go in as robin hood really foxy robin hood so she wear this really sort of slinky green dress and she make a little felt hat and she have like a little toy bow and arrow and she's gonna wear the green dress and just like assemble the paper plat on her front and back
S0041	yeah
S0084	so she look like a turtle then obviously when they go so then they go out in the afternoon and have the tea party and she can be the turtle and then when they go out for dinner she can just pull that off
S0041	oh
S0084	and then she's look hot to trot
S0041	ah that be a good plan
S0084	it's quite good mm quite cheap as well not have to buy costume all the time
S0041	oh yeah
S0084	but that hen party cost ninety pound just for the day and the even
S0041	what be people do
S0084	i don't know and then she cos she say it's up in do she say chester so the petrol it's go to take her four hours to get there em
S0041	oh
S0084	and then and that wasn't even include the dinner
S0041	that's a lot of money
S0084	or be it include dinner i can't remember mad i think i might actually boycott hen party from now one
S0041	yeah
S0084	now i've start a precedent now i think i might carry on
S0041	that's that be extreme
S0084	well i mean i think barcelona be pretty bad yeah i mean really you just i don't wanna have to spend more than thirty forty quid realistically cos you're gonna go out aren't you and spend money on dinner and drink yeah it's the have to travel to place isn't it that's the problem
S0041	you just remind me of something then oh michelle's wed dress be absolutely beautiful
S0084	oh be it
S0041	absolutely beautiful em but i didn't realise until the reception it be a plain white dress the wed dress on top of my wardrobe
S0084	mm
S0041	be actually more like a wed dress than her wed dress
S0084	mm
S0041	it be completely plain literally bust top
S0084	mm
S0041	straight down and ivory white do
S0084	wow
S0041	nothing else no detail no oh there be a a lace back that be white
S0084	right
S0041	like a the basque bite
S0084	mm
S0041	but she have this em thing make and it be like a completely here down to the floor a train it be like an overcoat idea
S0084	oh okay
S0041	but it be completely sheer
S0084	oh
S0041	with like load of embroidery all over it all the way round the edge cover cover cover in embroidery
S0084	wow
S0041	a bite like you know the royal wed she use a bite of embroidery
S0084	mm hm
S0041	it be like that but all down her arm
S0084	wow
S0041	all down her arm to here and it didn't look grannyish at all it look lovely
S0084	oh my god
S0041	yeah
S0084	it sound nice so she have it make do she
S0041	yeah
S0084	cor that'd be expensive
S0041	i want i mean to ask actually em what size she think michelle be which i know be not a very nice thing to say about a bride but she's she's quite i think she's my size which be what i want to ask i think i've find someone
S0084	mm
S0041	that's probably about my build cos she you know it's always easier to see in somebody else isn't it
S0084	mm
S0041	like she's quite she's a bite chubby but she's not you wouldn't look at her and go god she's big
S0084	mm
S0041	she's just a bigger person generally
S0084	mm mm
S0041	and she she wasn't suit to what she be wear at all like once she take the em the the cover thing off
S0084	mm
S0041	no
S0084	oh really that that that's what make it
S0041	yeah
S0084	oh
S0041	really make it em which be a bite of a shame but she be happy
S0084	yeah i can't em i can't imagine dress at all she try to describe it to me cos she's a bite of a hippy and she's quite arty she try to describe this dress she say it be do she say it be lemon
S0041	lemon
S0084	basically yeah it's like a sort of yellowy colour as oppose to white
S0041	i feel a bite naked
S0084	yeah
S0041	do i look naked i'm butt naked aren't i can't really wear this
S0084	you be quite naked
S0041	mm
S0084	but yeah it's not a traditional wed dress by any mean but i'm quite look forward to it well you'll get to see it if you still want to come
S0041	yeah i do
S0084	we'll have to talk about it on tuesday when you get pay
S0041	yes i do
S0084	we'll just sit down and work out logistics really but we could do it together because she's say that we have to fly realistically we should fly into belfast city rather than belfast international cos it's so much easier to go to the hotel where we can get change and then
S0041	mm
S0084	find our way to the wed but in that case we can't fly from stanstead and we might have to fly from gatwick
S0041	these match don't they perfectly
S0084	beautifully but em that's fine cos what we could do be stay with my friend chrissy in brixton on the thursday night and then fly out on the friday morning from gatwick
S0041	right yeah
S0084	cos i'm sure she'll be fine with that she's get space cos we'll just kip on the floor it'll probably mean get the tube at some sort of ridiculous hour
S0041	stupid o'clock
S0084	yeah
S0041	my favourite time of the morning stupid o'clock
S0084	mm but it's stupid o'clock from london or stupid o'clock from cambridge so
S0041	yep
S0084	we're probably better off in brixton
S0041	i think that's as far as my pack effort go i think
S0084	it's pretty good i mean realistically tomorrow morning you have to wash yourself and put your toiletries in a bag
S0041	yeah
S0084	which be doable so what bag be you go to take you can take your swim bag
S0041	mm cos i be gonna take my little excuse me suitcase but my little one's go to be a little bite too small
S0084	mm
S0041	and that one's go to be to big and that one's just easy to carry
S0084	yeah if you don't ram it full of stuff
S0041	yeah it's not go to weigh anything
S0084	mm
S0041	and i don't want to have to carry it
S0084	mm
S0041	i really don't know how i feel about this now now it's come to it
S0084	get nervous
S0041	i'm not nervous i just don't especially because of the say situ and moods i'm just i don't want to i don't want to react to something badly
S0084	mm
S0041	do you know what i mean
S0084	mm
S0041	i don't think i will but on the phone i felt i felt the same feel that i'm scar be gonna happen cos basically he when i be on the phone to him about what we would do em he and he tell me what he be get for me for my birthday
S0084	mm
S0041	em which by the way you may you may want in
S0084	what do you mean
S0041	you may want in i find out for my birthday
S0084	mm
S0041	em there's an exhibition at the design museum louboutin
S0084	mm
S0041	a retrospective exhibition
S0084	mm
S0041	of all the shoe
S0084	right
S0041	and all the like design influence of the shoe
S0084	mm
S0041	em and picture and all sort of stuff
S0084	mm
S0041	and it's the first one that they've ever do and he's get me two ticket to go
S0084	oh wow that sound really fun
S0041	i know so that's fun and he say i've just get to choose a date in may or june
S0084	mm
S0041	unless i want i wouldn't really want to go in may cos i'm gonna go to eh i might be go to a wed with liz so
S0084	mm
S0041	the extra money i have that month will go for that
S0084	mm
S0041	and he be like okay well just let me know when you're free and i say okay em
S0084	but but be do he mean that he would take you though be that not what he mean
S0041	well yeah well he be kinda skirt around it so he doesn't obviously doesn't really want to go to the
S0084	shoe
S0041	the shoe bite
S0084	mm
S0041	so he be like so you might you know you might want to take someone else if i get you two ticket then perhaps take the one that's just go to enjoy that bite
S0084	mm
S0041	but you know and i'll go in something else and meet you afterwards
S0084	mm
S0041	which be fine
S0084	yeah
S0041	em
S0084	so what you do would you go down for the day do you think
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	mm
S0041	but it be like and he just think that would be nice cos that you know obviously cos i won't see you on your birthday
S0084	mm
S0041	and i say oh right why won't you
S0084	mm
S0041	and he be like em well you know cos i say oh no i've get to keep free on the twenty eighth the more i think about it i think i might have do that
S0084	right
S0041	i think i think i say keep free
S0084	right
S0041	for the weekend before and the weekend after cos i remember say to him that what about go to nottingham
S0084	mm
S0041	and i say if we do that it'll prob it'll be a girls'
S0084	weekend
S0041	holiday yeah em but you know keep one or the other free cos whichever one we don't go for i'll we'll do something together so actually out of all my nitpick of that i think i might have actually the person that say keep free
S0084	but then he hasn't write it on the calendar he hasn't write like keep free say keep free so now he have no idea why he's keep it free
S0041	yeah and he's not ask which be ridiculous
S0084	he's still not ask her
S0041	no
S0084	that's a bite weird
S0041	yeah i don't really understand what's go on with them like i don't know but anyway he say you know cos i've say i've get on the calendar keep free and you say it's not you so
S0084	mm
S0041	i don't know i just be i be stupid cos i kind of think i think to myself like i have a real sink feel cos i kind of think even if even if it be that ask you to keep it free i can't believe that you would keep both those weekend as weekend for her that be both around my birthday and not think to say like actually it's birthday that week she she might want me to do something at at one of those so can we just have one that's a keep free do you know what i mean
S0084	yeah yeah yeah well to be he might have do he might have think that and now he just can't remember i think he might have do it a while ago if it be that actually be the one who say keep it free cos it could well be that it be you and it actually there's no need to get too worry about it cos it be you in in the first place
S0041	mm
S0084	but yeah i mean if if he do if he's just completely block out the rest of the next nine months to see bear in mind that you'll probably be go within nine months it's a bite of a kicker
S0041	innit
S0084	but then it's all suppose to be that way isn't it like typically you don't stay this close with your ex boyfriend or girlfriends so you don't say
S0041	yeah but it's birthday time
S0084	yeah but then if you're see somebody else like you you don't know what you might be do in april like you might be see somebody he might be more serious with like you might have a a you know a group of people out that night say if we go on a girlie thing and he would definitely come and you and he would definitely be invite and you definitely would see each other but like to actually just spend time just one on one cos i've get nothing to compare it to so to me it seem a bite a little but strange but maybe it's not maybe it's completely normal just like it would be normal if you be all like best mat and you have never actually be in a relationship together
S0041	yeah
S0084	like if you be just best mat maybe you would just hang out just the two of you but give that you've get history for anybody new that's come in it's hard like it would be hard to break in to that relationship that you have the two of you like whatever it be now
S0041	yeah whatever it be
S0084	whatever be go on it's hard for anybody new i'm obviously not that my sympathies lie with her at all but and i don't think he's handle the situation at all well but you know this be the first time both of you have do this so you be gonna sort of it be a bite of a learn curve
S0041	and he say em and you know you know i haven't be invite to anything so and then he try to have a dig at me as it be my fault
S0084	good job you say it be a girlie thing
S0041	yeah and that we'd do something else i don't know i just think it be really weird really odd
S0084	mm he be a bite of a strange one isn't he
S0041	yeah and i you know that awful kind of sink feel i don't i really don't want anything else to come up this weekend that give me that kind of oh
S0084	it hurt
S0041	yeah cos i don't want to i don't want to react do you know what i mean
S0084	mm mm mm well yeah
S0041	i just want it to go smoothly without a hitch and then
S0084	walk away
S0041	have some nice photograph it'll be a nice memory and then if if actually that's it then
S0084	well i don't you know i don't think it need to be it you just need to you know at the end of this weekend just give yourself some space and that's what you'd already you've already lay that groundwork with you've already say that's what you need so it shouldn't come as a shock to him
S0041	no
S0084	so yeah all be well you know you'll have a nice time and then you'll just come back and it'll be as it be this week you know not actually see each other all the time and try and keep a bite of distance
S0041	yeah but before say space i want to leave i don't want to leave with a nasty taste do you know what i mean
S0084	mm yeah of course
S0041	so
S0084	well this be what we be say though like if something do come up it's gonna really hurt and it's gonna make you feel sick and you're not go to enjoy it
S0041	yeah i know
S0084	but you go it to this with your eye open didn't you like i remember you say like you want to do this because you feel like it's go to help you move on like it be go to be make or break like it's
S0041	yeah
S0084	if something do come up you can't depend on what it be it's gonna be hard to react hard not to react cos you can't really cos if he's like of whatever if he say something about and it it hurt he's sort of within his right to talk about her
S0041	no he's no
S0084	i know it's hard cos your you know it'll be a really nice time and you'll just fall back into the routine of it just be the two of you really easy
S0041	ah
S0084	but you'll have a nice time you know
S0041	yeah
S0084	when be when be his birthday
S0041	it's on tuesday
S0084	oh i see
S0041	i be just about to say oh god i haven't get you a birthday present well yeah you have
S0084	you've get quite quite a decent one
S0041	fuck eejit
S0084	quite nice
S0041	yes thank
S0084	a little jolly so what be you go to do on monday you're gonna go to hms belfast
S0041	it's close
S0084	ah what why
S0041	till further notice
S0041	yeah i don't know i'm really piss off
S0084	shit
S0041	so go for the egg hunt
S0084	ah
S0041	i'm go to make go the egg hunt i'll print us off i've print off the map at work they're in the car
S0084	ah that's pretty fun
S0041	yeah so that should be a nice thing to do i'm gonna go to the market tomorrow em i'm gonna go to the tate modern cos i've never be and he hasn't either i basically just give him a list of things
S0084	mm
S0041	i say just have a look and we'll see what you want to do and we'll do we'll do it so
S0084	mm right it'll be quite a whistle stop
S0041	yeah i think it's go to be a bite of a whistle stop tour
S0084	mm
S0041	which be good
S0084	yeah knackering but but good
S0041	yeah i don't i don't want to get too too knackered like i'm think perhaps go to the market tomorrow then go back to the hotel and have a bite of a kip
S0084	mm
S0041	you know a bite of a just a rest a breather
S0084	mm
S0041	and then go and do the egg hunters you know a couple of hours
S0084	mm
S0041	and then the have a leisurely just wander around the tate modern get on the train do you know
S0084	mm
S0041	not let's do all this and run around cos i can't be arsed with that shit
S0084	what it's just very knackering and i don't think you actually see anything in any great detail you know if you want to go the tate modern you should just take half a day or a whole day
S0041	yeah
S0084	then do it and then the next time you go to london do something else cos otherwise it's not sort of pointless really
S0041	that's what i think
S0084	it's a pretty a pretty impressive place
S0041	be it
S0084	the tate modern yeah yeah cos there's an old turbine hall so it's massive
S0041	be it
S0084	it's really massive yeah i've forget the last one i go to see i can never remember his name it be a chinese artist who be imprison for like forty years for speak out again the chinese regime
S0041	oh yeah
S0084	and he's suppose to be like on the run now em what be his name pass and he have tiny grain of sand and each one of them be hand paint in the turbine hall when you see the turbine hall you'll see how big it be and it each grain of sand be paint by chinese workers and but they're paint like with lead and so health and safety come and take them all away because they say oh it's you know because people be go in and walk on them so it's like walk on like westerners walk on the work of what people do in the east so how much time and effort go into work that they produce and yeah it be quite it be quite a statement and but they take it all away and they say you couldn't go in
S0041	there be sand all over the floor
S0084	yeah and you
S0041	and this a massive hall
S0084	yeah be it sand or be it rice it might have be rice grain of rice but even still it's pretty fuck small and it's all over the turbine hall you know it be amaze
S0041	wow
S0084	yeah and you could go walk on it and then they say you couldn't walk on it and then they just take it all away it's really sad
S0041	motherfuckers there's a photography exhibit on there at the minute i don't really know cos i'm really not an art person at all i like it i enjoy it like i appreciate it but i just have no knowledge of at all
S0084	yeah no well i'm the same particularly like modern art i think it's all a bite em a bite silly
S0041	yeah em
S0084	i'd rather go and watch a play watch a movie read a book
S0041	yeah
S0084	i don't really understand art unless i can the talent in it and you can't it's difficult to quantify modern art isn't it it's difficult to for people to say that's good that's bad
S0041	yeah
S0084	unmake bed pile of brick
S0041	yeah
S0084	knock down shed etcetera
S0041	yeah what be that
S0084	what be that light on and off
S0041	it's yeah yeah that's why i like the graphic design thing cos you get the bite with it the tell you the the story behind it the think process
S0084	mm
S0041	that's why i use to like look at work go through work with him because you didn't just see the poster or the other whatever
S0084	mm
S0041	the think process behind it be the interest bite that i like
S0084	you could see how he'd get there mm
S0041	yeah so
S0084	i like when you go and see art now and they've get like a little accompany note and it's just word put together in a sentence and you you you think but that doesn't make any sense
S0041	no
S0084	you've just put that into a sentence that's not actually make any sense for anybody
S0041	no which be stupid stupid yes so oh and i i say i ask him to book em somewhere for dinner
S0084	mm
S0041	he book cte
S0084	what's cte
S0041	you know eh the french bistro thing there's one in cambridge
S0084	cte no i don't know
S0041	yeah c o t e with a little hat on the e
S0084	mm mm like the eh french word yeah no oh actually be it the one off on street
S0041	yeah yeah yeah
S0084	oh okay yeah no i've never be in look nice though
S0041	yeah well i've
S0084	it's look nice from the outside
S0041	i go there once and we just have like a sandwich cos it be lunch time
S0084	mm
S0041	but it wasn't much to write home about maybe we order the wrong stuff
S0084	be that the one on the corner on street
S0041	it's the one it's
S0084	cos they're a few that open
S0041	yeah
S0084	the last couple of years and there's one that's on the corner that look quite nice
S0041	i don't know
S0084	cos it use to be an american diner and you use to sit in like old nineteen fifties cars when we first move to cambridge about four or five years ago it's a proper american diner and i really i though it but cheesy as hell
S0041	yeah
S0084	but it be quite fun and obviously like play elvis record all the time but i think it be an independent and it just close down and then yeah
S0041	i can't remember if it's the corner one
S0084	but like a brasserie type place open up and it be on the corner but i never i never look that closely
S0041	there's a couple in a row there's two or three
S0084	mm there's two
S0041	they blur into one
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos they they're both red
S0084	cos then cos you've get chez gerard and you've get café rouge then you've get a couple more
S0041	yeah
S0084	and there that sort of stretch of restaurants
S0041	so i be a bite like oh
S0084	so it's not something special then
S0041	no well i don't think so he might cos he's never be there before
S0084	i mean it's difficult isn't it somewhere like london where you've get so much choice it's really hard so at least you know like if you do book at chain but like a good chain at least you know what you're get
S0041	yeah
S0084	maybe he know that the dinners there be quite nice
S0041	god know and then i think well the dinner in the hotel should be fantastic
S0084	mm
S0041	but then it seem a shame to go to london and eat in the hotel
S0084	yeah really a bite of a waste
S0041	so even though we do only pay fifty percent for it so the food be just like it's basically á la carte din for next to nothing
S0084	mm
S0041	for two people two course you're look at a hundred and twenty quid
S0084	wow
S0041	we pay sixty
S0084	that's really good
S0041	yeah so
S0084	really good
S0041	you kind of should do it for the just to be able to but it's there's no point
S0084	mm hmm
S0041	there's no point in go down to london if you're just go to stay in the hotel and we get canapés and champagne before we leave anyway so
S0084	that's pretty sweet
S0041	that's a winner
S0084	and you get half the price on the bar as well don't you
S0041	yeah cocktails may be require
S0084	cheeky cocktail
S0041	i think cheeky vino may be require
S0084	i don't know if i don't don't mind if i do
S0041	em
S0084	be you oh be you offer me vino now
S0041	yes
S0084	oh em
S0041	red vino
S0084	red vino i think i'll have red vino i have a date tomorrow
S0041	oh do you
S0084	yeah i don't know if i'm go to go though
S0041	why
S0084	i don't i don't know i don't know if he what he's go to be like i suppose that's why you go
S0041	eh who's he who be he
S0084	eh his name's he be a roofer but he also write screenplays naturally the two thing go together
S0041	go
S0084	go
S0041	he might act
S0084	we need to start write these these don't we so if we've get one that sing one that act the next one be what dance
S0041	yes yeah
S0084	mime possibly that would be quite good
S0041	well that would be the winner if someone mime
S0084	or and then then draw maybe some sort of eh graffiti or stroke
S0041	or
S0084	caricature artist
S0041	yeah pull out paper and just
S0084	mm i don't they freak me out those things but yes
S0041	yeah
S0084	so it be
S0041	we have tea now
S0084	tea shall we make tea
S0041	no i don't mean cup of tea i mean eat tea
S0084	oh
S0041	i have oh my god i've haven't eat i haven't eat anything
S0084	what the hell be the matter with you you must be starve
S0041	i think i just felt i just think i felt a bite sick then that's probably why
S0084	you haven't eat all day you absolute maniac no wonder if you're hungry i haven't stop eat today i've eat so much i've have porridge for breakfast then i have some for midmorning snack then i have an omelette the most successful omelette i've ever make in my life not out of a fry pan not that i'm harp on about my fry pan em my my fry pan that's in heaven and then in the afternoon i go into town and then i come back and i make fajitas that actually weren't fajitas at all it be just some corn in a wrap that wasn't even fajita mix because i didn't have any so i just put load of spice on it em random spice with salad
S0041	good
S0084	so just some sort of wrap really not a fajita in any sense shape or form
S0041	right yeah
S0084	i have two of those and a yoghurt
S0041	goodo
S0084	i've eat load of food i've eat my dinner and your dinner i've eat everyone's food
S0041	goodo i feel
S0084	where's your food no wonder you feel sick
S0041	i feel like i well i need to make my soup but i just keep put it off cos i can't be arsed but now
S0084	yeah
S0041	everything there's gonna go off if i don't use it
S0084	get it in put it all in no cos the last time you do that you make the inedible you make the inedible soup
S0041	yeah i can't do that
S0084	don't do that
S0041	no it's just minestrone again i just can't be able to make it maybe i'll feel more incline to do it in the morning
S0084	it seem unlikely give that you've only get an hour to get ready you should get up like in an hour's time
S0041	oh dear
S0084	em do the house smell when you come home
S0041	eh i wasn't smell i wasn't prepare to smell
S0084	but i think if it have smelt you would have smell it
S0041	no i've get a really bad sense of smell
S0084	oh have you
S0041	yeah really really bad
S0084	you've get to be aware of smell have you
S0041	no sometimes i don't smell i can't smell like i can't smell now i know that sound ridiculous i don't know i've always have it so i didn't realise that it be a problem
S0084	right
S0041	em basically if i i think i don't know how i work this out but i think i only have a sense of smell up one nostril
S0084	right
S0041	so like i'm a bite snotty today
S0084	mm
S0041	cos i i automatically be from smoke the night before
S0084	mm
S0041	i can't really smell very much i don't notice that my sense of smell isn't there
S0084	right
S0041	cos i don't i don't know i just don't cos i've always have it i've always have this
S0084	okay
S0041	it's so weird isn't it
S0084	well i suppose it's like my not think that i could possibly be allergic to apples until you say that your face get hot and tingly and hot and red when you eat chocolate and you think that's probably because you're allergic to it that's always happen to me when i eat apples any type of apple my face go really hot i sweat load and it tingle and i just think oh that's a bite weird why be it that apples do that to you oh well and carry on
S0041	yeah
S0084	never flag it as an issue and now i think god
S0041	i just i can't really smell
S0084	well i can't smell at the moment because of the cold but
S0041	i must be able to smell cos part of your taste and smell
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	and i can just taste so it's just it's very
S0084	it's just lessen
S0041	it's i don't know
S0084	than everyone else's maybe it's just not hyper sensitive
S0041	yeah but the other day when i come back i could smell it so
S0084	yeah
S0041	if i'm clear if i'm nasally clear i think it might be cos i've get quite bad sinuses
S0084	yeah
S0041	like i've what's the thing i've get
S0084	sinusitis
S0041	rhinoitis
S0084	what the fuck be that
S0041	it's call rhinusitis but it's basically
S0084	rhinoitis rhino you be a rhino
S0041	turn in to rhino
S0084	turn it to rhino horn will come out your nose
S0041	it's em yes it's just the sinus basically i'm allergic to dust air con change in temperature like everything it's just stupid
S0084	that's madness
S0041	yeah it just make me snotty it's a bite like hay fever
S0084	okay
S0041	a bite like hay fever but i haven't have it very bad for years and years
S0084	mm
S0041	so i just assume it's go away but i think the non smell thing
S0084	mm
S0041	be probably part of that which be a bite weird
S0084	it be a bite weird isn't it
S0041	yeah can you smell it have you smelt it
S0084	i smelt it the other day one day and i open the window and then everyone smelt the fridges and i take the bin out today and i throw away some chicken and i hoover actually
S0041	i put load of bleach down the drain i think it be the drain i think it be when i eh empty out the soup the mouldy soup
S0084	mm
S0041	i think it be something stick in the drain
S0084	possibly cos it doesn't i don't really can't really smell it say when he go out this morning and come here he could smell like that it be like smelly in the house but like when i come back from town earlier i couldn't smell anything
S0041	do you get anything from town
S0084	eh just some birthday card and oh excuse me and some stuff from boot nothing excite
S0041	mm
S0084	i do i get email from instyle magazine and em they send one to me every day and yesterday they have feature that be fifty dress for under fifty quid they have this t shirt dress from river island i think it be i'm never sure about river island cos i think it's like almost chavy and
S0041	right
S0084	it's quite young
S0041	it's get a lot better recently
S0084	we'll it always use to be okay and then it get quite chav and now i think it might be it's like borderline there's some stuff that you can get away with
S0041	yeah it's quite
S0084	but it's also quite young i think
S0041	yeah it's very young and i think now it's really overprice it never use to be river island
S0084	yeah
S0041	use to be less expensive than topshop
S0084	yeah
S0041	and now they're on pretty an even par but there's not the same design or the same quality
S0084	yeah i think and the yeah the quality of the material be just not there but it be em like a long t shirt dress like round neck like crew neck or whatever they call it em black and white pattern like a sort of paisley pattern it's a bite weird and like a brighter trim around the bottom like bright like orange and blue floral pattern at the bottom
S0041	ah
S0084	so it be quite interest and it look like sort of gold finish on the sleeve and i could see it online and it be twenty quid so i think that would be quite good i'd wear it with leggings and heel maybe if i go out or just slobbing around or whatever it's quite quite good for twenty quid and i go in to have a look at it and the the what do you call it like lamy lamy like gold just like a really cheap synthetic material like
S0041	like that skirt
S0084	it's not cotton no your skirt's nice whatever your skirt be it's really cheap it's almost like that but like thicker if you can imagine it
S0041	like thick satin or
S0084	yeah but just really cheap really cheap
S0041	ah
S0084	and so it stick out and just look really weird and like the i quite like the the clash of the monochrome and the floral colour pattern at the bottom and it might be that you could get away with the sleeves you know if you just team it with some nice big gold earrings or something fake or the real gold whatever but i didn't try it on because i don't wanna or no i could i couldn't really justify buy any clothe i say i wasn't go to buy any clothe for a while so and i don't really need it so i just think if it's really nice for twenty quid and i'll get it but i be a bite like hmm might be nice i if try it on can i be arsed it's me
S0041	ah lose all love
S0084	and everyone be just stop in my way and i want to punch everybody in the head
S0041	saturday's in town be just the worst
S0084	yeah i every weekend you know every time i go in on a saturday i think why do i do this to myself
S0041	no bad
S0084	if i go i normally try to go for nine be and i'm home by ten thirty and it's
S0041	that's fine
S0084	do but i couldn't make myself go in this morning
S0041	no that no oh god i hate town on saturday so bad bad bad bad bad
S0084	i don't know you be i don't know why i do it i didn't really need to go i just sit i mean it be sunny i think i think i'll just have a little potter and it be really nice
S0041	a little potter around
S0084	little bite of a potter
S0041	oh oh i bring the bottle of prosecco home from work
S0084	mm
S0041	em to take for the weekend which i think would be nice
S0084	mm
S0041	i mean the more i think about it i think in actual fact what's what's really happen here be that without cos i've subconsciously put quite a lot of effort into this weekend
S0084	mm oh yeah you have
S0041	and i really don't think whatever the outcome be i'm go to be satisfy with it really
S0084	mm
S0041	so i think i probably need to prepare for that a bite
S0084	well i think realistically at this point you want him to just turn around and say i love you let's get back together
S0041	yep
S0084	because
S0041	but it's not go to work that's the thing i don't know what's go on in my head be if he say that to me i'd be really happy but i'd also be think no because
S0084	mm
S0041	that the way you're behave
S0084	mm
S0041	be not a person that i want in my want to be with
S0084	well absolutely yeah he can't he's a completely different person it seem from how he be when he be with you
S0041	yeah
S0084	and also you know the fact that he would jack in something with that quickly like obviously he's say that she doesn't mean anything to him but you know it's a worry with people that do that like he be very much in sort of two mind it seem the more you've get somebody like that you just can't really trust him
S0041	yeah so i don't know why i think it i don't know why
S0084	but
S0041	i don't know why i think it
S0084	yeah i think you have to prepare yourself that really there's a good chance that something's go to happen this week that's go to hurt
S0041	mm
S0084	you know yeah
S0041	no
S0084	cos worst you know the best yeah the best outcome be you have a really nice weekend
S0041	yeah the best outcome be we have a lovely weekend do you know that i just want him to realise
S0084	but that's still go to hurt though you know like you know you come back whenever it be monday and you say your goodbyes and you think well that be a really nice weekend and then that's gonna hurt because then you've get to walk away and you know
S0041	mm
S0084	if you have anything less than a good weekend that's gonna hurt for whatever reason make it a not good weekend
S0041	yeah it's a lose lose situation
S0084	yeah which be what i've be say for weeks
S0041	yes i know
S0084	yeah but that say i can i understand why you're do it and maybe this be a way of re establish your friendship rather than whatever weird thing be go on between you two at the moment
S0041	yeah
S0084	so
S0041	i i just feel a bite i say to the thing be i just don't feel like he's after all the things he be say about how special what we have be i just don't think i feel like he's treat it like it be
S0084	mm
S0041	because he's not behave well towards me so i kinda think that that just tarnish
S0084	mm
S0041	tarnish what we have and i don't think he's really hello
S0084	i'm british gas call you're through to how may i direct your call em i don't know it's like he doesn't realise that but and that's the weird thing
S0041	and like the when we're go away like navyness and whatever i kinda think like he doesn't care that he's not go to see me
S0084	mm well i mean he probably do he just hasn't it's like isn't any comprehension he just doesn't see
S0041	yeah
S0084	long term like he's just i think he think that it's just a pipe dream on a pipe dream that's wrong though
S0041	yeah
S0084	it's just you know that your plan for today
S0041	yeah
S0084	today i will oh i know i'll join the navy and tomorrow you'll get to be a hot air pilot or whatever hot air be they pilot whatever they be
S0041	yeah
S0084	it don't know if it's a
S0041	i've always like to do that i've never be on a hot air balloon before
S0084	no i haven't i mean i think i might shit myself a tiny tiny bite shit my pant man
S0041	would you
S0084	i hate fly so just be like up in a plane
S0041	oh yeah of course
S0084	but loose and just like the the possibility of like fall out of the plane at any point
S0041	no i probably wouldn't do that if i be you
S0084	no no which be why i will not be throw myself out of any plan i mean i would quite like to go to on a hot air balloon but i think i would have to sit down in the basket cos i think
S0041	but then you wouldn't get to see very much
S0084	oh no cos i'm quite tall i'm quite long in the torso if you think the basket be probably here
S0041	no
S0084	so i could sit here
S0041	no
S0084	it be
S0041	be it
S0084	i don't know i've
S0041	be they that shallow
S0084	i've never be on one i think it's quite that's my fear that it would be so shallow that i would if i lean over i would fall out because it would only come to my midriff or lower
S0041	no
S0084	in which case i'd want to sit down
S0041	i think it come to the boobage
S0084	yeah but that's depend on what height like that might come to your boob but that's like still in mine not my waste cos you're not a munchkin
S0041	no i think i think it would come to your boobage i think to me i think i get the feel that it would be about here on me

S0084	so
S0041	and delete
S0084	okay bye and delete poor heart she's already under enough stress to be add layer of mar bar to the eh to the arteries go for sausage club yesterday which be delicious
S0041	i go for sausage club yesterday
S0084	it be so good like we have em we always make a joke cos like every time we go it's a different price depend on who's on the till because you're all fuck special and the last time i go it be the big guy who fancy all the women so he undercharge all the girls so me and my colleague have the same breakfast but mine be one pound seventy and his be two pound twenty four because the bloke undercharge women which be hilarious and all the boys be like that's fuck sexist if it be the other way round they'd be like you know the union will be get involve blah blah blah and i be like oh shut up whatever and eh this week it be the guy in charge it be michael and you know like as soon as you walk you're like right everyone get out your loan
S0041	yeah
S0084	get a second mortgage on that house to pay for your breakfast and he try to charge me and i always have the same thing so bear in mind it be one pound and seventy last time three pound twenty four
S0041	shut up
S0084	and i be like hold the phone michael what the hell two sausages bean and two egg and he be like three pound twenty four and i be like be you sure that's right michael and he say be you doubt me and i say well i i wouldn't dare michael i wouldn't dare but it be quite early in the morning i just wonder whether you accidentally slip on the button for sausage and press it ten time rather than two time because that's a bite obscene em and i say if you're gonna recalculate it as more i wanna just have that price please eh and he do it again and it come out at two pound and i be like right so how do we get the three pound twenty four and he be like yeah i i'm so sorry about that such a piss take if he didn't i think he do it on purpose because obviously he's the manager so he just overcharge everybody
S0041	yeah
S0084	probably cos he know the rest be fuck retard and they undercharge
S0041	and you'll just say alright
S0084	yeah
S0084	do him out of shit load of money all the time anyway so he's like well i've get to make it back somehow
S0041	oh yeah absolutely
S0084	it's really funny like when i go there's a big guy who undercharge the women like he's serve on thursday i have some sort of weird chicken crumble it's pretty mental
S0041	chicken crumble
S0084	yeah so it be crumble but with like a like imagine like a chicken pie so chicken and bacon and mushroom in a you know
S0041	yeah
S0084	sauce or whatever
S0041	yeah
S0084	and then you'd have a pie on top or around it well without the pie instead of the pie you've get crumble so it be mental but pretty nice it wasn't a sweet crumble it be a savoury crumble but it be
S0041	yeah like a crust
S0084	it be good yeah it be really nice with like some tatties and eh like carrot and swede mash or something and he be oh yeah that's two pound and i know know for one it should be like three ninety nine and i be like oh that's really great and he be like oh i didn't see your veg on your way out thank it's so bad like obviously the feminist in me be like oh you should you know shouldn't allow it you shouldn't allow it and then i'm like well i'm fuck poor
S0041	yeah
S0084	so that's just gonna have to eh
S0041	that's in order
S0084	be ignore yeah it's pretty good that's who you want on the till i mean i it's already pretty subsidise so even like the the the full meal be yeah be like four quid so it's not it's not go to break the bank but it do make you really frugal like to think the difference between two like two fifty or four pound
S0041	that's a big difference isn't it
S0084	it be a big difference like you can have a bowl soup a small bowl of soup be forty p or a big bowl of be ninety p i think so even that's really cheap
S0041	oh
S0084	like a small bowl of soup there's not actually that much difference in quantity
S0041	yeah
S0084	but it's its price so you might as well get a small bowl mm
S0041	they say that at work they say you know we we can't really complain about the quality of the food that they serve because it's free
S0084	oh
S0041	but
S0084	do you not get the food they serve to the guests
S0041	oh no do we fuck
S0084	oh
S0041	oh no
S0084	who cook your food then have they get a special company in do they
S0041	no no it's the chefs but em
S0084	it's the same chefs then
S0041	yeah but it's just like cos obviously the stuff that's serve in the restaurants be the restaurant's open in the even and it's a la carte
S0084	mm
S0041	so it's like monkfish and duck and
S0084	nice
S0041	other shit
S0084	mm
S0041	and the lunch bar it's like well burgers or pizza be fine but they couldn't afford to give us that cos i think they're allocate something stupid like forty p a head
S0084	for their staff
S0041	yeah which it just doesn't make sense to me and i'm sure it can't be that low i'm sure it can't but basically you know the food that's give to a a guest be allocate at ten pound a head or something
S0084	right
S0041	so it's a really really vast different em for example today's menu which i i walk past be em potato wedge peas and sweet corn mix together
S0084	mm
S0041	and fry chicken
S0084	mm
S0041	the junk food only get like that type of junk food only get serve at a weekend
S0084	mm
S0041	which i don't understand treat time em or but they'd put like a chicken curry on which be just shit like you wouldn't eat it it's bad
S0084	really
S0041	and then the other two options to go with it would be rice and naan bread
S0084	mm
S0041	where's the vegetable
S0084	mm
S0041	there's no healthy option if you want to eat healthily you can't
S0084	that's really bad
S0041	or the the other day lasagne
S0084	mm
S0041	with chip
S0084	so carbs on carbs
S0041	carbs on carbs with
S0084	garlic bread
S0041	garlic bread
S0084	be it really
S0041	yeah
S0084	that's hilarious what wrong with a salad
S0041	and they're like the housekeepers need that stodge to keep them go cos they do a really physical job no they don't nobody need that
S0084	bollocks no
S0041	nobody's body be make for that
S0084	mm no no no there's absolutely no need for it and you really should be you know supply alternatives
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know
S0041	but they just don't
S0084	i mean i can't really complain about our canteen it be it be good they do have quite a lot of stuff on they've get like a bistro bar and a traditional bar and so they'll have like two mains and then they'll be a veggie option and then they'll have soup plus a hot veg and then a cold salad bar and there's the sandwich and then there's the cold meats section there's pies and then there's you know all your other stuff like your crisp and your fruit and your yoghurts and your and your dessert
S0041	all that shit
S0084	it's massive but you be feed over a thousand people
S0041	yeah
S0084	so the you so you can get more in because obviously you've get more people pay
S0041	yeah
S0084	so it's easier to fee more people so
S0041	yeah i know this be absolute cack although i must admit because of all the complain i've be do eh it have get better for the past couple of weeks
S0084	and you're on that board thing be you the gossip board
S0041	the gossip board that's where i complain
S0084	good
S0041	i go do i tell you i go to holiday inn last week with the gossip board
S0084	oh you say go to the holiday inn yeah
S0041	yeah that be because of the gossip board
S0084	mm
S0041	that be quite nice
S0084	that be a whole day out be it or part of the day
S0041	three hours i think yeah three hours
S0084	mm
S0041	yeah it be a bite a bite of a change of scenery have i tell you that they make me go and be on the charity board as well
S0084	oh so what do that mean like find a charity to sponsor or do campaign to raise money
S0041	yeah each year ihg yeah each year ihg have a
S0084	sponsor a
S0041	sponsor a charity yeah
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	this year i can't even tell you what it be shelter in the storm
S0084	mm
S0041	have you hear of this before
S0084	i've hear of shelter be it different
S0041	it's it's it's everything it's africa
S0084	it's everything it's africa eh be it everything or be it africa
S0041	it's it's what's that really big charity
S0084	oxfam cafod water aid
S0041	eh eh
S0084	save the children nspcc
S0041	it's it's something like that it's one of those but it's not those
S0084	cancer research
S0041	no
S0084	rspca rnib
S0041	it help
S0084	rnli
S0041	it help load of load of different things
S0084	un no not un oh
S0041	oh i can't fuck remember but i should know this be on charity border call
S0084	probs yeah
S0041	but yeah anyway it doesn't do that like last year they sponsor whizz kid right
S0084	yeah
S0041	which be basically the charity of the children with chair and i think we i think we buy two our hotel buy two and they be six pound a go
S0084	wow
S0041	because people could really relate to it so when you're do things you know you could quantify what you're give to somebody you know how much that would change their way of life
S0084	mm
S0041	so people really get into it
S0084	mm
S0041	but now it's like well what do the charity do i don't really know you know it's in africa and if there's a natural disaster or any type of disaster war or something they provide shelter for people who lose their home
S0084	right
S0041	which be the part that i've we're supposedly go in as shelter in a storm
S0084	mm well that's good
S0041	but then
S0084	that's what they need
S0041	well yeah but the logic be that we provide luxury accommodation for people
S0084	mm
S0041	all over the world
S0084	mm
S0041	these people provide accommodation no matter what
S0084	mm
S0041	all the time like that's just as just as luxurious to somebody with nothing
S0084	mm
S0041	it i think that's suppose to be the the kind of link
S0084	tenuous link mm
S0041	yeah but this other because it do so much stuff it help fight aid in africa it's malaria jab it's children in india they're get marry off at eight years old and rap
S0084	be it amnesty international
S0041	no frig it's it's like it's really like amnesty international but and i think it's call community community oh
S0084	world be it like the world aid organisation or world or something mate you probably should know this
S0041	i know but it's like that and you know you just think well you no you can't quantify do they want do they want us to give clothe do they want us to give money do what i just it just doesn't make sense
S0084	the thing be they've probably have you this and you've probably go yeah it's interest
S0041	no they haven't actually
S0084	have they not
S0041	i don't know if they've tell the management team but they certainly haven't tell us yet
S0084	because that's well that's what you need to know isn't it otherwise there's no point
S0041	there's no direction yeah that's what i say
S0084	mm
S0041	so it just it just seem a waste of time but yeah check that on the cv board board for charity border
S0084	literally bore to tear
S0041	yes to death and the worst part be we have to send someone from the department and obviously no one volunteer to go but i can't do charity stuff like i really can't
S0084	what why
S0041	have i tell you that i think africa be just like i can't even don't even know what's go on there
S0084	what
S0041	i have tell you this before this make me sound really mean but you know starve kid in africa
S0084	mm
S0041	i can't really accept that that's real and i know it be but because i've just i find it so horrific
S0084	mm
S0041	i've just i i it's just so far away from anything l i can possibly understand it i feel like when i see it on tv it's not real
S0084	right
S0041	which make me sound awful
S0084	mm
S0041	and i know it do but it's just it's so it's so bad i just can't understand how i just can't i just can't fathom it
S0084	mm
S0041	it's like space you know i just i
S0084	well i mean it's horrific and it be difficult to understand that in this day and age you know in somalia kid be die every day
S0041	yeah
S0084	hundreds and thousands of people be die every day and yet there's absolutely no need for it every day like what be it every three second somebody die in africa
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know needlessly through lack of water through drink dirty water through lack of immunization you know it's it's happen all the time at at a time when we've cure all of these diseases
S0041	yeah
S0084	but we let it run wild out there because it's just not financially viable for us to do anything about it it be disgust and it be really far away but the worry be obviously what with television be everywhere in our live be we be desensitize to everything
S0041	yeah
S0084	so if we see something we're like oh that's just the tv i'll just block that out but they but that's so much more important it's like when people be like oh we've get to help ourselves before we help anybody else and you think well that's not really what it's all about it's about help the people who need it the most
S0041	but do you not think and this be this make me sound like hitler
S0084	right
S0041	which i know that so do you know prepare yourself but do you not think that like if these if we these people should be able to should they're just not evolve do you not think like the only reason they're they're genetically different to us because okay so they're not educate cos we be give an education
S0084	mm
S0041	but we weren't educate we be cavemen too
S0084	mm
S0041	and it's just because our environment be habitable that we've be able to evolve and learn these things like i i i find it really weird it's like alien to me honestly it's like alien to me like they live in an environment that can't really readily or easily for the for the vast part of it anyway their land can't grow things
S0084	mm yeah
S0041	it's not it's not it's not suppose to sustain life
S0084	yeah it's not it's not yeah it's not sustainable yeah
S0041	it's not suppose to so no matter how much money you throw at the problem
S0084	mm
S0041	it's perpetual because they shouldn't be live there
S0084	mm mm
S0041	and really i can't i can't help but think right that if maybe if maybe no one be throw money at it
S0084	mm
S0041	which be where the hitler come in they would all be dead
S0084	mm
S0041	anyway which isn't that i wish all the people dead
S0084	yeah
S0041	i just wish that maybe thousands of years ago hundreds of years ago when people start throw money at the problem they didn't throw money at it so it never develop do you know what i mean like i
S0084	i yeah
S0041	i can't understand how it get to this now
S0084	i don't know i mean my history be pretty bad as well i don't know why obviously we all come from africa like
S0041	yeah
S0084	through the last thousands of years as man's evolve we've all come from africa so we be from them
S0041	yeah
S0084	so why it happen that you know obviously in the west we evolve more quickly we maybe it be because our terrain be much more habitable and we be able to do that as as we evolve we then go to these countries and then enslave them and we take religion and we take our culture and enforce it on these countries so like for example when you go to new zealand and you learn about the maori culture and you learn about how they'd have to come over from you know polynesian islands and they and and you know invade new zealand and the maoris have make it their own land and when the white come like the missionaries come they come and teach them religion so they teach them that god have create the earth in seven days and on the seventh day he rest and the seventh day be a sacred day so they lay down their weapons on the seventh day and they rest and the white man come and they brutally murder them all because they know that they'd lay down their weapons
S0041	be you be serious
S0084	yeah yeah they do that's how they that's how they go there and take over the land it's probably what they do in america but i can't remember but i know it's definitely what they do in new zealand that's what the missionaries do so there they're preach the word of god but in an actual fact
S0041	fuck
S0084	they're there on behalf of you know the pillage armies now they're gonna go
S0041	holy
S0084	the women be go to be rap the children be go to get kill and the men be gonna be enslave so it's all very well to say that we're the evolve western world when in actual fact we're less humane than anybody else
S0041	mm
S0084	though the issue i have be this idea of natural selection a certain number of people have to die because the planet can only sustain a certain number of people
S0041	yeah
S0084	and obviously because of their they they don't have access to condoms men men rape women
S0041	yeah
S0084	so they're constantly have baby there's no way that they can't not because there's no consensual sex there they're be rap
S0041	no
S0084	they're constantly have baby they're more and more baby be bring into a world that that can't sustain them it's so it just beggar belief that we can have money and they can't our world be evolve but there's hasn't like how and it's because it seem so alien now because it's be allow this gulf have be allow to get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger
S0041	yeah
S0084	at a time when we could have do something about it
S0041	yeah
S0084	nothing be really do
S0041	no
S0084	and so now it's get to a point where i we can't really fix it because the gulf be so huge between us
S0041	yeah
S0084	so really it's really hard but technology have come so far that you could actually transform the landscape if you want to company could go out there and they could build irrigation in the field
S0041	yeah that's true
S0084	they could you know
S0041	yeah
S0084	greenhouses whatever it take they can make the land more habitable than they have right now you can you can
S0041	but you can't you can't give that
S0084	invent cloud to come over you can you know there be cloud buster machine now you can actually cause rain like people can now actually cause it to rain
S0041	but you can't give that to someone who be so so so backward which sound awful but they be
S0084	no but they're not stupid do you know what i mean they just haven't be afford the opportunity because we we're in the west and we're special and we've get the tool and we want to make our money ourselves we don't want to give anybody else what we've get
S0041	well someone must say to those men to rape be wrong and they don't understand that
S0084	but no but no i don't think anybody be because they're just be leave to their own devices there's no one really there there's no one really there to help them
S0041	but how can they think that's right like in our in in england
S0084	because they're because they be barbaric in the sense that they haven't get they haven't be through the same civilization that we have but that doesn't mean that we're any more humane cos we do terrible things as well
S0041	but they must talk to each other
S0084	our armies go in and pillage
S0041	like they they can communicate so
S0084	it's not about
S0041	so when the woman say no don't do that
S0084	and he think that that's okay much like in a country that we think be more develop for example saudi arabia like they they stone women in the middle east still they'll chop off your hand you're not allow to sunbathe in a in a bikini
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know everyone every country really be at a different level of development civilization em and we're still incredibly backward and we still don't help each other in the way that i think we should there's that's what i find so sicken about national identity and divide and border be that this these gulfs between us be get bigger all the time when in actual fact we should just be one
S0041	mm
S0084	we shouldn't be however hundreds of countries there be because we're not help each other
S0041	yeah
S0084	do these these people in somalia be die and it's so unnecessary i mean obviously it's not just somalia but that's where the drought be at the moment
S0041	yeah
S0084	and obviously you've get people in haiti you know and they're still in port au prince they're still live in shanty towns
S0041	in fuck new orleans they're still live in tent
S0084	yeah but i mean and this be like a whole country you know haiti it's awful
S0041	yeah i don't really get it i i don't i can't really fathom it to be honest and
S0084	well no that's and i think that's why people have such a have such difficulty in in relate to it because it be so far away it's so far remove from what we understand but that's you know it's not a reason not to do something about it
S0041	and then i have to go and then put the video on and i start cry i can't watch it i can't even watch the advert on tv
S0084	i know i can't watch the advert on tv i cry
S0041	and then we have to watch this video and i'm sit there bawl
S0084	yeah
S0041	and i think to out of everyone to send to the charity meet
S0084	mm
S0041	really it wasn't me
S0084	yeah
S0041	i be the wrong person to send to the charity meet it be a fuck piss take
S0084	that be just really move though isn't it i mean that i mean that that's why they do it
S0041	mm
S0084	because they want to affect you you know they they need to get your attention
S0041	why oh i just don't i don't think i'll ever get it i don't think i'll ever understand it
S0084	well i mean that's a good enough reason to try and understand it isn't it you know if you think well i don't understand that maybe maybe i should read something more about it like i think if i watch something on tv but the thing be my memory be like a goldfish like i might watch a film about the trouble in northern island and i think i don't understand that i don't really understand what happen there and what and the history like the history go back like hundreds of years between the irish and the english and i why where do it come from and i've read about it and i've go online and i've watch movies and i think it's really interest and how how have this come to be and i learn it and i think oh my god this be really bad a week later i'm interest in something else and i've forget about that and it's go i couldn't tell you any of it now you know i just think it's so hard but something like that it's really important isn't it like
S0041	mm
S0084	the idea that someone be die every three second unnecessarily
S0041	yeah like you say it and i know you're not lie but it just sound like a lie
S0084	i'm not lie no no no no i mean that be the whole idea of do behind do world aid again in two thousand and eight or whenever it be two thousand and five when live eight what be it call live eight
S0041	yeah live eight
S0084	and they all those advert the all the celebrities click every three second
S0041	yeah
S0084	do you remember
S0041	yeah
S0084	that be it that's another person dead and it's really powerful but then as soon as that's go everyone's forget about it because that's what you do you sort of go about your daily live don't you
S0041	yeah
S0084	unless you be the bob geldof's of this world go out and champion it in ethiopia and somalia and botswana
S0041	what i don't really get as well be that like there be there be people that can afford to give a lot of money
S0084	yeah
S0041	like i'm not talk well i'll give my one pound a week
S0084	mm
S0041	i'm talk just take your interest out of what you have
S0084	mm
S0041	this year and give them half a million quid
S0084	mm mm
S0041	so i if i don't actually believe that the government really want to do anything about it because if they do
S0084	mm
S0041	there's enough money go round
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	people have get enough money
S0084	yeah well if you think that they could have clear the third world debt em you know over and over and over and over and over and over and over easily so then they just won't do it because it just doesn't make any sense and obviously the the people who can can afford to and can afford to make a little difference be the pharmaceutical company
S0041	yeah
S0084	the ones that be out there
S0041	yeah
S0084	push their drug peddle their drug create more problem and actually they're the ones who be rich they're the ones actually who would be like the what do you call it those horrible creatures cockroaches the ones who never die

S0084	you know they'll be an apocalypse
S0041	yeah
S0084	they'll be a nuclear war and it'll be the fuck pharmaceutical company who will survive they're fuck devil cos it's just
S0041	cos i think that as well so i say okay so you can't you can't make them wear condoms
S0084	they try and they're constantly give they're there they're give them out obviously because you've get an aid epidemic haven't you
S0041	so why don't they just give all the women the pill
S0084	you can't make them take it
S0041	but you would take it
S0084	you well i suppose you'd try i mean obviously you've get
S0041	you do if you live in a country where you're go to be rap
S0084	mm
S0041	you would think they would take it
S0084	yeah well again you've get to get the pharmaceutical company to agree to it and i don't think they would
S0041	no do you see a while ago actually i don't know why but i just remember this a while ago there be an an article about a woman em in the news and they think she'd be she be immune to hiv
