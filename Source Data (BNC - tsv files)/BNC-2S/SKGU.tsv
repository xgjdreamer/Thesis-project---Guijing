S0439	they don't even look at us it's not even and if we like we can't even ask for a salary review
S0440	yeah i know i know but you see you should be able to because every single year you have to have a performance review
S0439	yeah we've just have my mid year review and me and and i my goals with
S0440	mm
S0439	but i think once everything start kick off in like january february
S0440	mm
S0439	i'll speak to him and like well i think the job be very different to what i do when and i and it's a lot more senior and i'd rather and if you're pay if you're ask cos they want to employ a programme manager
S0440	yeah
S0439	and at the moment cos obviously he doesn't have a he's he's they're look at people and they will get someone in
S0440	mm
S0439	at the moment like essentially he want me to do a lot of it
S0440	mm
S0439	which isn't my job
S0440	no
S0439	like and i'm not be pay a programme manager
S0439	or even a project manager salary
S0440	no that's right
S0439	so you know i be like i don't mind do it i enjoy it like i actually strangely enjoy it but erm
S0440	yeah
S0439	i don't want you to take advantage of that and not look at my salary and i think he'll respect that i think he's quite open about that kind of thing
S0440	mm mm mm mm
S0439	he he expense everything it's hilarious
S0440	mm
S0439	but i'm also not shunt the fact that actually i get a lot more experience and train and opportunity with this job
S0440	yeah absolutely
S0439	which in itself be invaluable so i'm not worry that that salary hasn't go up so
S0440	you'll get if you get the international experience that be just so much
S0439	yeah well it's just like the train we go to a few weeks ago be what three hundred odd quid and then in january he want me to organise some meet with some suppliers at the the big technology exhibition

S0440	and i need you to help me project manage me
S0439	i can do mum but you have to want to do it

S0440	doesn't include delivery doesn't include this
S0439	yeah it doesn't add yeah it's
S0440	well i've find another one where it do include delivery for that price

S0440	yeah
S0439	then they they they would they definitely would have they must have
S0439	they must do because no one pay that price no one it's the same as like a car salesman isn't it you look at the rat price but no one ever pay it
S0440	yeah
S0439	it's a sale at the end of the day and they they wanna sale so i'd be surprise if you don't get some money knock off there
S0440	and the thing be you know they can get more sales out of it and the end of it can't they
S0439	but it's just it's i think it just need to be do i mean he need to just come and just have his own even even if he yeah like i say you don't have to spend every day or no obviously you you don't have to see him every day but you don't have to spend every hour of every day with him
S0440	well this be what i say to him i say what i want to do every morning be get up get him his cup of tea and his breakfast well put lay his breakfast out not necessarily make his breakfast but
S0439	yeah you can do that can't you
S0440	you know he can do his own breakfast he can then read he like to read the newspaper at the table
S0439	yeah that's fine
S0440	so i while he's do that i go off to the gym by which time the tattoo brigade and the steroid brigade have go erm and i can have a an hour in the gym not feel embarrass or anything like that i can just go in the gym and just do do my bits come back and then you know it's almost ready to get him his sandwich for lunch or whatever
S0439	mm yeah i don't yeah i don't see that a be a problem
S0440	but i need to do that every day book in at ten o'clock every single day to go to the gym i've get to get i've i've get to get into routines
S0439	apparently it take twenty one days to create a routine
S0440	well create me my routine
S0439	i can't do that mum i can i can help you but i can't do it for you project management doesn't solve stuff it give you the tool to solve it
S0440	well give me the tool give me the tool alright
S0439	i will but you've gotta do it
S0440	give me the tool alright
S0439	it's as simple as have a spreadsheet and tick off the days you go
S0440	right well you have to you have to help me
S0439	i will but you need to do
S0440	good i want you to help me i'm ask
S0439	yeah i know i'm try mum but you i can't i can't physically push you to walk to the gym
S0440	no you can't physically push me but you can set me a schedule
S0439	yeah
S0440	you can and then you can keep ring me up and say be you on that schedule have you do this yet yes i have no i haven't why haven't you do it i haven't do it because this right okay but when we look at the garage
S0439	mm
S0440	you can actually make it into two separate little areas like you'll have the shower room and the bed up one end
S0439	yeah
S0440	and then almost it cut it in half and then you have the sit area and the tv
S0439	yeah that's what i would expect
S0440	and like you get you know that big tv unit that we have in
S0439	yeah yeah yeah
S0440	that's only four hundred quid but he can have his tv on there he can have his radio he can have and he can have all those
S0439	he doesn't need it that big
S0440	no no no he doesn't need it quite that big but he can have his own picture
S0439	yeah
S0440	and he can have you know the like the
S0439	that's what i it need to be it need to be his space it need to be his room
S0440	and he can have like like the woman you know the woman back again
S0439	mm
S0440	and and things like this
S0439	yeah picture of nan and stuff yeah
S0440	exactly
S0439	he could even have the one of and erm
S0440	and and
S0439	in there and stuff like
S0440	absolutely and he can just
S0439	it's get to be his space
S0440	it's get to be his space absolutely
S0439	as as he's pay for it but then it also mean that it's not that he can't come into agree to it
S0440	no no no no he's get to cos he's gotta
S0439	but he need that space and you need that space as well
S0440	yeah
S0440	so
S0439	so then he if he want to go watch tv instead of sit in our live room he sit in his live room
S0440	yeah
S0439	he can he obviously can sit in your live room but if he sit in his live room it's his domain and his space
S0440	and the only the other thing i find in the erm the other thing i find as well be there be two they call them ceramic core radiators
S0439	yeah
S0440	they're about four hundred pound each but it mean you don't have to have the heat on in the whole of the house cos they're electric drive
S0439	yeah yeah oh that's good
S0440	and so he can have those on in his room all the time but you haven't gotta have the heat on at twenty two in the rest of the house
S0439	yeah but how expensive be that
S0440	it's not expensive because you they they heat up overnight on on seven
S0439	oh yes
S0440	and they keep it at twenty two minimum twenty two if you need to boost it up then obviously the electric will
S0439	yeah
S0440	kick in but he's pay that in his electric
S0439	yeah yeah yeah true
S0440	you know his money but i can't keep the house at the same temperature
S0439	oh no not in the summer as well
S0440	jesus christ that home last week cos i say to him
S0439	and that make it smell even more
S0440	oh
S0440	the heat just
S0439	yeah
S0440	absolutely and i just say er
S0439	i just i can imagine it be so nice it would be so even though it won't be perfect and you and dad'll have blah blah blah
S0440	and the other thing
S0439	it'll be so much better
S0440	the other thing we'll do be we'll put a very cheap laminate on the floor
S0439	yeah like a wooden laminate
S0440	a a yeah an ikea cheap laminate
S0439	some of the ones we saw in wickes last week weren't expensive i didn't think
S0440	that's right that's right exactly but you put something like that down so that when he's go i know it sound horrible when he's go you could actually take it up and put a carpet down or put something else down
S0439	yeah
S0440	but
S0439	yeah yeah
S0440	i just i i'm try to think of all the things that we can do to make that room
S0439	room his room
S0440	but i i look at the ceramic core radiators and i just think to myself that then save us have to heat use every time he want to kick it up to twenty two in his
S0439	yeah he can yeah
S0440	he can kick it up to that because it's control on the
S0439	yeah
S0440	on central heat or it's not control on the central heat so i can set my temperature at what i normally do be eighteen or nineteen
S0440	erm
S0440	at the weekend we normally set it at eighteen erm and that mean that he can keep his room
S0439	mm
S0440	much warmer
S0439	but it's it's just he can't carry on where he be and
S0440	oh god
S0439	and the thing be we i like i ring dad a few weeks ago and when he tell you that i could work from home on fridays
S0440	mm
S0439	i say i ring dad if can work from home on fridays i can work from your house
S0440	mm
S0439	you can have a day where you like if i even if i do it twice a month or once a month
S0440	yeah
S0439	you've still get a friday where you can go out shop or you can go out for a i dunno whatever you wanna do
S0440	mm
S0439	and i could just like i just need to sit there i just need to be there and i don't think would mind if if i'm if he's work from home anyway and i'm like i don't actually even have to tell him that i work from your house but i don't think he'd care
S0440	no i don't think he'd care either
S0439	cos he know that i do my job so
S0440	if you're on the internet and you're connectable
S0439	exactly
S0440	it doesn't matter do it
S0439	and that's the point like it doesn't matter if i work from my house your house i can work from home and just sit with and you can go off and have a day to yourself cos you get i think you'll need that so
S0440	i've get to have it yeah
S0439	so i think that work really well as well
S0440	mm
S0439	if i can work from home on fridays
S0440	yeah but the the other thing as well be this be what i use to do when i first move down here and i know it sound stupid but i didn't have any job whatsoever and i wasn't do part time work or anything like that be i use to go to the butcher twice a week
S0439	mm
S0440	and i use to make meals for two or three days but
S0439	yeah
S0440	not spend load of money like buy load of stuff for the freezer
S0439	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0440	and that make life a lot easier because although we be eat
S0439	yeah
S0440	and i say to there'll be time when we'll eat at lunchtime you'll just have to eat in the even or you'll need to be home for five or five o'clockish or half five
S0439	do you dad doesn't really eat i don't know with you anyway so
S0440	no he doesn't and that's
S0439	you can eat with grandad at lunchtime can't
S0440	he's not yeah but he's father's not eat
S0439	he be he have lose a lot of weight
S0440	he look old
S0439	he look fine i think he look okay but i don't think he should lose any more
S0440	doesn't want no and that's right and i've i mean like last night he have this chilli this this erm curry but instead of give him like i would do i just say to him on the excuse oh 's come home so we have to split this between three and he say okay fine so i give him that and he say it's alright i can make it up with fruit and that's what he do and i think that's what's gonna happen
S0439	yeah that's fine
S0440	it's that he have smaller meals but he have better he doesn't eat a lot of protein and that's what
S0439	yeah
S0440	he eat a lot of oat cake and vegetables but he doesn't eat a lot of protein
S0439	mm
S0440	and i think that's where he's go wrong i'm not be funny but
S0439	yeah
S0440	he need more protein
S0439	i love protein
S0440	so do i but you know he i've get these little pie dish some
S0439	yeah
S0440	individual pie dish and we could make i could make individual pies six
S0439	yeah
S0440	six individual pies or whatever or what cornish pasties or things like that you know what i mean
S0439	cornish pasty and vegetable and stuff it's a really nice meal
S0440	it's a meal yeah it's a proper meal
S0439	easy gotta get some pastry whack some meat
S0440	mm that's right
S0440	and it doesn't cost a lot and if if if father have a cornish pasty at lunchtime with some vegetables and gravy in the even time he only need a soup
S0439	yeah exactly i think he'll be i think he'll be fine and and yeah you i think and that's what and do wrong they didn't have their personal space
S0440	mm
S0439	he be there all the time
S0440	yeah
S0439	and but if you haven't cos obviously you're gonna have a door into the garage you can have a door into the garage
S0440	yeah and i say to i
S0439	you he's technically not even there
S0440	no and i say to i say to to father the other thing we'll that we've gotta do be we will not just barge into your room
S0439	yeah
S0440	we'll knock and say you know be you alright dad or whatever and you're right about have to have a baby alarm
S0439	yeah no you need a you need a baby alarm or a baby monitor
S0440	yeah mm
S0439	because you know how many time when he use to live upstairs
S0440	mm
S0439	when he come to you and you could hear him go to to the bathroom and you can hear him like go like oh like
S0440	mm yeah
S0439	i know he's not not purposely moan but he be moan and you've get to make sure that he's okay
S0440	mm but his knees have seize up since he's be where he be cos he's not get any exercise
S0439	yeah not move yeah
S0440	so i've get that little blue thing
S0439	do you think if i be i be just think this actually if there's a if you're have a shed the garage
S0440	mm
S0439	you're gonna have to he's gonna have to walk on the gravel you're gonna have like a path from his room to the
S0440	yeah i'll have to have a path yeah
S0439	shed
S0440	oh yeah we've gotta do we've gotta have a path out there anyway because of
S0439	oh yeah true
S0440	because of the fact that that's get to be the disable entrance
S0439	yeah
S0440	so we've get to have a path from the car to there anyway
S0439	true bless him yeah i know but then 'll moan she'll be like i can't believe you're have this nice extension do oh you could've fuck do it as well love
S0440	we tell them to have their bathroom do and they didn't
S0439	yeah and convert the conservatory but they didn't
S0440	so if she argue about this i will say to her what about the ten thousand for the car
S0439	mm
S0440	i will and if say don't be so pathetic i'm not be pathetic this be where it's gotta go
S0439	no she can't moan about you nick you're not nick but you can cos it's the thing be that that's actually benefit grandad the car isn't benefit grandad
S0440	and i think your father's idea about take money
S0439	yeah
S0440	two or three or two thousand pound a month for him to stay with us and we then put it into a bank account for him
S0439	or in like an an isa or something yeah
S0440	yeah exactly put it into his own save account
S0439	i don't i think but i think dad's the best person to do that
S0440	but yeah i can't deal with it and i i've i've i've say i don't want
S0439	but that apparently it just need to be sort i think dad just need to get it do
S0440	i know
S0439	no there's no point say you know because you know because you haven't do it neither you or have do it and she's just sit on this the thing be you don't even know what she's spend you don't know if she's actually touch his card
S0440	no i know i know i know but when she suddenly miraculously have a a bathroom and a conservatory do i'm sit there and i'm think hang on a minute what if she turn
S0439	but then if out of his bank account
S0440	if she turn around and say well he cause me so much problem that i have to have it do
S0439	fuck off do he
S0440	yeah exactly
S0439	it be leak before he even arrive
S0440	i know i know i know i know i know i know
S0439	she can't take she wouldn't've be able to take it out of his bank account without you know anyway if she actually could take her to court for it so
S0440	well i've ask her for the account and she won't give them to me
S0439	well then she'll give them to dad won't she
S0440	yeah she'll have to cos will need to know
S0439	and anyway grandad wouldn't know if if grandad find out that have spend fifteen grand out of his bank account he'd he'd have something to say about it
S0440	well he yeah he would he would
S0439	it's fraud
S0440	well actually if she do that while he's not live there that become part of the estate
S0439	so you could claim back on it
S0440	so i could claim that but similarly they can turn around and say
S0439	i don't think they cannot if we're do it to benefit him
S0440	no they could do because it say it if you're convert for a granny it can be but i will then argue well hang on a minute you have the ten grand for the car
S0439	car yeah
S0440	er
S0439	now we're even
S0440	so we're even
S0439	fuck off
S0440	and you know
S0439	in your car will depreciate and cost you more money whereas this conversion will add forty grand onto the price of your house
S0440	and that's what right that's what that that's what she'll argue be that it it'll add
S0439	it's your own fault
S0440	well no it's not gonna add any value on because we then have to turn around and pay out of our own
S0439	yeah
S0440	the garage and stuff like this but your father's gotta stop spend money and say oh we'll have a shed here we'll have a garage there we'll have
S0439	well no that be you
S0440	no it's not it's not me
S0439	no he say about the partition be overly expensive he's the one who say about
S0440	but he's the one who he's the one who say about that i don't care about have a cheaper room that doesn't bother me
S0439	but you're not poor
S0440	we're not poor but we've also get to realise that you know we're not load either
S0439	no but i think you're okay at the moment and when grandad come to live with you you're gonna be earn just as much or even slightly more than what you do on your normal salary so
S0439	you're not poor you gotta stop buy handbags
S0440	what that brown one
S0439	who need four handbags
S0440	i have a lovely little black one and your father throw it out
