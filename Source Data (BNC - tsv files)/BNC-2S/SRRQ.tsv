S0558	oh i say to pack your case saturday well pack your case on saturday because if there's anything you need then we've get sunday to go out and get it like you know
S0517	mm oh that's organise
S0558	cos one of his casual jogger trousers type thing
S0517	mm
S0558	he he's wear it must've be cos the only paint i know that 's do be for when she when he do all the fence
S0517	oh when she move in oh well do he have paint on them
S0558	yeah
S0517	oh
S0558	so so he they're fine for around the house like
S0517	oh yeah but also for the fieldwork they're do
S0558	well for the fieldwork yeah erm so i think he's take have he take them when he's out and about in the day oh i don't know but we've get him another pair for of an even when he come back erm
S0517	oh i don't even know what i leave him to it but of course he be out all day saturday on this he have a two day pe thing in park
S0558	oh do he
S0517	orienteering apparently at a level it's harder to get a practical mark in a second subject a second like like like play tennis
S0558	right
S0517	but i mean he have actually get a few to choose from he could do hockey or er but er he could do tennis umpire or all sort but apparently the teachers have say that that they fall down a bite on the grade for the second practical so they have organise an orienteering in the park park they've get an outside company in that be teach them and then they be gonna be assess and it be an opportunity for those that do well to to use that as the grade
S0558	right
S0517	so it be everybody have to go that be do the a level pe so friday and saturday he spend the days in park be rubbish at it and er by all account so be they i think they both fail the
S0558	oh
S0517	the first and second one
S0558	fail he shouldn't with all his scout experience
S0517	well he shouldn't should he really say they be just hopeless between them
S0558	no
S0517	so but i mean he be take it very light heartedly because he didn't need the erm the the grade if you like he just er so of course and i be drive into town on erm saturday and i say i wonder how 's get on send him a text so so send him a text which just say take er take the next right
S0517	then go leave
S0517	and come up how be you get on he say oh well i've fail i've fail level one and level two level three be next and that's the hardest
S0558	oh no
S0517	be there any point but anyway my point be so he didn't get back till like five o clock on saturday
S0558	saturday
S0517	and then of course cos of he'd have all his outdoor clothe and walk boot for those two days orienteering he say will you wash all of this mum for me to take away on monday
S0517	which he didn't actually give to me till sunday morning so he couldn't pack till last night cos i have to wash and dry all of his
S0558	stuff
S0517	stuff that he'd wear the last two days that he want to then take
S0517	typical
S0558	i to be honest i haven't i haven't interfere with he's pack his own case and apart from these joggers
S0517	i do buy him his marigolds though cos that make me laugh
S0558	oh yes
S0517	when it be on the pack list marigolds
S0558	well cos i say to what colour marigolds would you like
S0517	oh right i didn't i just buy yellow i didn't ask actually whether he want pink
S0558	well i well erm i do i do say to you can have yellow pink or blue and he say i'll have blue
S0517	oh
S0558	i couldn't find any blue
S0517	no i haven't see blue for a while actually
S0558	no i haven't no and i know you can because i've get a pair in my under my kitchen sink
S0558	so we end up pick them up from whilst we be at asda and then it be like oh do you want them fleece line
S0558	do you want heavy duty
S0517	who know there be such who know there be such a choice
S0558	do you want plain pink or yellow pink with a line so he he's end up take
S0517	oh
S0558	i think it be a pack cos i say to him you'd be better with the line ones because your hand sweat in them don't they horrible gloves
S0517	yeah they do
S0558	so i say you'd be better with the line ones i say so take them
S0517	mm
S0558	and and if you're you know if you're not that bother he's get a pack of
S0517	oh have he get the disposable ones
S0558	no no no erm just er a pack of the yellow ones
S0517	oh okay okay
S0558	but i think there's two or three pair in there
S0558	so depend on what they're do
S0517	's just go with one
S0558	if he want
S0517	he won't even wear them know him i can't imagine he will
S0558	and when do have his last tetanus
S0517	er i don't know when be he er when do they when er do they have a booster in school
S0558	i don't know but i've get down as a last tetanus for two thousand and two
S0517	and do they last ten years
S0558	well that's what i think
S0517	do they not do they not still remind you do they not have
S0558	well i think they do because when er when i get that date i i need for something i can't remember what it be to put when he'd have his last tetanus so i phone the doctor up and say oh i'm complete this form for school they need it out
S0517	mm
S0558	be you able to help me she say oh yes that's no problem at all tap tap tap tap tell me the date and i say okay i say and do you do a recall when he's due
S0517	mm
S0558	do you recall them in she say yes we do so i'm think with the nature of what they're do i'm assume they're gonna be in soil and ponds and
S0517	i've no idea didn't never even occur to me but the doctor hadn't recall him in for a a booster
S0558	no they haven't
S0517	oh so he must still
S0558	so i'm go i'm gonna i'm go to need to phone and just say
S0517	on the form the medical form we have to fill out before they go it didn't ask do it
S0558	yeah on the one he bring home the weekend
S0517	oh do it
S0558	he bring one home the weekend about erm bedwetting asthma er that sort of thing that they have to take back today
S0517	he hasn't take it back he hasn't take the form back
S0558	they do the one before well they do the one before
S0517	i don't think he give me a form do he give me a form
S0558	it be just one a4 sheet
S0517	he do give me no he give me the clip thing that have the all the information on the thing and that be that and then he and he do say to me oh there's another form
S0558	yes that be about a week or so ago
S0517	but you don't need to send that back cos we've we've do that or something
S0558	yeah
S0517	and that be it
S0558	but no yeah exactly the same but 's bring one home that we have to complete and it be about asthma and
S0517	oh 'll forge it it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest he'll've find that and forge it
S0517	cos it it hasn't come to me i haven't see it

S0517	and do that one say when do they last have their tetanus
S0558	yes that be the one ask the question
S0517	oh well that's
S0558	cos i think to myself oh my goodness me i hope due to the nature of what they're do they don't say oh he can't go on it because he's
S0517	oh no cos they'd've send it way in advance wouldn't they
S0558	well that's what i be think
S0517	they should've
S0558	that's a bite remiss of them isn't it if
S0517	have not we haven't i haven't fill out that form
S0517	i haven't have a call you'd think they'd've collect them up wouldn't you before they set off

S0517	so who who be you take obviously and her friend
S0558	oh that's another lady who's come from athletics
S0517	right
S0558	she she do know where it be but she she say she will make her way to my house
S0517	mm
S0558	because then she she can either jump in with me or somebody else or she can take people because she will have to drive back to anyway
S0517	right right okay
S0558	can't come these be two ladies i sit with every tuesday
S0517	oh okay
S0558	erm can't come cos she work
S0517	mm
S0558	on a wednesday night
S0517	i didn't know whether to mention it to but i sort of want to drop home from football
S0558	yeah i haven't mention it to her
S0517	no perhaps i won't then i'll just ask if she because doesn't finish football till seven
S0558	yeah
S0517	oh i mean we won't be there for seven anyway erm have something to do with at six thirty i think she drop him off at rugby and i say oh 's just finish tennis at rugby which of course be as you now know
S0558	yeah
S0517	across the way
S0558	mm
S0517	so er she say that's fine they'll organise bring home
S0558	right
S0517	and then 'll be ready to go at twenty to seven but doesn't finish football till seven so provide and he's play with 's son so provide maybe 'll drop them both home we just need to sort it out but we likely won't leave the village here till twenty to quarter to seven but that's okay half past seven yeah
S0558	but you'll still be there by half past yeah
S0517	and also i spend so much last time i be there
S0558	yeah
S0558	no no no i know same here
S0517	and talk of spend so much do you get 's text about the neal's yard products the twenty percent off
S0558	twenty percent discount
S0517	and i think you be be you still have the party on the fourth because i can't
S0558	no i can't do this come friday
S0517	yes
S0558	no no no i can't do the fourth
S0517	oh okay
S0558	no that's why i haven't send a text out or anything to anybody
S0517	right
S0558	but potentially well for two reason if i'm honest one it's come home
S0517	yes
S0558	and i'm think oh er he might be in the mood for tell us all about it and i don't wanna miss that opportunity
S0517	and also they've say an eleven o'clock return haven't they but they have also say that that it could be earlier
S0558	it could be earlier
S0517	could be half nine couldn't it and that's right in the middle of the even
S0558	yeah and and if you're host and you're say oh i'll be back in half an hour
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	i do i don't mind but other people might think oh you know
S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	erm and two i be think well if it's before the trip people might spend at neal's yard and may not have any money for
S0517	yes yeah that's true actually
S0558	and if
S0517	yeah
S0558	you know
S0517	well cos i i wasn't there wasn't much i i really particularly want to buy
S0558	so
S0517	and then i think well if you're mad if you there be something not to buy it at twenty percent off
S0558	i know
S0517	so there be something in there for er 's the new mother and baby cos she's get dreadful stretch mark oh god really bad stretch mark
S0558	oh bless her bless her
S0517	but i think a pot of that might be nice and it be it be twenty pound but well twenty percent off you know you may as well get it for sixteen it make sense doesn't it
S0558	absolutely
S0517	so i do just ask that and then i'm think what be i go to order at 's party but if you're not have one then that'll be easier
S0558	well i don't i don't know i be gonna run this by you today i don't know whether to have one on thursday the seventeenth
S0517	thing be will she have get if anybody's wait on christmas present will she have get the order in in time
S0558	don't know cos i say this didn't i i do stipulate
S0517	mm
S0558	look what if people come and nobody buy because of the time of year and
S0517	yes yeah
S0558	you know you don't want it to be a waste even for her but
S0517	i know she want to
S0558	she's not too bother be she
S0517	no she's not she's not or you could just leave it till the new year because by the seventeenth i just don't think people'll be still look for christmas present especially that we then can't take away there and then and have to wait for the order
S0558	but do we just have it as a girly night not even people worry about as a
S0517	oh we could do
S0558	just as a girly get together
S0517	we could do
S0558	what do you think of the seventeenth though
S0517	be that a thursday do you say
S0558	do you think people will come if if they've gotta go to work the next day but then it doesn't have to be a late night do it
S0517	well it's the last day it's the last day for a lot of people isn't it
S0558	the last day for it'll be the last
S0517	yes it probably would be yeah yeah
S0558	shall i do that then
S0517	do it
S0558	i'll check with tonight but he's erm it's the i'm absolutely convince
S0517	oh the friday night
S0558	so he won't need me to pick him up or anything on the thursday night i and i would imagine it'll be scout i think that's the night of the trip so will be out
S0517	oh okay
S0558	erm
S0517	be still do the scout
S0558	no she finish now
S0517	oh she's finish so she won't be there so it'll just be go off to the
S0558	yeah
S0558	yeah
S0517	right
S0558	yeah so for the seventeenth then
S0517	yeah do that
S0517	still don't know what er i mean i do like i do like it and it do feel nice
S0558	mm
S0517	but i'm still very happy with what i currently use
S0558	mm to be honest with you i couldn't afford to buy that
S0517	i might i might
S0558	i mean i'm have my nail do now on a regular basis and
S0517	i know it's quite
S0558	it's it's have to come in it's have to come out the shop money

S0517	no well you need to get earn some extra
