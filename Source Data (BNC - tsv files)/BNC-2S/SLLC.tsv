S0440	no
S0439	have get two now now 's only get hasn't she
S0440	one yeah well but won't go and see him won't come and see him this be what annoy me about you know
S0439	our family be just horrible people
S0439	well they aren't i dunno they're not horrible they just don't and and just don't get me wrong i don't see my grandparents as much as i should do but i don't live fifteen minutes away from them you know if i if i live as close to nana as what do i'd go up and see her every week
S0440	well and absolutely piss me off
S0439	like it's because we don't live close to our grandparents if we live round the corner you'd make an effort to go see them every week wouldn't you you just would
S0440	well i mean i get really angry with er with when we be talk about the erm we be talk about the thirty thousand she want to borrow for her house
S0439	yeah
S0440	have already ask her do you want
S0439	i know i know yeah
S0440	he think and and that annoy me intensely

S0439	yeah dad isn't hold the money i mean he's not
S0440	no no i know
S0439	he's not make prevent you from do it
S0440	but but he he tell her he be make a an investment
S0439	yeah he's just invest it he's look after it he's not spend it like that's why i think like grandad grandad just trust dad i wouldn't trust with the money
S0439	and i think the difference be because dad have money and didn't have the money and therefore there's that always that element of
S0440	yeah
S0439	like lack of trust
S0440	yeah
S0439	but cos dad's get his own money
S0440	yeah yeah yeah there's erm a a system now where parent can give a deposit and children can have a deposit and you can get a preferential loan for buy a house so
S0439	mm
S0440	your father want you to look into that if you're stay in cambridge for any length of time so that
S0439	he could look into that anyway just rent it out
S0440	no you can't rent it out
S0439	oh
S0440	but you you could have it and rent it out rent a room out that's not a problem
S0439	i dunno how long i want to live in cambridge
S0440	i know you don't but you don't have to rent the room out permanently you can just say to someone you know till i'm live in cambridge and then you can sell it after that
S0439	yeah but i don't know if i even wanna stay in cambridge i don't know how long i want to be
S0440	i know i know but the thing be look at it because if eventually it would then mean that we could buy it off you okay
S0439	okay
S0440	but you can get preferential rate mortgage rat and everything and save rat it's really erm you know
S0439	so well 's buy a house in london and obviously that's london so different but like her council tax be really high her erm everything's really high she have to pay content insurance like own a house be a lot of money
S0440	own a house be a lot of money but it's also if you don't get in this erm if you don't get into the house market some time you'll never get in
S0439	quite negative view but okay
S0440	it isn't that's the true deal with it nowadays it's really get difficult
S0439	i don't i wouldn't wanna house that i couldn't rent because i don't know how long i wanna stay
S0440	no you can't rent it out immediately okay you can rent it out eventually but you can't rent it out immediately
S0439	well then find a house you want and i'll buy it under under my name but you have it
S0440	okay
S0439	can have it as like an investment property then
S0440	mm but you'd have to move into it
S0439	well yeah yeah fine
S0440	and then you can leave
S0439	and i could leave when i want to
S0440	and then you could rent a room out to someone as well while you you know while if you get a two bedroom house
S0439	how long will i have to live in it till i could leave
S0440	probably a probably a year
S0439	i can do that
S0440	mm
S0439	if you and dad find a house you want and you can buy it under my name and use that scheme
S0440	mm
S0439	that doesn't bother me but i don't i'm not buy a property for me
S0440	i know you're not
S0439	like if you and dad want a retirement you know i think property be a good thing to do property be a great thing to do it's what the s do the s take some a lump sum out of their pension or something and they bring two flats in to rent to students
S0440	mm mm
S0439	i think they make er something be say something like her mum charge nine hundred pound a month or something for her that person to live in that house
S0440	mm mm mm
S0439	so but like it's it's a good place to buy a house like house will go up in cambridge like you won't have any problem ever resell
S0440	absolutely
S0439	or make money on it but yeah no i'll take my my back

S0439	so you
S0440	we can rent out 's house we wouldn't bother sell it we'd rent it out
S0439	no you'd rent it out
S0440	we rent it out
S0439	cos there isn't a mortgage on it be there she they pay it off
S0440	but er
S0439	so
S0440	yeah there's no mortgage on it
S0439	you know that's a what that's a hundred and fifty grand sit there
S0440	absolutely so you would rent it out
S0439	rent it out
S0440	erm
S0439	you and dad and would just have a bank account with the money go to if anybody need to take money out of it they could you know you'd be wouldn't you
S0440	you'd rent that out you could easily rent that out for five six hundred pound a month
S0439	yeah after a year you'd have what seven grand that's three grand each for dad and
S0440	yeah yeah
S0439	nice little money earner really isn't it so
S0440	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0439	there's no point sell it when you can make money out of it
S0440	and you've still get oh you've still get your capital
S0439	yeah
S0440	no absolutely you know it's that be
S0439	it'd be foolish of them to sell it
S0440	absolutely
S0439	but if didn't want it i guess dad could buy her half but still quite a bite of money isn't it you wouldn't be able to afford that
S0440	no you wouldn't sell it you wouldn't no he wouldn't buy while be alive you wouldn't sell it anyway
S0439	no no no no of course not
