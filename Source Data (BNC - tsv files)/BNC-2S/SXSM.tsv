S0529	and then i would have to pay back probably like what i've spend in maintenance this year so far
S0530	mm
S0529	like all of it
S0530	yeah
S0529	they expect all of it back erm and i dunno about the fee or
S0530	but the thing be if you're in overdraft you can't pay it back like literally you have no money
S0529	no no i literally can't so what they'd have to do be they'd have to do what i do last year when i didn't have enough money and they just take it out of the bank like five pound a month or something but my mum's take on that from last year and she still have it like she's still pay five pound a month
S0530	really
S0529	to pay off last year's money and i can't ask her to do it again
S0530	mm
S0529	she can't afford it like
S0530	no
S0529	she's skint you know we're not in a good financial situation to deal with this and i would feel like just horrendous you know cos it would be a horrendous thing to do like to
S0530	but you're not horrendous
S0529	but i would have to get a job
S0530	they're horrendous
S0529	i know
S0530	but yeah
S0529	i would have to get a job there'd be no alternative i couldn't like you know get all upset and anxious about it i would have to do it but it's just really scary
S0530	god it suck doesn't it student finance
S0529	yes it really do
S0530	why can't you just leave uni if you it's not for you and just
S0529	why can't you pay it back in twenty years
S0530	yeah
S0529	when everyone else pay it back
S0530	yeah
S0529	you know
S0530	cos you still you'd still pay for it technically
S0529	that's yeah yeah i'm still gonna have to pay for it i'm this isn't even like like cos some of the money you do pay back in twenty years whenever when you have enough money so there's that as well from like the fee or something
S0530	mm
S0529	i have to pay back later so it's not it's not it wouldn't just be pay off from that five pound a month it's
S0530	mm
S0529	more than that but i don't know how much i've spend this term probably about a grand more than that two grand i expect yeah cos how much be accommodation
S0530	accommodation i'm not sure the thing be if i think if you leave potentially if you leave at christmas you'd if you do choose to leave at christmas then you'd have less to pay back because it's when you're it i think it's all time when your loan instalments come in i have to pay a lot of money because i my next instalment have like literally just come in but obviously you get a new instalment in january don't you
S0529	mm
S0530	so
S0529	no i wouldn't hang about if i be gonna leave i wouldn't leave it until after christmas
S0530	mm
S0529	i know that like this be all hypothetical by the way like i'm not i'm just i just worry about all the implications
S0530	all
S0529	of it like
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	whether i or not i be think about leave or not cos i
S0530	you just think of all the options
S0529	you know i still be a bite but i'm also want to you know i yeah it's just the options be a bite terrify at the moment
S0530	i don't know if how helpful this be but
S0529	you don't have to try and be helpful
S0530	no no
S0530	i'm not even try i just think of it if you stay or if you don't stay it's not forever
S0529	yeah i know
S0530	it's not like a legacy you're not gonna be come to like yeah i have to come back here ever after university you probably won't
S0529	mm
S0530	but yeah
S0529	yeah i do think last night like would it really be terrible if i just stay for three years and didn't enjoy myself and always struggle with the work but eventually do it after like a few extensions each time or whatever cos i'd still have like people who be nice to live with and i'd still have financial security and i'd still have like you know a place to act my age and not have to go into work yet and
S0530	well you be here
S0530	you have a chance to kind of cocoon yourself a bite you know
S0529	exactly
S0530	like and you can learn skills but also not push yourself too far kind of thing
S0529	yeah
S0530	you know
S0529	like i know i'm say i'm have a horrible time but it's it's honestly just the academic side like not the
S0530	just the academic
S0529	horrible otherwise cos it's i mean it's pretty cushy like all we do be sit around and you know we don't have to pay bill we don't have to pay back money off anyone
S0530	we're just
S0530	board school students basically
S0529	yeah
S0530	go off to campus
S0529	yeah and i don't think i realise that last year when i go home like how different it would be
S0530	because when er i think when i drop out last year the thing that hit me when i leave uni i felt like imagine like be a spider on a web and then have that that web like rip from you you're just like you're just nothing
S0529	yeah
S0530	you're just yeah
S0529	absolutely but i be expect to be like a grow up i be expect to be really responsible and
S0530	that's the thing
S0530	they expect like this transformation like
S0529	and
S0530	right you've mess this up
S0529	yeah
S0530	why don't you get a job
S0529	i know
S0530	and it's like it's not that simple
S0529	it's just like my family have no idea how how mentally ill the the entire thing have make me you know i just couldn't cope with any of it and it it just must have look like such an excuse like
S0530	yeah to somebody
S0529	from their perspective
S0530	that doesn't understand
S0529	yeah
S0530	what it can make you feel
S0529	it must like to my mum i must just have just look like an absolutely lazy sod like i just wouldn't get out of bed i wouldn't do anything i would say i couldn't get a job and you know it be just horrible you know it make you like realise how like gently university students be treat by society as well
S0530	yeah yeah it's like ease you into the harsh realities
S0529	yeah the harsh realities yeah
S0530	because
S0529	when you're at university
S0530	it be gonna happen
S0529	but you don't have to pay for you don't have to pay for like doctor things like prescriptions and you don't have to pay things back you don't have to do any of that
S0530	uhu no
S0529	you you just get to live in this bubble
S0530	we do we do
S0529	for three years
S0530	it's a good life hazel grace sorry i don't like that book oh dear get my hair cut again this weekend
S0529	be you
S0530	yeah get my fringe trim and i actually think i'm gonna get my hair a bite shorter
S0529	oh yeah it's get longer and again and you've start like put it to the side
S0530	yeah
S0529	no you could get it shorter that would look really cool
S0530	like i have it in a like here
S0529	mm
S0530	before
S0529	yeah like chin length
S0530	yeah
S0529	that be nice
S0530	it be cool
S0529	look really cool
S0530	cos i use to say that i'd never like when i be younger and i grow my hair out from a bob i say i'd never get a like short hair again
S0529	mm
S0530	and that's what that's what i do
S0529	yeah me too actually like i have a bob when i be about erm fourteen i think that i cut my hair really short and then i be like never ever again
S0530	yeah
S0529	and i grow it out
S0530	yeah
S0529	for like three years and then last year when i get back i be like no cut my hair off don't care and i love it like it be so good it do actually look really nice for a while like when i make an effort with it like when it be this short
S0530	mm
S0529	but then sometimes because my hair's so thick and big it make it look a bite like triangular at the same time
S0529	like yours be easier cos it's like it's a little bite thinner
S0530	mm
S0529	so you can
S0530	yeah
S0529	do more with it
S0530	i'd rather have thick hair to be honest like
S0529	oh no i dunno it's not that great i mean it's not it's not even that thick like my auntie say it's like fine hair but it's also thick so it like it's not wiry it's just sort of i dunno quite big voluminous
S0530	voluminous
S0529	yeah i mean not now it's like really lank like this length cos i just don't do anything with it i'm just wait for it to grow but then i kind of wanna cut it again
S0530	get a haircut can actually make you feel better
S0529	it can but then all that work
S0529	over this year try to grow it again just to get it cut
S0530	oh do you consciously try and grow it out
S0529	yeah i be this be what i'm do now i'm grow it out like from cos at the begin of the year it be like up here
S0530	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0529	it be it be about chin length actually at one point
S0530	do you decide you didn't like it or do you just want a change
S0529	no i just felt like i'd have it short for like i dunno about half a year so i
S0530	mm
S0529	kind of go yeah let's just grow it out now
S0530	mm
S0529	and that's the thing like when you get cut cut short you love it and then you start to miss your long hair and
S0530	yeah
S0529	vice versa
S0530	yeah
S0529	like when it get longer like this it's like oh my hair be so cool and style and nice and it's just the middle bite when it's like nothing and you
S0530	mm
S0529	just have to wait for it to grow
S0530	mm
S0529	into something you like even the colour's dull
S0530	it's not dull your hair's a lovely colour
S0529	but it use to be so much nicer than this it use to be like gold but it's just get darker as i've like get older i suppose
S0530	age
S0529	mm yeah
S0530	i'd call it pretty golden now to be honest like
S0529	mm it's kind of green in this light
S0530	green

S0530	oh my god how be that even possible seventy three people like my picture of me in the
S0529	you're just so famous
S0530	so famous lol
S0529	i hardly ever get double figure it's a sad life
S0530	i think it's only because i have a a lot of people in my school a lot of people at my old university that i've get
S0529	have you
S0530	on facebook
S0529	yeah
S0530	a lot of people well actually not that many people here surprisingly it's
S0529	you have friends
S0530	i do have friends but surprisingly i've get
S0529	mm
S0530	like apart from you lot you and then a couple of people on my course
S0529	mm
S0530	like i don't feel like i've get enough friends here that
S0529	oh
S0530	or as many that i think i'd have
S0529	oh
S0530	well not it's not it's not like i expect to have load of friends but in my old uni like there be tons of people like
S0529	in your group and stuff
S0530	i just spend time with
S0529	yeah
S0530	like with and it be just like we all kind of know each other and here it's like a lot more segment if that's a word
S0529	the word
S0530	segment like i be happy well i don't know if i'm well i don't i don't want to analyse whether i'm happy because that make me unhappy
S0529	mm
S0530	think about too much whether i be happy here you know but
S0529	well i don't know you don't have to be happy though i don't think i mean you don't have to be cop
S0530	yeah i feel like i'm cop
S0529	yeah
S0530	i've not have any breakdowns like do at my old uni which be good like i use to like get up in the morning and like just cry for no reason
S0529	oh
S0530	and i i kind of have like i don't know if it's fair on people to call them panic attack but i think they probably be because i just couldn't like i be
S0529	why be it unfair
S0530	gasp
S0529	on people
S0530	well i dunno like some people say they they literally feel like they're go to die and i didn't i just felt like
S0529	no that's just like
S0530	i be gasp
S0529	oh but i think you can get be it you can get er anxiety attack and panic attack or be they the same thing
S0530	i think they be the same but
S0530	maybe they be different
S0529	but like a panic attack can for some people mean like yeah you feel like you're about to die and it feel like really you know your your body's just react really badly to something but also
S0530	mm
S0529	it can just be like really heavy breathe and
S0530	yeah
S0529	feel quite
S0530	yeah
S0529	like not in control of the way you're you're kind of act and i think that count
S0530	that's good then
S0529	yeah
S0529	it's a valid panic attack or anxiety attack yeah don't worry about do that cos my friend she's like really melodramatic and she use to have panic attack all the time and
S0530	be they not real panic attack
S0529	they weren't real panic attack she be just really like that bless her
S0530	ah
S0529	she's a nice girl but she be very dramatic
S0530	be it just like a phrase she use like it's a panic attack or would she actually do she actually
S0529	she
S0530	believe it be a panic attack
S0529	she do believe like she would get really over over the top about it like she would breathe like a die llama and it be just like you're not you i know you're make this up

S0529	mm
S0530	you sort of grow out it
S0529	yeah well i kind of haven't grow out of it actually i do quite i i do lie quite a lot still but it's mostly just to stop
S0530	things from
S0529	things from like
S0530	yeah
S0529	get worse than they need to be
S0530	yeah i think you you lie for different reason when you're older
S0529	yeah
S0530	when you're younger you kind of lie to show off
S0529	yeah
S0530	and when you're older if you lie it's to try er escape things
S0529	yeah exactly
S0530	which you kind of use it in a different sense so it's not quite i wouldn't call it compulsive lie i'd say that it's more
S0529	necessary
S0530	yeah there we go
S0529	i can't stand to look at my shoe any longer i need to clean them they're so muddy
S0530	oh

S0530	yeah but sometimes they get too wet to wear and i have to leave them for a few days
S0529	i'll never get the mud out of this bite
S0530	you will just put them in the sink
S0529	might have to do that yeah sorry do you wanna like put a film on or something

S0529	ah
S0530	it's like you understand my pain
S0529	that's cute
S0530	he be like meow oh i just can't wait to give him a big kiss i can't believe i i couldn't i didn't think i'd manage to last a month without him
S0530	and i have and it's crazy
S0529	have it be a month since you go home
S0530	yeah
S0529	mm
S0530	i mean the thing be like er people don't understand how much my little kitty mean to me like
S0529	no
S0530	he come to me at a time of my life when i be very depress
S0529	ah
S0530	he come on the day that i get my medication
S0529	really
S0530	for the first time
S0529	ah
S0530	like he just turn up and i just think it be i don't believe in fate

S0529	well it be fate
S0530	it be fate that he come
S0530	and he make me like even when i be miserable er he didn't stop me from be depress but he make it a hell of a lot better
S0529	yeah they really pet really do have a huge impact i think on people's health i think
S0530	mm yeah definitely like sometimes instead of lie in my bed i'd just come downstairs mm to my conservatory and just lie on the rug and the cat would just
S0529	yeah
S0530	lie would just lie next to me
S0529	well see if like
S0530	and just snuggle up
S0529	you be live on your own and you be like really depress but you have a pet
S0530	yeah
S0529	like an obligation to like you know walk them or
S0530	you'd have a purpose
S0529	and that would be
S0530	kind of
S0529	something to get you out of bed
S0530	yeah
S0529	you know like cos you you'd love them so much that you wouldn't wanna neglect them like that so it's
S0529	i think they're really helpful i think they should get them
S0530	definitely
S0529	for depress people
S0530	yes
S0529	in hospitals instead of instead of medication just give them a cat or a dog
S0530	ah
S0529	and send them on their way
S0530	like here have a free pet well there's certainly lot of pet out there that need home
S0529	i know exactly like there be so many like stray animals and things that get take in and yeah it's mad i dunno if they're just wet or if they're actually clean do you think
S0530	they look clean to me
S0529	cos sometimes they look like that cos
S0530	they look very shiny the
S0529	the mud like come back after you've get them wet
S0530	mm occasionally but they look clean to me
S0529	yeah
S0530	i forget about your cornish flag in the corner of your room

S0530	oh yes all this serious shit
S0529	who care about that i don't give a shit to be honest
S0530	to be honest like what be the point of read
S0529	i'll just say go if you
S0530	things that be
S0529	if you if you don't
S0530	prestigious
S0529	yeah exactly it's just up yourself really
S0530	like they're not necessarily better
S0529	like read whatever make you happy read harry potter make me feel nice and so i do it
S0530	it make you feel warm and safe
S0529	it really do
S0530	and happy
S0529	cos you remember how it be when you be read it when you be younger and it be like it be just really excite
S0530	it be just childhood
S0529	you get that back yeah
S0530	i mean those book be gonna go into like down in generations they're think of make
S0529	they really be
S0530	a new harry potter like new
S0529	what a book
S0530	no no update the new film like make new ones in the future
S0529	really
S0530	yeah
S0529	already
S0530	mm
S0529	bloody hell i think it would take them like twenty years at least to
S0530	yeah yeah it's not gonna be release for about
S0529	no
S0530	twenty years but they're already
S0529	oh that's alright
S0530	think about it
S0529	yeah so they should like they need to update them
S0530	i mean how would they do it differently they could make it darker or even darker than it be
S0529	no i don't think they would i think they'd actually no cos it be a lot of film isn't it like cos like cos they remake stuff like star war and star trek and all those things but they're short like they're just
S0530	yeah
S0529	like for film
S0530	yeah
S0529	but this would be like how many film be there like eight
S0530	yeah
S0529	eight film
S0530	they wouldn't compress it into like one
S0529	well they couldn't that would be so many hours
S0530	oh my god that would be just like
S0529	that would be impossible
S0530	really vast it would just be like no that would be crap if they compress it into one film
S0529	yeah
S0530	can you imagine
S0529	but i don't really understand why cinema hasn't really evolve to make longer film because people would watch them i think
S0530	yeah definitely
S0529	like feel if i be invest in something like say if it be adapt from like my favourite book or something
S0530	mm
S0529	and it be gonna be like a four hour film so that they could fit everything in without split it up i would go see it
S0530	but then again
S0529	and i'd probably enjoy it
S0530	in term of money they can put more film on in cinemas
S0529	well yeah exactly that's all it's about it's just about make money now it's like oh look we can we can charge like double for one like production cost
S0530	mm
S0529	like we've make the film together we just chop it in half halfway through
S0530	and they could have more show as well with just smaller hours like
S0529	yeah
S0530	mm
S0529	you know it's a horrible thing
S0530	i wish i wonder what sort of film they'll have in how many years
S0529	in the future
S0530	ten years yeah like
S0529	yeah
S0530	you know they've get 3d film do you think they'll have
S0529	i hope i hope 3d die
S0530	i
S0529	i really do
S0530	i swear they've get they're gonna or they've already get just in very like a small number of place like you can smell the film and stuff like
S0529	oh yeah cos er erm the er there's a
S0530	like sense
S0529	thing in call like no it's at it's like kind of like this weird place in and they have a cinema there and i go to see like a film and it be like a really shit animate film that i go to see with like my little cousin
S0530	mm
S0529	but it it be like a you sit in chair and like you have like water stream up like
S0530	oh my god
S0529	in your face and stuff like cos it be it be set on like a pirate ship or something
S0530	wow
S0529	so it's suppose to be like a simulation it's call like 4d but it's not 4d it's
S0530	it's not quite 4d it's just
S0529	just like you get splash in the face sometimes and and your seat shudder a bite and it's quite fun
S0530	imagine if there be like
S0529	it be pretty cool actually
S0530	more like that like more
S0529	yeah
S0530	film make like that
S0529	there probably will be yeah like for stuff like like jurassic park and things like that
S0530	oh yeah
S0529	that be like really
S0530	you'd want the full experience
S0529	yeah
S0530	like i can kind of see the appeal
S0529	and imax as well
S0530	for yeah
S0529	that would be good
S0530	cos jurassic park would be
S0529	a good one to start with
S0530	3d a good one to do
S0529	yeah
S0530	something like that cos it's er all about the
S0529	or when the new avatar come out that would be good
S0530	be there a new avatar come out

S0529	or i sometimes move it if there's no room but it's it's always there
S0530	woo it's really sad that we wait for the apprentice for the whole week we're just like the apprentice
S0529	i don't wait for it the whole week
S0530	as in like our highlight of television at the
S0529	yeah
S0530	university experience
S0529	well it be my life really though
S0530	television be just life
S0529	i don't actually watch the tv anymore i just watch stuff on iplayer and
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	apparently though they're gonna start charge for it because people keep dodge the licence fee by just use iplayer and not pay it
S0530	no
S0529	cos you do have to pay for iplayer at the moment but they say on the news they're gonna try and close that loophole
S0530	really
S0529	so people might have to start pay for it
S0530	what pay to watch things back
S0529	mm mm
S0530	or watch live tv
S0529	just well any of it like to watch iplayer at all
S0530	that's horrible
S0529	yeah i mean it make sense though because they're not make any money off the licence if people keep dodge it by just not pay it and then go on iplayer anyway
S0530	i guess but it's just
S0529	but i kind of get why they ask us for money because like it's a public service like
S0530	mm
S0529	you know i don't know
S0530	but it's just like
S0529	but it be quite a lot though it's a hundred pound
S0530	what they're charge a hundred pound oh the tv
S0529	that's how much the licence fee be
S0530	how and you just have to pay that initially
S0529	a year
S0530	a year
S0529	yeah
S0530	oh god so i wonder how much you i'll type it in
S0529	and that's that's why
S0530	pay
S0529	we get bbc like that's how we
S0530	for iplayer
S0529	how they keep go
S0530	oh my god yeah i i think i do hear about this
S0529	mm
S0530	i just wanna see how much i'm curious how much they'd actually pay oh my god it will be carefully consider this summer
S0529	well
S0530	be this this summer as in like oh that be oh it's it would have be i bet they've think about it then
S0529	oh right
S0530	oh god
S0529	mm
S0530	that mean i'll have to watch like yeah they'll tax young people they won't tax older people
S0529	mm i mean cos it
S0530	i think young
S0529	the only it's only the the young people do it anyway like use iplayer instead like we do it
S0530	sorry i just hate everything oh jeremy corbyn ha why jeremy corbyn be apparently unfit to become prime minister be you you're a corbyn supporter you want corbyn good
S0529	uhu
