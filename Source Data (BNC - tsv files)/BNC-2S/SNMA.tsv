S0423	well he he didn't but i mean he be say on the way oh erm i think i might be charge i say no don't be silly you're not you won't be charge then then the receptionist say you should have be send a letter
S0421	yeah
S0423	and then i have a look at it and i think oh right and then erm i think grandad explain that he do send away
S0421	yeah the the document
S0421	cos he get a letter on monday and our postman come at midday sometimes our postman come at three o clock in the afternoon so that's when we get this letter and it be like oh if you don't send us these photocopy you may be charge but even if you do send us these photocopy you still may be charge if you're not eligible erm so yeah anyway we've not get so grandad have to go yesterday to to get these photocopy like cos the post office the local post office doesn't do it neither do the newsagents so he get them and he send them off erm and it say we we get it on monday and then it say they need to have it by thursday which be it's a bite short notice really isn't it
S0423	oh yeah so they must have a note on the system cos she say oh you need to be interview by another supervisor or erm they must have have a note say may be not entitle to treatment
S0421	yeah
S0423	and to you know wait for the interview but this this receptionist a little bite of information she get it all blow out of proportion she start say
S0421	i know yeah
S0423	she start make up her own things
S0421	that's what reception oh right do you you know that you know that reception
S0421	well cos you know when we go to the doctor's and they wouldn't take us and then we be and
S0423	yeah
S0421	and they be like no you're not in our area so we ring the nhs and they be like you they should've take you
S0423	yeah i know
S0421	and then the surgery say oh no it never happen they never come in
S0423	mm
S0421	well mammy leave a review on the nhs website for that surgery and she say how disappoint she be with the receptionist that they didn't take them on
S0423	mm
S0421	and she the the surgery reply and say i'm sorry but you weren't in our catchment area so they actually acknowledge that we go on the website so now mammy be send a formal complaint she's write an email
S0423	yeah now they've admit it yeah
S0421	yeah cos now they've admit that she's be
S0423	mm
S0421	how stupid be that if you're go to deny that someone's be and then answer their comment on the internet say oh well our system wouldn't accept you
S0423	well it just show you that this woman this morning
S0421	yeah
S0423	they go in say oh he's go to have to pay and i say well erm he's he he's an e u citizen
S0421	yeah
S0423	and she say oh that that doesn't mean he doesn't have to pay he that doesn't give you everything erm i say well i've get a a card and when i go to europe i i i think that i could have whatever treatment's need and she say no no that'll just cover a consultation
S0423	i say oh right oh i didn't know that
S0421	no
S0423	and then it get me think oh maybe
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos then she say oh when i be in amsterdam erm i have to go and see a doctor and i have to pay but it didn't you know it it just cover me for the erm the consultation
S0421	yeah
S0423	so then erm so then oh right erm i say oh i i think with the er with the card you get whatever treatment it's a reciprocal arrangement you get whatever treatments you need and she say no i have to pay for my prescription in amsterdam they say well
S0421	you pay for it over here as well
S0423	well well you pay a a set fee
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	but in other european countries a lot of them you pay whatever the medicine cost
S0421	yeah
S0423	and i say well yeah in lot of european countries you have to pay for a prescription that's what that so obviously all you have to pay be for the prescription
S0421	yeah
S0423	so she wasn't charge for treatment cos she probably didn't have treatment so you know she's just make things up herself cos i say well he's you know he's he's get the card and say oh that's er that doesn't mean this be very expensive you know and i say yeah but we have a reciprocal arrangement with eu countries and she say erm well no no you can't just have anything if if if you just have them treat be allow to be treat for anything we'd be full of people come over for treatment
S0423	it's just make up our own thing
S0421	yeah but you'd get treat for free at home
S0423	i i mean i can't quite think well yeah you basically we bill them anyway
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	so your grandad's think oh well can they invoice me i'll go and see the medical people that i've get back home in i think just wait for the the interview because i just think she doesn't know what she's on about but then i say oh have you get that letter so i start read that that letter
S0421	yeah
S0423	kind of indicate that he might have to pay because
S0421	yeah
S0423	it say if you're not normally resident
S0421	yeah
S0423	i think you know i can't believe this yeah
S0421	it's ridiculous isn't it
S0423	so then anyway this this person come for the interview say oh it's just that we hadn't receive the eye grandad say oh he's send it off
S0421	yeah
S0423	erm monday but she say okay if you've get the the nhs thing in your passport i'll just make a copy of that for them to come back and say right okay that's all we need
S0423	it's she didn't mention anything oh you might have to pay you have to pay erm you know and this receptionist
S0421	i know
S0423	they're they're bloody they're ridiculous receptionists you give them a bite of information
S0421	i know yeah
S0423	they think they have you know they they just so stupid
S0421	like whenever whenever we ring up for the doctor's they're like oh so what be it that's wrong and then if you tell them they're like right well we can't that doesn't sound very serious so we can't make erm an appointment for you
S0423	so they have to be half dead
S0421	yeah well so
S0423	well you know i think they be tell by doctor now to ask that it's a bite intrusive isn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	especially if you just walk in and just want to make an appointment
S0421	yeah
S0423	and you have to say what's wrong in front of the wait room
S0421	you you could just lie
S0423	mm
S0421	because erm i don't know what i be go in for it think it be something around my ear or something
S0423	mm
S0421	and erm it didn't hurt or anything but it be a bite fuzzy or something the sound
S0423	mm
S0421	and erm yeah but it it be really annoy me so mammy be like yeah well we'll ring in the morning and you can go in and erm at first she say oh yeah it's just eh that's what she say and the receptionist be like right well we'll make you an appointment in two weeks or something
S0423	jesus
S0421	and then so mammy be like yeah but she's in a lot of pain you know she can't sleep at night and she's like oh oh right then you can come in this morning
S0423	mm
S0423	so you just have to tell them you're in pain
S0421	yeah but then when you go into the doctor's it's just like they don't mind like
S0423	yeah
S0421	they they don't know what you've say
S0423	yeah
S0421	and the receptionist think oh you know like but like for all like if someone's go in and they're like not necessarily in pain and they can see something that's wrong with them and then the receptionist like oh no you're go to have to wait two they might be in agony by the time they've wait two weeks
S0423	yeah
S0421	they don't know what it be
S0423	i think it be it i mean they do have problems cos i think it be sort of a lot of people go in there's nothing wrong with the and they're just try to weed out people aren't they so i know why they're do it but it's very frustrate if if you do have a problem and it's like they're try to not see you isn't it
S0421	yeah i know but you'd rather people who don't have anything wrong with them go rather than people think oh there might not be nothing there might be nothing wrong with me so they don't go and then they end up with like a problem
S0423	yeah yeah i just think cos they be under a lot of pressure aren't they
S0421	yeah but if you look up anything online it's like you should have this see by a doctor
S0423	yeah well that's why you shouldn't look anything up online
S0423	should just go to the doctor if you're ill don't bother look it up online
S0421	no but if you look up something and you're like oh right i've have like a pain or something erm
S0423	yeah but if you look up anything they tend to tell you you'll be dead in a few minutes
S0423	if you don't get see go to the doctor immediately
S0421	no they don't always no but some
S0423	well well a lot of the time they do
S0421	no but sometimes there's something and it's like oh erm it could be nothing but go and see the doctor anyway
S0423	yeah it's a it's it could be nothing or you could be about to have a brain haemorrhage
S0423	so you better go immediately
S0423	cos that's probably for a headache or
S0421	yeah
S0423	oh our 's have to go to the hospital she have problems breathe and have pain in her chest and and erm
S0421	really
S0423	i think she call an ambulance out er she have a problem ah she be go back home
S0421	yeah
S0423	she have a problem breathe so they come out to the ambulance and they say oh can't find anything wrong it must be just a panic attack
S0423	she have pain in her chest but then afterwards it carry on so she go to the doctor's
S0421	yeah
S0423	and the doctor check her chest and say well there doesn't seem to be anything there i'll give you some antibiotics cos he hear like a rattle noise
S0421	yeah
S0423	when he be listen to her chest and assume it must be an infection and then erm she she be still in pain like quite a bite of pain so she she ring the doctor again i think the doctor do say if it's not right at a certain time come back and or ring me
S0421	yeah
S0423	or so she ring him i think have a phone consultation or something so he arrange for her to have an x ray so the x ray erm she's have to stay in hospital cos the wall of her lung be puncture
S0423	there's a hole in it so it's amaze isn't it
S0421	i know
S0423	cos i mean i guess pain in your chest and problem breathe they must have listen to her heart and check if there be any problems there
S0421	mm
S0423	so it wasn't until they do the x ray cos it continue that and they say tall young skinny females it can happen to them
S0421	mm
S0423	i don't know whether it's cos of your rib cage skeleton or something
S0421	maybe
S0423	on the outside you're a of your lung or something but
S0421	cos it's unusual that cos usually you can get a puncture lung if you break a rib
S0423	well yeah i think first when i hear i think she'd be involve in an accident
S0421	yeah
S0423	you know it's usually only if you've have an accident
S0421	yeah you break a rib and then it puncture your lung yeah
S0423	but yeah supposedly tall and skinny sort of slim young girls get it and erm i don't know it must be cause some must be to do with the everything be so tight in there i don't know
S0421	yeah maybe yeah maybe if you've get like quite erm
S0421	if you're not like you're necessarily like skinny as in like lose weight or something but like have a generally skinny frame
S0423	yeah and that's what it be
S0421	do you know what i mean cos some people do yeah
S0423	so they have to cut a hole in her side and put something on it to let
S0421	er
S0423	cos there be air build up on her side of her her lung and have to let the air escape so it's not work it's like something but so they've have to put a new one on last night so that there's a slight suction so that will suck out so yeah it be best check things isn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	if you have get a persistent something that's not go away you need to make sure you persist and say well this isn't still a problem
S0421	yeah because there be this child erm and their parent take them to six different doctor and each one say there's nothing wrong with them some of them say it's a flu some of them say it be or you know it be just a cold one of them even say it be like some psychological problems or something and then the child die because it be like i don't know it be like tuberculosis or something
S0423	really
S0421	yeah and they go to six different doctor
S0423	mm i mean it it must be a hard job be a doctor isn't it
S0421	i know but
S0423	but everyone seem to be have medical problems 's be off work he's get kidney infection your grandad
S0421	do they keep you awake while they cut a hole in you
S0423	yeah they give her erm a sedative
S0423	so erm be like a local anaesthetic but you're awake
S0421	i don't understand why do they not just put people asleep
S0423	well they're reluctant to do that unless it's absolutely necessary because that can cause complications in itself have an anaesthetic
S0421	i know but
S0423	some people react against it can have an effect on your heart on you know it it do have some dangers people go asleep doesn't it use to be a very they'd always put people asleep routine of things wasn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	now they're not they're a bite more reluctant now they tend to give keep you awake for a lot of stuff unless it's kind of a major operation i think
S0421	i just don't know how people do it while they're awake
S0423	i think 's be at hospital like she's well that's just a consultation she want she's go to have her tonsils out
S0421	oh do she want them out
S0423	well she's always off she's have it all the time yeah
S0421	oh from tonsillitis
S0423	and er so they think that it's best to have them out cos she's keep get it back all the time
S0421	oh i'd rather just suffer i wouldn't have them out
S0423	well no it's a routine operation if you're if you're have tonsillitis all the time then you would want them out cos it's not good
S0421	no because nothing's worse than have an operation
S0423	well no it's it's not that bad you soon get over it and then you never have a problem with your tonsils again do you
S0421	cos no but you have to suffer they get like a knife on you and they like
S0423	you don't know anything though do you
S0421	well they do they get a knife
S0423	but you don't know anything about that do you
S0421	course you do oh do they put you asleep for that
S0423	i would imagine they would unless the technique be different now
S0421	cos they don't for erm
S0423	maybe they don't
S0421	a
S0423	mm yeah it's consider routine as well now so it's possible that they don't we might actually be on time
S0421	no but if people be awake while they're like cut them open do they not just start scream
S0423	why would you you wouldn't feel anything
S0421	no but you would know i would just be like scream
S0423	why
S0421	cos i'm get cut open
S0423	yeah but you don't know do you
S0421	yeah but i do because they've just tell me they're about to cut me open
S0423	well what's wrong with that
S0421	it's awful er i don't wanna be
S0423	the only problem be if you're in pain and if it's not go to cause you pain then i don't see the problem with it they're do it to help you
S0421	i know but
S0423	it's not as if they're do it oh let's just cut this little girl open for no reason
S0423	then you'd have reason to scream what's make you so squeamish
S0421	i'm i've always be like that
S0423	why
S0421	i don't know i be bear like this
S0423	you weren't bear like this
S0421	of course i be
S0423	you've never have a problem with doctor and hospitals when you be a toddler
S0421	yeah i probably didn't know what be go on
S0423	no you wouldn't have do
S0421	now that i have a full understand of
S0423	so you weren't bear like that be you
S0421	what
S0423	you weren't bear like that
S0421	well because i be bear without knowledge
S0423	imagination probably
S0421	no but if you tell me if when i be younger you'd say right they're go to put you to sleep and cut you open i don't think i would've be very happy if i be go to get cut if you well i'd never get
S0423	well i don't think anyone would tell you that when you be young
S0421	yeah well they yeah but now because people tell me like oh right so you know this be what i i like it's because it's cos i've be educate
S0423	no it's a it's a it's a matter of ignorance and lack of education of be have an operation
S0421	no it's not
S0423	it be cos if it's the right thing and the good thing for you you shouldn't fear anything
S0421	no because it's like inside the body it's horrible i just want to rip everything out
S0423	that's well that's ignorance isn't it
S0421	why
S0423	it's stupidity
S0423	well your body be your body be what it need to be keep in work order
S0423	and if they need to go in there and sort it out sometimes then that's the right thing to do
S0421	er but it's awful
S0423	it's your body why be it awful
S0421	because ever since ever since i've learn ever since i've have biology lessons i've be like this ever since i be
S0423	yeah you haven't say what's cause that it's cos you've learn about
S0421	in what's inside the body yeah that's what's cause it but it's not like eh obviously if i never know what be i wouldn't be that bother would i
S0421	it's as soon as they teach you like oh inside you you have blood and it's like
S0423	so you'd rather be ignorant
S0421	yeah i would i would rather not know if i'd never know that i have like
S0423	i don't understand what's wrong with blood and muscle that's what keep it work doesn't it
S0421	i don't know it's an irrational fear isn't it it's irrational
S0423	well you need to start be more rational
S0421	have you not get any irrational fear
S0423	i'm sure i have yeah
S0421	oh yeah mm next time you're scar of something i'm go to be start be more rational
S0423	well yeah it's good advice
S0421	and you're go to be like yeah and i'm sure you'll be able to follow it won't you
S0423	this have change a bite use to be around about here
S0421	i think most people have irrational fear to be honest
S0423	mm
S0421	and to be honest it's not that irrational if you're go to have an if someone's cut you open it's not really an irrational fear be it
S0423	well it's alright to have a little bite of an inkling of
S0423	of apprehensiveness but it's busy in here look at this
S0421	why
S0423	cos it's the holiday isn't it
S0421	so many people they all need to go home
