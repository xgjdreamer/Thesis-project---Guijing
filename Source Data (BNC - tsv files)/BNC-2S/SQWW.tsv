S0281	so how be your day
S0355	yeah good
S0281	what do you do
S0355	i get up have a wash have my breakfast erm and i go into work
S0281	what be you do
S0355	erm we be put the finish touch to a to a erm
S0281	a thing
S0355	a thing a steel band that go around the handrail on a wooden balcony that so that if anyone fell against the wooden balcony
S0281	mm
S0355	and it break it would you know its steel band would keep it all together
S0281	oh
S0355	so we go and the steel band's get to be galvanise so
S0281	galvanise be
S0355	galvanise it's get to be galvanise
S0281	yeah galvanise be
S0355	that mean that it's dip in a melt bath of zinc
S0281	oh yeah
S0355	it's clean with acid and then dip in a melt bath of zinc
S0281	cos we often well sometimes use the word i be galvanise into action
S0355	yes
S0281	doesn't really well anyway i be dip in a bowl of zinc which
S0355	yeah absolutely
S0281	which make me move
S0355	make you run wouldn't it
S0355	well there's galvanic action galvanic action be not believe it or not the same as galvanise someone or something
S0281	it's get a specific specific erm mean in in metallurgy
S0355	mm
S0281	mm okay so you get that do yeah
S0355	mm get that do we dry fit it you anything you make in a er that's get galvanise have get to be assemble you've get to be able to manufacture so that it can screw together into transportable and handleable piece
S0281	mm
S0355	and then assemble with screw
S0281	mm
S0355	rather than something that can be fabricate by weld it all together and erm the reason for that be that if you weld something that's be galvanise you destroy the galvanise coat
S0281	well i expect you would
S0355	it burn off
S0281	mm
S0355	there you go
S0281	mm
S0355	so that's what we do we do a dry run we fit it we find out erm where there could be pitfalls we overcome any pitfalls and then we mark position in it to drill counter some clearance hole for screw which would have provide hole for the screw to fix it to the handrail
S0281	mm
S0355	so
S0281	we be you and yeah
S0355	yes and then we erm part of the balcony be rotten the wood and i go and buy some wood hardener which be like a mixture of resins in a in a solvent and you paint the wood with that the the resins sink deep into the wood er pardon me the solvent vaporise and then the wood harden the wood become waterproof and hard and when then you can we use just a plastic filler on top of that resin for the resin filler to fill in bits of
S0281	mm
S0355	wood to make it build it up
S0281	oh yeah you get your money off then do you get your money off
S0355	i do pay er for that he's put it in my bank four hundred quid he do that the other day
S0281	that's good
S0355	i be i think i'll text him because he want me to do more work down there
S0281	oh splendid
S0355	tile the bathroom which will be a day or two days' work down there fiddle around erm and so that's good and and er the opportunity for me to earn a thousand quid come in
S0281	oh wonderful
S0355	so that will pay my national insurance contributions that i owe four hundred and thirty one quid to hurrah and pay pay them er cos they be make noise the government have decide to change the ways in which er
S0281	we we'll be
S0355	which we be we pay our national insurance contributions so i now have to well i don't have to i think pay it with your tax you pay it with the tax at the end of the year
S0281	do you what if you're self employ
S0355	well that's what they're change it to yes
S0281	mm
S0355	which be fine by me it's great good idea
S0281	mm yes it be in a way erm good part about it be you you just have to muck about with it once
S0355	yes exactly
S0281	the the downside of course be that it's a large sum
S0355	well they never be that er they never pursue you very greatly when you didn't pay it
S0281	mm
S0355	it wasn't something that they care about much but erm what they do do erm er i know that i've get to pay one more year to qualify for my pension
S0281	oh yeah
S0355	for a full pension
S0281	oh good
S0355	i've pay for
S0281	how much be that a week
S0355	nineteen years sorry
S0281	hundred and thirty five be it a week
S0355	probably which be good to have you know
S0281	yeah
S0355	that's alright better than nothing and erm yeah it'll be brilliant to have that
S0281	well some people have to live on that don't they
S0355	sorry

S0281	and she say oh can you do my lesson on monday morning
S0355	oh great yeah
S0281	i say yeah okay so
S0355	do you need any book for that
S0281	well yes but they've get one she say er in the school there where i can get photocopy from so i say right i'll i'll be er she say come come round about four o'clock i say okay so i have time to er go over the road buy my wellies and the belt and come back here and change and er go off there and saw her i saw her boss first of all who's also an iofs examiner and he be tell me that he go up to london to examine
S0355	oh right
S0281	because there's not much in you know they don't you know
S0355	yeah
S0281	and i think well that's i don't really wanna go up to london and he say and he say well erm it's only er an hour on the train
S0355	right
S0281	and it's er right behind station
S0355	there you go
S0281	so i say oh okay but it's er the they run it differently from china cos er here
S0355	yeah
S0281	it's er you get pay i think eight pound fifty for one interview and eight pound for a write script
S0355	right
S0281	and what most of the examiners do they they do boo both speak and write but i never use to do write
S0355	right
S0281	because you in china you have to be on bc premise that mean you have to live in one of the four centre
S0355	right
S0281	like in shanghai you you have to go actually go there so that's why he work there so what examiners do be that you only get about a a dozen interview er and then they do mark er mark the write script
S0355	right
S0281	and that's how they they make their money in a day
S0355	yeah
S0281	erm but it it wouldn't be worth it for me cos i'd i'm only certify er for erm for the speak and it just wouldn't be worth it you know especially erm the after if you haven't test for three months er then you have to you do six and they check to see if you're
S0355	right
S0281	still
S0355	right
S0281	mark accurately and then you can go for the full but in like in china you go for the weekend you stay in a five star hotel
S0355	yeah
S0281	and er you do thirty interview for the weekend and er you know get about four hundred quid
S0355	fuck nora
S0281	for the erm for the weekend
S0355	that's amaze
S0281	but here it's it just doesn't seem like it's worth it you know if if it's in brighton it would be worth it but not not go up to london anyway he give me a phone number of a woman to contact so i be chat with the director of study about what she want me to do and it be only er an hour and a half class on monday morning and the way she describe it be er they don't seem to be all that good as a school really cos er she say the type of work i can offer you at the moment be er be on cover you know if if somebody er
S0355	if someone's sick
S0281	be call in sick
S0355	yeah
S0281	and they she'll call me up
S0355	yeah
S0281	like half an hour's notice and say oh can you
S0355	oh
S0281	come in straight away and do it of course you haven't get any time for preparation right
S0355	god
S0281	you've get to wing it er which of course i could do but you fix it
S0355	yeah
S0281	oh you're brilliant
S0281	what be wrong with it
S0355	well in there behind if you open it if you open it and withdraw the just open it click you little lever and open it
S0281	mm oh
S0355	no open it that's it now if you see the little round button here
S0281	here
S0355	well that be hollow and in the back of there's a magnet
S0281	yeah
S0355	and the magnet be not a fix it's loose in there it's er and when you click that up to it pull it off the magnet well
S0281	ah
S0355	what happen be the magnet get loose because it's loose it can jam up in there
S0281	oh and that's what happen
S0355	and the magnet jam up in there
S0281	oh you clever chap thank you very much
S0355	that's alright
S0281	put it on my bill
S0355	yeah okay
S0281	so erm anyway she at first first of all she start er say oh er can you do read exercise and er so i say yeah alright and but in the end we decide that i be gonna do write and er but the way
S0355	i think you didn't do write
S0281	yeah but i can teach it i can't
S0355	examine it
S0281	i can't be an examiner
S0355	oh i see
S0281	but anyway so we go through er what she want me to do and i i give her my ideas and say right i'll need some photocopy of this and this she say yeah okay we'll get all that do for monday morning er i say well could i come in on sunday and they're close at the weekend which for me be a very strange

S0355	well there you go
S0281	as well
S0355	both both fuck annoy people
S0281	well i'd prefer if nobody say it because i be from a a teach point of view if er somebody ask me well what do it mean and how i would explain it it it really doesn't serve much purpose it's actually call classify as what's call a discourse marker and i i be try to find another mean you could substitute for it erm i suppose you could say it's short for er do you know what i mean which be serve the same purpose er almost like a what we call a a tag question when tag question be
S0355	i think it's it's search for reassurance that the person who's be tell the information or the story be follow it and understand it and i think i believe they're they're they're ask for
S0281	mm
S0355	confirmation
S0281	confirmation
S0355	of that
S0281	mm
S0355	so it may be the that erm and there's also a certain sense of something you know share about it
S0281	mm
S0355	when they say you know you know it's rather like
S0281	mm yeah
S0355	have a fag together
S0281	yeah
S0355	or a beer it's you know you're you're join in a story and
S0281	mm
S0355	you're become you're you're sort of bond
S0281	it's to encourage
S0355	people's common experience
S0281	it's to encourage active listen isn't it rather than passive listen where somebody's
S0355	yeah
S0281	just sit there and
S0355	yes
S0281	active listen be when you're involve and you you do some utter some kind of
S0355	yeah
