S0353	and
S0262	oh right
S0353	he want
S0262	he be a neurosurgeon and
S0353	yeah he be
S0262	he go into a coma
S0353	a neurosurgeon himself he go into a coma he be in the hospital where he work he be on the on the machine and they be monitor his brain and any movement and they put him down they be tell us that he's brain dead you know erm and they say no leave it on we don't you know we don't wanna turn it off and all that crap and while he he be in this coma he actually go to heaven he he say
S0262	oh that
S0353	he be in heaven
S0262	okay i know who the guy be
S0353	okay
S0262	yeah
S0353	have you read it
S0262	yeah i no i haven't read it but i've read
S0353	yeah
S0262	some short summaries of it yeah
S0353	i think it be in the paper not long ago
S0262	yeah yeah
S0353	and i
S0262	yeah i've read some short summaries
S0353	and and er and in actual fact they know he he say that because he they be monitor his brain there be no activity so it wasn't
S0262	yeah
S0353	cos a lot of these er it's your imagination you know you go into one of these near death experience you imagine this and you see but
S0262	but don't you still have chemicals go round your body although you've die
S0353	eh
S0262	you know the reason for
S0353	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	you've get that chemical
S0353	yeah the drug where but all the all these things be the if you be if you be experience like a dream if you like
S0262	yeah they'd be able to monitor
S0353	there would be activity on the brain
S0262	yeah yeah
S0353	and he have none because they be they be sure he be dead
S0262	mm
S0353	brain dead
S0262	mm
S0353	and he wasn't and he come out of the coma
S0262	mm
S0353	and he say what he saw and you know be it still go
S0262	yeah
S0353	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0353	it that that that that interest me and i'd like to have read that book because i actually think and i and 's get a i i've get a big thing about the subconscious
S0262	have you
S0353	yeah i i
S0262	what
S0353	i believe well i believe that you know like be say we only use about five percent of our brain
S0262	yeah
S0353	ten percent
S0262	yeah
S0353	he say what's the rest of it for and i think they're right and i think the subconscious say the subconscious isn't in your body it's outside it's like an aura around you you know that's the spirit
S0262	be that his idea
S0353	it's subconscious
S0262	or be he read something into it
S0353	sorry
S0262	be that his idea
S0353	yeah it's his idea
S0262	oh it's his idea right okay
S0353	oh he's a new idea
S0262	it's not from yeah
S0353	and i'm think if it's if
S0262	right
S0353	i think it could be i think funnily enough when i be sit in this er church hall listen to and i be look and and my eye i wasn't glaze over but you know how you let your eye defocus a bite i could see round
S0262	auras
S0353	like a light round him
S0262	yeah
S0353	and there be a a light go off him and i er like a stick go up
S0262	yeah
S0353	up there and i think that's odd
S0262	yeah that's a bite odd
S0353	and then he do something else and i go and i
S0353	i refocus on something else
S0262	no but but
S0353	and i go back
S0262	but you know what
S0353	and it and it be it wasn't there anymore but you know as as erm
S0262	don't you find he's a very vibrational person
S0353	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	you see i go on vibrations of people
S0353	yes but he he he wasn't
S0262	i know
S0353	push this what what i like about
S0262	no i know
S0353	he wasn't push this
S0262	no he he he
S0353	he be just talk about
S0262	well
S0353	his experience and
S0262	erm
S0353	say say
S0262	vibrations
S0353	to
S0262	you know
S0353	be there and he be say about there be two guy who use to to get you know be sit there go oh yeah yeah yeah i know yeah and then all of a sudden er he say and when you look in the water you do this and they say well let's get some water shall we yeah okay yeah bring the so someone buy a five gallon thing of water and put it there and he walk up like that and like that you know i mean and the and one of these guy say give me and let me have a go and he go up and he do the same and he go oh and he sit up then and he say hang on a
S0262	mm

S0353	you know
S0262	yeah

S0353	mm
S0262	i believe in them
S0353	dance
S0353	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0353	yep yes
S0353	when you think about all the decisions in life
S0262	yeah
S0353	you come to a point and oh do i go that way a bite like the binary do i go that way or do i go that way or go that way or i go that way now if i go back to my first decision and i'd go that way where would i be i'm here now
S0262	mm yeah
S0353	or you know you can
S0262	yeah
S0353	go that way and and be up here
S0262	yeah
S0353	now if i'd go that way i could have be in the same place but go on a different route
S0262	yeah
S0353	and er and and that's the thing that amaze me you just have to make one wrong decision and you know that's a lot of what when i speak to the doctor that be deal with
S0262	why would you say wrong decision why wrong
S0353	well
S0262	why not a decision
S0353	the other decision
S0262	yeah
S0353	like the other decision
S0262	the alternative decision
S0353	not the wrong
S0262	yeah
S0353	the other one
S0262	yeah
S0353	but you know erm when i be talk to the doctor who be treat my wife in germany i say what cause her to get these attack why be it you know it seem to happen every year you know it's like and she say well when she's meet with a decision a difficult decision
S0262	yeah
S0353	that can be er the you know that can be one of the reason it can be something happen in life i remember when the first gulf war start this be
S0262	yeah
S0353	all around you know turkey and her area and she she go into one then
S0262	yeah yeah
S0353	you know
S0262	she be like highly string then
S0353	well yes highly string
S0262	yeah
S0353	but you could say highly string
S0262	maybe she be very sensitive
S0353	but you but you know when i do find out after after she die i mean she she when we go to england she'd always seem to have these attack around christmas time and i think okay she's not a christian i don't that wasn't a problem she wasn't a strong muslim either
S0262	no no
S0353	i but i wonder whether it be the pressure of christmas
S0262	yeah
S0353	do the food do the meal
S0262	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0353	but it wasn't
S0262	the food
S0353	when she die and i start go through all the paperwork i know she'd have a child before a year before
S0262	right
S0353	erm and i didn't i do actually know he be bear on christmas day and die on christmas day
S0262	oh god
S0353	but then it then it kind of hit me then
S0262	yeah
S0353	that that it's something quite cos i know that she tell me you know and i and then i find his birth certificate and his name be and he be bear at eight o'clock in the morning and die at two in the afternoon on christmas day and i i just think that that have to go that have to be the reason that she
S0262	one of the worst reason of all
S0353	freak it and it be always
S0262	and like yeah
S0353	start at middle of you know it's like the advent calendar
S0262	yeah yeah
S0353	you know
S0262	yeah
S0353	it have to be the reason
S0262	of course
S0353	and erm yeah
S0262	what happen to the little fella
S0353	eh
S0262	the baby what happen
S0353	i think just i dunno
S0262	be it cot death or something like or
S0353	no no it die in hospital
S0262	be it oh right
S0353	it die in she in a hospital in in germany and then er a year later she have mine she reckon she blame herself because she drink a bottle of apple and she didn't want the baby because she she and the argument you know didn't she didn't i don't think she like her 's father you know he be a he be a hells angel i think i never meet him
S0262	jesus
S0353	but i i saw picture
S0262	you'd think he be a hell's angel oh my god
S0353	he be leader and she work in a club and er meet him and er i dunno i and he be an alcoholic
S0262	oh dear
S0353	she i mean she'd come home she'd work all night at you know they make coffee machine and coffee
S0262	yeah
S0353	big german company in in she'd come home from the night shift and walk into the house and he
S0262	he'd
S0353	a lot of the time he be in a drunken stupor she save his life about three time you know kiss of life or whatever you know
S0262	yeah
S0353	yeah but other time she'd come home and something something would be miss and she'd go what's miss bloody freezer's go he'd have sell it to buy alcohol you know and that be enough that be enough to
S0262	yeah yeah
S0353	and he he she'd go to work and she'd hear from the neighbour he's send who be three in a t shirt and short or his pyjamas over the road to the garage to buy bottle of schnapps you know when she's at work it be awful so you know i mean when when i speak to the doctor after she die i say to her er what cause people to have cos they didn't call it manic depression then it be a condition you have a condition
S0262	oh right okay
S0353	they didn't label you you know
S0262	yeah
S0353	and he say well it could be a number of things he say it could be erm inherit when
S0262	yeah
S0353	her mother be a manic depressive
S0262	yeah
S0353	it could be erm i think the awful things that happen in her life or terrible things that happen
S0262	mm
S0353	to her we won't go into them all but there be she tell me some of them and they be awful
S0262	mm
S0353	and erm it could be change of er what do you call it culture
S0262	mm
S0353	and she be she be bear in the country in in er in you know her father be erm head engine chief electrical engineer of the dam the hydroelectric dam
S0262	oh right
S0353	at
S0262	where's that
S0353	near you know erm
S0262	oh right
S0353	in turkey
S0262	okay yeah yeah
S0353	erm so she be bear in the country but when her father die at forty two he be forty two she be forty two when she die
S0262	forty two be one of my best number
S0353	when when he die she be whisk up to by her aunt at thirteen and shove in a flat look after their younger brothers brother and sisters at thirteen have to give up school and look after these kid and be bung into a flat while the sister take her father's money and and educate her own children and buy herself a holiday out of it you know
S0262	yeah
S0353	that sort of thing
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0353	you know yeah
S0262	yeah yeah no it could be no it could be
S0353	so there's two change of culture
S0262	well yeah yeah
S0353	and then she go to germany
S0262	yeah
S0353	and marry a german and there's another culture
S0262	yeah
S0353	and then she come to wales
S0262	yeah
S0353	and there's another culture
S0262	yeah
S0353	so she have all the all the makeups to have that that illness
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0353	you know
S0262	yeah do you know what i find be really weird here be that i'm a bite i'm read this book at the moment call the presence process right and it
S0353	call the what
S0262	it's call the presence process it's a bite of a naff name but they've gotta call it something but essentially what it be be that you erm do breathe twice a day i know that sound weird because you breathe
S0353	breathe
S0262	anyway
S0353	yeah
S0262	but in the mornings i do fifteen minutes of of of breathe as in a particular type of breathe and at night i do the same
S0262	anyway i do it i start do it here while i be at the cottage
S0353	mm
S0262	and the first week and a half i be just bawl it all the time like if could go round to yours
S0353	mm
S0262	i would have like a massive like emotional release of stuff that i didn't know where it have come from
S0353	yeah
S0262	this be stuff from a couple of years ago
S0353	yeah
S0262	about like my mum die
S0353	mm
S0262	that's a small part of it but this be i be like i didn't even know they exist
S0353	mm
S0262	anyway i'm not cry quite as much now but i'm still do my breathe i've get erm to the end of february just to to go until i finish this thing
S0353	mm
S0262	and it's all i do be breathe it's not anything else
S0353	yeah
S0262	but i read the text and the text be basically say that there's three part to people there's the emotional which be what you be when you be in your mother's womb
S0353	mm
S0262	and then then you're bear it's all about self reflection there's no way of
S0353	mm
S0262	articulate anything cos you haven't get a language yet
S0353	yeah
S0262	so you're all about yourself feel once you start realise what things be and then define it
S0353	yeah
S0262	that's when your mental
S0353	right
S0262	like oh that's mum that's dad
S0353	mm
S0262	mum and dad
S0353	mm
S0262	and then you use your emotions for various and then once you actually can crawl about and you can walk towards things and then you start
S0353	yeah
S0262	that that's normal that make sense to me and then what this say be that when we make erm decisions in our life a lot of it be fuel by stuff from when we be like really
S0353	yeah
S0262	very young individuals like even
S0353	yeah
S0353	three to seven right
S0353	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	like apparent zero to seven a lot of stuff happen in your life
S0353	yeah
S0262	which you can't remember it
S0353	no right right oh yeah
S0262	but you be actually hold on
S0353	yeah
S0262	to some really interest
S0353	mm
S0262	stuff which it might not be actually all that good for you
S0353	mm
S0262	so this thing be all about let it all kind of come to the surface which it kind of do
S0353	yeah
S0262	then you've get to integrate it but the book's kind of like
S0353	yeah
S0262	and the idea be that you kind of let it go
S0353	mm
S0262	and that's what i be say as go through the door i be think about erm
S0353	yeah
S0262	you've gotta let stuff go
S0353	yeah yeah
S0262	if there's an earthquake yes that make sense
S0353	yeah yeah
S0262	some other stuff need to let go too
S0353	yeah yeah
S0262	cos you can let the earthquake go too
S0353	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	you know
S0353	yeah yeah
S0262	she's she's hang on
S0353	yeah yeah right
S0262	to something and we do hold on
S0353	yeah
S0262	to our little stories
S0353	mm
S0262	about life
S0353	yeah
S0262	you know and things that we can't work out and actually be here and be in the cottage and be in a a rural village i would say i mean what a better place
S0353	good
S0262	to be able to go through this process
S0353	yeah yeah
S0262	you couldn't start bawl it in tesco could you
S0353	no
S0262	i mean people would look at you
S0353	yeah
S0262	like oh dear
S0353	yeah
S0262	what's wrong with her
S0353	mm
S0262	and you couldn't be sit on a bus you know or a train and start go well they'd probably ignore me anyway cos they're all look at their bloody mobile phone but here i can just sit there and i'll just go oh and i'm like oh it doesn't even make sense but like i know what's happen be in a way be that be here i'm talk about destiny
S0353	yeah
S0262	be here be conditionally as in optimum condition be the right place to be
S0353	mm yeah
S0262	okay i could be in a mountain tree
S0353	yeah
S0262	in thailand
S0353	yeah
S0262	but i'm not i'm here
S0353	right
S0262	cos i've get
S0353	no exactly

S0353	mm
S0262	sort of look in his face and like so i say well what we'd do be that you know we'd go around and we have four section so we be gonna light one and walk round and light the second third and fourth so by the time i'd come round the fourth one the first one be you know
S0353	yeah
S0262	out so we realise it be too green and there be green bits you know that be
S0353	mm
S0262	wet and green so we have to think of another idea and i say well decide not to put any of his special fuel on the you know on the
S0353	mm
