S0202	yeah
S0208	how be they do
S0202	alright i think
S0208	yeah
S0202	which which be nice to see cos even though i mean we be both just as bad as each other in that relationship it weren't just one side it be me as well and i don't and that's not condone anything he do or anything i do but it weren't just him i provoke him and i do the same to him as he do to me
S0208	yeah
S0202	and i'm not gonna pass myself off as a victim because it weren't like that at all erm but erm yeah it's it i think he's do fine like it he look he he say that he be do alright and stuff so i just hope that he's sort sort himself out a bite
S0208	yeah
S0202	cos he weren't a bad guy you know we be both just as bad as each other and i think we be just destructive together
S0208	yeah
S0202	but
S0208	but it's nice that you can see each other on good term
S0202	yeah well i bump into him like if i ever go out round i bump into him and i'm just like er it's not all the time it's once in a blue moon that i bump into him or it be like hi how be you be you alright
S0208	mm
S0202	and we'll talk and have a chat and stuff but yeah so so have you see at all
S0208	erm no
S0202	no i ain't see or hear anything from her at all
S0208	no
S0202	i think i might invite her out on thursday
S0208	i be gonna say i think that things will be okay though
S0202	yeah
S0208	cos like
S0202	it'll be awkward for a few minutes but then it'll fine
S0208	cos i know this doesn't really mean anything but like she's like some of my post on facebooks and photos and stuff and like if you be angry at someone you wouldn't
S0202	no
S0208	genuinely do i know it have like no mean
S0202	no yeah
S0208	but it's true you wouldn't do that
S0202	yeah
S0208	i think things be
S0202	yeah i think
S0208	i think they're fine
S0202	i don't want to lose her as a friend but i'm we need to put our foot down we need to say look
S0208	yeah
S0202	we don't want to live with and if you want to live with then you do that but you should have tell us this months ago it's the fact that she let us down the day before we be go to
S0208	yeah
S0202	view that fantastic house
S0208	but to honest i think things will be okay because she must realise how awkward a situation it be and i think the reason that we haven't speak for a while be because we're angry but she must be just as ashamed
S0202	yeah
S0208	do you know what i mean
S0202	yeah
S0208	so i think if we make the first move to talk to her it will show her that we be okay and she doesn't
S0202	yeah
S0208	need to feel embarrass or
S0202	worry about yeah
S0208	yeah
S0202	no she should feel embarrass cos what she do be wrong but it shouldn't cost a friendship because
S0208	yeah
S0202	there's no need for it to cost a friendship we have an argument it's over that's it
S0208	but you have
S0202	we're still friends
S0208	you have arguments with friends
S0202	exactly you're always gonna have arguments
S0208	and sometimes if you're not happy with something that's happen you need to say it
S0202	yeah exactly
S0208	mm
S0202	because then you're just gonna build it up and then er all of a sudden you're gonna fall out and not talk to each other for months and months and months
S0208	yeah it could end the friendship
S0202	yeah
S0208	but no yeah we should invite her cos then at least she can turn it down if she want to or
S0202	yeah
S0208	just give her the option
S0202	yeah
S0208	it would be nice
S0202	definitely
S0208	but i be i be look forward to it cos if we can't get into we can just go anywhere on
S0202	yeah
S0208	we'll go to that erm cos literally be so fun
S0202	yeah
S0208	but it be later on in the night but i'm sure it will be fine
S0202	yeah
S0208	earlier as well
S0202	i mean we i'll i've get a student card now so
S0208	yeah
S0202	i if er as long as i make sure i take that out with me with my passport we should be fine get into place cos they be really funny that time weren't they when we didn't have our students card
S0208	yeah but then
S0202	like they would not let us in
S0208	but then again when i go with and stuff i go in without any id or my student id
S0202	it might be because you be with me because i look older and i be older cos like they look at my passport and then they ask for my student id
S0208	yeah
S0202	it might be because i'm older
S0208	but also it might be because and her friends have already go in and they come out to get me cos they think that i'd go home
S0202	right
S0208	cos they saw that i be with at the smokers and i be like i'll meet you guy in there
S0202	yeah
S0208	and then they obviously come back to smoke as i be go cos i go to look for them
S0202	yeah
S0208	so i think it be just like a misunderstand and they think that i'd leave
S0202	yeah
S0208	erm but then when i ring her and she come and get me so maybe because they'd already be in they let us back in
S0202	yeah cos they think yeah yeah do you have to pay to get in
S0208	no
S0202	no that's alright then cos this be what really annoy me about go out round you have to pay to get in everywhere like where i'm from you pay to get in one nightclub and that's only if you get there after midnight
S0208	yeah
S0202	and that's only to deter all the really drink people i think
S0208	isn't it
S0202	you know
S0208	that place
S0202	yeah yeah
S0208	i'm happy to pay like it's the same for like i'm really happy to pay to go in because i always have a good time
S0202	yeah i don't mind that but when you go somewhere new and you don't know what it's like and you've never be there before you don't know what sort of people be there you don't know what the drink be like you don't know all this or other stuff
S0208	yeah
S0202	i don't like it's like we pay seven pound each to go to and it's like i have a such a shit night
S0208	i do as well but i think that's a shame because erm all the stories that everyone's tell me that always like be my favourite place
S0202	yeah
S0208	i be really hype to go
S0202	yeah
S0208	i think it be just a bad night
S0202	yeah i think it be just cos it be so busy we wait for forty minutes the buzz that we have from pre drink have go
S0208	yeah
S0202	yeah
S0208	so i think it's just a shame cos our first experience be a bad one but i'm i'm happy to give it another try
S0202	yeah me too
S0208	but maybe a different time and a different night or
S0202	yeah
S0208	or like
S0202	i i will give it
S0208	just get there a bite earlier maybe
S0202	yeah or maybe just erm go a bite later on in term because if we go later on in term a lot people have work to do and it won't be oh yeah refreshers we're back at uni we're
S0208	yeah
S0202	away from our parent again sort of thing
S0208	cos all everyone have just finish their exams i think that's why it be such a big night
S0202	yeah
S0208	cos it be pack
S0202	yeah cos that's the reason i go out that thursday cos i'd just finish my exams
S0208	yeah
S0202	so
S0208	like erm i i spend sixteen pound on the ticket but i be so happy that i pay that much like i really feel like i get my money's worth
S0202	yeah
S0208	the best night i have have
S0202	really
S0208	in so like by a long by a long way
S0202	even better than the first week
S0208	yeah
S0202	really
S0208	it's it be i can't even explain how amaze it be it be really worth it i think that you'd like it
S0202	yeah we'd have to go we'll have to go
S0208	it be it be pack and obviously i be sober for about two hours where i didn't enjoy myself me and be just like i'm so bore this be a waste of money and then all of a sudden obviously and it be amaze
S0202	yeah
S0208	and all the people like at first the people annoy me because there be so many of them
S0202	yeah
S0208	but then i just everyone be like my best friend
S0202	yeah
S0208	it's amaze
S0202	yeah well we'll definitely have to do something like that cos i don't like if it's a special like night like an event like that i don't mind pay a bite extra
S0208	yeah
S0202	but when it's every single thursday you've gotta pay seven eight pound to get in it's like well hang on i'm i'm spend all our money in your bar and you're still charge me seven pound to get in
S0208	yeah
S0202	i don't think so
S0208	but again that's why i didn't mind because i spend sixteen pound to get in but i didn't buy drink all night
S0202	right okay
S0208	i i didn't buy anything i just get glass of water
S0202	right
S0208	it be totally worth it
S0202	yeah
S0208	spend less that night there on a big night expensive to get in and stuff than i do on a normal night when we
S0202	yeah
S0208	go to like or something and buy drink
S0202	yeah
S0208	actually turn out cheaper
S0202	be so so cheap though innit it's like you pay money to get in but then the drink be like two pound fifty
S0208	yeah
S0202	for a treble
S0208	and it's really nice the environment it's never pack the people be friendly everything's really like they don't let it go over capacity like they do in some
S0202	yeah
S0208	other place and that's why i don't mind spend money cos i know i'll have a good night
S0202	yeah cos there's always load of floor space as well ain't there there's like the bits in the middle that be like erm there's the bits in the middle like that be ram like closer to the dj box
S0208	yeah
S0202	and then there's place like but then there's place that you can stand away from it so like there's like i don't know if you've notice it but there's a seat area some near bar somewhere
S0208	yeah on the side bite
S0202	yeah and then there's like the bar which be never too ram either
S0208	but there's also a bar you know the stairs in the house music part
S0202	yeah
S0208	there be stairs that go upstairs and there's a whole seat booth area with erm another bar so you go there if you don't feel like dance and you just want a quiet place to sit
S0202	yeah
S0208	you still have the music but it's never pack because obviously everyone's dance
S0202	yeah yeah
S0208	like when i go with and we weren't drink yet it would be like let's just go upstairs and play some more drink game and stuff
S0202	yeah
S0208	manage to get a seat by the bar it be empty and it be good
S0202	that's really good that actually
S0208	i like that i actually like that cos there's a place for everything and there's a
S0202	yeah
S0208	quiet area there's that outside area where you can go if you just wanna be away from everything
S0202	yeah
S0208	two different room with two different type of music
S0202	yeah
S0208	it's get everything you need
S0202	it's good that innit
S0208	it's amaze
S0202	oh i'm dread this detox like i i actually feel better already because i don't feel stodge
S0208	yeah
S0202	do you know what i mean i don't feel like cos all i've eat today be salad that's all i've have and prawn and a bite of tuna erm and i have i've a sachet of ready brek this morning with some strawberries which be nice
S0208	ooh healthy
S0202	yeah but the i can't have porridge on its own without anything cos it's just so vile
S0208	it taste horrible
S0202	it's
S0208	i need sugar
S0202	oh yeah me too
S0208	i need a lot of sugar
S0202	that's why i buy the strawberries to go with it cos i think if i buy it cos they're only one fifty from asda they be like a little punnet
S0208	mm
S0202	erm l like i would put them in because then i can't taste the the the the porridge sorry
S0208	yeah
S0202	i can't taste the porridge so i'll be fine
S0208	i like it with bananas
S0202	mm yeah
S0208	cos bananas be so so naturally sweet
S0202	yeah
S0208	all through the year like
S0202	you don't need anything with the
S0208	cos strawberries sometimes when they're not in season
S0202	they're a bite sour
S0208	they can be a bite tasteless
S0202	yeah
S0208	but bananas be just always so nice
S0202	mm well i've get some more grapes but i've get freeze grapes as well so
S0208	okay
S0202	the freeze grapes i'll just keep for wine because i think they
S0208	yeah
S0202	if i take them out they're gonna go off straight away
S0208	they won't be very nice like
S0202	no
S0208	when when you freeze fruit and like defrost it it never taste
S0202	no
S0208	very nice
S0202	so we'll just keep them for erm the wine because while they it doesn't alter the flavour of the wine for a start but then when they've melt and you eat them they just taste like wine
S0208	yeah i've have a few grapes
S0202	so
S0208	from the punnet we have in the fridge
S0202	yeah
S0208	but i've only have a few because i don't think they're quite ripe yet like they
S0202	oh right
S0208	they be still a bite sour
S0202	yeah
S0208	and they're not start to go off or anything i think i'm just gonna leave them
S0202	yeah
S0208	for a few more days cos they be a bite sour
S0202	yeah that's what i like though about shop at there because you can buy stuff that be not quite ripe yet yeah fair enough you have to leave it a few days but at least you're not force to eat them straight away either
S0208	cos they're gonna go off
S0202	because they're gonna go off
S0208	like when we buy it up the meat market
S0202	yeah
S0208	i be quite disappoint in that actually
S0202	yeah i be disappoint in that
S0208	things didn't last very long
S0202	no
S0208	i think we'll just stick to buy meat there
S0202	yeah
S0208	erm
S0202	yeah definitely i mean if i'm gonna cook something that night and i want some fresh veg something that i wouldn't ordinarily buy like i don't know an aubergine be an aubergine veg
S0208	yeah
S0202	yeah so like an aubergine or like something like that that i'm gonna cook that night then i'd buy it because you can just buy them singular
S0208	yeah yeah
S0202	i'd probably buy something like that but for bulk for week i just i can't justify it cos you have it go out of date so quick
S0208	well so we have to throw away whole pepper
S0202	yeah
S0208	it's just such a waste of money
S0202	yeah so and the
S0208	and we be really excite about it as well like oh this be go like good money it's go straight to the producers it's all fresh and stuff but
S0202	yeah but then it just go out of date it's like well
S0208	yeah
S0202	that's money chuck down the brain basically
S0208	like it's like it's good out of principle but we can't really afford to do that right now
S0202	yeah yeah
S0208	as a lifestyle choice
S0202	it be so expensive to be healthy though ain't it
S0208	we're not quite there yet it be
S0202	it be so expensive like i mean we we're we're quite lucky because we're clever with our money so we go to place like aldi that most people look down their nose at
S0208	mm
S0202	i don't know why cos it's the same but like we're quite lucky that we've get because if we didn't have we'd have to get a bus there and then a bus back
S0208	we just wouldn't do it
S0202	and we wouldn't do it

S0208	i've see him
S0202	at the ball the last time i saw him
S0208	i've see him obviously the first day he get back but he be busy so i literally just say hello in pass like
S0202	yeah
S0208	happy christmas blah blah the second time i saw him be by the place again walk to from uni but it be pour rain so neither of us stop to talk
S0202	yeah
S0208	we be just like hi and then the last time be erm he be come out of his bedroom as me and be leave but we be run so late we be suppose to be at her friend 's at nine and it be half nine and we hadn't eat yet
S0202	right
S0208	cos i take her down to tgi's and we be gonna eat there
S0202	yeah
S0208	on saturday night erm but we get there and they be like one hour wait time and we be like fuck that
S0202	yeah
S0208	so just end up go to wagamama but obviously we have to walk home and change because we think if we go for dinner now we can go like not dress up
S0202	yeah
S0208	come home and get dress and get a taxi
S0202	yeah
S0208	but see as we be halfway into town to 's we have to go dress up and stuff which be fine i mean we be wear trainers and stuff like it didn't look too much
S0202	yeah
S0208	but just take so much time and
S0202	yeah i know what you mean
S0208	we end up be really late but it be cool cos we weren't pre drink that night obviously
S0202	yeah yeah
S0208	so we just get there have a bite of time to chill and then leave
S0202	yeah oh i'm so jealous you've be to wagamama
S0208	mm i realise erm i be tell her that it's i've i've probably spend hundreds and hundreds of pound there since i've move here five months ago
S0202	yeah
S0208	and she be like what how and i be like well go there quite a lot and i be like i haven't be a lot this term actually this be my third time she be like this be your third time
S0208	and i be like i've be here a month already she be like third time in a month
S0208	she be like you're a student and be like oh god yeah i be
S0202	we spend in one night at wagamama what we spend in two weeks on food
S0208	yeah well i don't any more cos obviously i don't eat as much as i do
S0202	yeah
S0208	and i've just i've stop like buy wine and stuff so i probably spend like ten to thirteen pound in total
S0202	yeah
S0208	which be better
S0202	yeah me and be talk about this earlier actually cos we be say that we want to go back to wagamama at some point erm but we don't want to spend as much money as we normally do so my answer to that well well we need to sneak our wine in somehow because literally we'll get a sixty pound bill and twenty pound of it'll be wine
S0208	yeah
S0202	cos it's so i don't know how they get away with charge that much money for a bottle of wine when er you can get a bottle of wine from the supermarket for three pound
S0208	yeah i think erm well the other night obviously cos we be on our way we'd buy just a bottle of cider like to share
S0202	yeah
S0208	cos obviously we couldn't drink much erm just to like get ourselves a bite
S0202	yeah
S0208	in the mood and stuff erm and i have it in the nisa bag and i just walk in with it
S0202	yeah
S0208	and put it under the table like they didn't notice so you could probably get wine that way in
S0202	yeah i don't think they'd be bother cos most of the people that work there be students anyway
S0208	i don't i don't think they'd care but i also don't think that they notice to be honest
S0202	yeah
S0208	they might see it on a table and realise it's not on the bill but i mean by then it'll be too late so
S0202	yeah
S0208	what be they gonna do
S0202	and that's only if they're like super super observant
S0208	yeah
S0202	and actually care if they're job worthies then they'll mention it and we'd probably get tell off and not to do it again but i doubt it
S0208	i don't think it'll matter
S0202	no
S0208	but i'm quite happy like if we're go out for a meal i'm quite happy to not get alcohol because i think the meal be my treat
S0202	yeah
S0208	and that's what i'm pay for so i think i'm happy to just to have dinner a bite earlier maybe go to wagamama and then on the way back get a bottle of wine and have it after
S0202	yeah
S0208	i think that would that would just be the better thing to do
S0202	yeah
S0208	oh i've just realise what a busy few weeks i've get ahead of me obviously on wednesday i'm go out to newcastle for the night to see my mum and my nan
S0202	oh yeah be that this week

S0202	no
S0208	prohibido
S0202	yeah
S0208	and erm yeah then like the master find out and stuff cos he like someone who he's a horrible person and someone trick him and say that this other guy be in love with him and he want to arrange a date so he have to go into his bedroom at this time like when everyone's go to sleep so obviously the gay guy go in get into bed with this guy

S0208	and he get fire it be so dramatic
S0202	really
S0208	yeah cos obviously you can imagine back then like everything be
S0202	well even so get into bed with some random guy or even random girl be bad
S0208	yeah but obviously
S0202	let alone be opposite sex
S0208	he he think he'd ask for it obviously he think that he'd arrange the meet so i felt i actually felt really bad for him i be like oh that's horrible
S0202	bless him
S0208	but he's a horrible character
S0202	be he
S0208	yeah
S0202	so be he in the show now then or not
S0208	mm i've only watch season one
S0202	and be that the end of season one
S0208	er it just sort of happen through the season
S0202	oh okay
S0208	i don't i haven't watch any more
S0202	and be er
S0208	i watch a bite here and there with cos her family watch it at christmas as well
S0202	yeah
S0208	so i just watch a few episodes but i'm not i don't follow it
S0202	mm
S0208	intensively
S0202	i couldn't believe it with that our one of our roof tile just fell off from the storm
S0208	mm
S0202	i didn't think it be that bad i mean er it's only a roof tile it's not like it's the whole roof don't get me wrong but still just even that it's like
S0208	yeah
S0202	that's never happen it's weird
S0208	well 's erm obviously he's a bite further down south and he's right on the coast in
S0202	mm
S0208	so obviously it's a bite worse but erm their whole fence in his house get blow over
S0202	really
S0208	like the whole fence be just uproot in the middle of the road and er his mum's house erm she also live in like a tree fell over erm into the garden but also onto next door neighbour's roof
S0202	really
S0208	yeah
S0202	oh god
S0208	so his mum be just like i'm just so glad it wasn't our house but i feel bad for the other people but i feel happy it's not my house
S0202	you'd be devastate though wouldn't you
S0208	mm
S0202	it's like it's like all them flood it's like what would you do like i saw this picture on facebook earlier basically someone's conservatory doors and the water be up there on the conservatory doors
S0208	mm
S0202	and it's just like i can't even imagine that like
S0208	yeah well do you remember when we have to do that news report in my french seminar the guy who be the foreign correspondent like down in london
S0202	yeah yeah
S0208	above the flood he show a picture of his friend's house and the water be like up to here
S0202	really
S0208	and there be just it be like a swim pool inside their house and that be in london just what what would what do you do like that take so much time and money to repair
S0202	well my uncle's house flood cos the ones who live er the gay one with his boyfriend
S0208	yeah
S0202	erm cos where they live they live just five minutes away from the town centre and basically they the to stop the town centre flood they flood where they live instead so they redirect the water
S0202	to where they live
S0208	lovely
S0202	and flood them instead so it take them two years
S0208	oh god
S0202	of live a caravan and hotels for the insurance company to fix everything replace everything
S0208	it's so horrible isn't it
S0202	cos the thing be with water you can't just like you've get to let it dry out you've get to let all the beam and all the support and all the foundations and everything else and the grind underneath to dry out
S0208	yeah
S0202	and then once that's do then you can start like repair stuff and fix stuff and it just take it two years two years it take
S0208	it's awful
S0202	and the whole place be just like it be like up to here in water
S0208	mm
S0202	it be so bad
S0208	i remember years and years ago when i still live in england i go up to my grandad's er in
S0202	yeah
S0208	and there be a really really bad flood that year i be about five four or five erm so obviously i be really really small
S0202	yeah
S0208	but i have to spend the day on my dad's shoulder because the water be up to his waist like
S0202	really
S0208	i would've i would've drown and i just i don't remember much of it obviously i be so young but i just remember a few bits like my cos he the whole area he live be like a residential area of bungalows
S0202	yeah
S0208	and all of those be evacuate
S0202	yeah
S0208	er
S0202	you can imagine though bungalows you've only get one floor
S0208	yeah plus they've all get air vent and stuff like
S0202	yeah
S0208	it be horrible like the whole place everything be evacuate
S0202	god
S0208	there be hundreds of house in that area
S0202	it's so bad innit cos it's like the i think the worse thing about it as well for the flood victims be the fact that all the politicians be go over there to like have photo opportunities and they're all safe in their nice little home away from it and
S0208	yeah
S0202	and they're just go in their wellies and like oh wow look at this this be bad innit and then go back to their nice safe home
S0208	yes like i'm a part of this
S0202	yeah
S0208	but they're not
S0202	mm they're all stick their nose in
S0208	yeah i'm happy we're not in that area though
S0202	yeah me too it would be like
S0208	would've be such a hassle
S0202	well be on the top of a hill so it's very very it would be very rare that i mean we would never flood er i think it's
S0208	yeah
S0202	pretty much impossible because because unless you're at the bottom of the hill obviously but because where our university be and where our halls be we're at the top of it
S0208	it's not gonna flood
S0202	sort of thing it's not gonna flood
S0208	unlikely
S0202	and even if we do flood we're not gonna flood on fourth floor be we come on let's face it
S0208	yeah we're fine
S0202	the only yeah
S0208	we've fine
S0202	the only way that we're gonna flood be if someone above us like leave a tap on like that guy do in 's apartment
S0208	which have actually happen so
S0202	yeah yeah let's not erm laugh too much about that
S0202	oh
S0208	don't tempt fate
S0202	no let's not touch wood quick touch wood
S0208	yeah
S0202	we do not flood but year erm my er lecture today be so bore honestly
S0208	be it
S0202	cos like i get the reason why we have to do read and we do like self study and all this sort of stuff but what i don't understand be them then repeat it in the lecture
S0208	mm
S0202	i suppose it's to reiterate and to help us understand more what's be say in the book but i don't i don't know it just
S0208	well do you remember when i have my first lecture this term for my new module
S0202	yeah
S0208	and erm i do the read before the lecture cos
S0202	yeah
S0208	usually i do it before the seminar
S0202	yeah
S0208	but i do it before the lecture cos i just have free time and erm it turn out that the lecture like our lecturer have basically just do her lecture base on that chapter of read
S0202	right
S0208	but it be in the same order the same bullet point the same title like it be literally
S0202	the same
S0208	the whole of that chapter in lecture form and i be just like i'm not take any new information from that like do that read didn't help me because the lecture then become pointless
S0202	yeah
S0208	and it's actually be the same each time they've base it on the chapter they've give us to read
S0202	right
S0208	so i mean i'm still do the read cos obviously i do get a bite more information
S0202	yeah more detail
S0208	and learn personally
S0202	yeah
S0208	yeah like more examples and stuff
S0202	yeah
S0208	erm but i find it more helpful to do what our seminar tutor's ask us to do be to like look up media article
S0202	yeah
S0208	erm to sort of put our topics into perspective like internationally
S0202	yeah oh right okay yeah so
S0208	if you know what i mean
S0202	like in practice sort of thing
S0208	yeah
S0202	yeah
S0208	so it's like my topic er for our project be education
S0202	yeah
S0208	and erm she ask us to find a media article to do with our topic but also the topic of the week
S0202	right
S0208	so our topic when i do it last week be gender so i have to find an article that be to do with development and gender and education
S0202	so you have to find all the all the different examples for the different things
S0208	yeah and i think that's really good cos it's a lot more challenge because it's really hard to find an article that cover all of it
S0202	yeah
S0208	erm i find that really helpful though cos it help us to get a lot more examples in for our poster
S0202	yeah
S0208	but i'm gonna i'm meet up with people tomorrow erm i think so far there's three of us that have come back to me
S0202	right okay
S0208	out of the five but one of them we've never meet so
S0202	oh yeah it's that guy who get the email innit
S0208	basically just the four of be
S0202	oh
S0208	and i
S0202	have he not be in touch with any of you as yet
S0208	no the our tutor give all of our email but i don't know like maybe he's drop out or something cos i haven't see him it's actually someone i didn't realise but i've meet him before he be in one of my modules the last term
S0202	yeah
S0208	for the seminar group erm and it's a guy
S0202	yeah
S0208	so that mystery have be solve
S0202	right
S0208	but erm he come into one of the seminars last term and that's it
S0202	yeah but if he drop out then it it would have to have a a a exit interview
S0208	well we would have be notify as well
S0202	yeah
S0208	so i think that he's just not do anything
S0202	yeah
S0208	but that's fine cos i mean it's annoy because he's gonna get the same mark as we do and he's gonna have do none of the work
S0202	yeah
S0208	but then i just sort of think well there's four of us
S0202	it's one less person to organise innit
S0208	yeah
S0202	and if he's really that if he's if he's really that erm oh what be i gonna say he's obviously not that bother cos otherwise he would like turn up to the seminars and stuff like that do you really want someone on your in your group who turn who doesn't turn up and you arrange to meet him and he's like yeah i'll be there but then doesn't turn up and
S0208	exactly so i kind of think like the fact that he hasn't get in touch and hasn't come like it doesn't bother me that much cos i'm in a group of people who be quite motivate be quite interest and stuff
S0202	yeah
S0208	so i think it's okay but obviously you know i miss that seminar erm last week
S0202	yeah
S0208	well it turn out everyone else do as well like for
S0202	really
S0208	for different reason and erm one guy go there
S0202	oh yeah you say cos it be torture like you have to
S0208	yeah
S0202	outline what you'd do
S0208	we have to outline what we'd do so far and obviously we meet up once and we've get some information but we haven't get a proper structure yet
S0202	right
S0208	cos we think we have until the twenty fourth of march
S0202	right
S0208	erm so the guy he text me and he be like oh i can't believe you guy do this to me it be torture i be completely by myself i have no one to back me up and i be just like i'm so sorry i'll make it up to you and he text me today and he be like so do you wanna meet tomorrow and he be like how be you gonna make it up to me and i be like
S0208	erm well if we meet at the old bar i'll buy you a drink
S0208	and then he be like yeah okay kiddo that might work i be like
S0202	kiddo
S0208	yeah
S0202	how old be he
S0208	erm i think he's quite old
S0202	oh okay right
S0208	yeah he's a mature student
S0202	ah okay
S0208	like dunno maybe nineteen or twenty
S0202	and you class that as a mature student
S0208	well
S0202	and he's say kiddo
S0208	well you know what i mean it's just a term of endearment
S0208	cos the first time he text me erm i didn't know who it be cos i hadn't save any of the number like
S0202	yeah
S0208	i'd give people my number er
S0202	but then they'd not text you like say hi this be or this be yeah
S0208	exactly so i just get a number off some random person and it get to that point where it be so awkward cos i hadn't ask who it be yet and he be just talk to me and he be like okay pal yeah we'll meet here blah blah blah it's fine don't worry about it and i be like do he know who i be because i don't know who he be so i be like i'm really sorry but erm who do i have the pleasure of speak to
S0208	and he be like it's
S0208	and i be like ah hi and
S0202	hi
S0208	i felt so awkward
S0202	oh dear
S0208	erm but i like this group i don't really like my group for the other one though
S0202	really
S0208	yeah well there's that guy that i meet that one time he be nice
S0202	yeah
S0208	but i haven't be since so
S0202	that's gonna be awkward for you
S0208	but i mean i'm do all the read and i'm do all the lecture and stuff so like i have information to contribute i'll just work really hard
S0202	yeah
S0208	with them in the group
S0202	well i've gotta catch up four weeks of lecture for my politics erm because obviously i i cos i've not be transfer over onto it yet and then obviously other things happen so i've only really miss three weeks of lecture
S0208	mm
S0202	er or two be we week four
S0208	erm
S0202	yeah we're week four so i've miss three weeks of lecture
S0208	yeah
S0202	erm and then i'm go to tomorrow's lecture so i should be fine erm but i'm not gonna be able to go to this seminar group yet cos i've not assign it so when i
S0208	yeah
S0202	drop it in tomorrow the form i'm hop that i get assign a seminar group before i miss it
S0208	well at least there's no group project for that module
S0202	yeah no it's just as an exam
S0208	so at least you're not gonna be drop in like that
S0202	yeah the only thing that i've get to do be erm a fifteen hundred word essay in week eight but it's unassessed
S0208	okay
S0202	so i think that's just
S0208	like a practice
S0202	yeah for the exam
S0208	that's good though
S0202	yeah
S0208	it's like have a lot of those like erm over christmas she have one exam obviously she's do law so it's it's like medicine like they don't have like we do like half term essay and stuff like that but erm all of the ones that she do so far have just be practice like you'll get a mark but it's not official
S0202	yeah
S0208	they'll be like if this be assess you'd get this grade sort of thing
S0202	yeah if it be in the exam sort of thing
S0208	yeah
S0202	yeah
S0208	and i think that's actually much better cos obviously law's quite hard
S0202	yeah
S0208	and it would be really unfair to mark them like from the start
S0202	yeah
S0208	do you know what i mean cos she's on a four year course
S0202	yeah
S0208	erm but she's do quite well like she get a first in one of them
S0202	really wow
S0208	yeah and then she be like damn it why isn't it mark
S0208	and then she get like other like a vary mark and she be like i'm actually quite glad none of these be mark now
S0202	yeah
S0208	but i think she's do well
S0202	yeah that's good
S0208	which be good and i be really happy to hear about as well cos she's be do really well
S0202	yeah she sound like it yeah
S0208	get two ones and firsts and stuff and i'm really find like really happy for her cos in a non rude way she's never be academic
S0202	yeah
S0208	but it's because like in france and stuff erm obviously you have to do every subject there's no choice like for gcses and stuff usually you can pick a few subject that you want to do
S0202	yeah
S0208	in france it be all of them just like the bac
S0202	yeah you have to do it yeah
S0208	and erm that mean like all the ones that she wasn't good at and not interest in she still have to do and be like mark in
S0202	yeah
S0208	and i just felt really sorry for her cos she struggle especially with maths and stuff
S0202	it's just it's one of them things as well it's a vicious circle because if you're not if you don't enjoy something and you don't like something then you're not gonna put a lot of effort in but then you get a bad mark in it and you think well why should i do anything else because i'm obviously not very good at it so i'm not gonna try
S0208	yeah
S0202	it's like a vicious circle innit like
S0208	exactly and erm before she leave france cos she didn't so the bac she wasn't a college in france she leave just after the like the equivalent of gcses and erm she get a tutor for history geography and maths
S0202	really
S0208	yeah and she do really well i mean she be full on for about two months before our exams
S0202	yeah
S0208	and she do well but erm i think the reason why she's succeed now be because she's choose the subject
S0202	yeah
S0208	she love the subject she's good at it it's like psychology and stuff it's what she's good at
S0202	yeah
S0208	so i think that's why she's finally happy with her learn environment cos she's finally do stuff that she's a good at and b enjoy
S0202	yeah yeah well my friend do that at erm my friend the disable one who i tell you about all the time
S0208	yeah
S0202	who you've not actually meet yet even though she live in
S0208	well i still know everything about her
S0202	yeah i know
S0202	soon as you meet her it'll be oh so you're nice to meet you
S0208	it'll be like i know your life story here's mine
S0202	no she's really nice she's a bite weird but i mean there be this one time
S0208	so be we though
S0202	yeah but she's like weird in a different way so this one time erm her friend die and it be really horrific how he die his brother be drink and drive like
S0208	oh no
S0202	and he be drink and they have an argument as they be come off the hard er come off the erm the motorway onto the hard shoulder onto a junction and he basically lose control of the car and go straight into a tree
S0208	oh no
S0202	the driver didn't die but his brother do and his brother have just have a baby and
S0208	oh god
S0202	and like it be awful and erm be like really like mess up over it erm
S0208	i can imagine
S0202	and cos it be one of her close friends erm and that like a few nights after it happen we go out drink like summer barbecue then go out around town and stuff erm and she be really drink and she start talk to people that weren't there like we be wait for the taxi and she be stand talk to this guy call
S0208	oh my god
S0202	and it be really freaky it be just like it it be just weird like really weird
S0208	yeah
S0202	like you know
S0208	that be strange
S0202	and like she be really upset about it all night and i be and i be just like i didn't know whether he be a really close friend or she just consider him a close friend or what because she's tell me she'd not see him for a year like a year or two years and like well how close can he be if you've not see him for that long but i don't know whether it be like her way of deal with it or what but it be just really weird like i i can't even like explain it
S0208	yeah it's always
S0202	but
S0208	horrible when you're in control like you're sober or you're okay and someone else be completely off their face because you sort of see things differently
S0202	yeah
S0208	like if there be two of you and you're both really really drink you're in the same boat
S0202	yeah
S0208	but if one of them's really drink and do weird things
S0202	yeah
S0208	you notice it
S0202	yeah
S0208	it's like sometimes when erm i'm with and he's smoke or whatever but i haven't
S0202	yeah
S0208	ah i get really i'm i like fear for him cos i know that he's fine but because i'm see him high
S0202	from a sober point of view
S0208	and i'm completely sober i'm just like what the fuck
S0202	yeah
S0208	like when we be at 's erm i hadn't have any of the joint they be both high be fine but obviously isn't use to that like cos he get oh dear erm
S0202	it doesn't matter
S0208	he get like solid stuff which be
S0202	yeah
S0208	not as strong as like actual
S0202	yeah it's different yeah
S0208	green weed
S0202	yeah
S0208	and erm it be the first time he'd actually have it this summer
S0202	yeah
S0208	like the first time ever and he just go really weird on it like he have a cough fit and i think that he be like die i be really worry and
S0202	yeah
S0208	then he start laugh by himself and he be just lean on a post and like laugh like talk to himself and i be like he's obviously have a nice time
S0208	but i be really really scar right now
S0208	i be just like be you okay be you okay yeah shall i take you home yeah let let let's let's go home
S0202	let's go home
S0208	you need to sleep this off really bad
S0202	oh shit this bracelet honestly it ruin so many of my clothe
S0208	but it's so pretty
S0202	it be so pretty they're ten pound each them
S0208	i love them
S0202	from erm debenhams john rocher i be like ten pound
S0208	i like it
S0202	like pay for them but i be just like ten pound really
S0208	i can get two
S0202	ten pound well i get three
S0202	he make me buy three and he be like buy three and like they be ten pound each i could get these from primark for one pound
S0208	yeah but they wouldn't last as long
S0202	well no but
S0208	and the gems would fall out after a day
S0202	well i'm only wear them once
S0208	yeah
S0202	i'm i've not really wear them again properly cos they ruin everything that i own
S0202	but
S0208	yeah
S0202	i'm really good actually cos erm 's mum do a lot of my wash from time to time and i have this really nice dress and i can't find it anywhere now
S0208	be it that that topshop one you be tell me about
S0202	yeah it's that topshop one and it be it weren't expensive but i can't find it anywhere
S0208	have you lend it to someone
S0202	and no i haven't because
S0208	have you like maybe accidentally leave it somewhere
S0202	no and i think what have happen be because it's a smaller dress than what i would usually buy i think that 's mum would have think it be 's his brother's girlfriend
S0208	oh
S0202	and have send it to her by accident
S0208	yeah
S0202	and she's just think it be something she forget she have or someone else's
S0208	yeah that's possible
S0202	and i'm like i tell to text last night and get to look for it but i don't know whether he's actually like do that but like whether
S0208	just just
S0202	's tell her to look for it or not
S0208	yeah just chase up on it a little bite
S0202	but i'm gutted though cos it be such a nice dress like it i love that dress it like i'd wear it on a day to day basis like i just meet my mate for a drink i'd just put that on
S0208	yeah
S0202	and it be summer so i didn't wear tights but like i'd wear tights with my converse with it or my uggs and it just
S0208	yeah
S0202	look really nice it be just one of them casual things you could er wear it on a night out or you could wear it through the day and i just love it
S0208	yeah i
S0202	and now i'm gutted
S0208	fell in love i've fall in love with a type of it's a smock dress
S0202	yeah
S0208	so it's like straight up straight down
S0202	yeah
S0208	and it's completely plain but i find one in topshop that i fell in love with but i couldn't justify pay thirty pound for it just cos it come from topshop
S0202	yeah
S0208	but then the ones in new look and primark and everywhere else that i look they just weren't nice
S0202	yeah
S0208	like obviously topshop they'd put the effort in to make the size right to make it nice
S0202	yeah
S0208	that's why it's expensive
S0202	yeah
S0208	but i i really couldn't justify it like pay all that
S0202	how much do the other dress cost though twenty seven
S0208	twenty seven
S0202	so it be only three pound more
S0208	yeah but you've see the dress like it's not plain
S0202	no
S0208	do you know what i mean
S0202	yeah
S0208	it's get a pattern it's nice it's something i could wear casual and something i can dress up
S0202	yeah
S0208	and obviously primark's one erm the topshop i know it will last long
S0202	yeah
S0208	but i know that i get my money's worth when i go there
S0202	yeah
S0208	that's why i don't go very often
S0208	it's the first time i've be since i've move here
S0202	yeah it's really expensive
S0208	i'm very proud of myself
S0202	i don't i don't like the
S0208	cos i have an addiction to topshop so
S0202	i i don't like the topshop in i i think it's like it's so confuse cos the topshop it where i'm from it's like you walk in and there're just section
S0208	yeah
S0202	like it's not all glittery and fancy like it be in there like the one in be so glittery and fancy you can't find anything
S0208	have you be to the one in the cos there's
S0202	i don't know
S0208	i think there's three i know there's one in town somewhere that's massive like giant i go there with my dad
S0202	yeah
S0208	when i come for the open day
S0202	oh yeah it's the erm it's the one in the er new centre the new shop centre innit
S0208	the
S0202	be that what the new centre's call
S0208	yeah
S0202	i think it's the one that i go into
S0208	oh cos that's the first time i'd be there and i like that one
S0202	yeah
S0208	but it's on three floor but it's all relatively well organise
S0202	yeah well i go with 's mum so i might have just think oh well this be a bite too much like for 's mum
S0208	yeah
S0202	sort of thing
S0208	but there's also
S0202	so
S0208	a small one erm i can't remember what centre it's call but it's the one
S0202	the
S0208	i don't i honestly don't know it's really small
S0202	yeah
S0208	erm it's where do you remember we go into dorothy perkins and you get that top
S0202	oh yeah it's on that road
S0208	yeah
S0202	yeah
S0208	there's there's a small topshop in that centre and then a massive massive one further in town and then a new one in the
S0202	right yeah i've be to i think cos the one in start on a on a normal road don't it and you get in and then when you come out at the other side it's in the
S0208	yeah
S0202	and there's like three floor
S0208	it it start on the high street yeah
S0202	yeah yeah
S0208	but i like it there
S0202	yeah i know which one
S0208	i find so much stuff that i like cos erm topshop like it's really hit and miss cos it's style a lot i use to love it
S0202	yeah
S0208	but now it's all like really weird stuff
S0202	it's hipster innit
S0208	yeah
S0202	it's like really like like extreme hipster like
S0208	yeah
S0202	really fashionable
S0208	like vibrant colour and
S0202	yeah
S0208	just stuff that i don't particularly like so find it really hit and miss when i go in there but
S0202	yeah i do
S0208	generally i do find stuff that i fall in love with
S0202	yeah i generally like i only go to topshop for my jeans i don't like buy dress and stuff from there because
S0208	mm
S0202	the size for me be wrong
S0208	oh yeah
S0202	because my boob and my bum it just take into consideration if you're small and skinny
S0208	yeah
S0202	you know it like if i buy a size ten in there which i be a size ten like because of the size of my boob it just do not look right or do not fit right
S0208	yeah
S0202	so i have to get the next size up but then it fit over my boob but then everywhere else be baggy and it's just like well i'm not pay this much money for something that doesn't fit me how i want it to fit me even
S0208	yeah
S0202	you know
S0208	but i think that's why i like topshop be they have a petite range
S0202	yeah
S0208	so like i can get a size eight and it will be a size eight for small people
S0202	yeah
S0208	because they have a tall section as well but the normal if i buy a size eight like skirt or something it will just be a bite too long like look a bite wrong
S0202	yeah
S0208	and then i go into the petite section and it's the same size that fit like the same but it's just make shorter
S0202	yeah
S0208	obviously for small people
S0202	yeah
S0208	that's where i get my dress when i get it from the petite section
S0202	do you
S0208	because i originally pick one up from normal
S0202	yeah
S0208	and it be just too long like it go over my knees and it be a
S0202	yeah a bite too conservative
S0208	it's a body con one so it's suppose to like be tight around the legs
S0202	yeah
S0208	and it just wasn't
S0202	yeah
S0208	and then go and get me the right size
S0202	ah
S0208	it be nice but i like that that they have the petite range
S0202	yeah it's they have a tall range don't they as well
S0208	yeah
S0202	which i think be good like for me personally cos my jeans when i go to the normal i can't get jeans in there that fit me so i have to go to the tall bite and get jeans from there
S0208	yeah
S0202	because i like wear my jeans quite high waisted as well
S0208	yeah
S0202	so because i'm tall i don't they just don't look right
S0208	yeah
S0202	and they end up be like ankle grazers and i don't want ankle grazers i want them to go over my ankle
S0208	yeah
S0202	so
S0208	but that's why i love topshop because you can get a different size waist plus different size leg
S0202	yeah i love that
S0208	whereas normal jeans it's like a size eight be this long and i have to fold up all of my jeans
S0202	yeah
S0208	because i'm like i'm small but i'm a size eight so please
S0202	yeah
S0208	fix that
S0208	well now i'm a size ten which be even longer
S0202	yeah they be long yeah
S0208	but at least now i can get like waist whatever like
S0202	yeah waists whatever leg whatever
S0208	and the leg like for it's
S0202	yeah
S0208	a twenty six like a size four
S0202	be that it
S0208	because i'm short
S0202	oh my god
S0208	yeah literally
S0202	i'm a size thirty three in leg
S0208	i think i'm like a twenty eight
S0202	like long leg
S0202	or whatever
S0202	hi
S0208	hello
S0202	yeah be you
S0202	oh baguettes
S0208	mm bread
S0202	that i i when someone walk in my bedroom now like hello who be that and i forget that you've get key oh carbs i want carbs so much

S0208	but i don't i didn't recognise the voice it be really weird be like who be that and i be like i don't know i know for a fact it wasn't or
S0202	yeah cos then you know their voice don't you
S0208	yeah and it i don't think it be either cos i know his voice
S0202	yeah
S0208	it's quite distinctive i be just like who be this person it's really weird

S0208	mm
S0202	like it only happen three or four time but 's keep come into my room and shout
S0208	yeah
S0202	or like they'd like push my door open and run away or whatever and that's why now every time i go to bed i lock the door
S0208	yeah
S0202	like
S0208	well one night a few weeks ago everyone be pre drink in our flat and i be just on skype to like my door wasn't lock cos you know i just think people be like respectful and stuff
S0202	yeah
S0208	and then i just hear a girl like run down the corridor like backwards and forward and she be scream and she be like let's check whose doors be open and i be like what what like why would you do that that's so inconsiderate like seriously you're a grow up now act like one so i go and lock my door straight away i be like there's no way i'm have some blonde probably bimbo in my bedroom
S0202	yeah
S0208	piss me off and it be like midnight or something and i be like they've get to be leave soon so i just lock the door get on with it keep up with and then i hear bang on 's door and it open and then be shout like what be you do what be you do and like could hear it be him

S0202	yeah
S0208	it's like why do people do that and why do they think that's okay
S0202	it's cos it's all their friends like this be
S0208	so immature
S0202	the all of them be just so rude and immature it's none of them have be away from home they you know they're all so immature that they don't know how to act around people
S0208	mm
S0202	and they think it's okay that you can just go and do that well actually no it's not and that's why i lock my door and i have a go at for it because i be like look that be out of order i'm not be funny or anything but this be my room this be my personal space if i invite you in here then you're lucky to be here because you know this be my space it's not a share space and i don't appreciate people run in my room at half one in the morning who i don't know who i've never meet before shout oi because they think it's funny it's like no have some
S0208	it's not funny
S0202	respect and nuance about you and you know
S0208	i just don't understand how people can do that like if you're drink fair enough sometimes you don't realise what you're do but even when i'm drink i still what's right and what's wrong
S0202	i will never go and like do that unless it like your door and i know you'd be out with someone else and then i'd be like and i'd probably come and knock on your door but
S0208	but you'd still knock
S0202	i'd still knock i wouldn't just walk in
S0208	no
S0202	it's just so rude like i don't understand why all them be so rude like i've never know anything like it it's like even time before we put boundaries down he be rude like that
S0208	he be like he use to
S0202	like
S0208	walk into my bedroom in the middle of the night and i'm like
S0202	and get in bed with you as well like that time he get in bed with me and you when we it's like well what be you do no one's
S0208	mm
S0202	invite you in why be you here
S0208	but i do start lock my doors after that but then i stop because i be just like i'll lock my door when i want privacy and stuff but i'm like this be my flat too i shouldn't have to lock myself in my bedroom like
S0202	mm
S0208	just to feel like i can have some private space
S0202	yeah
S0208	and like ever since we have put boundaries down with them lot and we've stop hang out with them like it doesn't generally happen
S0202	yeah
S0208	so i leave it unlock cos i just think in case of a fire or something
S0202	yeah
S0208	it's just a bite safer
S0202	yeah no it's just so inconsiderate innit it's just like what be you do really come on
S0208	yeah
