S0511	or be that just really crap like it's i mean but anyway luvvy even if we have be plan to go to and 's thing you can always say that you want to do something different and we can say yes or no
S0513	yeah
S0511	obviously but that be why be only bring because 's go to a party and and apparently it be this really important party and if she miss this party then you know the world would just about end or whatever so i mean clearly if there be other people also go in it would make sense for some lift share to happen
S0513	i don't know any all 's friends
S0511	oh cos you don't know her friends right
S0513	well i do but well
S0511	yeah but not yeah not not it's not like and whatnot fine fine you get the detail and we'll do it
S0513	mm
S0511	hell worst case scenario i can always just give you the money for a taxi you know
S0513	that will cost you like a lot
S0511	taxis in don't cost a lot
S0513	i could walk from and get the bus
S0511	sorry
S0513	and the bus probably doesn't run at night
S0511	mm you can't walk home from at midnight
S0513	it's it's not
S0511	yeah but that's like eight miles away or something no don't be ridiculous i'll i'll pick you up this be my job but you must find out the score on with what you're suppose to take et cetera
S0513	what would i be suppose to take
S0511	when i go to party which obviously be a regular occurrence i take a bottle of wine
S0513	er mm i doubt that would go down very well with her parent
S0511	yeah so you might take i dunno i've get a few pumpkins
S0511	well i dunno crisp you well you could take like you know a coke or whatever
S0513	i suppose
S0511	anyway you speak to her about it well i tell you what actually if you're gonna be out on saturday and i'm here then maybe erm and and i will go to erm the jam bond film
S0513	it's not very good
S0511	i know you say it wasn't very good and be just say it wasn't very good i think that you must have adopt your it's not very good from him or vice versa the review
S0513	no
S0511	be say it's the best one in years
S0513	i didn't really understand what be go on
S0511	mm
S0513	well you have to have you have to watch the last three like recently to understand
S0511	what the storyline isn't self contain
S0513	no which i think be a bite shitty but you know
S0511	oh that's surprise yeah well i never understand what's go on though so it would you know make no difference to me at all
S0513	you don't even understand what's go on in jam bond
S0511	no they're just jump from roof to roof and there's a baddy normally
S0513	say the stunt weren't very impressive which i think
S0511	i mean
S0513	be odd
S0511	when i saw the other that's er he say that it be just a bite subdue
S0511	a bite try to be sophisticate not not over the top enough
S0513	yeah it be exactly roger moore an aeroplane fly through a build but then it it didn't like keep on fly and i think that be shite
S0511	but it fly through the build what and then what
S0513	and and then it crash rather than continue fly which be
S0511	i read erm something in the paper about erm there's a scene where they're go up the river in london in the night
S0513	uhu
S0511	yeah and just how to film that scene be quite difficult cos they really it's not all cgi'd or whatever they actually film that scene
S0513	what
S0511	at night
S0513	go up a river
S0511	in london
S0513	in a boat
S0511	in the dark and there be helicopters over it or something
S0513	no i don't think a helicopter over london isn't that difficult
S0511	well how do you know because you can't you're not allow to fly things over london you have to get like special dispensation obviously
S0513	they have to close a bridge and then
S0511	yeah and you have to get all the residents to agree well i don't suppose you have to get them all to agree
S0513	yeah i doubt they
S0511	but there be the some of the er
S0513	they be just drive a boat
S0511	well well it be in the paper
S0513	er
S0511	all about it and i read a thing the other day about
S0513	what do they actually crash a helicopter into london bridge i doubt it
S0511	that seem unlikely erm i read the other day about one of these posh square in london that's often use for erm like period dramas and stuff
S0513	mm
S0511	and how er
S0511	how they're like the the residents there be just completely feed up with it and the erm cos the council charge the film company or whatever so they're happy for it to happen again and again and again but the people who live there be obviously get irritate
S0513	i'm not sure why you'd be that irritate it's not like there be many like explosions or pyrotechnics with period dramas
S0511	no but those square they're such a the the parky bite in middle in those posh ones be sort of private so you couldn't go there because there be well the they the one they object to be like a fashion show part of london fashion week there's gonna be a big tent in their garden
S0513	oh no
S0511	for two weeks well if somebody say i'm put that up in my garden for two weeks i'd be piss off
S0513	yeah but you wouldn't like stop them they're just posh
S0511	yeah i'm i'm i'm not defend rich people darling don't get the wrong end of the stick right so this week er since i last saw you er my administrator who i've only have for three months and who's become ill and she be go she's go in for an operation to the hospital she's quite badly ill actually er then announce on the day her last day before go in for the hospital that she be resign and not come back
S0513	yeah so
S0511	so well that's quite inconvenient
S0513	if she's an administrator you should do it yourself
S0511	well i haven't get the time but you've get to find erm it's a question of how quick you can get somebody in because er people in other job have get to give four weeks' notice and you have to advertise and then interview them so that take two weeks and then they've get to give their notice or whatever whatever whatever
S0513	there be quite a lot of unemployed people in britain
S0511	there be quite a lot of unemployed people in britain you're right and they have just be do some advertise for some receptionist at my in the build i work in so i look at these cvs cos it's just an administrative post like you say and luckily i didn't lead to look at most of the cvs cos in the cover email i could tell that they be illiterate and like the the my administrator send you know email to like proper people the she need to use a capital i when she say i you know
S0511	er mm but so what happen be about i've be quite patient with this administrator and it's not her fault she get ill but i have go out of my way to be supportive and i do struggle when she cos she could have tell me she be go to leave like two weeks ago to actually not tell me till the last day be just unprofessional
S0513	oh oh no
S0511	well it won't help when she want a reference er cos i'll try to be nice but it's it really be pretty unprofessional i mean there's no need for it cos she could have just be honest with me anyway so then i be stand in the kitchen about twenty minutes later and i saw one of the guy who work for one of our managers and i say oh hi how be you do and she say oh fine i've get to start think about job hunt and i say oh cos hers she's on a temporary contract with these people and i quite like this woman and i do you wanna come and work for me
S0513	mm
S0511	and she say yeah sure so that be that sort
S0513	so that be lucky
S0511	mm it be very lucky mm mm
S0513	be she literate
S0511	yeah yeah yeah she's er like she's a grow up erm like a proper grow up professional with degrees and stuff and the reason that she's happy to be my administrator be
S0511	yeah exactly so she have erm her she's get her degrees be in market and journalism and that sort of thing and she's be a journalist in australia she's an australian and then she's be work in a laboratory in africa for a year to do something or other and then she's come to england erm and so she doesn't have a particular kind of career path and she's be work with these erm one of my genetics ones on a market thing which be always go to be time limit and she be due to finish at christmas but she's work full time but she move to work for them part time now and then work for me part time and then the two'll go along side by side and then in that time she can also think about get herself a proper proper job she's get a radio station actually in australia
S0513	run one
S0511	yeah
S0513	mm
S0511	twenty four twenty four hours a day so yeah and it be like staff by young people and it be like a community thing i think she's also
S0513	maybe like radio
S0511	yeah it's er well it's er mm radio be reasonably professional cos that's that's bbc radio the erm crazy local ones be like the call or radio
S0513	call what radio
S0511	and it's like kind of and and there's hospital radio in
S0513	be there
S0511	mm
S0513	a hospital have a radio frequency
S0511	uhu hospitals always have have radio frequencies
S0513	what so you can
S0511	play
S0513	see who's
S0511	stuff on the
S0513	die
S0511	no it's so that people who be hospital can listen to the radio
S0513	oh right yeah
S0511	and like every song be dedicate to somebody in the hospital it's quite a big you know it's kind of a significant thing hospital radio it's just a thing that's always be
S0513	mm bite like tap into their walkie talkie radio cos to see if the relative be in a crash
S0511	no it's not for check out who's who's in a and e this week you would have have you hear in the news that a boy be kill at a school in yesterday
S0513	mm i think i saw it headline somewhere
S0511	do that make you erm sort of scar
S0513	i don't know what be the detail
S0511	well apparently it's a very good school highly regard so like a school like yours not some kind of inner city dangerous place that you'd think that it's
S0513	yeah but what happen
S0511	i dunno some other kid stab him
S0511	well this sound like the kind of school where no one have knives
S0513	actually probably have a knife
S0511	who
S0513	erm something like that
S0511	be he the one in 's year
S0513	no
S0511	no be he
S0513	he's in mine he's alright he's bright but he just doesn't make very good decisions
S0511	yeah mm yeah that's a really sensible way of look at it and carry a knife be a really bad decision well yeah so i don't know the ins and out but i hear a thing on the radio when i be this morning and they be talk about i think at that point they be say they be go to close the school for a week for everyone to i dunno whatever and this psychologist be say that's probably a bad idea it's much important that the young people there can be together rather than at home potentially alone cos of course mums and dads be at work terrible yeah i mean not er obviously it's terrible when it happen in inner city school as well it's crazy cos in american school they have metal detectors don't they as you go in
S0513	yeah well they do now
S0511	well it doesn't stop anything do it mm
S0513	i doubt that there be exactly like eagle eye watch them with the metal detectors
S0511	they're not like what
S0513	they don't eagle eye always alert with the metal detectors at school and
S0511	well i imagine they're like those ones at the airport though they can't be cos then
S0513	yeah er
S0511	then they be set
S0513	i mean the staff would not give a shit who's gonna man metal detectors
S0511	well there must be one
S0511	well there erm in american school they have police officer onsite as well mm
S0513	there be in london sometimes i think
S0511	oh there be a i saw on the news yesterday a police officer who just assault a student be sack
S0513	why
S0511	well cos he assault the student
S0513	yeah but why do he assault the student
S0511	i don't know i think she be be misbehave in the classroom so he be call in whereupon he just assault her so that's how it end so of course be this have these days someone there be er someone videoed it
S0513	i think some school in london have policemen
S0511	do you
S0513	some school in london
S0511	you think have police officer
S0513	yeah i'm pretty sure someone in camp say that so mm
S0511	sorry
S0513	pretty sure someone on camp say their school have one
S0511	well they i be think they might have one allocate like erm like when you be at primary school there be a like your your kind of priest bloke who wasn't
S0511	you know he so he's kind of come in regularly but he's not you know doesn't live there or whatever
S0513	of course he doesn't live there but er
S0511	you say that when be at nursery in london he think that his key worker er live at the nursery
S0513	yeah think
S0511	he think some of the erm some of the other kid fly in from africa every day it's funny isn't it when funny what little kid think even though we'd always try to be really multicultural and all the rest of it er
S0513	's just a complete twat
S0511	be not a complete twat be an extraordinarily individual
S0513	erm whatever you say
S0511	yes he be so be you go to come with me to pick them tomorrow
S0513	i don't see any reason at all to
S0511	do you go with daddy to drop them
S0513	no i be out with
S0511	mm you seem to have spend a lot of the time on your own then this last few days have you no i suppose you be in the shop and then you be with and you've do some homework i be say to the other morning
S0513	just
S0511	sleep a lot i be say to the other day how well i don't be it not very long ago that you start sleep late in the mornings so it's like within the last few months
S0513	yeah i'm a lot tireder
S0511	yeah but it seem to be like sometimes you still get up at seven and other time you don't get up till eleven it's not like you start get up at eight and then nine and then ten
S0513	yeah sometimes sometimes my alarm wake me and sometimes i sleep through
S0511	oh i see
S0513	i think it depend cos i put it here it depend if i stick it on my bedside table or by the charger
S0511	your phone

S0513	er not usually well er saturday i've get tennis and
S0511	yeah
S0513	i i think it be off for some
S0511	yeah i do think of email your tennis coach to recommend that he change the lessons round
S0511	to the other order you know you you know you laugh but probably no one's ever suggest it to him it make much more sense to have young kid earlier cos they're all up at the crack of dawn
S0513	yeah be i up at half five like when i be twelve
S0511	he doesn't get up at half five
S0513	i mean he get up at like half past six

S0513	but i remember one time when i be about that age right just like until about nine
S0511	well i don't know 's be consistently get up at the same time you i think you be probably a bite more kind of irregular really whereas he's really quite consistently yeah you be all or you've never be quite as early as him

S0511	oh i've hear of those
S0513	er five percent a few months like a month ago
S0511	okay what's it about
S0513	erm the impact of liberalisation on society from nineteen fifty nine to seventy nine
S0511	uhu what's the key issue
S0513	abortion
S0511	wrong
S0513	what
S0511	wrong
S0513	legalisation
S0511	that's not the first one
S0513	of abortion
S0511	sorry
S0513	legalisation of abortion what be you say abortion's wrong
S0511	no i'm not say abortion's wrong say like the first thing you should say where like where be not abortion
S0513	well
S0511	well so what be the other things you're go to list
S0513	erm the four things that i know you're gonna say it should be women's right but the four things we've be give
S0511	yes
S0513	be law change
S0511	yes
S0513	which be the legalisation of abortion er the erm divorce reform act the legalisation of homosexuality and erm the abolition of the death penalty
S0511	oh so so you're only do stuff to do with the law be you
S0513	yeah we're only do actual change
S0511	change in the law there be other actual change such as the availability of contraception
S0513	yeah that's under
S0511	under
S0513	divorce and abortion and stuff
S0511	it's not really anything to do with divorce er well i suppose it's something to do with abortion
S0513	yeah it's something to do with abortion
S0511	yeah but there be no i i guess there wasn't a law need they just invent contraception
S0513	mm
S0511	yeah okay and unfortunately the legalisation of homosexuality at that time
S0513	yeah
S0511	no well i suppose that be step forward
S0513	you have to be you have to be twenty one
S0511	yeah
S0513	and in private
S0511	yeah and yeah i mean there be still a lot of erm even when i be young there be still lot and lot of dreadful discrimination against gay people so whereas kind of women by kind of the the differences that abortion and divorce and contraception bring on kind of have a er i guess it feel to me like a really quick impact whereas yeah homosexual right seem to take a lot of seem to have take
S0513	and the
S0511	a lot longer to come in
S0513	age of consent be only equal in like two thousand and one
S0511	it be be that actually properly equal now
S0513	i think so yeah but only
S0511	ah but
S0513	yeah two thousand and one
S0511	yeah they
S0513	and er you weren't allow to be gay in the army until two thousand and two
S0511	and yes
S0513	america be two thousand and eleven
S0511	i think you still weren't allow to be gay in the army
