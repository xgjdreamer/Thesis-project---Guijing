S0115	it must be really really good out there like
S0037	it's probably cold it's probably cold though
S0115	kind of feel like i'd like to go there but
S0037	unless they've get them like burners on
S0115	yeah
S0037	um but uh
S0115	stock be up
S0037	ay
S0115	market
S0037	oh that's good
S0115	uh everything's up
S0037	oh my god so so you know at work you know when i go to brno
S0115	yeah
S0037	so you know i have to fill in expense
S0115	yeah
S0037	so i pay for things on me work barclaycard and then i have to so you have like oh it say oh me barclaycard statement like any bank statement it say on this day you pay this person this amount so it's like ah your train fare this amount ah you buy a sandwich at the train station this amount ah you go to tescos this amount like all your things be there so you have to account for all of those um
S0115	yeah
S0037	but when i go to brno like um it's like you buy you know like tram ticket
S0115	yeah
S0037	and um they're just pennies aren't they like just you know like odd copper and um so obviously you can't be like pay with your barclaycard you can't be like oh seven pence here's my barclaycard like
S0115	uh i don't know yeah i mean you could try that
S0037	but you there's just well you know what it's like like in paris or in in like in lodz or in like um berlin can't like exactly buy or in fact here on the bus you couldn't get on the bus and just like whack out your barclaycard if you get the number a from there you couldn't like crack the barclaycard out like
S0115	ah not but um be that the thing like we we be tell about japan you know the thing i be tell you about japan that you could if you could do a whole journey across japan like just with a like a an electronic type thing
S0115	ah swipe thing yeah yeah yeah well they're bring that in here aren't they that's the that's the barclaycard advert where he's down like a water chute in new york
S0115	yeah
S0037	anyway so what happen be so i pay for things out of my own cash cos i have some of my own money um and that be in czech crown so i pay for stuff like just like small things like tram ticket and like really like little like bits of change things but then um i be like oh i should claim those back really i mean it's not very much but like they add up you know like to a couple of pound or about ten quid or something and i wasn't really that bother but i think no no no it's i be there on a work trip i should i should claim them
S0115	yeah
S0037	what you have to do be you have to um account for the days that you be there then you have to go on financial time dot com you have to put in those date you have to find the average currency conversion rate over those date you have to find out how much you pay in total so like mine be like like ten crown or something
S0115	should've should uh put it into an excel spreadsheet
S0037	yeah but it change that's the point like you've gotta it'll it'll never be the same you've gotta then print off the thing from the financial time circle the calculation that you've use i e one pound equal
S0115	maybe there's maybe there's an app for that
S0037	oh god it be so long wind like
S0115	well how many days be you there all then
S0037	well just a few days so it wasn't
S0115	so you only have like well like five four or five um
S0037	it be just a like a few days
S0115	but you have to find it so so then d'you store that in in in ft be it easy to uh to go back
S0037	well you go to europe and then like um the good thing about europe be so you put the days in and it show you like the main graph it's like the euro against what you know the pound or whatever
S0115	the czech koruna
S0037	but then underneath they have all of the like cos you select like your main currency so you select pound then underneath they have all of the currencies of europe which in fact aren't very many obviously cos like the euro
S0115	no it's you know there's a few
S0037	there's the swiss franc there's the czech koruna there's um i think croatia have a different one
S0115	oh yeah i'm sure that all of those uh all uh all the yugoslavian ones
S0037	no not all of them like
S0115	yeah no no yugoslavia's not part of the eurozone
S0037	estonia have a different one so there's like a few
S0115	yeah yugoslavia's get the kroni or whatever uh
S0037	kroni
S0115	kroni
S0037	so all of those be list so then you have to like find them all and then you have to do all the stupid calculations like it's such a long wind process i think god for ten quid but i don't know i suppose it's worth do
S0115	well um
S0037	no but ten quid's ten quid isn't it
S0115	yeah it's a good story the on the one one it's uh you know round easter it's always good to have uh an uh miracle at easter
S0037	well i don't know if it be a miracle lot of people have problems and recover like
S0115	yeah but if it happen at easter then it's uh more miraculous
S0037	well like our plant i mean that's that's more
S0115	yeah oh you mean jesus
S0037	jesus the aloe plant

S0037	yeah
S0115	start up a bonfire

S0115	uh and then you know in in a like a cover of some kind you know like a foil
S0037	yeah
S0115	put it in there
S0037	some interest ideas
S0115	and uh it'll it'll have a really smoky flavour
S0037	yeah
S0115	um so yeah and
S0037	or
S0115	but yeah we could also you know um
S0037	could just slow cook it and it'll be
S0115	go on a go on a somewhere you know like
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh
S0037	not sure where
S0115	and and we're suppose to get a tent what we could do be get a tent and then uh
S0037	temporary tent
S0115	and set set it up like next to next to the ham hock like in the park
S0037	okay plan's come together
S0115	you know if you've get a tent that's good but if you've get a tent and ham then that's even better
S0037	ah we should do that i look at so many i look at so many different ones like we really should decide on one
S0115	what
S0037	we really should decide we really should decide on one like i look at so many tent it's one of those things like like me dad when me dad when me dad be look for a me dad be look for a new phone what be they do
S0115	um drug
S0037	drink
S0115	uh they're just hang out just uh play around
S0037	ah it's annoy isn't it
S0115	some wrestle
S0037	it's not what you want
S0115	uh blokey stuff
S0037	i hate blokey stuff
S0115	sorry what be you say
S0037	really get on my nerve
S0115	what blokes
S0037	blokes yeah like this sort of bloke have he get a burberry hat on
S0115	uh they'll they'll they'll have they'll die out eventually yeah
S0037	have he get a burberry cap on
S0115	no it's it's just it's just green
S0037	i hate cap
S0115	you mean baseball cap
S0037	yeah
S0115	not not like flat ones d'you like flat cap
S0037	i like a flat cap on a on an old gent not not yeah
S0115	unless it's unless it's a burberry flat cap do they have burberry flat cap
S0037	ah he's pretend to do something very rude to that man over there it's not necessary
S0115	he's just in a happy mood uh
S0037	well
S0115	uh
S0037	he's come into like the pub with all of his tool on his tool belt as if that's some like masculinity display
S0115	either that or uh like a porn film
S0115	whoa he's just
S0037	you've obviously i wouldn't know so
S0115	yeah well no but no uh uh
S0037	a stereotype
S0115	yeah the cable you know just come to fix the cable
S0037	ah it's bad no what i be say about me dad be like the problem with like try to choose anything like me dad be look for a phone you know like a like i suppose like a smartphone or something
S0115	be that that's the first line i'm look for phone
S0037	no that's not the first line
S0115	no phone in here just just me the shower
S0037	alright this be take an unusual turn
S0115	sorry about that
S0037	um but he spend so long look that and his research be so extensive that actually by the time he'd get anywhere new things be on the market you know his research be so he take so long compare all of the various possibilities that actually it be like one of those never end cycle like
S0115	yeah
S0037	if you compare everything in that much detail like you would never get to the end cos there would always be something new
S0115	yeah so
S0037	in the end he do he he do buy one yeah yeah yeah
S0115	but he do he do get one in the end didn't he
S0037	but i don't think he be very happy with it and i think he'd get something that be more like businessy i think he be persuade by things like battery life like old man old folk considerations he be horrify when i tell him that i i charge my smartphone like every day or something horrify
S0115	oh be that one of his that be one of his factor
S0037	yeah but like that's the stupid thing though he's an he's an electrician he know he know the power you know he know the wattage of a phone he know the price per watt kilowatt hour even he know he could easily work out how much it would cost to charge a phone for thirty minutes every day i'm sure it's not very much i'm positive
S0115	well the problem like
S0037	just like
S0115	i think i mean i i don't think it's that bad to to to charge yours every day because um because well
S0037	like you don't charge it for like ten hours do you
S0115	just sort of like because you have to charge yourself once a day you can simply charge it when you're charge yourself
S0037	you do have to charge yourself
S0115	yeah so when you go to bed i mean simply plug it in um
S0037	yeah
S0115	and um leave it on overnight and so that's not a problem that uh i mean obviously it would be better if it if it last for two or three days but but i would it it
S0037	well that's one thing actually the blackberry that i take to brno it do last a really long time
S0115	yeah the i mean the problem be that be you don't wanna have to use your thumb all the time do you
S0037	no i don't like the
S0115	that that thing on the smartphone's really good you know the the swype thing which be uh
S0037	swype yeah
S0115	really it allow you to to use a very little amount of energy for uh to to get through
S0037	yeah it's a good invention
S0115	so i think it would allow like potentially really fast type uh that's what i be say before
S0037	i think there's load of stuff i don't even know like you know there's like a little tutorial when you first use it and um there's load of stuff that i don't even
S0115	well some of the things that be a bite annoy be be like apostrophes and stuff like if you're say it's a good day today or something
S0037	i think it do that though and and i think it do it do learn like it do um
S0115	oh yeah well it certainly learn vocabulary yeah
S0037	cos like some of the stupid things that i say like owt and nowt and like how man and like little like you know it do learn them
S0115	yeah
S0037	yeah it do do it's look
S0115	yeah yeah i i um yeah i think it's it it like you could type almost as fast as uh as you know as uh as a manual typer
S0037	yeah i sometimes get paranoid like in the office because like i'm quite a heavy typer like i'm quite a loud sort of typer
S0115	yeah
S0037	and sometimes if i've like get an email in me mind that i want to send like i don't really i don't need to look at the key i've do that much type me thesis and everything and um i feel like sometimes i'm just like go shh like cos i bash the keyboard so hard
S0115	yeah
S0037	i'm sure it can't be very good
S0037	i should get a better technique
S0115	well i guess you've learn that technique you know somehow so
S0037	but i feel like our office be so quiet sometimes i feel like i'm be really loud like like on the keyboard
S0115	but i know that the way you type like you you don't put your finger in the right in the right place so uh
S0037	yeah but i think it's one of those things that once you've learn once you've learn it like
S0115	but uh yeah well it that's what i be say before but
S0037	actually i it's because i've get like um
S0115	uh
S0037	i type with actually with more of one hand than the other i'll type more like that d'you know what i mean like my leave hand do like a some small ones but my right hand be more rangy and i think that's because
S0115	yeah i actually have i do too much with my leave hand and
S0037	so you do a lot of like control and stuff like
S0115	control in with the leave
S0037	yeah
S0115	whereas i should share uh share the control like
S0037	well i didn't even know for age that there be like even like control and shift on the other side like i didn't even
S0115	sorry
S0037	i didn't even know for a very long
S0115	you didn't know where well i didn't even know there be a control on the on the right side so
S0037	ah well
S0115	i only use the leave one
S0037	well that's what i'm say i know that one i don't know that i didn't know there be one there
S0115	no no i think you i think you use uh oh right
S0037	no
S0115	when i do shift i always use the right one i think like
S0037	do you
S0115	often always use that
S0037	oh i don't
S0115	whereas when i use control i always use the leave
S0037	i try and use more keyboard stroke like there's some i really like some of the alt ones i really remember like ones that i use a lot like in certain bookmarks and create you know like when you're hyperlinking another document like alt i i k and alt i i i
S0115	oh yeah yeah
S0037	they're like create create bookmark and insert bookmark
S0115	oh those be really useful yeah well i think you know with um uh it you know there there's so many useful things you could do with uh with macros to to automate
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh but but like it's not i think i need to know a lot more macros
S0037	yeah
S0115	but uh you know to do a lot more stuff but i mean i recently work out how to do like to do a macro that go through like a a whole folder of file um in you know through word i i could do that with with python
S0037	you do what
S0115	could do that with python before like if you wanna find and replace in document uh
S0037	oh in a folder that's useful
S0115	i mean i could do them with python but uh i didn't know how to do it in in visual uh in visual basic in word but but you can do load of uh like if you're use um word or excel or access you can do load of like um
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh useful macros in uh visual basic which um just like if you've get annoy task generally speak there should be a way to to make that task less annoy
S0037	well that's what i i be say that at work like i think like if there's something you think that you wanna do there's definitely definitely an easier way than do it manually like
S0115	yeah i mean i think there's always an easier way to be honest like and until unless you're at the very vanguard of technology
S0037	always
S0115	like um
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	like like you know like
S0037	like i like i be say before you're you're never gonna be the first person who's think ah i wish it would do x like it's very very rarely
S0115	well unlikely there's there's some some things you might
S0037	no but very rarely isn't it
S0115	it it you may there may not be a free uh available one or whatever
S0037	yeah
S0115	but uh no i mean uh but yeah say i mean even for for for transcription i mean if i be to train um uh you know something to recognize my voice like you know you could speak into that like uh obviously
S0037	yeah would you like some of this
S0115	uh yeah um but yeah i think there's there be always a way to be uh more efficient about things and and there's not always time but uh
S0037	ah his perfume be so strong do you get that
S0115	no not not
S0037	ah really strong really put me off you know sorry sorry i do like a bite of uh aftershave or perfume and that but when it's like when it's like you can like taste it i feel that's a bite much
S0115	what
S0037	when you can like taste someone's perfume after they've leave
S0115	ah right no i didn't get that but uh
S0037	do you not
S0115	yeah in well in your mouth's pretty bad isn't it
S0037	you're like
S0115	it it just feel weird doesn't it
S0037	sorry i didn't mean to cut you off

S0037	yeah
S0115	that's i guess he people be side with him i suppose against uh against iran or against uh uh soviet union um and uh at one time but uh the cat thing i guess be difficult to
S0037	oh he's awful
S0115	explain like
S0037	oh he's horrible
S0115	why what make him do that but uh that be his own choice so
S0037	ah it's so cringey it's so hard to watch you know people talk about like borat and like all those ones but that's awful to watch
S0115	cos he he choose to go on um um to go on big brother
S0037	big brother and why would you even do that like it's desperation it you ask me
S0115	but he but he choose to no it's that he he he think he could do any like you know he think he could he could do anything anyone say and like somehow come across well yeah out of it but um

S0037	so that be like a bite out of place and then it start to be like i get soul but i'm not a soldier so
S0115	right so they be mainly um
S0037	it get progressively weirder
S0115	then rock actually yeah that type

S0037	uh every wednesday apparently i be talk to the barmaid
S0115	i mean i know they have them in the portland over there but uh i didn't know about um
S0037	quite a different calibre of band i feel
S0115	yeah they be always sort of loud metal band and more sort of rock um
S0037	i don't think you would get like a cover a cheesy keane cover band in here uh sorry in the portland
S0115	no i guess not um
S0037	it would be like the virgin mary's like suspenders or something in there like some stupid like pseudo death
S0037	industrial
S0115	like one one of the name be uh bleed from within
S0037	bleed from within yeah yeah yeah that's better than my one
S0115	well what be it suspenders and what
S0037	i dunno i be make stuff up i i'm
S0115	but there's a pub just down there there there's a lot of pubs in this in this little area but uh that one just down there it's just always it's ridiculous ridiculously quiet
S0037	you know but the
S0115	it's like there's like a fish tank which be strange cos not pubs don't normally have fish tank in them
S0037	like no i've get nothing against a pub with a fish tank though but do you not wonder if it's the time that we've be in like
S0115	you go in there right and it's like you can hear the fish you know
S0037	like we've never be in i know i know i've be there but what i'm say be like we've never be in on a friday
S0115	the fish be bore they're try to get out
S0037	we've never be on a friday night though it might be like jump that might be the place to be
S0115	uh i dunno
S0037	no but we've only in we go in once when we wander in we go in once with your parent like on like a sunday afternoon i mean
S0115	get ones with no no i go in before uh it be kinda like be in a wait room of like like a restaurant except like that actually that be the main bite and like the restaurant be just like the restaurant of a wait room or something
S0037	yeah yeah it be bad like sometimes you know if you go in a pub and then like there's only one other person there and they're just listen to you and you're a bite like you can't say what you wanna say it's yeah it's not nice but maybe we just haven't give it a a chance maybe we should go like and see what the crack be and
S0115	uh yeah well we can go along there right now and i i think the crack will be like pretty much the same as as what the crack normally be but still
S0037	i don't mean now um yeah maybe
S0115	yeah we can see so
S0037	so do you think we should go next door now or d'you think we should go like or stay here or
S0115	um
S0037	it's always kinda cold next door which sort of get on my nerve
S0115	what time be it uh i've it's twenty three eighteen um yeah we could go there and
S0037	it's always a bite
S0115	they they close at the same time don't they cos they're oblige to
S0037	it's always a bite it's always a bite cold though that's one thing like
S0115	yeah
S0037	yeah it be cheaper but it be they don't have music on and it's it's a bite like
S0115	not much atmosphere
S0037	not much atmosphere
S0115	yeah cos you know it's like wetherspoons um base on george orwell's idea of what a good pub would be
S0037	yeah
S0115	and he didn't like music in pubs which i don't really agree with that so like
S0037	no i think it's good to have something background y i don't know if i want like
S0115	like but but but like all wetherspoons well apart from the lloyds bar wetherspoons wetherspoons have no music in them bite of uh
S0037	god
S0115	entertainment uh
S0037	so annoy
S0115	so yeah be it uh be it the barman no it's someone no it's someone
S0037	yeah it's like some lads pull hilarious lads' prank
S0115	i be uh cos i think they know the barman i think something like that
S0037	well
S0115	anyway um yeah so uh pubs should have music that have that have final uh but wetherspoons don't apart from those bar that be my final thing that i would say
