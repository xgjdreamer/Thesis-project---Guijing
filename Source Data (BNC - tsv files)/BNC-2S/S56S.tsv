S0579	oh be it a rare breed
S0454	yes
S0579	so that's the black face be it
S0454	quite yes they be quite distinctive there wasn't any others i forget what they be call

S0454	yes those flower be lovely grandpa in the window
S0454	beautiful
S0579	oh they don't they yeah
S0454	yes it's lovely have flower in the house
S0579	yes i think we've get some i suppose now just go up to that gate up there somewhere
S0454	yes
S0579	on that on that right hand side there's suppose to be bulbs in well there be bulbs in there
S0454	well i expect you've get load of daffodils
S0579	course they don't come out so much cos the tree get too tall and keep the light out
S0454	yes that's the trouble yes that's right yes i want to get my
S0579	i think i have it dig in and they be still there
S0454	oh
S0579	and i take a trowel out
S0454	yes yes they don't go away do they
S0579	no no no they they don't die off no in fact they keep multiply all those little bulbs
S0454	mm yes
S0579	yes i must take them out and put them somewhere
S0454	yes i need to get my fence down at the back cos it's too high and it's block all the light
S0579	cos your in your in er
S0454	yes
S0579	be it oh
S0454	well they're like one point eight metre fence but they didn't
S0579	oh fence
S0454	er put them on the grind to begin with they start them off about twenty centimetres above the grind they're over two metres
S0579	oh
S0454	it's only a tiny garden so it's block all the light
S0579	so it's
S0454	yes well i'm wonder about saw a bite off the top because they've get two bar so i could take it down to the top bar and it wouldn't show much that would be about that much it's about six inch isn't it
S0579	oh that's not much no
S0454	no well it might not be enough to make a difference
S0579	oh oh well
S0454	but it's worth a try do you think
S0579	can you knock them can you knock them all down if you want to
S0454	i could do i own them all
S0579	oh well then so well yes
S0454	it seem a bite silly cos it's a new house and i feel erm
S0579	er spoil it no
S0454	bite bad yes might spoil it but
S0579	cos we we find all the tree round here actually
S0454	yes you see tree would too be too big for the space
S0579	yeah in yours yeah yeah
S0454	and i think even a hedge would take up too much room but what i need i should've put in lower fence cos the one at the back and the side they put in
S0579	yeah
S0454	but i pay for the one in the middle and i shouldn't've do that i should've erm
S0579	yeah
S0454	cos if you want the free one it be just wire and rail but that's no good either i mean a wire and rail
S0579	no
S0454	be nothing but i need something in between so i should've really pay for my own fence
S0579	yeah
S0454	i suppose over time that's what i'll do i'll just have them
S0454	replace and put in one point five metre or
S0579	yeah or
S0454	i don't know i'll have to have a look but it's a bite annoy it's block out all the light
S0579	yes well we have we have them all go up the back gate at one time and i think i cut those down cos it's
S0454	oh right yes
S0579	in no time you get a there almost
S0454	oh right yes
S0579	but we oh we do have now i think we've get roses grow all around on the side there
S0454	oh that's nice yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	roses be lovely
S0579	i think that's rise er and and also the spring bulbs be in there somewhere
S0454	yes

S0579	oh yes
S0454	sort of stretch yes quite difficult
S0454	yeah
S0579	yeah well there we go
S0454	but i like it it's nice it's relax
S0454	you sleep well afterwards
S0579	have you have you get a you've get a little place you say you go to
S0454	they do it in the school
S0579	oh yes the school
S0454	it's a professional erm leisure centre but they do outreach class so they come
S0579	oh i see
S0454	to us so that's quite nice and it's only five pound a session which be actually quite cheap
S0579	oh well quite good yeah
S0454	it's pretty good and there's only five people in the class i'm get a good deal
S0579	oh well yeah
S0454	so i don't want to tell anyone in my town about it in case they start show up
S0579	oh no no no
S0454	that'll be annoy
S0579	yeah that's right no no
S0454	yes
S0579	who
S0454	yeah
S0579	who support all that do the council support it
S0454	erm that's the leisure centre they somehow make money out of that
S0579	don't have too much out of you then
S0454	no i don't quite understand they don't advertise very well cos you'd think they'd be put leaflets through people's door or something but they don't do any of that
S0579	i have a feel there's something like that in there
S0454	it's a good idea and they hire local teachers so i suppose they're not bring them out from they're hire someone who live in the town and then they take their cut and they have to hire the room but i suppose they don't have enormous overheads compare to hire a leisure centre
S0579	no no no no that's right
S0454	hire a room might be in a school be only about ten pound for an hour
S0454	so it's not a huge amount
S0579	oh no no
S0454	then they're pay the instructor another ten and they take the remainder i suppose
S0579	oh well that sound reasonable
S0454	yes i suppose it work out quite well in fact maybe that's the way things should go they should just
S0579	do you go weekly to that
S0454	yeah i've be go weekly yes
S0579	oh well that's nice
S0454	yes quite tire though you'd be surprise

S0579	i i yeah i send them down it be part of the group
S0454	ah right ah yes that must've be a big move
S0579	well yes the that's right it be a big move there i suppose

S0579	cos that that man my dad be i suppose be one of the people book down to start the factory off like
S0454	yes quite excite
S0579	it be quite excite yes
S0454	yes be that still go that factory use to be when i be younger cos i remember it
S0579	yes i i'm not sure whether it's what's happen to it now i think there be lot of other mini factories build on the ground
S0454	oh right
S0579	cos i remember go up to way that way on the on
S0454	yes
S0579	i seem to remember look over and see it have all be erm develop
S0454	oh right oh interest
S0579	what use to happen
S0454	probably be quite small before wasn't it
S0579	cos oddly enough erm er your er 's brother he work in cellophane under my dad
S0454	oh oh isn't that funny
S0579	something like that something happen
S0454	yes
S0579	we always remember you see no one ever argue with my dad
S0454	no
S0579	what he say go
S0454	yeah well they must've trust him if he be send down to start up a new factory that's a big responsibility isn't it
S0579	yeah well yes and i suppose wartime it be even more responsibility cos
S0454	yes
S0579	most of the sort of er people at the top end be the in the military call up
S0454	ah they get call up ah right
S0579	yeah and so then people like my dad be older cos he be in the first world
S0454	he be too old to go yeah
S0579	he be in the first world war not the second
S0454	yes yes
S0579	so he be erm more or less in charge of weekend in the whole factory or something
S0454	cor yeah that's quite a responsibility

S0579	they have something of that size yeah
S0454	oh that's huge
S0579	yeah

S0454	but i remember the smell of it when i be grow up you could smell it yeah
S0579	yeah that's you could smell and the smoke go up too from there yeah

S0454	which be not that dissimilar in term of vocabulary quite similar
S0579	be it yes
S0454	in the accent's different but the actual when you see it write down
S0579	yeah
S0454	you can see it quite clearly what's link
S0579	well how many languages have you get under your sleeve now
S0454	mm erm spanish
S0579	yeah
S0454	and japanese
S0579	oh right
S0454	just about get english not quite there
S0579	oh well know about that
S0454	but still learn but arabic i never get very far with
S0579	that's tough go
S0454	that be very tough go yeah
S0579	they write leave the wrong way round don't they arabic
S0454	yes that's right no it's not easy at all
S0579	yeah i can imagine that's difficult no no no no

S0579	yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	to go back there
S0454	no
S0454	i'd have i'd have enough the last year and a half i'd really have enough
S0454	yes but i want to save up for the house so
S0579	now you've get it
S0454	it be the quickest way to legally shortcut the system so
S0579	oh be it
S0454	cos i didn't have to pay tax
S0579	oh
S0454	and that be what cripple you in this country
S0579	yeah
S0454	er your tax bill because it's not just the income tax it's the national insurance
S0579	yes a lot yeah
S0454	and then the other thing be your rent the rent's horrendous in this country so
S0579	yeah
S0454	with those together it's difficult to save so i just think well i'm go to shortcut it
S0579	and buy one
S0454	yes
S0579	oh
S0454	no mortgage
S0579	no
S0454	it's nice
S0579	no er i bet everyone be interest what you do there

S0579	out of your own money not pay rent or anything
S0454	that's right and i can rent that second bedroom out
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah so it make yes it make life very comfortable
S0579	yes yeah no that's really super
S0454	have you rent it out already have you
S0579	but only with airbnb so just erm
S0454	oh i see
S0579	a few nights a week cos i don't really want someone there all the time
S0454	it could be a bite bore with er one sort
S0579	yes but i mean people keep ask me
S0454	mm
S0579	can can we rent it every week and i keep say no
S0454	oh no oh cos people who be in there have be ask to
S0579	yes people stay short term say well look i'm down here every week so can i just rent it five days a week until august until now i've say no but i mean i think it's just probably a case of find the right person
S0454	yeah
S0579	but i don't really want to advertise it cos i don't want to be stick with people i don't like
S0454	oh no no no
S0579	but erm
S0454	you don't really know who you like until you've have them though do you
S0579	well that's the trouble isn't it you can't tell from
S0579	i mean what be you go to tell from an email or even a phone call there's there's
S0579	i mean they need to be in the house what i've say to this next lady who's come in two weeks be look you can come and stay for five days and we'll make a decision base on that
S0454	yeah
S0579	erm
S0454	cos i wouldn't want you or me to be uncomfortable so

S0579	i couldn't draw circle
S0454	on my school report it use to say
S0454	effort a realisation c
S0454	and that be be generous
S0579	i be well that's yes
S0454	i use to have straight as on my report apart from
S0579	yeah
S0454	art never get on with art although i quite like make things from clay
S0454	i have find i'm better with that sort of thing
S0579	oh yes rather than draw yeah
S0454	yes but then that's more shape it isn't it it's not that difficult
S0579	cos dad wasn't bad at sketch be he
S0454	no he's pretty good actually
S0579	but i've i've see one or two of his things he's sketch
S0454	yeah yes not bad
S0579	he's give up now
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes that's right he give up for a bite and he never really get back into it
S0579	oh well should have plenty of time
S0454	he's get lot of interest which be good cos he do he i think he do french didn't he for quite a while
S0579	do he do french do he
S0454	mm when he have retire
S0454	and he's get the yeah spin and things and all sort yeah
S0579	oh
S0454	yeah so that's good
S0579	i remember that mum well she must've know a bite of french i suppose do she
S0454	mum's never get into languages have she she's never really get on with them
S0579	oh well they use to be the convent when she be there
S0454	yes they must've do yeah
S0579	yeah i think convent yes
S0454	we're not much good in this country at languages be we
S0579	no we expect everybody to speak english
S0454	that's the trouble yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	because of that
S0579	and some guy say that to me once
S0454	well yes it's true apparently it's get worse though because of globalisation yes more people speak english but with the rise of countries like russia and china
S0579	mm
S0454	and their power they expect people to speak to them in their language
S0579	they want chinese
S0454	they expect people to speak to them in their language
S0579	yeah that's right yeah
S0454	and the british can't compete with that whereas other european countries can they'll say fine we'll learn russian
S0579	yeah
S0454	fine we'll learn chinese and they do so britain's go to get in more and more trouble over this it's interest
S0579	yes i i though somewhere in the middle east that happen with me once
S0454	mm
S0579	i be and i go up to somebody and er i didn't know what he be say very much and he recognise that and he say to me you english you expect to us to speak your language but you won't learn ours he use to say to me
S0454	yes it's true though isn't it
S0579	i think that's probably true i suppose yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	and their country use to say that try and do in their country
S0454	that's right i mean it's different in your own country cos you know that's fine
S0579	yeah
S0454	but when you travel it's true we do
S0579	do
S0454	expect people to speak english and we're a bite surprise when they don't but of course we shouldn't really be surprise
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	suppose it depend where they work though if someone work in tourism you would expect them to speak english cos it be
S0579	yeah
S0454	a global language isn't it
S0579	probably yeah
S0454	but if someone work in construction well there's no particular reason for them to learn
S0579	no
S0454	if they're work in the middle like they might cos it's like very much the lingua franca
S0579	well your language you've get quite good at languages haven't you
S0454	yeah i don't like them i've decide
S0579	yeah
S0454	i can do it but it's not a something i enjoy
S0579	no no
S0454	i find it quite annoy it's very tire speak another language i find
S0579	well yeah actually you never quite know you've get it right do you no no
S0454	that's right and you can never quite guess it exactly what you want to say or i never could i think
S0579	oh
S0454	you'd have to be incredibly good to get to that point so you're always kind of approximate
S0579	oh
S0454	which be frustrate i find
S0579	be quite good at erm
S0454	yeah she be wasn't she
S0579	french language i remember she never admit be well but whenever we use to go to france she would always argue argue with the chap
S0579	barter with the frenchman
S0454	that's good
S0579	cos she yeah she be able to come away the winner i think
S0454	yes
S0579	oh i know once yeah she be somewhere suppose they must've be in france and she want two of something rather than just one the chap only have one
S0454	mm
S0579	and so he say to your mum stay there i run away i come back with another one and he do so so
S0579	yeah so she obviously understand what he be say
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0579	oh she always say the the language teacher she have wasn't very good
S0454	no well i think look back at school my teachers be terrible
S0579	what in in the er in the french
S0454	in secondary school absolutely awful
S0579	yeah
S0454	so i have this one in year seven when i be eleven she be suicidal i mean
S0579	oh
S0454	actually threaten to jump out of a window a very highly string woman and once you know we wouldn't be quiet so she get out on the roof
S0579	do she
S0454	during the class it be a flat roof but nevertheless a roof
S0579	mm
S0454	and she say if you don't be quiet i'm go to jump out of the window class we just have enough of her i mean she be like a child attention seek child you know
S0579	oh oh dear yes yes yes
S0454	so we say go on then so she off she go out on the roof and we lock her out and we leave her there
S0579	oh dear
S0454	so then she be like let me in let me in and of course no one let her in so she have to go round to the next class
S0579	oh you you
S0454	and she come when she come back in she say right all of you be on detention tomorrow and we didn't turn up
S0579	oh
S0454	and there wasn't anything she could do i mean how ridiculous threaten to jump out of the window when you're the teacher
S0579	yeah yeah yeah they be a tough lot of people in your classroom then
S0454	oh i don't know she shouldn't've be teach
S0579	mm yes
S0454	so we never learn anything with her that be about two years
S0579	which school be that then
S0454	saint 's dad's school
S0579	oh that's your father's school
S0454	yeah very highly string the
S0579	oh oh well
S0454	language department then we have this german teacher who couldn't control the class and he he crash his car at the weekend into someone and instead of check to see if they be okay he do a hit and run he drive off and leave them i mean they could've be kill for all he know
S0579	oh golly yeah
S0454	but the the witness saw the car number plate and they tell the police the car number plate and they find him and because it be a hit and run he end up on the front page of the local newspaper
S0579	oh no
S0454	and of course everybody find out at the school
S0579	who it be yeah
S0454	he get ban from drive and have to come on our school but and of course he never live it down so that be that
S0579	oh
S0454	he never have any control
S0579	be he a teacher what
S0454	yes er my german teacher and he in the end he just start cry in the middle of the class
S0579	oh
S0454	and that be that we never have any respect for him
S0579	oh dear man to do
S0454	no fancy drive off after hit someone that's dreadful isn't it yes
S0579	well that's terrible really isn't it panic i suppose
S0454	he do but that's not good enough i
S0579	well not really someone could be die on the road yeah
S0454	no that's right they could've be die just very callous
S0579	yeah that's right
S0454	but he should've be in prison i think for that i think that's terrible
S0579	yeah
S0454	drive off after an accident
S0579	yeah
S0454	be i mean it's
S0579	you still read about that occasionally now don't you people just drive off
S0454	oh yes yes yes there be that case the other day wasn't there with that erm burglar and the police be chase him and they have one of those stingers you know they throw out those mat that puncture the tyres
S0579	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0454	and he drive deliberately straight at the policeman and kill him erm and he's go to jail for quite a long time that one
S0579	yes well
S0454	he didn't show any remorse
S0579	no no no you just see someone on the spur of the moment do something like that but sound terrible yeah
S0454	yes he be on drug at the time
S0579	oh oh well yes
S0454	yes his friend's go to jail too though
S0579	i've never er i've never don't think i've ever try them
S0454	sorry
S0579	i never try them so
S0579	drug no no
S0454	but his friend go to jail too who be a passenger and i think well that be a bite mean
S0579	yeah
S0454	because there wasn't much he could do it would be spur of the moment you know the he's drive at the policeman
S0579	yeah
S0454	so you're not really an accomplice to murder be you
S0579	not really no
S0454	i think that be a bite mean
S0579	yeah
S0454	that you know he may've egg him or he may not but either way the responsibility lie with the driver
S0579	yeah
S0454	and not with the passenger
S0579	yeah
S0454	so i don't know maybe there be some extenuate circumstances but seem quite harsh
S0454	but they're always like that the police aren't they if you kill one of their own
S0579	yeah you're in trouble
S0454	oh that's it the book be gonna be throw at you
S0579	oh they'll throw that's right
S0454	and that's it and
S0579	yeah
S0454	you'll get a hard time in prison over that
S0579	yeah
S0454	they won't like that
S0579	be it prisoners some be that prisoners now yes think it be
S0454	dad
S0579	yes some prisoners when they commit crimes against the norm they get a bad time in prison don't they
S0454	yeah dad say that
S0579	they do sometimes yes
S0454	especially if it's children
S0579	yeah that's right
S0454	they get a very hard time in prison
S0579	oh that's that's that's what i hear from them
S0454	and they use to be protect use to be if you be a paedophile and you go to prison they wouldn't tell the other prisoners
S0579	oh
S0454	what you'd do
S0579	cos they'll beat you up
S0454	because they know yeah or worse you know they could kill you er but they stop protect them i don't know whether that be deliberate
S0579	oh
S0454	but there's be a lot of deaths in custody over the last year it's not only because of that but there's be a huge increase in suicides and
S0579	yeah
S0454	there be a stab at the dartmoor prison one prisoner stab another to death really gruesome about december
S0579	be it that recently oh
S0454	very recently yeah make the the news but that dad say it's because they're very understaffed and they can't send in one prison guard on his own if someone's get a weapon so they have to wait so they have to wait until this guy be stab to death and then go and get him
S0579	i know your dad take me into the prison once not into
S0454	oh right
S0579	not into where the people be but sit outside look at the prisoners you could see them all carry stuff around
S0454	yes they work up there don't they they do they have job up there
S0579	yeah that's where they work yeah they could see them go around
S0454	yeah which be good i think because it give them occupy your mind as well and they pay them actually
S0579	they also yeah
S0454	that not very much
S0579	oh well that's better nothing i suppose
S0454	yes but i think it's about eleven pound a week
S0579	i think your dad be easily recognise i think they recognise him when he be there like
S0454	yes
S0579	some of the prisoners
S0454	that's good
S0579	yeah
S0454	well it's good they've get someone to talk to who's not a member of the prison service because you can see it'd be very difficult in there
S0579	your dad be very good at talk to them like that
S0454	he would be yeah good listener
S0579	yeah that's right yeah he's always be interest in prisons hasn't he since young as a young boy
S0454	he have yes that's right yes it's it's a pity in a way that he didn't go into it when he be younger i think i think he would've
S0579	yeah
S0454	enjoy that as a career actually could've work his way up
S0579	well he could've be that's right governor of the whatever
S0454	that's right yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	cos some of those chap get pay quite well now don't they
S0454	they do yeah you know it's a lady governor up at dartmoor she's very good apparently
S0579	i think i think tell me about something like that
S0454	yes unusual though still still a very male dominate industry
S0579	yeah not surprise yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	well do they have lady prisoners in dartmoor then
S0454	no no so it's very unusual then they've put a woman in charge because there aren't any women there
S0579	yeah that's that's it no
S0454	i suppose they can have prison guard who be women but still
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah
S0579	do your dad go into the cells at all or not
S0454	i don't know i'll have to ask him actually
S0579	yeah
S0454	i'm not sure yeah
S0579	yeah cos such a tiny space isn't it their they have in the cells
S0454	yes and the they're only build for one but most of them have two
S0579	two yeah yeah they
S0454	yes that's not right
S0579	no no yeah
S0454	and that be in victorian days when standards weren't quite what they be today so
S0579	well yes i know yes it's yeah
S0454	that's pretty bad double people up and they're lock up twenty three hours a day most of them
S0579	what even today do they
S0454	don't have enough staff to let them exercise and things it's pretty bad
S0579	oh so they've gotta keep them in yeah
S0454	yes that's quite serious
S0579	i think not very long ago they have a bite of a riot there didn't they not too far back
S0454	yes that's right they do yeah up on the rooves weren't they
S0579	yeah i remember see the picture

S0454	well apparently it wasn't him jimmy savile people do complain but it be hush up which be terrible isn't it not not the children the nurse complain about jimmy savile and be tell to be quiet
S0579	yeah that's terrible really
S0454	it's outrageous isn't it
S0579	yes that's right i mean the nurse
S0454	and they would've be worry about lose their job so
S0579	i suppose something like that yeah all all powerful
S0454	and just that's right yes
S0579	and he er yes he be be a paedophile wasn't he savile
S0454	that's right there be one at the japanese embassy when i work there
S0579	there be what
S0454	one at the japanese embassy i work with
S0579	be there
S0454	you know they've get diplomatic immunity so be nothing anyone could do
S0579	no no no no
S0454	that's terrible though
S0579	that's where you be work be you
S0454	yeah
S0579	oh work
S0454	very senior minister as well nasty
S0579	oh that's terrible isn't it really
S0454	yes but they get away with it even if you tell the police the british police can't do anything to them
S0579	oh
S0454	cos they've get immunity can't arrest them
S0579	oh oh oh that's no good
S0454	they probably complain to the japanese government but
S0454	at worst all they're gonna do be move them back to japan
S0579	oh
S0454	they can't actually arrest them
S0579	why not
S0454	cos all diplomats have diplomatic immunity
S0579	oh be it diplomats be it
S0454	yes
S0579	oh i see yeah
S0454	so they can't touch them which be why they get away with it might be a bite cold grandpa i'll make you another one if you want
S0579	oh no it's i outside okay
S0454	yes bad probably very common though unfortunately and sadly in place where like school
S0579	yeah i mean it's even worse when it's in school
S0454	yes but probably very common cos that's where they'll end up work isn't it
S0579	you don't er yeah
S0454	and you can put all the police check you want but the fact be it's all online nowadays and
S0579	yeah
S0454	that's pretty difficult to police
S0579	yeah i suppose it be yeah
S0454	so they'll be get away with it yeah so i hope the unfortunately the police don't have the money do they but i hope when they do that they'll just lock these people up as a priority
S0579	i remember tell me a story about when she be teach in london a little bite
S0454	yeah
S0579	and so what what be she oh she must've be tell somebody off or something like that one of the children something like that
S0454	yes
S0579	and the father turn up next day and say you talk like that to my young son again and i'll be after you and he roll up his sleeves
S0454	oh dear
S0579	frighten her
S0454	scary isn't it
S0579	yeah that's right yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	and a lot of the time the school just brush it off because they don't want the paperwork
S0579	no no yes
S0454	and the you know that sort of thing with the police in it always look bad on the school
S0579	oh yes
S0454	so they're not protect the the teachers
S0579	no no
S0454	that's right and they need to i mean that's that's a criminal offence threaten a a teacher like that or threaten anyone for that matter
S0579	cos i remember my young days at school headmaster he always carry a cane
S0454	that's for the parent
S0579	er yeah
S0454	now you know why it wasn't for the children
S0579	no that's right
S0454	it's for when the angry father come in
S0579	yeah well that's they they use to carry it around with them
S0579	children always use to get the stick
S0579	it be abandon though wasn't it it be
S0454	yes that be stop yes
S0579	i know it's a regular thing that someone be send to the headmaster you're in he be in trouble like he would give them a couple of whack
S0579	probably didn't do anybody any harm i suppose
S0454	well don't know they might've grow up violent themselves
S0579	well i suppose
S0454	that i think that's the danger with it isn't it that
S0454	if you give the message particularly to young boys
S0579	yeah
S0454	that violence be a good way to solve problems then
S0579	yeah
S0454	they might go home and beat up their wife when they're older so
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	i think from i think from a psychological point of view it can do a lot of damage
S0579	damage yeah
S0454	that they they think that's acceptable behaviour and the the message there be the most powerful one can beat up
S0579	yeah
S0454	the the weaker one which be probably the woman in the relationship
S0579	yes it be yeah
S0454	so you don't wanna hear that
S0579	no
S0454	no
S0579	if take charge he's usually dead
S0454	that's right
S0579	we've we've all some sort yes
S0454	yes yes
S0579	yeah so of course it have change a lot of course i remember
S0454	yes
S0579	in our younger days the ladies you go to a pub the ladies have to stay outside
S0454	yeah
S0579	even in my day like
S0454	although you still don't see women on their own in pubs which i think's interest not because it's illegal but they just don't go on their own do they
S0579	they don't go no no no
S0454	so we talk about equality and certainly in the law we have equality
S0579	yeah
S0454	there's nothing to stop me go to a pub on my own nobody do
S0579	no that's it
S0454	when do you ever see a woman on her own in a pub but you see men go in for a pint all the time after work don't you on their own
S0579	yeah
S0454	and they'll stand at the bar and they'll have their pint and then they'll leave
S0579	right
S0454	even go for a meal you know nothing to do with alcohol women rarely go out for a meal on their own
S0579	i suppose not no
S0454	but it's the do thing for men that's perfectly okay
S0579	that's die away a bite now though i suppose you know ladies who go in together sometimes
S0454	yeah
S0579	i i we're go to the pub sometimes and they have
S0454	yes yes you see group of women don't you
S0579	i've see i've see seven or eight women sit around the table
S0454	yes but not on their own
S0579	not on their own no
S0454	i think that's quite interest so we're a long way off socially social equality i think
S0579	yeah
S0454	we may be there in the eye of the law
S0579	yeah
S0454	but social equality isn't there and it's not men stop women it's ingrain i suppose from when you're young because you don't see any women do it yourself then it doesn't occur to you to go and do it you'd feel you be rock the boat but i mean how can eat a meal be rock the boat
S0579	well i certainly in my day with the ladies yeah they they always stand outside
S0454	yes
S0579	they never go inside the pub
S0454	no
S0579	the men would bring the glass of something out for them like
S0454	oh right
S0579	yeah cos i suppose now of course you often get more meals in a pub than you use to get
S0454	that's right it's different it's move away from alcohol like today we be in a pub
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	and probably no one be drink be they
S0579	eat yeah
S0454	i mean we look at the table around us
S0579	yeah
S0454	those young boys have a pint
S0579	yeah
S0454	but they be pretty young they be only about twenty weren't they when we first come in
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	but the other table that have they have fruit juice and the table behind us later on they have water
S0579	yeah
S0454	and we have water whereas in days go by you didn't go to a pub and order water
S0579	no no
S0454	that would've be really frown upon if you go in and say i'll have two glass of water please
S0579	no
S0454	and now that's the norm and food be the the main business
S0579	yeah i remember in 's house my mum's er 's house i would say it be forbid alcohol in the house you couldn't bring anything in
S0454	oh right
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes and erm dad's family as well
S0454	when grandpa be grow up
S0454	he say there be no alcohol in his house
S0579	oh be it oh
S0454	but he have uncles he have an uncle who use to make his own homemade
S0454	you know like rhubarb wine and
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	you know the really traditional not grapes cos they didn't have
S0579	dad use to make er wine didn't he once
S0454	yes but erm my grandfather be only about eighteen and he'd never drink before
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	and he get offer in this relative's house a glass of rhubarb wine and so he drink it have never have alcohol before and you can imagine
S0579	oh no
S0454	he be not well afterwards
S0579	oh dear
S0579	actually he have not all that long time ago when we come here even forty years ago i suppose now something like that i be walk in the village and the local chap who use mum use to chat to quite a lot here use to chat to he be a local farmer he use to make his own wine
S0454	oh that's nice
S0579	well his own beers anyway not win
S0454	yes
S0579	and he stop it he er stop dad
S0579	dig in get him a mug there try one of these mr sir he would bring it down it be full of straw as well
S0454	oh dear
S0579	i didn't drink any of it yeah
S0454	the local cider though a lot of farm in
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	you know not quite round here but a bite further down they do cider still don't they on the farm and they sell it off
S0579	oh yes yeah
S0454	it's quite nice it's not bad
S0579	it's him actually use to do er you know be put on these er display years ago
S0454	yes
S0579	he do one for ciders
S0454	oh right oh that's nice it's good fun
S0579	yeah yeah that's right he do one of those
S0454	yes
S0579	i've forget
S0579	who he do it with but he oh on his own he would come here five years ago
S0454	yes that's right he do very well didn't he
S0579	yeah yeah yeah he do well and he sell it on well at the right time actually
S0454	yes yeah he do well he do
S0579	yeah really
S0454	very good
S0579	yeah that's right yeah
S0454	good head for business the family
S0579	oh well well he do alright yes
S0454	and better work for themselves i think the s it's interest isn't it your family
S0454	because you've you know run your own business
S0579	yeah
S0454	do and even the ladies of the family if you think about what they've do they've mostly work for themselves or they've certainly be happiest work for their mum
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	have work for other people but she be always peripatetic so she never really have a boss do she she go round all these school
S0579	not really not really
S0454	but i mean really you're autonomous in that job
S0579	yeah
S0454	you don't see your boss you might see them once a term for a meet
S0579	no no
S0454	but you're very much expect to manage yourself
S0579	yes
S0454	and the same and then they've both run private businesses successfully from their house
S0579	yeah
S0454	and i suppose she do work for a school she's probably the most conventional of all of them isn't she but
S0579	i i suppose yeah
S0454	work for a school for a long time
S0579	yeah
S0454	but didn't really like it and erm
S0579	yeah
S0454	teach she do her own teach didn't she from home
S0579	in fact now i think when he's be back in bahrain recently she's take on a few pupils
S0454	yeah so she's run her own business again
S0579	yeah yeah no as well yeah
S0454	yes so it's quite interest
S0579	she's still do it yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	and i i think she get pay quite well for it
S0454	oh i imagine she do
S0579	these you know these
S0454	yeah
S0454	yeah i know that's right
S0579	and you you make some nice little occupation out of it
S0454	yes that's a good idea
S0579	it's also something to do when she's be over in bahrain
S0454	yes i think you need something don't you
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	yes it'd be bore otherwise and it's not like she's new out there so she hasn't get
S0579	well she know the language
S0454	yes but also that she can't go and explore place
S0579	no
S0454	new so she need another interest
S0579	i know yes er 's that's it i mean we use to be very careful when we use to go out with him cos
S0454	mm
S0579	cos the sun oh it be that's right she if you go out in certain part of the world that part of the world the ladies always have to have their arm cover up
S0454	excuse me ah yes in saudi
S0579	in in saudi that's right
S0454	yeah
S0579	and you use to get get stop by the police once out there
S0454	dear
S0579	typical of tell them to buzz off
S0454	yeah i bet she do
S0579	she do and er and poor old you mustn't say things like that cos
S0579	cos if you do anything wrong i be the one who have to go to jail for let you do it
S0454	well that's probably true actually yes
S0579	yeah oh yes
S0454	that's right it's the husband they'd arrest
S0579	yeah
S0579	i think time have change now i suppose they may just although i know when we be there somewhere what do we find we go to somewhere a hotel i suppose
S0454	mm
S0579	and the lady come in dress in all those arabic clothe
S0454	oh really
S0579	yeah and then in no time er when she wasn't get into the hotel like she go off and change
S0579	come down in all the local
S0454	she be probably a saudi lady
S0454	away for the weekend cos you probably wouldn't get away with that if you live in bahrain cos everyone would know you
S0579	no no that's right
S0454	so then you know people would speak badly of you so i bet she be a saudi lady
S0579	oh yes suddenly she come down dress as a like a new yorker almost you might say
S0454	yeah
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	that's right we use to see saudi girls sometimes in the uae they would dress western
S0579	yes western yeah
S0454	erm but you could tell they be always quite badly behave actually
S0579	oh be they
S0454	it be quite surprise yes it's cos they be away from their families
S0579	oh yes families yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	quite funny
S0579	cos i suppose in saudi it's still pretty strong there
S0454	yeah very repressive
S0579	repressive on the the ladies yeah
S0454	yes yes that's right
S0579	cos i think when when we've be when to saudi he be very very careful how he would dress
S0454	mm
S0579	the ladies i mean
S0454	mm
S0579	otherwise he be say yes he go to jail for let me do it like
S0454	mm yeah it's true
S0579	yeah but that's die away now hasn't it
S0454	no no still go strong out there
S0579	be it towards the ladies
S0454	it's very repressive
S0579	oh
S0454	they've get the vote for the first time
S0579	yeah
S0454	that's about it that's the and they oh there be more job for women now apparently
S0579	yeah
S0454	but they can't drive still that's pretty restrictive
S0579	can't drive still
S0454	yeah can't travel without a male
S0579	be that just saudi be it
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	bahrain be okay be it
S0454	oh yes bahrain's fine yes
S0579	oh yes i think yes
S0454	it's only saudi yeah so
S0579	yeah
S0454	's alright
S0579	cos she yeah it's funny isn't it cos i mean all those saudi kings and queen they like come to have a chat with the royalty over here don't they
S0454	yes
S0579	mm well
S0454	well i think the royal family the least the leaders of the royal family be quite progressive but the problem be they can't impose change because the
S0579	yeah
S0454	the sheiks and erm well particularly the religious leaders be very strong and powerful so if they try to force through change then there might be an uprise
S0579	be trouble yeah
S0454	and that's what they're worry about it be not that they're oppose to change in fact it be the late king who die last year who push through the the vote reform for women before he die and that's kind of his legacy
S0579	oh
S0454	but it's be very slow the change
S0579	oh so everyone's happier now be do they or don't they vote
S0454	it be i don't know how much power i mean it's not like vote for the government here where that actually bring about change i mean these be local elections so i don't know how much change that really bring about
S0579	oh change no
S0454	although women can stand for office which be interest that's new too
S0579	oh well i think recently oh no that's where be it there be a lady in charge of things somewhere far east i think china or be that japan somewhere
S0454	mm it's not japan
S0579	or one of those other ones
S0454	yes japan's quite restrictive like that
S0579	it's a rather nice look girl there who come on
S0454	oh i don't know
S0579	can't think of her name now she's in the she's in the far east somewhere i think
S0454	mm mm
S0579	i remember when we i remember when we go to china by ourselves years ago up to when we go er they didn't have they er have this communist system over there

S0454	yeah
S0579	and she didn't like him
S0454	yeah
S0579	probably right i suppose in one way
S0454	yes that's right i think later on there be
S0579	oh
S0454	a question mark about him wasn't there
S0579	yeah there be some
S0454	he get investigate
S0579	yeah there be
S0454	i don't i don't think anything ever come of it
S0579	no but there be obviously things against him and and
S0454	yes
S0579	there be
S0454	that's right but she obviously
S0579	suppose he be think be obviously right i suppose then yeah mm
S0454	but she obviously get a sense didn't she somehow or yes
S0579	yeah she she she somehow felt that he didn't want to he wouldn't talk she use to go out of the room when he come in
S0454	yeah that's quite unusual for cos she be quite a chatty
S0579	yeah
S0454	i can imagine she be quite a chatty girl
S0579	yeah but when he come in she would just
S0454	she would leave yeah
S0579	she just hat the sight of him and she'd just walk out
S0454	it's funny isn't it
S0579	erm yeah and he use to comment to me she doesn't seem to like me or something like that use to say
S0454	yeah
S0579	no but as it turn out she be probably right about him
S0454	yes that's right yeah
S0579	yeah
S0454	it'd be interest to ask her what it be whether how she know
S0579	i think i think
S0454	mm
S0579	i expect she i think she just take a natural dislike to him i don't know why
S0454	yeah i think it probably be quite instinctive on her part
S0579	i think so with she be somebody
S0454	she's get a good
S0579	who who stay with us a few nights and be rude to him all that time and would walk away out of the room
S0454	yeah
S0579	if but there be something she didn't like about him yeah

S0454	oh like a oh really like the coconuts
S0579	yeah whatever it be be fall down
S0454	oh that's clever
S0579	yeah so that's use to happen there you
S0579	drive over these things you'd be break up something
S0454	oh
S0579	yeah
S0454	that's pretty useful
S0579	yeah it be useful for the locals
S0454	yeah
S0579	but oh yeah mum didn't like him at all i must say
S0579	well didn't like him
S0454	yeah didn't like him
S0579	yeah didn't like him no
S0454	that's funny
S0579	instinctively i suppose yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	well she's yeah that's right i suppose actually yeah i suppose where do she meet up with bahrain i suppose
S0454	must've be bahrain yeah
S0579	cos i remember when we when we arrive in bahrain at whatever club he be at this be where we're go to have a meal with
S0454	mm
S0579	he must've be part of the family part of the company i suppose
S0454	yes a lot of them have their own club
S0579	yeah i think so
S0454	subsidise food and things
S0579	and and 's that be as we arrive and walk in he be call out all the time 's parent be here 's parent be here we felt rather embarrass
S0579	he be he be the big chief of course of all those people
S0454	yeah
S0579	and there we be have him yell our name out 's parent be here 's parent be here oh dear
S0454	guest of honour
S0579	yeah that's right
S0454	you be honour
S0579	yes that's right turn out alright
S0454	yes yes 's very nice
S0579	yeah and you meet do you
S0454	yeah i haven't see him in years though
S0579	yeah he
S0454	not for a long time cos he didn't really settle back here do he wasn't that happy i don't think
S0579	not not really no i mean
S0454	he need the the workplace
S0579	he be
S0454	i mean a lot of men do i think don't they they enjoy work
S0579	yeah
S0454	and when they retire it's actually very hard for them
S0579	well tell me although he be a dutchman he hadn't be back to holland
S0454	no
S0579	since he be eighteen like
S0454	so he couldn't settle there probably either
S0579	no so he
S0454	in fact probably worse than the uk because it's not so multinational and he would've be use to a very multi ethnic workplace
S0579	yeah well he be yeah and of course he's serve in other part he's serve part in he do some work in south america i think somewhere
S0454	oh right
S0579	and also bits in and in bahrain of course as well
S0454	yes yes and i think that's even harder then to
S0579	yeah
S0454	settle when you come home
S0454	yes
S0579	and of course he's he's of course he's back in bahrain at the moment isn't he
S0454	that's right i expect he like it
S0579	yeah and big chief again for a short while
S0454	yes it's only suppose to be a year but i bet they'll offer to keep him on actually
S0579	i think they ask him to do five years
S0454	oh do they
S0579	and he say i'll only do one year and i'll think about it when i er when that's up
S0454	well that's sensible
S0579	so that's what he do then so er
S0454	yes
S0579	i don't i expect he'd want to come back i suppose yeah
S0454	i don't know
S0579	we don't know
S0454	i don't think he will actually
S0579	no
S0454	i i think he'll want to stay and will say i've have enough of this
S0579	because and come and visit
S0454	yeah i think that's more likely it would be
S0579	yeah
S0454	cos he's go to enjoy the company
S0579	yes it it's true when he be at home of course he be always the big boss everywhere and give instructions of course all that go
S0454	exactly i think that's very difficult
S0579	yeah yeah that would've be difficult for him i suppose
S0454	and then you're start again with friendships aren't you
S0579	yeah
S0454	so that's not easy
S0579	oddly enough 's meet up with a few friends she know when they be there years ago
S0454	she meet them again
S0579	meet meet them there now she's go back again recently
S0454	oh that's nice
S0579	she meet up with people she know years ago
S0454	oh that's lovely
S0579	they be still around
S0454	yeah yes that's nice for that she keep in contact with them
S0579	yeah that's right and she use to have contact with some er indian lady use to come and do some work
S0454	oh right
S0579	and she use to send the money back what she earn back to india like cos there be
S0454	yes that's right
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah they support their families a lot of them with like one salary might support ten people cos it'll go a lot further of course
S0579	yes yeah go further yes we we we learn this lady who always send her money back to her family
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes they be threaten in oman to start tax remittances
S0579	oh be they
S0454	because that would be a huge source of income for the government
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	and you'd only target foreigners then because the
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	it wouldn't be the locals do that
S0579	yeah
S0454	but it cause an outcry and they have to back down
S0579	back down do they yeah
S0454	because the truth be if those workers go elsewhere then it would cripple the economy
S0579	oh well
S0454	and they're not earn that much so
S0579	oh no
S0454	if you start tax them
S0579	yeah
S0454	even if it be only one percent it would upset a lot of people
S0579	yeah cos in bahrain at the moment be there ladies have a very poor choice of anything
S0454	yes
S0579	it's the men in charge the ladies second
S0454	yes i suppose that's still true
S0579	it's the same in in part of where yeah yeah
S0454	yeah it be very restrictive oman be better
S0579	yeah
S0454	but the uae be quite
S0579	firm
S0454	strict
S0579	strict yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	women in oman women work although they never get very high up but they do have job and they do drive cars whereas the uae they didn't really
S0579	oh
S0454	they didn't really work or if they do it be you know just for a year or so and then they'd get marry and then that'd be the end of it
S0579	yeah i know in bahrain it be a bite well i don't know about but it be or it use to be be always on to who and no whatever the customs be you must follow them
S0454	yeah
S0579	you're in you're not in england now
S0454	mm
S0579	cos she use to tell them all you know police come up and tell her that's not the way to dress to wear one of them might say she just cross them and tell them to away so
S0454	yeah
S0579	so yeah
S0454	it's difficult yeah
S0579	yeah for cos er the law he be the one in charge
S0454	yes but then on the other hand men don't have many restrictions on them so
S0579	yeah
S0454	he wouldn't realise what it's like to be on the receive end
S0579	receive end no
S0454	because as a man he could do pretty much
S0579	what you like
S0454	what he want
S0579	yeah
S0454	so he didn't really understand how repressive that might be to be tell now you have to do this you can't do this
S0579	i think for years it take some years before they allow ladies to drive over there saudi
S0454	mm in saudi they can't still
S0579	they still can't still now you say
S0454	no no they're not allow yeah in bahrain they can
S0579	oh it's bahrain they can yeah
S0454	yeah all over the gulf they can it's just saudi it's pretty bad isn't it
S0579	sound awful
S0454	so wouldn't've be able to drive so quite restrictive for her
S0579	oh
S0454	i mean they have drivers of course you know but still
S0579	well somebody drive you around yes
S0454	yes it's not the same be it
S0579	no no cos we when we visit be always able to give us a drive after you know he be in charge of the place
S0454	oh yes
S0579	so he use drive for every day and have the car to go with it
S0454	that's nice isn't it
S0579	yeah he's just the boss in charge and he
S0454	yeah
S0579	have these cars at his command so to speak
S0454	yeah
S0579	and yes well he work oh i suppose now he's go back again
S0454	yes
S0579	he'll be the king chief again i suppose
S0454	expect he's enjoy that
S0579	well that's right i think er what's the neighbour country
S0454	er
S0579	i think they're they're they're
S0454	i'm not sure oh i need to plug this in it's die a death alright i'll stop this
