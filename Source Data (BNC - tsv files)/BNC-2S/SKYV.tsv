S0058	and you need to be bother enough to actually go into to get it
S0179	yeah
S0058	mm interest
S0058	you're just gonna go in this way now
S0179	do you want to think about that question this one
S0058	oh sorry yeah huh huh
S0179	no actually
S0058	hmm
S0179	mm
S0058	ah
S0179	okay so what do you think of that idea
S0058	the idea um yeah i quite like it what be the er cottages like be they
S0179	be they you know the quality be very good
S0058	mm
S0179	er it's not or as in it wasn't it wasn't out and out luxurious
S0058	uh huh
S0179	in the same way that sort of maybe newer and swisher ones be so we're gonna have our own i think they've now pretty much all get flatscreen tvs they don't have their our own hot tubs
S0058	yeah
S0179	and that sort of thing
S0058	yeah
S0179	erm but they're very very comfortable
S0058	uh huh
S0179	erm they certainly er you know use to be er very good taste
S0058	yeah
S0179	taste i use use to so
S0058	hmm mm
S0179	erm nowadays but i think they're all gonna be heavily modernise since i be last there anyway
S0058	oh right okay so
S0179	cos then erm i erm we use to go to pen cywm
S0058	yeah
S0179	from when i be at sixth form onwards so i haven't actually be to the complex itself maybe seven years
S0058	yeah so they probably have all be
S0179	well we can see from the picture
S0058	yeah
S0179	erm
S0058	okay erm so i mean yeah pros and con i guess i guess er nice cottage you know erm i mean i think the the main thing be it's not worth obviously we're not gonna go if they won't give us it for
S0179	yes although to be fair it would be very little more expensive than the other one would have be just to have this one for the weekend and not use it
S0058	yeah it's ridiculous isn't it huh
S0179	we could of course just have it for a week
S0058	yeah i mean we could try and ask them and see if we can get it
S0179	don't i mean we could just go
S0058	or just go for the week yeah yeah we could do erm
S0179	have the entirety of a week off
S0058	so yeah so i mean if we do it friday to friday then we'd only need to have
S0179	still drive and fuel conserve petrol
S0058	ha ha
S0179	er it would be three to four days
S0058	you need to have four days off erm
S0179	i think i'm not sure that's what i want to do particularly at the moment i think the idea about not take leave be quite
S0058	yeah oh wow
S0179	oh deer
S0058	yeah oh deer
S0179	i though it be a fox to start with
S0058	yeah i do yeah
S0179	poor thing it be probably trap on that side
S0058	yeah ah
S0179	not hugely bright admittedly
S0058	no
S0179	unlike the car light which be come towards it
S0058	huh huh
S0179	see what i do there
S0058	i do see what you do there very good
S0179	mm i'm drive in high efficiency mode at the moment it's weird
S0058	ha ha just automatically
S0179	well no i mean sort of in that situation
S0058	you start off
S0179	yeah exactly
S0058	yeah get into the mind set yeah um i agree with you actually i'm not sure i particularly wanna have time off i think a short break would really do the job
S0179	yeah exactly i'm not sure it's
S0058	i mean it's pointless take leave for the sake of it if
S0179	yeah i mean if it be it's not necessarily that much further drive wise but if feel like it like mentally cos i've get so use to do that drive up north
S0058	yeah
S0179	so it feel like it's not a long way but obviously it be
S0058	yeah yes it be it be a long drive erm
S0179	it would be a complete change
S0058	yeah it would and it it would be maybe nice in the sense that we wouldn't feel like we kind of have to do anything
S0179	yeah i mean cos er there's so much there to do and i've do it all already
S0058	yeah we could just chill out do the things we want to there's no pressure to go anywhere or see anyone we don't know anyone in you know erm
S0179	and we could go up to aberystwyth sort of bite of retail therapy such as it be
S0058	indeed well i er yeah i'd quite like to do that erm and yeah have a wonder around aberystwyth go to the beach and mess about go shop get load of nice things from erm and do some stuff with leith's cookery bible
S0179	some champagne
S0058	some champagne bite of chill yeah i mean no hot tub but if the weather's not gonna be great then you you know it might not of particularly be the best thing anyway and it's pointless discount the cottage on that basis but
S0179	well they do have a pool which probably won't be open
S0058	they do have a pool ooh oh you mean an outdoor pool
S0179	yes
S0058	ah
S0179	like i say probably not gonna be open i'll continue my economy version cos i'm not brake down here i'm cover the brake as we're go across this t junction
S0058	yeah
S0179	cos there be no speed cameras and therefore i'm just gonna allow the car to bring itself down to speed i wouldn't normally do it but it's very clear
S0058	yeah mm yeah um i think i think that could be quite nice to be honest i'd quite like to do that
S0179	oh we be gonna get through on the light so we didn't have to brake there
S0058	nice very efficient
S0179	i know extremely efficient we could go down the motorway but um we'll just go through the centre because we can have a better look at the garage i'm curious
S0058	and it should be quiet
S0179	yes indeed erm what be you say about
S0058	erm yeah i think i think that could be really nice actually very relax erm
S0179	wander down the ah because it's in the village we can wander down the pub in the even
S0058	ah fabulous cos you really can't do that
S0179	you can it's just not easy
S0058	yeah oh that'd be nice yeah wander down the pub and then come back and have some dinner
S0179	the erm yeah have actually get a erm balcony overlook the valley
S0058	ah that sound quite nice
S0179	yes
S0058	yeah i agree with you that might be a bite weird but any of the other two
S0179	either of the other two
S0058	either of the other two might be nice which give it a bite you know give us a little more hope that neither of them will go or one er sorry one of them will be available
S0179	yeah they're both the same price which be a very sensible price structure
S0058	yeah yeah i mean i think it's worth just ask them if they can do a short break because we don't want it for a week erm yeah do that sound and just see what they say i mean
S0179	they probably will do i mean unfortunately it's no longer and cos they'd definitely have do it
S0058	mm oh yeah do you know i mean do your mam know these people at all no dammit
S0179	erm although to be fair we be just introduce ourselves yeah so i haven't meet you yet you use to know and
S0058	mm yeah
S0179	mm cos maybe they they're not just randomers they be i think they be sort of semi i think they be semi local sort of friends who have buy it from them
S0058	oh okay yeah
S0179	erm
S0058	so if you yeah so if you say i know and that will help ha
S0058	but yeah what do you think i think that could be quite nice and i think kind of have think about it i think it might be nice to do something a bite different
S0179	what be the idea
S0058	there be the
S0179	i mean we could check that out
S0058	yeah if we maybe look into that and just get some idea of price maybe and and that kind of thing erm
S0179	but not as relax
S0058	but yeah because of the travel and new place and i'd for one would certainly be like i have to see things
S0179	wow that's what you get for ease off early
S0058	yeah nice
S0179	perfect
S0179	ease off my old chum
S0058	hmm mm
S0179	yeah didn't have to stop
S0058	you're in the peak of efficiency tonight
S0179	i'm try
S0058	ha ha
S0179	you see it's quite fun as an exercise
S0058	mm
S0179	what can you eek out
S0058	hmm mm sound wrong
S0179	mm so do your mum
S0058	nice
S0179	erm
S0058	ha ha ah dear joy
S0179	quiet in at the minute no students
S0058	yes indeed yeah i forget about that
S0179	what we should do on sunday oh sorry on friday night be go to a college bar
S0058	interest yeah
S0179	deluxe
S0058	actually yeah er we should talk about that tonight cos me and need to know what we're gonna do cos we sort of say we might stay in
S0179	i'm not work out tomorrow
S0058	no no no ha erm i mean just whether we're gonna go out in or not erm as in shall we stay in
S0179	er yeah i would
S0058	um oh yeah i mean if if we're go out in we'll stay in it's pointless come back unless there's a particular reason to we be think erm yeah sort of do something in the gym after work and then meet you afterwards
S0179	alright
S0058	um if that would be as the same as normal
S0179	yeah that sound great yeah
S0058	cool
S0179	so i'm ease off now
S0179	so a little bite more acceleration now there's fairly good visibility i'll stay in third i might i barely have to slow down specifically
S0058	nice
S0179	that be forward plan
S0058	ha ha that be incredible
S0179	yeah i haven't actually have to stop once since enter
S0058	no sweet
S0179	well i bet they're work
S0058	ha ha
S0179	the light
S0058	yes they be i know ha ha impressive
S0179	just ease off here just take second i need a bite more flexibility it's not that bad there
S0058	oh er in in there's a fair queue down there people sort of pull over to the pavement there
S0179	only two cars
S0058	two cars er yeah it's not as bad i mean i think you're right i think maybe be car heavy and people heavy for one petrol station
S0179	yeah exactly there's huge er tons of people come back from work finish dinner
S0058	yeah
S0179	i'll go and fill the car up
S0058	yeah
S0179	ironically sit up with your engine idle in that queue you'd probably be more cost effective to drive to
S0058	yeah
S0179	well maybe not by the time you've drive there but
S0058	well if you can think of any other reason to go near another petrol station ah a little john lewis van
S0179	it's quite a big lorry actually
S0058	no it look smaller than some of them though there's some huge ones
S0179	yeah articulate lorries
S0058	yes okay so a big lorry fine ha
S0179	okay
S0058	excellent so that's a plan for tomorrow night we'll need to have a chat about where we're gonna go do you just want to decide or
S0179	um no
S0179	frankly erm
S0058	she'll probably say she doesn't mind so
S0179	yeah none of you lot be very decisive
S0058	hmm mm
S0179	erm i think i be think although we have fish tonight
S0058	we have have fish tonight that's true erm
S0179	or we could
S0058	i be think might be a bite weird
S0179	yes
S0058	um i mean be a nice option
S0179	could work
S0058	yeah it could work
S0179	erm well see as
S0058	where else
S0179	presumably 's pay for herself or at least your parent be
S0058	mm yeah
S0179	then
S0058	i think i think i can get vouchers for
S0179	alimentum erm
S0058	hmm
S0179	erm if we go to we should book
S0058	yes
S0179	what about
S0058	i'm not particularly fuss on go to in some ways
S0179	iranian
S0058	well it be very nice
S0179	so loch fyne we should book
S0058	oh right yes yeah definitely definitely yeah erm well we can have a think about that as we sort of go along this even and
S0179	ease off ease off ease off
S0058	hmm hmm hmm oh
S0179	damn it
S0058	hmm hm oh first time we've have to stop
S0179	ah so close as well very creative i could have just keep edge forward then but i think de facto that be come to a stop
S0058	yeah
S0179	we know you're signal where else be you go to be go let's be honest
S0058	hmm mm ah back to work ha ha
S0179	the quick and easy way
S0058	yeah upsettingly quick actually the bus have be really good this week it's incredible as in sometimes i get to sidgewick site at about twenty past eight it's be ten past every week i'm sorry every day this week i don't know why it's just be so quiet it's great
S0179	right
S0058	mm yeah cos the bus go around to of course
S0179	which bus
S0058	the uni four the one that we get erm
S0179	have the uni four have anything to do with the university per se
S0058	erm i think it's call that because it go between erm kind of come down from sort of end and go to and there's a lot of students at
S0179	ah
S0058	i think it just mean you can yeah go round the colleges so it do kind of queen erm do you know what i mean it the
S0179	yep
S0058	and then through to which which i use to do for my supervisions to direct bus girls out on the town look at that
S0179	oh
S0058	that's really unattractive deary me
S0179	i've see actually it's not that bad i've see a lot worse
S0058	why be they it's like a uniform
S0058	ah
S0179	what specifically
S0058	the skirt be all exactly the same length
S0179	what if it be a uniform it's call fashion
S0058	ha fair enough good way of look at it
S0179	there's a very wide unnecessarily wide bike lane
S0058	yeah stupidly wide
S0179	it's almost a bus lane
S0058	yeah get a truck down there
S0179	okay so we just continue on along here until we get to er
S0058	i believe so
S0179	that's there
S0058	that's 's road sixth form erm be a little bite further on very very good sixth form that one
S0179	mm that's
S0058	um yes that's er no that's education oh no it be that's the education build this bite here be sort of main build
S0179	oh okay
S0058	on the right now hmm
S0179	be that still
S0058	that be yeah that's the plodge in there well that's reception i'm not sure whether they really have a plodge as such
S0179	it's a weird college
S0058	it be strange yeah
S0179	it's just strange that you can do subject here you can't do anywhere else cos i think that when i apply i be tell you can do every subject at every college
S0058	yeah well i think you can but education and drama be kind of solely base at and you would have to be supervise there
S0179	be they teach there
S0058	yeah well the the education do well i think drama you would be in the english faculty for some of it
S0058	but i think some of the solely drama lecture be probably
S0179	and this be a degree from the university of
S0058	yeah
S0179	shite
S0058	well no i mean like so education i think you have to do with a subject obviously and so do maths for half of her time and education for half of her time
S0179	right
S0058	er i don't know if you can do just solely education you might be able to
S0179	no i mean the education and drama
S0058	oh right well it's not the same degree as far as i know unless you could you possibly could come out with one but
S0179	what do you mean it's not the same degree
S0058	education and drama i mean you can do education comma drama
S0179	oh drama be not a degree be it can't get a degree in drama
S0058	you can do english and drama as a joint
S0179	yeah but you can't just do a degree in drama
S0058	i don't know i you think you well i'm not sure because there definitely be the i do i be supervise because i do shakespeare in performance and i be a supervise with drama students
S0179	now i'm focus on look for car park
S0058	oh right yeah sure
S0179	with drama students
S0058	yeah and so they hadn't do the er the first two years of english so i presume they must have be do drama erm hospital just say to the right yeah car park empty
S0179	so we need to figure out how to get into it
S0058	erm i assume you just go round into the hospital entrance and then there'll be a it look like you just go right up that driveway and then you could come in at the top of it
S0179	okey dokey
S0058	so that's bus and it's the yeah it's the next next leave
S0179	so
S0058	park hospital so we wanna go right
S0179	so my other leg's ache now
S0058	oh work harder
S0179	i be limp a lot today
S0058	mm
S0179	and then i forget to limp for a bite and it start hurt again
S0058	ah erm so yeah so presumably you can just park up here
S0179	right
S0058	erm
S0179	by that tree
S0058	so
S0179	here presumably
S0058	there's a barrier but i'll see what it say
S0179	i should think so
S0058	term and condition of park
S0179	er fuck ticket
S0058	ah right staff one
S0179	what i believe that we can get out here exit here that's not a lot of use so where do we go
S0058	okay so yeah be it
S0179	shall we go to the roundabout and have a look
S0058	there must be a patient car park it's not very
S0179	patient
S0058	try this way i suppose
S0179	well no let's go back a bite further that way we can can you keep look at sign
S0058	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah main hospital car park it say that way so it's right
S0179	which way
S0058	so right
S0179	erm i need to know from here where
S0058	so so the next leave
S0179	so back the way we've come from
S0058	back yeah yeah sorry yeah
S0179	that's what i mean right when i'm on a roundabout it doesn't mean nothing
S0058	sure so presumably it's just further round
S0179	main hospital
S0058	main hospital car park yeah
S0058	ah multi story wow
S0179	oh my god
S0058	ncp car park oh my goodness
S0179	shite on a pitchfork so where be it
S0058	so two lanes presumably this be the entrance here
S0179	one assume so yeah
S0058	oh my god ha ha it's only until seven charge thank goodness
S0179	oh so it's free
S0058	oh ah night rate any length of stay between seven pm to seven be three pound oh sorry mm
