S0083	it be chilly isn't it
S0084	mm
S0083	well i wake up early and i i do drop off again so
S0084	mm
S0083	but it be annoy to do that and i and i often do anyway anyway well there's nothing else to do
S0084	no the nice weather might come back next week
S0083	well hopefully basically you never tell can you with these with the english weather
S0084	no
S0083	anyway
S0084	well it do say it be go to rain on tuesday
S0083	yeah
S0084	so erm be any of the group you're in organise protest around the jubilee or the olympics or anything cos the unions have threaten to disrupt the olympics haven't they no or be it the guy who run the tube or something well they're they're threaten to have a tube
S0083	not that i'm aware of
S0084	i can't i think it be someone from who be a a union member but anyway he erm he be speak and i think it be when the tube drivers be threaten to strike and he be say he probably be just misquote or they'd use his quote to erm make him sound worse than he actually be
S0083	mm
S0084	but he be say you know the the way to get people's attention would be to strike or to protest during the olympics and everyone be up in arm oh my god can't allow this but since then i be read on the guardian i think the other day that erm other protest group be say that they would use the olympics as like a focal point
S0083	well clearly the authorities be really worry about a terrorist attack
S0084	yeah oh do i tell you have get a job in counterterrorism
S0083	oh my god
S0084	well i haven't get the full full er full description but she's move so it's all in the foreign office
S0083	mhm
S0084	work in the counterterrorism department erm mainly cover the olympics so it would be really interest to find out how that's go to work cattle prod
S0083	oh dear anyway as know there's a very simply solution
S0084	mhm
S0084	i'm so bore with the olympics
S0083	well there there be that but we just need to get out of the middle east
S0084	oh i see what you mean yeah well that's not go to happen once they invade iran
S0083	oh dear
S0084	must have get the bus
S0083	yeah she often do
S0084	do she
S0083	mm
S0083	i think she's so tire by the end of the day
S0084	mm
S0083	cycle home be a real strain
S0084	mm
S0083	and obviously you know she's she's not really a morning person erm
S0084	no
S0083	but she's she come home absolutely exhaust
S0084	mm
S0083	cos she's just she's just stand all day you know
S0084	mm
S0083	run up and down stairs all day well you remember what it be like
S0084	i've do it
S0083	yeah
S0084	and it be exhaust
S0083	it be very very tire yeah
S0084	well i be think about this yesterday i can't remember whether i be i would come home and pass out for the entire even i don't think i do i be tire i don't think i be as bad as her and i wonder if that's an iron deficiency you know it's natural that you're go to be physically tire but
S0083	to be as tire as she get yeah
S0084	at her age
S0083	mm yeah mm mm
S0084	i suppose though if this be her friends be still here and have her social life and so she would go out so it would make her carry on
S0083	she didn't go out that much though
S0084	no but she hasn't really have the opportunity to do it here i think if her life be here you know she'd make friends here more than she have
S0083	oh absolutely
S0084	she would just go out
S0083	mm she would go out more than she do that's true i mean the only thing be that she's manage to save a lot of money by do this and
S0084	mhm absolutely
S0083	she always do need a lot of sleep though didn't she
S0084	yeah
S0083	i mean as a kid you do but even up to her teenage years when she be at school and college and whatever she still need about ten hours sleep a night
S0084	mm
S0083	and people use to joke about it
S0084	yeah but as we've say before she's not very good at put on a front for people be she if you're you know if everybody else be tire you just muddle on through and i i feel like i spend my whole life tire i don't catch up with sleep at the weekend i'm absolutely exhaust it get to sunday and i'm still
S0083	mm mm well you should you should try
S0084	i do try
S0083	mm
S0084	i feel like i have a
S0083	be the house very noisy at the weekend then
S0084	no i just wake up and i can't go back to sleep and then you know they do but they do get up early you know even so when i'm awake they don't wake me up necessarily but i'm i wake up early and i'm stir so
S0083	you're aware of them yeah
S0084	's up put her wash on at half eight and and root about and
S0083	mm
S0084	every other weekend she and will work on a saturday
S0083	oh right
S0084	so it's not ideal but it do do feel good
S0083	i suppose you're at the front you hear the door go don't you
S0084	yeah and the bike from the bike rack from outside my window
S0083	mm
S0084	and all the noisy neighbour
S0083	oh dear
S0084	i think there's like erm a train like a boot camp or something cos often at sort of half five six in the morning just before i'm get up for work during the week a group of lads will run past shout at each other happen every week
S0083	mm
S0084	it's really annoy
S0083	oh lovely
S0084	mm so i just feel tire a lot of the time and most people do i think like i'm look forward to next week so next wednesday i think and i will go to and leave at a reasonable time
S0083	mhm
S0084	and then thursday i think doesn't get in until the afternoon
S0083	right
S0084	she's get the day off but she's get a few things to do so
S0083	mhm
S0084	she won't get here until about three or four o'clock in the afternoon so that's really nice i can have a lazy day
S0083	mm
S0084	and i think she'll probably just stay till friday because she's get family stuff on
S0083	yeah yeah i can imagine
S0084	and then i've get saturday sunday monday just to catch up with sleep and potter about
S0083	yeah and come over here one day
S0084	mm
S0083	erm so you aren't able to get back to sleep after that cos what i do find be i mean if it's quiet and if i'm tire and i've take nytol i can sometimes sleep in and even if i don't i'm still sleepy enough that i can go back to sleep
S0084	right
S0083	cos i never use to be able to do that
S0084	no i can't do that
S0083	but it obviously didn't help you to do that
S0084	no i just lay there for about forty minutes
S0083	maybe take two then
S0084	yeah
S0083	i mean i think it's fine to take two i just think as you weren't use to them
S0084	mm
S0083	to start with one
S0084	ease yourself in yeah
S0083	you take two and just buy a packet and have it actually look be careful cos there be two strengths erm buy a packet and take take them at weekend see if that help you sleep in at the weekend
S0084	mm mm
S0083	well it be your body clock cos that's what dad be like and that's why he be always up early at weekend he could never sleep in
S0084	mm mm
S0083	and he be always tire and complain and i just think for god's sake just sleep well he he never give himself a i mean i don't know whether he would have be able to but he never give himself a chance so once he be awake he be out of bed
S0084	yeah i mean that's it i think
S0083	he would never lie there read or try and go back to sleep he would just get up
S0084	i mean i do lay in bed and i i think that's you know at least you can do that at least it's restful
S0083	yeah absolutely
S0084	but i suppose if you know i use to remember get up early and watch cartoon and stuff and he'd come down but i suppose because we be up even if we be be quiet
S0083	he be awake anyway
S0084	yeah i know well it's not that we wake him up but i suppose he think well if the kid be up i might as well get up there's no point laze around
S0083	he want a well when you be very young it be to keep an eye on you yeah
S0084	yeah but if you think that sometimes i do think well you're waste the day if you just lay around the bed when you're awake i mean it's nice to read or it's nice to watch a movie or read the paper or whatever but er i do think well i might as well get up
S0083	mm
S0084	have you know make the most of of the day
S0083	mm
S0084	whereas could sleep i've never know anyone like it she'll come home and she'll sleep in the even then she'll sleep all night she'll sleep in at the weekend you know she might sleep in at one in the afternoon it's unbelievable i mean she do go to the doctor to see if it be a thyroid thing because she be always always sleep and she be have trouble shift her weight like possibly from the thyroid
S0083	mm how's her leg
S0084	the same all of the bruising's go now but it's just this lump
S0083	mm
S0084	it's really big if she do say she be go to start train on it cos that's what the nurse say to do
S0083	mm
S0084	cos they weren't go to drain it so either way just you know if it burst then they'll have to do something about it and if it doesn't then at least it's still drain so
S0083	hello it's very cute when you see cat wash their face like that it's very cute
S0084	he's sleepy
S0083	that be a feed up sigh
S0084	mm i've get toothache as well my wisdom teeth be come through
S0083	oh
S0084	well it's this one at the moment this be the one that i know be come through and when i go to him one of it be for before christmas he say yeah it's come through
S0083	mm mm mm
S0084	and i've get to get my
S0083	and it's all okay
S0084	my six month come up what do you mean what come through okay i don't know it wasn't hurt before i could just feel it whereas it's hurt now
S0083	be there room for it
S0084	well i don't know i think i'm go to go and speak to my orthodontist i've get my six month follow up in april
S0083	mhm
S0084	erm he might say take them out cos that be the question whether we extract them to make room for my teeth and then that would correct the over bite and i say no let's not bother at least they're straight if they're come through we might have to because it sort of force the teeth out of alignment which be a bite horrendous i mean when people have actual operations you get sick leave from work i don't know whether to have your teeth extract it would be the you'd be able to do the the same thing they're pretty understand
S0083	i would imagine cos wisdom teeth be be quite a big thing
S0084	be pretty serious and if they're go to do all of them i mean i don't they're come through on the on both the back and i don't know but i can't feel the top
S0083	mm
S0084	i can feel i well i think i can feel them but i'm not sure if he say well i'll just whip them out that's go to be quite intense it's go to require a couple of days off work i think cos well people have from what people have say it's extremely painful so
S0083	it be it's very painful it be i remember
S0084	do you have all four out
S0083	no three
S0084	three what age be you
S0083	it be after i'd have one of you i think it be probably after i'd have richard cos it be a long time ago erm they which i think mean they'd they'd break up
S0084	oh right
S0083	and they just i actually have erm i have anaesthetic cos it be really bad
S0084	i think that's what it what you mean general oh right
S0083	yeah
S0084	mm
S0083	and i be terrify at at have them out cos it be it they're huge things and it it be unbelievably painful
S0084	really

S0083	yeah
S0084	yeah it be painful
S0083	go and see
S0084	mm well i'll see if i can't put up with the pain then i will but erm for the time be so i'm go to go to the orthodontist anyway
S0083	well no you say you've get your when be it
S0084	mm in mid april i think
S0083	well that's not too far away
S0084	no
S0083	come on then come on
S0083	i know you want to come up here come on hello hello he like to sit with me if he can find a space cos he won't sit on lap don't know if he ever will he like to sit next to you and sort of along side you and he actually squeeze himself into some very tight space now or he sit on the arm like that he make me laugh because she often sit here and i sit there and he's on the edge or i'd sit here and she's lie where you be
S0084	mm
S0083	and he sit on the edge with his feet down the hole
S0083	it's not the most comfortable place
S0084	animals do surprise you where they can sleep though i mean use to sleep in with the coffee table didn't she
S0083	oh yeah no
S0084	no cos it be
S0083	well we have both of them at
S0084	no we didn't we didn't have do we
S0083	yeah absolutely of course we do
S0084	oh yeah we do actually erm no it be it be that i remember do it anyway
S0083	mm they do like pillow though it's really peculiar because he do
S0084	he like the pink cushion doesn't he
S0083	he like the he like the cushion and if he's on my bed if he can if he can do it he like to lie near the pillow it's it's just have the head just that little bite up the same as we do
S0084	mm
S0083	we don't like lie completely flat do we
S0084	no
S0083	aw you're very cute yeah i do like have him you be a good choice yes you be
S0084	yeah he be a good choice
S0083	very good nature
S0084	and he doesn't sit on your lap
S0083	oh yeah
S0084	which be nice
S0083	it's good for you isn't it
S0084	it's good for me i can tolerate him
S0083	i like it he he like to lie on his back along my leg like that
S0084	mm
S0083	and just that' that's as close as he's comfortable with and he do like to do it cos he never use to so i feel he's really attach himself now
S0084	mm well
S0083	although he's settle age ago i mean it's that kind of attachment to family to the person who own you
S0084	to a degree i mean cat don't really have that the same as dog do they they don't have that unconditional love for their family the way that dog do and that's what's dangerous about people who abuse pet
S0083	mm mm
S0084	because you could abuse a dog to such a degree because it will always love you
S0083	absolutely
S0084	cos it's not in its nature to understand that
S0083	no
S0084	but a cat will leave you if it find a better deal
S0083	mm
S0084	but yeah i think he he seem very settle
S0083	oscar won't will you he do he like it here it suit him
S0084	i'm sure that's what think about diesel though to be fair
S0083	mm
S0084	he keep run away and enough
S0083	he's fine
S0084	doesn't he try and jump through that erm fan window
S0083	no it's too high
S0084	but he can get out of the bedroom ones can't he and the kitchen one
S0083	yeah it's because there's a ledge
S0084	yeah it's not quite as big a distance
S0083	yeah
S0084	i mean from the from the chair he hasn't try it
S0083	erm we haven't open it because when it's be nice we've have the door open
S0084	mm mm
S0083	so we haven't just have that as it be today cos as soon as it be nice you know the door be open
S0084	yeah
S0083	yeah we'll put it back in my room today i need to sort out my room a little bite oh dear
S0084	that forget me not's everywhere isn't it
S0083	yeah yeah they do spread
S0084	i mean the flower be nice
S0083	i mean i don't i don't mind some but there be too many i mean they they be just go crazy
S0084	it flower early in the year then
S0083	yeah
S0084	cos it's that
S0083	oh no you mean these
S0084	the little blue ones at the bottom aren't they forget me not oh but they're violets
S0083	these well they're roses they're violets
S0084	yeah but they're by the buddleia as well
S0083	they be they do spread and they're all down the side here as well
S0084	mm
S0083	erm but that's fine cos they're only little that's fine erm now the forget me nots be the ones that be on that side
S0084	oh yeah
S0083	and that will take over
S0083	i wish i have some money i would put a fence all the way down here
S0084	i know
S0083	i'm go to have to do it but i can only do it bite by bite i'm go to get
S0084	how expensive be it to buy the panel
S0083	well individually it doesn't seem like much it's just you need so many of them and the post and the concrete and the spike to me them in and
S0084	and how much be they on average yeah well what be you talk really for that whole side about a hundred quid
S0083	oh god no about three or four
S0084	jesus
S0083	yeah that's that's quite a long distance that well it must be i don't know it must be sixty feet or something maybe more i don't know
S0084	so if you get the plan out for the house find out
S0083	well i mean it we could just measure it
S0084	measure it
S0083	pace it out or something but it's yeah
S0084	blimey
S0083	i'm definitely go to do the bite by the house because i want some privacy from next door
S0084	mm mm it's so it's really when i we first move in i quite like the wilderness on that side but it's actually just really i don't know just not nice be it it's not pretty it's just ugly ugly
S0083	it's not it be ugly
S0084	ugly plant they're just weed essentially aren't they
S0083	a lot absolutely
S0084	ivy holly holly's pretty but
S0083	well holly be nice but it it the guy who come and trim it last summer say oh i'll leave the holly cos it's cos it's nice
S0084	mm
S0083	fine yeah it be nice everyone like holly but it grow enormously high
S0084	mm yeah
S0083	if it's just leave a holly tree will grow i don't know sixty feet or more
S0084	mm
S0083	i mean it be it's very it'll grow into a very big tree
S0084	yeah
S0083	that's why you have to be careful with it and it's seed itself as well there's there be there's more than one
S0084	mm
S0083	and there's a small one grow erm a few feet along
S0084	i wonder if it's worth speak to the tenant next door just say can you have a word with the landlady to see if it's okay if we chop back the some wilderness cos it doesn't seem like the landlady give a toss
S0083	erm they pay erm to have this guy do it last year to to to to cut it so that the level wasn't block my light because that be an issue between neighbour
S0084	mm
S0083	block of light be something that's kind of i mean these things be not enshrine in law but it's but it's not you're not suppose to do that i mean i don't know how you do get these protract law case of neighbour you know things like erm i mean the thing that really get people be this erm be the you know the kind of because they grow so big
S0084	mm
S0083	you're not suppose to block each other's light that's that's quite a major thing so the privacy not so important light obviously be
S0084	mm
S0083	erm so i think they be tell you know you're go to have to do this so they do but erm there's not the same kind of which you'd think there would be
S0084	yeah
S0083	of emphasis on on privacy
S0084	well give that everybody live on each other's doorsteps now you'd think this would be write into the you know law
S0083	i know because they cos they don't live actually live there they just don't care
S0084	no and that's the problem you find that more and more because obviously lot of people have second and third home
S0083	everywhere be rent out but why would you why would you rent somewhere with a you know it's very annoy
S0084	mm
S0083	if you've if you've if you're rent somewhere and it's get a garden you're suppose to keep it tidy which basically mean you cut the grass you don't do anything else but you're go to invest all your weekend in weed and prune and things be you no
S0084	no no well i we certainly don't but then think about it have i speak to when i when i be look at move in i say who look after the garden and she say oh i look after it i mean no one look after that garden it's completely ridiculous we've get a bedstead half way down as the fence
S0083	mm no mm well exactly
S0084	but really there's nothing like that there's nothing ugly grow through
S0083	no
S0084	they've get a couple of little not dissimilar to whatever that be i think it's honeysuckle come over the fence
S0083	yeah exactly
S0084	there's that there's and blackberry bush because i be pick pick blackberry when i first move in in august september
S0083	yeah
S0084	erm and that's about it really but actually we've get those what's that green like a rubber plant it's a rubber plant and they grow into tree don't they you know those rubber plant leave
S0083	mm
S0084	yeah we've get them all down that side by the conservatory on your right
S0083	oh i'm i know the kind of thing that people do use it as a kind of hedge yeah
S0084	as a shield yeah and that's get a fence behind it
S0083	right
S0084	but that's probably because that's 's side
S0083	yeah
S0084	so that 's put that fence in and plant those tree
S0083	yeah
S0084	erm and it's the landlord next door who he rent it out to students who's who's get that chain link fence which would have be donkeys years old
S0083	yeah yeah it's the same as that yeah
S0084	and the bedstead
S0083	yeah
S0084	whether the landlord put the bedstead in or whether some tenant think it would be really funny to put it in i don't know but even though either one would surprise me
S0084	give that the landlord have leave a a use toilet in their front garden for six months
S0083	excellent urgh
S0084	er but the but the tenant don't care
S0083	no
S0084	if i live there i'd be horrify
S0083	well i know but students don't care i mean a lot of people if they're rent they they don't really care about the property
S0084	it must be it must be absolutely disgust inside
S0083	mm
S0084	i mean our house be fall down but at least we keep it clean on the inside
S0083	yeah
S0084	i mean the bathroom need gutting they've use the wrong kind of paint on the ceiling and it's all flake
S0083	mm
S0084	they've obviously use like a non water resistant one
S0083	yeah
S0084	erm and it's i mean the cleaner that come once a week i don't know what she do i think she put a bite of bleach in the toilet i don't think she properly clean it hoover and wipe the side down
S0083	mm
S0084	don't think she have anything oh she wipe the tap she wipe the sink sink down
S0083	mm
S0084	she hasn't clean the bath she hasn't hoover anything on the
S0083	really
S0084	she's she's suppose to hoover around the land and the stairs and the hall
S0083	mm
S0084	and she's suppose to mop the floor she doesn't every time sometimes she do
S0083	mm
S0084	it's really bad but i mean we're all quite good about wash out the bath because most of us have bath at one point like always have a bath erm probably have a bath a couple of time a week and occasionally
S0083	mm mm
S0084	everyone's pretty good generally
S0083	yeah well that's what so long as you all do it's it's when there's one that doesn't
S0084	oh yeah well leave her hair all over the bathroom which be a bite grim she's the new spanish girl
S0083	mm
S0084	which i think everyone's get a bite annoy with and she's so so heavy foot i've never know anyone like it you know wear steel toe cap boot for work because he's a labourer and he doesn't make that much noise
S0083	mm
S0084	be you go to paint the fence all one colour your fence
S0083	what i'm not particularly bother i mean
S0084	it's not an issue

S0083	well less than one there's there's some leave over there's quite a bite leftover
S0084	mm
S0084	mm you can definitely see the red come through
S0083	yeah it's it's so it's just so strong that stuff
S0084	mm
S0083	and you can't you can't paint it a lighter colour
S0084	mm
S0083	it's it's fine don't worry you just have to ignore it
S0084	i think i need some drug
S0083	what kind
S0084	brain
S0083	you're just tire
S0084	and my tooth be hurt a lot now
S0083	well i can help with that oh i don't feel like do very much
S0084	how be your legs today
S0083	oh they're fine i be just tire last night
S0084	how's your tummy
S0083	it's okay
S0083	yes
S0084	be you alright
S0083	i'm alright
S0084	have you be listen to the new erm any more glen gould
S0083	no i haven't
S0084	i like the collection he's get though
S0083	it be it's good oh you can put some on and listen to it
S0084	mm
S0084	my boss at work not but the operations manager she's get chicken pox i know bless her she's forty i mean she we go out for her fortieth a couple of weeks ago she's get a little boy who's two
S0083	and he's get it
S0084	no we don't think so but he's probably go to get it as it's a good time but we don't know where she's get it from on her feller's a chef and he's just start a new job at one of the colleges it's really great and he be work for 's before
S0083	mm
S0084	and he be work seventy hour weeks you know that when you're a chef they make you sign your soul away
S0083	mm
S0084	you have to sign a disclaimer to say i'll work whatever hours you need me to and he be work seventy hour weeks
S0083	seventy hours
S0084	he would leave at eight be and come home at one be
S0083	that's ridiculous
S0084	he would leave on a wednesday and would say to him okay i'll see you on sunday because she would be work office hours and look after samuel
S0083	yeah
S0084	and he would just either he would come back but in the afternoon and would be at work or he just wouldn't come back
S0083	mm mm
S0084	but he's just start work at the colleges so it's monday to friday
S0083	mm
S0084	seven till two it's great and over over time if he need at the weekend
S0083	mm
S0084	it's so good and so bank holiday he's go to have off easter holiday go to have off
S0083	yeah
S0084	it's really really good but erm they don't know where she's get this from cos apparently she's never have chicken pox before so at least it's not shingle cos i hear shingle be much worse when you're an adult
S0083	it it be it be and it's the same virus
S0084	it's the same virus yeah but it's just sort of a stronger strength isn't it or something when you're an adult so she must not have have it when she be a kid so at least samuel will have it now when he's young
S0083	mm yeah absolutely i mean that's but you assume that if if you haven't have it that that when you have kid and your kid catch it then you will get it from them
S0084	yeah
S0083	so that's weird
S0084	so it's very weird so at least he just
S0083	very odd the way that's happen
S0084	he it could be he do go to crèche a couple of days or one day a week maybe
S0083	or she's perhaps she's she's pick it up from one of the children then
S0084	exactly yeah
S0083	yeah mm
S0084	so bless her so she's go to be so she's pretty contagious right now so she
S0083	mm
S0084	she work from home thursdays and fridays anyway but she'll be off this week and off for next week so i my boss next week will be sam the director
S0083	mm
S0084	cos obviously 's in in the state it doesn't really count she's like if you've get any problems just call me there's not really anything you could do from over there though but it's fine i never really have a have an issue
S0083	good that's great that you're
S0084	no well i mean i i make a massive ball up the other day at work it be really annoy i'd proof a supplier to to send in a cover and i'd give the wrong instructions it's just really annoy erm but not that surprise when you think about how much work we have on
S0083	mm
S0084	everything be rush rush rush
S0083	mm
S0084	you don't really have time to sit and think you just have to push on through
S0083	mm
S0084	because i've get ten project now that i'm look after
S0083	wow
S0084	yeah erm there's and each one of them will have a different editor erm a different designer work on it
S0083	mm
S0084	they're all a different well they're all at similar stag
S0083	mm
S0084	they're all because of the nature of the beast we have to publish everything on the exams list
S0083	mm
S0084	which be the list that i look after in january because that's when the school buy the book
S0083	mm mm
S0084	so that mean all of the course have to come out together you can't stagger everything so you can't have one with you and then have another one and then have another one they've all get to come out
S0083	right okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0084	and at the moment they're capitalise on a on a segment of the market that no one else publish for
S0083	mm
S0084	which be call the for school market so it's you might have an adult version of this exam level because this be the kid version so they've go absolutely mental
S0083	mm
S0084	basically just capitalise on the fact that they've get you know market ownership there
S0083	mm
S0084	so everything be the for school version of everything now and what esol do be they update the exams so we might be work on an on a on a project right now for a certain exam level
S0083	mm
S0084	but next year they're go to revise it and it's go to be release in twenty fifteen so we might publish a book when everything be be publish for january twenty thirteen
S0083	mm mm
S0084	but we're go to have to revise it almost immediately because the next version the second edition have get to come out in january fifteen
S0083	mm
S0084	which mean the author have to be in the production process itself take nine months
S0083	mm
S0084	so we're work backwards from january fifteen they'll have to hand it over in january fourteen which mean the author need to be work in two thousand and thirteen so that as soon as we're publish the author be start work on the second edition
S0083	mm mm mm
S0084	completely ridiculous
S0083	mm
S0084	it just make you feel like well you know you're never actually go to rest you're just constantly work on the same stuff
S0083	mm
S0084	you're sort of flood the market with with its own competition
S0083	well you be why be it necessary to have a second edition so soon
S0084	because the exam be be revise so what we're publish in twenty thirteen will will not be current
S0083	will that have to be okay
S0084	but we don't know because esol be just like yeah we're go to revise it but we're not go to tell you how much so we don't know whether it's if it's twenty percent new material that's fine well at least we've get the bare bone of what's go in
S0083	oh god yeah
S0084	well more than the bare bone we'll only change twenty percent but they might change eighty percent which mean we have to get author to rewrite all of that material new exercise new examples
S0083	for god's sake why would you need to constantly revise exam
S0084	er it's almost like they're just create work for themselves for the sake of it
S0083	no you wonder yeah
S0084	you know if it's be perfectly good up till this point why do they need to keep revise it i don't know you know that's not i'm not in charge of the content i'm in charge of get it out on time
S0083	no
S0084	so
S0083	i suppose it erm
S0083	i suppose erm er what be i try to say
S0084	well if you think about publish a book we would bring out new editions because the material look date so current pop star that we might include with current illustrations and the book date that's that's they're
S0083	yeah oh yeah yeah but that's that's only that's only minor though isn't it
S0084	well yeah it's pretty it depend how long ago the last edition be publish
S0083	yeah yeah
S0084	if you've get something that's not a massive seller your last edition might have be for seven years ago for example something that i'm work on now business title it's a business exams title
S0083	mm mm
S0084	it be last publish in twenty two thousand and four erm which mean it wasn't even design in the current design programme
S0083	mm no
S0084	it be in quark rather than indesign
S0083	oh right
S0084	so you've get to get all the old file from convert them send them off to the type setter so that they can work from that
S0083	mm mm
S0084	but basically we're change eighty percent of the content
S0083	mm
S0084	so it's it's it's massive
S0083	it be isn't it
S0084	and then you've get things like for that you've get two business exams and they publish a student's book for each in this project
S0083	mm
S0084	so you've get one for business english it's call and then one for business i can't remember what the other one be anyway
S0083	mm
S0084	we've get two exams so you've get two student's book per level you've get erm a study book for the students and you've get a teacher's for the teachers
S0083	mm
S0084	you've also get accompany audio for the student's book so for this new edition we're use some of the old edition material some of and then record new material
S0083	mm
S0084	but there's also also authentic record so like this basically you and me just chat or interview that's get to be splice into the audio record
S0083	mm
S0084	it's it's that that make your job quite interest because because that's what i have to do i have to make sure that all of those piece be there
S0083	that be a lot of work though isn't it yeah oh yeah yeah yeah
S0084	er and with the right people at the right time and everything be in place
S0083	mm well that's good
S0084	massive headache but yeah
S0083	but you're enjoy it
S0084	yeah because it's it's it's really challenge and no two days be the same really so
S0083	well that's what you want yeah
S0084	that be what you want
S0083	than be do the same thing over and over
S0084	yeah definitely i mean everyday i look at lucy who's do my old job and er i'm very grateful that i'm not do that job any more
S0083	yeah good
S0084	i mean i i think she say she's enjoy it i don't know whether she'd tell me the truth really because we don't really know each other that well
S0083	mm
S0084	we all work in
S0083	have she settle in quite well have she
S0084	she have and she and get on well so that's good
S0083	yeah
S0084	erm and she already work in the department before so you know we've meet for a coffee when she be say she be go to apply for the job but i say that she'd be great cos i know she'd be good at that she's very organise
S0083	mm mhm mm
S0084	erm but it's one of those job that you probably won't ever get a good idea of it until you start
S0083	mm
S0084	whereas i think with production i know what i be let myself in for
S0083	yeah
S0084	erm
S0083	well it be a good first step wasn't it
S0084	it be a good first step
S0083	it all work out really well
S0084	it be a good entry level job definitely
S0083	yeah
S0084	and send me a nice email from the state say you know thank for all your hard work you're do a great job
S0083	fantastic
S0084	yeah well i write back and say that's you know that's really sweet and you know i'm really touch but i erm i just hope i don't let anybody down and she write back and say you know no thank you i know it's only word and it's not go to buy your holiday but you know
S0083	mm mm
S0084	you never know it's just the end of this financial year go into the next i know there's no budget for any new members of staff and so we don't know
S0083	mm mm
S0084	you know it's all very well you you work at the top of your level when there's no money to progress
S0083	i know
S0084	and you know that the people in your department would like to promote you but there's just no money so
S0083	mm
S0084	i don't know i don't what's go to happen i really don't you just carry on do what you do i suppose
S0083	mm yeah pretty much
S0084	i think 's find it harder than she think she would in the state
S0083	mm
S0084	well she say she know she know it be go to be hard because obviously her her husband's here
S0083	mm
S0084	she say they skype everyday but and she's get a miniature schnauzer her dog which she love and they skype and otto get in on them in on the action they don't have kid she say
S0083	no but the couple without kid often have dog like that yeah
S0084	yeah they never want kid actually which be quite fortunate they be on the same page about that
S0083	mm mm
S0084	just not or they never they never want to be
S0083	i suppose when she's back you'll feel less pressure won't you
S0084	erm well yeah cos i'm i'm do two of her project
S0083	mm
S0084	and even though she's suppose to
S0083	and when be she back
S0084	june so she be back in the office after the jubilee weekend but i've get that week off
S0083	blimey you've get a long stretch of be on your own then i didn't realise it be that long
S0084	i've get all of april and all of may
S0083	gosh
S0084	it's three months just shy of three months because she go at the begin of march so erm
S0083	yeah yeah
S0084	that's i mean that's how much maternity leave they get a couple of months that's it
S0083	mm
S0084	so it be quite a long stretch cos it's it's be three weeks i've get another two months of it
S0083	mm
S0084	erm it's fine i mean there be other senior so 's level of that you can ask question but everyone's busy and you don't really want to
S0083	mm
S0084	i mean that's the thing you're suppose suppose to be be train by somebody else that's that's why they're get the money
S0083	mm
S0084	they're not here and you know obviously she's only an email away and we speak every week on the phone but it's not the same
S0083	well whenever you do have a problem go to somebody because don't it all their busy
S0084	yeah
S0083	i mean you know they be you know they have the position that they do erm
S0084	yeah and actually they be most of them be at that position because they're a line manager that's how you progress so
S0083	i think i think don't don't worry about go to them and think they're busy i would definitely go to them don't struggle along if this you know if they can help you
S0084	no no i'm i'm generally fine i mean it i've be do it for three months now so
S0083	mm
S0084	no four months
S0083	yeah yeah it must be
S0084	cos i start in november
S0083	yeah
S0084	so day to day you know i'm i'm get a handle on things
S0083	mm
S0084	and the good thing be because we have so many new systems all learn all the time so that be the hardest thing about start in november be because it that be basically when we be start a new system so they be try to show me the old way but show me the new way and it be all very confuse so erm i think that's put me in quite a fortunate position because i've just run with the new system because there's no point learn the old one
S0083	mm mm mm mm
S0084	whereas i think the others have have a lot longer to be work the old system and they're find it a bite difficult to move across so
S0083	mm
S0084	for example yesterday i spend time with one of the seniors show them how to use the new schedule system
S0083	mm
S0084	and that be quite nice because it be quite nice to be able to help rather than be the one that's help
S0083	mm
S0084	so it's alright it's quite nice
S0083	mm
S0084	and it be a good team no i don't think anyone resent ask question there's no attitude at all there so
S0083	good well there shouldn't be i mean you really have be throw in at the deep end i think in this
S0084	it's sink or swim definitely i mean that's what they say when i go for my interview i mean well be say when my colleague that start as the trainee two years ago when i start my job with he'd start a month before and she say you know he be quite fortunate at the time because there be fewer project in the department go through production and he have smaller project and he could take his time and she say you don't have that luxury you know
S0083	mm mm mm mm
S0084	you go to have a lot of work it's a very busy list and it's all project to individual title and things you're go to have it's go to be multi component multi level
S0083	mm
S0084	and it's all go to have to come out at the same time well i suppose you know i quite enjoy that
S0083	well i think you do thrive on that
S0084	yeah i don't want to be
S0083	well you certainly seem to you you know you
S0084	i don't want to be bore i'm more engage with my job now that i'm
S0083	it's a it's a really pleasant surprise to see you do this to see you busy and love it and challenge but thrive on it it's it's great to see you like this
S0084	yeah i mean who would have think it but it definitely bring out the best in people
S0083	the time that i first saw it be when you be do when you be in
S0084	do my ma yeah yeah that be a good year
S0083	you so love do it and get on with it so even even the hassle about be there be be nothing i mean you you absolutely love it and the busier you be the more deadlines you have the more you love it and i think i don't believe it this be i bet she
S0084	yeah yeah mm i know it's the one who just want to get into bed
S0083	yeah
S0084	yeah
S0083	well i think it be then that i realise that this be this be what you
S0084	i think that be a turn point
S0083	you know give the right give the right subject or or world that you be in you know you absolutely thrive on it and you be
S0084	yeah mm i think that be it you know it take me a few years to get there but be it's all quite crucial time you know it's you need that time when you're finish to just take stock and think what it be that you want to do it do take a while
S0083	mm mm
S0084	well certainly once i'd latch onto it or when i start the course it really felt like yeah this be it this be this be what i want to do so
S0083	mm i mean it it wasn't just i mean that that be clear that be very clear and i be very glad that you'd find that
S0084	and it's probably felt like that ever since
S0083	but as you say i mean this be somebody who
S0084	i didn't really like academic work
S0083	when when you when you have a project from school even if it be something that you enjoy it be like oh it's too hard oh it's too much work oh no i oh it's just too much
S0084	yeah complete opposite to in that regard well i think that be that be why i think it have take me that long till my mid twenties to think actually i want to go to university i want to study
S0083	yeah
S0084	and i think that's the thing when i be eighteen it be sort of well you've get you go that's what you're suppose to do
S0083	mm
S0084	as oppose to a necessarily a real choice to go you know i want to go but i don't think study be the the drive for me then at all
S0083	no no it absolutely wasn't
S0084	and er that be apparent i think when i go to do my ma that be the drive that be right okay well this be my chance to prove to myself and and maybe to other people that i can do it i have get a brain i can study and i can apply myself and i felt like i'd be give that opportunity and not to waste it really
S0083	yeah mm mm mm mm well you and that be the other thing it be all your choice
S0084	yeah i think that be the difference it be my course it be my university i'd research it i want to do it
S0083	yeah yeah absolutely
S0084	erm whereas i think i just you know with u e a i think say this be like a good uni oh yeah okay fine mum well this be like a good course yeah fine okay
S0083	mm
S0084	and i hadn't really engage with any of it other than well erm i should go to uni it sound good
S0083	well no i mean you you you say you want to do film
S0084	yeah but do you remember i start do cultural study
S0083	yeah
S0084	and i think that be your drive that be your
S0083	because because no it it i the reason i suggest that be because it be a broad canvas because there be there be no one field that you want to do
S0084	yeah yeah yeah yeah absolutely
S0083	and it seem like well if it if it's if it's a sort of if it's a different bite every week or every other week that would suit you more
S0084	mm yeah absolutely yeah it seem like a good idea and i think that's what you know i didn't challenge it because i think well that make sense because there wasn't anything that i want to do so what i probably should have do be wait and then go when i be twenty five
S0083	mm mm mm mm the thing be i know i i have this feel and i still think it that have you work for a year or travel or you know
S0084	i wouldn't go
S0083	have you work save travel that at the end of it you wouldn't have go to uni
S0084	mm yeah and if that be the case then that would have you know well my life would have just go in a different direction
S0083	and i be i be i be worry that that would happen to you yeah and you would have do and you wouldn't be where you be so
S0084	yeah but i mean if you think that i be twenty five when i start my ma and i think and it have take me that long to get there and choose to do that i would have be behind because i would have be do my undergraduate then as oppose to my ma so i'd only be now only now would i be finish my ma
S0083	mm mm mm mm oh yeah you would have be way behind yeah yeah yeah
S0084	that yeah yeah i finish my ma three years ago didn't i so yeah
S0083	yeah you might have yeah
S0084	i would be finish my ma now
S0083	mm
S0084	so erm so yeah i'd be well behind and i because that's part of what you feel you know you're thirty and you're a trainee you think you know this isn't quite how what my life be plan
S0083	i know but you've do all of the stuff that you have
S0084	yeah well you know i have travel i have get two degrees i have i be in a job that i enjoy and i'm in an area a field that i enjoy so
S0083	yeah and you've be there for two years and you've you've you've settle and well think of there
S0084	yeah i think so i hope so
S0083	well you obviously be
S0084	mm
S0083	mm you be
S0084	so it's funny it's funny yeah i mean i do i definitely do prefer to busy at work
S0083	you you do you do and it and and this be the thing it's like i don't recognise this confident mature capable young woman with with with the teenager who use to erm i don't know
S0084	i'm very different to how i be when i be a teen i mean i still see traits of myself obviously you know i be still quite shy and
S0083	yeah
S0084	i still do have a confidence issue to a degree but at the same time i'm much more self assure obviously which be what's suppose to happen
S0083	you be
S0084	you be suppose to be more self assure when you're older but
S0083	i know but it doesn't always happen
S0084	it doesn't necessarily happen
S0083	no it doesn't
S0084	and everyone have you know issue about themselves
S0083	and you're very clear about what you want whereas when you be a teenager you you didn't know erm and you just like do the things that you like do
S0084	mm mm
S0083	and you didn't put yourself out at all
S0084	no no
S0083	whereas now you do
S0084	well i suppose you know it's it's meet people it's do things that test who you be as a person and
S0083	yeah
S0084	if you i suppose in every situation
S0083	you have push yourself you have you've i think that's the thing you you've you've want to do certain things and you've make yourself do them
S0084	yeah
S0083	instead of think oh i'd really like to do that but i never could you think i really want to do that right now erm i'm go to erm book this and save that and go there and you you've do it
S0084	mm to a degree yeah there's obviously there's always more
S0083	you absolutely have you absolutely have
S0084	yeah
S0083	and that's the difference because a teenager would have say i'd like to do that but that's not go to happen
S0084	well i live in a safety net you know when you're when you're live at home you know it's all very easy and very safe and you're parent look after you and as soon as you move out you're on your own and that first few years be a real test
S0083	yeah yeah mm mm but that that's i think that's what make the difference which be which be i mean beyond anything obviously the education but i think that's what go to uni do for you
S0084	mm yeah yeah yeah absolutely
S0083	it make you think you could do anything and you do
S0084	mm yeah it do and and meet other people because obviously grow up you see the same people day in day out i mean there's no one new there's new think really everyone's do the same thing and
S0083	mm mm mm mm yeah
S0084	it's not until you go to uni and you meet people from all walk of life and all different background and you all think differently and you all have different challenge and they challenge your perception of yourself and the world and anything that you take for grant and it's not until you keep meet new people and i mean it sound really tripe but it's true
S0083	exactly yeah exactly mm no it's absolutely true and it it certainly be for you
S0084	i think that and that's probably why i'm more bolshy than be very well you know take the way that treat her
S0083	mm
S0084	she doesn't feel she's able to stand up to these people and i think because i start off in my work life do that say actually no you're not go to take advantage
S0083	mm mm
S0084	you know i do i work there when i be seventeen and they do take advantage
S0083	they do yeah
S0084	and that be my first work experience whereas 's be be that her first job
S0083	it wasn't her first job erm
S0084	what be her first job
S0083	although that be the one that she really like she'd i'd forget actually she remind me she work at for about a month and then leave
S0084	oh that's right wasn't she wasn't she do the sale something
S0083	because she hat it
S0084	yeah fair enough it be horrible
S0083	it be a horrible place to work
S0084	but be easy and safe she like most of the people she work with
S0083	yeah yeah
S0084	her boss be i think you know boss as boss be but no one take advantage
S0083	no
S0084	and i think at that age because i'd have to stand up to and i'm you know i'm be red in the face i be sweat and want to cry but i be very convince that i be right
S0083	mm mm
S0084	and at that point i think i think well actually you can't can't walk over people and i don't know whether naturally we're different because i wouldn't allow it
S0083	mm you be naturally different you be naturally more bolshy
S0084	yeah and i've get more so as i've get older which be which be a bad thing
S0083	yeah
S0084	like i accidentally offend one of my colleagues the other day i didn't mean to obviously i mean no one ever mean to offend them but and i have go for a drink at the pub on our way home and my colleague tom have come with us he's bite of a wide boy bite of a loud mouth and we get into the pub and we be just have a laugh have a nice time and i can't remember how we get onto the subject
S0083	mm
S0084	and er i be say i think because i wasn't really quality control what be come out
S0084	and i'd say oh i i think people who believe in jesus be just a bite silly like it won't i don't mean to but i have a really critical opinion of people who believe in religion because i can't marry the two ideas that a logical person can also believe in god because for me i i don't think of it as a logical decision really because it's faith and whatever and
S0083	mm mm mm mm
S0084	our director of our financial director i find out the other day be a a be very religious and he go to church every week and it's fine his choice
S0083	mm
S0084	but by say this i i didn't realise i be offend tom who be quite religious and i didn't know this and obviously why would i it's not you know you don't need to shout about it
S0083	mm mm well exactly
S0084	but i wasn't really think and obviously i'm entitle to my own opinion but it be it be quite offensive if you if you take it that way i didn't mean it to be
S0083	of course
S0084	and then we be talk about the riot in london and he be get really agitate and he be say his cousin female very petite
S0083	mm
S0084	be er be in the police work for the meet and be part of the riot erm the riot troop that come out
S0083	mm
S0084	and he be say i'm not be funny right but women you know why do they put them in these position and i say well she would have have train
S0083	mm
S0084	they wouldn't have let her go out if they think that she couldn't you know look after herself and her other fellow officer
S0083	mm
S0084	and he be say you know she's tiny and he get up from the table and start demonstrate but then be like gesticulate in my face he be like say so you're tell me that a girl could stand up to me i've get a black belt in karate and he be get really really really violent
S0083	mm
S0084	and he neck his beer and be oh look sorry whatever and then run for his train and i be say to each other where do that come from that be so strange he really be get really erm really irate
S0083	mm
S0084	and then a couple of days later say oh i think i know what the problem with be turn out he's really religious i think you really offend him with your comment
S0083	oh
S0084	but he didn't say anything to me he didn't say oh well i'm religious
S0083	no he didn't no
S0084	he didn't challenge me maybe he didn't want me to know
S0083	yeah
S0084	which be fine and i don't know what it i would have do if it be the other way round i mean i might have fight my corner a bite and say well hang on you can't really judge people like that or fine whatever
S0083	or if not if if he if you don't want to enter the debate you just say to yourself that's their view i've get my view leave it
S0084	yeah he's perfectly entitle to believe in god do you know what i mean i'm not say i be say i sort of think less of these people
S0083	of course he be yeah yeah
S0084	i wasn't say they're stupid i i be say that it's actually my stupidity because i can't help but judge
S0083	no mm
S0084	erm that i find it strange
S0083	i think it's i think what you say be perfectly valid to say that you you can't see the the sense because it's it's not a logical thing to do and that's all you be say yeah
S0084	it's not a logical thing it's not yeah it's not even that i think they yeah it's not reason yeah
S0083	well it's it's not reason be it it be faith yeah
S0084	i wasn't call people who believe in religion stupid necessarily i be just say that i can't marry the two ideas that if you be a logical person you would therefore believe in god
S0083	mm mm mm no he should have say something or or if not he should have just leave well alone
S0084	yeah just leave it alone
S0083	yeah
S0084	so now he's he's be a bite off with me in the office which be a bite weird
S0083	mm
S0084	i mean we didn't know each other that well before but it's quite i mean there's probably a hundred a hundred of us that sit on the same floor but you see each other all the time you know in the coffee area or whatever and yeah he have be a bite off but
S0083	mm mm mm mm oh it will blow over
S0084	i think if you're so he's but obviously he's not somebody i would really be friends with anyway because he's obviously get a bite of a women issue there
S0083	mm mm mm
S0084	erm but er yeah it be a bite strange i don't know really where it it come from
S0083	no
S0084	but i think go back to what we be say i think that's probably because i do speak without think often and er
S0083	mm oh we all do
S0084	i think i'm so convince of my own opinions now that i'm not necessarily that bother about other people's
S0084	maybe that's how i've always be i don't know i think i think that's something that come with age and confidence i think like not necessarily be you know be open to other people's ideas but i think i be no that's not right this be what i think
S0083	yeah mm
S0084	and i i'm aware of that i try not to be but i think if someone say something that i don't agree with i'd say what be you talk about that's not the case it's like this and but then i think you know check yourself
S0083	mm mm the more you mix with people and lot of different people with as you say different background different view erm
S0084	bless you bless you
S0083	oh dear right okay erm i think there be another one come erm you have you have to deal with the fact that there be lot of different view and opinions in the world and some be obviously just wrong
S0084	mm mm
S0083	but it also it help you to crystallise your own ideas you know when when you hear different view you have to take those view on board and then you you kind of you you know so you you're constantly
S0084	mm yeah you compare them to what you believe and and question what you believe
S0083	absolutely and it therefore make you think about what it be you believe and so it either er confirm it or it might challenge it and you think oh well i hadn't think of things like that so
S0084	mm mm yeah challenge it absolutely yeah
S0083	so the more you mix the more you talk it erm i think i think it's it's all a help because it will it will it help your think about your own view
S0084	it's a good thing yeah yeah it's just remember to be open to those view
S0083	yeah
S0084	not necessarily shoot them down
S0083	but not yes just just as a as a knee jerk reaction but also you know not to just take on other people's view because it's somebody else and you think oh they're much cleverer than me you know
S0084	mm
S0083	i mean which be which be you know the other thing that can happen so
S0084	mm
S0083	but it but it help in some ways it doesn't help when when you're all the same and you're all think and do the same thing and that's not terribly healthy i think it's like it's like live in one community where you you know there's just one world view i mean that's where racism start because you be with your own kind and anyone who's different be therefore see as dangerous or erm or a difference be see as a threat
S0084	mm mm mm mm mm
S0083	the more we mix with you know all the differences that you know of opinion of culture of background the better for all of us i think
S0084	absolutely yeah
S0083	but i think that's the problem i think people do live in their little enclaves you know erm and they see different difference as frighten as a threat
S0084	mm a bad thing yeah mm
S0083	rather than welcome it and and enjoy it appreciate it learn from it it doesn't mean that you have to give up your own identity this be this be what i you know they never
S0084	yeah
S0083	you know that's not what's require and i think they're worry that that it be
S0084	mm
S0083	anyway sorry to bang on but i think i think just generally it's healthy er for all of us to to challenge our own view
S0084	mm
S0083	because often it will confirm them as well
S0084	yeah yeah yeah absolutely
S0083	i mean you know you realise that actually yeah i be i be i be on on track there because that's that's clearly the best way and the best way forward
S0084	i think that's right yeah mm yeah
S0083	but we do get very stick in our ways of think
S0084	mm that's it if you spend all of your time with one type of person one group of people then yeah you do
S0083	mm or just in your own head all the time you know you're not challenge it you know you're not have else come in
S0084	mm
S0083	erm no other view no other input from anywhere i mean that's why we read and we talk and we listen and we you know because that's it isn't it i mean
S0084	mm
S0083	the discussion of ideas the the the the free flow of ideas between people be be what have make us and and what will continue to make us a good society
S0084	mm yeah like the enlightenment
S0083	well that be i mean that just remind me of mum because it be it's like she decide this be what she believe and that be that and she wasn't interest in anything yep a lot of people be like that a lot of right wing be terribly this be their view of the world and you're not go to move them
S0084	mm mm yeah well it's it's put up barriers to other thoughts it's it's some sort of patronise erm way of speak to people
S0083	mm mm it be
S0084	erm no dear that's not what we think this be what we think parrot fashion
S0083	because it's it's it's their sense of superiority
S0084	mm
S0083	and it's it's a it's a put down of erm you know other class other culture as as be inferior to theirs
S0084	mm
S0083	and and not allow anything to challenge that because if you challenge that you will see weaknesses in that and you have to accept other things as be important or right
S0084	mm
S0083	and they you know it's it's it's not want to allow that to happen i think
S0084	yeah
S0083	so you cling on to your view and you don't you don't allow any anything to challenge that and you're not like that you be you you just you have strong view in the same in the same way that a lot of us do about what's important about what's right
S0084	yeah
S0083	i don't think you're close i don't think you're
S0084	i don't think i'm close i think i'm
S0083	i think you just i think you know at have get to the age that you have and do the things that you've do i think you realise certain things be important and and you you're not shy about say that
S0084	yeah i'm i'm aware of my own value and and my core value and what i think be important
S0083	well that's fine
S0084	yeah but i try not to i try not to judge too quickly but i guess we're all a bite guilty of that
S0083	well exactly we we can all do that
S0084	mm
S0083	oh you're beat yourself up a bite this morning don't do that
S0084	no no no no it's sort of just self reflection isn't it
S0083	mm well again that's an incredibly important thing to do it i mean we all can take it too far
S0084	yeah
S0083	but it's a very important thing to people who don't that i think be people you just don't want to be with you don't want to be around them
S0084	well i think people that don't have get something to hide from themselves haven't they because why don't they want to look inside
S0083	if people it's too dangerous it's too scary
S0084	it's yeah there's something bury there
S0083	and you might
S0084	might not like what you see
S0083	it it allow doubt i mean that's the thing you know you can't allow if you've get very strict erm er very rigid view
S0084	yeah
S0083	you can't allow doubt in because then it will upset that
S0084	yeah like the right wingers
S0083	i mean i i think that's a very a very good say erm no let me get it right the most dangerous person in the world be be the person who know that they're right
S0084	oh that's interest
S0083	i think that's that's because if you know you're right if you have no doubt at all know you be right i mean that make you dangerous because you be capable of do anything because you know you be right
S0084	mm mm mm
S0083	erm hitler know he be right
S0084	mm
S0083	didn't he
S0084	yeah absolutely
S0083	and stalin
S0084	mm
S0083	these mad dictators they know they're right
S0084	mm
S0083	and they will do anything in the cause of that
S0084	yeah
S0083	that about which they know they be right
S0084	i mean i don't want to you know compare blair to hitler but blair think blair know he be right
S0083	no absolutely and that make him very dangerous because he would do anything
S0084	mm mm
S0083	and bush they know they're right
S0084	mm
S0083	no no opposition
S0084	mm
S0083	and it make them very dangerous because they're prepare to go to war because they be right
S0084	mm
S0083	so beware of anyone who know that they're right
S0084	mm
S0084	yes indeedy
S0083	ah you're so cute all curl up
S0084	he look pretty please with himself
S0083	he's very relax

S0084	yeah
S0083	it's not something fly it's when they're test them
S0084	right okay

S0083	she want to watch strangers on a train and i put it on and she sleep all the way through it
S0084	be that gregory peck
S0083	no it's not
S0084	it's clark
S0083	it's it's no it's not it's
S0084	cary
S0083	it's one of those film erm
S0084	where you think it's someone famous and it's not
S0083	and it's not
S0084	mm
S0083	i mean i've see it many time so i know i i can't think of they're not household name anyway put it that way
S0084	mm
S0083	erm i think both of them make film at the time but erm and it's a good film but i have see it many time
S0084	yeah
S0083	erm but she sleep through it now now where do she get the idea it's very old it's black and white
S0084	it's from a it's from another film isn't it or it's it's reference in a song cos we be talk about strangers on a train
S0083	oh no that's why she's
S0084	and it be reference and we i couldn't tell you what it be it be but either we be talk about it or she'd someone have mention it in class or something someone have mention it for her to get the idea and i can't remember whether it where the idea have come from
S0083	mm oh right but somebody give her the idea cos if i'd say it she wouldn't
S0084	the thing be there's there's like you know if you watch rope it's completely different to anything you've ever see before
S0083	absolutely
S0084	it's like watch a play and if if she doesn't
S0083	and all hitchcock film although you can tell they're hitchcock
S0084	yeah
S0083	they be all different form each other
S0084	yeah well it's because he's make film for forty years
S0083	yeah
S0084	you know his early film be influence by german cinema which be a bite weird
S0083	mm
S0084	which be why his early film be a bite peculiar
S0083	yeah
S0084	then he move to hollywood and make hollywood blockbusters and then he make yeah some interest arty film i think you can see how he develop
S0083	yeah of course
S0084	cos obviously he make them for such a long time but naturally within that within that forty years you be go to find a film that you quite like
S0083	yeah mm yeah
S0084	i mean it's brilliant
S0083	i would think so
S0084	apart from the bird
S0083	and different ones like like that be very different
S0084	yeah have she see that she'd like that
S0083	i don't know whether because i use to have it on video so maybe she remember but
S0084	yeah but we we've we've definitely watch it i've see it a couple of time but erm
S0083	yeah mm
S0084	she'd watch that
S0083	but she's very odd about the things that she will and won't watch
S0084	yeah it's difficult to predict
S0083	i i can't predict i can't second guess her at all
S0084	it's amaze what a small surface area you can get all four paw on
S0083	i know i know it always amaze me
S0084	mm

S0084	at the begin of june fourth and fifth of june or third and fourth of june
S0083	be it i think so that's in june and the olympics be july right
S0084	end of july
S0083	good grief
S0084	yeah no escape it
S0083	no so this be sixty years isn't it
S0084	mm
S0083	yeah she's catch up on victoria
S0084	mm
S0083	cos how long cos wait a minute i do know
S0084	i don't know when she be crown but she die in nineteen o one
S0083	that's right sixty four years she be
S0084	really
S0083	yeah sixty four
S0084	and she be the longest serve monarch
S0083	yeah so i think lizzie's go to overtake her
S0084	well if she's go to be like her mum then yeah
S0083	mm
S0084	she could live for another twenty years
S0083	she could
S0084	how old be she wait how old be she when she be crown
S0083	well she be she be young she be in her twenties she be young
S0084	be she twenty so she probably eighty
S0083	whereas victoria be a be a i think she be actually a teenager wasn't she about eighteen or something when she become queen
S0084	yeah yeah
S0083	erm i i think she be bear i i erm i think she be bear in twenty six because mum be bear in thirty six and i just remember
S0084	okay
S0083	twenty years before erm so what do that make her six
S0084	eighty six
S0083	god oh be she really
S0084	well she must be
S0083	yeah cos the duke's ninety isn't he ninety one
S0084	yeah yeah yeah ninety one this year but he's get to be senile hasn't he i mean i know granddad keep all of his faculties until he be you know when he die
S0083	yeah
S0084	he just you know his body be give up on him
S0083	mm
S0084	so it happen but you'd think that by the time you get to ninety you're brain it would just be mush
S0083	mm well not necessarily i mean really not necessarily i mean i don't know i don't know how
S0084	it depend how active you keep it i suppose and they live a life of luxury so
S0083	they do yeah
S0084	it's not like he'd be use his brain an awful lot
S0083	if he ever do
S0084	if he ever do he certainly never have any quality control do he with what come out
S0083	oh
S0084	have he be feed
S0083	yes where be he
S0084	probably twice he's out in the garden
S0083	what's he meow for oh
S0084	so she's eighty six so erm queen mum be what hundred and two
S0083	yeah
S0084	so she's potentially she's get another sixteen years
S0083	yes what be you complain about what be you complain about be there bird out there
S0084	at which point charles cos isn't charles a couple of years younger than dad so he's sixties
S0083	he's a year younger i think he be bear in forty eight
S0084	right so in which case this year he's fifty sixty four
S0083	yeah god yeah
S0084	erm and in sixteen years he'd be eighty my maths be bad
S0084	he'd be eighty so he might be senile
S0083	yeah
S0084	in which case maybe it would go skip him altogether and go to william
S0083	and people have often say that people have often suggest that i mean years twenty years ago they be say
S0084	mm
S0083	you know the queen the queen's obviously go to live a very long time and he might never be king and wouldn't it be better just to give it to william
S0084	he's hold out for hmm yes it will it depend how he like if he's really desperate to be king then he's go to want it whether he's senile or not
S0083	but he wouldn't be king for very long it will be like edward the seventh
S0084	yeah
S0083	yeah and it be and it be more the frustration you know that he i mean that that be true you know when the only job you have be wait for someone to die so you can do their job
S0084	yeah
S0083	what do you do with your life
S0084	mm
S0083	and i think that's always be his frustration what to do with his life and and it must be i mean it's in that way it's not his fault it's it's the it's the structure of the of the monarchy isn't it
S0084	well i suppose but you can still you know the princes certainly er be busy enough and they go out their two young princes
S0083	he's certainly try to do things
S0084	i mean they're out and about meet people you know support and and that's what he do well be do it for sixty five years hasn't he but yeah
S0083	oh that's what charles have always do i mean there's only so much of that you can do i mean they have to be so bore so bore just meet people oh long have you be do this oh yes do you enjoy do that oh yes
S0084	he's quite into the all green way of life as well isn't he he's quite a champion you know erm all about climate change and
S0083	he have be yeah he's have he's have various project i mean he make erm
S0084	he form the princes trust
S0083	he do he do i mean he have do he's i think he's someone who would like to have a project and he would throw himself into something like that
S0084	mm mm
S0083	and i think he do do
S0084	get's very passionate about things
S0083	erm his house be it highgrove i think that's what it's call
S0084	the one on the mall
S0083	highgrove house no where i mean it's i think it's where he and diana live and i presume it's where he live
S0084	well there's one that belong to him ext to the palace isn't there
S0083	clarence house
S0084	clarence house yeah
S0083	yeah i think i think they've get that as well maybe i don't know
S0084	that's his isn't it
S0083	anyway he turn it into a a you know a completely kind of sustainable house i mean even even things like cos i mean cos people be horrify at the time but it's it's really good way of do it
S0084	really
S0083	erm the waste systems you know all the plumb and the waste from the house erm rather than go into the the main sewerage system erm they they build a series of reed bed which filter and clean water it's a completely natural way of
S0084	mm sewers mm
S0083	i mean and there be a big programme about all of that and he grow all his own stuff and you know it's all very green and sustainable and he he be really into the whole thing
S0084	wow yeah yeah mm
S0083	and i think well that's really good i mean obviously you need the money to do it but
S0084	oh absolutely
S0083	but at least he's do so fair enough
S0084	it's a good model for
S0083	and that be a big project for a long time
S0084	mm i can imagine
S0083	yeah
S0084	i think i remember read in the paper that blair at the time be quite would get frustrate with him because he would try and get involve in politics and it's all like that's a bite of bite of a no no in this day and age but to have someone take an interest in the monarchy be be important i think you know they be suppose to be the head of our of our country whether that's in name only which it essentially be
S0083	mm it be exactly mm yeah
S0084	but they should be they should know what's go on they should be involve in the policy make you know this be completely ridiculous if they've get to go and ask the queen if they can form a government but actually she's go no say in what the laws be
S0083	mm mm well that's pretty much how it be
S0084	well absolutely and and there's reason for that i mean look at our history but still if you're go to have a monarchy have them involve or don't have one
S0083	mm mm yeah
S0084	this whole pretence it's very very strange
S0083	it be pretence yeah
S0084	this black rod knock on the house of commons and
S0083	i know and that's why it get frustrate because you think well what be we pay them to do and it's it's billions
S0084	well tourism
S0083	you know
S0084	oh absolutely but the country wouldn't be without them there's more pro monarchists than there be anti
S0083	i think that's it i think people just like it
S0084	it's it's historic you know
S0083	i i don't know what it be erm because be try to work this out and and she just come to the conclusion that it's it's just something people like it's nice
S0084	it's nice
S0083	it have no no real value
S0084	tourism be the value
S0083	but but oh well that's what people say i mean i don't know
S0084	well look at the wed last year look at the jubilee people flood to the uk i particularly er you know countries in the commonwealth
S0083	but why do they it doesn't make any sense but why do they like it
S0084	they love it i suppose they i don't know people get quite fascinate by that sense of tradition aren't they
S0083	it be weird isn't it
S0084	i mean if you look at countries that be obsess with british culture you know in japan they've get erm they've get their own globe build they've get their own mini stratford upon avon build you know they love they go mad for it and in term of money that's it's very lucrative
S0083	it's so strange isn't it
S0084	it's a big it's big money spinner for the uk
S0083	i suppose that's that's how
S0084	and that's part of the reason for have the olympics here it's bring people here it's make people aware of what's go on and it's provide job for people this year you know provide work for people
S0083	yeah yeah
S0084	obviously by september they'll be out of work but at a time when there be few job then
S0083	yeah i suppose
S0084	i don't understand it i mean it be billions be it almost a billion pound isn't it
S0083	but it's i think more than that it's it's the money that's be pour into an area of london that that need it but it's not the people who actually live there that will benefit from it
S0084	mm no well it's the rich people who will come in and buy all the house and up the rent
S0083	yeah and that's what they're that's what's happen
S0084	it will drive people out into into the slum because that's the area that people could afford to live in
S0083	and it's and and the the new build the new build be be expensive build so
S0084	it's not affordable house
S0083	no
S0083	just seem very wrong
S0084	mm it be
S0083	but it be like you know the rich have always live in the west and then the north and then the south and now they're move into the east of london so what area of london be there for ordinary work class people to live in
S0084	yeah yeah mm no nowhere
S0084	it do look like it's go to rain doesn't it
S0083	it's windy as well it's it's it's not actually
S0084	and that's quite a grey cloud come over
S0083	it be i don't know whether to put the wash out or not now
S0084	i mean we might we're usually just on the edge of it aren't we
S0083	we be
S0084	i mean it will be good the garden need the rain
S0083	it do i mean that's the other thing
S0084	it's very dry
S0083	richard always go ah you're always say this you always jinx the weather but the thing be we do have very dry weather here and we need rain
S0084	mm mm mother earth be so dry
S0083	it do dry out and and we need it
S0083	in the summer we're go to need it we've get a hosepipe ban it's go to be really hard water all the vegetables it will be very hard
S0084	they're go to have to i mean you're go to have to just decide what the priorities be and some of them
S0083	well everything need water
S0084	i know i know i know but in term of whether you keep the roses alive or whether you keep the veg alive
S0083	mm well the roses be okay
S0084	do you say that there be they quite temperamental the roses
S0083	no no they're they're roses be pretty hardy
S0084	once they're in they're okay be they
S0083	yeah they can put up with most they don't like absolute drought
S0084	no have they get quite deep root though
S0083	yes they do have very deep root and obviously the longer they're in
S0084	mm
S0083	i mean these these have only right these four have be in two years now obviously i'm go to have to be careful with the new one and i'll water that regularly
S0084	mm yeah yeah
S0083	but i mean every summer i've be able to water it as much as i like
S0084	yeah
S0083	and the roses don't like be very dry they can tolerate a certain amount
S0084	it's difficult isn't it because they're they're the ones that need all the sun
S0083	yeah
S0084	so they would dry out
S0083	mm
S0084	i wonder what they're go to do the botanics
S0083	one thing i must do then erm if you fancy a trip to the garden centre
S0084	mhm oh with you need to get that little piece
S0083	we need to get the thing to to to erm fee in the er water butt so that i can use that
S0084	absolutely well why don't you have a cycle over to during the week and if they don't have it then we'll drive down there
S0083	they don't have that no i mean it's it's it's quite a specialist
S0084	oh have you look
S0083	it's not just like i mean only have like the the hose bite and and that kind of thing so so it's erm
S0084	that's fine we can drive out there
S0083	oh be tell me there's another er garden centre that's much much nicer
