S0618	wow
S0619	but the second series i wasn't really sure at first because it be so different just like the first series be you know not exactly well it be kind of star cross lovers he be from a muslim family she be from a
S0618	so this be a different case now
S0619	uhu
S0618	so what happen with the first one do it go to appeal and do he get out
S0619	not yet they be still wait
S0618	oh okay to be continue right
S0619	to be continue erm but that be you know teenagers they be seventeen or eighteen when it happen star cross lovers he be muslim and she be korean and their families didn't want them to be together erm and you know and blah blah blah but the second series be more high profile it's about an american soldier who be camp or base in afghanistan and he say he just walk away one day from the base he be suppose to be man his position and he just do a runner from the army he be capture by the taliban and hold prisoner in different locations for five years torture starve beat for five years erm so i'm not really sure what erm he's go to be put on trial and possibly imprison in the state for you know run away
S0618	mm uhu mm good man mm oh my god abandon his post
S0619	abandon his post
S0618	you'd think what more punishment could there be have be torture by the taliban
S0619	yeah but you know all the time that he be with the taliban he be try to collect intel find out information it be like he he didn't intend to be pick up by the taliban he just
S0618	where do he think he be go to go in afghanistan
S0619	well he be just hop he would just be able to evade evade evade get to pakistan and then sort of just you know hide away or go home and hide or whatever i don't know what he expect to happen but you know the sort of months after he have vanish you know the army and all the people base in all the soldier base in that area have to drop whatever missions they be do to search for this one man who didn't want to be find by the american army or by the or by the taliban and you know this be it be the same woman from the series from the previous one who be the sort of journalist and she's listen to record call between the soldier and er another journalist who speak to him at the time and they become quite close and they speak on the phone all the time erm but she be also speak to the taliban via an interpreter and she be like that be just me on the phone to the taliban so you know so at first i really didn't know if i sort of like it because it be so different to anything i'm not really sure what the crime be or what she's investigate or try to work out because it all seem pretty clear he leave because of this because he didn't want to do it anymore and he be pick up by these people er and it be awful
S0618	mm yeah oh wow mm oh my god mm as you do yeah yeah yeah i can understand that yeah they identify him as an enemy and punish him and blah blah blah
S0619	well not identify him as only an enemy but somebody of value
S0618	yeah you see some of come to their country to kill their people so you can kind of understand people take exception to that
S0619	yeah so i'm not really sure where it's go but as they've be erm release one episode every week people be come forward in all different countries like in afghanistan in pakistan where he spend a lot of his sort of capture and anyone in the state and soldier who he know at the time and they be all sort of have their say so they've have to stagger it every two weeks so that they can
S0618	yeah mm oh wow what be these podcast yeah
S0619	mm
S0618	okay
S0619	so like accumulate so it be really live
S0618	interest
S0619	yeah so yes
S0618	so what's the purpose of the broadcast be it you know who be produce it as a a media outlet er a radio station a
S0619	no it be just this woman
S0618	this woman
S0619	this woman from serial erm
S0618	this woman so serial who produce that be that like a fox cbn news thing
S0619	no no no no it's just like this group of people and to get your podcast on the air you either pay for it or you get a sponsor so it be sponsor i think i'm not sure this season be but last season it be sponsor by dropbox you know dropbox so at the begin they say er this be sponsor by dropbox as dropbox be x y z blah blah dropbox be great thank you bye and now on with the programme just like that it be just like they have one advertiser and then that's it erm one advertisement and that's it
S0618	oh okay mm oh that's interest wow mm yeah wow
S0619	yeah so it's it's an interest type of you know er media i suppose and you know it be so different to watch things on tv and you've really get to focus and you can't do anything else you can't mess on your phone or you know because you will text
S0618	yeah yeah because you're actively listen
S0619	mm so it be really good for the gym or for walk around erm just when you've get nothing else to do
S0618	mm that's good
S0619	but podcast some be funny i be listen to another one and i be walk around and i be like i start laugh and i think i'm go to get beat up if i'm just walk along the streets laugh hysterically to myself people be go to take offence
S0618	they will probably run away from you before they hit you
S0619	who be this crazy laugh person
S0618	that's alright it be an english girl
S0619	i don't know why with a strange russian accent but yeah it's weird interestingly
S0618	mm those podcast sound interest though
S0619	yeah er
S0618	mm i do like the way this whole sort of multimedia universe that we live in and open up new possibilities and new make new connections that aren't necessarily connect with the mainstream
S0619	mm mm yeah i suppose it be just like listen to the radio it use to be but if you can't
S0618	or the bbc get own
S0619	i don't remember those days but you know what i mean but you know it like people who listen to the archers erm all these cars be go to crash into each other here oh no they be alright they alright erm
S0618	ha ha they sort it
S0619	erm like people who listen to the archers but on like iplayer because they miss it at the time or whatever i've get a friend who have get who set her alarm on sunday mornings so that just in time for the archers and then the alarm clock turn on with the archers
S0618	wow that's dedication
S0619	that be dedication so yeah but it be nice for like cook because i always like music or i use to try to watch tv and cook but it be it get dangerous so podcast and cook
S0618	mm that's the way to go it be interest what you say about you can't live with your phone or do texts because you're so absorb in your podcast and i find that suddenly i've become more sort of more conscious of that this last week or two also watch i be watch endeavour a pre morse thing on erm
S0619	yeah mm itv
S0618	yeah if you go to stv player and you do it through mozilla you don't get any advert yeah anyway i be watch that and i keep have to rewind it because i be faffing about on whatsapp erm on the the text and viber and what have you message people then i think what be i do be i watch telly or be i communicate on my phone make your mind up you can't do both so
S0619	mm yeah yeah mm yeah so podcast you've just get to ban it or pause it while you do whatever you need to do and then go back to it
S0618	yeah i flick my phone onto airplane mode quite a lot now
S0619	but that's good
S0618	yeah and it charge quicker as well
S0619	i've never be erm like i've be watch these spanish film that's the same you can message on your phone because you don't know what's go on because you can't sort of like passively be watch it or be passively be listen you've really get to be look at the screen all the time
S0618	no yeah engage all the time really
S0619	and we be lose this this like ability to concentrate or this er attention span and it's like what's that oh it's a message
S0618	yeah what i like about you be maybe it's because your phone be record this i don't think it be but you be not look at every text message you get when we go out
S0619	yeah
S0618	and that's a general rule you don't do that and i like that
S0619	a lot of the time i don't do that be because i don't have wi fi so i'm actively prevent from use my phone
S0618	mm mm yeah but i find if i be in company if i go out for coffee or go out for a meal or something i don't want to be interrupt by text message because i've go out to see that person so i want to engage with their company i find it really incredibly rude erm my niece do it a lot actually you will be have a conversation and her phone go bing and she cut off the conversation and look at it and i think well hello i be here we be just you be halfway through say something and i don't think she realise she do it you know it's quite unconscious
S0619	yeah mm mm mm mm yeah mm mm yes no and it's a really normal thing to do a lot of my friends do it and you know we go out for dinner and you know everyone be you know like you be sit around the table in a restaurant and you have like a plate a knife and fork and phone
S0619	you know like it's like it's just part of the table arrangement yeah erm
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm i don't know i don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing and i'm always suspicious of people who don't have facebook and who don't use their phone very often or like people don't like send message hat whatsapp and hat text message and if i send him a text he will just immediately call me cos it be just easier for him and i think i kind of think oh that's you know that's very nice instead of very erm primal i don't know like back to erm
S0618	mm yeah yeah yeah that's fair enough yeah quite old fashion
S0619	yes gosh imagine use a phone for its original purpose how disgust
S0618	goodness to make a phone call oh dear
S0619	i've not make a phone call for about five years
S0619	why on earth would i want to do that
S0618	you want to facetime yes skype yes a phone call goodness no
S0619	oh no why would i want to do that
S0618	yeah
S0619	that's funny
S0618	so why be you suspicious of people who don't engage with the technology in that way
S0619	no i oh alright especially facebook when people who go i don't want to be on the the internet i don't care what people be have for breakfast and you think oh oh come on
S0618	mm
S0619	i don't know i just think people be be sort of contentious for the sake of it and they would just be a lot happier if they just sort of you don't have to use it you don't have to sort of actively be a part of it but just have it there
S0618	yeah i find my german friends and polish friends be all my facebook friends none of them post anything i call them lurkers they be facebook lurkers
S0619	mm mm yeah there's nothing wrong with lurk
S0618	well i do have a phase where i block the lot of them so i think well if i can't see what you be up to because you be not post then you be not go to see what i'm up to but you know i've get over myself and unblock them all
S0619	yeah one of my friends
S0618	i suppose it be the cultural difference the germans be very suspicious they sort of
S0619	what so like the government be watch
S0618	yeah yeah i mean my er berlin friends be chase the the google it's try to google street in berlin
S0619	that's hilarious
S0618	yeah
S0619	no i just i just think well why what be you why it's not that big a deal er but someone on twitter say if you win the lottery would you delete any social media account
S0618	mm
S0619	and i think oh i don't know
S0618	not straightaway
S0619	i don't know
S0618	i think if i get a lot of beg letter and grovel unsolicited approach from people for money i'd soon get rid of it because i wouldn't be do with all of that guilt erm or to engage with that level of victimhood we be talk about earlier erm
S0619	mm mm mm yeah i don't know how it i don't know because i i and my answer to that be i would just be a lurker i wouldn't ever post on any social media but i would just like to know what my friends be up to and you know i really enjoy twitter and i would you know miss the joke and what's go on in the world but don't draw attention to yourself and don't be part of it
S0618	mm mm yeah so it would change your relationships
S0619	my friend at university once change my facebook status to oh i've just win two thousand pound on a scratch card
S0618	what your status
S0619	yeah fb it me and i i just get a strange number of texts that day oh hi how be you what have you be up to
S0618	how be you today
S0619	it be only two thousand imaginary pound
S0618	not even two thousands real pound
S0619	i'm not gonna give it to you you don't even get a lollipop what be do lurk around for crawl out the woodwork at two thousand imaginary pound
S0618	that's really funny
S0619	but imagine if you if you win like fifty million real pound
S0618	i'd like to think that my friends would text me or ring and say oh i hear you've win some money congratulations really delight for you
S0619	and not go can i have something or like just always sidle around it like it's some big elephant in the room
S0618	yeah rather than how be you yeah yeah that's really funny
S0619	it be just like fuck hell drink be on you pal
S0618	i would be tempt to try that just to see what the reactions be that's really interest
S0619	i just win ten thousand on a scratch card
S0618	well i will know what that will be well english people would say what's that then fifty p ten pound but no it's
S0619	it be really fun it be just like why have you all i've not speak to you for years that's really interest gosh you must be poor sorry i don't know
S0618	i don't know i suppose er maybe there's a modicum of self worth attach to know somebody or be connect with somebody who have something perceptibly wonderful like have win some money it's a bite like you know
S0619	mm yeah the grass be always greener
S0618	well i don't know it be like have a connection to a famous person erm that kind of a thing it's almost like a person's self worth or status can go up a notch because of their association or connection with something perceptibly positive i don't know i just think throw that out there
S0619	mm yeah yeah yeah yeah mm well so people wouldn't want to be a friend not on the off chance that you would get money but just because you've get a high end social status than you do ten minutes before
S0618	yeah because you've get some money mm hooray mm
S0619	good noise thank you
S0618	i don't know
S0619	i don't know either
