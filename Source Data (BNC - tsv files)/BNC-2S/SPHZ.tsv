S0058	so good stuff er what be we just talk about
S0179	dunno something probably back on
S0058	yeah oh those traffic light yeah cut through them
S0179	wasn't a rivet topic of conversation
S0058	no it wasn't no
S0179	to start on
S0058	ah ten degrees it's go up maybe go to that thai restaurant it be quite nice
S0179	yes it be alright
S0058	no i mean as as in as an event not the food be fine but the um
S0179	yeah it be quite nice
S0058	be quite nice yeah and i like it in there the atmosphere's kind of fun and it's kinda different even er yeah i mean the food's fine but it be nice
S0058	yeah it be yeah very cunning
S0179	yeah oh no that's not gonna help
S0179	well no it's marginally safer for us but and therefore them but you know
S0058	i always think be a particularly depress name for a place
S0179	sorry
S0058	be a particularly er depress name for a place
S0179	mm
S0058	a town where it rain it probably doesn't mean that but
S0179	this be just such a frustrate road why be there why okay it's get some crossroads but it doesn't need to be a fifty
S0179	aha the road read my mind
S0179	wow
S0058	exactly handy when it do that it'd be great if it be like oh this road be too busy and suddenly all the cars come off
S0179	where would they go to
S0058	just away doesn't matter
S0179	uh
S0058	ah the bus see that number twenty right it start on durham road understandably and um then you think oh well we're durham that be really quick that's a great service you know then it go round every single little town on either side of this road all the way there it's so frustrate
S0179	how long do it take
S0058	um about an hour
S0179	wow
S0058	yeah
S0179	but you'd think they'd have the bus which go straight there and then a bus that do some of them and then bus that do the others
S0058	i i don't think there be an express to durham there's certainly an express to newcastle but i don't think there's one to durham
S0179	there's a tram to newcastle
S0058	yeah
S0179	there's not many other transport link to durham
S0058	no no exactly and it's really annoy as in the the only other way to do it be to get get a train to newcastle and a train to durham like which be that's it
S0058	er as it i mean as it happen it's relatively handy for us cos we live so close to so you just hop on a bus but then once you're on the bus that's where the fun start
S0179	that's clever
S0058	that's a stupid sign
S0179	what
S0058	there's a house a sign for a house development say if you live here you'd be home by now yes yes thank you
S0058	i know but it just seem really just seem quite random
S0179	well er so there's a
S0058	oh a trainline
S0179	yeah
S0058	fair enough
S0179	the well no but there be one on the thameslink train but no it er make more sense when you're drive but it didn't make sense on the thameslink one cos it be like if you live here you'd be home now no we'd have to go to the next station
S0179	which be sort of five minutes away then get somehow get back
S0058	yeah
S0179	so actually it's probably at the bare minimum a quarter of an hour
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	by which time i'll be home anyway
S0179	so
S0058	nice foil
S0179	yeah at most live there would save me five minutes
S0058	mm so actually i don't think i will if that's all the all the same to you
S0179	and the surround neighbourhood look like a shithole
S0179	and i know this cos i take the train through there every day
S0058	nice yeah they can't hide the true er reality from the commuters
S0179	indeed
S0058	quite busy on the twenty tonight
S0179	yes six miles sunderland
S0058	yay
S0179	oh dear
S0058	oh
S0179	this this bite of road be really
S0058	mm
S0179	bore
S0058	yeah there's a rubbish tip to the leave here as we go past it
S0179	yay
S0058	well it use to be anyway i dunno if it still be
S0179	live it up tonight
S0058	oh yeah all the sight i love how we er we haven't see the cathedral we've see the rubbish tip
S0179	cathedral
S0058	durham cathedral
S0179	oh right
S0058	not sunderland cathedral
S0179	i be gonna say there isn't one
S0058	no there isn't no
S0179	and yet it be a city just
S0058	it's get a minster dunno if that make any difference
S0179	that sound very camp
S0058	do it
S0179	mincer
S0058	oh right i be gonna say how um i be gonna say it sound like minister so i get really confuse i think newcastle have a cathedral i think i sing in it
S0179	well it must do
S0058	yeah i i think i sing in it
S0179	mm
S0058	it might not have be a cathedral that might've be just a big church it be a while ago
S0179	so the original logic for place cathedrals be just where be there enough people we can screw over
S0058	yeah
S0179	to get enough money to build this thing
S0058	yeah
S0179	oo cities right er um
S0058	yeah
S0058	areas where there's already lot of people
S0179	sorry
S0058	areas where there's already lot of people it wasn't build a cathedral then they'd come flock round it it be er build the cathedral where the people be
S0179	well to some extent you get people make pilgrimages
S0058	mm
S0179	and just sort of not have any money to get home
S0179	i doubt that be a but
S0058	well you er er there would be a tourism industry like canterbury probably have a massive tourist industry in er medieval time
S0179	wow canterbury the place to be
S0058	well yeah
S0179	in fifteen hundred
S0058	apparently accord to chaucer no earlier than fifteen um but yeah they're all on the on the on the er on their jolly off to canterbury
S0179	on their jolly
S0058	jolly
S0179	oh right oh that's roundabout
S0179	i'm so glad that this bite of road be forty it's it's
S0058	yeah not twenty
S0179	this be the right speed for this road
S0058	yeah
S0179	yes indeed i can see that happen
S0058	yeah
S0179	there's er a bite of road on my work way to work that's a fifty there's no reason for it
S0058	random speed limit
S0179	it be conceivably at least to do with a section of road they haven't put as a fifty
S0179	fifty
S0058	yeah do you think they get the work experience kid to do the sign so they get it wrong
S0179	no i just think they're utterly retard
S0058	yep that also
S0179	the work experience kid'd be far too sensible
S0058	yeah the work experience kid would be worry about get it right and wrong instead of just speed restrictions on
S0179	that there be at some point an accident along there
S0058	yeah
S0179	but
S0058	maybe local pressure
S0179	but from who no one live along that section
S0058	well
S0179	i mean the only other logic i can see be that there's a pub on that section but it's get a really visible entrance way
S0058	mm
S0179	so that's hardly an issue and the only other possible logic could be that if you drop to a fifty then to a forty you're more likely to obey the forty through the village but
S0058	no er
S0179	i'd have think a speed camera would've do that far more effectively
S0058	i be gonna say it's a little bite kind of er ridiculous bite excessive
S0179	mm but to be honest er it's generally sufficiently busy such that if you obey the fifty and then you catch up with traffic ahead of you anyway
S0058	mm
S0179	so doesn't make a huge difference
S0058	mm
S0179	uh this house be
S0058	oh really i've never really notice it before
S0179	location's not brilliant
S0058	no
S0179	as in where you live be er quite nice cos it's feasible to walk into the centre
S0058	yeah here you
S0179	not so much
S0058	no and it's a bite of a er a nowhere place you're right next to mcdonald's and the station but not an awful lot else
S0058	yeah you'd have to have er some like get a bike still nice look house
S0179	yeah yeah well
S0058	mm
S0179	oo it's a junction um forty
S0058	oh it's a nissan as well how embarrass
S0179	it's a nissan juke
S0058	do you see the er the newscast of them get all the extra job
S0179	yes
S0058	cos they're gonna build the next
S0179	excuse me
S0058	in er
S0179	forty understand four zero straight over the road be zero traffic i'm assume that some of those light be gonna change
S0058	mm yeah
S0058	they be just rubbish
S0179	oh get it well do
S0179	oh dear i should be more tolerant it's just be quite a long drive
S0058	yeah no
S0179	that's just be a short drive distance but nonetheless
S0058	it's go very quick hasn't it
S0179	yeah eerily so
S0058	yeah
S0179	oo thank heavens right right go off the line first
S0058	you don't think this juke'll be speedy
S0179	well not if there's a car in front of us no
S0179	and this car's very quick from standstill
S0058	hm ah good lyric
S0179	sorry
S0058	good lyric
S0179	that be say damn it
S0058	damn it
S0179	bollocks
S0058	there you be the juke's nippy off the line
S0179	well it's four wheel drive
S0058	mm
S0179	and it's probably an automatic
S0179	so between the two that will help er you see i er i er it be fast at nought to ten i be er fast at twenty
S0179	ten to thirty
S0058	yeah oh
S0179	we're still move
S0179	i think so not that hungry either
S0058	i'm not starve no
S0179	probably have should have something or we'll feel very bad in the morning
S0058	no er i agree we should have something we'll we'll wake up in the middle of the night but we can er
S0179	no that's not gonna happen
S0179	so there's an interest tip here i'm not bother to brake to keep the speed to thirty cos we're only go a bite above er and it's just inefficient to
S0058	mm
S0179	do so so i i do generally speak i'll accept a slight violation of the speed limit for the sake of efficiency if it's reasonably safe
S0058	mm yeah if there's nothing else for quite some distance
S0179	yeah uh
S0058	uh
S0179	what
S0058	stiff back
S0179	my back's not too bad actually
S0058	no cool oh mine's er it be stiff at work actually i think it's probably that as well
S0179	okay wow that's good time so i think
S0058	mm
S0179	we're good that's a nice medium distance isn't it
S0058	yeah i think you're good there cool
