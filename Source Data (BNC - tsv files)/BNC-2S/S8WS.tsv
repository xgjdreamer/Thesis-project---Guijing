S0456	okay contact them and say you're not happy well as i say i i'll i'll ask because even even if i'm not here obviously i don't want something like that next door to an empty house or even if i find someone
S0460	well the first thing he's gonna do be rob everybody isn't he if he's get a rottweiler like gotta keep it in the luxury it's use to haven't you you can't fee it people's legs all the while like can you
