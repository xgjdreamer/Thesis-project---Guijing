S0084	nice
S0041	and he say oh what type of gig be it i say some indie rock something or other i doubt i'll be able to keep up drink for drink with a soldier
S0084	nice
S0041	but the view should be good from his shoulder
S0084	huh
S0041	you win some you lose some
S0084	nice
S0041	yeah and he be like yeah yeah you're right that should be that should be good fun um the way the training's go you'll be able to get him on your shoulder
S0041	and i be like
S0084	oh that's funny
S0041	no way he's a guy either way he'll have to practise cos i'll need carry home
S0084	oh nice
S0041	mm i say hope you've get a nice weekend plan end of story you know yeah nice weekend plan gemma's come um nothing really plan just relax cos work's really stressful and i say um though i should probably shouldn't oh sorry to hear that um look at that fun fill weekend for grandad sound about right lol
S0084	mm
S0041	as in you're not do anything
S0084	sound shit yeah
S0041	that sound shit
S0084	mm
S0041	um be there anything i can do i know there wasn't but i just think well i don't want him to think that i'm end the message on a sour note
S0084	mm
S0041	as if it be a dig
S0084	mm which it be
S0041	and he be like no not really um thank for the offer though um yeah definite grandad lol um i say okay well you know where i be hope you have a nice week and weekend and he put yeah you too
S0084	mm
S0041	so that be the end of conversation but i think to myself i know this make me sound a bite no i think it's normal she's come all this way and he's not even take her out for dinner and they're this'll be about date number eight six
S0084	mm
S0041	not a long they've you know they've not meet up a lot of time
S0084	mm mm
S0041	would you travel four hours to see someone and then just sit in their
S0084	sit in
S0041	live room with their housemate
S0084	no well no because if you would you would say well we've only be to cambridge once or however many time she's be here
S0041	once
S0084	once she's be here once
S0041	i think this i think this be visit number two
S0084	yeah so in that case what be there to see and do this time we do this this and this how about we go here or i've be on the website and look at this
S0041	or
S0084	yeah i've look at what's on and there's a gig here or you know
S0041	mm
S0084	there's a night out or there's a movie or
S0041	and when he go up there the only thing they seem to do be go to the student union where she work
S0084	mm
S0041	cos she can get ticket
S0084	sound quite a bore existence really
S0041	doesn't it
S0084	but maybe that's what they both
S0041	want
S0084	want
S0041	mm
S0084	but i i don't think long term that that's what's gonna keep interest it might be what he want right now because his job quite stressful and it's very easy
S0041	and he doesn't have to
S0084	it's easy with her
S0041	try with her he just get to snog her and shag her
S0084	yeah exactly she's not put up a a need for him to woo her
S0041	mm mm
S0084	he's she's not demand that
S0041	which sound mental to me like then the it's not like they have a friendship and then
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	bam
S0084	there's nothing there
S0041	no
S0084	to go straight into be old couple
S0041	grannies yeah like you want the excitement for the first few months at least
S0084	mm
S0041	you want the fun date and
S0084	yeah the butterfly
S0041	yeah
S0084	mm
S0041	and like a couple of time you know to just stay in the house be fine but that's all they ever do
S0084	yeah
S0041	and i think well more fool her cos i tell you what if i travel for one if i would ever travel four hours to see a guy
S0084	mm
S0041	ever i must seriously like him and two if i get there and he didn't spoil me to death it'd be the last time i go
S0084	yeah game over
S0041	yeah
S0084	game over
S0041	game over yeah definite fact
S0084	maybe she's get nothing to compare it to
S0041	she's twenty six she must have something to compare it to
S0084	well she's not
S0041	mm
S0084	the prize turkey in the box
S0041	mm get that get that
S0084	or whatever that be
S0041	yeah
S0084	um
S0041	yes maybe not
S0084	yes do seem a bite weird mm curiouser and curiouser so what be you do tomorrow night
S0041	yes er go for a run
S0084	go for a run
S0041	yeah
S0084	in the in the gym
S0041	no on the outside
S0084	external ooh
S0041	yep on the outside
S0084	ooh
S0041	in the outside world i'm do that again
S0084	well i can give a text and see if he's free for a a solo a duo run
S0041	that'll be awesome
S0084	what time be you work till five or or four
S0041	er four four
S0084	okay
S0041	if he's not it's okay i'll still go anyway he can
S0084	mm
S0041	come another time
S0084	mm
S0041	um but yeah i'm just gonna do the same route again
S0084	mhm
S0041	and see if i can maybe slow my pace down a bite so i can keep it up rather than
S0084	mm
S0041	stop
S0084	mm well that sound good
S0041	um
S0084	um i'll ask him if he's get his pedometer as well cos then you could work out how far you're go
S0041	i think
S0084	you need one of those like what do we have at school with the little circle the yard
S0041	oh
S0084	the yard
S0041	trundle wheel
S0084	the trundle wheel
S0041	the trundle wheel
S0084	that's what you need you'll have to go to staple and get a trundle wheel
S0084	you would look like a a really special person
S0041	yeah i would yeah
S0084	in fact er they might actually arrest you
S0084	take you to the mental home i'm just measure the route
S0041	yeah i'm just measure my route attach round my waist to the belt like a tail
S0084	sound good
S0041	yeah
S0084	that's a really good look for you
S0041	but i be think i might've do it in seventeen minutes you know cos that's two minutes over my well a minute and a half over my best time which seem extreme but
S0084	but not
S0041	when i on the treadmill
S0084	mm
S0041	i start off pretty slow cos i control my breathe whereas here i get nought point five miles cos i remember where it be where i first have to stop
S0084	mhm
S0041	and clock the road and i get back and go on google and i'd only go nought point five miles before i be out of breath
S0084	mm
S0041	so maybe i just hammer it a bite too much but i just can't control it
S0084	it's more it's more difficult to do that isn't it
S0041	mm
S0084	it be it be tougher i think when you're outdoors
S0041	so but it's fine i'm just gonna keep go and keep try until i get to the time where i go round and i don't have to stop
S0084	mm mm well yeah
S0041	it'll get that
S0084	and that's all you can do and you're but the thing be the good thing be about it do it regularly be you do see an improvement you know
S0041	mm
S0084	you have do
S0041	yeah
S0084	you've be run
S0041	and a plus as well be that that's two miles and when i go for the two day thing it's still only gonna be one point five
S0084	nice
S0041	well it's well it's two point two but i walk down the street so we'll say two miles
S0084	mm
S0041	so at least i'll i'll have an idea in my head of
S0084	mm
S0041	the the distance
S0084	be that what they're gonna make you do be you gonna run outside or on the treadmill
S0041	when i do my fitness test
S0084	yeah
S0041	my first one that'll just be in the on the treadmill fine
S0084	yeah
S0041	job's a good 'un but then when i go down for the two day death
S0084	two day death
S0041	which er obviously be its official name two day death
S0084	as it's know in the business
S0041	yeah it will be outside in a massive group of people include lads and like eighteen year olds
S0084	mm
S0041	that be gonna ace it
S0084	hmm yeah well
S0041	and the thing that i don't get be they give you that table of the different age bracket
S0084	yeah
S0041	if you're over twenty six you can't apply so what they're give me time for forty year olds for i don't know
S0084	be that be that not that's for officer then it's not for for rat
S0041	it's for everybody yeah
S0084	yeah so if you you can be any age and um apply to go on rat can't you
S0041	no don't think so
S0084	i think it be just officer who have to be under twenty six
S0041	oh maybe
S0084	i dunno
S0041	my friend be say he be look to join and then he didn't cos he be too old and he's twenty eight so
S0084	have he get a degree
S0041	yeah ah maybe that's why
S0084	i think it's officer there's a cut off but i think if you're any old cannon fodder they'll take you
S0041	that's probably quite probably true
S0084	and what you've gotta remember about all those eighteen year olds that you see they be the cannon fodder
S0041	yeah
S0084	and they're not the ones who've get the brain cells so they might look fit they might run quite quickly but they'll you know
S0041	that's it
S0084	that's it game over that's all they've get to contribute
S0041	yeah
S0084	can be thick as two short plank
S0041	i mean i be think about it logically and if you get there with a really positive attitude really give it everything
S0084	mm
S0041	even if you're not quite cut the mustard or you're come bottom of the class they want to see that you're a that you're a really motivate determinate person
S0084	that you're passionate about it yeah
S0041	yeah rather than superman
S0084	yeah or that you're just gonna give up oh well i can't do it
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know you're try
S0041	so you know even if even if i go there and i struggle as long as i throw myself into it
S0084	mm
S0041	full for two days then
S0084	that's all they can ask for
S0041	yeah
S0041	cos they say that you know you don't have to be super super fit cos once you're here once you start your train that's what we're here to do
S0084	mm
S0041	and i watch this video on their their train
S0084	yeah
S0041	and the guy say you know when when people come here some people really struggle and it's fine cos it's not about a pass or fail ten ten week course
S0084	okay
S0041	it's our job to get you fit no matter what level you're at
S0084	oh see that there you go well that's quite encourage then
S0041	yeah so they weren't they be basically say like if you're not fit enough we've not do our job properly
S0084	yeah
S0041	if you're by the twelve weeks by the end of the twelve weeks if you're not fit enough it's our problem
S0084	nice that's well that's the attitude
S0041	so
S0084	i think i tell you wasn't it my drive instructor be like that
S0041	yeah
S0084	he really felt responsible for the people he be teach he really felt like if they weren't get it it be his fault because it mean that he wasn't teach them correctly it mean that he wasn't teach them so that they could understand cos once you've get a teacher who explain something you're like well why don't you just say it like that in the first place
S0041	yeah
S0084	it's really clear now bosh bosh bosh so yeah i mean really if you be gonna teach then that's really
S0041	mm
S0084	that's really the attitude you should have
S0041	mm
S0084	and that and that's encourage as well cos it mean that it's not like a a hard and fast rule like you be to do
S0041	yeah
S0084	this or you're out you know
S0041	yeah
S0084	they'll take a lot of things into consideration which i guess be why you have so many hoop to jump through they'll take it all into account
S0041	mm
S0084	which be quite good in a way
S0041	yeah it be quite good cos i be say to my dad like when i go down there at least the thing that i struggle with be the fitness which be something that you're able to coach yourself to do
S0084	mm
S0041	whereas people that find it difficult to think strategically
S0084	mm
S0041	it it must be difficult to to teach yourself that i'm i'm sure that must be a skill that either be good at or you're not good at
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	unless you can find someone to give you er problems to work to work through
S0084	mm
S0041	whereas at least that bite i know i can already do
S0084	yeah
S0041	and the fitness thing's something quite hand on that you can physically kinda change
S0084	mm mm
S0041	so i'd rather
S0084	yeah
S0041	just have that to worry about than
S0084	yeah that's something you can quite easily remedy in those ten weeks because you're gonna be do you'll be work out every single day
S0041	yeah
S0084	it's gonna be a fuck killer
S0041	ain't it gonna be a killer
S0084	but you be gonna be a machine really
S0041	yeah i be really excite for the end of it
S0084	crack peanuts in your butt cheek
S0041	yes imagine how fit i'm gonna be at the end of it
S0084	you're gonna be unbelievably rip
S0041	yep and then i'm gonna have a pass out we'll have to go and celebrate
S0084	oh amaze be you gonna be at dartmouth
S0041	i'm allow to come home to celebrate aren't i
S0084	yeah but but dartmouth actually be lovely it's beautiful
S0041	oh be it
S0084	really nice yeah
S0041	oh well you can come to dartmouth then
S0084	yeah no it's really really nice
S0041	okay
S0084	and they have well they have a ball they you know where you have like
S0041	ball
S0084	nice dress the when you have the pass out the boys
S0041	huh

S0041	i get to wear a dress
S0084	well i guess you wear your navy uniform
S0041	get a new oh damn it oh frig
S0084	well only because when 's brother have his pass out last year and he's in the navy obviously he wear his whatever they call it
S0041	oh but it's
S0084	posh stuff
S0041	oh no but er
S0084	but the girls stuff probably be really ugly
S0041	yeah
S0084	but i don't know i don't know if you have to wear it or whether the boys think this be really nice i'll wear this rather than buy a suit
S0041	mm
S0084	whereas if you're a girl you're gonna wanna wear a dress
S0041	dress yeah oh at least if they give me a dress like a navy dress i'll take that on board
S0084	yeah
S0041	don't fancy wear like trousers and shirt though to be fair
S0084	no i imagine it be
S0041	and a hat
S0084	some sort of dress oh the hat
S0041	no
S0084	hat's not okay but the even dress be nice like it's it's black with like red trim the boys like and obviously they've get their little waistcoat and
S0041	oh
S0084	and it's pretty swish but i didn't see any girl well er apart from their date
S0041	yeah
S0084	obviously they be wear lovely dress
S0041	damn it if i have to go and all the other girls get to wear hot dress and i have to wear those suit i'm gonna be piss
S0084	i'm gonna laugh in your face
S0084	i'm just put it out there it's it's gonna be me like you know and my jealousy
S0041	yeah
S0084	cos you'll have a rip body
S0041	if if that be the case i'm just gonna parade around in my short and nothing else
S0084	do it do it
S0041	that's what i'll do
S0084	that's probably what you will

S0084	what when you're on the ship
S0041	yes
S0084	i don't know if you can take all the shoe and really would you need to cos i don't think the sex shoe be really gonna be necessary on the ship because that might actually kill you imagine like tiny little galley ways and like those tiny little
S0041	mm heel
S0084	circular stairs

S0084	you will die er and you might fall on someone's head and impale them with your heel

S0084	right and
S0041	i say to my dad i need to get an answer to this question cos the first thing people say when they find out be why do you want to join the navy
S0084	mm
S0041	and all i can reply be shit and giggle
S0084	yeah
S0041	there be no logic
S0084	well i mean
S0041	i just wanna do it
S0084	challenge career progression you know be part of a team
S0041	i think it's the team thing i like
S0084	yeah
S0041	like none of these shitty people stab each other in the back and get one up on each other when actually they're shit at life and you could wipe the floor with them
S0084	right yeah
S0041	i hate i hate i hate it the people that be like the leos that nitpick i hate that like you can get
S0084	yeah
S0041	more do if everyone just work together
S0084	absolutely
S0041	but apparently
S0084	well i guess your problem be you're gonna find that in any anywhere you work anything you do you be gonna find people like that it it's it's learn to deal with those people i suppose
S0041	mm
S0084	you know obviously
S0041	we could push them overboard
S0084	you want to boil their head
S0041	boil their head and push them overboard
S0084	i think if you work in the navy you probably can actually just go round boil people's head i mean there probably be some like decree that you're allow
S0041	yeah
S0084	to do that so
S0041	i think that's probably allow
S0084	that's probably fine there probably be actually some law some isn't there you know that there's the law that you can use a bow and arrow on people in york on the first sunday of the month
S0041	oh yeah on the if they're on the bridge something or other
S0084	yeah
S0041	yeah something ridiculous
S0084	so there probably be some sort of law that say you can actually boil someone's head if they're a tool and i think leo definitely qualify for that
S0041	yeah yeah i think that's fair i think that's
S0084	tool status
S0041	i think that's fair yeah oh yeah the er tut
S0084	oh dear
S0041	the airport thing so
