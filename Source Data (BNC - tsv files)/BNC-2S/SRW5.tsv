S0420	just him yeah no no and he he's at leisure and
S0364	yeah
S0420	okay it's the hemingway theme but even that seem a bite tenuous at some point
S0364	yeah yeah i i find it interest cos i didn't know much that much about hemingway so
S0420	alright
S0364	find it really interest to find out i didn't realise he be so well travel and that he'd be so many place and you know fight in the war and and all that and i be like i really enjoy it
S0420	yeah yeah yeah
S0364	i mean
S0420	it's good
S0364	you know his i hadn't really put it all together his time in spain and cuba france
S0420	yeah
S0364	didn't even know he'd be to france to be honest
S0420	no the bite in i i i i quite like the bite in florida

S0364	yeah hadn't really think of that hadn't really think of that
S0420	erm and it's it's really richly caribbean it's not
S0364	mm mm
S0420	really
S0364	yeah
S0420	yeah america as you think of it erm
S0364	no no
S0420	it seem just a bite marginalise and a bite kind of forget about
S0364	yes
S0420	i dunno if it still be or maybe it's be redevelop since they do cos it's it's
S0364	yeah
S0420	like fifteen years old that book isn't it
S0364	but maybe that's what he like though eh because then when he go to visit montana in the end it be just middle of nowhere
S0420	bite too bite too mainstream as well though aye
S0364	middle of nowhere stuff you know so yeah no it be good good i enjoy it i i've read er most of them i've only get two two of them to read the himalaya and sahara
S0420	yeah both i like both of them
S0364	not read
S0420	like i say about sahara with it be in my old er
S0364	yeah of course
S0420	on my old haunt in tunisia
S0364	of course i've see a bite of the tv show cos they be couple of the more recent ones
S0420	well he's on when he's in tunis that's that's my old train to work
S0364	right i'll remember that i'll remember that
S0420	and erm what be the other one himalaya's very very good just cos you get
S0364	aha
S0420	such a mix of culture go from
S0364	yeah
S0420	he's i think he start in afghanistan
S0364	right
S0420	then he start to rise in the hindu kush and stuff like that
S0364	aha right
S0420	and then he end in bangladesh doesn't he like in the in the basin
S0364	ah sound good
S0420	er the bay of bengal or something isn't it
S0364	right okay
S0420	so er aye that's that's very very good
S0364	i look forward to that one yeah yeah
S0420	er have have you see the tv series
S0364	not well not for those two but for the for the book i've read i have apart from hemingway i've not not see that but all the other book that i've read i've always watch the tv show around the same time or after
S0420	i'd strongly i strongly recommend er
S0364	mm mm
S0420	the himalaya one just cos it's i dunno it's in so many different culture but
S0364	mm
S0420	and
S0364	right
S0420	you think of it as a short cut well it's just a mountain range but it's not really it's like a massive
S0364	yeah huge
S0420	thing er
S0364	like sahara i guess
S0420	i don't think he go to bhutan in that
S0364	oh right
S0420	cos bhutan would be a good one to see but i or maybe he do i i don't know
S0364	maybe it's close off
S0420	well it be they they when erm when i be at primary school we have a teacher
S0364	aha
S0420	who'd be in bhutan
S0364	mm mm
S0420	and i remember like nobody at the time have that idea and
S0364	right
S0420	of course he come in and give a presentation about it and then he over as primary teacher or something
S0364	oh what be that an exchange idea
S0420	no no he he be scottish
S0364	right aha
S0420	but he'd live in bhutan for a year
S0364	right
S0420	and erm they only issue or at the time they only issue two hundred and fifty tourist visa a year
S0364	jesus
S0420	cos there be that big controversy i think when prince charles take his entourage and like
S0364	and that be it for the year
S0420	well they kind of extend it but
S0364	oh aye oh aye yes
S0420	but there be erm
S0364	i can imagine
S0420	but there be a i be read something about bhutan have like a model kind of modern asian town have be build in the middle of nowhere in the countryside so i dunno it's quite an interest place
S0364	right
S0420	i can't remember if the book cover it or not
S0364	oh that sound good
S0420	yeah
S0364	that sound good not like a not like the towns that they build in china
S0420	yeah yeah
S0364	for nothing
S0420	seriously yeah yeah just like sky scrapers
S0364	but then no
S0364	no one live in them
S0420	yeah
S0364	they have people sweep the streets and no one live in it
S0420	that that's that that's what happen on the edge of when i be there
S0364	right
S0420	where erm it be just like literally people sweep streets but it be like sweep the motorway
S0364	no no one there
S0420	beautiful flower
S0420	in in the central reservation
S0364	yeah
S0420	erm you know dusty streets the occasional car
S0364	yeah
S0420	go up and down car showrooms like and stuff like that you know there be i think there be seven car showrooms and like
S0364	yeah
S0420	within a three block radius or whatever but it be block grid system you know
S0364	right right
S0420	i dunno
S0364	but no one no one live there eh
S0420	well er
S0364	d'you think they can keep that up then because be it not be they not start to have some sort of difficulties now
S0420	i think that there's a i think there's a lot of corruption in the in the in the build industry which be what keep it go
S0364	mm mm mm mm
S0420	you know so
S0364	they've obviously get fantastic infrastructure eh but
S0420	yeah yeah
S0364	now now the erm now they're start to get a bite afraid aren't they
S0420	yeah i think it take time it take time doesn't it these things don't happen over two or three years
S0364	mm mm
S0420	they take five ten twenty to build up so who know
S0364	yeah yeah yeah
S0420	and then you've get the erm sorry go back to the palin book
S0364	yeah yeah
S0420	erm sahara's a good one himalaya's a good one
S0364	mm mm
S0420	i need to read that new europe cos that's the one i never
S0364	aye
S0420	get to see properly
S0364	that be good i read that when i be tour europe so he go to new europe aye it's effectively like central europe
S0420	eastern europe
S0364	yeah
S0420	central okay
S0364	yes place that be now part of i guess the european union yeah so like your hungarys
S0420	yeah
S0364	slovakia probably
S0420	romania croatia stuff like that
S0364	yeah yeah aye absolutely no interest interest
S0420	do you see any of those michael portillo train journey
S0364	i've see the odd one not the series but i've see the odd one yeah yeah he's quite good
S0420	when he go to europe
S0364	yeah yeah surprisingly good erm he's quite a quite a tv celebrity now actually isn't he
S0420	yeah yeah he's he's he's
S0364	but he's quite good at it so
S0420	get bite of panache
S0364	must be better that than he be at politics or be at politics see as he get oust
S0420	oust aye
S0364	yes
S0420	do he go back after that or be that him
S0364	er
S0420	cos he's be on that politics show for years
S0364	er i think he might've run again but not on the mm no maybe not maybe not erm but you know er yeah exactly cos he's just like a bite of a semi celebrity now isn't he
S0420	yeah yeah like those those program be very good cos be they go at a leisurely pace and just
S0364	yeah
S0420	i dunno almost almost sort of erm try to reminisce about a bygone era kind of thing
S0364	yes that's how palin start he do erm a couple of train journey show don't know if you've see those
S0420	he do er derry to kerry
S0364	aye he do a couple of them and presumably they like the idea
S0420	onto the onto the kyle of lochalsh or
S0364	yes
S0420	something like that
S0364	but then you say they want someone else to do the palin role first but he turn it down
S0420	it be originally gonna be alan whicker eh
S0364	right
S0420	and then it be another guy and he be third choice or fourth choice or
S0364	right
S0420	something like that er
S0364	it's amaze to think eh it could've be someone else
S0364	who know what would've happen so
S0420	no
S0364	it's fill a hole for him in his career anyway so it that's his kinda niche now eh a whole generation of people will think of him as that
S0420	yeah
S0364	cos i never saw him in his do his day job
S0420	do you have a look at the the do i give you that book of diaries
S0364	yeah yeah i've not read it yet it's on my
S0420	yeah
S0364	it's on my shelf i'm i'm struggle through a edinburgh history book at the moment which be which be good but it's erm dense history book tend to be eh erm but very interest
S0420	well this be it you gotta take the time to digest it all eh
S0364	aye aye it's worth it i try and do i try and read like a fiction book and then a non fiction so i mix it up bite of fun and then learn something you know so i'll read something much lighter next time but no the palin book be the palin book be good erm so like a bite of football book as well of course
S0420	yeah well you give me that one on saturday but
S0364	yeah yeah
S0420	erm i'm i'm i'm battle my way through a book on the kindle at the moment
S0364	what book's that
S0420	erm modern buddhism
S0364	ah you gonna be a buddha a buddhist
S0420	yeah
S0364	you're gonna become a buddhist
S0420	mm
S0364	be that not quite full on
S0420	yeah
S0364	you're like give up drink and food and stuff
S0420	well not all food
S0364	not all food
S0420	i've kinda become semi vegetarian eh
S0364	semi vegetarian wow
S0420	like i i wouldn't erm i wouldn't buy meat if it wasn't for the kid
S0364	mm mm you wouldn't buy meat for yourself
S0420	maybe maybe once a week or something yeah but like erm i don't know
S0364	someone at work saw the salad i be eat and say where's the meat how can you eat it without the meat
S0420	er
S0364	so
S0420	i don't miss it eh
S0364	well you probably don't need it to be honest in the modern world eh so
S0420	no you get enough nutrients elsewhere as long as you're eat egg and
S0364	yeah yeah
S0420	get the protein and stuff
S0364	well aye that's what i have if i have a salad i have a boil egg erm chop up
S0420	chop up
S0364	chop up bite of tomato bite of egg cucumber bite of bean
S0420	yeah i find fish more difficult to give up than meat
S0364	oh really how so
S0420	i just prefer the taste eh
S0420	like i dunno like after you eat meat you feel quite heavy don't you like
S0364	mm
S0420	if if you have a steak i mean
S0364	mm mm
S0420	erm but if if you eat fish
S0364	mm isn't that full though i mean if you don't feel full
S0420	aye but you don't have to eat until you're heavy
S0364	yeah
S0420	there's a difference isn't there
S0364	aye absolutely
S0420	you could probably finish
S0364	absolutely
S0420	like most meals you could probably stop three quarter of the way through but like no good if you're hungry
S0364	i'm fine yeah yeah aye
S0420	there's always that thing it's it's on my plate
S0364	yeah i better eat it oh i do that tonight i probably didn't need to eat as much as i do pasta and a bite of focaccia but i think oh well
S0420	it's there
S0364	i'll finish it yeah yeah
S0420	yeah i think
S0364	yeah
S0420	there's a lot of that erm
S0364	it's a difference when i go to my in laws for dinner because they cos you tend to serve yourself you can be a bite more sensible in your portion cos you it all just get lay out on the table
S0420	it's up to you
S0364	you take what you want so if you want more meat you have it if you want less meat
S0420	aye so it's that thing if it's like choose how much meat you're take you don't wanna eat like and
S0364	yeah yeah yeah
S0420	and take too much
S0364	feed us like pasta carbonara as a first course before the main which be meat we be all fool by the main course cos carbonara
S0364	yeah yeah
S0420	especially doesn't matter even if you just have like a wee a wee amount
S0364	yeah yeah
S0420	it's just heavy cos of the cream and bacon and stuff
S0364	yeah yeah put egg in it as well
S0420	yeah
S0364	so we be all like and i be full after that didn't have much you know so we all all get get it to take home with us
S0420	ah it's alright take you two days
S0364	yes aye two or three days probably yeah so
S0420	no erm
S0364	dunno if i could give up meat
S0420	i've find it quite easy yeah
S0364	good on you though
S0420	and erm the the book the book itself be be very good i like erm i like read about it from the modern angle have sort of some ancient scripture or something
S0364	yeah yeah 's get a friend who be big into it she's erm she's into buddhism and i think it's buddhism but she's all into meditation and
S0420	yeah
S0364	and all that
S0420	yeah
S0364	all that malarkey
S0420	but it do work it do
S0364	surely it require discipline
S0420	yeah and erm you cannot just say i've have a bad day i'm not gonna do it today
S0364	i'm not gonna be a buddhist
S0420	yeah so
S0364	that's like go to the gym you have a bad day you just don't go
S0420	yeah i dunno it it it start to make sense i i like it and erm
S0364	yeah yeah and be join you in that quest
S0420	well she's consider it
S0364	cos can you both can you can one of you be a buddhist and the other one not or
S0420	yeah yeah mm
S0364	d'you reckon
S0420	i think she she find it more difficult not to kill mosquitoes when we're in china but
S0364	oh really so you try not to kill animals but could you like
S0420	but i've be do that for a long time as i've like erm
S0364	yeah
S0420	like erm
S0364	yeah
S0420	i learn that from when i be in spain
S0364	yeah yeah
S0420	he erm well he didn't kill the mosquitoes in spain which
S0364	yeah
S0420	you know be a pain
S0364	but be you be you allow to like not like other football team and their fan or do you have to like love them as well
S0420	you can try you just try and get rid of negative thoughts yeah
S0364	really
S0420	that's that's
S0364	but
S0420	on a practical level there be some things you can work on
S0364	but you love your own team
S0364	love your own team though what if you don't you can still surely you still dislike other team no with a passion
S0420	yeah that that that's fair enough but i mean that that's different as long as you control it within that
S0364	yeah yeah i'm all for try to be more positive about about your own team than negative about others but
S0420	i dunno we'll see but yeah i see that that that
S0364	all all positive thoughts so that's what it's all about
S0364	someone's annoy you at work or at home you have to just be like why be they annoy me you know look at it from their point of view
S0420	yeah
S0364	that sort of thing
S0420	but that that that's not just a buddhist thing that's that's a
S0364	mm
S0420	that's a good attitude in general isn't it walk
S0364	yeah yeah
S0420	a mile in the other person's shoe
S0364	get on with it
S0420	and then you're a mile away and you've get their shoe you know
S0364	yeah yeah yeah aye i know yeah exactly i like it
S0420	so so
S0420	we'll see what happen
S0364	aye interest though
S0420	er so that's the book i'm read at the moment eh so
S0364	right
S0420	i haven't be able to pick up that scottish football one
S0364	yeah yeah oh well you'll fly through that you'll fly through the scottish football book
S0420	yeah the buddhism one's quite a heavy one eh it's over a thousand page
S0364	how long will that take you to read then
S0420	i'm about well i've be i've get three four hundred in under a week so
S0364	get plenty of time to read in a week
S0420	no it's just i go to bed and i try
S0364	right
S0420	and fire through with it cos
S0364	right
S0420	this new job it's be easier to
S0364	right
S0420	cos i don't have to prepare lessons or anything so
S0364	ah right right aye i see what you mean see what you mean yeah yeah i just find by the time it get to ten o'clock half ten i'm knackered eh so i read like three page
S0420	ah my eye start to get heavy after after a few page aye
S0420	and quite often i'll i'll i'll i'll fall asleep with a book or a kindle in my face
S0364	yeah yeah
S0420	and then wake up and try and carry on from
S0364	don't know where you don't know where you be yeah yeah
S0420	yeah
S0364	no i know that feel
S0420	i don't i don't like the new touchscreen kindle eh i i miss my old one
S0364	oh really
S0420	ah
S0364	ah what be there button at the side
S0420	yeah
S0364	that's what i've get the button at the side
S0420	i prefer that one eh that one break
S0364	right
S0420	when i be in spain last year
S0364	aye
S0420	erm i i really don't i really don't like the new one cos you can be hold it and accidentally turn the page whereas you can never really accidentally turn
S0364	the old one aye yeah yeah you you can press it the wrong way by mistake yeah that's kind of all you can do isn't it
S0420	whereas with the touchscreen and there's
S0364	aye
S0420	different gesture on the screen so if you swipe
S0364	right
S0420	to the leave or tap it
S0364	yeah
S0420	or if you're touch the top third of the screen different things happen so
S0364	so it's usual they try and make something modern and helpful and yeah yeah
S0420	well it's it it's probably sleeker eh but i do prefer the old one
S0364	there's unintended consequences yeah yeah yeah
S0420	so that's e book
S0364	aye no no interest
S0420	i i dunno swear by his kobo doesn't he
S0364	well it's the same thing isn't it but just
S0420	different brand
S0364	a different
S0420	but yeah access to a different store isn't it
S0364	yes i don't even know what their store i don't even know who do kobo be it
S0420	they're they're they're push by whsmith so
S0364	right yeah cos i notice in waterstones the other week they have kindle
S0420	yeah
S0364	so they've just throw their lot behind they've just think might as well jump into bed with the devil eh
S0420	make sense though eh if you can't beat them
S0364	yeah so they must make they must make a better retailer margin on the the kindle but it's that interest one cos you think they would be steal erm waterstones market but
S0420	yeah but they must know that if they can sell if they can sell a device i i dunno i don't
S0364	do you hear they the kindle's like sell hardly any at christmas time or
S0420	mm
S0364	they have their worst year like
S0420	what the the e reader or the tablet
S0364	in age just just kindle erm probably the e reader they're say it's just reach like
S0420	saturation
S0364	the point where well aye what they're say be people aren't replace them interestingly you make that point about your older one be better people
S0420	yeah
S0364	aren't feel the need to upgrade to the latest e reader
S0420	no it's the it's not like a an ipad or something which get faster i mean there's only so many things that a book can do and certainly i would never have dream like i it take me take me about nine no it take me over a year to replace it cos it
S0364	yeah
S0420	break when i first move to
S0364	mm mm
S0420	so like about fourteen months
S0364	mm mm
S0420	between me break that one and get a new one and it be only because i couldn't think of anything else to get from my mum for christmas
S0364	right
S0420	say what d'you want what d'you want what d'you want
S0364	get that yeah so i think people aren't ah better get the latest model
S0420	no cos it make no
S0364	i mean i don't even
S0420	make no difference
S0364	i don't even know if you transfer your book over
S0420	yeah
S0364	no idea
S0420	yeah all all the same book be available
S0364	right so if i've get if they're on my account
S0420	yeah
S0364	i get the a new kindle all the book be there again
S0420	yeah yeah
S0364	right
S0420	yeah they're in the cloud and you just download them as as
S0364	so they're aye so they're mine so i'm buy the i'm buy the copy on whatever device
S0420	yeah
S0420	er in the same way that you can download the app to a phone and you can get the same book
S0420	i mean ipad or your desktop
S0364	of course of course aye yeah i quite often
S0364	i quite often have it on if i'm just on a bus for like twenty minutes i'll sometimes dip into a book from my phone
S0420	yeah so that's that's
S0364	that i've not bring
S0420	yeah that's that's that's the idea be that
S0364	yeah yeah
S0420	it's a mobile library which actually work quite well
S0364	yeah yeah
S0420	in the modern world cos everybody's get a device at all time on different things
S0364	yeah yeah so i'm just struggle to get through my old paper book before i can move right onto kindle so i've still get tons of them but
S0420	yeah i like to vary it eh
S0364	yes aye
S0420	i don't think i'll ever lose that because you cannot share kindle book that's that's a problem
S0364	no you're right yeah yeah like that scottish football book pass it round people and and to take book from other people like that
S0420	mm i don't know maybe there be a system i dunno
S0364	well there's a lend library a kindle lend library that you
S0420	but i don't understand how that work
S0364	if you're an amazon prime you're a member of that
