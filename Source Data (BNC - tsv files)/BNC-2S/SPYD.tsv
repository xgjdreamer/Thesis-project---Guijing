S0529	it's the same sort of thing as this really like propaganda and rebellion and shit and they obviously don't like that
S0530	no yeah
S0529	and in china as well
S0530	oh god
S0529	because china's like that

S0530	oh just
S0529	in general like
S0530	yeah just in general
S0529	the tone of the film like and how it relate to what's happen at the moment but it's just scary that it's all real like you know
S0530	mm
S0529	it's not like you're read a book and that it's like oh my god this be actually what life be like at the moment quite scary
S0529	oh oh i just hate that they behead people it's just so terrify
S0530	that be what scar me like
S0529	behead no that's not
S0530	the men in the orange suit
S0529	natural to behead someone you know like it's just such a traditional like old
S0530	it's a medieval punishment isn't it
S0529	yeah it really be it be
S0530	you know it's not real like it's not humane
S0529	it isn't
S0530	and the way they just get their it's like samurai swords or whatever
S0529	mm yeah
S0530	and it's like ah
S0529	and they're proper machetes they've get
S0530	mm
S0529	it's just oh it's chill
S0530	it's horrendous can i put my phone on charge on your little
S0529	yeah
S0530	oh de de de oh
S0529	oh no it's be it's be go for longer than that actually
S0530	how long
S0529	it's say here two thousand and six
S0530	oh god
S0529	so that's almost ten years
S0530	wow but it's not really come into prominence until like
S0529	no
S0530	the in term of the public eye
S0529	no until recently
S0530	i don't think it's till recently people have start to get really afraid of it you know
S0529	mm well it's since they've start to behead journalists and
S0530	yeah exactly
S0529	that's really get people spook
S0530	i wouldn't ever go to syria
S0529	no
S0530	i wouldn't dare
S0529	i wouldn't yeah they're in control of similar to the size of the uk
S0530	wow that be scary
S0529	mm yeah it be
S0530	i mean do you think they can win potentially
S0529	erm
S0530	er
S0529	er
S0530	not that oh i just
S0529	i mean up until now like their tactics like the way they've be carry out these terror attack have be extremely successful you know like nobody have be catch well no they have be catch but after they've happen like after they've succeed in kill a whole bunch of people
S0530	mm
S0529	erm so they certainly know what they're do but i don't know the thing be it's gonna have to be like literally just drop bomb on them you know to to just stop it like there's no way for them to to
S0530	well they're not really give us another choice be they
S0529	no exactly they're not
S0530	cos they won't rationalise
S0529	gonna like repent or anything like that
S0530	and i guess it get to the point where it's like it's almost necessary
S0529	yeah
S0530	because it's kill the live of so many people that
S0529	it's such an emotional thing isn't it
S0530	that be gonna die
S0529	to save more live afterwards
S0530	mm
S0529	just like carry on
S0530	yeah i know it's a tough one
S0529	well then again it isn't because they're fuck murderers and like
S0529	they don't deserve
S0530	no they can't they can't
S0530	exactly they can't
S0529	or humanity
S0530	yeah
S0529	if they don't give any of that to other people or
S0530	and if war on war have to be the thing that be the last thing alternative
S0529	mm
S0530	you know you've gotta you've gotta do it haven't you but it's just such a mess
S0529	mm
S0530	how have it get to this point i don't understand
S0529	i mean i'd like to think that with everyone together like
S0530	yeah there's more of us
S0529	we'll be able to overcome that yeah
S0530	we outnumber
S0529	yeah
S0530	them but
S0529	mm and if we've get america as well
S0530	i mean how i know it sound silly but how do how would they have even think that they have a chance at the begin of it like it's like this be a whole country this be a whole like who have this sense of like believe that they're so big that they can overrule like
S0529	mm
S0530	like do they want be that their goal to like rule us all and just be like
S0529	mm
S0529	yeah that it'll be that sort of to their religion
S0530	because i'm sorry we're not have
S0529	and in fact they welcome conflict cos they see it as close to the erm apocalypse er prediction that's in the
S0530	oh
S0530	what so they see this as like the end kind of thing
S0529	mm mm
S0530	so they're not actually try to restore anything they're just like this we're gonna cause the end of the world
S0529	erm pretty much yeah
S0530	that doesn't make any fuck sense
S0529	no it doesn't
S0530	it's like we want you to be good and believe in our god like oh doesn't make any fuck sense
S0529	you just just wonder how many hostages they have in the areas they control
S0530	yeah do they keep load of people hostage or do they just kill them all i think they just kill them
S0529	i dunno
S0530	oh imagine if they take someone like i don't know barack obama hostage though
S0529	mm
S0530	what would happen
S0529	fuck know
S0530	or you know someone significant like can you imagine
S0529	mm
S0530	like say it wasn't like just a journalist
S0530	if they take the royal family hostage
S0529	yeah
S0530	i mean there'd be a huge uproar about that there's no way though they could like dominate the whole country like drop bomb everywhere
S0529	what in the uk
S0530	mm
S0529	well i dunno
S0530	i mean they could bomb the capital city or a city but they couldn't like go everywhere straightaway
S0529	why not
S0530	er not all at once right
S0529	well they've get how many have they get two hundred thousand people on their side
S0530	well
S0530	be that how many soldier or how many people support it
S0529	erm i don't really know but i mean consider the fact that they kind of have this attitude to it like where like the apocalypse so they're will to sacrifice themselves and they're will to be suicide bombers like you have in france so i dunno it's highly possible french president's call it an act of war as well it's just strange like you're you're literally gonna see this in the history book
S0530	you be
S0529	in however many years like the france attack and whatever come after this
S0530	god jesus christ i can't imagine what's gonna come after this
S0529	i dunno well i mean it's not get better
S0530	like i can't think about like study and shit now like what do it even matter
S0529	mm
S0530	what do it matter
S0529	i know
S0530	here i be like
S0529	you shouldn't let this like stop you from
S0530	no but it's just distract isn't it like
S0529	no it really be
S0530	it er inconvenience to my study how selfish be that but just like
S0529	mm
S0530	it's so like it everything just seem so trivial now doesn't it really
S0529	mm get rocket launchers fuck hell
S0530	i know so could they fire stuff at the uk now if they want to have they get enough of that kind of stuff
S0529	i don't know
S0530	cos it's just like oh it's scary
S0529	but can you just imagine how easy it would be for like an isis person to go into a tube erm with like a bomb belt and detonate it on the tube like there's no security in tube station like that
S0530	what in london
S0529	they'd have no way of know would they yeah in london
S0530	yeah
S0529	and then that could just spiral into what what's happen in france
S0530	god that would be terrify
S0529	mm i'd actually be so scar to use the tube
S0530	what you mean do it in the station or do it on the train
S0529	on the train
S0530	oh god
S0529	either way it's either way but i mean cos
S0530	that would be horrible
S0529	there's no security be there
S0530	no there isn't
S0529	there's just this turnstile and that's it
S0530	well nobody check you over yeah
S0529	yeah but it doesn't check you over do it
S0530	that's what i say
S0530	nobody check you over
S0529	no no
S0530	and that's what's gonna happen
S0529	i mean they probably have metal detectors but i don't know it's just gonna be like i don't think it would be impossible for them to do that
S0530	no
S0529	and they have people live here remember like they have accomplices all over the world i expect
S0530	yeah they do
S0529	it's the wealthiest militant group
S0530	really
S0529	mm
S0530	how do they get their money though fund by the
S0529	mostly private donors and islamic charities
S0530	oh my fuck god who be fuck donate to these fuck charities seriously like oh
S0529	several million dollars a week oh their oil that's what it be in the end it all come back to oil
S0530	it do
S0529	every time
S0530	oil
S0529	and the kidnap you know what they do when they bomb a sacred temple a couple of months ago they erm before they bomb it they steal all of the valuables inside and then bomb it to destroy the evidence of them do that and then
S0530	really
S0529	mm
S0530	that's why be their tactics so brutal
S0529	oh just where
S0530	it's that's there
S0529	oh
S0530	be that an article or oh yeah
S0529	it's just extra bite
S0530	it's just we don't nobody seek we seek to destroy islam
S0529	it's just so extreme you know like how can someone believe that so it's almost like they're i dunno like
S0530	they can't honestly believe
S0529	they're just mentally disturb or something
S0530	yeah
S0529	i don't wanna bring mental illness into it cos that's not fair but just to be able to think that way and be okay with it like with just kill people like i don't get it i don't like religion i really don't like when it cause problems like this it's just
S0530	i know i honestly the weird thing be though i didn't think we'd have a third world war in my lifetime like i didn't think it would happen because of the second world war and the first you know
S0529	mm no i mean it might not but i dunno just to me like all the shit that's go on and it seem like it be i suppose i mean cos it would cause panic just imagine it like if someone declare a world war it would just
S0530	spark
S0529	yeah
S0530	yeah
S0529	and everyone would be absolute hysterics and it would just not be you wouldn't be able to function or anything like this like you wonder whether they're kind of hold back from say that
S0530	just think if
S0529	that we're at war because they don't wanna create panic
S0530	do you think erm how many suicides er would if we be tell our country be at war
S0529	yeah
S0530	again
S0529	i mean but how many suicides be there in in the second world war and the first world war not
S0530	i think though with this generation i think everybody would just be like
S0529	yeah
S0530	that's it we're fuck
S0529	yeah yeah
S0530	basically erm cos i think everyone have see the uk as relatively safe up until this point
S0529	mm
S0530	maybe that's just me but i see it as a safeish place compare to most other place but now that's
S0529	no to be honest it's always it's always have a pretty high threat level just cos it's so like influential
S0530	mm
S0529	in the world
S0530	yeah
S0529	you know like england
S0530	mm
S0529	america those russia those sort of place
S0530	yeah
S0529	cos they're so rich i mean well we're a huge amount of debt but we be rich
S0530	mm we be rich once
S0529	we be
S0530	that be a long time ago but it happen once
S0529	mm
S0530	it's weird though cos when i imagine terrorism like our country be attack by terrorists i imagine like right now where where we be people come out of plan on ladder with gun ready to kill us all
S0529	mm
S0530	i mean it's just like oh god it's like that would be my worst like you know i i'd cry so much i mean it's just like
S0529	what would you do would you like play dead or you just let them kill you
S0530	i don't know i i couldn't i couldn't i wouldn't know i don't know how people act in these situations and how they survive it's just crazy
S0529	there be a thing on facebook about a girl who be in the concert hall
S0530	yes
S0529	and she like she lie down and play dead
S0530	the one with the
S0529	for an hour
S0530	she post a
S0529	mm yeah
S0530	her t shirt up or something yeah
S0529	yeah
S0530	that be incredible
S0529	i know
S0530	how do she because they be shoot people on the floor as well
S0529	mm
S0530	they weren't just yeah
S0529	yeah i mean there's there's no guarantee that you would like stay alive after that even if you do try and like play dead like cos people know that they do that now don't they i think i dunno i just don't think i'd have like the wits about me to do that
S0530	no
S0529	i probably would
S0530	you just freeze
S0529	be the first one that get shoot to be honest
S0530	in those situations
S0529	i'd just be just sort of yeah no but we we be relatively safe in
S0530	we're at that's a good about be in
S0529	so maybe don't go to
S0530	no yeah i've decide
S0529	i mean to be honest like be probably more dangerous than be at the moment because it's a port like a really busy port like we're we're the third largest natural harbour in the world erm so you get a lot of boat
S0530	yeah
S0529	and we're like near the sea and you know
S0530	they could come in to land just like yeah
S0529	's just kind of like you
S0530	they could come to
S0529	they could they could but it's i mean it's highly
S0530	that would be a pretty shit entrance wouldn't it
S0529	like it's highly unlikely
S0530	yeah
S0529	here cos i have no idea
S0530	mm
S0529	any more than you do i'm just kind of a negative person anyway life at the moment it feel like a very nasty situation
S0530	it feel very negative
S0529	and it do feel like an imminent threat because of what happen in paris
S0530	i mean i guess you could look at it in the way that like you know those bomb attack in london
S0529	mm
S0530	here we be how many years later and the world's not collapse even though things be pretty bad like we've not
S0529	yeah
S0530	not have our country take over by them
S0529	no
S0530	i think we're all yeah
S0529	no no i don't i don't think we would be overpower by islamic state
S0529	if they be to attack london or somewhere
S0530	mm i think oh i dunno like how would we control it we'd get people with gun and shit but that's
S0529	i mean england's too strong and we have too many ally and yeah it i don't think it would come to that
S0530	mm
S0529	and also like they like spontaneity and if they attack london straight after when we're expect them to attack us which we be now kind of like there will be a threat level thing and everyone will be aware that like
S0530	that's the thing
S0529	there's a high threat
S0530	we'll all be alert to it
S0529	yes exactly
S0530	so it's
S0529	so they're unlikely to do it now they would wanna do it when it's all die down like in like in paris like months and months after the first
S0530	cos nobody be expect that bloody hell
S0529	no exactly like nobody be expect it at all
S0530	and when you think friday the thirteenth you don't think paris do you
S0529	yeah i do wonder though
S0530	what friday the thirteenth
S0529	yeah to like be really
S0530	be that a thing over there
S0529	well
S0529	but i be wonder it could be
S0530	i mean they could know it be a thing over here
S0529	yeah
S0530	and try and scare the shit out of us
S0529	cos that be a lot of shit that happen on friday it wasn't just paris
S0530	yeah
S0529	like japan have a couple of earthquakes erm what be it beirut
S0530	oh why isn't it actually
S0530	he's never actually bump into us
S0530	no
S0529	because they're not religious like that oh jesus what's a caliphate
S0530	be that like another word for erm a group
S0529	mm could be oh god sicken like it's not difficult for them to gain followers
S0530	no because people be
S0529	people be so will to join up and it's just
S0530	why
S0529	mind boggle i don't know cos they find glory in it and i they think they're destroy enemies of islam and they be attract by the brutalist kind of erm methods which be like fairly worry
S0530	that be very worry
S0529	yeah
S0530	it's just scary isn't it
S0529	mm it's real oh him
S0530	abu bakr
S0529	yeah
S0530	al baghdadi
S0529	mm
S0530	yeah
S0529	see that's what they be exactly what they're gonna do the us i bet they're already out there with plan
S0530	yeah prepare for battle
S0529	yeah they're just run into it really aren't they like
S0530	like think about what you're do
S0529	jesus
S0530	but then i guess well you have to act but then
S0529	yeah
S0530	you just don't know what how to act so
S0529	they need to catch them they need to use mm mm
S0530	cos they're not all in the same place
S0529	no
S0530	i can imagine it's rather difficult
S0529	and there be so many of them like they need to kill the leader
S0530	yeah they do it's like when you defeat an ants' nest
S0529	mm
S0530	you need to kill the what be it not the queen bee
S0529	no that's be
S0530	that be yeah but there's like a erm a main ant as well
S0529	yeah there be
S0530	in an ant colony you need to kill the main one and then all the surround ones will
