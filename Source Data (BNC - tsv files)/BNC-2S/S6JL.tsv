S0529	mm
S0530	kinda thing like i wasn't really in the mood i be like i just want my tea
S0530	and my bed but yeah i go and i go to gender women's this morning we do about race racialisation and racism erm and then i have an english language lecture early afternoon like at two to three o'clock do some typey typey for my note like type up my note for english language and that be it really
S0529	cool that's good and productive
S0530	it be like i've get i've i'm nearly on track now with my lecture like i'm up to lecture six
S0529	mm
S0530	in term of type and and i'm on we're on week seven
S0529	mm
S0530	so i'll be able to do that tonight and then
S0529	yes
S0530	yeah i like your hat i i know i keep say but it's a nice hat
S0529	it's really cold i want to keep it on but out
S0530	er be you read
S0529	yeah
S0530	what
S0529	just
S0530	what
S0529	nothing like profound just read like book that i've read before so it's just more like comfort read
S0530	it's good though like
S0529	mm
S0530	read something
S0529	yeah i know i have like actually read it a lot of it like i've read all of that today
S0530	oh my god
S0529	so yeah i'm a fast reader when i wanna be i dunno it's not the same cos i've read it before then so it's easier to read i suppose but i dunno
S0530	mm
S0529	don't know it's yeah it's alright
S0530	it's it's a more productive day than just like sleep
S0529	yeah you could say that i suppose
S0530	i didn't nap today i'm very proud
S0529	well do yeah that's good
S0530	i'm gonna do this thing where i don't go on technology now before i go to sleep
S0529	yeah
S0530	i might listen to an audiobook
S0529	that's a good idea on your phone
S0530	yeah
S0529	yeah could do that
S0530	or read er cos i dunno cos i i dunno like i don't
S0529	reading's good like i and i felt like i sleep better
S0530	i don't mind yeah
S0529	even though it take me longer to get off to sleep
S0530	that's good
S0529	that's the only thing like
S0530	oh okay
S0529	it's weird like it seem like with technology it's actually easier for me to fall asleep just not wake up that make sense
S0530	it's quite weird because i know the
S0530	the light stimulate your brain but i though the brightness would make your eye hurt therefore
S0529	yeah
S0530	more tire
S0529	yeah that's what it feel like for me like i feel like i'm just die on it and then i actually go to sleep really quickly afterwards
S0530	mm exactly
S0529	but last night i read and then i be like right it's like twelve o'clock i should probably go to bed now and i be i be awake like three more hours just try to get off to sleep and couldn't so
S0530	isn't it weird that like technology what's on it doesn't literally exist as in like you can't touch it kind of thing
S0529	yeah it's weird
S0530	like obviously it exist because they're just sort of abstract
S0529	it be really it's weird thing
S0530	but like it do exist you can't yeah like if you're famous on the internet you it's like or to be famous at all really isn't real
S0530	god that's deep very deep
S0530	er
S0529	mm oh i just like i really hat like today i i just felt like i hat it
S0530	you hat everything
S0529	like the entire place i just hat it like when i be in town
S0530	oh do you go into town
S0529	when i be yeah cos i need to go shop erm and i get into town and i be just like oh my god i hate it here like it's just i just fuck hate it just er just go round town like think
S0530	fuck northern towns
S0529	think i hate this i just wanna leave and it be really funny like and then in the end i didn't even go to sainsbury's i just felt so sick of it so i just leave again
S0530	how long do you spend in
S0529	about forty minutes and then i just get the bus back and spend like two fifty on absolutely nothing which be great
S0530	yeah
S0529	and now i'm gonna have to go back into town probably tomorrow cos i'm run out of food no i mean i have run out of food i don't have anything to eat now i've just eat the last of my chicken nuggets
S0530	be the meatballs yours that be out or be they
S0529	they're not mine no must be 's
S0530	if you need anything you can just well i doubt i don't know if there's a
S0529	well that's not what i mean i'm just
S0530	no no seriously like
S0529	not very hungry anyway so it's fine
S0530	i know you cos you i don't know you you don't hint at things but you can use anything
S0530	you can use anything if you've run out of food
S0529	no that's fine that's fine no i just and also i'm just kinda like scar to spend money i mean it's get to that point where i'm just really scar that if i spend any more money i'm gonna have to pay it all back and it's really scary
S0530	we worry about money don't we
S0529	i know
S0530	it's
S0529	it's just it's i'm in overdraft again and it's like really it just make it ten time worse if i don't stay here then i'm gonna be in overdraft and that's terrify cos at least when i leave last year i have like money in my account that they didn't know about
S0530	you you have money in your bank account now
S0529	that i could use to pay them back like they didn't know it be it be their money i be pay them back with
S0530	oh really
S0529	yeah say i be just generally like give them back the money that be theirs anyway
S0530	oh god
S0529	but they didn't particularly know that cos it be in a different account but this this time i wouldn't have that i would have zero money
S0530	oh wow
S0529	well not zero money i would have like minus zero money
S0529	and it's just really scary so i really didn't wanna go shop
S0530	you could just have something i'm think like where be easy shop
S0529	the rest of my life
S0530	what become a bank robber
S0529	no i don't know yeah
S0530	ah
S0529	do you hear about miss her
S0530	i do she tell me the story this morning
S0529	get the train that stop too late
S0530	it be very dramatic
S0529	i can't believe they pay
S0530	they pay sixty quid
S0529	like why do they just have sixty quid lie around be that what people have in their purse like just
S0530	yeah i think it be i think it be erm
S0530	the train service that pay for it though
S0529	yeah i know but like who
S0530	the till
S0529	the till
S0530	well you people pay for their ticket
S0529	what
S0530	at the train station
S0529	there's no till there's just there's the conductor box thing
S0530	there'll be like the food shop
S0529	they don't even have them run at that time would they oh yeah that's true yeah
S0530	and the refreshments and magazine store will have a till probably
S0529	yeah
S0530	if you're on that kinda train obviously
S0529	mm
S0530	which i understand be because virgin train do have that
S0529	they're really posh posh yeah
S0530	be virgins posh
S0529	yeah
S0530	be they
S0529	virgin's like multimillion kind of company and they're well they're well they're not like posh but they're
S0530	it's cheaper to get virgin
S0529	they're more
S0530	where i be
S0529	they're more posh than like what we have and and
S0530	oh okay yeah cos we get virgin
S0529	or whatever it's call here i be that be so weird to me that it be call something different cos in it's call
S0530	i know
S0529	i be like where be the s
S0529	and i be like oh the that make sense
S0530	mm mm mm mm er i've be this i'm so glad this weekend's actually over i don't know why i just have the shittest weekend i don't even know what it be i literally just felt like i'd go back to square one
S0529	yeah
S0530	inside my erm head i just go i don't know why like i don't even know what happen and just like i can't be arsed with anything
S0529	mm
S0530	but i feel slightly better today than i do yesterday so
S0529	that's good that's probably just cos you you be do things like it's just not fun when you're just sit in your room like
S0530	mm
S0529	on the weekend when there's and
S0530	yeah exactly cos i i dunno like i be too tire to do anything
S0529	yeah same like it's just you don't feel like get up even
S0530	it's just it's annoy
S0529	and then the weather doesn't help like the fact that it's really dark and cold and rainy and horrible and you just don't wanna go out and
S0530	yeah exactly we'll have to have a snow
S0529	mm
S0530	we'll have to make a snowman
S0530	if there's snow we'll
S0529	if there's snow yeah we'll make a snowman
S0530	or make a cardboard snowman
S0529	yeah
S0530	or make a snow not even get a name a no i can't think of a clever name i'll make a snow
S0530	i'll build a bed and just put the snowman in the bed
S0529	if i leave would you make a snow me and just like
S0530	that'd be so sad
S0530	and then you'd melt
S0529	yeah i would and it would be like the little snowman or whatever it's call what's it call
S0530	er the snowman
S0529	the snowman so it's not the little snowman the snowman yeah
S0530	little snowman that be so depress that film
S0529	i know
S0530	god i mean it's it's really beautifully animate but
S0529	mm
S0530	i use to love that when i be younger but i use to get you know er i don't
S0529	i think the snowman be a bite of a paedo
S0530	oh cos he hang out with a child i suppose you could take that slant
S0530	i never i saw it in that sense i just saw him as a snowman
S0529	no a kid but no
S0530	he be very like masculine though wasn't he like with his
S0529	yeah he be
S0530	scarf and his
S0529	and i think a little bite of it be sexist if i remember rightly
S0530	hat
S0529	i'm surely there be something
S0530	what the female roles in it
S0529	yeah
S0530	or the lack of female roles for one
S0529	yeah
S0530	and
S0529	i mean there be probably something in there cos there always be
S0530	and the
S0529	when be that make like eighties seventies something like that
S0530	probably yeah
S0529	mm yeah
S0530	i mean the female roles that i can remember be only the one of the the female parent
S0529	mm
S0530	imply that females be only paternal figure
S0529	yeah
S0530	maternal figure yeah
S0529	yeah paternal yeah
S0530	paternal yeah whatever
S0530	erm and then there's i think there's there's no other female snowmen
S0529	there's no women
S0530	i think there be only like one
S0529	no they're like dance remember like when they're when they've get that dance song
S0530	oh god yeah when they're do the dance
S0529	mm
S0530	oh
S0530	yeah still sexist
S0530	still be
S0529	he's still a paedo
S0530	still a paedo i remember when he use to go in he go in the freezer like they go in he sit in the
S0529	oh yeah
S0530	the oh that film's like my childhood
S0530	like i use to literally just sit in front of the tv and watch film like that all day on christmas
S0529	how much snow do you think we'll get then
S0530	erm depend if it's a good year mean the snow i've if imagine that be the floor we've have it up to here
S0529	whoa that's
S0530	so yeah
S0529	better than we ever get
S0530	deep it can be deep but it can you can it can also be really shit and horrible like it can not settle but it'll snow load
S0529	oh i like it when it snow just when it
S0530	it's more sometimes it's more like rain though
S0529	mm
S0530	like it's more sleety
S0529	don't worry about disappoint me cos i get that too when i go home anything that be better than will be better than what i get at home so i'll be excite
S0530	okay okay that's why you've gotta stay for snow
S0529	yeah
S0530	and hill and snow and stuff
S0529	could stay i dunno i dunno i i wish i could cos the point the problem be like i'm leave for christmas in a couple of weeks anyway and it's just such a bummer that i've decide to do this now
S0530	mm
S0529	when i should've do it in like you know the first couple of weeks or just stay till christmas i i it's just seem stupid to leave in the middle of it and i dunno whether i can stay any longer if course cos i remember at like they say to me because your lease last until christmas you could like effectively just stay for as long as you want to pay for it
S0530	mm
S0529	erm and like at that point i still have money to pay for it but i mean the next rent payment wasn't until the next term so i'd basically pay that money already and it be already pay
S0530	mm
S0529	and i suppose that's the case here isn't it cos we've already pay our first rent and that last until like
S0530	yeah
S0529	the next payment in january so technically i could just stay here until christmas
S0530	technically you could
S0529	and get my plane and what not
S0530	but then remember like you've only have one deadline that's be due and the other one you've get an extension for
S0529	two three i've get another one next week
S0530	what the next one what's the other one
S0529	well there's the physics one
S0530	mm
S0529	the english one
S0530	yep
S0529	and the other english one that's this week
S0530	what's the other english one
S0529	i'm not too sure i just know it's for the other minor so i think it's probably something about the bible or something
S0530	oh for fuck's sake
S0529	i know but no it's not just that it's just the think of i just really don't think i can
S0530	hack it
S0529	i really don't i don't think i would be able to do it for the whole year and it's just i dunno it's just waste more money just stay here i dunno
S0530	i mean yeah yeah just do what do what's best for you
S0529	but then at the same time like i do even get the plane back then i'm gonna have to come back anyway get all my stuff it's just stupid er
S0530	would your mum be prepare to pick you up at christmas or not
S0529	no
S0530	no
S0529	i mean well she would that's the thing like that's the horrible thing about it like she would pick me up cos she'd have no choice like how else would i get home with all my stuff but i just don't wanna have make her want her to have to do that cos it's really selfish and i wouldn't be able to give her any money for it
S0530	mm
S0529	cos i don't have any money so that's just er oh i just should've fuck realise this in like the first week and
S0530	don't don't don't think about that now don't think about don't regret everything cos you can't change it
S0529	i know i wish i could
S0530	well it'll be alright you don't have to make a decision right now you can make it at christmas
S0529	mm mm how can i it's like four weeks
S0530	yeah i know i know i know
S0529	what if i just sit here do nothing for four weeks be they're gonna tell me for things and they're gonna have a go at me and oh i just dunno what to do
S0530	i'd say if you i mean would you like to have another shoot or not or be you have you kinda make your mind up or be you not sure
S0529	i dunno i dunno like i've always be like indecisive about it like there's no point try to
S0530	mm
S0529	expect me to say yes or no to one thing cos i'm just not like that
S0530	mm yeah yeah you don't
S0529	like i just i can't make that kind of decision anyway i'm not i dunno i be at the moment i just oh cos you know there's like a certain part of my head dictate all of this and it's the part that doesn't wanna like give it a go and all of that and yeah i dunno
S0530	because yeah i mean you i think you've gotta like like clarify to yourself what part of your mind be tell you to go like what like be it say your so you've get an excuse to like shut down completely and entirely and get worse you know well excuse isn't the right word but do you know what i mean like
S0529	yeah i know i know what you mean
S0530	your that side of your brain just want to quit everything because it's so scar of what's gonna happen
S0529	yeah
S0530	but it doesn't actually like consider what you're gonna do next almost like it's just like yeah
S0529	no it's completely like in the moment i don't have a plan and that's what my mum's be say like she's she's say to me like if you can't do it then you should come home but you must you've gotta have a plan like you need to
S0530	mm
S0529	you need to have something in the in the wing to to go on to like you're not just sit at home get free
S0530	mm
S0529	and i just wish i could like you know come up with something oh and then just at the same time i'm think like even if i could get past this little bite i just can't see myself here all year i really can't
S0530	mm
S0529	not just just do the just do english
S0530	do your work
S0529	i just don't see myself do it mm
S0530	i mean at the end of the year if you do stay till the end of the year i'd i'd see if you could change your degree
S0529	mm
S0530	you might not know what you want to change it to right now and that's okay but you might want to change it slightly and i know you're probably think like what would i do
S0529	yeah then i'd have to do it for four years
S0530	but that's something you what
S0529	then i'd have to do four years
S0530	no no you could you get credit so you could you can sometimes if it's not like a science you can sometimes swap it
S0529	mm
S0530	so
S0529	mm i dunno just the idea of me actually stay for the whole year be laughable
S0530	mm
S0529	at the moment
S0530	yeah you're not feel it
S0529	cos it just make absolutely no sense to me it's just such a shame
S0530	mm i'm just think now what be gonna what we what we can actually do here
S0530	because we can no no honestly because it's not like this can't change
S0529	it's not your responsibility to help with this like you wouldn't be you know it's not it's just up to me to sort this out and i just yeah anyway how have you be
S0530	we've talk about me i'm do fine
S0529	no we haven't we haven't talk about you
S0530	yes we have
S0529	no we haven't
S0530	i say i i tell you what i'd do today and i say i have do my lecture
S0529	yeah but you say you be feel shitty over the weekend and it's
S0530	and stuff
S0529	it's not all go so i bet you're still feel shitty a little bite
S0530	probably a little i don't know like i don't even know why though i've not even get a reason
S0529	in what way shitty
S0530	just like my mood just go completely like i do not feel like like everything be just so hard i don't understand like how
S0529	mm
S0530	but it just be like and you know when you just can't psych yourself that things'll get better like you can't tell yourself that because it just you don't believe it
S0529	mm
S0530	and it be kind of a bite like that and it be really scary it be just a bite like a wave of emotion and it be like oh
S0529	yeah
S0530	actually it be a wave of lack of emotion actually it be more like everything be kind of suck out of me and it
S0529	yeah
S0530	be horrible but yeah what's go on with erm what do you say be go on with like medical support at the moment with
S0529	what
S0530	doctor and shit
S0529	what do you mean erm
S0530	be anything go on with that or
S0529	no no i don't think so i dunno i just er it's all just
S0530	there's a lot of
S0529	this be what always happen with me like i start do stuff and i start
S0530	stuff
S0529	you know make things like put things in place to help me and then i just miss one appointment or something just due to
S0530	and then yeah
S0529	carelessness and then it just completely fall apart again and i'm back to square one like you you felt you felt you be back to square one as well like i feel exactly the same like i feel like yeah cos i i mean i have appointments i have the counsel thing which wasn't you know that great but at least it be something and it kind of felt like i be do something
S0530	mm
S0529	and then i have that doctor's appointment and miss that and i've i've just miss the other counsel appointment that i be suppose to go to on friday and it's just shit how about you what's the situation there have you
S0530	i've
S0529	speak to the doctor's or anyone
S0530	not speak to the doctor's
S0529	no
S0530	but i've speak to obviously i have that shitty counsel session
S0529	yeah
S0530	erm
S0529	be you gonna keep go to that do you think
S0530	i think i will and i think
S0530	next time i might ask her to refer me to the mental health service
S0529	yeah
S0530	because i think i've
S0529	you should
S0530	yeah it'll be quicker as well like
S0529	tell her if she say no just be like well my friend say that you
S0529	refer so you can refer me
S0530	you can refer me bitch
S0529	you can refer me bitch but
S0530	yeah i mean i don't even really see how this be gonna help me to be honest but i might as well if it's the only thing i've get
S0529	yeah
S0530	then i think i might as well take advantage of it really
S0529	yeah definitely
S0530	when when do you say your next appointment be to see
S0529	it be on friday
S0530	right okay
S0529	i just forget i have it like honestly i wasn't try to avoid it
S0530	no you just forget
S0529	i just forget yeah cos it i think it be cos it be read week and i forget that i actually go to campus sometimes
S0529	so yeah i don't know you know when you're just in that state of like
S0530	yeah
S0529	i don't know
S0530	mm
S0529	i really don't know like i don't know what i'm do i don't know what to do next and i'm just feel a little bite like i don't care as well
S0530	they should be support you more this like they've just sort of let you get away
S0530	not get away with but do you know what i mean they've just leave you to your own devices
S0529	well i dunno i think they have though i think like cos the doctor keep ring me up and i just don't get a signal here so i can't pick the phone up and then when they do you know when i'm out and about i'm too scar to ring them cos i hate ring people
S0530	mm
S0529	and it's just stuff like that and yeah and email me say like why do you miss your appointment and i haven't reply to that and it's just
S0530	mm
S0529	sometimes i just hate all the i just really hate it
S0530	all the communication yeah mm
S0529	just do not help but then i i'm i'm just do like this thing where i just don't accept help from anyone and it's just i'm just kind of like afraid of myself a bite like i don't i don't like what i'm sort of what i'm like in sometimes i have like moments when i just i really clearly see how like difficult i'm make it for myself and how bad things be
S0530	mm
S0529	in my head and how it must look to other people like how my tumblr must look to my friends and how and my sister and how it look when i like give like one answer reply to my family just don't say anything and
S0530	mm
S0529	and i just feel really bad about it
S0530	don't feel bad about it because like they don't feel well you're allow to feel bad about it but don't feel guilty like it's a burden on other people because that's that's not the problem there
S0529	mm
S0530	the problem be the reason that they're worry about you which be like obviously you're kind of decline with this like it's not certainly doesn't seem to be get any better right now and i think the thing to work out be whether university be help or if it's actually not help but whether it's the only thing that's slightly keep you go despite you be obviously part of the university but be you know be away from home be help slightly or whether go back would actually
S0530	even though it wouldn't be the best thing it would be better than here like
S0529	it just it just really wouldn't it really wouldn't i know it wouldn't
S0530	no
S0529	it wasn't last year and nothing's change and if anything my parent be gonna be even more you know disappoint and angry with me
S0530	mm
S0529	and just tire and frustrate with you know deal with my shit which they already be during summer like they be really do with it and i understand that like and it's just er and then once you get past the whole like get home thing it's like my anxiety crop up again when it come to get a job and i just feel like really paralyse with it and i can't go to interview and stuff
S0530	can't yeah
S0529	like i go to a few interview last year and just like fuck lose my shit i have like panic attack and just could not do it and it be just horrible and my mum didn't understand why i couldn't just get a job because she's you know from that generation who just get job when they be
S0530	just doesn't understand
S0529	straight out of school and don't doesn't understand
S0530	it seem to be really my mum be the same like my mum get
S0529	mm
S0530	paper round and not paper round
S0529	yeah
S0530	she work as a shop assistant but and she be work from a young age and i don't think
S0529	yeah
S0530	now it's a lot more complicate like
S0529	yeah
S0530	they seem to expect more and require more
S0529	definitely they really do like the interview process be pretty gruelling for someone who's not really use to it like that be the first interview i ever go to it be in like a shop and it be just horrify like what i have to
S0530	mm
S0529	i just completely seize up and kind of like walk out of it
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	cos i be freak out so much
S0530	and it's not it's not really great experience be it
S0529	it be just horrible it's really horrible and it's not like it's easy to find job where i live anyway and like especially at this time of year it's just completely dead
S0530	no
S0529	you know we be a tourist town most of the town be like you know and and we've get students so there be just no job
S0530	mm
S0529	at all and it just make me think i need to go live with my dad but i really don't wanna do that cos i just don't have any sort of connection with him and he doesn't understand and he wouldn't be able to deal with like what i'm like
S0530	mm
S0529	and
S0530	i mean i think personally like i don't know that much about your dad
S0529	mm
S0530	but what you say i think you'd probably feel more isolate with your dad
S0529	mm i think i would
S0530	cos you don't anybody really
S0529	no
S0530	where your dad be
S0529	i know it's like a horrible thing to say but me and my sister be say that like we feel we feel like smarter than our dad we feel like we've kind of go one step ahead of what he use to be to us then like it's difficult to sort of like have a relationship with him because he's just so different to us now
S0530	no no i get that
S0529	like the way we've be bring up with my mum and like she's a really clever person and she's teach us well and stuff like that and
S0530	mm
S0529	and he be like you know he be more of a maths person rather than an english person whereas we're both like really quite in that direction and it just
S0530	mm
S0529	it it's just difficult to talk to him like a you know like someone you have to live with and it's
S0530	mm
S0529	i know that's like such a stupid reason not to do it but it just
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	i don't know i just i just don't see him enough you know he's not like
S0530	he's not like a prominent figure in your life
S0529	no not at all
S0530	no
S0529	and plus he's get the baby and they're completely skint because they're look after her and they don't get enough money from the government for that and there would be no way for me to just you know
S0530	pop in and yeah
S0529	yeah i couldn't i would have to get a job there as well cos i couldn't just sit around and expect them to pay for my food and what else and cos i wouldn't have any money to pay for it you know like it i'd have to get a job and it just never go away the money thing and say this make it seem like a much worse alternative go home and that be my argument before i get her like it's it's gotta be better than what i'm leave like
S0530	mm i mean
S0529	i just can't do this type of this education thing i just can't do it
S0530	i mean if you think anything like me which i know you do
S0529	mm
S0530	the way i see university or the way i've see it before i come here and the way i saw it first which make me freak out about it i see it as this very big thing i think that make me very anxious like i see where i like when i envisage university i kind of see the whole thing like the huge loom horrible thing i don't know why i just have this panic over the idea of university itself
S0529	mm
S0530	erm but if you literally just chop it down into like little bits like it's not it's not as scary as you think it be kind of thing like the more the more you kind of face the fear and the more you go the less barriers it seem between you and learn like like for me it's not completely go but like it's not like impossible any more to actually do stuff
S0529	mm
S0530	which be a big difference from summer like i can if somebody will set me a piece of work i will do it i will try and do it and that be so different from before and like i can't emphasise enough like i know it's so hard to like want to be better because that's like the worst thing like you can't even see a possibility of it even happen but literally you will like you will not get out of this unless you want to like actually there's something like keep you forward because it doesn't just like it's not like when you kind of recover from a cold it go away on its own like you could feel like this forever if your mind like let it you know like and you've gotta like you've gotta kind of push forward a bite and i know it's so hard like it's horrible but you've get to actually like fight it because and i i know it's like you've get no energy and it's shit and it's horrible but you can do it you like promise you can i believe in you
S0529	you're an inspiration you know that
S0530	an inspiration
S0529	yeah
S0530	lols but like yeah i mean you can do it you don't feel like you can but you can like if you can get in this horrible place there's every single possibility that you can feel like a million miles away from this like i bet like there be a point of your life where you would never have consider you feel like this ever
S0529	mm yeah
S0530	and it if it's that possible to get so low then it can change
S0529	do you know when i realise i be depress
S0530	when
S0529	it be when i read the third harry potter book
S0530	really
S0529	like honestly
S0530	really
S0529	yeah
S0530	oh my god why why
S0529	cos of the dementors
S0530	oh gosh wow okay
S0529	yeah
S0530	yeah
S0529	and i be like oh that's what they mean i get it now like cos before i be like what this be weird like this be horrible
S0530	mm
S0529	when i read it first i be like oh i don't understand
S0530	you didn't really understand what be behind them kinda thing you know
S0529	no no and then i be like and and then i get it and i be like whoa that's so obvious how do i not get this before i think it's quite a nice story really
S0530	it be quite a nice story
S0530	i think go back to what we be say before like sometimes i think one of those anxiety provoke things for me be that that i see like things that like make me like procrastinate and not do anything and not want to do anything be the fear of like i see everything i have to do be a big blur that's impossible it's not even like separate task
S0529	no
S0530	it's just this big splodge of responsibility and effort and crap but
S0529	mm
S0530	if i actually write down like separate out what i have to do it's like it's not this impossible mine of stuff it's actually it's not the easiest thing in the world but it's not like list and list of things that i haven't do you know
S0529	no yeah
S0530	and if you do stay like i would not see it as like i i know i keep say this but i would not see it as a three year course like i would take it term by term like i wouldn't even think about what you're do next term and even if it end up you're just get stuff this term you get through your degree by sparknotes or whatever like like if that's what it take i will happily sit with you and help you
S0530	because you know i i don't want you to go home for your sake as well because i don't want you feel like you do last year but there be hope there be hope for you
S0529	mm
S0530	it's not like oh it's shit like inside your head it feel crap but as somebody that's on the outside of your brain i can tell you now that you haven't mess everything up and there's still a chance you've just gotta take it i'm sure that's like a
S0530	it be it sound like a demi lovato song actually
S0529	it do sound like a lovato song
S0530	she should write a song like that if she hasn't already
S0529	those lyric be probably use in like the the climb my miley cyrus or something
S0530	okay right
S0530	there's always gotta be another mountain sometimes you gotta

S0529	fuck be a climb

S0529	kitten puppies
S0530	oh you see this be what we need at university
S0529	pet therapy hundred percent
S0530	how can i

S0530	yes

S0529	well you know
S0530	no no

S0529	we could chill together
S0530	chill in the lounge
S0529	everyone chill in the lounge
S0530	get older will actually make you happier
S0529	yeah i think it will i hope it will
S0530	yeah i think it will because this age be the hardest age and your hormones be everywhere
S0529	it's like that great billy joel song that i love
S0530	which which song which billy joel
S0530	oh okay yeah yes
S0529	that song speak to me about be old
S0530	i mean you might hate be old and you might feel old well we're not actually old yet but you might dread be old but i old people be very happy
S0529	mm
S0530	usually like they're very content
S0529	or dead
S0530	or dead
S0530	either way they're not experience
S0529	no
S0530	well some of them do experience pain because they've get arthritis and that but like
S0529	mm
S0530	to be honest i think i've consider old age more than anyone my age so
S0529	yeah
S0530	i do i think about it quite a lot like a lot of people just don't think about it
S0530	i think so like i i think the more in like in contact you be with old people the more kind of like
S0529	mm
S0530	woah
S0529	just imagine like when you see first grey hair or like your
S0530	fuck
S0529	first wrinkle just how terrify it could be
S0530	fuck
S0530	that's why i wanna get a i'm gonna keep my fringe all my life so i don't have to see my wrinkle i can just
S0529	yeah
S0530	cos you do look younger with a fringe
S0529	i already get a wrinkly forehead so i'm fine i'll be use to it by then
S0530	yeah they'll probably botox'll probably've be normalise then so
S0529	yeah well no cos it won't cos use to the think the future would be so advance but look at where we be now it's not really that amaze
S0530	ten years ago they didn't have botox do they or do they
S0529	yeah but the point be everyone need money if they want all the nice new things like that's the point
S0530	yeah
S0529	you need money stuff doesn't
S0530	that's the thing like but
S0529	like in film
S0530	mm
S0529	like future film stuff seem to of filter down so that everybody have equal kind of futuristic stuff but in our reality it that wouldn't happen
S0530	mm
S0529	cos nobody'll would be able to afford it
S0530	that's very true actually like no one can afford anything in this day and age
S0529	no like they have robots already they're totally ready to go but no one can afford it
S0530	what the fuck why aren't we use robots
S0529	mm no i i don't think i'd want to really cos it'd just be silly
S0530	but
S0529	like
S0530	it'd be kinda cool though for some
S0529	i mean we already use robots for like manual task and stuff they're just not like conscious robots be they
S0530	like get me a drink
S0529	yeah exactly but i mean they have get them in japan just
S0530	very useful
S0529	we're too poor to you know invest in that
S0530	i'd like a friend
S0529	yeah
S0530	a robot friend
S0529	i would i use to have an imaginary friend
S0530	yeah you tell me about your imaginary friend

S0529	no no no this be my phone i would never treat my new ipod like this
S0529	it's it's all in case
S0530	oh
S0529	it's just cos this be a lose cause cos it's already get load of scratch on it
S0530	you're just like yeah
S0529	and it's a bite thicker and more durable than my ipod
S0530	i get so protective of all my stuff at first and then i'm just like na

S0529	well it's like love that love thing isn't like that you love your children yeah for no matter what they do to you
S0530	i guess like if i love my child as much as i love like say my cat i think i'd be good
S0529	i think you will you're suppose to yeah you will
S0530	like
S0529	well some people have trouble like bond with their baby when it's bear and stuff like they have like postnatal depression
S0530	yeah they do
S0529	but they eventually you know
S0530	they eventually kind of yeah
S0529	yeah apparently breast feed help
S0530	what stop you from be depress
S0529	no no just like make you connect with your child
S0530	oh i'm like no this be fun i'm have a ball
S0529	yeah no i doubt it really doubt that
S0530	i i i'm not sure i like the idea of breast feed to be honest
S0529	really
S0530	like i i quite like
S0529	i think it's nice
S0530	i like it but not for me do you know what i mean like
S0529	no i mean
S0530	no i i don't have a problem with with other women do it like
S0529	no no it's cool
S0530	like if they do in public it's cool but it's like imagine myself do it
S0529	oh there's just such an issue with that like my sister work at a restaurant for age and like this woman come up to her say like be it okay if i breast fee like in the corner and i'll like cover it up like in this restaurant and my sister be like no don't don't worry just just do it like it's fine it's completely natural like you should not have to
S0530	yeah
S0529	you know hide it or anything like it's just really upset like
S0530	they now have sleeves so women can do it under a thing
S0529	oh
S0530	like
S0529	it's just ridiculous that sometimes they get send to like the loos and stuff to do it and it's like
S0530	it's like they shouldn't have to like it's horrible yeah like
S0529	it's like a natural thing just don't stare at it you know like
S0530	mm exactly
S0529	just don't look if you're bother by it like yeah
S0530	i mean to me like i don't ever do like a double take if i see it cos i'm use to it
S0529	no no no
S0530	why be women's breast even sexualize i bet there's like some medieval reason

S0530	we do need a rebellion
S0529	we need a rebellion against this conservative government
S0530	and very much

S0529	yes i saw that it be really cool like the erm the the mask
S0530	so what be they plan to do like hack hack the
S0529	and yeah they're try to hack the isis er social media thing face thing i've i've never see that like i i be quite interest in it when it start first happen like i i kinda look up the isis thing
S0530	okay
S0529	to see what it be like like not to look at what they be post or anything just to kinda see what they be do like in term of social media
S0530	mm
S0529	but i couldn't find it like
S0530	yeah
S0529	i dunno whether what their source be
S0530	so if they if they stop if this anonymous hacker person be it a group of individuals i'm assume not just one guy
S0529	yeah i expect they
S0530	but like if they
S0529	yeah like cos anonymous be kind of a famous hacker it do a lot of stuff like
S0530	mm
S0529	yeah
S0530	i mean potentially i mean if they could do that then like what what would happen like what do they if they completely say like like hack what could it do just shut down their connections and stop them communicate and shit
S0529	yeah yeah they i dunno they could try and like override their communications or they could just i don't know make it inaccessible or i don't really know what they could do i'm not you know
S0530	mm
S0529	i don't really understand all that particularly the like i i expect they could do some damage
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	i dunno i just don't understand why like the fbi aren't like sort all this shit out
S0530	i know like
S0529	you know why they haven't catch them yet you know they're not exactly inconspicuous be they
S0530	mm
S0530	like i've read theories that the government be behind all of this
S0529	yeah yeah i dunno
S0530	and it's just like dunno like i don't think i believe that to be honest but
S0529	no no no no no i don't believe that and it's all just try to create confusion and
S0530	but i think i you'd think that this would get sort out but it hasn't and it
S0529	yeah it's just scary like they just keep attack and they keep be successful with it like every time they create more fear every time they create more prejudice racism
S0530	yeah
S0529	hatred which be what they're try to do
S0530	pretty much
S0529	that's what terrorism be really and every time they get away with it like they've not be you know completely
S0530	mm
S0529	catch and whatever and they haven't be you know find by the government and stuff and they just keep do it like they'll go to place that you don't expect
S0530	yeah
S0529	like why would they go to france like that's get nothing to with them really
S0530	yeah
S0529	erm i'm really surprise they haven't target london like i'm really surprise
S0530	they will do at some point
S0529	like yeah i think they will i really do erm and the stuff on the like that be so unprecedented like
S0530	yeah
S0529	it be just out of the blue completely and it's just the way they work and it's terrify like it really be scary that they just get away with it and they just keep do it and it's not gonna stop until someone until someone catch them
S0530	it be surreal though like
S0529	it be
S0530	i can't actually believe that this be happen
S0529	that it's actually happen yeah i know it's it's a nightmare and it's not even happen to us like
S0530	yeah it's scary enough for us and it we're not even the ones suffer at the moment you know
S0529	yeah mm
S0530	it's just the fear like
S0529	i mean but i be scar for england because we're the ones over there like you know fight
S0530	mm
S0529	aren't we we be over there with plan and bomb and shit in syria i don't really know
S0530	partly paris have just drop a load of
S0529	yeah paris have that's why they target they think but yeah
S0530	do they drop the bomb after the what they've do now or have they drop them before
S0529	no it be after yeah they they're over there now i think i read something about that today like in in retaliation for those
S0530	cos it's just like obviously yeah cos it's just like war on war
S0529	yeah it be it's just like poke the dragon isn't it
S0529	what be it never poke a sleep dragon
S0530	yeah pretty much
S0529	the eternal world of j k rowling
S0529	no tickle that's the one tickle
S0530	tickle
S0529	but i mean yeah like how else can they do it like they have to fight war with war like we're not gonna destroy isis without destroy them literally
S0530	mm
S0529	you know
S0530	yeah i know
S0529	like they can't just peacefully hold their hand up and go oh can we please negotiate cos they're not negotiators they're brutal
S0530	yeah it's not like you can just be like
S0529	murderers you know
S0530	how like you yeah
S0529	no they don't understand they're completely one mind yeah it's scary
S0530	apparently i read like a lot of them don't even know like they they say that you're true muslim if you know the quran and they don't even know the quran themselves
S0529	mm well i mean they make up bits of the quran to
S0530	yeah
S0529	you know to make it apply to them
S0530	they're just completely delude like what be it
S0529	they really be yeah
S0530	but it's not religion it's not
S0529	just extremists ignorant as well
S0530	but but they don't even believe do you think they really believe the the their religion like do they believe like they're do it on the basis of religion or be they just like
S0529	well it's like the ku klux klan isn't it like the same sort of
S0530	mm
S0529	ideals i suppose like they just
S0529	they just think they're superior and and they're use like their religion to back that up and it's but it's like it's skew version of
S0530	it just madden me yeah
S0529	the muslim religion and that's the problem like cos it's make out all all muslims to be you know part of the same mindset and it's just not like that at all
S0530	no definitely not
S0529	this be a minority of of people but the scary thing be that it's like it's influence people like the people that they've catch from this paris attack they're from brussels erm and they're obviously like see all this isis stuff and be take in by the propaganda and have go on to like join up with them and it's
S0530	mm
S0529	just really scary like
S0530	god
S0529	how someone could choose do to that and then you have those teenagers in london run away to isis few months ago
