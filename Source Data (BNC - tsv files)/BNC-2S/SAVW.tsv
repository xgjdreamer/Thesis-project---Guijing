S0421	i don't know
S0423	i forget i get that last time didn't i
S0421	yeah i think every time you buy a bottle from these trip they don't fit in your holder
S0423	yes it's these seven fifty mils isn't it i think that's the size
S0421	yeah cos we always get a big one like oh yes but
S0423	there we be look at that
S0421	mm
S0423	a solution
S0421	the five hundred mil ones usually fit but they should really make
S0423	yeah the normal size yeah
S0421	bigger well though if they make bigger holders then
S0423	no this be kind of like
S0421	the five hundred mil wouldn't fit would it
S0423	well yeah this be kind of like for a fairly standard bottle these ones these be bite out of the ordinary size aren't they
S0421	oh the strawberry's nice
S0423	be it
S0421	yeah be the
S0423	mm
S0421	lemon and lime nice
S0423	yeah i'm glad i get that one than just plain ones i'll just put that on there on there yeah that'll do no that's a bite oh
S0421	you just take a picture how many time
S0423	do a
S0421	have you take a picture of yourself like that
S0423	i don't know i'll have to
S0421	wow have you get those pen as well
S0423	well i must have
S0421	oh yeah we discuss this last time
S0423	what
S0421	that we have those
S0423	why do you have
S0421	yeah i buy like a a big pack of them yeah
S0423	oh right
S0421	although i think yours be slightly different yeah yours be a bite harder yours be a bite more plasticy but
S0423	there
S0421	yeah
S0423	yours be better quality be they
S0421	well they weren't great quality because i buy them really cheap i just think they be quite comfortable
S0423	it's twenty past
S0421	to hold how long have we be in sainsbury's
S0423	i don't know it wasn't a very good idea be it i suppose we should have fill this up last night
S0421	yeah i be expect our first stop to be like i dunno like lunch
S0423	what what do you mean lunch
S0421	well i mean it's like
S0423	now
S0421	well no but like have i dunno
S0423	well it will be but it won't be but it won't it'll be a late lunch
S0421	i know but this be our first stop
S0423	might be the time when people have dinner oh right right yeah i think we'll just get straight
S0423	on the way
S0421	how how be we go to have lunch when people have dinner
S0423	well you can call it dinner if you want
S0423	and then we can have supper later
S0421	as we're eat at the time that have dinner if we're have lunch that we'll be want supper what time be we gonna have supper at
S0423	well we on holiday we normally eat a bite later don't we
S0421	yeah but i never have supper it's a bite outdated now we discuss that in my english language class
S0423	really
S0421	yeah like no one really have supper but
S0423	well you know what people do but they just don't call it supper
S0421	yeah well because we be
S0423	cos i i i always have a lot of people well i always have dinner quite late really try and avoid do that but i tend to you know sit down quite late for dinner and then sometimes if you have an early dinner you may want you know say you're have a cup of tea or a drink and you want what people would probably call a snack
S0421	yeah
S0423	but in the past they'd call it er supper
S0421	yeah well
S0423	like it cos supper be only very light
S0421	it be bread and butter
S0423	like a snack really yeah it's not nothing much
S0421	because we be read like a hotel thing and it be like breakfast lunch dinner and supper include and it be like for supper we have on offer bread and butter with some jam or something
S0423	what hotel be that
S0421	in like in the past
S0423	oh right
S0421	like we cos that's what in in english language we do like language change over time
S0423	oh right yeah
S0421	and i be think my dad have supper
S0423	i don't really say i'm have supper now although i suppose that's what it be if you it's just it's one of those word probably go out of the
S0421	yeah
S0423	out of use isn't it
S0421	yes
S0423	like when i be a child my mum might say oh i'll i'll get you some er er do you want some supper like when i be younger it would be use as a word then
S0421	mm
S0423	erm but then people have just stop use it i i i've i think probably because i think people's lifestyles have change a lot though
S0421	mm
S0423	everything's around the clock now and they're not as tie to certain time as they use to be and people work lot of shift work and different hours and erm and i've always never really stick to a regiment time for eat but some people do don't they they erm they like to have lunch at around lunchtime dinner around dinner time and and that's where all that's come from i suppose you have particular time for
S0421	yeah
S0423	certain things don't you
S0421	yeah
S0423	like if you don't stick to those time i guess the the word well i suppose people still say lunch and dinner don't they
S0421	yeah it really confuse though when people
S0423	although they don't say lunch yeah
S0421	well yeah when people don't call
S0423	they say dinner and tea
S0421	they call it call lunch dinner and i'm like
S0423	yeah
S0421	why be you have dinner now and it's like no like er lunch and i'm like oh like it
S0423	yeah i i always use to call it that dinner and tea until i go to london and
S0421	really
S0423	yeah well that's what you say you're from be in the north
S0421	because i've always say lunch and dinner always
S0423	well i suppose i suppose you know
S0421	but i'm not i like well i'm i mean i live in london for like what five years like
S0423	yeah so you might have have that expression in you like again i don't know
S0421	but that be but it's weird though because i've live up north for like the majority of my life i wouldn't i wouldn't consider the
S0423	yeah maybe that's what we call it at home when you're in london or
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos i use to say lunch and dinner er when from be in london and work in restaurants
S0421	yeah
S0423	and the main thing be cos i work in restaurants it's all it's lunch be lunch
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos that's what you're serve and dinner become dinner
S0421	yeah in restaurants
S0423	it become that's
S0421	it be isn't it yeah
S0423	yeah it's always lunch and dinner and then it's just what we call it up here erm
S0421	oh
S0423	it's your dinner and your they call it your tea they like it's
S0421	yeah i that always confuse me
S0423	mm
S0421	when i be younger i be like oh well tea
S0423	yeah i that's well
S0421	but it it be er
S0423	when i be a child mum would say come in and get your tea
S0421	it be so funny online i saw erm this american person have write online and they be like it be so funny they say i'm so confuse about all the british people be so obsess with tea and i be think well okay so like we drink we drink tea but and then like they have they always say oh it's time for tea and they sit down and they all and i'm think i see what they've do here they've obviously be up north and people be like oh it's teatime and they're have as in like tea as in dinner but this american person have hear the word tea and think that they're all gonna sit round and have a cup of tea and like have some kind of a weird tea ceremony
S0423	but maybe that's well it could be what they be do if it's
S0421	i don't think it
S0423	you know it might not be how you've imagine it
S0421	because they they say it in a kind of like most british people and i'm like i don't know any british people who have tea ceremonies
S0423	no but he didn't say it be a ceremony do he
S0421	no they be like they will sit round like it's erm
S0423	but that would be like
S0421	a big ritual or something
S0423	well down that could be like in hotels in like london and that they serve
S0421	well you can have high tea
S0423	afternoon tea and high tea and all that and
S0421	yeah
S0423	so it that be a very kind of old tradition
S0421	yeah but
S0423	but normally
S0421	surely if they'd go to that they would have know it's a kind of cos like you can go to it but most people go as a kind of novelty it's not something unless they just stumble into one of those and think be this what they do every day
S0423	yeah it might be just somebody that hasn't get a clue anyway they just
S0423	slag off the english basically say you know
S0421	they do they do drink tea in america don't they
S0423	yeah i when i be
S0421	yeah
S0423	there i buy packets of tea and have it but it's just not as common you know
S0421	oh right
S0423	erm it it's er you don't see you know you you probably get one brand and they'll be a little section on the shelf
S0421	yeah
S0423	whereas you know you if you look over here you have a whole patch
S0421	yeah
S0423	or you know half an aisle of teas and load of different like coffee's become popular over here now as well whereas in the past you you'd probably have a couple of brand of coffee
S0421	yeah
S0423	whereas in other countries the there be more of an emphasis on erm coffee rather than tea
S0421	yeah
S0423	erm and then even in france erm when i be in france there be just one brand lipton's tea or something that that be it so they do have tea but you you can buy it quite limit on
S0421	yeah because
S0423	you'd get cos it's just not
S0421	when we go to
S0423	as common as
S0421	when we go to hungary and like we go to see one of 's friends and she bring them tea and they be like oh it's really nice like english tea she bring it over for them
S0423	oh right
S0421	so they they don't really they don't have it over there
S0423	yeah yeah and it be very much associate with you know if you get other brand in other countries they might be kind of an english base brand
S0421	yeah
S0423	but a bite more obscure
S0421	yeah
S0423	or say something to do with english because i guess it's and and i suppose why it's be so become so popular here be because the plantations in india
S0421	yeah british empire
S0423	where it be a whole and they they could get it so so cheap it become it just become the drink of everyone you know the
S0421	but i don't like it
S0423	the poor for the poor the
S0423	that's cos you weren't really introduce to it when you be younger i think
S0421	but i like
S0423	cos you always get children
S0421	herbal tea
S0423	when they're really young and they have they have really milky tea
S0421	i don't know why
S0423	well
S0421	it's not particularly good for you
S0423	i know it's just what it's it's it's just the the drink of but it's still a very cheap drink isn't it it's just a drink that everybody would have i
S0421	yeah
S0423	i suppose it become so popular but it's the same in ireland as well as as here it's erm you know tea it's just it's treat just the same or more so you know where it's it's the drink for people in ireland as well erm and other countries you you then have to go to maybe say the asian countries don't you
S0421	yeah
S0423	where tea be important like but they drink it differently to us
S0421	yeah
S0423	like in india and china and er japan green tea and er in india i think i saw the documentary they they have chai or something they call it it's really really sweet and really really milky i mean so it taste very different to ours but it's probably a bite more in common with ours cos in other countries they don't put milk or
S0421	yeah cos i don't put milk in
S0423	sugar in it so obviously
S0421	the one i drink yeah
S0423	no the herbal tea you wouldn't no
S0421	no
S0423	although you'd probably do you sweeten it
S0421	i don't er mum always use to put honey in for me
S0423	oh i bring some herbal teas in case you cos i know you
S0421	oh have you
S0423	a cup of tea yeah er
S0421	be it herbal be it tea with add herbs or be it like a herbal infusion
S0423	erm i don't know
S0421	cos you have to be careful because i always look at the ingredients and it have to be a hundred percent the herb but then
S0423	erm well i haven't i've get one of the packets it's all the same brand the twin
S0421	oh right
S0423	do you know twin
S0421	yeah
S0423	so they're in the car
S0421	they they be a good brand but i think they mix it with well i'll have a look
S0423	do they
S0421	i'll have a look
S0423	i don't think it's it's many that do
S0421	cos i know i i have to buy them in holland and barrett
S0423	the herbs well that's it yeah so it's probably not erm well look i mean i've get a few this so chamomile and peppermint i would imagine peppermint be just peppermint they've
S0421	yeah cos i've get peppermint at home but i buy that one from holland and barrett's and it's like a hundred percent i don't know if that one's organic or if i didn't get the organic one because it be more but yeah erm chamomile can be sometimes mix
S0423	yeah well it it might be their brand because it it's straight off like the supermarket shelf if you want just want purely herbal you have to kind of
S0421	yeah
S0423	maybe you have to shop around a bite more like you
S0421	holland and barrett's be just such a good shop get lot of stuff there that i like
S0423	do you not shop around in other kind of similar shop
S0421	well i think holland and barrett
S0423	that type of thing
S0421	yeah it's a good one cos you can also order online and they have a point system erm
S0423	they can be quite dear some of their stuff though i've see
S0421	yeah but they have good sales sometimes
S0423	yeah when they have offer on
S0421	you can get some of the holland and barrett stuff in supermarkets but it be like holland and barrett's who introduce me to it erm and i saw
S0421	i saw some holland and barrett stuff in tk maxx like reduce ones
S0423	yeah i suppose erm if you want pure like herbal infusions rather than mix with tea you could probably look on i bet online you can get something
S0421	i know but who be i buy it from online
S0423	well no you you you can generally you can you know it's reputable company
S0421	yeah if it be but there's
S0421	yeah
S0423	and it's just like stuff sort of
S0421	grow herbs in their garden
S0423	yeah
S0421	yeah but you can buy loose herbs sometimes at the supermarket as well
S0423	yeah but you don't you maybe things like mint but not peppermint
S0421	yeah
S0423	you you wouldn't really come across chamomile would you
S0421	yeah do you drink peppermint tea that's suppose to be erm good for irritable bowel syndrome
S0423	oh be it
S0421	that's why i get some
S0423	yeah i don't i don't drink it often i get some er as i be come back when i come back home drink ordinary tea
S0421	yeah
S0423	i think oh i'll get a bite of a mixture so there's one that i i use to drink quite a lot lemon and ginger cos
S0421	oh right yeah
S0423	i really like ginger
S0421	yeah we've get that
S0423	so so and i usually add some honey to it and it's really good if you if i have a cold or something like that and add some lemon extra lemon to it honey and erm then i like flavour and that so then i and no i like peppermint so when i be work with this arabic bloke he erm we go out for a drink and he say oh i'll have a peppermint so i say oh i'll try it use to have it and it be quite common in er er so i quite enjoy it the peppermint and it's it's good for the digestive system
S0421	yeah
S0423	isn't it
S0421	that's why it's
S0423	it's good for after a meal
S0421	it's good for irritable bowel as well
S0423	oh right yeah
S0421	and it's also a natural antispasmodic
S0423	i don't think i generally get spasms
S0421	be er that well that's what my irritable bowel syndrome be
S0423	oh be it
S0421	i don't know if yours be different
S0423	oh i don't
S0421	if yours be like
S0423	i've never really look into it be just tell like
S0421	because
S0423	by a doctor once that you've get it and i've never look up
S0421	no yeah well look my doctor be
S0423	what it's about or what it be
S0421	i really like my doctor in she be really good and she always like explain stuff to me as well
S0423	oh right i remember you have pain in your stomach didn't you
S0421	yeah
S0423	last time when we be go to scotland
S0421	that's what it be
S0423	that time or
S0421	no it be in
S0423	be that go to rome last year
S0421	italy yeah and we buy those like antacids but obviously they didn't work
S0423	oh
S0421	but yeah that's what it be it's er
S0423	yeah
S0421	and i get tablets and they're antispasmodic tablets
S0423	oh right
S0421	which be what stop it because they're the pain i don't know if it if you're like yours might yours might be cause by food or whatever but the pain
S0423	i think it be probably your certain foods yeah
S0421	but the pain's cause by like the the muscle in your stomach like spasm
S0423	oh right
S0421	and which be why it hurt and it it it's it's also cause by like erm i think the gas get trap but it's cos of these spasms
S0423	oh right
S0421	or something so it might the tablets i be take they're antispasmodic ones and erm peppermint's a natural antispasmodic and it's quite it i dunno it's not it doesn't work as well as the tablets do but i think it do generally
S0423	it help to soothe it yeah
S0421	yeah
S0423	yeah i i'm pretty good it really erm help not to have wheat things but then you know i've really cut down on the bread i very rarely have it but then when i do like now if i've get bread if i go back to eat bread or have much of wheat stuff
S0421	yeah
S0423	then you know that you over a few days if i have to buy a lot of that kind of wheat base food i'll feel like i've be my stomach's kick it's like a pain like really bloat and it's like a really sore kind of pain
S0421	yeah
S0423	not like a pain like a stomach ache
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	be that be yours be like
S0421	er mine well cos i remember go to the doctor's and she be like what kind of pain and in er be it be it and she give me a list of all different ones and i'm like well it can be any one of those
S0423	oh
S0421	and she's like whereabouts be it and i'm like well it can be here or it can be here or it can be here and you know like when you go to the doctor's and you've and she just kind of like you feel a bite like i don't really have an answer for you because it like cos it be it can be all sort of different pain and it can be anywhere
S0423	yeah it's hard to describe
S0421	on my stomach it can be anywhere and erm sometimes and i'm like yeah sometimes it's stab sometimes it's achy sometimes it's throb like i be like it change
S0423	mm
S0421	erm and she be like oh right yeah most people who come in here with irritable bowel like have this similar so then she like er like press on my stomach and stuff and she's like yeah it's probably that if the tablets work then it will be but then if the tablets didn't work then i'd have to come back but the tablets do work
S0423	and have you never have to take them again have you not have a problem since
S0421	er no i've still get some
S0423	yeah
S0421	but the way i take them be erm like the way she tell me to take them be that i don't take them constantly it's like when when it hurt i'll take them for like a couple of days and it'll stop and then it won't hurt again for weeks
S0423	oh right that's good news then
S0421	erm because on the tablets it say they're not to be take for a long period of time but i think that's if you're take them like daily
S0423	yeah
S0421	a lot
S0423	yeah it's not good to be i wouldn't want to be take medication every day for anything so
S0421	but it's erm
S0421	and i look up online as well and erm it's quite common if you've get it for it to kind of fluctuate and not to have it for age and then just come on and then some people say the might take them for a week like a few a week or something and then it'll go away again
S0423	and
S0421	so
S0423	do she not tell you about food what foods to avoid or anything
S0421	er well
S0421	for everybody be different and
S0421	i don't think mine's food relate at all
S0423	oh
S0421	erm because
S0423	could it be bring on by stress
S0421	yeah well it's for some people it's like a psychological thing
S0423	right
S0421	er like she didn't offer like what it might have be cause by because as as well since the tablets work
S0423	yeah
S0421	erm i and i say i'd not notice if it be a certain time of day or after eat or anything
S0423	yeah
S0421	and some people say that like really random foods like they they make it really bad for them so
S0423	oh right
S0421	they don't eat them but i think in general if i'm be gonna avoid something it would be spicy food cos whenever i've eat anything spicy it's hurt
S0423	yeah
S0421	but not necessarily like it's not always cause by it's like cos sometimes it would be like cause by whatever i don't know erm or sometimes like fry food i try to avoid like with oil
S0423	yeah
S0421	and that that's quite a common complaint for most people but then for some people they're like randomly say like oh yeah i don't eat broccoli or like er lemons or i dunno like weetabix because they all like
S0423	well people they just have certain foods disagree with them
S0421	yeah
S0423	like and that's something
S0421	and then other people be like oh no i find that help me but i can't eat whatever
S0423	mm
S0421	but i've not really notice the food cos sometimes i'll eat something and i'll be like oh i can eat that my stomach didn't hurt afterwards and then i'll eat it again and my stomach'll start hurt and i'll be like so can i eat it or can't i
S0423	yeah
S0421	and i don't think it's it's it's not food relate so
S0423	mm
S0421	but some people just get it like it's not no not necessarily like stress or anything some people just have it and then they have it for years and years and years and they don't really know what cause it
S0423	yeah
S0421	cos there's no abnormalities within the digestive system that would cause it
S0423	mm
S0421	which be why they think it might be like some kind of psychological thing but it's not necessarily cause by stress it's like i don't know
S0423	could be some one of these modern diseases be it
S0421	i don't really know but like no one can really like online on like the nhs and stuff that i look and then i look on forums and stuff where people be talk about it but someone be like yeah i start cos it it's most commonly start when you're about like i dunno this age if you're gonna have it or for you
S0423	commonly start when
S0421	it's probably different er like when you're quite young like
S0423	oh right
S0421	this kind of age
S0423	mm
S0421	when i get it but yours be probably different cos it's like wheat probably yours
S0423	yeah
S0421	erm and someone say on one of these forums that they they get it when they be quite young i don't know like twenty or something and they've have it for twenty years or something they're like forty now
S0423	uhu
S0421	and they say it's a real pain but for some people it's much worse than what i have i'm like i'm really
S0423	oh yeah
S0421	i'm really glad that mine's not like that
S0423	you er you just have to manage it i suppose i mean for years i tend not to do much about stuff and i've just ignore it and then eventually it become so bad that i think i must i need to change things to try to improve this and the the difference it make when i cut out bread and things like that
S0421	some people be on it
S0423	it's a massive difference
S0421	because er what i get be like it's not like it's it's never be pain where i've be like ah it's just kind of a bite of a discomfort for me
S0423	well mine's like mine's kind of it's like a er sometimes my rib and just like an ache as though i be bruise kind of
S0421	yeah
S0423	that you just don't feel like you say it's very uncomfortable
S0421	or like i don't know sometimes it it will be quite like if it's if it's if it's quite bad one day it's never to the extent where i'm kind of like oh i'm gonna stay in bed all day but it will hurt quite a bite
S0423	mm
S0421	erm but some people be like yeah some days i'm just in agony and i'm in bed and i think and these be the people who've kind of go to the hospital as or for like test cos obviously it's really bad and they think they're and even the doctor be kind of like oh you know it might not be irritable bowel if it's hurt this much and the medication they give them isn't work and things and er they've have all sort of test and scan and everything and everything's come back that they're all fine so it's just irritable bowel that's what it's get to get to be and they're just sometimes they have to like stay in bed for a day or something
S0423	oh right
S0421	and i'm just like well that's unfortunate
S0423	so for you it's not that bad be it for us

S0421	yeah
S0423	well if your grandad like fudge and that kind of thing i think it's a it's a cornish fudge
S0421	yeah i think they have some yeah
S0421	my friend use to go to devon on her holiday and she always use to bring back this like chocolate fudge
S0423	mm
S0421	and it be so nice like i use to i be eat it and i be just like really nice and i wouldn't wanna eat it because i wouldn't know where i couldn't i couldn't buy it anywhere else
S0423	you could bring back some clot cream for your grandma to try
S0421	i don't know if she'd want any it be funny
S0423	well she bake plenty of cake but she doesn't eat them really do she
S0421	yeah it be funny we be at that indian and she be like how do you think they make this and i be like erm and mammy's like i i don't think you'll be able to make this at home like
S0423	why
S0421	well well she'd have to
S0423	it's only lentils
S0421	no it be like curry and like and she'd wanna she be like want to make all these curry now and like
S0423	oh right
S0421	erm not it wasn't just lentils you know it be like a lentil curry with chicken and like potatoes and everything
S0423	that's easy enough to make curry
S0421	i know yeah but would she be able to make that one because if she where
S0423	well if she look up a name online and get the recipe
S0421	she she have like this obsession i know but whenever you make it like you'd have to buy all these special indian spice and everything like
S0423	well they're not special you can get spice anywhere can't you
S0421	well not all of them because some of my friends at college
S0423	yeah
S0421	erm they be cos like they they be i don't know if they be indian but erm they be from that part of the world and they be say
S0423	mm
S0421	that they go to like the indian supermarkets and things
S0423	well that's what i mean yeah while you while you be over here if your grandma want any spice there's a big indian
S0421	yeah well we'd have to go there
S0423	supermarket
S0421	and then like buy them and things
S0423	yeah and
S0421	and it's a bite of a it's like a a big pain isn't it
S0423	it's only fifteen minutes down the road
S0421	it's not like like you can just go to like sainsbury's and buy like thyme and stuff
S0423	well sainsbury's be probably as far as the other place
S0423	so it's a fifteen minute drive
S0421	and like she
S0423	and you go in the shop and get what you want
S0421	you'd just buy all this stuff and you just make like one curry with it it's just no
S0423	well no you you'll have the stuff then you can you can do other stuff with it if you have it there
S0421	yeah
S0423	if she's interest you should get some spice you could bring them back
S0421	she just have this obsession with whenever we go anywhere to eat anything or if we buy anything to eat that she's not make she's like i wonder how they make this and she's like look it up and try to make it but whenever she make it it's never the same because
S0423	well why what other place
S0421	anything
S0423	i didn't know you take her out to eat much
S0421	well we don't but if we even buy something from the shop
S0423	oh
S0421	and we're eat at home she's like i can make this and then the next day she'll be make it and i'm just
S0423	well i think that's good
S0423	that's really good that she do that
S0421	oh i remember er it be something like i don't know we go to mcdonald's and i have those like cheese dip things like cheese dippers where you dip it in the sauce and it's like fry cheese and she's like oh i bet i could make these and we go home and we be literally we'd stop off at mcdonald's cos we out and i have
S0423	mm
S0421	these cheese dippers get home and within the next few hours grandma be like in the kitchen
S0421	make do you want some and i'm like i've just eat them at mcdonald's
S0421	i don't want more cos she's like she
S0423	oh so do she like cheese erm wrap in they're coat in breadcrumbs
S0421	yeah like
S0423	and fry
S0421	those mozzarella dipper things
S0423	yeah
S0421	whatever they be erm
S0423	yeah it's quite a famous italian thing only they do their version with the
S0421	yeah yeah yeah
S0423	the italian
S0421	but it's like anything like absolutely anything if i'm enjoy some kind of food she's like oh i'm go to make this and say she enjoy
S0423	that's good
S0421	she enjoy my cook as well it's like she want to beat everybody it's funny she's like or and mammy buy me a reduce sandwich from the shop once and i i really really like shop buy sandwich and i be like mm and grandma be like what's in this sandwich to make it so good
S0421	i bet i could make you one of these sandwich
S0423	and what be in it
S0421	i don't know i don't know what it be it be like some kind of
S0423	do she not make you one
S0421	no she didn't in the end because it didn't have like the all the ingredients and everything on cos it be a sandwich so and this cake that we always buy it's call almondy and it's

S0423	oh right
S0421	one of these countries and erm it's really nice and we always use to buy it and grandma be like want to make it and we be like yeah you can if you want if you can make it because it's probably gonna be nicer if you make it rather than buy it cos it be a freeze one erm but the recipe for it be like nowhere on the internet everybody's like discuss it like
S0423	mm
S0421	how do you think you can make it but it's like a secret recipe
S0423	oh right have she try
S0421	she didn't in the end but she be go to but then we think it's probably not gonna we have no idea what's go in it so it might not be nice
S0423	but your grandma she's good at bake so she would have an idea wouldn't she of
S0421	well you see she do she's she have an idea but whenever she do have an idea and she make it it's usually not as nice it just it just doesn't work cos she's like i bet i know what's in this but it it's it's not it's not quite right
S0423	i think it's time we have some of that chocolate don't you

S0423	i need one of these
S0421	horse show great family day out park that's where house be isn't it
S0423	i think so be that where it be
S0421	must be i think it be house
S0423	where the horse show be
S0421	be very nice it's in park
S0423	the horse show be
S0421	yeah and i'm guess that's where house be as well
S0423	that's not though it's
S0423	mm
S0421	where
S0421	that's where park be
S0423	oh right
S0421	i think that's where house be
S0423	no i'm not far from there now
S0421	oh
S0421	yeah house be very nice
S0423	erm
S0421	mm
S0423	i think you still have the chocolate in your hand i be gonna have a little bite more it's not as nice as house
S0421	do you know i be just think of because erm on facebook it come up that one of my friends from college she be at house
S0423	mm
S0421	and i be like i've be to house it be age ago that we go there
S0423	it be wasn't it
S0421	mm 's a a little bite big though
S0423	what for your
S0423	just for your live standards
S0421	yeah it's it's a little bite big i think be a bite smaller it be still big
S0423	yeah i've see the photos that your mammy take
S0421	there's this erm page on facebook that i find and it's call victorian house and every day they post like these house these victorian house and i'm like look at them like oh they're so nice
S0423	yeah but it cost a lot of money for the upkeep if you're think of buy one
S0421	yeah but erm some of them aren't that big like they they look affordable
S0423	mm
S0421	like you know like not kind of like crazy
S0423	not like stately home cost
S0421	yeah they're like nice they're like big house but
S0423	mm
S0421	like say like not affordable affordable but kind of like within the kind of if you've get a lot of money you could probably buy one
S0423	yeah right it's a long way in a straight line now
S0421	mm i remember when mammy be look for house like when we be buy this one and i be sit next to her on my laptop cos she be on hers look for like house and i be on mine look at castle for sale i be like oh
S0423	bet she be surprise at what you be look at
S0421	i be like oh look at this castle that there's for sale in the south of france
S0423	they're mean to be a good price in the south of france
S0421	yeah the castle in france like there be
S0423	probably be out of mammy's budget though
S0421	yeah they're not they're suppose to be er quite they're suppose to be better price in france for castle than like over here but there be some really big ones and i be like no that's not affordable but then again for the size of it it be probably a good price but
S0423	mm
S0421	i don't really i'm not really in the know of how expensive castle be
S0423	well i think you can get something reasonable price in scotland as well you know small ones
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos some of them be just like a big house in the style of a castle
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	you know i mean the bigger ones again they're like have a big stately home they're very pricey to
S0421	yeah
S0423	to keep it in good condition and run it it's a
S0421	all that money people use to have
S0423	mm well yeah some of these stately home like chatsworth house that's why they have to open it up to the public
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos they can't afford to
S0421	i can't believe that they
S0423	keep it
S0421	could afford to keep it once though
S0423	that's yeah they use to well i suppose the rich when you think in britain you have all the colonies and
S0421	yeah
S0423	it be a very rich country well i suppose we still be but i think individual wealth be even more so then cos the rich be
S0421	oh yeah that
S0423	there be a lot more poor who have nothing
S0421	the poor be in like the workhouses weren't they
S0423	mm and the rich just have phenomenal wealth didn't they
S0421	yeah
S0423	they'd have servants they have everything some of those house oh traffic that's one thing i wasn't think of traffic
S0421	imagine if you live in cornwall and you want to go to your holiday to scotland
S0423	mm
S0423	be a long drive wouldn't it
S0421	you'd probably fly wouldn't you
S0423	mm
S0421	or you'd have to stop off somewhere for the night
S0423	well you could do it in one day
S0423	like couldn't you you wouldn't have to stop overnight it depend on i mean your grandad drive didn't he from slovakia to london
S0421	yeah
S0423	i don't know if he even stop
S0423	those house be nice
S0421	it's cool that isn't it that you're on the erm if you're on the continent you can just drive to all these different countries
S0423	mm yeah we have to get across the water be an island
S0421	although it's just as well really because erm all the er immigration problems that calais have they'd all be come over to us if we be attach we'd be like overflow
S0423	yeah
S0421	cos calais be overflow and france it's like please help us
S0423	i don't understand why erm once they're in france i know quite a lot of you hear them interview you know these
S0421	yeah
S0423	the refugees there's a lot of them arrive in italy isn't there on boat
S0421	yeah
S0423	erm a lot of them be die cross have you see it on the news
S0421	not recently
S0423	oh right have you hear about it though yeah
S0421	yeah
S0423	it's the big thing at the moment and quite a lot of them say oh i want to go to england and some there's quite a lot be say germany as well
S0421	mm
S0423	but i don't understand why erm why do the get to france and want to go to england because
S0421	maybe they're
S0423	what's wrong with stay in france
S0421	i think maybe the help they get isn't as good
S0423	mm
S0421	i don't think they have a
S0423	i think that france have a good benefit system don't they
S0421	yeah but i don't know if it's different for the immigrants like for french citizens
S0423	mm
S0421	but i don't know if like how they can get citizenship and stuff i think it's quite hard and then until they've get that i don't think they get much help
S0423	mm
S0421	cos you like see them like make camp for themselves like in the wilderness or not the like the
S0423	what calais in the wilderness
S0421	no in france
S0423	i know yeah
S0421	well it's not it's not wilderness but they're like just
S0423	i know you see them
S0421	camp out on their own
S0423	on er just er some rough land
S0421	yeah
S0423	that that's not use and but it it'll be in the town though on the outskirts
S0421	yeah
S0423	or something
S0421	it's because also we didn't sign that agreement so i mean like if even if we be attach if we'd not
S0423	what agreement
S0421	there be this agreement where erm i don't know what it be call but we learn about it in french and erm all pretty much all of europe have sign it to say that you can travel
S0423	yeah well you have free border yeah
S0421	yeah
S0423	but that's not the reason why they're there though if we'd have sign that then it would be even easier for them to come over wouldn't it
S0421	no like they they they're there because they can't come over because
S0423	yeah
S0421	we sign it so if we be attach they still wouldn't be able to come over but if we be attach you know if we weren't an island erm then erm
S0423	oh right
S0421	then they it would probably be easier to get over the border you know what i mean cos
S0423	mm
S0421	here it's like you have to get on a boat and like it's
S0423	yeah
S0421	er
S0423	well no the agreement i'm think of be one where european citizens they don't need a passport do do they they have freedom of movement
S0421	oh right yeah
S0423	across border but we didn't sign up to that we still so that's why when we go to italy we need our passport
S0421	yeah
S0423	erm but other european countries go from from there around europe they don't need to show
S0421	really because
S0423	the their passport
S0421	when we be cross the border i'm not sure where we be i like slovakia or hungary or romania or something like they come round to check passports
S0423	well maybe they yeah i don't know i don't know how it work well no they've
S0421	oh well maybe they have to check passports because they don't know where we're from we could have be from england
S0423	yeah and i don't i don't know whether they er have sign up to the agreement cos they're quite new aren't they
S0421	yeah
S0423	slovakia and hungary and maybe it's the older ones er maybe western europe or some
S0421	yeah well yeah i don't know we didn't sign something oh but maybe that's the reason they can't come over because obviously they won't have passports will they
S0423	well yeah but that won't make a difference though to the immigrants will it
S0421	so that might be the one that's why they can't come
S0423	what
S0421	that's why they can't come over because they don't have a passport
S0423	well
S0421	that might be the agreement that i'm think of
S0423	well no yeah that's no it's a different thing cos
S0421	oh right
S0423	immigrants be or asylum seekers they have it's different laws for them isn't it but i i think maybe once they're in in europe say say they arrive in italy
S0421	yeah
S0423	and they've be check and give
S0421	yeah they can like travel
S0423	status as asylum seeker they can travel freely
S0421	but not to us
S0423	i yeah i think maybe that's cos they have the status from say italy
S0421	yeah
S0423	so then they could get across the border to france if they have status but
S0421	but they're like so desperate you wanna see the stuff that people do to try and get over to england like it's not that good
S0423	well you see women and they're carry baby in those boat and you it's i don't know why it's
S0421	well why be the rest of europe not good enough
S0423	it's a bite of a risk isn't it to
S0421	well like i understand why they'd want to come to europe
S0423	oh you mean when they're try to get on the lorries and that
S0421	yeah
S0423	yeah well people have die haven't they
S0421	yeah
S0423	er
S0421	like once you're in europe you're not you're you're okay really like compare to where you be before
S0423	well exactly yeah it's er if you're gonna be
S0421	but like no i wanna go to england
S0423	i think for some reason it's just build up some kind of reputation
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	of the countries like it's
S0421	because everybody always like hear about england like
S0423	yeah
S0421	or like go to england and everything'll be alright and then they can't get there and they're like no i must go to england
S0423	mm
S0421	in japan i think their quota for immigrants that they take on per year be like fourteen asylum seekers
S0423	fourteen
S0421	yeah
S0423	unbelievable isn't it
S0421	something like that
S0423	i mean they probably have a well an attitude similar to a lot of people in this country in that well we're an island and
S0421	yeah
S0423	we're overcrowd and i think
S0421	well i think japan do have
S0423	japan it do have a yes
S0421	quite a lot of yeah
S0423	well i mean japan like this country though there be plenty of space
S0421	yeah it's concentrate in all the cities
S0423	yeah that's it yeah
S0421	like tokyo be just like
S0423	yeah but they have you know the countryside there's
S0421	yeah
S0423	you can plenty of space for people but obviously not many people
S0421	live there
S0423	go there it's the same here there's there's if you know look at
S0421	yeah all the land
S0423	you know the space available there be still plenty but i guess er there's no work in rural place be there
S0421	yeah
S0423	except in the cities and that's like where everyone go to the city
S0421	but yeah it's like in japan the population's like ninety nine percent ethnic japanese
S0423	mm
S0421	not many foreign people go over there to live permanently
S0423	it it's it's unusual that isn't it cos with it be a a a rich successful country
S0421	yeah maybe it's like the difference in culture though cos it's very hard to integrate yourself
S0423	but there be quite a few westerners go and
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	live and work over there don't they
S0421	yeah one percent of their population they probably make up i mean so yeah that be quite a lot but it's not a massive number
S0423	yeah and it they don't really have i mean we've get er our erm history and so on with with colonise
S0421	yeah
S0423	we've get link to lot of countries
S0421	yeah
S0423	that we've start in you know kind of allow immigrants in for work and so on
S0421	yeah that's why yeah
S0423	i think japan hasn't get that kind of history have they
S0421	no
S0423	and i mean it obviously they attract they have expansion and so on well it be the second world war not kind of integrate those people into their country they want to i guess keep separate i wonder if they're much more er racist over there
S0421	they be apparently because well
S0423	maybe they're not if you're in your place you know if you're say a westerner or from another country
S0421	yeah
S0423	and you're work there but if you try to maybe they don't like you if you erm integrate into their society and way of life
S0421	yeah i think if you're yeah if you're kind of like live there i think they don't mind if you're here for like if you're over there for like however many i don't know for like a while like some people go there for a few years or something then go home but erm i think my or someone who i i be speak to in college i think it be her brother or like her cousin or something her be work in japan
S0423	mm
S0421	and that he say that his experience have be quite like that they be he's have quite a lot of racism towards him
S0423	really
S0421	yeah i think he's a he he's he be study to be erm it's really weird this he's study to be erm a doctor over there
S0423	mm
S0421	but if he'd if he doesn't get to be a doctor he can use the qualifications he's get and be a lawyer instead
S0423	what it doesn't make sense to be over there study to be a doctor though why would you
S0421	i don't know i think he he like learn japanese and everything and
S0423	well his japanese would have to be amaze to be able
S0421	yeah
S0423	to be in medical practice wouldn't it cos when you think of all the medical terminology
S0421	yeah he must be i don't know why some people want to don't they
S0423	mm
S0421	i think he he i think he's like learn i think he do like quite a lot of it over here but maybe he's just do some of it in japan for whatever reason
S0423	yeah
S0421	i don't know i didn't speak to her that much but yeah that be what she say
S0423	mm i saw something on the news erm not long ago they have a miss japan some kind of competition
S0421	oh right
S0423	erm and er it be er the woman who win it her dad be her dad's a black american
S0421	oh right
S0423	and like the japanese and
S0421	yeah
S0423	there be a big protest about it say this person can't
S0421	yeah
S0423	be miss japan cos they're not japanese and say they're not er but she be bring up in
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	er bear
S0421	yeah
S0423	i i think she might have be bear and bring up in japan and they be still say protest she's not a japanese person you know she's a a half black american
S0421	but it's like i think it's just because such a high percentage of their population be japanese so they're not use to
S0423	yeah
S0421	like cos over here there's not that much racism because we're just so like diverse there's all sort of people over here but er just imagine if like there be just all english people here it would be strange
S0423	yeah you'd be go back to what it it be like
S0421	yeah
S0423	at one stage here
S0421	yeah
S0423	when immigration be introduce
S0421	i mean i don't know how bad it be maybe there's a bite i i don't know but i suppose if it be bad it's not really noticeable because there's not many people to be racist to
S0423	mm well like when my auntie come over in the sixties auntie
S0421	yeah
S0423	do you remember auntie
S0421	no
S0423	mam say that she come over to work auntie erm i think she be work in and there use to be crowd of people stand outside say go back shout at people there must have be a lot of irish work in the factory
S0423	go back to ireland
S0423	so there be a lot of i there's that poster that you use to see in in some like hotels and bed and breakfast
S0421	oh yeah no
S0423	no black no dog
S0421	no black yeah
S0423	no irish
S0421	yeah yeah we do that in er gcse history
S0423	yeah so there be a lot of and there still be erm
S0421	and like how it be like segregate like that you'd have to use separate transport and shop and things
S0423	in this country
S0421	i'm sure there be wasn't there
S0423	no
S0421	be that in america
S0423	no that's america
S0421	really do they not do that over here
S0423	no there be never segregation
S0421	be there not or be it just america
S0423	yeah
S0421	oh
S0423	or south africa but there there be still many racist people in this country and still
S0421	yeah and i think it's get
S0423	it's get very much
S0421	it's get worse at the moment though
S0423	well yeah but you don't
S0421	cos well
S0423	even when i be at school you'd you'd now you don't it it's very rare
S0421	yeah no one say it out loud really
S0423	like well yeah it's very rare and quite shock when somebody openly say something very racist but when i be even when i be say your age it be openly
S0421	yeah
S0423	er people would have
S0421	no like
S0423	no qualms about be openly racist
S0421	people will say it like
S0423	but now it be
S0421	if if you're sit there
S0423	well
S0421	with like a couple of people someone might say something like quietly do you know what i mean
S0423	yeah
S0421	they would never say it in front of a group of er like a big group of people
S0423	yeah
S0421	but like they would say it like if they know you and
S0423	mm
S0421	i'd just kind of be like i never know you be racist
S0423	yeah so it be keep very much underground so there be still a lot of it exist but cos it be er i mean society's change so much since i be kind of your age with regard er racism and sexism
S0421	and people be always like
S0421	i'm not i'm not racist but and then they say
S0423	yeah and they always
S0421	and then they say something and it's like that kind of sound like you might be racist
S0423	well when somebody start a sentence with that
S0421	yeah
S0423	you know it generally mean well you you're probably about to say something racist anyway
S0423	even though you don't think you be what shall we have next a chocolate peanut or a liquorice allsort
S0421	oh i don't like liquorice allsorts
S0423	oh do you not
S0421	so you'll have to eat them all
S0423	oh i'll have them
S0421	you'll have to eat them all no i don't like liquorice i always think they look really nice like dolly mixtures but then i always eat one and i be disappoint cos it have
S0423	oh it's probably cos you be expect it to be sweet and it have this other flavour
S0421	well i just don't like liquorice in general so it taste like cough medicine i remember
S0421	i be get some cough medicine once and the person in the shop be like do you like liquorice cos if you do then you'll really like this and i'm oh no i hate liquorice and she's like oh you're just gonna have to take it then and i be like great
S0423	well most medicine don't taste particularly nice though
S0421	calpol do
S0423	well for baby
S0421	i've not have
S0423	well
S0421	calpol in years
S0423	do you miss the taste
S0421	it be nice but i mean i wouldn't eat it but and that red cough medicine with the teddy bear on it that be nice
S0423	yeah i remember there be some medicine you have to take when you be ill and oh it it be absolutely impossible to get you to take it
S0423	you'd scream and be wriggle around and
S0423	move your head and you just wouldn't take it so we have to go to the doctor and he give us a syringe and we have to put the medicine in the
S0421	squirt
S0423	syringe and squirt it into your mouth
S0423	so you couldn't er wriggle out but it it's amaze the strength of you when you're a baby
S0421	yeah
S0423	that you and how much you didn't want this medicine
S0421	yeah
S0423	you'd just squirm and wriggle
S0421	yeah
S0423	i mean you couldn't force it down to you on a spoon it just keep get knock out of the spoon because of the way you be move around pet travel by road and air uk and europe worldwide
S0421	what pet be travel in there
S0423	must be vip pet
S0421	animal couriers be that like be they like deliver animals or be they like
S0423	no they're pet they're people's pet
S0421	where be they transport them though
S0423	well say for instance somebody's come from another country to relocate they
S0421	oh
S0423	they might it might be more comfortable than put them in a cage or a
S0421	yeah
S0423	and er
S0421	but they'd have to be in quarantine wouldn't they if they're come here
S0423	yeah but it's it we i don't know what the agreement be now cos erm it always use to be you'd have to quarantine but i don't know how it work now there be a scheme i don't know whether it's it's when you're take your pet out and you're bring them back i don't know if they have to go through that now cos you know they're chip
S0421	oh yeah
S0423	and if they're register and have injections and stuff and all that
S0421	yeah then it should be alright i think
S0423	i don't know i don't know if there's a better way of do it now
S0421	i think if they if it's your pet and you take them out and you're bring them back in i think it's okay if they've have the necessary injections
S0423	yeah i think if you're bring them over and they've not be check and
S0421	yeah but if you're like move from america to here
S0423	yeah you probably have to
S0421	and then it's an american animal
S0423	yeah
S0421	it would have to be quarantine
S0423	it's i'm i'm not sure i do hear something about it cos people from over here they're go away to work and pet have to be in quarantine for six months i don't know if they could take it over
S0421	yeah you can take over but then
S0423	or drop them off before you come back
S0421	yeah
S0423	but it would be six months in quarantine wouldn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	before they're allow back in so i'm sure i hear something but i don't know some scheme so you don't have to do that now
S0421	do all your new dvds arrive
S0423	oh yeah they arrive within two days and i think they'd be usually they're fairly quick on the normal post of with them
S0421	yeah
S0423	and erm but then you know when it send me the email cos when i when i say oh normal post they say it's three to five days
S0421	yeah
S0423	so i think at the latest it'll be the saturday before i go away so i'll be okay
S0421	yeah
S0423	but then it send the email and it say six to eight days
S0423	will be the arrival date and if that's the nearest day
S0421	they usually just say that to just keep themselves save in case the post be late
S0423	yeah and then er well i think it would be royal mail but it wasn't so it arrive like two days after i order it which be great
S0421	yeah
S0423	and erm well i get in back in from work i be work in the even and erm then there be a piece of paper wait say you know and i think oh it must be the from the post office say it's at the post office
S0421	yeah
S0423	and i pick it up and it's like amazon courier or something and it's like it's
S0421	yeah
S0423	and say your your parcel and then it's get options different options
S0421	yeah
S0423	and it's just write in black bin
S0423	and i think oh right okay they've put it in the black bin which be where the all the bottle and things be
S0421	yeah
S0423	so i think that's not too bad it's out of sight
S0421	yeah it's a good idea yeah
S0423	and it's safe enough and then i go out and it be rain out with a
S0423	light rain and it be on top of the black bin in a cardboard box
S0423	i think i can't believe they'd just leave it
S0421	yeah
S0421	they they leave they use to leave it in our porch like tuck around the side
S0423	yeah
S0421	or oh do you know what they do once it's good it be only book because erm it say where it be and they say over in the in the garden and we have like a big fence and they'd throw it over the garden fence and it be in the garden
S0421	but do you know that you know cos you can get amazon prime and it'll do next day delivery for you if you pay
S0423	yeah
S0421	every month erm you use to have that didn't you if you live in london and you've get amazon prime it'll deliver it in two hours there's an option
S0423	really
S0421	two hour delivery cos they must have
S0423	do you have to pay more for that
S0421	i don't think so oh maybe maybe a bite but they that's what they must have the warehouse there somewhere
S0423	yeah
S0421	mustn't they
S0423	must be it's er
S0421	can you imagine that two hour delivery like next day delivery be good but if it come in two hours
S0423	you could be at home and get your book deliver read it and then say oh i feel i fancy another one
S0423	order another one
S0421	yeah
S0423	and two hours later it'll be there for you
S0421	it's good efficient
S0423	yeah i think i go on that trial
S0421	yeah
S0423	to get it all in the stuff in time for christmas and and i think i nearly forget to cancel out of it
S0423	i just remember log onto it and just cancel at the last minute before they start charge me
S0421	yeah i be on erm
S0423	oh no you know i forget to cancel
S0421	oh do you
S0423	but they the credit card cos i'm sign on to them with account and that fortunately the credit card they try to use
S0421	yeah
S0423	it be er out of date so they couldn't charge me
S0421	oh
S0423	so then i just cancel it so
S0421	i saw something online about like amazon prime for students and i don't know if it's discount or if it be just like a free trial if you're a student or something but i didn't look at it i think i have to pay something so i be like no
S0423	oh right
S0421	i won't bother i don't use amazon as much as i use to
S0423	why not be you not buy book
S0421	well i haven't be lately but i've be i've be look and i don't like i use to buy from amazon themselves but now when i buy a book i buy from like the people who sell through amazon cos they're cheaper like amazon be not as as cheap as it use to be
S0423	oh right but you do it on their website
S0421	yeah
S0423	type of yeah
S0421	because i remember i use to get like a really big amazon box just full of all the book
S0423	mm
S0421	from amazon but now i get separate package cos i order from separate people
S0423	yeah but yeah i i bring load of dvds there's big you know those er bag for life things
S0421	yeah
S0423	i've get one of those bag full
S0423	although the laurel and hardy ones be
S0421	yeah
S0423	fill half of that
S0421	oh right
S0423	and i i think i have erm jurassic park the second one i'm sure i have
S0421	do you not
S0423	but i just couldn't find it
S0421	ah
S0423	so i've get one and three but i i don't think if you see the first one you don't really
S0421	yeah
S0423	some of the character be in they they carry on
S0421	be the dinosaurs
S0421	do the dinosaurs look real
S0423	yeah
S0421	do they
S0423	well the the the ones in the original the kind of it must be animatronics rather than cgi
S0421	oh
S0423	i'm not sure i would imagine it would be so they they do look good whereas this last one be a cgi one
S0421	do you see it online they create a jurassic jurassic park once to erm try and do some like study or like some experiment on like dna to create a dinosaur or something and it like there be an article online and people be comment like do he not learn anything from his own film
S0423	i don't think you can get dna from anything would you from a
S0421	i don't know you i i don't think you could no i don't think he's do i think he want to do it like put more research into like study about like the bone and everything and like structure and i don't know
S0423	yeah
S0421	it's probably someone just romanticise it on the internet like they're gonna make a jurassic park like and it's gonna kill us
S0423	yeah usually as it's on the internet there will be something somebody'll be
S0423	get the wrong end to it you he's probably fund research into a certain aspect or
S0421	yeah
S0423	you know but i bring some other some dvds that i think i bring four and you didn't really want to watch them so
S0423	well i've bring them anyway
S0423	just in case
S0421	i think
S0421	we could just watch laurel and hardy every day
S0423	yeah i think we've get more than enough have you bring any
S0421	no i don't know where they be
S0423	and i've bring some of them that i buy i'm not there be one or two i think you've watch but i'm not sure what you've watch and what you haven't so
S0421	oh right
S0423	we'll see they will have a supermarket if you see anything you like that like a nice thing to watch
S0421	well laurel and hardy be just the best so
S0423	i've watch them for a while
S0421	yeah
S0423	do you bring your one
S0421	i don't know i don't have a clue where do you know how long it take me to find some stuff that i've pack in my suitcase literally it just i be search for hours for things don't have a clue where it all be
S0423	so i suppose you can't unpack if your room's not ready yet
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos maybe by the time you get home it'll all be unpack will it
S0421	i think some of it will be yeah like yeah most of it will probably it'll be unpack but i'll probably have to rearrange it all because it'll just be
S0423	do you need to get cupboards and wardrobes for your room
S0421	well the removal people say my wardrobe wasn't very good quality so they didn't they didn't erm
S0423	that's a bite cheeky
S0421	well because we be like why do you not
S0423	what do they say we're not move this it's not
S0421	no no they move it and then they be like they didn't assemble it and usually they assemble it and we don't have the instructions anymore obviously
S0423	oh be it what they take it apart
S0421	yeah yeah cos you have to cos it it be rubbish quality but
S0423	do they do that
S0421	well they take it apart and they always reassemble it cos if you move
S0423	where do you buy it
S0421	tesco or somewhere or argos or
S0423	oh
S0421	or something i dunno erm
S0423	and they say it's not very good quality so we're not put it back together
S0421	yeah and they say you're probably better get a new one
S0423	oh well your grandad could try and fix it
S0421	well yeah he be go to but i think cos mammy buy these like old wooden ones that that they she didn't have any room for so i think i might have those instead so it's like get a new wardrobe but they're like old
S0423	yeah
S0421	cos i don't
S0423	might be better look in ikea
S0421	ikea furniture's rubbish i've we've have stuff from ikea before and it always fall especially wardrobes
S0423	i think you have those big grey wardrobes they be good quite sturdy
S0421	yeah well some of them be and i think if you pay enough for them at ikea but we've get these erm well they're not
S0423	well there's a variety of price for stuff there
S0421	yeah well if you get
S0421	if you get if i'm gonna be buy the cheap ones then
S0423	there be some decent quality there though
S0421	cos my wardrobe be cheap and so be my desk and we've get rid of my desk cos that be always fall apart so i'm get a new desk well it's not a new desk it's the desk that be in the computer room i think that might be from ikea actually it's quite it's
S0423	yeah some of their stuff like
S0421	good solid wood
S0423	some of the stuff be a bite pricier and better quality though and there's just a range of price and quality aren't there
S0421	yeah but if we'd be if we would have be buy something we would have look at something cheaper but the ones we've get be they're like they're not they're not class as antique but they're that kind of thing cos we buy they're quite old and they're like make from proper wood and everything so they should be fine
S0423	mm well i think you be gonna get the light colour wood for the house you know it's quite dark isn't it
S0421	yeah why be we gonna get light
S0423	i think she say that
S0421	no
S0423	i think i say to her be you gonna get wood like in the other house which be dark it's not as dark as that though
S0421	what the floorboards
S0423	yeah
S0421	yeah it be light wood it's not the pale one because
S0423	no
S0421	we don't really like that one cos it's like milky
S0423	mm
S0421	so we get medium
S0423	oh right be you have that through the house
S0421	erm i think we're have we might have the the lighter one downstairs cos it's cheaper
S0423	and where do you get that
S0421	er b and q i think
S0423	oh right you should have look in ikea i remember i get mine from there
S0421	this be very cheap floor
S0423	be it
S0421	very cheap floor yeah it be it be like ten pound a box or something
S0423	mm
S0421	actually i think it be only that cheap because it be reduce so we think we'd get the reduce one instead of the actual cheap one
S0423	ah right
S0421	cos it it come out the same price as the really cheap one
S0423	mm
S0421	but it cos it be reduce so we think it be probably better quality
S0423	better quality
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	so you have you get enough to have it in your room as well
S0421	uhu
S0423	yeah it look similar to mine in pattern it's just a bite darker yours i think mine's slightly lighter
S0421	yeah see i think i have those wardrobes you've probably see them they're like the the dark wooden ones
S0423	mm
S0421	cos they're good quality probably better than the one i've get because it's like it's not even wood mine it's like mix wood it's like wood mix with whatever it be
S0423	you mean the ikea one
S0421	well i don't think it's from ikea
S0423	i think you mean the one that you're not keep
S0421	yeah it's not from ikea it's from tesco or argos
S0423	oh tesco yeah they they tend to it's not necessarily wood some of these be they
S0421	yeah
S0423	they're probably make from recycle paper and it's all
S0421	yeah
S0423	compress and
S0421	that's it's yeah cos like my desk the drawers be always fall out and stuff erm so we we scrap that and the wardrobe's make of i mean the wardrobe wasn't fall apart as such but the doors never really fit properly like they be a bite you couldn't close them properly and stuff he's not get a plate a number plate that car
S0423	oh yeah have he get one in the window i think he have
S0421	oh
S0423	or trade plat it should be on the outside of the car but they're like they just
S0421	yeah they usually stick it on yeah
S0423	yeah i think it's i think i saw something like it
S0421	cos you can't really see it
S0423	yeah it's like a red or white colour
S0421	like if he be do something now and want his number
S0423	yeah
S0421	you can't see it
S0423	well it's it's probably quite a it's a vehicle that's be deliver to somebody that they've buy
S0421	oh
S0423	they call them trade plat and somebody's hire to somebody have a job just deliver cars
S0421	oh
S0423	and they they would have these normally it be attach to the vehicle for the journey and the they they attach it's like a red and white plate
S0421	yeah
S0423	and i think you probably er apply for a licence so
S0421	if it's your job to deliver cars so like would you drive there in that car and then how would you get back
S0423	i don't know what what they do to organise it or or i've never really meet anyone who do it so i've er i guess they'd
S0421	you'd think you'd have your company car and tow it wouldn't you
S0423	yeah they they would either use public transport or any or or you would hire a car at the other end
S0421	mm that would be a nightmare wouldn't it you wouldn't think that would be very cheap for the company
S0423	well it all go onto the cost of
S0421	yeah
S0423	whoever's buy the car i suppose or if if it's a big operation then you know you never know if they he then go to whatever part of the country it's in and you go to pick up the next car to bring that back
S0421	yeah
S0423	you know you may not exactly be in the next in the same city but he's say then take that down south then there might be a car that need to come up north
S0421	oh
S0423	or south
S0421	yeah
S0423	so it might be a short journey on the train to the next car and then he bring it back home
S0421	yeah
S0423	it depend how it what i don't know
S0421	it's not a bad job really be it quite easy
S0423	yeah i suppose you'd have to if you like drive then some people maybe enjoy drive job don't they i guess the there would be you know like all job there be certain kind of pressure on you so again i'd say to
S0421	at a certain time
S0423	you yeah well that need to be there by this particular time they might have a time that it's get to be book for cos then you've get to make it to this other place by that time and so then you might get into traffic and i suppose there'll always you know there's gonna be delay sometimes when you're on the road so
S0421	well yeah you can't help it if there's load of traffic
S0423	but well the the thing be his job be drive so it's a
S0421	yeah
S0423	it be very very time er very much very important to kind of
S0421	yeah
S0423	keep the time right
S0421	cos er if you
S0423	you know and he get if you get back late to the depot they're complain sometimes what
S0421	yeah
S0423	where have you be and you know sometimes the motorway could be shut or
S0421	yeah and also if you're you can only drive for so many hours when you're drive those lorries can't you
S0423	well yeah he's run out of time sometimes and he's have to stay overnight somewhere
S0421	cos you have to stop you can't you just can't drive anymore
S0423	yeah legally you
S0421	yeah
S0423	you'd erm it's very serious you cos if you're
S0421	cos you've get like a meter on your thing as well say how long you've drive for haven't you
S0423	yeah it's call a tachograph
S0421	yeah
S0423	so i think in the past it use to be you'd have to have something in your car you'd put it into a machine and it register your time on a on a disk or something but now it's probably all digital now
S0421	yeah
S0423	i would imagine and it be the driver's responsibility not to come and so if you go over the hours then you be accountable you lose your licence and have a fine and even worse which it it's a good thing to have because you know in the past before they have that it be drivers you know drive for far too long and they're fall asleep i mean you still get drivers fall asleep
S0421	yeah
S0423	and cause accidents and cos they can still i mean sometimes he can work fifteen hours or something
S0421	yeah
S0423	which
S0421	which be still a long time if you're like
S0423	yeah i think it's less than that for drive time but because he have to unload the vehicles
S0421	oh
S0423	cos a lot of lorry drivers they they just sit in the
S0421	yeah they just drive
S0423	lorry whiles somebody else unload but the contract his company have be that the drivers do all the unload as well so once the vehicle's stop it's not consider you as drive then
S0421	yeah
S0423	so even though he's still work erm it's not drive so it kind of stop the clock on his time
S0421	yeah well though do you think that's less for people who be carry like hazardous liquids
S0423	er
S0421	do you think they can't drive for a long
S0423	well probably not i mean i'd say 's be for erm fifteen hours sometimes he work but it it i don't think you can drive for that long
S0421	yeah
S0423	it be tighter restrictions but because he's unload and stuff
S0421	yeah
S0423	like that it kind of stop so i'm not quite sure what the restrictions be
S0421	we get our wash machine and they ring us and they be like erm the delivery people be like oh yeah we're just gonna drop it wherever we wherever we park and we be like can you not bring it to the door for us at least even if you're not gonna bring it in
S0423	you're suppose to bring it in i'd insist on it
S0421	er they wouldn't bring it in they be like no we're just gonna leave it so they leave it at the door
S0423	and who be that what's that company
S0421	it be just a it be a small er place we buy it from
S0423	oh right
S0421	and they be like no we're just gonna drop it at the door we're not bring it in and we're like well we want it right at the door then
S0423	i can't believe that
S0421	i know yeah
S0423	that's rubbish that i've never come across
S0421	but our wash machine's really good on the bright side
S0423	why what brand be it
S0421	aeg
S0423	oh right
S0421	yeah we get it for a good price because erm i think it's an older model
S0423	mm
S0421	like you know there's like and we've get erm a five year guarantee on it
S0423	mm
S0421	on all part
S0423	that's good
S0421	yeah manufacturer's warranty
S0423	mm and be it the company you buy it off that deliver it
S0421	yeah well i dunno their like delivery company whoever it be whoever they use
S0423	yeah cos you could complain to the company and say look whoever you're get to deliver they just they weren't very cooperative i don't suppose it's gonna help you much though
S0421	no but it's alright yeah we be look to get an aeg cooker as well because aeg be a good brand
S0423	mm
S0421	but the aeg cookers be really expensive so we just
S0423	yeah i think all of their stuff probably be er
S0421	yeah we be quite lucky with the wash machine
S0423	yeah
S0421	it be like the same price as other stuff so we get er a hotpoint cooker
S0423	mm
S0421	but the cooker's good as well
S0423	be it
S0421	mm the person who's fit it like the plumber
S0423	yeah
S0421	he say it be good as well
S0423	oh right
S0421	you wouldn't wanna be get erm he say he agree cos we be look at other ones we be like we didn't wanna get a beko one and he be like yeah they're rubbish don't get one of those
S0423	yeah well
S0421	it's like he didn't
S0423	yeah yeah they're cheaper so they're kind of the cheaper end aren't they so you're
S0421	yeah
S0423	more you're pay the least price and they're probably not gonna last as long be they hotpoint's kind of they they they do it be a good brand and it's more kind of medium price
S0421	yeah
S0423	i mean the top end or something but if you get the medium price one you're not hungry yet be you not
S0421	no and our wash machine we do a wash for one and a half hours and then it's get a good energy rate and it's like a plus plus
S0423	mm
S0421	or something and we check the electricity after we do the wash and nothing go down out of it so it mustn't have be erm
S0423	it's hardly use anything
S0421	yeah i think it's like after a kilowatt or something it like change on the meter
S0423	yeah
S0421	and it it just it hadn't move like it still say the same so
S0423	mm
S0421	it's good
S0423	yeah i think i may have a chocolate nut and erm
S0421	it's probably melt everywhere oh right
S0423	well it's get a shell on it hasn't it
S0421	oh right them i think you mean the the bar
S0423	no i mean the you have
S0421	how many do you want
S0423	well four in my hand pour more slowly otherwise they'll be all over the floor that's it
S0421	be that enough
S0423	yeah
S0421	do you just put them all in your mouth at once
S0423	well a couple of them
S0421	what do m and m stand for
S0423	don't know think you'd know that
S0421	no munch and munch
S0423	could be mm and mm
S0421	yeah
S0423	come into
S0421	what's in
S0423	a town call
S0421	be that it be there anything interest there
S0423	i've never be
S0421	i've hear of
S0423	well i think be the area where isn't it famous for potteries be that what they call that area
S0421	be it
S0423	the potteries
S0421	maybe
S0423	as well think so just south of here be
S0421	you know i've recently erm realise that there's like load of counties in england that i didn't even know of before

S0421	i don't know but just like
S0423	what you've not hear of
S0421	yeah
S0423	name one
S0421	staffordshire
S0423	you must have hear that before
S0421	i've hear of but like
S0423	oh
S0421	it's just when you kind of like realise that it's er a county
S0423	shropshire
S0421	yeah
S0423	have you hear of shropshire
S0421	i have
S0423	warwickshire
S0421	yeah i have hear of the that one
S0423	we're gonna be pass through after that south of wiltshire
S0421	yeah that's a new one
S0423	yeah you've be to
S0421	have i
S0423	i take down there at the time you know that pond with the frog do you remember that
S0421	no
S0423	oh right

S0421	i don't remember ever visit
S0423	no
S0421	i just know that she live in australia
S0423	you never visit her there
S0421	i know i
S0421	i i that's kind of i don't remember like move i don't think
S0423	oh right
S0421	she just kind of always i kind of
S0423	oh right
S0421	i think i kind of remember you say though 's move to australia but like i've always kind of associate her with australia and like never really here
S0423	oh right we go to visit her from london with your grandad in the car
S0421	mm it's really annoy erm because sometimes when i've put my address in on websites like if i'm order something and it's like it just come up lancashire automatically and i'm like no and it's like no lancashire and i'm like no and it won't let me put in as a county and some place
S0423	well that's very
S0421	yeah
S0423	it's not many i've never really come across it
S0421	have you not
S0423	i have erm
S0421	cos i've be change my address in lot of place and it's just keep do it and i'm like excuse me excuse me it's not lancashire
S0423	you don't think most of them bring up yorkshire and it use to be
S0421	yeah yeah
S0423	but it's be a long time now so you can't blame it on it's not be update
S0421	yeah
S0423	it's be for a long long time
S0421	but i be on one website and i be look for county and i couldn't find and i be like okay i'm just gonna have to put in lancashire and lancashire wasn't there either and it it be and it do county as town
S0423	really
S0421	yeah and i be just like i don't know what this website be do
S0421	yeah
S0423	that website it's so what others have you come across
S0421	i don't know i
S0423	cheshire
S0421	no of course i know cheshire
S0423	yorkshire
S0421	of course i know yorkshire i bet there's some that you don't know
S0423	there will be yeah
S0421	yeah some really i i can't i i can't think of them now but i just remember think be that a place
S0423	i can't think of any in erm there be well surely cornwall be split into counties i can't think of any that might be in cornwall
S0421	be be devon a place or a
S0423	devon's a county
S0421	a county yeah
S0423	yeah
S0421	i think it be
S0423	oh cornwall be the county what be i on about
S0421	yeah
S0421	oh i i think you mean be there any near or other counties near cornwall
S0423	oh right yeah
S0421	even
S0423	i don't know what i'm think
S0423	i be think all the others we've mention be shire
S0421	yeah yeah well because
S0423	yeah we do yeah
S0421	we have this conversation didn't we and i be like i i think all counties be shire but it like make sense cos
S0423	devon and cornwall
S0421	most of them be
S0423	dorset
S0421	kent
S0423	kent well there there be a lot of shire isn't there
S0421	yeah a lot of them be yeah
S0423	it must have some mean then mustn't it
S0421	yeah probably in latin
S0423	mm
S0421	i would like to learn latin and why do people not you know like the people who learn latin like the scholars mainly probably why do they not speak it like revive the dead language and speak it
S0423	well
S0421	amongst yourselves
S0423	well that's it who would you speak it to it would be
S0421	all your other scholar friends you
S0423	well yeah
S0421	maybe they do
S0423	i mean well they
S0421	maybe they do sit
S0423	i mean well they they'd come out with phrase and whether you'd have conversations i don't know but i mean i guess do you not have to be able to speak it to practise law i don't think you do now do you
S0421	mm
S0423	but a lot of legal
S0421	yeah so like it would
S0423	like legal term
S0421	it would be like to a certain extent like speak like when we do dr faustus in english literature there be part of it in latin
S0423	mm
S0421	that we read out in latin
S0423	yeah
S0421	but like some of the quote be in latin and i be think for my exam should i learn that in the latin or should i should i learn the english translation cos i be think that examiner's probably not gonna know the latin and they're just gonna be look at it like
S0423	and won't won't
S0421	in the end i didn't need any of the latin quote anyway so
S0423	what would you have do
S0421	well i only know a few i would probably would have put them in latin and just let them suffer
S0423	well yeah it like
S0423	that's the way it should be isn't it
S0421	yeah
S0423	that's how it be in the book it's not necessarily a quote if it's not
S0421	yeah
S0423	take exactly from the book be it
S0421	yeah the play
S0423	the play
S0421	so i be like well they can just do what they will with it
S0423	i'm sure if they're an examiner it should be on their
S0421	no honestly some of the
S0423	do you know the mean of it
S0421	yeah
S0423	well they must do surely
S0421	i don't think so some of those examiners right we get some of the the script back er some of the old test and we be we be read through what they the candidate and they get an a have write and be like they've mark that bite wrong like that that wasn't
S0423	mm
S0421	i don't know and then our english teacher be like you know they just pick any old person to be examiners now anyone can be like any teacher can apply to be an examiner and they can just do it at home
S0423	mm well you'd think that you would have to be that with your subject wouldn't you
S0421	yeah well it would be but
S0423	right
S0421	not they've not necessarily study that play and if they have study that play if they've read it and everything they like there's a lot of latin like i i only know the latin because i'd learn i'd learn you know what it mean and everything and like i don't think most people who study it unless you study it in great detail like would and i mean and like my teacher probably wouldn't have know all the latin bits
S0423	mm
S0421	but you'd think you'd look it up
S0423	yeah
S0421	but i think some people wouldn't bother they'd just be like oh okay they've quote
S0423	mm
S0423	well if your subject be to study that play then how can you not know it cos you
S0421	yeah but
S0423	you're miss part then aren't you
S0421	people don't people don't some people be like the the examiners be just do them like while they're have their dinner like mark these paper and stuff and we'd only be study the play for like i don't know and we be already like that character that they've it it you know that that's not right or whatever
S0423	yeah yeah i think as an examiner you you've gotta be the highest of the high really if you're mark paper
S0421	no just any teacher
S0423	it just it doesn't doesn't seem right do it
S0421	you'd think it would be this like elite group who be do them all
S0423	yeah
S0421	but it's just anyone
S0423	well i suppose when you think how many paper they have to mark
S0421	yeah i know
S0423	and
S0421	it would just take for forever wouldn't it
S0423	yeah but even so there have to be accuracy in there
S0421	yeah
S0423	otherwise it make a mockery of the exams
S0421	i think i'd be hungry but i'm not really
S0423	no i'm alright i don't think we stop off on the way to scotland do we although we probably set off earlier than
S0421	yeah do we not
S0423	today no i know we do on the way back i don't remember stop off on the way there
S0421	yeah maybe not do you remember go down to oxford and we didn't stop and we we stop like just before we get to oxford or something and like we could barely walk cos we'd be sit in the car for like
S0423	mm
S0421	i don't even know how long
S0423	yeah
S0421	cos it take us quite a while didn't it cos there be traffic it be like
S0423	well that's right yeah
S0421	five hours or something
S0423	yeah cos i be gonna say it's it's not that bad a drive
S0421	no yeah there be load of traffic
S0421	and we be in it for like five hours or something
S0423	or something happen didn't it yeah
S0421	yeah there be like a crash
S0423	an accident or something cos you have to ring ahead didn't you
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos i do give a bite of extra time cos i think oh we'll arrive early and
S0421	yeah
S0423	what have you so it's just as well i do that cos of the accident
S0421	and you be like cos we be cos we be run late and you be like oh i'm gonna have to stop to go to the toilet and we get out of the car and our legs be like
S0423	yeah
S0421	and you be like hobble along like run like ah do you get your tyres do
S0423	yeah there's two new tyres on the back
S0421	oh and your disk fit
S0423	well they say it doesn't need do cos erm the brake pad be not
S0421	oh right
S0423	it's about fifty percent so he say if you're have disk do you may as well have the pad do at the same time and they still work okay erm there's not a problem with the disk but they will need change when when for the pad to be do so it's they're okay for a while erm that be it i think yeah yeah the tyres i have on this at the back i've never change they be on it when i originally buy it
S0421	oh
S0423	and they've be on it for years they be a good a good brand so the tread be isn't very wear it's still keep really good
S0421	yeah
S0423	but the side of the of the tyre because it's so old be start to wear
S0421	mm
S0423	er i think they be japanese yokohama
S0421	oh yeah
S0423	i think they be they're a lot dearer than the average tyre
S0421	yeah the thing be japanese cars be good and they last a long time but if you ever need a part for a like a japanese part they're really expensive
S0423	yeah well this this car honda they have a reputation for be the most reliable
S0421	where what company's honda
S0423	honda that's what they be
S0421	no but what where from
S0423	japanese
S0421	be it yeah
S0423	yeah
S0421	yeah
S0423	er but it have be a great car it's
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos i i do have some problems with the not many but before i get rid of it it be quite a few kind of a few time where it break down for some reason i have load of puncture on that as well erm but i use i think i use to get budget tyres and i think that's why
S0421	oh right
S0423	it's probably better to get the or like either yokohama on there or something the front ones i have be just a good brand before i've change i can't remember what the front tyres be so they've always do me okay i've go down to more the medium price one now though so hopefully it it'll do a good job but yeah i guess it show if you pay a bite more for something you do get better
S0421	yeah
S0423	a better life out of it well the only problem i have on this be the exhaust come through
S0421	oh yeah
S0423	but that happen when
S0421	and that be when we be gonna go somewhere wasn't it
S0423	erm
S0423	i think it be be it christmas time it
S0421	oh oh yeah maybe
S0423	well no i i go over to see you on box day or something
S0421	yeah
S0423	and i get or the day after box day cos i get the rac out and he check it out and he just take
S0421	yeah
S0423	the back of the exhaust off and he say i say oh i'm plan to go to
S0421	oh yeah
S0423	on it we might i don't know if we go there er but i can't remember now and he say oh it'll be okay it'll just be a bite noisy
S0421	yeah maybe it be
S0423	but i guess that's
S0421	just come to see me
S0423	just from the corrosion or whatever that's the kind of thing that will go
S0421	yeah cos my my french teacher be talk to us about cars and she be like in france like cos over here there's like not many people you that'll have like an english car but in france everybody have like a french car
S0423	yeah yeah
S0421	but she but she say she always buy a japanese car cos they last
S0423	yeah
S0421	age they're really good
S0423	the french as well they're not renault they're not er i don't think they have one of the best reputations and they're really quite awkward cos with our patrol when they
S0421	yeah
S0423	they say some of them say to me oh never buy a renault they're just so difficult to
S0423	if you need to like there be one and it have no his his lightbulb have go
S0421	yeah
S0423	on the headlights which be a really simple thing
S0421	yeah
S0423	to be able to take care of and normally anyone can do it you just you know some some of them can be a bite awkward to get into
S0421	yeah
S0423	but he say this car i can't change the lightbulb it have to go into the
S0423	dealers to do it because the whole front of the bonnet the whole bonnet
S0421	yeah
S0423	have to be take off to change it
S0421	oh
S0423	and it have to go under the
S0421	but yeah
S0423	so that's ridiculous that
S0421	but yeah my friend she just like yeah almost everyone in france will have a french car cos
S0423	well that's why it's still a successful
S0421	yeah
S0423	a profitable company cos the french you know they've be quite i suppose nationalistic and
S0421	yeah
S0423	buy french whereas in this country we we don't
S0421	what be english cars
S0423	well we use to have we we don't there be english cars still produce here but we use to have a a a a big brand you know like like renault
S0421	yeah
S0423	which be know as an the english
S0421	be ford english
S0423	well the the the company ford be american
S0421	oh
S0423	but they have a uk ford
S0421	oh
S0423	so they do design cars and build them over here
S0421	yeah
S0423	erm for the english and european market well let me just see where we're go and the the the the national carmaker the the the big company over here be call rover
S0421	oh
S0423	or or leyland er they they they make vans or something and i don't know whether you've see a rover have you
S0421	i've hear of it
S0423	yeah so they be still on the road and erm then they they they go out of business and then i think bmw buy them and
S0421	oh right
S0423	they just decide to it just wasn't a profitable business so
S0421	people buy german cars as well don't they
S0423	yeah german cars they're a bite more
S0421	germans have just
S0423	the there's reliability as well
S0421	generally quite good manufacture don't they
S0423	well they they yeah for
S0421	cos aeg be german
S0423	yeah they've generally german products the manufacture they have a great reputation yeah er it manufacture in this country have really die down you know it's not
S0421	yeah
S0423	at all i mean this country it be they use to call it the factory of the world cos it invent industrialisation
S0421	yeah
S0423	and things that method of erm produce goods come from
S0421	and we use to have lot of good inventors
S0423	oh well you look at the amount of inventions
S0421	i know yeah but now
S0423	that be world change have come from here
S0421	but now it's like
S0423	it seem to be america a lot where some things come from
S0421	yeah
S0423	isn't it like new ideas er
S0421	not so much over here
S0423	yeah well not
S0421	but like all all the old kind of inventions and things and the discoveries be like
S0423	yeah
S0421	a lot of them be from here
S0423	it stem from this country yeah yeah
S0421	i i discover the other day that isaac isaac newton allegedly invent the cat flap
S0423	oh right why allegedly
S0421	well because erm it's like obviously they don't have that much like from look at note and things
S0423	oh right
S0421	erm
S0423	they always have to historians
S0421	historians think it be him some of them don't
S0423	yeah
S0421	but there's no other clear inventor so it's like pin to him
S0423	yeah
S0421	we think it be him erm and apparently like some people say that he do like cat and some people say no
S0423	mm
S0421	but some people say that he he's erm while he be at cambridge university his experiment be always disturb by his cat cry to come in
S0423	oh
S0421	erm so he put a cat flap on the door
S0423	oh
S0421	a bigger one for the mother cat and a smaller one for the kitten but obviously the smaller ones just go after their mother and in the big one
S0423	mm
S0421	erm but yeah that's what he he make it for and like i i suppose like that flap kind of structure would have be like he be a physicist
S0423	mm
S0421	so it would have kind of make sense that he would have like work that out and everything erm but yeah yeah i be like oh that's nice isn't it
S0423	mm
S0421	it's a good story good facts
S0423	maybe that's what maybe it wasn't an apple drop on his head that he get the theory of gravity
S0423	could have be the flap
S0421	yeah
S0423	come back down well why do that flap
S0421	the cat flap yeah
S0423	go like that i doubt it that's probably from
S0421	yeah cos like some people be say that erm he didn't have cat but
S0423	oh
S0421	yeah
S0423	so it's not a definite then
S0421	no yeah but that's what it's he's largely agree to be the inventor of the cat flap
S0423	oh right i wouldn't have think they go back so long and so far cos all i think they be quite a modern
S0421	yeah but
S0423	idea
S0421	i mean if you imagine what that original cat flap look like and probably like a bite of wood
S0423	well it will have be
S0421	like
S0423	carve out of wood wouldn't it
S0421	yeah but now now they're like all high tech and everything aren't they
S0423	i wouldn't say they're high tech you mean plastic and rubber
S0421	no no they some of them be cost hundreds
S0423	why
S0421	and they have like microchip technology and like infrared and all sort
S0423	do they
S0421	like to scan your cat in
S0423	oh right be it a a proper scan thing for it scan the iris
S0421	it scan the microchip inside them
S0423	oh right that's take it a bite far isn't it it's not as though people have problems with hundreds of cat wonder in
S0423	through cat flap do they i've get another hundred cat in here today
S0421	no but it's quite good people must buy them
S0423	well of course they do cos they can then oh
S0423	we can buy a new cat flap and then you it can do this and
S0421	i've enter the competitions to win them but and if i win them like obviously it would be quite nice to have them but i wouldn't ever buy like we've just get a normal one
S0423	yeah it's not really necessary be it
S0421	no
S0423	unless you do have a cat infestation
S0423	and you have to stop all the the cat in the neighbourhood come through
S0421	can you imagine oh but yeah apparently isaac newton like cat so generally that's what people think so that's nice i like to hear about cat lovers in history
S0423	do you
S0421	yeah it's good
S0423	the egyptians be weren't they
S0421	yeah there be erm an egyptian pharaoh who have his cat bury with him

S0423	well he could be a he could be american couldn't he
S0421	oh maybe he be bear
S0423	cos there's lot of
S0421	there
S0423	different name and just you can't assume because of his name
S0421	yeah but
S0423	i mean i do i don't know why i think it be american it just seem that style you know

S0421	they have a moomin land over there now
S0423	do they
S0421	yeah
S0423	where be it sweden

S0423	mm er be interest place to visit scandinavia
S0421	yeah
S0423	i think it's expensive over there though
S0421	be it why the their
S0423	i don't know why
S0421	countryside's really nice
S0423	mm
S0421	and they have mountains no they have like you know they have like nice mountains with like like lakes and like tree and things that look nice
S0423	well there's lot of countries like that
S0421	i know but i think they look especially nice in place like norway or somewhere
S0423	be you think of the fjords
S0421	probably
S0423	i think it's norway the fjords isn't it
S0421	and they get to see the erm the northern light sometimes in norway don't they
S0423	yeah more often than er occasionally you see them here now don't we
S0421	yeah like they be say that you could see them
S0423	it wasn't that long ago it be only they be say you might see them over here but
S0421	i couldn't see them
S0423	instead it say it be er it be a bite cloudy
S0421	yeah
S0423	it's always the cloud that get in the way really
S0421	yeah but you there be a point where there be like erm on the internet it be say how you could see them in most place in europe for a while at certain time but i didn't see them it's quite disappoint really i'm sure they wouldn't have be as nice as like they be if you go to see them properly it it would probably just would have be like be that a bite of green in the sky
S0423	yeah
S0421	i think it be
S0423	actually i've see some photos of like when you be able to see them from this country and they do look good
S0421	really
S0423	some
S0421	i saw some photos

S0423	scotland
S0421	it's spit
S0423	look a bite off the
S0421	what a erm like not from er not from this country but from other place in europe and they do look quite good yeah

S0421	no
S0423	do you like it
S0421	no i don't like it
S0423	i think i have
S0421	i can i'm sure i can manage to eat it yeah it's not kind of like the level of disgustingness where i would
S0423	mm
S0421	throw it out it's kind of like when i have to eat christmas cake at christmas
S0423	don't you like it
S0421	no
S0423	maybe you should try mushroom again
S0421	i mean
S0423	i really like mushroom
S0421	i like mushroom when they're thinly slice
S0423	mm
S0421	it's the texture of mushroom that i don't like it's i've i
S0423	oh
S0421	i always like the taste because i always like chicken and mushroom pasta sauce and stuff like that
S0423	mm
S0421	and erm what do i have mushroom in the other day i don't know something but i don't like eat a whole mushroom if they're slice or dice or something i don't mind
S0423	yeah
S0421	but if they're like in quarter or like a whole i can't eat them cos it's like oh it's all squashy and
S0423	oh right
S0421	oh they're not bad when i'm still eat the sweet bite but then once i'm leave with that liquorice
S0423	get too much of a sweet tooth then have you
S0421	yeah i don't like anything sour
S0423	don't you
S0421	at all yeah
S0423	well i think you like those sour sweets
S0421	no i don't know where you get that from like people be like offer me like haribo like tangfastics and i'm like oh no thank i don't like sour things and they're all like oh they're not even sour and i'm like yes they be i've have them before i nearly die
S0423	of course they're sour that's what they're promote on isn't it
S0421	no but most people don't think they're that sour like compare to other sweets they don't think tangfastics be like on the lower scale for them and i'm just like i can't eat them i just i don't know i don't like sour things at all nothing not lemons and like fruit be too sour i'm just like
S0423	what about sweet and sour chicken
S0421	that's not sour it's just sweet they call it sweet and sour because it's not it's not sweet like a dessert but it's not sour it's like sweetish savoury it should be sweet and savoury
S0423	no it's it's cos it'll have a little a bite like erm there's
S0421	i
S0423	some acidity like all foods should have
S0421	well like oranges
S0423	a balance not as sharp as that no
S0421	oranges aren't sharp oranges be sweet
S0423	well
S0421	well
S0423	it depend what orange
S0421	well yes sometimes i get an orange and like i'm just can't eat it but like tangerines and things then er tangerines can be sour it's hit and miss
S0423	yeah sometimes yeah
S0421	you've get no idea
S0423	yeah yeah they're horrible yeah
S0421	you open it up and you're expect a really nice sweet fruit and it's like oh
S0423	mm
S0421	or like peach and plums and things like if they're if they're sweet it's alright but er if they're not
S0423	well they generally be they're not usually
S0421	no really
S0423	peach and plums be generally not
S0421	we always get
S0423	sour much
S0421	unlucky and get the sour ones
S0423	well maybe
S0421	it's unreal
S0423	you need to let them ripen a bite more
S0421	yeah yeah and we always i always leave the kiwis for age now because i have a kiwi and i be just like what be this i could barely eat it cos i'd be
S0423	but kiwis be not sour they're not that
S0421	but it wasn't ripe that's why
S0423	oh right well you don't want them to be too ripe cos they go to mush
S0421	yeah well do you know we have these kiwis
S0423	well i i really like ripe fruit cos it just really bring out the flavour more
S0421	we have this kiwis at the moment cos we buy them quite often now cos i like them erm and i leave them to ripen cos and they weren't sour but i be eat them and i didn't finish the one i be eat the other day because mammy be say it as well cos she have one the other day and she be like inside it taste like mediciny and i be eat it and i be like oh it do as well
S0423	what kiwi
S0421	yeah inside like for some reason it have like a mediciny taste
S0423	strange
S0421	i don't know what it be cos it wasn't sour cos like
S0423	well maybe it be over ripe then
S0421	yeah maybe it wasn't mushy though it do seem a bite too soft
S0423	they be they're quite difficult to tell when they're just ripe
S0421	yeah
S0423	cos sometimes i have let them go too far and if you're try to peel them and they just
S0421	yeah
S0423	split open then you you you press it in your hand and it just mush up
S0421	yeah
S0423	and then sometimes you think oh it's quite firm but not too firm
S0421	i really like mangos
S0421	as well
S0423	i've get a nice big mango
S0421	have you
S0423	yeah
S0421	yes because
S0423	it's for the
S0421	i
S0423	curry though
S0421	i really oh
S0423	well we probably won't though
S0421	i really enjoy this mango and then grandma and grandad have never have a mango before so they get one
S0423	really
S0421	yeah i don't think they have and then they say it be okay and i be like yeah but be it red or be it more greeny
S0423	it have to be really soft
S0421	and they be like yeah it be a bite hard and i be like yeah you should have leave it longer and it would have be nicer
S0423	why where do they have it
S0421	at home we be on skype to them age ago
S0423	oh in kosice
S0421	yeah
S0423	oh right i think you mean they couldn't get it over there
S0421	no no
S0423	that's what i
S0421	they'd just not have one
S0423	oh right no they're not nice if they're not
S0421	mm
S0423	soft cos when they're ripe you you see they're really kind of quite slimy
S0421	yeah
S0423	and juicy aren't they but when they're not ripen they're quite hard
S0421	yeah
S0423	and quite
S0421	kosice
S0423	there's a big difference
S0421	make me laugh
S0423	how do you say it
S0421	i don't know how english people be suppose to say it
S0423	how do you say it
S0421	kosice
S0423	oh right well that i don't think your mammy's ever say it like that to me
S0421	no she probably say it the english way i don't and it's it make me laugh as well the english people say budapest
S0423	well that's how the english say it budapest
S0423	budapest
S0421	budapest
S0423	budapest
S0423	well they're not hungarians so they're not gonna say it like that
S0421	i know but it's just so funny mm i bet all people feel like that when people be say their their country in in english it sound funny
S0423	yeah it's funny how it's a second language to you but you're so familiar with it that you can laugh at people when you think they sound strange
S0421	yeah
S0423	when they say certain word it's i guess cos you've speak it since you be
S0421	yeah well it's like
S0423	you're like
S0421	it's a second
S0423	it's not like a second language be it in some ways
S0421	well it it be a second language but it's not it's
S0423	just seem natural to you
S0421	yeah it's
S0423	it's it's
S0421	like i think cos some people who will who if you learn like a language to a good standard you might not consider it a second language you know because it's not integrate i dunno at some point you probably would but i mean i i'm not sure what
S0423	i think most people who have learn it as a second language would where you wouldn't
S0421	yeah
S0423	be if like in some countries they learn two or three from when they're a child
S0421	yeah yeah yeah
S0423	and it just come natural like erm er i work with people from morocco and
S0421	but
S0423	they say well they they learn they have arabic french
S0421	yeah
S0423	english and they can speak them all fluently and they do learn it from a very young
S0421	yeah
S0423	age and just it's natural to them
S0421	well yeah that's kind of how i learn erm hungarian but i just don't use it as much and i've never be formerly teach it
S0423	well do you think you'll forget it now if you say you stop use it
S0421	i don't i'd never forget
S0423	if it's if it's too
S0421	i don't think i'd ever forget all of it
S0423	mm
S0421	but erm i do struggle if i've not use it in a while kind of like you know
S0423	your pronunciation and so on would probably suffer wouldn't it
S0421	no not the pronunciation
S0423	oh right
S0421	it's the actual word
S0423	what remember
S0421	yeah
S0423	right
S0421	so like you know in english like when you can't think of the word
S0423	mm
S0421	and you're just like and obviously you know it
S0423	yeah
S0421	because it be but you just can't think of it
S0423	yeah
S0421	and it's like
S0423	so it's like that
S0421	it's like that but it happen more often
S0423	yeah
S0421	erm so like
S0421	maybe more simple word the pronunciation just like i don't have to ever think about the pronunciation because that's just
S0423	it come naturally
S0421	yeah and like the way the word be put together
S0423	yeah
S0421	i don't need to think about that it's like the vocabulary mainly like the word that i forget
S0423	yeah so it's one of the hardest things be construct and say the word how it sound
S0421	yeah
S0423	i suppose if you you lose erm some of the word cos you didn't use it that's something that could probably be pick up quite quickly isn't it
S0421	yeah like i it it get it's get easier to kind of put them together
S0423	mm
S0421	and like to think of the word and things if i use it more often
S0423	yeah
S0421	but if it's be a while then i'm just like oh
S0423	well it's a shame your mammy didn't speak slovakian to you as well
S0421	well it's hard though erm it would have be very difficult for me to learn either one of them because because i don't use both kind of on a daily basis between lot of people and because
S0423	yeah
S0421	i'm not use them all erm to read and write and because like all of them aren't include in my education i think both of them i wouldn't know either one to a very good standard it would have be a lot harder because mammy learn slovakian and hungarian as kind of part of her daily life like she use
S0423	yeah
S0421	them all the time but
S0423	well she would if she's
S0421	yeah
S0423	live in slovakia and that whole whole area
S0421	but then but because like those two i would have have to alternate the time i use both of them to her cos it would have just be to her or to
S0423	yeah
S0421	grandma and grandad and i wouldn't have be able to really
S0423	yeah
S0421	so it it only really work to learn more if you that's how your country work
S0423	mm
S0421	and but although i say that i wouldn't ever forget hungarian but mammy say that she start forget slovakian cos she hardly ever use it
S0423	mm
S0421	and that's like
S0423	so do she not
S0421	her second language
S0423	yeah i guess she doesn't speak
S0421	no
S0423	to her parent in it so it
S0421	yeah
S0423	who do she speak to do she use it at all no
S0421	no not really and she say that she's forget load of word
S0423	yeah
S0421	and like my hungarian's not it's it's like fluent but it's more conversational and i'd struggle if someone be be overly formal
S0423	mm
S0421	or like use more complex word like i've
S0423	well it's just cos you've not hear the word before
S0421	yeah
S0423	so obviously you're not gonna know it i think
S0421	but it would it would be like erm you know like when you learn new word in english
S0423	mm
S0421	it that's the kind of way i would have to learn them
S0423	yeah
S0421	so it wouldn't kind of be like erm learn a foreign language it would just be like learn improve my vocabulary
S0423	yeah it's like when you come across an english word that you need to
S0421	yeah but there's more of them in hungarian and like in mammy sometimes she like say things in english that be like they they like sound funny because she's kind of like translate that directly from hungarian into english and like you just wouldn't say it like that in english like you know certain phrase or whatever and then i do that in hungarian as well like i say it funny
S0423	you would have think there's not many that your mammy would say like that now and she's be so long
S0421	no no she doesn't say it often and i think like she know that it's not right but she just kind of you know and i do that as well or like certain pronunciations that i've just learn differently and it the pronunciation's not wrong it's just not standard so like erm like people have dialects and things
S0423	yeah
S0421	for some reason i've learn some word with a bite of a dialect but
S0423	well how have you do that
S0421	i don't
S0423	if you've be speak to
S0421	for whatever for whatever reason i've just learn it like that and i don't know maybe it's just chance that it's part of a dialect
S0423	well your mammy say you speak quite posh hungarian how be that
S0421	yeah i no yeah i do speak like the standard hungarian there's just a couple of word that i might not erm
S0423	yeah well you would have think your mammy would have er er quite a strong regional accent as er from like slovakia
S0421	no erm cos like grandma's cos like where grandad's from cos he's from a village
S0423	mm
