S0282	erm two record at the moment i've on my phone this be not very handy my phone because the technology of a smart phone
S0650	yes
S0282	be not particularly compatible with the
S0650	what the equipment they use
S0282	with the mp3 and the other
S0650	oh
S0282	sort of software that you have
S0650	yes
S0282	to record music and stuff like that because erm they're you know they're all apple people
S0650	yes
S0282	those people they like apple better
S0650	oh
S0282	they don't like all the
S0650	oh
S0282	microsofts and the etcetera
S0650	yes
S0282	but erm so the idea be just that we kind of chat away
S0650	yeah right fine no problem
S0282	so erm erm probably erm so erm you it's your your daughter that you go out to see when they she have her baby wasn't it you be go out to see
S0650	yes
S0282	to see baby
S0650	yes
S0282	so
S0650	yes that's right yes she erm have her first baby er exactly just almost to the day that they have to leave berlin and then and move into the house in brussels and er er we go over have to come over to london to have the child erm in the typically erm i suppose it's a reprehensible way i put my foot down and say my grandson be go to be bear in this country
S0650	and i'm not have any kraut grandchildren thank you and er so she come over here and give birth erm er in
S0282	uhu
S0650	erm well what's it call er it be
S0282	oh i don't know actually
S0650	it be well it's or
S0282	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0650	yeah
S0282	yeah
S0650	yeah erm
S0282	so i don't know how that work though because my my nephew be bear in bahrain and erm and i be never sure whether that mean that there be some kind of question mark over his i mean both his parent be british but
S0650	if
S0282	you know if you're bear overseas i don't know where that leave you whether there's the kind of there's just that little trace there in your heritage where people say
S0650	you you you you
S0282	oh you know
S0650	you'll have to be careful you will have to make sure that the er er british authorities know when it happen
S0282	mm
S0650	and so you have to tell the local consul
S0282	right
S0650	and so on unless they've change it or unless the the rule in the european union may be different but it be essential that er those two little children be bear in england
S0282	oh right
S0650	so that they could where there wouldn't be any problem about them them become british subject
S0282	yeah
S0650	yeah
S0282	well i be yes i be slightly concern with my sister as i think you know actually erm you do find that people who be bear and spend their early live with their peripatetic parent sometimes don't develop root
S0282	you know
S0650	my second son be bear in paris his mother be french and erm she then she's quite a clue up lady erm she move from paris and work for one of the er department authorities in southwest france
S0282	mm
S0650	and that's where first go to school then he come back to england and when he come back to england erm i have to er register him and take out british nationality for him and it i even even have to go to the lengths of get a copy of the his french birth certificate with my name on it
S0282	oh really
S0650	yes they may have change all that this be in nineteen erm eight nineteen the nineteen eighties
S0282	mm
S0650	erm
S0282	i wouldn't have think it be easier now i would have think it be more difficult now because there be so many
S0650	i think it be more difficult
S0282	i mean and we be actually get worse
S0650	yes
S0282	about even europeans come here aren't we
S0650	yes yes
S0282	don't know where all that's go to end i mean i know my mother when she first come to the country have to go to the police station every week and register
S0650	where where have she come from
S0282	well she's french
S0650	oh she's french be she
S0282	mm
S0650	from which part of france
S0282	well she be bear in toulouse
S0650	oh right down there
S0282	yeah
S0650	at one part go to or whatever it's call
S0282	uhu
S0650	in in in and because of er the work
S0282	yeah
S0650	and they they put a lot of money into all the educational facilities and he get an internship with
S0282	mm
S0650	and from he get himself a place at one of the london university colleges er it's a bite stupid i can't remember whether it's or something like that but
S0282	uhu
S0650	erm and he go to a london university but it be quite a business and while he be at the london university the i have to deal with the business of his citizenship
S0282	mm
S0650	but only when he be i dunno he must have be er seventeen or eighteen yeah
S0282	mm
S0282	whereas the french i be talk to my mother about this the other day you know i could get a french passport if i want one and erm and my siblings have do so erm but they all report how snotty the people be at the french embassy when you go there
S0650	oh that's that's true
S0282	so her
S0650	mm mm
S0282	and they be all sort of very disdainful and look down their nose at you
S0650	yeah yeah
S0282	and like
S0650	mm mm
S0282	can i help you what be you do here
S0650	mm mm mm
S0282	so i've always sort of put off the business of go to to get a french passport as well but there be various time when erm for example write to me and ask me if i'd like to vote
S0282	well i
S0282	er because erm obviously he felt that it would help his cause i suppose
S0650	yeah
S0282	rather than his opponents'
S0650	yeah
S0282	so but i think they seem to have a very different attitude to to us have you get property in france
S0650	no no no no i'm glad erm i wouldn't want to have either
S0282	no
S0650	i i wouldn't want to live in france it's a nightmare country
S0282	do you think so
S0650	it's er oh gosh it's awful
S0650	you know no er i mean the only sensible thing that any french people do be come over over here why do you think there be so many people french over here
S0282	well i don't know i mean
S0650	well the i'll tell you exactly why if you've get any initiative at all er er you want to set up your own business for example
S0282	mm
S0650	or you go into a big firm like erm er thomson csf which be the biggest armaments company erm and erm you get very well train up you they insist on you have all these qualifications and so on half of which you don't need
S0282	uhu
S0650	erm and unless you have them you can't get a job
S0282	no
S0650	erm and then if you want to set up your own because you can see all the the er on cost of the bureaucracy which these large firm be stick with the minute you set up a company you have to pay tax whether you've make a profit or not it stifle all initiative it's quite extraordinary
S0282	yeah
S0650	and i'll tell you another thing if you have and this be from past experience if you have a house or a share in a house and you want to share that house you have to do it through a a er an agent appoint appoint not choose by you appoint by the state
S0282	mm
S0650	and he act as a a erm a mediator and whoever be buy the you know er property have to use that person as well
S0282	gosh
S0650	and so if you erm say well you you think the man be get it all wrong er fire the guy be well a very expensive job in in fact
S0282	mm
S0650	it it their system of do things be be weird
S0282	they do have very
S0650	mm
S0282	very strong protectionism my mother
S0650	oh yes that's
S0282	my mother inherit her mother's house and
S0650	mm
S0282	erm
S0282	she be obviously very sentimental about it and want to keep it but that this be in a suburb of bordeaux
S0650	mm
S0282	so it wasn't it just wasn't feasible as a holiday house and er so she let it out and you're not allow to evict any tenant between november and april because you're not allow to evict tenant during the winter because of the potential hardship of the tenant
S0650	oh
S0282	so even if they're not pay you rent you're not allow to evict them
S0650	that be barmy
S0282	erm it all go so horribly horribly wrong over the years that and she get fleece terribly by this this one man erm who really sort of take liberties and then when she come to sell it she have that same situation where you have the
S0650	uhu
S0282	the person who broker the sale
S0650	yes
S0282	and the only save grace of it be that in order to avoid death duties and capital gain and stuff like they're they the the appoint agent will at some point or another leave the room whereupon package of money be exchange under the table
S0282	between the buyer and the seller because you have an official sell price
S0650	mm
S0282	which be sort of set a price where you know which be quite an innocuous sort of price
S0650	yes
S0282	that doesn't attract any attention from the authorities
S0282	and then there's the real sales price
S0650	mm mm
S0282	which be negotiate privately on the side
S0650	mm
S0282	so you know you have piece of paper on the table
S0282	that say the house be be sell for x and then an envelope with
S0650	yes
S0282	the balance of the money get pass underneath the table while the guy be be be look in the other direction erm so erm so the french have find a way around the bureaucracy
S0282	in fact i think really but but that's not to say that erm the state be not a bite erm oppressive in that in that regard i suppose that's one of the reason why they don't have the same problems in paris that they do over here with this sort of young people try to find rent accommodation because you you know there be not that property ownership thing there not a fetishistic thing
S0650	yeah
S0282	about property ownership
S0650	yeah it's true
S0282	there
S0650	all and er all the land and i know that that but all the land in paris belong to the state
S0282	mm
S0650	it doesn't belong to various individuals
S0282	mm
S0650	my aunt have a house er in er erm er i and my great aunt also have a house down there as well erm and they be always have trouble with er get permission to do this or have this that and the other do
S0282	mm
S0650	and so on and you have to oil everybody's hand and
S0282	yeah
S0650	otherwise you just never get anywhere er
S0282	no it be erm no my father be though be always that he want to move there because erm they don't have oh well until recently they haven't have the same thing about speed so you could drive how you want and however fast you want
S0650	oh
S0282	and you be okay and also you know he felt that erm oh he have a thing about david blunkett introduce all these laws about gun own gun and things like that
S0650	mm
S0282	so
S0282	he just the french be the french be more grow up and reasonable about about erm you know erm not erm infantalising i suppose people or
S0650	mm
S0282	seek to be very parental about about how they live their live and what they have and what they do and
S0282	and so on but i don't i think the french be catch up with us in that regard actually
S0650	their inheritance laws be be bizarre
S0282	mm
S0650	erm you can't make a will in a way that you can here
S0282	no
S0650	i think be ridiculous
S0282	no cos you can't it things get inherit by your children don't they not by your spouse
S0650	er that's correct and and also you can't erm er just er er write a will say i leave all my property to a cats' home
S0282	no
S0650	or i leave all my property to my second son
S0282	yeah
S0650	not my first son and it doesn't matter if you put in the fact that you first son have make a million anything like that oh no the law have to operate
S0282	yeah
S0650	your
S0282	so it's a feudal then really isn't it or sort of
S0650	well it's dictatorial and it's a totalitarian be sort of
S0282	yeah
S0650	er however you wanna call it
S0282	yeah
S0650	er
S0282	but i suppose it's about you know perhaps it's about land perhaps it's about you know the family farm go down through the generations or something
S0650	mm i think er er er er i think it's a erm an intellectual approach i would say rather crudely that all french people suffer from the what i call the promise land syndrome
S0282	oh yeah
S0650	er if you they all quote rousseau at you
S0282	uhu
S0650	erm about every man be free and all that sort of nonsense and erm er they entirely they have this vision that they all have this vision of a perfect state where everybody be properly look after and as some people here say everybody have a prize
S0282	mm
S0650	and so on they don't stop to think about the practicalities of it and the result of that be that they're for example their er farm agricultural industry be chronically inefficient
S0282	mm
S0650	because none of the units be the right size
S0282	uhu
S0650	er they don't once you build up a a or you reach a what i think you call a critical mass on the farm for example you get the right amount of machinery and get it erm capitalise properly use properly so that it be worth spend money for example on a a forty thousand pound combine harvester and there's no point in have a piece of machinery like that if you've only get twenty acres
S0282	mm
S0650	but it once you get to the right level of say five hundred acres or might probably be a thousand acres in fact erm er then when you die they will say oh no that's all get to be split up again and so they they're constantly destroy the economic base of their agriculture
S0282	mm
S0650	it's weird
S0282	that be very weird isn't it
S0650	it be yeah
S0282	gosh i suppose they've get a lot of land though haven't they perhaps er perhaps they're not they haven't get the same sort of the the panic about it that we do cos we're always sort of say oh we're run out we're run out of land there's not enough room whereas france be very spread out and sometimes actually
S0650	it be yes
S0282	you look at the way the french sort of set things out and you think you're be very careless actually with your
S0650	oh that's that's
S0282	with your countryside
S0650	it's funny that you say that because erm french people come over here erm we've er take erm er like and her sister and so on down to and the thing that they always say be oh the countryside in england be manicure
S0282	mm
S0650	er er which i find weird actually because when you drive around er the suburbs of paris where there be garden or in normandy where there be good farm they look after them
S0282	yeah
S0650	beautifully
S0282	yeah
S0650	because they have this sense of style or
S0282	yeah
S0650	and everything have to be very presentable
S0282	yeah
S0650	erm
S0282	well even in the middle where there's very little and very few people
S0650	yes
S0282	when you drive across it's all
S0650	yes
S0282	it's all you know you it's not like be in america where you've get the badlands or wild quite wild country
S0650	yeah
S0282	that's not obvious that it belong to anybody it's all terribly cultivate
S0282	how strange gosh
S0650	i'm sure you read about the guy who be not allow to run a ski school
S0282	no no
S0650	erm his his mother erm finish up look after one of the departments in the in the pyrenees
S0282	uhu
S0650	and as a result of that he get the opportunity to ski right through i think two or three winter and get himself qualify as a ski instructor
S0282	uhu
S0650	but they won't allow for example be just as good if not better skier but he's not allow to instruct at all
S0282	because
S0650	because have hasn't go through the rigmarole of take all these exams
S0282	oh
S0650	and erm this that and the other and so on
S0282	mm
S0650	it's just childish really
S0282	well i don't know i i often think the french be fifty percent of them be bureaucrats and the other half be anarchists
S0650	yes that's just about true yes
S0282	and they kind of hold each other in a state of
S0650	yes yes
S0650	yeah yeah
S0282	my mother's definitely on er on the anarchic side actually
S0282	she's she go to some you know if you have the misfortune to go into a courtroom with her or something and you stand up when the judge come in my mother's sit there start to go i don't see why i should have to stand up for him he's only a human be like the rest of us
S0650	er at one point erm i'm i i i have a heart attack and erm i think while i while i be recover i couldn't work i will erm er er brush up my german so i go to college
S0282	uhu
S0650	and er in and er it it it's a i think it's a a college of further education or whatever they call it anyway
S0282	mm
S0650	er it's very the language language department be very well run the head of the language department be a french lady
S0282	mm
S0650	and her sister she introduce me to her sister her sister be the most joyous individual she be one of the anarchists
S0282	uhu
S0650	and you know erm in i think it be in nicaragua
S0282	uhu
S0650	erm or one of those central american erm countries they what do they call the can you remember what they be call
S0282	oh
S0650	contra something or other
S0282	yes yes yes yeah
S0650	mm anyway somehow she get herself into a position of edit the a book by one of these i wish i could remember what they're call erm they're rebel against the americans at any rate
S0282	yeah
S0650	erm and er i get to know her quite well and she certainly have anarchist tendencies and on one occasion the book be be publish in paris and so
S0282	mm
S0650	she er be go backwards and forward and er she be do a job i think also i dunno if it be in college but it be something to do with education anyway erm and er she go over to paris and she come back absolutely knackered and i say
S0650	what on earth you know oh she say there be a i say what she say yes we there be a very good on the champ elysees what would be what she mean be there be a demonstration
S0282	uhu
S0650	erm about something or other which something have do i say what be it all about it take me about two hours to discover that she really hadn't a clue what the demonstration be about
S0282	but she join in
S0650	she join in because it be a good party
S0650	literally literally
S0650	it's the most extraordinary performance to be fair at the end of it all she give me a sign copy of the book which have be publish
S0282	uhu
S0650	which be rather fun and it be all about smuggle things like bicycle
S0282	smuggle bicycle okay
S0650	yes
S0282	uhu
S0650	now into central america well i always think central america be er you know straight up and down no at all but
S0282	oh
S0650	the think of bicycle around nicaragua oh i wish i could remember what they be call these people
S0282	oh no i my brain have go as well now
S0650	but but the the sort of villain of the piece be a man call noriega i think
S0282	yeah that sound familiar
S0650	confindustria er confindustria for the italian erm cpi not that contra something or other
S0282	mm
S0650	anyway
S0282	mm
S0650	it be quite a interest experience
S0282	mm
S0650	er but i've get to know quite a lot of french people and really quite well and
S0282	you seem to have a constant stream of french people actually
S0650	we do yes because they like come over here
S0282	mm
S0650	they live in primark get our our
S0282	oh i know well the little girls we have at the who be all
S0650	yes
S0282	all from this school in bordeaux
S0650	yes
S0282	and we have a link with a school in bordeaux because when i be grow up erm there be a young woman call who use to come over in the holiday and look after us
S0650	yeah
S0282	and er she have a student she then go on to be a student and and
S0282	this one of her students say to her i need a placement in england so phone me up and say could you take a student and then since then we've be take two a year so we have we have this sort of who's a fellow trustee say erm oh yes i've just be look at the people who have be visit our website and look at the statistics and strangely we seem to have a lot of people in bordeaux look at our website
S0282	so i say yes it's all the students that go to a particular school research us
S0650	oh right
S0282	before they write to us and say can i come over and do two months' placement with you so erm so we have this ongoing link with erm with the students in bordeaux but they all come over here and erm they're very naive really about what to expect when they get to london and some of them have the most horrible adventure with
S0650	oh lord
S0282	rental properties and unscrupulous
S0650	oh lord yes
S0282	type and whatever
S0650	yeah
S0282	so and they're cos they're always try to economise by find you know find flats on the internet and you can't tell them that london's a big place and it's full of strangers and that that actually you can't trust anybody you meet on the internet and there's one girl
S0650	yes yeah
S0282	in particular who get awfully sting and erm and er somebody take about two thousand euros off her in advance
S0650	oh dear
S0282	er rental on a flat and turn out to be
S0650	god
S0282	a complete fake and the flat didn't exist and
S0650	oh heavens
S0282	i know
S0282	so they do they do actually fall er get themselves into trouble from time to time
S0650	yeah i spend a day bordeaux be a rather a nice place actually i think
S0282	oh i hate it
S0650	oh do you oh i
S0282	yeah
S0650	have very happy time there er when i be work in cathedral they send me to france to find out how they look after the cathedrals there
S0282	oh yeah
S0650	and er i be the the
S0282	they have a splendid cathedral
S0650	er bordeaux erm and the reason i be send to bordeaux be because it be english for such a very long time and they be actually keen to find out the the clerk of the work and his erm people in be keen to find out whether er there'd be any exchange of er craftsmen and technology between
S0282	oh
S0650	the british colony in bordeaux
S0282	yeah
S0650	and the er two particular cathedrals chichester and and erm salisbury
S0282	oh gosh
S0650	i don't know if you've have you be to chichester the the the point
S0282	mm no
S0650	but it's it's as the cathedral be very interest one one of the most quirky and interest things about it be that a man be in the nave with a box original box camera in eighteen sixty something when the spire implode
S0650	and he er he manage to take photograph of it actually happen
S0282	oh my god
S0650	er and and they're really primitive picture but you can see it's most interest things because you can see that once the er the inner cement so to speak mortar mortar start to crumble the weight er you it it go like that er right down
S0282	like a sodden pudding
S0650	yes
S0282	or something yeah
S0650	yes er
S0282	oh
S0650	yes really strange and the other thing that
S0282	i have no idea that have happen
S0650	erm the you can and well if you go there you will see the photograph
S0282	wow
S0650	at a tourist attraction
S0282	wow
S0650	and the other thing about er er chichester be that there be still to this day erm they have a a a proper international stone yard er an awful lot of er church in the south of england use quoin stone
S0282	oh do they oh
S0650	yes uhu er and if for example peterborough which be miles up er erm that's get
S0282	yeah no
S0650	a lot of french stone
S0282	yes absolutely i suppose
S0650	yes
S0282	it's quite near the eastern coast if
S0650	oh yes it be
S0650	it would go up the river nene in a
S0282	yeah
S0650	in a barge
S0282	so perhaps it be that so you sort of go up that side of the country to get to
S0650	any rate i i go er with the direct er direct by the clerk of the work in salisbury erm to the people in chichester and then i be send off to bordeaux to see whether there be any
S0282	yeah
S0650	any link
S0282	and be there
S0650	there be of craftsmen erm it's quite limit
S0282	uhu
S0650	erm there's no what i call what they quite heavy lift erm they didn't er pick up any erm constructive technology from er bordeaux
S0282	mm
S0650	no all of that come from er particularly from the abbey at st denis
S0282	uhu
S0650	actually erm and to canterbury and so on
S0282	oh right
S0650	erm
S0282	but craftsmen individual craftsmen be go
S0650	individual craftsmen who would go and do for example that they you must have see boss the stone boss
S0282	mm
S0650	which be beautifully carve and and some there be an interchange between craftsmen from france come through england
S0282	yeah
S0650	and vice versa
S0282	yeah
S0650	but erm otherwise no not
S0282	oh right yes
S0650	nobody er nobody know quite who be the engineer brain behind salisbury cathedral because it it it's it be an engineer feat
S0282	yeah
S0650	there
S0282	well then er they be just when you look at them and think about what the must have be involve in conceive them and build them then i mean well it must have take well it do take decades in some instance didn't it to put them up there's that wonderful erm william golding novel call the spire
S0650	oh yes that's right that's right absolutely you know
S0282	and i think it's an absolutely fantastic book
S0650	mm

S0650	mm
S0282	and he do a bite of dig around and find out a bite more about our architect and it be the only the only build he ever lead on so he be part of architectural team with erm william tite or something who be quite a famous architect of the time
S0650	yes
S0282	but he he only ever sort of lead on one build which be our build
S0650	really
S0282	but erm but you know he be erm he he get quite good press for it really in those days
S0650	mm
S0282	er but
S0650	but there be a street name after him
S0282	yes the one opposite
S0650	what be it call
S0282	road yeah
S0282	yeah
S0650	be it yes
S0282	yeah
S0650	er yes
S0282	so
S0650	but i've never find a i've never hear of any come across any other build that's put up by him
S0282	no
S0650	i suppose that's right
S0282	no he be
S0650	er
S0282	there be some there be other church he work on as part of a team for a boss but be his only his only sole creation really
S0650	yeah oh
S0282	so so that's it that be fun that be quite fun to find that out actually so we we this this open day thing be quite good for us it be it be
S0650	i'd notice you'd put some lovely erm print or draw up as you go in at the bottom of the lift
S0282	yeah yes
S0650	that's rather fascinate
S0282	yeah
S0650	or photograph of
S0282	no that's my little photographic expedition
S0282	all these photograph from the archive
S0650	yeah
S0282	there's quite a that quite an amaze of the spire of across the field because it be there
S0650	oh yes yeah
S0282	before all the house come so
S0650	yes yeah
S0282	so it's sort of stand on its own in the middle of an orchard or something
S0282	which be hard to imagine these days with er all that traffic rush past us
S0650	do you still have an annual art exhibition
S0282	we do
S0650	yeah
S0282	we do
S0650	great
S0282	so and actually who be the art teacher be now
S0650	yes
S0282	now run class on our build as well so so that's so i'm hop that we're go to reposition ourselves and be a bite more artistic have a few more kind of
S0650	oh that's good
S0282	kind of of that sort of class go on
S0650	yes
S0282	where people pay for it apparently erm
S0650	there'll be er er on the twenty ninth there'll be a girl erm there call
S0282	uhu
S0650	i'll introduce you to her she work for
S0282	oh yeah
S0650	erm
S0282	oh
S0650	and erm well you might find it quite a useful link i don't know
S0282	yeah
S0650	yeah
S0282	yeah
S0650	er because they've get a lot er er a large educational programme
S0282	yeah
S0650	on
S0282	i think you be try you there be somebody before wasn't there
S0650	yes there be yes there be
S0282	i mean years ago and didn't come off for some reason
S0650	mm
S0282	i can't remember what that be the
S0650	oh i think the reason it come didn't come off be cos i think i get ill
S0282	oh
S0650	erm erm and i have to postpone meet i've i've i've er do remember that actually
S0282	mm
S0650	and that's what happen
S0282	i think there might it be also there be something else as well i don't i think there be can't remember what the problem
S0650	i certainly arrange for somebody from the to talk to actually
S0282	yes
S0650	that i know that that do come off erm
S0282	oh i think but i think it might have be one of those things where there be one conversation and then one person say that i need to pass you on to another person and then as so often happen
S0650	yes
S0282	that's where it never quite
S0650	oh it
S0282	actually kind of come about
S0650	yes yes
S0282	despite good intentions on both side and i i think
S0650	yeah
S0282	the time the time cos of the time of the art competition or something it didn't work out i can't remember but erm no it's be it's be erm no we still do it and we still have our little french students help us out it's a way of kind of market without market really
S0650	well yeah mm
S0282	but as the open day be a way of market
S0650	mm
S0282	cos that i think you know it have limit i don't know how we've we market ourselves i think the best way be to have people in the hall and say you know oh what a lovely hall i think i might come back here
S0282	so so we're have all kinds of difficulties with er with er with the congregation again of course
S0650	oh dear in what way
S0282	well we be have an argument er there be the most surreal argument at the agm about the bollards because there be
S0650	outside the west end
S0282	yes
S0650	mm
S0282	because there be there be a few instants where the people who run the nightclub opposite be just take over the car park at night and there be a couple of er attack stabbings
S0650	oh lord
S0282	where the perpetrators be loiter in our car park and jump out on people in and
S0650	oh
S0282	stab them
S0650	dear
S0282	and then jump in the car and rush off and there be also lot of drug deal so we decide that that we be go to lock the bollards so we have a rather surreal conversation where we have a delegation from the church demand that they be allow to have a bollard please so give that we be report on the fact that our finance be up the creek at the time
S0650	mm
S0282	and then they turn up and say yeah but yeah but can please can we have a bollard please
S0282	so as usual a completely disproportionate response to er
S0282	so anyway so you've begin to when you retire you be go to sort of help the the the association round here but do you do your estate here get take over in the end by an or a whatever it be
S0650	yes what happen er be that er the council erm they er want to get rid of responsibility for all their freehold on what be originally the estate
S0282	uhu
S0650	and erm
S0282	i presume this be enough to bombsite or something
S0650	absolutely
S0282	or do they knock it down deliberately
S0650	no no
S0282	they didn't knock it down deliberately
S0650	no no no it be it be it be
S0282	thank goodness for that
S0650	flatten and er well what er what then happen be that er the tenant and residents association erm put together a a a i think they call it a shadow regeneration board
S0282	mm
S0650	erm and i er er they erm er select the they interview and er and then select a er house association house house trust erm and at that point erm it this er there be a meet of the tenant and residents association and a presentation be make by somebody from this shadow board and i start ask question and erm i be ask to join the board
S0282	uhu
S0650	and er er we be responsible for er put together a package er which cover all the function which er have be discharge by the council
S0282	right
S0650	to service their tenant on this estate and that be er the the term the legislation which provide for the transfer away from the council to a recognise house
S0282	mm
S0650	association and that have to be vote on
S0282	yeah
S0650	and there be a a a a ballot er base on the proposals which the this shadow board have agree erm and everybody mm by an an a marginal majority i don't think it be about twenty vote so to speak i two hundred and something erm they decide against it
S0282	oh
S0650	erm but yours
S0282	gosh
S0650	yours truly be i be rather surprise from talk to people because i think it would be pass on a nod almost
S0282	yeah
S0650	i discover that that the ballot have be rig
S0650	and that people have be go round erm er er er er say er to people who in in the two that's all shelter house
S0282	oh right yeah
S0650	at the far far end knock on the doors and say oh give us your erm er er vote er card and we'll put it in the ballot ballot box and erm
S0282	oh no
S0650	they'd they'd either be tell people how to vote or they'd just not be put the er paper in the ballot box
S0282	oh no
S0650	and the the the truth of it be that the electoral that the ballot be carry out by the i think it's call the electoral reform society
S0282	it be yeah that's our
S0650	and they have be so slovenly er they they should
S0282	have they really they should
S0650	oh yes
S0282	they're suppose to be the people who be the example of how to do this
S0650	they be not they be just lazy
S0282	really
S0650	idle and so we erm we we have to go to get to approach the minister of state who be a good lady call
S0282	uhu
S0650	erm and er with 's help erm yours truly write to and say can we please have a revamp and that be the agree the the department of the environment i think it be call
S0282	mm
S0650	ministry of house erm
S0650	they say yes and erm the second time round the offer make by erm metropolitan
S0282	mm
S0650	be accept
S0282	oh right okay
S0650	and then erm the offer be base on metropolitan spend twenty four million pound
S0282	yeah
S0650	on the regeneration of the estate
S0282	mm
S0650	erm and er er the the board the shadow board be er er give permanent er status so to speak and er it it have to allow for a a rotation in membership
S0282	mm
S0650	and i er volunteer to stand down erm after the first i think it be two years erm and er it it have erm mm we have approve the initial essential work programme
S0282	mm
S0650	the sort of urgent repair that need do and then i stand down but just before i stand down er they come up they discover there be er asbestos all over the place
S0282	oh no
S0650	yeah and erm they the health and safety people move in
S0282	oh
S0650	and say you've get to take all this asbestos out and it be blue or brown or pink or i don't know what what it be and er
S0282	the harmful kind
S0650	yeah it be the harmful sort yeah
S0282	oh no
S0650	erm and er er we be tell that we if we have this could have it do for free
S0282	yeah
S0650	erm and i say well that's fine but i i want want a contract and so on and i say no can't do things for free that it's not like they could do things
S0282	mm
S0650	and the be so slovenly and just generally uncooperative because they also at the same time erm be propose to redo redo the rooves
S0282	yeah
S0650	er of the house er which have get asbestos in them and so we which er which be freehold which we all say well if you're go to do redo this those er rooves can't you do our rooves as well they say oh no they say no and
S0650	one way or another i just get and we all get completely feed up
S0282	oh
S0650	with i'm not quite sure where the problem lay but at at a higher level in the local people because all the people we'd originally be deal with they suddenly they all resign they vanish and we get a lot of people try to run this replacement of the they be call fascia board where the asbestos be er of didn't know their way round the estate they be er
S0282	oh how
S0650	er i think it it be very unsatisfactory the whole thing and er they'd be erm i'm out of it now but i i just get completely brown off
S0282	no i'm not surprise really
S0650	er er it be really tiresome
S0282	not surprise and i think some of these that some of these house associations claim they overreach themselves and
S0650	yes
S0282	get out of their depth
S0650	yes
S0282	with all this stuff
S0650	well they've get very weak management
S0282	mm
S0650	and they don't pay attention to detail they they send us round at the end of the the replace of the fascia board they give us all erm a a letter er say this be what we've do and it it it literally do not make sense it
S0650	and so we have have to you know er er we get to issue new letter and then erm it's in in the case of our house erm and it say that they have replace the vent axia erm the extractor fan they hadn't
S0282	no
S0650	and er er and in one of the house
S0650	two two or three down that way erm fortunately er the the freeholder erm er notice the work be be do when she be not aware it be about to be do and she she'd find that the guy who be do the work have muddle up the number
S0650	and he be do work which should have be for
S0282	oh
S0650	number eighty four
S0282	yes
S0650	on number eighty three and number eighty four you know when you come up the street and the house
S0282	yes
S0650	on that side be completely different
S0282	yes
S0650	there's a small dock which belong to the council
S0282	yeah
S0650	that's number eighty four and they're
S0282	oh
S0650	early victorian house and he
S0650	should have be do a job on that on the house over there
S0282	yes
S0650	and he be do try to do that sort of just didn't work at all
S0282	no
S0650	er
S0282	i remember once get a free boiler service like that
S0650	mm
S0282	when somebody be suppose to be at somebody else's house but it's not very satisfactory be it really that's bizarre isn't it so erm have you live here since it be new
S0650	since what
S0282	since this this be new this house
S0650	no no the the house be build in nineteen sixty seven
S0282	uhu
S0650	and er erm they be privatise by wait a minute that's not no nineteen seventy six that's
S0282	mm
S0650	seventy six and then mrs thatcher introduce the er sale of council house and er er about er i think it's actually over fifty percent of the house here have be privatise
S0282	oh right
S0650	yeah and this house be erm the tenant be a builder erm and he make various change erm include disconnect the house from the communal heat
S0282	oh that's
S0650	erm which in fact be a erm a a really sensible thing to do
S0282	uhu
S0650	but it mean that we have extraordinary pipework erm stick up into the kitchen this wall be about where you be now
S0282	oh right
S0650	where you and i be now and there there be a a curious pipe connection stick up into the middle of the kitchen it be really very very odd indeed
S0282	oh
S0650	but the the the discontinuance of the communal heat system be one of the erm job which er be suppose to do erm and er they make a horlicks of that too they didn't realise that half of the estate be erm on the front level
S0282	oh oh really
S0650	and where that be the case the erm the house be build in pair in fact
S0282	mm
S0650	and underneath that wall and not under this this wall but under the next wall erm there be a a er like a er a solid wall
S0282	uhu
S0650	so that no water can pass through one to the other
S0282	oh right
S0650	and
S0282	okay
S0650	erm just pip and that's all and then the the wall here be be it isn't any longer but it be relatively it have a big hole in it in fact
S0282	mm mm
S0650	erm and there be a tunnel which you can er go through er which be build originally erm as a er er like a a test it's for it's you need to find out where the heat could go where
S0650	where there be other pip and so on
S0282	yeah
S0650	but when they when discontinue the communal heat they didn't realise that er these wall must be replace otherwise if there be a a the i think it's call the river
S0282	oh the right it's here as well be it
S0650	and if if there's if there's a very high tide
S0282	yeah
S0650	the water back up
S0282	yeah
S0650	and the the erm
S0650	the the these er chamber cos they're they're not really like cellars you can't get into them
S0282	no
S0650	other than by go through a manhole
S0282	right gosh
S0650	erm any rate erm it be just another area where be be be really stupid and another thing they do
S0650	which infuriate fortunately we weren't involve erm they be charge people for erm electric light and heat hot water and heat
S0282	yeah
S0650	erm who who erm be not get any
S0650	er it's quite extraordinary and er
S0650	they they let us know that they be go to disconnect the communal aerial there's a communal erm er a television aerial on the top of
S0282	oh yeah yeah
S0650	erm and er we erm be send a note say this be go to be disconnect and we didn't think we we be on it and so we ask them to check and they say oh no you're not on it and then there be a long pause and then about six months later erm our er television suddenly stop work and we find that they they'd when
S0650	whether we be connect to it or not i don't really know but anyway they'd cut through some wire when they be disconnect that
S0282	yeah
S0650	and cut through our television
S0282	oh
S0650	aerial wire
S0282	no
S0650	so we we sort of oh enough be a enough and we buy a a a saucer
S0282	yeah
S0650	and a lot of other people have similar buy saucers
S0282	yeah
S0650	but that's where have be very unsatisfactory they pay no attention to detail at all
S0282	no that's every exasperate isn't it
S0650	yes
S0282	very exasperate i mean be they they must be they sound as if they're more exasperate than in fact which
S0650	well by quite honestly they be actually because at least clean the streets
S0282	yes
S0650	and they also erm er offer us and give us a quarterly test inspection
S0282	oh yeah
S0650	so and the we have cockroaches or er whatever erm every quarter we could be certain that they would be extinguish or eradicate or
S0282	yeah
S0650	you know
S0282	that make sense to do it
S0650	and they
S0282	in advance doesn't it rather than
S0650	yes it do
S0282	wait till they've
S0650	absolutely
S0282	especially with these modern build where they've get
S0650	yeah
S0282	void and passages and things
S0650	yeah they
S0282	through the brickwork that you
S0650	yeah
S0282	they pop up everywhere but
S0650	yeah
S0282	have no idea
S0650	so our experience with have not be very happy i'm afraid
S0282	oh no that's
S0650	yeah
S0282	that's sad really oh dear
S0650	then erm there be er two councillors that be er on the the the it's call regeneration board and i get to know them one of them quite well one of them be a liberal chap and i dunno what happen he lose his seat or something and the other one be a a labour chap and he stay on and i get to know him quite well and he be quite a conscious councillor deal with local issue and so on
S0282	mm
S0650	he write to me and say would i sponsor him in the last round of local elections
S0282	mm
S0650	and i i say i just write back and say no way er he ask why and i say well a man who say that he's go to cap energy price must be mad
S0282	oh right
S0650	and say oh why i didn't know he be go to i it be it be the most awful experience with this guy who be
S0282	oh
S0650	you know er stand as a labour councillor hadn't a clue what the labour
S0282	oh right
S0650	their policies be
S0282	mm oh well
S0650	anyway there you go
S0282	oh
S0650	mm
S0282	i see
S0282	so oh it's a bite sad about the write do you finish that book that you be work on when you be
S0650	i've get up to i've get up to sixteen forty eight
S0282	right and how many how many
S0282	how much more have you get to go
S0650	er i'm erm er er er it go up to nineteen eighteen
S0282	right
S0650	and i actually have read up up to nineteen eighteen
S0282	mm
S0650	and it's just a question of sort myself out and sit down and and put something down on paper but
S0282	yeah
S0650	it take quite a long time to do that and it i do too lame and too lazy to go what you have to do be to go every day to the british library and
S0282	and do it
S0650	er because to make a a book worth read you have to contribute some sort of original view on subject
S0282	mm
S0650	and erm the i suppose er just at the moment it's actually interest because a whole lot of new material have come into the public domain erm whereas after the well the research work by one or two really erm well establish historians
S0282	oh
S0650	about the lead up to nineteen fourteen
S0282	mm
S0650	and why it happen
S0282	mm
S0650	erm and i be look at a lot of those book and they be erm very interest
S0282	okay
S0650	very interest indeed erm so i i shall go back to it and try and finish it off
S0282	mm
S0650	i think
S0282	you be right about general anaesthetics and things though i think you do get knock sideways don't you by these things that come along and you think you can bounce back and young people think they can bounce back perhaps they can when they're younger but it's just take longer
S0650	i think they can when they're younger yes i just find that after three hours in in the british library if you you stop for a sandwich at lunchtime and you go back and sit down at two o'clock half past two i'm
S0282	yeah
S0650	fall asleep
S0282	i know
S0650	but
S0282	that's very sad isn't it how what be it
S0650	well
S0282	i've never be there actually i mean to join and er
S0650	oh it
S0282	i believe i could join but
S0650	it's it i think it's superb actually
S0282	uhu
S0650	i think it's very good i i don't know what the er the the it's in two part erm there be some nineteen seventy five onwards
S0282	mm
S0650	and everything earlier than that and so erm er what's it call i i i think they call it a a antique or something like that no i can't remember what they call it anyway erm rare book and something erm i always work in that department
S0282	uhu
S0650	because the stuff that i've be look at be publish in the nineteenth century or eighteenth century and seventeenth century
S0282	uhu
S0650	erm and it's very well equip and the atmosphere be very you know you you you're not disturb
S0282	no
S0650	that's the beauty of the place be that it's quiet and er
S0282	studious atmosphere
S0650	a studious atmosphere
S0282	yeah that's nice i find
S0650	yeah and there's plenty of room and the staff be extremely helpful
S0282	mm
S0650	they're very helpful indeed
S0282	oh that's good
S0650	i be amaze in fact because erm one of the things that happen be that i i go to the spanish national archive in near valladolid
S0282	uhu
S0650	in a place call salamanca and erm to my horror when i get there i find nobody but nobody could speak english
S0282	ah
S0650	and i also
S0282	you need to go away from the coast in spain
S0650	er i be just that the there's get to be a er what surprise me even more there be no catalogue
S0650	erm other than the catalogue which have be write by some er well i suppose amateur in eighteen nineteen or eighteen twenty
S0282	oh
S0650	and but all
S0282	really
S0650	all the paper sort of period from fourteen seventy seven to seventeen fifteen they're all locate in this one place which actually make it very easy
S0282	mm
S0650	from the point of view of you know what you're look for be there
S0282	yeah
S0650	and and all the
S0650	earlier document i'd i'd not come across this before be not not mm well not in this form they be all in tube and these tube go right back to the seventeenth century
S0282	oh wow
S0650	erm and you ask for a i the the lady who be sort of erm i don't know if she be appoint to look after them or somehow she she take to look after me erm she couldn't speak english but she know that philip the second have be marry to bloody mary
S0282	uhu
S0650	which be what i be interest in
S0282	mm
S0650	and after talk to her a lot of write and draw and
S0650	use a dictionary mainly cos er there's no electronics there's no you can't there's you you can't use your erm laptop you can use an ordinary type
S0282	yeah
S0650	but you can't use it for research at all because there's nothing be be online
S0282	how extraordinary
S0650	and erm anyway
S0282	it have revolutionise things since this stuff
S0650	oh absolutely
S0282	when you put it online
S0650	absolutely this good lady erm she's she eventually she understand what i be interest in and she produce for me the inventory of erm vladimir's household
S0282	mm
S0650	erm from a visit of er of philip the second to
S0282	oh
S0650	this country and it be er rivet erm it be one of these things that have be roll up as if you
S0282	yeah
S0650	quite a long thing
S0282	yeah
S0650	and it list literally every member of the staff
S0282	yeah
S0650	and all their clothe
S0650	and all their food allowance
