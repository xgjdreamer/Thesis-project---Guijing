S0411	mm mm mm
S0417	you know they have their trials and he work very long hours

S0417	yeah
S0411	you know and they're they're really they've be together since they be teenagers
S0417	really
S0411	you know yeah yeah yeah and erm you know it's definitely have er have its rough patch but they're both really up front about when it have be tough

S0411	they've get load of friends they've get it's open house round at theirs
S0417	yeah yeah
S0411	you know they're real party people but they're very boundaried as well you know they've get two really lovely boys
S0417	yeah

S0417	yeah
S0411	you know it do have its up and down they have really work through stuff
S0417	yeah
S0411	and they've you know come out the other side
S0417	yeah
S0411	and that's what it's all about isn't it really
S0417	yeah cos i mean i i i don't know if i've ever really make a successful partnership i think maybe this be the closest and even
S0411	yeah yeah
S0417	how do you feel about that kind of partnership would you ever want one again or
S0411	if i do it would be very unconventional that's why it be very refresh to hear say what she say
S0417	yeah yeah
S0411	you know she say i do what i wanna do you know i do my thing
S0417	yeah
S0411	i don't answer to anyone and
S0417	yeah
S0411	you know he do his thing i do my thing and that's exactly the kind of thing i would want to do
S0417	yeah
S0411	i couldn't imagine have i i couldn't i know that i couldn't have a conventional relationship
S0417	yeah
S0411	where i be in somebody's pocket all the time where
S0417	yeah
S0411	you do everything socially with them where
S0417	yeah
S0411	you know come here there's no way i'd wanna drag some bloke around
S0411	to come and see you do you know what i mean it's just like fuck off be you still here
S0417	yeah i know what you mean
S0411	fuck off go and do something you know i couldn't i couldn't do that
S0417	yeah
S0411	and i know a lot of people do do it and it would drive me insane
S0417	yeah
S0411	it would drive me mad i would just say to someone just go and get a life just fuck off
S0411	and really get a life and i'll see you next week maybe if i've get time
S0417	yeah
S0411	you know so if er you know that's it's no coincidence that the longest relationship i've ever have be with and
S0417	yes
S0411	work silly hours upside down you know
S0417	yes
S0411	work in club run the arts club run work in pubs
S0417	yeah
S0411	and it work well because i'd i could do my thing i be at my most hedonistic at that time probably
S0417	yeah
S0411	just do load of pills
S0417	yeah
S0411	with all the gay guy
S0417	yeah
S0411	really out party
S0417	yeah
S0411	you know oh i'm gonna go to for six weeks see you
S0417	yeah
S0411	you know that's that's what work for me
S0417	also can you imagine look back on your life and have something like do in a way think i be only with that person i think that would make me feel
S0411	mm mm
S0417	kind of like oh god what be
S0411	suicidal
S0417	yeah what be my life
S0411	yeah
S0417	only about sort of one person about all sort
S0411	and i think there's so much rhetoric to make you believe that that's the right thing to do there's so much media there's so much bullshit out there to make you believe that that's what you should aim for
S0417	yeah
S0411	to only be with one person
S0417	yeah
S0411	you know talk to be one of the most interest and enlighten things about
S0417	oh yeah what do he kind of say
S0411	well he's nearly fifty
S0417	yeah
S0411	and he firmly believe he's definitely be er by his own admission in his own word you know in his twenties he be a bite of a ladies' man you know he have a child in his teens
S0417	be he do he
S0411	with yeah he when he be eighteen i think his daughter be bear and the mother be just seventeen
S0417	god
S0411	you know so he's definitely you know he's be around the block
S0417	yeah
S0411	and he he firmly believe from experience not just bullshit but from experience that
S0417	yeah
S0411	you that you should be not should be but it's more normal for most humans and he fully understand that some people like to be with one person for their whole life and that's fantastic but he think that you go through so many phase in your life that it's very very difficult for one person to weather those phase with you
S0417	yeah
S0411	and he feel that he's a vastly different person in his for example twenties to what he be in his thirties to his forties
S0417	mm yeah
S0411	because he feel that he's really grow and develop and change and not necessarily become a better or a worse person but be a completely different person and he feel that he really need different things
S0417	yeah
S0411	not necessarily women
S0417	yeah
S0411	but he's talk about women as well he er like he him see me he that that's a sort of particular phase in his life or whatever and he
S0417	yeah
S0411	at some point want to retire probably to the south coast and so therefore you know sort of
S0417	mm
S0411	see me and the south coast and that kind of thing but not it's not just about women but he he do think and also he's sort of say you know the whole original rhetoric of marriage be with one person be when people be die in their fifties and sixties and that make sense you know
S0417	yeah
S0411	you sort of get marry when you be twenty
S0417	yeah
S0411	and then you're gonna be dead by the time you're fifty but he's sort of say look
S0417	mm
S0411	i'm probably gonna live hopefully until i'm like eighty or something like that
S0417	yeah
S0411	there be no way that i will be the same person in my twenties to what i be in my eighties
S0417	yeah yeah
S0411	you know he want to do different things he's never really travel because he's spend so much time work and build up a property portfolio and do all his craft stuff that he do all his furniture upholster and
S0417	yeah oh do he do that
S0411	yeah yeah yeah
S0411	he's really interest he's a really amaze guy actually you know he's do
S0417	he do sound quite he's very nice to you isn't he
S0411	he's yeah he be he's but he's very unassuming
S0417	texting all the time isn't he
S0411	yeah constantly
S0417	yeah
S0411	but not in a kind of kind of way but it's just a constant dialogue
S0417	yeah yeah
S0411	all the time erm he's er he's a very interest person and he's get lot of ideas he hasn't really travel and he really want to travel
S0417	yeah
S0411	and that's another thing he like be around me because i've do a lot of travel and that really fit with with where his head be at at the moment and you know
S0417	yeah
S0411	i have a perspective on life that fit with his perspective on life at the moment in his current phase of his life
S0417	yeah yeah
S0411	and he and it be so interest because he say oh you know some people might look at me from the outside and say oh you're just have a mid life crisis and it's like and he say well if that's what a mid life crisis be then bring it on cos i'm really enjoy it you know
S0417	yeah yeah
S0411	and erm and i i just really like that because he talk through how he feel and you know he have actually think about what he's do he hasn't just sort of go oh yeah my wife be a bitch and so i
S0417	yeah
S0411	do you know what i mean he really talk about it and he will say that you know he still have an excellent relationship with his wife ex wife
S0417	yeah
S0411	and you know er she be a hugely important person in his life and still be
S0417	yeah
S0411	i mean his his best friend be her brother
S0417	yeah
S0411	you know because they've know each other for such a long time
S0417	oh really
S0411	yeah
S0417	god
S0411	they're a very very tight knit kind of family you know so er i i couldn't be with someone that be really awful
S0417	mm
S0411	about their ex about the mother of their children i couldn't be with someone that be
S0417	yeah
S0411	you know talk about a woman on that level
S0417	yeah i know what you mean
S0411	do you know what i mean he's have three children with them
S0417	i know
S0411	no i need i need to be around someone that show respect to their ex
S0417	yeah
S0411	and talk about them and he he he will mention sometimes that you know she do exasperate him sometimes around money there be lot of issue around money
S0417	yeah
S0411	and that's fine you know that's okay for him to mention that because i certainly have mention numerous time about my frustrations with
S0417	yeah yeah
S0411	but i talk respectfully about he talk respectfully about her
S0417	yeah
S0411	you know but i couldn't i couldn't imagine erm you know i it we do have a relationship we know we have a relationship and we've acknowledge that
S0417	yeah
S0411	but we don't talk about
S0417	it do sound like you've get something very you know he care about you doesn't he
S0411	yeah yeah and i care about him but
S0417	yeah
S0411	at the same time i don't have to have him here like i i do feel you know i do feel really really bad and i do really give myself a hard time about it actually er cos a couple of months ago he be go for quite a senior job cos he's quite senior at
S0417	oh be he
S0411	and yeah and he be go for erm a sort of more senior role
S0411	and he's be do this particular role for about fifteen years and have just kind of be coast in it
S0417	yeah
S0411	and he do talk to me quite a lot about it and because it's get quite big implications shift work as well cos it's do night staff and things like that
S0417	yeah
S0411	it's like manage a night team and things like that erm and i do a couple of mock interview with him i look over some things and do some mock interview and stuff and he get the job and he do he do sort of say
S0417	mm
S0411	oh you know a lot of that be down to you and i sort of go oh not really
S0417	yeah
S0411	but he he firmly believe
S0411	cos he hadn't have an interview for fifteen years
S0417	oh really
S0411	you know cos he'd just be in the one job
S0417	yeah
S0411	so he really need and i really help him because i'd recently have an interview and
S0417	yeah
S0411	you know and i really change cos he wasn't he be really self deprecate and it be just like you you can't you can't
S0417	yeah you can't can you in that kind of situation
S0411	you know so it's not like you know he just sit down and talk and i go yeah that be great it be a really big sort of process
S0417	yeah
S0411	erm but yes that's right but the day of his interview and it be a really big deal for him i forget it be his interview just forget
S0417	oh
S0411	i completely forget it be
S0417	and usually you're actually you're usually very good at remember
S0411	i do feel bad but another bite of me be think this be why i don't have a boyfriend
S0417	yeah
S0411	because i can't put a man here
