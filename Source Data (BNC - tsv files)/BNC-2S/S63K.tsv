S0144	so what be that exhibition like
S0024	yeah it be really good em load of dragonfly stuff never think that load of people would do like specifically don't apply art work just for that they'd do em glass mosaic eh big massive massive eh glass mosaic dragonfly which walk over to and go i can do that
S0024	it's easy which it be in theory but you've get to have the patience and you've get to have the time and you've get you know and then you've get to be meticulous about every part you do you've get to find all the materials and the glass and the this and the that i mean it might be in theory yeah smash a mirror and put put all the piece in but in theory yeah but time wise and dedication wise it's just not go to happen for me i don't know
S0144	yeah i know mhm yeah yeah what and say that to the person who have make it
S0024	no we be just walk along look
S0144	oh
S0024	and then ah and then eh there be some really good photos close up photos don't know how they get such clear photos it's amaze
S0144	yeah
S0024	really clear close up photos of dragonflies beautiful eh then there's some pottery like lovely
S0144	what dragonfly pottery
S0024	well no lovely make em bowl and plat
S0144	with dragonflies on it
S0024	all this specific decoration yeah well it just have some paint a paint pattern with a dragonfly and a flower eh it be quite tastefully do like just one little a little tiny dragonfly on a white background yeah it be quite tastefully do be nice and then there be paint and just every single i mean a quilt with like dragonfly make out of stitch
S0024	it be everybody kinda tweak their own stuff to gear towards the theme be nice
S0144	right so
S0024	yeah but there be some somebody have put up these kids' they be like kids' picture they be just like crayon draw and that to me isn't art because i could seriously i could sit down and do that you know
S0144	yeah
S0024	and not even put that much effort in you know those kind of draw that you look at and somebody
S0144	yeah
S0024	and they're always the highest price ones as well
S0024	it's kinda like a weird style of art but really it's just maybe they spend age do it but it do just the end result look like a kid have draw with some crayon so it's a shame
S0144	so why why be it all about dragonflies
S0024	em the gallery be call dragonfly gallery and like this woman oh we speak to the owner cos we speak to the people do it ask to be put back on the list and uh they uh what she say oh she she come out to to visit us cos they go in and say oh yes there's an artistic family here cos of me and dad sell it up a bite and ah talk to the other to the person who do the exhibition

S0144	aww
S0024	so she didn't have any of her stuff on

S0144	yeah yeah how much stuff be there be it a big place
S0024	no it's only little place but enough enough to let me see well it's split into two so i guess you've get one wall two wall two and a half wall and then the other side the half of the other two wall and then bits in between and table with people have make little dragonfly earrings and jewel and you know necklaces and stuff

S0024	yeah from the top yeah
S0144	yeah
S0024	all the way down
S0144	let's in cos the trouble with those old build be that they're so dark so you need big windows like that don't you
S0024	yeah
S0144	surprise they're allow plan permission to be honest
S0024	yeah this be what i be say to why aren't her and ray buy land with a barn on it or with a shed on it even you know some sort of thing that then i'm lose
S0144	yeah well we only walk this way every day
S0024	oh
S0024	yeah surely it would make much more sense to buy something with even if it be just a tiny shed like build on it already wouldn't that increase the chance of plan permission later you know it's get a shed on it so you know
S0144	i've no idea how it work
S0024	i don't know meadowland
S0144	i think so though if it's get some kind of structure on it already
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah well i hope it go alright for them
S0024	yeah me too

S0144	yeah yeah which pub oh the pub
S0024	you know you get twitchy and put your arm i'll tape your hand down to your side
S0024	no problem we haven't even view any of the land so it's not like you're gonna make any bid on it blindly would ya
S0144	dunno
S0024	well we wouldn't have any deposit let's not even take a deposit with like this not take any any money or anything just
S0144	be it just land be that
S0024	ah it's all sort it's no it's one of the uh property auction so it's land and property i've have a look at a couple that they're sell there
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah on the website we could have a look if you want but we're not buy just look
S0144	i know we're not buy god don't worry i won't buy a house without tell you
S0024	i'm surprise they haven't go to view some more land but they just fell in love with this one haven't they we still need to find dad that water table thing
S0144	plane
S0024	yeah i
S0144	well don't they need to know that before they buy it
S0024	yeah they will
S0024	yeah they will
S0144	how be they gonna find that out
S0024	there's suppose to be a big package come through their door with all of the information about the land
S0144	okay
S0024	the the legal pack
S0144	okay
S0024	cos you have to read the legal pack before you buy it don't you or you should
S0144	or you should do
S0024	the whole it's quite big i think these legal pack
S0144	yeah do they have to pay for it
S0024	ah don't think so
S0144	really what you can just get any property and get a legal pack for it if it's up for sale
S0024	don't know i don't know well how can they charge you for it that's that won't be very fair
S0144	well can't see how they can just give it out quite expensive wouldn't it
S0024	yeah i suppose yeah dunno maybe the auction pay for it for the legal pack cos they get their commission maybe it just come off of off the auction fee
S0144	well i think if anyone have to pay for it it would be the seller
S0024	yeah
S0144	be that a sparrow
S0024	mm yeah i don't know i'm gonna go i think it's next thursday
S0144	next thursday
S0024	yeah
S0144	okay
S0024	i think it's in the afternoon so i think i'd just wander down to
S0144	oh next thursday we might know if we're go or not
S0024	yeah yeah might do that would be a shocker wouldn't it i think i'll be i'd be shock and surprise and go oh no now i haven't get enough time to do all this stuff that i say i be gonna do
S0144	yeah
S0024	well if it's not a positive answer by next week i'm gonna really lose heart and although chip in on their land and go and live over there
S0024	we'll chip in em they always they always kinda land on their feet in the end i just hope they make this this be a big decision massive massive
S0144	yeah once they have get his they won't be able to leave the country again
S0024	no this be what they want though
S0144	it's get serious get to the serious stage aren't we
S0024	mm mm
S0024	yeah
S0144	no more piss about
S0024	mm she she have this dream of have a little house just like at home you know somewhere you love to be somewhere you can have a few animals and do a bite of garden and potter about and somewhere where you really love to be
S0144	yeah
S0024	but with with this build a house lark it's not gonna happen for
S0144	no
S0024	ten years
S0144	yeah at least
S0024	i mean i don't get it i i say slowly slowly
S0144	well i can see where they're come from like i mean first of all they want an investment that's gonna store it's wealth which land be a great way to do that
S0024	mhm
S0144	don't think house be necessarily good at the moment because they be so inflate
S0024	no
S0144	but land be
S0024	yeah
S0144	like what they're look at to see the idea
S0024	and it could really work out it could like just like the laws could change or the land suddenly they're allow to build on it
S0144	yeah yeah but it's a it's a long term investment
S0024	mm
S0144	and it's not somewhere where you'd be able to call home for a good ten years
S0024	yeah
S0144	at least and i shouldn't think they'd be able to re sell it
S0024	see that's the thing i think be ready to move onto the land
S0144	be he
S0024	well he they've move to their flat and they're in a flat stay with friends until they get the land
S0144	yeah so be they be they gonna live in tent
S0024	no reckon they can live on the land for forty days of the year em
S0144	yeah
S0024	but what and i be say you can't you can't go and just start camp straight away cos the neighbour be gonna be like oh my god what's happen
S0144	oh yeah exactly
S0024	there's a
S0144	specially if there's a what how many of them four
S0024	mm four
S0144	yeah so that's gonna be a couple of tent like big tent
S0024	yeah
S0144	like straight off soon as soon as it's be sell it's gonna raise some eyebrows isn't it
S0024	and if the five of them be cook their tea and stuff like that
S0144	yeah i mean the neighbour will think a couple of gypsies will have move in
S0024	it will until yeah exactly they're gonna be like oh they sell the land and suddenly there's these people camp on there
S0144	yeah
S0024	um they where where be the owners they won't immediately think that they're the owners
S0144	yeah exactly so i mean they'll tell the police
S0024	mm they could do
S0144	and then that'll be a record of them be on the land and then they've get forty days from that moment haven't they so
S0024	well i don't know i don't know if you can scatter your time there and back
S0144	oh what leave for a day and then come back again
S0024	huh
S0144	like do a visa run or something
S0024	yeah
S0024	yeah as long as you've get another address eh oh i don't know i don't know but be say if like they have kid they can't live on the land while they have kid cos you're not allow an address
S0144	but i mean you need a residents
S0024	you won't have an address until you've build a house
S0144	right
S0024	so you can't kid can't live in a caravan anymore unless you're on a caravan site with an address because otherwise they can't go to school

S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	and we don't want to keep feed them oh you gotta think about this and think about that even say to me the other day oh i want to stop think about the bad things that could possibly go wrong
