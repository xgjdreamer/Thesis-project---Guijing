S0509	yeah so i've still get lot of homework to do
S0510	oh dear
S0509	yeah
S0510	and not many days before you go back
S0509	no well i say homework it's just revision
S0510	mm
S0509	erm but yeah and it but today even i've get to do some more ted hughes
S0510	oh okay what be you what revision do you need to do on ted hughes
S0509	i need to analyse more of the animal poems cos i need to have read and know a bite about all of those and i need to find link between them so i can talk about the collection in a wider context in in my mock
S0510	oh okay well that might make him a bite more interest for you
S0509	oh my god i be analyse animal poems the other day and oh it be just interminably dull
S0509	ah
S0510	ah
S0509	i can't i can't stand it it's just he's just oh the pike do this it's like oh good for the pike
S0509	i don't care the only good animal poem i read be call the bee god and that be because it be about sylvia plath because it be from birthday letter
S0510	oh right okay
S0510	erm and i be like oh this be interest oh it's from birthday letter that'll be why then
S0510	so be you tell me that your other poems like pike or whatever don't have any hide mean or message
S0509	oh i'm sure they do
S0510	but you just haven't
S0509	they be not very interest ones
S0509	because he's all about like erm be connect to nature and stuff
S0510	mm
S0509	and er it's it's about you know glorify how great these animals be and how great their connections to the real world be whereas we're all like da da da and things
S0510	right
S0509	like the jaguar be quite
S0510	like do you find it disconnect
S0509	yeah
S0510	yeah
S0509	the jaguar be quite good because that's about that's get all like this prison imagery and then it's all really good but
S0510	right
S0509	some of it some of it's a bite a bite dense it just feel a bite a bite much for this animal
S0510	right right a bite over the top
S0509	yeah it's like okay i get it but you're give me too much stuff to wade through here to get at what you're the like the deeper mean of it you know
S0510	right right whereas if you be for instance an american indian and you read that poem it might come to life quicker and
S0509	maybe
S0510	and be more reveal
S0509	yeah
S0510	because of their connection with animals and the importance of animals
S0509	mm yeah perhaps
S0510	whereas we we
S0509	also if they you know like poetry
S0510	be it as a poet be he a rhythmic poet or what what kind of
S0509	yeah kind of sometimes
S0510	right
S0509	he just play around with stuff he he tend to have like quite a strict form though
S0510	do he yeah
S0509	yeah although the the crow poems be more like experimental and out there but
S0510	right
S0509	and they be interest but this be not
S0510	no what's his set form tend to be then
S0509	oh he have like different form for different poems
S0510	oh i see
S0509	but they tend to like er like a lot of poets will like break form for effect
S0510	right
S0509	whereas he be a more traditional poet
S0510	right right yeah
S0509	so yeah yeah
S0510	mm
S0510	have you study any sylvia plath yet
S0509	no i think we do next year though
S0510	oh that'll be interest
S0509	yeah i've get an anthology that i think belong to miss
S0510	oh really
S0509	and i've i've somehow get it upstairs because i think she lend it to me once and er it's get all her annotations in it and things like that
S0510	oh interest
S0509	yeah
S0510	mm
S0509	so that will be fun
S0510	yeah
S0509	oh i've just click my hip
S0510	oh be that what that that be
S0509	that's what that be
S0510	oh my goodness girl you be break down
S0509	yeah i say oh it didn't hurt at all
S0509	it be like oh
S0510	yeah it be
S0509	oh that's strange
S0510	there be an unexpected sound come from my body that must hurt
S0509	yeah basically
S0509	oh
S0510	oh oh woah so revision
S0509	yeah
S0510	it's it's crazy really if you think about it that you know you go through what the last two years and it just seem to be nonstop revision and then
S0509	i know and now i've get another five years
S0510	yes and then you think you know okay finish school finish revise for all those exams and you literally have just finish your second term
S0509	yeah
S0510	and you you're already go into a another exam
S0509	it's the middle of year it's the middle of the year in term of exams
S0510	but it's literally well it's three months in
S0509	yeah but then yeah so
S0510	less than three months in
S0509	well it's september october november december no it's four months by the time i go back
S0510	well that's true yeah it be yeah yeah yeah
S0509	and then you've get january february march april and then may i start have exams
S0510	god it's mad isn't it it's just round after round you'd've think it's like give some leverage here
S0509	oh and do feel like important because they be go to affect university offer
S0510	yeah no i know
S0510	but you know your your other exams be important as well
S0509	yeah but do oh it's so annoy how many people after all that will be like i've hear so many time people go but gcses don't matter that much and like older older people
S0510	mm
S0509	who've who be in uni or whatever i mean they don't
S0510	well they don't if you haven't if you haven't do very well in them and you've manage to scrape through in your a level yeah
S0509	no but even yeah other people oh oh there's like it's weird because there be a big sort of competition between when you be at you're at school people go you've get to get these gcses because
S0510	yeah
S0509	they stay with you for the rest of your life
S0510	yeah
S0509	they be super important and then once like once you be out people will be like gcses don't matter that much a level be more important
S0510	yeah but they matter in in the greater scheme of things don't they
S0509	but yeah yeah but like it's weird that kind of contrast between
S0510	how quickly yeah as well yeah
S0509	yeah it kind of switch to people be like that
S0510	it's almost like oh they have to say how important they be otherwise you would never get through school you know you'd never you'd never bother kind of thing but i mean they be important in term of the ground that they give you for
S0509	oh yeah no i think they be important but it's just a bite like
S0510	yeah
S0509	oh well just all that work and then you get
S0510	yeah but you're you're the one that's go to have on your cv or whatever you know ten a star a
S0510	er gcses
S0509	yeah
S0510	which count for a lot actually which say a lot you know it's er yeah
S0509	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0510	so when you come to do your exam entries and you get your ucas point your you know you get your
S0509	yeah yeah yeah
S0510	point be equate from your exam
S0509	yeah
S0510	result they be just on your a level
S0509	i don't actually know
S0510	you see that would be interest to know
S0509	yeah i do wonder because i look it up once
S0510	yeah
S0509	i don't know because you do like if you look at erm the sheet you get i'm sure it tell you how many ucas point all your grade be worth for gcse
S0510	mm
S0509	but i don't know if they count them when they be
S0510	yeah well
S0509	do stuff like if you go to a university league table it will often tell you the erm the average amount of ucas point an entrant there have
S0510	right
S0509	and i don't know whether that include their gcse point it must do because some of them be so high like
S0510	it must do yeah well there you go yeah yeah so therefore you know you break that down
S0509	yeah
S0510	they do count
S0509	yeah yeah but
S0510	i know you do you know that anyway
S0509	yeah
S0510	and you believe that anyway
S0509	yeah
S0510	but you know for all those doubters out there
S0509	yeah but erm yeah but like but universities when they be ask for entries they don't go by ucas point
S0510	no no no they say a minimum of whatever at a level don't they
S0509	yeah
S0510	yeah
S0509	and sometimes like at least grade b in english or whatever you be study
S0510	yeah uhu
S0509	but erm yeah what be i gonna say oh personal statements as well
S0510	oh they be very important aren't they
S0509	they be like
S0510	for your applications
S0509	yeah
S0510	so be they go through that at college
S0509	not yet i think they will do
S0510	i think they will be yeah
S0509	yeah and will be on it cos like
S0510	oh yeah yeah
S0509	and i'll have to do it like i'll have to start on it over the summer
S0510	right
S0509	and then get feedback from teachers and stuff when i go back
S0510	that's good that's good
S0509	yeah
S0510	and erm the fact that you've get extra input from as well be go to be really helpful yeah
S0509	yeah it's good yeah
S0510	so yeah you see when when i go for my uni place i do it last minute i be absolutely last minute because i wasn't go to
S0509	hadn't the term like already start or something
S0510	yes it have it have so er i i know i must have do a personal statement but i can't for the life of me think what it you know
S0509	i be brilliant take me
S0510	so i be yeah i be i kind of miss out on a lot of that stuff i reckon you know the the stress of all of that
S0509	yeah because you be just like well let's just try it
S0510	let's just chuck it in and see what happen erm and it really be very late well it must have be september that i do it so i be really lucky to get a place
S0509	yeah like how
S0510	but i do have a recommendation from my
S0509	yeah
S0510	my tutor who be good friends with the head of school
S0509	who be your tutor where be they from
S0510	it be er erm and actually he go on to teach at the uni as well
S0509	yeah but how do you know him
S0510	he be my er tutor for my hnd my multimedia hnd because i do a two year
S0509	oh i think you be talk about get into your hnd
S0510	oh no no no no i be talk about my university place at
S0509	what be your university place for
S0510	multimedia
S0509	what be your hnd where where do you where do you do your hnd
S0510	oh i do it at college
S0509	i don't even remember that
S0510	you know in road you use to go to nursery there
S0509	that's probably why i don't remember it there
S0510	yeah so i'd
S0509	oh it be all just one thing for me
S0510	yeah no they be completely different institutions and erm well the thing be i you're right though i be quite late in apply for my college course as well i because we be live here in
S0509	yeah
S0510	and erm i'd already start a college course in
S0509	oh
S0510	it be the first year that they ever do it it because it be you know multimedia it be all new and excite
S0509	yeah
S0510	erm this be er it must have be ninety eight nineteen ninety eight and erm i think we'd just have we just have no it be before you then oh maybe it be ninety seven because you be bear ninety nine
S0509	yeah
S0510	yeah i don't know it be before you be bear anyway i start erm a hnc in multimedia and it be the first year that college have ever do this course and they be link to the university of
S0509	uhu
S0510	and i think have only just run it the year before erm and it be so new anyway i be a few months in and daddy get very ill with his eye and it all it be just really bad time
S0509	mm
S0510	and er no it must be ninety nine oh i don't know anyway it be very bad time so i pull out and actually the course itself it be alright but it wasn't that brilliant so that be so i pull out in the december and then we have erm you be already bear so it be already ninety nine er we have a holiday in didn't we
S0509	yeah
S0510	when you be a baby you be a few months old er and we decide it would be really nice to move to and then we get this opportunity because daddy have a pension that come up er there be a company he use to work for in london that he pay into a pension for a short amount of time and we find out that he could actually cash in this pension because he be disable early so it mean that suddenly within a year less than a year of us sort of talk about it because we have go in the summer
S0509	yeah
S0510	that you be bear and it be like we could actually do this we could move to and then we get and look out for us and then in the june we move and i be email this guy at college because i i saw you know before we move there
S0509	yeah
S0510	that they have a multimedia course and he turn out to be my course tutor
S0510	erm and he be really you know passionate about the course it be
S0509	yeah
S0510	the first year they be run it as well and er we have a really nice bite of correspondence and he be like well just when you get to come and see me even if it's the summer because i will still be in college yeah
S0509	around yeah
S0510	so i just pop down to see him one day after we'd move in the summer
S0510	it be really informal and obviously i have to do all the you know the obligatory bits the form fill and all the rest of it but it be kind of so casual
S0509	yeah hop on board
S0510	er and and like you know his interview of me be really more a tour of the facilities and you know just show me things and just chat really really erm really nice and er i get he be so passionate about it all so enthusiastic and it be so different to the way they teach it in
S0509	right
S0510	and the biggest thing be that they have the equipment
S0509	yeah
S0510	they have a full mac studio they have all the software software that you know we only barely touch on in and they didn't have all the macromedia suit and and it be just woah
S0510	what a surprise the fun fair
S0509	yeah it be like woah this be like really proper this be go to be kick it you know and so then i start in the september but i have to go through all the the grant process and all the rest of it so there be a lot of that summer when we first arrive there be a lot of stuff i have to sort out for start in the september but erm and get your nursery place sort and all the rest of it you know
S0510	yeah
S0509	so erm so that be great so one of the tutor that be then on that course erm he oh he he be a smart guy anyway when i decide last minute after i'd already finish my i start a hnc which be a part time it be only like i don't know fifteen hours a week or something and it be a lower qualification than a hnd but sort of two thirds of the way through that first year i be enjoy it so much and time you know
S0509	mm
S0510	everything be work out in term of look after you and kind of all
S0509	uhu
S0510	and it be all really fit into place i think oh blimey and my my tutor as well be like you know you could do the hnd you should just kind of go for it really
S0509	mm
S0510	and erm so i ask if i could transfer then and i transfer to the hnd so i literally have load of catch up to do at the end of that first year to get up to the standard of the
S0509	yeah
S0510	first year hnd and i i think i do a project as well over the summer just to to kind of get it all in
S0509	yeah to get into it yeah
S0510	yeah erm and then when so i'd already transfer two thirds of the way through to the hnd
S0509	mm
S0510	and then the second year do that and then at the end of that my erm i i didn't know what i want to do actually i be a bite i be at a sort of crossroads
S0509	yeah
S0510	really for various reason things that be happen and erm and then in the summer i just think oh god i'll just go for it i because i never really be that keen on do a degree it wasn't until i think oh i will just just get out there and get work and
S0509	mm
S0510	you know and then i can't remember the exact think process but there be a lot of stuff go on and so it mean that it would probably be worth my while carry on with study and see how far i could get
S0509	mm
S0510	so it literally be yeah say he'd put a word in for me to the head of the department and try and get me in to see him for an interview so i do and i have to take my portfolio in and and just sort of you know present it and everything and er do i start there and then that day i don't know i can't remember oh well actually i i get enrol that day
S0509	ah
S0510	i literally get one of his er head of department to take me through everything like a fast track i go through erm oh what do they call it admissions and
S0509	yeah
S0510	you know all the rest of it and er it be all do in a kind of day i mean i'd have to before i have the interview with i'd have to put various statements and i'd have to fill out
S0509	yeah
S0510	various you know form
S0509	form
S0510	bits but yeah i be certainly fast track through at the end of that day i be
S0509	you must have be good
S0510	yeah well thank yeah so yeah crazy really
S0509	yeah
S0510	absolutely crazy but yeah but it all work out
S0509	good
S0510	in fact i think i actually i do i actually start my college day that day as well because the first lesson that i have be in a group project they be do erm i can't remember which lesson it be but basically they be make each group have to make a game or a a game intro
S0509	mm
S0510	and so you have we be work with other team so we be work with people who be on the sound engineer degree people who be on the graphic design degrees so they'd mix you know the students
S0509	right
S0510	up to produce a team multiples to do a game so i literally walk into this lesson they'd already have a group form but suddenly there i be i think it be the second lesson if you like
S0510	erm and i be just put on this group
S0509	throw in the deep end
S0510	and it be like oh er you know and it be a bite awkward for the group because they'd already figure out what they be do
S0509	what they be do
S0510	but it turn out to be really good and it be with you know
S0509	ah
S0510	irish erm and in the end we there be four people in the group me include one be er no actually five one of them pretty much drop out as soon as it start i never get to meet them that be the sound guy erm there be a 3d game guy that be just so flaky incredibly flaky erm and then there be one other i think he be the graphics guy and again he the graphics guy actually i think drop out of the course be it be it no maybe it be the sound guy he drop out of the course graphics guy i think we might have meet him once and he never do anything and then you know he just in the end it be just three of us in the group
S0510	so two multimedia students and a 3d guy whereas other team you know
S0509	have graphics and sound
S0510	yeah so we be try to and i be try to you know cover for the sound and the graphics and all the rest of it
S0509	yeah
S0510	which be fine because we end up do load of sound in the studio at home we be able to record lot daddy help out
S0509	ah
S0510	you know with set it up for us
S0509	yeah
S0510	so that we could just produce our sound sample and effect and everything
S0509	yeah
S0510	erm it work out really well erm the 3d graphics guy be as i say very flaky and he let us down at the eleventh hour so he'd be go on and on that he have all these er animate 3d graphics sort for us at all these different intro point and he keep say you know it's alright it's okay and we be like be you sure you don't want any help be you sure you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	and he be like no no it's alright you know i'll i'll have it do for when we need it so this be so many months in and we saw he he keep throw this little erm
S0509	bits
S0510	carrots if you like of just er static image frame take from his 3d render because 3d render take forever to render you know and er so it be like oh yeah you know so i i think he just keep feed us with those but all along he be a million miles away from finish and then it get to literally the night we be pull it altogether the next day we be present it he didn't turn up with the goods he he bail out on us and and i really we have start which you know a while before plan b start a plan b in case he just doesn't deliver er so we have something up our sleeve that we could kind of pull out in case but of course it be right at the end he be still
S0509	yeah right at the
S0510	say right until that night no don't worry i've get them it's fine so we work through the night just put stitch together some extra stuff that we kind of have in in the bag that we then
S0509	yeah
S0510	jazz up a bite animate stuff that need to be that we'd do from 2d graphics rather than 3d graphics
S0509	yeah
S0510	and erm i think i go home she live up in and i think i go home about five o'clock in the morning er and then we have a couple of hours sleep and we be due to meet back i think ours be one of the first presentations that have to be do
S0509	you would have think they'd give you a bite of leeway
S0510	well they didn't know do they at that point but erm so literally we'd write the disc that we be present it on at her house i mean we'd test it and all the rest of it and it be fine
S0509	i be gonna say do you test it
S0510	however we then have to put it on the uni macs and play it and there be something that we hadn't notice because we be so tire probably er to do with a couple of the link through the game that weren't work and i'm not kid you i be literally work until second before we be present fix them
S0509	oh my god
S0510	we literally we have fifteen a fifteen minute window where we realise oh
S0509	oh no yeah
S0510	it's not work and like i just go into er i don't know what mode i go into
S0509	you just bypass like worry and stuff and just
S0510	yeah yeah yeah
S0509	just into that mechanic just do it mode
S0510	it be exactly that you've get it spot on and er and so be sort of sit there and i just begin right okay so now we need to do this and i be just talk it through and do it and like can you get me this and can you can you put that on you know second to spare we'd do it however there be one little glitch in there that i hadn't be able to mend but i'd say to right okay hopefully we'll be alright i'll just talk my way through this one i'll manually do this bite myself as i'm talk so they won't try it out and i know how to connect it up there be some pathway that wasn't quite right and it and it work
S0509	oh my god
S0510	it be just mad erm and the fact that we'd have to just present it ourselves and we have no other help we get a like equivalent of a first for it for our group project
S0509	yeah cos you'd just have so many trials group project more like duo project
S0510	yeah
S0509	oh my god well like well like the the people who like run the the course what be their reactions
S0510	yes yes
S0509	to the fact that all these people have leave
S0510	well they couldn't believe it because they have no idea that it have be that
S0509	yeah
S0510	bad although you know they know that the the earlier sound people have drop out
S0509	yeah
S0510	because we'd we'd continue on and
S0509	yeah
S0510	er you have different point where you check in with them on the project anyway so you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	they know we be do the sound on our own and you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	kind of give a little bite of advice as well on that the sound guy although he be he wasn't particularly helpful you know erm and actually when it come to it in the conversation after we'd present the game it be him that be he be quite tricksy actually because they would just they discuss it in front of you what they think and
S0509	yeah
S0510	you know erm give you feedback and i think it be be one of them say well i mean consider
S0510	they have put all of this together pretty much of you know and the quality of what they've do when they're not
S0509	yeah
S0510	even either 3d graphics sound or whatever
S0509	yeah
S0510	you know er i mean they have a mark scheme that they have to compare
S0509	yeah
S0510	to but the sound guy be oh i don't know he be really negative so we be like woah
S0510	you know this isn't go very well sort of thing but actually we do we get a first
S0509	he get a bite overrule then
S0510	yeah
S0509	they be like come on now
S0510	but yeah i'll never forget that oh gosh i'm try to remember the name of the game though zeron or something zeron i think it be zeron
S0509	what what be the game
S0510	it be erm it be kind of like these different fighter spaceships the ones that we never get in the end you know erm go into this in it be a bite star war go into this intergalactic world the open sequence it be really cool actually it be like go into this galaxy
S0509	far far away
S0510	and then zoom in into this spaceship so we have the visual from his 3ds of the spaceship that we'd like flatten and then er do a it be like a hatch door erm that you hear the as it kind of open and then open up into the game and then there be all the screen and you have to choose your fighter you know you choose your spaceship choose your erm captain or whatever different manpower the manpower stuff you know the the kind of weaponry
S0509	yeah
S0510	the weaponry i mean me and we we really that really wasn't our speciality so the guy that be suppose to be do the 3d graphics he do kind of help a lot in term of you know what terminology to use because we didn't
S0509	but that be about it though he throw you some word
S0510	he throw us some word that's it
S0509	what happen to him then do he drop out
S0510	yeah he do yeah he he do drop out
S0509	why do he spend all that time just lie
S0510	i know i know
S0509	do you ever see him again
S0510	i think we do actually i think we saw him once
S0509	i bet that be fun
S0510	now i'm just try to remember whether i think it be the other way round this he be repeat his second year rather than he then go on to to repeat his second year i think he be a repeater already
S0509	right
S0510	so that should have tell us something
S0509	yeah
S0510	but yeah he do he he drop out he drop that be it that be the moment that he crash and burn
S0509	can't really get away with that though you can't expect to get away with that
S0510	no no
S0509	blimey
S0510	anyway
S0509	woah
S0510	so take you on a on a journey didn't i
S0509	on a journey oh god some people hey
S0510	i know
S0509	i've do a over the years i've do a lot of er work with people who who aren't pull their weight but
S0510	yeah
S0509	i've just have to go right we be do this you be say this
S0509	i'm just go to write it all and you be go to say this and you be go to do this
S0510	what because they be not offer up they be not do what they should be do yeah
S0509	mm and sometimes i have end up you know pull other people's weight a bite bite too much but you know
S0510	too much right mm that's you know that's not an easy job to have either because you can and it be a real balance act isn't it
S0509	mm i'm just the one that people look to for like
S0509	somebody to like with presentations they be like so who be go to speak
S0509	like even at college erm we have to do something in form and we have to like present our ideas to some other form and erm our our tutor just go you can do it i be like right fine then it's always me
S0509	and it's quite funny i don't mind that much though but i i kind of like i like some of it but it's just
S0510	oh yeah it's just the way they it's naturally assume that it's always go to be you
S0509	yeah i take it on because i'm like
S0510	yeah
S0509	nobody else want to do it they'll just be stress and like quiet and stuff
S0510	mm
S0509	i might as well do it because i know i can sort of do it alright so
S0510	mm yeah well it's certainly help with your your skills up your skills isn't it
S0509	yeah
S0510	you've have so much experience of it
S0509	yeah the only time i've ever have it the other way round where somebody else have just like dominate
S0510	mm
S0509	be er with
S0510	oh yes
S0509	he's just you just can't
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	his way or the highway like to an extreme
S0510	right yeah
S0509	but erm
S0510	yeah
S0509	yeah i might see a bite more of that if i'm go to a competitive uni
S0510	yes yeah that's true yes
S0509	which could be nice because people might be more will to to be leaders and want to
S0510	yeah
S0509	you know help out
S0510	and that will help you i mean it would be good if if that do happen because that will then give you more skills in in you know how to handle that competitive
S0509	yeah
S0510	kind of nature because if you know if you've naturally always at school by default be the person lead
S0509	yeah
S0510	you know there be other skills that you need to also learn in order to be able to get by in that competitive environment
S0509	yeah the annoy thing be like like i'm quite happy to be like
S0510	in the side line
S0509	yeah
S0510	back room
S0509	but it always end up you know when when i'm not immediately look as the leader we get a really terrible leader who then just doesn't do anything and so then i end up sort of chivy people along beneath them
S0510	yeah
S0509	like i remember on there be this one guy and i really try to make him be a leader and be like well you've get to make this decision what do you want us to do and he just wasn't
S0510	right
S0509	and it be like come on and he didn't
S0510	yeah
S0509	so he but like there be there be like six of us in the group the leader and his sort of sub leader they be just not do it they literally do nothing
S0510	right
S0509	and so the rest of us be just like oh well because everyone be kind of like want to do stuff but
S0510	yeah
S0509	what do we do so i say well if i do this bite you do this bite you do that bite and you do that that bite and we'll get on with it and so we do and then sort of
S0510	right yeah pull it through
S0509	i think i've tell probably tell you about this but we do a presentation and the leader guy be just come up with all this stuff that he'd never
S0510	what random stuff
S0509	yeah that he'd never mention he hadn't do anything for the whole time
S0509	and he never mention any of this and then he be just say things that be obviously just not go to work
S0509	and so i remember just sort of cover him and be like well obviously that would be the ideal situation
S0509	but it be so bad cos we be present so it be like
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	you can't have an argument whilst present but that's ridiculous
S0509	but i think everyone else in my team be kind of on my side and just what be you do
S0509	but somebody make a really great model cos we have to we have to make a game console that's it
S0510	oh yes
S0509	and one guy he be obviously like a really sciency sort of engineeringy type guy
S0510	mm
S0509	and he just make this amaze model it be the best model out of any of them
S0510	woah
S0509	out of this cardboard and stuff and it be just great
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	so that be like yeah we've get a great model we might have a terrible pitch but look how pretty it look yeah
S0510	blue peter at a whole another level
S0509	yeah that's what it be like yeah i'm try to think what the oh will be go away on a residential in january
S0510	be it february oh january when in january be it
S0509	january sort of like mid like the nineteenth or something i'm not sure
S0510	oh be it and be you be you go for a week or a weekend
S0509	er three days
S0510	three days
S0509	so it will be like i don't know if it's monday to wednesday or wednesday to friday
S0510	right
S0509	yeah
S0510	oh yeah it would be a bite tricky if it be over the weekend wouldn't it
S0509	er yeah yeah it's not over the weekend
S0510	mind you owe you
S0509	yeah
S0510	you've get one in the bag there
S0509	yeah quite
S0510	mm it's difficult though isn't it you know that whole leadership thing that you be talk about and sort of be force into a position of lead a team erm sometimes it's more helpful for the rest of the people within that team
S0509	yeah
S0510	if those people that take on that leadership team fail because all the while somebody be like you know back room
S0509	yeah
S0510	help get through it they don't necessarily get the full impact of where they go wrong you know which be easier say than do because when you be in a group situation you want the group to be able to you know to pull through erm
S0509	yeah yeah yeah oh right yeah yeah yes oh right i i couldn't quite get what you mean but i get it now yeah yeah yeah
S0510	oh right
S0509	yeah
S0510	so erm like those two guy who completely you know didn't do anything
S0509	yeah
S0510	and then just front it out at the end to a really ridiculous degree er the yeah
S0509	i remember the assessor be like afterwards when we be talk about it she be like well do for take on the leadership role there
S0509	like you be really do well from behind the scenes so i be very obvious but like yeah i be like oh thank you but they they they weren't great
S0510	no no
S0509	i hadn't a i one of them i don't remember see on recently so one of the fuchsias drop out yeah
S0510	drop away yeah yeah
S0509	get kick out
S0510	he he get what
S0509	he get kick out
S0510	he get kick out oh
S0509	yeah because he be he he just wasn't because he get suspend
S0510	do he oh from school
S0509	yeah
S0510	yeah
S0509	and then i think i don't know if leave or get kick out but she's not there any more
S0510	right so natural wastage there then
S0509	yeah
S0510	so it kind of come round in the end anyway by the sound of it
S0509	yeah yeah ah funny but yeah college be a bite better
S0510	that's good
S0509	for people in some things
S0510	people more will to sort of speak up and
S0509	yeah there's normally like at least a couple in like and because obviously you be in different class
S0510	yeah
S0509	you don't get so much of a reputation for be that one who who give the answer
S0510	ah yeah yeah of course yeah
S0509	but i i guess you do to an extent but like if i go through all my class
S0510	mm
S0509	i can think of at least like one or two other people who always give answer
S0510	yeah
S0509	as well
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	english literature not so much
S0510	oh right mm
S0509	but a bite yeah
S0510	i mean it's different dynamics as well isn't it you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	sort of when you be move from class to class and so you know when you're go through in one class the majority of your lessons like you be in secondary school there be set pattern that everybody fall into isn't there you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	and relationships and you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	erm alliances or or whatever so it's easier for those to because of the nature of how long you be spend with each other for those pattern to become very firm very quickly
S0509	yeah
S0510	whereas if you're mix it up a lot
S0509	yeah
S0510	that help
S0509	no in some of my class like in english language
S0510	mm
S0509	like if she ask a question and then there's a long silence like i i will often have the answer but i will wait a little while to see if anyone else
S0510	yeah
S0509	will say it
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	and then i'll just go well obviously not you know it's a it's a funny old thing
S0510	yeah so what would you say out of all your class be your your kind of favourite
S0509	i don't know because it change
S0510	right
S0509	but it's either drama or english light
S0509	it depend what we be do in drama as well
S0510	yeah
S0509	where yeah and it would depend what book we be do in english light like a room with a view be like woah
S0510	yeah happy days
S0509	but erm ted hughes less so we've still get to do streetcar name desire
S0510	mm when be you suppose to be do that then when you go back or
S0509	yeah it must be because we be do it after a room with a view and we be like we've get like one chapter leave of a room with a view
S0510	right yeah
S0509	so we'll be do that then but it's quite short a streetcar name desire i need to read it but yeah
S0510	right yeah oh they will probably get you see clip of the film as well won't they
S0509	oh bind to yeah
S0510	marlon be it marlon be marlon brando in a streetcar name desire
S0509	i don't know i saw we saw some clip of it on a taster day
S0510	or be i get it muddle up
S0509	don't know
S0510	tennessee williams do he do
S0509	tennessee williams write it yeah
S0510	yeah do he do cat on a hot tin roof as well
S0509	yeah i think so
S0510	right so it's kind of deep south sort of
S0509	yeah
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	yeah from the little i know of it yeah
S0510	cat on a hot a hot tin roof be really good it's get so much tension in it
S0509	right
S0510	yeah mm
S0509	it's a funny old title
S0510	yes
S0509	you be like say title so many time they just lose their mean
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	it's quite a weird old
S0510	well
