S0589	no not always
S0588	well i think it be just cheap fatty meat be quite tasty
S0589	well fatty meat can be tasty like too lean beef can lack flavour that's why part of the reason why we put the fatty bacon into the dish
S0588	we need to find a reason to use those sausages fifth of february they need to be eat now
S0589	well you could you could cook them cos there's a dirty pan and then tell he can have a bacon sandwich
S0588	yeah well we could cook them this even
S0589	or
S0588	they might not be
S0589	give them to the fox
S0588	they'd be quite nice cold wouldn't they hold on it's actually it's the fourth today so they're still in date
S0589	never doubt it
S0588	er look at all these ingredients but it's sixty one percent pork but what part of the pork fortify wheat flour lot of other things basically
S0589	whoop you didn't dissolve it

S0588	oh oh
S0589	and rosemary
S0588	i be think we need a torch that go on your head for that sort of purpose
S0589	yes yes it's a good idea
S0588	i think that yesterday when i be put the wash line away
S0589	do you put the wash line oh yeah you do cos otherwise
S0588	yes i do yeah
S0589	i would have walk into it

S0589	right that's do that just simmer for
S0588	we be
S0589	four hours now
S0588	we be on top of the wash not literally but we be on top of it i think it's about put it out anyway so long as it's it's not rain and then it's quicker to dry
S0589	so thirty five minutes that take me thirty weirdly i think that's not too bad
S0588	no you start it when i start the record and it's now twenty two minutes past
S0589	so there you go
S0588	so that's good it be a classic recipe everyone should learn how to do spaghetti bolognaise

S0589	like there be one of those comedy things on mumsnet or something about husband and one of them she'd write she have send him a text say can you put the spaghetti on the stave for our supper and when she get home he'd just put some spaghetti on the stave
S0588	what like er in the packet
S0589	he
S0588	on the top of the stave

S0588	yeah
S0589	spaghetti on the stave
S0588	yes it's the sort of thing i'd do
S0589	it didn't make sense though because you wouldn't actually cook spaghetti until that would be the last thing you'd do
S0588	yeah
S0589	although maybe actually she be come home with a pot of pesto
