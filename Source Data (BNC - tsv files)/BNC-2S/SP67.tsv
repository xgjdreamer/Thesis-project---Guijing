S0037	girl folk i suppose you would call it
S0037	you know like that kind of thing
S0115	do it have a distinctly different sound to man folk
S0037	well there's uhum excuse me no it's just girls sing instead of boys
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	they're quite good
S0115	the unthanks okay
S0037	so the cornshed sisters be like quite it's quite sort of bite catherine tickill y a bite sort of uh

S0115	well they be very trendy yeah
S0037	lauren laverne's do quite well for herself
S0115	yeah um most famous person from the town
S0037	no surely not
S0037	what about um kate adie
S0115	at the moment kate adie
S0037	or um one of the hairy bikers although he's from so
S0115	think it be her
S0037	yeah probably be

S0037	no i'm sure i must have
S0115	they sound
S0037	be that ham in be that um pork in the dinner bacon
S0115	there's some bacon in there yeah
S0037	oh it's nice
S0115	well i hop so uh otherwise i've like you know um waste my time haven't i
S0037	no it's really tasty it's the right sort of food for today like sort of rainy and
S0115	have you give it give it a good write up oh yeah i like it
S0037	i be give it a good write up sort of rainy and cold and like when you've have a long day at work you're just like ahh it's nice sort of
S0115	it remind me of my old uh shepherd's pies i use to make but
S0037	yeah
S0115	it's much healthier than them though cos it doesn't have load of mince in it
S0037	no
S0115	um
S0037	mince isn't very good for you but it's quite tasty
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	but i'll have to try not to eat too much cos like when we go home at christmas it's just like mince all the time
S0115	oh yeah well um yeah i think uh do say you know we should um like suggest more or make make more ourselves
S0037	yeah
S0115	rather than always get just get them to cook it
S0037	i suppose it's just because she make like like she make like big batch of things like like some of the things that she like that
S0115	yeah but but she say that we should uh we should do that yeah
S0037	no i know i'm just say like why like mince be useful sort of it's easy to cook isn't it like they're like big bowl of chilli or lasagne or that kinda thing
S0115	well it's very rich isn't it
S0037	it be rich
S0115	but um you know that make it sort of it's quite cheap as well
S0037	yeah it be well i have some email from
S0115	well i'm glad you like it anyway
S0037	it's really nice i have some email from today
S0115	oh yeah
S0037	um say that we should go to like for a reunion cos it's ten years since we leave
S0115	right
S0037	so i say yes in principle obviously i need to ask you and find out the date and that
S0115	yeah

S0115	yeah what do he actually do
S0037	um you'll have to ask him yourself uh don't really know
S0115	cos i didn't i didn't get the i'm not in on the i'm not in the email so
S0037	aw
S0115	um
S0037	um
S0115	be this so that like and he's when be his do he say when his party be
S0037	no no mention of it i ask
S0115	so he still hasn't say it yet
S0037	i say how's how's things come along at chez and he just didn't reply so
S0115	well isn't he's sort of move isn't he so
S0037	no but i mean like with his new house
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	but he didn't reply
S0115	right now he's do a he's uh he's do a thing too
S0037	no i mean like yeah but like i i say something else in the email and at the end i say how's chez and he just he he answer the rest of the email and ignore that bite so
S0115	oh yes ignore that it's all go wrong terribly wrong uh never mind uh
S0037	i hope not
S0115	uh yeah 's a good place although i feel like it's quite far for a lot of people to travel
S0037	i think it's just because
S0115	i don't know how many people of us be actually there
S0037	i dunno chris be like who we gonna invite and i be like urr and he be like well we sort of kinda have to invite everyone if it's like the ten year anniversary
S0115	anyway but i but like almost everybody's far away from there though aren't they
S0037	i know
S0115	so it's it have a sort of logistical problem uh i think
S0037	yeah but it's just the sort of fun of go somewhere i think that's part of the thing cos be like oh we'll all go from london together and party train and
S0115	i suppose so
S0037	so
S0115	um
S0037	anyway
S0115	yeah i'll uh get some more in a minute
S0037	hmm
S0115	i'll have some more in a minute um
S0037	it be really nice
S0115	so i take so it be like uh make by partly by accident cos i make the sort of
S0037	yeah
S0115	like the main the main meat and potato bite and mix them together and realize it be only half full
S0037	fish and potato do you not mean
S0115	meat and uh and fish and potato uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	mix them together and realize it only half fill the amount that i want
S0037	aw
S0115	i realize i'd you know not put enough potatoes or whatever
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh i'd also forget the peas and i'd also forget to put the broccoli in but then i think that'd go separate
S0037	on the side yeah
S0115	cos that's what we normally do for shepherd's pie then so i then have to do another batch of potatoes and then have to the same again with them and then have to put a load of freeze peas in them and then stick it on and then uh put some cheese on top and then put it in the oven and then
S0037	that's alright
S0115	so it have uh have a pea layer and like a meat layer
S0037	no it be nice i like a pea
S0115	pea um lead to the cheesy peas experience at the top
S0037	i'm hop squeezy cheesy peas i'm hop that me um me peas germinate like i look at them every morning before i go work like ahh aww like
S0115	um oh yeah cos i should get some of those mung bean uh we've get any old pretty much any bean can uh sprout i think as long as as long as they're intact
S0037	well you'd be surprise
S0115	well i i think it's the temperature partly yeah
S0037	i know i wonder if i should bring them in
S0115	um and what i would maybe experiment with be just to get a little uh one of our little bowl and then you know a bite of water
S0037	yeah and see if they sprout
S0115	you soak you soak them for a while then you empty and leave just a bite of water then you put the cling film on the top and you leave them there in in the warm and
S0037	yeah
S0115	and once you've sprout them i guess you're okay to
S0037	plunk them in
S0115	you've get the root and the and the leave come out so you shouldn't
S0037	they be really hardy last year they the peas they be just like i couldn't like they be grow so much
S0115	yeah if you gimme gimme a few sample of i might be able to try
S0037	so there's load they're in that box
S0115	or i could just do so you can maybe stick them in all together and stick all the seed in together in a pile hope they sprout
S0037	no but then i'll not know what they be
S0115	well i'll hopefully remember from the the colour from the colour of the seed
S0037	some of them be tiny though
S0115	alright yeah yeah well we'll we'll do them in do them separately then yeah get lot of like egg cup and like
S0037	well they're in the little greenhouse now so hopefully that'll keep them a bite warmer
S0115	yeah but i think it's just too cold for for sprout uh it's it's not be very kind so far uh really the the year hasn't be yeah but they're inside
S0037	the tomatoes have sprout though think i should bring the others in
S0115	the year hasn't be very hot at all well it depend on be we be we be we gonna get warm weather again or what
S0037	i dunno it sort of go nice didn't it and everyone be like i have me flip flop on and that
S0115	uh yeah yeah it be a little bite of there be a little uh
S0037	be that the summer
S0115	well yeah probably but there be a little bite of hotness go on
S0037	it be typical though isn't it like in the winter everyone's hop it's gonna snow hop it's gonna snow then it snow everyone's whinging hop it's gonna get warmer
S0115	oh right i don't i didn't want it to snow like uh not this time
S0037	and it's warm for two weeks everyone's get hop it's gonna get cooler then it's cool just for the rest of the year
S0115	i didn't want it to snow um get the gas bill anyway and uh gas
S0037	oh do we how much be it
S0115	uh what i say before um i wasn't that not that please with that amount but uh it's it it be a bite it be for like a the whole virtually the whole winter that we be here yeah
S0037	and we do have it crank up like it's be really cold
S0115	yeah i dunno what the i think we yeah i think we make some mistake there with um
S0037	but it's still not that bad compare to some people's
S0115	use um where we should've perhaps use the oven instead or if we use uh use it in in different methods
S0037	what how long be that for i haven't hear this song for age
S0115	we should've perhaps come up with alternative methods to rather than rely on it cos like just it just be go and it wasn't really do anything
S0037	no so how long be it for
S0115	three months and a few days so it's it's thirty five pound a month
S0037	that's not too bad though
S0115	but that we ideally you'd want a bill for twenty pound a week but you get uh
S0037	yeah but excuse me
S0115	you get it get balance by the fact that the summer months be much less than twenty pound they should hopefully be ten pound a month so
S0037	it be like it be last summer like well i mean even so far we only have it on for hot water now like we don't have any don't have any
S0115	yeah i mean i deliberately like sort of i could see it be quite low you know it be eighteen there nineteen there and nineteen here but i never put it on high and i don't i don't intend to either i think i'll i'lll always use alternative mean
S0037	once you once you make the meal
S0115	unless it's ridiculous i'd i'd use alternative mean basically
S0037	once you make the meal in the even it's normally
S0115	yeah cos i don't need the two back room you see uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	when i when i if i'm sit here i only use this in the kitchen so if i close that
S0037	yeah
S0115	um things like you know the heat from the shower and stuff that warm the house up quite a lot uh
S0037	yeah that's true
S0115	they do and the sunlight in the front but not in the back cos there's no sun in the back but sunlight in the front will warm it up
S0037	yeah
S0115	like by a degree usually
S0037	yeah
S0115	um so i yeah i'll just use that rather than but it be just it be just go and go and really wasn't do anything it be quite annoy
S0037	i know
S0115	um and if we'd have crank it up then it would've cost even more so
S0037	yeah
S0115	um but i think we've leave it on maybe a few time that we shouldn't have but we have to
S0037	well i don't think that's too bad consider like
S0115	yeah
S0037	we be snow in like d'you not remember and we have to like we have to force the door
S0115	yeah it be uh that be a that be uh uh it seem like a long time ago but it
S0037	it wasn't really it be this year wasn't it it be after come back from
S0115	uh yeah um i'm not sure exactly when it be but cos we be worry about get to uh uh 's wed that um that it would be snow wasn't really do it snow after that or
S0037	ah that's right it do yeah yeah but it snow a bite before but then everyone be go oh it's gonna snow muh muh muh like at the start of the year
S0115	yeah
S0037	and her wed be in the seventh wasn't it of january
S0115	yeah
S0037	and then but yeah then it didn't um it snow after so have i get one of those teacakes leave
S0115	i think we have one each but i'm not sure
S0037	whooh i think so could go for one of them i think there be like a jam roly poly at work today look really tasty i didn't have it though
S0115	be that a swiss roll
S0037	no like a jam sponge i suppose
S0115	be that not what a swiss roll oh just you mean just like just not roll why's it call roly poly
S0037	i dunno maybe it be roll it be just look like jam sponge to me
S0115	so it be round like
S0037	it be just like a slice of sponge with jam maybe on it and through it maybe the jam be oh i don't know
S0115	roly poly
S0037	they always have like hot um
S0115	i guess you get the pole and you roll the pole over it and you know the they join the the roll pin and then like
S0037	oh maybe i dunno where it come from but
S0115	guess they get the pole and roll the pole over it and then it get thin and then you fold it over or something
S0037	i dunno a roly roly poly be a funny word
S0115	they they roll the pastry actually rather than um rather than that but uh yeah so no i don't know who the biggest band be in the in the world uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh people often say that when the without measure uh cos in some country a place like china or
S0037	probably be the beatles
S0115	india or like like china they don't they don't really listen to as much rock as as we do in the west do they
S0037	what about lady gaga she's pretty giant
S0115	yeah if you're be you talk in solo artists as well uh
S0037	oh be we sorry excuse me be we be we talk rock band
S0115	well yeah well i say band so i just mean band but if you're talk in solo artists no i don't that either i don't know the answer to that either um but hopefully there's um
S0037	she's she's get the most followers on twitter
S0115	who
S0037	lady gaga
S0115	oh yeah well that's not really like
S0037	no i know it's not a measure of everyone in the world not everyone in the world's on twitter
S0115	yeah yeah cos no they're not be they
S0037	no
S0115	have she more than
S0037	more than anyone yeah
S0115	i dunno who who else would it be you know who who do people love i suppose
S0037	dunno
S0115	it's like a religious thing isn't it you know like uh
S0037	hey that plant's get really big that aloe it's like hang over the edge of the pot i can't believe it
S0115	it's still i don't i don't know if it's any bigger than it be like when it fell over that time i don't know if it's any bigger than like
S0037	i dunno i think it's look good
S0115	but yeah yeah it's it's not bad though
S0037	d'you think that tent's gonna be good then
S0115	um the picture look good i dunno what what be the size of it suppose to be able to sleep four people
S0037	dunno shall i have a look yeah i get a four a four man tent because i think
S0115	can can you genuinely fit four people in that
S0037	no well that's the thing like a two man tent fit three and like a four
S0115	what
S0037	sorry a three man tent fit be good for two and a four man tent's good for three so i think me you and plenty of stuff cos it's a good one
S0115	really well why be it call that then
S0037	well it's like how much you could how you could actually get in like if you if you want to like put four people in
S0115	yeah alright so it's just it's just precisely
S0037	but they'd literally be sleep like hang on like there like that see like four like very affectionate people who be very well acquaint
S0115	well like a family in other word yeah yeah
S0037	no but i think you like there wouldn't be much room to like wiggle around oops
S0115	yeah yeah well
S0037	well yeah i helpfully leave that on the table so annoy at work
S0115	that's it so they all sleep and and their legs be like point up to the to the front of the tent
S0037	well i think that's probably the most typical
S0115	uh okay
S0037	but it's get two doors it's get like a front if you pass the little picture like that front piece like there that piece there that's a door and also that's a door there
S0115	yeah oh yeah yeah okay
S0037	so
S0115	hopefully it's get a good you know ability to to withstand rain then
S0037	yeah that's the porch bite that's the porch bite
S0115	it's not gonna just totally get soak
S0037	it have good review
S0115	oh that's good
S0037	um it's get a measure here two thousand droplets i dunno what that mean
S0037	um
S0115	two thousand droplets
S0037	oh it's in oh here we be here's the english
S0115	before it leak
S0037	uh here's the feature um quick pitch front storage area porch grind sheet attach to the bedroom ventilation to reduce condensation multiple door options large windows bright guy line with glow in the dark runners for increase visibility there you go
S0115	alright
S0037	but i don't know i don't know what that i know i understand what those symbols mean but i don't know what that one mean
S0115	uh let me have a look um you didn't know what the two thousand droplets
S0037	two thousand droplets
S0115	two thousand candle uh
S0037	that's still a good sketch that
S0115	it's sort of get like there's something in the middle which be like be that what's that go on in the middle be there be it just open
S0037	be that the dimension of the bag
S0115	be it just open
S0037	there
S0115	yeah be it be that suppose to
S0037	that's the door yeah that's the door
S0115	that's the front door i see right so that's normally obviously shut so no the fly of it though it doesn't seem to have a fly
S0037	what d'you mean doesn't have a fly
S0115	everywhere
S0037	yeah there's an inside tent and an outside sheet
S0115	right be be it all definitely cover by its i suppose it must be
S0037	i think so
S0115	yeah
S0037	i mean most tent be like that aren't they like inside bite outside bite
S0115	yeah
S0037	see what it's like the good one of the good things i think be like the instructions be sew into the bag yeah look content carry case inner tent fly sheet guy line peg pole so yeah
S0115	right so we'll have to assemble it then
S0037	right now
S0115	well eventually you know uh
S0037	maybe we could assemble it here d'you think we should think it's big enough what's the
S0115	um we'd need to be probably probably in the room through there cos that's
S0037	why
S0115	even more space than this
S0037	i don't think so i think if we move the sofa and that
S0115	yeah um
S0037	obviously we wouldn't be able to peg it down to the carpet
S0115	no no um so you think here's better than uh right so if i need to finish what i'm do um
S0037	you what
S0115	i need to finish what i'm do on the computer so uh if i can do that then
S0037	yeah
S0115	hopefully i'll be hopefully have some time to have some even afterwards
S0037	yeah and we can put our tent up
S0115	yeah
S0037	and have like like when you're little and like you make a den do you ever do that
S0115	well it's good to have a tent in the house so i think it's good yeah cool
S0037	do you do that when you be little
S0115	no and i never have a tent and my family never go camp
S0037	no like no not have a tent
S0115	a den no i didn't have any brothers and sisters
S0037	ah well no but you didn't need to like i use to do it with me nana like use to put chair up like get the two live room chair and put a sheet over them and like
S0115	oh yeah maybe once or something but uh no never really have uh playful people who would make dens uh like in my family
S0037	you know like we have one of those um what be it call uh a dryer you know those air rack things we have one of those that have like three piece and use to like put that on
S0115	yeah well it be good to have your own sort of cave isn't it i think
S0037	well we just use to do it in the summer holiday like it would keep keep us occupy
S0115	yeah no i like that i would've i would've like to have do it more
S0037	yeah
S0115	but i never really do it so
S0037	and i read it on the news today that um the national trust have issue this like you know bucket list
S0115	no book it list
S0037	bucket list like a hundred things to do before
S0115	book it list
S0037	bucket buh buhcket
S0115	book it bucket list
S0037	aww bucket list
S0115	bucket
S0037	anyway they'd be for
S0115	if you would say boookit if you be say
S0037	i wouldn't say boookit that mean something different
S0115	no i mean but you wouldn've say that if it be
S0037	if it be what
S0115	boook if it be
S0037	to book something
S0115	yeah
S0037	bucket boooket i dunno what i would've say
S0115	cos that's ambiguous isn't it cos you know bucket as in book a ticket versus
