S0015	scrub the patio and the gutter to
S0281	yeah
S0015	get rid of the rubbish so it doesn't wouldn't go down the drain otherwise it would fat never end work i'm afraid
S0281	erm i just phone er the school's er school admissions
S0015	school admissions yeah
S0281	yeah
S0015	in
S0281	yeah erm
S0015	yeah
S0281	check out the feasibility of maybe come to school here
S0015	mm
S0281	erm i haven't speak to about it
S0015	no
S0281	er because i i think i'll need to get a bite of information behind me before i do it
S0015	yeah
S0281	erm
S0015	of course
S0281	so
S0015	what do they say
S0281	well when i enquire before i say that er the admissions date
S0015	yeah be such and such
S0281	er be sort of january
S0015	january mm
S0281	and march at the latest you know the guy i just speak to an indian guy and i always i
S0015	you conversation
S0281	well i i always have trouble with an indian accent i find it very difficult to understand them but anyway erm they're they're it be possible still
S0015	i tell you you don't believe me
S0281	well
S0015	they they have to by law keep a certain number of place available now it might not be your school of choice erm that's the that that's the thing i mean you know if you know the school in you choose a good one
S0281	well
S0015	but there's not much chance of get into the best
S0281	there's erm there's two two aspects of this one be er which would i be apply for primary or junior
S0015	how old be she eight
S0281	she's eight she's gonna be nine in october
S0015	i think that make her into er junior
S0281	but i say erm that er you
S0015	nine in october
S0281	you you can yeah you can apply for both say it's er it might be a bite harder for junior cos all the place have go but you might get in on on late admissions
S0015	mm
S0281	but also it depend on er where you live and i say well at the moment i'm stay with sister and her family up at erm in but i i haven't get any accommodation of my own say well they take into consideration erm your application accord to where you live and
S0015	that's the that's what i say to you you have to decide which area you're gonna go to to be able to put your application that's why that family i'm talk about that move into our house
S0281	mm
S0015	they have to do it by a set you know they have to get choose where they want to live they select the school choose where they want to live and search in that area for school
S0281	well they say that they say
S0281	yeah but i can't they they say that i need proof of er
S0015	accommodation
S0281	accommodation right
S0015	yeah you will
S0281	so i can't
S0015	apply
S0281	i can't do it that way i can only apply give the only address the the that i've get which be here now
S0015	mm mm
S0281	yeah
S0015	uhu
S0281	so
S0015	which would mean you'd know then move to need to move and if you get her into school you'd need to move to that area yeah
S0281	right and then erm i mean how would that fit in with the house er get house
S0015	well you just have to look for a flat
S0281	would would i would i have to find er would of would er how do it work i mean i
S0015	well you then have to look for a flat they if you put our address down then you'd have to look for a flat in this area so that you be in the catchment area from the school
S0281	mm
S0015	but i mean
S0281	that would be difficult wouldn't it
S0015	well there aren't many flats in this area
S0281	mm
S0015	well there be that's not strictly true there's load of them there's all down where live all of those flats there
S0281	mm
S0015	you know there be available erm you just have to look online but in the meantime put it down as our address but then you'd have to make sure you otherwise you're stick with travel you know a long way to pick her up and drop her off and you know erm i know you won't get into school because it be the most popular school in i would think other than the catholic school which they go you can travel all over to go to catholic school but erm there be flats all down there but erm the difficulty be they be very popular because they be in the catchment area
S0281	mm
S0015	which be where go i mean 's at that school just by sheer accident cos we didn't think anything about school at that time it just happen to be where the flat be erm but the one the one you would get into would be which be just up the road here
S0281	mm
S0015	erm near asda now i don't know where the nearest you know flats would be in that area what you'd have to do would be to go to local estate agents such as erm about three or four
S0281	yep with i i'm tell that it's very difficult to to get accommodation if you're on benefit now i'm go just i've get a pension
S0015	it be it be difficult it be erm more difficult because you know people on benefit quite often have sort of wreck the joint and they don't look after the place and and you know
S0281	what what if i get erm erm a guarantor as it be
S0015	it wouldn't matter whether you've get a guarantor or not the the big the thing well i suppose it may do but that isn't your at the moment you couldn't get any benefit cos you've get too much money that's your problem right now you're not a dhss case
S0281	no well i erm i've see a house
S0015	you're a private erm individual
S0281	mm
S0015	and so there'd be no problem you know they wanna know where you live erm what you know how much you've get in your bank and what you do for a live well you're retire so you know
S0281	well i could presumably do do one step at a time
S0015	you'd have to and then you'd have to become a dhss one
S0281	mm
S0015	when your as i i be say to you the other day you couldn't apply they wouldn't help you right now at all
S0281	so any rent i'll have to pay
S0015	you'd have to pay it front yeah
S0281	well that of money would go very quickly
S0015	yeah it would and then you'll become a dhss and that's why i say to you she say but buy diamonds or antique or something because that's money in the bank
S0281	yes
S0015	but you could sell in the future and that's you know what some people would do in your situation but of course if you do have i mean right now you would only get help if you be dhss you would only get help as a single person
S0281	mm
S0015	which would be a lot less than if you've get two people or three people
S0281	mm
S0015	obviously because that's how it's work you know you only need to look after yourself kind of thing but if it as you person as you be at the current you would erm and you're want place for you need to be look for a two bedroom
S0281	yeah
S0015	or you would have to have a large one bedroom where you could sort of use the front room with a put you up or something
S0281	mm mm
S0015	that would work erm as long as that large enough to store all your things and 's things
S0281	mm
S0015	erm so that that would be one option and then if didn't come you've still only get a one bedroom and you would still be entitle to the same amount now if do come and you be you know obviously your money that have go and you be dhss at that point you erm would have be not a single person any more you have a a dependent a child now if you only have a one bedroom there be a chance not not very good chance in this area that you could be rehouse with the two bedroom if you're in 's area that would be quite quick i mean for instance have she have a two bedroom flat and one child erm november she have the baby be bear she register that you know with the council or house association in erm december just before christmas i think or maybe i don't know in december and she get a place and she's in it now brand new because in that area there be less people look for house in it's the worst possible
S0281	mm
S0015	scenarios and and you get families that be homeless they put them in b and b and certainly single people just don't stand a look in you know because there's so many families that haven't get
S0281	mm
S0015	accommodation because the rent be so high and so it's kind of swing and roundabouts you have to decide what what you do how long you could hang on in with a single bedroom place with a a child you'd have to then look for a a large a very large one which would
S0281	how much would that cost
S0015	well they're you know how how i've no no idea they you know i couldn't give you a price cos they're all different price i know a two bedroom be around about nine hundred to a thousand
S0281	right
S0015	pound a month
S0281	would it would it not be better rather than register say my address be here say it be in er give 's address because that'd be easier find a school and house
S0015	why
S0281	no
S0015	there's no school around where be be there
S0281	mm be there not i don't know
S0015	no no
S0281	oh
S0015	no it would need to well the best thing to do be get on the internet and look at the school in the area and you'll see i think there be
S0281	well that's that's what i've get to apply anyway erm for an application for a school you this be the website here
S0015	yeah but that's what i'm say that that's they want to know your erm address currently when you put that application in
S0281	yeah
S0015	so if you put 's you'd have to change everything your bank and everything to 's
S0281	oh right okay
S0015	erm
S0281	yeah well that's not good and all so he doesn't want because he
S0015	yeah yeah there's complications there
S0281	yeah yeah
S0015	so erm but in this area there be three three well four actually if if you count the catholic school but you'll never get in there without the priests give you a the nod erm here there's up here where behind here where go er but that be one of the most popular school in and even who live in the area struggle to get in there then you've get erm which be just off er which isn't far and you've get up here
S0281	mm
S0015	now i know quite a few it's not the most popular because it's right on the edge of a council estate
S0281	mm
S0015	so it's probably the least popular of those three be be always have a good reputation but you need to look on the map and see shall i go and get the the laptop and look on the
S0281	yeah okay
S0015	yeah see what the school the okay
S0015	do you want some toast
S0281	no i'm fine thank
S0015	be you sure
S0281	yeah yeah well i don't know swing and roundabouts what to do not gonna be easy i don't know whether it's gonna be possible or not mm
S0015	age wise i'm sure she'd be in the junior
S0281	yeah
S0015	yeah but erm why say she's eight
S0281	nine she's go to be nine end of october
S0015	nine they get they go up i think at seven and eight and that sort of erm
S0281	i think what about er erm language ability because she
S0015	well
S0281	she's obviously not
S0015	no but you'd be surprise how yeah
S0281	fluent in in english where well yeah the kid adapt really quickly i know that but er
S0015	they they might prove surround by so so quickly but i mean they have get children come from all all over the country all over the world

S0281	mm
S0015	that's strange cos they be there just now let's see if i can go back
S0281	i don't know it seem very unlikely try to juggle everything i haven't get her passport i haven't get an address
S0015	no that's that oh they have a passport erm and documentation for you haven't i do say that to you when you come you know make sure you've get a birth certificate and like that so that you can erm
S0281	but that's all in chinese isn't it
S0015	ah
S0281	and it's on a family book
S0015	right i don't know how that's that work out let's see as soon as you take that all the school go that's weird look try to look they're on there now to get them back they're the let's move that across
S0281	mm
S0015	right so junior school that's the one up by us that's the one i be talk about
S0281	right
S0015	i think that's call it's in erm there's the which be up by which be you know if you move up there that wouldn't be too bad erm school which be where be well there's 's not there that's out right out you've get over here you've get that's really weird because erm what's his name's not on that that's erm er isn't on there that's the one in that's easy to get into that's quite a you know a you know a possibility er the be a nice school junior school that i can't think where that be i've actually get the review here look what's it say there
S0281	well see see as i've get nothing no document for it
S0015	no
S0281	for her at all
S0015	no
S0281	i haven't even get photos
S0015	to be honest you won't get her in for september because there's too much to do
S0281	ah
S0015	you would have to look at do it after september you know cos you go over there in june
S0281	yeah
S0015	and try and er you know get agreement from you'd need it in write that you she's prepare to let her come with you
S0281	yeah
S0015	live you'd need the passport you'd need all of that and once it's over here then you know you can bring that with you and then you know work on it from this end
S0281	yeah
S0015	so then you'd be back i don't know when you'd be back but when you come back when do your your erm thing erm
S0281	visa expire
S0015	mm
S0281	september
S0015	no no not your visa your erm your your erm chinese visa expire then
S0281	mid september
S0015	right
S0281	but i i mean i i intend to apply for a resident's permit actually
S0015	yeah yeah i don't know how that how that work what you mean you can go backwards and forward anytime
S0281	well if i get yeah resident's permit i don't need a visa
S0015	right okay so let's assume that you apply for that and but i be think more your concessions flight concessions when do that end
S0281	oh six months
S0015	six months so it's when be it
S0281	so that be just before the ninth of december so that
S0015	so january february march april may june begin of june
S0281	yeah
S0015	that's so then mind you if you're bring over you're gonna have to pay for her flight and
S0281	mm
S0015	you would only be on standby so you couldn't be on a standby
S0281	no
S0015	and not get on and she get on
S0281	yeah
S0015	so that you wouldn't wanna be do that but erm i don't know might be able to get you a hotline ticket they call them which be a bite of a reduction this be the erm which show that's not far from its erm
S0281	so to to get this concessions i'll have to go back before the ninth of june
S0015	yeah to be for you to yeah back there and be back here or whatever it be on concessions you've get to be back by the ninth of june to still be on
S0281	and be back here oh
S0015	otherwise your flight back will get you won't get your flight back
S0281	well i i wouldn't be able to go over there do everything i've get to go over there for an operation
S0015	i know
S0281	yeah and i've get to apply for a passport and
S0015	ah
S0281	i'm not go won't be able to do it
S0015	well firstly it depend when you go you know if you go earlier
S0281	well yeah but she don't want me to to do that do you know
S0015	tough innit what she want
S0281	well where be i gonna stay
S0015	mm that's the the problem well what happen when you go over in june where be you gonna stay then
S0281	well i'll have to stay initially there but then get to up to to er for operation
S0015	to be honest if she come over here she would have her operation do free
S0281	yeah but look at what
S0015	how urgent be that
S0281	yeah well i don't know and also have to whether it can wait another year
S0015	what the operation
S0281	yeah
S0015	it wouldn't be necessarily be another year you know it just depend what what the problem be some surgery
S0281	yeah
S0015	some surgery be quick some surgery be not
S0281	but if i be gonna bring her over for next year
S0015	i don't mean for next year if you didn't make september but come by christmas or something to i don't mean wait another year i mean you know by christmas you couldn't fix it all in june and get it all sort out here by june but if you go over in june start sort the paperwork in june in china come back say in july and then from september you would start sort everything here wouldn't you
S0281	mm
S0015	i know it's i know it's a lot and it seem seem a lot but you'd have to do it step by step the most complicate part to me be the chinese bite cos they don't understand that any of that i understand what happen here what you need to do here and it you know most of it can happen quite quickly here
S0281	mm
S0015	once you've get that until you've get 's permission passport and medical even if it be in chinese
S0281	mm
S0015	erm and presumably will have her own passport and not a family book
S0281	mm
S0015	to do that so would have to agree that wouldn't she to get that do now if you can get past that then i think it's plain sail this end from my point of view
S0281	mm
S0015	cos i understand what'll happen it you know it's it's quite difficult to coordinate it so the time be difficult but you'd be just say you'd apply for a school say with this as your residence and 's residence initially
S0281	but it's no in that case the timing's too short to get everything organise to get entry in september she won't
S0015	well i i i don't know whether it be i don't know how long it would take to organise the chinese end but for me that's the bite it seem insurmountable to me cos i don't know how it all work and as you say she hasn't get a passport currently she's on a family book you haven't get 's permission you'd need that in write like you know probably sign by a solicitor or something i would imagine which give permission for her to come erm and you also need to be on board and you know kind of those be the things i think i find difficult to
S0281	mm
S0015	visualise how that would work out if that all work out then and you bring over then it i don't think it's you know you can do you can get accommodation within a week
S0281	can you get emergency school and what would happen
S0015	well you wouldn't him you might not get in in the first week or two she'd probably a week or two to
S0015	adjust
S0281	no but i mean would it would it be a problem miss the school entry date in september
S0015	it would no why
S0281	no okay
S0015	you know cos it'll be it'll be a new entry for her whenever she
S0281	yeah yeah sure
S0015	so and to be honest it it could be and because erm she'll be nine she won't be go in with a new cohort of kid that come from infants they go at seven seven plus
S0281	mm
S0015	right so she'll have miss that last year sept last september they they all go up year six in year seven at seven and eight they transfer so she won't be go in with the new cohort of kid she'll be go in new when they go up to the next class
S0281	mm
S0015	erm and erm usually what they would do be they'd give some children the responsibility of be a mentor you know a couple of children just show her round and look after her in school and be her mentor in school so for miss september it's not like it's
S0281	mm
S0015	like everyone's gonna be new in september
S0281	mm
S0015	they'll be already in their classrooms by by then by the time she's nearly nine erm so i don't think that so much be set whether it's september or christmas it's gonna be new for her
S0281	mm
S0015	and quite quite difficult for for her but at the same time hopefully it'll be quite interest and tell you what the air'll be a lot better for her
S0281	yeah
S0015	and erm
S0015	and and you know i that to me the bite in the in china i don't understand enough about so i can't say yeah that'll work out alright i'll just i don't know how will react i don't know how long it take to get a passport i don't know whether she she be sign for a passport and let me take her or you know i don't know
S0281	mm well i've get a no i'll talk to her this weekend i'll i'll ask her about what she think about it cos every time i nearly every time to something different change the situation and
S0015	that's right cos so what what be turmoil
S0281	yeah
S0015	you know
S0281	well it's not it's be pretty steady so far but the plan be now that we can't afford to keep her in this school and so erm that's why she's talk about go back to erm
S0015	so he's not able to support her
S0281	i've get no idea
S0015	i don't know i i but she strike me as be the sort who erm money would be
S0281	yeah
S0015	very important to her
S0281	yeah
S0015	and she's i think when she stop sink er stop to think and think well actually do you know what this isn't such a really good arrangement move to not
S0281	mm
S0015	not not have the school any more and and have to work to support herself really that's what she's say
S0281	mm
S0015	and that's if he go you know so right now it might be a you know not a not a erm a lot of a permanent arrangement it might be an idea that she's toy with and try to struggle with
S0281	mm mm
S0015	and that's why i say to i think you should write an email to her say i'm really please that you think you've find someone you want to be with and that's that's really great erm i hope he's able to support you erm as you've always you know the way you've be use to
S0281	mm
S0015	and that erm and you know i'd like to think he could pay for erm 's you know to support you've select someone who can look after well but i'm concern that if that's the case why be you have to consider go to which would move you and
S0281	mm
S0015	if he's not able to look after you
S0281	no to put all that in an email her english isn't all that good i don't know if she'd understand all that
S0015	isn't it well isn't it all that good it's not enough to understand that
S0281	well speaking's better than read
S0015	right mm you should get someone to translate it for her or
S0281	mm
S0015	explain it in basic word couldn't we
S0281	mm
S0015	but that's what i my thing would be be like question what she's do make her question what she's do and check whether she be absolutely certain about it careful that iron's on darling
S0015	that would be my first reaction
S0281	mm
S0015	and then you can say if that be the case and you feel you erm what there be a future for you with this chap erm i would be happy to have here and erm you can have your you know opportunity to see whenever you want and she she'd have a good free education hm free education free erm cos ring didn't she free education free medical erm
S0015	and opportunities that she hasn't might not have in
S0281	mm
S0015	i don't know what it's like there but you you know i'm just go by what you say it's a country place be it
S0281	mm yeah
S0015	yeah
S0015	i i i can't imagine cos she's trendy
S0281	mm
S0015	she like nice clothe will she live in a place like that
S0281	well there's always cities and you know just so be a province it isn't all that rich but then there be cities and and cities and towns and all these place to go and and
S0015	be there close by
S0281	yeah
S0015	mm well i don't know but you know that she'd be happy for her to be there school there that look decent i suppose
S0015	erm it's i'm
S0015	i put question in her mind about whether it's a permanent arrangement er you know right now she's you know think she's fall in love with someone but it be very different when you be pay the bill
S0281	mm
S0015	and suddenly you're not
S0281	mm
S0015	and now she's think hang on so what do she want now you to come back and eek out an existence and pay the bill
S0281	no i don't think erm
S0015	look after
S0281	i don't we haven't even talk about that other than it's i don't think er
S0015	what's what's always see i don't know her but i'm just try to think what her motives be what sort of person she be
S0281	yeah
S0015	i don't know look at it from a different aspect you know whether she whether it be whether she change her mind frequently or
S0281	oh god yeah like the wind
S0015	well there you go so this this idea might just be a
S0281	oh sorry
S0015	sort of a a threat to you at the moment
S0281	yeah
S0015	that might be her say oh you know i be you gonna see
S0015	well tell her safe journey
S0281	pardon
S0015	i say and hurry home
S0015	not back till saturday erm so i don't know that would be my first thing that i would suggest put it in an email sort of some question to her to make her question herself and and say you know i'm happy for you if that's what you want to do if if you think it's right if and you think it's right for you and that you can be look after like and then she'll she'll be annoy by that cos she won't like it she won't like it you say yeah okay go ahead that's what effectively you're say and then you can say alternative if you don't think he's gonna be there forever you don't think he's gonna be a good father erm i erm i can look after him over here
S0015	and that's what you say she can have free school erm and i'll get that where we can live near a park where she can go to the park and the sea send it to her
S0281	mm
S0015	and free free medical and fantastic opportunity for someone who can speak speak and write mandarin
S0281	mm
S0015	the future here everyone want you know all private school like college they they they're all do mandarin
S0281	mm
S0015	cos it's the language that be gonna be need in the future so i don't know that's how i would play it with with
S0281	yeah okay
S0015	okay see you in a while darling
S0281	okay
S0015	drive carefully
S0015	well that's how i'd do it i'd send her an email question it make her question her you know what's go on or think about the future rather than oh what what can i do to get out of this situation think about where what the reality be she's commit she's commit herself to so to say then you know if if if it's not if you think there's any doubt in your mind that it might not work i will have while you work you work out your problems
S0281	well i don't wanna say that cos that'll annoy her erm i i what about say erm that er well just ask her about not the the possibility would she be agreeable to come over here now erm rather than later
S0015	mm
S0281	er because that way erm i i'll be with her and i can look after her and i can get her into school and erm er there be free health and free school and the the air's much cleaner et cetera et cetera but apart from that because she already well why don't you get a place to live and i say well i already say that i can't get a place to live until i get a job because people will
S0015	mm
S0281	who rent properties so now i'm gonna have to change that
S0015	mm say i i now find i can
S0281	well well say that
S0015	anyone can
S0281	i can if i if i've get a child
S0015	mm
S0281	if i've get a child then i can
S0015	because she'll think you only want for the
S0281	yeah yeah that's true
S0015	you say the situation be that i've not just find that i be eligible and i can rent a place here
S0281	mm
S0015	erm i've now find that i you know some contact to help me find accommodation oh thank you erm and and erm see if she will erm and say and and i but i won't i won't do that unless i know that 's gonna be able to come
S0281	mm yeah
S0015	it's you know i i won't bother with the expense if if i if but if 's come if you allow to come then i would erm be able to get a place
S0281	mm
S0015	why do you say to her you couldn't get a place then without cos you get a job if that's not
S0281	well she's cos she's push me about in
S0015	oh right
S0281	but er to find somewhere to live
S0015	but why be she push you why do she care where you live
S0281	oh i don't know i don't know
S0015	you say well you should have say well i you know i quite like stay with
S0281	well yeah well
S0015	he's good company
S0281	well yeah and there's
S0015	you know why should she care where you live
S0281	mm
S0015	so you you know have speak to you erm i've decide to start look for somewhere to live and i can i've you know several opportunity
S0015	and send her picture from the internet you know they're all over so she now think you're not able to find there good support that's what she's gonna say but you haven't get anywhere to live gonna be her first thing so maybe you say erm for my part
S0281	and she's gonna ask me about how much money i've get
S0015	well say erm go down fast
S0281	mm
S0015	but i get
S0281	but that's gonna be another bone of contention erm money in the future
S0015	well her
S0281	cos i i won't be able to get myself my hand on my property cos it's ones in her name solely and the other's in both our name
S0015	well you're never go to go back be you now
S0281	no
S0015	and you
S0281	no
S0015	whatever happen you're never go to get that from her
S0281	no
S0015	cos you know she she's get it and she she that from the begin
S0281	mm yeah
S0015	so erm i think you should say right no i i erm after talk to you and ask why i haven't get a i decide i ought to really look more you know more closely and i find a can there be lot of properties
S0281	that that yeah
S0015	that i can rent
S0281	but there won't until under no
S0015	yeah there's no point unless i think 's go to come erm i quite stay with he's good company and erm but if i think be gonna come i erm rent a place and find it all in the locality a good school for
S0015	so but you ought to ask your question you know about be this guy gonna look after be he do you think he's gonna have he get a family already you know so many question you know you know you're think about your future with him so that's really good i hope he's go have he get already get a family be he go to be a good father you know be he go to look after as well i would be ask all those question and she need to ask herself them she's probably not think about them but she shouldn't
S0281	i think it's better to to put this in an email rather than
S0015	i do because she would take stop and come back to it and backwards and forward
S0281	mm
S0015	if you say it over the phone it's kind of the heat of the moment
S0281	mm
S0015	you can't remember everything that's say
S0281	mm
S0015	but if by in an email people go back to it and read it again and it will be a a reminder to her that they're you know right now it seem like a good idea to her but what be the reality and she may not wanna tell you if he's get a family or not
S0281	mm
S0015	what his financial situation but if you ask her she doesn't have to answer but she'll be think well it's really bad i can't tell him or it's really good i'll tell him so but i i think to be honest the only way people you can stop and think about it properly be if it's in write because it's all in the heat of the moment you remember snippets of conversation but not all of it
S0281	mm
S0015	not the fine detail erm and you've you've only remember the bite that you try to bat off you know if you say on well you know it's either she'll remember what her retaliation be but later on and she might be angry at it but when she's get an email she can't be angry and retaliate she might be angry about it but she'll go back and look at it she'll go back and chew it over in her mind and it's all there everything you say so you do have to carefully word it
S0281	mm
S0015	so i'd if i be you i'd er er do it in a erm word a word
S0281	draft
S0015	yeah and word document until you get it say exactly what you want to say in a simply form simple form that will make her think deeply about her action and what where you know where it's lead no just this week this month next year but long term and then once you've do that you can finish it off by say you might even start it by say after talk to you about you know rent a place i decide i ought to look into it and i find i can so there be quite a number of place i'm look at
S0281	mm
S0015	erm so end that bite then say i'm happy that you be you know gonna have someone that you're happy with erm i hope he's you know a nice person who'll look after you and and erm be able to keep you erm but i don't understand if he be able to why you're move to
S0281	well that's cos the money for the school
S0015	i know why
S0281	mm
S0015	i know cos he can't afford to pay for the school
S0281	mm she would expect me to
S0015	but what i'm say hm
S0281	she'll expect me to i'm surprise she hadn't ask me already
S0015	well she probably be but you just say like tough innit you you find someone else
S0281	mm
S0015	be he gonna look after you be he gonna look after i can look after if he doesn't want to but i'm not gonna
S0281	well i don't want him to i wanna
S0015	i know but you you that's she she doesn't you don't want her to know that do you cos you'll go well you're not have obviously you can pay and you can whatever but you kind of do it in a much more subtle way as a you know i i'm i'm really please you find someone who can look after you and and and you know pay pay to support you but i don't understand why you need to to go to if he's able to look after you and basically he can't can he cos she's gotta go to work she's gotta go there for school so then you say if it you know be you sure it's gonna work out be be he gonna be there for the long term i hope so but you know what if all else fail now i'm get my my life together her and i'm you know i've get i'm gonna rent a flat if that be a problem i would have to bring her up here where she would have free school free medical fresh air and quite a large family of
S0281	i'd like to here the er erm accent it more on the that i want her rather than the money
S0015	well personally
S0281	if he's not gonna pay for it then i the i will take her it's not the way to go about it i think
S0015	i i think it isn't actually i think cos she'll go well you're not have i'm not do anything to please you
S0281	mm
S0015	so it's not about that what you've get to say be kind of like erm make it clear that you're gonna get your life together here you're gonna rent a flat no matter what and if he want to look after you two but he obviously can't so you point that out in a subtle way
S0281	yeah
S0015	erm and she start go oh hang on a minute
S0281	but then she might question well why do i want to apply for a resident's permit in china
S0015	so that you can go backwards and forward
S0281	yeah
S0015	to see her
S0281	yeah so i can be closer to her
S0015	well you you can go regularly to see her
S0281	yeah
S0015	and because she tell you to i've listen to what you say apply for a resident's erm i'll do that so that i can hopefully go backwards and forward to see erm and i'm rent a flat here because i you're right i do need to set up on my own
S0015	you're right i'm do what you say now your let's talk about you kind of attitude this be point out where the shortcomings might be in her plan in a subtle way and then back it up and say however whatever your plan you know if you don't think it's gonna be as easy as that i be happy to bring up here where she would have all these positive cos you you don't wanna point out what you want you wanna point out what's good for cos
S0281	mm
S0015	she doesn't care what you want
S0281	no
S0015	she care what hopefully care with what will have
S0281	mm
S0015	more than what you want you know you wanna be with your child and tough as far as she's concern but she should be listen to what's best for
S0281	mm
S0015	and she's move to for school
S0281	mm
S0015	you know but she still hasn't get free medical she still hasn't get fresh air although be it more better air over there i don't know
S0281	erm yeah it's better than
S0015	where they be
S0281	mm
S0015	mm so and then you say when i when i find a place or you know when i'm i'm when you i you know i'm you can send her stuff that you might want to look at i'm gonna look at this today let her see do it more by email than your phone call you don't have to wait a week to speak to her
S0281	mm
S0015	where it get all heat and
S0281	mm
S0015	difficult you can say what you want to say to her without the retaliation
S0281	mm
S0015	though that that'll be how i would play it very much more subtle say you're please for her which will annoy her
S0015	won't it cos you're not you know desperate you're give her permission to go ahead and move to
S0281	mm
S0015	aren't you you know i'm not gonna fight you go go to let him look after you sound like it i mean either way she's gonna do it
S0281	mm
S0015	so better to her think well actually he be happy for me to do that and i'm gonna have to do it he's not come and he's not gonna pay for everything again and you can say now you've get your pension detail set up and your money tax credit come in erm and you'll find out situations improve a little
S0281	well she's gonna yeah she's gonna she's gonna ask about the money i say well if you can't find a job where where be you gonna get the money from
S0015	well you say and i get pension credit over here we get benefit if we're not able to work and that's why you know you can survive
S0281	mm
S0015	it's only on you you get it you can't give it to her
S0281	no
S0015	so she can't have it it's you know i get i get help with whatever i need
S0281	if she'll say you won't you won't have enough money to put pay the flat and if you're not work
S0015	well say i get benefit
S0281	mm
S0015	well it's what you do you get benefit if you aren't earn enough then you get help to live everybody do well know that i mean you know you you that answer to her i'll help you do it
S0281	okay
S0015	you you need to do that quite quickly send that to her to give her something to think about 's presumably still at school be she
S0281	yeah she be she's on holiday at the moment but erm
S0015	yeah but at the end of that
S0281	mm next week she go back
S0015	she send she's happy to send her off week after week to a school where she doesn't you know she doesn't know the teachers doesn't know the teachers yeah she's get lot of friends and she's get get to know the teachers but you know it it's not much different except she doesn't see her every week but she can see her by skype the same as you do
S0281	mm
S0015	can't she the only thing i your big problem will be if you get over here i think she will take quite a while to settle and i think she'll say i want my mum
S0281	mm yeah i'm sure
S0015	i wanna go home that will be the biggest sort the the the documentation in china
S0281	yeah
S0015	and then settle in period where with the best will in the world even if she isn't happy there she she'll want to be back to normal
S0281	certain she's always have her mother you see
S0015	yeah but she hasn't
S0281	that's that's
S0015	she's she's at school all the time
S0281	well that's it and
S0015	i don't they're not close you seem to say
S0281	no well i don't know so a little girl need her mother but as i say she she's not be a brilliant mother
S0015	oh and what about her grandmother be she close to them
S0281	mm not really
S0015	no not be part of her life
S0281	not much no
S0015	no exactly so you know that's a huge upheaval for her anyway so what she's talk about be a huge upheaval erm and possibly a very uncertain life with this guy and what happen if this guy isn't around any more be i dunno what wage be and what erm what erm can do to earn a live be she able to earn enough to support herself and and would she live with her parent what would she do
S0281	i don't know
S0015	i can't see live that kind of life what from what you tell me about her
S0281	no
S0015	and and i bet she can't really and when when you talk about go to no where do you
S0015	no when you talk about go to where your flat be
S0281	oh the
S0015	yeah she didn't want to go there
S0015	why
S0281	well now i know why
S0015	why because of a man
S0281	yeah
S0015	right so now that man be on the scene but she's go to have to go to isn't that further
S0281	oh it be a lot further
S0015	mm
S0281	so i'd i i assume that er she's work all that out and that he's go
S0015	mm
S0281	but er
S0015	so he say
S0281	i don't know i don't know
S0015	but then that's what you say to her you know i presume you've work it alright you've give consideration for all these things and that you're all go you'll be go there and look after you you'll both work be what sort of job be available in be she able to what be she able to do to earn a live
S0281	yeah i'm gonna have to put all this in very basic term because
S0015	no but i'm ask you what sort of job would she do
S0281	i i've get no idea
S0015	what she's capable of do what what would she turn to
S0281	know
S0015	so you know be it be it good pay over there or erm all of those things she to be think about and if you ask the question she'll start think more deeply about what she's do
S0281	mm
S0015	and she might then say well actually i can have my cake and eat it if you have
S0281	mm
S0015	it depend what sort of person she i don't know
S0281	okay ah
S0015	all you can do be suss it out to
S0281	right well it
S0015	and go up with saw
S0281	erm erm
S0015	and try to get some question together
S0281	mm
S0015	and we're you know and then we can phrase it in a way that you think will understand
S0281	mm
S0015	and go from there that will be my advice question her free her up to go and do it cos i don't think she really want to do that either and then offer a way out
S0281	mm
S0281	it's good er
S0015	pardon i yes darling
S0281	yeah it's a good strategy
S0015	i'm good at strategy get get your resident's do and tell her you're do it so that you can come and see it erm see it whenever you can afford it you're gonna get a flat here cos you're right i should get my get my life together fortunately my pension now be you know and if i don't have enough money the benefit will kick in and pay my rent won't pay all of it pay most of it erm so i'm gonna you know start look forward rather than
S0281	mm
S0015	in other word you go forward i'll go forward but if you want you know i'll have offer's always there so i think that would be my suggestion
S0281	okay
S0015	and then if she's
S0015	what darling
S0015	chocolate brownies mm i like my chocolate brownie get don't they
S0015	and then once all that be do if she say say well if she say you know okay in which case you can have to live with you you you say right okay well in which case erm we'll look at the paperwork when i come tell her you wanna take on holiday
S0281	if she want me to she already ask me what be you gonna do with her ah well i'll take her to the the the the er seaside
S0015	mm
S0015	so you should have probably tell that
S0281	mm
S0015	mm well you could offer you can come and live at the seaside
S0015	and see the sea every day if you want to
S0281	okay well thank for that
S0015	well we'll do it i'll i'll start on it and then if it's any good you can look at it
S0281	okay
S0015	and you can chop and change it and write it so in a way that you think she will
S0281	well
S0015	understand
S0281	yeah
S0015	and erm go from there
S0281	yeah
S0015	and then once once you get that bar once you get that passport thing sort then which i think for me the only thing i can't i can't visualise how you would do it or how it would work out for you once you've do that then you worry about school and accommodation otherwise you'd be pay for it
S0281	yeah
S0015	you know
S0281	well yeah one slip of the tongue and she's up for it first
S0015	yeah she might be and if she's not you've offer and you know the she have the option at any time that if she change her mind
S0281	that's excellent
S0015	just leave it on the i'll so i think you know i think she might go well that's you know what that might be better for
S0281	mm okay
S0015	and who know we'll see won't we
S0281	yeah
S0015	if i be you i wouldn't bank on anything with her but
S0281	no
S0015	you know you just don't know what her thoughts be sound like you don't know and i don't know cos i don't know cos i don't know
S0281	mm
S0015	never meet her but
S0281	yeah yeah
S0015	could be that this bloke could raise her if it's a good idea
S0281	mm
S0015	isn't it
S0281	well i'm sure that er in many ways that she'd prefer me to for her not to have to have the er
S0015	responsibilities
S0281	responsibility and the inconvenience of it all although she say her mother can look after her in
S0015	well
S0281	but it's a horrible farm dirty old
S0015	be it
S0281	yeah
S0015	mm
S0281	it really be disgust er
S0015	but if you sound as though you're worry about that she'll think that she's get a chance that you'll cough up and stop her that from happen
S0281	mm
S0015	but if you say well you know perhaps it be best you know it's the only way you'll be able to do it kind of thing if i'm not help
S0281	mm
S0015	will you you know your decision you do it i'm not gonna help but if all else fail you know i'll still have
S0015	but you first of all need to make clear that you erm be in a position to support her and get a flat so i think your email should start with you're right i've listen to everything you've say i've decide i will go ahead and apply for my residency so that i can see regularly and i'm gonna get my act together here my life together and i can get a flat i'm gonna you know do that as soon as i can erm
S0281	but i won't do it unless i well i can do it i mean
S0015	no i don't think you just say that you know that but it's only if come you say i can do this and i'll you know you haven't gotta do it
S0281	yeah
S0015	just tell her you're go to
S0281	yeah
S0015	i've look at several flats and there's some nice place close to the beach near park erm and so you know i'm i'm gonna do that decide you know she might be go oh hang on a minute he might find someone else and not wanna have you know you don't know what go on in people's i don't know if i er but you sort of think what think how she's think
S0281	yeah alright well we'll do that later then
S0015	i mean if if you be a father that didn't care you could never reply to her again
S0281	mm
S0015	she'd never find you
S0281	mm
S0015	but it's only that she's get that that you you know need to keep in contact with her
S0281	yeah
S0015	and don't forget she's get those flats
S0281	yeah yeah right
