S0679	i didn't hear the end of the story about what's happen outside with your tree get those lower branch cut off where how where do it get leave
S0680	well it start in october last year when piece of well thinnish piece but piece of branch keep fall down into the garden
S0679	i remember that yes erm
S0680	and onto the pavements
S0679	mm
S0680	and i ring up about it and be tell that erm they don't really do anything unless it's an actual danger of a tree fall on somebody basically
S0679	mm
S0680	so erm they say they'd send somebody to look and i think it be probably some months later they turn up and i do speak to a gentleman and erm he be take a photo he wasn't actually the man who do the work he be take a photo of what it be like because i'd explain that while i be have my windows replace i have a fine view of the street outside and just a few minutes prior to school children come along the road erm there be a sizeable bite of branch come down er so i could actually see because i have an er uninterrupted view have no windows erm so er they think about it and they be go to ring me back but of course they didn't erm because also there's a lot of growth all the way up the tree trunks along this road so when you get to a junction it's very difficult to see without stick your bonnet right out into the road what be come up and down at the smaller road junctions so
S0679	yes that's so dangerous cos i think that's how have that accident whatever happen we don't know exactly
S0679	because of erm that hedge erm that chap 's hedge
S0680	mm
S0679	sorry i interrupt you you're tell me
S0680	no no so erm so anyway in the winter there's also the additional problem that you get all these wispy branch grow out from the trunk which be a bite of hazard to pedestrians
S0679	mm
S0680	and erm er children go up and down especially when it's twilight and you can't really see them very well
S0679	oh i'd hate to be poke get poke in the eye couldn't you
S0680	yes i mean i i do cut the ones off face my house but i'm not entirely sure whether i'm suppose to do that
S0679	now tell me er be it lime tree
S0680	they be lime tree
S0679	be that why they have bits that stick out of the trunk so low
S0680	they seem to grow like that yes because the other erm varieties don't have the same problem but erm it seem to be originally when this be plant there be there be it be a sort of avenue of lime tree really cos they be quite close together
S0679	lime tree be tree aren't they all round really because erm
S0680	mm
S0679	i mean they may have some nice characteristics but they have these bits that stick out of their trunks and they're not like baby tree it's like the main branch be in the right place and then there be all this nasty sticky stuff off them have they get anything good go for them
S0680	yes i well they're quite a nice bright green in leaf
S0679	mm
S0680	but the problem be they also shed a heck of a lot of leave erm and
S0679	there's a lot of tree to shed leave
S0680	and they seem to attract the aphids that erm make the sticky stuff that stick all over everything
S0679	oh right
S0680	it's the the erm whatever you call it
S0679	greenfly
S0680	yes it's er that sort of
S0679	greenflies
S0680	yes it's it's erm something from the greenflies i think rather than it's not the tree itself it's the fact that it's the aphids erm produce something
S0679	do you think they drink too drink too much of this and it make them ill
S0680	i think they go they go too too mad on the on the sap and it just produce all this sticky goo
S0679	oh gosh i didn't know
S0680	erm as in as in aphid throughput as it be erm so i don't know really
S0679	so where's that leave us now
S0680	so that's leave us now with the fact that when we be walk up the road the other day
S0679	yes
S0680	erm we observe
S0679	have
S0680	as i er have go out in the other direction er from the end of the row of erm terrace er i didn't notice until we come back
S0679	mm
S0680	from the opposite way on that particular bus that on the other side of the road they have trim all the offend bits off right from the traffic light up to
S0679	mm
S0680	just beyond so erm that be why i ring them this morning to ask them if they be come back the other way
S0679	i think i miss a bite of the story you say er do that do you have a man out
S0680	well there be a man who come out to take photos of
S0679	mm
S0680	and he say the forestry department would get back in touch with me which they haven't actually do
S0679	yes
S0680	so that be why i ring them this morning to ask them if they be come back
S0679	mm
S0680	down the other side as i be the person
S0679	mm
S0680	or no doubt one of the people who complain on behalf of our row erm and hadn't hear anything but unfortunately i get a very pleasant gentleman who explain to me that the whole of the forestry department be on a train day
S0679	go to the woods
S0680	so erm whether they've go for a picnic in the woods i don't know but as it's nice weather they be have a train day which erm seem a bite odd that everybody in forestry be there but er
S0679	mm
S0680	this chap do attempt to look up a few things but anyway they're go to ring me back tomorrow
S0679	do he find your case number
S0680	he find my case number but he couldn't see into i don't think it be his usual job cos he say there be some other bits he couldn't get into so possibly he didn't have the right erm
S0679	mm
S0680	passwords clearance whatever to to erm use that bite of the system
S0679	and i suspect you've be give the code number for fussy woman who we won't do anything about
S0680	well i don't know
S0679	that would be a good thing wouldn't it you could give people cod and they you could erm listen to what they say
S0680	mm
S0679	and then you think oh that's a really deserve person we should try and help them we'll give them code four or four four o nine or something
S0680	yes
S0679	and then oh gosh they're a real nuisance we'll give those six four seven and you'd have a list on your wall
S0680	that's right
S0679	have you get a code oh you're you're you're the awkward person aren't you
S0680	i believe that happen in some place
S0679	really oh gosh i think i'd just invent it
S0680	no i think
S0679	nothing's new in the world
S0680	anyway erm so hopefully somebody will ring up to explain if they're come back down the other side
S0679	but they they won't do that they wouldn't've do that today because they be in the woods have their picnic
S0680	yes yes well hopefully they've all have a a meaningful experience on their train day
S0679	mm
S0680	and perhaps come back revitalise but erm that's that's it
S0679	what time do they start do he say
S0680	no they didn't say what time they start but presumably not all of them be in the office there must be some out and about saw
S0679	some be take photograph and some might even be cut piece off tree
S0680	well they might be
S0679	better if he bring a saw rather than a camera do you say that's not the right piece of equipment
S0680	well he be wear a suit so i know he wasn't the
S0679	mm
S0680	right man for the job but er and he's the one who give me the piece of paper with
S0679	mm
S0680	and put the put the code number on for me
S0679	he'd have to wear a hard hat in case the branch fell on his head
S0680	well that's true i do offer to show him the offend branch
S0679	mm mm
S0680	cos i have it in the back garden
S0679	oh yes
S0680	but he didn't seem to be too worry about that but there we be so
S0679	so you wait to hear tomorrow
S0680	yes and er when i first ring up they before you sort of try and tell them anything they tell you oh no if it's something to do with block your light or various other things we or overhang your garden block your light we can't do anything about that
S0679	but if it be somebody else's tree er as a neighbour you would have certain right shouldn't you isn't there something about hedge shouldn't be too tall
S0680	hedge be a certain height
S0679	so surely a tree should not be that big
S0680	but if it's block your light it can't be well these tree have probably get a preservation order on them or something i wouldn't be a bite surprise but erm that be the thing
S0679	mm
S0680	so i mean apart from the fact the tree be now wider than my house and taller than my house
S0679	mm
S0680	and the fact that my house be only fifteen feet wide it's only as wide as the lounge
S0679	mm mm mm
S0680	erm consider it's only that wide i have this tree and i also have a lamp post and a telegraph pole
S0679	mm
S0680	admittedly you know they be all there when i move in
S0679	they'd probably take the lamp post away these days and not give you one there
S0680	but erm that may happen er but you know there be rather a lot go on in the pavement outside my house
S0679	mm
S0680	consider how narrow my house be so er it be a bite tricky cos if you as when we arrive in the taxi the other day when the poor man be try to stop to avoid
S0679	mm
S0680	so we could actually open
S0679	mm mm
S0680	both doors of the taxi
S0679	mm
S0680	it be er tricky
S0679	mm now be there anything we need to find out cos tomorrow tomorrow's thursday isn't it
S0680	yes
S0679	so we've get thursday and friday be there anything we need to possibly ask about the triathlon on sunday isn't it
S0680	well we can we can have a go at the website i have try
S0679	mm
S0680	put in the thing for the the w w for the work website
S0679	yes
S0680	but it's get an interactive map
S0679	mm mm
S0680	but it seem to have a life of its own
S0679	would you write that on your things to do you could put it down at the bottom if it's not the most important thing
S0680	so look up triathlon i think i've work the route out look at the yellow sign
S0679	and we need to estimate the difference different the distance not different and between here and
S0680	and the park
S0679	so we can go for our very own teddy bears' picnic on your birthday
S0680	this be true
S0679	as long as we can manage the walk
S0680	well the it's difficult this weekend as well because have the roads close round here because some people be have queen events er this weekend
S0679	yes yes that's sunday too it's she's decide to have her birthday
S0680	because down the road in they're have er street party
S0679	mm mm
S0680	and things
S0679	mm
S0680	now if you're somebody from outside who's go there you know
S0679	mm
S0680	friends of erm you're gonna have to stay the night i would think because you're not go to be able to drive down there
S0679	mm
S0680	from one o'clock in the morning
S0679	well i think the idea of a street party be you just have the neighbour
S0680	i know but you know it's just
S0679	which be at least something you can do if you can't go out
S0680	no but if there's relatives
S0679	yes
S0680	you know if somebody's parent be come
S0679	mm
S0680	or children or whatever then erm
S0679	mm
S0680	you know they've get to make sure they're in situ cos er
S0679	yes
S0680	there's no transport
S0679	no quick dash to waitrose before it start
S0680	no so er there we be so how far to well if we drive that way tomorrow i can clock it
S0679	mm now you want to look at something in
S0680	ah now where be i go in
S0679	it be a shop i don't know why you want to look at the shop to see if there be park outside
S0680	ah no i want to establish where that shop be
S0679	do we know the name of the shop
S0680	it's the one that may potentially well it's a branch of the one that may potentially
S0679	do you want to write the name down and i'll look it up
S0680	may potentially be interest in buy 's vast collection of speakers or at least the big ones that we can't move the trouble be they're they're not people who come and collect well he say he didn't come and collect in town but
S0679	okay well let's just establish what we can about the shop cos there might be some things we could take there
S0680	the other man doesn't want them because they're too big for his shop
S0679	no
S0680	but they're very they have a very good tone
S0679	okay erm
S0680	and i be go to go into the erm
S0679	estate agent
S0680	er ironmongers
S0679	mm
S0680	next to well it isn't school what be school
S0679	what your school
S0680	yes
S0679	oh yes
S0680	erm
S0679	ironmongers
S0680	yes
S0679	mm
S0680	it's just a few doors along er it's no longer mr there be a mr
S0679	be that the really small shop with all the all the where you can't can't exactly throw your arm and legs about
S0680	no that's that's in this be an er ironmongers general shop
S0679	mm
S0680	locksmith he's the locksmith who
S0679	mm mm
S0680	who look at 's door and then er he's no longer mr who be a
S0679	mm
S0680	erm a very gentleman he retire in about nineteen eighty and erm somebody else another man take it over erm and there be various people work there and they're they're very helpful but it be one of these shop you walk in they have have it er slightly modernise but you walk up and down the row and there's just sort of you know box of all sort of hardware stuff and you can buy lengths of chain and erm you know sort of plug or bigger
S0679	mm
S0680	and all sort of things and he's he's get very good lock and so so forth he's the man who come to 's and take the lock away that second lock because they no longer make a lock that would fit in that particular door erm because it's probably the original one so he take it away and replace some of its insides
S0679	mm
S0680	rather than
S0679	for a very reasonable price
S0680	for a very reasonable price so you didn't have to have another lock which would've mean cut a whole different section out of the door
S0679	mm
S0680	and make a mess erm and he be very helpful and he and he also supply me with erm numerous key which be what
S0679	yes
S0680	i need just for the you know for the same price as you'd pay for
S0679	yes i check in timpson's and they say erm yale and mortice they cost six or seven pound each
S0680	a very nice man no well these in they're they're two pound
S0679	mm i think i'd pay about two pound
S0680	yeah
S0679	so i think i might shop around but i have to get the car key do there
S0680	yeah but if you want to it probably wouldn't be much use cos you wouldn't try them but erm you i mean you could have a key cut there they're usually alright
S0679	mm i haven't get any with me so
S0680	no but you wouldn't be able to try them very readily cos it's rather a long way to your house but erm they're very good anyway that's that be a proper ironmongers type shop and there be that one there use to be one in
S0679	mm
S0680	erm run by a very nice sikh gentleman who die unfortunately
S0679	mm
S0680	he be quite old and his wife and his son run it for a while but his it wasn't really his son's
S0679	mm
S0680	kind of job erm but unfortunately they be no longer there erm they do have to close but there be the place in i mention erm round the corner from audio republic erm hi fi shop and near what use to be 's fish and chip shop
S0679	mm
S0680	that's now
S0679	mm
S0680	be take over
S0679	mm
S0680	erm just on that little corner there be erm an older gentleman who have a shop that be as you say you walk in and he's get a little tiny counter and there's shelve floor to ceiling and you just stand in a little area
S0679	mm
S0680	he know where everything be but you can't actually circulate because it's tiny
S0679	mm
S0680	he he just
S0679	what's he what's that one call
S0680	erm now i can't remember that one's name but it's something like two people's name put together or it's not bilko cos that's a different programme altogether but it's
S0679	mm
S0680	it's like er
S0679	it's er something that sound like a shop name but it part of it's probably his name
S0680	mm mm
S0679	because he also have that on some of his little packets of nut and bolt and things
S0679	yes
S0680	okay and i've get that erm dawn to dusk kind of nightlight
S0679	mm
S0680	thing there which be erm it's an lead it's not a bulb one
S0679	mm
S0680	anymore
S0679	mm
S0680	so that er that's a very nice shop to look in
S0679	so sorry what be it you want to buy in
S0680	face mask er not a face mask a i be consider there be a place to buy a dust mask or dust mask disposable
S0679	buy some there have you
S0680	i buy those in wilkos
S0679	but there must have be something else you want you just say we could go er sorry i think you say we could go to
S0680	no er i i be think of go to
S0679	but you don't need to
S0680	no or because i as i be in town wait for your delay train
S0679	yeah yeah
S0680	erm i er go in there and get some like the ones i have before
S0679	mm
S0680	although as i say to you the it be funny because i say to the man i i i be in the hardware section but i say to this chap erm i'm look for face mask and he kind of look at me a bite strangely cos i he be in some quandary as to whether i want like a face pack or a
S0679	mm oh right
S0680	a mask to wear in bed
S0679	yeah
S0680	cos i say i don't want it something to cover my eye when i'm in bed i say i don't want anything cosmetics
S0679	oh yes
S0680	be a lady although i don't look that much of the sort of lady who would have
S0679	do you call them face mask
S0680	i don't
S0679	
S0680	erm they're dust mask
S0679	oh right okay
S0680	so i say erm
S0679	to give you mud a mud pack
S0680	yes so he want to give me something for a lady really i think
S0680	but he didn't like to say that because it be not politically correct
S0679	no
S0680	so i i sort of say oh i say i want to wear it for sand down
S0679	mm probably he be erm
S0680	chisel my feature yeah
S0679	really try to think how he could say it without potentially
S0680	well that's right so i think i'd jump we be in that section i say you know cos i say you know for sand and keep so you're not breathe in dust particles
S0679	mm mm
S0680	because i'm i'm turn out a cellar and he then sort of look at me even more strangely
S0679	yes well
S0680	what be this woman do
S0679	mm
S0680	erm so erm and then he i must've walk pass them but he point them out to me i say oh yes i say they're the ones i usually have
S0679	mm
S0680	as if i'm always wear them
S0679	mm
S0680	er so that be quite funny you can get these strange women in shop
S0679	yeah very strange
S0680	so er so that's er
S0679	yes
S0680	why i buy them and erm drive to the station with them
S0679	talk about the cellar i look i'm tempt to send the photograph from the carlton bicycle brochure that we you show me
S0680	yes
S0679	to i think he might quite like it
S0680	mm
S0679	but i don't like to tempt him with things that he can't have
S0680	well he he could have it but he can't have it cos we can't get it there
S0679	no
S0680	unless he's think of sponsor himself to ride it back to
S0679	mm mm mm mm
S0680	er or
S0679	mm
S0680	i should say in his case shouldn't i yes
S0679	oh he be also say something very strange cos he's quite every time he's he try to give us carrier bag now when we see him
S0680	oh right
S0679	erm because he doesn't like
S0680	bag for life
S0679	he doesn't yes well apparently
S0680	yeah
S0679	he live in that you know a flat and
S0680	yeah
S0679	i think there's six in the block
S0680	yes
S0679	and he say you know now you have to pay for carrier bag
S0680	yes
S0679	he say his dustbin erm get completely stuff up with bag for life carrier bag that he take out of the dustbin
S0680	yeah
S0679	take back to the shop i think and get a new one
S0680	oh right
S0679	because people think it's better value
S0680	mm
S0679	to erm presumably
S0680	well those be much
S0679	buy the thick one rather than the thin one but when they get
S0680	mm
S0679	because the thin one break on the way home from the shop and then they just throw them straightaway and they don't even recycle them
S0680	no but perhaps they can't
S0679	's go funny about recycle cos they er they've take the green bin er well your brown bin my green bin
S0680	yes
S0679	er away and maybe they're they're take the er no i think at the moment you can still do the plastic one
S0680	they've take the recycle bin away
S0679	yeah
S0680	take the one that you put er compostables in and garden rubbish so that mean people be put them in the black bin
S0679	yes yes
S0680	and they'll get charge more for landfill
S0679	yes yes
S0680	presumably
S0679	yeah and next year they're go to take away the plastic you know the the one you put your paper in and your glass and your plastic er that be the recycle bin do they have different
S0680	well hold on
S0679	you can't
S0680	i can't have glass
S0679	i've get a black bin
S0680	yes yeah
S0680	that's household general non recyclable rubbish
S0680	yeah and i guess it get very
S0679	so we're common on black
S0680	yes we're common on black
S0679	i've get a green bin that i put green things in
S0680	garden waste which yours be brown my garden waste be brown
S0679	you've get another bin
S0680	but it's only select garden waste specially select
S0679	yes i know you can only put windfall apples and not apple peel
S0680	yes mm yes
S0679	okay that's the one that they've lose
S0680	you can't put any organic
S0679	mm
S0680	well any sort of food waste or you can't put any
S0679	mm
S0680	any because our system doesn't kind of cook it all up
S0679	no no
S0680	whereas your system do
S0679	yeah
S0680	so it the microbes don't get
S0679	except it doesn't in now unless you pay fifty pound
S0680	right
S0679	but i don't know how they identify whose bin should be empty for fifty pound
S0680	no
S0679	okay
S0680	perhaps it have a big pound sign on it in gold
S0679	yeah and then we've get the third bin which i be blue for me
S0680	or when they lift the lid it go kerching
S0680	cos it's make money for the council
S0679	i've get one that's blue
S0680	yes
S0679	that i can put plastic erm glass
S0680	mm
S0679	and all that sort of stuff and i've get the paper that's the one that have the paper caddy in it
S0680	well you've get subdivisions haven't you
S0679	yes
S0680	you've get carrier you've get sub trays sort of things
S0679	i've get paper yes
S0680	paper
S0679	yeah
S0680	trays
S0679	except in they just throw it all in one
S0680	yes
S0679	so all the paper get all mix up with the
S0680	yes but when it go for sort they must be able to segregate that
S0679	oh they do sort they do take it out again but it get a bite spoil
S0680	because my green my green bin
S0679	mm
S0680	which be my recycle bin you can put some sort of paper in it but you just lob it all in together although you probably should take it to an actual specify paper thing at the dump or at the supermarket you know post it in
S0679	do you put cardboard in that one
S0680	no er what i can put it in mine
S0679	yes
S0680	yes i can put cardboard in my own personal green bin i can put
S0679	and you just put the paper in the whole bin you don't put it separately
S0680	no it all go in together but i don't put paper in there because when i er because i we have to recycle glass ourself ourselves
S0679	mm
S0680	we can't put them in the bin i take the glass and the paper together because i can put it in either the tip ones or i can do it up at the shop centre erm so i don't personally erm put my newspapers in
S0679	okay
S0680	i do put envelop and odd bits of
S0679	mm
S0680	kitchen erm wrap off er you know suitable paper
S0679	mm
S0680	that's be on a food item and we can't put glass in
S0679	no
S0680	so the problem here be if if you don't live near a glass recycle bin then erm you have great difficulties like next door who hasn't get a car he if he want to take glass to recycle he'd have to take it on the bus with him cos there's nowhere within walk distance in this area because the people would probably complain about the noise erm but erm for example the old lady we know
S0679	yeah
S0680	in another bite of she hasn't even get a bus available to catch or anything so she just put all her glass
S0679	mm
S0680	in the dustbin unless she
S0679	mm
S0680	have give it to me to recycle not that she have that much or she have to give it to the person who get her shop to do something with
S0679	mm she's very naughty with things
S0680	but
S0679	because i saw her in her back garden and she have some litter in her back garden
S0680	yeah
S0679	and she just poke it through her gate or round her gate into the street
S0680	yes because it be not her litter
S0679	which i didn't i didn't think that be quite the public spirit approach
S0680	no
S0679	erm especially as an agoraphobic who doesn't go in her house go down her garden to her bottom of her
S0680	mm
S0679	garden
S0680	yeah
S0679	admittedly not a very big garden to to put her erm to put her er litter out
S0680	well she will go down there cos she have to put her that's why she her bin's there but erm
S0679	mm even er more reason why she should put it in her bin but anyway one shouldn't be
S0680	mm i don't know
S0679	yes but anyway what i be say be the bin that your green bin my blue bin
S0680	yeah
S0679	they're go to scrap in next year
S0680	recycle
S0679	yeah which be ridiculous
S0680	yeah
S0679	it's absolutely not think through all the council tax will go up and landfill
S0680	yes yeah yeah question
S0679	mm yes
S0680	so there we be and of course round not where that lady live they haven't be tell but we be tell by the council that if we leave our bin out after the time it's after the day it's be collect so you're suppose to put your bin out before seven in the morning or certainly not till the night before
S0679	mm
S0680	if it's then still out after it's be collect and you haven't put it away by you know the next day presumably erm you there be a possibility you will be fin seventy five pound per bin
S0679	mm
S0680	which be a bite much if it's only certain areas
S0679	yes absolutely erm but they haven't they you put your bin out and they haven't empty it
S0680	but then there's the problem with the fact that i put my bin out i do tend to put my bin out slightly earlier than even because i'm not walk all the way round
S0679	mm
S0680	the back of my terrace and round to put my bin out the front where it get collect in the dark
S0679	yes it's hardly a a trivial activity take your bin out
S0680	or in the winter no i mean it be quite a distance
S0679	mm
S0680	as there's only one end we can get round the terrace
S0679	mm
S0680	erm so there be that and also the fact like today i put it out yesterday afternoon erm late sort of it be out late afternoon ready for the and it's a wide pavement so it's not actually block anybody's way
S0679	mm
S0680	and erm as we find come back tonight it just hasn't be empty
S0679	mm
S0680	so be they come tomorrow
S0679	well they can't fine you by not it in
S0680	so i've pull it into the gateway
S0679	mm
S0680	will they consider that sufficiently out on the street erm and also you're really suppose to push it to the kerb now if on the day
S0680	two of my bin be if on the day when my brown and my green bin be collect on the same day which it should've be this particular week but i didn't put the green one out cos it wasn't full enough erm it mean there be a hazard because i've get the as previously mention i've get the tree which be an old tree so it's get a good girth on it
S0679	mm
S0680	the lamp post admittedly the telegraph pole be further back and then i've get two bin cos you're suppose to put them on the edge of the kerb
S0679	yes
S0680	which mean there's quite a run of that bite of road
S0679	mm
S0680	for anybody park
S0679	mm
S0680	where they won't their passengers would not be able to get out
S0679	mm
S0680	so i'm not quite sure where we be on the seventy five pound argument i don't think anybody's
S0679	no
S0680	erm take the council to task on that one if they've be try to be fin but it be a bite much to fine this area i suppose it's because a lot of house in this area be big
S0679	yes
S0680	detach house
S0679	yeah
S0680	and they think people won't you know they can afford to do it and they won't make they might kick up a fuss but they'll pay anyway
S0679	and if you live in a back to back it get a bite difficult doesn't it cos you haven't get a
S0680	well you have to put it down in er
S0679	oh you might if you're a street if you're on a if you're a back to back you you do you have a front garden
S0680	some yeah well where we live at do
S0679	yes i be think it do
S0680	but back to back that be on the street like the ones they've still get in
S0679	mm
S0680	every few house there's a common yard where the bin tend to go
S0679	oh right
S0680	but you've get to wheel your bin up or down
S0679	mm
S0680	to get it in and also those streets if you think of go down to the main road they're very steep and a lot of people chain their bin to the downpipes or whatever because if you put your bin out
S0679	mm
S0680	well it doesn't need to be icy but if you live on a steep hill
S0679	mm
S0680	you haven't get a level surface to put your bin have you
S0679	oh i see and they they sliddle down the hill
S0680	well if that's a possibility because they're really steep roads
S0679	yes
S0680	and you haven't really get a flat area cos you've get no garden to pull something in and lean it on the gatepost
S0679	so do you have to unchain it every week
S0680	but i have notice there be some that be chain
S0679	mm
S0680	but i don't think i think some of them do keep them chain to their erm thingy bob but as i say some of the other house they do have erm
S0679	mm
S0680	they do have those little yard areas communal yards that you can keep your bin in
S0679	it's not a problem in you know
S0680	no no back to back
S0679	no no no erm you wouldn't have to chain it for that reason
S0680	oh
S0679	it wouldn't go down the slope
S0680	oh no it'd be flat i see what you mean
S0679	yes
S0680	yes yes and probably you don't have to have a problem in either
S0679	no there's a few areas that be fine although in you might get a bite
S0680	yes so
S0679	okay
S0680	there we be so we'll see if anybody turn up for my bin tomorrow
S0679	yes yes be it full
S0680	i would like that one empty cos it be the garden bin
S0679	mm
S0680	so it be full of garden stuff
S0679	yes
S0680	and i do need to cut the hedge
S0679	yes
S0680	so i'll need another empty bin
S0679	yes
S0680	okay
