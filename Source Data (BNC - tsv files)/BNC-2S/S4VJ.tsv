S0248	mm
S0247	so do you wanna know where i go today
S0248	yes where do you go today this afternoon
S0247	erm i go basically out to see the people at work photography exhibition which be advertise as be at the before go on a nationwide tour
S0248	okay
S0247	and erm it be er nine photographers be ask to take photos of people at work
S0248	okay
S0247	erm and the purpose behind it seem to be to dispel the idea that industry in britain be dead because that's the they all say the same thing you know all you hear be that there's no industry the industry's dead and go and it's not true apparently there's lot of industry so they all set out to different part of the country so you know one one photographer do london somebody else do the north east somebody do manchester and so on and they all have different approach and so on erm so that's in the and then go on tour and actually the be very busy but there be hardly anybody in this exhibition
S0248	right
S0247	and it might've be because nobody could find it when i go into the i ask you know where where be this exhibition and i be tell it's on the second floor and give some elaborate erm directions and when i do go to the second floor which be actually a bite later on i couldn't find it and i ask somebody and he say oh just go down there turn leave follow the you know go round no it wasn't there ask you know a museum official who be up there you know where's this people at work photography exhibition she say don't know what you're talk about the only exhibitions we've get be these here which be something different erm so then i wander around a bite more find another official and ask him he say send me back the way i come and i say you know i've get a map of the so i say you know where on this map be this exhibition and he be still on the second floor go media space in here it's media space and i say er yeah it say media space but it doesn't say the the name of the exhibition so he make some excuse about oh well they're print up you know erm generically and so on so i say well anyway it isn't there so i leave him and then find somebody else who tell me it be on the first floor
S0248	okay so you and you believe this person
S0247	okay i well i go to the first floor i still have trouble find it
S0248	mm
S0247	cos it wasn't terribly well label but i find it in the end so as i say you know probably nobody there because
S0248	wouldn't you have just if you'd be walk around the first floor wouldn't you have just happen upon it
S0247	well the be enormous you know
S0248	well when you
S0247	yeah
S0248	say that you know aboutthe second floor i be i be gonna say how big be this second floor
S0247	it's very very big and you you know we've be there before there's you know it's big enough to to house you know great big aeroplanes and tractors and you you know spaceships almost you know so it's
S0248	er yeah okay
S0247	there's huge er installations in it erm all you need be a few sign you know but they don't seem to do sign very well
S0248	yeah it's poor isn't it
S0247	anyway i didn't go straight there because erm i i i go on the three sixty and when i get off the bus i be outside the and the other thing i want to see be an exhibition at the which be all about protest it's like art in protest it be call something like forbid object so it feature placard and banners
S0248	oh right
S0247	and the tin pot do you remember when the argentinian protest they always take out pot and pan
S0248	yeah the noise they make come down the street wow
S0247	mm yeah yeah so there be there be you know a bite about that
S0248	we use them over here as well do we or not
S0247	no i don't think so i think they i think they've be erm repeat elsewhere in the world but i don't think they've be use in the uk
S0248	mm
S0247	so erm and there be quite a bite to read about that you know sort of erm stuff you know mount with explanations and things so that
S0248	mm yeah
S0247	wasn't a very explanation er exhibition but it be erm it be very interest and then i have a bite of a wander round the cos it's always there's always plenty to look at there you know so
S0248	be that like it's funny the museum i've be to them a few time i never really know which one i prefer or
S0247	yeah
S0248	or which you know
S0247	erm what be interest be the queue to get in the be massive
S0248	oh be it
S0247	really big but no queue to get in the
S0248	they people take their kid there more don't they
S0247	yeah but you'd think people would take their kid to the more you know
S0248	yeah i think it be cos you have like things where in the where the kid can actually
S0247	yeah
S0248	there's things they can things they can
S0247	interactive display and yeah there's lot i would've think there's more for kid in the
S0248	display yeah sure yeah yeah that it be
S0247	but i suppose a lot of children like dinosaurs don't they and that therefore
S0248	yeah it's get yeah
S0247	erm anyway when i go into the there be an advert for the imax 3d cinema and regular things go on you know so there be a erm something start about twenty five minutes later about the universe so i think i've never be to an imax cinema and i've never see an 3d film so i'll get a ticket for that so
S0248	where be that
S0247	it's actually in the
S0248	on in the
S0247	yeah yeah it's on the second floor erm so er it's quite a big erm auditorium and very well attend i mean not pack but
S0248	oh
S0247	you know lot of people do the same thing and you're give a pair of glass 3d glass to put on and there be a couple of advert just a advert for a car or you know i be dutifully wear my 3d glass think these don't make any difference at all you know keep on sort of peep over the top of them erm and obviously the advert obviously weren't 3d so i
S0248	i have some remembrance of do this as very young boy put some glass on
S0247	mm
S0248	to watch a certain
S0247	well when we be kid didn't we have those plastic glass that would be one red erm pane and one blue pane
S0248	type of thing yeah probably that but it couldn't've be 3d could it so
S0247	and that be mean to do something but anyway erm when you do get the the 3d effect it be unbelievable
S0248	mm
S0247	i mean really it's it it it make you jump the
S0248	be it
S0247	the an owl fly out of the screen pretty
S0248	mm mm
S0247	early on and you know and it's you know it really do feel very very close you know erm and erm so it be a film about er ostrominers astronomers
S0248	mm
S0247	and they erm the serious astronomers all work in the desert in chile because obviously you know if you you know if you want to look at the star you need
S0248	yeah
S0247	a
S0248	sure
S0247	zero light pollution from you know
S0248	yeah
S0247	and erm so he say you know this this erm guy they feature erm who be also play the piano so the we have you know follow him sort of arrive in chile and go to the desert and he's go to the top of a hill erm to work on the vlt so ask ask me what mean
S0248	it's something lettuce and tomato
S0247	no v not b
S0248	no no i know
S0247	oh and no it's not lettuce and tomato no
S0248	erm the vlt
S0247	yeah
S0248	er something er the visual land telescope
S0247	yeah well you get the telescope bite right the very large telescope
S0248	very large
S0247	and they've get four vlts in this erm place and erm the picture be fantastic the they say they be the actual picture that you're see you know it's not it's not some sort of special effect mock up and which be a bite because we've see so much on star war and things like that that you know you weren't sure what you be see but you know the
S0248	picture of what
S0247	erm galaxies and you know erm
S0248	oh right
S0247	erm the i it wasn't
S0248	it must be fantastic that sort of this mustn't it
S0247	yeah the i mean my only complaint really be that it wasn't very well explain
S0248	mm mm
S0247	it be like you know here's one where the star's explode and it didn't really tell you
S0248	mm
S0247	why or how and you know the the it be
S0248	do it matter it's only just
S0247	probably not i mean it be it be more visual impact than explain
S0248	yeah
S0247	you know the science behind it but i i didn't half the time i didn't really know what i be look at but it be very very erm impressive what they do and then there be another erm bigger a vvlt and they call this one erm alma i think this even bigger one erm
S0248	big alma
S0247	because they can't see erm they can only they can only penetrate light and so they have learn from the mosquito who can detect things by erm heat and movement and stuff like that so they they've get this different approach with this other alma telescope it's not just light it's also movement and stuff so you it can penetrate er past the you know where the where the other super duper telescope can see this one can see even further
S0248	wasn't that the name of ray moore's wife big big alma
S0247	ray moore the radio
S0248	yeah
S0247	yes and there be an alma on coronation street as well
S0248	he have a yeah no but i in er you you know use to call him er he be always on about big alma anyway er yeah sound great
S0247	so i can thoroughly recommend erm a 3d experience
S0248	mm
S0247	erm you you do sort of see a slight shadow i don't know whether it's cos my eye be not very good but you know you can sort of there's something a little bite fuzzy about the edge of erm figure and so on and i take when the credit go up and it be all write i take my glass off to see what that look like without the glass and it be all sort of like double you know you
S0248	there be 3d actual movies make now aren't there
S0247	oh yeah yeah
S0248	and do people sit with these glass on do they
S0247	yeah yeah yeah
S0248	as i say they try this years and years forty years ago nearly
S0247	yeah but i don't think they have the the the film technology right forty years ago like you know
S0248	yeah no probably not
S0247	erm the the the the techniques would've be very erm basic and crude they've get completely different film techniques now for 3d
S0248	mm yeah no it be the way it be pretty underwhelming then quite frankly
S0247	yeah yeah no this be impressive you would you would be impress with this
S0248	yeah
S0247	and also the imax experience as well be cos say that er film for imax be a different technique as well so you could have an imax film presumably that wasn't 3d but the screen's so big it's the height of it be er the height of four double decker bus
S0248	the height the screen be
S0247	the height of the screen yeah yeah
S0248	be it
S0247	enormous yeah so you get this very you i mean you can't you know can see the edge just but you know it's it's a very overwhelm sort of experience you know you do feel as if z in it
S0248	so what room be be you know be it where be it actually
S0247	on the second floor of the
S0248	for but you'd think it you say it's the height of all that
S0247	yeah
S0248	you know how come it's er be those be it take up do it go beyond the second floor
S0247	well maybe it go down you know
S0248	mm
S0247	it it might be like the edge of the build or something like the whole of the erm you know i dunno
S0248	yeah mm mm
S0247	but it's very it's enormous
S0248	mm
S0247	but of course there be that one at near waterloo isn't there at the roundabout the the imax one
S0248	yeah well i think that be an that yeah but but er
S0247	yeah it be yeah yeah mm
S0248	i know i'd hear it somewhere
S0247	yeah yeah so i don't know what the science of the film but i know say it's very very expensive process to film for imax so presumably as they be show it off the we would've have the combination of imax and 3d in this
S0248	mm
S0247	film
S0248	mm sorry so when you go out do you actually know about this imax thing
S0247	no no i i mean i kind of do but i'd forget really you know i i go out think i'll go to that people at work exhibition and then i think oh while i'm in the area i might as well go to the as well
S0248	mm
S0247	and erm you know this other exhibition about forbid object you know cos they're both free so
S0248	yeah no sure sure
S0247	i didn't need to book ticket to anything so but i do it in all the wrong order so i when i get there i go first of all to the and spend some time there and then when i go to the i go to this erm film i have a cup of tea in the twenty minutes i have to wait and then after i come out of the imax cinema i go to find the people at work exhibition so the thing i'd go for i be begin to think i'm run the risk here of actually not see that you know erm and then when i come out i think erm i might walk up to the and book a prom ticket for some time this week
S0248	okay
S0247	but i look and i i just didn't fancy walk i'd be traipse around a bite so i didn't really fancy walk up the and then much to my annoyance a three sixty
S0247	and i i could've catch it cos you know
S0248	mm
S0247	and i couldn't wouldn't have be able to get across the road and down to the bus stop so i decide i be gonna race this three sixty to
S0248	on the tube
S0247	on the tube yeah so i think if if the three sixty's get to sort of contend with traffic
S0248	mm
S0247	you know i think i could probably beat it if i catch the tube to and then just walk around the corner anyway
S0248	but you be not right
S0247	mm i be only just not right i think
S0248	you saw it in disappear into the distance
S0247	yeah when i come out of station it be just go round the corner
S0248	dear me
S0247	so so i just walk from there
S0248	think a bus good bus will always get a good tube will always beat a good bus
S0247	yeah but you what you forget be how far you have to walk from
S0248	oh sure yeah i mean you be stand to get a a distance to walk to station yeah
S0247	the museums back to back to station yeah you go in that tunnel you know it go on forever
S0248	i know it's bloody yeah long time i use to go in there years ago
S0247	yeah
S0248	oh we walk down there didn't we
S0247	yeah we do yeah uhu
S0248	cos you be on about some opera or something
S0247	yeah
S0248	oh oh a good afternoon be have by all
S0247	so it be yeah it be good yeah and erm i didn't i didn't get my proms ticket i
S0248	mm
S0247	didn't go in the but i didn't intend to do that
S0248	you can't do it all
S0247	can't do everything can you
S0248	you can't do it all i've always say that
S0247	no
