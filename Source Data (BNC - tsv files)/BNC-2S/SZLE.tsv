S0509	yeah so erm yeah at work be say that er well she be basically ask me whether i fancy come along to er this battle
S0510	right
S0509	an kind of open choir apparently this woman have send out invitations to all the people that she know one of these choirmasters erm and that include ah and she send out invitations to two hundred people and one hundred people turn up on monday night
S0510	wow
S0509	yeah
S0510	that's pretty
S0509	that's a good take up isn't it
S0510	that's pretty good isn't it
S0509	yeah that's what i think so fancy give it a go anyway she be ask me if i fancy it and i say you haven't hear me sing you wouldn't want if you if you'd hear me sing you wouldn't be ask me she's go oh no but you know you don't have to kind of be amaze it's it's all part you know it's more of a community thing and erm anyway i say probably not but i do tell her that although i i you know other than sing at home and be tell by my husband to stop sing you know that's how bad it be
S0510	ah that's bad
S0510	if you like if you can like match pitch a few time then you can definitely do it
S0509	mm aw right
S0510	but it's just effort
S0509	yeah well i do say to her that you'd be have sing lessons she's go oh oh sing lessons i say yeah she's get a good teacher at the guitar school which doesn't sound quite right do it
S0510	no
S0509	erm and she's go oh well maybe your daughter would be interest then i say no i think she's get rather a lot on
S0509	just a little bite erm but anyway it's nice of her to invite me along but er i be recount her my experience of erm the only kind of sing lessons if you like or sing group stuff that i've ever do other than the school choir but i think i get throw out for be out of tune anyway
S0509	i well i didn't get throw out but i remember
S0510	you get gently nudge towards the door
S0509	aw i remember the erm teacher sort of say oh keep come round by my group where i be sort of say there's somebody out of tune you know i don't remember last much longer after that but er
S0510	ah
S0509	whether that be my choice or hers be lose in the mist of time but
S0510	ah
S0509	but anyway erm i be tell her about yoga and sing
S0510	mm i think that be where this be go
S0509	mm and erm cos she be say to me you don't have to be that good and it's amaze if you've get a good teacher and all the rest of it er and i say about be a brilliant yoga teacher and a brilliant sing teacher as well cos she do all those community choir doesn't she erm and just cos she think it be a bizarre combination yoga and sing i say ah it's not that strange because
S0510	yeah
S0509	what she use to do be you know loosen up the muscle in your neck and in your diaphragm and
S0510	yeah what what's her book call jumbala or something
S0509	er jumbalani
S0510	jumbalani
S0509	jumbalani yeah and erm and so that really help prepare for get sound out and as i be say to her you didn't have to well in fact you're sort of you know deter what's the word erm
S0510	discourage
S0509	go away from yeah not discourage can't think can't think anyway
S0510	mm i know what you mean
S0509	from sing something that be know to everybody because you kind of almost take on an affectation of how you think it should sound
S0510	yeah
S0509	and so she be very clever in that what she do when she get us all sing together be erm get us sing in another language you know
S0510	mm
S0509	so a lot of it be sort of african tribal folk sort of sing which you know again you couldn't associate particular word with particular feel or whatever so it be just more the sound of the word
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	and so it be get the the voice and you know everything work to get that sound erm and and then she'd be very canny about place us once she get us all do certain note or certain phrase erm she'd listen and then she might mix us round a little bite because she'd figure out who be the you know
S0510	oh
S0509	baritones who be the sopranos and all the rest of it
S0510	sopranos
S0509	yeah and then get it so that we be all position where we could bounce off one another better
S0510	yeah nice
S0509	and and it never fail to surprise me at the end of each session when we do our joint you know number as it be erm even if it be just a chant of some kind
S0510	yeah
S0509	just the incredible depth and resonance of the sound that be come out of all of us really you know
S0510	mm
S0509	well you must find that with your sing teacher and some of the exercise he teach you
S0510	yeah yeah just some of them be so weird the exercise you have to do like monkey like i can't do it sit down
S0510	but you you go from like like down here to
S0509	yeah
S0510	hah but i can't i can't do it cos i'm sit down
S0510	but it's like hah hah hah
S0509	bite like monkey chant in baraka
S0510	but properly
S0509	do you remember the monkey yeah
S0509	oh very good
S0510	it's like no but i can't do it properly right now cos i'm
S0509	right
S0510	i'm just more horizontal sort of yeah
S0509	wow
S0510	i need to like be take breathe breaths properly and use my diaphragm
S0509	right
S0510	but just what we be say about jumbalani or whatever it be beforehand
S0509	mm mm
S0510	it remind me there's so many weird name in the play i'm do
S0509	oh be there

S0509	yeah well i guess you've get to get this year out of the way first haven't you so you've get your exam just after
S0510	yeah
S0509	but
S0510	it's in like a couple of weeks
S0509	yeah it be only well be it only a couple of weeks or be be three three weeks
S0510	exactly three weeks but one be go to be half term so
S0509	yeah
S0510	it's go to be next week
S0509	mm hm
S0510	okay so it's at the end of the fourth week
S0509	right okay yeah
S0510	but one week it's go to be half term i do get all of thursday and friday off timetable though to be fair
S0509	oh really
S0510	i may i think i might get wednesday off as well because we just get to do run and then we're do performances thursday and friday
S0509	yeah
S0510	which you can come to but ticket be six pound
S0509	oh well that's okay
S0510	yeah cos they be like erm and then they be you must try and get as many people as you can as you can to come you know to give you a nice supportive audience we be like how much be the ticket be they free
S0509	yeah
S0510	and they're like no they're six pound they wouldn't be free and it be like well in my school they be free
S0509	yes yeah
S0510	yeah
S0509	ah okay well that's an even one then on the thursday or the friday
S0510	yeah it's at seven
S0509	hold on a moment isn't the week after be the week after half term oh no it's the week after your birthday isn't it i be just think it's not your birthday be it
S0510	yeah no we before half term be my birthday
S0509	oh okay
S0510	yeah
S0509	well that's alright
S0509	plenty of time
S0510	yeah for like a half do play
S0509	ah
S0510	we will get it do
S0509	yeah you know how these things come together
S0510	i'll probably just
S0509	by hook or by crook
S0510	yeah just have to spend a lot of time go over my line cos i know them but i know them loosely and i need to be like
S0509	right
S0510	just i don't i need to be not even think about them just be like do
S0509	mm have you get it on audio tape or anything would it help though to have a
S0510	i don't like i don't like do it like that
S0509	oh really
S0510	no cos i don't i don't focus on it cos i'll be do other things and if i'm go to sit there i won't want
S0509	oh no i be think like you know a podcast on the way into college sort of thing
S0510	yeah but i don't think so
S0509	doesn't work for you
S0510	and also we've cut load of bits of it so i'd just get confuse i'd be like oh what's this and then it'd be like
S0509	ah right yeah
S0510	we cut an entire scene
S0509	right
S0510	we cut most of one of like the central character
S0510	because there's kind of the play be like kind of almost there's there's like the main bite but then there's like another like quarter of it that sort of slot in that's not really that much about the main bite
S0509	mm
S0510	and then it kind of link in to the main bite at the end
S0509	right
S0510	so cut most of that bite out
S0509	oh mm hm
S0510	and just keep the end bite
S0509	yeah
S0510	and it still make sense
S0509	right
S0510	i think
S0510	probably cos it's get to be short it's not it's not mean to be a long play
S0509	right so how long be the run time on it then
S0510	i don't know cos the the thing be there's go to be three play on that night and ours will be one of them and the other two group will be do theirs
S0509	ah okay
S0510	so i don't know what what order we're go to be in
S0509	oh so what the other drama group do different play
S0510	yeah
S0509	from texts
S0510	yeah
S0509	ah okay
S0510	we're actually quite lucky cos in our group we're only do one play amongst all of us in the other group they're do like two play
S0509	right mm
S0510	yeah it's like i think there's only one other group though so there might be two of us so it's like two to four other play apart from ours
S0509	okay
S0510	i no it must it must just be two others cos they've make a set that have to work for three play
S0509	ah
S0510	like i'm genuinely impress with what our teachers have well with what our main teacher at the moment have manage to come up with for that
S0509	really
S0510	cos to make the same set work for three play be like a feat
S0509	oh my goodness yeah well you know you
S0510	he's just get to stay there the whole time
S0509	you think about erm oh the victorian play that i do
S0510	yeah
S0509	you know the scene change in that i think that be really inventive the way they put them on erm you know roller roller well rollers basically and just switch them you know so that it be
S0510	yeah yeah but we i can't even do that really
S0509	no so it's get to be
S0509	so how be they differentiate then between each play be they just add a little few prop to sort of
S0510	well yeah we've get other prop for ourselves
S0509	mm
S0510	and we've get chair that come up the side but like we've get the chalk circle on the stage that's our bite
S0509	right
S0510	and then one of the other play have fence at the back and then one of the other play have all these crate at the back but we use the crate in our play as well and we keep stuff inside of them
S0509	oh okay mm
S0510	and then there's the archway which be for us and i think another play need it as well
S0509	right yeah
S0510	it's it's be very well do i have to say
S0509	yeah yeah
S0510	by what she's tell us of it
S0509	mm
S0510	but now we just need to get the puppet make
S0509	you've get a puppet on yours
S0510	like a puppet
S0509	really
S0510	a puppet child
S0509	puppet who's who's do the puppet
S0510	er i think one of the techies
S0509	oh okay
S0510	and and she be talk to him today cos he be go into his little room and she be like
S0509	box yeah
S0510	yeah and she be like have you start on the puppet and he be like no not yet
S0510	so that should be fun mm cos we need to rehearse for the puppet but the puppet's only in like half of it cos at the begin it's a baby and then it's like
S0509	oh i see oh yeah blimey that
S0510	i'm just hop it's limbs don't fall off
S0509	mm
S0510	that would that would really ruin the play
S0509	yeah he'd want to get crack on that what's it go to be a papier mâché one on spring or something
S0510	oh my god no it's it's go to be a wire a wire with like clothe over it
S0509	right mm
