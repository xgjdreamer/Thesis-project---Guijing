S0115	yeah it's really big isn't it
S0037	i'm gonna be like an old lady
S0115	it's really it's nearly as big as you be
S0037	that's not very nice
S0115	i didn't actually mean that in by put some
S0037	ah it's too late it's record
S0115	emphasis on the
S0037	i've hear that
S0115	emphasis on your size or something
S0115	it's nearly as
S0037	big as a person
S0115	small as the i can't say
S0037	yeah
S0115	it it's get bigger though isn't it i can't say it's nearly as
S0037	even bigger
S0115	small as you be i'll
S0037	no
S0115	um
S0037	don't worry
S0115	it's nearly as slim as you be
S0037	it's nearly as beautiful and slender as yourself
S0037	it's very silly
S0115	that'll be er
S0037	but i think i must still be like crochet it when i'm a hundred like go please be finish
S0115	yeah it look very hard to do that crochet as if you have to er you go you know just round and round and round and round all the time
S0037	well i'm not do er very complicate things
S0115	yeah
S0037	like some of the things be that you can do be really beautiful
S0115	yeah
S0037	but this be just like
S0115	well it look it look quite complicate the sort of knot of it it's get
S0037	yeah but if you look it's all just the same thing over and over and over and over again
S0115	well yeah i can see it's a repeat pattern but it do look pretty you know all those little sort of triangle shape be
S0037	no
S0115	there must be about a thousand or so of these little
S0037	it's keep me quiet
S0115	lumpy bits that don't look er that aren't so you're just work round and round it then
S0037	yeah but obviously like it just increase by i don't know how much that be like three centimetres every time
S0115	yeah
S0037	and you've gotta go all the way round so should have do it in like really fat wool and then i would've be finish but
S0115	oh maybe
S0037	it would have be expensive
S0115	oh right so
S0037	this one be from aldi
S0115	yeah
S0037	i go there and it be the guy be like ooo do a bite of craft i go yes please
S0115	they're er they're very cheap over there aren't they
S0037	yep
S0115	and er er it's handy to have the shop there so close
S0037	yeah i would be so annoy if it be like a waitrose and i have to be like oh i need a bottle of milk i'll have to go to waitrose and get one
S0115	yeah it would be would be quite
S0037	think how much money we would waste
S0115	annoy to live next to a waitrose
S0037	like at least it's just aldi that's just there
S0115	um we don't have a big waitrose around here though
S0037	there's that one at the grafton though
S0115	that's tiny
S0037	i dunno i've never really be in waitrose i don't know what that say about me but er
S0115	don't know how many they have in in the north east they might have
S0037	now there's a value judgement
S0115	a couple er well it's just not geographically associate with that i mean it cos up there if you're one of the more high end stuff
S0037	uh huh
S0115	you've get sort of er um
S0115	well morrisons be morrisons be nice isn't it yeah yeah yeah i know yeah
S0037	right yeah morrisons
S0115	and booths do you have booths up there
S0037	in lancaster that's a north west thing booths
S0115	cos it's not a yeah they they probably have some
S0037	no you've offend us
S0115	more some different er
S0037	get my high quality shop from morrisons
S0115	er i like morrisons
S0115	it's one of my favourite er
S0037	oh yeah yeah
S0115	one be in er morrisons cos it's kinda like a a market isn't it it's like be in a
S0037	i do like it
S0115	market
S0037	there use to be prestos and um my nana use to work in prestos
S0115	er on the till
S0037	on the till and that be like a bite more like i suppose aldi's a bite use to be a bite like that but now they've get scanners but like in prestos like they just have a little piece of you know those little ticket like you get in little corner shop and stuff with the number on and you just have to ow
S0115	oh you mean the cashier
S0037	yeah
S0115	or whatever they're call er
S0037	yeah there wasn't barcodes and that obviously
S0115	have to um have to type in the number
S0037	yeah
S0115	er every time
S0037	yeah
S0115	so they didn't scan yeah though that'd be
S0037	but i think actually when if i if i'm not mistake when aldi and that get go over here i think they didn't you have to know all the price of the things in the shop if you work there i don't think they have barcode scanners back in the day but that might just be another fable like my lloyd grossman er truth so
S0115	um but yeah that he's he's get deadly er well i have here the ability to er
S0037	oh well then check it then

S0037	it could have be anybody
S0115	that guy didn't want to be name do he um
S0037	i didn't want to commit to that tell very tell statement it's like what's obviously happen here be
S0115	obviously yeah it's er
S0037	that's funny so you so i didn't imagine it
S0115	you have the no that's an interest little bite of fact you should never just think that it's safe to eat a sauce because you never know what could get into it but
S0037	i also hear that about like
S0115	like in the jar like people always
S0037	when be it
S0115	go round
S0037	oh it be the pickle the pickle man do you remember oh in
S0115	er pickle man
S0037	be it germany there be a a recently like there be that outbreak of some other sort of like
S0115	oh be this be this the serial killer or something that go round put poison in pickle pickle poisoner
S0037	mm er maybe
S0115	oh
S0037	or may not be bear that in mind no
S0115	no no i'm just base it on this food poison case
S0037	no it be um the beansprouts thing do you remember
S0115	oh yeah well there be that case
S0037	they say it be like
S0115	of um
S0037	they say it be it a german a turkish market
S0115	er that disease which be um what be the disease er it be
S0037	i can't remember
S0115	there be a few case in germany and it it be trace back to beansprouts that er
S0037	that's right
S0115	the the germans blame
S0037	yeah
S0115	the german media blame spain
S0037	spanish
S0115	cost the
S0037	that's right
S0115	cost the spanish economy
S0037	that's right yeah
S0115	huge amount of money
S0037	well like no one want to but spanish cucumbers or something
S0115	then like spanish cucumber yeah and er
S0037	stupid isn't it
S0115	but actually i think it come from egypt or something in the end when it be er
S0037	beansprouts
S0115	um but disease yeah be fatal wasn't it but er
S0037	i can't remember what it be
S0115	i can't remember what the disease er so um
S0115	there's i mean it be there's a lot of ways that that actually with food that that you can contract like something with even via like
S0037	yeah but if if you always think about that though you would never
S0115	intentional poison or er ill yeah but
S0037	but you would never eat anything
S0115	intentional or accidental poison um well yeah no no of of course it's precautions just
S0037	if you're worry about that all the time
S0115	there's precautions cos like what they say with these case of er whatever the virus be er
S0037	yeah
S0115	that that
S0037	the cucumber one
S0115	er beansprout be that obviously you're you're worse if it's er raw
S0037	yeah
S0115	like raw if
S0037	if you haven't cook them
S0115	you're eat raw fresh things then i suppose if you wash them first you're better off er any time you go to a restaurant i suppose there's always a risk there
S0037	well you don't know what's happen
S0115	it's er
S0037	but i don't think it put me off spain like i think i'd quite like to go
S0115	well no it wouldn't put you off spain cos it wasn't spain that er
S0037	no that's true actually yeah
S0115	that do it in the first place
S0115	it be er it be egypt er
S0037	be it egypt
S0115	i think or it it could be trace cos it sort of the the you know the lorry er carry these
S0037	oh right
S0115	beansprouts be like leave like you know don't maybe stop off or or like perhaps it get
S0037	but that's the thing like
S0115	it may have get contaminate on the journey you see
S0037	that's the thing with these like diseases like that and you know like what be it be it swine flu or bird flu or one of the the ones recently like before you realize there's be a outbreak it's like all round the world
S0115	um
S0037	you know you
S0115	yeah like this
S0037	you you carry you it you one person but then you get on a aeroplane with three hundred people now they've all they're all carry it and they all go to their place
S0115	well there's
S0037	and pass it on and
S0115	it be a bite a bite sort of scaremongering with the er the swine flu i think
S0037	yeah
S0115	er that be maybe in two thousand and nine or something there be a swine flu epidemic and there be a lot of
S0037	my mum have it i think
S0115	there be a lot of stuff go on about i think it be when actually we we move into our regent street flat
S0037	yeah
S0115	cos be there and er it be er
S0037	i'm sure my mum have swine flu
S0115	it be er yeah and er someone do at my er my work actually and it it they be they be sort of report it and in some ways it be good that they're follow and give you the information about this
S0037	yeah
S0115	but think of the reverse they're also scar a lot of people
S0037	yeah
S0115	basically this flu as far as i understand it be just normal
S0037	normal flu
S0115	it be just a kind of flu so the the symptoms of it be be essentially just flu symptoms
S0037	yeah
S0115	but you have to always brand it as as
S0037	but how would you know
S0115	a particularly horrible one
S0037	how would you know if you have normal flu or swine flu
S0115	er i don't know if you if you
S0037	do you have to get test
S0115	could know yourself but i don't know if it if the
S0037	but i don't think they test everyone
S0115	i don't know if the symptoms really matter i mean it's not it's not threaten life threaten for er people unless you're sort of young and old isn't it
S0037	yeah
S0115	it's the youngest and oldest that that er
S0037	that's true
S0115	tend to be er at risk
S0037	and people who be already poorly
S0115	with flu yeah or if you have like an immunodeficiency syndrome or something er but if like
S0037	i tell you another i you hear scare stories don't you like i remember when i live at home when i be little and there be a woman who live over the road and she get chickenpox and she get chickenpox inside her lungs and she die like
S0115	oh
S0037	that's weird isn't it
S0115	well i guess you just have to i mean like the er i that sound like it could've be like er nowadays without technology that that could have be er
S0037	no i think well it wasn't i mean i'm not that old
S0115	yeah
S0037	be i it be only like
S0115	oh yeah no i didn't mean like
S0037	twenty years ago or something
S0115	no i didn't mean like er polio or something i i just mean er um maybe that person be exceptionally like
S0037	yeah i don't know
S0115	prone to it or something or
S0037	yeah maybe
S0115	um
S0037	it's suppose to be really bad if you get it when you're old like
S0115	yeah
S0037	them sort of things
S0115	er that be er what be that do you say it be
S0037	chickenpox i think
S0115	chickenpox
S0037	i think they've get rid of smallpox
S0115	now that's actually go huh
S0037	although they probably still do it in labs like squirt in rats' eye and all that
S0115	er well yeah cos that's cos it be a it be a sort of a cow
S0037	er someone must've give it to her
S0115	wasn't it connect with it be connect with cow wasn't it or
S0037	i dunno
S0115	there's cowpox i mean i don't know
S0037	be it
S0115	well there's there be cowpox and that's how they do all the
S0037	oh
S0115	they know that like like the milk um tut what do they call them milk milkmaids that
S0037	milkmaids
S0115	milkers yeah
S0037	oh that sound familiar
S0115	milkmen and milkmaids get
S0037	the milk er the milk people
S0115	they they be get cowpox off the er
S0037	the dairy removal operatives
S0115	yeah yeah yeah the the the sort of er yeah er facilitators er
S0037	yeah
S0115	yeah renderers um managers cow cow
S0037	cow employees
S0115	move milk transport managers
S0115	or something milk transfer managers
S0115	yeah so executive er
S0115	milk
S0037	dairy
S0115	operators or something so they
S0037	facilitators
S0115	they er
S0115	they be get cowpox off the cows' udders but
S0037	urgh
S0115	that that be i think actually protect them against er smallpox i think although although you've gotta watch that
S0037	there's a few ones isn't there like um
S0115	because and it no of course that be the birth of vaccination and stuff
S0037	like sickle cell anaemia and malaria
S0115	yeah that's one of them things where i'm although unfortunately with that one you you get another you get another
S0037	yeah you're knackered
S0115	nasty disease
S0037	yeah sickle cell anaemia's not very nice
S0115	whereas the vaccination one be that it er because the you know you've be expose to that other one which be not life threaten
S0037	yeah
S0115	because er and that's the principle that you're sort of teach the body to er teach the immune system to um recognize and and er destroy the er virus or bacteria i'm not sure if it's virus or bacteria but
S0037	i'm not sure
S0115	er but yeah so um that be the sort of the birth of of vaccination with that er
S0037	yeah
S0115	the the the the milkmaids things er
S0037	oh i still remember get my tb like the eternally like horrify by the whole thing do i tell you about it i will have tell you about it
S0115	oh yeah
S0037	when i be like a trainee nurse
S0115	oh yeah no yeah yeah you have um
S0037	i don't i i don't really need to go through that again
S0115	no it's last year i i be really scar of injections i mean i don't mind them too much now but that when i have to have that first one it be the first ever injection that i'd have and it be something like

S0037	no you have them when you're little don't you
S0115	sort of thirteen years old though
S0037	you mean when you
S0115	oh the first one that i can really consciously
S0037	yeah

S0037	i remember have like polio at junior school or something

S0037	a carrot stick
S0115	a virus on the on the
S0037	dip in polio
S0115	but er yeah
S0037	that's stupid
S0115	er put the salad with er i dunno
S0115	like salmonella
S0037	with a lovely polio dress on the side
S0115	yeah that's
S0037	interest
S0115	er
S0037	stupid
S0115	um so that
S0037	i don't mind injections though
S0115	there's a lot of er
S0037	i don't love them but
S0115	you you've get um some some some people in your family i believe be have er er major sort of medical stories er
S0037	oh i'm not gonna get
S0115	have a fondness for
S0037	old nana on it
S0115	er like fondness for you know for gory detail about er hospital
S0037	well that's what i be say like there be like when you know obviously 's have a have a baby and that and like when they be my nana i could literally one once she know that be the case i literally saw her eye light up at the like the think of retell all of these like horrific medical dramas of years go by
S0115	well do you do you see the moment when she find out
S0037	no they be on the phone but i could just
S0115	yeah
S0037	i be use some artistic license there but like literally you know i can see her in her face it's just like she want to like
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	tell all of these
S0115	yeah
S0037	like horrific medical blunder like it's really not what you wanna hear i imagine
S0115	um yeah i mean er
S0037	she's be awful like
S0115	they they like she she can be cos it's easy to get scar isn't it if you have a if you have some symptoms and you know and you go on the internet and
S0037	well yeah
S0115	or or you talk to you talk to someone like your er nana or whatever
S0037	yeah
S0115	and you know they might say oh you've get a oh be that a rash well it could be you know it it probably isn't
S0037	be it the plague it might be
S0115	it it be probably isn't you know like
S0037	yeah
S0115	meningitis but it you know there be this one time when er there be a kid
S0037	oh goodness
S0115	round round our street or something and have a rash on on his finger and and and it
S0037	but to be fair though she have have her fair share of like medical emergencies
S0115	yeah but if your brother um
S0037	and my grandad have that
S0115	yeah
S0037	anaphylaxia thing and
S0037	but part of her secretly delight in it like the the the drama of it i'm sure of it
S0115	well i think she she would have make a good nurse wouldn't she
S0037	i don't know could you imagine would she not do your head in
S0115	um
S0037	like eh hello pet
S0115	er well i dunno
S0037	she wouldn't get anything do
S0115	i mean because i
S0037	she'd just be chatter on tell you about
S0115	think i prefer a noisy nurse to like like a sort of er eerie nurse that like
S0037	i don't know i haven't be in
S0115	that you don't know when they like they come in
S0037	yeah
S0115	and you don't know they're there cos they're so quiet like i don't like that
S0037	i dunno i haven't be in hospital for like myself for since i be a little very little person
S0115	no no i i haven't um er be in in hospital
S0037	since the i have my grommets
S0115	no i can't remember really be er ever actually
S0037	no
S0115	er
S0037	on my adenoids not that you would think it
S0115	um er but er just to visit people
S0037	yeah
S0115	um
S0037	they're horrible aren't they they smell really bad
S0115	er they're they can be a bite sort of er like i think the um
S0037	and i think when you go and see old people who be in hospital
S0115	it's a bite grim isn't it have to stay overnight i think
S0037	it's just er a bite like when they're in when they're in like a ward with flood of like crazy other old people and that
S0037	it's a bite much
S0115	yeah i think er er i it it'd be hard to have to stay overnight and stuff i mean
S0037	yeah
S0115	i suppose it's better if you if you have your own
S0037	little room
S0115	room or or something or er get
S0037	private healthcare
S0115	like you get your your
S0037	but that thing about the tv that's just
S0115	your family to live in you know get your your family to live to stay with you so that you're not on your own
S0037	yeah
S0115	it's better
S0037	i dunno if you can though
S0115	i dunno it depend what you've get
S0037	but that thing about like the tv you know like if you're in hospital if you're in hospital now you have to pay to watch the tv like how be that right
S0115	oh yeah the tv thing um
S0037	that's so bad
S0115	i hope that
S0037	i still can't get over that like i think that's shock
S0115	well i think it's the price of it actually rather than the the act of pay that's
S0037	it's the what sorry
S0115	the price it's it's it's er they they have a
S0037	yeah but even if it be a pound a day i would still be like i think that would still be wrong
S0115	i mean well yeah er er it would be better to have um
S0037	cos if you've pay for your tv licence like
S0115	yeah like a like a free yeah you should get maybe a a couple of free channel like freeview or something
S0037	cos if you
S0115	yeah
S0037	if you're like a little old lady and you've pay
S0115	yeah
S0037	you've pay for your tv licence
S0115	all your life yeah
S0037	but you can't watch it in your house because you're in hospital like it's not like you're do anything naughty it's just that you're not in your own house to watch your own tv like i think it's really bad
S0115	i mean er i i think that they should definitely give you some free channel for the for the yeah the in the in hospital
S0037	yeah
S0115	er thing so they have they those those screen don't they so you can have internet and phone and um the way it just
S0037	well maybe
S0115	the way it work be obviously it's er outsource to some company um they
S0037	yeah
S0115	i mean there's just
S0037	but i think it just it's prejudice against the old people though
S0115	it's it's you're put it's not a it's not a competitive market at the moment at all cos you're just outsource the the bed
S0037	yeah
S0115	er to one you know one hospital will outsource to one company therefore that's no competition there at all and then um
S0037	but i think like it's just penalize old people because like if we be in hospital
S0115	yeah younger people as well wouldn't be so yeah yeah
S0037	you'd take your smartphone you'd have a laptop like some dvds
S0115	well i mean well they they do they be try to stop that as well because you see the company have an incentive that it want its own
S0037	yeah
S0115	phone service and its own internet
S0037	but surely it can't
S0115	service to be use so it the company be gonna wanna try and er stop people from um
S0037	i don't think you can though can you
S0115	i i think the way it's work be that that people do want
S0037	machine
S0115	to have a screen people do want to have a screen but how it's end up in that situation where you've get
S0037	yeah it's stupid
S0115	a company require a certain amount of profit for every hospital for those screen i i it it doesn't seem to have work out like in in in the right way i i just think it er it should um there should be a way to get the free to get some free
S0037	yeah
S0115	channel to er the mainly older people in the bed
S0037	poorer people
S0115	and er i i think um
S0037	no it's pretty shock
S0115	you know you'd obviously if you've get to pay for the service if you've get to pay for the the
S0037	yep
S0115	screen but um
S0037	i wonder what we'll be like when we're old people like there probably won't even like tv'll probably be beam straight into your brain or something
S0115	oh yeah well i mean well they use to have you just have you just have like one one tv didn't you in some place
S0037	cos i remember i still remember have a tv
S0115	that you share
S0037	that be in like a big wooden box and you have to get up and like there be like four button and then like you could change the channel by press those big square button and then if you push on it like a thing come out and it have like a little slidery dial thing
S0115	yeah well
S0037	do you remember those
S0115	well i've see i didn't have such a such a big one as
S0037	well i be cut edge me
S0115	a big one as that i mean i have like we have a black and white one that just have a single dial that that you turn
S0037	yeah
S0115	i think
S0037	like djoo like
S0115	yeah so you actually have to find its position on the dial then yeah then i have like a colour one that and they have the button and you have to tune each button
S0037	yeah that's what i mean
S0115	er
S0037	but there be never a remote or anything
S0115	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah er tune so that's that's an advantage and then then you get to a remote which be er better still er
S0037	but now they have all them
S0115	now we've get digital so er you it sort of do itself which be better still so it's it's it's quite an improvement
S0037	but i don't understand like so like that tv like it's still a big like square box tv but why would you just throw it out just to get a flat one it just seem stupid
S0115	er
S0037	if that explode i wouldn't buy necessarily another big square tv like that i would probably buy a flat one
S0115	yeah
S0037	but i'm not gonna throw that out to buy a flat one
S0115	no well i mean i think some people just like to have the latest technology don't they and er
S0037	but there's nothing wrong with that tv
S0115	i know well i think
S0037	well actually
S0115	i think the majority of people would er it's alright actually er
S0037	it do make like a brr sound if the volume's up too high
S0115	i'm not sure that's it or one of the other machine actually
S0037	do you think it's the digibox
S0115	i don't think it's the the tv's fault but um you can always plug in another amplifier as we do um
S0037	yeah till i snap it
S0115	till you break the wire
S0037	yeah
S0115	of that er
S0037	oh well
S0115	but we um
S0037	i bet that's only like 1p that wire though
S0115	yeah but i think most people would not throw something away unless it it be break but
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	well you normally you normally get a new flash tv you know a a a
S0037	do you remember that pub
S0115	spectacular sort of massive flatscreen tv with a you know like a
S0037	yeah
S0115	as big as a sofa size tv
S0037	yeah
S0115	and then install it like um
S0037	i think
S0115	and then you'd but you'd keep the other one the the fat old one as well you'd keep that
S0037	yeah
S0115	put that in like the baby's room or something
S0037	the bedroom but
S0115	and the baby can have its own
S0115	remote control and stuff
S0037	i think i'd quite like that like um surround sound i don't know if i'm that bother about a new tv but i like the idea of like the you know when you have all the speakers in all different place in the room
S0115	er oh yeah yeah yeah
S0037	you have one in like every corner
S0115	er i think your er i think your mum have er something like that
S0037	do she
S0115	in er
S0037	i can't remember
S0115	i think there be like a maybe six
S0037	oh yeah
S0115	or so
S0037	when we be at the house yeah
S0115	there be six or so speakers line up and er
S0037	yeah she would have though but yeah like i think you can get all sort of different things like with with um be like say about like i think he's get a surround sound thing but it only come out of one place but it like just blast the sound at different
S0115	who's that
S0037	er christmas day be he not say about that
S0115	oh um tut er he he's really one of those people who who have to have the the latest technology so
S0037	yeah
S0115	i definitely believe that er he's get
S0037	i'm sure he have get like a special
S0115	he bring he bring something
S0037	special
S0115	quite
S0037	speakery thing
S0115	yeah and he have it in his er bedroom or something but he er
S0037	that's right
S0115	he also have well he have a he have a ipod no um
S0037	yeah
S0115	the other one the other one
S0037	iphone
S0115	yeah he have a iphone um and he'd get well he's
S0037	i dunno
S0115	he's their big their big present that he'd get be er their big tech present be the er it be um
S0037	ipad
S0115	it be a it be that camera er
S0037	oh yeah
S0115	it be that that
S0037	fancy camera
S0115	camera that take load of photos in in one one of your click and then it
S0037	oh yeah
S0115	give you the best so it will take for example five before you've click
S0037	yeah that's right
S0115	five after you've click and run at say er in one second it might take ten in ten per second or something like that
S0037	yeah
S0115	and then find the best er
S0037	yeah
S0115	you know the best
S0037	cos i saw that on
S0115	best one and it'll give you give you a choice of the the best ones yeah
S0037	cos they do that on like wildlife photography don't they because like you know i saw it on
S0115	yeah
S0037	be it freeze planet
S0115	yeah to
S0037	what be the other one call
S0115	to make sure that you've capture like cos yeah
S0037	yeah cos
S0115	yeah to to make it like as if it's film it er twenty five frame a second or something you can then have twenty five photos
S0037	yeah
S0115	per second
S0037	but i think that on on
S0115	to choose from
S0037	on freeze planet it be because like say if they be wait for like a um tut a whale to like burst through the surface
S0115	yeah you
S0037	like you
S0115	you can't guarantee that it click on time no
S0037	by the time you've press it it like it it's already happen hasn't it so i think it record even before you've press the button which be pretty cool it's like quite space age
S0115	er yeah yeah well it's it's essentially film it isn't it
S0037	yeah
S0115	at twenty five frame per second
S0037	yeah
S0115	but then it it simply take a a section like
S0037	yeah
S0115	one second or two second out of that film
S0037	yeah
S0115	and use that
S0037	for the picture
S0115	then restart and and begin film again and then er repeat itself like that so instead of take one photo you're actually take maybe twenty five or fifty photos
S0037	yeah
S0115	and then you can choose the best out of that and that's apparently quite a big breakthrough i think
S0037	yeah
S0115	or something or quite a big step er i myself
S0037	i wonder how it judge which one's the best like
S0115	mm
S0037	cos i don't think it show you every one do it cos how would you be able to judge cos there's just be like
S0115	er
S0037	especially if you be take something that wasn't move
S0115	well it it have some automatic it have some automatic feature i mean er you could imagine that for face recognition it would sort of
S0037	yeah if your eye be close
S0115	it'd be able to sort of
S0037	oh i hate the picture when like
S0115	exclude them yeah
S0037	you look really drink cos your eye be like half close
S0037	i'm glad if something can get rid of those
S0115	well yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0037	i hate that kind of thing
S0115	er you do that's probably one of the main reason actually i think close eye and look away i think you could get with like a face er recognition
S0037	yeah
S0115	er software would be able to do that but er also i suppose move er if you move like if you're take twenty twenty five frame a second
S0037	yeah
S0115	you don't get the you probably wouldn't get a smudge would you
S0037	i don't think so
S0115	not not that you'd have to be move quite fast to get to get a smudge on er
S0037	yeah
S0115	twenty five frame a second um
S0037	that face recognition stuff i can't remember who be tell me er no i can't remember about how the you know in airports
S0115	yeah i've be i know airports yeah
S0037	well in airports like apparently they've track like people's movements and behaviour normal people like most people what they do
S0115	you're back back onto er privacy here yeah
S0037	um i dunno i just think that
S0115	when when you say that what do you mean track people's behaviour or
S0037	so if we go airport we might
S0115	cos that could mean that could mean like they know whether you've tie your shoelaces or
S0037	but tie your shoelaces
S0115	yeah
S0037	probably like so so say normally when you go through security you you would go and check see where your flight be what what gate maybe what do it hasn't be
S0115	yeah there's sort of a like
S0037	call yet
S0115	there's a bite of a
S0037	then you might go to boot
S0115	procedure that you follow isn't there
S0037	and get some a glass of water just to drink and
S0115	yeah so do do they mean that they're they're not perhaps necessarily target individuals they're target like the crowd and it
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	to see what people do
S0037	but then but then by by model what people do so go to boot then go and look in
S0115	yeah sit in a cafe
S0037	try some sunglasses on
S0115	for five hours yeah
S0037	go and have three pints of beer even though it's one in the morning or three in the morning or whatever
S0115	that's one of the good things about er
S0037	i know that's one of the good things like about airports
S0115	about airports be that be that you can sort of break rule that normally you you follow
S0037	yeah
S0115	so
S0037	rule don't apply but um anyway so they map like people's behaviour and then base on that they can see people who be act strangely
S0115	er when you say er act strangely do you just mean not do what the
S0037	what do
S0115	the crowd be do because
S0037	yeah
S0115	but then i suppose obviously there's always like statistically a a sort of a long tail so to speak the the
S0037	well yeah
S0115	er the weird the weird um
S0037	yeah but i don't think it's
S0115	people who yeah
S0037	i don't think it's decisive i i'm not say like anybody who's not do what everyone else be do be gonna be rugby tackle to the grind by like security force
S0115	i i think there's certain things yeah like
S0037	but i think it would flag them
S0115	well they'll then start they'd start spy on on the weirdly
S0037	mm
S0115	behaviour people wouldn't they er i think there's obvious things like if i mean we've see some of these custom program
S0037	oh i love those
S0115	don't you like uk border force or something that get on
S0037	in fact let's put some on
S0115	pick pick tv tune into pick tv or
S0037	oh can't put um er really
S0115	like er on um yeah really and er uk border force for example um
S0037	and er what's the er australian one
S0115	there's something you see if you see footage of people who be do something dodgy like generally i mean say they're smuggle i think there's a tendency to be er
S0037	a bite tense
S0115	er
S0037	kind of
S0115	i think there's also like if you be if i be smuggle something i think i would wanna act normal
S0037	yeah
S0115	you know what i mean but
S0037	but
S0115	you can't
S0037	no
S0115	always really act normal but you might try to act normal um so i don't know how like what what example like would you give of of someone give away the fact that they're they've get like
S0037	i don't know
S0115	two kilograms of coke in their stomach or something
S0037	i don't know like i suppose you would you would be agitate wouldn't you you would be sweaty you would like be more like i would be er well i mean er i imagine i would be like
S0115	yeah
S0037	really tense but i'm sure be calm and be
S0115	yeah i think you would
S0037	tense pretend to be calm er look different
S0115	yeah i mean but this be you'd probably be go on like
S0037	like you know when you're
S0115	really spy and like really like body language sort of thing i er
S0037	yeah but i think that's what that's what it be
S0115	be that what you mean
S0037	yeah
S0115	not actual
S0037	i think so
S0115	like what like scratch your nose or something too many time and
S0037	but i think so
S0115	can give away
S0037	i mean they've get so many cameras i'm sure someone be do a phd on it i can't remember who be tell me now oh well
S0115	what from a for what subject
S0037	um i don't know i don't know what that would come under some sort of computer science thing or
S0115	the the sort of body language recognition or something
S0037	yeah like it's kinda like face recognition so i suppose like computer science
S0115	yeah
S0037	mm
