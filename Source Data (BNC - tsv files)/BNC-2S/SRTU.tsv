S0024	key skills and strategies
S0144	but the exercise don't start for another
S0024	there
S0144	two so they've gotta read that first
S0024	page four we've get to go through this first yeah that's the difficult part of the class it's it's like so dry and no
S0144	continue ideas okay so it's refer back so this these yeah and use subject yeah okay
S0024	what just let them read it on their own or what
S0144	don't know
S0144	just get them to start read things out in class
S0024	writers what be these markers with a noun either a synonym for the idea in the earlier sentence or a general word here be a list of general word that may follow a continue idea marker's
S0144	mm
S0024	okay
S0144	mm
S0024	mm strategies
S0144	uhu

S0024	oh no
S0144	do you remember
S0024	oh
S0024	but they've get to fit all ten in so
S0144	yeah so for the purpose of the exercise there's only one way it work so
S0024	yeah
S0144	erm and then this one what do they do the first one mm
S0024	oh they're just connect the two sentence together basically in order to answer the question they've get to realise the answer to the question isn't in just one sentence it's in two
S0144	right what
S0024	the answer to the question be in two sentence not one
S0024	that's it ah don't worry about it
S0144	what no hang on students who have no interest in school often disturb high school class this this
