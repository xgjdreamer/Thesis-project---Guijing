S0439	she be fine yeah she come in a little bite after me she come in like ten minutes after me but
S0481	well you be run together though
S0439	well we do we get to ten miles together and then she start to drop off a bite and
S0481	and you
S0439	no no no i try but it be quite difficult
S0481	it's quite yeah i find it yeah it's like yeah
S0439	it's quite difficult to run at someone else's pace
S0481	i know it's the same as cycle you've just gotta go at your pace
S0439	yeah
S0481	and erm you know it's okay if you're in a team and you're behind somebody else you'll be
S0439	yeah
S0481	but as you go on further you just can't do it can you
S0439	yeah like i try and stuff and it kind of become really annoy because people keep walk which i realise don't get me wrong it be thirteen miles and it be long but they just they don't walk they don't suddenly like go to the side and walk they walk in the middle of the run and you're just like oh so you just end up like weave around them
S0481	well no i mean i just think if you can't run thirteen miles don't do the
S0439	well yeah don't enter it yeah
S0481	fuck thirteen miles yeah
S0439	yeah i i do
S0481	you know
S0439	think that like there be people
S0481	i mean a thirteen mile walk be be anybody could do a thirteen mile
S0439	yeah
S0481	bloody walk
S0439	there be like people walk really early on and you're just like why do you enter like i actually i do actually run all of it i didn't walk once
S0481	particularly as it's on a ballot be it
S0439	yeah
S0481	yeah
S0439	some of it's for charity
S0481	yeah
S0439	some people get charity place
S0481	yeah
S0439	but then you kind of like you're you're raise money because you're gonna run this run and you don't run it you walk it and it's a bite like
S0439	what's the point if you can't run thirteen miles
S0481	well no there's not point do it yeah i know
S0439	don't enter the half marathon yeah
S0481	i know
S0439	but no it be really good they have load of like great north run events go on on saturday
S0481	good

S0439	and i be like i be not wait in this bollocks be i and no one question me no one say anything i be like i be not wait
S0481	they're british they're british
S0439	yeah
S0481	they just tut tutted you
S0439	they probably do but i didn't care i be like i have to get i have to get back to newcastle have a shower and then get on the half past five train i be not wait in that queue
S0481	how far out of newcastle be it then

S0481	oh right you would have think they'd organise that a bite better wouldn't you
S0439	yeah the metro be have a real problem they be have real issue with the metro today so i don't know if it's normally like that bad but today it be horrendous
S0481	wouldn't have think so
S0439	yeah and like the problem be like this the the metro have to move to a station and it couldn't move on till the train in front of it have move on from the next station so it be just this massive this really bad stagger process so
S0481	oh right
S0439	we'd er be wait at station for about five ten minutes at a time
S0481	oh so they cock up
S0439	yeah
S0481	i mean it just be difficult i mean you
S0439	oh yeah with that many people

S0481	yeah that's all everybody's all cram up together
S0439	yeah
S0481	i never like do that at all
S0439	no
S0481	i'd rather drive and wait in a carpark than try and go on the tube i didn't enjoy that
S0439	i've be on the the few time i've be on the tube it's be okay but it's because after the match we've normally go somewhere afterwards for a drink just to let

S0439	everything go down
S0481	that take a long time to get down though doesn't it that tube
S0439	mm yeah go to the and have a drink
S0481	so like we wait a long time and i i get back to and they have two two blokes from yorkshire have miss the train back to yorkshire

S0439	no but
S0481	i mean in two weeks' time there's another air show i think but
S0439	oh right
S0481	which we'll try and fit i think there's an air show come up erm we'll try and fit one in for him so yeah erm
S0439	mm
S0481	well it's difficult to find things in the winter
S0439	and it's basically cos you've get to sit outside so
S0481	yeah well that be the problem with tour de with with the tour you know
S0439	yeah
S0481	you it say well they're gonna be here the the the the road's close twenty minutes before they come through
S0439	mm
S0481	well you can more or less know when they're gonna come through in
S0439	yeah
S0481	but you can't guess er two hours later because you don't know what the gap be so
S0439	yeah
S0481	so there could be er they could be either nor there the cars could be either here nor there and it it be harder to organise i've never really try to do it so i just give up i didn't even bother
S0439	how be the weather er today
S0481	it be
S0439	be the weather good today
S0481	yeah we be on an open top bus
S0439	yeah
S0481	and we arrive at the bus stop and erm there be a peculiar see and anyway the some people have pre book and i mean that well
S0439	yeah so why do you have an open top bus tour of
S0481	yeah well it be open it be open build
S0439	oh okay as well
S0481	in
S0439	okay that make more sense i just think
S0481	yeah so we have this to go round and show you round place in so i didn't know you could book on it so we we just we get there early and and and sign up well all people be complain that they couldn't book oh fuck hell it's free you know get on with it
S0481	so we be downstairs and then we get there and when we come back at half past ten erm she be fannying around well some people haven't turn up so if we put people on the top they might have to come down again so we'll wait till half ten anyway we get up on the top and then he say some people then turn up who have
S0439	pre book
S0481	they'd pre book so they want to but say we'll have to go back you know we don't have to go back down
S0439	yeah
S0481	so so we stand up to go back down and the bloke say well we can squeeze her in at the back there look er and you sit down there mate you you'll you'll be okay
S0439	yeah
S0481	and you
S0439	she's like
S0481	so so this
S0439	she's an eighty odd year old woman bless her
S0481	so this this couple a lady and her daughter
S0439	mm
S0481	kick us out of our our seat
S0439	mm
S0481	me and mother
S0481	you know no sort of oh bloody hell
S0439	yeah
S0481	and then a family this this lad they have a young kid and the kid just didn't wanna do it
S0439	oh
S0481	so be he get on the top of the bus and think that no i don't wanna do this so they get off so that alleviate all the problems
S0439	kid be kid be so annoy
S0481	and there be er a bloke do a rather dry droll talk as we go round er an hour and twenty minutes go round it be
S0439	mm
S0481	place we hadn't all around the jewellery quarter round and
S0439	mm
S0481	bits and bob on there that i didn't i'd never be round most of the most of the tour so it certainly wasn't waste
S0439	that's cool
S0481	part of it be shit
S0439	yeah but obviously
S0481	so
S0439	it's
S0481	then you see the
S0439	of course part of it's crap
S0481	you you see the back of these place and good god you know
S0439	yeah
S0481	and then it's you know it it's and you i wouldn't say he be well the point i haven't be on a bus trip i won't say ever but er and i've only be on some boat trip
S0439	mm
S0481	and you don't go down roads on boat trip so
S0439	well no obviously dad
S0481	so so the number of things you see you've get longer to explain what they be
S0439	yeah so
S0481	because
S0439	obviously on a bus
S0481	you've get
S0439	you've get less time yeah
S0481	on a bus you're closer to it
S0439	yeah
S0481	there's a blue plaque here in the right hand side which da di da and that
S0439	and it's go past yeah
S0481	that's it
S0439	yeah
S0481	and so it it's it you cover an awful lot in an hour and twenty minutes
S0439	mm
S0481	but you don't cover it in an awful lot of detail
S0439	detail yeah
S0481	er so the technique of do it be be just entirely different it i i wasn't really aware that you you've get like twenty second to say something about a hundred a hundred things rather than mug up on twenty things that you can really
S0439	yeah
S0481	go into depth about you know but the number of tree we have to keep duck our head for
S0481	oh it be surprise how er how leafy it be come it's like say well i've read the book he say there's either six million tree in or nine million tree in it might just have be the same book but turn up the other way it be he be that sort of you know you wouldn't
S0439	so not
S0481	which
S0439	particularly useful but
S0481	which he
S0439	would be
S0481	which he tell me yes you know and he he be very pleasant it it wasn't the easiest of things to hear but it wasn't like you just would have get use to it after a while
S0439	mm
S0481	and an open top bus be the you know there's always noise and
S0439	yeah of course yeah
S0481	but you've get a good view from the open top bus and the weather be
S0439	yeah the weather be good today
S0481	it be er it be a bite blowy so that be alright
S0439	it be really hot er really hot run this morning they have special not shower but like erm well yeah shower that you could run through so you'd could
S0481	oh right
S0439	be drench in water
S0439	obviously that's what a shower do but yeah and they have lot of erm drink and water station and everything
S0481	oh i they would yeah but the guy on this
S0439	people do collapse
S0481	yeah they people have die on you know this erm this erm stupid london hundred mile cycle they do
S0439	oh yeah
S0481	they people have die the last two years on that
S0439	oh my god
S0481	and whether they're just push or they're push themselves a bite too far i don't know but
S0439	yeah there be load of like sign and stuff be like the weather be hot don't push yourself and stuff like that but erm there's like these ultra marathons you know like in the desert and stuff and you're just like god
S0481	oh i know
S0439	why why would you do that
S0481	i think have shut
S0439	i think it have
S0481	well it obviously hasn't they're all open
S0439	well maybe it's shut maybe it's close down i don't know
S0481	might be
S0439	as our conversation the other day dad i we none of us really know anything about the pubs in so unless you're gonna become a pub connoisseur or whatever the word be

S0481	you know if i be a pub connoisseur
S0439	a pub reviewer
S0481	yeah there be load of people this place the er the people be moan there be no stuff er

S0439	what she be like rude about what you do
S0481	no but she obviously didn't know we didn't have any in depth discussion but obviously her understand of how food work be be be limit
S0439	it's like clone animal meat we be talk cos like what be it two or three years ago they clone meat and say they would would people eat it well they clone the animal and then eat
S0481	yeah
S0439	the meat and people be like oh i wouldn't eat clone meat but they hadn't read the article they weren't eat clone meat they be eat the offspring of a clone animal

S0481	apples be all clone right
S0439	yeah it's so stupid
S0481	they don't just don't understand what they're talk about
S0439	and it's like gm food people be just like yeah but genetically modify stuff be bad i'm like okay so say hypothetically they have a gene they could extract a gene from a human that would stop them from get cancer would you not want them to do it and they're like well yes obviously well that's genetic modification and they're like oh but it's different cos we're humans like what the fuck
S0481	yeah yeah yeah i mean i don't understand why they're concern i never i never understand why they be concern because if you put in a gene to er sorry a protein you're you're you're you're not susceptible to genes it's proteins
S0439	mm
S0481	you're you're you're allergic to if you go and eat a kangaroo burger i suspect there be a protein in there that you haven't actually have before
