S0103	yeah cos i still help out with the air cadets as a civilian instructor
S0018	oh okay
S0103	and i find that eh sometimes it's a little bite easier a little bite difficult to pick up what the youngsters be say because they have a slightly different lingo
S0018	mm
S0103	for instance if they say something's cool i expect it to be a bite cold but in fact that's not what they mean
S0018	and safe safe mean good
S0103	oh do it
S0018	yes
S0103	oh have an australian cousin who come over here and he obviously be irritate by his grandchildren's use of the word cool
S0018	right
S0103	yeah and he always say but it's not cool
S0018	it's positively boil
S0018	and so what you also study german you say
S0103	i do a german discussion group once a week
S0018	okay
S0103	to try to keep up the german that i learn when i be travel to germany on business
S0018	ah
S0103	about thirty years ago thirty or forty years ago
S0018	and do you
S0103	which be really work around the motor industry so vocabulary and the usage i learn be tend to be a bite on the technical side
S0018	mm hm
S0103	although now they say i've get quite a good vocabulary but i've find it rather difficult to string the word together
S0018	well german's quite a complicate language
S0103	well it be because of the different tense
S0018	mm
S0103	but i mean for instance if you say the you could say the man bite the dog or the dog bite the man and it it wouldn't matter which way round you put the word
S0018	eh huh
S0103	because a german would still be able to pick up from the tense whether
S0018	ooh
S0103	it be the dog or the man that do the bite
S0018	of course cos it have all the different
S0103	of course you can't
S0018	case
S0103	you can't have that in english
S0018	mm
S0103	em but eh they say that vocabularies be more important than than grammar
S0018	mm hm
S0103	not for foreigners come over here and they invariably get the grammar wrong but you still understand what they're talk about
S0018	yeah the most important thing be to communicate isn't it i think
S0103	yes it be
S0018	vocabulary will help you do that more than grammar and how about portuguese then
S0103	well portuguese i find very difficult
S0018	mm
S0103	i couldn't well i suppose i'm older now and memory doesn't stick quite so well
S0018	mm
S0103	but i find it extremely difficult and other people have tell me that eh it's not an easy language to learn
S0018	mm
S0103	and so i didn't pursue it i decide that eh
S0018	oh no
S0103	em too many of them can speak english and they seem to sympathise with the problem and so i get on alright and a lot of the people i mix with over there be english people anyway
S0018	mm hm
S0103	so eh i get by
S0018	mm and it's quite similar to spanish portuguese
S0103	so i believe yes
S0018	i remember it be quite difficult at the begin to learn spanish just cos i it's such a wealth different word that don't have any correspondence to english
S0103	but i believe finnish be one of the more difficult ones because i believe there be umpteen different case in finnish far more in than other languages it's quite a quite a complex language i believe
S0018	oh really oof i don't know
S0103	but the the other at the the the extreme end of the scale i suppose you've get eh chinese where
S0018	mm
S0103	inflections em come into play
S0018	yes and all the different character
S0103	yes yes
S0018	they the chinese students that i be work with they say that em they didn't know all eir character of the chinese language that it's very difficult to be completely
S0103	yeah
S0018	knowledgeable about it cos they're so many our alphabet be quite limit compare to to to theirs
S0103	mm mm
S0018	so what else be you enjoy do during your retirement
S0103	em well my main hobby i suppose be em model fly
S0018	mm hm
S0103	i've build some em model aeroplanes radio control model aeroplanes and em i fly those when the weather be good enough eh originally they be all em power by internal combustion engines
S0018	mm hm
S0103	but now electric motor be come into force and with the improve technology em in battery manufacturers there be more powerful electric motor available and they the batteries will give eh a greater capacity for a give weight
S0018	mm hm
S0103	and that's
S0018	how big be they
S0103	what the aeroplanes
S0018	uh huh
S0103	well the the em internal combustion engine sort of something like a five foot wing span
S0018	okay
S0103	em
S0018	gosh it's quite large
S0103	yes
S0018	not bad
S0103	yes
S0018	and where do you
S0103	fortunately i'm break fewer of them now
S0018	yeah
S0103	finger cross
S0018	and do you make do you make them too
S0103	when i first start i buy kit of balsa and plywood
S0018	mm hm
S0103	and build them from kit but now em it's almost cheaper to buy them build up as almost ready to fly or artf em model make in china the chinese seem to be able to build the complete model so much eh cheaper almost cheaper and you can buy the cover materials for a kit so that eh most of the ones i build now i build from kit
S0018	mm hm
S0103	or from make up almost ready to fly kit
S0018	mm
S0103	but you still have to put the tail plane on and the wing and put all the em the electronic the electrical components in it
S0018	mm
S0103	for instance the radio receiver and the servers and operate the fly service
S0018	mm
S0103	and the engine
S0018	sound like fun do you have to paint them too
S0103	no no they they're usually cover eh in a sort of plasticky material
S0018	uh huh
S0103	and eh you should really eh run a warm cover all over them just to tighten the the skin up but em they it's reduce a lot of time in construct them
S0018	a where do you go to fly them
S0103	em i belong to two club one at eh and em one just north of but the one be threaten by high speed rail
S0018	oh what be that
S0103	it's plan to go right across the runway
S0018	ooh
S0103	that's the new london to birmingham high speed rail link
S0018	that's the yes
S0103	and it's plan to go on up to manchester and leeds and scotland in the distant future
S0018	mm hm i've hear of that
S0103	very controversial
S0018	it be
S0103	i doubt whether it's viable really i think it's eh a a a bite of a whim that it could eh be financially viable
S0018	mm
S0103	they build one in holland and i gather that's not eh eh a financial success
S0018	no
S0103	and we could end up with another millstone round our neck
S0018	i believe so and they i think it be high speed it would cut it would cut significantly the time from london to birmingham but it doesn't
S0103	i don't think it do
S0018	it's only about twenty five minutes faster
S0103	there's also some university professor have look at the em eh the effect on the track of a train travel at
S0018	mm
S0103	the sort of speed that they're envisage and he's come to the conclusion that at that speed vibrations will be set up in the rail and that it could be highly dangerous
S0018	oh
S0103	so it may well be that em they can't run them as fast as they want to or that they will have to eh strengthen or alter the design of the the the track construction which could put the cost up considerably i don't know
S0018	and be it
S0103	i don't know
S0018	be it definitely go ahead they've get the green light
S0103	i think it's envisage that it will but you never know what opposition group could drum up to delay it or put it off i don't know
S0018	yeah no i saw a lot of eh people who live in a village that's go to be completely raze down
S0103	yeah
S0018	i think it be there be a celebrity some stephen fry type character who live there and be up in arm about it and he be lead the whole demonstration campaign to to debunk the idea that it be actually viable and yeah they they have a lot of different arguments like
S0103	mm yeah
S0018	it's not actually faster it's go to be more costly it's em i can't remember what the other ones oh you're raze down so much of the countryside and of the
S0103	yeah
S0018	villages
S0103	yeah
S0018	the heritage of be it the chilterns
S0103	yes yes
S0018	yeah
S0103	but they're go to tunnel some of it i think
S0018	really
S0103	at great expense
S0018	again again well they build one in spain em eh they just just open up the madrid to valencia high speed train
S0103	oh have they
S0018	and well you i think that's more viable because it's a larger country and it have significantly reduce travel time but it's only because of the price it's only available to em business people and people who've get a lot of money
S0103	well this be what i would have think about the london to birmingham one
S0018	mm
S0103	it would probably be more viable when it get eh when it complete and run right up to scotland
S0018	true
S0103	eh it may then compete with eh with fly
S0018	mm how long will it take to get from london to
S0103	i don't know what the time be from london to scotland i'm not sure but eh i doubt it would come in my time to go up and see
S0018	oh of course she live up there doesn't she
S0103	she's up there yeah
S0018	how be they get on
S0103	oh they're get on alright the the house be eh not really complete i mean the construction's do but all the decorate and tidy up hasn't be do and i think be more concern about eh keep the children in activities
S0018	mm
S0103	rather than spend their time do the decorate but eh but eh they're alright they've get a field at the back of the house where they've allow a farmer to put some sheep
S0018	oh
S0103	and they're expect some lamb at the moment
S0018	oh lovely
S0103	em they've get a barn which eh have run some electric out to so that they can see to look after the sheep in the night
S0018	yeah
S0103	but i don't think any lamb have turn up yet
S0018	ooh
S0103	and eh i gather that they haven't get the lamb well the and the the lamb scan
S0018	mm
S0103	they're not really certain which ones be pregnant and which aren't but i'm go up there on thursday
S0018	mm hm
S0103	while be eh work in ireland
S0018	mm hm
S0103	eh to help her look after the children while she go on a em a a dive coach's course
S0018	oh wow
S0103	at at edinburgh so she's still keen on the dive she use to do it in solihull and then at sheffield university
S0018	mm hm and be she go to become an instructor
S0103	well this be the idea that she at the moment she's do some em teach for the eh educational teach with the local authority
S0018	mm hm
S0103	up there take after her mother and em i think i think that eh she felt she be miss out because she wasn't qualify to teach dive
S0018	oh
S0103	so she's do this dive instructors course
S0018	so what be she teach
S0103	dive
S0018	oh she's
S0103	and swim
S0018	oh okay swim alright
S0103	yeah yeah so she hasn't she's leave behind her eh her em eh control systems engineer
S0018	oh be that what she be do
S0103	originally yes because she go to work for national power
S0018	mm hm
S0103	em and she go through university sponsor by national power
S0018	mm
S0103	and then become a control systems engineer organise the control of the power station the coal fire power station
S0018	mm hm
S0103	and then when she meet alan and he be work at prestwick on the hms gannet search and rescue squadron
S0018	mm
S0103	em she em get a job with a sausage skin manufacture
S0018	mm
S0103	firm and do the process control eh computer work for the eh manufacturer of the sausage skin
S0018	okay so it's all do by computer that kind of
S0103	well the computer control the the process
S0018	but do she be she be be she very hand on or be she more develop the computer system
S0103	well i think she be eh control do the software that control what the machine do
S0018	oh wow so it's program
S0103	cos she i go up there to see her and she show me around the factory and she'd kick a panel off a machine and twist that and that so she obviously know what the various valves and pip do but eh
S0018	ah interest
S0103	and we saw all the em leather go in at one end which be a bite noxious
S0103	it be all mix up and eh mix in and pump through a pipe and come out like a long sausage you know a long tube of leather and a long tube of sausage skin it be all fold up backwards and forward on itself
S0018	uh huh
S0103	ready to go into the em sausage production machine i suppose but
S0018	oh lovely
S0103	she reckon the skin be the best part of the sausages
S0018	what be the sausage skin make out of
S0103	well these particular ones be make of leather
S0018	leather
S0103	yeah yeah
S0018	ah
S0103	animal excuse me animal skin but eh i'm not certain what eh what type but i think some of them come from all sort of em construction i'm not really concern
S0018	they're very they be very thin the leather be very thin
S0103	not particularly no it it be all in a big vat and stir round with paddle
S0018	mm yes i think when you look into how things be make you start find some of it quite unsavoury
S0103	yeah yes
S0018	i saw a photo of eh some some kind of pink mousse come out of a you know like a meat grinder
S0103	yes yeah
S0018	and i think oh what's that click on it and it be eh something from macdonald's and i think
S0103	mince beef be it
S0018	no i think maybe it be em the milkshake that some kind of
S0103	oh yes
S0018	cos it be very it look like candy floss a little bite and i think oh maybe it's the milkshakes maybe it's ice cream i don't know what be it cos it be a lovely pink rise pink hue and it wasn't it be chicken the what go into the chicken nuggets
S0103	oh yeah
S0018	and it's bright pink
S0103	and be some of it mechanically remove meat
S0018	well
S0103	because i think mechanically remove meat go into sausages doesn't it i think
S0018	really i don't know but what this be
S0103	i think they they get the carcass when they cut the joint off it and then they hose it down with a high pressure jet and what that remove be a sort of sludge of meat off the bone
S0018	eh huh
S0103	and i think that's mechanically remove meat and it end up in eh beef burgers and sausages and i'm always a bite suspicious of what
S0018	i be completely well this this meat the chicken it be pink because they just put the whole chickens through the grinder so you've get every single part
S0103	you've get the bone in there too have you
S0018	yeah everything of the chicken be go in the grinder and that's why it come out pink obviously cos it of the blood
S0103	yes
S0018	and then they bleach it to make it white
S0103	oh my no
S0018	and then they add all the cos obviously it taste foul
S0103	yes yes
S0018	no no pun intend
S0018	and so they bleach it and then they add all these preservatives and flavour cos obviously it doesn't taste
S0103	yeah yeah
S0018	like what we know chicken to taste like so it's they might have they might as well just have get a load of polystyrene instead of chicken
S0018	but yes when you find out what how things be make i don't think i'll ever go back to macdonald's after that
S0018	so how many children have get
S0103	she's get two she's get a a em a daughter of nine and a son of eh seven
S0018	ah lovely and do you see them often
S0103	em not an awful a lot because it's a long way to go but eh she's go over to see 's cousin in eh portugal
S0018	mm hm
S0103	em can't go because he'll be work in ireland now he's work for the irish coastguard
S0018	mm hm
S0103	and em so he go over to ireland for a couple of weeks and then come home for about a week
S0018	mm hm
S0103	but he'll be away when she's can take the children so she's go over there on her own with the two children
S0018	aw
S0103	for a week at the end of the month so we'll see them then but i'm go up there on thursday
S0018	mm hm
S0103	because will be away and she's get to do this dive course
S0018	ooh
S0103	so i shall see her we'll see her twice this month
S0018	aw
S0103	but eh other than that eh probably about i suppose we do quite well we see her about three three or four time a year i suppose
S0018	aww that's lovely and so portugal be do you go to the same place where your where val's cousin
S0103	yes because i stay with them
S0018	ah okay
S0103	and they've get a shed and a garden and i they keep my kit in the shed
S0018	aw bless them
S0103	every now and again they recharge the batteries for me to look after them
S0018	and so do they live there permanently
S0103	yes
S0018	ah
S0103	but they've get grandchildren back here and i think that em they would really like to get back but property in portugal isn't exactly move at the moment
S0018	yeah
S0103	so i think it could be some time before they
S0018	mm hm
S0103	sell the house and the longer it take the better because when they come back i've lose my
S0018	oh dear
S0103	i've lose my hanger
S0018	what a shame so why be they why why be they in portugal do they retire over there
S0103	no no em they use to go over for well she she be divorce
S0018	mm hm
S0103	and she use to go over there i think em just for a break and she meet somebody over there or she meet somebody and go over there and then i think he die and then she remarry a chap who be a a brit who be similarly out there
S0018	mm hm
S0103	single and eh so they decide to get marry and eh they've now get a house together out there
S0018	oh lovely
S0103	they've em he do build work and em he's finish off the house which be pretty well completely
S0018	mm hm
S0103	already build and he's put up a em one or two extra things and they have a swim pool put
S0018	oh lovely
S0103	in the yard i think they'd really feel the pinch of their go home because of it it they've get a lovely set up
S0018	yes it's definitely different
S0103	but em
S0018	to britain
S0103	it's certainly nice to know somebody out there where you can go out for it make it eh a relatively an inexpensive holiday if all you've get to do be get a cheap flight to faro and back
S0018	definitely and do you manage to sort out your mobile phone i remember last
S0103	yes i do
S0018	yeah
S0103	yes i
S0018	last summer you be have
S0103	i can even get on the eh vodafone website
S0018	uh huh
S0103	and em load the
S0018	you do speak portuguese
S0103	load the card now
S0018	do you understand all the instructions in portuguese
S0103	no well i've get an idea and
S0018	just guess
S0103	i think i know now what to look for to log on and eh em charge the card with a few more point
S0018	and so the the builder you be talk about be he find do he work in construction
S0103	well he really he have a business over here
S0018	ah okay
S0103	in engineer
S0018	mm hm
S0103	and eh he go out there and look for work to do and eh he get to know an irish builder
S0018	mm hm
S0103	he do work for this irish builder and in the end it turn out to be a bite of an apprenticeship he branch off do things himself and
S0018	oh okay
S0103	if he want to know how to do it he'd go to this other chap and he's learn that way
S0018	oh okay so he's more of a a solitary builder
S0103	em
S0018	because the construction business there i've get a lot of friends in spain that em when they leave school they go into the construction industry because there be so many job
S0103	yeah
S0018	and obviously that be ten years ago when there be a lot of construction
S0103	now there aren't a lot of job now i suppose
S0018	no all the bank have stop fund the constructions and there's no
S0103	well there must be load of empty properties out there
S0018	there be half build properties empty properties
S0103	this be the problem in ireland they've
S0018	really
S0103	build and build and build
S0018	yeah
S0103	house there
S0018	yeah
S0103	and nobody want to buy them
S0018	yeah mm
S0103	but em no i be lucky really cos i go over there for a for a holiday with i be say that i be do this model fly well they say oh we've get a friend that eh
S0018	oh
S0103	fly model aeroplanes
S0018	oh really
S0103	so i'll take you to meet him so i go over and have a chat with
S0018	eh huh
S0103	and em he'd fly full size aeroplanes and eh he's a very knowledgeable sort of chap and when i go again they say oh 's now the em the train officer for the model fly club so em i have a word with him and he say oh he'd give me some lessons and he use to come round to the house and pick me up and take me down to the field and put me on a lead and to em to give me some fly lessons
S0018	fantastic
S0103	eventually he say go on push off on your own but don't break my plane
S0018	do you take your plan over
S0103	no i no i
S0018	or be you fly his
S0103	in in in effect what happen in the end be that the poor chap die
S0018	oh
S0103	and em i come to an arrangement with his widow that i have his trainer and one or two bits and piece and eh i buy some tool out there and other things i need
S0018	mm
S0103	i keep his plane out there
S0018	aw
S0103	em but i do have a mishap with it in land one of the wing hit a post and break
S0018	oops
S0103	so i bring another model out there another trainer and build it but then when i get home i find i've get another wing cos i'd have the exactly the same kit at home that i'd use and i'd get a spare wing so i make it up and i manage to get it on the plane out to portugal em it come in two halve fortunately so i be able to unbolt the two halve and get them pack up and eh i put them on the special special package em counter at birmingham and pick them up pick it up at faro and i manage to get it within my baggage allowance
S0018	brilliant it's not too heavy well i imagine it can't be too heavy can it
S0103	oh no the it's get to be light stuff so i i get this wing out there within my
S0018	mm hm
S0103	weight allowance
S0103	so the plane's still fly and i've get a spare one
S0018	it's a good job you've get the hobby of buy model aeroplanes and not sail boat
S0103	yeah but em he have another customer eh or another student that em be a retire mine engineer
S0018	mm hm
S0103	and em i get i get to know him and then we use to go down there together em and now he's em not so keen on do it anymore and eh
S0018	no
S0103	but eh last well not the last time but the time before last when i go over there they the two fly field that i use be in a terrible state
S0018	mm hm
S0103	and eh i couldn't get any information from the secretary of the portuguese club so em i go into the library at loulé do you know that part at all
S0018	no what where exactly be it
S0103	em eh well they live at estoi which be not far from faro
S0018	eh huh
S0103	and one of the big towns be loulé
S0018	be that north northern portugal
S0103	no no on the em algarve
S0018	southern ah okay
S0103	em i go into the library and i saw a chap at the desk and i think well i'll try him so i say eh oh i say do you speak english and he say yes in extremely good english and he say can i help you so i say well i fly model aeroplanes and he he say you do and then he say i fly model aeroplanes too so he say i say well i i tell him what have happen about the two club and he know them the he put me onto another one not but it's on the coast just not far from faro
S0018	oh
S0103	but i find it and em i've i've be i've fly there a few time
S0018	super
S0103	but it turn out that he em have a a an english father who travel out to portugal and be a get a job out there
S0018	mm hm
S0103	and marry a portuguese woman so he's get a portuguese mother
S0018	mm
S0103	and an english father and he be bilingual and work in the local library
S0018	and he fly model plan
S0103	and i'm still in touch with him i go last time i go back i have a a meet

S0103	no no no we haven't manage to do that but em sorry he's em eh he's he's put me in touch with a few things and he's in touch with some people that or he's a member of em a a club out in portugal that be intend to open out a new model field near estoi and em it's a ministry defence the portuguese ministry of defence area
S0018	mm hm
S0103	they've get the key in but that they be now go to develop it but it seem as things be very slow move
S0018	mm hm
S0103	so i shall continue to whenever i can eh use the the the the field on the marshland near em near faro
S0018	and be the ministry of defence go to rope you in to do some spy work for them with your plan
S0103	i don't think so but eh things be not very good out in portugal at the moment
S0018	mm
S0103	i think economically they've get their problems
S0018	yeah
S0103	and em i think it's slow move out there
S0018	mm
S0103	i don't know whether it's the economic situation that's eh slow it up or what it be
S0018	mm yeah well they
S0103	but em the first field i go to where tim use to give me lessons have two runways mark out at right angle so it didn't matter whether you have a north or a south or an east or a west wind
S0018	mm
S0103	but this field down by faro have a north south runway that eh where you would take off either from the sea direction or from the land direction so if you've get an east west wind em you've get a if it's a too strong a cross wind you've get a problem
S0018	mm
S0103	so i mean last time i go there there be em eh a a cross wind component and the grind be rather soft and it be it be sandy
S0018	mm hm
S0103	and em the wheel dig into the sand and cause quite a bite of a drag
S0018	oops
S0103	and the less i get em sort of diagonally across the runway into the wind i couldn't get up enough speed to to get the thing off the grind but eh
S0018	and do you have you mount cameras onto it
S0103	i haven't but em members of the model club have eh get hold of old mobile phone with with video cameras in them as a lot have these days and they strap them to the plan and they've get some quite interest picture of the area around the field but we're pretty strictly control as to where we can fly
S0018	right and it's always within your visual field and it's
S0103	well it's get to be i mean if you could eh people say well what be the range of the transmitter well the transmitter be not really the limit factor the limit factor be
S0018	how far you can see
S0103	how far you can see
S0018	yeah
S0103	and as you can imagine if you've watch any even real size fly
S0018	mm
S0103	em the attitude of a of a plane can be very disorientate
S0018	mm hm
S0103	and you can really not be too certain whether it's come towards you or go away from you
S0018	mm hm
S0103	em
S0018	you
S0103	and if if if you get it too far away you could easily become disorientate
S0018	mm hm
S0103	em your i mean the first thing be be it be it come towards you or be it go away but you can check that by flick the the the the stick and see whether it roles to the leave or roles to the right em then if it roles the wrong way you know it's go away from you if it's come towards you it's alright
S0018	and your son in law be a pilot isn't he
S0103	he be a search and rescue pilot with the irish coastguard
S0018	and do he enjoy modal aeroplane fly with you or be that like a
S0103	no no he doesn't
S0018	busman's holiday
S0103	no he's not eh but he he he be a royal naval helicopter pilot and apart from his other other experience he have he most a lot of his time be spend with search and rescue at i think he do about six years in all during his service at at prestwick and em then when he leave the royal navy he have to requalify as a civilian pilot and eh he get a two year contract with the irish coastguard em the irish coastguard be upgrade their helicopters and they want other contractors to come in a fly the old ones until the their regular crew be train up to operate the new ones and then em they would take over again but they've get four search and rescue base in ireland and eh they're go to retrain the crew one after the other so he should be work four base one one after the other and then they've say they'll pay for him to be train up to operate the new helicopter and the he
S0018	do he just pilot helicopters or plan as well
S0103	yes oh yes yeah and the irish say that excuse me if you're you can only be qualify to fly on fly one type of helicopter at a time whereas when he leave the navy he he be em he get qualifications and he be pass to fly about three different type of helicopter he have to get the qualifications and then go to the civil aviation authority at gatwick and get them to mark up his paper to say he be qualify for each type i think it be the the the em the twin i think it be the em the single squirrel and the em em griffin which be a bell helicopter and then there be the sea king and em one other i'm not certain what that be
S0018	and what will happen after two years
S0103	well he'll look for another job but he be hop that he'd be able to em get a job with the eh search and rescue back here or in scotland when the government civilianised it because there's be talk for some time em about em civilianising the search and rescue operation of the raf the royal navy and the coastguard you've get all those people three people operate it at the moment
S0018	be it at the moment it's military
S0103	em well it it the r the raf and the royal navy be military and then you've get eh the coastguard operate over here as well em but it all fell through there be some hitch and em so that didn't come off but he get the job with the irish coastguard and the irish coastguard operators i think be also operate the be the coastguard in eh coastguard service over here but i think some contract have be lose i'm not really certain actually what's happen but anyway hopefully he'll be able to pick up a em fly job back in scotland
S0018	mm hm finger cross
S0103	after all the em somewhat hairy flight he do eh in
S0018	really be they
S0103	search and rescue i don't think he would really be very keen on do he sort of bus stop fly that the people fly out to the oil rig would be do because he have to make some quite difficult decisions in difficult weather condition and eh you know with range and fuel and what you can do in different weather condition and balance eh eh the or take advice on how seriously ill somebody be and whether he would eh kill them take a short route or let them survive by take a take a long round trip
S0018	oh dear yeah one of mum's friend's daughters be work in portland bell
S0103	yeah
S0018	she be coordinate the the search and rescue
S0103	oh be she oh
S0018	but unfortunately they're go to close down that one
S0103	be they
S0018	yeah but she she have some stories she she be on the phone well on the cb or whatever it be to em a small child who say look my father have get his hand stick in some of machinery in the boat
S0103	oh god
S0018	i don't know what to do can you help me and she be talk the kid through the whole scenario but in the end his father die
S0103	oh
S0018	and she say she be absolutely you know really traumatise by it
S0103	well i know he have one case where he have to collect em i think it be a premature baby from somewhere up in inverness way and take them to hospital in glasgow and the weather be pretty awful and they say well you're go a long way round so he say well do you want to get there alive i think he fly down the caledonian canal and round the west coast and then up the cylde he have to go under the erskine bridge and then climb up and go over some power cable and i i you know i it it it's that sort of hairy fly and eh that make it interest and eh i don't think that fly an airliner or em a helicopter out to oil rig and back would be it it would that would be a bite too routine for him i think
S0018	he want the excitement
S0103	so it's not just sea rescue then it's also land emergencies
S0018	no they have to do the em the eh highlands of scotland as well well they go there's another eh search and rescue at lossiemouth so they would go part of the way and lossiemouth would come down and there's there's a em an organisation em there be the the the air the air sea rescue central control i think be at kinloss and i think kinloss sort out which one be go to do which
S0103	could he not join the coastguard in in view of the fact that it it hasn't be civilianised could he not join the coastguard and continue
S0018	well it's a question of well he could do i he could do but eh it all depend when he's finish his eh session with the the irish whether that organisation will want pilot so you don't know what's go to happen and it'll be another eighteen months i should think before he's look so we'll have to see what happen
S0018	prince william be a search and rescue pilot isn't he
S0103	yes yes he be yes he's down in the
S0018	have they ever meet
S0103	em he doesn't talk about it but i think they have because he be eh before go and do his last trip at to prestwick em he be a fly instructor at the tri service helicopter train base at shawbury and he be on the sixty squadron which be where prince william be i suspect he know him and i suspect that eh but he he it's a close book you know you they don't talk about em
S0018	oh okay be it all secret
S0103	well you know i think there's a yes eh
S0018	be you look forward to the jubilee

S0103	ah right

S0103	seventy one i think
S0018	what month
S0103	october

S0103	oh right
S0018	push forty as well nearly ah i don't think about it i don't mind

S0018	oh wow in what kind of
S0103	product change management
S0018	what kind of products
S0103	well he develop an interest in this when he be in the raf through what he regard as the difficulty be use em nato stock number to control the quality and whereabouts of various bits and piece so he's make a bite of a he make a bite of a study of nato stock number and eh he's be em have this as a bite of a hobby horse but he's get em em a a a deal with bombardier the train manufacturer well they make aeroplanes as well but on the on the rail side for do an exercise for them on control their components
S0018	oh so it's like stock control and
S0103	well it it it it be it's it's stock control but also em if you change your specification you change the part number and if you want to do something with the part number how do you relate the old design to the new design
S0018	interest i don't some of the job that people have i wonder how do they how do they discover that job
S0103	well i think one of the problems be that it isn't a very well document subject
S0018	mm
S0103	and because of that there isn't a lot that he can kind to read up about it so most of his work be be original work
S0018	research and things interest
S0103	but anyway it he he's find it quite stimulate i think
S0018	oh and where's he base
S0103	he live at old sodbury
S0018	where's that
S0103	em north of the m4 somewhere between bristol and bath
S0018	ah okay oh a nice area

S0018	oh lovely
S0103	and valerie and i do the cotswold way walk and the first day we do it we leave bath and walk up towards old sodbury and we get within about seven miles of their house it it be a really long walk probably about fifteen or sixteen miles i should think

S0018	how long do that take you sixteen hours what sixteen miles sorry
S0103	it probably take us about six hours i should think

S0018	how long do it take to drive to bath or wherever they be
S0103	about an hour and a half an hour and three quarter to get down to old sodbury
S0018	could be further
S0103	could be yeah it's not as bad as go to scotland
S0018	yeah how how long will that take

S0018	yeah
S0103	well we reckon to allow seven hours might do it in six it depend how many stop we have

S0103	no i don't think so but we have some interest experience especially with the weather
S0018	ah you can never bank on what the weather's go to do can you
S0103	well the first time we go we didn't get out of the harbour we didn't get off the pontoon because the wind be blow so much
S0018	uh huh
S0103	and the last time we go down there we have say oh come to and back and i say ooh that would be great but em the the forecast wasn't good enough to em risk that sort of journey so we just go to the isle of wight and back but that be a good trip

S0018	true
S0103	which i have do within the last twelve months with the cadets
S0018	and do you do you get the pressure cooker out and make a meal
S0103	oh no no we usually have cold meals em you don't really want to do too much cook i think in a confine space

S0018	yeah
S0103	have he get a pressure cooker on the boat i i haven't see that

S0103	but in the summer we're quite happy with cold meals
S0018	true although he seem to just survive on mar bar mar bar and drambuie it's nice
S0103	so em i think it be what a couple of years ago i join the cadets on a walk from weston super mare to purbeck i don't know whether you know that stretch down there
S0018	no
S0103	they leave weston super mare and past cheddar gorge and wookey hole i join them at wookey hall and hole and eh they work down

S0103	right across to the em dorset coast round by doodle door and along to purbeck and then they camp for the weekend at purbeck
S0018	lovely
S0103	and it's a good walk
S0018	dorset's a beautiful place isn't it
S0103	yes we have two or three nights in each place and then they would bus the cadets to where they be go to start the walk and pick them up at the end it be a bite of good experience bite of map read and eh we we'd try and take them to a few place of interest
S0018	and a lot of walk no
S0103	a lot of walk but eh
S0018	a lot of blister
S0103	no no they all do do very well yes
S0018	i'd like to do the em the saint jam way in the north of spain
S0103	oh be there a saint jam way
S0018	yeah the camino de santiago it's call and it i think it run from i think there's different stretch of it but there's the main one run from em ooh what's that city call be it santander
S0103	yes
S0018	or from near the french border and all across the top
S0103	be that where the santander bank come from
S0018	oh i think they take their name from there yes but it's a beautiful city it's not not such a beautiful bank be it
S0103	no
S0018	but eh yeah it go all the way to santiago which be the de compostella which be on the east coast just above portugal actually so it go all through galicia which be very green and vibrant and beautiful beautiful countryside
S0103	well we i i listen to a program on the radio about andalucia and em
S0018	well you wouldn't want to do any walk there hot
S0103	i say to valerie that i think she'd find it interest from the historical point of view so eh we fly to malaga and hire a car and go round by granada and north what's em cordoba
S0018	uh huh
S0103	have you be round there and then be it antiqua antigua or wherever it be down come back down to down to malaga again
S0018	lovely
S0103	but it's all the old em it's an old muslim country wasn't it and they've get their old mosques and they be convert and you have all the religious problems of the time so em em em the alhambra be very interest interest to look at
S0018	yeah it's beautiful isn't it i love the garden in alhambra we take our we take some sandwich and a bottle of wine and chill the wine in a little fountain
S0103	oh do you
S0018	and sit around the pond have our sandwich but it's beautiful they've get some hotels in the grind of the alhambra as well they look splendid
S0103	yes yes but eh that be a a very interest holiday i think that be
S0018	do you do a lot of research before you go
S0103	yes a fair bite yes
S0018	and which which city do you prefer
S0103	well i suppose we didn't see that much of the individual cities because we go to the em i don't know we go to eh cordoba and have a look round that i think the alhambra be probably eh probably it be the highlight of it
S0018	and do you go and see any flamenco show in granada
S0103	no no no
S0018	no i love that area when you're come down for the alhambra towards the city and there's lot of white little white house on the hill and they've get some fantastic restaurants and flamenco music be play for the tourists while they eat yeah it's a lovely lovely atmosphere yes i miss spain
S0103	i'm sure you do you must miss the warmth
S0018	yeah although today's beautiful
S0103	it be isn't it
S0018	it's a sunny day yeah it's always so much nicer when the sun's out wake you up and be cook sunday lunch
S0103	no she's out in her canoe with the birmingham canoe club
S0018	oh super
S0103	she's em she's go on the river wye today so em but there's some meat in the fridge so we'll have something to eat when she get back
S0018	you're not cook
S0103	i may well do i if she's go out for the day and i can't and the weather's not right for fly and i don't get out i i usually cook the joint for the
S0018	be it not a good fly day today
S0103	it's a bite windy i think but em
S0018	mm it have it's a bite chilly as well
S0103	i i want to get the first cut of the lawn this afternoon so
S0018	keep you busy
S0103	em i've get tomorrow we're go to do a stretch of the heart of england way form mickleton up to barston near stratford on avon and then tuesday i've em earmark for a a a day's modal fly
S0018	and where's you're walk tomorrow
S0103	yes yes we take the car we take a car the two cars leave a car at one end of the walk and then another one at the other end then do the walk and then go back and pick the other car up
S0018	ah ha what a good idea
S0103	well we we do that we we do that on most of the cotswold way and on the offa's dyke walk but em with the offa's dyke walk it be a little bite further away from home and we could we sometimes take one car and park it at the end of the walk and then get a taxi to the begin of the walk and then we would walk back to the car em at that time we have a dog and we be take the dog with us so we have to get the taxi at the begin because the taxi wouldn't have want a filthy wet dog in the car at the end of the walk
S0018	what kind of dog do you have
S0103	well it be a collie cross
S0018	ah i don't remember you have a dog
S0103	don't you it be a black collie cross
S0018	aw and do you usually go and eat in a a country pub after your walk
S0103	well sometimes if we've get time we'll stop and have a a beer in the middle of the day but we usually reckon to come home in the even and eh get something to eat in the even
S0018	oh when i be live in barcelona there's a lot of hill and good walk around there em and you can catch the metro out to the last stop on the line and that's already in collserola which be like the hilly area and but the only reason i'd do the walk be if there be a big lunch in a farmhouse in a restaurant farmhouse somewhere so it's like okay right yeah i can walk for four hours as long as i'm walk towards lunch
S0103	well valerie and i go with some friends for a holiday in the costa brava before we get marry and eh stay at le franc i don't know if you've ever come across that
S0018	yeah uh huh
S0103	and we have a few days in barcelona
S0018	oh
S0103	and em i seem to remember we get a there be a i think there be about eight of us and we get a taxi to a monastery above barcelona and they they produce a a liquor up there and
S0018	be it tibidabu
S0103	i can't remember
S0018	be it quite close to barcelona
S0103	oh yes it wasn't far
S0018	i think they make hazelnut liquor
S0103	do they be that what it be i can't remember
S0018	could be i i don't i can't remember either but yes they keep the they keep the monks busy make alcohol but em have you be back since
S0103	no
S0018	no it's change an awful lot cos it's be an olympic city since then as well hasn't it
S0103	yes and em the em i should think it's probably very much more build up now probably a bite like a concrete jungle
S0018	well i get the impression live there that it be be turn into disneyland
S0103	oh be it yeah
S0018	yeah
S0103	but eh even go to when i'm in portugal i notice the amount of build that's go on there be enormous whether they're sell the place or not i don't know
S0018	i doubt it i wouldn't be surprise if all the build construction work stop em they've get no fund for it and no demand for it once it's finish
S0103	they seem to be keep out of the deep trouble that greece be in but eh
S0018	yeah although only just i think but em they be default on their debt weren't they last year
S0103	i think so mm
S0018	so
S0103	well i didn't realise it but on the euro note there's a letter in front of the serial number which
S0018	that's right
S0103	designate the country that's issue it and i think the advice be avoid the greek ones cos they be change to drachmas
S0018	right yes
S0103	do you know this do you
S0018	yeah no i know that the there be the issue country identify but yeah mum and dad be go to greece in june so
S0103	be they
S0018	yeah they're go to paxos and they be worry little about you know the instability of the country and the currency and if they be end if they be go to end up get strand over there or
S0103	yeah yeah
S0018	okay i'm go to turn this off now
