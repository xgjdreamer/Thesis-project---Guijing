S0262	so now this be it start
S0297	right now you say evaluate just to clarify what be what the evaluate of what my teach my unit run okay alright
S0262	there there be two things that i'm i'm evaluate
S0297	yeah
S0262	your erm job as a unit convener
S0297	okay
S0262	and that's one of the question
S0297	sure
S0262	and then another one of the question be your previous profession if you have one or your previous position before start at
S0297	okay sure
S0262	now actually that be the first question
S0297	right
S0262	can you tell me a little bite about your previous position before start at
S0297	er okay so i'm a bite of a unique university story in that sense that erm i didn't necessarily have a career before i start here obviously quite young and erm so basically what i do be i er i get into an honour program and i start teach erm at tutorial level and then er it shift into phd and then i start get some opportunities er so i guess i've always be sort of academic in nature i teach over at er university in the north campus oh my god two three years i don't know somewhere around that er before i start here erm and i do some lecture here all very you know casual sessional stuff you know how it be so i do all that erm i have a couple of things erm while i be do my degree and even my honour and even er part way through my phd so i work erm as what we basically call a resourcer in the city for a company which be basically recruitment so i be in executive level recruitment erm that be part time and i be probably in that for i can't actually remember how long a a fair while during my degree er or degrees erm yeah so i do that and i be also er my dad be a bite of an entrepreneur and erm without go into a huge amount of detail i sort of manage one of his entrepreneurial venture
S0262	okay so tell me about evaluation in that if be you involve what do you erm you know have second hand experience with people
S0297	the evaluation of what
S0262	of whatever the business be so you know when you be work in recruitment or when you be work in you know your dad's company you know anything
S0297	right recruitment be pretty simple in the sense that do we find people for the specific job and you'd evaluate you know and you'd know yourself if you find a good quality person because these be executive level job we're talk like two hundred thousand dollars minimum that's what we deal in all the way up to about a million erm as a base salary and er so i be actually part of team and we'd all sort of basically pitch in depend er the the structure of it be pretty easy we have sort of one main person and there be like three or four quite quite intelligent part time people actually who be just clearly do other things at the time anyway er the way we would evaluate our effort be er we sort of compete so generally the way recruitment work be you want anywhere between five to ten interview good quality people to put forward to the firm whatever it's about er and ideally within those five or ten you know one or two that's gonna get it now with recruitment then if you get if it's all about that five to ten then it's all about okay how many of those five to ten have you bring forward how many of those that one or two people who be gonna get the job how many have you put forward so it be sort of like that so
S0262	what kind of evaluation techniques be you use
S0297	oh very subjective
S0262	right
S0297	because it's it's it's so subjective right you can't er i mean you could do you the only the way you could do quantitative be like we we've have fifteen job in this quarter and you've provide forty candidates of which one get a job you know you could do it that way but the reality be that very very difficult to quantitatively evaluate that so it be very much just subjective erm and everyone know everyone else's role and and because there's certain areas without go into huge amount of detail very very difficult very very difficult have to be subjective
S0262	okay that's fine that's that's good that's good to know so second question
S0297	mm mm
S0262	what sort of evaluation activities oh no what sort of evaluation activities be you currently involve in as a convener for your for your unit
S0297	what sort of evaluation activities very formal leu let which i actually have down there ready and rock for the unit er and i'm do that across two o one which i'm the convener in as you know and if you don't then it's on the record and hrm one o seven which i'm go with he's obviously do the leus for that but i'm still interest in do let formal let and for all my tutorials i also ask my tutor to be involve in let erm and my understand be i can't force them to do that er but i do request and you know ask them how they're go basically er so that's the formal evaluation side but i always make a note er in tutorials because i find that they're average at best in term of result erm so yeah i always make it i have all the way through like these last five or so years since i've start teach erm very subjective ask them in tutorials very relax and say look i don't mind speak your mind what work about this unit what didn't work about this unit what work about my teach what didn't work about my teach so on and so forth and you need to really do that or i find you need to do that in a tutorial environment because it's much more relax it's a smaller group of people and all you need be be as long as you set a nice relax atmosphere they'll they'll tell you they'll be honest with you
S0262	mm sure and what's the difference between let and l
S0297	oh right
S0262	whatever exactly be the word
S0297	okay so so leus be essentially er formal evaluations of the unit hence u at the end
S0262	right
S0297	alright and let be learn evaluations of teach okay so i'm just gonna show you some very very specific examples because this actually outline it all for me in a very formal way
S0262	okay
S0297	alright learn experience of unit learner experience of teach and they have different question that they ask so the unit one ask very specific things you know what do you i can show you er which one be this this this be an leu alright so that's an leu okay so it ask very very specific question like you know erm how do this unit help you do you do you think it be clear what be require of you within this unit do you think it erm examine what you want it to or what you think it should examine all that sort of stuff
S0262	right
S0297	all to do with the unit
S0262	mm mm
S0297	er you're not familiar with these
S0262	no
S0297	right
S0262	i think you only really get to see these erm if you're a student or a convener i guess or
S0297	yeah right
S0262	i wouldn't really have any reason to
S0297	i don't think i have any let with me unfortunately but let basically just ask similar sort of question except rather than about it be about the unit broadly
S0262	right
S0297	it ask very specific things about the teach so if you're do lecture it would ask er what things about this lecture help you learn what things about this er teacher in your tutorials help you learn what what things do you think the teacher or lecturer could do more of to assist you in learn erm all that sort of stuff those sort of question so they're very very specific around the unit and the actual teach side of things
S0262	yeah okay okay alright so that's the formal part
S0297	that be the formal part yes it's very formal and i just happen to have this here so i show you
S0262	cool thank you erm so with the informal part what's what would you say those activities involve
S0297	the informal part be literally just me at the front and say look i understand that you guy just fill out this formal part and it's completely anonymous and you know that's great but i find as well that and this be literally the spiel i give them i find as well that you know students tend to be much more open and they think that this be record and reflect poorly sometimes on teacher and all that sort of stuff like they kind of miss the mark erm and we're limit as to what we can tell them regard this so at the end of it it all get sign and seal and then they know that this be separate then and i ask them very informally look what do you guy like about and i i cover the unit or i have cover the unit since i start take this two o one
S0262	yeah
S0297	you know what do you like about the unit and they'll say i like this assignment i didn't like this assignment and i'll ask why er what do you what do you find that help some people will flat out say i've have people say look i didn't really like the way you approach this and i be like okay good
S0262	right yeah yeah
S0297	tell me why that be you know erm
S0262	okay so do you have to do an evaluation of your tutor as well or informally kind of monitor
S0297	erm yeah you you kind of informally my understand be and i look i could be wrong here because i'm quite junior and i'm a little bite unclear about this but my understand be that you the only person that have access to that information be the person who give it so if your tutor give and er and let which be a teach form er then it go to let office and they're the only ones who should have access to it okay so only can get 's things
S0262	yeah
S0297	so even if i'm the boss you know quote unquote
S0262	yeah yeah
S0297	then i don't have access to that that be my understand
S0262	right
S0297	okay so in term of formally i can i can say look i think you guy should do this and i do do that but my understand be that i have no right to ask them what be the feedback
S0262	okay okay loud and clear erm in term of evaluation activities for curriculum erm design you know the assignments decide what content should go into your unit
S0297	right
S0262	erm do do you find that you take you know you be do those kind of activities
S0297	okay with regard to the unit overall yeah okay so what sort of evaluations do i do with regard to those
S0262	yeah
S0297	erm pretty simple i do them myself erm i immediately before i do them i look at what's be do previously in the unit and there be some things i like for example with bis two o one there be some things i like before there be some things i didn't like and i shift and change and some things i keep because they'd go on and i'd teach them for age erm and then in term of that er then what generally happen be that the department call really peer assessment erm so i guess then what i do be er who i know you're about to speak to
S0262	mm mm
S0297	he be er my official buddy because i'm quite a junior academic here er so i will actually go to and i'll say what do you think about this do you think this would work and that's what i do at the begin of the semester i'm sure can tell you that as well erm okay so i go to him and sort of say you know what do you think of this blah blah blah and he he will go through for example the unit outline like the bible so to speak of the unit and erm he go through and i and he go ah that'll work that'll work and it's not just him erm because i be junior and i you know i didn't wanna make any mistake in my first semester i be i be anal about it er so i check and rechecked everything myself i get to check and recheck it then i get er who at the time be run basically an ib i'm sorry international business
S0262	yeah
S0297	okay
S0262	yeah
S0297	which be what my subject be in so i be say look what do you think about this and he be ah yeah that's fine erm and then i also like that's not that's not necessarily formal but i do give them the actual document and then with a couple of other academics i just ask er just general conversation i would sort of say things at the time like i've actually shift in that way and they're like oh you need to watch out for this or something which i find quite helpful
S0262	yeah yeah that's good that's good
S0297	yeah
S0262	sort of like a peer evaluation
S0297	very much so
S0262	yeah
S0297	and i i i mean i think i don't know if other academics do that to be honest but i know i certainly be heavily involve in that and probably still be just just to make sure i'm on the right track cos sometimes i like to try new things and i know be certainly a man who like to try new things he's excellent at it er but it's always good to get that second opinion from someone
S0262	absolutely couldn't agree more
S0297	with a little bite more experience
S0262	yeah absolutely that's great thank
S0297	erm and i know that and i also know that its be more than one so i know it's a number of them feel that and so and i ask them you know do you put this in the the form at the end of the semester they say yes i do and i happen to know that some of the academics here have continue on do those particular things even though i've have pretty strong student feedback to say that what they be do didn't work now at the time to be fair i be not full time employ i be i be not in a position to say anything okay erm anyway get back on to me er i think evaluation be learn because i do actually er read them quite carefully i have them somewhere in one of these things er i actually have all my let er from the last god five years every single one and i can actually see ha ha it's funny cos i actually i'm gonna use this one erm
S0262	go on say it
S0297	i can see it be actually a map erm because when i do it initially i didn't think of it this way which be why i put it there i didn't think of it this way initially but five years ago when i get my first let i read them cos it be my first time teach at all this be just a a tutorial level and i read them and i i actually take on the feedback and it it say a few things and it sort of say you know er i be little bite scary i be a little bite blunt with students basically and i be like okay cool that's fair enough i can understand why they're say so i change and then of course the next one come along and those criticisms weren't there anymore but there be some other things as well like you know sometimes you you know go off on a little tangent and stuff like this so i be like okay cool get to take that into account and and so on and so it's be this sort of progressive er like like like a map unfortunately er it's be this progressive thing er and i i can see them quite clearly er in the last five years of just do them again and again and again and i think er my teach have benefit massively out of it because if i still teach the way i do when i initially teach and i never get that feedback i i would continue teach that way and er quite frankly i would not be as good as or that sound a bite egotistical doesn't it but i don't feel like i would be as good at teach as i be today
S0262	fair enough
S0297	so that's why that and i i i be even now i put a lot of weight into that
S0262	yeah great and do you want to make a change your mind about the map or
S0297	ah that be quite embarrass that i use that
S0262	or you can just still run with the map thing
S0297	because i hadn't think about it in term of a long term kid of map i be think of it as a sort of okay we'll put that away erm apologies
S0262	no that's fine i mean that's part of the activity be that you can change your mind when you see the other things
S0297	ah i'm gonna go with this one evaluation as a factory that's the least one
S0262	tell me a little bite about that one
S0297	evaluation as a factory tell to me that it's some sort of production line where you know evaluation go in result come out and my interpretation of that be that's pretty much where it end and that that be in complete contrast to this which be the learn side of things i i don't see it as that at all i see it as very much an ongoing process it be er you could almost say cyclical in its own sort of way erm it it's definitely not a factory where you simply put it in and you get the result out and then you simply change it it's not that simple it's not point a to b it be a series of tiny tiny tiny little step that as you move along er and i just i don't agree with this at all this seem cold and distant and not very personal and and that in this particular field er the evaluation should be nothing like that at all you need to personal interaction you need them to be relax if it's if it's formal and more importantly if the students see it as a production line which by the way some of them do which be a massive issue because the students receive them for every single subject it's always in week twelve and thirteen it's just they know it take ten minutes they're bore they don't wanna be do it they don't think that there be actually a correlation between them put down certain things and a difference in the teachers and i think they think that because some of the teachers they have be terrible or they think they're terrible some of the teachers they have they think be good and i don't think that they they see that the teachers who be bad have be teach here for a long time they know they've be teach here for a long time so they don't really consider the evaluation process to be work and in that sense some of them see it as a factory process i this be this be a terrible thing it it go completely against what it should be but er yeah so i'm go to go with evaluation as a factory
S0262	okay that's very interest could you now just you know whichever way you want you can either start here and move there or go there and go here whichever way you like but just sort of really elaborate on your decisions
S0297	okay so erm er yeah okay so we'll go from leave to right which be easier for me if that's alright
S0262	no that's fine yeah
S0297	so here i've put on the leave hand side for the transcript er evaluation as a court trial evaluation as an argument it's engineer and it's economics the reason i put that on there be because er previous provision i felt like evaluation be very much erm you have to defend yourself as oppose to show off your war and how well you've do you need to defend your action and so on and so forth now that wasn't because of any particular reason and i put and that's why i sort of liken it to an argument a court trial erm in term of the economics and engineer probably engineer it's it's probably one which probably more belong here to be honest erm but evaluation as economics er be purely because that be link with pay for pay for performance erm so we be actually er rat with that and erm yeah so that's just the way that it basically so you know you do well you get pay well basically as simple as that er the middle ones here evaluation as investigative journalism moral enterprise sorry i'm just relate to recruitment here and all of their manage
S0262	yeah yeah yeah that's fine
S0297	that's business er so here we have investigative journalism moral enterprise job interview critique risk reflection game and art form right investigative journalism in the sense that you've get to try and figure ha ha you always wanna know your evaluation before you get in there alright er so in that way you've gotta try and find out you do a little sneak investigative journalism you ask around so on and so forth what's expect and what's not expect how do you go round certain things how do you emphasise certain things a moral enterprise in the sense that how much do you stretch the truth er be really where i'm aim at there it's a big part of evaluation unfortunately and everyone do it like this be well know that you know you do a small thing and you you elaborate it you know good response and kind of boost it up a little bite and of course you you minimise the bad things that you've do in the same sense it's a job interview not necessarily for the job you have now but it's an it's an interview for the job you're gonna get in the future in particularly if you're look at a career so if you're look at you know here at university with regard to it be a job interview so at the end of the year we've get pdrs i don't know if you have that in
S0262	yeah yeah
S0297	oh okay yeah so pdrs and you go in there and have a discussion about all the things you've get do and so and and so forth and like that i'm sure most of us if not all of us probably meet roughly that pdr okay on some level but it's all about okay what's happen in the future with regard to that you know where where be that lead to erm so in that sense it's kind of like a job interview just without just without the job be present right then and there cos it's about impressions a critique i feel like it's pretty obvious in the sense that they do critique you somehow whether it's good or bad as some sort of critique er evaluation as a risk i put it in there because er any evaluation be a risk should i be go through each and every one of these
S0262	yeah that's good that's what you're do be right yeah
S0297	right okay so evaluation as a risk just in the sense of you know if you get a bad or if they focus on one particular thing even though it's not necessarily pertinent to your job erm that that's a risk erm you risk you really need to know and i i'll relate this back to these two areas as well where evaluation as a game and evaluation as an art form be that because at the end of the day someone be decide if you have do a good job a bad job or a neutral job and it's a risk in the sense that if you're very good and you know what's come and you know how to sell yourself and you know how to promote things or you know the person who's do the judgement somehow okay then the risk can go down somewhat if you're not very good and there be definitely people like that who be not very good in these situations then the risk go up and that's an unfortunate consequence of the actual individual as oppose to the process although to be fair you could criticise the process itself because it doesn't tailor to all individuals but anyway erm with regard to a reflection it's a reflection because no matter what you're always think about it and my experience have be before any sort of review performance whatever it be er you're always reflect before it because you get super nervous about what's gonna happen and all that sort of stuff and then you reflect afterwards because they tell you certain stuff and sometimes you think of that wasn't as bad and sometimes you're like well they really seem to focus on one or two things that i didn't think matter at all er and it turn out they they be interest in that stuff erm so in that way it's very much a reflection probably more of a reflection than any of erm the other ones in this particular area so that's the both of them now on the far right hand side which be just for my current profession as an academic right here we have technology map architecture research management statistics learn i'll start with technology the simple reason be we have online er assessment methods er the pdr be online the er units the leus and let be available online it's all do online and that doesn't necessarily mean i think it work but it be available online erm so evaluation be technology and it you know it spit out a nice number and it give you a rat i think i've get them in that folder anyway i will show you but it spit out these graph and diagram that quite frankly mean absolutely erm but anyway that's the technology component and you know the reason it mean sweet fa be because they have these scale but they don't tell you what the scale mean
S0262	right
S0297	right so erm
S0262	that's helpful
S0297	it be it be
S0262	yeah
S0297	so it's a scale of nought
S0262	it's a guess game
S0297	nought to five and you let's say you get four point five but you don't know if everyone else if get four point five you know they they actually do there's a very brief thing of say you know good or meet it and all you that you know it's because scale right nought to five it do that but then what you really need be a reference point
S0262	yeah
S0297	you need to know er because the students have relative i'm refer to leus and let here so back to the unit convene stuff er you need and some sort of reference point as to how everyone else be go you know how how if if if everyone else be get five and you get a four then a four look really good four out of five that's
S0262	yeah
S0297	you know eighty percent
S0262	yeah
S0297	you know you look at it that way but actually you have no reference point so that's an issue
S0262	okay
S0297	erm now you get that reference point purely subjectively by ask around the department
S0262	right
S0297	you ask certain people and you find out that get a four or above be really good for example
S0262	okay
S0297	right
S0262	yeah
S0297	er and that's how i know that get a four be good so i always aim to get a four that's that's my goal er at the very least and i know that get a low three be you know average to need improvement and get below a three be bad but there's no there's no there's no real weight anyway that's the technology side of things that's my little criticism of that evaluation as a map be because erm basically what i be tell you before where i be able to nice and easily map it out all the criticisms that i have in the first bite of teach and i learn a lot from those criticisms and you know sort of its get me to where i be today er with regard to architecture er i basically put that in there because i feel like er you know architecture be design and the design of the actual evaluation process have become be very structure here er in my previous profession both as the manage er side of things and in the recruitment side it be an unstructured er messy thing erm so here evaluation as architecture just in the sense that that it have a a very clear structure with a very clear out line very clear directive so on and so forth excuse me and erm so that's the reason for that evaluation as research purely on the basis that i want to know how i'm do er and it wasn't up to me in previous job er in in any of my previous job to be honest er evaluation be do to me it wasn't do necessarily for me if you understand the distinction
S0262	mm mm
S0297	er so they you know they be adjudicate me in my role but it wasn't necessarily for me to be better it be for them to justify them hire me or continue to employ me so evaluation be very much research in this role erm yeah and i must admit i'm perhaps not great for this because i have yet to actually do a pdr because this be my i have yet to complete a full year so i've yet to really comment on on that side of things in great detail but i imagine that go through loosely in the structure of things i imagine would be roughly the same er evaluation of management should yeah we'll put it should really be there actually but er the reason i put management here on the current professions side be purely because it's er the university be so bureaucratic and every level require you know whatever it require as as various requirements you know so this level require this much and then of course they report to the next person about the next thing so it's just it's just basically them justify certain things again and again and again till it reach the top level and everything's fine er and i have i'm go to say i will never work in such a bureaucratic place er as as a university whether it be this university or another one erm i don't think if i change career all of a sudden and go on to a it's just gonna be nowhere near the extreme level of management bureaucracy that you get to enjoy here at university wonderful wonderful structure that they have in place er statistics purely because of the technology and they spit it out er and the learn i feel like i've already talk about that it be really relate to er the research in the sense that i'm able to do it i actually get things from it or i hope i get things from it cos i'm i'm firmly of the belief that er what i've do so far with regard to my teach unit convene be certainly improve and er well we'll see what happen with the pdr because i haven't go through the actual evaluation stage of that so i can't comment but i imagine that i'm gonna learn a lot from that initial review
S0262	good yeah that's good you've get a good er attitude towards it then that's that's good that's healthy and so these three that er didn't make er make it for you though we do talk about evaluation as a factory erm previously
S0297	yeah yeah
S0262	erm be these three more like those two over there
S0297	yes this one particularly
S0262	where they they they don't resonate with yeah
S0297	doesn't resonate with me at all this one doesn't resonate with me at all i have no idea how evaluation be an experiment
S0262	okay just to clarify then these two here erm in term of the interplay between the professions
S0297	yes yes
S0262	i'm quite interest in er these two in
S0297	right okay
S0262	specifically so can you just elaborate a little bite more about
S0297	sure
S0262	why you choose those two
S0297	er okay so evaluation as a game and evaluation as an art form erm huh there be different it's it's all gonna be very much me i firmly believe that there be very different type of people with regard to career management there be those people who quote unquote play the game er that be they they know those particular areas of their job that be go to give them the most credibility for future promotion er you know i don't want to call them brown nosers or anything but they know those things that please their superiors they know those things that doesn't matter okay they're there play the game because they're try to advance their career nothing wrong with that nothing wrong with that whatsoever that's fine erm you get the other people who understand it's a game but don't know how to play it alright er and so they kind of give up and they do their own thing and you know they're good at some things they're not great at other things but they sort of do it then you have those people who don't believe that it's a game whatsoever maybe this be my cynical perspective come through there erm that don't believe it's a game and so they don't really do anything erm and they go on about it now i believe on some level evaluation be a game because at the end of the day you're try to please one or you know maybe three or four people specifically with regard to the evaluation process so in that way you can absolutely skew the result to shape them so that it make you look better than perhaps what you actually be and in that way it's a game there be some people do you want me to talk about er there be some people who be brilliant at play the game i'm new to the game i would say i'm not good at play the game as of yet give me a few years maybe i'll be better at it but to be honest i'm also one of those people who's not interest in play the game i hate that but you know what at some level i feel like the you know certain point in your career it's almost a necessity now with regard to evaluation as an art form some people be good at play the game and some people be not in that sense i feel it's an art form i can tell you very specific academics who be brilliant at play the game erm they know how to shape and shift things and all that sort of stuff and i know people and it's mainly those people who be aware that it's a game but aren't very good at play it so it's clearly an art form in the sense that you just know those people be go to be very good and other people aren't and i think
S0262	it's kind of like a talent for something
S0297	absolutely it be a talent but it be it's just not as one talent it's a talent er you you know you need to identify those factor that be most important and then you need to enact upon those factor you know how do you impact upon them you need to get to know certain individuals you need to be have some sort of er personal develop some sort of personal relationship with the individuals who be you know judge you or evaluate you so to speak so it's not it's not just one talent it's a series of talents and in that way it's an art form but then i guess you could say anything be a series of talents so
S0262	yeah well that's cool alright so erm i'm just gonna take a photograph of that with my mobile phone
S0297	god help us all
S0262	and then we've get one more ooh we've get no i'll do that right at the end erm future approach activity which metaphor would you select or metaphors would you select to represent an approach that you would like to take in the future to evaluate academic literacy in your unit okay let me say it again
S0297	yeah
S0262	which metaphors
S0297	yeah
S0262	would you select
S0297	yeah
S0262	to represent an approach
S0297	yeah
S0262	your approach
S0297	yeah
S0262	that you would like to take in the future to evaluate academic literacy in your unit
S0297	academic literacy how would i evaluate academic literacy what be the approach that i would most like to use
S0262	yeah
S0297	man i would really like to evaluate academic literacy in my unit i'll tell you that much erm i just get through a whole bunch of mark and my god there's nothing more depress i feel like i've fail as a teacher erm right i feel like it need to be an argument cos i can tell students till i'm blue in the face that they need to do certain things but they don't believe me erm and so in that sense no not all students by any stretch of the imagination but certainly a good portion
S0262	so you'd evaluate their argument
S0297	no no not their argument i would have to argue with them that they need to change certain things to improve
S0262	oh i see okay
S0297	erm and i think that's an unfortunate circumstance they're just so stubborn they've get through high school they've pass high school they've pass their subject and they're like you know well i don't need to change anything do i blah blah blah and so in many ways i think you god you need to argue with them and say well no you've actually do this incorrectly and they will no i haven't and you're like no trust me you have because of these reason and they walk away and they'll argue with you and they'll walk away and doesn't matter what you tell them they're not gonna believe you and in that way sometimes it need to be an argument and i don't i don't want that to be the case but
S0262	mm okay so we'll take that
S0297	it's an unfortunate circumstance
S0262	okay so so this be an approach that you can see yourself take more and more in the future
S0297	er
S0262	due due to the
S0297	i would never take it as an approach out i would only take it as an approach out of necessity
S0262	okay
S0297	if you see my point right
S0262	yeah
S0297	because you know you can tell students to the till you're blue in the face that you know their write need to improve and this be the way they need to improve their write you know they need to stop use certain word like obviously and you know like the colloquial language and erm informal sentence structure and all this sort of stuff and this be not just applicable to academia this will be applicable to their job in the future right
S0262	right
S0297	okay i understand you've get away with this so far but this be what's let you down now this be you know we shift it to this wonderful thing of employability and they don't seem to understand and you need to sort of sometimes argue with them erm that this matter and this be why it matter and this be how it matter and they don't they don't always get that
S0262	okay fair enough
S0297	and that's an incredibly frustrate thing because you have you have genuinely valuable things to tell them
S0262	that's right
S0297	and they don't listen
S0262	yeah absolutely so if you be to take a more ideological approach
S0297	well yeah that's right that's something that might be a necessity
S0262	not but that's a fair point that's you be you know say this be the reality check be that it's more likely to be this but yeah
S0297	sometimes look there there be plenty of students as well and i i just read this wonderful email from a student tell me that you know she love my class and all that sort of stuff incredibly bias i pay her large sum of money
S0262	five dollars
S0297	yeah that's right five dollars erm they're very cheap erm they're students after alright er and i get a i pay her to write me this wonderful email and i be oh that's really nice you know when you get students like that as well very open and
S0262	yeah that's great that make it all worthwhile
S0297	er it do it do unfortunately that's the that's the small percentage erm i'd like to say it's a reflection but they're not gonna reflect you can't force them to reflect you can encourage them to reflect er and the reflection itself be not necessarily in a positive way which be an issue erm
S0262	why be it an issue
S0297	er because they need to reflect in a way with regard to well if we're just talk about academic literacy a lot of them reflect in the way that oh this be good enough and that's their reflection they understand that it could be better
S0262	mm
S0297	but in term of the reflection process they're not link that reflection with future outcomes
S0262	mm mm
S0297	so that i mean it i reflection's great and i think they everyone should reflect on it i i think i tell all my students this i think the best thing you can do cos a lot of students they they you know they write stuff out and then they hand it in and i say how many of you actually read this before you hand it in and you'd be surprise like half of the class put their hand up and i'm like okay how many students in all honesty do not read this i've already give you the mark so it doesn't matter you know be honest with me
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0297	how many of you didn't read this before you hand it in you know you get the other half of the class and you're like you didn't read it
S0262	yeah
S0297	in it's totality before you hand it in my be you crazy
S0262	mm mm
S0297	like they just sort of write it and that's fine and i just i struggle with that i i well i don't struggle with it i believe it wholeheartedly but i struggle with the fact that they've reach this sort of conclusion where that's almost acceptable how can they reflect upon their academic literacy if they're not even will to read their own work at the end of it
S0262	mm true
S0297	erm so ideologically i love that as an idea erm in term of i have to go back to the learn i just have to
S0262	yeah okay
S0297	it's just it's just the the clearest thing for me cos i think that feedback we give students be like a map er feedback we give students if literally like you're at point a and we want you to get to point b and these be all the things you do wrong which be why you're not at point b okay and these be all the things you do right which get you to point a
S0262	mm
S0297	that's essentially what it be i kind of refer to this as a shit sandwich i'm sure you've hear that term before right
S0262	no
S0297	okay compliment criticism compliment
S0262	oh oh right yeah okay
S0297	shit sandwich right
S0262	i always call it a burger it's cool
S0297	right oh shit burger right okay cool yeah yeah er so
S0262	eat it late at night after the fun
S0297	yeah yeah that's right so with regard to evaluation as learn i would ideologically i'd like them to understand that they have something to learn from the things we write on their sheet of paper i spend a lot of time go through their assignments there's none here that i've actually mark which be very disappoint but you can see i i've go to a lot of effort and i again i mean we've you've be involve in meet and some of the academics almost brag about how quickly they go through these assignments and it's like ah you know you spend more than ten minutes on any assignment be you crazy blah blah blah
S0262	three minutes yeah
S0297	yeah and this be like tick tick tick mark bang
S0262	yeah
S0297	and i hate that i cos as a student i read the feedback you know and i i look at it and i do all some of these big key word you know you you can reflect on it and i look at it and i saw it as a map and all that sort of stuff and it be you know a design to get me to the next stage and these academics who just tick and we use to hate it the students there be a there be a group of us er myself and my friends and this be probably where the my biggest advantage lie i believe be because i'm relatively close to be the student most of the academics here be so so distant erm both in a time sense and almost in a physical sense in the sense that they have they've no interest in it so they don't put themselves out over students they have no interest in the students whatsoever but just in the time sense like it's twenty years since they learn and the reality be the context in which they learn be completely different to today
S0262	absolutely
S0297	now it's be since i be in a classroom it have be god six or seven years alright but still it's roughly the same sort of context and a hell of a lot more closer than their the content they're refer to and er myself and my group of friends we all hat the tick absolutely hat it it's like okay it's great i've get my credit
S0262	yeah but what do it mean yeah
S0297	which would be a disappoint mark right and and it's like i i don't i don't know why this be an you've you've write like a paragraph at the end say you've do this well you've do this well but you haven't tell me how i've do it well you haven't tell me anything like this and i i personally hat that and erm so anyway these these academics this be my little thing don't tell anyone else this
S0262	do you want me to press the stop button
S0297	some of these yeah
