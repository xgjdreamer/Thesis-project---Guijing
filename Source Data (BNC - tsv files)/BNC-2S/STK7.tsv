S0488	and yeah and then they give mum the ring and she be like i'll take those
S0487	oh there be some people who be just like death
S0488	oh i'm sure erm in erm there's this writer call augusten burroughs i don't know if you've read run with scissor or any of his book but he's a really good writer he's like amaze
S0487	who
S0488	augusten burroughs
S0487	no
S0488	but his book be about his life but it's not like bore autobiography it's literally like one chapter will be all about like the time he like have sex in a mortuary cos he get this boyfriend who be like work in one
S0487	yeah
S0488	and erm how at first he find it really creepy that this guy like no he be like an erm embalmer and then like the guy like he they like he like give him a blow job like and all like around all the body or something but like it's all true and like when he be like twelve cos he have this crazy hippy mum
S0487	yeah
S0488	she send him to live with his psychologist no with her psychiatrist and the psychiatrist be really weird and crazy and like then he he like groom him and stuff
S0487	really
S0488	and like the name have be change but it's all true and the the because augusten burroughs's thing be that it's like all true he doesn't write about fiction he write things that have have happen in his life but he do change name
S0487	yeah
S0488	erm he get sue the psychiatrist sue him and say like you've ruin my business and like it's none of it's true and you have to like say in the like media this isn't true
S0487	yeah
S0488	erm but augusten burroughs like refuse and just pay him load of money because be like no it's true this be my
S0488	principles and then he like
S0487	oh
S0488	he like be like this be erm this be like a victory for free speech and stuff
S0487	wow
S0488	cos he didn't wanna he didn't wanna like go back and cos that's like his thing be that he
S0487	what like because of money now
S0488	yeah so he pay him like i don't think it be like it be like er fifty thousand dollars that that actually doesn't seem like that much
S0487	yeah
S0488	but like or something like that and but like he just refuse to like accept he just refuse to say it wasn't true but i think
S0487	wow
S0488	the point be that that it be kind of do with the psychiatrist be like he be say even though my name's be change everyone will know it's me
S0487	yeah
S0488	but then it's well now everyone will know it's you
S0487	yeah
S0488	and not just like your family and friends cos he could have just move to a new town
S0487	what so do the psychiatrist like do stuff or be it more just like
S0488	i don't yeah i think it be like
S0487	a
S0488	i don't know obviously if it be that serious like police would be involve but it be like semi serious
S0487	mm
S0488	so all a bite weird
S0487	sound really cool it be so weird it be so it be like you know i be tell you like before when they do that special thing at the british museum er the natural history museum and then like they just make that really crude picture of like her a a dinosaur like have sex with it or something
S0488	oh my god that be like the weirdest thing wasn't that for her
S0487	do you see it and she like really didn't like it
S0488	for her birthday
S0487	and when we get home we be like oh
S0488	be that her birthday or something
S0487	no it be like cos she be ill and it be like her last like they want to like treat her and er like it be really nice amaze to arrange the thing at the science museum but then she say it be like she like love it but then like they'd be like and like the scientist be like cos she'd like arrange she'd like get permission from work cos they send like a really sad email like say our friend's like die and she like love your museum and stuff and then say yeah when i get there
S0488	but also like it's so bad because now in the future if that happen again like
S0487	yeah
S0488	they're gonna be like oh well if it's like last time
S0487	there's so
S0488	but be it a sleepover
S0487	no like basically i come from in like 's ferrari and erm i yeah i miss the like go to the thing but they be in er in like have a pizza and i get there like at the end and it be like so
S0488	oh and everyone
S0487	i mean how
S0487	be like smoke outside

S0488	couldn't yeah
S0487	they be just kind of in joke a bite as well about like their boyfriends and it be like what be you do and then like show me the thing and they be all like isn't it great and me and be like and it be like i it be like yeah you've cos i think before there be no one who like
S0488	do you think her boyfriend would have be like
S0487	i think no i think he would just be like her it be just really cringe and like why what's the point like leave and then we get home and we be like oh
S0488	yeah like cringe
S0487	like so
S0488	do she show her mum or be that do you think it be embarrass
S0487	i think she be really embarrass no i think she do show her mum afterwards it's i mean she be really open about like anything to do with sex
S0488	what and her mum's like you poor thing
S0487	i wasn't there when she show her mum but i remember she be i think she be embarrass that they'd take they'd like make her like
S0488	the effort
S0487	no and they make her like do a photo like hold it up i think she be worry like she didn't want it to be on facebook
S0488	do you stay the night at hers that night
S0487	yeah i do
S0488	be she eat a lot at the end
S0487	er yeah cos she be not at the end but in the summer cos she be have all that hemp so she
S0488	oh yeah
S0487	have the munchies
S0488	mm mm do you think her mum want to her to get treatment
S0487	would have what
S0488	want her to get treatment like it wasn't like the dad push that on her
S0487	no i think like i think the mum at first want but also know that the possibilities of recovery be so low and the the it it definitely would do whether you survive or not be so damage that it's like yes she want her to go for treatment cos there's always hope and as a parent any way of like keep them alive that's like instinct but then i think it be also like she really
S0488	it's
S0487	just respect that be so strong and like
S0488	be really like
S0487	be like amaze she be like i know like i don't want i i saw the like what those teenagers be like with no hair like vegetables i want like if i'm gonna go i wanna be strong and like be myself and i've have so much treatment and i want to be natural and eat natural food and like i don't trust what the doctor be say and i'm completely like she be so she be like there be no doubt
S0488	so do you think her mum be just okay what like you
S0487	yeah
S0488	do you think
S0487	and it's like
S0488	she didn't even argue
S0487	i think for like a few weeks it be like a big thing like obviously i i'm sure her mum like i don't know how she
S0488	but do you think she think about it now or do you think she's not like that
S0487	i think she do but not in a way of like like erm i just don't think it's like i don't think she think like there be any cos with the type of cancer she have the the success rat be so low and it's like be it a success rate if you can't talk for like you can't like talk and like you're such a vegetable that you're still in hospital for years and like
S0488	be it literally like that would it
S0487	from the chemo it's like
S0488	literally like years later you're still a shell
S0487	yeah it's like you're just so weak and like yes some people get over it but also how many of them have be deal with cancer since they be six every year like have you know i and i think also for her parent it's like i don't know it's different when it's like your first time it's like she'd have so many chemo like she'd be through it all and they'd like know that experience and then this wasn't even that wasn't even the worst type of cancer and like i think yeah if it's your first cancer then you're definitely gonna go for the treatment but when you've like be plague with it for like fourteen years
S0488	but i think like her brother that like cos like be talk about and she be like lose a sibling be like the worst thing in the world and she be say like i think it's probably worse
S0487	lose a child
S0488	yeah i don't know if she say that or like lose a parent or lose like a partner she say
S0487	mm
S0488	like your husband or whatever and she's like i still think about all the time it's like but for them
S0487	yeah
S0488	to be like that young be just like
S0487	so that's like really the worst
S0488	and like there's only two of them
S0487	and they be so close
