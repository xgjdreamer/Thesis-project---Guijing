S0115	be that a shop
S0037	yeah it's a it's a really famous jewellery um
S0115	oh right i didn't know i never hear of it myself like
S0037	oh right tiffany's
S0115	i i don't know suppose i don't know much about jewellery really
S0037	yeah it's a really famous jewellery sort of um like jeweller
S0115	be that in new york yeah
S0037	they've get a big shop in new york i don't know if i mean
S0115	cos breakfast at tiffany's set in new york isn't it
S0037	yeah it be yeah there's obviously more to the film than that
S0115	so they don't really they don't really have breakfast at tiffany's in the film
S0037	he's a wet well she have it like when she feel sad so if she's be out like party or whatever but actually she's she's lonely really and so she like would go and get like a coffee and a croissant or a you know something to eat and like just look in tiffany's window and make her feel better
S0115	oh so it's like a sort of romantic drama then isn't it dream of wealth dream of of meet a rich guy but that's wrong because um she end up go with a
S0037	but they go on this date and he he's win like a he's win like a ring like in a cracker or some some sort of biscuity cake thing
S0037	and he get it engrave at tiffany's for her like i can't remember exactly it's a nice film
S0115	could've go somewhere cheaper but yeah see what the sentiment be
S0037	well they go on date where they do things that they haven't do before like that neither of them have do so he take her to the library and show her like his book cos he's write a book some
S0115	oh right yeah he's write a book have he oh right
S0037	well he's a writer but he hasn't be able to write for
S0115	what's his what's his book about
S0037	i can't remember
S0115	yeah
S0037	but uh it be a nice film but it's not your sort of film i don't think
S0115	well it's okay it's okay the film
S0037	it's a bite like that one where's the one where's the what's the one when
S0115	sound alright i'm not really a don't watch a lot of romantic film but
S0037	no i don't really though what about that one where they're on a boat where she's
S0115	they're on a boat uh let's narrow this down
S0037	so it's set she's in the the main character be a missionary
S0115	be it be that the the african queen with
S0037	african queen
S0115	um
S0037	rex harrison
S0115	burt um katherine hepburn and um direct by john huston
S0037	that's right
S0115	and with uh dirk um not dirk bogarde uh the a um the american guy he talk he talk in a very rasp way
S0037	i know but i can't think of his name
S0115	it's uh um humphrey bogart
S0037	humphrey bogart that's right
S0115	and and they be big they're big drinkers john huston and humphrey bogart
S0037	not in the film though
S0115	and they they didn't drink any water when they be film it
S0037	yeah
S0115	and that's and the that keep them off cos like she get like like like dysentery and stuff from drink water
S0037	she get ill yeah
S0115	um but they and they they never they only drink alcohol so they never get um never get poison but uh but she get badly poison uh but um there be a lot of like strop strop she be throw like strop at them and stuff you know
S0037	well suppose she be a diva
S0115	she be a bite a hell of a diva yeah um she she be on that that blacklist actually uh
S0037	what oh the communist place
S0115	uh anti un american uh actors consider to be potentially communist
S0037	that's weird isn't it
S0115	uh they make a blacklist uh orson well be on there a few famous guy really i dunno if bogart might've be on it i'm not sure um but yeah she be consider a dangerous communist threat
S0037	d'you think she be though
S0115	um she be from a wealthy family so
S0037	that doesn't mean anything
S0115	probably unlikely that she would want to take money from wealthy families since she herself be from a wealthy family um
S0037	yeah
S0115	i think they go a little bite over the top with the mccarthyism maybe but of course that be the height of the you know cold war so
S0037	yeah
S0115	obviously america be kind of scar that uh
S0037	well there's a new programme on isn't there call homeland that's about like the american
S0115	homeland department of homeland security of whatever it's call
S0037	yeah look good the trailer look good but i don't know if it will be
S0115	they're they're like the coast guard and the sort of it's it's it's the equivalent of our um home secretary sort of
S0037	but the department of homeland security that's surely that's like the like the um secret service isn't it it's the spy and that
S0115	uh be it similar to our mi5
S0037	yeah i think so yeah
S0115	internal um internal intelligence whatever uh yeah but be it not uh immigration or or
S0037	so be mi6
S0115	not sure
S0037	i don't know we'll have to watch it
S0115	watch scarface yesterday
S0037	homeland security actually it be because that's i remember they stamp my passport when i go to new york
S0115	homeland security
S0037	department of homeland security thing with a big eagle boof say i be allow in
S0115	yeah but that's the that's america's like seal or uh what do they call it
S0037	but they be really like they be scary like at the border eagle that's get like uh arrows it's get the eagle's get like arrows in one
S0037	hand yeah
S0115	talon and uh symbolize power and uh an olive branch
S0037	ah
S0037	in the other talon symbolize
S0037	peace
S0115	the opposite of the arrows yeah um
S0037	mm but it be scary at the border like they be like um
S0115	yeah they're really yeah you say they're really intensive aren't they
S0037	they weren't just like how you do they weren't they be like what be the purpose of you visit like really angry and sort of uh like scary really
S0115	yeah it's all it's really crack up crank up after nine eleven hasn't it but um
S0037	i don't really mind though i think like
S0115	they they might have like
S0037	like they can scan all me baggage and all of me organs or whatever they wanna scan really i don't really mind
S0115	yeah no i i don't really uh
S0037	if they wanna frisk us if they wanna
S0115	i don't mind that either i mean there's there's a lot of debate at about identity card and things like that um
S0037	but i think like even the whole sort of you know people don't like the whole body scan thing it's just your body i mean
S0115	like it's i think it's go to happen like i think it's just inevitable and
S0037	well it's enforce in some place isn't it i mean
S0115	i think it's it's it's just it's a logical sort of progression of um of uh technology and security you know
S0037	i don't care like but i think you would feel i would
S0115	as long as as as long as you've get technology available you're always gonna use it the government's always gonna use it for security
S0037	yeah but i think i would be happy be on a plane know that everyone have their body scan
S0115	yeah i mean me too i'd rather have that
S0037	i haven't get a problem with it
S0115	yeah i'd rather have the scan than the danger of like
S0037	yeah
S0115	terrorism on on the plane and uh this this sort of thing be one of them heat topics isn't it get people really angry
S0037	it be yeah you're right
S0115	bite like uh immigration or uh the the eu uh
S0037	yeah religion oh goodness yeah yeah i just need to go to the loo can i just shall i press pause
S0115	yeah yeah yeah cool
