S0607	damn we just miss that how many miles i be like look and go oh smith river brook portland oh i miss it erm okay
S0644	i can't believe we're see sign for portland
S0607	look at this this be really great this road this be accidentally more tree
S0644	aren't we sort of come back a little bite like where we be though i think we be sort of have to go back to where we be to get back on the motorway
S0607	well it doesn't feel like that do it
S0644	dunno
S0607	it feel a bite like we're on a totally different road i wonder if we're on the right road
S0644	oh smell the tree
S0607	oh it must be because it say portland
S0644	so
S0607	so
S0644	tell me about this potential trip you might be go on in wales
S0607	okay so there be two strand to the dilemma er it's all wonderful i just have to work it out because i can i just say it's a whole topic how
S0644	yeah
S0607	sometimes i organise everything all wrong and it's all a stress and it's
S0644	yeah
S0607	my own fault
S0644	right
S0607	you know when you're like why would i do that like why do i organise to like go and babysit for two toddlers one day after we get back from america you know that kind of thing er
S0644	i don't you don't really do you really do things like that because it's
S0607	yeah in a rush
S0644	i i do think you sort of know
S0607	because of my own fault
S0644	that you will not be up for things like that
S0607	well that's kind of like a dumb example but i do end up in situations
S0644	i know what you're say though
S0607	where i'm like why do i not realise that wouldn't wanna do this
S0644	mm
S0607	erm and now it's my own fault
S0644	yeah
S0607	and i can't not do it
S0644	mm
S0607	erm so there's two strand quite hard to remain in the normal like speech mode
S0644	okay
S0607	erm
S0644	it be hard
S0607	it be hard cos it make everything
S0644	i see what you
S0607	oh
S0644	it do
S0607	by the way this road be so fabulous
S0644	it's good innit
S0607	erm so on the one hand there's three strand actually i know it's gonna get excruciatingly bore
S0644	it's alright
S0607	so the first thing be denmark so wanna go to denmark do the erm volunteer i be gonna go in july or august preferably august erm now the one the best one be now of course book for july and august
S0644	of course
S0607	now i know it's complicate but so there's two things one be desperately wanna go for that one so i'm gonna have to go another month or find a different one that might not be as good people
S0644	right
S0607	and the others problem with that be that i know it's complicate and annoy but not sure i wanna do it in september because what if i do end up decide to go and do that write course in cornwall it start in september and that's one of those things that you don't wanna do to yourself
S0644	be it the master
S0607	yeah which we don't know if i'm gonna do that that's a whole other topic like what will i do about write
S0644	yeah yeah
S0607	whether i'll just write or do a smaller course all that that's the biggest course
S0644	right right
S0607	so if i want to do that i i would wanna be prepare for that because it would start like third week of september and i don't wanna be in denmark then so i think september be out which leave go in may or june to denmark to the people who be still the so the people who be the best people
S0644	uhu
S0607	can you believe that these be the only options leave erm or go to someone else
S0644	mm
S0607	and stick with the month that i want now i do tend to get glue to to an idea and think that nothing else can be right
S0644	yes
S0607	so you know i want those people
S0644	and it could be an exercise in flexibility and adaptability
S0607	yeah if i want to choose someone else i should possibly even though we're away and it's annoy like next time i'm lay in bed with wi fi i should possibly check out the other people because they might also get book up i think my favourite people cos they sound so fabulous erm so maybe it be best with the with the denmark thing because i don't really okay so there's june there's june right
S0644	mm
S0607	that's not too bad
S0644	mm
S0607	but just to explain the logic i kind of want to like fixate on the house sit until like maybe mid july
S0644	mm
S0607	and then in the summer i want to be either by the sea a bite by the sea so either if there's a house in cornwall or even like live at my mum and dad's because it's by the sea and hang out
S0644	uhu mm
S0607	and like go to the beach and stuff
S0644	mm
S0607	or be hang on one nine seven
S0644	er
S0607	oh be it just a junction erm i just want to do the house sit thing until like june julyish and then have the summer like volunteer or beach stuff
S0644	mm
S0607	i didn't really want volunteer to start already at the begin of june but maybe that's too rigid because what i could do be no you see i just feel like it's too cos i be think i be gonna maybe do a month in denmark do two weeks at the caf√© and two weeks on a farm
S0644	right
S0607	erm so
S0644	would that
S0607	it's
S0644	coincide
S0607	well you see if i want to do the if i be still fixate on the people that i want
S0644	mm
S0607	erm then i'd have to try and cos the it look like in june they've get one place leave so i'd have i'd have to like that's when the wales thing come into play so wales be the twentieth till the twenty ninth of june so i'd have to go to denmark either only for three weeks like the first bite of june come back and go straight to wales or set off to denmark in may like the last week of may but then it's get too soon and i know it sound fussy but you know you've be say like how you just know stuff
S0644	mm
S0607	i feel like may be too soon i don't wanna already be go to denmark in may it's just what i don't want i just wanna just want there to be several months stretch off into the distance so potentially house sit or you know be a floater
S0607	erm so just float around and like i'm not i'm try not to say the word bum but you know what i mean
S0644	yeah
S0607	so i just don't wanna go
S0644	dosser
S0607	oh i'm gonna have to go may because there's wales and then so maybe what i should do be maybe er i have talk myself into the answer which be
S0644	yeah
S0607	do the wales thing because i do wanna go to wales and it's june so that and it's near the sea
S0644	yeah
S0607	and then pick another denmark er volunteer for july or august do you think
S0644	or what oh yeah and you can't do september cos it might be they
S0607	mm
S0644	but the september yeah you don't wanna mess them about i be gonna say could book and then if you change your mind about the course do that but er you don't wanna mess them about so yeah i would just do as little as possible really
S0607	and also er sorry it's bore but
S0644	no go on
S0607	also oh man oh man
S0644	oh man
S0607	that be one of those where i wasn't really sure how near i be do you know do you feel near
S0644	erm that's the nearest i've felt to anything on this road cos
S0607	yeah
S0644	it's so huge and like
S0607	yeah and then the other thing be i've get this other disease go on which be like no it's not as strong as a disease but it's where things have be come up for like july or august and i've be go yeah i just can't i mean i just can't commit that far you know i just can't no no no no and it's because i've just get this feel that i wanna be by the sea in july and august because and so for example a house sit might come up in like there's be things come up in like somewhere else
S0644	mm mm
S0607	and i've think no no and it and i think it's partly because of the whole like don't wanna book myself up
S0644	yeah
S0607	because by the summer i might wanna float around
S0644	yes
S0607	do you know what i mean
S0644	now this be what i be say to you
S0607	but
S0644	erm let me just tell you what be your it's the habit you've get of be organise and book and everything's organise and try to fit everything in
S0607	it's actually a thing
S0644	it's a habit and you're it's but habit don't just die you have to work at it so you sort like be in limbo where you attempt to do all this book and arrange and organise but really you know now that that don't work always for you
S0607	oh i want to get down it didn't tell me i go down
S0644	it do
S0607	anyway
S0644	didn't it to forty five erm don't you love these truck
S0607	yeah
S0644	the so yeah i just think at least you're finally pay attention to yourself
S0607	yes
S0644	by say actually i don't really wanna book everything four months five months six months in advance
S0607	yeah
S0644	cos it might not work like that can i just give you an example sorry to have to interject
S0607	no it's brilliant
S0644	i mean then i'll let you get back so i dunno if you remember i use to be a lot more like that as in erm i've just gotta go here and i've just gotta do this and then i'm gonna do this and then i do this and then i go there and then i'm gonna do this
S0644	and i don't do that at all any more or
S0607	oh really
S0644	yeah and it's
S0644	it's really good
S0607	do you mean you don't plan it
S0644	no i mean even in the space of a weekend i'd i'd be talk to somebody and i'd go oh i'll pop in and see you on the way back and then i'd say well i'm just gonna go and see so and so as well on the way back cos i say no reason like i just say i'd i'd do all these things it be silly
S0607	go on dude go on go on and they don't go past when you're try to get them to go past
S0644	they can see what you're try to do surely
S0607	i didn't wanna go over that line either but we do okay anyway yeah
S0644	just just for example erm say not so much last year but the year when i be go out with so and i i'd get involve i use to not help a lot but one i there be time when she need some help and i be try to do what i could erm so i'd say yeah but i'll i'll give you a lift here or i'll do this and i'd be try to see and i'd try and do aunt 's at the weekend and i'd be at work and i'd wanna go and see my mum and i'd wanna go and see my dad and i'd wanna see whoever
S0607	oh man it's so stressful
S0644	and then there be somehow i get involve and there be this this animal sanctuary it's a whole different topic and i get involve in help them out a little bite
S0607	you're help too many people
S0644	it in the end it be
S0607	for you
S0644	there no spare time
S0607	yeah
S0644	at all now i don't do anything
S0607	yeah
S0644	because it slowly drop er
S0607	they can all just go and
S0644	it all just go
S0607	they can all just go and like suffer and struggle alone
S0607	no but it's true like you can't help so many many people
S0644	but it creep up it creep up
S0607	yeah
S0644	but slowly slowly slowly things be drop off and now i've realise i actually don't have anything to do a lot of the time and it's really good but whereas i would have fill it up before with stuff
S0607	but also you be totally obligate then cos you'd like arrange to help people
S0644	well each of the things and they they still be each of the things be things that i could never really not do like my aunt 's shop and help with my aunt i have to do that erm the animal people i felt really bad about that cos if i wasn't do it then who be that's a whole other topic i won't get into it erm of course i want to help her where i could do like cos she couldn't drive the last
S0607	ah
S0644	six months
S0607	okay
S0644	she wasn't allow to drive cos she be she be ill so not that i do a lot by any stretch but i use to occasionally give her a lift and get
S0607	yeah
S0644	get something for her or do whatever erm
S0607	oh so
S0644	and it be constant though
S0607	so good
S0644	it be but i'm not complain obviously i'm just say how if you've get this you're like a magnet right and if you it just attract some more so if you've already get this momentum go on this be the theory of everything if you've already get this momentum go on where you're look for things to do help people out try to help here try to do this try to do this and your thing be organise innit and book and try to fit in as much and
S0607	and research to the nth degree like
S0644	yeah
S0607	any potential like anything check it
S0644	yeah
S0607	you know how i say to you one day oh i've just remember there's no reception on this stretch of the highway and you be like
S0644	well i hear it but i couldn't believe i'd hear it
S0607	oh my goodness be that a hotel no
S0644	it's a museum
S0607	it's a museum
S0644	still pretty good innit
S0607	but be there a be there a hotel that's a
S0644	oh they're
S0607	oh
S0644	all er chalets
S0607	chalets oh by the way
S0644	yeah
S0607	if i buy a chalet i could buy one outright in
S0644	yeah really
S0607	yeah they're really cheap erm in fact
S0644	and then you can rent out
S0607	which this one be like twenty seven thousand it's like but i be think there must be something wrong with get one like
S0644	you've gotta pay grind rent and you've gotta pay
S0607	and it's probably not gonna go up in value like an actual property be it it's not like
S0644	i think they do a little bite
S0607	but the other
S0607	and the other problem be that i then wouldn't be like gradually you know cos if i get a mortgage and get a proper one it's gradually pay itself off isn't it and erm you're get more of the money whereas if you just buy that one outright what be you do with your money then
S0644	yeah
S0607	brook eight miles brook be already here
S0644	see everything's pretty close innit really
S0607	i can't can't believe it i mean i can't believe it
S0607	sorry must be erm so er yeah er organise and like prepare
S0644	do you remember that film
S0607	know everything
S0644	along come polly
S0607	yes oh god please don't talk to me about things like that
S0644	what
S0607	because i'm not like her
S0644	not her no you're more like the
S0607	now i'm now i'm gonna seriously kill you
S0644	you you remember look into everything
S0607	yes but the thing be i'm attract to her character
S0644	well he be as well
S0607	you know i use to think i'm gonna be like her
S0644	yeah
S0607	but okay this be actually a topic how far can you move from your natural so i think there's a natural innate thing go on and then
S0644	yeah
S0607	there's you make it worse so
S0607	i think i think you can teach yourself this be so fabulous to a certain extent
S0607	i think you can
S0644	yeah
S0607	teach yourself
S0644	you completely can
S0607	erm but you i don't think that you can go against your nature inherently so like for example when i be change my career and i read that book do what you be
S0644	mm
S0607	and it's like i'm naturally good at this that and the other
S0644	mm
S0607	i can't suddenly be good at basically what we be do in couldn't do that and that be totally work
S0644	yeah
S0607	against my natural
S0644	yeah yeah yeah
S0607	abilities and i think it be the same with your personality it's just that you can there be there's a scale that you're on
S0644	yeah
S0607	and you can get er the worst end or the better end but i don't think you can become your scale you can't just change your whole nature completely
S0644	yeah
S0607	so i could get to the other end of my scale towards along come polly but i don't think i could end up exactly like her cos i'm not on her i'm not on the same scale as her do you see what i mean
S0644	i do completely see what you mean but can i tell you the theory of everything
S0607	yes
S0644	so
S0607	by the way be it really call the theory of everything
S0644	no
S0607	or be it you that call it that
S0644	that's me that's call it the theory of everything
S0644	which be not really any i could right we'll call it vibrations theory
S0607	yes
S0644	so erm anything any time right so there's the you that's the physical you and then there's the you that's the non physical you that's the
S0607	the weirdo
S0644	no no no the erm well yeah er in religious term the it's a soul your soul
S0607	yeah
S0644	erm and it's very complicate so i won't go into it too much but and then there's the so flat the horizon innit so straight
S0607	yeah
S0644	erm yeah and then there's the physical you like the actual tangible you
S0607	yeah
S0644	but there's also the non physical you right now the non physical you be always perfect and perfectly happy and ecstatic and everything's just tick along nicely and what happen be
S0644	when you have erm something wrong the physical you go oh i don't like that but the non physical you go oh i prefer this and it become this do you see
S0607	no i don't
S0607	you have to explain again
S0644	it's really difficult to explain but basically
S0607	be there be there any be there an example
S0644	er
S0607	welcome to oregon
S0644	we in oregon
S0607	oh my goodness
S0644	that be quick
S0607	it's a shame i couldn't stop and get you to take a picture
S0607	do you see do it say state line
S0644	er
S0607	damn it
S0644	i didn't see a state line
S0607	in my imagination it's
S0644	state line road
S0607	oh man oregon
S0644	state line road
S0607	i'm throw can you throw that california book out the window
S0644	shall i
S0607	i know you won't let me i've get to leave it in the motel
S0644	we honour veterans that's good don't litter that's right
S0607	actually one of the hotels throw desperately try to research earlier and pick one but couldn't cos each one have good and bad things erm
S0644	mm
S0607	one of them a guy have say oh they give me a veteran discount thank for that
S0644	oh
S0607	thirty four miles gold beach okay so we're either go to gold beach
S0644	yeah
S0607	or we're go to port orford gut choice now erm so yeah anyway have you get an example
S0644	erm
S0607	or or just try and explain it again otherwise
S0644	right so there's this imagine you look in the mirror right
S0607	that's bad
S0644	not that mirror this morning
S0644	in the mirror be the real you like the perfect happy you
S0607	that doesn't sound normal to me though
S0607	yeah yeah yeah
S0644	and you have in your er experience of go through life they'll call it contrast right so the contrast choose get you to decide what you do like so there's the something so for example erm frankfurt very erm fast pace hardworking conformist and the experience of that have not make you go yes i'm gonna be hardworking drive conformist work as hard as i possibly can for as many hours as i possibly
S0607	i don't i don't want that
S0644	it's go i don't like this now if you have go straightaway
S0607	that's the busy part of you
S0644	yeah cos you're the one that's have the the experience now so as soon as you've go i don't like this the non physical you go what i do like be to be more relax i like to be more
S0607	ah yeah yeah
S0644	erm enjoy everything not feel so under pressure and it become that straightaway now if you decide to to do that as well then you you can do that
S0607	yeah
S0644	but erm what often happen what we often do be instead of just go yeah i'm not gonna do that anymore i'm gonna do this we go concentrate on the i don't like it here it's really it's not me it's horrible here i'm not enjoy myself i'm not enjoy myself it's really awful i don't like it what be i gonna do and then it's just gonna get worse and it's just gonna get worse and it's just gonna get worse
S0607	yeah
S0644	now this sound very simple doesn't it and
S0607	and that which which you be that do that
S0644	that's the physical you erm but occasionally and depend on what type of thoughts you what type of person or think pattern you're use to have some people just go bollocks don't like this i'm off
S0607	yeah
S0644	and and they'll not worry about it but then a different person not use you as an example but another type of person might go well i've get this fantastic job and i really ought to stay because that's what everyone else tell me i should do and everyone say that you've gotta the more money you're earn the better off you be and the the harder you're work the more money you're gonna earn and then it's it's just the way life be it's just how it be but another person might go well no er i'm gonna do what i like i can do whatever i want to it's my life and i can i can change it if i want to
S0607	yeah
S0644	so basically that's the spectrum
S0607	yeah
S0644	that you're talk about and there's the you and if you're a negative person then that person be always gonna veer upon the negative it's it's so interest and it's so hugely massive i can't tell you all the examples in one go anyway if it's launch into a monologue so we're now gonna go back to your thing but i i get it what you're say about the whole
S0607	what be my thing
S0644	spectrum of of i can be a bite like this or i can be less like this
S0607	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0644	but the the moral of the story of that be if you don't like something you can completely change it
S0607	yeah
S0644	and the thing that say you can't that's your personality it's wrong it's not your personality if it make you not happy
S0607	but do you think that it it's actually possible for me to become an along come polly
S0644	yes it's neurological linguistic program be the technical term you really could if you have like a few weeks with she could change your think
S0607	i think it might take longer than two weeks
S0607	but i do think that i can you know i keep read that as you think which i get because of you because you have a book that tell you what book to get and erm it all make total sense and then i don't do it i'm like
S0644	yeah
S0607	right i'm gonna do it i'm gonna think differently why why on earth would i not be
S0644	yeah yeah and then it go back to normal that's cos it's a habit habit be not difficult they're not easy things to change that's why they're call habit innit they're you have to work at it but eventually it do become
S0607	maybe this house sit thing will be good because you're i'm force to like be on my own and and work stuff out erm
S0644	i think it's completely what you need it's the opposite of erm what you've be do
S0607	yeah
S0644	innit so it's it be what you need
S0607	because erm for example when i be at that erm and i be tell you how i like be walk along the beach
S0644	mm
S0607	and fell over that thing and twist my hip and i be like that's it the whole trip be ruin
S0607	oh i'm glad there be people in front of us cos otherwise i'd be like i
S0644	go straight through the thing
S0607	this happen to me on my drive test by the way where i have to like mount the pavement and all sort of weird stuff and i keep
S0644	do you pass
S0607	and he be like it's okay it's it's an unfortunate like weird situation and i do pass yeah i pass first time
S0644	first
S0607	we nearly first time
S0644	brilliant
S0607	yeah we do that i think not that i'm blow my own trumpet or
S0644	that be brilliant
S0607	erm
S0644	i'm only take seven
S0607	i most people take about three
S0644	yeah three's average i think that's really good
S0607	erm but so when i be there so it be like trip over this thing twist the hip a bite
S0644	yeah
S0607	oh my god america's ruin and then i go okay look do you remember me tell you i have to say it out loud i be like
S0644	yeah
S0607	dude seriously you know i'm i be gonna stop this and i be like this be my the first day of my new life but it's almost like i have to be on my own to like do it i don't know how to explain it it's weird it's like if somebody's there they can help me and if there's
S0644	yeah the
S0607	nobody there i have to help me
S0644	oh yeah well cos
S0607	do you know what i mean
S0644	the sometimes with your if you're around people that be use to you be like you then
S0607	yeah
S0644	it bring that out in you like not be funny if if your mum and dad for example like cos they know what you're like for worry they'll do their best to like try and chill you out but that's actually inadvertently i'm not obviously do their best but that's perpetuate the old behaviour like of we must we must try and calm down like that
S0607	i think i need to do what be do in the book by not go on the pacific crest trail but i've start to think about do something similar that's really for me that's too extreme like i'm i'm not
S0644	you probably could do it though
S0607	erm
S0644	couldn't you
S0607	no the it's really bad you have like you have like three days' walk until the next walk source and stuff like that it's just too extreme really
S0644	yeah but i think in that context you you'll have to do it you'd have to do it and then once you've have to do it you know you can
S0607	yeah but maybe you don't want to
S0644	grill and chill
S0607	but listen dude what about a similar thing that's not as stop try to make me do the thing
S0644	just do it
S0607	now look
S0644	see
S0607	what about a similar thing
S0607	that be erm not as extreme for example
S0644	wales
S0607	walk across england no
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm if i do it in summer i could even try the camp thing
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm or some kind of crazy scotland trail
S0644	yeah
S0607	er because when i once have three months off work
S0644	mm
S0607	afterwards i be really annoy cos i think damn i want to walk across england and i didn't
S0644	why didn't you do it again
S0607	i never think of it
S0644	oh
S0607	i forget that i want to do that
S0644	do you ever watch coast at home
S0607	no i haven't erm really see anything yet
S0644	never
S0607	since i've be back
S0644	no this be an old programme it's years old
S0607	oh
S0644	coast it's this really brilliant chap who just walk around the whole of england and then ireland and then wales the coast just do the coast and he he tell you the history and the oh it's just fantastic
S0607	i do just read a book by the guardian guy who do my write course and he it be about him cycle the coast of of great britain that be cool erm but erm what be the point the point be
S0644	so you might do that
S0607	that's sort of
S0644	you could do that
S0607	like a bite more on my scale it's still pretty adventurous if all i'm do be walk i could cycle gonna have to decide erm
S0644	could drive and have a camp have a tent and then pitch up in place couldn't you
S0607	mm i could
S0644	and i'd rather walk
S0607	well i suppose you could do a bite of both you could like drive to somewhere where there's a walk
S0644	mm
S0607	but i'd have to like choose one but then i get fussy so i could choose where i wanna walk from and to and it doesn't have to be something anybody else have do
S0644	mm
S0607	but of course there all these ones ah kfc erm i've have quite a lot of chicken now though
S0607	there be all these ones that everyone else do like erm the across england one be it like the pennine no there's one where they go from coast to coast
S0644	mm
S0607	that's like a well tread path and that kind of get on my nerve already though i bet it's wonderful
S0644	mm
S0607	it's like yeah erm so i don't think i should think about ones that other people have do also because to me coast to coast be sort of wrong cos i'd rather be on the coast all the time
S0644	yeah
S0607	than like okay i have to walk for like eight hundred days
S0644	to the next bite of coast
S0607	to get the other coast so i could try and like erm work out my own one i'd have to decide do i really wanna do camp erm or do i wanna do like do i wanna do walk or do i wanna do cycle maybe drive like you say and then like do walk at different place
S0644	you now you now you can do rent cars and drop them
S0607	yeah the thing be with drive be i've get my freedom more like i can just go do you know what i'm go off to the other side of the country today
S0644	yeah
S0607	i could just do a sort of like set off from not not decide where i'm go
S0644	yeah
S0607	and then just text you and go i'm in shetland island
S0644	mm
S0607	i dunno what do you think do you have a there's weird ask you what you think cos it's not you do it but
S0644	well i will i will for things like that that's gotta be fun innit it's get it's it's if you need to do things like that now
S0607	yeah
S0644	what i mean be i mean this trip what we're do if you hadn't say let's do this and what a good idea it be and all the rest of it i would never have get around to it never ever because isn't that
S0607	oh
S0644	i'm glad you do make me that's some avenue beautiful
S0607	oh i'm but yeah that's another reason not to book myself up with too many house sit and things and denmark and everything cos what if i decide i wanna walk across england oh that bring us back to wales
S0644	mm
S0607	earlier i felt like i'd decide that i would do wales because it's by the sea in june
S0644	that's the craziest one i've ever see
S0607	harris beach state park maybe we should have pop there erm yeah so like wales i i should i be gonna do it and then do
S0644	how long be wales
S0607	it's like nine days
S0644	oh for nine days i'd do it
S0607	maybe it could be part of the erm walk across england but then it depend doesn't it how my be i literally walk across england be i really do that or be i go in the car
S0644	erm
S0607	oh i dunno now if i really wanna walk across england maybe scotland
S0644	or even just devon to cornwall or something like that or
S0607	yeah cycle
S0644	er
S0607	maybe cycle
S0644	around the lake district i'd do that along the tour of the lake district
S0607	yeah maybe cycling's better you know i've get a bike it's brand new
S0644	cycle
S0607	i could do cycle you'd get you'd get further
S0644	yeah but then haven't you get to
S0607	carry everything on your back
S0644	yeah everything
S0607	now that really will be a lesson in light pack i think i have pack light
S0607	until i saw you at the airport erm well i still think i do really well for a month don't you think someone else might have have a bigger case for a month
S0644	yeah well i dunno
S0607	oh man
S0644	i dunno man
S0607	sometimes people just don't say what you want them to say
S0607	you're like right right right
S0644	thing be
S0607	right
S0644	it doesn't matter
S0607	right and you're like
S0607	i can't can't betray myself dunno
S0607	can't just say yes
S0644	yeah they've definitely definitely
S0607	no er
S0644	it doesn't problem be with a with a case a massive case you've get more stuff but you need to carry it
S0644	but you've get more stuff but you have to
S0607	yeah
S0644	carry it but
S0607	do you know what this be a whole topic on its own when i saw you at the airport i be actually a bite like
S0607	cos i have do so well and then now you you just waltz in and go i pack yesterday and i only bring that
S0607	and i be just like i already don't like you and it's only two minutes into the trip
S0644	erm
S0607	i didn't know
S0644	cheeky
S0607	cos your case it i think it be sneaky you never say by the way my case be a weekend case it be very like sneaky and and sort of like underhanded
S0644	i think it's cos it doesn't interest me pack it it's it doesn't really it's not something i'd think to go into do you know what i mean i'll think oh i'll take what i think i can what i can get away with if i think too much about it it would it would annoy me pack like
S0607	well yeah
S0644	if if i really run out of something i'll have to i'll have to find there's always we're not really go to the proper outback be we like if i have to buy some more knickers i can buy some more knickers
S0607	mm
S0644	and if i have to find somewhere to wash my clothe i'll wash my clothe it would annoy me have to take up too much time think about it
S0607	well i take age think about it but actually i didn't take as long as i make out because it erm what be different for me be that i know i've say this several time and that you think i'm exaggerate but i literally didn't have any casualwear only workwear
S0644	yeah
S0607	so when i come home to england it be like me and mum go to get leggings casual trousers a couple of lumberjack shirt
S0644	oh you've get your jog bots on today i see
S0607	yeah
S0644	they're nice
S0607	get those they be like fifteen pound in m and s
S0644	see brilliant
S0607	everything really cheap in england
S0644	yeah
S0607	er this top be fifteen pound i get i get five of these get four in black and this one
S0644	really
S0607	i actually buy a red one but it be a funny red and we take it back
S0644	okay
S0607	erm but the idea be to just have one of these on every day and then of course cos it be suppose to be freeze i be gonna have like a my lumberjack shirt over the top and if necessary a jumper over that but i don't need any of that erm and so i didn't have any so it wasn't just for this trip it be actually
S0644	yeah have to go and get some clothe
S0607	i'm not gonna be work this year what be i gonna wear
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm so the clothe thing at the begin of the month be the main thing and actually that be fun cos there be still load of time to go and we just gradually
S0644	yeah
S0607	pick up
S0644	bits
S0607	erm literally two cardigans erm tracksuit bottom leggings
S0644	i think it be really good the reason it be so easy for me be cos it be not a go out
S0607	mm
S0644	holiday most days i've be able to have on i've look a real state but it hasn't matter it's jog bottom and leggings and a t shirt and then
S0607	i think it's wonderful do you
S0644	yeah i couldn't have be bother with it
S0607	no
S0644	otherwise
S0607	do you know what you start to get back to like i look at myself in the mirror in that erm car hire place and i think do you know what i like myself it's cos i'd wash my hair though
S0607	as i say if it be like also the hair it would have be different but
S0644	yeah
S0607	i just think i like myself i'm get use to myself
S0644	oh
S0607	oh the other hand i also prefer myself like no i don't
S0644	when you've wash your hair
S0607	no when i've also get my lenses in erm and with i'm slightly different to when i've get my glass on and all that stuff
S0644	oh
S0607	erm but i just this morning i just think i'm not put any makeup on i just maybe it'll be different when we get to the cities and then different again when we get to the san juans but erm oh can we talk about stuff be that definitely on by the way
S0644	i think it's on let me look
S0607	by the way it doesn't you just have to like press the erm you do the but you you press the red button right
S0644	i do i do
S0607	yeah so it's still on just check i just suddenly think what a good one this be and then i think i bet it's not even on not not that you wouldn't be able to put it on but just one of those
S0644	yeah
S0607	typical things isn't it
S0607	erm where nobody's talk about nobody's talk about er
S0607	or erm yeah can we talk about stuff
S0644	stuff as in
S0607	like how you shouldn't oh so basically have you read about this erm woman
S0644	the magic of tidy up
S0607	this this it's call joy
S0644	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0607	so my i when i be in frankfurt i be
S0644	she be on television the other day
S0607	be she the japanese girl
S0644	no joy
S0607	oh no this be a japanese girl whose book be call joy
S0644	oh sorry right
S0607	erm so she so i be in like try to pack my stuff for england and my main thing be i'm not pack i'm chuck away
S0644	mm
S0607	so the the first few months be spend try to chuck stuff away
S0644	mm
S0607	and i actually felt like i chuck away a lot of stuff
S0644	mm
S0607	but i still have a lot of stuff so i say to my friend at work erm i can't i say to her i i try to start on the clothe yesterday and i just couldn't do it like
S0644	mm
S0607	it just wouldn't happen i just keep look at each item and just go i just can't do this today and she say well that's one of the things you do have to be in the right mood and it be true cos
S0644	mm
S0607	the next day i do it and suddenly i have two bin liners full
S0644	mm mm mm mm
S0607	but she say to me she'd read this whole book
S0644	mm
S0607	and it be basically the upshot of have read the whole book be you pick up an item it doesn't have to be clothe
S0644	uhu mm
S0607	but we be do clothe
S0644	feel it
S0607	and then do it bring you any joy
S0644	yeah
S0607	if not chuck it not i when be the last time i wear it
S0644	i use this
S0607	i might use it in the future it's
S0644	yeah
S0607	or blah blah blah do it bring you any joy and it be amaze how it work
S0644	yeah
S0607	because i would pick something up it would actually bring me misery because i know that i'd buy it waste my money on it never wear it every time i look at it
S0644	never gonna
S0607	it make me feel stress out cos i still have to try and make it work
S0644	yeah
S0607	and so i just get really brutal
S0644	brilliant brilliant brilliant
S0607	and i chuck out you won't believe it cos i can't believe i have this much stuff i chuck out like five bin liners of clothe right
S0644	be this in frankfurt or in england
S0607	in frankfurt
S0644	oh good i'm glad you do it before
S0607	and i still have i still have a wardrobe full of winter clothe and a suitcase full of summer clothe
S0644	mm
S0607	and then when i come to actually pack it it turn out that there be there be load of extra items as well
S0644	mm
S0607	which i couldn't fit in so i have to have a last minute mega mega cull of like oh god i'm gonna get rid of that i can't believe it and i and i and i get another three bin liners out so and that's just clothe and i chuck away so much other stuff like all like for example a french and german dictionary giant dictionaries
S0644	yeah
S0607	that i've have since i be eighteen
S0644	yeah
S0607	they're completely out of date and you only use online ones now
S0644	yeah yeah yeah
S0607	so but i keep the italian one cos it bring me joy
S0644	yes
S0607	so it be just anyway so i chuck out all this stuff right think that
S0644	mm
S0607	i be amaze
S0644	mm
S0607	and i still have load of stuff when it come down to it
S0644	yeah but think how much better off you be
S0607	yeah
S0644	than before
S0607	but now i've get this fascination i'm gonna get rid of more stuff so
S0644	yeah
S0607	the only thing be that some of the stuff that i've bring that's in my dad's attic it's for when you have an apartment
S0644	right
S0607	and i think it would be a mistake cos my mum say don't chuck away stuff that you're gonna have to buy again cos that's a waste of money
S0644	yeah
S0607	so like a basket that you're gonna put things in in this fictional apartment or you know er load of cable that do long
S0644	attach to
S0607	yeah
S0644	yeah
S0607	or you know there's all sort of crap like that that
S0644	mm
S0607	that be but i think it's difficult to distinguish between those and the just in case items which will never get use and i try to get rid of load of just in case items
S0644	oh look
S0607	but what do you think cos i'm think i'm gonna reduce my stuff and i've get i've i'm not gonna be work right so i'm gonna go into the attic
S0644	mm
S0607	and i'm gonna start with the stuff that be already in the attic before i arrive
S0644	mm
S0607	and i'm gonna get rid of all and i want to get rid of eighty percent of it because do you know what
S0644	mm
S0607	i don't want load of physical reminders of memories
S0644	you don't need it either
S0607	or sometimes they actually get you down even if they're good memories the actual item it's a bite funny feel and i think the and so anyway i've buy the book it's a bite over the top and it be like nine pound but i just really wanna read it cos i just really want i go into the attic and look at an item and i think i need help from that woman
S0644	in the theory of everything that's one of the methods that you can use for get happy
S0607	get rid of stuff
S0644	yeah well tidy
S0607	yeah
S0644	and get which include obviously get rid of stuff put things where they're suppose to be not hold onto things
S0607	yeah
S0644	give things away
S0607	yeah
S0644	erm yeah
S0607	she also tell you how to fold things and stuff like that go down to
S0644	yeah
S0607	that sort of level

S0607	yeah
S0644	and fold them over
S0607	yeah
S0644	so that you know you've get a pair but they're not iron and they've not be and there be a definitely definitely a difference between pick out a pair of them to wear in the day and pick out a nice pair of iron

S0644	er what electrically you mean electricity
S0607	no like do you fold them over each other

S0644	yeah
S0607	tidy book it's not about tidy it's about joy and and erm i love all that stuff so but even though i love all that stuff i be able to really have a good laugh at his book cos i do think it be er he it be funny
S0644	it's the sort of thing as much as you might like it yourself you can see how other people would take the piss
S0607	other people be like oh my god i love this woman right because this be another thing why can't me and you think of something so she she's be a tidy freak since she be fourteen there be one day when she be fourteen when she be tidy up and she nearly collapse under the whole pressure of it like how badly she want it all to be perfect
S0644	really
S0607	and it be like a sort of like epiphany moment
S0644	yeah
S0607	she's be really she's be i be gonna say really bad but no she's be like that for a long time so this lead to her teach other people how to do it
S0644	mm
S0607	which lead to the book and now she's an international phenomenon and i'm like
S0644	yeah
S0607	for cry out loud why can't i wanna be like and then you don't have to work again anyway i just i just can't wait to read the book when i get back and i get rid of all that stuff because i want to be light i want to be light
S0644	yeah
S0607	and if i'm gonna be house sit
S0644	mm
S0607	i wanna just have
S0644	pick your bag of stuff
S0607	one suitcase of things and that's all i need
S0644	and and also know where everything be i mean the best thing ever like they get to a point when i be live in all different place i've probably say this to you a thousand time i've say it to everybody a thousand time but the lose of the key and phone and the erm purse and phone and misplace stuff all the time and it's cos i live in all these different place and i have box of stuff here bag of stuff there and when i move everything into oh wow look at that
S0607	i think it's actually get better
S0644	it be get better
S0607	it's get a bite it's get different but in in my feel but even better like i'm feel even more calm yeah so anyway your key and stuff
S0644	so it take a a while but eventually i get everything from my mum's my dad's or anywhere other place that i'd leave stuff and everything i now own more or less be in that four wall space and i know where everything be and i've get rid of so much stuff in the last in the few years since i've be there cos there ain't a lot of space there really
S0607	mm
S0644	i've have a a cull of book which be also like you've gotta be careful of book cos as much as they're things that you think you're gonna always use or refer back to or you wanna keep sometimes they can just take up too much space and they're no longer reflective of what you wanna
S0607	mm
S0644	look at or read about have a cull of book clothe it's just wonderful like every you have to do it all the time constantly
S0607	yeah yeah
S0644	my sister say actually when my nan die and we have to clear out my nan's house she say it really teach her to constantly be on top of it she say because otherwise that's what happen
S0607	yes and that's what i wanna do i don't want to like you know have to do a massive cull every so often
S0644	every three years yeah
S0607	i want to keep do it so you know how i give you back that keyring
S0644	yes
S0607	i think i don't want that keyring and then if i if when i get home i don't throw it away straight away that and load of other items be just gonna fester in a drawer
S0644	yeah it's the sort of thing you just keep out of habit you think oh i get that in in san francisco i'll keep that why
S0607	you know with a keyring
S0644	mm
S0607	i actually think so i have a keyring as a just in case item
S0644	yeah
S0607	and i think it's so inexpensive i'd rather just run out of keyrings
S0644	yeah
S0607	and then have to get one
S0644	yeah
S0607	and
S0644	when you're inspire to get one

S0644	mm just beautiful
S0607	yeah i have two compact mirror in reserve and do they get on my nerve they be in the in reserve box and it felt like a waste
S0644	do you know what it be though you get use to just see things you get use to just look keep things and in the end you've get this stuff and it's just there and you you'd get use to look at it and don't even think about get rid of it
S0607	yeah
S0644	until i you do that with clothe i do it with clothe all the time clothe do have sentimental value
S0607	yeah
S0644	sometimes but eventually you have to get rid of them as well
S0607	erm i've saw this guy on the house sit website not suppose to be use it to troll for guy and of course i'm not troll for guy
S0607	cos i don't i'm not interest in guy

S0607	do you know what i mean other thing be be it long enough to spend the petrol to go to wales for nine days
S0644	you could erm get a train if you book it in advance really cheap or a national express
S0607	well
S0644	don't you love the national express
S0607	i do but it's one of those things where half of the thing of go would be i would stop and see people on the way in on the way back

S0644	but it can't cost that much how much can it cost
S0607	well actually my dad say that i could get all the way up to the one that i'm do in april he reckon i could get all the way up there and still have some leave over in the tank
S0644	mm
S0607	or do he say and the way back no all the way up there
S0644	mm
S0607	cos that's the thing the helmsley which be in the north i'm do two weeks
S0644	mm coast
S0607	and i'll need two tank of petrol but i'm actually go to birmingham before then so that will be on the way so i'll probably only use two tank of petrol for three weeks of house sit
