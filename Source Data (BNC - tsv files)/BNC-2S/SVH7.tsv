S0058	mm that's better
S0179	what's better
S0058	some food
S0179	oh good
S0058	i bet you anything my dad'll have that sandwich when we get there
S0179	sorry
S0058	i bet you anything my dad'll have that sandwich when we get there
S0179	why would he have that sandwich
S0058	well as in i assume we're not gonna use it
S0179	eat it tomorrow as a snack
S0058	okay fair enough if we want it he won't eat it
S0179	why would he eat it
S0058	i really imagine him be like oo he's get something for well travel sandwich
S0179	why
S0058	i don't know when we use to do dance show you know he obviously use to take he have to take food for the whole day so load of sandwich basically and um
S0179	the whole day
S0058	yeah um so when when i use to do show we use to um you go in the morning on the day of the show and you rehearse all day and then do the show on the night um it be actually quite good preparation for a sort of professional thing um far more so than just go along on the even you know um
S0179	why
S0058	cos that's more what their days be like but um
S0179	so it's nothing like say in athletics where you don't wanna train before you
S0058	well yeah
S0179	compete
S0058	i'm as i say it i be just think that like it seem like an odd thing to do but she obviously find it work but i mean
S0179	perhaps she presumably get to charge for this
S0058	presumably get to
S0179	charge for the fact you be receive instruction for all the way through the day
S0058	no no
S0179	oh
S0058	um we be well we be er there be kind of the rehearsals up to that point have be so expensive that i think that the day of the show be sort of free um
S0179	expensive how much do dance lessons oh god cost per session
S0058	yeah um i can't remember exactly i think when i leave it be about six pound an hour um which isn't bad
S0179	how many in a class
S0058	it vary from upper upper level class sort of it could be as few as sort of three or four lower level class thirty and so for yeah for the show rehearsals you'd have to pay say for a fiver an hour for three hours a night four or five time a week and there'd be a hundred people there so that's not an insignificant amount of money um and you have to buy all your costume and and stuff so i think it be sort of take as reasonable but like yeah i have to get a day off school every time i do a show
S0179	really
S0058	yeah
S0179	how on you earth be you allow to do that
S0058	i think it be argue to be a sort of enrich experience
S0179	oh i figure it be only go to be a recreational activity
S0058	mm
S0179	you shouldn't be allow time off school
S0058	yeah it's
S0179	like if i'd be a head teacher i wouldn't have allow that
S0058	but i mean sort of er like obviously
S0179	why should you be allow to do that but the
S0058	no i'm not i'm not say
S0179	parent not be allow to take kid on holiday
S0058	i'm not say that be right i mean i mean i guess it be one day rather than
S0179	yeah but it's one day repeatedly over the year
S0058	not that many a year a couple of time a year wasn't like these be every month
S0179	okay so you er miss five days of school in two years versus one one week holiday in two years
S0058	mm you're probably right in all fairness in all fairness parent can take their kid out of school for holiday if they want to
S0179	oo there's an interest legal grey area
S0058	yeah i mean i think if they just keep er
S0179	cos they be legally oblige to provide for a full education or at least access to a full education i think you could be argue that's breach their duty of care the school can't legally stop them
S0058	mm
S0179	but social service probably could
S0058	yeah i think it would be a case of if you're do it and it you know and it's not be it's not enough to be bring to the attention of anyone who have any power to do anything about it then whereas if it be every you know two weeks every term they'd probably say something but you can do it it's just the school doesn't like it do you find at work that there's er that the office be a lot quieter during school holiday mm
S0179	not really
S0058	yeah
S0179	cos most people's kid be still quite young
S0058	yeah it's interest just
S0179	but to be honest sort of four or five people be out of the office in the state or in europe for
S0058	yeah fair enough yeah it's just interest that yeah ours do get noticeably quieter like into er sort of half term and summer holiday and stuff
S0179	it's a very different type of office
S0058	it be and probably a bigger variety of child age
S0179	yes and most of our office be men so my team exclude
S0058	well my your yeah no but i mean
S0179	obviously you have a massive majority of women and we have a massive
S0058	mm
S0179	majority of men
S0058	i'm not sure it would make much difference though like i cos er
S0179	of course it will because
S0058	if you if you wanna go on holiday both of you would go
S0179	yeah but there's holiday for mother
S0058	from from a child care perspective
S0179	yeah exactly
S0058	yeah from a childcare perspective the mother might do it i guess mm the moon's really weird tonight
S0179	sorry
S0058	the moon's really weird it's one of those ones where you can see like the the shape of it but actually you can't see much now but earlier you could see the shape of the the moon but then just the the light bits
S0179	well that's gonna be an m and s lorry there
S0058	huh aw
S0179	oh yeah wow that's low
S0058	what the moon yeah it's funny isn't it
S0179	i think be that a reflection
S0179	no that's actually just the moon
S0058	be you er you can understand all the kind of i like think about like in the past when they didn't know what the sun and the moon be and the star and you know how would you how would you see them what would you say they be i just think it's interest how do you explain the moon get bigger and get smaller again you know eclipse and what be star and these light in the sky like that kind of thing so like in old english um star be sky candle they're very keen on like compound um sort of descriptive thing i can't remember what they're call um so like um a swan road be the sea and yeah like they're er no sorry the sun be a sky candle um i think it's a nice nice image
S0179	surely swan road would be a river not
S0058	yeah
S0179	the sea
S0058	i dunno why they call it a swan road it's get and whale road as well which er make a bite more sense
S0179	hm
S0058	they're quite keen on those things really interest
S0179	what's the old english word for swan
S0058	probably swan i can't remember exactly wouldn't be surprise if it be swan
S0179	mm
S0058	and road's probably rad or rod or roden or something
S0179	hm
S0058	i be think the other thing i need to get while we're at at my parent be my um my dissertation note and stuff like um my hard note
S0179	right
S0058	um quite useful when i as i'm rewrite it
S0179	yeah sure
S0058	i'm er hop to dig them out i'm sure they're quite handy be on top of all the stuff
S0179	or they'll be hide under something yes
S0058	there's a few things to er dig out i'm try to think what er what to watch first on iplayer there hasn't be anything sort of revolutionary on
S0179	if there's a top gear on i'd like to watch some of that
S0058	there's always top gear on to be honest
S0179	yeah but any new top gear
S0058	yeah true yeah there's always some on iplayer but it's not necessarily new might be no er cos like things like sherlock and you know really you wanna watch they're really good but there hasn't be anything at least nothing that i know of that's be that good i've be watch masterchef at work though
S0179	masterchef
S0058	masterchef it's brilliant
S0179	how be it brilliant
S0058	how be it brilliant
S0179	yeah
S0058	i dunno it's just really interest and er kind of engage in a weird way like so it start off er they're the same every week it's really simple like they're er in this sort of big open kitchen thing and they all have a bench and there's some ingredients at the front of the room and they're tell right you've get however many hours pick your ingredients and cook us something and it's just really fascinate to see what they come up with
S0179	you see i like ready steady cook cos it's quick and they don't know what they're gonna have to use
S0058	yeah that be quite fun actually i do like ready steady cook um thingy's annoy though what's his name
S0179	er
S0058	ainsley harriott
S0179	i like him i do like him
S0058	he's always er yeah he's quite fun he's er he's um
S0179	do he ever have holiday
S0058	sorry
S0179	just wonder if he er he ever have a holiday
S0179	actually maybe they film more than one episode a day
S0058	probably yeah they probably do like a block of however many the same audience would watch cos they're quite short you know they're only half an hour program or something aren't they cos they do the twenty minute long one and then a sort of five minute challenge
S0179	what
S0058	so ready steady cook there be er maybe they've have to change the format halfway through or something but um so there'd be like it take it be twenty minutes wasn't it that you get to do the main
S0179	i think it be half an hour
S0058	oh okay maybe it be yeah maybe there be some different ones where they do it twenty minutes and five minutes
S0179	yeah i think the whole length of the programme's forty forty five minutes
S0058	okay fair enough yeah so they could film a few of those in a day most stuff they do like um quiz show and stuff they film a few in a in a go er but the the people just change their clothe
S0179	who change their clothe
S0058	so like the presenter you know so like rob brydon on would i lie to you would just change his clothe
S0179	ah right
S0058	and you and you'd probably see um more there's er probably be more than one episode film with the same audience
S0179	okay
S0058	i think it probably depend on the show but so yeah i imagine
S0179	i be gonna say mock the week they can't do that because it's topical
S0058	yeah so like have i get news for you they couldn't do that um but other stuff like qi they probably film a few in a go
S0179	qi annoy me so much
S0179	how be he thirty
S0058	what the one ahead
S0179	mm
S0058	with cool light
S0179	do you not recognize those light
S0058	i didn't but now you've say it i do
S0179	mm it massively annoy me because stephen fry's smug face
S0179	that man need a beat
S0058	i mean huh it's quite it's it's er it's i be just i be about to say it's quite interest huh um it's alright it's i'm i don't enjoy it quite as much as i use to i think it's get a a bite samey
S0179	yes stephen fry
S0179	be smug as be the programme
S0058	mm yeah i mean it be it be quite a fun format when it start but yeah they're quite a way into it now so actually it's not quite as much fun but yeah so masterchef be now my quality slash rubbish somewhere in the middle tv of choice it's excellent
S0179	do you see the thing about rowan atkinson so you know that er countryfile presenter file a law suit against the bbc for age discrimination
S0058	i be read about this today yeah
S0179	and that rowan atkinson write a letter to some news radio chat
S0058	mm
S0179	show thing say that this be disgust and that it go against artistic freedom
S0058	yeah
S0179	it's like no
S0058	not sure it do
S0179	because there's a difference between an employment contract and er
S0058	yeah
S0179	she's not a performer she be a presenter there be a difference
S0058	yeah
S0179	so she's not an actor she be someone whose job it be to that's a bite like cos er i'm try to think i'm try to think of a comparable example there's not many
S0058	well in all fairness if he be tell no you can't do any more film ever because you're too old he wouldn't like it he'd say that be discrimination
S0179	er
S0058	i think he's just get a bite
S0179	no i i can see his point but then again
S0058	well
S0179	this be someone who's do very well out of the industry
S0058	yeah i mean i can't er i i think he's right in the sense
S0179	but it's not really the same industry it's er it's er as in a camera's point at him it's for a completely different context
S0058	i i think he's worry about comedy be unable to say things that be offensive
S0179	no that's not what he be
S0058	but
S0179	go on about
S0058	well er the article i read be er it be be say that it's it's part part of his campaign about you can't have comedy without the right to offend
S0179	yes but that have to be
S0058	so
S0179	in moderation and that's what it's always be
S0058	yeah i i er yeah
S0179	rowan atkinson be a bite of an interest individual
S0058	yeah er i
S0179	this be a guy who total a mclaren f1 on dry clear roads
S0058	yeah and i the more i know about him the more i'm get the impression that he's a bite of an interest character
S0179	as in he's he's very close friends with jeremy clarkson
S0058	and prince charles
S0179	yes
S0058	interest er dinner party he must have
S0179	well hang on yeah and er er cos jeremy clarkson's very good friends with david cameron
S0058	be he
S0179	yes
S0058	bullingdon
S0179	so
S0058	or be be clarkson oxford or not
S0179	no
S0058	they're they're not bullingdon be they i can just imagine them get together and bray loudly about the plebs actually clarkson's not particularly brayey he's not posh he's just just clarkson but yeah rowan atkinson i be er
S0179	yeah as i say
S0058	a bite odd
S0179	i don't understand how he manage to do er someone who own a mclaren f1 firstly to own it be a bite of an interest judgement the car cost a million quid new
S0058	fff
S0179	it cost about two million now um alright fair enough you're a keen driver but and have the money but i do get the er it's only get one seat
S0058	oh right
S0179	cos er the idea be you sit in the centre it's like a race car
S0058	right hence why it's call the f1 presumably
S0179	yes um the idea be it be as close as possible to drive a road car a race car on the road
S0058	on the road yeah
S0179	and symbol from the nineties and there be a certain amount of well yes but
S0058	hm yeah
S0179	yeah i i do just like before you drive that i'd have a lot of advance drive lessons and i bet he didn't and again it'd be very easy to drive
S0058	mm yeah
S0179	fast on a track it's very different from be able to drive on a public road
S0058	yeah maybe he'd have lot of formula one style race lessons hence figure it be the same
S0179	but no i think he have it for years
S0058	oh okay
S0179	but again total a car like that that's quite an effort in the sense that although it's massively fast it's just get massively good brake and very good steer
S0058	yeah
S0179	traction
S0058	so he'd really have to
S0179	well no you'd have to be drive like a tit
S0058	yeah
S0179	which wouldn't be difficult in a car like that
S0058	yeah yeah more money than sense i guess
S0179	sorry
S0058	more money than sense
S0179	yeah
S0058	as in the people who can afford them really shouldn't be drive
S0179	in a lot of case yeah
S0058	yeah i dunno i just
S0179	cos when you've get that money there's a very there's a certain lack of responsibility
S0058	yeah just buy another one
S0179	well you can't really they don't make them
S0058	well er yeah maybe
S0179	i suspect they'll try and repair it but er
S0058	but it's not it doesn't mean the same maybe and you don't need to worry too much about other people cos money
S0179	yeah indeed um and i think so that's a bite interest but i felt that article be just really interest because it be sort of that's not she wasn't an artist she be a presenter
S0058	mm
S0179	that be her job and you
S0058	yeah
S0179	and and that she be employ in a full time contract and
S0058	well yeah
S0179	in that capacity you be entitle to legal protection against discrimination
S0058	yeah
S0179	and er you
S0058	and it's right that you be
S0179	yeah
S0058	i think be the key point
S0179	and her age didn't compromise her ability to relay information
S0058	mm
S0179	to the public
S0058	yeah i think that's the critical thing
S0179	um it make her and it didn't necessarily make her you know it it's i mean do you select employee er er presenter on account they're attractive to look at um you could argue there's a part of that
S0058	mm
S0179	but then well i think there's a difference again between select someone from a job and get rid of them
S0058	yeah
S0179	from that job
S0058	yeah if you've select them and you can't really go right now you're past your best you just it doesn't really work like that in you know like you say it's er it didn't compromise her
S0179	well
S0058	ability to to have people tune in and watch her and convey the information and you know
S0179	and let's face it who the hell watch countryfile for the totty
S0058	exactly yeah yeah it be a stupid decision anyway whatever way you look at it
S0179	but she do make an interest point there be very few old women in television
S0058	yeah it's true it be true um
S0179	there's lot of er elderly men and i think that be a you know i'm er as a rule i think that for sort of sex discrimination case that be well not that's not a fair comment but as a i'm massively against any sort of positive discrimination
S0058	yeah no no
S0179	but on the other hand i think that's a situation that do perhaps need correct as in an in
S0058	it need correct but not postively discriminate against but you
S0179	no you
S0058	people who be capable and have be in the job a long time shouldn't be sack cos they've over fifty or sixty it's not it's not right
S0179	no this be this be probably because she be over forty in all fairness but
S0058	well er i don't i
S0179	uh
S0058	to be honest i don't know who it be i didn't recognize the name or see her i've never see countryfile there wasn't a picture in the article i read um
S0179	probably why she's too unattractive to
S0179	sell the paper
S0058	yeah too old to look at yeah
S0179	however
S0179	the um
S0058	no i agree with you that it's it er it's it's true there aren't any women over a certain age and it's you know
S0179	whereas there's lot of men over a certain age
S0058	yeah
S0179	um er paxton clarkson er
S0058	yeah
S0179	parkinson er
S0058	exactly yeah
S0179	jonathan ross be push it a bite
S0058	he's probably fifty
S0179	the sooner he start push daisies
S0058	i mean a um
S0179	i do not like that man
S0058	jonathan ross no
S0179	i think he's very clever well no i think he's reasonably intelligent but
S0058	i think he's do good stuff in the past but he's past it
S0179	but that doesn't excuse
S0058	no it doesn't excuse
S0179	the russell brand incident be just on what like russell brand i can believe be stupid enough to have think that be funny
S0058	yeah um but then
S0179	jonathan ross be er
S0058	he do the honourable thing and go yeah that be actually really stupid i'm gonna step down i don't want to be involve with the bbc anymore cos i do the wrong thing
S0179	yeah oddly er yes probably because he realize his hollywood career be just about to set off
S0058	well
S0179	um
S0058	yes
S0179	however
S0058	but yeah jonathan ross you you can't believe he's quite that stupid
S0179	no i er er he would've it with him it would've be calculate
S0058	yeah
S0179	um
S0058	he think it would be funnier that's that's a bad judgement that's not the kind of person i really wanna be watch
S0179	no arguably it be very good judgement it get him a lot of notoriety
S0058	well
S0179	as er jeremy clarkson will tell you there be no such thing as bad publicity
S0058	well quite yeah but i'm not sure i wanna i er i don't have to like him even if it work i don't respect that cleverness
S0179	it's not particularly it's
S0058	no but i
S0179	cunning rather than clever
S0058	i don't er yeah i don't respect that cunning if it be cunning whatever it be i just
S0179	but i think tim minchin's attitude be just perfect
S0058	he's brilliant have you ever see
S0179	bend over and rap with your own fist
S0058	ah pretty much everything he do be genius
S0179	yes
S0058	the interview with him be really bore though the the jonathan ross interview
S0179	why
S0058	well cos cos er he's just not because i think tim minchin be be quite a kind of
S0179	reasonable normal guy
S0058	a reasonable sensible normal quiet reserve quite private family man actually in real life
S0179	despite the feet the make up the er
S0058	yeah but that's er that's very much a like a persona and he do appear without all of that
S0179	yeah
S0058	but when he's perform as tim minchin the comedian he do it all which be fine er you know it's great but yeah er er i think
S0179	so why do we lose the second lane jesus wow
S0058	seriously one lane oh my goodness
S0179	well it's light traffic and it's a fifty anyway so it's not gonna make too much difference to progress it's just er
S0058	no no but it's just impressive
S0179	for fuck's sake
S0179	get on and widen it already
S0179	be like this for at least five years
S0058	nice
S0179	how it doesn't take that long to build a road
S0058	hm
S0179	or at least do it in stag
S0058	yeah
S0179	do a like ten miles of it rather than try to do fifty miles
S0179	thirty whatever it be i think it's about twenty five actually
S0058	hm
S0179	leave that aside
S0058	yeah yeah i do feel very sorry for um andrew sachs
S0179	i don't understand how they weren't arrest
S0058	yeah er well imagine if two guy two blokes two grow men have ring up my grandpa or your grandpa and say that about us
S0179	well it wouldn't have make wouldn't quite have work with my grandpa
S0058	no but okay so somebody ring up my grandpa and say that about me or or what would you have do you'd have ring the police it's not alright to do that you know it be just beyond
S0179	and the best thing er be there be a lot of evidence cos it go out live
S0058	it be er it wasn't
S0179	oh no it didn't
S0058	live no it wasn't
S0179	that be the thing wasn't it
S0058	that yeah somebody else um lose their job because of that well resign because of that the person who the buck stop with basically um
S0179	the buck stop with lot of people i suspect
S0058	well yeah but i think she be fairly high up and should've um you know she be the person who be the natural choice to sort of step down um but yeah that be quite bad you wonder which actual kind of normal employee whose job whose job it be to check those to let that go through
S0179	that would've be the er the the producer of the programme
S0058	but er that's what i mean like
S0179	whoever be in the sound booth at the time
S0058	oh true yeah yeah yeah people let it go through
S0179	though i imagine there wasn't much delay between it be make and it be broadcast it's gonna be more than a few minutes
S0058	no i think it be it be maybe like two days i think it be
S0179	wow
S0058	yeah cos they they a lot of stuff they make a little bite early so the i think they make it on the thursday and it go out on the saturday that's what i mean it wasn't like an a sort of oh god what be we gonna do panic it be
S0179	so people do actually sleep on it
S0058	yeah people hear this yeah um
S0179	but you'd think andrew sachs would've do something about it i mean they didn't speak to him do they they leave a message
S0058	they leave a message on his answerphone yeah maybe he do maybe that i mean maybe he just sit back and say er i need to i don't need to say anything er this be gonna you know and you know this be gonna go right for me they're gonna get a better come uppance if i just sit back and refuse to get you know refuse to rise to the bait
S0179	that's really annoy motorway sign on a
S0058	yeah
S0179	dual
S0058	on this and i don't know much about andrew sachs either but he the impression i've get he seem like a nice fairly elderly gentleman i say fairly elderly a nice respectable englishman
S0179	mm
S0058	i kind of imagine him be a bite like in real life slightly scandalous but nice
S0179	and who
S0058	um i er imagine andrew sachs be a bite like
S0179	who's
S0058	and
S0179	oh right yeah

S0179	yeah mm i'm sure the er the roadworks extend longer than this previously
S0058	oh
S0179	yeah cos it be that truck that be put the con down
S0058	right
S0179	cos again we've hit the point of the even where they're just start to put them out

S0179	maybe she find my gun
S0058	oh dear you didn't leave it lie around
S0179	no it be in the drawer
S0179	she's get no reason to go through those drawers

S0179	but if she do find it then that's that's her
S0058	she didn't really look that do sound really bad
S0179	what
S0058	maybe she find the gun
S0179	oh yeah
S0058	oh dear joy i haven't have any weird texts about key and porter today
S0179	hm
S0058	i do wish i'd find out who she be i be kind of hop when i texted back say i'm sorry you've get the wrong number i be hop she'd text me back and say oh sorry it's so and so from so and so
S0179	you should have just say who be you and how do you have my number
S0058	yeah i should've do
S0179	incidentally have it occur to you that um i be just wonder whether we're gonna get a text from whinging about how he's break his arm
S0058	oh i've break my arm fml
S0179	what's fml
S0058	fuck my life
S0179	never hear that
S0058	have you not hear that before it's like an internet thing so people tell sort of like depress stories um so like
S0179	do invent this expression
S0179	by any chance
S0058	no no
S0179	it do seem like a distinct possibility
S0179	fourteen miles to darlington six to scotch corner that's good cos there we will gain a motorway
S0058	yeah in er to be honest i think will probably have a whale of a time he love things like that he love trip away where he doesn't have the normal responsibilities of life he have a great summer cos he go to cameroon and then canada and he you know the food be make the wash be do you don't need to worry about anything it's the normal routine that he worry about and yeah when you're on a ski holiday you're not suppose to be do anything else you're suppose to be on your ski holiday there's no sort of other obligations to worry about so i think he'll have a whale of a time
S0179	yes well and now he's join an orchestra as well as a boat club and
S0058	well i mean
S0179	it's like for fuck's sake
S0058	the thing be
S0179	and a gym and a
S0058	i mean the thing be i think they be things he want to do i think he want to be in an orchestra and and a boat club that's fine but you probably don't have time to do that and the ewb like er and er i don't think he want to do ewb
S0179	isn't it a bite creepy shouldn't he leave it to his undergraduates the student
S0058	well he's he's he's get a a he's he's the professional network coordinator um yeah shall i um
S0058	do you want number one
S0179	er yes please what's that job
S0058	um he he kind of er send out information to the um the people who be interest as you know so kind of graduate who be interest if you like
S0179	right um
S0058	so er well no people who be in industry now
S0179	yeah
S0058	work as engineer who still wanna be without border
S0179	of course
S0058	um do you wanna turn it on or shall i
S0179	mm er the thing that amuse me a little bite i dunno why be the the fact that they take themselves really seriously and act as if it's sort of mé médecins sans frontières except they're not they don't do anything like that they piss about and
S0179	generally again they spend a lot of time train
S0058	yeah
S0179	for things that be never
S0058	there seem to be a big focus on train and meet and organization and hierarchy
S0179	if they if they spend a fraction of that time and energy earn extra get a part time job earn some more money send that to a proper aid organization or let alone the government
S0058	yeah
S0179	who actually do this sort of work properly
S0058	yeah i mean
S0179	cos again the point about médecins médecins sans frontières be they go into very iffy situations
S0058	yeah
S0179	so they they go before the who do they go into war zone
S0058	right
S0179	they actually go they go in ahead of arm force in some case
S0058	hence the sans frontières
S0179	yeah exactly they really put themselves in a lot of danger
S0058	yeah
S0179	engineer without border don't they don't go into any er they don't do any
S0058	no it's get an entirely different
S0179	they don't do any disaster relief work at least not in the immediate short term
S0058	not not short term no they do
S0179	they might go in six months later
S0058	yeah i mean i think the point er the the their sort of their purpose be that you teach people what how to do it themselves and you also teach them how to get the information themselves so they can stay up to date so that you don't need to go back
S0179	yes but the point be that actually it's very patronize
S0058	but yeah you can pay er one person to do that
S0179	no no it's incredibly patronize to say there be no engineer in cameroon
S0058	yeah no
S0179	of course there be engineer in cameroon who will do a lot more work a lot more effectively for a lot less money i e for the same amount of money particularly by the time you've fly out there you get a shitload more down
S0058	no well they pay yeah they pay for their own ticket so they could've donate that money
S0179	exactly it be essentially charity tourism it's a whole
S0058	yeah i mean er er
S0179	it's just by a slightly more high moral grind hey it's a it's a bite like you know i have no i make absolutely no bone about the fact that i do with st john ambulance i'm obviously do it because i want to have fun do it
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	um it will benefit people i'm not deny that but that's not
S0058	that's that's not why you're do it it's it's i mean
S0179	that's not the main role and
S0058	but you're open about that
S0179	but in this situation there's no alternative which will benefit people more
S0058	what by drive around
S0179	yeah there's no
S0058	really quickly
S0179	there's no sort i'm not i'm not do a job that someone else could do better for
S0179	standards et cetera
S0058	yeah
S0179	um and do you see what i mean whereas in this case it's no actually
S0058	yeah rather than students do it english students
S0179	english students what
S0058	well english
S0179	oh right
S0058	students from england not er yeah not not students of the english language
S0179	and again
S0058	that would be useless
S0179	it's fascinate how sort of oh yes cameroon it's like poverty stricken ain't it there's people who be homeless in this country who you could probably build house for
S0058	mm
S0179	but that wouldn't be very glamorous would it objectively if you go round and er you know a group of engineer get a bite a of council wasteland little bite of ease plan permission
S0058	hm
S0179	get and spend a couple of weeks knock up a essentially a scout hut that be a homeless refuge
S0058	mm yeah
S0179	which would do a lot more good for a lot less money really
S0058	hm
S0179	wouldn't it but it's very funny how people choose to
S0058	they choose to
S0179	yeah
S0058	to do things in exotic i be gonna say exotic locations i'm sure it wasn't very exotic but
S0179	it be pretty exotic
S0058	er different place um
S0179	africa be exotic as a location
S0058	mm
S0179	but of course it's africa it's poverty stricken therefore we feel good about ourselves cos we go and work in africa
S0058	yeah
S0179	again er this doesn't seem to be work terribly well
S0058	oh
S0179	do you wanna take it out and put it in again
S0058	yeah nice i'd actually select the wrong album anyway so hopefully that'll work a bite better um can you yeah there you be um
S0179	ha
S0058	i know ironic um but yeah i dunno it's what what i mean the the main thing be that i think it massively stress out and i'm not sure he actually want to do it or get much enjoyment from it and i think it's ruin his life so i figure he shouldn't do it and yeah i think cos he feel it's a more worthy hobby than or as he doesn't see it as a hobby he see it as something worthy rather than um be in the orchestra or row can you turn it down a tiny bite i'm struggle
S0179	yeah i overcompensate cos i think it be
S0179	too quiet
S0058	so yeah cos it's
S0179	newcastle thirty minutes yeah we'll be there before half past nine so
S0058	cool
S0179	four and three quarter hours sorry four and one quarter hours that's not too bad
S0058	not too bad consider
S0179	consider the traffic that's pretty good
S0058	yeah
S0179	i mean we be stationary for about five or ten minutes
S0058	yeah
S0179	but anyway
S0058	yeah um yeah i just think he's gonna kind of you know melt down as he have do on many occasion in the past
S0179	wow
S0058	wow
S0179	i'm start to dislike roadworks
S0058	you like them before
S0179	well i be expect those ones
S0058	oh right
S0179	so i be fine with it
S0058	oo mm but yeah
S0179	but anyway yeah
S0058	just it's a cos he er he keep say what i wanna do be i wanna go to work and i wanna come back and have my even just to enjoy myself and i'm like you're allow it's okay you don't have to do things it's ridiculous
S0179	jesus pff
S0058	oh my goodness me that save him what ten metres god
S0179	cos of the perspective thing that it hadn't occur to me he be that
S0058	like yeah how close he be oh my
S0179	what uh
S0058	okay okay this be different presumably we're just gonna go back onto the
S0179	this be er er no this be we're go to darlington
S0058	i know we be but the there wasn't another way to get onto the a1
S0179	assume this be too late
S0058	as in i assume we can just get straight back up again
S0179	i'd like to think so god that be er just to see a lorry move that quickly
S0058	yeah
S0179	to be honest i'm surprise the lorry didn't roll over
S0058	i think if we be we basically on the a66
S0179	yes um road atlas i think if we need to we can cut up to a road that go up via middlesbrough what do you call it the a
S0058	a19
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	as in that come in somewhere round here doesn't it
S0058	i'm not sure to be honest
S0179	a lot of good you be
S0058	oh i'm sorry
S0179	sorry there's a motorway in a mile this be different there be no warn about that
S0058	no that be really bad
S0179	surely
S0058	i don't er get where you be suppose to go
S0179	i'm sure we've just sort of inadvertently drive past that psychopath and i forget should've be a bite more cautious er i assume we're gonna encounter diversion sign cos i'm gonna follow the a66 unless something else emerge
S0058	yeah well er yeah
S0179	so er this be
S0058	well er we will come to a roundabout
S0179	i like unexpected drive like this
S0058	yeah um we're gonna come to a roundabout um where
S0179	yes i know those er roundabout sign give that away
S0058	so yeah so if you wanna go straight over this one anyway um and then then it basically go a bite woolly um
S0179	well like i say i i assume there'll be
S0058	we can stay on this road and then join the a19 we er basically we go um east straight across to middlesbrough cos we kind of
S0179	divert traffic yeah
S0058	oh right okay we'll stick with that then cos we might be able to get just straight back up and back onto the a1 which would be better
S0179	um
S0058	if we
S0179	it arguably would be faster to go across to middlesbrough
S0058	okay in that case we wanna
S0179	cos if we're go okay
S0058	we
S0179	so we're gonna go straight on here what's
S0058	so and then we're gonna er there's another roundabout do you wanna stay on the a66 even though the diversion's
S0179	well
S0058	different
S0179	can you well can you look at the route and tell us where the diversion will go
S0058	er it depend
S0179	which should be obvious
S0058	it it depend yeah it's probably gonna take us straight sort of up and it will just miss that one junction of the motorway
S0179	so the motorway have come down to a single carriageway road jesus whose fuck great idea be this
S0058	er yeah there be no warn at all about that that be daft
S0179	i didn't plan on see darlington tonight
S0058	no it's not unpleasant but you know um so yeah there's gonna be another roundabout and we can er either follow the diversion which be gonna be the second exit or we could take the third exit which be the a66 carry on on that whereas and then that join the um a19 at middlesbrough
S0179	be you confident you can navigate
S0058	yeah if you'd rather do that
S0179	yeah let's do that
S0058	and then the a19 then just go up to the coast
S0179	okay so we want the a66 yep great i like this er anything else
S0058	so yeah we want
S0179	i like this part of the country you know i do like the architecture and the
S0058	yeah so we want the third exit teeside a66
S0179	right
S0058	that yeah
S0179	of course a tiny proportion of these cars will actually be mean to go this way anyway
S0058	yeah yeah so
S0179	so not here
S0058	not here the next one well that be an interest diversion so
S0179	we'll make our own diversion damn you
S0058	well that take them a really odd route for that diversion very strange
S0179	yeah i think this one'll be quicker
S0058	take them like back along a little b road yeah so now we we stay on this road um we're gonna come to another roundabout we go straight over actually er we're gonna go through another two roundabouts where we go straight over but it should be fairly obvious they it's the it's the kind of the major road go right through
S0179	yeah yeah
S0058	um then we come to another one where we wanna go right which be the second exit it's a sort of t junction roundabout
S0179	okay then
S0058	um but i'll give you a shout when we get closer to that
S0179	sorry t function roundabout
S0058	well so it's a roundabout but there's only two exit and and one face leave and one face right
S0179	well i suggest we don't refer to it as a t junction
S0058	yeah sorry
S0179	that's very confuse of you
S0058	it be nice be in a in a sort of light up bite like that i could see the map
S0179	yeah true
S0058	we should get a little map torch or would that be too distract
S0179	phone
S0058	yeah no i'm i'm use it i'm not do er i'm use my phone but it's just
S0179	phone be perfect cos they're so low intensity light it doesn't distract the driver
S0058	yeah i be gonna say would a little torch be distract potentially
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah fair enough it fine like i you know i can see enough for this it's just normally i'm select quite odd menu options
S0179	you're not gonna accidentally shine it in my eye
S0058	yeah
S0179	football stadium
S0058	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0179	be darlington fc premier league
S0058	no no they're not
S0179	it's a big stadium for a shit team
S0058	not that big yeah so it's straight over this one
S0179	get that
S0058	but yeah er i tell you it would be obvious darlington football club i can't remember what league darlington be
S0179	what league be preston
S0058	preston oh preston north end's mm can't remember
S0179	there's two club in preston
S0058	no no as in that that's just what they're call i think
S0179	okay
S0058	there might be two club but that's that's what they're call um yeah but not not premier league do you wanna go to the match at some point
S0179	yeah
S0058	cool
S0179	yeah
S0058	have to be a home match as in in sunderland
S0179	why
S0058	um well if you wanna go and see sunderland play
S0058	so that you so you go as a supporter yeah you need to be in the ah no we we yeah in all fairness we could buy away ticket but make sure you get sunderland ticket cos the fan be segregate of course and you need to be in the right end for your team
S0179	right
S0058	otherwise it's a bite it's no it's not as much fun actually an away game would be good because the fan be really good no access to a66 east ah right that's where we wanna go okay that's different
S0179	why be there no access to a66 east
S0058	er pff
S0179	okay well quickly navigate
S0058	yeah so the next roundabout we wanna go right instead sorry yeah at the next roundabout we're gonna go right which be the third exit instead of go straight over okay
S0179	okay how far's that roundabout
S0058	um not far along maybe a mile
S0179	okay again information be good
S0058	okay sure yeah
S0179	you need to provide it
S0058	i'm hop that we'll be able to join the a66 at the next junction down
S0179	er
S0058	yeah so we want the a67 here which be the third exit okay
S0179	what do that sign say
S0058	eastbound close follow diversion okay well yeah
S0179	not er not another
S0058	so it's take us that way anyway
S0179	fuck diversion
S0058	yeah what be it with them tonight it might be best to follow this diversion because i don't know when the a66 open again so um but i'm gonna navigate and use the diversion and take whichever way i think's best
S0179	yeah okay
S0058	and and give you plenty of time yeah
S0179	so they're go straight on anyway
S0058	yeah
S0179	diversion be right
S0058	so this be yeah it's here yeah okay so we just carry along er nothing happen for age anyway on this road
S0179	yeah
S0058	maybe for um six miles i don't even think there's any roundabouts
S0179	six miles
S0058	yeah we we it go we're all almost all the way to middlesbrough
S0179	okay
S0058	yeah like i say we'll see where this diversion take us and see whether we can actually get onto the a66 at all um cos if we can't we won't go the way i be think
S0179	so the a66 would've take us to the a6 be that it
S0058	no the er a19
S0179	okay we have er one number which be a multiple of three in part of its name
S0179	sh
S0058	close enough you know what more do you want
S0179	well between nought and twenty there be one and twenty there be six possibilities i think i do quite well to get one of them
S0058	not bad yeah i love how er yeah we've go from the a1m to the um er road a with cycle path down one side
S0179	that's more entertain
S0058	it be true oh right there be a roundabout um straight on here then oh yes there be a roundabout yes it's definitely straight on here tiny one
S0179	yeah i'm sure the diversion will be straight on
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	yes
S0058	well er they er the you wouldn't the the other roads be just minor roads it wouldn't you wouldn't send us out there
S0179	mental note this drive be a pain in the arse on a friday
S0058	yeah
S0179	hm
S0058	be it be friday a day when they do roadworks particularly or be it just
S0179	apparently so
S0058	yeah as in i i would've think that would be a daft choice but maybe not
S0179	again apparently so
S0058	yeah fair enough okay so er straight over here again there wasn't even a diversion sign there
S0179	there be
S0058	be there oh i miss that okay on this on this road um when we come to it there's gonna be a junction
S0179	okay why aren't you overtake
S0058	rather than
S0179	sorry what be you say
S0058	um there's gonna be a junction which um there's a short stretch of a road which then take sort of maybe two miles which take us to the a66 if the diversion doesn't take well that would be the way i'd navigate but if the if the diversion doesn't take us that way i'm not gonna go because it might not be open
S0179	that's probably that road over there
S0058	mm um yeah so it's straight over here again
S0179	durham tee valley airport
S0058	mm
S0179	how many airports be there round here
S0179	sorry airports
S0058	no no um tee valley's quite big
S0179	big compare to newcastle
S0058	no newcastle airport's big
S0179	big compare to smaller than luton it's smaller than stansted
S0058	yeah but they're quite you know for the northeast it's
S0179	luton's not very big
S0058	no okay
S0179	my parent live within five miles of the runway it's not very big
S0058	okay fair enough ah teeside huh
S0179	so nearly at middlesbrough
S0058	yeah yeah oh so
S0179	rock on
S0058	yeah we're come up to yarm and egglescliffe be just sort of er outskirts of middlesbrough
S0179	no it's interest get to see a bite more of the country
S0058	that's true that's true
S0179	like expand my horizons
S0058	course the a19 go straight past where you've be
S0179	oh that's the nice north suburb
S0058	yeah yeah well it my auntie and uncle live in a nice bite of the not very nice north suburb of
S0179	railway station
S0058	that's really cool
S0179	not quite sure who it's serve actually that might not even be a station
S0058	er no i think it look disused oh no there be a station round here in fact there's lot of little station
S0179	anyway so where be we er
S0058	it's the train line to middlesbrough okay so um ah stockton on tee so yeah so like i say i'm gonna um base what we do next on what the diversion be because um yeah i don't know when the a66 open back up if at all if not we can just go straight onto the a19 it's just a slightly longer less you know it's er it's roads like this rather than dual carriageway a66 so we'll see what the diversion say
S0179	this would be a lot better if we weren't behind mr
S0179	hopalong
S0058	captain slow
S0179	no don't use that
S0058	oh i'm sorry jam may
S0179	this sound like newer music somehow the other track the other album's
S0058	mm
S0179	a bite more classic this be
S0058	it be yeah it's get like it's get the killers on it so it's er kind of anthems in a newer sense not anthems in the sense of everyone know them cos they're really old
S0179	yeah oh my eye be get tire
S0058	well we're not we're not far away we're in the right area of the country
S0179	again long vehicles turn stop them
S0058	yeah don't let them have rule about these things
S0179	that
S0058	divert traffic straight ahead here thank you
S0179	that that yeah like that psychopathic delivery driver cambourne
S0058	when
S0179	on the way to work yesterday
S0058	i wasn't there
S0179	yes you be
S0058	oh him
S0179	yes
S0058	oh god yeah mad
S0179	i'm just make it up
S0058	no i think you mean on your way to work
S0179	in cambourne
S0058	you do a bite of cambourne
S0179	not exactly a busy bite
S0058	no fair enough
S0179	well not exactly a
S0179	indeed
S0058	fewer lorries
S0179	my back's be remarkably good
S0058	maybe it be the the s the sort of late afternoon swim sort of stretch it out
S0179	oo there's an interest idea you could
S0058	so you could try that as a scientific experiment
S0179	you
S0058	to see if that actually help sort of really loosen it beforehand
S0179	you'd have to do an awful large sample size
S0179	to get get er meaningful data you'd need five on each
S0058	true oh yeah but still for a small
S0179	how be we go this slowly
S0179	if it wasn't dark and unlit i'd be overtake know what we're expect but we're on national speed limit for god's sakes
S0058	do you think they're drink and just be a bite cautious
S0179	no i just think they're shit
S0058	yeah maybe they just don't haven't think about it
S0179	again er do anything that cause you to fail a drive test
S0058	hm
S0179	and it's not just i don't want to drive quickly
S0058	yeah
S0179	it's er no it's unacceptable to drive this slowly
S0058	so it's straight over this one yeah
S0179	this be quite a long diversion
S0058	it be
S0179	what be it with diversions tonight
S0179	it seem to be the route of least resistance
S0058	yeah well we're nearly at the place where er it will sort of
S0058	be send one way or the other by the diversion
S0179	if the a19's shut
S0058	god diversion get a boat
S0179	swim
S0058	yeah
S0179	turn
S0058	leave your car it's faster that way
S0179	diversion here's a pair of roller skate
S0058	yeah
S0179	thirty
S0058	oh right we're go through apparently
S0179	ah yes of course we're in a thirty
S0058	so he's so he's do forty
S0179	so the car be speed
S0058	yeah
S0179	yes
S0058	nice
S0179	uh i apologize for that i wasn't expect to go through a thirty prior to get
S0179	to sunderland
S0058	yeah okay so um diversion be point us leave which be good that mean we can get back onto the a66
S0179	oo tesco's
S0058	so er yeah
S0179	for some reason i've get a real er hanker to go to that big tesco's in
S0058	ah
S0179	i bet everything everything would be very cheap up there so hang on here
S0058	yeah leave here yeah
S0179	well there be sort of two lefts so
S0058	oh sorry yeah
S0179	not entirely obvious which one
S0058	well i i i assume that's the one the diversion one that junction wasn't a roundabout here so
S0179	oh great
S0058	i assume it's new
S0179	we need a new map
S0058	we need a new map yeah
S0179	again when we're sail along the er a1 that wouldn't be happen
S0058	not so much no tend not to have pedestrians anyway
S0179	this doesn't look mark for life i assume that's a tattoo yes
S0058	that's a tattoo yeah
S0179	that's not a good
S0058	that doesn't sound good that's not a that's like scar for life
S0058	wow this look dire
S0179	outskirts of middlesbrough right
S0058	um yeah which be a village on the outskirts of middlesbrough yeah
S0179	it's not a village
S0058	well sort of settlement whatever you might call it
S0179	yeah
S0058	so yeah so now we're head north through um and yeah we're gonna join the a66 again
S0179	oh that's interest
S0058	oh railway
S0179	that's either a level cross or a fire station
S0058	oh right i know where we be we're not on the road i think we be on but this be the way the diversion's go and because of that roundabout this isn't on this map um
S0179	okay we're come up to a roundabout
S0058	so er straight over
S0179	oh look logistics centre
S0058	yeah
S0179	a k a lorry depot
S0058	yeah
S0179	i'm enjoy this this be er unexpected
S0058	it's different ain't it really yeah
S0179	yeah i think i'd have more fun do this
S0058	fair enough
S0179	cos most people would be get stress in this situation
S0058	yeah ironically it would've be faster just to go with the other diversion rather than try to do the short cut because of the second diversion but it's not unpleasant
S0179	well no we don't know that
S0058	no no that's true we don't
S0179	and this way we're see more of the country
S0058	we be we be see more of teeside should be see at least once once see never forget
S0179	yes
S0179	see at least once so you know to avoid it
S0058	yeah pretty much i love the way everything in um teeside be call something to do with durham
S0058	because durham's quite scenic and quite historic
S0179	yeah
S0058	teeside's
S0179	incidentally um and er who's er who while he be work for have a heart and lung transplant
S0058	shit
S0179	yes indeed um but so we're gonna rope him into help with the um
S0179	oxygen supply thing
S0058	oh my goodness
S0179	well
S0058	you know about these things
S0179	yeah basically
S0058	god
S0179	cos prior to the operation he be carry round
S0058	yeah
S0179	an oxygen source
S0058	so i i guess he'll know he'll have opinions on these things
S0179	yeah exactly
S0058	fair enough
S0179	apparently it be cystic fibrosis or something
S0058	right
S0179	but a heart and lung transplant that's like so the your significant organs be someone else's
S0058	yeah
S0179	that's impressive
S0058	yeah wow
S0179	i just think it's medical science have evolve that far
S0058	yeah yeah that you can have such a big part of you replace and er fine it's awesome
S0179	oh dear right
S0058	okay so when we reach it we're gonna go um gosh it's difficult i'm not sure yeah so we're gonna go over the top of the a66 i think and then
S0179	we'll join it
S0058	and then join it yeah
S0179	after a very short while
S0058	yes for a very short period at which point we'll join the a19 um so maybe um six miles or so
S0179	this er this whole area's quite weird there doesn't seem to be much countryside this actually seem to be a seem to be a smatter of small place
S0058	yeah okay so
S0179	the country i'm assume we go straight over
S0058	straight over this one and then yeah
S0179	and then right here
S0058	and then this next one be right yeah yeah
S0179	here
S0058	middlesbrough a66 yes this be it ah this be quiet anyway diversion end thank for that
S0179	oh wow well it's it's be shut
S0058	yeah fair enough we're first
S0179	hell yeah
S0058	or last depend on which way you look at it interest night for an open top car
S0179	it's not open well he's get the top close
S0058	oh have he
S0179	yeah
S0058	oh
S0179	top
S0058	oh okay
S0179	that's what 's get
S0058	yeah
S0179	which i believe you've be in
S0058	i have be in it it's really fun she take me to the station in it
S0179	with the top down
S0058	yeah
S0058	oh no sorry not with the top down no no the top be up
S0179	i've never be in that car
S0058	it's fun it's quite low
S0179	yes
S0058	i do sort of sink down into it i have trouble get out but there be room in the boot for my case so you know credit to it
S0179	that's probably why the roof be up
S0058	oh yeah fair enough and it be also stupid o'clock in the morning bite nippy
S0179	be it
S0058	i say stupid o'clock eight o'clock which isn't actually that early
S0179	oh right
S0179	i think you mean like two a m or something
S0058	this be when i be um leave theirs and they be gonna bring all my stuff over but i be come to yours with a suitcase which be gonna last me er the first few days in the house
S0179	oh so you go to station
S0058	yeah yeah sorry this be take me from their house to station so i could go to work then go straight to yours then straight to the house
S0179	okay
S0058	and they they bring my stuff to the house later ah that be a odd little while but it be nice
S0179	sorry
S0058	it be a odd little while live with and but it be nice
S0179	yeah live with them
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	yarm
S0058	yarm not yarp yarm
S0058	it's get a very famous nightclub in yarm call tall tree
S0179	what
S0058	it's get a very famous nightclub in yarm call tall tree um
S0179	oh you've actually hear of it right
S0058	yarm yeah yeah it's yeah it's i've er i've only er i only know it because of tall tree and because um
S0179	wow look at that
S0058	and talk about it that's pretty cool
S0058	yeah thornaby yeah that's where my old maths teacher er my a level maths teacher live
S0179	wow yeah the conurbations round here be really weird cos there's load of pretty big cities all link by a fairly good dual carriageway network
S0058	mm
S0179	which you just don't get in the south cos everything's round london which be link by the m25
S0058	right
S0179	so there's not say a direct link between er st albans and hemel and welwyn
S0058	right okay
S0179	or at least by dual carriageway a road
S0058	so the roads be all smaller
S0179	yeah because it's
S0058	because
S0179	assume you either want to go in or out of london or around london but
S0058	right yeah
S0179	not directly between any of the other place
S0058	that's interest yeah whereas here because there isn't that really insane motorway
S0179	yeah indeed
S0058	you just you need those roads yeah
S0058	have you see the um vodafone yoda advert
S0179	we don't want to go there
S0058	no we don't want to go there we'll stay on here
S0179	good navigation tip
S0058	sorry yeah
S0179	er anyway
S0179	vodafone yoda
S0058	the so yoda's in the new vodafone advert it's really funny so um there's a guy who's get two phone and yoda's like ah i will transfer the contact from one to the other with the power of my mind and he's like no no it's fine vodafone do that automatically yoda and he be like oh i i can tell i've listen to i've see this without the sound on this be
S0179	mm
S0058	my my interpretation of what be happen um
S0179	ah
S0058	okay so er now we wanna move over to the leave
S0179	yeah
S0058	cos apparently north and south be both this direction doesn't give you much warn do it
S0179	not a huge amount no it's only a fifty though
S0058	true
S0179	wow that's er
S0058	and so we wanna go north
S0179	oh i could use a pizza now actually
S0179	i'm assume that's er ah oh
S0058	um yeah north wow they really need more sign
S0179	yes they really do wow
S0058	oh yeah have you be on this
S0179	cool
S0058	before bite before
S0179	no
S0058	oh no this be really
S0179	awesome
S0058	have you not be yeah this be really cool um yeah my dad be drive along this when it be windy that time you know there be the horrendous gales
S0179	sorry
S0058	that's alright
S0179	didn't occur to me that be a give way that's not a give way line
S0058	no
S0179	as in that be a give way line but you need that's a give way line
S0058	yeah
S0179	jesus that be frighten i be gonna say hang on where's the fee in line
S0058	yeah hang on
S0179	fuck
S0179	that's appallingly mark
S0058	yeah that whole spit be just shock you need to know where you're go otherwise you're screw yeah so this be the a19 the really cool bite
S0179	yeah
S0058	and this be middlesbrough
S0179	i have be over this bite before but it be specifically where it that bit's rise up to it
S0058	yeah
S0179	which be quite cool so what a stupid place to put a junction
S0058	yeah
S0179	you could probably give your parent a ring and tell them we're in middlesbrough north
S0058	okay be you
S0179	how long do it normally take from here
S0058	um er my dad's normally drive
S0179	yes
S0058	um i i'm not to be honest i'm not actually sure about half an hour but
S0179	oh great
S0058	but like he's do drive considerably slower so er i can give them a ring and just say er they'll know exactly where we be
S0179	yeah
S0058	should i do that yeah
S0179	yeah yeah go for it
S0058	can i just turn this off do you mind
S0179	yeah
S0058	hello it's me um we've just er go um round middlesbrough on the a19 there be a few diversions um so yeah so we've just go round the raise bite you know where i mean yeah yeah maybe slightly less
S0179	over the raise bite over
S0058	okay then well um um yeah if you put them in that'd be good um um not not for you know um don't put them in straight away but um i dunno well but yeah we'll be
S0179	don't like them overcook
S0058	we'll be um yeah maybe slightly less than half an hour okay then see you soon okay bye
S0179	you relay what i'm say
S0058	no but i be as
S0179	as in don't tell
S0058	what you don't like them overcook
S0179	yeah i can just imagine your mother nuke a pizza
S0058	i've say don't put them in straight away and we'll be quicker than she think anyway so
S0179	but nonetheless can i just say could you
S0058	okay sorry
S0179	please relay what i've say
S0058	sorry i didn't know you i didn't know you want me to to to say that
S0179	no i'm just speak for the sake of it of course i want you to relay what i'm say
S0058	okay sorry
S0179	or at least take not relay it but take it into account and supply
S0058	i do i say don't put them in straight away obviously anyway um yeah that be fun twenty two to sunderland
S0179	that'll be to the centre
S0058	yeah
S0179	so we'll make it in twenty minutes or less
S0058	cool
S0179	be this er a pizza delivery
S0058	sorry
S0058	oh right yeah
S0179	i'm extremely tire
S0058	nearly back now this be the easy bite
S0179	no this be more difficult when your eye be this tire
S0058	okay we should watch that film the one with the um
S0179	yeah i want to
S0058	yeah we'll er try and find it it's gonna be awesome when we can just go fancy watch that film with the pizza delivery guy oh yeah let's just go and watch it
S0179	yeah i'm very tire i'm start to make mistake
S0058	so er do you i mean do you think sign up for that lovefilm thing's worth it do you think that'd be a good idea
S0179	as soon as we get internet yes
S0058	yeah oh yeah no that would be i'm not suggest we sign up for it now
S0179	but if we buy one new film at fifteen quid a month that's
S0058	yeah
S0179	exactly the same thing
S0058	yeah
S0179	so we'll only buy stuff that we've watch and really like
S0058	yeah exactly that you wanna watch over and over again and yeah er so we can try things for the first time on lovefilm and then
S0179	mm
S0058	buy them if they're amaze
S0179	be that that park place shop centre
S0058	um the park place
S0179	oh no it's service darlington park no
S0058	oh herrington no no no
S0179	yeah
S0058	no no that's um that's that's kind of in sunderland
S0179	that's not in sunderland
S0058	herrington country park
S0179	no you pillock the outlet store
S0058	oh dalton park
S0058	oh no no that's in that's um the other direction
S0179	no it's not
S0058	oh no it's er it's much further north though than this
S0179	i don't believe you sometimes more specifically i don't believe i let you navigate
S0058	i if i'm if i'm if i'm look at a map and i've find it and then i'd tell you where it be
S0179	yes but just the fact you fundamentally don't know it's in the same direction as middlesbrough christ
S0058	okay it's twenty miles
S0179	no it's twenty miles five hundred er five hundred yards ago
S0058	okay so twenty miles less five hundred yards
S0179	no
S0058	bite more now
S0179	less one thousand yards keep it up
S0058	how come road sign be still in miles even though everything else have be sort of metrics
S0179	everything else hasn't be er a lot of stuff's still in er imperial er speed for example
S0058	yeah
S0179	but er fundamentally they're just a better unit to measure speed and distance in
S0058	okay
S0179	use to and it's it's a bigger unit
S0058	yeah so it make more sense
S0179	it be quite useful have both
S0058	cos i mean like in a lot of countries they measure it in kilometres i guess and kph would be the car's measurements speed wise
S0179	yes but it's quite easy cos you have sort of thirty forty fifty sixty
S0058	yeah
S0179	they're very nice speed
S0058	yeah
S0179	like sixty miles an hour to a mile a minute which be
S0058	yeah nice to work it out
S0179	yeah exactly so you've get
S0058	and i think like when we be use to other stuff before they change it though like we'd have be use to the old system of weigh things and you could've say ah well i think people be just intrinsically use to it but
S0179	no but i mean because a mile's bigger i think it's a better unit
S0058	yeah no fair enough i'm just curious cos so much other stuff's be sort of switch over and like you're not allow to sell um er you're not allow to exclusively sell things in imperial units in shop like food wise
S0179	no it's er the european regulation
S0058	yeah i'm just curious about why sort of roads presumably because it's to do with sell between countries and stuff whereas miles on the road doesn't really affect the other european countries
S0179	well you can still sell stuff in imperial um
S0058	oh yeah but you'd have to have the metric on as well
S0179	no you would you er just shut up and let me finish what i'm say
S0058	i'm sorry
S0179	no you don't if you look at in shop possibly but a lot of technical steel be still sell in half inch thickness for example
S0058	oh okay
S0179	which be to twelve point five four mil but
S0058	okay
S0179	it's
S0058	that's interest
S0179	yeah it's er inch be still in engineer it's still in very common usage er psi as a unit of pressure for example pound per square inch
S0058	interest mm maybe it's just sort of yeah i dunno really but i don't know why that would be different cos cos you can't sell food without the metric thing on because there be a guy in sunderland like have a massive court battle about it cos he want to keep sell apples in pound or whatever and they say no you've gotta have metric on your sign
S0179	incidentally er this be the right choice this be a much quieter much nicer road
S0058	hm fair enough
S0179	but a divert randomly divert and traffic work
S0058	mm
S0179	road work er a1m would've be
S0058	yeah i wouldn't say this be an american anthem
S0179	isn't it english
S0058	no they're american yeah um i'm sort of er
S0179	who be they
S0058	the the killers
S0179	be they oh i always think they be english
S0058	how do i you oh no no they're american um i only know that cos i've read lot um and rufus um write a song about brandon flower
S0179	be rufus wainwright english or american
S0058	american well canadian um and spend a lot i think he live in america but he's canadian by birth
S0179	right um i'm not gonna be exactly sure which junction it be to come off at so you be gonna have to
S0058	okay i'll um yeah so we come off um we'd normally um go kind of over this road where we come off at the durham service
S0179	yes i know
S0058	yeah come off there
S0179	i do actually this road layout pretty well
S0058	i know i'll um yeah i'll give you a shout
S0179	i'm just not exactly sure come at it from this perspective
S0058	yeah
S0179	oh great
S0058	he's get a cap on
S0179	of course he have
S0058	bad sign
S0179	that's why we need to get past him because of his er interest indications
S0058	mm i love the name such a good place name
S0179	that song annoy me completely meaningless
S0058	what
S0179	stupid play on word
S0058	i've get soul but i'm not a soldier
S0179	yeah it just sound like it's mean as a political statement it's er no
S0058	it sound good it's easy to sing i'm not sure this bite particularly mean very much
S0179	i don't think any of this song mean anything
S0058	yeah but still
S0179	that's why i quite like nickelback songs actually they're they be i mean the lyric be very good they always tell a narrative they're there's nothing just there for its own sake
S0058	mm i dunno i i'm kind of tear about this because on the one hand i'm like do it really matter if they don't mean er like idlewild a lot of the lyric don't really mean anything and it's more about er the way they sound when he sing them so he sing kind of word round and round quite a lot
S0179	but surely a song should be about something
S0058	well exactly i'm sort of tear about whether it need to be or not
S0179	even if you're just for each person like i mean i think a song that have associations for a person depend on where they might have hear it and er what it's about for that person may not be what the song
S0058	mm
S0179	be mean to be about but it should still mean something specific it shouldn't just be a
S0058	but
S0179	random sequence of sound
S0058	but be it about the word or be it be can the sound themselves mean something and the sort of the sound of the word even if the sense of the word doesn't
S0179	yeah but you can't just fill it with random word
S0058	no no i don't mean that i just mean so you have an instrumental piece of music can that mean something to you even if it doesn't have a story or word
S0179	yes
S0058	so
S0179	but that they don't try to put random word into it that's the point i've no problem with with no word in it have mean but i have a problem with
S0058	okay but so
S0179	a song have mean but in order to sell it they've felt the need to add word
S0179	that don't make much sense with it
S0058	okay so if if but if it be a piece of music and you and it be just yeah yeah yeah over and over again there be no other word in it that would basically be an instrumental
S0179	no it wouldn't because you've randomly insert a meaningless word
S0058	but if it's
S0058	to do with the note that that sound be that that word be sing at that's
S0179	well
S0058	it's kind of a grey area er i just think it's a grey area and yeah it doesn't mean anything anyway it's just a song
S0179	peterlee
S0058	yay it's your spiritual home
S0179	mm business premise no it's not
S0058	what business premise
S0179	right twelve miles out be there in ten minutes or so
S0058	yep
S0179	it's gonna have be about four and three quarter hours which isn't bad by any measure
S0058	consider the diversions we've be on kind of tour of scenic teeside
S0179	well for nearly five hours and i've be at work for eight
S0179	it's be quite a tire day
S0058	yeah look forward to crash out tonight i think
S0179	what be you talk about you've be sit there do fuck all
S0058	sorry you must be look forward to crash out tonight i think
S0179	yes
S0058	yeah
S0058	you love it
S0179	well i just don't know why there be actually a place in er tyne and wear call pity me
S0058	yeah that's excellent there's pity me there's um what's the other good one i can't remember but er there's some classic name
S0179	suck me off ville
S0058	no er i have a friend who live in pity me though
S0179	of course you do
S0058	ah hyundai it's the my only association with hyundai be now the tim minchin song where he um if he really love me um you'd er i can't remember the first bite so you get a load of um you'd get a load of parakeets and teach them to fly and teach them to shit the word tim be god on my ex girlfriend's hyundai just such a good rhyme
S0058	oh love tim minchin
S0179	i wonder if you could do that
S0058	quite difficult
S0179	i know but bird some bird be quite intelligent
S0058	yeah but you'd need all of them to be intelligent
S0179	no you oh yeah formation shit yes
S0058	quite tricky okay so maybe eight miles to our junction so it's not far now
S0179	how do you know that
S0058	cos i've just see which junction we're at and i'm gonna and you know count the inch
S0179	i suspect we're less than eight miles out to be honest
S0058	okay
S0179	plus it the sign say twelve a mile or so ago and that's to sunderland centre which be a couple of miles in so
S0058	okay maybe slightly less then maybe six to the junction oh yeah so that reckon eight miles to sunderland it be good when we do it from um from the a1 and it be exactly the right distance from there to my house
S0179	yeah
S0058	um on the sign
S0179	well look at a map of sunderland you could argue that sort of area centre
S0058	mm yeah
S0058	it depend what you count er um as ever um
S0179	well no like i say sunderland
S0058	mm yeah probably where i've hear this song before um mel c do a cover of it in the early millennium and i didn't know it be a cover which be why i be quite surprise to hear mel c on this album
S0179	mm
S0058	it's definitely not she be sporty spice definitely not her
S0179	be this the original
S0058	yeah this be the original one
S0058	oo
S0179	well road
S0058	hm
S0179	down we can experiment and try follow this down as far as the a1m
S0058	yeah yeah could do might be different
S0179	yeah
S0058	and that would of course be simpler because we wouldn't need to mess about go through the middle of teeside
S0179	oh yes
S0058	as in we wouldn't be
S0179	be this our exit
S0058	no yeah no ours be the one after this one which be about four miles after it could be slightly less
S0179	funshack
S0058	it's the most fun you can have in a shack
S0179	funshack
S0058	it's fun for a shack i've get no idea what funshack be
S0179	let's google it
S0058	yeah let's not you might get result okay so the next exit's gonna be for the a690 um which should be signpost some point um and that's the one that's the the road that come out from durham
S0179	yeah yeah just stop navigate now that's fine
S0058	be you sure
S0179	sure
S0058	wow
S0179	don't wanna see sunderland that brightly light up
S0179	this road's still fairly quiet
S0058	yeah it's really pleasant
S0179	i like drive i just like be i just like be out and get about
S0058	yeah
S0179	see place
S0058	yeah
S0179	cos my major gripe at work really be that i do feel to a certain extent trap in one location like i'm er miss the wonderful day by be inside an office
S0058	yeah
S0179	as in
S0058	but i guess that's
S0179	yeah i know i mean it's still far more freedom to get about than i ever would've do sort of but the problem be i i almost feel like i feel like i'm not at uni do work therefore i feel like it's work the holiday which be therefore deprive me from do holiday things
S0058	right yeah
S0179	slightly different mindset
S0058	mm yeah i mean
S0179	whereas my gap year just felt like a prison sentence so
S0058	yeah
S0179	what be you say
S0058	um i mean i guess at least with your job you're kind of in one place and you're work and you don't see the day and stuff but then sometimes you get send off to nice place
S0179	occasionally yeah
S0058	which be you know it's kind of a perk
S0058	that a lot of job don't have like i'm not gonna get send off anywhere for quite some years um that just ain't happen
S0058	you know and
S0179	that sunderland south exit be a long way of so they didn't cos
S0058	it
S0179	that be sunderland north straight on but in fact it's sunderland middle
S0058	yeah
S0179	and sunderland north
S0058	middle and north yeah exactly
S0179	that's like cambridge be with three motorways
S0058	yeah
S0179	it's actually cambridge have kind of get four well no it's get two two of those four be only unidirectional so in opposite directions
S0058	right
S0179	so that kind of just leave three
S0058	okay so
S0179	actually one of them's not
S0058	half a mile to our junction
S0179	actually one of them's not on a motorway so
S0058	so actually
S0179	really it be three
S0058	cb odd thing to see on a bus down here
S0179	up here yeah oh
S0058	yay
S0179	actually now i've remember now i'll remember that you can see that from this exit that's gonna
S0058	yeah
S0179	make life a lot easier
S0058	yeah
S0179	i would've think this'd be clear of traffic
S0058	this roundabout maybe it's just busy all the time ah we're drive past my dentist
S0179	sorry
S0058	we be drive past my dentist
S0179	be we really
S0058	just see it yeah i'll be back soon enough anyway
S0179	yeah fair enough
S0058	no i think i think i'll go home if it's all the same to you sorry i think i'll go to my parent if it's all the same to you
S0179	i'm refreshingly surprise that this be a forty they could very easily have just make it a thirty
S0058	yeah
S0179	sunderland's
S0058	it's very wide
S0179	fuck bus lanes why be there so many
S0058	the this
S0179	i pay road tax bus users don't
S0058	this road be a pain for bus lanes
S0179	it's not too much of an issue with these condition
S0058	oh yeah it's not a problem it's just this road in particular be quite well know for it wow a shop there make that bet
S0179	sorry
S0058	there's a shop er a bet shop there call make that bet wow
S0179	catchy
S0058	yeah just an instruction same as my condition it's not a condition that's a description
S0179	yes
S0179	i love how do kind of admit that
S0058	yeah well fair enough why give it a stupid name i guess they could've give it some er weird latin long name but actually let's be straightforward about it i always think red be a really bad sign for them to choose
S0179	what
S0058	for the dentist we've just er go past it
S0179	okay
S0058	and the sign red which i think be a not a good colour for a dentist it's sort of red with silver write but it's not as bad as the one that be just down from my house er which be black with red write on it which really isn't good for a dentist
S0179	why
S0058	just conjure up the wrong sort of image
S0179	sort of boudoir
S0058	yeah boudoir slash blood slash passion slash it just doesn't you want cool white and blue surely so it's all gonna be alright it's gonna be clean and calm and
S0179	maybe that's
S0058	yeah
S0179	what they're try to get away from
S0058	yeah maybe
S0179	those house be quite nice
S0058	they're quite cool
S0179	out
S0058	yeah she be out um um oh what do they call it there's a word for that
S0058	no no yeah something like that i can't remember what they call it um yeah those house be quite nice dunno which what they're like though but they look quite smart
S0179	problem just lose a contact lens
S0058	okay um
S0179	and that's a problem
S0058	do you need to
S0179	er
S0058	do you do you need to pull over
S0179	er yes but i can't really
S0058	yeah um there be a a sort of a a leave turn here if you want to take it
S0179	no no that's alright i can drive one eye
S0058	okay sure
S0179	i tell you my eye be really tire
S0058	yeah
S0179	ah no find it again
S0058	oh good brilliant well do
S0179	i know i'm surprise too
S0058	very confuse all these traffic light
S0179	you see i can't help feel that a roundabout would have make this
S0179	a lot easier
S0058	yeah wow yeah when you see it yeah so they've come round they've gotta stop there now um
S0179	so there's four er roads go across each other
S0179	roundabout
S0058	shit roundabout
S0179	it's be think of
S0058	yeah this problem's be solve nice i have a moment there that bus be the number four and i have a kind of oo bus for cambourne moment no
S0179	possibly that might be an expensive ticket
S0058	yeah
S0179	i hope it's get toilets on it
S0058	yeah
S0179	see as bus aren't actually that comfortable as modes of transport you see coach be comfortable fundamentally
S0058	yeah
