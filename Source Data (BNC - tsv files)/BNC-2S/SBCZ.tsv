S0104	and also say at work this morning the thing be about january birthdays be people always give you their cast off that they don't want at christmas
S0167	i would do that
S0104	mm
S0167	yeah but i wouldn't make it obvious it be a cast off i'd just pretend i'd get it so i wouldn't give them anything that have hollies on it or
S0104	mm

S0104	no i i i'm 's a special friend and she always go get go ridiculous
S0167	yeah
S0104	on my birthday so i'll have to get her something more than a bath set anyway
S0167	that's what i be think about december birthdays erm say that people nowadays just give her a double present and i think that's really i think that's really mean
S0104	oh that's horrible yeah
S0167	and i think you should just never ever do that
S0104	but
S0167	and she's bear on the twenty third of december
S0104	oh have be buy up with that
S0167	no she say they didn't when she be a child but now people just go oh that's for your birthday and christmas
S0104	do she hate that
S0167	well she say she doesn't mind but i'd say i i'd really mind that
S0104	yeah i would as well
S0167	no one's ever do that to me before but if they do i would i wouldn't probably say anything depend on how close they
S0104	i do i give you machu pichu erm the amazon for your birthday and christmas
S0167	well yeah but that's
S0104	mm
S0167	different cos it be really expensive but erm yeah if someone just give you one present and say oh that's for your birthday and christmas i'd just be like take it back for me i don't want it i wouldn't
S0104	i've still get to get 's proper christmas present
S0167	i've still get to get a birthday present but i've gotta wait till next month when i they pay me i hate the way keep plan expensive things
S0104	well he must do he pay for you cos if he plan
S0167	well i don't
S0104	expensive things and he know you haven't get the money and then he pay then he must be prepare for the fact that he's go to have to pay
S0167	well yeah but it still make me feel er feel i have to contribute some things it still
S0104	what's he plan then
S0167	well okay so we're gonna go to visit his sister in switzerland
S0104	yeah
S0167	on the first
S0104	oh yeah cos you've get that
S0167	day so we're gonna drive
S0104	use that
S0167	straight from
S0104	right
S0167	erm and he's decide now instead of drive all the way down to switzerland and stay there the first night we'll stop halfway down in nuremberg
S0104	right
S0167	and stay in a hotel and then drive on the next day but it's just extra like expense isn't it
S0104	well say i can't afford to do that and he'll say i know i'm go to pay for it
S0167	and then my guilt's yeah but it's
S0104	why because it's his suggestion his idea
S0167	well i know but he just
S0104	well have you say to him please stop do all these expensive things i just haven't get the money at the moment
S0167	yeah and then he's like well i know you haven't get the money
S0104	well then that's it then just make the most of it
S0104	he won't always be like so romantic it do wear off
S0167	oh don't say that i want him to be like this forever
S0167	anyway i'd quite like to see nuremberg anyway i think that's something
S0104	yeah
S0167	i'd like to see
S0104	very interest
S0167	i want to go at christmas cos apparently they have the best christmas market in nuremberg they're like well know there
S0104	will you get to see the nuremberg court and all that the nuremberg trial things
S0167	i guess so
S0104	i wonder why they choose nuremberg to do it
S0167	dunno i think it's just quite a big
S0104	be nuremberg erm sorry you'll have to excuse my appal geography knowledge cos i fully admit my be nuremberg
S0167	mum i've get i've no idea exactly where nuremberg be
S0104	so i be go to say it's
S0167	i know it's a bite more south of bautzen and that's
S0104	be it's it's in germany not switzerland be it
S0167	no it's it's in germany
S0104	oh right but i could understand if they be in if it be i switzerland cos switzerland be neutral wasn't it
S0167	no they be in germany
S0104	erm so that would make sense but
S0167	well it's wasn't it cos erm the germans get really right erm really strict about their denazification process so i guess they want to be see to be do
S0104	so who be the germans who run the nuremberg trials where be they during the war
S0167	i don't know
S0104	cos i've get
S0167	i do about the nuremberg trials in my first year and er
S0104	yeah
S0167	i can't remember much about
S0104	i think that everybody have to be you know during the hitler regime everybody have to show allegiance to hitler so these people must have
S0167	and that i think it be it be war crimes it wasn't just anyone who do a heil hitler it be actually war crimes like the the ss guard who work at the camp or
S0104	mm
S0167	i don't think it be just
S0104	supporters
S0167	the guy who work at the bakery and say
S0104	yeah
S0167	heil hitler
S0104	but it wasn't just german erm people head it be it it be
S0167	i i wouldn't have think so
S0104	it be the erm the whole of
S0167	i would have think it be load of different countries
S0104	yeah
S0167	yeah cos you know the german i i think they're change it soon but the german army there be still restrictions on how big the german army can be
S0104	oh really what by the by nato
S0167	yeah
S0104	really
S0167	erm and
S0104	i didn't know that
S0167	i think i think they're think about change it now but erm yeah there's always be restrictions up till now cos there it be never allow to get too big and there's still load of american and british soldier just erm station in germany
S0104	really
S0167	and i think
S0104	oh i think that be stop
S0167	yeah yeah
S0104	grandpa be station in germany during his conscription
S0167	yeah they're still there and
S0104	oh i think
S0167	be station there in
S0104	what to keep an eye on them
S0167	yeah just to make sure and they're still there but
S0104	your
S0167	yeah
S0104	your ex
S0167	yeah tell me he be in just before i go and erm yeah but i think that's also another thing they they're gonna pull them out of germany cos it's a waste of time and money now
S0104	yeah well i
S0167	if i be in the army i'd be quite happy to be station in germany and not
S0104	yeah
S0167	in iraq or afghanistan
S0104	so would i grandpa be in germany grandpa no grandpa by the skin of his teeth he nearly go to korea
S0167	oh gosh
S0104	during erm during the korean war
S0167	oh
S0104	and by the it be it be a toss up between him and some other bloke and i'm not quite sure why it work out that grandpa but he get to go to germany
S0167	and he
S0104	and erm
S0167	oh lucky him
S0104	the other bloke go i don't know whether
S0167	he might never have meet grandma if
S0104	yeah i don't know whether the other bloke come back
S0167	mm i'm glad they don't do national service anymore what a horrible thing to do
S0104	well some people say young men of today need it
S0167	oh whatever those people be as it's
S0104	but i think some
S0167	they're the kind of people that go oh the youth of today
S0104	well if you've get thuggish attitudes you can go into the army
S0167	i think it probably be
S0104	come out with a whole lot more
S0167	yeah the army doesn't make you a better person
S0104	mm
S0167	if you
S0104	no but they say it it teach people a trade who might otherwise not have learn one
S0167	yeah but
S0104	that's what that's
S0167	no but
S0104	i'm not i'm not defend what they say i'm just tell you their reason
S0167	most people i know know what they want to do or they don't need a to go into the army to learn it
S0104	no no i agree i would hate cos if they do conscription now it would have to be with erm racial er not racial sorry sexual equality and all that
S0167	yeah
S0104	it would have to be all girls and all boys and
S0167	apparently i don't know how true this be but my german teacher say that cos they still have national service in germany up until about two thousand and six or something
S0104	mm
S0167	and erm it be it have by the end it be girls as well
S0104	yeah
S0167	so they have a spate of er teenagers get pregnant so they didn't have to go cos if you're pregnant or have a child
S0104	yeah
S0167	you didn't have to do it
S0104	yeah
S0167	so they just have eighteen year olds get pregnant
S0104	and also erm you know how can a country sustain pay
S0167	i know and there isn't enough for them to do in the army
S0104	yeah
S0167	and apparently you're by the end it become a joke because the boys would just be sit there make cup of tea for the
S0104	officer
S0167	for the the officer because there be nothing for them to do
S0104	yeah
S0167	what do they do with like all these boys at whatever i dunno
S0104	mm
S0167	but i think it's just a silly outdated idea now
S0104	it be outdated you know you know it should never be buy back unless no i mean even if there be another big huge war i mean it would be a completely different war to any war that's ever be fight before
