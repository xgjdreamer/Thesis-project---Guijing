S0524	throw them out and
S0486	there we go
S0524	see how we go
S0486	well thank you very much for talk to me today
S0524	my pleasure
S0486	and what i'd like to ask you i'm look at your form here be that you be a tv producer and i find that absolutely fascinate could you tell me more about the sort of program you produce
S0524	yes well er well let's go back to the begin since this be gonna take more than a few minutes we could fill it out erm my father be a teacher he be bear and bring up in the south of england he be a teacher of biology at school
S0486	right
S0524	and his interest be apart from biology photography and so i be bring up in a family where my mother be a botanist where we would go for nature walk a lot and er dad would have his camera and bite by bite things brush off on me first of all learn to see things that other people
S0486	yeah
S0524	would walk past they just wouldn't
S0486	mm
S0524	notice erm see detail er one particular memory erm i have be father take me for a walk in woods which be not far from and he stop and he say er do you see that tree over there about fifty yards away i say but of course and he say well you see the trunk and i say but of course i can see the trunk and he say do you see that moth that's on the bark of that trunk and i say you've gotta be joke i mean from fifty yards how do you see a moth anyway he say okay well let's go closer and closer and closer and when you see the moth stop and point it out so we go closer and closer and closer and we get right up to the tree and i haven't see anything and i say there isn't a moth and he say there be so i look and i look and i still see nothing and then he lift his walk stick and he point right up to what i eventually notice be a triangular shape that be only slightly different in colour to the background it be virtually a perfect camouflage match and i think that be absolutely incredible how from fifty yards away could you see such a thing and it be only later that i realise that as a biologist he'd study this woodland for about five years in detail know everything that exist there and where it be and what the habit where and so on and of course these camouflage moths have to be invisible to their predators because they fly at night and in the daytime they've gotta go somewhere and bird come along and they find them so erm he didn't know of course it be there but he have a very good idea that it would be there cos he'd see it there before and so on and so forth and it be experience like that that help me use my eye and of course in that family er background erm my love of nature grow erm he teach me at school er biology at o level and at a level and because of that i have to work hard to make sure i
S0486	yes
S0524	and er he couldn't be see to be favour me so he probably
S0486	mm
S0524	mark me down a bite i wouldn't be at all surprise
S0486	yeah
S0524	so i i find that quite easy so of course i go to university and i do biology there because it be the easiest thing for me and i enjoy it of course
S0486	yeah
S0524	er so at the end of university i have to think okay what be i go to do because until then i be just enjoy life and i decide because of er er of the influence my father have on on photography on my photography that i would go to erm polytechnic to study a photography three year course which also have a specialism in film now my father have experiment with film er again when i be a teenager his his subject be badger and his interest be to film them because people didn't know much about them the only problem be of course they only come out at night
S0486	mm
S0524	when it's dark
S0486	uhu
S0524	they have amaze sense of hear and of smell so you've get lot of problems to solve anyway he solve all those and er result film appear on the bbc in bristol er introduce by peter scott and er he use to do a number of radio program as well er nature parliament and country question answer question
S0486	yes
S0524	that the public have send in and so on and so forth and i would go up with him sometimes just to sort of see what it be all about
S0486	mm
S0524	so i be i be interest in that and anyway have go through the university and have go through this erm er course in london at polytechnic er i be face with the obvious question of okay now be you go to be a perpetual student or be you actually go to get a job and i be look at advert and i saw erm an advert from the bbc and i think oh this look interest this be erm to come in as a production assistant to work on educational program for school erm base in london and i think oh this would be interest erm only of course i know nothing about the electronic studio side of production
S0486	uhu
S0524	only have have an introduction into film work anyway i go for the interview and erm before i hear the result the follow week because these advert appear i think it be in the telegraph erm every wednesday or something so i i i be look and then i saw this advert for the bbc to work as a production assistant in bristol to work on natural history program and i think well i know much more about this than i do about the
S0486	how amaze
S0524	the london thing
S0486	yeah
S0524	so i'll go in for this this'll
S0486	mm
S0524	be interest so i be interview for that and er to my great surprise erm i get a letter from er the school television department in london to say erm er we we can't offer you this job of production assistant level er because of your lack of experience but we would like to offer you a job as a researcher again with school program
S0486	mm
S0524	er on a variety of subject and so on and a few days later i get a a letter from the bbc in bristol er that say er you know er thank you for come for interview etcetera etcetera etcetera erm er we er we don't think er you have enough experience to come in at production assistant level but we would like to offer you the job as a researcher on natural history program in bristol
S0486	yes
S0524	and i remember that the salary be er twelve hundred and twelve hundred and seventy five pound or something and er in london it be thirteen hundred and something because of the london weight etcetera etcetera but basically
S0486	mm
S0524	it be the same so i i have the privilege of this this problem
S0486	yeah
S0524	if you like and i decide that well the bristol one i know much more about but really what would be really excite for me would be to learn about studio production so i accept the london job
S0486	right
S0524	and so i go to the bbc in london and for thirteen years i learn the craft of erm television production direct produce erm go from researcher to production assistant to assistant producer to producer to executive producer and and work with erm fast turnover program short program with low budget
S0486	right
S0524	you get a huge amount of experience in a relatively short period of time and i be er very lucky to have do er studio productions erm record as live on a whole variety of subject
S0486	mm
S0524	which include biology erm but all kinds of other things er general study which in those days be erm anything think to be important that wasn't on a syllabus and so that be you know
S0486	uhu
S0524	sex and drug and religion and religion and politics
S0486	mm
S0524	and and all kinds of wonderful things
S0486	mm
S0524	but eventually i have to think well this be all very good all very fascinate but isn't it perhaps time i sort of specialise in something erm and the one thing that frustrate me with erm school television be the size of the budget and the length of the programme erm i want to do something that be a bite more ambitious and erm a bigger budget like fifty minute program and i think well really i'm now ready to do some natural history program but bring to an outer history unit in bristol some wider experience than
S0486	yes
S0524	most of the people there have so that probably i would have a chance when when a a job come up and a job do come up and that be to er produce program on a series call the live planet where they be record er be look for people er to join a team for a three year project multimillion pound with david attenborough
S0486	oh right
S0524	erm and i think no i won't get that er but at the same time er there be a job for a producer on erm a long run series call the world about us and i think oh that's more like it er so i go in for that and erm have a long interview and and er er they say could you could you wait outside and so on cos i think i must have be the last candidate and they want to talk and they haul me in and they say erm well we're very impress with the stuff that you've do etcetera etcetera but you haven't do a fifty minute programme before er you haven't er you know write a fifty minute script erm mm we we don't really think erm er we should give you this particular post and then they say but as you may be aware er we're recruit for the new attenborough big attenborough project erm would you like it
S0486	oh that be a bite of a stunner
S0524	and that be extraordinary the reason be erm because david attenborough be there and there be an executive producer with huge experience erm the key structure of the long program be heavily influence by david attenborough himself er this be in the days when these project be very much his project
S0486	right
S0524	whereas now he narrate other people's work and all everyone think they're his as well
S0486	mm
S0524	erm and therefore the element they be in doubt about as far as my experience be concern be basically cover by the experience of the exist team and er other aspects they think i could do er so they offer it to me and i take it erm so i spend the next three years work on that which be fantastic and then what do i do er then i be editor of a series call nature which be live television er with with film record insert er stories in in that er then i be editor of er the natural world very ironic because i wasn't accept to be a producer erm on erm that series which er the previous name but they change it to the natural world but then i be make editor of the entire series
S0486	oh my goodness
S0524	erm but in a funny way er then you're you're still not you're still not write er fifty minute script
S0486	no no
S0524	you're look after er mm mm a rather different kind of project and then finally the job of head of the natural history unit come up and erm i be encourage to go in for it and i look at the candidates and i think god i don't want him to take over and i don't want him to take over
S0486	yeah
S0524	er er and i think mm well i'm not sure i really want it but i don't want to be rule by them and then maybe if i don't go in for it one day i'm gonna curse myself you really should have do that because you only get
S0486	mm
S0524	this opportunity once er so i go in for it and after an awful lot of hum and harring er by other people in charge they decide to give it to me erm so i do that and then i think twenty five years to the day after join the bbc which happen to be on my birthday erm i think well that's the time to leave because i'd sort of do it
S0486	yes
S0524	and i didn't want to step down from be head and then make program again it's also a difficult issue for the new head and and
S0486	it's it's
S0524	so on
S0486	true yeah
S0524	er just get out
S0486	mm
S0524	er enjoy it so i get out and then i join a er a commercial television er production company in london i want to get back to london er call erm the boss say to me er we want to set up a natural history wing from scratch erm we think you could do it would you like to do it and i say yes because this be totally different
S0486	mm
S0524	but involve the same people i'd meet all over the world do natural history and so on erm but it be it be commercial it be a very different thing i be offer a three year er fix contract mean at the end it would end whatever happen erm and my job be to set this up to buy up film from all over the world that either hadn't be use or be get tire and need to be reinvigorate turn into new program and so on and so forth and to commission new stuff and er i do that and they seem to be very please and at the end of it erm er i know that be it because i'd prove to myself that financially it make no sense to originate completely new type of program erm which would cost a lot of money er where there's a risk factor as there always be in natural history film you know things can go wrong and so on and so forth
S0486	yeah
S0524	and if you work for a commercial company you've get to deliver and i prove that you could get highly saleable productions from exist source and and catalogue and library catalogue and so on and so forth build up an immense library for very little money in comparison to do the new stuff erm i know that they know that they prefer that so i go
S0486	uhu
S0524	that be it and then after a number of years of of do consultant work with other broadcasters in place like new zealand and the state i think well i've sort of do it erm i'm only er go round and round and round and the program be get ever less interest to me erm why not get back to my original interest which be photography erm i be able to retire so i do and i'm still do it still do the photography
S0486	oh right
S0524	and the photography be sort of abstract picture take in nature where you've get interest shape or form sculptural shape or form pattern and so on erm but within these abstract you can see erm face or you can see shape that indicate that it's a sort of animal or something of that sort
S0486	yes
S0524	so each each one have that sort of theme to it and the idea be er to have exhibitions of of these picture and get particularly children er preferably families but with children in them to come and for the kid to see these things and to work out what they're look at cos they have so much imagination it's absolutely amaze and therefore to get them interest in go out into into the wilds go out into nature i mean it could be a park it could be garden it doesn't have to be an exotic place and see if they can spot image of face or or of creatures in in in rock in wooden shape in erm form of leave and so on and so forth so it encourage them to go out and and see nature in a slightly different way
S0486	yeah
S0524	and appreciate nature and that's where it go sort of full circle back from where i start and my parent take me out and i get interest in nature and this be sort of my way of encourage youngsters to do
S0486	right
S0524	the same sort of thing
S0486	oh right
S0524	and erm fortunately er the museum here erm get very interest in the idea of an exhibition which er i would hold jointly with my brother er or or one of my brothers the brother who be an artist and sculptor and i'm a photographer so
S0486	right
S0524	we've get and he be of course inspire by nature in his way and he's express it in his way and we're combine this into an exhibition call er which be go to come on in a year's time
S0486	oh right that's exit
S0524	so we we've go we've go the full circle
S0486	yes
S0524	in cos the influence the on me although i be bear in at the age of two i be bring to and er my parent rent a thatch cottage in er
S0486	right
S0524	which be still there
S0486	oh yes
S0524	erm and then move into and he be work of course at the school erm and then when i leave school i go to university and then to the er er photographic course in and then of course i stay in erm then go to and go back to erm my wife die er eight years ago suddenly and i have to reassess things and after a while i i get feed up with london i want to move away from the the flat we have there and so on and think well where do i wanna go and i think well i really ought to go somewhere where i've get connection so that be either but where i leave at the age of two that wasn't really a memory erm the university of be not the warmest place on earth but it's a lovely place
S0486	mm
S0524	although it's change completely as a result of the oil which happen after i leave there erm er which i want to get away from at least for a while or and my my brother have move from his work at and so on he be base in he come to and he seem to like it so i think well and then i find this house and i say oh
S0524	i like this
S0486	yes fantastic
S0524	yeah
S0486	position
S0524	it be a fantastic position and i be lucky have do what i've do that i
S0486	mm
S0524	have a property in so it's sell a property in
S0486	oh yes
S0524	erm you've get enough money to buy it
S0486	yes
S0524	so erm it need a lot of work er cos it be own for at least a decade by erm a couple who be both doctor with teenage children and have teenage children and be very busy people they didn't do an awful lot to keep this place go and it need
S0486	oh
S0524	need help
S0486	yes
S0524	erm but i be very interest er to try that out and and do things and i do and that's now do erm so i'm i'm quite please really it be a nice spot

S0486	yeah
S0524	and that's absolutely right
S0486	yeah
S0524	erm i think that one's fairly obviously but some be more obvious than others as to what they be
S0486	yes exactly well when we're just look at some erm bark and erm see erm pattern and disturbances in the bark that can emulate some other type of erm
S0524	face or
S0486	face yeah and that's really attractive isn't it

S0486	oh yes that's a wonderful profile
S0524	i've do

S0524	erm nature be quite extraordinary now that be the same picture
S0486	yeah
S0524	just turn
S0486	yeah
S0524	and there be a number of examples like that erm where you turn them a different way and suddenly they become something else

S0486	yes
S0524	of a fly bird erm some can but quite a lot of people can't see it at all
S0486	or or it might be

S0486	i'm so glad that i come
S0524	well
S0486	what a wonderful erm what a wonderful interview
S0524	well it be a bite different the erm
S0486	it be
S0524	there's my my interest er be interest in photography erm you think well what kind of photography er and that be if you're interest in in nature try to take erm picture of plant or animals that be anything like as good as what other people have do
S0486	yes
S0524	and in this day and age when if an editor want a picture of a of a blackbird just go on the internet and do all these all all the libraries and be now up in
S0486	mm
S0524	er up in the cloud they can in no time at all get the finest picture ever take of whatever it be
S0486	yes
S0524	they're look for
S0486	yes absolutely
S0524	so what be the point other than the sheer enjoyment of do so erm go to huge lengths to try and take a picture that isn't as good
S0486	absolutely yeah i i
S0524	as other people and have this interest in in in camouflage and detail and and art
S0486	yes
S0524	er my interest be to get picture for the wall
S0486	yeah
S0524	erm it's get to be something else and and that natural interest just develop and develop and develop and i don't think you can do that very quickly
S0486	no
S0524	actually
S0486	no you can't
S0524	and fortunately er not everybody's do that sort of thing so this collection when it come down to maybe thirty five picture which be go to be print this big
S0486	yes
S0524	erm i think will interest people because i've have er two dry run erm two exhibitions in france we we use to have a house down in the south and it's because of those that i want to take it further because
S0486	mm
S0524	we would contact school and the teachers would bring the children and er the children i'm talk about age around about sort of of eleven no the eight up through to about fourteen the interest period
S0486	yes yes yes
S0524	er they would come and the and and teachers would say okay erm go around quietly look at things and decide which erm half a dozen of these picture er you particularly like
S0486	yes
S0524	write these down and erm tell the rest of us why you like them and what you see in them and they be see things that of course i hadn't get a clue about at all
S0486	no
S0524	and their imagination come out and their interest erm and the extraordinary thing be er to me that they they would come in the week and then at the weekend some of them would drag their parent back
S0486	yeah
S0524	to see it and the kid would sort of curate the show they'd say mummy or mummy you've get to see this
S0524	now what do you see in this and
S0524	all this kind of thing and it be amaze er and a few of the parent erm afterwards would say erm this be amaze er the the the child or the children have suddenly get this interest and want to take us out for walk
S0486	yes
S0524	erm so that they can find things
S0486	thing yes
S0524	and erm they'd get their little mobile phone and so on and er if if they do see something do you think they could email it to you i say but of course er in the end not many people do but a few do er and you saw these picture and you you could see what they be what they be drive at what
S0486	yes
S0524	they be find
S0486	yes
S0524	erm and i think that be fantastic
S0486	yeah
S0524	really do
S0486	it be good it be good when it erm sort of free people's imagination i i find a root once a break root which look like a leg and a hip erm and there be a part of a torso to it it be when i be in the first year at erm university
S0524	mm
S0486	and erm i i take it home and i make a clay shoe to go on it a red clay stiletto heel
S0524	mm
S0486	er which i er bake in the oven it be one of those
S0524	right
S0486	hobby craft clay things
S0524	yeah
S0486	and i stick it on the end and i put the thing on a back and i hang it in an exhibition in the conference room
S0524	mm
S0486	and the principal buy it
S0524	very good well do well do that's
S0486	and everyone be say to me how much
S0524	mm mm
S0486	do you want to put on this the principal's ask how much it be
S0524	er yeah yeah
S0486	and i think well you know when i think how how much it take me how quick it be to make cos it be a find object
S0524	yeah
S0486	but then i'd embellish it
S0524	yeah
S0486	but then art today be all about the find object and you be actually
S0524	mm mm mm
S0486	use the find object in your photography
S0524	they're all find object yeah
S0486	which be fantastic
S0524	yeah
S0486	erm anyway you know i ask for what i think be a reasonable sum
S0524	mm
S0486	erm but erm yes i mean a lot of unknown artists ask far too much for their work and erm
S0524	mm mm
S0486	it be the first thing i sell erm while i be a student
S0524	mm
S0486	but i've sell a lot more now and a lot of my work be i have a lot of photograph
S0524	mm
S0486	erm in my dentist's she's get them on permanent display erm
S0524	yeah
S0486	they're all rather weird erm
S0524	yeah
S0486	it's down near erm down that side of town
S0524	mm
S0486	erm and she's have them er for erm what two or three years now
S0524	right right
S0486	erm and every time i go in i i don't know if you get this with yours i go in in and i see work on the wall and i it's almost like i it i don't own it anymore it's nothing to do with me
S0524	yeah yeah
S0486	it's like a time have elapse and i've go on and i've be do other things now and it i
S0524	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0486	pass
S0524	yeah
S0486	pass by but erm yes it it it be erm yeah it do the art degree at the age of erm fifty eight i do the art degree fifty eight fifty nine
S0524	mm
S0486	erm it be very late to do it but
S0524	mm mm
S0486	i'm really glad i do it
S0524	mm
S0486	because i i've experiment with so much and erm
S0524	yeah
S0486	i've go back to paint a bite at the moment erm
S0524	mm
S0486	but i'm i don't i like experiment i just couldn't say well this be the way i paint or this be the way i do this and i'm always gonna do it like this i've gotta
S0524	mm
S0486	keep diversify
S0524	mm
S0486	to keep myself interest really
S0524	yeah yeah yeah
S0486	but then it confuse people so they can't identify with you so
S0524	well it depend how abstract you go erm well right here if you
S0486	mm
S0524	look at that the two things be connect it it's
S0486	oh yes
S0524	it's my brother's work
S0486	oh be it this
S0524	yeah
S0486	here oh it's
S0524	yeah
S0486	lovely i i have be
S0524	and
S0486	look at it actually
S0524	erm and without any explanation at all all you can sort of think of be well the sculpture's quite nice cos it it it's a shape and it look a bite like a bird or or whatever
S0486	yeah
S0524	but that's about as far as you go you won't think it's connect to the one at the back because why would you and so on and so on and so on
S0486	mm
S0524	erm but in fact it it's it's mean to be a piece erm about our ancestry
S0486	right
S0524	because my mother's father's parent or maybe they be grandparents er be move out during the clearances in in
S0486	right
S0524	in western scotland and that be a a a a fairly tragic time and my brother go up to see if he could track down the the the cottage and eventually he could and he track down the graveyard and he find a tombstone and so on and so forth and he want to do something that relate to that sort of erm er brutal time of their erm be turf off their land and so on and so forth so when he go and he'd find the the area he saw that the land now be cover in gorse and he think mm gorse and er know a bite about gorse well they've get these
S0486	oh i see it now
S0524	dry pod
S0486	yes yes
S0524	which twist when they dry out
S0486	yes
S0524	and then they explode
S0486	right
S0524	they be distribute
S0486	yeah
S0524	they they're move and he think well we could do something about gorse and erm he also go to a museum of agricultural implement which show the kind of plough that be use in those days
S0486	yeah
S0524	which similar to elsewhere as well and nothing er very specific to to scotland erm but er he he be by er train an engineer er he be interest in erm the front of the plough with the sock and the coulter
S0486	yes
S0524	erm where this represent erm i can't remember which way round it be now if that's the sock it's what turn the soil
S0486	yeah
S0524	soil over and this be the coulter
S0486	right
S0524	or it's the other way round that do the
S0486	right
S0524	actual plough
S0486	yeah
S0524	so the two piece dig and turn erm and then look at the erm at the the gorse pod itself when it twist it's a bite like that that that's the open
S0486	yeah
S0524	the open pod and the the seed come up erm and this of course be gorse he take a photograph
S0486	yes
S0524	and it's quite accurate but of course he's tone down the yellow
S0486	yes
S0524	erm here be a representation of the the the what be leave of the cottage which be just a pile of stone
S0486	yeah
S0524	er this indicate age because on the tombstones the this be the lichen that
S0486	yeah
S0524	slowly grow out lichen that slowly grow out and this be an impression of the sock and coulter which be traditional in that part of the world that that put on the gravestones so
S0486	oh i see
S0524	so the
S0486	yeah
S0524	that's that and that be a timer like an egg timer
S0486	right
S0524	that give the passage of time etcetera
S0486	right
S0524	etcetera etcetera and put the two together i think it's actually a bite close but erm er it tell the story
S0486	yes
S0524	of that period of our family history well to us know that that's very interest
S0486	yeah
S0524	but to other people it's you either like it or you don't
S0486	well
S0524	type of thing
S0486	i think it's wonderful i've be
S0524	er
S0486	fascinate by it while you've be talk and it's very please to the eye the other thing that i would say about that because you're always for look for more mean in things
