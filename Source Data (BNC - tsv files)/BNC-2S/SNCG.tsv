S0618	mm
S0619	erm er oh you know it be very nice with lot of people there but just sort of a bite date a bite old fashion and i think oh well maybe you know someone's give them load of furniture and then at about ten o'clock 's mum come home er and be sort of tidy around everybody er
S0618	as mums do yep
S0619	as mums do and i didn't realise that they live with her
S0618	ah right
S0619	yeah still er and i suppose you know they're save for their own house
S0618	yeah
S0619	but i don't know if you agree with me that if i be marry or if i be in a er relationship i would rather blow the money on rent every week
S0618	live in a shoebox
S0619	er
S0618	or a garage or a shed
S0619	than live with my parent
S0618	yeah
S0619	with my
S0618	i agree
S0619	you know with my partner i think you know it's awful blow all that money when you're try to save for a house but
S0618	yeah
S0619	i be marry and live at home
S0618	it seem a little bite different here and in germany in that people tend to build their own house
S0619	mm
S0618	erm or buy a house you know pretty much outright they don't bother with mortgage
S0619	mm
S0618	and in the meantime they rent or more likely in poland yeah they live with their parent
S0619	yeah
S0618	i've get german friends that erm actually i haven't get any german friends who live with their parent now they all rent but then rent be fairly cheap and the market be make it very easy for
S0619	uhu
S0618	for people to rent and there be lot and lot of legal protections which maybe don't exist in the rental market in poland i don't know
S0619	mm i don't
S0618	a lot of folks live at home er you know even single folks in poland seem to live at home in their
S0619	yeah
S0618	thirties forties
S0619	yeah
S0618	mm
S0619	live live at home from monday to thursday with his mum and she you know make all his meals for him and all of this stuff
S0618	yeah how old's he he's gotta be forty
S0619	thirty two
S0618	be that oh be he really that young
S0619	yeah
S0618	god yeah okay
S0619	er and then he do have his own place but it's in which be like i dunno forty minutes drive
S0618	yeah
S0619	so he can there at the weekend erm i don't know
S0618	yeah i suppose it's just a you know a cultural difference
S0619	cultural difference yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	if you live on your own i think it's okay but i mean if you're single i think it's okay but if you're marry i just
S0618	yeah i know
S0619	i remember say to a student last year a little boy in conversation club how many people live in your house and he be like nine people i be like er what who
S0618	oh my goodness
S0619	and it's you know him and his brother and his mum and dad and their mum and dad and his cousins and his auntie and uncle
S0618	wow
S0619	you know and er i imagine it's a very big house but
S0618	mm that's a bite like ireland maybe a couple of generations ago
S0619	mm
S0618	and scotland actually i don't know about england probably not
S0619	mm i don't think the house be big enough
S0618	no but even in i'm think about erm my father in law who's eighty three grow up in scotland and about ninety seven of them live in a two up two down
S0619	yeah yeah
S0618	erm and likewise with my mother in law who's eighty eight something like that eighty seven eighty eight erm she live in and there be a million of them as well so i dunno and be that yeah dunno i be just try to relate it to religion potentially where you have load of children cos you don't have contraception but erm i dunno
S0619	mm
S0618	i suppose that's not so applicable these days
S0619	no i don't know i think it's just a way to save money here sort of thing and
S0618	mm
S0619	you know they're very family orient more than in england
S0618	yeah that's true
S0619	i always feel weird say that like you know in england people don't care about their family
S0618	it's different
S0619	but it's just a different relationship isn't it
S0618	yes
S0619	a stronger relationship
S0618	i never hug my family i didn't realise that's what people do
S0619	mm
S0618	and then i suppose really it be be marry and hug all the in laws and think why don't i hug my own family
S0619	yeah
S0618	and then i start hug them which i think they be a bite shock by initially but
S0619	ah
S0618	they seem to have warm up to it so now they just sort of expect a hug and they get one yeah be overtake by a big lorry
S0619	how embarrass
S0618	i know i let him overtake cos it take me a while to get up to speed i suppose i'm a bite wary of the sound quality as well we might need to
S0619	yeah that's true
S0618	speak up a bite for our record
S0619	isn't it strange build a motorway but with only two lanes
S0618	yeah i remember when the a14 be build in although back in the day it be the a45 and that get to three lanes in bits but be mostly two lanes and that's the main route from the dock erm at
S0619	mm
S0618	right through to erm go up to way and join the a1 or along to join the m6 and then on to scotland so it be a major motorway
S0619	yeah two lanes
S0618	a major yeah huge and it be two lanes and i remember my dad tell me cos i be a kid when it be build but my dad tell me that there be all of these study at the time about erm the volume of traffic and what be anticipate in the come decades and they didn't really have a clue so
S0619	mm yeah they must've just
S0618	yeah they do more work on it now but er
S0618	put three lanes in at some of the peak place
S0619	yeah er load of the motorways around be all fifty miles an hour limit
S0618	wow
S0619	to cos it get really really congest erm so it make the the flow of the traffic better
S0618	yeah
S0619	cos people aren't you know be silly people aren't brake or whatever or

S0618	well the beer's cheap so
S0619	yep you know and what's the difference between polish young people and english young people they didn't have a lot of positive things to say
S0619	er and then one of them start go oh there's too many muslims in and i be like
S0618	oh for fuck's sake
S0619	i be like i be not talk to you any more
S0618	yeah
S0619	goodbye and i just like it really get to me because i be think the muslims who live in be british
S0618	i know
S0619	british people with british passports i be like
S0618	yeah
S0619	you're the immigrant
S0618	yeah
S0619	you're the person who shouldn't be there if no one er you know if someone's not suppose to be there it's you
S0618	how do they respond to that
S0619	i didn't say that i just go
S0618	oh you maybe should've do for god's sake
S0619	i know and one of them be like
S0618	there seem to be so much
S0619	what do you think about it all of these people in england and i be like but they're they're english
S0618	jeez even if they're not english what's the problem
S0619	yeah i don't know where they get this racism from
S0618	i think yeah
S0618	it's all base on fear this whole austerity story to my mind be a complete fabrication to divide and conquer it's to set humanity against humanity
S0619	yeah
S0618	so cameron and pal go along fleece people of all their money and power and all the rest of it and meanwhile poor people be fight poor people it's all bollocks
S0619	yeah
S0618	but anyway they've obviously swallow a story so
S0619	yeah but they're tell you know in the news that these people be bad and they hate them
S0618	yeah
S0619	even though especially polish people in poland have never meet anyone who's not white
S0618	i know
S0619	it just it blow my sock off
S0618	yeah or maybe never meet someone who's not christian or or
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm
S0618	i know i think if people form their opinions of other people on how they actually find other people through their own direct experience
S0619	yeah
S0618	then in my experience of human be be that we all want to love and be love we all want the best for our family
S0619	yeah
S0618	we all want to have enough of everything and we generally do
S0619	yep
S0618	you know i work at charitable organisations where people be live in extreme poverty and so it do exist it do exist in
S0619	uhu
S0618	in well it exist everywhere but you know it's not really a case of give to one part of a population who you divide accord to religion or skin colour or whatever you're deprive other people you're not it's bollocks
S0619	yeah
S0618	so anyway anyway i'm preach to the convert with you i know so
S0619	i just think it be it's just a strange thing to say
S0618	yeah
S0619	this you know this man who and they must have pretty miserable live in england you know they work long hours in a meat factory
S0618	yeah
S0619	and i just think you know i know that you don't want to be there and you know want to come and live you know live in poland with your family and with your friends and you be only do it for the money but er i be talk to about this yesterday i think this this polish thing about erm the future and save for the future and
S0618	yeah
S0619	the things that you're gonna do in the future even if it mean that you're fuck miserable while you're do it
S0618	yeah i know but not for a decade or two i know
S0619	and it's why
S0618	yeah
S0619	like what's the point
S0618	i know
S0619	i'd rather be i'd rather sort of anticipate have a disappoint future if what i'm do at the moment be be make me happy
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	i dunno
S0618	i don't know i think i've change a lot erm end of the nineties my mum get a terminal cancer diagnosis and be around her and watch how she live her life really influence me i think and i live very much
S0619	yeah
S0618	in the moment now
S0619	yeah
S0618	then when my partner get terminal cancer diagnosis you know just kind of reinforce that when everybody you love be be you know give a death sentence
S0619	yeah
S0618	well we've all get a death sentence from the moment we're bear really
S0619	yeah
S0618	but if if
S0619	time yeah
S0618	you know if you know it's gonna be kind of sooner rather than later then
S0619	yeah mm
S0618	i do think it change how you perceive reality and your priorities mm yeah
S0619	i have erm a question from my students we be talk ambition and bucket list and dream and this kind of thing and the first question be be life bore
S0618	oh
S0619	er and i think it's er there's two answer obviously which be yes and no in some ways
S0618	mm no there's a third one but anyway
S0619	okay oh well to say
S0618	just be awkward
S0619	yeah well tell me in a minute and i think in some ways it be you know you're wake up at the same time eat the same breakfast and go to work er or if you're a student you're go to school every day and it can be very bore erm and at the same time of course it's not bore there's so many excite things for you to do er and you can make life interest and you can meet new people and laugh at joke and tell stories and all of these things make life interest
S0618	yeah
S0619	so i don't know what's your third
S0618	that life be neither bore nor not bore life in and of itself just be
S0619	yeah
S0618	and it's only a human perception
S0619	it's not really answer the question
S0618	well it be and i think it's a really important answer to the question it's like you know technically speak
S0619	yeah
S0618	there be no good or and there be no evil there be only perceptions of how you feel about certain events so
S0619	yeah
S0618	really if you take humans and er our own subjective perceptions out of the equation it neither be or isn't you know it's not good or evil it's not bore or not bore it's just it be as it be but yeah i've be bore lately and i think now i've recognise that i'm take step to remedy that
S0619	yeah
S0618	and i i do think we have as humans this build in kind of indicator i mean we have this whole rainbow of emotions this whole spectrum but it all boil down to do it feel good or not and you've strike upon this before and if it doesn't well what need to change
S0619	yeah
S0618	and if it do then great do more of that and so yeah boredom be just one aspect of that
S0619	mm
S0618	doesn't feel so great so yeah
S0619	yes
S0618	so how be yesterday do you want to talk about or not
S0618	no
S0619	no i do but i might cry
S0618	oh okay
S0619	er
S0618	would you rather not cry while be record or
S0619	i'm not bother
S0618	okay fair enough
S0619	er i just sort of you know say it's all or nothing thank you
S0619	erm which be you know it's a thing this relationship or it's nothing you can't keep phone me every night er to tell me about your day like that's gonna have to stop
S0618	yeah
S0619	er so he say nothing
S0618	he say nothing he didn't have a view or
S0619	no no his answer be er in the question all or nothing he choose nothing
S0618	oh in the question he choose nothing
S0619	he didn't sort of sit in in silence for the rest of the
S0618	oh okay
S0619	i'm gonna take a vow of silence until you leave
S0618	just talk amongst yourself yeah
S0618	okay
S0619	er so
S0618	wow
S0619	but
S0618	well i suppose if
S0619	i think it's the better outcome it's the er saddest right now but
S0618	yeah
S0619	next week it'll feel even better
S0618	yeah no that's cool i think it's good to have you know to know where you're at really
S0619	well yeah exactly now i know where i stand and i can
S0618	yeah
S0619	make my choices and make my decisions er
S0618	yeah
S0619	base on that so it's good it's good good
S0618	good yeah i'm kind of relieve in a way from a selfish viewpoint i mean you know your relationship or not with be none of my business but i don't like the guy
S0619	yeah i
S0618	and i didn't say that to you in so many word before you go to cos i i don't know that you'd be
S0619	yeah
S0618	sway by my view anyway i don't
S0619	no and say the same thing but
S0618	no i don't like the guy
S0619	uhu
S0618	he's er i dunno there's a vibe that just doesn't sit right with me
S0619	yeah
S0618	so yeah but no so interest oh crumb so
S0619	no no it's fine now like
S0618	yeah
S0619	it be what it be
S0618	yeah exactly it be what it be and i suppose with anything that come to an end there's a you know process to go through so

S0618	oh yeah
S0619	for sure er if not
S0618	okay
S0619	forever
S0619	i really don't think it's for me
S0618	yeah
S0619	er and you know at the party they be all like don't do it don't extend it and i just think why it's nothing to do with you
S0618	exactly
S0618	why do people need for you to have some alcohol
S0619	yeah it's like you say it say more about the other person i think
S0618	it do yeah i've get
S0619	it's like go you're really bore if you're sober so you need to drink er cos you're not interest enough
S0618	yeah thank mate
S0619	or it's say erm i need you to drink to sort of erm
S0618	feel better about my drink
S0619	yeah to sort of
S0618	yeah
S0619	what's the word not validate it or you know say that it's okay
S0618	yeah
S0619	but if someone's not drink i think there's some you know something quite erm er some erm what's the word fuck hell er you know you're a bite more sort of moral or you know
S0618	oh okay
S0619	there's even if you don't show this it's not come across in your eye you know people
S0618	yeah
S0619	will always think
S0618	there be some experiment could be do here we could have some fun with this
S0618	well we could try different reason for not drink
S0619	yes
S0618	and see
S0619	see which be more or less offensive
S0618	yeah what's more acceptable
S0619	i think say dry january be very acceptable
S0618	yeah
S0619	cos people know it and it's a thing that people do
S0618	yeah and sober october
S0619	yeah
S0618	people do but to say oh no you know i'm just not drink cos i choose not to doesn't seem to be acceptable
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah
S0618	so i wonder if i'm part of a twelve step programme
S0619	yeah
S0618	whether people there people will immediately back off and not push the issue
S0619	yeah
S0618	won't spike your drink and will offer you lot of juice
S0619	help and support yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	yes
S0618	so
S0619	well i start drink wine at eight in the morning so i decide i best stop
S0619	i'm okay
S0618	yeah
S0619	but it all er you know things like oh for health or for weight
S0618	yeah
S0619	people don't like that

S0619	i only drink if i don't have to pay for it
S0618	yeah what about it's against my religious principles do you think that would be
S0619	well what religion
S0618	i i don't know

S0618	muslim hey you would and that's
S0618	yeah try that in poland i'm sorry
S0619	sorry
S0618	but as a muslim woman
S0618	that's magnificent i think we should try that
S0619	i think i'd have to sort of er adapt to a few other things otherwise they might think i'm lie
S0619	i don't know
S0618	oh dear
S0619	i'd have to stop eat bacon i don't eat that much bacon anyway yes
S0618	yeah

S0619	something's rattle oh it might be bits of ice cube or
S0618	yeah i be kind of hop it be all the snow come off the roof cos it's be on there for a month like

S0618	so whoop sorry
S0619	the final destination film that be a weird noise though isn't it
S0618	yeah sound a bite liquidy anyway hope it's okay won't panic

S0618	and people'd come in and go oh isn't it an awful day and i want to say the day in of itself be neither awful nor not awful it all depend on your perception

S0619	i didn't think i have it or do i
S0618	i think you tell me you have a little snifter before the party so you could breathe and
S0619	maybe i be maybe i be think about it
S0619	but i don't think i do you know
S0618	no good for you
S0619	i don't think i do i've just be hammer this other prescribe thing
S0618	uhu
S0619	erm
S0618	be that the nasal flush thing
S0619	no no no this be it's like a steroid thing from the doctor that i've have for a while
S0618	yeah
S0619	but it it's not it's it it's one of those things where you don't sense the relief as much as with this thing that i'm addict to
S0618	okay
S0619	there be no sense of relief but it's you know more long term or long last or it's do it sort of behind the scenes so it's not a quick release
S0618	yeah
S0619	er
S0618	so once it's take a week or so to get in your system will you feel more relief
S0619	hopefully yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	er and with this flush thing it's not it's not quite right what i want be a thing which you just really spray this stream of water up one nostril and then the water come out of the other
S0618	oh lovely
S0619	er and it's with it it take all of the insides of your nose
S0618	okay
S0619	erm it really clear you out but what i've get isn't that but it's not bad er but i'm definitely gonna take the medication tonight and tomorrow night just because i don't wanna be keep people awake and i'm
S0618	oh i forget my earplugs okay
S0619	really erm struggle with sleep
S0618	be you
S0619	erm yeah i be up at half four and i don't think i go back to sleep then cos my alarm go off at half seven i be just toss and turn
S0618	there be a school of think that suggest that humans only really need four to six hours in any one block
S0619	yeah but i you know i know my body and i know that i need eight hours
S0618	mm do you need it in one block
S0619	yeah
S0618	oh okay
S0619	and that's for sort of optimum me during the week when i'm work it just drop to about seven
S0618	mm
S0619	and
S0618	my optimum where i feel fantastic be five or six you know from midnight
S0619	yeah
S0618	and then another hour or two from about five in the even
S0619	yeah
S0618	and i feel fabulous on that but at the moment i don't have enough to do and to keep me amuse and entertain within the day
S0619	yeah
S0618	to warrant so many wake hours so i'm indulge in sleep reality which from have fantastic dream i've be really enjoy so
S0619	yeah
S0618	i'm not gonna change at the moment i imagine when i'm farm i will slip back into a four to six hours and then an hour or two in the even
S0619	i can't nap i can't sleep during the day er i've never be able to on bus on train on flight
S0618	mm
S0619	it's torture
S0618	yeah
S0619	in many ways like my dad can fall asleep within three minutes like
S0618	wow
S0619	on the sofa when he get home from work
S0618	yeah
S0619	i can't do that
S0618	i can love it
S0619	mm my mum's the same as me she just you know awake in the morning
S0618	mm
S0619	you know that's it
S0618	yeah
S0619	no
S0618	i become an accomplish napper when i first get my mortgage
S0619	uhu
S0618	which be probably about fifteen years ago now and couldn't afford it as nobody could with mortgage back in the day and so i work seven days a week and sometimes fifteen hours a day
S0619	yeah
S0618	but there be a gap where i finish work at three in the afternoon and start again seven in the even so i have to drive home which be about half an hour and then i'd have something to eat and then i would nap and then i'd get up and wash and then go to work in the even till eleven or midnight or whatever and that nap between job be just so important
S0619	yeah
S0618	it really be crucial to not kill myself drive and get enough with hindsight i suppose i look back and i think what a nut job work so bloody hard why do i do that that be just crazy but hey you know do be do and that's the person i be back then so
S0619	yeah
S0618	i don't regret it it just be as it be
S0619	yeah erm you know i don't think i will ever be that person i don't have that characteristic or whatever er er er er to work hard or to work really long hours
S0618	mm
S0619	or to do more than be absolutely necessary
S0619	i think we've talk about this before
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah but it's not for me and i think that's something that you get from your parent and their attitude to work which be my dad do the bare minimum
S0618	yeah
S0619	and my mum do so much that she you know drive herself mad
S0618	mm
S0619	and make herself quite unwell so
S0618	yeah it's not good
S0619	so i've sort of learn from both of them i guess do do do do do
S0618	i know i have to turn simon down erm because he be play some music but i suppose now we're on the motorway i could
S0619	no just
S0619	we'll get there at half one cos that's that can't be right
S0618	yeah well if we do we'll find a coffee shop
S0619	yeah
S0618	erm i don't think we'll be soon because once we get on the seven which be south

S0618	yeah
S0619	it's funny isn't it how the way that you see yourself be be different to how other people see you
S0618	yeah
S0619	and it's not it's not a sort of a negative thing a lot of the time it can be quite interest when say i be attention seek and self destructive
S0619	i think about that for about well i still think about it
S0618	oh my goodness
S0619	be i be i though
S0618	do i detect a little mirror reflect back at him there
S0619	yeah and i think goodness
S0618	yeah
S0619	i just don't think i'm either of those things
S0618	if i have to say do who do that apply to all the more you or
S0618	i would say by a country mile
S0618	i think he's see in you what be more apparent in himself
S0619	yeah and i sort of you know it we be drink and we be argue
S0618	mm
S0619	er i mean i wasn't argue i wasn't say anything at all he we just sort of shout at me er

S0619	so he be argue i sit and just sort of star at the wall er and then someone be like right out of there
S0618	yeah
S0619	out er yeah and i be really upset and i really think about it all over christmas this be in december and i spend all of christmas think how be i self destructive i just don't think i be
S0618	yeah i suppose if somebody say something like that to you that be really quite a strike comment
S0619	yeah
S0618	then yeah you owe it yourself to look at that
S0619	mm
S0618	and turn it over in your mind run through your emotions
S0619	yeah
S0618	and if it doesn't resonate with you as truth then reject it
S0619	yeah
S0618	cos your truth be the only one that matter somebody else's be their subjective idea of you it's not real
S0619	true yes
S0618	so bollocks fuck off
S0619	bollocks to that
S0618	yeah
S0619	you know attention seek possibly but self destructive i don't think so

S0619	yeah
S0618	but i would say he's attention seek
S0619	it's sort of the way that he act and you know the way he present himself to the world

S0619	say i want people to notice me
S0618	yeah and to like me

S0618	yeah that part of the world really do not appeal to me
S0619	do it not
S0618	no the whole sort of jerusalem bethlehem thing do and then
S0619	mm
S0618	sort of georgia and around there the poorer nations do
S0619	yeah i'd like to israel
S0618	but yeah i've be to israel it's pretty cool but this whole affluence thing that's
S0619	yeah
S0618	i dunno it's just like how man fuck nature basically you know build this well build build in the middle of the desert
S0619	yeah
S0618	it just seem so artificial
S0619	yeah
S0618	and so abhorrent
S0619	erm
S0618	okay speed camera what be the speed limit er
S0619	seventy
S0618	speed of the car in front that's point the other way anyway erm
S0619	what be i gonna say i know load of people who live in dubai load of friends er teachers and er people who work for emirates airlines
S0618	mm
S0619	er and i know my cousin live in erm with his friend er and my auntie and uncle go to visit him
S0618	mm
S0619	and it just sound the most ridiculous place er it's like you know you talk about culture shock but this be something else
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm and the amount of money and how expensive things be they be take him like uncle ben's rice cos otherwise if you buy it there it's like ten pound a packet
S0618	what jeez
S0618	okay it's not on the bucket list
S0619	er you know and i've teach kid from saudi arabia kid from dubai kid from all of that area and the girls be great but the boys be just awful
S0618	arrogant arses
S0619	they er they be ten years old and they think they own the world

S0618	wow
S0619	and then from there he learn to dress himself
S0618	very good yeah no i have a friend whose husband work in and live there and it sound like the worth or value that other people give you base on your bank balance
S0619	mm
S0618	and your parents' economic affluence
S0619	yeah
S0618	and i find that also abhorrent
S0619	mm
