S0136	have you have a good weekend
S0065	i do yeah i take my children to forest on sunday the weather be okay so we get in the car and drive to and it be really nice
S0136	oh brilliant so anything else special because it be it be mother's day wasn't it
S0065	oh yeah it be mother's day yeah my husband cook he spend all weekend cook which be suppose to be nice for me but it mean that i do most of the childcare and so that be nice and the girls have buy flower well you know pretend to buy flower
S0136	aw
S0065	and stuff so that be lovely we just
S0136	yeah
S0065	we just spend the day together you know it be kind of treat because my husband's away quite a lot so what about you
S0136	well you know it be okay sunday be good because basically take away on a bike so i have like some extra sleep really and that be nice
S0065	oh lovely yeah
S0136	yeah he's too little really to do anything else he make me a card at playgroup but that's about all
S0065	yeah have make some funny craft at her school which she be really thrill with but then she em she give them to me on friday after school and she get so excite that she be open them to show me so she completely miss the point of the gift be for sunday
S0136	which school be that
S0065	it's the one in in
S0136	oh right yeah
S0065	it's just the mornings it's just morning school so nine till one
S0136	that's the same thing as they have in lode you know where i live so they have a inspire kind of preschool thing and i think yeah i think it's mornings only as well i'd love to eh you know when my son be a bite older i'd like him to go there
S0065	yeah i think it's good
S0136	yeah do they do anything special there anything different
S0065	well i don't really know because i don't pick her up i i only see her at four o'clock so when i get her she's usually forget what she's do but when i have visit the impression i get be that it's much more child lead so they do what they like they're not go from activity to activity as define by the teachers you know if they want to do water play all morning they can if they want to play with wooden block all morning they can so it's very much just sort of pupil more child lead which i like about it
S0136	oh brilliant
S0065	cos she's only three if she want to play all morning then let her you know that's fine but they do push them a bite more than the other the preschool to you know if they're interest in number and letter then they'll let them have a go whereas i think the other preschool in the village try not to do the stuff that they'll be do in school
S0136	yeah that sound good i kind of put him on the wait list for that lode one and maybe you know i mean you know hopefully by the time he's old enough to go i should be enough space for those people who want to go really
S0065	yeah what i like be that em it's smaller so you know there be more staff to children and it's just a bite calmer cos be ever so well she's very mm maybe not highly string but high maintenance
S0136	oh right
S0065	she's quite demand so i think be in a calm environment help her you know deal with things
S0136	well my son actually em i have to take him to the doctor this morning em cos last night he didn't sleep at all because you know he have some sort of rash or something so he spend half the night scratch himself whether it's chicken pox or
S0065	it's not chicken pox be it
S0136	i'm not quite sure actually because it's like you know the doctor say it wasn't but we have to go from like one person to another person because they weren't sure and then they give us like a whole bag of cream and things you know to put on him but he be absolutely fine this morning he be just play there and just you know have fun really you know wouldn't wouldn't tell that he wasn't sleep all day whereas in the morning i be like ha ha i want to sleep
S0065	oh it's horrible
S0136	yeah
S0065	chicken pox be go around my girls haven't have it yet but they don't seem to get anything
S0136	ah lucky you
S0065	so can he go to childcare today
S0136	well he didn't go my mother in law have him today because they move recently they move to the area recently and so you know we'll see tomorrow anyway
S0065	yeah
S0136	he normally go to a child minder three days a week and to grandparents two days a week so
S0065	do you sort out your child minder problem cos you be look for someone weren't you
S0136	yeah yeah she be she be okay cos she have to have an operation and then it turn out that i have to have an operation as well because i just have to have emergency surgery with appendicitis and then eh you know he be actually look after by my mum for a bite and then you know after that he be you know the child minder be fine again you know she's okay now
S0065	okay so you're still use the same person
S0136	yeah well it's kind of handy cos she's only opposite the school literally you know live opposite the college
S0065	yeah perfect
S0136	yeah no it's pretty good yeah
S0065	mine's not far she's just round the corner from me in but me you know it's just l i try and get there at four o'clock but every night it's five past four ten past four five past four it's really hard there's just so much go on at school that leave on time be really difficult
S0136	how's your day be today
S0065	eh it's be good cos today be an easy day for me i only teach two lessons so i have three free to get load of work do usually i'm take for a couple but today i wasn't but my day start badly because have a tantrum at the child minders because when we get out of the car she'd lose her bracelet she be wear a little pink you know silly little jewellery thing and she just go mad completely mad and i have to actually call school to say i may not be in on time because she run up the road and you know i have to go chase after her i've get the one year old in the car and the school bag
S0136	do you find it in the end or not
S0065	no no i give her a packet of crisp and that seem to em fix the problem
S0136	oh yeah it be the same thing today at the doctor as well you know a packet of crisp
S0065	mm i have to go rifle through my lunchbox what have i get that she like cereal bar crisp must always have food bribe in the car i'd forget that
S0136	oh yeah definitely well my husband when he work in a different school somebody say to him that basically bribery be the basics of today's education
S0065	exactly it's teach and parent isn't it
S0136	yeah
S0065	it's a shame really
S0136	cos the school i use to work at there be a language teacher there who use to when the year elevens do really well at the lesson she use to give them sweets and i kind of find it a bite strange because you know sure year eleven they don't really need things like that
S0065	it's ridiculous i mean i just i have two year ten lessons today so these be people who have opt to study german and my objective this year be to try and speak more german in class because that's really tough to get them to do and i'd try everything and this time i'm give them raffle ticket every time they say something so i've get a book of raffle ticket every time they say something to me in german i give them a raffle ticket and at the end we have a prize draw and they get a packet of maltesers
S0136	oh brilliant
S0065	i mean it's just ridiculous isn't it they've opt they're do a gsce but to get them to speak german which be why they should me in my classroom i actually have to bribe them
S0136	that actually work
S0065	i have to reward them with bag of chocolate it work but it's wrong
S0136	well in in real life nobody will give them maltesers for speak german sadly
S0065	no exactly but it's the only way i can get to hear them speak any german and it's the only way they're go to make some progress i've try the non chocolate methods
S0136	i use to just em when i be do work experience i be kind of em just assist really you know the teacher who be you know work with a class who opt to do german and what we do be just take them out of the classroom one by one and just coach them on the question that would be ask at the exam and as soon as they be out of the classroom just one to one with me for example they be like he he he i don't know anything oh yeah i do actually know this so that kind of thing you know
S0065	yeah it's nerve wrack and the thing be the exam have change now so you can't just drill them in those twenty question or whatever and hope that you know and ask from that set of question it's a bite more it have to be a bite more spontaneous now in a way in some ways less but in some ways more so what you really need be for them to have some confidence of do it by themselves they can do it it's just practice but it take so much lesson tine just force them to say something it's tricky
S0136	well i kind of think the exchange trip be probably incentive enough but they're probably not
S0065	i take twenty kid to well seventeen to em to germany at half term and there's still at least one of those who hasn't say a word of german to me since she get back it come down to your personality
S0136	i know
S0065	you're either go to do it or you're not no amount of cajole with maltesers or trip be go to change that
S0136	i think so and it's also difficult because if you have a class of kid who speak the same language then obviously they would speak the same language to each other
S0065	mm
S0136	cos when i be work in the language school i have the same problem erm i mostly teach english to people who be from germany or switzerland and because the they be basically you know class of speakers of the same language
S0065	mm
S0136	even though i speak english to them they speak german between themselves and so it be a really difficult task to get them to speak english include to you know like each other as well
S0065	yeah i think the only ways you can do it be by have a mix nationality class cos then they don't share a common language
S0136	yeah erm yeah different
S0065	but it it i mean it's obvious you would speak your native language to the person sit next to you wouldn't you
S0136	mm yeah
S0065	it's contrive otherwise
S0136	yeah the mix ones be a lot more fun because erm you know it's it's actually nice to see how they interact with each other and without know they actually help each other which which be great
S0065	yeah yeah that must be true
S0136	even with the normal class just like you know in mainstream school er i remember work in a group once in a group with like kid with real low abilities things like that and also there be two girls there one from thailand and one from poland and they just put them in the same group and i be just think oh how be i go to cope i mean you know they don't really speak much english neither of them but then you know they be sit together and before too long i just find that they be kind of you know try to communicate with each each other and just help each other which be brilliant
S0065	mm mm mm and then they've get a motivation so they're more likely to make progress
S0136	yeah
S0065	so be you teach english as a foreign language
S0136	em i be yeah i be teach a language school english as a foreign language for couple or years and then after that i be just a teach assistant in a normal school do all sort really but yeah i'm basically celta train
S0065	mm
S0136	so yeah i train in that be good fun actually
S0065	so that's not tefl or
S0136	eh it's eh yeah it's it's similar it's a similar thing
S0065	what's it call
S0136	celta celta stand for certificate of english language teach to adults
S0065	oh okay
S0136	and tefl be just like a general umbrella term for teach english as a foreign language
S0065	so why aren't you teach english as a foreign language now do you
S0136	mm well there's i just find that it's a bite irregular because the thing be er you depend on people who come from other countries
S0065	mm mm
S0136	and if they're for example school age students then you have to wait till they have like a holiday or something like that you know a break from third term
S0065	oh i see mm mm
S0136	and then so you know sometimes er sometimes it's really busy like i remember when i live in sussex and work in a language school em summer be really busy easter be quite busy then in winter there be nothing and so
S0065	and actually when you have children that's not what you want you want it to be busy in term time don't you
S0136	no absolutely yeah absolutely yeah but you know it be it be good fun though definitely you know
S0065	yeah i'd love to do that actually it must be great to teach language to people who really want to learn it and really need it rather than you know school kind who be just kind of do it because don't know they need it to perhaps bet on to the next stage of education they might not every use it for real purpose
S0136	well actually they're do this start this course now for basically an esl course for you know people who who's english be not you know english be not their first language
S0065	be they oh wow
S0136	yeah they they just literally i think they have an information even about that em either today or tomorrow cos julie ask me to sort something out for it so yeah you might
S0065	mm be you go to be teach
S0136	no no no i'm just sort out some resources i'm not sure who's mean to be who's go to be teach actually
S0065	they must have the teacher already i suppose
S0136	yeah yeah but it's just a what's happen in the next few days be just like a just like an information really you know for people who be potentially interest there's always stuff like that happen
S0065	yeah i could see that be a career move later in life i don't think i can do classroom teach until i'm sixty eight or whatever it be we have to be now before we can retire
S0136	i can relate to that well my husband can definitely because he's be teach for thirteen years em and he's a bite kind of tire of it eh he teach primary and even at primarily he say sometimes it's just too hard so
S0065	well primary be busy isn't it i don't think you get as much free time i mean i get a little bite of free time
S0136	and you have to teach everything as well every subject so it's a lot more pressure really on you now and also the expectation expectations i think be quite high because obviously you know the secondary school be like you know small fish big pond whereas there it's like the other way round
S0065	yeah where do he teach
S0136	well at the moment in linton but then it's only a temporary job so from easter i think he's go to or something
S0065	i don't know it
S0136	it's a very very small school like a really tiny one
S0065	what age do he teach then
S0136	oh just all age at the moment i think it's year six
S0065	okay so the bigger ones
S0136	yeah no he doesn't really have much experience with very very young ones you know well neither do i i'm not really into very small kid you know apart from my own you know
S0065	yeah exactly
S0136	but it's different when they're your own kid
S0065	i don't really like little kid i've just get two of my own
S0136	yeah well you know you know how it be it's like different with your own kid isn't it
S0065	oh completely well sometimes i don't know sometimes i'd happily give ella up for adoption like this morning
S0136	yeah have you get any plan for easter yet easter holiday
S0065	yeah we're go to go to em italy for a week because my husband's mum and dad have a house in tuscany so it sound more glamorous than it be it's in the middle of nowhere em but it's nice because it's not touristy you know tuscany can be a bite touristy but em this be up in the hill somewhere and we have to go down a stony ungravelled road just to even get to a real road so it's very it be very quiet it's very peaceful and we don't do much whilst we're there
S0136	sound good
S0065	yeah it will be good cos this time which be unusual my my mum and dad be go to come to so 's parent my parent us and the girls my two girls so
S0136	sound interest but busy
S0065	a full house yeah it will be busy i mean i'll still have a few days either side to get work do and do a bite of garden hopefully my garden look like oh i don't know war zone it's just overgrow and brambly and you know the cat have be dig it up it just look horrible i really need to get out there
S0136	be it's a very big garden
S0065	it it's biggish em we've get a front garden which be all the problem be it's all plant so it need to be take care of em we inherit it it's quite a mature garden and there's a very big vegetable garden em at the end so it's just lot of work it's like have an allotment and and a garden and we don't have that much time cos we've get the two little ones so i think i might have to ring the man in the village who come and help me now and again and see if he can do some dig
S0136	yeah
S0065	but yeah what about you
S0136	well my my in laws be actually work hard on their garden cos they just literally move into their new house and there's a lot of work cos it's a bigger house than the one they use to have with a bigger garden as well but our garden isn't really that big it's just kind of you know average size really em and we have an allotment as well cos most people in lode have an allotment
S0065	oh do they
S0136	so but it's mostly my husband who go there and do things there really you know
S0065	i'm amaze he find the time i mean we find it so difficult
S0136	that's because he get up at like half five
S0065	he go in the morning
