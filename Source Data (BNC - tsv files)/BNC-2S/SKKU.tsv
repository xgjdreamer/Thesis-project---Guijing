S0439	they don't write instructions for somebody who will have no idea what they're talk about and it's just
S0441	she obviously think she's very
S0439	she's an idiot so i've get that to work through but it should be fine once you've do something once it's fine isn't it but it's just that first time it's know well actually how do i do this

S0439	yeah true mum okay she find out today that she be gonna be make redundant

S0439	oh yeah she definitely be like in the mindset that she want to be make redundant if they she hadn't it would have ruin like all her plan
S0441	she would have be upset which be really funny
S0439	yeah no
S0439	you've get me in a job
S0439	and i've actually get to do some work
S0441	not lady of leisure anymore
S0439	so yeah she's look
S0441	she'll quite like be a lady of leisure
S0439	me too but i don't think it would be particularly good for her
S0441	oh no it won't be good for her but it
S0439	like a lazy person who have no like obligation to do anything
S0439	be not very good
S0439	exactly but erm yeah so how be today how be erm how be the phone call
S0441	well it be bloody long it's like er erm who do i ring first oh the law the place
S0439	yeah
S0441	and they be like oh this isn't our department so can you call back and i be like okay that's really helpful and they weren't really anyway it's like
S0439	yeah of course yeah
S0441	and then i ring the council and they say for me to ring citizens advice even though
S0439	even though they send us through a letter
S0441	yeah
S0439	be like if you need any help
S0441	i think i think the guy that i speak to be an idiot basically
S0439	okay
S0441	which be fun erm and then i ring citizens advice and he be actually very helpful he send over some stuff in an email about what you can do and tell me to ring shelter so i ring shelter and that be probably helpfullest
S0439	yeah
S0441	erm so basically what it boil down well actually no that's not true i speak to the legal team again first i actually get through to the right department and she
S0439	yeah
S0441	she be actually quite rude and it really get on my nerve
S0439	really
S0441	yeah like just annoy
S0439	yeah
S0441	so she be just like erm if we don't pay the the money then she could that's what i tell you about she could
S0439	she could
S0441	take legal action against us
S0439	yeah
S0441	if we haven't meet the contract
S0439	which no offence if she's not gonna actually make er she's not gonna take the whole erm repossession seriously i doubt if she'll take us to court but i get the point yeah
S0441	yeah just in case
S0439	yeah
S0441	i mean we're not about to go to court
S0439	no
S0441	erm so basically she be like i i can't help you basically and i be like fine er ring citizens advice so i already have
S0439	yeah
S0441	erm so i ring shelter and they
S0439	yeah
S0441	sort of say erm if we're in a i think it's basically what we say before if we're in a bind contract then the people that the lender will take over with the rent pay
S0439	oh okay
S0441	so we'll just have to pay the lender anyway
S0439	yeah
S0441	and it would've be a bind contract if the lender be happy that it be it be a tenancy mortgage then it's a bind contract cos they're aware of the situation
S0439	yeah
S0441	it wouldn't be a bind contract if it wasn't a
S0439	tenancy
S0441	tenancy mortgage erm and we can find that out the agency might know that or we
S0439	well it's worth ask the question isn't it
S0441	yeah or we just tell them that if basically if if it be if it isn't a bind contract
S0439	mm
S0441	then we have the right to leave anyway because
S0439	okay
S0441	she's not our landlady anymore
S0439	yeah
S0441	erm it's so difficult like
S0439	yeah
S0441	cos i'm not i i don't know
S0439	the legalities of it
S0441	the language
S0439	yeah yeah
S0441	it's really hard so let me just think about this so that be that erm i ask about the in fact i look at the contract again i i do talk to her about the contract and and say about that thing and she say well erm if it say that then erm because it's a contract you still have to pay because it's a contract
S0439	oh okay
S0441	and i do actually look into that that contract thing isn't what what what we think it be anyway
S0439	oh be it not
S0441	i i google it it's not thank god we didn't go to them and be like look at this cos it's like actually not even that
S0439	what it mean
S0441	it mean that the tenancy can be end if she want to sell her house basically
S0439	oh i see
S0441	that be a bite embarrass
S0441	erm so we haven't even get that clause so what we can do be it's call i always forget what it's call but it's something where you basically what what they say to us when we when they say that we could move out er in december and not pay
S0439	mm
S0441	that's call a something er it begin with an s but i can't remember what it's call a surrender a surrender
S0439	yeah
S0441	erm of the tenancy but they have the right to change that at any time
S0439	oh
S0441	if and and if they decide that that's not gonna happen anymore that's not gonna happen anymore
S0439	oh
S0441	if it's not in write as well
S0439	yeah
S0441	you have to sign it both have to sign it and agree to the term what we can do though be do another surrender on paper send it to them and say we want to move out on this date erm and then they can come back to us i suppose so that can be an option erm there be that thing about the deposit but that's fine like they couldn't do anything on there so that's fine erm what else do she oh if it be a bind contract and the lender take over from the payment the rent receive the rent then and the estate agents aren't let us leave on on the say date then we can ring up the lender er and move out in
S0439	what in december
S0441	if it get repossess
S0439	but we don't have to pay for january
S0441	no we wouldn't cos the lender would probably it would be in our their interest to get us out anyway so
S0439	oh i see so
S0441	so if it get repossess you can ring the lender and say we wanna move out on this day and then they can
S0439	okay
S0441	cos with the surrender if if they agree to the term then we can move out without any rent anyway
S0439	so what do the surrender include what do it
S0441	the surrender just say that we're end our tenancy on this date and that's it it's it's basically if you so for example she she put it to me like in term of a phone contract so if if you have a phone contract out and it's come to the end and at the end sort of you say erm i'm not gonna pay the last two months
S0439	yeah
S0441	because i'm sign a new contract and take out a new contract with you
S0439	oh okay
S0441	so basically there have to be something in their interest
S0439	but we're not take out a new contract with them
S0441	no i know but it's get to be something from their interest for it to happen so for example they've get new tenant come or erm i don't know she want a month to redecorate or something like it's get to be something that's in their interest
S0439	okay
S0441	so we haven't really get anything of that
S0439	no
S0441	but i mean it's worth a try if if we actually cos we haven't really explicitly say that we want to move out on a particular date have we i mean we have but we haven't officially
S0439	yeah
S0441	email them and tell them this
S0439	i say we want well we be gonna have we envisage i say the book in like
S0441	yeah
S0439	the sixteenth and seventeenth
S0441	and i've i've confirm that with her anyway and she say that's fine
S0439	yeah
S0441	we'll confirm that nearer the time but that's what i mean we haven't really get any right in that
S0439	yeah
S0441	cos they be the ones that be release us from the tenancy
S0439	yeah
S0441	so basically i think our next move we we we can't really do anything until we oh that's another thing we we can't find out whether it's be repossess or not because it's not anything to do with us
S0439	but can we find out if it's a bind contract
S0441	if they have the paperwork but no otherwise not they might not have that paperwork
S0439	so could we ring them and ask them if they could we email them and ask them if they have that contract
S0441	uhu well it's it's not them it's kind of the the estate er whether the woman have take out a mortgage that make it a bind contract so she she would have have to have take out a tenancy mortgage
S0439	okay
S0441	not a normal mortgage if it's a normal mortgage then it's not a bind contract
S0439	and how do and we can't know that
S0441	if they have that information but again if they'd protections in for this into this they might not give us that information anyway
S0439	true
S0441	i think it's really bad that there's not a lot of right for tenant really be there
S0439	no
S0441	cos a lot of the stuff that i be look at online as well be all to do with landlady right and landlord right and stuff and it's nothing really they don't really look at the tenant
S0439	we ought we could ask when they're expect the new tenant to move in
S0441	yeah
S0439	cos i very much think it's unfair that if they're that's if we move out and the the new tenant move in like the day before and they haven't
S0441	i don't think they know though to be honest and i don't think
S0439	oh do they not
S0441	i don't think they they tell them about this potential repossession
S0439	repossession yeah
S0441	so until we know when they're move in and until we know what's go on we're not i don't think we should pay the rent on the sixteenth anyway i mean we'll pay it if we need to but we just won't
S0439	pay it bang on the sixteenth
S0441	no
S0439	well we should find out by the shouldn't we
S0441	probably not cos it's gonna come out by by post so it won't come out like we won't know on the fourteenth cos we haven't get the right to that information
S0439	do we have the right to know whether she attend the hear
S0441	no
S0439	oh
S0441	we have no right to know like anything we'll know the outcome
S0439	well yeah obviously
S0441	but they'll notify the outcome by post
S0439	mm okay
S0441	so really at the moment it's look like we'll probably have to pay
S0439	disaster okay
S0441	but
S0439	it's just so poorly organise by them
S0441	i know they don't know whether they're come or go really
S0439	cos we be we be just so explicit when we say we want to move out
S0441	i know
S0439	at the like
S0441	but then i think they've get the right haven't they so i think they be they know but i think that since this have happen they've change the goalpost which they be actually entitle to do
S0439	it's just so unfair
S0441	it's really annoy the moral of the story be for everything to be in write
S0439	yeah
S0441	but they be so sneaky about that i think
S0439	well if you look how follow up today i mean like about the blind she's like well i say that i'm like yeah you say that and i reply
S0441	which yeah say we can't do that
S0439	yeah you ask me in october
S0441	yeah
S0439	for a bill from like april like i'm sorry
S0441	not likely
S0439	yeah like if you'd actually do your fuck job properly and order a blind when the blind man come we wouldn't be in this situation fuck twat
S0441	so we can draw up a a sort of our own contract state that we want to leave it's not a contract that's actually the it's the surrender and they
S0439	but they'd still charge us wouldn't they
S0441	no no that's the whole point it's a surrender if if it become the whole if term but the thing be we haven't get the really apart from tenant cos well we've get
S0439	well we can ask could we pay up until january the first or pay up until december the thirty first and then the new tenant pay on the first well and give and ask the estate agents to offer the new tenant the option of move in you know straight away in january
S0441	yeah
S0439	it's just so it's so annoy that we can't talk to the tenant if that make sense i'm pretty sure if we'd
S0441	i'm sure if we
S0439	speak to the tenant like the new ones this would have be like well like we could have just alter it ourselves
S0441	i know
S0439	but the estate agent be so shit
S0441	and it's annoy that we can't talk to the landlady as well
S0439	yeah cos i'm pretty sure if they actually ask the lady she probably wouldn't care
S0441	no i think she's quite hard to track down though
S0439	true i'm not overly impress with our estate agents to be honest
S0441	not for much longer
S0439	no it won't be for much longer will it really oh well what be you up to this weekend
S0441	go to 's
S0439	be you
S0441	yeah
S0439	mm
S0441	erm if i'll i'll still probably move out on on the weekend that i be move out
S0439	yeah me too yeah
S0441	but in all fairness we should probably just cancel the bill as well
S0439	yeah i be go to anyway
S0441	i think you want to live in here if if if you
S0439	well i be go to because it be gonna be a pain but erm i actually i'm gonna move into the place in and because overall it's three hundred and seventy pound a month include bill
S0441	mm so that's actually a lot yeah
S0439	so it's a lot cheaper in the long term
S0441	mm
S0439	so even though it will cost me extra what three hundred odd quid to stay in this stupid shitty house it'll actually be more expensive in the long term i think so i'm just gonna have to take the financial hit
S0441	yeah i guess well until after er but
