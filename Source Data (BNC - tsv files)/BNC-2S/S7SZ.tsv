S0262	you would have be well out of it then
S0300	yeah so i think they might have give me a little bite too much to be honest
S0262	could well be
S0300	so
S0262	could well be yeah
S0300	but i didn't feel ill or or groggy
S0262	you just felt like knock out
S0300	just a bite yeah just sort of like
S0262	drug up
S0300	yeah like a really really bad hangover
S0262	yeah
S0300	type thing really
S0262	yeah okay yeah
S0300	so no so that actually go really well
S0262	yeah
S0300	a bite of pain for a couple of days back to normal
S0262	oh good
S0300	so yeah so that be that i'll phone up for my result on thursday
S0262	and right
S0300	to see if they find anything
S0262	do they say anything at all to you like or anything
S0300	they say to my daughter that they erm they could see quite a lot of inflammation
S0262	right
S0300	but that be about all she remember
S0262	yeah okay
S0300	you know what they're like they don't really listen
S0262	yeah no she's probably more concern about try to get you home than really understand what yeah
S0300	yeah yeah yeah so er no
S0262	but still quite a lot of inflammation
S0300	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0300	so that's a bad thing anyway because it shouldn't because it's the inflammation that cause all the problems
S0262	right
S0300	like it cause my arthritis in my elbow and my knees to flare up and and stuff so yeah inflammation isn't good
S0262	right okay no
S0300	but they didn't say if they i mean they take biopsies but they didn't say if they saw anything untoward so i'll find out thursday
S0262	no so you'll ring up thursday
S0300	yeah yeah i just have to call the sister that i see on the in the clinic and then she'll call me back and let me know
S0262	i suppose it's a good thing that you can ring up but then also it's a bite kind of weird as well don't you think
S0300	it's alright if you're get good news
S0262	yeah
S0300	if you're get sort of not so good news then you kind of think mm not really what you want discuss over the phone
S0262	no i suppose it's most convenient
S0300	mm
S0262	thing to do
S0300	yeah cos try to fit you in for an appointment be be a nightmare
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	cos as far as i know be just mental at the moment on the appointment side
S0262	be they
S0300	because i should have go to the hospital last tuesday for my throat check up
S0262	right
S0300	well not my throat my neck check up and i have to cancel that because of the funeral
S0262	yeah
S0300	when i go to rebook it i've get to wait two months so instead of go last week i'm
S0262	two months
S0300	on the seventh of october i now go on the sixth of december
S0262	it's just it's just unfathomable

S0262	yeah
S0300	erm he ring up and his be exactly the same as mine he's now get to wait till the fourth of december the day before my appointment so he's on the same wait list
S0262	so it's two months
S0300	wait time
S0262	wait two months that's a long time
S0300	it's a long time
S0262	particularly when you've already have an appointment book in
S0300	yeah cos i say well can't you get any earlier appointments i say i've get a funeral to go to i say obviously
S0262	yeah
S0300	i have to go to this funeral erm and i say and i've also be wait nine months for this appointment because they muck me muck it all up at the hospital to start with and she say no she say it will be the whatever of december
S0262	pff
S0300	so so yeah so i've get to wait two months for that appointment now
S0262	yeah
S0300	so but no so all in all and then last monday if as we be get ready to go to go leave to go to plymouth go to fee my little animals cos we've get a guinea pig a rabbit and a dog
S0262	okay
S0300	and the guinea pig have die
S0262	oh no
S0300	i open his hutch and he just lay there i be like mm
S0262	oh no
S0300	and it be it be just so so upset cos we have two
S0262	yeah
S0300	and one be mine and one be my eldest daughter's and then the rabbit be the younger daughter's
S0262	right
S0300	so we all kind of have our own little pet
S0262	yeah
S0300	and i use to have hamsters as well i love little hamsters
S0262	yeah
S0300	but erm and then when my daughter leave home she kind of like pass her guinea pig over to the youngest daughter
S0262	right
S0300	so she have the although i'm the one that feed them every day and
S0262	take care of them really
S0300	yeah but she clean yeah but she clean them out that's what i i won't i won't clean them out because the rabbit won't let me actually get him out the hutch cos he hat me
S0262	right
S0300	erm even when i go to fee him he he try to bite my finger
S0262	yeah
S0300	so she do all that but erm but yeah i be mortify and the of course didn't have time to bury him
S0262	oh no you just have to leave him there
S0300	and then i then i forget to bury him
S0262	oh no oh god
S0300	cos wrap him up and put him in a little cat box and put him in the garage cos i think oh it'll be quite cool
S0262	yeah
S0300	in there and then i think oh i i'll mention to when i speak to him monday night to dig a hole and put the guinea pig in it
S0262	yeah
S0300	erm forget so and of course i don't even tell him it have die
S0262	oh no
S0300	and then erm come back late tuesday night so didn't do it then and then completely forget to it wednesday and it be thursday afternoon i actually bury him
S0262	oh
S0300	and the weirdest thing be as i be dig the hole i hit something so i dig out some more dirt and there be this blanket and i think
S0262	oh no
S0300	i'm sure i put your brother in a box
S0262	yeah
S0300	and it and i and i kind of scoop it out i didn't look at it i scoop it out with the erm with the the shovel erm and lay it on the on the grind and then i saw bits of the box cos obviously the box be disintegrate
S0262	yeah sure yeah
S0300	so i know it be his brother so it be quite sweet in a way
S0262	yeah you'd go back
S0300	so i put them both exactly the same spot
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	put them on top of each other
S0262	which be pretty cool in a way
S0300	no i just think how uncanny be that
S0262	yeah
S0300	cos i don't mark where i've put them i mean we've get dog we've well i know where the dog be erm there they have get like proper little grave things
S0262	yeah
S0300	but the little animals that like the hamsters and the guinea pig
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	they're they're sort of like along this hedgerow
S0300	but where you wouldn't know
S0262	yeah but you obviously do
S0300	and the fact that i dig this hole as the hole i dig before
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0300	be just amaze
S0262	yeah
S0300	so
S0262	how long ago be that
S0300	he die about april time
S0262	right okay
S0300	no february he die on valentine's day
S0262	oh
S0300	yeah that it be valentine's day so yeah february
S0262	oh gosh these little little things have a habit of pass on
S0300	pass at the wrong time
S0262	at the wrong time exactly
S0300	yeah cos i the thing be i i have a lot of feel for little animals
S0262	yeah
S0300	you know like 's like ah they're just animals you know i mean like one of the guy that rent one of our shed say well why don't you just put it in the recycle bin
S0262	oh no you can't do that
S0300	and i'm like why why would you do that
S0262	it's be your pet
S0300	i say would you put your dog in the recycle bin when it die
S0262	no
S0300	he go no i say well there you go
S0262	course not yeah
S0300	so i say no
S0262	it's a little creature
S0300	i say i'm gonna dig a hole so i do
S0262	yeah
S0300	but yeah so mm
S0262	so how be the funeral then
S0300	it be
S0262	still cough
S0300	it be actually quite weird in a way because
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	as i say i've only ever be to one funeral
S0262	yeah
S0300	and that be my nan's and that be sort of like it be a it be a sad it be a sad time erm and it be a proper burial because this be a cremation i've never be to a cremation before so i didn't know what to expect
S0262	yes different atmosphere
S0300	and it be all yeah it be completely different i mean while we be wait outside the crem for the like for the hearse to turn up everybody be just they be just all out there smoke laugh fool around
S0262	yeah oh right
S0300	then you follow the coffin in
S0262	yeah
S0300	and it's like everybody start to cry
S0262	yeah
S0300	erm and then obviously why they're the back back back oh i don't know what he be call he wasn't a vicar minister no i don't know i can't remember what he be call
S0262	be he the person who take the service
S0300	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0300	so we he he be then like talk so of course as he's say things you get really quite kind of upset so the whole time you be in there it be really really tense and and my brother actually do lose it completely
S0262	mm
S0300	erm er and then when you sort of come out it be back to everybody light up fag and sit there laugh and i be like be this really what happen
S0262	it's weird surreal yeah
S0300	you know and i just think i hope people be a little bite more upset when i've
S0262	yeah
S0300	you know when when you lay me to rest
S0262	yeah
S0300	er then we go to a pub which just seem to seem weird because she die through alcohol
S0262	alcohol yeah
S0300	so it just seem bizarre that you would have like this little wake in a pub
S0262	yeah
S0300	so basically once you all get there and everybody start to have a drink it be just like a family get together
S0262	people just down the pub
S0300	down the pub
S0262	yeah
S0300	and that be it no more there be no more tear me you know like my mum say say say you would have think that someone would have speak i mean like when we get our drink like cos like we sit at a table and i just go er to and my and then everyone else do the same but nobody toast her
S0262	no no
S0300	or or speak about her everybody sort of sit in their own little group
S0262	no yeah
S0300	and i just think no this be weird
S0262	yeah yeah i think that be what's slightly the problem with the crem service be that that be very what you describe be quite similar to erm some of the service i've be to
S0300	right
S0262	erm and i think it's because the the service itself be so short
S0300	yeah
S0262	so it's it's so short but it's so intense
S0300	yeah
S0262	which mean that people need to laugh around the intensity because you can't actually just maintain that level of intensity for the whole sort of
S0300	yeah no no
S0262	whereas i think with a more of a funeral service it break it up quite a bite
S0300	yeah
S0262	because you've get the church well you've get meet people be show where to sit sit down the service that go on for some time
S0300	yeah mm mm
S0262	and then you know you go and walk out to or you might even have to take a car to where the
S0300	to where the yeah
S0262	you know the cemetery be and so it's quite a lot but but the good thing be then be that it's be you're all still together in the sort of the the patchwork of what's go on
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	but you can actually have a bite of headspace
S0300	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	time out whereas i think the crem service be just so intense
S0300	oh it yeah it be just weird it be
S0262	and the way the actual build be you be outside
S0300	yeah
S0262	then you're sort of stand round go well what do i'll wait for the family to turn up
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	but they can't talk to everyone
S0300	no
S0262	erm and of course they're emotionally overladen anyway and then you get in there and the something happen that take you know not really twenty minutes
S0300	that's it
S0262	and then you wave bye bye to the coffin which be all a bite
S0300	yeah
S0262	that's quite full on i mean i know that the the grave in the er sorry the erm the coffin into the be pretty full on but at least you've still get the word go
S0300	yeah
S0262	whereas when the coffin go in to the behind the curtain
S0300	mm
S0262	some people have it and some people don't
S0300	yeah
S0262	there's just music
S0300	that's it that's all it be
S0262	and the music tend to be really emotional as well
S0300	the music that be play be erm a ferry ferry across the mersey
S0262	oh crikey that's enough to it's a bite of a tear jerker that one
S0300	well yeah and that be and what what he say be he say this be for you from and be her brother and they both support liverpool
S0262	right
S0300	so of course he just totally go to bits
S0262	yeah you see this be the thing
S0300	er i didn't know that until after but i saw him crumble erm and couldn't understand why
S0262	no
S0300	erm cos i didn't even know that be her brother at the time i i you you're stand there and you're kind of put two and two together and everything's come
S0262	yeah
S0300	together and i be like oh my god that must be her brother and stuff like that so and that play twice
S0262	oh god
S0300	cos i don't think the coffin have go quick enough
S0262	mm
S0300	cos you have this guy stand there with his baton thing
S0262	yeah
S0300	and and ten like he walk up to the curtain and he bow and then he stand there while the music play and then as the music be about to stop he like turn round bow to us and then start to walk towards the door
S0262	right
S0300	then the music instantly play again same song
S0262	oh
S0300	so of course he then walk back in go back towards where the curtain be bow stand there while the music play so you have to listen to this song twice
S0262	oh so all all over again yeah that be not good
S0300	and it and no one could move you couldn't get up and walk out
S0262	no no no that that sound a bite rubbish really
S0300	and it be it be a just horrific i just think you know surely they know how long it take for a a
S0262	yeah they should know yeah
S0300	a coffin to to go
S0262	yeah they get that one wrong somebody hadn't press the button to move the coffin along
S0300	yeah they get that wrong big big big time yeah and then and then once you'd sort of leave there and you stand outside and everybody gather in their own little group again cos there wasn't that many people there
S0262	no it's like my mum's service yeah
S0300	cos we're all they're all from and they move to so there be only a few of us that actually be able to get to for the funeral apparently there be or there be go to be a service here for the people that didn't make it
S0262	yeah oh okay that's nice yeah
S0300	erm so of course there wasn't many people there there be probably only about fifteen people include
S0262	yeah
S0300	erm and then on top of that like my brother and his his daughter so there really wasn't many people
S0262	no and and in a way that's probably not such a bad thing because
S0300	no
S0262	what i be so worry about with with mum's service i can't remember so much with gran's service though you know it be up in erm off the a14 the crematorium up there
S0300	oh yes
S0262	erm i've forget the name of it now and erm but anyway what i be worry about for my mum be the erm the who be the funeral directors tell me that erm it's quite likely that there be go to be another service on the dot
S0300	straight after
S0262	these things go like on the dot if it's two thirty it start and if you're not out by two two two twenty two they're gonna hurry you along
S0300	right
S0262	so it be like oh great this be now feel like pressure you know to even finish on time
S0300	mm
S0262	so it's a lot of pressure for erm a lot of pressure for my brother and myself cos we both speak to make sure that we actually keep the time that we be give or that we have kind of give ourselves erm mine be alright cos i read a sort of read a children's story poem that my mum always use to read to me
S0300	mm yeah mm mm right
S0262	so that i know how long that would take but my brother on the other hand he do a erm sort of like erm a eulogy sort of thing to my mum and he be freewheel it and when people get nervous you could just go on forever and not realise that you're actually take quite a long time but thankfully he's get a really good idea for what the time's like cos he do lot of presentations
S0300	yeah yeah yeah right right
S0262	so it be actually alright
S0300	yeah
S0262	we all finish on time you know and it be good but it be a pressure but yeah when we come out there be already like a whole forty or fifty people line up line up outside ready to go in for the for their
S0300	for theirs oh my god
S0262	service and it be weird because we all sort of come out probably about fifteen to eighteen of us i think i don't know maybe twenty i'm not even sure but not a lot
S0300	mm no
S0262	and and then we be sort of like crowd out by this other lot who like you be say like they're laugh smoke whatever
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	and some of them be obviously look really quite kind of shock but most of them be kind of like try to sort of ease things up a bite but then our lot just go like oh and then we all zip off into our cars
S0300	yeah
S0262	but thankfully we know where we be go cos we be gonna go and have afternoon tea at the erm in which be actually a good location for everyone to get to
S0300	right yeah yeah
S0262	it's a good car park in there erm but yeah it's it i think there's something there's a lot to be say about be cremate i'm sure
S0300	mm
S0262	but for the people who attend the service it's it's not quite the same
S0300	no you see my mum and dad both want to be cremate erm
S0262	but then you don't care if that's your wish you're not gonna
S0300	yeah no
S0262	you're not gonna know about be you so
S0300	i'm kind of think yeah do i really want them cremate you know but that's their wish so you've get to go along with what they
S0262	it's their wish
S0300	and my mother in law turn round and say yes erm and i want to be we we're gonna have a humane cremation i say well what the hell be that and she say no service nothing just
S0262	oh oh just
S0300	yeah
S0262	well
S0300	and i be like whoa
S0262	the thing about those place be you know you know they're a crematorium they're not a place of worship and i'm not religious so i don't
S0300	no see we're not
S0262	but i know that when i walk into a church whether i believe or not i know that there be people who do believe and it calm me down
S0300	mm mm
S0262	because that kind of level of spirituality whether you're kind of into it or not there be something about a church that you can just go
S0300	yeah
S0300	yeah you can just let it all go
S0262	yeah cos cos you know that's kind of what you're mean to do in a church
S0300	erm and feel relax yeah
S0262	be sort of try to unwind a bite
S0300	but in a crem you're not relax
S0262	not at all
S0300	no
S0262	and they it's so artificial it's it be it's everything be so
S0300	it do it felt fake
S0262	oh fake very fake
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	and i mean you know you try to jolly it up a bite with the flower and everything but what what be weird up in that one i've never like it up there be because the flower for because the service be so tight the flower don't get move away in time for the new lot come in so they actually have they be obviously a family who believe in big wreathe
S0300	right
S0262	you know with the person's name
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	you know really shy kind of stuff which i fine it's fine you know that we go for you know smaller things and just things that my mum like really but erm but yeah theirs be and so they be all come along and and and i'm i'm like oh your little flower for my mum i'll just kind of move them here and you know but the funeral director be like no no no don't worry we'll take care of that that's their job to do that but it felt a bite weird
S0300	mm yeah yeah
S0262	you know i felt like oh i really should move our stuff now
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	my dad be oblivious to that cos i say that to him i say oh you know what didn't you feel a bite like he's like god i didn't even think about the flower you know i mean he be absolutely out of it
S0300	mm yeah
S0262	you know for most of the day i don't know how he keep it together but i suppose family be close by you know you can sort of manage to just sort of talk
S0300	mm yeah
S0262	but it's it's so weird
S0300	mm
S0262	i mean your brain be do something weird because your whole emotions be just
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	right up in the air but you're still have to have a conversation with people
S0300	exactly it be very bizarre it be just i don't know it's just something i don't really feel
S0262	yeah i've not give it much think i mean the the downside i suppose with the with the erm be you know erm bury be that you actually have to wait around for a slot
S0300	yes
S0262	that can be hard go for the family erm yeah it just depend on where your local kind of burial you know grind or your local cemetery would be but it's it's a bite yeah that can be problematic
S0300	mm mm yeah yeah yeah
S0262	i mean friend of mine actually his mum die last week yeah she i think it be alcoholism as well
S0300	oh really
S0262	well yeah she'd lead an expat lifestyle where it be so easy to drink
S0300	yeah
S0262	i mean it's kind of almost expect you know it just start as it do i don't think anybody mean to really kind of turn out that way but both her and her husband quite like a tipple erm quite a lot and then i suppose boredom set in and she just get use to drink during the day
S0300	mm right
S0262	now i never saw her drink during the day but my friend who be a really good friend well we all use to go to school together it be 's mum who die but who i know and she go out there to spend some time on a family holiday and erm she yeah she do make a few comment and be like right g and t sort of at about eleven in the morning kind of thing
S0300	yeah oh
S0262	but quite outwardly about it not like an alcohol you know like someone who's try to hide it which be what i would more associate
S0300	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0262	but i know there's different type of but the ones who be kind of
S0300	yeah yeah sneak
S0262	hide it
S0300	yeah
S0262	to me feel like they know they've get a problem
S0300	yeah
S0262	but true people who who keep drink sociably do have a problem but they're just not think that they have get one
S0300	yeah yeah no no
S0262	so i don't know which be worse
S0300	no
S0262	but anyway so and then erm 's dad die the same year as my mum but she her dad die in may and so yeah so may two thousand and twelve and then i think just really be pin for him
S0300	yeah they just give up
S0262	and she just really didn't know what her life be all about without him cos he be such a core for her life you know i think he kind of do manage her you know drink a bite and you know of course then you know if there's no one there to really manage your drink or even to think about your life i mean you know 's a wonderful daughter but she's take full care of her mum and everything you know but of all account didn't really understand that and she just keep drink drink drink drink and so much so where she be begin to turn a little bite on the nasty side with it
S0300	right yeah
S0262	like i don't know i be never there but i hear that be take a lot of shit from her mum
S0300	mm mm
S0262	but then so she keep drink but and and her husband go to cuba on holiday and her mum pass on while they be in cuba so poor have to get on a flight and i know what that must be like know full well she's come back to the fact that her mum have die and erm nobody know what really happen to her because she be on her in her house on her own sunday she speak to her other daughter she sound weak and then the cleaner be due in on a on a morning i don't know i suppose cleaner couldn't get in
S0300	find her oh couldn't get in
S0262	be worry and then call the police the police go we're come round get round to have a look and there
S0300	there she be
S0262	just die on her own there so
S0300	oh how awful
S0262	yeah so and then i she's gonna be cremate yeah she's gonna be cremate i think that's right yeah so the funeral will actually be next friday twenty fourth
S0300	mm mm
S0262	cos we be all like oh because she's catholic we're think that could be a burial like in a cemetery and it be kind of like oh that's go to be one of those really long service and then you go have to go to the you know and we be kind of like you know not that we be say oh we don't want to do it
S0300	no no
S0262	it's just like you're mentally prepare yourself you're go like right okay it's gonna be like that
S0300	yeah yeah it's go to be like this de de de de
S0262	and then when say no my her mum want to be cremate then we be like okay right but then again i know what it's gonna be like
S0300	yeah it's gonna be yeah
S0262	it's gonna be like what we be describe it's just like ch ch ch ch ch
S0300	yeah yeah it's just so
S0262	and then to a pub
S0300	yeah it's just so quick
S0262	you know
S0300	i just don't believe how quick it be
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	you've get all that build up to it
S0262	and you know it cost a fair bite of money
S0300	mm i mean the one that have cost three thousand pound
S0262	yeah
S0300	it be very and that be the minimum the basic that be a class as the basic
S0262	but yeah
S0300	erm and she's get a grant to pay for that cos she's only seventeen
S0262	yeah okay
S0300	so she she kind of take over
S0262	oh that's good yeah
S0300	and didn't and obviously my brother wouldn't have be able to afford er it anyway
S0262	yeah
S0300	erm because obviously none of them have any money they didn't have any save
S0262	right yeah
S0300	so you know so i think because it go
S0262	well thank god for that then isn't it
S0300	yeah i think because it go through and as i say she's only seventeen they've allow her this this grant
S0262	she get help yeah
S0300	so it hasn't cost anybody anything i think all they have to pay for be the few sandwich that be make
S0262	for the pub
S0300	at the pub
S0262	yeah
S0300	erm but other than that they haven't have to pay out for anything
S0262	well i mean thank god for that
S0300	but that's a that's that's the minimum three thousand pound
S0262	no i know i know three thousand
S0300	i'm like that's a lot of money for someone to have to find to have the most basic cremation you know and i just think it i know you've get
S0262	yeah then when you think about it what how why be it three thousand pound if it's a thousand i'd understand but why be it three thousand
S0300	yeah cos i mean it's the hire of the hearse
S0262	yeah
S0300	and obviously the coffin and what the funeral directors have do and then you've get your pall bearers whatever they're call
S0262	yeah
S0300	erm and then your vicar he'd whatever they're call
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	and and that and the hire of the the crem for twenty minutes so
S0262	yeah and then and then i suppose they've get to do the bite where they take the coffin and put it in a yeah
S0300	but then obviously they take the coffin and obviously that go wherever it go so
S0262	yeah
S0300	so yeah so but that's still we just sort of sit there and say that really doesn't warrant three thousand pound it just doesn't
S0262	not in my head it doesn't
S0300	well not in mine either
S0262	but then you know i know like when we be talk to who have they're local we use them with granny erm granny's er funeral erm i mean they be pretty good because they come to the house
S0300	yeah
S0262	that have get to be pretty hard work
S0300	oh yeah
S0262	and well you know with granny and mum it be all actually right because basically they'd sort of you know they be contain what i would say
S0300	mm yeah yeah
S0262	whereas i know from stories not from they wouldn't dream of tell stories but from other people in australia who be funeral directors or or assistants you can find all sort you know in people's house
S0300	oh gosh
S0262	and they they they're in you know there they have to clean it up i mean they have to make it erm for the families so the family haven't get any idea what's actually happen
S0300	no
S0262	because you can't be have that sort of thing so i can see why they get pay quite a bite of money
S0300	well no yeah yeah
S0262	for
S0300	for all of that yeah yeah
S0262	the headspace you must take up when you have to do things like that
S0300	yeah
S0262	but really like the other stuff i don't know i mean i suppose you know er a pall bearer erm what would you pay them i don't know i mean like
S0300	no i don't
S0262	fifteen pound an hour or because when you think about their work i suppose they do have to be there on time
S0300	yeah
S0262	ready to do their bite because if they're not there wow there's go to be all hell to pay because you know you know you can't even get the coffin you can't even ask the family to carry it unless they particularly want to you know but not really
S0300	no yeah yeah yeah no yeah yeah no i don't think there's many people that do it now do they
S0262	that's not really what it's about i mean we have a lovely vicar from erm who live just over there in and we'd never meet her before but she's quite she's quite erm i suppose she's quite well know round the area cos she's like a minister or something and then she decide she didn't want to do that any more she just really want a bite of a peaceful life and just sort of live down there and just do her sort of pastor thing
S0300	right yeah yeah yeah
S0262	her parish erm her parish parish and erm but yeah she be really good because she'd never meet my mum but she speak about my mum as if she have
S0300	as if she know her yeah
S0262	which that's quite an art in itself and she course you've get to pay them money too
S0300	yeah yeah exactly
S0262	but that be quite a skill and you have to keep everyone on track you know and especially people be lose it you've get to try and them all up with it
S0300	mm yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0262	which be a skill so i can see why she be or what she cost but yeah like i still think three thousand cos ours be about that if not a bite more i think
S0300	mm yeah
S0300	i don't know
S0262	thank god mum have some money to pay for that you know
S0300	and when she turn yeah and when she turn round and say that be the minimum
S0262	yeah yeah that's right yeah
S0300	i go wow you know you're seventeen you haven't get a a a pot to pee in you know if you hadn't be able to get a grant how the hell could you have do it
S0262	wouldn't have be able to
S0300	well no
S0262	unless the family would have have some
S0300	it would have have well it would have have to have be
S0262	a family loan
S0300	all the family chip in
S0262	or a bank loan
S0300	yeah
S0262	some people have to get bank loan
S0300	but you know i just kind of think whoa you know i mean i don't know i don't i i've not tell either of my girls how i would like to cos i don't know
S0262	no
S0300	i mean it's not something i think about at the moment
S0262	well no it doesn't
S0300	i know you should
S0262	yeah
S0300	erm cos as you say you never know what's round the corner but you know like my mum and dad have always say they want to be cremate they've get two tree they've get a tree each in their garden
S0262	oh okay
S0300	erm so they specifically say that we want to be cremate and our ash be to be scatter
S0262	oh well that's nice yeah
S0300	at our tree
S0262	yeah
S0300	so we know exactly when if anything happen to my mum and dad or if it happen at the same time we we would know what to do
S0262	yeah yeah which be good because you don't want to worry about that
S0300	yeah but you see nobody would know i mean i wouldn't know how want cos if would turn round and say well i don't care cos i don't i won't know nothing about it
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	so he'd kind of leave it up to you you know it'd be up to us what we want to do with him
S0262	yeah
S0300	but i do think that you should be able to say to somebody maybe you know
S0262	give it some think
S0300	yeah when i give them an idea you know
S0262	yeah exactly or don't or tell me what you don't want
S0300	yeah and then we know what their
S0262	and then we know where we're gonna you know yeah
S0300	yeah yeah if you don't want to be cremate then say i don't want to be cremate
S0262	mm
S0300	i mean i know there be only cremation or burial there's only two
S0262	mm mm mm
S0300	choices but
S0262	but you see i'm i'm a donor for all of my organs like i wouldn't you know if they want something they can have it as far as i'm concern i don't think i cross anything that i didn't erm not take
S0300	no
S0262	erm and then in my mind i'm think well if there really have get a big chunk of you for what bite of the other that they felt that they need in the bigger scheme of things you know really what's the point of go and have a service really when there might only be half of you there and i know that sound just ghastly
S0300	yeah yeah but it's true
S0262	but but in a way it's like
S0300	yeah it's true
S0262	what be what be the point really when
S0300	yeah
S0262	you see the thing i couldn't get my head round with my mum and my gran i think more for my mum cos i felt it more keenly but i know that she be over with 's erm in a erm in a erm cooler box i
S0300	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0262	i can't remember what you call them be try to think about what it be can't remember
S0300	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	anyway and er so she would've be there until she be ready to to you know for the funeral service
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	and er he 's have say to me if you'd like to drop over and er just pop over and drop some of her personal artefacts off that you think she would like
S0300	mm mm
S0262	er in her coffin with her and i be like right so i do as i be tell because i couldn't think of anything else to do i be just like right okay do what he ask me to do so i i bring some things over and i be wait there and actually this be quite funny because he i've never see him stress out but he be stress that morning the reason why be because he have another funeral service that very morning and the person who say that they would organise the flower hadn't so this be a family member who have just obviously forget to organise the flower so he be have to do it now
S0300	right yeah
S0262	so he be all in a panic and then anyway he come out and he be have his little cigar and he be chill out a bite and you know we be talk about death and you know how some of the funny more amuse side of it
S0300	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	which there be you know and he must have see a lot
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	and i say i guess in the bigger scheme of things this isn't the worst thing that can happen he go oh no i could tell you a few things
S0300	mm
S0262	and anyway so i say but you know do people really come back to have a look at the body at like and he's like oh he say oh yes they do and and we have to you know present the body he use very sort of grave word but you know the body need to be presentable at all hours for any family member far or wide who'd fly in from new zealand or whatever and have only five minutes to go and say goodbye whatever you know and i be like oh
S0300	mm mm mm yeah
S0262	so they have to get the body ready and erm and that obviously take a fair bite and then i say oh i say i see what you mean and be that the reason why i should bring some things for mum you know cos i couldn't really figure out who be go to go and have a look so i certainly wasn't wasn't dad wasn't couldn't think of anybody else that be go to he say well yeah but also you know you sort of think about in the afterlife you know some people believe in that some people think you know this be such a an important part of that person's life that you think that they want that with them you know i'm like okay she's dead but alright i can sort of buy it that maybe it's more for the family to think that it's quite comfort
S0300	mm yeah yeah mm mm
S0262	and er so i say oh right well i i and i pull pull out cos i didn't know what to bring so i just have a bag full of stuff and er and he go oh that's quite suitable that's nice he go but no that won't be and i say oh that's my mum's college scarf and he say well yeah but that's something that you could wear you see that's something that you could wear still and have
S0300	ah
S0262	as part of her and i go oh yeah i'd never think about it like that before
S0300	no no
S0262	but then there're certain other little things he think be great like i buy in little cigarillos that she use to like you know and er you know er what else do i bring just just a dress that i know she like and you know i don't know i some smaller things like that you know maybe a little or yeah a little hat cap that she use to really like wear
S0300	mm
S0262	and er interestingly enough he say have the take back the college scarf but we'll keep the hat i be laugh i could have see i be try to understand his logic but
S0300	yeah if he's take that why didn't he take the scarf
S0262	right i know and i and i just
S0300	and he's take her dress but not her scarf
S0262	i know
S0300	yeah
S0262	and the dress be so big because
S0300	yeah
S0262	when she die she be really like nothing you know
S0300	yeah
S0262	the all of her all of her you know unfortunately all of her body mass really have kind of waste away but erm
S0300	yeah
S0262	but erm this dress be just i i'd forget that she be so small and that you know she have be quite you know a sizeable lady i mean like as in a size fourteen fifteen like sixteen i don't know
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	and erm so i present this dress and it be massive and i be like oh crikey i've really bugger that one up
S0300	yeah
S0262	maybe i should've give one of my dress or you know something with a little bite more
S0300	yeah mm
S0262	and he say no no no that's fine if she would have wear it don't even worry about that don't even think about that that if she would have wear in and you can see her wear it then we'll put it on her and you will i'll tell you that all these things i i promise you will be all nicely arrange in the coffin so when you're look at the coffin try not to look at the coffin but look at what you're
S0300	visualise
S0262	think about inside okay and he go if you ever want to ask me what you you know in the service just ask me and i'll you know i didn't cos i be like whatever but you know i could have ask him i could've say oh you know and he would have just calm me down and say something so i guess a lot of their job be quite behind the scenes stuff and we don't really see
S0300	mm mm no
S0262	everything we just see them kind of organise us
S0300	mm
S0262	but really they have to put quite a lot of effort into it
S0300	mm
S0262	cos there's families that must just fall apart
S0300	mm
S0262	and they have to keep it all together they've get to keep the show on the road
S0300	mm yeah
S0262	cos they've get to get those families out of the crematorium
S0300	yeah
S0262	they can't have them all
S0300	no sob in there
S0262	that's just
S0300	no
S0262	not good for anyone
S0300	no
S0262	so they have to keep everyone together but
S0300	no i mean i go to see my nan erm in in at the funeral place
S0262	mm
S0300	and i wish i hadn't
S0262	oh yeah i see i
S0300	she look normal
S0262	think it would be a bite weird
S0300	yeah i mean my mum want to go but she didn't wanna go on her own
S0262	yeah
S0300	nobody else would go with her so i kind of say i'd go with her but not mean i'd go
S0262	in with her
S0300	with her with her
S0262	yes
S0262	you'd wait outside yeah
S0300	no she take me in there and you know yes she can only see sort of from there upwards and it do look like my nan
S0262	yeah
S0300	erm but no it be just
S0262	yeah
S0300	well it just look like a waxwork
S0262	well this be it and
S0300	that's what she look like she look like a madame tussauds' waxwork you know
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	and i don't i mean i think it be about a week after she'd die cos i think after a certain time cos my niece and brother weren't allow to go and see a week before she be cremate
S0262	weren't allow
S0300	no
S0262	okay
S0300	no cos the body have start to
S0262	oh yes well it would yeah that's right yeah
S0300	er
S0262	yeah that's it yeah
S0300	so er yeah so they kind of stop you after about a week or so anyway
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	so it must have be within a week that we go to see my nan but i do i kind of i i won't do it again
S0262	no i i might do depend on the circumstances
S0300	yeah
S0262	like with my mum i do get to see her before she die but the thing be be that i saw her after she'd die so i actually do see her
S0300	yeah
S0262	and you know get to say goodbye and you know some people have this idea that the you know sort of just just after someone's die you know there be this sense of soul in the room
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	you know some religions be in to that buddhism be quite into it
S0300	mm
S0262	and that you can sit in the room and wait for the soul to pass on
S0300	that's it
S0262	and it can be something like forty eight hours
S0300	mm
S0262	and that's why some religions be really people sit and mourn and don't talk because they really believe that so
S0300	mm no no but yeah
S0262	so i be kind of into that idea but i think oh no you know well whatever
S0300	mm
S0262	and but when it come to mum i just think there's no point go back and have a look because really she wasn't herself when she die she didn't look anything like the mum i remember
S0300	no no
S0262	not at all
S0300	no
S0262	this be this be something completely different as in you know yeah why would you wanna have that last memory you really don't want to have that last memory you're probably better off just look at photos of when she be well well and
S0300	yeah
S0262	happy and
S0300	and happy you've get so many photos
S0262	yeah like those photos yeah
S0300	so
S0262	yeah exactly
S0300	you know and there's load in there and
S0262	mm
S0300	your dad's get them in his room and you know so yeah
S0262	yeah yeah it's better to have that
S0300	i think so
S0262	but i can see why it might be useful if particularly if you really hadn't see the person for a long time
S0300	yeah see i yeah
S0262	and they're someone very close to you
S0300	mm
S0262	i could see why there's that sense of closure
S0300	yeah
S0262	i don't know what it be about actually see someone but some people believe that you need to really go to start the grief process you it's like a trigger you need to see the person's pass on
S0300	yeah yeah cos i think my niece go to see her her mum three time
S0262	yeah to really believe it
S0300	to really yeah for it really to sink in
S0262	yeah to start the grief
S0300	to her head that her mum wasn't here
S0262	otherwise you're in limbo
S0300	yeah
S0262	and you can't start grieve yet
S0300	cos although you know they've go
S0262	yeah
S0300	and they're not come back
S0262	mm
S0300	but as you say there's something in your head that's tell you well i can still go and see my mum
S0262	yeah
S0300	and i can go and talk to my mum
S0262	yeah
S0300	you know so i just think until they're go go
S0262	yeah
S0300	so like after last sort of say once they they take that coffin away to everybody then it be over
S0262	yeah
S0300	cos you know no one be ever gonna see the coffin
S0262	no
S0300	or or her again
S0262	no that's right
S0300	so in in your head you can kind of like think this be it she have go and this be the end
S0262	it be yeah it's final yeah
S0300	and then you get you know i know you don't just get on with things but you you do start to start think a little bite more normally
S0262	yeah
S0300	and think you know well i've get to do this now and i've get to that that but
S0262	yeah well it you've get to get on with life
S0300	you have i know it sound harsh but as you say life go on you've get to get on with it
S0262	yeah yeah it be it be yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0300	you know you can't dwell on someone pass for the rest of your life
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	as i say you're always gonna think about it and and stuff but you know so no so in my eye as soon as that coffin have go last week life go on for everybody and everybody just start to laugh and as i say get all them i call them cancer stick cos i i i'm one of those erm i i smoke and give up
S0262	mm that's right yeah yeah
S0300	so i'm one of the really negative people
S0262	yeah
S0300	i always say i wouldn't do it my dad he give up and he be the most anti smoker go
S0262	yeah right
S0300	and now i be and sadly my eldest daughter do smoke
S0262	oh dear
S0300	i can't stop her
S0262	yeah do she smoke much
S0300	not really no she's more of a social smoker
S0262	yeah
S0300	or she might have a crave you know like er where be we we be out on saturday we go in erm to to tesco's and er as we're walk back to the car she's like ah just walk slow cos i need to have a fag she say and you won't let me smoke it in your car i say oh lord because it's just disgust
S0262	yeah
S0300	you know and i mean i be hypnotise
S0262	yeah
S0300	as well so to give up smoke so
S0262	so it really be bad for you
S0300	it really be
S0262	if you smell it it's like er
S0300	yeah you you sort of your subconscious have get this particular smell or taste
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	for a fag
S0262	yeah
S0300	so if i be to light up a fag and draw on it that that's the taste i would get or subconsciously i would get i mean whether it would work after ten years i don't know but
S0262	yeah yeah well probably
S0300	but the smell be horrific
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	d'you know i mean i hat the smell of fag when i do smoke
S0262	anyway yeah but now it's extra bad yeah
S0300	but er you know and and she like if she walk in the house and she's have one in her car and
S0262	you can smell it yeah
S0300	or it just it do it make me want to vomit
S0262	oh dear
S0300	so er but yeah she do smoke and erm but yeah they be all she she be one of them and they all smoke roll up as well and i just find roll up be so common
S0300	i'm not a snob but d'you know what it's not not the not common i think it's the sit there watch them roll it
S0262	roll up yeah
S0300	if you're gonna have a rolly then roll it before you go out
S0262	yeah
S0300	you know and just
S0262	yeah it's the whole roll up thing yeah
S0300	but they they be all sit along this wall
S0262	it's like a little production line
S0300	in the graveyard you know all on the wall and they be all sit there go
S0262	yeah
S0300	and put their ah i be just like what you know i think no if you you know say if if you're a rolly smoker then roll some up beforehand
S0262	yeah especially at an event like that you'd probably want to just have a quick one yeah
S0300	but that's all you saw all day be just people roll fag
S0262	gosh and how be your niece
S0300	d'you know what she i don't think i saw her cry once
S0262	yeah i think that's true you're so numb
S0300	she do kind of hold it together
S0262	yeah
S0300	she do like a speech thing
S0262	oh good for her
S0300	erm she do start to crumble a little bite when she do that but she didn't completely go
S0262	yeah
S0300	erm but no i don't think apart from that i didn't see her cry or look sad at even when the coffin be sit there in front of you outside in the car still hearse still you know there's me go ah you know and then she's just stand there just but then i think
S0262	you're so numb
S0300	yeah i think sort of say when everybody have go home cos everybody that be there from this end of the country erm we be all leave on the tuesday
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0300	so there would only have be her grandad her dad and her in the house
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	whereas prior to that she'd have friends stay and you know plenty of people there so i think it probably would have hit them all
S0262	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0300	quite hard on tuesday even by that time though i think they all might have be quite drink
S0262	yeah yeah yes yes that's
S0300	so it would've maybe hit them maybe wednesday thursday
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0300	erm and then apparently today as far as i know my niece be come back to with her grandad
S0262	oh good cos you be wonder if she be gonna
S0300	er for two weeks
S0262	oh good
S0300	and then my brother stay in plymouth
S0262	right
S0300	erm cos they've get two dog as well two little dog so and he's get his job there as well so he's there on his own
S0262	right yeah
S0300	which he's quite happy he's like me he's quite happy to be on his own
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	erm we be both of us
S0262	for some people it's quite good
S0300	we be not loners but we like our own company
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	erm
S0262	you need space
S0300	we like peace and quiet
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0300	er i don't like to be around too many
S0262	too much clatter yeah
S0300	people no
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	erm i think my mum's like that too i think it's just the fact that our head can't take
S0262	yeah
S0300	too much it's like if i go into a pub or some or into a shop and you can just hear all these voice
S0262	yeah
S0300	and music play
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	and my head just feel like it's gonna
S0262	yeah explode yeah
S0300	yeah so i just like to sit in my own silence and erm
S0262	yeah well it's very good it's sort of like meditate in a way isn't it
S0300	erm but it's i do i love it it's my way of
S0262	yeah
S0300	you know when i suffer with well i still do but not as badly but i do suffer with depression
S0262	oh okay
S0300	erm which i have a really bad bout at the begin of this year
S0262	oh right
S0300	and it only sort of finish about two months ago where it sort of pretty calm at the moment
S0262	okay
S0300	so i find sit on my own somewhere at home
S0262	yeah
S0300	be how i i deal with it if i'm have a bad day then i just say i'm have a bad day and i just go off and i sit on my own for hours
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0300	and people just know to leave me alone
S0262	oh that's good yeah
S0300	otherwise i will just start go rah rah rah
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	to them
S0262	yeah
S0300	erm and my brother's like that he's get depression too so it i think it must run in our generation cos no one other than my my brothers and my generation and then it's downwards from there that people seem to be suffer with depression in our family
S0262	mm mm i didn't realise it be hereditary
S0300	i don't think i don't know if it be or not it might just be but we seem to have
S0262	something that people have in common in your family
S0300	yeah but then say that doctor diagnose depression for everything nowadays
S0262	mm mm
S0300	and that annoy me because there's depression and there's be unhappy
S0262	yeah
S0300	and the i find they're two completely different things
S0262	yeah
S0300	cos depression make you do things that you wouldn't
S0262	normally do
S0300	normally do
S0262	no that's true yeah very out of character
S0300	i've experience one really out of character thing
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	but yeah erm but be unhappy and and miserable
S0262	yeah
S0300	be completely different because you're choose to be unhappy and miserable if you've get depression you're not actually choose to have it
S0262	you haven't get a choice
S0300	it's there
S0262	no yeah
S0300	and apparently when i saw a psychiatrist i've i've have it here since i be about fifteen
S0262	yeah i be gonna ask if you'd have it for
S0300	yeah it go back
S0262	can go back for quite
S0300	to when i be a teenager
S0262	a long time yeah
S0300	and the same with my brother
S0262	yeah
S0300	erm look back now we can we can work it back to when he be a kid
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	so erm
S0262	yeah yeah i i'm a big believer that it probably happen in the formative years
S0300	yeah yeah i mean it might the onset of it might come on
S0262	yeah
S0300	i mean my i've only be diagnose with it for three years
S0262	oh okay
S0300	so it's not very long at all
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	but
S0262	do you have any postnatal depression
S0300	no
S0262	no it wasn't that
S0300	no no which be what the psychiatrist ask cos he he want to see how far back he think it go
S0262	yeah
S0300	but i do have problems as a teenager at home and stuff and do some stupid things
S0262	like we all do
S0300	yeah
S0262	don't we
S0300	yeah erm so yeah so he's kind of take it back to the to like when i be about fourteen erm
S0262	mm mm and do you get pills like you know for it to manage it
S0300	they do give you anti depressants
S0262	yeah
S0300	which i do take but they they make your head go even more doolally sometimes so when i sort of like have a a bad flare up of it flare up's the wrong word but erm in the begin of this year erm i go to see a counsellor
S0262	oh okay
S0300	rather than take drug
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	and it be just a lady she be like it be like talk to my mum but she doesn't know anything about me
S0262	mm and she's not judge you yeah
S0300	erm and i would just no and i would just meet her once a week for an hour and that just seem to what she teach
S0262	wow just once a week for an hour
S0300	yeah
S0262	that's impressive
S0300	and what she teach me to do be she teach me to self medicate
S0262	oh
S0300	so she teach me how to get out of a situation
S0262	right
S0300	without need to see her or take drug and analyse things
S0262	yeah so like cop mechanisms right
S0300	yeah and then deal with it yourself
S0262	mm
S0300	basically and touch wood
S0262	that's pretty impressive isn't it
S0300	yeah i haven't see her for about six months
S0262	yeah and there's quite a lot you could have be kind of bring on depressions particularly around now
S0300	mm since then
S0262	yeah
S0300	i mean i have have bad days and i do i sit there and i think do i call her cos i've get her number so if ever i have a bad really really bad day i can always call her and talk to her over the phone but i haven't i i've just sort of as i say take myself off to a quiet area of the house
S0262	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0300	and then you just sort of like your brain go into overdrive and you start think this that and this that and this that
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	but you can you can self you know you can sort it out
S0262	yeah yeah that's good
S0300	if you put your mind to it see a lot of people be worse that what i be
S0262	yeah
S0300	i mean i'm a moderate depress have moderate depression
S0262	yeah
S0300	i don't have severe depression
S0262	no
S0300	if you've get severe depression then obviously yes you be on drug you be see a counsellor and you be see a psychiatrist
S0262	mm mm yeah
S0300	because i'm sort of like in the middle
S0262	yeah you can actually do that
S0300	erm i can actually
S0262	yeah do it yourself yeah
S0300	do it myself if i put my mind to it
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	and you you know you just sort of sit there and you think do you wanna go on drug
S0262	mm
S0300	i take too many already for other reason
S0262	mm mm yeah that's true
S0300	erm you know the fact i have to inhale an inhaler be get on my nerve cos it's just another thing that you've get to to think of do every day
S0262	mm yeah yeah yeah
S0300	erm but yeah so i do manage to cope
S0262	yeah that's good
S0300	erm but i do have to make it know to everybody in my family
S0262	yes they understand
S0300	that yeah you know
S0262	yeah
S0300	or or they'll turn around and say be you feel a bite low this week you know cos they've pick up on on certain clue like my my mum mum and dad would
S0262	mm your mood yeah yeah
S0300	give you the silent treatment
S0262	oh dear
S0300	so he can't deal with illness
S0262	right
S0300	or or anything so like when i have cancer when i be in hospital for my bowel disease when i have to go in to hospital like last thursday you know he he just cut you off
S0262	shut it out yeah it's too much
S0300	cos he he won't talk about it
S0262	right
S0300	and he can't talk about it cos he can't deal with illness
S0262	oh
S0300	so
S0262	mm
S0300	that's that's quite hurtful in a way because you feel like you need his support
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	but you know you're not gonna get it
S0262	oh gosh
S0300	and when i be go through the cancer he would talk to everybody about how upset he be and you know how he be worry and this that and the other but never once say it to me
S0262	but never to you
S0300	so you have to hear it from other people so although i know deep down he's think of you
S0262	mm
S0300	but he won't show you it because he's an emotionless person
S0262	okay right yeah yeah
S0300	so you know he's he doesn't know how to show emotion he wasn't bring up to be emotional or to show feel
S0262	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0300	so whereas we're completely different in that way you see i i mean i cry at the telly you know
S0262	yeah yeah yeah so do i yeah
S0300	i cry read a book
S0262	overly emotional sometimes
S0300	yeah i be i mean i'll be read a a magazine you know and it'll just be a a a two page story and i'll be like
S0262	yeah well up yeah
S0300	you know and i'm like whoa what be you do you know you know
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	erm so yeah i be highly emotional and one of my daughters be but the other one be emotionless like her dad
S0262	right right yeah interest so yeah
S0300	but they've both be bring up to have emotion
S0262	yeah
S0300	and and show it you know
S0262	i suppose one well the other one might just think it's easier not to show emotion
S0300	yeah see like with my asthma attack on friday it be quite quite a bad attack you know and i i do i think i be gonna die i be like
S0262	oh god
S0300	like that i couldn't breathe and i be on my own
S0262	oh
S0300	erm you know and i do go into panic mode
S0262	yeah i can imagine
S0300	i mean when i contact the eldest daughter and tell her what have happen she be like oh my god mum be you okay rah rah rah the youngest one she be like oh right well you look okay now then and that that's you see if they can't physically see anything wrong with you then
S0262	mm mm
S0300	there's nothing wrong with you
S0262	there's no reaction there's no response yeah
S0300	no i mean if i've get like erm i don't know a batter body or whatever you know you can see a bruise on my face or something it would make them think oh yeah she's you know
S0262	yeah
S0300	she's have a bite of a donk today
S0262	yeah yeah but if they can't see it
S0300	but because they yeah and because my when i be wheeze yeah they they could hear it so they be like oh you know she do sort of sometimes say oh do you need your inhaler or whatever but other than that there's nothing there so you know with you just have to to
S0262	yeah just let it be
S0300	yeah just get on with it
S0262	let it yeah i mean yeah i i find that really hard cos i'm not like that at all as a person
S0300	no see i'm not i mean 's get a cold
S0262	yeah
S0300	you know man flu
S0262	yeah
S0300	and even this morning i say oh i say how're you feel oh i say do you want me to get you some more lemsip no you know and i'm kinda he all he's get be a cold and i'm still sort of like say how you know how be you this morning sort of thing
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0300	but you know saturday morning i've wake up and i go like this and there's just nothing there
S0300	you know and i'm like i'm i'm die here
S0262	it's so funny isn't it
S0300	you know i'm go
S0300	i'm die here can you hear me you know and it's like hurry up then you know but there's just nothing
S0262	no i know it's some people be yeah
S0300	you know deep down inside there be but he just can't show it
S0262	yeah can't show it it's just too hard
S0300	and he say he wasn't bring up with it so you know it be
S0262	and i think it be more difficult for men because i know not necessarily but it depend on the generation they're bring into but i think like you know for my dad when i think about it he you know er the tradition be be that men don't cry
S0300	no
S0262	men don't get overly emotional
S0300	no
S0262	you know they're the ones to calm the womenfolk down you know
S0300	yeah
S0262	and all this sort of thing
S0300	and especially someone like your dad really cos he be in army wasn't he
S0262	the army yeah yeah so you're train
S0300	so yeah he's quite regimental
S0262	yeah you're train not to be emotional
S0300	yeah to have emotion
S0262	you're mean to be
S0300	yeah
S0262	unemotional
S0300	yeah but then i have see your dad cry
S0262	er yeah yeah and so have i
S0300	when when yeah when little pass away
S0262	yeah when mum yeah you know
S0300	and then obviously yeah and the year before that be your mum so but i remember come in on the tuesday he'd already email me and say that he'd he'd have to have him put to sleep and then i come in on the tuesday and the first thing your dad do be just stand there and burst into tear
S0262	yeah yeah just blub yeah
S0300	and put his arm round me
S0262	yeah
S0300	you know and then we both blub together
S0262	yeah
S0300	you know cos i i obviously i quite like love little he be just so sweet
S0262	he be wasn't he yeah
S0300	er you know i'm you know we we don't barely know each other
S0262	yeah that's right but
S0300	we be both stand in the middle of the room blubber you know in each other's arm
S0262	but we both know how each other felt which be the
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	important thing yeah yeah
S0300	so erm but yeah so even even men that have have it drum into them
S0262	oh they can be i mean my dad i think underneath the surface be highly emotional
S0300	yeah
S0262	it's just that he's not a shower you know
S0300	no see when you look at your dad and you hear hear your dad speak you'd think he be quite a stern not cold but a cool man
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	erm but he's not
S0262	no no
S0300	so you can never judge a book by its cover
S0262	no he's
S0300	cos like when i first meet your dad i think
S0262	he's scorpio if you believe in any of all that stuff that scorpio stuff he's highly emotional
S0300	yeah
S0262	it's just that he's learn how to
S0300	control it
S0262	control it yeah
S0300	yeah and
S0262	whereas i i don't see the point like i'm like oh let it go i'm in and out it's kind of like the tide you know
S0300	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	to me i can be up one down whatever but that's to me that's actually healthy
S0300	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	cos it's like your temperature
S0300	yeah
S0262	you're hot you're cold but somehow your body's gonna regulate it
S0300	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	if it's alright it's work okay and that's how i know if i'm actually alright cos if i can regulate my emotions
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	then i'm think okay i'm not lose the plot but if i can't
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	then i'm like oh that's what's so scary
S0300	well you're not normal be you
S0262	about when mum die
S0300	yeah
S0262	i be like this isn't me normally i'd be all over the place cry and like run around but i be numb and that be the first time in my life where i think i don't feel anything
S0300	yeah yeah feel right yeah
S0262	anything anything
S0300	yeah no
S0262	i didn't feel anything
S0300	no
S0262	i keep wait to feel something
S0300	yeah
S0262	and i be like it's gonna set in soon isn't it this grief
S0300	yeah
S0262	this whole thing be gonna happen soon isn't it then it be like oh but you can't force that either
S0300	no no
S0262	you just have to let that numbness kind of you know
S0300	no control over it like yeah
S0262	and that's obviously the shock
S0300	which i think be what my niece be go through now
S0262	such a shock to the system yeah
S0300	she's gonna come down here for two weeks and have a ball and she's go to be get so much attention and she's gonna be see so many people she's not go to have time to really grieve
S0262	mm no
S0300	so until she get back home
S0262	that's when it hit you
S0300	and then realise it's just her and her dad
S0262	yeah
S0300	then by that time would have be in his grieve process
S0262	yeah yeah maybe maybe not
S0300	maybe not though cos again he's
S0262	he might wait until she get back
S0300	yeah
S0262	cos everyone's a bite funny like that
S0300	yeah
S0262	you know i've notice now that since i've get back to because i think live in australia mean that i didn't actually know i know that my mum die but i didn't feel it as keenly because i wasn't live in the house or see dad or or whatever so now be back for three months i'm quite aware of the fact that i've be grieve like what i would say quite in depth grief
S0300	no you wasn't here no no yeah
S0262	which isn't deal with the superficial bits which you deal with you know when someone initially die be you actually go through the whole emotional almost your whole life of emotion in a way
S0300	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0262	and i'm sure dad's go through the same because he's call me a couple of time
S0300	yeah have he ah
S0262	and he's acknowledge that but i can also see that in some respect me be here be kind of trigger bits of grief for him
S0300	grief off yeah course it be
S0262	which he may have keep on tap until he could get someone who be emotional enough like me to kind of get that erm grief go around the system
S0300	yeah that yeah yeah
S0262	cos some people will just hold on to it
S0300	just hold on yeah
S0262	because they actually have no idea what to do with it otherwise
S0300	no
S0262	they don't know how to channel it
S0300	no
S0262	so i feel like i'm the catalyst and it's quite painful because it's painful for him it's painful for me and it's you know painful for and you know he really love my mum too
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	and he miss her and you know you you also all of those things bring back other things
S0300	mm
S0262	that have be painful in your life whether it's be someone's death or not but it can also trigger i can see how it can actually be in a way i'm try to say sometimes it's like that say isn't it to be cruel to be kind but it's not really what i mean
S0300	yeah mm yeah no
S0262	sometimes you have to go through those really hard patch to kind of everyone move on
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	i don't mean move on from my mum's death but just kind of get through some of the crappy stuff so you can clear that and make way for some better stuff
S0300	no yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0262	that's mean to be come your way
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	cos i notice that with my mum that she hold on to erm really quite negative emotions i think about her dad which i talk about go to see my mum's half sister
S0300	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	who's lovely welsh woman
S0300	ah
S0262	she be absolutely adorable her name be and i'm i really like her a lot she great she's really great
S0300	ah
S0262	and we spend hours talk like a couple of hours erm at her home but i tell her that cos they share the same dad
S0300	yeah
S0262	but unfortunately be at the time be illegitimate you know not that anybody really mind now any more cos there's no such thing really in a way be there
S0300	no no no no
S0262	illegitimacy doesn't really
S0300	no
S0262	in our modern day doesn't really exist
S0300	no
S0262	so but in her day back in the nineteen forties it certainly do
S0300	yeah
S0262	and erm so they share the same father and erm and it must have be that erm her mum put it this way my granny probably get divorce because her mum come on the scene
S0300	right
S0262	and that's probably what trigger that divorce
S0300	yeah
S0262	yeah but then her you know who's who's my grandad and 's dad
S0300	yeah
S0262	he go on to have a second child with erm with her mum
S0300	yeah
S0262	so it wasn't just like a flash in the pan thing
S0300	no it wasn't just a a bite of yeah
S0262	but they actually have a boy as well as he have she have a brother so mum would've have a half brother half sister but half brother quite sure i don't think he's all that interest but definitely be and and i say to i say well you know the thing about it be be that my mum really harbour major like hatred it be hatred
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	because she love him really but what she hat him for be that he reject her and he didn't love her back and as a kid you can completely understand that you know this be from an early age
S0300	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0262	she be like under ten she's get the picture dad's not interest in me doesn't love me move on to somebody else
S0300	no no mm
S0262	so she keep that for way too long like you know way too long we would talk about it and i'd go mum really this one you've get to put to bed it's no good for you it's no good for you for your your health it's no good for your mental space it's no good for anyone's relationships you've get to put it to bed i keep try to convince her nothing and you know i really do think that yeah she she it's really weird i don't know if i tell you the story but i be tell my i have a massage before i get on the plane to come back to here when i know my mum be die cos i think i've get to chill right out because it's gonna be like twenty eight hour flight i'm not quite sure touch and go with mum
S0300	yeah mm mm
S0262	and er so anyway so i tell her that my you know my mum be die and erm she the masseur say erm oh do she have erm oh do she worry a lot and i say yeah my mum worry like crazy about everyone everything and er she say oh do she have like spleen or do she have cancer in the spleen or something like this i go it well not spleen but pancreas very nearby and she say mm and i go why and this wasn't even before she start massage me cos i think i be very emotional and er and i say why be that and she go well that's the thing about anger if you store it you think about the spleen be that when we think about anger
S0300	yeah
S0262	you can see where part and this be the chinese they're all into this they think the whole thing and the body and and and my way of say to myself that it's okay to let my anger show sometimes not too much but sometimes it's healthy because when i think about how my mum keep this
S0300	yeah yeah mm bottle up
S0262	negative emotion it must have get into her system somewhere and store somewhere it store in the pancreas
S0300	mm
S0262	now i know that's a leap of faith from cancer to whatever but all i know be it's teach me a lesson
S0300	mm mm
S0262	in my mind which be deal with it because there's no point hold on to it
S0300	mm no
S0262	whatever grudge be i i don't think it really cause cancer all i'm say be that in my mind grudge aren't gonna help you
S0300	no
S0262	i think that's the thing you know
S0300	yeah
S0262	you know
S0300	yeah
S0262	that's what i've learn
S0300	yeah
S0262	i think from my mum
S0300	yeah
S0262	and and she really do begrudge her dad and i just think it's such a shame because have now speak to she never have a particularly erm strong relationship with her father though he give her away at her wed
S0300	right
S0262	em but she doesn't really have any emotions to him one way or the other she's actually quite indifferent
S0300	mm
S0262	and i think that be quite interest
S0300	mm
S0262	and er but you know she say that's the thing i don't hate him but then again i don't love him
S0300	no
S0262	he's my father and i recognise that and he recognise me as his daughter but that's it and i think in a way that's actually alright isn't it cos you're neither one
S0300	or the other
S0262	or the other you're not gonna be disappoint
S0300	no
S0262	but then you're not gonna be you know erm think that he's somebody that he that he's not
S0300	yeah that he's not no no
S0262	or want he's dead now so in a way that's quite a
S0300	mm
S0262	good way of deal with stuff and i think mm
S0300	mm yeah
S0262	i wonder if i could take this new kind of indifferenceness to things you know rather than go hot and cold hot and cold hot and cold
S0300	yeah yeah gosh yeah just stay the same all the time
S0262	just kind of oh well that's life just
S0300	yeah just
S0262	it's all go to pass
S0300	i've always always say to my girls i say you don't have to it's like with family i say you don't have to like them
S0262	no
S0300	but you should always love them
S0262	yeah
S0300	erm which we do get quite a lot of in our it's like with i mean i've freely say to him i say i don't like you
S0262	yeah
S0300	very much i say but i do love you with all my heart
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	you know and you don't have to like a person it's like your i mean my girls don't like
S0262	yeah
S0300	they they make out
S0262	they're not close yeah
S0300	but yeah they be close that's the well they be and they aren't
S0262	oh right
S0300	they they make out that they can't get on
S0262	yeah
S0300	but they can
S0262	they can it's the choice they make
S0300	you know and they just choose to be bitchy to each other every time the you know like
S0262	it's easier to be a bitch that not to be yeah
S0300	yeah and also if you're be a bitch you're be listen to
S0262	yeah you're get attention
S0300	if yeah if you're just sit there have a like say for example today if i be to walk in and both the girls be there if they be sit there have a proper conversation
S0262	yeah
S0300	then i would ignore them
S0262	yeah
S0300	but if i be to walk in and they're go like this they're both go to get attention
S0262	yeah you'd stop them yeah that's right yeah yeah
S0300	cos i'm gonna shout at both of them to shut up
S0262	yeah yeah so they're still vie for mummy's attention really
S0300	yeah and it be it's all an attention thing
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	er and you know and they'll say of well i hate her and it's like i hate her and i say like it's fine to hate
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	although hate be a harsh word
S0262	yeah
S0300	dislike be really the better word
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	but it's alright to hate somebody but if they're your family you whatever you should still love them
S0262	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0300	you know so this but i don't know i don't know how you can
S0262	yeah yeah i don't think you can i think
S0300	i don't think you
S0262	the way that people
S0300	i don't think you can you not like someone and not love them but still
S0262	yeah i think a lot of it's to do with respect
S0300	mm
S0262	i think that tend to help
S0300	i think that's a major thing be be respect
S0262	yeah i think if you can at least respect someone
S0300	somebody
S0262	and they can respect you then love might come follow from that
S0300	mm might come with it yeah
S0262	but if you haven't get respect but you're still demand love and i think that happen with a lot of parent actually they demand love from their kid
S0300	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	but the kid don't respect them
S0300	no
S0262	it's like
S0300	no
S0262	what what happen there you know
S0300	yeah
S0262	and i think that's an awful shame
S0300	yeah
S0262	i don't know why the kid don't respect their parent
S0300	no cos mine my mine do and don't i mean i my mum flip at me the other weekend in front of the girls i don't know what cause her to have this mental breakdown
S0262	right
S0300	we be talk about something and she be convince she be right and i know that i be right
S0262	mm
S0300	so i be try to explain how i know i be right
S0262	yeah
S0300	and as i'm try to explain she's talk over me and in the end she just go will you shut the up
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	now my mum have never swear at me
S0262	oh
S0300	and i've never swear at my mum
S0262	so she must be stress yeah
S0300	and she say it twice
S0262	oh dear
S0300	not just once i say don't speak to me like that and she say just shut the and she say it again and er i sit there like with my mouth open cos i be like
S0262	yeah
S0300	and then it all kick off and i say and i just turn around and say well obviously you don't have any respect for me then
S0262	mm that's true that's a good point
S0300	i say to swear at me like that in front of my kid
S0262	yeah yeah that's not that doesn't show respect yeah
S0300	i say i would never ever ever swear at my parent i mean i know i'm not the parent i'm the daughter but i wouldn't swear at my kid like that
S0262	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0300	not i i do swear
S0262	but the point be be that you're she's still your mum she can't let the side down
S0300	yeah so i didn't swear back
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	how i don't know cos i do swear
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	and if someone really pee me off i will just keep go and go and go but i didn't swear once and and it after it have all calm down i mean my mum do apologise and say i be totally out of order i don't know what happen there de de de de de
S0262	mm yeah
S0300	erm my eldest sit there and say my god i say what and she say i really i really don't respect you do i and i go well no and
S0262	oh she'd see something where she recognise yeah okay
S0300	yeah cos i because i say i would never speak to my mum
S0262	yeah
S0300	the way my mum have speak to me erm because i respect my mum too much
S0262	yeah
S0300	then realise that she maybe doesn't speak to me the way she should speak to me
S0262	yeah
S0300	and doesn't show me the respect that she should not that it's make any difference
S0262	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0300	but she she kind of sit there and register my god i don't respect my mum
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	and maybe as she get older she will now learn to you know cos everybody in this everybody seem to swear at everybody swear be swear be the norm but it's what context it's take in now i i can be have a conversation it my my mum and a and an f word will slip into sentence but it's not aim at my mum you see
S0262	yeah mm mm no
S0300	it's in the conversation
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	erm what my mum do be she aim the f word bang at me erm
S0262	at you yeah it be it be aggressive style and
S0300	yeah and obviously have aim swear word at me in anger
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0300	erm and maybe she think you know well my mum moan about her mum all the time but she's never swear at her and she's never say anything horrible to her face mean i moan about my mum all the time to people
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0300	because she do my head in
S0262	yeah
S0300	i wouldn't sit there you know she do she
S0262	like most mums do
S0300	yeah she's serious i mean i moan about everybody because and people moan about me you know but they don't moan to me to my face
S0262	yeah yeah no
S0300	erm and like i wouldn't say to my mum to her face what i'm say behind her back which doesn't make me two face
S0262	no
S0300	it just mean i've get more respect for my mum
S0262	yeah
S0300	to speak to her
S0262	yeah
S0300	the way i'm think about her
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	you know i can sit here and say my god you're really piss me off and blah blah blah blah
S0262	yeah
S0300	you know and be really horrible
S0262	yeah
S0300	but i wouldn't be able to do that to her face
S0262	no no
S0300	erm i wouldn't do it to my dad you know i wouldn't do it to anybody
S0262	no you're right you're right and i think that these be learn responses that probably happen from when when you be really small and then also your daughters as well erm and i think that it's really hard once you've get into a kind of habit to break out of that habit
S0300	mm yeah
S0262	particularly because you be so close in the family and it's almost like you don't have any way out
S0300	yeah and
S0262	you know
S0300	also with my girls it's more like a friendship rather than a mum daughter thing
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	because like if my mum and perhaps you with your mum it be a proper mother daughter thing
S0262	yeah
S0300	you know we i mean yeah i've go shop with my mum and do things with my mum
S0262	yeah
S0300	but what i do with my girls be so much more than what my mum do or want to do with me
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	so with me it be it be just a mother daughter relationship and we we fight like cat and dog
S0262	mm
S0300	with the girls it's not like that you see there's too much friendship there rather than mother daughter ship
S0262	mm mm mm mm mm
S0300	so it's it's hard cos
S0262	yeah
S0300	and i think that's why the
S0262	yeah cos they may not see the boundaries
S0300	yeah and i think that's why the respect and that isn't there be because they're look at me how they would look at a friend
S0262	yeah
S0300	and treat me cos that's what i say to them i say i'm not one of your friends from down the road i'm your mum
S0262	yeah yeah but even then they should have respect for your their their friends so even if they classify you as a friend they should still have respect
S0300	yes yeah but then they don't because all they do be moan about everybody
S0262	right oh right
S0300	so and that's what i do i stand there and i go well i dread to think what you say about me to people
S0300	if that's how you talk about your friends
S0262	yeah
S0300	d'you know and they say oh we never bad mouth you well you know they do
S0262	yeah that's right
S0300	we've all we've all go off to our mat and say oh i hate my mum she's this she's that rah rah rah
S0262	yeah
S0300	you know we've all do it erm
S0262	of course we have yeah
S0300	and i know my kid be no different i mean you know they they must text it to people rather than say it you know
S0262	yeah
S0300	erm but yeah i mean i know if i have an if i have a to do with one of my kid the first thing they do be de de de de on their phone and i'm think i wonder who they're put me down to now
S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	d'you know what it's just
S0262	and that's the thing about mobile technology
S0300	you can't hear them
S0262	be that well and and but then you see they can vent whereas before like you know if i be with my mum and we'd have a row or something you know i'd go up to my room and i'd sulk and then i'd go okay well this be quite bore so i'd come back down and start talk to her normally and then we'll have a kiss and make up and say sorry
S0300	yeah yeah yeah that's what my two do do yeah
S0262	you know a but they're you know i hardly ever bad mouth my mum to to anybody
S0300	no
S0262	first of all i didn't have the chance and i don't think anybody of my friends really want to hear it
S0300	no no you see as a kid as a kid i didn't
S0262	no
S0300	i mean i i probably
S0262	they weren't actually that interest
S0300	no i probably moan
S0262	they're more interest in me than my mum if you know what i mean
S0300	yeah more about my mum now than i would have do as a kid
S0262	yeah
S0300	so yeah i don't think as a but nowadays as you say they've get these phone and
S0262	they can yeah they blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
S0300	and they're constantly ch ch you know they're on ipads or
S0262	and and if you think about all the time if that be actually something that's go on in your life year after year after year after year after year that then become a habit and that then become something that you you realise be a crutch cos you get immediate responses back oh really you've have a fall out with your mum ah
S0300	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0262	so you're not deal with anything you're just kind of respond
S0300	no no yeah
S0262	and you're just kind of either block or allow things in i find that i think about you know young people and i think oh god i really don't envy them at all
S0300	mm mm
S0262	when i think about how hard it be for them today to grow up with all that stuff
S0300	mm mm
S0262	body image
S0300	yeah
S0262	cos it's all over the place it's not like just advert like we use to you and i use to see on television we'd go oh she's pretty or whatever la la la
S0300	yeah yeah no yeah yeah
S0262	or in a few magazines
S0300	yeah
S0262	if you can just go oh well i'll just close that down
S0300	yeah
S0262	but now it's actually it's the internet it's all the social kind of media it's everything that they do
S0300	yeah yeah yeah
S0262	it's all about body image
S0300	yeah
S0262	and it do have a major effect on girls
S0300	it do yeah
S0262	particularly girls
S0300	but then both my girls be quite big girls
S0262	right
S0300	which be weird
S0262	but they but they don't seem to have that kind of issue then well thank god for that then because some do
S0300	no no they i think at school they do as as i mean they're not adult i don't class them as adult adults but they're sort of like not in the the teenage thing but no they
S0262	good
S0300	they no they're they've never
S0262	i'm glad to hear that
S0300	i mean i i don't remember ever think i wanna be skinny like that model in that magazine when i be a kid
S0262	yeah
S0300	and we've always 's kind of like he do have this thing about bigger people
S0262	right
S0300	erm and he's always say to me if you get if you get you know we'll be watch the telly and he'll joke and say mm you look you're get a bite like that now
S0262	oh god
S0300	and i say cheeky git and you know it's only a joke
S0300	but i kind of say to him well what would you do if i be like a size eighteen to twenty then you'd be out the door
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0300	so you know image be a thing for
S0262	oh god yeah
S0300	so and i be the smallest one and i'm not small but i'm the smallest one in my house
S0262	right
S0300	because both my girls be but they're they're funny shape
S0262	yeah
S0300	now 's like up here the youngest one she's like her dad but she's and she's quite butch

S0300	erm she's not fat at all she's not at all she's get a jelly belly that's it the rest of her body be all in the proportion with her height so she's but she's big frame girl
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0300	erm and if she didn't have long hair from behind you'd think she be a bloke
S0300	she walk just like her dad as well now i don't quite know where she's come from but she's my height
S0262	yeah
S0300	but she's quite a bite wider than me and she's get a very big jelly belly but she's get thighs like that
S0262	right
S0300	they're i've never see thighs i mean i do say to her at one point you need to go to the doctor's cos that must be some medical problem
S0262	some medical condition
S0300	but then i watch but then i watch telly and a lot of these young girls for some unknown reason have these i mean they they they
S0262	big thighs
S0300	bump yeah they bump out

S0262	the only problem with that be the diseases that come later with it yeah
S0300	yeah well see now 's complain she's always get sore ankles i say well that's because of all the weight you're carry on top

S0262	yeah yeah
S0300	and you know she's always out of breath she's always complain that her joint be hurt and i say it's purely because

S0300	no
S0262	but yeah definitely what they would say obese

S0300	he may have do
S0262	if you like your life you're go about it all the wrong way erm as in stay about for a little while longer
S0300	right
S0262	and erm and then he and then he just say listen you need to really lose some weight and she go on this cambridge diet where it's one that before you go and have the she's not go to have her stomach erm erm clamp whatever it's call
S0300	no
S0262	she's not actually gonna have it but it's the one that they give the people who do need to
S0300	right
S0262	furiously lose weight
S0300	to lose yeah
S0262	so she's lose it all lose lose lose lose haven't see her in a couple of months erm and then what they do cos she go once a month er once a week to get erm like i think more like counsel
S0300	yeah
S0262	he's actually there to sort of talk about the weight but it's a bite more like pep you up
S0300	mm
S0262	you know keep go keep go
S0300	mm mm
S0262	and she's do really really well erm and then they're go to reform her eat habit so that she's actually eat all the right things so then they can allow her to keep er slowly put the calories back on but it's calories with exercise
S0300	mm mm mm yeah yeah
S0262	so that she can maintain some sort of decent weight for the rest of her life you know until you get a bite old and you can't do stuff but that sound to me like okay quite radical you've you've get to lose it
S0300	yeah yeah yeah no yeah yeah
S0262	you know and she have
S0300	yeah
S0262	but then that just go to show how much she didn't need to be eat
S0300	yeah yeah
S0262	calorie wise
S0300	and then now she can control her calories
S0262	and then she can eat normally
S0300	yeah
S0262	you know she have have to have all those protein drink and whatnot because you do have to have that if you need to lose weight quickly there's just no way around it
S0300	yeah yeah no
S0262	otherwise you're not eat anything
S0300	no
S0262	but the things be be that she say the good thing be that i will then be able to have you know calorie control normal food
S0300	yeah
S0262	and have that for the rest of my life but just not eat crap
