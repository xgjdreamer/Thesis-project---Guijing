S0530	okay
S0529	yeah
S0530	that's not too bad i'm just imagine like a fifty five year old
S0529	i mean it might be a different person but i i don't really know
S0530	i think it be it yeah how long do each one last
S0529	erm i'm try to think how long be on for i think it be like my first appointment be about half an hour maybe
S0530	okay
S0529	yeah cos i do the first thing i do i do on computer
S0530	mm
S0529	you have to do that and then she take through that and then you talk about your probs and then it usually last like so like twenty five to half an hour i'd say
S0530	okay so i'll be able to go to my lecture at eleven then
S0529	yeah yeah definitely yeah it won't it won't take that long
S0530	god i be gonna say cos i be like mm
S0530	cos sometimes initial assessments take like an hour but
S0529	no i don't think it will
S0530	i don't think it will
S0529	well even if it do you still have time to like
S0530	yeah to run up
S0529	yeah
S0530	anyway i'm fine let's talk about
S0529	no no i didn't mean it i didn't mean i wasn't silence because
S0530	no no no no no i mean as in like
S0529	i just like i don't know what to fuck say to be honest like
S0530	no yeah hashtag
S0529	i'd rather talk about you to be honest
S0530	hey then if we talk about me it's gonna ignore all of your shit and then
S0529	i don't care i wanna ignore all my shit
S0530	it's not gonna happen no that's
S0530	you shouldn't ignore the shit because purely you want to
S0529	no but i also care about what what's go on in your life as well i do give a shit
S0530	i i care more about you
S0529	well that's stupid of you
S0530	why
S0529	because
S0530	it's stupid of you to care more about me
S0529	yeah but you're not a lose cause
S0530	i'm not a lose
S0530	i think i be a lose cause for like
S0529	you're not you're not a lose cause
S0530	i don't think you be a lose cause
S0529	mm
S0530	despite it you've felt like this for a long time doesn't mean you're like a lose cause it doesn't mean that you know you can be experience something for a long time and feel a certain way but it doesn't mean you should well you feel more incline to give up but
S0529	mm
S0530	you know
S0529	yeah
S0530	cos i guess i guess it be easier if say like it's be like a sudden slide but with you it hasn't really have it like you've felt like this for a while
S0530	and you've have a lot of time like to yourself which be gonna make it kind of more difficult to get back like like for you now like the abnormal be normal
S0529	mm
S0530	so like not do be the norm which isn't your fault at all
S0530	because literally like i've be there and it's
S0529	yeah
S0530	horrible because you can't do anything like even if you try
S0529	i know i i'm really want to like kill myself earlier like honestly
S0530	oh
S0529	but it just it's just so stupid as well like there's just no reason to think like that
S0530	it's not stupid
S0529	cos i mean i do think like that and it's fine cos i don't
S0530	cos it affect it it all affect your brain yeah
S0529	i know
S0529	it really do it must do because it's just like there's no logical reason for you to be think like that otherwise you know
S0530	cos if you think about it like you know it's it's an impairment
S0529	yeah
S0530	it's a disability like it's stop you from function normally and not normally but you know what i mean it it stop you from function as you would be if you be healthy
S0529	mm
S0530	you know and that's hard it's not to say that you can't be healthy again but like this isn't how it's gonna be for ever and ever but to actually get rid of it well not get rid of it but to be able to control it and get into like a stage where you can cope with it or even see it as maybe less powerful than it be you know like i know it's quite like typical to say oh yeah you just have to beat it i'm not that kind of person that's like you have to push past this
S0530	and you have to keep try but like the more you let it kind of the thing be like it it make you think that it's you that doesn't wanna do anything
S0529	yeah
S0530	which be really horrible isn't it because like
S0529	i feel like it's my fault and i don't know whether that be true or not
S0530	it's not your fault
S0529	like i really don't any more like the way my family be like like talk to me it sound as though it be my fault and then i felt really awful about it and that's when i be like
S0530	i mean from the outside people do think well people can think it's your fault because the symptoms of it be just like you don't want to do things
S0529	i think it be
S0530	but it's how be it your how be your fault that you feel like this
S0529	i don't know because this be just how i be like i've just this be just my personality now it's not even it doesn't even feel like it's you know there's something wrong with my brain it's just the way i be
S0530	i think you can be a cynical person
S0530	and be able to get out of bed and be able to feel able to do things i don't think there's correlation that much correlation there i think you can be somebody that like it's not i don't i don't think it's just because you might have a negative view of things
S0529	yeah
S0530	like it might help like it might've contribute to it but i'm i'm certain that just because like you're maybe not as like mm you've get such like a spiritual outlook of the world some people have you know it doesn't it doesn't mean that like you know cos it's not it's not part of your personality to be like constantly like upset and constantly worry like outside factor contribute to that it's not just like oh i'm so i'm like this it's not and i know how it just it just feel permanent and it suck but it's not i mean like you've say that over summer you didn't feel very good like when you be at home like do do it feel it obviously didn't feel very good but do it feel like less stressful than this because you didn't actually have responsibility then or be your family onto you so it be pretty hard
S0529	i mean it be stressful in a different way like it be
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	erm the stake be a lot higher
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	you know if i get if if things fall apart here then like that's just really bad because
S0530	mm
S0529	you know there's a lot of money involve here and there be a lot of serious
S0530	oh god there's definitely a lot of money
S0529	important things involve here like that would be affect if i decide to fuck things up which i have do but whereas at home it be like if i if i like act out or something the only thing that would affect would be like my family
S0530	mm
S0529	and that do upset me but it didn't no it do stress me out but like like like in a different way like yeah i dunno i just feel like i'm gonna feel like this wherever i go really and i'm always gonna have the same pressure from my family
S0530	do they want you to do really well or do they just want you to do stuff all the time
S0529	i don't i don't even know any more
S0530	be that what
S0529	they want me to do well up here cos they think i can
S0530	mm
S0529	they think i have it in me and i really don't it's not
S0530	it isn't
S0529	it cos
S0530	cos it's not that you're not capable of get good grade that you're not smart it's because right now you're not in the right position to be able to apply yourself
S0529	yeah
S0530	that isn't it's not fair and it's not that be not your fault
S0530	and maybe when you actually start get like proper regular help and let it kick in a bite
S0529	no but that's just not happen here it's just not happen it's like i
S0530	mm
S0529	if i make another appointment it would take a week at least
S0530	to actually be they not like regular slot in or anything like that
S0529	no
S0530	why
S0529	well cos on on friday i go to like the acute kind of thing because that's the only way you can get a faster appointment at the doctor's so i do that and i go to see a nurse and then she make me an appointment for yesterday which i obviously miss
S0530	mm
S0529	and that's the problem like and i haven't call them back because i don't have any signal and i haven't be outside but if i be to call them back they would tell me like this be when the next appointment's available or you'd have to go through the acute team again
S0530	oh my god
S0529	and back to where you come from and it's just
S0530	that's crazy
S0529	it's just straight back to square one and it's really frustrate and they don't give you like repeat appointments like all the time and the counsel appointment's like once every friday
S0530	oh god
S0529	and it's like why would you put it at the end of the week you know it's just fuck stupid i get one appointment every week and it's on friday and it's with a woman who want me to
S0530	leave
S0529	to leave
S0530	yeah
S0529	and also like do cbt like try things during the week that i just can't cope with most of the time because i'm too worry about everything else and it's just not helpful
S0530	what's the sort of thing she ask you to do
S0529	i don't know so even like difficult stuff it's just basic things like get out of bed and eat properly and go for walk and it's just not helpful at the minute
S0530	mm
S0529	it's not what i want
S0530	i think a bad of it well the part of that's probably really hard be that like it feel like there's too much now to actually control
S0529	yeah it feel really out of my hand
S0530	like those yeah
S0529	i feel like i've mess it up way too much i really have do a really good job of fuck stuff up for myself so far
S0530	and it can still be
S0529	i don't think it can
S0530	i think it can
S0529	i
S0530	i think it cos it's go on in your life and because it affect you like more than anybody and because obviously you're stress you're stress and you're anxious about everything that you're not do or things that you've do like from look at it from the outside i'm sure a lot of students have be in this situation you've not commit any crimes
S0530	you've not go to your lecture because you felt depress you've not hand in assignments because not function you've you've not be able to function or to do the work and if you think about it that's it like i know that's big it's important but it's not as many individual problems as you think and it's not like i'm sure the lecturers here will've have experience with students like that like these be common problems
S0529	yeah
S0530	they're horrible problems but they're common
S0529	yeah
S0530	erm i'm sure a degree level student particularly at their first time away it's usually like the worst like the first time you go to university if you have any problems you'll have them in your first year
S0529	well that's the point of first year isn't it
S0530	mm
S0529	to be and to adjust
S0530	exactly like you can fuck up in first year a little bite
S0530	like obviously you've gotta get the forty percent pass mark but i think it allow you a bite of leeway to like and i know it's not just miss assignments and miss someone else's problem it's actually when like sit down do the work and
S0529	yeah
S0530	actually think about it
S0529	and i have this intense fear of just do it wrong and and get feedback and then read my work and
S0530	i know
S0529	think it's awful because i just that's what i think like every time i read anything i've ever write i hate it
S0530	have have it always felt like that
S0529	can't stand it it's always felt like that yeah i've always felt like that about read stuff that i've write
S0530	mm yeah
S0529	that i can't read my own essay i can't do it
S0530	no same i hate look back at them
S0529	i've never actually read one all the way through i just hope that i've spell everything right i do spell check i don't read through it because i can't
S0530	mm
S0529	i physically like i my body seize up like i get i get like really tense
S0530	tense yeah
S0529	and i can't look at it and then like when i get feedback i just i just get like a cold sweat and i can't look at it and it's just not good cos you know you need feedback and i just don't wanna do it wrong
S0530	mm cos it it it definitely do sound like that like
S0529	i mean i don't think i can do it right
S0530	you would well not be good enough for it
S0529	yeah
S0530	like cos in my head i feel like i'm not good enough but also i've get this other expectation of you can't you can't do it badly you have to do it well
S0530	the good thing be though like
S0530	i know i've be say this all along but be first year at uni it's no necessarily about excel academically
S0529	yeah
S0530	it's get your life together and get start a new life basically and have you know have such like kind of learn a new way of live which be the biggest thing the most important thing about first year like focus on your study like if you wanna aim for a really high grade in your second and third year just work really hard but first year be about just get use to the experience and get to know people and join stuff and just i mean that's supposedly why it's like not everyone have a load of fun at uni in first year but that's probably why they say like you'll have the time of your life because it's just
S0530	a new experience and it's not in the first year completely academically centre even though at because we have a big amount of subject it feel like it it's
S0529	yeah
S0530	cos we have quite a lot of contact like do you feel like you've get quite a lot of contact hours
S0529	yeah
S0530	so i'm sure that's like add stress as well because it feel like you're in all the time
S0529	and then you also have all the group stuff as well
S0530	mm
S0529	it feel like contact hours to me cos you have to go with your group
S0530	i mean it it sound like that might be a big part of it
S0529	oh that be annoy yeah
S0530	the worry about the presentations and the crap
S0529	yeah
S0530	mm
S0529	but i mean there's no way around that i can't just stamp my feet and be like i don't wanna do it i can't i don't wanna be in group you can't do that here like you have to do it
S0530	be this gonna be every week for the whole year
S0529	i don't know i don't i think so
S0530	or at the moment because it's very strange that
S0529	yeah
S0530	like you'd expect maybe a few time in the year but not every week i mean that be a big ask
S0529	yeah exactly it be i just i just wish i'd not choose this degree
S0530	i mean in term of choose a degree like i totally see where you're come from now because obviously it doesn't have to be the most like if you if you don't really feel that inspire by anything you still have to i think to an extent be able to want to face it you know and
S0529	yeah
S0530	with english you don't seem to feel like that like you don't even wanna do it
S0529	no
S0530	like do you think there's not even anything you're interest in but be there anything you could find maybe more accessible do you know what i mean like
S0529	yeah
S0530	as in like you'd maybe oh yeah i could try and write an essay on that or i could try i could i'd actually go to a lecture and be like i'd take some of that in kind of thing like because i'm sure there be
S0529	well this be what i think english would be i i hop that i would you know interest
S0530	be your that'd be your subject yeah
S0529	yeah that i would be able to kind of tap into what i like about it at a level and be like oh yeah this be interest and i can do this like
S0530	mm
S0529	but it just hasn't happen yet and there isn't another subject that i can think of that would that would be accessible
S0530	mm
S0529	for me i just don't know
S0530	do your mind
S0529	and i can't humanities
S0530	oh yeah
S0529	and there's nothing else be there sorry what be you say
S0530	do your mind feel a bite like foggy that's why you
S0529	yeah
S0530	can't learn
S0529	mm
S0530	because often if you get the right medication which my problem be the fogginess it can clear it can help like it can make your brain like untangle a bite like
S0529	yeah
S0530	and i think actually medication might help you in that way like honestly you've gotta do the stuff yourself which suck and it's hard and it's horrible but it actually make it slightly easier
S0529	yeah
S0530	like you're you're drive through a mist rather than like a thick fog if you get me
S0529	mm
S0530	like it's still obviously there but it's not as like impair so
S0529	i'm so glad you get the fog thing cos i
S0530	yeah oh my god
S0529	i say that to my sister and my mum and they're like and they just don't get it
S0530	no no
S0530	but it it it feel like you've just be like imagine a car that's be just sit in a field in fog for like
S0530	forty years
S0530	that be how i feel
S0529	yeah
S0530	quite a lot of the time
S0529	i get that as well
S0530	and it's really hard when you wanna try and do work or write essay because you can't really look outside of your head
S0529	yeah
S0530	and it's horrible and oh but yeah what do who be who be you on the phone to your mum or your sister or everyone
S0529	i be on i be on the phone to my sister at first
S0530	okay
S0529	and then we have a bite of a yeah like
S0530	a little row
S0529	well not really it be just more of me like just no know what to say to her any more and so i just sort of say right i'm gonna go now and then she ring my apparently like really upset and cry and then my mum whatsapped me say like your sister's just you know ring me like really upset and and she ring me from work
S0530	mm
S0529	and like kind of just sort of have a go at me and then i hang up on her and yeah and that be it really yeah so it wasn't very nice but it be kinda my fault to be honest
S0530	it's not your fault
S0529	that's why i feel bad about it
S0530	because
S0529	you know like these conversations
S0530	you you have people that love and that's not your fault that's why they're upset
S0530	you've not do anything to them it's just because they're concern about you and it make you feel guilty
S0529	yeah
S0530	but you haven't actually do anything wrong it's because they love you
S0530	and it's because they care and they want you to have the best time and they want the best view
S0529	i really wish i could just try for them like if i'm not try for myself
S0530	yeah
S0529	i wish i could do it for them but i just don't feel like i can even do that
S0530	yeah cos you just i dunno you just don't feel like you have the energy do you it's not
S0530	do you know how i find like it feel a bite like you know be it the right word like receptors like when you know you have like something that like you know when you touch something like you burn yourself you pull away really fast
S0529	yeah yeah pain receptors
S0530	i feel like with everything like kind of thing not obviously with pain cos i probably like pull myself away just as fast but in term of like life my life when i'm depress it's like that a bite like it's but it's very slow it's not yeah like fast it's
S0529	yeah
S0530	very like my reactions be very kinda like mm like
S0529	yeah i get that
S0529	yeah like sometimes when i might do just sabotage stuff to myself i just watch myself do it like come from outside of
S0530	mm
S0529	myself and just kind of think this be what you're do and you're not stop it and i just let it carry on
S0530	mm
S0529	i just like it's not like i like sabotage myself
S0530	no
S0529	it's just i have like no feel about it i just feel a bite kind of distant from it
S0530	mm
S0529	and i just watch it happen and then that's when i panic
S0530	mm
S0529	after that
S0530	it's just a killer isn't it like it's horrible
S0529	yeah could be worse
S0530	well don't say that because it's gonna be worse for everyone there's gonna be someone out there it's worse for
S0530	like don't don't compare
S0529	me be allow to suffer you've win like the prize for be allow to suffer i've find someone finally everyone else isn't allow cos their problems one person
S0529	that's how that's what it's like
S0530	i know i know
S0529	ah it's just horrible cos it's make me feel so selfish and self absorb
S0530	i know
S0529	and just everything be about yourself because you just can't get out of it like you can't
S0530	i don't think you're self absorb like even if you be it wouldn't be
S0529	mm
S0530	it would be part of the illness but i don't think that's your problem i think you just don't care about anything include yourself
S0529	yeah i mean that's true as well like i'm constantly in my head but also don't care a like i don't give a shit about myself like
S0530	mm
S0529	well as well like if i have the choice i would just
S0530	mm
S0529	i don't leave myself to kind of rot away in my room and not give a shit like
S0530	i mean you get to that point where your mind isn't really like your kind of
S0529	no it's not even mine any more
S0530	function it's
S0529	no
S0530	more of your cage you know
S0529	mm
S0530	it's not the thing that make you get up and do things it's the thing that kinda keep you in one place
S0529	yeah
S0530	and yeah it's hard
S0529	and it's weird cos most of the time i be like well not most of the time but some of the time i'm completely normal and
S0530	exactly like that
S0529	think doesn't it
S0530	it do feel like you're a fraud
S0529	yeah
S0530	that you're not just because it's not you know full time every minute of the every day just because you can have some maybe some higher point and then some really low point it doesn't undermine the low point okay
S0529	i'm sorry if it make it difficult to talk about with you cos
S0530	no i i mean i'm i'm happy talk about it like it doesn't make me feel like lower
S0529	cos i know that my friend doesn't cos she's have it before and she just doesn't like talk about it any more
S0530	i mean i can it actually be a relief to me that you can relate to everything that i'm say
S0529	yeah
S0530	because
S0529	me too
S0530	yeah it's horrible when it happen and when it get like i mean for me it's only be the last week that things have actually lift a bite
S0529	yeah i'm so glad
S0530	and i felt able to do thing more and i be actually surprise at how quickly it be
S0529	yeah
S0530	and i've be i've be
S0529	do you think it's the med partly
S0530	no
S0529	oh that's good
S0530	i obviously i think in a way meds be gonna have an influence
S0529	yeah
S0530	they they always be but i think that it's because i literally have say to myself i think my moment be when i be just not be able to do my work and i be just like nothing can be worse by just than like the way i be now like
S0529	yeah
S0530	like even try my work and fail everything and get a really bad grade and hat myself for it
S0530	it cannot be worse by than have to tell my seminar tutor that i can't do the work
S0529	yeah
S0530	and feel even more of a failure because i'll never know what i actually would've get in the assignment so yeah and i just hope that regularly do work will exercise my brain and
S0529	mm
S0530	train it to work again
S0529	yeah
S0530	like see it as kind of growth rather than like something that'll burn me out and not push myself too hard as well because you know you've gotta be gentle like you've gotta be firm but you've gotta be gentle
S0529	it's a good way of look at it
S0530	it be because there's i think there's a danger of like make yourself do too much
S0529	yeah
S0530	but also too little as well like you can you can never really tell what cos you've gotta get a balance in on it and i think that be hard especially at uni because there be no well except me and people in the flat there be nobody tell you what to do here
S0529	yeah
S0530	which and i think independence when you're depress can be the most damage thing you know like obviously there be people like email you and shit but it's not direct nobody's come and hammer on your door and say get out of bed you know
S0529	i be worry they're gonna start do that
S0530	oh wow
S0529	that's why i use to worry about last year
S0530	come all the where to
S0529	that they would actually just come to my room and start like tell me off my face email be scary though i hate email
S0530	they be they really be
S0529	cos they just expect you to keep up with your email account every day and it's like i don't like check it
S0530	i always get really scar like if i've miss something or like well
S0529	yeah like you know i say that my physics thing wasn't on my timetable my seminar
S0530	yeah
S0529	it turn out they send an email round yesterday say that oh it be actually on i don't know why it's not on the not on your timetable
S0530	what the physics
S0529	the physics seminar
S0530	i be think that
S0529	and i didn't get that email until like today
S0530	oh well you shouldn't've know well
S0529	cos i hadn't look and it be already too late so i mean to be honest i probably wouldn't go anyway cos i haven't be to of them and so you know like you know what i'm like but that wasn't really my fault that one
S0530	mm
S0529	but it's just a pain now cos i'm i've get another absence and if i do actually end up stay here i'm not gonna get the grand that i need next year
S0530	be you sure you need attendance for that
S0529	i expect so that's usually what they work with like that's what they measure it by
S0530	what be you gonna use the grand for like accommodation or food for this year just for this year
S0529	well just everything it be just for like it it be just we just factor it into everything we didn't like put it aside it be just part of the money we'd get
S0530	mm
S0530	that suck
S0529	yeah so if i don't get that i'm gonna be so fuck but i mean that's anyway
S0530	be there any way you can get like do they charge for you know you're with aren't you
S0530	oh you're in yeah
S0529	well no my my student account's with
S0530	okay
S0529	i've get an overdraft
S0530	do they charge interest for overdraft
S0529	but no
S0530	no
S0529	no i would be able to use my overdraft but i'd have to pay it off at the end and it would it's just
S0530	mm
S0529	yeah i don't know i suppose i could use my overdraft dip in dip into that
S0530	be it the same with all bank then like all bank
S0529	yeah they don't charge interest with student account usually
S0530	student bank really
S0529	yeah
S0530	that's really i think they do
S0529	and i get i get fourteen hundred overdraft which be pretty decent
S0530	okay
S0529	so i'm gonna get an
S0530	be this for coop then
S0529	yeah coop do you not get interest erm overdraft
S0530	i've not get a student bank account i've just get a normal one
S0529	have you not
S0530	yeah
S0529	oh my god why not
S0530	so i have cos my parent be like don't get a student account
S0529	we should've do though cos you get you get an overdraft and it's completely free
S0530	and how long can you have the overdraft for
S0529	well it's for this year and then it get it erm they give you more next year you get two grand next year
S0530	so i can have one grand overdraft this year
S0529	i get fourteen hundred overdraft
S0530	wow
S0529	on my current account and
S0530	okay
S0529	most account do that even
S0530	fourteen grand
S0529	well no not fourteen grand like one thousand four hundred
S0530	oh okay
S0530	wow okay
S0529	perhaps they get fourteen grand imagine
S0530	and then it's so you get you'd have to pay it back over next
S0529	well you have to
S0530	three years or by next year
S0529	when you're in your overdraft you just pay the overdraft back you don't like you don't have to like pay it back as debt it's just money that you don't have and you pay it back as you go
S0530	okay well i'll convert my account then
S0529	but but then at the end of the year if you be in overdraft most students be
S0530	sort mm
S0529	then you just pay it off next year or get a job over summer and that's
S0530	oh okay so there's no like deadline to the end of this year you have to pay it or something
S0529	no no no no and then there's no interest and what they do if you go over it if you go over your overdraft which be so impossible cos you've get fourteen hundred quid like they tell you that you've go over and they give you a chance to pay it back
S0530	okay
S0529	like what you've go over and it's usually only a couple of quid anyway
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	and then they don't charge you
S0529	so it's like really good
S0529	to get an overdraft like it's really essential cos it just give you a kind of like safety belt if you do have to
S0530	mm
S0529	have trouble with like pay
S0529	i can't believe you don't have an overdraft
S0530	no cos my parent be like don't even bother with overdrafts and student account but i be like okay but i like
S0529	really i mean yeah they're they're kind of scary cos like if you do go into your overdraft it's a bite scary cos it go red and it look like oh my god like i'm i'm in debt but you're not it's like everybody
S0530	it's just yeah
S0529	dip into their overdraft
S0530	yeah
S0529	it's just part of be a student really
S0530	i'll definitely make that on my agenda then to
S0529	yeah
S0530	convert it because if my thingy come through i'll need it if er
S0529	yeah i didn't think about it you could use that yeah definitely
S0530	might be able to do it cos it's one thousand two hundred and thirty or something yeah
S0529	yeah to like use it for your accommodation as well
S0530	mm
S0529	no it's definitely a good idea and then you just pay it back over summer when you get a job
S0530	mm
S0529	and it take like not very long usually
S0530	okay
S0529	to pay it back
S0530	wow but what if you didn't pay it back over summer
S0529	well then you just have overdraft next year
S0530	and overdraft then
S0529	and it will just roll over and yeah
S0530	okay
S0529	i'm not sure what would
S0530	right yeah cos i don't yeah
S0529	well no no cos i think my sister's actually in overdraft and you just kind of stay in overdraft until you pay it off
S0530	that's cool
S0530	that's fair enough then
S0529	i mean it's yeah it's fair enough like it's if you don't pay it back you just don't yeah they don't like come after you like
S0530	i'll look on the how much overdraft you can get
S0529	mm
S0530	if it's one thousand four hundred then that's not not too bad
S0529	let's have a look
S0530	let's see
S0529	you're
S0530	yeah cos i try look i think before cos i be actually look into get a student account be like
S0529	yeah
S0530	screw you know what screw your parent
S0529	what i get mine last year cos you get a free train ticket you get a free like railcard
S0530	yeah yeah that's cool
S0529	but it's just easier cos what i do i just pay myself a hundred pound a week like from my account to my
S0530	oh yeah
S0529	like my build society so i know exactly how much money i can spend a week
S0530	mm that's cool
S0529	then i don't end up spend over
S0530	right
S0529	upgrade exist account oh no i i just want information really
S0530	yeah
S0529	erm yeah what do it say in here when you open a student account with this an interest free overdraft here we go you can apply for up to five hundred in term one and up to two thousand after that
S0530	up to two thousand
S0529	yeah oh so you only get a you only get five hundred in the first year then that's weird
S0530	term one
S0529	yeah that isn't that doesn't that mean year
S0530	i think it mean oh term do that mean the
S0529	i'm not sure what that mean actually maybe it do mean i don't know what it mean
S0530	cos i i think cos your loan
S0530	it your in your first term you have to pay your loan back and you're sometimes in overdraft but it's not as much usually the first instalment isn't as much
S0529	oh oh right
S0530	it be ironically it be here but
S0529	yeah
S0530	yeah i think it do actually mean term one but it would've say year one otherwise
S0529	yeah to keep the overdraft you have pay at least seven hundred fifty every six months and make at least three debit transactions each month but you you do that anyway like
S0530	yeah
S0529	just by have just by like use the bank account
S0530	mm mm oh yeah with student finance you do get seven hundred and fifty every
S0529	yeah
S0530	three months yeah
S0529	yeah exactly
S0530	and how do you undo your student account like how do you stop it be a student account do you just like change it back
S0529	erm i think you just have to ring them up and just ask them if you could like change it
S0530	change it back
S0529	yeah i don't know how that would work really but i mean you could get a student account like it's pretty easy to do and you don't have to pay for it
S0530	separate to your other account
S0529	like separate that's what i've get and it's
S0530	okay
S0529	quite good because it mean that it's like separate so all your student money be separate and you just pay yourself what you get
S0530	okay
S0529	like your allowance and then the rest of it's all just in another account and you don't have to worry about it it just get pay by like
S0530	that's really good
S0529	like automatically like you set up automatic payments to the like the uni and to
S0530	mm
S0529	student finance and whatever
S0530	that's cool
S0529	and if you do that you might get more overdraft
S0530	do some people have it all in the same one
S0529	i mean yeah yeah some people do yeah
S0530	mm
S0529	i dunno cos i've get mine in separate but
S0530	yeah you've get yours in separate i'm sure that's a good way of do it actually like
S0529	i'm sure i'm sure people have
S0530	the way you're do it
S0529	i'm sure people do have it in let's look at like the best student bank account
S0530	so you have to apply for an overdraft then
S0529	erm yeah but it's not like a big
S0530	okay
S0529	a big kind of thing like it's really easy to get you just kind of do it it
S0530	it's not like oh yeah you need this yeah
S0529	no no no two thousand for up to five years wow 's suppose to be good a lot of people i know have get that
S0530	that's cool
S0529	i mean 's good i've never have any problems with it
S0530	that's really cool
S0529	mm
S0530	yeah i will i'll change it to i i mean i like just to make things
S0529	to just change it yeah
S0530	simpler just yeah just
S0529	yeah just sign in and muck about and see what they say
S0530	cos then i don't have to worry about doesn't come through i won't have to worry about it
S0529	yeah you'd have like money in there to pay for it
S0530	yeah
S0529	until you could like pay it back yeah
S0530	i find that the price of our for accommodation the year it's like i think it's four thousand four hundred
S0529	bloody hell
S0530	that's what i mean so it's not it's it's not it could be worse i guess i i i be expect it to be more
S0529	oh that's so much
S0530	but yeah it be it be a lot more than i think it would be to be honest
S0529	mm
S0530	that's look like a space potato
S0529	it do
S0529	i be want to go shop today i be gonna get potatoes and mash and make like
S0530	oh be you
S0529	toad in the hole but i didn't go shop in the end suppose i could do it's not too late
S0530	yeah it's three o'clock
S0529	mm
S0530	i've still get my frigging thing to do
S0529	what
S0530	my erm revision powerpoints that i have to
S0529	oh
S0530	go through which be fun
S0529	revision for what have you get another exam
S0530	well basically i'm make my i'm basically transfer all my revision things to my to powerpoint thing
S0529	oh yeah i remember you say that
S0530	to print
S0529	that's a good idea
S0530	when i go home so i can yeah
S0529	be you go home next week
S0530	i don't know i'm gonna home once before christmas but i don't know when
S0529	mm
S0530	i might go home next week
S0529	there's still time
S0530	yeah there be still time i bet you're so excite to go back
S0529	go back home
S0530	mm
S0529	yeah
S0530	or in a way like to see
S0529	yeah yeah i be i i dunno i think i will be when it get closer like if i'm actually here till christmas i'll be excite but at the minute it just feel like
S0530	mm
S0529	mm be i actually gonna make it till then i'm think about go to my dad's for a bite maybe just get like some
S0530	what at the like now
S0529	yeah
S0530	yeah
S0529	like cos i could go this week cos i haven't get anything on cos it's read week
S0530	you could do you could do
S0529	but then i've gotta hand in essay and stuff so it's like
S0530	oh
S0529	mm
S0530	no yeah
S0529	but i dunno whether to go to the doctor's and get an extension or something
S0530	you could do you could do that
S0529	oh i don't know dunno how easy it be though
S0530	i mean if you can prove your medical condition then i'm sure you can easily
S0529	mm
S0530	you can get a doctor's note should be pretty straightforward
S0529	mm yeah i dunno if it would actually help go to my dad's though to be honest but
S0530	you'd just be kind of still think about it but it would just be yeah
S0529	yeah it would just be a lot of money you know break
S0530	mm
S0529	and then come back feel exactly the same so
S0530	do you feel like you're still wait until you want to feel like do it almost like obviously you don't wanna do it now and you feel like you can't do it now but do you feel like i do you feel like there's a sense of like oh i at some point i can't simply can't just feel like this for my whole life like i there will be a point where i surely suddenly like feel a bite different to this that it feel like it's not come kinda thing
S0529	no i don't think so but i mean i be aware that i need to make change myself
S0530	mm
S0529	like i'm not
S0530	yeah no i know you're completely aware but like
S0529	like so i understand that i have to go and seek help and stuff like that
S0530	mm
S0529	and i feel like i've do that to a certain extent
S0530	which be great yeah yeah you've do load of that
S0529	i've just kinda miss the appointment like really unfortunate i haven't do that but i've get like an appointment with the academic advisor next week
S0530	mm
S0529	which be really annoy cos it's like this week that's everything's happen but i it'll still have to go to that i reckon if i'm still here then
S0530	if you're still here then
S0529	yeah i don't know i'm just talk in term of like i don't know like present tense at the moment but erm yeah i i dunno like i just wanna try and write this i just don't know where to start and every time i try i just lose concentration like within five minutes
S0530	be this physics
S0529	yeah and it's so it's so frustrate to me because it's not even the important essay
S0530	right
S0529	it's just like a little you know unimportant thing that i have to do and i just can't get it do because i'm so work up about it and because it it feel like an insult if i be to just do it really quickly as well because like this be what make me leave last year this whole thing of not be able to do these essay be what pretty much make me leave and it just seem stupid to just be able to bash one out and that's it and like the whole of last year mean absolutely nothing cos i just do it in five minutes and i know that not gonna happen because i don't feel like that i can't do it think i can it's not
S0530	mm
S0529	it's not an easy thing for you to do
S0530	no definitely
S0529	just and it's so stupid cos it should be it's not difficult but i could've do this in year eleven like this be the sort of thing they'd set in year eleven for science
S0530	but when you get out of the routine it be a lot harder like
S0529	yeah
S0530	like like maybe yourself like a few years ago might've find it like piss easy but it doesn't mean that it's not
S0529	yeah
S0530	yeah exactly
S0529	oh i dunno
S0530	but i i you be hashtag relatable
S0530	you very much you be even though it's shit for you
S0529	me too no it's not it's fine i'd rather be relatable than no one understand what i be talk about though so it's good
S0530	cos you you don't like i dunno like it's strange
S0529	yeah me too
S0530	like your head be kinda like on my which strange but
S0529	well it just i think it just show really that it be an illness
S0530	that it isn't yeah exactly it's not just like
S0529	you know it's not it's not in my head
S0530	be no way
S0529	cos it's so it would be too coincidental for us both to feel exactly the same about this sort of thing without it be some other
S0530	exactly
S0529	you know
S0530	exactly
S0529	secondary thing happen which be it
S0530	and a lot of symptoms of depression be symptoms of laziness and can't be arsed
S0529	yeah exactly
S0530	so
S0529	and that's the problem
S0530	you know
S0529	that's like that's the massive problem with it
S0530	yeah that's why it's so stigmatise
S0529	fuck ridiculous oh i just hate it i really do i wish i be lazy you know it would be so much easier
S0530	too anxious to be lazy
S0529	yeah exactly
S0529	it doesn't work like be depress and anxious at the same time it doesn't work they just they completely clash and
S0530	sometimes i think i'm calm but i'm not
S0529	yeah
S0529	i'm just like bubble under the surface all the time and i never i don't i'm not an impatient person
S0530	mm
S0529	pretty much that i don't get angry really only at myself i don't really like shout and like completely lose it like my mum do or anything i'm quite a patient person
S0530	mm
S0529	yeah
S0530	yeah
S0529	i don't know just a fuck nightmare really i dunno why i do that do you just do that you like go on your phone and log in and then don't do anything cos you just
S0530	just to check that it's happy
S0529	it's kinda just like a habit it's just like a weird thing that i get with my it's like a reflex or something
S0530	sometimes you even play with your phone when you're nervous it's like
S0529	yeah
S0530	the equivalent of like like twiddle your hair
S0529	i'm so awful when i'm nervous i like play with everything like i be just rip this up and if they give me tissue in counsel i rip them to shred all the way through they shouldn't give me tissue cos i just i just get it everywhere like it's so bad
S0530	i use to like draw grids like craaaaa
S0529	do you that's funny
S0530	and that's actually quite common actually it's not
S0529	yeah
S0530	like yeah
S0529	no i've head that one my auntie tell me about that one that people do that when they're stress i draw point coin sign like
S0530	if mm
S0529	money sign which tell a lot about me
S0530	mm
S0529	that's what i doodle
S0530	your your priorities
S0529	yes i know
S0530	or be that anxieties over money or
S0529	money oh both
S0530	dream of money or
S0529	yeah
S0530	richness
S0529	i be read up a a there be a thing on the about sugar daddies and this girl who like spend a month just go out for dinner with these really rich men like fifty year olds and they would just pay for dinner like thousands of pound and buy her like
S0530	yeah
S0529	bag and perfume and all of this stuff
S0530	yeah they do that
S0529	and she didn't have sex with him
S0530	yeah

S0530	that's yeah
S0529	have intellectual conversation and i just
S0530	they just want company they're just lonely and they've get so much money
S0529	yeah that sound like a good idea
S0530	like me seriously me and
S0529	i wanna do that
S0530	last year my friends at uni
S0529	yeah
S0530	we sit in just have this huge like discussion like serious discussion about how we could actually do go about do this
S0529	yeah
S0530	and be just like hang on we've we're all skint just do it
S0530	or like we'll just
S0529	can we use that like
S0530	everyone shall we just do it
S0529	yeah
S0530	and the thing be last year like there's load of them like near because of all the big build
S0529	yeah i bet
S0530	but here it's like
S0529	yeah you wouldn't get
S0530	it's shit you could get the
S0529	you could go to london
S0530	you'd get a sugar sheep
S0529	but they the thing be they pay you for like trip to other cities
S0530	yeah and they can take you on like
S0529	yeah
S0530	when you look on their profile it's crazy like i'm look for someone who i can treat and travel the world with and it's like
S0529	yeah it's ridiculous like why would
S0530	wow
S0529	well it's very nice of them and
S0529	if i be more confident i would definitely do it like
S0530	and some rich people give students loan
S0529	yeah this one she say she erm he pay off her entire overdraft
S0530	on websites that's amaze
S0529	just straightaway like he be just like give me your bank detail i'll pay it off for you and they hadn't even meet this be just her like chat on the one of the like date line things whatever they're call
S0530	that's crazy
S0529	i know he just pay it off
S0530	you could just do that and never speak to them again as harsh as it would be
S0529	i know exactly and that's what she do she like she just completely cut off from everyone after a month cos she be like right my social life's kind of get a bite mess up here and i'm better stop this now and she do
S0530	i'm so do this
S0529	but it be just such a good month cos she have so much money
S0530	they buy you present
S0529	and she be i be really like admire her cos she be so confident and so like not afraid of what people would think of her
S0530	no
S0529	like she tell her family
S0530	i mean
S0529	and it's get yeah it's get nothing to do with it even if she be have sex with him she shouldn't've be ashamed of it like
S0530	no exactly i mean you're do them a service
S0529	yeah exactly if they want it
S0530	like you're in control because it's your
S0529	exactly yeah
S0530	position like it's not
S0529	and she didn't feel like ever that she be trap into it like she felt like she she could always say no
S0530	opt out and mm
S0529	yeah and they weren't there for sex anyway
S0530	no
S0529	most of the time they just want you to talk
S0530	that's the thing
S0529	cos they're old enough and they usually have families as well like they usually have wive and stuff they just want to like talk about their day and sort of
S0530	that's really kinda sad isn't it
S0529	it be it's really quite
S0530	like
S0529	it's quite tragic really for them like yeah
S0530	they must be so desperate like if they're will to spend that much on company
S0529	they must be quite lonely i know
S0530	and sure rich
S0529	well then but money to them isn't the same thing as what it would be to us like
S0530	mm
S0529	cos it's cos they've just get so much of it like
S0530	money's probably just money like
S0529	yeah
S0530	it come and go like the grass and the rain and
S0529	yeah imagine that
S0530	tree
S0529	imagine just money be disposable to someone
S0530	yeah must be so strange
S0529	it's insane
S0530	like kardashians have be it
S0529	mm
S0530	like four hundred and eighty million
S0529	i know
S0530	wow
S0529	kind of admire them though cos they've do it all themselves
S0530	yeah
S0530	yeah
S0529	you know why shouldn't they exploit themselves through reality tv if they're gonna make money off it like i would
S0529	hundred percent
S0530	yeah i i i don't have a problem with
S0529	they're businesswomen
S0530	kardashians to be honest like
S0529	no i don't
S0530	i don't watch the kardashians but like
S0529	no
S0530	i don't everyone's like oh i hate them i'm like i don't hate them nothing wrong with them
S0529	no
S0530	do nothing wrong they're successful
S0529	they're like the royal family except they've do it all themselves
S0530	they really be
S0529	aren't they
S0530	they be better than the royal family and that
S0529	yeah cos they've do it all themselves
S0530	in so many respect
S0529	they're business people like they've
S0530	yeah
S0529	yeah
S0530	they're not just bear into wealth you know
S0529	exactly well i mean the sisters be but they're also do stuff now aren't they like she's a model
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	do something i can't remember yeah wish i be rich
S0530	me too be cool to be rich imagine just not like do you know what like that's the thing i i i never think about be rich and be like oh i not particularly like i'd buy this and i'd buy that not always it's more like i wouldn't have to worry about money
S0529	yeah exactly and that's
S0530	it's
S0529	that's kind of good really cos that's what you want like you don't wanna
S0530	yeah
S0529	you know really spoil and
S0530	it's just i'd like to be comfortable and not have that on my mind
S0529	yeah you just don't wanna have to worry about money it just wouldn't be there and that's why people who be rich can say like oh money doesn't buy happiness but it buy like safety and
S0530	it buy everything
S0529	assurance that you're not gonna you know ever be in a position where
S0530	mm
S0529	you don't have enough money for things that you need
S0530	i know
S0529	and it would just yeah it would just leave you to you know go about your life do other things and not worry ever about money
S0530	yeah pretty much
S0529	if i be rich i could just go home now and i could go and do i don't know a degree in anything i want and not have to worry about get a job at the end of it because it would just for my enjoyment
S0530	mm
S0529	cos i'd have enough money to do whatever i want after that
S0530	my god imagine that though
S0529	and i wouldn't mind pay extra tax cos i'd deserve to like yeah i've get more money i need to contribute more like yeah i don't think i'd be greedy about it
S0530	no no neither would i really i mean what would you actually buy if you be rich i don't actually know
S0529	well that's the thing cos now i'm like so scar about buy anything like i don't buy very much other than food like here especially because i'm just worry about spend money like
S0530	i'd go travel
S0529	i'd just find it so precious
S0530	i'd spend it on experience like i'd like to do stuff like
S0529	yeah
S0530	i know it sound strange but like scuba dive and that kinda thing
S0529	mm yeah
S0530	and just have experience but i'd also like a home like a nice home and i'd like to make like an animal thing in my home like
S0529	oh
S0530	not like quite paris hilton's
S0529	no
S0530	but that be incredible but like
S0530	have like a sanctuary for animals where people can come in and work and stuff and like
S0529	oh that's so cute
S0530	come in and look after them and i'd i'd love to do stuff like that but yeah
S0529	yeah i think i would buy my mum a house first
S0530	you selfless little
S0529	no but wouldn't you no you'd buy your mum a house
S0529	or no you might not but that's that's
S0530	i dunno
S0529	that's like
S0530	i dunno
S0529	understandable
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	that's fine
S0530	i mean i i'd like to help with my family to be honest cos they have like financially have do stuff for me and i would like to give that back you know but
S0529	yeah
S0530	i dunno yeah i
S0529	that sound really annoyingly selfless but i don't think i can't think of anything else that i would do before that like that's really important to me
S0530	and i suppose like with your mum as well like
S0530	because she's have money trouble before that would really like make you think it would just be just be good
S0529	it would just be good cos she'd just have a house and she wouldn't have to worry about it ever again and i might just buy her the house we have now cos the house we have now be like really nice and
S0530	mm
S0529	it's in a good location you wouldn't get it these days and it's pretty cheap to buy like it's no ridiculously expensive
S0530	imagine if we win the lottery
S0529	oh imagine it'd be so good
S0530	like sixteen million pound or whatever like
S0529	yeah
S0530	do you know fact you have more you have erm more chance of die on your way to the win the lottery
S0529	yeah i hear that once
S0530	than actually win
S0529	i know it's so depress
S0530	it be
S0529	er the most i've ever win be like and i think that be on a scratch card anyway so
S0530	somebody i know in my school their family they they live on like erm a council estate and they win a few million pound they now live in quite a wealthy area of the town so it's completely change
S0529	that's amaze for them that's brilliant
S0530	it's brilliant yeah
S0529	yeah
S0530	they live a completely different life now to the way they do it's
S0530	really strange but really good it's like
S0529	yeah
S0530	couldn't've go to anyone better to be honest
S0529	what happen if the lottery like get win by someone who's already get enough money like do they just still win it
S0530	yeah
S0529	and it's just
S0530	it's not they can't really take it away from them it's yeah
S0529	mm no they can't really can they
S0530	yeah it be but i don't think people that
S0529	luck of the draw
S0530	i think it be like people who be in with a like i don't think many rich people enter the lottery
S0529	but then they could cos they'd have the money to
S0530	they could
S0529	you know
S0530	but i think more
S0529	cos that's another thing you have to pay to enter it and it's
S0530	yeah
S0529	you know if you enter it a lot of time you'd have more chance of win in it so
S0530	i hate to image how like much the average person spend on a lottery ticket in a lifetime without win it's
S0529	i know it's awful
S0530	horrible business like i actually well i recently like because i'd see the statistics i kind of get out of the habit of do it and i'm just a bite like na but i use to get it
S0529	do what
S0530	lottery ticket
S0529	really
S0530	like every now and then yeah just as a now and then not weekly but like oh yeah
S0529	i've never buy one
S0530	i might do it
S0529	i've never actually buy one it's quite weird cos i'm so obsess with money but i've never buy a lottery ticket or a scratch card or anything
S0530	i've buy a few scratch card yeah
