S0058	yeah
S0179	i don't want to
S0058	i don't know in some ways i'm not sure i fancy make a colossal effort though cos especially if we're not gonna be finish the hospital till eight by the time we've you know we could go up to northumberland by the time we get there it would be nine like you wouldn't be eat till ten at the earliest it's it's kind of a long time i think and i think i'd rather maybe just be simpler
S0179	okay i mean we don't have to go somewhere that far we could go somewhere like you know say half an hour
S0058	could do i mean i don't to be honest i don't really know restaurants very well there isn't anywhere that jump out in my head so anywhere to go
S0179	except chiquitos
S0058	yeah um
S0179	we have be to chiquitos in haven't we
S0058	i don't think we have
S0179	oh we've eat there oh no we haven't
S0058	we've be to it as in we've be outside it but i think it be when we be out with and
S0179	but i think we eat out there
S0058	one time you have a kebab in
S0179	yeah i remember that
S0058	i don't remember eat at chiquitos in
S0179	okay never mind i'm make shit up again
S0058	hmm mm which you should stop do
S0179	yes
S0058	ha ha
S0179	yes stay there
S0058	i didn't know there be a match on today the only time i know when there's a match on be if at work at work mention it
S0179	so be er another
S0058	no no he's not he's an arsenal supporter so erm yeah saw them when they play arsenal recently and we beat them and apparently sort of innocently send him an email on the monday say you have a nice weekend he say no i haven't oh sorry
S0179	well tough luck stop confess your happiness will be determine by your football result
S0058	no you've hear that quote though erm some people say football be a matter of life and death that's just stupid it's far more important than that can't remember who say that it be some manager i think
S0179	yes strange
S0058	hmm mm strange but true
S0179	no
S0058	no it's true as in someone say it
S0179	oh right erm and i'm traffic this be progress
S0058	mm
S0179	these guy yeah obviously this way thank you for that
S0058	ha ha

S0179	yeah i mean just if you'd like to see her then it's an idea
S0058	it might be nice
S0179	we could still eat with your parent and then go out
S0058	yeah i be think we could eat with my parent and then go out and see kind of nine or ten um we could see them in the town or
S0179	well it's go to take us at least an hour to cook and eat
S0058	yeah so yeah er so maybe ten we could see them just if she's not do anything
S0179	mm
S0058	okay i'll i'll just give her a text her then cos that might be nice it'll be something different maybe
S0179	yeah
S0058	and i haven't see her for age far too long i really should keep in better touch with her i've get better with but and as well that'll be nice
S0179	yeah

S0179	oh with thatcher right i see what you mean
S0058	yeah i don't know if it be one of the pit closure or whether it have already go by then erm interest to find out actually
S0179	yes that be good it's get cloudy
S0058	yeah it have it's not quite as nice as it be before still we're gonna be indoors so it's not so big a deal but still it be a lovely morning

S0179	mm londoners
S0058	ha ha
S0179	lawn tennis and football club
S0058	mm
S0179	cricket lawn tennis and football wow
S0058	hmm mm sport's club basically
S0179	mm specifically english sport
S0058	hmm mm
S0179	what's the difference between lawn tennis and tennis
S0058	i imagine lawn tennis you play on the grass whereas tennis be presumably vary surface huh i don't know if it's different to have different surface don't they
S0179	mm
S0058	so there's like asphalt type
S0179	asphalt
S0058	and then sort of be wimbledon on grass or not
S0179	think about that
S0058	i be i no it's not be it
S0179	course it be
S0058	be it that's the thing i genuinely don't know
S0179	can you not bring back to bring back from when you've see it on television it's on green shit
S0058	yeah but it could have be any kind of green shit
S0179	no
S0058	it's so well tend ha it hasn't get the sort of gnarly bits that normally lawns have
S0179	it have by the end
S0058	oh true yeah okay fair enough
S0058	and yeah cos that's why some tennis players don't do so well in be it the big american competition where it's on a hard surface
S0179	the american open
S0058	yeah and they don't do so well in that because of the surface
S0179	no i don't know no one really know or care how andy murray be do
S0058	no
S0058	it's interest isn't it well i think people be interest but they don't actually want him particularly to win
S0179	no it's not that i mean they probably wouldn't wanna be please if he do they don't care particularly
S0058	yeah but but there'd be more a kind of oh england's win rather than oh that nice chap
S0179	well he's too good
S0058	well yeah he be
S0179	and he's not particularly nice
S0058	he's not very nice i think if he be slightly less good and slightly nicer everyone would be obsess with him again like kevin but no i agree it's because he's just that little bite miserable and a little bite serious about it all and just doesn't give the impression that he'd be any er nice then he you know be any good to talk to or you know and yeah and he's a little bite too good he actually have a reasonable um
S0179	chance
S0058	chance he's not really an underdog character
S0179	yeah it be him or be it
S0058	exactly yeah river be obsess with him but ha
S0179	he get to the semi finals once or twice and the quarter finals quite a lot
S0058	yeah he be sort of quite a regular quarter finals person i think which be you know it's not bad it's not but he be just not quite so if he would it would have be a really big thing and i think why all the people be root for him you know a guy come slightly from beneath to win ha you feel like he's work for it ha you don't like anyone to get anything for you know anything too easily
S0179	ah so i do like sampras
S0058	i don't remember ever really i didn't really watch much tennis i know of henman but i didn't really sort of notice peter sampras
S0179	well peter sampras be sort of when i start to watch tennis he be sort of a do you know what i mean i think he still the record for the number of wimbledon title
S0058	oh right what
S0179	erm he's sort of yeah probably one of the best of world players the world's ever see
S0058	what nationality
S0179	american
S0058	mm
S0179	erm but it be just and he be a nice guy
S0058	yeah
S0179	and the interest thing be that he and like his what be they call federer and what's the other one call
S0058	nadal
S0179	yeah just i mean federer seem quite nice but nadal doesn't
S0058	nadal be the grumpy one
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	and federer seem fine
S0058	ha ha as sportsmen go
S0179	yeah
S0058	that sign be wobble really or be it wobble funnily there stay away from that
S0179	yes but erm yeah but the interest thing with sampras be that he and him be in fact er be quite good friends and they use to train together a lot
S0058	mm ah interest i don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing in term of kind of you get to know your opponent and how they work
S0179	well he have actually i think he'd put henman out of the semi finals on one occasion
S0058	mm
S0179	er which be a bite sort of oh but he have a pretty good game against him
S0058	yeah be it yeah i don't know about whether professionally it's a really good idea to sort of find out where the weak spot be whether professionally it's a bad idea
S0179	yeah but the point be they be both nice people
S0058	yeah
S0179	that's kind of what i be go for
S0058	yeah they're do it to bond and make friends and ha
S0179	yeah
S0058	play tennis with people they like ha rather than in it purely to win wimbledon which i think be what andy murray's in well he he's in it to win and i'm just not i i don't really get the impression that he'd be interest in bond ha
S0179	yeah
S0058	maybe he's fine maybe he just come across badly every single time he's televise
S0179	well i don't know if you you can tell a certain amount from the amount of time people argue something with the umpire
S0058	yeah
S0179	as in he do it quite a bite
S0058	yeah
S0179	and henman virtually never do it
S0058	yeah no yeah exactly it show a certain kind of arrogance i think
S0179	i think well yeah but even not it's like well you can just accept oh well that's really it's it might not be fair but i'm just gonna live with it
S0058	yeah i'm just gonna get it on with it exactly well it's like in football you know you'll often get one guy from the you know from the team go to the ref and say ref it be a stupid decision and the captain go just just leave it don't worry about it you know if it's not that big a deal they'll say look just get on with it don't argue you know you'll cause yourself more problems
S0179	indeed i can see you've get all these to please me
S0058	what henman
S0179	henman and sampras
S0058	yeah that's nice ha ha i like a nice sport person that's why i've always love lineker and he wasn't an outstanding player but he be nice and he never get book
S0179	i think he be just a very good solid player
S0058	yeah exactly he be
S0179	a bite like beckham really
S0058	ah but beckham be outstanding though erm i don't know if he be
S0179	be
S0058	i don't know if he be really now erm but er i think he be special in a way lineker never really be
S0179	hang on but what be he actually good at
S0058	beckham
S0179	yeah
S0058	striker
S0179	oh i think he be a midfield
S0058	no striker captain i think
S0179	yeah
S0058	but erm he score a lot do beckham and i think he be just yeah a a bite of a special player and entertain to watch and stuff erm whereas i think lineker be just yeah very solid play by the rule kind of footballer
S0179	mm
S0058	and i think sometimes in football there's a very fine line between something be a really really good move and something just be a foul so a lot of players you know you'd go for it you know and if you get it wrong you're book and if you get it right it's an extremely good move you know and you have a go at it
S0179	yeah indeed
S0179	forty oh jesus
S0058	be that what it be last time i can't remember
S0179	no
S0058	oh
S0179	i vaguely understand it be fifty but forty be push it
S0179	just drop down
S0058	well you'd think the angel of the north would make people drive a little slower anyway like stonehenge it be quite a big landmark i never really think about it just cos it's just there but
S0179	why be we in a forty for the love of god
S0058	cos there's some con by the side of the road look impede progress there
S0179	oh
S0058	ha ha
S0179	i'm sorry i be just gonna treat that as optional
S0058	what because it's so stupid
S0179	well because the traffic's flow
S0058	yeah at this speed
S0179	we would actually be impede traffic flow if we be do forty
S0058	no i know
S0179	there's no reason not to there's no significant hazard erm that be interest
S0058	what be
S0179	well there's it's not that big
S0058	no it's not well you see the people at the bottom it's pretty big
S0179	mm remind me why it be build again
S0058	just art
S0179	no be it like a millennium thing
S0058	erm i think it be about the millennium i don't know if it be specifically for that
S0179	you didn't see it before that
S0058	no i think it be just er you know they want a bite of art so they get antony gormley on the case
S0179	fair enough
S0058	it it's quite good i i quite like it i think a lot of people at the time be like god you know ugly ridiculous bite of metal rusty and horrible you know look like a plane have crash in the side you know and people didn't really like it but i think people have grow to to like it a bite more it be very different i think and really unusual there's nothing else look like that anywhere so
S0179	mm
S0058	but i like it i like it at the time i think it be very statuesque and you know proud look
S0179	yes okay
S0058	and it's become so iconic that i i don't think people really think about it anymore whereas at the time cos it be so new it be like whoa ha i remember one time they be try to decide what colour to paint the bridge in sunderland you know it be green
S0179	yeah
S0058	i think it still be green but they have a little sort of poll on the front of the echo so like four different colour so they have like a black one a green one er whatever you know something else and then this bright red one ha and everyone be like the bright red one next to the it be brilliant er no
S0179	can you not stripe it
S0058	yeah exactly that's what everyone want ha i say everyone that's what the echo readers want
S0179	oh good we're actually now back into an official fifty what that just they'd just put sign up the side of the road
S0058	yeah
S0179	the only noticeable difference that and a few con
S0058	yeah ha the con that weren't on the road or even near the road
S0179	indeed
S0058	never mind it's all finish now ha ha until the way back
S0179	so it should be sixty
S0058	huh
S0179	it's slightly deceive
S0058	i've see quite a few of those today
S0179	now it's sixty there's one ahead
S0058	be there
S0179	that car but one
S0058	oh okay
S0179	it's a it's either i think it say eighty it could possibly be mark to a sixty but adapt
S0058	uh huh
S0179	it's like top gear's drivers of different cars last time
S0058	ha ha yeah ha ha what be the guy who face backwards peugeot be it ha ha what or be it the woman drive um i can't remember
S0179	yeah
S0058	ha he drive a bike ha
S0179	why in sixty not sure it's mark to a sixty just can you check this when we get closer
S0058	ha okay
S0179	we're go a little bite faster then
S0058	it look like it say eighty
S0179	oh it be an say eighty so you can see all the part
S0058	yeah it's eighty
S0179	okay
S0058	there you be
S0179	i'm sorry
S0058	two point five t what do the t stand for
S0179	turbo
S0058	ah you know that turbo aftershave what be the other thing turbo sunglasses ha
S0179	kind of ebox go the other way it's pretty smart you know
S0058	mm it's gonna have to do a little more to convince me
S0179	it's not that big see my injunction to range rover's be that they're huge
S0058	it's quite ugly but it's
S0179	i think it's ugly in a charm way
S0058	ha ha yeah
S0179	yeah be it it's not the next leave be it it's after that
S0058	um yeah it be after that yeah handy little sign there metrocentre straight on
S0179	be that a new build they're put up
S0058	look like it doesn't it flats presumably
S0179	it's like when you want to put them up a lot of them be pull down
S0058	yes
S0179	which around here i'd have think it be more likely to be the latter but
S0058	it could it's hard to know actually
S0179	well you think they'd demolish them with explosives that's what they'd normally do
S0058	unless there's too much stuff around it too close to it
S0179	mm you'd be surprise what you can do
S0058	mm it do seem odd dismantle it brick by brick i mean it seem a bite of a waste of time
S0179	mm maybe
S0058	which look cos cos they're sort of very yeah it look like they're do it slowly do you know what i mean do you think they're put it up they might be build flats it just seem like a bite old fashion block of flats they don't really build like that now
S0179	mm
S0058	do you know what i mean they build sort of slightly lower wider
S0179	well the structure should still be the same regard of the time
S0058	no it it just seem like an a kind of an unusual thing to be build i haven't see many block of flats like that be build
S0179	excuse me
S0058	excuse
S0179	excuse me
S0058	excuse
S0179	excuse me
S0058	ha ha how long can i keep excuse you as long as it take

S0058	cool
S0179	actually have i i might not have actually i've just change my mind
S0058	okay do you have it figure now
S0179	yeah cos before i be gonna park as close to m and s as possible but if we're gonna walk along the entire length anyway it doesn't make a difference unless we just park closer to the motorway junction
S0058	if you're gonna go to m and s and the apple store then it doesn't make much difference
S0179	right
S0058	so if we erm we could see what time marks' be be open till in the even
