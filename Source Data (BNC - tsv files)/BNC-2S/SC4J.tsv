S0037	i think it would be good though look like a good film it's win load of award
S0115	oh yeah um
S0037	like i think the oscars haven't be yet have they or have they no they haven't
S0115	uh no the the have we have the grammys yet or
S0037	um i think so cos do adele not win load of stuff
S0115	uh oh i might i might have read that in uh
S0037	i think she uh i'm sure they be like i dunno last night or something you know really quite recently
S0115	yeah um
S0037	be the grammys not more of like a music thing or be they be they both because obviously if it be last night then people be at the or be the baftas at a different time oh i'm all confuse
S0115	uh no i don't
S0037	put a bite of water in it's nice that i'll just
S0115	yeah there's load ofdifferent ceremonies all all you know all over the year aren't there so
S0037	yeah because i think i be read something that say like the the baftas use to be after the like oscars and no one could be bother so they move them like to before the oscars so everything like lead up to the oscars can i have some juice thank you
S0115	yeah yeah they all all the all the other ones lead up to the oscars the oscars be sort of like um what d'you say like the crescendo of it or whatever the the um christmas sort of
S0037	christmas day of it yeah
S0115	um there's sort of like a big build up and um can i just try one of them
S0037	i think they need a bite longer
S0115	cos uh
S0037	it's stick to my food
S0115	can eat them raw can't you
S0037	well
S0115	so and then the use the other the other ceremonies to predict who's gonna win the oscars don't they
S0037	well i think the artist win load of stuff so i bet they
S0115	yeah the artist um
S0037	think i should put some garlic in with them or d'you not like it when it's roast
S0115	yeah why not we get a lot four four cloves
S0037	be stink at work tomorrow
S0037	well more than usual i should say
S0115	well d'you sit near people uh
S0037	quite near people i've have a i've get a meet
S0115	do they do they like garlic
S0037	well everyone like garlic but not on other people you know
S0115	um well some people don't like it at all some i like my cousin doesn't like it
S0037	ah i can't believe her
S0115	say it smell of sewage
S0037	no way
S0115	i can see there be
S0037	
S0115	i can see there be some similarity between you know garlic and and
S0037	sewage
S0115	a bite i mean it's it's quite sort of garlic's sort of sulphurous isn't it you know
S0037	i think it's really nice
S0115	but um
S0037	sewage though
S0115	i don't even think she like uh garlic bread which i think everyone like garlic bread
S0037	every one must
S0115	yeah i think she's fairly fairly fussy
S0037	yeah you don't say
S0115	but
S0037	mm
S0115	the most fussy person um who doesn't doesn't even like uh um like well not only doesn't like fish but also doesn't like um
S0037	mm
S0115	uh tend to move towards sort of bread toast and uh sorry sorry bread bread cheese and tomato as as a sort of a main
S0037	nothing wrong with bread cheese and tomato like
S0115	yeah and and certain meat
S0037	but you think that i'm fussy and everyone that i know think that i'm not fussy so maybe you just eat absolutely everything
S0115	yeah i i do eat um
S0037	i think your family be surprise that i be fussy and and whereas like in my family i'm the least fussy maybe
S0115	yeah really the least of the whole lot
S0037	well what be it that i don't like really i would probably
S0115	well there's some things you say you don't like but you actually do
S0037	i would eat anything like if i go to someone's house and they'd make a dinner for us i would eat it no matter what it be even if
S0115	well that's good
S0037	like there's not many things that i couldn't like just force in
S0115	yeah
S0037	but there's some things that i wouldn't choose if it be like if it have a menu
S0115	yeah like a preference thing uh
S0037	so when i be like there's some things when i'm a bite like er sort of thing but i would still eat them if somebody have cook them for us i don't really like asparagus but if somebody make it for me dinner i'd just squash it in
S0115	do you say that when you chew it it make a squeaky noise be that
S0037	no that's green bean but i seem to have conquer that um
S0115	asparagus
S0037	i don't really like boil vegetables just on their own like dry like a dry boil carrot
S0115	it's get strange things in it just like yeah
S0037	i don't really like that very much
S0115	yeah have a bite of salt on it wouldn't you
S0037	no but i think it need like a sauce or a gravy or something
S0115	yeah yeah i understand um where you're come from there salad
S0037	but um other than like i don't really like sort of well i like squid but you know we don't need to talk about that

S0037	doesn't agree with us i be gonna buy some at the shop today
S0115	it's good be it just squid it's strange that it's just squid though
S0037	i know i wonder what it be maybe i can maybe i can try and desensitize myself
S0115	it it mean that we can't buy you know pack of uh freeze seafood or other type of seafood mix they they tend to have them them bits of squid in
S0037	seafood mix i know maybe i could just try maybe i could just eat them and just hope for the best
S0115	yeah i mean it can't cos i think you use to be able to eat it at at some
S0037	but what happen like

S0037	it's in yeah
S0115	i say
S0037	okay
S0115	um
S0037	it's cos you're not local
S0115	but it's actually be it
S0037	that's very true yeah have you be before
S0115	mean mean something like the street of or
S0037	i don't know
S0115	or or just street cos it be it actually head towards
S0037	i'm not sure of its geographic orientation no
S0115	yeah
S0037	it's nice i use to go there and like there's there's a the river go through and like um use to go swim in the river and there's a big park uh use to go there
S0115	yeah yeah oh yeah well i go to once myself and with you in fact uh
S0037	that's true
S0115	on the bus the purple bus
S0037	oh yeah
S0115	and uh
S0037	we should go back it's nice
S0115	they seem to have be exploit the colour purple quite quite well those people
S0037	do they i don't remember
S0115	the bus be purple wasn't it
S0037	be it
S0115	i think it be it's to do with the bishops and
S0037	they have them round here like green buss and blue buss and stuff
S0115	something to do with the bishops and purple
S0037	oh the prince bishops land of the prince bishops
S0115	something like that yeah
S0037	yeah although i don't really know the history
S0115	so you can uh you're allow to take in uh a bottle of wine then so
S0037	yeah or four beers
S0115	but no no more than that then or you could buy it in there
S0037	no you can buy beer in there like in but it's obviously like concert price or whatever
S0115	
S0037	i don't mean the place no i don't mean i mean like as if you be go to a concert
S0115	oh yeah concert price yeah yeah
S0037	concert not
S0115	cos obviously
S0037	only you would get that ambiguity
S0115	in your accent in your accent the they're the same aren't they
S0037	but that's only ambiguous if you know that there's a place call
S0115	no i be just think of cos 's not far be it
S0037	how do you know about
S0115	because it it be mention um on some work i do but also uh it's it's where um it's where from big brother's from supposedly uh
S0037	i didn't know you be such a avid fan
S0115	no i wasn't yeah they just mention it in something to do
S0037	no it's not hot enough i want it to sizzle then
S0115	you gotta have it uh put it up to eleven
S0037	no put it on the nine eleven's
S0115	cos like you gotta put it you gotta do it until that red thing go and you know all the line disappear
S0037	see through
S0115	so obviously you need it on like top heat at first
S0037	ah
S0115	and then you lower it once it's reach top heat cos you've gotta get the heat all through the pan cos it's quite a thick pan
S0037	alright heston
S0115	so it's quite a thick pan to take you gotta get all the heat evenly spread across the pan that's what i'm say i'm not try to be you know some kind of pedant about this sort of thing
S0037	be you not
S0115	um
S0037	have you see that heston programme do you watch the one about cook an egg heston show you heston show you how to uh cook an egg
S0115	yeah cook an egg ah he tell you he tell me how to poach an egg um which be basically don't do anything um other than use a fresh egg and then put it on um like
S0037	get a nice fresh egg yeah
S0115	you don't need to put vinegar in and then don't i think don't don't heat it too hot i mean you boil it but then lower it or something
S0037	yeah
S0115	and then filter it you put put it through like a sieve to
S0037	but no one want to know how to cook like heston no one's like d'you know what i'll just go and get some dry ice for the family dinner
S0115	heston's great though heston do some some really whacky stuff
S0037	yeah he do but no one want to cook like heston though do they
S0115	depend what he's do i i mean i don't wouldn't want like a freeze worm or something
S0037	exactly freeze worm surprise
S0115	but some of his stuff be be really good i think he
S0037	like a soufflé with like a scarecrow scarecrow's eyeball in the top or something i don't even know what a scarecrow's eyeball be
S0115	um well yeah it's like one of them witch this isn't it you know eye of um eye of bat
S0037	yeah dog
S0115	ear of ear of uh turkey
S0037	yeah you don't want them you don't want a bat's ear pie or anything
S0115	why do witch why do witch recipes have that sort of format
S0037	that's more like it what body part of animal
S0115	yeah
S0037	this be not gonna take very long i don't think
S0115	do you just put salt and pepper on them
S0037	no
S0115	oh right maybe wanna do that now yeah
S0037	i've put them on the the top side oh what we shoulda do be stuff something in there and like stuff them
S0115	yeah maybe although it might then be hard to get the bone out cos uh the bone be quite well you you'd probably have to take the bone out first
S0037	yeah i try to cut the bone out of the middle bite that i could see but
S0115	so yeah i normally would put salt i mean uh that's bite bits of black you know grain on top of the fish before fry it just because cos i have that in a restaurant once
S0037	on the bottom side i know i forget
S0115	on that side yeah you can sort of flip them and but um oh
S0037	sorry oh yeah that that salmon that you have
S0115	yeah that be at simply french
S0037	maybe they'll have something similar in i book it
S0115	yeah look forward to that um i'll have to check the menu on the internet to see what uh stuff they've get
S0037	yeah i think they've get some nice things
S0115	uh be there be the spectacular um you know lobster platter isn't there
S0037	well i'm not sure if we can stretch to the lobster
S0115	cos uh it's like a lobster sit on top of a hell of a lot of other things
S0037	shall i turn them over or leave them or what
S0115	yeah flip them over and then salt the back
S0037	sorry be they cook enough no i'm gonna turn them back
S0115	um yeah well i mean it it depend uh you could cook them all like on one side can't you
S0037	i think they should be more crispy
S0115	you don't have to turn them over you could just but it's just a matter of time cook them or it depend if you want them brown on the other side or whatever if it if you flip them you'd have the opportunity to salt and pepper them on the back
S0037	oh right right whoop oh that one's mine then
S0115	too much too much flip in order to uh
S0037	whoop ah make a right dog's dinner of this sorry man
