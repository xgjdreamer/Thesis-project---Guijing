S0041	fuck off
S0084	nightmare yeah she's just a retard she's just everything be really hard in her life and i can't hold her hand like we have catch up meet in production um in my team with the editors every two weeks to just talk about whatever's go on budget schedule issue with the proof whatever market don't come you know it's not really relevant that's why they have no idea about the schedule so they have no idea they have no concept of the priority of your deadlines they've get they don't care so you e mail them and say okay well this be absolutely what i need from you and i really need it by this date oh right and that just go off
S0041	what
S0084	somewhere they're just not interest and they're not make to come to this meet
S0041	who's
S0084	whereas if they be
S0041	who's suppose to make them
S0084	well interestingly er interestingly enough the head of market leave in november what month be we in now march oh yeah march yeah they have no head um so it's just i mean it be a shamble before and it's er carry on be a shamble so the director of corporate affairs be suppose to be head up the section but he that mean he's in charge of like i dunno a hundred people and he he's off do his own job so in theory they report to him but they don't and he if even if he try
S0041	and really need
S0084	to call a meet about it they'd be like he's like well we'll just wait for the new person but there's no sort of er date by which er the new person's gonna be in place
S0041	what
S0084	huh it's just a fuck joke absolutely it just make you so angry and like the thing be the the er the people that you rile at understand and know
S0041	yeah
S0084	and they know that it's bad i think someone's get to take responsibility
S0041	they could just employ me interim period three months
S0084	mm mm
S0041	bosh bosh off you go
S0084	absolutely
S0041	that'd be great
S0084	well they're suppose to be go through this
S0041	they could just pay me for a little while and then
S0084	you could be like a consultant consultancy fee
S0041	yeah i be gonna do that actually
S0041	finish the last place
S0084	mm nice
S0041	consultancy but i the the clients that i know that would pay for me automatically
S0084	mm
S0041	would basically make me the same wag i could do sit there so i just think well
S0084	oh yeah you wouldn't wanna do it if they're gonna pay you a hundred pound a day
S0041	no
S0084	well that's the thing they've be pay someone a consultancy fee for the last year
S0041	huh
S0084	in order to introduce new um process review like a process review and then get everybody do work in the same way why they weren't in the first place fine whatever
S0041	yeah
S0084	they weren't so it's take them the best part of two years to do this ever since i've be there they've be do it and er finally finally the role out be next month but you just think with no head of market with no one to drive it
S0041	yeah
S0084	they're not gonna do it
S0041	doesn't matter
S0084	you're still gonna have to hold their hand you're still gonna have to tell them what you need and when
S0041	which
S0084	rather than be proactive
S0041	be extra work for you
S0084	yeah it's completely ridiculous
S0041	that's you do your own job and then make sure somebody else do theirs no
S0084	yeah
S0041	if they don't do their own job they're fire end of story
S0084	well yeah that's what er it get escalate to my operations boss who's sort of my boss while 's away um cos say this be fuck ridiculous and say you know it's only because we work our arses off to make sure that that cover be actually there in time for the book to be print you know it's only by the grace of god the book actually end up with a with a cover be
S0041	yeah
S0084	certainly not through market and she say actually you kind of want a massive cock up for them to take er
S0041	yeah
S0084	responsibility um er i mean even at christmas we have a um an instance where all the book be print you know two thousand copy have be print with no cover which mean that they manually then have to add the cover after because the cover weren't sign off it's a fuck nightmare
S0041	two thousand book
S0084	two thousand book yeah they have to manually do it which be completely ridiculous cos er what you should do be then just fee it straight through no no and that be the market team because they decide to have a massive rebrand of the exams cover last summer
S0041	gosh
S0084	oh don't get me start yeah so i'm quite look forward to a beer but i think i'd better have a shower first in case you know drown oh well also these fuck record that i've be do i submit all my invoice and i er would've the eighteen pound an hour that i get i'd calculate that for the number of hours i'd record i would've get pay three hundred and fifty five pound
S0041	oh
S0084	but in my head i forget that they would tax me on that but i think i would get pay at the end of the month because that's when invoice get pay like our back salary come out on the eighteenth so today there be an extra hundred and fifty pound in my bank in my salary cos i get pay today and i be like oh be that must that must be the record but it's two hundred quid shy
S0041	yeah
S0084	and then i think well er well they'll have tax me
S0041	not two hundred quid though
S0084	but shit yeah so but the but one of the invoice be miss so in the end it be actually two hundred and fifty pound but but with tax it be only a hundred and fifty
S0041	benefit
S0084	huh fuck me
S0041	it's that be just disgust isn't it
S0084	a hundred pound hundred pound
S0041	that can't be right
S0084	well er
S0041	that can't be right
S0084	i've chase it up with our payroll and i've say have you charge me at forty percent rather than twenty percent um and they say yeah we've charge you at twenty percent and it'll be your national insurance which be twelve percent and your student loan which be nine percent
S0041	no
S0084	so it come out at forty percent so it's a fuck joke forty percent er you you might as well just die
S0041	oh my god
S0084	i mean what the hell so that really fuck me off
S0041	that's horrendous
S0084	cos er i mean i you know i'm not really rely on it but it would've be really good
S0041	yeah
S0084	cos i need to get out of my overdraft this year that be the plan tut fine it just piss me off
S0041	that be such a pisser i'm gonna go to work tomorrow and ring the tax office about my tax code
S0084	mm
S0041	huh i'm just grateful that it's now the end of the tax year so i can rebate this past year cos they owe me at least three hundred
S0084	do they
S0041	from this year alone yeah
S0084	okay nice er yeah you've gotta keep an eye on them because er last year when i get a tax rebate from when i work i think it be from when i work at waterstones they massively tax me and um cos i work at waterstones at the same time as i go back for christmas so it be like a second job
S0041	yeah
S0084	um and i get a rebate but i didn't get my rebate until november it take them from may to november so what be that five months six months
S0041	god
S0084	to pull their finger out
S0041	it's such a piss take
S0084	yeah so
S0041	actual piss take
S0084	you know unless you actually write the letter and chase them which be what i do when i be at uni cos you need the money more when you're at uni you know at least when i be earn i have money come in but you rely on them that's the thing
S0041	i know
S0084	they're the tax office
S0041	so i've get them to contact i've get my bank to contact cos they've charge me a hundred and fifty quid for something
S0084	huh
S0041	yeah
S0084	what
S0041	something's happen right basically i've get two account
S0084	yeah
S0041	which be both at their overdraft limit as usual
S0084	yeah
S0041	since i've take this job one of them tax free student sixteen hundred quid bosh
S0084	mm
S0041	it's two hundred i pay two hundred and fifty off it so they don't really give a crap until this next september or something
S0084	mm
S0041	fine good for me the other one be five hundred interest overdraft so i pay about depend on how much i'm in the overdraft by which be usually the whole fricking lot i pay about a tenner a month
S0084	yeah
S0041	interest on it fine and when the that stupid swinton thing be come out of my
S0084	tut
S0041	account
S0084	oh yeah
S0041	and we didn't know what it be i'd go over my overdraft limit and they charge me blahdy blah blah anyway these charge have just rack up and i go in and they say oh well for every day you're over your overdraft limit we charge you twelve pound or something
S0084	per day
S0041	per day right and at the time i be in such a fluster i didn't listen and i just say what no way and then i think about it i think that's a lie i've have that overdraft at that overdraft limit since i be eighteen years old right it have be there for a hell of a long time
S0084	mm
S0041	and never once have i be charge per day like that never i've have
S0084	they can change the term though have you have any letter
S0041	no no
S0084	no
S0041	i haven't have anything so i think they've change the term of my overdraft
S0084	and not tell you
S0041	and not tell me
S0084	cos they just basically write to me and tell me they'd they'd change the term but there's fuck all you can do about it because you need your overdraft so if er cos if if you're fifteen hundred pound into your overdraft which thankfully i'm not anymore and then they say right well actually the interest free bit's over now bye bye we're gonna start charge you at nineteen percent you're fuck there's nothing you can do
S0041	really
S0084	yeah that's what happen to me and then you've gotta get out as soon as as er humanly possible you've gotta clear your overdraft because that's what they do they lower your er graduate account or your student account the interest free amount
S0041	and then flip it
S0084	and then flip it
S0041	yeah
S0084	over to interest er which be what i be expect to be do them to do at five hundred pound intervals
S0041	yes yeah
S0084	and then one day they just write to me and say right you've get
S0041	and say no
S0084	no you've gotta pay
S0041	oh shit yeah if they do that i'm fuck
S0084	and they charge you twenty five pound arrangement fee
S0041	for do it
S0084	yeah for do nothing press er push in a button on the computer
S0041	i know absolute bullshit so i'm gonna write them a letter i'm just gonna say to them cos the thing be as well it's really irresponsible lend if that's what they're
S0084	mm
S0041	say they're gonna do they can see my salary
S0084	yeah
S0041	they can see my outgo everything i have go through their bank only
S0084	they've get no morals mate
S0041	they know
S0084	mm
S0041	that there be no way on god's earth that i can afford to pay out a hundred and fifty quid
S0084	mm
S0041	plus the whatever er whatever they're gonna whack on this month
S0084	yeah
S0041	another a hundred and fifty quid
S0084	yeah who do you bank with
S0041	natwest
S0084	yeah they don't give a shit
S0041	no
S0084	my mum leave hsbc for that exact same reason because obviously she's you know she doesn't have much money because they keep charge her she would go over her overdraft because
S0041	yeah
S0084	she didn't have any money come in and er they be just like oh yeah well that's the term of the agreement sorry love on your bike so she's now with the co op who don't charge
S0041	it's just bullshit
S0084	well er it use to be that you could claim back your bank charge because they be illegal they weren't
S0041	yeah
S0084	in your contract and then they pass a judgement
S0041	i know
S0084	that say you can't
S0041	i know
S0084	but
S0041	cos they owe me about three grand and i never get it back
S0084	i know my ex boyfriend manage to get in there just at the last minute but i be look at this on the money save expert because i you know i've everyone's get bank charge i've get bank charge that i'd like to claim and it say on occasion you can send your claim to the ombudsman and they look at it all so if you be to say you know i've i'm in a very fragile delicate position because they're more likely to look at the ones for people who can't afford to pay these charge which you can't you know
S0041	no no way
S0084	you're on a very basic salary they would be more incline to look at you because you know you're live hand to mouth you're live at the
S0041	yeah
S0084	end of your overdraft you know
S0041	i'm just gonna write her a letter
S0084	compare to your salary
S0041	and just see see what response i get back cos at least if i put it in write
S0084	mm
S0041	if it ever come back on me i can say look i i try to do the responsible thing and sort this out
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	cos i don't know what the hell you do but you know
S0084	mm
S0041	it's so frustrate
S0084	mm
S0041	that they they've do it know there's no chance of me pay it back
S0084	absolutely
S0041	what the fuck you can't drop someone in the shit like that
S0084	yeah
S0041	after
S0084	well they will just take the money
S0041	yeah
S0084	that's the thing
S0041	they just take it
S0084	they'll just keep take it
S0041	and the worst part be i think
S0084	you'll get more and more in debt
S0041	how it actually happen in the first place be that they try to cash a cheque right
S0084	mm
S0041	which bounce
S0084	mm
S0041	legally they're not allow to reclaim for that cheque because they be aware then they have the knowledge that you don't have the fund
S0084	okay
S0041	and they do it twice again
S0084	do they
S0041	i think that's where
S0084	oh right
S0041	all this start spiral from so i i to be honest i don't really understand it so i'm just gonna write and say look i don't understand how this have happen i have come in and speak to you about this before you can see i pay in a cheque of two hundred pound two months ago to hopefully clear this and it hasn't it's just be eat by more charge and i'm in the same position again i don't understand it can i have a meet with you please and go through this account cos it's just gonna get out of control
S0084	yeah well i think that's all you can do really you know i mean i would look at the money save expert website because they a they give you the templates for the letter to write to the bank but and they also give you the word
S0041	mm
S0084	so they say you know maybe maybe you would want to write a an initial letter and then write them again and say well actually it's good isn't it it's my mum and she'll only complain because of my phone so you can see that my phone be still here it's not with vodafone
S0041	yeah why be that
S0084	it's not be it's not be pick up

S0041	i though oh my god if she get me on
S0084	your life be
S0041	hold she's gonna disappear
S0084	yeah
S0041	forever um she well
S0084	and by the time the next you speak to her she'll
S0084	be like no we haven't get your result
S0041	and so i make her put it all in write
S0084	okay good
S0041	and then she tell me huh and then she tell me i say how long will it take you to get them out of the archive well probably a couple of months
S0084	where be the archive
S0041	yeah i be like what you have an on site archive and it will take you two months to send me a fax and she say yeah yeah i mean it's it's rather it's rather big not extensive big it's rather big
S0041	i say oh
S0041	i say it must be pretty massive
S0041	um
S0084	it's gonna take you two months to trek through it
S0041	yeah and she say you know i'm sure you can appreciate again this be not our top priority we've get students here at the moment that we're try to get through their exams and i say i'm sure that's great i say but whatever come happen hell or high water all your students will sit their exams if you don't actually walk down to the archive and get me that piece
S0041	of paper i will be in this position chase things in january i have an official application go through and i'm request information it's not a choice
S0084	mm
S0041	you don't have a choice whether or not to provide me with that
S0084	mm
S0041	if you don't give it to me as i request it the royal navy will request it from you officially
S0084	mm
S0041	and then you'll be oblige to do it so i'm basically give you a head's up
S0084	mm mm
S0041	right well i'll see what we can do she just wasn't get it it's as if she it wasn't her job to do it as if she wasn't the person
S0084	yeah
S0041	get it in write now i don't hold out much hope
S0084	well at least you've get it in write huh
S0041	i actually debate drive up there
S0084	tut
S0041	er that's how much easier
S0084	well
S0041	it would be
S0084	it would be easier but i mean you might get there and them go oh well you can't have access to the archive oh and then that would be worse because you'd probably punch her in the face
S0041	yeah i think also about
S0084	how frustrate
S0041	write a letter say
S0084	yeah
S0041	i think i'll keep the i'll print the and just say look i don't know what type of staff you're employ but there's clearly a bite of a communication problem here
S0084	mm
S0041	if i have to drive to sheffield
S0084	mm
S0041	to collect it i will be claim back my mileage
S0084	absolutely i mean ultimately they have a um a duty of care
S0041	yeah
S0084	you be a student once
S0041	yeah
S0084	do you know what i mean it's not like you you you exit out the door
S0041	it's not a big school liz
S0084	really
S0041	it's not a big school it's not like a city school with thousands of students
S0084	mm
S0041	in the entire school there's two thousand students four hundred of those be sixth formers
S0084	oh right
S0041	so it's not
S0084	no it's tiny
S0041	yeah
S0084	i can't believe they need your certificate from school when you've get a degree
S0041	i know
S0084	that's mental
S0041	but they've say you know if we don't have the certificate this be the next best thing a letter from your school you'd think thank for that bite of leeway
S0084	yeah
S0041	come on school buck it up
S0041	no huh
S0084	i mean i'm really ridiculous with things like that so i've keep all mine but
S0041	i think might have them
S0084	but no we don't wanna go down that road
S0041	no
S0084	i mean you're better off you know you'd prefer to be on the phone to some retard than have to actually you know strike up communication with your mum
S0041	yeah so that be
S0084	well worst case scenario then that's a trip to er the north
S0041	so worst case scenario gonna go
S0084	where's your school wrexham
S0041	yeah near sheffield um
S0084	uh
S0041	also in in addition i ring the navy people
S0084	mm
S0041	and say look i don't know i'm i'm stick now and i need to choose which job i wanna do
S0084	oh
S0041	i can't decide now
S0084	yeah
S0041	it's problematic and he be like right okay i say so i'm gonna come in and see you what be you do on friday cos i've get the day off and he say right let me just get your paperwork do you pass your recruit test yeah what do you get and i think i can't tell you cos i'm not suppose to know i know i pass it
S0084	mm
S0041	okay so he check that i'm can do both job yeah lovely gotta go in and see him on friday
S0084	mm
S0041	and he be like i say i'm gonna need quite a bite of time i have a lot of question all the question
S0084	all of those question
S0041	um and he say okay well don't worry um have you have a look on the website do it and every other website in the world yes and he be like right er
S0041	i say um i'll bring biscuits he be like okay can i have hobnob and i say yes that's fine he say right it's a date i'll see you at one on friday
S0084	oh nice
S0041	yeah
S0084	oh that sound good
S0041	so
S0084	that'll just you know give you the opportunity to just ask every question you've ever hear of you know
S0041	yep
S0084	and get it clear in your mind
S0084	that's interest though that you've have a bite of a one eighty
S0041	yeah i don't i don't know i i huh
S0084	be it purely financial then or do you just think you'll have more fun or
S0041	i i think i would have more fun
S0084	yeah
S0041	which be what i'd i'm think this be gonna be my whole life
S0084	yeah and and it's short term as well you know
S0041	yeah
S0084	so it's only if you be only gonna sign up for four years
S0041	you want to make the most of that
S0084	you wanna have the best time
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know it's not er you don't you don't i suppose you don't know but you don't know whether it's gonna be fifteen years you know if it's fifteen years you might wanna go in as an officer and really you know work your arse off and
S0041	yeah
S0084	make it your career but if you're only gonna do it for four years
S0041	yeah or even
S0084	might as well
S0041	six years
S0084	yeah
S0041	but i think you know you don't go to work do your job and come home
S0084	mm
S0041	you don't
S0084	mm
S0041	your home life be with the people that you work with all the time
S0084	mm
S0041	and if you don't like the people you work with cos er per vessel per ship there's only eighteen officer out of the two hundred people on that ship
S0084	oh really
S0041	yeah
S0084	wow
S0041	there's a real big difference and so i think i know it sound awful but i think huh if they're all kiss arses
S0084	mm
S0041	and not fun at all and i'm stick with two people that i would actually be friends with
S0084	mm
S0041	that's really not gonna be a nice lifestyle for months and months and months at a time
S0084	yeah
S0041	so that's that's my only thing my think my think process because really graduate wise the majority of them be bore fuckers
S0084	yeah
S0041	like people that be gonna go in there do engineer
S0084	mm
S0041	and satellite navigation stuff
S0084	mm
S0041	at officer level be gonna be pretty clue up
S0084	mm
S0041	i can't imagine there be a lot of fun
S0084	no
S0041	i can't i can't see it so i just i i think intellectually i'd be much happier do the officer job
S0084	yeah
S0041	but i'd be will to sacrifice that if i would enjoy my time there
S0084	well absolutely yeah i mean that's what life's about isn't it you've gotta really enjoy it
S0041	mm
S0084	ultimately but um what be i gonna say like what would your responsibilities be if you be just rat like what would you be do what would your job be
S0041	that's what i wanna know
S0084	oh right
S0041	cos i don't really know er because michael can't i have him on the phone last night for two and a half hours
S0084	shit
S0041	yeah two and a half hours i mean a lot of it be not navy relate
S0084	mm
S0041	but he's like i can't really describe it to you cos you do so many different things all the time
S0084	right
S0041	if you be as a rat
S0084	mm
S0041	then it's really change so you'd be he say i don't i can't tell you er he be like
S0084	mm
S0041	if i be gonna choose that's what i'd do
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos he's a communications specialist which be like one below
S0084	oh okay
S0041	so the progression path for both be different
S0084	mm
S0041	i don't think i don't know if er he obviously can't cross over or if he can he can't do it or something i dunno
S0084	oh
S0041	but an officer he say basically he spend quite a lot of time pretty standard i say what do you mean he say you well like you know in front of a computer make decisions go to meet do the paperwork write report for the rat so it sound very much like a manager job anywhere
S0084	mm
S0041	with more fun throw in he say the only thing i can see you get fuck off with be that because you're at the same level for so long a lot of your time will be train for you as well
S0084	mm
S0041	and they just they spend a lot a lot of time plan and i be a planner i do it now it fuck me off though fuck me off
S0084	right
S0041	and they er they plan for stuff and it's not even real stuff it's test stuff
S0084	mm
S0041	so you might spend he say you might spend three or four weeks plan
S0084	mm
S0041	for a fake attack that never
S0084	mm
S0041	be never gonna actually happen
S0084	mm seem a bite redundant doesn't it
S0041	yeah it do
S0084	but then i suppose that's that's the nature of the beast isn't it they rely on people like you like you could spin it on its head yeah the your test doesn't come up but it mean that you're prepare because it could and in fact in real life it could so it's better
S0041	yeah
S0084	to be prepare and at least you know cos you er ultimately you don't wanna be in a position where you sort of let your guard down do you know what i mean like you're really responsible
S0041	that's it
S0084	you're responsible for people's safety for their live
S0041	yeah
S0084	and and if that mean that you know you're prepare for something that never actually happen in reality it could happen
S0041	yeah
S0084	and you wanna make sure that you're prepare for it
S0041	yeah
S0084	so it's what it's how you get satisfaction from your job i suppose
S0041	that's what i'm think and be i really gonna get satisfaction out of do that
S0084	mm
S0041	i don't know
S0084	mm
S0041	until i actually know what they do from day to day i want somebody to say if i be to plan you an average week in this job this be what you can expect to do
S0084	mm
S0041	if someone i don't think it's too much to expect
S0084	oh no
S0041	if somebody ask me to my job i'd be able to tell them
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	it's vary
S0084	yeah
S0041	but i know it's gonna be contract answer e mail quote stuff chase people show people round the hotel
S0084	mm
S0041	plan weddings order stuff from suppliers it's
S0084	mm
S0041	it's vary but you you it stop somewhere
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	but every time i've ask it seem like they can't they can't give me the the box version
S0084	boundaries
S0041	they're just say it's just it's so different it's so vary and
S0084	well maybe the reality of it
S0041	from what i can gather
S0084	be be that the the er just like in any er in any job you're probably do a lot of the same stuff but there as an officer you're look at it from a top level and you're responsible for people so you're responsible for their
S0041	yeah
S0084	train
S0041	that's what say he say you'll find that the rat that do ct be technically much more accurate and capable than the
S0084	mm
S0041	officer
S0084	mm
S0041	but the officer oversee more people do
S0084	yeah
S0041	it
S0084	well you're cos you're not you're not actually do the job necessarily yourself be you
S0041	no
S0084	you're just you have an understand of it but because you you're do so much other stuff you only see it from a top level
S0041	yeah
S0084	not at a micro level because it's like be you'd be
S0041	it's not necessary be it
S0084	micromanaging otherwise
S0041	yeah
S0084	wouldn't you
S0041	so um
S0084	sound like a good idea sound like a good time to go and speak to him you know while you're a bite
S0041	and while i'm there i'm gonna fill out all the paperwork in the world they ever need and just give it to them there
S0084	yeah nice
S0041	instead of post it
S0084	well er hopefully you'll at least have your letter from the school by then
S0041	mm
S0084	finger cross
S0041	fuck bastards huh
S0084	i mean it seem unlikely i don't they're probably they're probably pass on that probably be quite a challenge conversation for her
S0041	i think that be the end of her life yeah and do you know what her name be
S0084	er
S0084	oh no
S0041	yeah and i think you be exactly why i'm a and not a you
S0084	yeah
S0041	and really just before i speak to her and i have this thing in the office that you have an idea of what people of a certain name be like and you come up today and er
S0084	mm
S0041	we don't know a a a nasty
S0084	mm
S0041	all the between us that we both know none of them be nasty
S0084	ah okay
S0041	so you come out as a nice always a nice well round person like balance persons be so you be in that category
S0084	excellent
S0041	and i say what do you what would you think of when you see a
S0084	mm
S0041	cos i mention that didn't realize be my real name and he's know me all my life
S0084	right okay
S0041	um and he say to be honest quite meek and mild usually mousy hair or blonde
S0084	mm
S0041	not really much of a muchness
S0084	mm
S0041	not very capable and i be like yeah i see that and all the i've ever know
S0084	mm
S0041	have be quite like that or quite swotty studiers
S0084	um what have i know i see cliquey bitchy girls actually
S0041	oh do you
S0084	sort of but that could be where er i've come from like my background's quite middle upper class
S0041	mm
S0084	so i think the girls that i go to school with be a bite like that they're a bite sort of girls who play hockey you know
S0041	mm
S0084	netball girls although the girl that you know i work with a couple of s at waterstones and they be one be very arty but a bite simple
S0041	mm
S0084	big eye like kermit eye like white all the way around freakish
S0041	wow
S0084	and the other one be a teacher love kid
S0041	mm
S0084	a bite scary
S0041	i see this

S0084	so that's quite nice well i suppose that happen more and more doesn't it you know kid be name and baptize the the derivatives as oppose to the the formal name
S0041	yeah
S0084	and you get s and s and s or you know

S0084	that's quite good
S0041	i just eat half the bag and half the dip
S0084	mm
S0041	and then i be on the phone to for two hours and by one o'clock in the morning i be hungry so i eat the rest of them
S0084	you're an absolute maniac well i didn't hear you be you on the phone really late then ah
S0041	keen mhm
S0084	chat
S0041	mm
S0084	where be he then so he's not on a boat
S0041	mm mm he's get a month's holiday
S0084	he's be on holiday
S0041	oh
S0084	for like three months or something
S0041	yeah
S0084	face
S0041	yeah
S0084	right
S0041	he's get a month's holiday and then he'll get post around the uk
S0084	mm
S0041	cos he's not go on tour
S0084	oh right
S0041	apparently um
S0084	right
S0041	and he be on about want me to get a hotel room in nottingham cos that's half way between the two of us
S0084	right tempt
S0041	very tempt very tempt um so we toy around with that idea
S0084	lovely
S0041	but er i'm a little bite concern that he be see this girl
S0084	mm
S0041	which he doesn't seem to give a crap about which i don't it's nothing to do with me
S0041	just do what i want
S0084	mm
S0041	um but he's like it's all very much in jest as in we wouldn't ask the other one if they fancy the other one
S0084	right
S0041	or how how much they like them or anything that would have any type of emotion attach to it because of the very strange situ
S0084	cousin situ
S0041	yeah um to which i find out he actually google sex with your cousin
S0041	i be like you do what i say you do realize that that'll be on your computer now and we're not actually relate i mean can you
S0041	let's back track a second you do realize we're not actually relate
S0084	there's no blood please not be go there
S0041	um and he be like well he say either way if he'd get on a ship cos apparently if you go in as an officer then you can choose your ship after the year or something
S0084	nice
S0041	you can nominate somewhere
S0084	okay
S0041	and he's get this whole fantasy in his head that because obviously our name aren't the same or anything cos we're not really relate then i could nominate to go on his ship um
S0084	and you could shag him all the time
S0041	yeah shag him off so that's quite amuse
S0084	apart from the risk of the old court martialling or whatever it be
S0041	yes
S0084	they do to you
S0041	yeah mm apart from that
S0084	mm
S0041	um but then he be say stuff like that he'd google it and i be like right okay um now a bite concern he say and it turn out anyway eight eighty percent of muslims be um marry to their cousins anyway you do realize we're not muslim either
S0041	like um he be just so funny he's such a clever dick
S0041	i think what i be like i want to knock on your forehead and make sure
S0084	yeah
S0041	there's somebody inside cos this be not okay
S0084	you're not cousins and you're certainly not muslims
S0084	so
S0041	muslims yeah
S0084	all in all everything's fine
S0041	yeah um
S0084	no need to worry reassure
S0041	yeah reassure to know thank for that
S0041	but um er and he be like but then he keep make comment like not just muslims that be with their cousin or sleep with cousins but marriage to their cousins
S0084	right
S0041	um and i'm probably read too much into it but then he be ask about how many people i'd sleep with and stuff
S0084	mm
S0041	his number's off the scale
S0084	uh
S0041	hundred and fifty mark
S0084	boys in the navy be disgust that's gonna be you yeah
S0041	no i've say no he say he say you say no now but imagine be pester all the time all the time by all the men you could choose any single one of them you want it's they just cos they're all trap on a ship together
S0084	and you and if you wear the sex top you'll have to leave the sex top at home
S0084	don't wear the sex top
S0041	oh yeah that's quite bad
S0084	you might actually run the risk of rohypnol in your drink
S0041	yep um what be i say to you ah
S0084	so you're not gonna shag any of them
S0041	no i'm not allow to shag any of them um and he be like ask ask he be ask basically where he rank
S0084	mm
S0041	on my scale of sleep with
S0084	yep
S0041	um
S0084	that that rank yeah
S0041	that rankage which to which he get a percentage
S0084	mm
S0041	of top five percent
S0084	oh
S0041	yeah pretty good
S0084	wow
S0041	um which it be quite an awkward conversation for me to have with him cos it's just
S0084	mm
S0041	it shouldn't have really happen and we both want this to happen again
S0084	yeah
S0041	even though we shouldn't really do it at all and he be like say how next time he see me be obviously gonna be at some family thing
S0084	oo
S0041	and he say i just don't know how i'm gonna be with you like i can see it be really awkward
S0084	mm
S0041	cos obviously people say to him have you hear from and he's say no
S0084	mm
S0041	cos he want to say yes but he's scar he's second guess that they'll
S0084	yeah
S0041	be second guess
S0084	yeah
S0041	i say they're not you're in the fricking navy they know the they know the game
S0084	yeah
S0041	stop overthinking it cos you're gonna make it worse

S0084	he say that to you
S0041	yeah and i want to reply like that's all i can ever see you as like

S0084	possibles
S0041	possibles and he be like oh yeah a couple and ask me about it i say no nothing serious just you know say anyway no boyfriend not after the last one seriously men need to man up
S0084	mm

S0084	mm
S0041	and he say oh well i'm you know i'm like that cos he's a really lad's lad type he say well you know i'm like that when you know when you're in love with someone basically try to tell me that he be really very affectionate and very lovely and not like the part of me that the part of him that i usually see
S0084	mm

S0084	all mean he's not a potential boyfriend
S0041	he's definitely not potential boyfriend material
S0084	no
S0041	no way jose none whatsoever
S0084	but that be not to say one cannot have fun with one's whatever he be
S0041	i think we need to invent a word really
S0084	yeah
S0041	i don't know what that would be
S0084	i dunno we'll have to think about that um

S0041	anything below cambridge be all together in london
S0084	i've get absolutely no idea positively despair

S0084	sunderland but she have to tell me that er yeah that that's where that be
S0041	i feel the need i feel the need
S0084	draw draw draw the country please
S0041	right so don't really know there's like a bite that come out there isn't there
S0084	yeah east anglia
S0041	and that's i think that's like scotland up there or something
S0084	yeah
S0041	right so we're gonna pretend that we're about here aren't we
S0084	er no
S0041	this be the foot come out there
S0084	yeah very very nice so that's
S0041	that be the bite of norfolk isn't it there
S0084	that's norfolk suffolk we're that's probably mm if that be there that's probably leicester that's london that's norwich
S0041	yeah
S0084	we're probably about here
S0041	oh right okay
S0084	and newcastle's here yeah
S0041	yeah newcastles's about here
S0084	okay that's all i know
S0041	so that scottish border's probably about there actually
S0084	okay
S0041	but
S0084	fine
S0041	um i don't really know all the whether they're that way or that way i only know kind of in order as you hit them if you drive up the country
S0084	okay
S0041	so the first place you'd hit from us you'd probably hit peterborough
S0084	yeah
S0041	so for an hour
S0084	yeah
S0041	you carry on drive for another hour you hit nottingham
S0084	oh right okay
S0041	you carry on drive oh i've i've get load and load of space leave right
S0041	peterborough we'll go peterborough here
S0084	yeah
S0041	that's probably a bite closer isn't it peterborough's probably there nottingham's probably there
S0084	yeah
S0041	and then this little bite where the the water come in
S0084	yeah
S0041	be hull
S0084	oh
S0041	so between nottingham here and hull here in the middle be sheffield
S0084	oh okay
S0041	so that's where i live right in the middle
S0084	right
S0041	so it go us peterborough nottingham sheffield hull
S0084	yeah
S0041	manchester's over that way a bite
S0084	oh
S0041	leeds be just here
S0084	okay
S0041	and then after tut see after hull i don't really know what come after that but from here to here be about three and a half hours
S0084	be it
S0041	yeah
S0084	fuck hell
S0041	or
S0084	that's really far
S0041	yeah or maybe that's three and a half hours from sheffield yeah it's really far from here it's about three hundred miles
S0041	so it would take me half the time if i drive from here to sheffield that's half way between here and newcastle
S0084	shit man and that's where you drive to at christmas wasn't it newcastle
S0041	i drive to sheffield and then my dad do this route
S0084	oh right
S0041	so i do this route
S0084	which be two hours
S0041	and dad do this route yeah
S0084	no two three hours
S0041	yeah
S0084	two hours to nottingham three hours to sheffield yeah
S0041	yeah it's probably take me about i always leave three hours to get home to sheffield but you probably could do it in two and a half
S0084	with your drive yep
S0041	yeah
S0084	foot down
S0041	and then from here to here be about the same
S0084	three hours
S0041	two and a half three hours
S0084	fuck
S0084	that's much further than i think it be gonna be
S0041	yeah er in between
S0084	actually
S0041	there be manchester at some point i think it's over that side though i think it's level with hull but the other side
S0084	i i think i didn't think that that be lower i think that be higher i think sheffield be up there
S0041	ah
S0084	er well basically i just think everything's here
S0041	mm
S0084	all of the place
S0041	there's durham here
S0084	be there
S0041	durham between these two
S0084	and then you've get coventry round there somewhere haven't you
S0041	oh be that round there i dunno
S0084	prr
S0041	middlesbrough must be somewhere round this point as well
S0084	no it's
S0041	all i know be
S0084	middlesbrough's near sheffield isn't it
S0041	be no norther that's near
S0084	norther
S0041	norther
S0084	we're such retard
S0041	that's near newcastle
S0084	oh right
S0041	so there's there's sheffield and then god know what after that hull
S0084	hull yeah
S0041	leeds
S0084	place you don't wanna go
S0041	yeah hull leeds then a bite of a gap
S0084	mm
S0041	then you get to kind of middlesbrough and durham area i don't know
S0084	yeah because that's where the dales and
S0041	cos that's where the accent change
S0084	ah
S0041	that's how i know it
S0084	right
S0041	so then you hit more countryside and then the accent change from a yorkshire accent to a what people get confuse with a newcastle accent
S0084	yeah
S0041	they get really twangy
S0084	oh like county durham
S0041	and then newcastle
S0084	yeah
S0041	yeah and then scotland
S0084	and then the border
S0041	i mean there must be something between newcastle and scotland
S0084	sheep
S0041	but in my head sheep and scotland
S0084	i don't think there's much carry on up there anyway
S0041	no
S0084	it's fricking freeze and then liverpool's over here yeah
S0041	yeah
S0084	on the coast
S0041	liverpool and manchester be over here somewhere dunno dunno isn't liverpool near wales
S0084	liverpool be above wales so that's that'd be wales and liverpool's up there
S0041	yeah
S0084	because the ferry to belfast would be back there
S0041	go from there
S0084	yeah
S0041	ah
S0084	that's why you've get load of irish people in liverpool
S0041	so maybe it go manchester then liverpool
S0084	manchester's kind of in the middle isn't it
S0041	yeah
S0084	i mean listen to me i'm talk absolute shite
S0084	it could be er i mean it could be anywhere
S0041	it definitely take from hull to drive to manchester be on the same road so er there's a road that go across country that go from hull to manchester direct
S0084	oh right okay
S0041	cos i be like manchester be you kid me they're miles away from each other but i think it's about an hour and a half
S0084	ah well it's good to know that it's not just my geography
S0041	yeah no mine's cack
S0084	i mean yours sound pretty good
S0041	oh no everything from down here's london that's it
