S0589	oh
S0588	er improve libraries and leisure facilities so they say
S0589	sound that's not too bad
S0588	but it's a nice build
S0589	look darling the independent's go under
S0588	that be sudden when do that happen now
S0589	do you remember when it launch
S0588	yeah it be nineties wasn't it or be it eighties be no one buy it then no really that must be the case
S0589	they're not gonna print it any more
S0588	oh erm even
S0589	meow
S0588	i think that must be the same for all paper isn't it

S0589	you don't approve of chip
S0588	be that a little grunt that be a grunt wasn't it
S0589	chip be bore
S0588	right this be the plan that's the façade at the front
S0589	yeah i think that's alright then
S0588	well it's a shame to knock down
S0589	what's gonna be in it
S0588	one of the decent build though isn't it
S0589	it's not the decent build
S0588	it be a decent build
S0589	but that front bite they're keep you say
S0588	yeah only the façade
S0589	it's a weird build inside cos the library be only a little the front two room and you can't even go through to the upstairs can you
S0588	but apparently there's a gym but i dunno where that be exactly
S0589	yeah that's behind it that's where i erm play badminton
S0588	mm be it a separate build or the same build
S0589	it's a separate build
S0588	but it seem like a huge build so what be the other room
S0589	maybe they're join it all up
S0588	well or knock it down it won't be there any more except for the very front façade
S0589	i don't know what's behind other than the other than the main build the erm the gym part be just like in a concrete and corrugate iron build
S0588	right so not
S0589	corrugate steel
S0588	the old but they're talk about a really rundown gym do you think it be really run down
S0589	yeah like i say it's just like it's like it be build in the nineteen forties in a week
S0588	yeah cos they're gonna that's what they're i mean there might be good things that would come out of it that's what they're hop to improve but so there's the library which be a very nice build though so all that's gonna go at the side there but you'd have the front i don't know maybe it's a good thing but i'm just keep you inform
S0589	well yes
S0588	the thing be you need to read erm don't let that unplug again
S0589	local matter for local people
S0588	yeah you need to read all the comment so you've get some knowledge on it
S0588	but they're vote on it on wednesday so our chance be this week really or now i mean and erm also but there's a chance it could get list by english heritage which would save it as well if it become a list build
S0589	wow it would be cool though to have a contemporary gym and leisure centre there
S0588	i've not read all those but there's not enough information about what's actually go to be in it it just depend if they've actually what's in the thing i mean yeah but if you think in thirty years' time be we gonna still like the build or be we gonna wish to have the old build back cos they don't really age very well do they the older build victorian and georgian build age very well well they all look lovely don't they i'm not just be nostalgic
S0589	oh look i know that build
S0588	be that a façade joke that he's talk about
S0589	no that's they really do that
S0588	what the
S0589	just preserve that
S0588	that's the
S0589	and then build that thing behind it
S0588	but there's no windows in it
S0589	no they just have to legally preserve that bite so that's what they do
S0588	why didn't they put windows in it though
S0589	it's just by erm it's in well they don't need to it's not part of the actual construction
S0588	the build that's weird
S0589	it's horrible it actually look really impressive when it be just stand up there with no build oh god look at that
S0588	oh my god what that's a façade oh that's ridiculous so's that oh well it won't be as bad as that though because
S0589	no
S0588	they're not just go over the top of it like that
S0589	oh god that's
S0588	well the thing be now's our chance to stop more ugliness from occur and i'm think of that lovely post office in this be what i'm think of cos nobody kick up a fuss about that and they just
S0589	yeah
S0588	knock it down
S0589	look at this dear
