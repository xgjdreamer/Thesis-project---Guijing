S0439	but he's just a bite better he's not as like sickly look or just like pointy look or just like ill look
S0441	he look a little bite more healthy
S0439	he genuinely just use to look ill though didn't he be just like odd look no you see i he's never gonna be sexy but he's not as unattractive as he use to be

S0441	what be it seriously guy like seriously
S0439	i mean i me and look nothing like each other
S0441	no
S0439	like it'd be it'd be weird you know it would be more likely that he'd fancy me then fancy because me and be probably more similar but to fancy and me and not be a bite bizarre cos completely different look
S0441	maybe he like maybe he really like personality maybe
S0439	cos i have an amaze personality
S0441	maybe he maybe he saw something in your personality that he like
S0439	true maybe mm god that be a weird picture of
S0441	mm
S0439	a bite shaggy wasn't he
S0441	mm
S0439	he's bulk up now he's really muscly
S0441	i haven't get him on facebook though
S0439	you're not facebook friends
S0441	i haven't have my facebook for age
S0439	have you not
S0441	like years
S0441	facebook
S0439	i love facebook stalk people it's like the only way you're you're legitimately allow to stalk somebody without anybody like care although me and be do that on monday night and she accidentally like nearly tag her ex boyfriend in one of his own profile picture
S0439	she be like look at him he wasn't he wasn't very good look be he shit and er she nearly we wasn't sure we weren't sure whether she actually do it
S0439	and then we have to go back and double check
S0439	and she be like oh my god oh my god
S0441	that's so embarrass
S0439	cos what do you do like it's gonna it'd come up on his news fee and have tag you in your own facebook profile
S0441	from fifteen years ago
S0439	yeah
S0439	erm be you facebook stalk me by any chance
S0441	it's like instagram when you scroll down
S0439	yeah
S0441	and you get to like eighty three weeks in and you like something that's really obviously that you've obviously be
S0439	stalk
S0441	stalk i've only get him erm from this time last year
S0439	i yeah be it him look up at you
S0441	mm
S0439	yeah i think that's the same i don't really know i don't really look at 's profile very often it's only cos he put a photo recently up and he have like a massive like bulge bicep i be like you clearly have nothing else to do in australia apart from go to the gym apparently
S0439	mm look very brown though
S0441	yeah he always look really brown though
S0439	i've also get some other news which be not as good
S0441	what
S0439	er my mum might be make redundant
S0441	oh god
S0439	yeah
S0441	why
S0439	cos erm you know they're be make into an academy
S0441	yeah
S0439	they literally all come in on monday so they have a week back come in on monday and the head teacher be like pretty much all your job be at risk
S0441	as in the whole staff
S0439	yeah well er all the admin
S0441	okay
S0439	i'm not sure about erm be make redundant like i think his be er he have officially be make redundant
S0441	shit
S0439	all the head of house have be not head of house that's a harry potter reference
S0439	all the head of year have be make redundant but don't tell anybody cos i don't know like mum's job be up be one of the candidates for redundancy
S0441	so like be head of year teachers as well they've be make redundant anyway
S0439	i don't think they're teachers i think head of year be just people who be like who look after the year group
S0441	like be head of year wasn't she
S0439	possibly yeah i think they actually create roles specifically
S0441	oh okay so
S0439	for people who be head of year erm but i think because mum's probably one of the highest pay admin staff she be at risk
S0439	be at risk erm and they're gonna release some job because obviously what be they gonna do without mum
S0441	i hate these things cos they all like obviously they've gotta cut money don't they so they're just like oh get rid of her
S0439	yeah
S0441	because she's really expensive but then shit happen down the line
S0439	yeah
S0441	because you're not
S0439	cos you don't have an exams officer
S0441	yeah
S0439	and 's be make redundant like i think she have officially be er make redundant
S0441	be that your mum's friend
S0439	er the one mum's assistant person
S0441	yeah
S0439	so yeah they're literally hack hack back
S0441	can't they just hack people back that aren't as important that sound really horrible but
S0439	like teachers
S0441	well people that be sort of less lower like less pay
S0439	mm
S0441	and hack back more
S0439	yeah
S0441	and then it'll be the equivalent because
S0439	apparently all four deputy head be keep all four pas though
S0441	oh great
S0439	yeah so you might not have an exams officer but at least you have a secretary to write up all the note when parent complain about the fact that you don't have an exams officer
S0441	yeah and write all the report for you
S0439	yeah
S0441	four deputy head
S0439	apparently so with four pas well one no one head teacher and four deputy head sorry and all four of them have pas
S0441	
S0439	i don't know how many well because they be probably cos their school be now like sixteen hundred people
S0441	true
S0439	cos they've just take on the the year
S0439	eights and sevens haven't they but yeah so i'm not entirely i'm just not sure what they're think because no offence but mum's job be really important
S0441	what be they gonna do without her
S0439	i don't know
S0441	be they gonna like get somebody else
S0439	i er genuinely don't know like no one else
S0441	do it differently
S0439	like how else can you organise exams
S0441	cos you've get like a lot of experience go
S0439	yeah
S0441	she know what she's do
S0439	like she be the only person who can use sims she's the only person who do data she be the only person who know how to organise an exam and do like all the data entry sheet for the grade so i'm not entirely sure what they're think of do
S0439	but like mum's worry that they'll make them both redundant and then get them to like get her and to like apply for the same job but then mum's like i don't want to go up against in a job
S0439	i'm like well you're gonna have to aren't you
S0441	yeah i suppose i suppose you have to
S0439	yeah
S0439	so yeah well not scary time but
S0441	not very nice
S0439	sad time it's just so stupid to bring them back one week after like term start to then threaten them with redundancy
S0441	should've do it before term even start
S0439	yeah cos then it give them the chance to find a new job like
S0441	yeah
S0439	all the post for school would've come up during the summer holiday
S0441	yeah
S0439	so now all of these people who work in the school won't be able to get job really until next year
S0441	no
S0439	if they want to go back into education
S0441	yeah
S0439	so
S0441	
S0439	yeah she could work for like or you know one of the exam board and stuff like that
S0439	but i don't know she literally find out on monday and that be dad's sixtieth birthday so
S0441	oh
S0439	cos we be gonna drive over to and take her out for lunch cos dad have the day off as well so erm yeah
S0441	i remember you say
S0439	and then so she ring up and be like don't come like i can't really go out for lunch and celebrate when all these people be at risk of lose their job and then she ring back an hour later and be like actually i might be at risk of lose my job it be like oh fuck luckily dad's salary be okay to er cos they don't have to pay their mortgage off anymore so i think they have like they've get enough
S0441	but still
S0439	but it's still like just the mental side of just you can't just retire at fifty eight years old
S0441	oh my goodness your mum will literally become addict to online poker
S0439	yeah yeah she'll just sit there on the ipad all day
S0441	she will
S0439	and do nothing for like the next
S0441	this can't happen
S0439	the next thirty years of her life
S0441	this can't happen
S0439	no dad's like you have to do something
S0441	oh or she'll just continuously watch box set over and over and over and over again
S0439	yeah
S0439	she'll know er know buffy inside out she already know buffy inside out
S0441	she can't do that
S0439	no buffy what else would she start watch she'd start just watch like everything
S0441	she wouldn't even care anymore she'd just start watch it
S0439	no she she it'd just be awful so
S0441	or she'd just go wild with the credit card
S0439	she can't go wild with the credit card she hasn't get any money
S0441	but just imagine the temptation
S0439	but then dad would have all control over the money
S0441	true
S0439	she wouldn't
S0441	wouldn't be any of hers would it
S0439	no it'd all be his
S0441	i can imagine her stroll around the kitchen think oh i really need a
S0439	new mixer
S0441	yeah
S0439	oh will you give me the money no
S0441	i really need an apple corer
S0439	no you don't
S0439	she'd have to ask him for money
S0441	oh no oh no she'd hate that
S0439	she would hate that so much she still have access to all his credit card and everything but still
S0439	i i don't know what she do with her money
S0441	we've we've already have this discussion
S0439	yeah
S0439	like i think she get pay something like twenty six thousand pound which be about say hypothetically it's fifteen hundred a month what do she do with it
S0439	she doesn't have any bill to pay cos dad pay them all she doesn't have a mortgage to pay cos it's do
S0441	she buy shit we've already say this
S0439	what the fuck mum what the fuck be you
S0441	gamble it all away on
S0439	she probably do and buy bloody cook book
S0441	cook book and box set
S0441	game for her ipad
S0439	clothe
S0441	woolly jumpers
S0439	yeah woolly jumpers her and her woolly jumpers haircuts i i suppose she go to the
S0441	glass

S0439	it's just past
S0441	oh okay

S0439	yeah she do love them i always find them a bite clumpy and a bite thick
S0441	be a doc marten kinda person

S0441	mm
S0439	and i can't do it
S0441	too much hassle
S0439	yep people'd just be like what the fuck be you wear on your feet
