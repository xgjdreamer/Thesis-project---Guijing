S0463	perhaps right to buy wasn't such a good idea
S0456	mm
S0463	you know er you couldn't have have this conversation this wasn't part of the discourse
S0456	no
S0463	five years ago
S0456	i think the the the clearest thing about right to buy be because people still need a right to buy i have that on the doorstep oh yeah because i hadn't decide because we've get our council well not council but house association be you think about buy erm but obviously alison alison mcgowen get in but
S0463	the crime be about the crime be about the capital receipt you can you
S0456	that one and of course that here there there there wasn't a firm and secure way that people keep it rather than it get buy and then it's just object of speculation
S0463	oh no cos
S0456	cos most of the right to buy they're not with the buyers they're with big new landlords who
S0463	but it be even worse at the start because at the start which people don't remember i do because it be my first job at council be that the local councils themselves give mortgage as well as bank and they be give a hundred percent mortgage and they be give a hundred percent mortgage to sixty year old people and then repossess their home when they couldn't pay and and they be on commission to sell those properties
S0456	so there there be a mini two thousand eight already yeah because that be what it be sell to those you know subprime
S0463	yeah yeah that's right yeah absolutely yeah yeah
S0456	yeah because i remember er one of my elderly neighbour be say that
S0463	and the kid be bug them their parent as well into into do it
S0456	oh yeah because it's they know
S0463	they'll inherit it
S0456	it'll be theirs
S0463	yeah yeah
S0456	well that be hope place the play that i saw last summer not this summer in in the everyman that be all about it they have this house in hope place and it be council and parent have die the one who look after the mother i suppose the one unmarried spinster be live there but all the kid obviously inherit it when their mother die and they be dead keen you know that we'll get zillions for this get the estate agent and of course the whole history that be be really the story but yeah that be there
S0463	yeah
S0456	because they and they bully the older sister into it and er she she didn't like it
S0463	yes i mean for example there be a where i work we take stock transfer over load of properties from council and there be one big house that be house a family of eight so clearly you know worth quite a lot of money and the amount of our chief exec go through to try and get them out so she could sell the place i stop him and tell him look what you're try to do be illegal but that's it you know once you put these properties into the hand of a chief exec rather than an unaccounted er sorry an elect representative erm they're just think bottom line bottom line bottom line
S0456	mm mm yeah well it's just well just look at what's go on here that er be be be clear because the rent be cheaper in the new build it's like rent
S0463	oh be that why
S0456	who's own them yeah no it's have you hear of the internal market do that sound familiar
S0463	mm
S0456	that must be the one that it be because as far as i would think the whole area and every build on it belong to the university so the rent who would charge them it's the university
S0463	who would be pay rent why would the university be pay rent
S0456	no it it it's same in in britain this be why you have you use max yeah in britain by law universities have to make maximum use of the property portfolio that they have it's the law so much for them be free the best thing be educa be the place that have two large erm lecture theatres and our student number haven't drop so they have to rent back something the build that they have otherwise abandon because our dean be now no longer there he's there i'm in educa come next week
S0463	oh really
S0456	yeah because phonetics and phonology need a large space erm
S0463	oh you mean you're not move your office you're just lecture
S0456	no no but yeah
S0463	educa's the the old wooden build isn't it
S0456	the old build the one that's
S0463	the the school
S0456	yeah
S0463	yeah how about the school kid be be they stay there or
S0456	it's not the school it be a university build so inside
S0463	i know but they but they have don't they have the equivalent of a cr√®che though
S0456	yeah that will stay i think it's just the build itself
S0463	that will stay in there yeah
S0456	so but it's it's it's extremely clever and they say well somebody point out that obviously the rent will go up because now there be a demand to be there plus they have to now extra pay extra you know because they can dictate the rent if it would be like that if it would be the open market because educa build have the kinds of room that the university need it's it's it's mental and it's just because of account
S0463	yeah
S0456	just to create a market when there be no real market
S0463	i be think you know if i be ever to have kind of access to power one of the one of the more mundane things i would do very quickly would be to sweep away the amount of count and cod that you have in erm for example local authorities and house associations
S0456	public yes
S0463	the amount of work that go into that
S0456	yeah
S0463	you know unnecessary work most of the time
S0456	and it be unnecessary mean it have to be do because you have to have compliance
S0463	oh yeah
S0456	so you have to pay people and that come out of your budget
S0463	yeah and then you have to pay auditors to audit it erm
S0456	mm so it's it's it's free for them because they cannot not work for you erm
S0463	mm just it's it's a complete waste of time
S0456	and as i say this be this be push money from leave to right
S0463	yeah
S0456	large budget and you know there's there's no point
S0463	i've do it professionally i know how it work you know i've work in finance erm
S0456	yeah if you if you would say that build be underused because you know partly that happen in biology their build be far too large there's just not enough people who want to do it erm and you cannot make more use out of it within the university you should see whether there be not a way of lease out part of it as office space you know or whatever erm the thing be here you have to what who would be a taker
S0463	mm mm
S0456	it's it's it's it's pointless
S0463	i just think the whole thing suck
S0456	yeah yeah
S0463	again it's just a waste these things nearly always end up cost more than they say it's not actually about the bottom line in that sense it's about discipline university staff and public sector staff into the behaviours of the market
S0456	yeah
S0463	it's npa it's new public management all over
S0456	do you see the i think it be in the guardian last week er this guy vote that er a good friend of his always vote labour and nothing but be a nurse and she say it's not so bad i can't stand it and i will go and take my expertise which be clearly not value into the private sector
S0463	yeah yeah yeah
S0456	and a lot of my colleagues think the same and yet the thing be that we accommodate ourselves so we're all thatcherites now
S0463	i know
S0456	it's exactly what you say yeah it's the the think
S0463	yeah it's what right to buy be all about and the sell the share
S0456	have have go more than skin deep
S0463	oh yeah it be a very successful project
S0456	mm yeah
S0463	right to buy be all about that and privatisation be about that creation create a nation of shareholders so that everyone have everyone have erm
S0456	an interest in capitalism
S0463	yes but what be the expression i be look for something in the game everyone have some i can't remember the expression
S0456	a foothold
S0463	no
S0456	no
S0463	but yeah
S0456	well everybody have something to lose
S0463	yes
S0456	share can go down as well as up
S0463	yes well they do but also no one have those share any more remember
S0456	well apart from a couple of workers
S0463	sorry
S0456	apart of a couple of workers who still have their vg share
S0463	ah some yeah yeah yeah
S0456	but you know it's
S0463	but they're you know most of the people sell them off instantly well you know this be exactly what happen in russia
S0456	yeah well not just russia yeah be be it the czech republic that they have coupons
S0463	mm
S0456	this be this be one five millionth of however many czech there be of the nation as well
S0463	i i i think you know one of the great there be a very good piece by erm owen
S0456	mm jam
S0463	yes er his honest appraisal of what he think corbyn could achieve and should try to achieve i don't know if you saw it
S0456	i think i only saw the headline
S0463	it be it be a good piece erm you know quite realistic
S0456	mm
S0463	erm and one of the things i think be miss from it i know i've kind of comment on it be about frame now clearly
S0456	frame
S0463	frame narratives
S0456	oh yeah
S0463	yeah
S0456	well which be the the thing that be so sadly miss in the last election
S0463	yes and i think it be a very very powerful frame narrative
S0456	yeah
S0463	they labour use now particular leave labour which be frame the economic crises of two thousand and nine er back to seventy nine sorry and erm the jam meek narrative exactly
S0456	here we go
S0463	yes exactly
S0456	see you've be prim by see the book in front of you
S0463	no i i didn't see it actually but yeah and the angle you be tell me leave patriotism and the angle would be that the right be unpatriotic
S0456	which be true i mean
S0463	well i know it be but no one
S0456	yeah
S0463	it's a classic orwellian argument
S0456	and with the it's just cameron keep say it's like
S0463	yeah it's a classic orwell argument you know the leave have to reclaim patriotism but i don't think it have to reclaim it in this crappy blue labour way it can actually reclaim from a much more self assure and confident perspective which be to do with the fact that this nation once have things we have be strip
S0456	mm yeah well i think new labour do that didn't they the the whole thing of get the union jack and rip it out of the hand of bnf and bnp
S0463	yeah they do that
S0456	erm even though it be sort of a very muscular form of it it wasn't the nationalism and you could see that you know that it try to push the
S0463	they make it safe
S0456	yeah the inclusively inclusive notion of it yeah if you're british doesn't matter whether you're white asian background black gay erm you know the whole thing that even up to the may of ninety seven be those things that be taboo or bad new labour come in and shift really really dramatically really really quickly
S0463	well they go from there ain't no black in the union jack all the way to cool britannia
S0456	yeah
S0463	didn't they but erm and interestingly you probably know this but apparently the largest proportion of people who designate themselves british be immigrants
S0456	be
S0463	immigrants
S0456	yeah
S0463	erm because english people think of themselves as english erm scottish as scottish obviously but er
S0456	yeah my neighbour i'm not british i'm english
S0463	yeah exactly or i'm scouse
S0456	yeah no even more so yeah
S0463	but er it's it's people of erm particularly sort of erm afro caribbean people or asian british people who be say that we're british so i think that be a a mark of the success of the project that you're talk about yeah
S0456	yeah yeah and people have take it on and the people who come as refugees when they be still allow to be call refugees
S0463	good piece by john harris
S0456	yeah john harris erm it's interest as well because i you know headline and like hang on he doesn't talk about them until the very last paragraph
S0463	yeah
S0456	erm you know and it's true i mean i remember
S0463	i remember blunkett tie himself up in knot don't you
S0456	yeah oh yeah it be scary but i didn't remember michael howard's campaign and i think i'm scar cos i'm not british enough
S0463	to be honest with you erm er the partner of my friend in london and she's she's very nervous now about erm the referendum
S0456	what the eu thing
S0463	yeah
S0456	yeah it's well do you see the the the guardian do all these you know this be the guardian and ding ding but erm yeah that crowd project so they put something out and then of course yes you can just collect photos or whatever but sometimes it be a survey et cetera and eventually there might be a piece of interest or not but erm when it be first voice and i think that might have be directly after the election could have be still before that erm they ask for people erm people's responses whether people get second citizenship et cetera et cetera so people come from outside or people who have a british passport and say well because of our our live within the eu we'll try and see a a non british eu passport so we can carry on erm so far there have be no piece but they they clearly collect stories on that so
S0463	have you any sense of how that vote will go
S0456	i mean it be there be never a question for such a long time it be a bite like i don't know but you know the it the majority wouldn't vote against that but because why would you have a referendum and it it's have a referendum be usually that politics have fail erm if it's not part of your constitution anyway
S0463	they've get to mobilise the london vote haven't they cos london be so disproportionately large
S0456	yeah plus of course
S0463	and for the business people with an interest in be in europe
S0456	all all the eu citizens that live in london
S0463	yeah
S0456	well will they have a vote though
S0463	probably not
S0456	let's hope they're marry to people with british passports then you you have to go from reactionary type of things just to i mean it's ridiculous because i remember one of those things be er
S0463	it doesn't feel real do it
S0456	yeah think eu i mean what would have happen er liverpool be on the list of you know hang out to dry and it be eu money and the eu insist on give it to merseyside
S0463	they give load to knowsley didn't they
S0456	not to london
S0463	to knowsley i remember they have load cos knowsley be the poorest borough in the country i think
S0456	yeah
S0463	at the time
S0456	yeah well and all the infrastructure project you know mersey railway just you know
S0463	yeah
S0456	the dutch come in and basically it be give to them i mean the only thing that wasn't er do up be the actual fleet of train but you have brand new station that the whole erm infrastructure around it all do with eu money
S0463	when be the build
S0456	merseyrail
S0463	in the seventies
S0456	no no no in in the eighties and nineties
S0463	what's i'm i'm i'm lose
S0456	well the things like brunswick station erm
S0463	right more things
S0456	birkenhead park conway conway whatever station em er in birkenhead
S0463	right
S0456	erm all that be eu fund
S0463	okay
S0456	erm and do the station up apart from the main station in liverpool that be only do now
S0463	yeah
S0456	erm and
S0463	with a new big station aren't they
S0456	yeah
S0463	yeah it's it's yeah i guess i've never take the train to the wirral i've only ever drive so
S0456	yeah so yeah but yeah that's that's one of the many many instance of eu money that come into merseyside
S0463	yeah well i guess the the city of culture business be eu money wasn't it
S0456	yeah mm yeah yeah plus of course say that because that just say oh no we want the money and then we distribute it and eu say no because if you get the money they'll never see a penny of it
S0463	no
S0456	erm
S0463	party before country
S0456	mm ah shock but yeah it just make you angry but erm
S0463	you need to back jeremy mate
S0456	well the isn't all it's it's it's if if vote for a leader of the opposition would change things i'm sure other people would have do that
S0463	hey
S0456	well if if have have the right leader of the opposition would have do the trick erm i'm sure other people would have try that before
S0463	like what
S0456	well get a leader of the opposition that be just the perfect fit and that change it all i'm not convince but you know it's it's my party whoever will be the leader and that's that's that's not the difference i mean if it would be liz truss no not liz truss the liz truss that isn't liz truss liz kendall that might might be tricky but
S0463	what do your instinct tell you
S0456	oh i can't
S0463	rather than your intellect what do your instinct tell you
S0456	well who be go to win for a start no as do
S0463	no not intellect
S0456	yeah i know
S0463	if you be talk simply about
S0456	my main well that tell me that none of the four be who i would have vote for or select full stop
S0463	why
S0456	well none seem to be of the right calibre and it be it be the whole procedure be too long and start too early and all it seem to do be just give the tories yet another free run as they have in twenty ten erm
S0463	yeah
S0456	and of course have have one that go on for nearly a year be just ridiculous
S0463	yeah
S0456	yeah it's it's clear you should have hustings and then vote but you know why would it take longer than an election campaign
S0463	be you unsympathetic towards corbyn's policies
S0456	i don't know enough of his policies no i mean it's the i can't i can't put myself in the role because who i be as i say i'm just a single member whoever become the leader or whoever i would want to become the leader that's neither here nor there whatever happen after whatever happen between september
S0463	mm twelfth i think
S0456	twelfth so next week and twenty twenty or ideally before that but god know that's not go to happen within a fix term parliaments unless they all die erm that be the important bite and of course what you would want to see be you know you have the contenders so they be obviously people who have a drive to do something you want them integrate erm cos they all will have something to offer erm and that's the thing yeah what what do i know about corbyn very little from himself because everybody be tell you what corbyn do or who he's meet or his what his policies be
S0463	i know i use to work with him
S0463	i do
S0456	well okay
S0463	erm because i use to have to respond to him er in write and at meet when he be stand for council
S0456	yeah
S0463	erm and you know he be a pain in the arse and it but it a good way erm cos he
S0456	he be insistent
S0463	he be insistent and he be very erm good at represent his constituents do his job
S0456	mm yeah
S0463	erm but he's i mean i meet him a couple of weeks ago over in and he be just dismiss it as a trot because of his cap
S0456	yeah well this be this be what i find so funny he's like er i keep say people people will probably think i'm i'm a corbynite now because i have the same cap i wear it before it be fashionable and i'm not go to stop it i would stop it if cameron would wear it
S0463	yeah there's never be a trot you know he's he's
S0456	yeah but trot be just dismissive of anything that isn't what he want
S0463	i know but he's just old labour
S0456	yeah
S0463	he's he's he's good labour he's he's there's nothing extreme about him
S0456	yeah well as the young people say yeah you think corbyn be be extreme it's like or radical it's like well you cannot really have be around for that long and be the radical radical you have to be a very british kind of radical
S0463	he's your perfect erm orwellian kind of and i mean not in nineteen eighty four
S0456	no
S0463	but i mean the lion and lion and the unicorn
S0456	yeah
S0463	perfect mild mannered erm british revolutionary
S0456	yeah
S0463	you know he's all you want
S0456	he drink his tea
S0463	yeah and who sit at the feet of for many years
S0456	yeah
S0463	you know these be good hearted people you know they're not bloody extremists
S0456	do you think do you think the the whole fast lane thing as they say that be er that be osborne's attempt to have an early flick at corbyn to say look there's traitor i mean how many people really do think that we do need trident in order to defend the realm of the kingdom
S0463	i don't know i don't know in the eighties it be a really big deal and
S0456	yeah but then communism be still
S0463	it be the cold war be still there
S0456	yeah yeah no
S0463	well it be definitely a vote loser for labour and that be the
S0456	no but i mean
S0463	well i think the interest thing be the scottish people clearly don't don't want it
S0456	yes
S0463	of course erm so that in itself be interest
S0456	mm
S0463	no it's i think we're on the real real cusp and i can't the optimistic side of me say this grassroots movement which be what it be in support of corbyn be the first real sign of the social media age in british parliamentary politics maybe snp be as well actually when the broadsheet and the tabloid media be become less influential
S0456	mm which you will want give what they be like
S0463	yeah
