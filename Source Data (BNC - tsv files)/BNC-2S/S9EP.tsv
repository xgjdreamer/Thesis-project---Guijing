S0281	i think so or she might be might just work in the office i don't know
S0355	amaze
S0281	but you'd think they'd reply i know she only come back from holiday last week but after a week you know
S0355	well some things never get expunge and that's it
S0281	well okay but at least they have the would have the decency to reply
S0355	decency yeah well if they be decent people they wouldn't become policemen would they
S0355	let's be honest there's more corruption and
S0281	well use to work in er work er in the police i mean she wasn't a policewoman
S0355	no
S0281	but she she work for them you know erm and i say have you have you still get any contact and she say well i have but i don't know if you know but i'll sort of send him an email and find out and it's funny that just er as we be finish our conversation and we be just about to go and just about say goodbyes my phone ring and it be so i erm i'd finish talk with and quickly say you know and bye bye er you know and nice to see you blah blah blah and and then i have to continue the conversation with and er

S0355	well good luck
S0281	well thank you very much
S0355	you're welcome
S0281	yeah so phone be that you know i be ask about it and she mention that the money be a bite tight and i say well doesn't she get the pension i say cos when we get divorce er when i go down there we go to this er pension office because when when you're self employ in france you have to pay erm
S0355	a stamp
S0281	well yes the equivalent of a stamp and erm er well like national insurance er for a pension but it's er erm and you have to all all the obligatory things that you have to pay er and it's all tie to your declare turnover
S0355	right
S0281	so when i be last saw her when i be last in when i go down there for the divorce erm we go together to this er place and i sign over my right to the pension for her
S0355	right
S0281	because i mean i think it's the least i could do see that it be my fault that you know she's in the situation she be alone and as and i be earn good money you know at university and i think well that's the least i could do and really surprise me when she say she hasn't receive a penny or rather a euro
S0355	so how old be
S0281	well she must be about er what be it nineteen fifty two she's or fifty four it be fifty four and she'll be sixty now won't she
S0355	so when do women in france get their pension
S0281	i don't know i don't know i'd and i say well that's crazy because you know she should have be receive quite good money because of all the years the eighteen years that we pay into this
S0355	yeah but if you haven't er
S0281	well i haven't
S0355	reach retirement age there she won't get anything surely
S0281	but women always retire earlier don't they i mean what be it sixty be it sixty
S0355	yeah but here it's go up
S0281	be it sixty
S0355	it may have go up there
S0281	well maybe maybe but er i might and that's that's what i want to talk to her about you know to find out why she hasn't receive this and what what she's have do or hasn't do to try and get it erm but she's too tire so i'll i'll phone them tomorrow afternoon but er i might have to go down there er which will be a nice excuse to go to to go to you know cos i can get cheap
S0281	well i can get cheap flight now erm i'm on 's erm list you know for erm you know if you work for i've start do it now have you notice say you know you know er she have be work for for over twenty years and they have they're allow to nominate two people for erm concessions they have a concession
S0355	yes
S0281	and you get standby flight and you get them really cheaply like when i come back from china
S0355	yes
S0281	sixty quid
S0355	yes
S0281	it cost me more to pay for my second bag
S0355	yes
S0281	than it do for the flight back
S0355	yes
S0281	so i i can
S0355	unbelievable
S0281	i know isn't it but erm i i could so i could get a cheap flight down there and try and sort out this business about pension so that's what i be just try to phone her about but er so afterwards so after we finish chat er i go to to find out where this language school be so i i know where it would be for my appointment at half past three
S0355	yes
S0281	and it be i i go through the arcade and when you get the outside the other er the the other end of the arcade right in front of me this huge poster language school and i think okay right so then i come back here and get change and go down there er for an interview a very friendly do
S0355	yes
S0281	erm lovely lady and er she's only be do the job for a few weeks
S0355	yes
S0281	and cos i've do that job twice you know before director of study and er she be er she be the one it be quite a small school but erm er she be all they do ielts preparation down there and of course that's my speciality you know and er she say well now i've get the dos's job responsibilities i i've have to er handover teach ielts to somebody else and she say you would be perfect for that you know so erm we speak for oh it must have be about forty minutes
S0355	mm
S0281	and basically er it's to start with and i i didn't really expect any more actually but er they they don't know from one week to another how many students they've get and she say she say i think i'm she do it on thursday her schedule for the follow week and she say be that alright and if i just phone you up and say well can you do this or can you do that and i say yeah i say er because it would be good to get back into the swing of teach again you know cos er i haven't teach for a few months and er to do something positive the the pay be pretty low but just to to get back into it would be good and obviously you know to to get out and meet people you know as well as you know teach so unusual afternoon really
S0355	mm
S0281	and er quite positive in some ways yeah so er you have a nice relax afternoon didn't you
S0355	yeah i suppose so
S0281	you mean you mean you didn't
S0355	it's very tire
S0281	oh i know you be absolutely exhaust it must be accumulation that's be build up for some time and it's not just er from one day to the next there's a there's a
S0355	possibly i don't know
S0281	i'm sure no i'm sure i mention to you last night you know and you seem really wind up like a spring you know all tension there but you see
S0355	be i
S0281	yeah lately and you seem much more relax today
S0355	well it's probably diet that's what it be
S0281	do you reckon
S0355	yeah yeah sure yeah diet with with erm with er diabetics
S0281	well you only you only start it today will it take effect already
S0355	well look how quickly a drink take effect but it's it's just stuff you put in your body isn't it
S0281	or don't
S0355	what
S0281	or don't put in your body
S0355	or don't er put in your body that's it isn't it i mean
S0281	yeah
S0355	camomile tea be a good idea
S0281	here's here's to your your diet
S0355	oh yes cheer
S0281	cheer
S0355	ah
S0281	i think you're a very brave chap do all three things that be more or less at the same time give up smoke give up drink more i'll drink to that well to to all intents and purpose
S0355	yes thank you
S0281	and erm and now your your diet but you're it's it's it's not only wise i mean it's more than wise it's absolutely necessary isn't it especially the diet
S0355	but i think one of the biggest things be stop smoke
S0281	be it
S0355	and the next one be diet and the next one be drink
S0281	well
S0355	those be the order i'm i'm put it in difficulty for me
S0281	yeah you're you're into your third week now of give up smoke
S0355	i quite like smoke
S0281	yeah i know but you haven't make a big deal of it
S0355	and it do choke me up and it make me feel depress and it make me get stomach give me erm indigestion and there's lot of things that smoke do that i really don't like
S0281	mm mm
S0355	so but it's the thing that i do enjoy smoke
S0281	mm
S0355	but erm
S0281	but you you don't
S0355	but then again i don't and there's too many things that i when i smoke it depress me it's depress
S0281	yeah you you don't usually do things in half measure do you you whatever you do you usually put everything into it and that include the vices as well as work and and and
S0355	yes you could say that
S0281	virtues and everything really be er
S0355	yeah
S0281	so you're not you weren't a chain smoker but sometimes not far off
S0355	that's true
S0281	it be it be just one after another wasn't it
S0355	it's true
S0281	i mean look when i bring that carton back for you
S0355	oh that's fatal but i'd be the same with a box of chocolates or a bottle of wine or
S0281	i start so i'll finish i i i feel i feel the same often with a bottle of wine
S0355	it's call dipsomania
S0281	here's to intemperance oh no my glass be nearly empty
S0355	oh
S0281	well i like to er do you want some more
S0355	yeah go on twist my arm ah
S0281	i like to you know a stress free day not have to get up early you know the alarm i use to hate that so wake up when your body tell you you've have enough sleep
S0355	who this be your perfect morning
S0281	well it's my ideal type of day
S0355	right
S0281	and i get up when i don't need any more sleep
S0355	yes
S0281	and then do something useful er if i can for most of the day i mean like today i be meet somebody job interview come back do my cv you know
S0355	yes
S0281	and i've only just stop now right so now i feel like well it's the end of the day i deserve a drink yeah so it's er but i feel that to have a a reasonably a reasonable day i need to have a combination of work effort anyway and erm some kind of reward at the end of it to relax do you feel the same do you feel you need to do something usually
S0355	mm erm no i think it's a dangerous thing really to think like that i think i believe that to because then you're dependent it create a dependency
S0281	well it doesn't have to i mean it's that's it's not it's only lately that er
S0355	i'm say no you ask me a question
S0281	yeah
S0355	you think about it
S0281	yeah okay
S0355	but it be your you'd earnt it or that you know or what what be the phrase you use not that you'd earnt it you deserve it or
S0281	yeah something like that
S0355	so erm i have to look at stuff like that because i basically be an alcoholic
S0281	really
S0355	and i have to and because i have er trouble with my liver and i've be warn that if i drink it would kill me if i go back to drink because i'm quite on the edge of drink and i still drink a bite but erm and that drink have cause my diabetes the fatty liver have cause my diabetes as well erm and i'm well aware of sort of the internal voice that make excuse for myself and allow me to do things that aren't good for me
S0281	mm
S0355	i'd much rather say oh well fuck it you know i i know this be go to kill me i know it's not good for me but i'm gonna have it anyway
S0281	yeah
S0355	and rather than to
S0355	kick myself and say well i've earn this i justify this i don't you know i have to say this make me this be this take away some of my pain or the pain of life and er but and you know it's bullshit continually we fool ourselves there's something in us that keep us fool ourselves and i'm well aware that that there's plenty within me that need to be address as it be and need need to be work on and yeah and that's fine i do it in my own way i think i do it in the quiet of my room think
S0281	you'll go blind
S0355	well i'm just go to do it until i need glass
S0281	be that why you've get so many pair
S0355	absolutely
S0281	i've never know anybody with so many glass as you've get they're everywhere of all shape and size
S0355	i know
S0281	and colour
S0355	i know well my glass
S0281	how have you ever count them up
S0355	no well basically i use two strengths of glass i use one point oh i use i think one point fives for work and if i need to look at something really close up in detail i need two point fives and then i have different eye glass and hand glass to to erm magnify glass to see what i'm do at different level if i need to really look at something really intricately erm so all my glass be in double i've get a white pair of one point fives and a white pair of two point fives and because i buy them at the pound shop
S0281	ah
S0355	they only cost me a pound a pair and
S0281	really
S0355	i so i use them also as fashion fashionable
S0281	fashion statements
S0355	i like them fashion statements so i've get white ones i've get erm all different type of ones in both size then i've get the ones like like i'm hold in my hand these big al like ones that someone have that work for me but er they have them at a dinner party and say er i like your glass i'll swap you mine for yours and okay and and i've also get another pair of glass that i buy for a pound or two pound and they're specsaver glass and probably cost a hundred quid from the market for two quid that er be in my strength but what happen be with my type of work that i do i scratch damage break or lose quite a considerable amount of glass
S0281	mm
S0355	and so the amount of glass i'm probably look at monetarily in term probably if i say fifteen pound it would probably be too much and probably probably you're look at about ten pound so it's ten pound twelve quid
S0281	i wouldn't have think you'd have get through all that many pair pair of glass be a male escort
S0355	well it depend on what you're do
S0355	it depend what you're do you know i i don't have eye in the back of my head but it
S0281	so then you'd wear two pair of glass
S0355	if that's what you're think yeah so that that's it really
S0281	i'm gonna go to tomorrow to see about
S0355	have you
S0281	erm
S0281	to see about this er charity thing
S0355	yes
S0281	charity shop business

S0281	well the
S0355	interest
S0281	the little i've find out about this so far be that there's normally a manager or manageress get pay
S0355	oh yeah
S0281	and the rest be volunteer
S0355	right well the managers be pay quite well i believe
S0281	be they
S0355	so i believe
S0281	it's funny that cos i i go to the other one erm
S0355	oh yeah
S0281	and i haven't hear anything from them
S0355	yeah well that's strange isn't it
S0281	yeah

S0281	pain
S0355	so what be you go to do with your life
S0281	well i could define that try and get a job and somehow look after you know what they say trust to the universe to sort everything out well that's what i'm do at the moment i'm i'm try to be positive and and not let the situation get me down and i think i'm get better say today she say oh you sound very good today she say compare to you know what i be before
S0355	right

S0355	yeah
S0281	and erm it's and it say glockenspiel da da da down down down da da da la down down down and i think what instrument be that do you it's really interest about the way he explain it why why cos it's so repetitive at least side one be and do you know why it be although it's so repetitive that it still grab our attention it hold our attention apparently so i be listen to it last night as he explain that he write it that the there be seven note to the bar follow by eight note and then seven and then eight da da la down down down down seven da da la down down down down down down down eight and and that's why he write it like that so that it's it be repetitive there's there's this theme run through it on side one that er everything flow a crescendo sometimes
S0355	yeah
S0281	which be great and er but there's some other musician who apparently perform the work in two thousand and eleven erm explain it that erm it's it be repetitive but it take us in different ways and different place but in the end like any good work of art erm music bring us back and therefore encapsulate the whole thing in a
S0355	it's like a trip
S0281	in a way yes it's a musical trip

S0355	yeah
S0281	where they record the album and they say they think it be a great idea i mean revolutionary i mean
S0355	yeah
S0281	the idea that one album both side can comprise of of one single track never be do before and they say go for it and richard branson be say that er he think it be a great idea but at that time the cash flow wasn't great and they be just struggle to survive and he say
S0355	who virgin record be
S0281	yeah yeah and that er they but they think it be such a an innovative concept and great potential although musically speak i mean branson's favourite song apparently be er i'm a batchelor boy by cliff richards you know so that
S0355	jesus christ
S0281	that that be yeah i know so he have no idea er about the the quality of the music but he realise and be tell of its potential and he say well yeah go ahead and they say well what do you need and then mike oldfield write down a whole long list of all these different instrument that he need include the glockenspiel and all the rest of it
S0355	oh yes
S0281	and he play every instrument on the album himself
S0355	do he
