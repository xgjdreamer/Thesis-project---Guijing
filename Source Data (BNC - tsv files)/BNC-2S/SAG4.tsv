S0448	my pgce
S0447	p yeah
S0448	say yeah
S0447	okay tell him he can have it
S0448	erm yeah pgce erm what be i gonna say yeah i've be look a little bite erm basically what i'm gonna do be take a year out like when i graduate
S0447	yeah
S0448	erm use that time to get the experience that you need cos you do i tell you have i tell you already i can't remember if it be you i be talk to erm that i have to get so many weeks work experience in a school before i can apply
S0447	yeah
S0448	yeah so i'm gonna use that year out to erm hang on erm they're message me about the whisky
S0447	okay
S0448	erm what be i say
S0447	talk about have a year out
S0448	oh yeah so i'll take a year out use that time to get the experience in the school that i need and then obviously like work as well erm
S0447	yeah
S0448	i'm hop to be able to get a job like as either a classroom assistant or a nursery assistant sort of thing cos even though that's not great money like they're the kind of roles that give me experience whilst pay me and you don't have to like cos you obviously you can't go be like a teach assistant until you've do a train course but you can be a nursery assistant cos they're not teachers
S0447	yeah
S0448	do you know what i mean so i might try and get a job like that and then i be think maybe try and like carry on with my tutor erm
S0447	yeah
S0448	just so that i've get load of experience work with kid and then at some point i wanna i dunno cos obviously this all depend on how much money i've earnt but i wanna go somewhere like i know i haven't get the job but i still wanna travel even if it's not to america i wanna go somewhere before i start work for good do you know what i mean
S0447	oh right
S0448	right yeah mm probably not for that long now but
S0447	yeah
S0448	cos i know a load of people be like talk about do interrailing and stuff and i dunno if i'd wanna do that cos that's like quite expensive for what it be like i've never be really the sort to like wanna backpack and shit cos it's all a bite dirty for me but
S0447	yeah
S0448	i just wanna do ah i just wanna do something even if it's just a holiday i wanna do something before i commit to a life of teach
S0447	yeah mm
S0448	and then yeah obviously i'll apply to start a pgce in the follow september and then er that take just under a year cos you finish in july erm
S0447	yeah
S0448	i've be look i've be look at i look i can't remember if i tell no i don't think it be you i be tell you this i look at and i decide to rule it out because you have to be interview to get in there and like interview at be always like suppose to be really random and i don't do very well in interview anyway so i think it's best to go for one where they don't interview me erm
S0447	right
S0448	so i've be look at and i'd rather go to just cos i don't really like that much i get a bite scar in so
S0447	yeah
S0448	yeah i mean the one like my mum say she know someone who's do a pgce at erm so it can't be that bad and i like the fact they do one cos you know you can do them like for either primary or secondary
S0447	yeah
S0448	erm like the one at you couldn't like pick which one you want to specialise in so i'd have have to do some secondary teach and i really don't wanna do that whereas the one at like i can pick to specifically do primary and early years and i like that one cos
S0448	i get to do the early years bite as well which be you know like the the er before school like you know like two three four year olds
S0447	yeah
S0448	erm so i like that cos i kinda the like the younger they be the more i prefer it like when i've do my work experience before i've do it in erm i've do work experience in reception year one year two and year five and i definitely prefer work with the little ones erm i'd rather work in a nursery than a school but nursery workers get pay less which be why i've gotta do primary school cos
S0447	yeah
S0448	even though er teach isn't exactly like gonna pay me that much anyway nursery work be literally like bottom of the barrel stuff so yeah
S0447	it doesn't pay that badly
S0448	it's not bad but it's just not great do you know what i mean
S0447	mm it's still probably like twenty five grand a year
S0448	yeah but that's not that much like consider how expensive everything be now it's not er
S0447	yeah
S0448	it's good but it's not enough to like live on comfortably and do everything i'd wanna do not that teach really will be either but i don't really have any other options so
S0447	mm fair enough what be you plan to do then
S0448	what do you mean
S0447	you say to live comfortably and plan and do what i wanna do
S0448	well just like you know like think long term i wanna have children but i don't really wanna be one of those people who do it when they can't afford to look after them
S0447	yeah
S0448	and i wanna be like my mum's always be really good at take us on holiday and there's only be like one year i think where she couldn't afford to do it and she make sure she take us every year i'd wanna be able to do that because then like i've be so many place i think it's important to keep that up all really bore stuff like just i'd wanna be able to just not have to worry about bill and yeah i dunno
S0447	well fair enough
S0447	well hopefully you won't hopefully it won't just be your money though that you have to live off
S0448	no i know it better not be but
S0447	yeah
S0448	but i don't wanna i'm never gonna be that sort of person and go oh it doesn't matter how much i'm earn because you're earn so and so amount cos that's not fair like get to be able to contribute and think about worse case scenarios if it do end up be me on my own
S0447	and my million pound a year and then you'll be he's earn to much
S0448	well i just wouldn't wanna live off it like i still wanna be able to contribute
S0447	that's fine then
S0448	i'm not a sponger
S0447	that's fine we'll split bill down the middle and i'll just keep
S0448	you can't i'm just gonna throw this out there if you become a millionaire and i'm still just a teacher we ain't split fifty fifty
S0447	what that's
S0448	i'm a frigging teacher you're a millionaire
S0447	you say that you want to er you want to
S0448	contribute contribute and i would contribute equally if we be on equal salaries but if we be talk you have literally make millions and i'm make like twenty grand a year that that's just unacceptable
S0447	we can contribute equally
S0448	cheeky shit
S0447	although more like fifty thousand pound a month income
S0448	yeah and my twenty grand a year
S0447	yeah no it will just go into save
S0447	i'll just spend it it's fine
S0448	no
S0447	cos next month i'll get another fifty grand
S0448	oh god
S0447	right you're gonna regret say split it
S0448	i didn't say split equally i just want you to know i'm not gonna like expect to live off your money however if you be to become a millionaire i would expect to not have to pay half and half it work both ways if i happen to make it big like not really sure how it's gonna happen at this rate then i wouldn't expect you to pay half and half
S0447	okay deal
S0448	okay
S0447	well see i think you're you're gonna end up better off in this deal
S0448	no
S0447	i'm i'm i'm destine to be a millionaire
S0448	well that's not my fault
S0447	it's weird
S0448	what's weird that i'm so shit compare to you
S0447	no you're not
S0447	i just know it's gonna happen
S0448	yeah
S0447	like who say it when he be young he he just know it be gonna happen and the guy who's the wolf of wall street be about
S0448	oh for god's sake you're obsess with bloody wolf of wall street

S0448	yeah we well when you come up we don't have to go out erm that much then cos yeah yeah
S0447	cos yeah yeah
S0448	i be just think in my head like i be try i be get confuse i be gonna say we don't have to go out that much that weekend when you're up and then i get confuse and think i be talk about halloween all of a sudden i be like oh no we'll definitely be go out i remember i be actually talk about the fourteenth of november which be a completely different time and i be like oh yeah we don't have to go out cos that's why we didn't make out till age last time cos we be both like sleep off last the night before
S0447	yeah but that time i'll have only travel up on the friday night
S0448	yeah
S0447	and then yeah so i guess we might be go out the friday night

S0447	maybe you should like drive it round the block
S0448	yeah well it's out it's nearly out of petrol like it's on like one and a half bar so i be think i could just take it to the petrol station and back again cos that's something to do but it's just the fact that essentially when i move i know i'm go to lose my spot so i keep put it off and be like i'll go another day
