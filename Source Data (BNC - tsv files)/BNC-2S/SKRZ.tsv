S0179	i do have to say be quite a nice place it's get character to it
S0058	it have get character to it i think you're right i think a lot of cities now especially the kind of newer ones be really faceless and not very yeah they don't have a character the people don't you know
S0179	like peterborough for example have have about as much character as my leave butt cheek which
S0058	yeah it's get quite a lot of character yeah
S0179	be quite distinctive but you know that's an entire city
S0058	yeah i guess 's a bite more sprawl it's get lot of different bits also there's some bits which don't have a very nice character em
S0179	well never have be to those bits
S0058	i be go to say yeah em i'll take you now to kind of one of the not very nice bits
S0179	can we hire a car to do it
S0058	yeah one of the it's obviously eh
S0179	that be cool though that eh that build
S0058	she be interest look be quite demonstrative with her arm as well
S0179	yeah
S0058	bless her frustrate traffic director
S0058	we could have go leave
S0179	i'm glad we didn't
S0058	me too
S0179	have you get your thing go
S0058	this
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	good
S0058	yeah it'll be nice actually
S0179	it's a little bite eh
S0058	's a fan
S0179	it's good we could have go to see again today but i think that would have be push it
S0058	yeah i think so yeah i'm sure we'll see him again soon
S0179	i love that the eh the eh have get a jacket tie on to a thing poke out say yeah that doesn't make it safe
S0058	yeah it's quite scary some people they just you know balance stuff on the back of the truck not too worry don't even fasten it down we'll be fine it won't fall off
S0179	mm
S0058	it's like when people em have like van doors at the back and they sort of have stuff stick out the back of them and at the end they sort of tie a bite of string to the end to them so you you know can see where they be but
S0179	em em
S0058	yeah win em britain in bloom a few years run this bite be always very nice when they have the competitions
S0179	for the greater good
S0058	the greater good basically yeah yeah it it be nice actually when they be do it cos they always have really lovely kind of flower in the town centre and stuff and you know they brighten things up a little bite which be not necessarily a bad thing it be quite bad though when the queen visit the hospital they i think they be open a new wing and the queen come to open up
S0179	yeah
S0058	and they and they plant load of em flower and lovely arrangements and plant and you know all kinds of stuff they make it look lovely outdoors and then the next day the dig them all up again and send them back which be quite bad
S0179	seriously
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	i think it would take more effort to
S0058	well maybe they didn't completely plant them maybe they just have them in pot and stuff but yeah they just pack them all up again and send them back so they just borrow them for the day
S0179	who wouldn't rent a garden
S0058	well yeah
S0179	when you're desperate rent a whippet
S0058	rent a whippet
S0179	yeah
S0058	who's go to rent a whippet
S0179	no to fit in
S0058	oh right yeah
S0179	with the class environ environ
S0058	environ yes ah love it
S0179	mm
S0058	be you go to get your flat cap
S0179	i'm consider it
S0058	cos it would be different sort of flat cap a flat cap and whippet combination
S0179	in what sense
S0058	well flat cap and whippet be you know very work class miner sort of thing whereas flat cap shoot jacket large gun crock over the arm
S0179	well actually it wasn't what i be go for
S0058	no fair enough
S0179	it be just
S0058	you just fancy a flat cap
S0179	yeah basically
S0058	i'm sure can find one at on me
S0179	i just remember my dad have one when i be grow up and it be
S0058	you think it be me
S0179	where's your dad's cap
S0058	he's get one now
S0179	no he doesn't wear it much
S0058	he do occasionally wear it
S0179	yeah but it's you know it's an adult's
S0058	yeah a manly hat
S0179	exactly as it wasn't a baseball cap
S0058	no
S0179	no that it wasn't
S0058	i think that's the difference between our father yours wear a flat cap mine wear a baseball cap
S0179	he doesn't do he
S0058	yeah sometimes
S0179	seriously
S0058	well yeah cos his head burn quite easily he's get a rather snazzy flat cap
S0179	yeah so do my dad's but that's why he wear a tilly hat
S0058	yes indeed my dad doesn't have one of those i will suggest it as a fashion option
S0179	oh
S0058	i don't think he'd like it
S0179	i use to want one remember my dad's bag full of hat
S0058	yeah what be that about we be pack up and there be some some argument about the fact that your mum hadn't include his bag full of hat em at which point she have a bite of a go about the fact that he be just leave stuff lie about the house and expect her to know exactly what he want take how be she mean to know he have to take a bag full of hat with him
S0179	then god we're not go on this holiday
S0058	yeah i be it be stressful just be in the kitchen with them seriously it be quite funny but i be just like oh my god let me go now
S0179	well that's a decent side road no wait not good with the other cars but it be still shut
S0058	yeah no i think that must have be night time raid work
S0179	yeah
S0058	i'm try to think eh what be i just think about yeah oh that's what it be yeah how many grams be in a kilogram be it
S0179	a thousand
S0058	a thousand yeah that's be mad i just
S0179	cos otherwise it could be a centigram
S0058	yeah oh of course i be like a centigram be i go mad
S0179	or something to do with a hundred not a thousand
S0058	yeah
S0179	i'm glad we get that figure out
S0058	yeah that's good that's sort now i'm just think the way to the meet it be relevant to something
S0179	remind me to start carry around sunglasses okay
S0058	yeah just get a pair just to eh keep in here
S0179	well i've get two pair anyway so i might keep one in the car as a sort of emergency pair
S0058	yeah
S0179	or at least no i
S0058	in all fairness
S0179	well i will actually need to remember that i need to start take them with me
S0058	yeah yeah it's not a bad idea anyway cos i guess even in winter you can have bright sun
S0179	yeah mm see on it's weird cos the only time i use to see the sea be on holiday
S0058	right yeah so it's kind of a holiday feel i guess
S0179	yeah a weekend
S0058	no no it be nowadays i just mean for me it's not necessarily the same association because you know we use to have trip out to the beach but it wasn't quite so big a thing
S0179	yeah for me it's a it would be a long drive to get to get to a holiday location you know you're get close when you see the sea that's the
S0058	yeah it's a nice think when you're drive into somewhere you know really well and you've get to see the familiar place on the way and you know you're get close so like drive to you see the sort of you pass particular things and little pottery shop and you know all the sort of yeah landmarks
S0179	yeah well i'm hop that the a1 m junction should be pretty clearly signpost
S0058	i would imagine so
S0179	yeah
S0058	do you want me to have a look so you know where it be
S0179	no it's okay i just want to see where they
S0058	yeah i don't think they're go to let you miss that one
S0179	i hope not anyway
S0058	yeah
S0179	so em do you want to give a a bell and make some plan for him and tell him to bring 's stuff if he want to
S0058	yeah well i mean do we definitely want to go do you i'm just think in term of eat like whether there will actually be enough time for gym session three shower and then get the meat on and you know whether it will just be a bite late for to get back and for us to well it's up to you what do you think
S0179	i think i would like to get some today it's just kind of a fun way of and i'd like at least us to go
S0058	okay well i maybe cos
S0179	what
S0058	i'm try to think what em i can't remember what time the last bus be
S0179	well no it's it's about seven o'clock on a sunday but he's go to have to get a taxi anyway to get there
S0058	nn no no not go back but come to i don't think it's quite as late as seven em that's the thing i mean i be wonder if he'd kind of have to come if we be go to the gym because of the last bus time i'll ask him what time the last bus be
S0179	can you not
S0058	that's fine i'll ask him what time the last bus be he do ring me quite late last night that be quite odd
S0179	sorry
S0058	he ring quite late last night like quarter past eleven i don't know it just seem like an odd time to ring and he didn't get very much sleep em he get he say he get like two hours sleep the previous day i wasn't really listen i be em i have some but he say something about em you know it's be this weekend thing em and he hadn't have much sleep the previous night and em someone one of his housemate's call i presume it's a sort of different area of the country
S0179	i like housemates i would actually housemates
S0058	yeah yeah exactly
S0179	i didn't think of that
S0058	oh right yeah em i'm sure he say something else i can't remember why he get up so early it's like yesterday morning
S0179	well what be the about anyway
S0058	i think it's just sort of part of their idea of em kind of make you feel part of a company make you feel like a kind of community and i think they like also to link up the different offices so there's like there's a few people stick up in aberdeen but obviously you don't have that much contact so then they like to make them feel past of the group i think
S0179	humungous waste of time and fund
S0058	mm i mean they obviously feel it have enough beneficial effect to make it worth it but it do seem
S0179	barely
S0058	yeah it just seem like a kind of slightly odd yeah use of eh
S0179	interest choice of phrase tangible benefit
S0058	yeah exactly it's so hard to measure the fact whether you'll get any fun out of this em so be basically say yes it's kind of less important for the people in but you know it's worthwhile i'm not really sure whether it be sort of team build or whether it be more kind of talk or you know more kind of em
S0058	yeah but if he enjoy it that's all that matter
S0179	yeah it's a good situation to be in
S0058	yeah so em yeah it be something he's do be he do anything next weekend i can't remember i'm sure there be something he be do on saturday
S0179	em no i don't think so i mean i think it be completely clear
S0058	oh right okay sound quite that's better for him then
S0179	yeah yeah that's what he be say
S0058	cool
S0179	it should be quite a nice weekend
S0058	yeah it'll be nice actually i'm really look forward to it
S0179	that's a problem watch him come back and say no i can't anymore
S0058	if we stop at be it go to go be it
S0179	sorry
S0058	or so that alright yeah when you think we'll have a look at the map and see em about that walk and see if there's an alternative route back what do you think
S0179	an os map if we can so i might ask dan if he's get one i don't think we've get one
S0058	oh yeah yeah and just see if there's sort of see if you can make it into a circular one if not i mean you can just turn around and yeah the view would be different so there'll be a lot of tunnel
S0179	where do it go not sure em ah ha good place to go for a walk
S0058	yeah how random
S0179	why be there a footpath
S0058	well you know fair enough you might really like walk by the side of the a19
S0179	who lose it there
S0058	yes they do the walk be over cos you're not actually allow to walk by the side of that be you
S0179	eh yeah you be on the dual carriageway
S0058	alright just if there's no wind
S0179	unless it's a specifically restrict dual carriageway which this might be i don't know i don't think so
S0058	be that when they have those big sign no pedestrians no horse draw carriages
S0179	yeah exactly
S0058	yeah
S0179	yes if go back to space you might collect wait a second oh dear
S0058	ah silly car
S0179	leave that aside it's actually very pleasant drive
S0058	mm
S0179	it's a very interest road
S0058	yeah that be good idea it's nice to have sort of different options
S0179	oh wind turbine l
S0058	ah that's a nice view actually kind of the straight road and then the wind turbine i think be impress by our wind turbine project
S0179	how the hell do that come up
S0058	i can't remember i think it be something about loan everyone
S0179	oh yes
S0058	that be quite a bizarre night but quite fun
S0179	totally bizarre yeah
S0058	how cool be 's job it sound mental
S0179	it sound pretty awful
S0058	it's sound awful yeah i'm sure it be awful one kind of yeah on a work life balance basis but it's very cool i guess what she lose in term of yeah her own life she get back in term of go to film premier and it's just very glamorous i guess to me who's you know publish sound quite glamorous my job's not very glamorous whereas that really be good
S0179	my job be inadvertently quite glamorous
S0058	yeah exactly yeah i want to see that film now
S0179	which film
S0058	snow white and the huntsman
S0179	it have a cool trailer
S0058	yeah it do actually yeah in find out the well kind of find out the solution to sherlock i'm not sure we really do
S0179	no i'm not
S0058	she didn't seem massively sure we do need to watch it back though with that in mind but no it's em i love how every time you mention someone it's like oh yeah work for us be his agents you know oh yeah i've do that film oh but the hobbit that's a pretty cool thing to get accredit on cos howard shore and em
S0179	it look shit
S0058	well yeah but she do say that the trailer be the funniest thing ever and she only do the music i mean she's not responsible for the act or the dialogue or the film or anything like that just you know so long as the mix of the score be good
S0179	mm
S0058	the supervision of music
S0179	in fairness though it em i get on much better with her than i be expect to
S0058	yeah yeah i mean it be what the way i kind of felt about it be we both have different trump card so she have this really cool amaze life do all the film but we be talk about which be which be a kind of another really good thing i mean do you know what i mean we both have real things no but it be really nice i say my parent be say you know do you enjoy sort of catch up with your cousin i say yeah cos we haven't actually really spend any time together since we be children you know we don't really know each other as adults because we we're generally just with our parent in a big holiday group and we've never kind of hang out em but no it be it be good it be good fun she's nice she be a really nice person very confident and outgo and loud
S0179	not particularly
S0058	no she's very confident which be nice
S0179	not particularly
S0058	don't you think
S0179	it wasn't my overwhelm impression
S0058	fair enough
S0179	em
S0058	but yeah em it be funny this morning we be like i didn't realise she have such a deep kind of throaty laugh and i be like don't mention the fag oh i do have an image of her accidentally leave them on the on the table and eh my parent be like be these yours
S0179	your parent would actually ask you that question
S0058	no no no they wouldn't but i be a bite like
S0179	no as in your parent would ever be in any doubt whether you might
S0058	well yeah i don't think they would be i think they would like hey be these 's em so just texted back em latest he can arrive on the bus be about six thirty
S0179	well do you want to hang on do we say we'd meet him
S0058	yeah but okay i can text him
S0179	and just sort of tell him to bring some wine
S0058	okay
S0179	well actually tell him that bring some wine and to be really nice em and
S0058	he's also say em i'm think i should probably stay until latest tenish that should be doable
S0179	okay
S0058	probably want an early night
S0179	eh yeah and em about that and the gym see if he want to
S0058	cool cos that i mean yeah he could come earlier and come to the gym with us or if he come at half six we'll probably have be to the gym anyway so we will that could fit in fine i think
S0179	yeah well see if he want to come along
S0058	okay cool
S0179	i'm also possibly think be one of
S0058	yeah no definitely hello hello sorry i didn't catch you there be it be it can you hear me cool hello i'm just yes i do just get your text em yeah so em we're on our way back we do sort of we set off em you know kind of not so early so em couple of options yeah em either we be think about go to the gym and have a play with they've get these like em you know like the pad that you sort of punch and kick and stuff
S0179	spar pad
S0058	spar pad apparently they're call we be think about go to have a play with them so if you want to join us that's fine so kind of come earlier bring gym kit or you can come through em after and you know kind of and you know come through later on okay in that case eh yeah we try to get a badminton court but there's some kind of children's party on we try to get a badminton court but there's some kind of children's party on terrible em okay well in that case half past six be probably a good time cool yeah sound about right yeah em cool and em another thing we em we bring the food but we didn't em get any wine em be there any chance you fancy bring a bottle of wine cool that sound good eh red it's beef so i think red would go nicely that sound good awesome cool eh well in that case we'll we'll sort of let you know kind of you know and let you change your but that sound good cool okay we'll see you later on then okay bye that sound really em yeah he say em these eh spar pad doesn't sound like his thing and he's not really very keen for that em which be fair enough so i say half six but we'll let him know if there's change of plan and he say he will bring some wine
S0179	alright incidentally could you possibly phrase it a little less diffidently as in its we've get food can you bring the wine
S0058	okay
S0179	or that's your contribution not would you mind awfully it's eh can you just do it
S0058	i didn't say would you mind awfully
S0179	no but that's why how it be phrase
S0058	okay i say do you want to the implication be bring some wine
S0179	yeah it be very hesitant
S0058	okay yeah em so that's good plan
S0179	this isn't best way of service the
S0058	it's not no
S0179	substantial improvements to the place
S0058	it's
S0179	ah yes
S0058	i think it be cool
S0179	again
S0058	okay that sound like a plan for the even then
S0179	yeah if he come over can we put some music on
S0058	any eh what do you feel like
S0179	i'm really not sure
S0058	what's a nice sort of sunny day
S0179	beach boys
S0058	beach boys
S0179	maybe some abba
S0058	abba that would fun let's try that
S0058	yeah we can try see how we get on
S0179	it's worth a try
S0058	and not dance queen
S0179	no
S0058	we should watch mamma mia that would be fun have it get to be comedy horror now
S0179	mm yeah i know that's one of the reason i always keep to the
S0058	yeah
S0179	as ever
S0058	yeah the em the kind of weirdly shape hill be call
S0179	roseberry top
S0058	roseberry top yeah
S0179	roseberry top
S0058	it do sound like a dessert
S0179	yes it do rather
S0058	what will the what be they go for a tonight we can just see what we feel like when we get there it's quite grim but at the same time sort of the ridge be quite cool from the sort of
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	eh i don't relay know how many dvds so we have the final sort of feature length film episode em film length feature episode or whatever they call it eh and then i feel like em we've get a vhs a sort of poster thing of the series the two new series but not
S0058	right hard to know whether it would be kind of you know thirty pound no one really buy them so they can charge more
S0179	i think we find her for a tenner in hmv the other day
S0058	yeah that's a bite better well that will be fun i've never really watch it it would be nice to eh
S0179	watch it by a series of
S0058	yes well look how much that be on amazon cos it's quite expensive in the shop occasionally you find them in sales but more often it's
S0179	i find them in hmv and they be about twenty quid
S0058	i think it be twenty something it be
S0179	well that's fine
S0058	it's fine but i think look on amazon because
S0179	it's cheap for two box set like that
S0058	but yeah but i think it's worth look on amazon because they might just have it reduce i think they're more likely to have it reduce and it's not you know not any different from get it from town
S0179	well it be because you have to wait and i want to
S0058	depend
S0179	well if not you have to wait about a week
S0058	yeah that's not et end of the world we don't need it urgently
S0179	i'd like it urgently
S0058	okay fair enough i be go to say if we order tonight or tomorrow that's as quick as go to get it next weekend
S0179	yes it would
S0058	i didn't realise you be feel for urgent but yeah
S0179	no i just want to
S0058	okay imagine if we get it for you know eight ninety nine it might be worth
S0179	but it won't there's no way it'll be on for that
S0058	okay well we'll have a look it's kind of weird i mean i'm kind of wonder what the last series be go to be like whether it's go to be just a bite sad you know cos they're all a bite older and or whether it's go to stay be good cos it hasn't really get worse quality i don't think
S0179	no
S0058	and i i wouldn't particularly be able to pick out a favourite series but i think they've all be a very similar quality
S0179	i think it even improve with age because the relationships develop
S0058	yeah i think they i think have get more interest
S0179	yeah i find myself like wife for example
S0058	yeah yeah i think em there's eh picture on the back of the last series make you think oh cos do doesn't he die at the end of the seventh series or apparently like sherlock holmes but then that's really bad for the last series
S0179	i've not hear that i don't know where you've get that
S0058	off the back of the box
S0179	oh right
S0058	maybe it wasn't maybe it be deliberate so maybe it be kind of it be a cliff hanger where you think he be dead em maybe it wasn't sort of that impression but
S0179	wow
S0058	what's that
S0179	we'll find out in a minute
S0058	yeah oh it's one of those with a box at the back i love those rudimentary boot ah cool it have get the box on the back ah that's so cool
S0179	that be very cool
S0058	sweet
S0179	this guy be cos he's manage sixty quite comfortably
S0058	yeah not bad how be the
S0179	he's not
S0058	yeah nice
S0058	in it do look in very condition it be awfully shiny i wouldn't mind go for a drive a really sort of classic car that would be cool
S0179	talk of drive at some point i do probably next saturday need to check the oil and tyre pressure
S0058	right yeah yeah put it on the board
S0179	i think you need to
S0058	yeah i do i could do that today
S0179	yeah
S0058	we can do it now i mean there's always gap in the complete process so i could do that if it doesn't take long so i could do that when i've get something in cook for a little while
S0179	yes you could
S0058	it doesn't have to be particularly nice you know em yeah that would work it be a good vacuum for do that with actually
S0179	it's a good vacuum for do almost anything
S0058	yeah pretty much i don't yeah i mean the only thing that a lot of people be bother by be the fact that you and it's not really an issue but they don't have that much force if it doesn't get too full
S0179	then you don't have the change bag
S0058	yeah well exactly that be nice no faffing about and that's one less thing to buy once you've buy the units you don't really have to buy the new part
S0179	and of of course in ten years that pay for itself
S0058	exactly yeah the thing be like you know hoover bag bin bag be they're really expensive especially if you've get a fancy hoover and you need to get the brand hoover bag and you you need to get the ones that fit
S0179	well it's probably not patent as a new so you probably get sort of home brand ones you get a a it look far far better in
S0058	so funny last night when you and
S0179	yeah it be wasn't it
S0058	that be really funny oh my goodness cos it be oh that ones' a bite better look more like a bird oh it be interest though that you'll like there's things that we like because our father's have them
S0179	yes but i now like for different reason

S0179	it be very annoy again what be the advantage of drive like this
S0058	yeah
S0179	just what be they gain
S0058	just you can't do that cause a massive tailback for what yeah for another few metres yeah he's still not pass him have he just pull in there now it's stupid the other guy want to drive in but you know be

S0179	em superb
S0058	mm what do you say there
S0179	i be just say superb
S0058	superb sorry
S0179	that car have very constructively speed up aggressively so this police car be just
S0058	yeah
S0179	alright stop
S0058	yeah it's really bad it's not at all you know you've get you just need to set an example it's really bad of course you couldn't say well i saw a police car do this speed recently you know
S0179	well you could you could if you'd actually catch it if you have it on video camera or
S0058	yeah
S0179	you're either on you're not unless you be you're by the traffic act which do actually apply to you unless you're train or respond to an emergency
S0058	yeah
S0179	ah
S0058	yes never mind
S0179	oh cyclists
S0058	i didn't think you be allow cyclists maybe it isn't a kind of restrict one seem to be
S0058	yeah afar enough i guess yeah so maybe you can cycle along the yeah it just seem like it wouldn't be much fun
S0179	i don't know it's a straight road there's enough there's enough of a verge for you to be in actually
S0058	yeah there be actually nice little cycle lane down here
S0179	bizarrely
S0058	yeah fair enough i guess
S0179	so i'm hop that we just sit on this road and then it just fit on to the a1m i think that's what happen
S0058	do you want me to have a look
S0179	yeah just to check
S0058	but all the sign have be say a1 or there have be sign for it so
S0179	we're get to the of jam harriet yey
S0058	oh that's
S0179	pass the police car
S0058	wouldn't do that we're go at a reasonable speed
S0179	no it's there it's just turn off it actually do sort of
S0058	yeah so em we need to go on it's so it's like come off again we we the a19 doesn't actually go directly into the a1m but em we go on to the a168 and i imagine it will be signpost
S0179	but it's a direct isn't it as in we just take this road it just change its name
S0058	yeah oh sorry yeah yeah we stay on yeah no you're right the a19 come off at a junction we be close enough to it's that first yeah we sit stay on this road em and then that feed into the a1m so yeah it should be nice and straight forward yeah like i say i think there will be service further north than itself em so
S0179	likely i should think
S0058	i've get on here a specialise tourist attraction for somebody in the country
S0179	it's actually that place
S0058	yeah it's on the yeah
S0179	oh
S0058	it's impressive consider it's just house that be of interest to a few literary people maybe i'm underestimate it but i just don't think i be
S0179	have you what sorry
S0058	underestimate his appeal i just don't think he have massive appeal yes so we stay on this road now this be where the a19 come off we em we don't want to carry on i think it carry on down to york
S0179	yeah i think that's that we be on it when we go to em or whatever it be
S0058	right
S0179	that's that's good
S0058	shandy hall yes it's well of course it's not that's what it's be call since em it get name after the house in
S0179	oh right
S0058	so yeah sorry yeah so i should explain em it's not it's just coxwold priory house or whatever the priory and coxwold vicarage and it i don't think it have any particular interest name but they call the house in tristram shandy be call shandy hall and they've name it in honour of laurence sterne
S0179	because it be autobiographical
S0058	they be what sorry
S0179	it be semi autobiographical
S0058	em kind of em as in it wasn't about his life but he's very much the figure of suppose to be write down the story so it's a it's not autobiographical as such but you can identify the two figure and tristram doesn't really figure in it very much do that make sense em it's a very odd novel it's more about his family and what happen before he be bear and what happen when he's a very young child and stuff eh
S0179	right and be a vicar yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	eh
S0058	very nice
S0179	interest just to to yorkshire and about
S0058	yeah no i mean what i'd really like to do be em we all go to so we leap to eh yeah i mean i think i spend a bite of time in yorkshire as a child like on holiday and stuff but haven't really be there since it would be nice to explore a bite of the country yeah there's a roman site at thorough bridge just off the a1 load of kind of interest sound properties and things

S0058	yeah
S0179	way to get here
S0058	it's very easy isn't it all this eh this go north to south stuff
S0179	much easier as well i'm actually incline to have to say that's a nicer default
S0058	that's easier than go up and then come off the yeah
S0179	with that really annoy bite at busford
S0058	cross the what
S0179	at busford there with the
S0058	yeah yeah true well that's the way my dad always go but i think it be yeah it's very civilise and you get to do the cool bite so be this the em service in forty miles

S0179	yes
S0058	so a place call snape
S0179	snape
S0058	snape yeah as in the character not too for from here actually
S0179	oh so
S0058	this be an awesome song my mum's get all the abba stuff on record so it's pretty cool i think i've tell you my sister and me use to listen to it you know we weren't allow to take the ones of the record play cos we'd smash them so we just use to sit and listen to them and then when they'd finish my mum would change them over for us
S0179	nice
S0058	of course it be difficult to like switch track on a record you can't skip one so you've get to listen to whole thing in the order intend it's a very different way of look at music
S0179	yes it be
S0058	like in the past the the order of song an album be record in now
S0179	yes now but yes in term of its so that's
S0058	yeah i mean in all fairness i still like listen to albums in sequence i think artists do put think into it and it often balance the songs better cos otherwise you end up with a a load of happy ones and a load of miserable ones all din of bunch up em whereas it's normally kind of balance out but yeah people shuffle through individuals there's less of a kind of you know whereas the record be necessarily a whole obviously you can skip track but it's not easy and you've just get listen to it
S0179	yeah so we'll be at wetherby in in about ten minutes
S0058	get some food
S0179	be we go to have lunch
S0058	yeah ah good my friend have a record player it's a very way of listen to music
S0179	yes not very efficient
S0058	yeah exactly kind of a bite pretty and a little bite silly and old fashion but have say that he have get a you know an apple laptop so he's not exactly eh i think that be 's influence as well i think he be quite keen for him to get one
S0179	yes
S0058	ah it's so sad
S0179	haven't meet the new boy yet
S0058	no true he might be amaze
S0179	true but it would be hard to beat
S0058	be awesome i don't know you know seem really keen on and you know he wasn't to love in york and yeah that's nice
S0179	mm
S0058	i do think it's really interest though how it's work out for him cos he always oh em
S0179	who be he
S0058	em it's oh i'll see what she say ah badly i be in hospital on friday home at the weekend have surgery tomorrow i'll let you know when i'm back in town poor soul right i'll em i'll text her back and say em
S0179	say we're just both think about you and
S0058	yeah
S0058	sorry 's cool
S0179	six minutes
S0058	awesome i'm hop that's be nice just to to be remember be sometimes nice if you're away from people it's easier to forget if you if someone's not around you so i hope it's nice to be remind that people be you know root for her yeah em so i just think it's interest what's happen with that he's you know he always seem quite em you know really into the theatre thing and more career focus than kind of play or relationships or whatever and you know more i could have imagine him do that take it quite seriously and will to give up a lot for it but actually
S0179	he's decide not to
S0058	it's interest that he's not that bother and it's not really his thing he's actually pick different priorities i just think it's really interest i mean yeah i'm not massively surprise but i think it's em it's not entirely unlike but i mean yeah it just make me think that it's sort of quite serious because he's never really be like that with when we've be talk about relationships in the past he's never give that impression of be really into long term give up things for for relationship and you know more into kind of you know he's quite openly be into you know have fun and maybe a relationship but more into just meet people and you know it's all it's just the beard you see the beard have make him sensible and not into
S0179	well they tend to have that effect
S0058	i be very dubious but he say it should be do i think 's get a beard i can see that happen as in my cousin
S0179	yeah what's 's boyfriend call again
S0179	yeah
S0058	yes and em next next time we go we'll make sure we meet him they have like fancy dress party posh dinner party where there's just
S0179	yes be well suit to his cousins and
S0058	he be it's great well he always use to talk very kind of warmly and excitedly about spend time with them and go up to yorkshire and you know it seem to be a nice thing that he love do i i mean i do sort of wonder how his parent feel but they must be aware of how well he do i'm just not sure if he get on quite so well with his parent
S0179	well i suppose they're people of his own generation
S0058	well yeah well no i mean but the fact he's now live with another boyfriend his parent i just wonder if they're a little bite
S0179	well that be mostly for i think
S0058	yeah
S0179	as in if it's something he want to do it be a very good job
S0058	what want to do sorry
S0179	i say if it be something he want to do it's a very good job
S0058	yes
S0179	it's very good
S0058	yea yeah and i guess it be either your em south em or em what's it call
S0179	southend
S0058	southend i be think southport yeah it be either there or southend to do it for free as in could have afford to do it and not have lot of family there so but no its em i'm just really please that he seem happy
S0179	mm excuse me
S0058	sorry
S0179	i say excuse me
S0058	excuse i'm not quite sure what for but
S0179	cos i burp
S0058	no need to be excuse for that it's no problem
S0179	thank you
S0058	anything bigger
S0179	em
S0058	expensive
S0179	it's about ninety second
S0058	cool
S0058	i just no i start say that yes nice flappy thing on the car in front
S0179	yeah
S0058	it must be make a racket inside the car
S0179	it's half a mile now to be fair we pull in but now
S0058	he's pull back in let him overtake you
S0179	yeah what the fuck do you think you're do
S0058	bloody hell that be scary
S0179	that be very scary how about your vehicle a metre in front and behind we've see quite a lot today
S0058	yeah i've see a lot of that i don't know why specifically it's be such a this wasn't the ready rent a van you see he's be better behave
S0179	now i'm interest to see where this individual park
S0058	probably right in the middle of two space
S0179	no i mean close to us or not
S0058	oh right
S0179	shall we eat lunch and then go into the tour bus
S0058	yeah i'm happy to do that
S0179	cos then we can sort of the next leg be longer it would probably make sense to set off as soon as after that as possible five past now no sorry
S0058	i respectfully disagree
S0179	yes
S0058	ah lovely
S0179	right
S0058	shall i get lunch
S0179	i would yes

S0058	i've get ham and cheese cheese
S0179	cheese of the fruit variety
S0058	ah ha
S0179	and motorway noise
S0058	lovely spot for a picnic
S0179	maybe not entirely but to fair we could probably just take these inside and eat them there but eh
S0058	this be nice it out a little bite even if you're in the car it's pretty em
S0179	if you say so what's this again roast chicken and lemon and herb mayonnaise
S0058	mm
S0179	quite nice
S0058	mine's ham hock and extra mature cheddar cheese on multi seed farmhouse brown bread
S0179	ah yeah i know you like it mature
S0058	what do you think about my mum's bread what oh no link there thank for that
S0179	when do we have your mum's bread
S0058	as toast
S0179	mm i think why not just buy bread
S0058	well i do wonder if it's any cheaper it's very nice
S0179	the cake weren't i mean there's nothing wrong with them but there's nothing right with them either
S0058	of course cos you've have them before cos i've bring some on holiday once
S0179	mm it's funny but give it be your family that introduce me to wrap how your parent be eat them with knives and fork
S0058	yeah they enjoy them once we kind of when i say oh you know be you ready to go in a minute they be like be the chicken cook i be like yes it's cook i'm not go to poison you and your dad be like your mum normally cook it you know nuke it's nuke's it completely i'm like i know it doesn't need cook for that long strip that long you can do in about three minutes we've have significantly longer
S0179	mm this be pretty good actually m and s quality
S0058	mm well these taste the difference one's be nice and they're not because they're part of the deal
S0179	mm i mean do you want to swap or do you want to keep what be yours
S0058	em i'm happy either way if you're
S0179	i'd quite like to keep it personally i just think i should offer
S0058	no it's fine yeah no that's very kind of you i'm good i'm not sure the eh i'm not sure the grapes be necessarily the best quality item they be the best value item but you know
S0179	didn't want anything else
S0058	well exactly i think most of them probably chocolate and crisp really need to stop inhale the bread
S0179	yes
S0058	we could still smell catherine's fag a little bite in the in the kitchen when she be smoke it
S0179	mm i be far too drink to care by that point
S0058	yeah i wasn't that keen on her light the fag on the hob i be like my there's be too much gas
S0179	i be quite proud of the solution
S0058	no it be a very clever solution but i be bite like uh
S0179	show i have work class root too well at least i've watch work class people
S0058	nice
S0179	on television
S0058	which work class person have you see light a fag on a hob
S0179	terry
S0058	ah right that do make sense
S0179	want to get a lead on that dog otherwise it's go to have a very short life
S0058	what's this
S0179	oh there's a spaniel out the gorgeous but he's quite frisky as you might understand have be shove in a car for a while
S0058	well quite grape
S0179	sorry
S0058	grape eh
S0179	yes i will oh well quality
S0058	not very nice not to tell us that the em mango wasn't
S0179	mm right then in out roundabout
S0058	yeah
S0179	okay
S0058	cue
S0179	mm
S0058	the dog
S0179	in principle yeah in practice no it's okay for a while but you do need someone to look after it it's not really fair to leave it at home all day when you're at work i don't think unless you've get two
S0058	cos dog keep each other company kind of well enough
S0179	some dog do so dog's like beagles oh god be pack dog so they prefer basically prefer you need if you have one you need two really they prefer dog company to human company
S0058	whereas for some dog would it not make much difference em
S0179	well the spaniels be sort of neither here nor there and colly be fairly sort of people dog
S0058	yeah i'm just have an image of those blue napkins i be present with the first time i go on holiday with your family
S0179	oh yeah it's a special car for special people now yeah i'm glad that 's join and i've have a chance to get to know him because apart from anything else it's give me a good idea of i didn't actually want to do a phd you know i'm get a bite bore with i almost get a bite bore of work at the moment and that's on quite a variety of project
S0058	yeah it's much more fun on a phd
