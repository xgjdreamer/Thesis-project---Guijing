S0238	erm and it's i buy that recorder actually to try to record birdsong because i'm hopeless at identify birdsong and i think i've get a dvd but you watch the dvd then you go out in the woods and you can't remember so i think if i record stuff while i be out there i could come back and play it and immediately watch the dvd and try to identify what i'd hear and it do it you're walk through the woods and yes it pick up bird from quite a distance away but i've never actually get around to to listen to them try to it's really difficult you you press record and the damn thing shut up again erm or you press record and you get fifteen different bird all call at the same time in different with different songs and it's just
S0389	we'll have to buy you one of those clock have you see the clock where er er every so there be twelve different bird songs so at
S0238	mm
S0389	on the hour at one o'clock two o'clock three o'clock
S0238	mm
S0389	then you will get a different bird tweet and it's like a
S0238	and do it tell you what it be
S0389	erm i haven't investigate cos i haven't we we don't have clock that chime or but erm
S0238	yeah yeah
S0389	but erm yeah we'll have to investigate yeah i i presume i presume certainly if it it'll tell you when you get with the instructions of the box you'll get you know at one o'clock you will hear i presume and i think there be also picture on the face
S0238	right
S0238	i'm look very dubious though cos i can imagine it keep me awake all night
S0389	well you'd have to have it in here always
S0238	yeah but i sleep with with i normally have that door open cos i get up from time to time and get a drink of water or something so
S0389	mm
S0238	that wouldn't necessarily stop me hear it
S0389	ah right no that that might not be a good idea
S0238	put it this way i buy i use to have a lovely little erm alarm clock which be really neat for travel and everything which be in my bedroom and it break i'd have it for years and years and it break and it just i you know i think the battery have go and i'd replace it and no it didn't so i go to buy another one and i all i be look for at that point be something small and neat buy it bring it home first night i have to put it i just couldn't take it cos the tick be too loud
S0389	mm
S0238	so i go again i mean they're only little cheap things from the market so i go again and say look i've get to listen to this before i take it you know and buy i'm gonna buy another one and i listen to it and in the shop it be that be the quietest one he'd get it be really quiet fine i bring it home here i can't it's ridiculously loud in my bedroom i can't stand the thing put it out in the hall and even in the hall with the bedroom door open i could hear it tick it must depend on what it's stand on
S0389	erm do such a thing exist as a digital little really tiny alarm clock they must mustn't they
S0238	i guess
S0389	where you can actually set it for eight thirty six whatever because at the moment i'm the alarm clock i've get i mean it wake me up vaguely when i want to be wake up
S0238	mm
S0389	but i can't put it to quarter
S0238	mobile
S0389	well or ten past eight or quarter to eight
S0238	i use my mobile
S0389	oh right okay
S0238	which be why i haven't bother to replace the clock
S0389	mm
S0238	i mean i want i like to have i like to know what i always wake up in the night at least once often two or three time and i like to know what time it be and the only way i can do it at the moment be to switch the light on and look at me watch but it's not worth the price have something tick cos it really do irritate you
S0389	mm well i mean mine tick you didn't hear mine do you through the wall
S0238	mm
S0389	cos it you do hear it you do hear it but i mean mine's good because it's it's luminous and so you know you wake up in the night and you do know what time it be without switch the light on and stuff but as i say it it you can't make to sort of
S0238	no no
S0389	accuracy and sometimes in the morning if i'm go out and catch you know six thirty train five minutes actually make quite a difference in the middle of the night
S0238	mm yes mm mm
S0389	you know erm so always ask me what i want for christmas so i say well if you can find me a little you know so that it can go in a suitcase a little erm digital
S0238	mm
S0389	alarm clock and that's what she's buy me so she hasn't no i can't what else do you want so
S0238	mm see you know the light of a digital one also irritate me
S0389	mm hm
S0238	i wear it all the time erm so i it be an analogue on that i'd get but i if its get luminous paint on the hand that's not enough to jump out at you
S0389	that's what mine's like that's what mine that's what get mm
S0238	yes that's fine yeah erm but but an actual digital one it it actually glow and you can even if you turn it round you can still see the glow
S0389	oh right
S0238	erm
S0389	i don't think that'll put me off
S0238	but i don't i don't think that you can well i think you're right with an analogue one that you can't be that accurate with with the alarm unfortunately
S0389	mm no and as i say normally it really doesn't matter but it's just if i have early mornings and if i do the i've be offer erm erm a course at the agricultural ministry in
S0238	mm
S0389	and they like to have it before work so that's eight o'clock
S0238	mm
S0389	so i have to be there like quarter to eight so it mean get a half past six train more or less and and then you really don't want to be wake up ten minutes more than more than necessary
S0238	no no
S0389	yeah
S0238	mm no i i've start use my mobile as an alarm and discover by accident that you don't need to leave the clock you don't need to leave the phone on if you switch it off it still work as an alarm
S0389	oh right and use when we're away
S0238	mm
S0389	he use his his digital
S0238	and obviously you can set that to a precise minute
S0389	yeah his his phone as a as an alarm
S0238	and it's not okay you get this voice go the it's time to get up the time be seven twenty two
S0238	it's time to get up the time be seven
S0238	you know
S0389	ah
S0238	the whatever you get it's some kind of noise
S0389	yeah we just set the
S0238	you could probably actually change what it do anyway i mean i haven't i haven't investigate that but if you can change the ringtone i would imagine you can change the alarm noise as well
S0389	and if you can and if you can turn your satnav to an australian an australian male instead of a instead of a british female yeah
S0238	mm exactly so
S0389	er
S0238	anyway i mean if you're get one from then it doesn't matter do it
S0389	yeah
S0238	but if if you don't get one i would investigate that
S0389	yeah oh yeah she always want to know in about october you know what do you want for christmas and i think i've no idea and 's useless but this year he do know what to ask her for because we'll we've be watch lewis
S0238	oh right
S0389	and we obviously miss out a complete series erm because we watch it on itv three i think it be and they're they're often repeat
S0238	right
S0389	but we've obviously miss out erm a whole series so he say well he want series x of lewis
S0238	mm
S0389	so it be very easy to tell her
S0238	mm
S0389	she be she be like you know ecstatic that three days before christmas she know what she be buy for
S0238	help yourself
S0389	yep
S0238	yep
S0389	right yours'll be in the post i hope it's rsvp the card
S0238	it be yes
S0238	erm well as i say i actually find some this year that say season's greet and and that i really like
S0389	and do you buy them from the from the meet or do you get them online
S0238	i buy them from the meet
S0389	mm
S0238	erm because you're not pay postage then
S0389	true
S0238	erm and in fact if you want something big she will get it for you and because she's get a lot of stuff she's not pay postage so that doesn't then that doesn't the cost doesn't get pass onto the
S0389	right
S0238	customer so
S0389	mm
S0238	it just make sense at any time if i want something from them to order it from her
S0389	and be the person who do the seed and stuff be she a member of the rspb
S0238	no er not as far as i know
S0389	mm
S0238	she's just a friend of who be the treasurer
S0389	oh i see
S0238	and the
S0389	cos i mean it's quite a good idea but some people might get a bite you know well annoy that you've get some sort of commercial thing go on that's not rspb i don't i mean it wouldn't worry me
S0238	well well as i say we use to she use to do the actual the seed from the and and there's time of year when it go and time of year when it doesn't and it's heavy and so on and she end up stop do it and i think fair enough cos and really do an awful lot
S0389	mm
S0238	erm but then come along committee meet before last and say her friend and it's all well she's get a shop in and it's sort of the equivalent of fair trade coffee but animal food if you see what i mean you know
S0389	okay yeah
S0238	so i think it's something that the rspb would approve of in other word
S0389	yeah
S0238	even though it's not actually their stuff
S0389	mm
S0238	so we say well we'll give it a try
S0389	well when i be wait for you for the meet to start there be people behind me talk
S0238	mm
S0389	and say oh this be a good idea cos they have big sack and they can order and so obviously they be happy
S0238	mm
S0389	you know and i would imagine they be not the only ones
S0238	i don't know i can't remember what the what we whether we're actually get anything from it or whether it's just she's come and we're provide her a venue i mean she's give up an even when she wouldn't normally be work
S0389	yeah yeah yeah but as i say if it's the people behind me be anything to go by people be really quite happy about it there be no question of why's she there or anything
S0238	well you see the yes okay the rspb sell stuff but it sell stuff to make money for what it do and it be a charity that that it i can't remember what the how what the timeframe be but they sort of say they've only they only have so many months of reserve of money so
S0389	oh right
S0238	if if money doesn't keep come in they don't sort of have lot of investments and things they the money that come in get use very quickly erm so yeah they need their commercial enterprises but they're not a commercial organisation what they're interest in be wildlife and if people be buy birdseed then they're preserve the bird for the next year so they shouldn't really have any problem with it i don't think
S0389	be you suppose to fee bird the whole year
S0238	mm
S0389	yeah
S0238	mm
S0389	i mean and do my dad use to too but i just didn't know whether you could leave off in the summer but
S0238	that be actually really a crucial time cos it's when they're feed their young
S0389	oh right yeah
S0238	and they've do erm study would be a better word than experiment erm cos sparrows the number of sparrows have go down quite drastically
S0389	that's why my sister be so annoy
S0238	yes
S0389	because when on the day there be the count there be no sparrows and the next day she say you know she have lot in her garden
S0238	well they'd do study of sparrows in urban settings where they feed some of them on mealworms at the time that they be feed the young and others not and it make a huge difference to how many brood be successfully raise
S0389	oh right uhu
S0238	erm which would suggest that we're just erm spray all our flower to get rid of the insects or something and they're not get the protein at the time that they need it i don't know erm but for some reason
S0389	mm
S0238	they're not get what they what they need erm and i have i mean the first last year it be really noticeable i have some grey tits and some blue tits who both have but young which they be bring
S0389	in the tree right at the bottom
S0238	i don't know where the nest be
S0389	uhu
S0238	but they be come to my feeder cos i put food out and for a a couple of months i get nothing and i be quite disappoint i do get quite a lot of cat come through erm and then suddenly when they'd get the baby i'd get a great tit come with one day she'd get two baby and she be come and bring them to the feeder then she get the food and be put it in their mouth it be quite interest to watch next day there be three and the next and then after that there be four so they be just fledge
S0389	yeah
S0238	erm and even after they'd the the mum have stop come with them i be get the four baby all you know for for quite a few weeks they know this be where we can get food and and as far as i know all four survive you know at least
S0389	mm
S0238	er and blue tits i can't remember how many baby blue tits there be but i'd actually learn the to recognise the difference between adult and and a baby because they do look different
S0389	and you recognise the call
S0238	well
S0238	i learn a great tits call cos it's a it's a quite an irritate sort of two tone squeak erm
S0238	and i be sit outside go i wonder what that be and go and check and yes that be definitely a great tit but i mean i can identify a few things but you go out on a guide walk with these blokes who be the the chap sit behind that guy with the beard who's do the who do the
S0389	who you be talk who you be talk to
S0238	yes he's a warden at nature reserve which be just down in erm and you and i've be and do erm what they call vis mig which be visible migration which be a time that everything's migrate you go and stand there's a couple of weeks where you just go out every night at duskish and and count how many things you see go over that's all he's
S0389	you don't have to say what it be
S0238	yes you do
S0389	oh
S0238	erm this be what i'm say he's go right i'm twenty three redwing and two wood pigeon and i'm go i can just about recognise a wood pigeon when it's fly but how the hell do you know that's a redwing they're just specs erm you know and so he can recognise the silhouette like that which be phenomenal er i mean even to the point of his say okay there's twenty three redwings and there's a field fair in there as well and i'm go they're they're both thrushes but and okay you know that there's a good chance that you might have a mixture of the two because that's what they do but even so how can you tell when they're up there against the sky
S0389	i don't know how you count either
S0238	well that be a i mean he be try to teach us how to count and
S0389	you know i mean when you're when when you see on on springwatch or autumnwatch and they're say you know in this what do you call the swathe when they do all the beautiful pattern
S0238	erm i know what you mean flock i don't really know another word
S0389	erm and they say you know there be thirty thousand and i think well okay you know they're say about thirty thousand but i don't know how you even say there be about thirty thousand
S0238	no
S0389	i wouldn't have a clue i just think there's lot of bird
S0238	yes erm i don't know how you count those sort of number cos we weren't see any anything like as big as that erm he be sort of kind of do it in tens or
S0389	mm
S0238	you know sort of well that's it it you can't be very accurate but also we be there be there be five or six of us stand there and everybody be come up with a slightly different number
S0389	mm
S0238	and his wife sort of write things down could you pass the butter please erm write things down and and you know they kind of kind of go with an average if you've get several people there
S0389	yeah yeah
S0238	erm but i just find it impossible i be stand there be interest but i really wasn't contribute to the count because i just couldn't watch things move about like that
S0389	i don't think i would be able to look up that long
S0238	well
S0389	i get dizzy
S0238	that's that be also a problem yes you get dizzy and you get backache
S0389	because because when i be paint our sit room i be do the ceiling and i i couldn't do it for long
S0238	mm
S0389	because because of look up
S0238	yes yes well that's why i get to do my bedroom ceiling
S0238	cos i think i would just fall i i do the er coving in in erm that room you know no problem so that's up a stepladder because you can hold the wall with your other hand
S0389	mm mm
S0238	but in the middle of the room no
S0389	no
S0238	erm
S0389	and i i be very glad i'd finish it and i be okay cos a friend of mine's just crack three rib er not paint the kitchen but erm clean you know on top of cupboards and various things and she fell
S0238	mm oh dear
S0389	and er
S0238	that do you try that that's the quince
S0389	yes it's very good
S0238	you see i think it's too sweet
S0389	no i quite like it but then i be i have get a sweet tooth
S0238	well i have get a sweet tooth but i like jam to have flavour i don't like strawberry jam because it just doesn't it's too sweet and it doesn't really taste of very much
S0389	i don't like strawberry jam because when i be a kid i have a huge tablet and the doctor ask me to erm swallow this on strawberry jam
S0238	mm
S0389	if they'd give me water i'd have swallow it happily but the strawberry jam i gag on it and do you know for years i couldn't eat strawberry jam without gag and of course grandma's always give you strawberry jam don't they
S0238	erm
S0389	when when you when you come to tea well with my grandma's
S0238	i don't know
S0389	when you go to tea you you get strawberry jam
S0238	mine give me fish and chip i don't remember the strawberry jam
S0389	and and my mum be the sort of mum who say well you know they've go to a lot of trouble
S0238	yes
S0389	eat it
S0238	yes my mother would have
S0389	you know eat it but eat it just a little bite you know
S0238	yes
S0389	so i use to spread it very thinly but
S0389	i'm okay now i can eat strawberry jam now but i don't enjoy strawberry jam that oh oh dear you you don't look as though you're gonna be able to walk
S0238	no damn it this very i think it be just a great tit but i keep a bird which will insist on feed on the opposite side of the so i can't bloody identify it er and i oh i and i wonder if i get be get a chaffinch because chaffinches be really common and i never get them here i never even see them in the tree
S0389	be there something they fee on that's not round here
S0238	i don't know erm i just i mean if you go for a walk you see lot and they do come to feeders when i be in scotland last year that be it be chaffinches and siskins which you don't get out
S0389	siskins i wouldn't know at all
S0238	erm and and tits but i mean
S0389	and be that very similar to a chaffinch
S0238	it no but it it's a similar there be they're all a similar sort of you know small bird be what we're talk about no they're sort of greenish yellowish
S0389	mm no idea
S0238	erm but again i haven't really see them around here but i be sit there with my bird book and and the same bird be come every time you know
S0389	mm
S0238	that look like a good array of pills
S0389	yeah it be one because i don't erm what what don't i have something i'm something deficient
S0238	oh be you very deficient
S0389	mm
S0238	if you're not full feel free to eat that erm
S0389	i'm fine no
S0238	well i'm sorry you're gonna have to wait for your coffee while i finish me bread
S0389	i've actually get to remember not to take aspirin as from monday
S0238	right
S0389	cos my i'm have my teeth out
S0238	oh right oh
S0389	cos they're you know blood thinners
S0238	mm yeah i see what you mean cos i be try to work out do aspirin react with anaesthetic or something but so you have two local anaesthetics on your teeth on different side and you just won't be able to talk even would ya
S0389	no no she say you know i'd have i'd look like a hamster for at least two days if not three
S0238	really
S0389	mm yeah well this one this one be very loose so that will be an easy job just pull out
S0238	mm
S0389	but the top one it'll be a dig
S0238	oh dear
S0389	sort of
S0238	mm
S0389	yeah but why i have to go off aspirin to have two teeth out i don't know when you have an operation i have my gallbladder out
S0238	mm
S0389	and i didn't have to stop
S0238	oh
S0389	i didn't have to stop take aspirins so don't ask me
S0238	well
S0389	that be when i actually go to the cardiologist
S0238	mm
S0389	and they say go and talk to him
S0238	mm
S0389	we won't do it until you've talk to the cardiologist and he tell us what you're suppose to do
S0238	mm
S0389	and he say no it's alright so
S0238	well
S0238	possibly if you go and talk to the cardiologist he would say it doesn't matter the dentist'll be cover her back won't she because that's what people do nowadays in case you sue her
S0389	yeah yeah of course
S0238	erm
S0389	yeah i don't think germany's catch up quite as long as much as as england have with the sue
S0238	well
S0389	because i mean you don't have in you don't have in the on the television you don't have advert for you know we be doctor for you or whatever it be
S0238	mm
S0389	erm if you have a problem come and phone us and people think they don't you know no win no fee
S0238	mm erm well i mean even if she's not think quite like that i think she's probably get regulations that that er err on the side of caution shall we say and she's not in a position to make the call really be she
S0389	no no no i mean okay i can understand it's didn't don't really worry me but i just must remember to do it
S0238	mm
S0238	on the other hand if it be okay for your gallbladder it probably will be if you don't remember just lie if she ask you a question
S0389	mm
S0238	so you're the one who's take those tablets but 's the one who's have nosebleeds
S0389	yeah
S0238	mm
S0389	he didn't have one the day after he go to the doctor and he they cauterise the erm one nostril
S0238	mm
S0389	erm so maybe it be just a weakness of the
S0238	mm
S0389	blood vessels in his nose or but he do blow hard when he blow his nose you really hear it through the whole flat
S0389	erm so i think he have to be a bite more gentle with himself
S0238	mm
S0389	he's get to go back this come thursday and then they'll think about it think they'll the doctor'll think about it and then decide he have to have lot of appointments you know that'll do his bank balance balance good
S0238	mm
S0389	i don't think he'll i hope it doesn't happen before we go away
S0238	yeah
S0238	mm yeah it be happen i remember when it be happen with me i be do the light for a play cos i can remember it start and i be sit in the box you know but it would just no warn no nothing and you'd just suddenly realise that you be and so you get blood on your clothe cos you don't realise what's happen until it's too late to stop it
S0389	mm yeah
S0238	but as i say i be lucky it just stop again so
S0389	mine just stop i have them regularly when i be a child and i mean you know not sort of ten minutes i be awake for an hour
S0238	mm
S0389	and then it would stop and then i would be asleep and it would start again
S0238	mm
S0389	i can remember mum put ice cub on my neck
S0238	yeah
S0389	to stop it and it be awful but and i don't know i must have be i don't know ten eleven and then it just stop
S0238	mm well i go to the doctor when i be a kid a teenager i can't remember to get advice because i be get so many nosebleeds erm and it actually come up on qi sort of what you do when you've get a nosebleed and i know the answer because i can remember at school the school nurse lie me down on my back after i and okay that nosebleed be cos someone have hit me across the face with a hockey stick during the middle i mean not intentionally
S0238	erm so fair enough erm and it's horrible like because you're swallow the blood
S0389	i know
S0238	it make you feel sick erm you know but that be not what you're suppose to do and in fact if you do if you do what you be suppose to do it usually do clear up fairly quickly but
S0389	and you get a huge great clot out of your nose
S0238	mm
S0389	that be a horrible bite of it as well
S0238	mm yeah mm no the last one i can remember have when i be young be when i go to china with the british council and my my luggage get take off the well it everybody's luggage should have be take off the plane in hong kong but everybody else have arrive in a bunch and sort it and i arrive very early cos i travel down overnight to catch this flight so i'd already check in and i didn't realise that they'd put together two two cheap ticket and although it be the same plane so the luggage could stay on erm it should have be take off and put back on again and so mine be take off and in hong kong i don't know now but in those days they didn't have announcements they have someone stand there with a little card with you name on which i didn't see so i arrive in the
S0389	in chinese
S0238	no no no in english
S0238	in hong kong this be in the days when hong kong be be british erm so i arrive in in beijing at sort of it be the end of august begin of september begin of september and it be very hot which of course isn't good for nosebleeds cos that thin your blood and then i get all the stress of be i go to get my luggage cos we'd only get a day there and i be go onto my next place you know and i didn't have a lot of money with me because i didn't have a lot of money i'd be a student for however many years erm so i wake up the first morning in beijing with blood all over the place and and of course you couldn't get any ice we be just stick in this student accommodation erm and there be tepid water and that be all there be there wasn't even cold water you run the tap it didn't really come very cold
S0389	mm well actually wasn't very very enthusiastic when i say ice cub but er
S0238	but it work
S0389	mm
S0238	and i put i just get a really cold keep get the flannel cold and if you hold that across here actually that usually bring the temperature down and if you don't really have to do ice but you certainly need cold right coffee
S0389	yes please
S0238	ah
S0389	with with milk please
S0238	oh right it's a good job you say that cos i think i just tend to assume that people be gonna black i don't know
S0389	i assume nobody ever take sugar in coffee cos i don't
S0238	well actually i i probably would have ask because workmen usually have milk and sugar and i've have quite a few workmen in this house over the last few years so
S0389	yeah
S0238	yes that's definitely a great tit that i'm see now
S0389	it's it's behave itself now be it
S0238	yes
S0389	it's look into the camera watch the birdie erm
S0238	well i've get some the thing that i've get in a squirrel proof thing be sunflower kernels and they really go for those and they always go in the far side where i hang it but that's that thing in a cage but it would even when it see they come from that tree
S0389	oh yeah
S0238	seem so many it's very difficult to see what it be when it do that
S0389	be they really squirrel proof
S0238	erm i think so i mean i have get a squirrel proof one for peanuts as well but last year i have a woodpecker come into the peanuts and obviously that couldn't get through those little hole so this year i think right i'll leave that one out rather than the squirrel proof one but i haven't see a woodpecker so er i don't particularly want to encourage squirrels
S0389	do you ever come to our house in
S0238	yes twice
S0389	oh of course you do cos you help put up the the famous tent
S0238	yes
S0389	well we have a we use to have erm a woodpecker there
S0238	right
S0389	use to come
S0238	well they're just so be that be that a red spot you know the
S0389	mm yeah
S0238	cos they're so spectacular aren't they
S0389	yeah very very
S0238	the first time i saw one what be that wow it would come more or less the same time every day
S0389	yeah
S0238	for several weeks
S0389	and the other bird we have in our garden be jays
S0238	yes
S0389	they're spectacular too
S0238	yeah i know i have have those this year i've have a pair er actually come to the feeders which be quite unusual cos they're quite shy
S0389	yeah
S0238	i sort of switch it from one to the other you go and sit down i'll bring it in oh and that that rise be look a bite pathetic i i prune me roses back and some of them still have blossom on so i that one have a few bud on and i think they might come out but they didn't
S0389	i'm just hop our roses survive the winter cos they've get this i don't know what it i don't know what it's call in english any more but it's erm it's a fungal disease and i know as i tell you you have to spray
S0238	yeah yeah
S0389	but they say and you must rake up all the leave
S0238	yeah
S0389	because they because it's a fungus that will survive frost
S0238	right
S0389	erm so i do and of course we mulch them
S0238	yep
S0389	so erm i couldn't separate the mulch stuff and the leave and i have to rake everything up
S0238	mm
S0389	and whether i get it all i don't know but i just hope so because you know they're new and they're just get establish and i don't want to start again can you if they do die
S0238	yeah
S0389	i'm wonder whether i then couldn't put roses there and that would be really a mess because we we've as the garden be so organise
S0238	yes
S0389	that this be this be the rise bed with the lavender round the edge
S0238	yeah yeah
S0389	and you know it'd be really problem
S0238	oh what i mean the question would be whether the whether the the mildew have erm sort of establish itself in the soil i suppose see my dad have that with he use to grow cabbage and sprout and cauliflowers and he get i can't remember what it's call but something that affect brassica and he just decide he have to abandon that bed i mean he put something else in it but he couldn't grow those things there any more
S0389	ah ha
S0238	erm so i'm sorry that's not very encourage be it but i don't i would have think if they die that that would be because well i don't know you'll see what happen next year if they come up next year and they're look unhappy that mean you haven't manage to get rid of it doesn't it
S0389	yep and the then they say if you haven't get rid of it you can you can they spray them again but you must have a different spray
S0238	right
S0389	so i mean i have
S0238	sorry you say
S0389	i wouldn't i wouldn't despair immediately but
S0238	you say yes to milk yeah
S0389	yes please
S0238	cos right okay sorry you just say with a little bite too much coffee in there so that i can't fit the milk in ah right
S0389	yeah
S0238	erm
S0389	what's the matter
S0238	be that enough milk sorry i've get it very full
S0389	no i'd rather have a bite more please
S0238	i'm think i'm not sure right okay
S0389	shall i come and slurp it
S0238	i be gonna say if i put more milk in there you're not go to be able to carry it be you do you want to do it yourself and then that be the problem with make the coffee directly into the mug you can't quite see what's happen until you lift the filter up oh i misjudge it oh
S0389	you're not go to be able to go for a walk
S0238	i don't i really don't think i be no i'm sorry but if i'd have the experience of go for a walk actually make it better then i would say yes but actually go for a walk seem to make it worse so
S0389	mm
S0238	i would just have think it would loosen it up and and help but it wouldn't seem to
S0389	well we'll chat and then i'll ring i'll ring
S0238	yeah
S0389	and say hello do you have a good day yesterday and then i'll tootle off
S0238	well if you want to ring her on my landline

S0238	ah right

S0238	yeah
S0389	cos otherwise she would have felt
S0238	yes yes
S0389	erm mortify but these people who who she go out with i didn't want to say well you know i'd come all the way from germany and fly especially to manchester
S0238	yeah

S0238	right
S0389	they take her out they'll take her to the seaside and they'll just sit her in a deck chair and she enjoy be by the seaside and
S0238	oh right
S0389	and they erm i mean when dad die they bring her up to the funeral and erm you know they look after her it's not they're not there sort of every day or anything
S0238	no but still yeah that's
S0389	but they do they do look after her and i mean be there in oh september
S0238	mm
S0389	and i be there in i go to see her in april last
S0238	yeah
S0389	but i mean she doesn't see us very often
S0238	no
S0389	erm and but i mean we be at we be her only live relatives
S0238	right
S0389	and so and i feel we don't want to abandon her completely
S0238	mm
S0389	and she's she really do enjoy have visit i mean she talk and talk and talk and talk and talk about n about nothing really and about what she's be do
S0238	yes yeah
S0389	be exactly the same as what she's be do when you saw her the the time before but but she's lovely company she's never say you know i wish i'd see you more often and
S0238	mm yeah
S0389	she never complain about anything and she's just a happy person
S0238	right
S0389	you know she she never moan about things at all and she's a joy to be with
S0238	well that probably make a difference to er the people who look after well not look after but you know what i mean
S0389	yeah yeah yeah
S0238	the the erm that's much more reward isn't it
S0389	yeah
S0238	well i go er from time to time since i move from the other house i've be back to see who's the woman in the the house that back onto mine
S0389	okay
S0238	erm and it be and when i move in and he get parkinson's erm cos he use to sit out in the garden but she she tell me about it partly because they be they i can't remember what what the boundary be between us whether it be a fence or what but she have it turn into a wall and the and the back garden sort of pave because he do the garden and he couldn't cope any more but she want somewhere a bite more manageable so we have a whole conversation about that but she be the sort of person that if you if you go out and hang your wash out you get catch for half an hour
S0238	and she have a very loud voice and i be always conscious that the whole neighbourhood could hear the conversation
S0238	but very kind and things like when i be away on holiday she would know i be on holiday because my bathroom window wasn't ever open
S0389	right
S0238	yeah erm my mum and my brother go round to check on the garden and she didn't see my mum she only saw this strange man in my garden and she go and stand in her garden so that he'd know he be be watch
S0238	and then my mum come round the and she realise who he must be you know but but you know
S0389	yeah
S0238	that's the sort of neighbour you need really
S0389	yeah yeah yeah
S0238	erm so i make a point of of go back not very often
S0389	be she a widow now
S0238	so she's a widow now he die probably about three years ago but they'd be marry for fifty seven years
S0389	mm
S0238	they'd sort of be childhood sweethearts always live in the area only move about three streets but they haven't get kid so although she's get a nephew a nephew and a niece i think possibly more than you know she's certainly get a sister who's in the area erm it's not the same thing as actually have your own children who might call and so on
S0389	mm
S0238	and and she talk and talk and talk from the second you set foot in the door
S0389	yep yeah
S0238	and she's lonely
S0389	yep
S0238	and it's so sad when she be when she be such a gregarious person
S0389	mm i mean she reminisce like all old people do
S0238	mm
S0389	but she and be the sort of people that just enjoy life
S0238	mm
S0389	he he be a boilermaker and i mean didn't earn that much money but they be very thrifty
S0238	mm
S0389	and then they'd say and now we're go on the qe two
S0238	mm
S0389	you know and erm they they have a i don't know it be a concorde flight from bristol to don't know where and then then you get on the qe two and you go it wasn't a huge great cruise
S0238	mm
S0389	but the could say they've be on the qe two
S0238	yeah yeah
S0389	and she say she's so happy that she do that because now she can remember it cos die oh again about three years ago but it be merciful that he die he have throat cancer
S0238	mm
S0389	and he die before it get dreadful and he couldn't speak and swallow and
S0238	see this be
S0389	you know so it be a mercy and and i think she she realise that the only thing that and i be be really quite angry about i didn't go to the funeral because erm say no don't don't come you know
S0238	we'll it's a long way to come isn't it yeah
S0389	but go and take mum and she say these two friends of 's more or less take over
S0238	mm
S0389	and there be there sort of almost lose at her husband's funeral and that annoy she say you know you you let her grieve and do what she she want to do
S0238	yeah
S0389	rather than mm but i don't know push her about somehow
S0238	mm
S0389	erm so be quite angry about that but otherwise erm she she get through it and have she's manage very very much since but she go into this erm this shelter accommodation because even when be alive they be live in a bungalow and they have burglars who get in and rob them while they be asleep in the bedroom
S0238	oh that's not nice be it
S0389	and so she when he die she be just far too nervous to live on her own there
S0238	mm
S0389	and that's why she go into to to erm shelter accommodation not really because she be force to
S0238	mm
S0389	erm and it it wasn't a huge she wouldn't have really be rattle around in the in the bungalow
S0238	mm but yeah
S0389	but er she just felt she couldn't
S0238	oh i can understand yes i think that would be very
S0238	yeah no my the the my colleague i think i say her partner die about four years ago
S0389	mm
S0238	and that be i think it's cancer of the oesophagus or something i mean it be that sort of thing cos the first we know about it be he ring her at work and at that point she and i share a phone
S0389	right
S0238	she wasn't in the office so i pick up erm and i almost think it be a joke because his voice be so sort of hoarse and funny erm and i can't remember the he he'd never ring up before so i didn't actually know what his voice sound like you know erm but but he be ring something to do with a hospital appointment so she sort of which be why he'd ring which he wouldn't normally have do when she be at work and and er so she sort of tell me a little bite but at that point i'm not even sure he'd be diagnose but it be really really fast you know they'd be he'd have a bite of a sore throat when they go on holiday and then when and it didn't get any better while he be on holiday so eventually he go to the doctor and and sort of three months later he be dead it be that sort of thing but it be horrible at the end she say he just he be just almost like a skeleton like because he couldn't swallow
S0389	mm mm
S0238	erm lie on the bed and he be nurse at home
S0389	i mean she didn't let do she
S0238	well she be there but no they have somebody they have somebody come in erm
S0389	yeah yeah
S0238	sort of i don't think permanently but maybe twice a day or something like that
S0389	mm
S0238	and she be look after him in between
S0389	mm mm
S0238	erm but i don't know how old how old he be i probably do ask her at the time she's a couple of years older than me so at that point she might have be i think she have already turn fifty
S0389	mm
S0238	but she be either fifty or fifty one now they hadn't it it wasn't one of those relationships where they'd sort of meet when they be twenty because he have a daughter by somebody else a grow up daughter by somebody else
S0389	mm
S0238	erm he be austrian and i think they'd meet when she be work in the czech republic so but they'd certainly be together you know ten or fifteen years
S0389	mm
S0238	erm and and seem to have well as you and do a very a relationship that really work between two intelligent adults who know what they need and know what they want do you know what i mean
S0389	mm yeah yeah
S0238	erm so i think but she be so difficult to help because she's a really reserve person she's not the sort of person you can put your arm round you don't she doesn't touch you she doesn't touch people
S0389	mm that's hard yeah
S0238	and we be all say we don't know what to do
S0389	yeah
S0238	erm it's quite unusual i mean if it be a man you might get that feel although a lot of men be much more touchy feely than they than they like to let on aren't they but i mean my brother's a right total softy and always have be
S0389	yeah
S0238	but er
S0389	do do you know i mean when you be work in the in the council yeah
S0238	mm yeah yeah
S0389	cos she's very very private she's have a bad summer cos she's be suffer from depression
