S0018	okay so what be it that you do here in the magistrate court
S0074	okay i be a part time court usher which basically mean er i work twenty hours a week um monday wednesday and thursday
S0018	mhm
S0074	and the role of an usher be really about keep the court move
S0018	okay
S0074	so i try and establish what case be in during the course of the day and liaise with the legal adviser
S0018	mhm
S0074	and also the er cps lawyer
S0018	mhm
S0074	and just see that our list er all match and then i make sure that everybody's paperwork be the same and then i try and find out if any of the offenders be here
S0018	mhm
S0074	and if they be be they represent by a solicitor er er whether they want to see the duty solicitor which be a free service
S0018	uh huh
S0074	that they can have and er you know if it's a youth have they get a parent with them er be they know to the youth offend team that sort of thing
S0018	okay
S0074	and basically it's just about keep the court move
S0018	right
S0074	er
S0018	it sound like a lot of responsibilities
S0074	well not really
S0018	in one no
S0074	not really it's er i suppose it yes it sound that way but er it be really about know your way round the court
S0018	uh huh
S0074	and er just as i say make sure that er everybody's in the right place at the right time
S0074	er and maybe just you know sort of try to make sure that the paperwork be perhaps collect from wherever
S0018	uh huh
S0074	just so that er it keep go rather than end up have stop start situations
S0018	right
S0074	cos nobody really like that
S0018	cos that save save er everyone time and
S0074	absolutely yeah
S0018	save on stress for you
S0074	well i think it's the magistrates more than anybody else
S0018	uh huh
S0074	cos they er well they're volunteer
S0018	mhm
S0074	and they want to try and keep it fluid
S0018	mhm
S0074	and er so really that's what it's all about
S0018	okay
S0074	um but it's i mean it's quite interest
S0074	meet all sort of different people today we've have um tut er a group of four who er have commit a burglary and one have er drive very dangerously and er they get lot of supporters here like
S0018	uh huh
S0074	parent and girlfriends and and er er fellow er offenders and they be very vocal
S0018	oh dear
S0074	so er but yeah that's what make it quite interest really
S0018	er but er do you feel at risk or threaten
S0074	no
S0018	no
S0074	er i um
S0018	no
S0074	tut no because you're in a quite social environment anyway
S0018	mhm
S0074	and i think as long as you try and just speak to people i think you know if you try and explain
S0018	uh huh
S0074	that really it's not gonna help if they start er be vocal
S0018	right
S0074	and make contact with people in custody that sort of thing so that's
S0018	be they be they be vocal in a
S0074	er er
S0018	aggressive way or just er
S0074	yes because they're not get their own way
S0018	oh okay
S0074	so i think that's really what it's all about
S0018	oh
S0074	so
S0074	so yeah so basically that's er roughly er it
S0018	mm
S0074	and it and i mean it can be quite physical really as
S0018	mm
S0074	as you your mum'll probably tell you er cos you're sort of up and down stairs with um sort of paperwork and
S0018	mhm
S0074	er make sure again that sort of things like warrant or er um file be
S0018	mhm
S0074	with the right sort of people so it save you have a workout
S0018	aha
S0074	because you're up and down the stairs every time
S0018	there you go and you save money on the gym
S0074	that's right so that's quite nice really so so yeah so there you go so yeah
S0018	and you say that some the magistrates be volunteer
S0074	they're all volunteer
S0018	okay
S0074	yeah
S0018	er do that always happen at a local
S0074	yeah
S0018	justice level
S0074	yeah in in magistrates court
S0018	mm
S0074	they're all volunteer er they go through an interview process er i think that's quite rigid actually um and they er then have to do so many hours
S0018	uh huh
S0074	and er er they some of them be train to deal with youth matter or family matter
S0018	mhm
S0074	and er then er er i suppose they have a little bite of train in the law so that they've get some basic skills
S0018	okay
S0074	but the idea be that er the legal adviser who sit sort of below the magistrates
S0018	uh huh
S0074	er they're train legally they're solicitors basically
S0018	right mm
S0074	so the magistrates'll go out and make a decision er and then they'll call for the legal adviser to go in and she or he will just give them advice to say yes that's within the law or
S0018	uh huh
S0074	mm mm
S0074	can't do that
S0018	oh okay
S0074	er and then just yeah sort of give them some advice
S0018	uh huh
S0074	and er really the legal adviser's the person that run the court
S0018	right
S0074	yeah he or she obviously have the knowledge and
S0018	mhm
S0074	and advise them but you know fair play to them they come in and
S0018	yeah
S0074	they give their own time
S0018	definitely
S0074	um
S0018	how how often do they usually come in
S0074	well i'm not sure how many hours they have to do
S0018	mhm
S0074	but i i know certainly they have to do so so many because i know because we haven't get much work at the moment they're
S0018	right
S0074	really sort of anxious that they get their hours in
S0018	okay
S0074	tut um so yeah that's
S0018	uh huh
S0074	er that's what they do so
S0018	ah
S0074	as i say fair play to them
S0018	mm
S0074	and they and they come from all sort of background
S0018	definitely well my old chemistry teacher be a magistrate here
S0074	aha
S0018	er
S0074	so yeah
S0074	well i think that's good then
S0018	uh huh
S0074	because you know you've get an idea of the issue in school
S0018	mhm
S0074	and that sort of thing
S0018	mhm
S0074	er and i think perhaps a background in social care
S0018	yeah
S0074	that sort of thing or i as i say teach or maybe health
S0018	mhm
S0074	er because some of the issue that some of these folks have
S0018	mhm
S0074	er and the reason why they're here
S0018	mm
S0074	you know they're
S0018	yeah
S0074	perhaps involve with drug or they've get family issue that sort of thing
S0018	mm
S0074	so it's i i think it's good to have er a bite of an understand
S0018	yeah
S0074	you know
S0018	definitely
S0074	of er about why they're here and what's open to them
S0018	uh huh
S0074	and they can advise them you know obviously they use probation a lot as well
S0018	right
S0074	um who if if the magistrates feel they need to know a little bite more about that person
S0018	mhm
S0074	to see whether they're suitable for er probation er report
S0018	mhm
S0074	have some guidance maybe on drug or um any other abuse
S0018	mm
S0074	er or if it's er an assault you know maybe they need to look at their anger management that sort of thing
S0018	mhm
S0074	um they will then er give them that er guidance and the magistrates will then look at them and say yes okay this person could do that if they've get sort of medical need then er they're perhaps not suitable for do work
S0018	mm mhm
S0074	er or like i have a guy today who'd get a drink issue and er they say he wasn't suitable for do work
S0018	mm
S0074	cos i suppose if he come along and he's have a few few jar
S0018	yes
S0074	then it wouldn't be suitable
S0018	oh be that like community service
S0074	yeah
S0018	work
S0074	yeah
S0018	right
S0074	yeah er yeah
S0018	mm
S0074	so he if he be i don't know perhaps work in a shop or er you know he's er in close contact with a number of other people
S0018	mhm
S0074	then it's not fair be it if he's
S0018	mm
S0074	have a few to drink
S0018	no
S0074	so that be er
S0018	so all the people like that usually get fin or
S0074	they sometimes they get fin er in this case his case be er what have happen to him i think he be give a suspend sentence
S0018	uh huh
S0074	because he'd get something else as well
S0018	oh
S0074	so they just
S0074	decide that a suspend sentence whether that will stop him from reoffending
S0018	oh dear
S0074	i really don't know but there we be
S0018	huh
S0018	it's a complicate a complicate
S0074	yeah yeah yeah
S0018	issue isn't it
S0074	yes it be
S0018	everything
S0074	so how be you enjoy be back in the uk after all your time in spain
S0018	well um tut enjoy i've be enjoy the weather recently
S0018	not so much right now but um yeah i wouldn't say enjoy
S0074	oh
S0018	be the right word for it but
S0074	would you rather be in spain would you
S0018	life be more enjoyable in spain
S0074	tut be it
S0018	yeah
S0074	tut oh
S0018	but um but
S0074	need must
S0018	things be yeah things be a bite more serious
S0074	need must
S0018	here and a bite more
S0074	yeah
S0018	er you can you can bank on them a bite you can bank on things a little more in england which you need to do life can't just all be fun fun fun can it you know
S0074	no i suppose
S0074	that's true and i suppose in the sunshine it's quite nice to just have that approach and er er
S0018	mm
S0074	i think things be a little bite sort of lighter aren't they and
S0018	yes
S0074	you can enjoy have a sort of um tut a meal outside or a drink outside that sort of thing whereas here it's oh it's not that sort of available be it
S0018	no
S0074	and er people i think er feel much happier in themselves if they er um if they're in the sunshine don't they
S0018	i think so yeah
S0074	don't you think
S0018	i think er yeah your woes be a lot easily more easily forget
S0074	yes i think
S0018	if you can just go outside and it's a beautiful day and
S0074	that's right yeah
S0018	you just forget everything and every i mean i notice it when um in england when it's be beautiful weather unexpectedly
S0074	yep
S0018	um just as a pedestrian walk on the pavement people stop when you're cross the road
S0074	mhm
S0018	people stop in their cars and they wave you across and they're smile
S0018	and
S0074	be that the effect of sunshine that's quite nice
S0018	i know
S0074	isn't it really
S0018	people say hello to each other
S0074	mm
S0018	when they walk into shop when it's sunny
S0074	mm
S0018	and everyone's a lot more relax
S0074	much happier yeah they be it's true it's true so yeah so i can understand why yeah but er
S0018	tut yes
S0074	anyway there we be so
S0018	but mhm
S0074	just see
S0018	yeah
S0074	maybe in the future you'll go back do you think
S0018	i doubt it
S0074	don't you think
S0018	unless unless i win the lottery
S0074	tut ah what about that that what's that that guy in er in america be it five hundred million he win
S0018	do he
S0074	five that's just obscene isn't it
S0018	huh that's just too much money i mean
S0074	twenty six million a year he be go to have
S0018	huh blimey but
S0074	twenty six million
S0018	i think i think i'd prefer
S0074	smaller amount over er
S0018	yeah for more people
S0074	yeah quite
S0018	spread the wealth
S0074	mm i think so we could sort out our debt couldn't we
S0018	we could
S0074	or some of our debt with all that sort of
S0018	we could we could oh
S0074	however there we be
S0018	what a shame
S0074	er i i'll never win because i don't do it so there we be but i've get my er premium bond that's about the nearest i shall get to
S0018	i'm always tempt to play the lottery but i always know oh i can't
S0074	what's the point
S0074	waste of money yeah mm
S0018	how much do they do lottery ticket cost
S0074	do you know er i have no idea i think you can get these pound ones can't you where it's like a scratchcard thing
S0018	oh okay er
S0074	but i i've no idea
S0018	no
S0074	er i think i have buy them once and that be when they first come out
S0018	uh huh
S0074	and i've never do it since
S0074	so there we be so i as i say i shall never win shall i because i don't do it they have a syndicate here
S0018	uh huh
S0074	and um i think there be only about two of us who weren't in the syndicate so we keep think er well
S0018	what
S0074	if they win
S0018	what happen if they win
S0018	if they win there'll only be
S0074	two of us to do everything cos they'll be all go bye bye
S0074	but they've they've break the syndicate up now so there we be
S0018	and they never win anything
S0074	they do win
S0018	oh really
S0074	sort of you know small amount
S0018	mhm
S0074	but not a biggy so er so there we be so
S0018	do it kind of pay for itself
S0074	i think so
S0018	with the winnings
S0074	i
S0018	mm
S0074	um because a couple leave er and they have their winnings
S0018	uh huh
S0074	pay for their sort of er monthly payment
S0018	mhm
S0074	over over a period of months
S0018	mhm
S0074	until they actually come back into the country like one guy go to new zealand
S0018	aha
S0074	and he pay up before he go and i think his winnings pay for the time he be in new zealand
S0018	ah
S0074	so that be quite nice wasn't it really so
S0074	so no so
S0018	maybe i should start maybe i should start
S0074	well
S0018	play
S0074	yeah
S0018	you never know you never know
S0074	you never know i suppose
S0074	absolutely yeah so there you go
S0018	or meet a millionaire
S0074	well er yes
S0018	that would be nice
S0018	that would be er
S0074	there's not really many of those around be there well
S0074	there might be yeah
S0018	there might be now people have win so much money on the lottery
S0074	mm that's true
S0074	yeah so there you go
S0074	so and how's the drive lessons go
S0018	oh not too bad it's strange though i feel like i'm in a kind of tut bubble when i'm drive
S0074	oh
S0018	it's like like a parallel reality and it's not really me in in control of the car i like the car's move and it's do what i'm say but i don't know it's really weird
S0074	be it
S0018	yeah
S0074	have you ever drive
S0018	no never
S0074	oh really and er so what's make you now decide do you think
S0018	just have have the time
S0074	aha
S0018	and the inclination
S0074	right
S0018	at the same time
S0074	oh that's good isn't it and er how many lessons have you have
S0018	six so far
S0074	oh that's
S0018	mhm
S0074	yeah so be it go okay
S0018	it's go okay yeah the the i've get a fantastic drive er instructor
S0074	man or lady
S0018	he's a man
S0074	man
S0018	yeah
S0074	okay
S0018	um but he's really he's get a good sense of humour and
S0074	that's nice
S0018	he's very relax
S0074	that's very nice
S0018	and
S0074	huh
S0018	he's all the time feed me instructions
S0074	right
S0018	and manage to carry on quite er a very civilize chat at the same time
S0074	oh okay
S0018	so tut he really i think he that's probably his technique
S0074	yes
S0018	he try to get people think and talk about other things
S0074	yeah
S0018	so that it become
S0074	so you kind of relax
S0018	automatic and er
S0074	yeah that's good
S0018	relax
S0074	that's good and er and have you just drive locally then i guess
S0018	yes
S0074	yes yeah so
S0018	i be up the last week in fourth gear
S0074	ooh
S0018	which i think be quite scary at first but then i think
S0074	huh
S0018	no it's not scary
S0074	i can do this
S0018	it's really easy
S0074	i can do this good for you so
S0018	but i'm just because he be feed me all the instructions all the time i don't know what would happen
S0074	if you be
S0018	how i'd react in a situation that
S0074	yeah
S0018	wasn't so
S0074	on your own mm
S0018	er so predictable i don't know
S0074	and be you er drive with anybody else in between lessons or be you
S0018	no
S0074	no
S0018	i'm not no i er
S0074	huh
S0018	my dad's not that great a teacher
S0074	oh okay
S0018	he tend to be um you know he's he's he try to be but then he end up give instructions that have get nothing to do with the task in hand and
S0074	right
S0018	doesn't make things too clear
S0074	i see and your mum would your mum
S0018	mum would be fantastic
S0074	would she
S0018	but i don't think she's up for it
S0074	no no maybe good cos you might just fall out couldn't you yeah
S0018	but um
S0018	i think it cost quite a lot of money to insure
S0074	insure you as well
S0018	mm
S0074	in fact i be talk to er a girl the other day she's seventeen in september
S0018	mhm
S0074	and er um my er my dad's car be be be sell and i think oh a little corsa that might be quite nice for her
S0018	uh huh
S0074	and er so we we talk about you know be it worth her have it and keep it till september when she'd start to learn to drive and er her insurance be go to be three thousand
S0018	huh
S0074	three hundred pound
S0018	oh
S0074	can you imagine and she's she's get some work she work in a hairdressers
S0018	uh huh
S0074	er and she's go to college in stratford in september
S0018	uh huh
S0074	but er you know if you think like she obviously like her clothe she's only young like her clothe like go to concert and things really she'll have the add responsibility of a pay three thousand three hundred
S0018	fff yeah
S0074	and then have to run a car
S0018	mhm mm
S0074	you know put petrol in and everything so it be a joint decision
S0018	do they do that to tut to kind of put people off
S0074	well
S0018	put youngsters off buy cars
S0074	mhm well by all account have she have be male it would've be even more
S0018	mm
S0074	so they obviously regard young male drivers as more of a risk than female
S0018	right
S0074	which i don't know whether they can do that now cos there be some law wasn't there
S0018	that's right there be mm
S0074	come out about er insurance it's gotta be equal right and all that sort of stuff
S0018	so it's probably go up even more for girls
S0074	quite but er yes three thousand three hundred
S0018	oh that's awful
S0074	and and if her parent have put her on their insurance
S0018	mhm
S0074	i mean they sort of say well really that's just not the way forward because she never go to get her no claim
S0018	right
S0074	and i think er you know insurance company now recognize that that's what people be do
S0018	mhm
S0074	and so i think they're just sort of put
S0018	put an end to it
S0074	mm
S0018	oh
S0074	but i i just think gosh
S0018	that be a lot isn't it
S0074	you know it be a lot
S0018	oop sorry
S0074	yeah so er sorry
S0018	and be it the fact er that she's um
S0074	seventeen and newly
S0018	right
S0074	er she'd be a newly qualify driver
S0018	okay
S0074	well well learn i suppose
S0018	uh huh
S0074	and er yeah i suppose they just think she's a risk
S0018	mhm
S0074	so that's why they and as i say she decide that this wasn't right for her she would leave it you know a little while and
S0018	yeah
S0074	see how it go so that's what she's go to do
S0018	mm
S0074	so
S0018	well i hear that um talk about beat the beat the get round different
S0074	the system
S0018	yeah the system well the insurance system i've hear that a lot of people be use these mobility um
S0074	ah
S0018	tut cart
S0074	oh
S0018	what be they call
S0074	yeah disability cars
S0018	yeah
S0074	be that what yeah
S0018	uh huh
S0074	so and you can get a disability allowance can't you with then get a disability car
S0018	oh can you
S0074	can't you
S0018	well people be just buy these mobility or disability cart and use them to get from a to b
S0074	mm
S0018	because you don't have to pay road tax you don't have to pay
S0074	ah
S0018	petrol you don't have to insure them i don't think you don't need a licence
S0074	oh right
S0018	it's just like have a bike
S0074	yes
S0018	except it's a bike that you can just sit in and
S0018	i think they're electrically
S0074	mm
S0018	power
S0074	oh yes that's it yeah so
S0018	but um
S0074	mm
S0018	no apparently the government and probably spur on by the insurance
S0074	yeah
S0018	tut people and the petrol people say
S0074	mm
S0018	er no make this illegal so that it doesn't become a craze and
S0074	tut
S0018	they're cite reason er we don't want the pavements to get clog up by all these
S0018	things these be only allow to be use by disable people
S0074	people
S0018	which
S0074	i wouldn't have think people would've like that anyway cos um
S0018	mm
S0074	young people it's their street cred isn't it
S0074	wouldn't like that would they i don't think i um tut i have er a relative who's er slightly disable he's get breathe difficulties
S0018	mhm

S0018	oh okay
S0074	yeah i love travel
S0018	uh huh
S0074	i do love travel um tut i suppose my favourite place be sydney i love sydney
S0018	uh huh
S0074	i like the harbour
S0018	oh
S0074	er i like the opera house i like the area round the harbour itself
S0018	mhm
S0074	you know the walk to the garden and er i just think it's a a delightful place i and i really like it
S0018	how often have you be
S0074	i've be i think three time
S0018	mhm
S0074	and so i feel with some authority that i can say
S0074	that it's my favourite place and i would like i would like to go back but it's the it's the journey
S0018	mm
S0074	it's such a long way isn't it but
S0018	which route do you take
S0074	er the er i've never go direct i've always call in at somewhere like hong kong
S0018	mhm
S0074	or one time we go via america we go to
S0018	mm
S0074	los angeles and go that way but er the other two of them
S0018	oh do you break up the journey
S0074	mm
S0018	and stay over in los angeles
S0074	yes yes
S0018	that's a good idea
S0074	yeah
S0018	cos
S0074	yeah
S0018	it be a long long journey
S0074	it be a long journey i i i i mean i don't do business class i'm just economy with my knees under my chin
S0074	and er no i i just and i think as you get older
S0018	yep
S0074	it it and i i do think it's harder but
S0018	mhm
S0074	tut there we be well i i would like to just do it one more time i think so
S0018	yes
S0074	we'll see see if i can persuade other people to do it
S0074	but er cos you've get a reason to go to australia as well
S0018	well kind of although
S0074	mm
S0018	um my brother you mean
S0074	yes
S0018	yeah although when i live in barcelona he never come well he come and visit me once in
S0074	aha
S0018	twelve years
S0074	tut fff
S0018	so tut
S0074	mm
S0018	he be like oh yeah come and visit me in australia i'm think
S0018	it would've be so easy for you to
S0074	mm
S0018	come and
S0074	yes
S0018	pop over and visit me
S0074	yeah
S0018	cos his girlfriend at the time be work at british airways
S0074	ah
S0018	too so he have free flight
S0074	ah right
S0018	and now at the the kind of the idea of me pay him a return visit but all the way
S0074	tut
S0018	over the other side of the world
S0074	yes not that appeal
S0018	and i do it um well i go to melbourne
S0074	be that where your grandmother be be it
S0018	yeah that's right
S0074	oh i think that's right yeah huh
S0018	five years ago six years ago
S0074	oh okay yes
S0018	and that journey just
S0074	yeah
S0018	er oh it be horrible
S0074	mhm
S0018	i take i take two weeks off work to do it
S0074	two weeks
S0018	and yep
S0074	fff that's not long be it
S0018	not enough really
S0074	it isn't no
S0018	and i go um i think it be via dubai
S0074	tut oh okay
S0018	and so the journey be er roughly about thirty hours
S0074	so long
S0018	and when i get there cos i find travel mm tut east no west to east a lot worse than travel um
S0074	the other way
S0018	east to west
S0074	right
S0018	um and so i be basically lose four or five days with
S0074	jet lag
S0018	jet lag but it
S0074	mm
S0018	wasn't just the feel of want to go to bed when everyone else be get up and vice versa it be i felt like all the bone marrow have be drain from my
S0074	oh really
S0018	bone i have no energy i just felt completely wash out
S0074	oh wow
S0018	so by the time i'd er recover it be
S0074	enjoy it and it's time to come back again
S0018	exactly
S0074	mm
S0018	so i just think
S0074	mm
S0018	huh
S0074	no i think if you've get to go that far i think it be about either break the journey up
S0018	mm
S0074	or be able to go business class
S0018	mhm
S0074	and er you know just to
S0018	or concorde
S0074	er er but well yes wouldn't that've be nice and er spend at least i would say three or four weeks don't you
S0018	definitely yeah
S0074	i think so
S0018	how long have you spend in in sydney
S0074	er three weeks i be er er no wait a minute er one time i do do five weeks but that then we go on to to new zealand
S0018	mm
S0074	and er drive right round the islands
S0018	mm
S0074	for er er about two weeks and then come back via sydney so i have a quick fix of er
S0074	sydney on the way back and then we be do bangkok so i yeah i really love travel i just think it's great education
S0018	oh
S0074	and it's just see different countries and
S0074	i just think it's wonderful and i can't get enough of it really i i like to travel
S0018	so what's on the agenda this year
S0074	oh this year well this year
S0018	on the itinerary
S0074	we're go to er we're go to northern cyprus cos my er
S0018	mm
S0074	my brother in law's have er a place out there
S0018	mhm
S0074	so we're go to just spend ten days at the end of may and just er do that so that's quite nice
S0018	mhm
S0074	and then in september october we're go up to er i have relatives up there and we er we we've both er originate from
S0018	uh huh
S0074	and so we er i've never do it
S0018	mhm
S0074	in the time we've be together so we decide this year that we would spend a couple of weeks then
S0018	ah
S0074	and then maybe christmas we'll do something else so so not very far this year but er but
S0018	excite
S0074	yes
S0018	and relax
S0074	i think so i think so i think it's quite
S0018	whereabouts be you go in
S0074	er we go up as far as
S0018	mhm
S0074	er cos that's where my dad be from
S0018	okay
S0074	and er so the idea be to take him he's he's pass away in er february
S0018	oh
S0074	so be gonna take his ash back
S0018	sorry mhm
S0074	and we're go to go onto the estate where his
S0018	oh
S0074	he start his his life his family work on the estate
S0018	uh huh
S0074	so there's a er a loch call
S0018	uh huh
S0074	it's m u i c k i think it's call and er we're go to walk round it which be about seven miles and just find a suitable place to just scatter his ash
S0018	aw
S0074	so that's the plan
S0018	that's a lovely thing to do
S0074	well he he be from there
S0018	mhm
S0074	and he his heart be really always in
S0018	really
S0074	and so i just feel that it would be nice he never er really express a wish to say
S0018	mhm
S0074	that's what he want so i hope it's what he want
S0018	aw
S0074	so there we be so that's the plan so but we're go to go up via the lakes and spend a few days in the lakes just to break the journey up
S0018	oh that sound like a lovely journey
S0074	so yeah i think so it'll be quite nice won't it
S0018	okay
S0074	so er so there we be
S0018	and do he still have family around there
S0074	yes
S0074	my aunt be in er which be near
S0018	mhm
S0074	and then i have cousins who live in which be about an hour from aberdeen
S0018	mhm
S0074	so it's you know sort of all on that east coast
S0018	right
S0074	and er it's very beautiful
S0018	have you er
S0074	i think er yeah it'll be nice round there so
S0018	cool be you go to visit them too
S0074	yeah probably
S0074	in fact er we'll probably sort of invite them and all have a bite of a gather
S0018	yeah
S0074	and er and then probably have afternoon tea after we've sort of do what we've get to do
S0074	so it'll be quite nice to catch up with everybody then
S0018	lovely
S0074	so um so yeah so er my husband er er doesn't really understand the scottish twang very well
S0074	and they're really quite broad so he'll probably be nod er at time and er nod the other way other time and hope that he's do the right thing
S0074	in term of er understand what they're say so
S0018	they don't
S0074	so yeah
S0018	don't come with subtitle
S0074	no no
S0018	be there an app on your mobile phone for that
S0074	i don't think there be actually yeah no that's right so
S0018	and have you
S0018	ever trace your ancestry
S0074	no i haven't actually
S0018	no
S0074	no i've i've be quite satisfy i suppose with the fact that um er my dad's family be all from
S0018	uh huh
S0074	my mum's family be from
S0018	mhm
S0074	and er although i know as far as my great grandfather our gr grandparents should i say i've never get any further and i think it might be something to do in the future it might
S0018	yeah
S0074	might be quite interest won't it
S0018	yeah
S0074	have you ever do it
S0018	no
S0074	oh okay
S0018	me personally no but
S0074	no
S0018	there be a there be a time when mum and dad be
S0074	do they
S0018	look into i think my grandma's
S0074	aha
S0018	family on my dad's side
S0074	oh right
S0018	and they travel up to
S0074	oh do they
S0018	to look at some registry or
S0074	oh okay
S0018	i can't remember what it be but
S0074	oh
S0018	no they find out some quite interest
S0074	i bet
S0018	things
S0074	and the advantage be you've still get your grandmas haven't you so you can ask them a lot of question
S0018	ah yeah aha
S0074	although i know your one be in australia
S0018	uh huh
S0074	but i guess you speak to her do you skype her or
S0018	oh no she's
S0074	no no
S0018	she's quite um she's quite modern
S0074	be she
S0018	she do
S0074	be she
S0018	she do er travel on one of those little scooter things
S0074	oh do she
S0018	you know that the kid have
S0074	oh great
S0018	around the old people's home but no she doesn't
S0074	she doesn't sort of
S0018	do technology
S0074	oh okay
S0018	bless her
S0074	so so yeah that might be quite nice in the future maybe to just
S0018	yeah
S0074	sort of ask the question cos i sort of feel that we don't do we we don't ask question
S0018	mm
S0074	about our our sort of relatives and
S0018	mhm
S0074	we take things for grant and er er you know like you know you look at old photograph don't you and you sort of think well who be that and
S0018	yeah definitely
S0074	how be they relate and what you know how do they fit into the family
S0074	and i think it it'd be quite nice to know wouldn't it really so
S0018	definitely and mum's get
S0074	yeah
S0018	a family bible that's be hand down
S0074	tut oh tut
S0018	from generation to generation
S0074	yeah
S0018	and i think it be her great great great grandmother
S0074	oh gosh
S0018	who start the tradition of actually write in
S0074	oh really
S0018	the name of all the children in the family and then
S0074	ah
S0018	that be pass down to the next generation who then they write in the name of
S0074	how nice
S0018	so yes
S0074	oh that's lovely
S0018	yeah
S0074	isn't it
S0018	isn't it such a little
S0074	so it's a good record isn't it
S0018	yeah well
S0074	yeah
S0018	not so much yeah um tut not so much so that you'd know anything about these people but just be able to look
S0074	but who their their name be
S0018	yeah
S0074	yeah that's
S0018	mm
S0074	a good start isn't it
S0018	mm
S0074	because otherwise it i think er er there's a programme you perhaps didn't see it when you if you be in spain but there be um a programme who do you think you be
S0018	mm
S0074	i think it be call and it
S0074	again it be trace back
S0074	yeah it be trace back
S0018	amaze
S0074	but they have um
S0074	real personalities
S0018	uh huh
S0074	you know er like actors and actresses
S0018	uh huh
S0074	and um tut er poets and broadcasters and all sort of
S0018	uh huh
S0074	you know fairly well know people and some of them be absolutely fascinate
S0018	really
S0074	they take them all round the world
S0018	uh huh
S0074	and er you know find out stuff er bad things about some of them
S0018	really
S0074	er but just really interest things
S0018	mhm
S0074	er the vast majority of the time and er the they they'd start off talk to like their parent or a relative
S0018	mhm mm
S0074	and they they'd bring out photograph and a little bite about themselves
S0018	uh huh
S0074	which be really quite narrow and they would say just as we've be say well i don't really know very much about er whoever and er and then they'd go off and they'd trace them and find out all sort of stuff
S0018	mhm
S0074	from the record you know er like army record or sometimes prison record or all that sort of thing and then of course they'd come back and they'd share it with the relative
S0018	uh huh
S0074	like start off and it be really
S0074	really good yeah no it be it be one of those program that you kind of er get hook on
S0018	mm
S0074	because it be it be
S0018	mm
S0074	just so very interest
S0018	it sound it
S0074	yeah it be
S0018	sound very interest
S0074	yeah it be good
S0018	it's just get a cheesy name
S0074	yeah but no they do it
S0074	er like er i think the last series be about mm maybe six months ago i guess
S0018	mhm
S0074	something like that and and so every year they tend to choose about four or five people
S0018	mhm
S0074	and then they do this series of program
S0018	okay
S0074	which be er so tut i'd recommend it
S0018	can you can you remember any of the celebrities that have find out
S0074	er
S0018	bad things
S0074	er bad things now let me think i dunno whether it be richard madeley er he be er um i think he's er a broadcaster er and i think he find out um stuff about his ancestors
S0018	mhm
S0074	that they'd you know sort of be on on the edge of some naughty things
S0074	and then there be some others who be er they i mean they could trace it back to er royalty
S0018	mm
S0074	some some find
S0018	oh wow
S0074	er so er again you know really really interest
S0018	mm
S0074	stuff but er i can't remember specifically about any of the others er about sort of you know about things that they find out
S0074	but it yeah just it be sort of good tv really you know
S0018	very interest
S0018	they have websites to do that as well nowadays
S0074	yes
S0018	don't they
S0074	but they do yes people do spend quite a lot of time and and they can sometimes they can go physically can't they er down to the record office
S0018	mm
S0074	swiss er
S0018	mm
S0074	house isn't it but er but er i i think er the websites i think you could go so far on them and then you end up pay
S0018	mhm
S0074	and so i think yeah just depend how deep you want to go
S0018	mm yeah
S0074	um out of interest but
S0018	yeah
S0074	something for the future maybe
S0018	definitely
S0074	mm
S0018	well i think my parent also find out from my mum's side that one of her great great uncles be the first man to visit the tonga islands
S0074	oh i say
S0018	as a missionary and not get eat by the natives
S0074	that's good er
S0074	fancy that
S0018	claim to fame
S0074	fancy that tonga where's the tonga islands
S0018	where be they i think they're south pacific
S0074	oh okay
S0018	maybe
S0074	oh okay
S0018	somewhere around there
S0074	mm gosh
S0018	i think maybe when the brits be go out to
S0074	yeah
S0018	civilize the barbarians
S0074	yes
S0018	what they perceive as
S0074	tut
S0018	barbarians and
S0074	mm yeah fancy that
S0018	and get eat for their trouble
S0074	yeah gosh fancy yeah so there we be tut good stuff
S0074	yeah so so er er what kind of stuff be you be you do with your spare time be you er
S0018	well learn how to drive
S0074	uh huh of course
S0018	i've get this project on the go
S0074	mm
S0018	which um i've get quite a lot of paperwork to fill in for it
S0074	right
S0018	and
S0074	and er be so who's er collate all of the information
S0018	it's er a cambridge
S0074	oh okay
S0018	university press a department
S0074	oh right
S0018	within cambridge university press
S0074	oh right
S0018	call the speak british speak corpus
S0074	oh right oh
S0018	or the cambridge corpus yes
S0074	so how do you get involve with that then
S0018	oh i just saw er an advert online
S0074	oh
S0018	cos i be i'm do
S0074	look for work mhm
S0018	that's another one of my job at the moment be
S0074	oh i see
S0018	look for a job
S0074	be you be you not go to er carry on with the teach or er
S0018	um
S0074	be that something you're go to do again in the future maybe
S0018	that's something that i hope i don't have to do
S0074	oh
S0018	it's there as a fallback
S0074	okay
S0018	plan
S0074	right
S0018	but um tut i don't know i think maybe have i get into it younger
S0074	right
S0018	when i think maybe when you're young you're more flexible and you're more likely to accept completely illogical irrational ways of work
S0074	right right
S0018	that um maybe at you're at a disadvantage when you've already get the experience of work in a very productive way and then
S0074	mm
S0018	you're throw into an environment that be
S0074	tick the box that sort of thing
S0018	yes yeah
S0074	very
S0018	yeah
S0074	very performance drive and
S0018	target drive
S0074	yes
S0018	and not
S0074	yeah
S0018	achievement drive
S0074	tut
S0018	and
S0074	yeah so
S0018	the the different layer of the society inside the school don't you know they kind of chafe against each other they don't facilitate
S0074	right
S0018	overall
S0074	right what sort of age group be you teach
S0018	they're secondary
S0074	oh right so quite tough
S0018	yes
S0074	mm
S0018	yes
S0074	quite challenge i imagine
S0018	very challenge and
S0074	mm
S0018	yep
S0074	do you not fancy do primary school at all
S0018	um tut er er what you see what i think now i've narrow down my passion to be the the english language
S0074	right
S0018	um
S0074	yeah
S0018	i love teach english um as a foreign language
S0074	yes
S0018	scusey get a frog in my throat but um when tut when i be make the decision whether to become a primary teacher or a secondary teacher whether to study to do the pgce um i decide that i'd go for secondary because i've have experience of all age and level of kid
S0074	mhm
S0018	and um you know i've obviously there be tut pros and con for any age group
S0074	yes
S0018	or any
S0074	sure
S0018	and i choose secondary because i could specialize in teach languages which be where i think my passion
S0074	forte be
S0018	yeah lie
S0074	mm
S0018	and my forte yeah but in the end i realize that it's no it's the english language and the idea of
S0074	mm
S0018	pick it apart and
S0074	yes
S0018	put it back together and help other people pick it apart and put it back together and
S0074	right
S0018	yes it's so that's why i choose secondary
S0074	right
S0018	for the languages but no french and spanish i mean i speak them fluently and i love the culture it's one thing to love the culture and the language
S0074	yeah
S0018	to then try and teach it to a class full of people who don't wanna be there
S0074	absolutely
S0018	see no motivation whatsoever for learn a language it's it's kind of
S0074	fff quite tough
S0018	soul destroy really
S0074	mm
S0018	um you know cos i be so passionate about
S0074	yes yes
S0018	languages not only as er a vehicle for express yourself but you know just to er as a way to open your mind up to different culture and ways of do things
S0074	absolutely
S0018	and um or or mm in my experience as a teacher of adults and children tut i've always manage to convey that to them or they've all
S0074	enthusiasm
S0018	yeah
S0074	mm
S0018	or or they've be able to convey that to me because they be enthusiastic
S0074	yes
S0018	to some extent about it obviously i tut always have the random students who'd you know be just didn't
S0074	disruptive
S0018	wanna get involve
S0074	yeah
S0018	and be disruptive and but you can handle that if there's
S0074	yeah sure
S0018	two or three in a class of twenty but when there's twenty in a class of thirty four
S0074	who don't want to play
S0018	you can't
S0074	pff
S0018	i mean there's no way that you can teach
S0074	mm mm tut
S0018	when you've get twenty disruptive students
S0074	pff no
S0018	and such a large class of students and so many target to meet and er not the
S0074	mm
S0018	raw materials with which to tut get them there with
S0074	yes it's fff really tough
S0018	really really tough
S0074	mm
S0018	i mean er fff you imagine things like bring a pen to school would be something that's deal with top down and from all directions
S0074	absolutely
S0018	er and yet no it wasn't
S0074	no pen
S0018	no no pen the uniform check things like that you know if you're gonna have a uniform enforce it to be wear
S0074	absolutely
S0018	properly
S0074	yes quite
S0018	er if not just don't have a uniform
S0074	yes
S0018	but don't er enforce a uniform policy but then don't enforce it and let
S0074	yeah
S0018	everybody believe that oh well it's there but we don't have to respect it so
S0074	tut
S0018	we're just not gonna respect anything include not bring a pen
S0074	tut
S0018	to school so you know you lose the first fifteen minutes
S0074	yeah tut basic stuff isn't it really
S0018	exactly yeah
S0074	if you if you haven't get that sort of
S0018	mhm
S0074	er discipline and uniformity then you be er with an uphill struggle aren't you i would say
S0018	exactly
S0074	and i i i think the successful school that you hear about in the news i i mean i i just do a bite of voluntary work in school but i
S0018	really
S0074	i i i just feel that
S0018	mhm
S0074	you know you hear about successful school i mean it be it's about the leadership isn't it
S0018	mm
S0074	and i think it be things like
S0018	mhm
S0074	the way you present yourself if you do look the part
S0018	mhm
S0074	and i think then you be er er have a successful lesson
S0018	mm
S0074	aren't you
S0018	mm
S0074	because you've you start off in the right frame of mind
S0018	yeah
S0074	and er and as you say basic things like you know your materials your your pen
S0018	mm
S0074	your paper your your book and
S0018	mhm
S0074	you know phone off and i i just
S0018	yep
S0074	sometimes i like i'm walk down here and i see er you know girls go to school and they've get so much make up on and jewellery and
S0018	mhm
S0074	and er you know skirt er i i mean er that make me sound about ninety but i'm not for the
S0074	record for the tape i'm not
S0074	but er i just er
S0018	skirt as short as belt yes
S0074	just er i just don't think it's the way forward
S0018	no not at all and
S0074	no tut fff
S0018	oh
S0074	mm
S0018	and they er the whole attitude well at least in the school that i saw be that we're here for a social experience
S0074	mm
S0018	we're here to enjoy each other's company and we're here to gossip about what people have write on facebook and oh what do you mean can i have a look at exercise three no i'm talk about what she do at the weekend do you mind
S0074	huh
S0018	it's like that just encourage you know not enforce any rule and
S0018	let them go in look like
S0074	mm go for a night out
S0018	yeah
S0074	never mind go to to school
S0018	no
S0074	to learn
S0018	exactly that's that's what the thing be though
S0074	no it's not good be it
S0018	and er obviously if you're a primary teacher you can control your own rule on a daily basis
S0074	yes
S0018	but when you're a secondary teacher and these kid be go to about eight you know
S0074	mm
S0018	six seven different lessons every day with different people
S0074	tut
S0018	if that's not maintain
S0074	different standards
S0018	yeah
S0074	as well
S0018	if that's not maintain
S0074	tut yeah
S0018	across all those six then
S0074	yeah
S0018	that can be really detrimental to their
S0074	absolutely very very hard
S0018	mm
S0074	i i fff i i i can understand where you're come from
S0018	mm
S0074	for sure i just think it be very very hard i mean i as i say i just do a little bite with er seven year olds
S0018	mm really
S0074	and um tut er you know the
S0018	be it a local school
S0074	yes in er in hampton
S0018	okay
S0074	and er i just do an afternoon and i just really you know do a little bite of read or
S0018	uh huh
S0074	help out with science or whatever they're do really i
S0018	oh super
S0074	whatever and you know sometimes there be some in those class that be really quite disruptive
S0018	mhm
S0074	and i suppose the advantage of have er another person in the class be that you can perhaps work with those disruptive ones
S0018	yep
S0074	so that the rest of the class can get on with the business
S0018	yeah
S0074	and they be fairly receptive okay if they're not then as you say you've get a fallback in as much as they can go and see the head or the deputy or whatever or they lose some of their playtime whatever
S0018	mm
S0074	but i think with older ones it's real hard isn't it
S0018	it be yeah
S0074	to enforce and er huh i just think it's in some ways unless you have get it from the very top and it it
S0018	mhm
S0074	it it's feed down and everybody's sing from the same hymn sheet
S0018	yeah definitely
S0074	it's really really tough isn't it
S0018	and i think school need to be a bite smaller as well
S0074	tut yeah
S0018	to make them feel that everybody know them
S0074	that's right
S0018	that they be treat as an individual
S0074	yes
S0018	as oppose to you boy in the corridor and
S0074	yeah er yeah yeah yeah i think that's
S0018	mm
S0074	absolutely right somebody care
S0018	er class size need to be a bite smaller
S0074	yeah
S0018	and i think yeah no i think it need to be all overhaul from
S0074	the whole thing
S0018	yep
S0074	yeah
S0018	the whole system
S0074	i mean they do keep tweak it but it's er it's
S0018	mm
S0074	er they do say about class size don't they
S0018	mm
S0074	that they shouldn't be over thirty be it
S0018	but they get they're only go to get bigger now
S0074	i think so because we be have more children aren't we
S0018	yep
S0074	and
S0018	yep
S0074	er i mean er huh it i just don't know how it's gonna resolve itself i er it's
S0018	mm
S0074	quite concern really isn't it
S0018	it be especially now the government's turn education
S0074	mm
S0018	basically they've
S0018	basically privatize it
S0074	that's it yep yeah and er and of course there be that theory that you know like academies that that you know they're they're pay more aren't they
S0018	mm
S0074	if they er be an academy and i suppose that's an incentive for people to go into those sort of environments
S0018	yes
S0074	and be they the right people
S0018	well er yes
S0074	mm
S0018	tut i don't know i can see how maybe initially there might be er a drive for quality and standards er
S0074	mm
S0018	but it's gonna depend on the personalities of the senior leaders
S0074	tut yes yeah
S0018	as you say er you know if they're go into it for profit you should be question their motives to go for go into it
S0074	huh
S0018	but also it's go to be even more target drive and
S0074	yes
S0018	achievement lead it's
S0074	because it's about league table isn't it
S0018	yeah
S0074	really um
S0018	and i er what i saw i saw fiddle go on
S0074	mm
S0018	just so that they could make their target
S0074	yeah
S0018	um tut i think in in a situation where er it's gonna get more fierce in that they're not gonna get their fund unless they do meet those target
S0074	mm
S0018	what's gonna happen well you're gonna see a lot of good result but what be actually the reality behind the
S0074	exactly
S0018	educational experience
S0074	yeah yeah er
S0018	and then you've get the worry of okay well you know parent who can afford to get their kid into certain school
S0074	mm
S0018	tut will you know huh
S0074	tut yeah
S0018	parent who don't really care about their kid or don't invest time
S0074	no
S0018	and preparation in their
S0074	well you you do
S0018	it's just
S0074	er you see it don't you um and hear about some children i mean they don't er can't even read and write
S0018	yeah
S0074	can they
S0018	that's just
S0074	never mind the other basic skills
S0018	yeah
S0074	that be need in life and i just yeah find it
S0018	mm
S0074	really quite sad isn't it
S0018	it be
S0074	mm
S0018	it's horrendous
S0074	cos er some of our customers be a bite like that and
S0018	mhm
S0074	you know you er kind of take it all for grant don't you
S0018	tut
S0074	the read aspect of it and you know like we
S0018	definitely
S0074	have to take an oath and i've i've have situations where people really struggle so i you change your work practice
S0018	mhm
S0074	so that you actually do read it out and and they follow you
S0018	right
S0074	er and it's interest just how many
S0074	you know really just can't manage it so
S0018	gosh
S0074	that's just another example of you know your own experience of of
S0018	mhm
S0074	how people just aren't able to
S0018	yeah
S0074	deal with the basic stuff
S0018	and if these people be have children that
S0074	well absolutely er
S0018	be now populate the school how
S0074	and if er they can't help them can they with homework
S0018	no
S0074	or encourage them in any way if they don't know how to do it themselves
S0018	and how can a teacher who's get thirty kid er plus
S0074	exactly
S0018	under their
S0074	start to to try and do those
S0018	yep
S0074	because er as you say er a teach assistant cost a lot
S0018	mm
S0074	er or you know special need er again they're have to look at that aren't they because
S0018	mm
S0074	it's all er cost isn't it
S0018	mhm
S0074	so yeah i er i i just don't know i i don't agree with this performance culture in
S0018	mm
S0074	in er in er in the the health or in the police or in court or
S0018	yeah
S0074	school at all
S0018	no
S0074	because i i do think as you rightly say that the it's manipulate isn't it
S0018	yep
S0074	to accommodate er the finance of it if you like
S0018	yeah and it give a very small spectrum
S0074	mm
S0018	of what people can achieve you know of what type of things people can achieve
S0074	that's right
S0018	because for some kid you know they're not academically mind
S0074	no
S0018	that doesn't necessarily mean that they won't just won't be as successful in life
S0074	and thrive in another way
S0018	yeah
S0074	cos they're perhaps practical aren't they
S0018	exactly
S0074	and i and i think before we be in this er culture of performance that that be identify more wasn't it
S0018	mm
S0074	you know and and that that er you be able to encourage somebody in a in a a practical way if you know if they be good at carpentry or
S0018	yeah
S0074	you know garden or whatever
S0018	definitely
S0074	it might be um and that er or pe er actually
S0018	mm
S0074	you know i mean there be there be some people who be not academic but they're really good sport people and i think you need to encourage and and really sort of embrace those sort of
S0018	definitely
S0074	people don't you
S0018	and maybe even give them an avenue to develop that from
S0074	mm
S0018	a very early age
S0074	absolutely
S0018	as oppose to force people to go to school at the age of eleven and study things that their brain
S0074	doesn't
S0018	really aren't
S0074	no
S0018	tut you know
S0074	be cater for
S0018	yeah that they can't get grasp
S0074	mm
S0018	um tut you know by by the age of twelve you've lose them
S0074	that's right
S0018	and they've become disruptive and
S0074	yeah
S0018	however if you get them into something or get them try a lot of different things
S0074	that's right then they're much better people aren't they
S0018	yeah
S0074	round aren't they
S0018	yeah
S0074	much more round i think but yeah it's er
S0074	anyway there we be
S0074	maybe you'll you'll look at something like that in the future and try and embrace it
S0018	maybe
S0074	have you have you be approach to do er one to one er sort of train with anybody you know sort of somebody who's do their a level o level and er
S0018	oh coach and
S0074	yes
S0018	tutor
S0074	yeah
S0018	things um er yes i've hear a few neighbour um
S0074	uh huh

S0074	do we really want to
S0018	the course be so um it be four and a half months of of non stop and i mean i didn't stop at the weekend
S0074	right
S0018	even it be non stop er full on intense stress and hostility and i kind of want to use this year to give the teach a bite of a break and
S0074	yes just look at something else
S0018	look look for other things
S0074	yeah
S0018	to get experience in other things
S0074	yeah
S0018	and um
S0074	so have you get ideas at all

S0018	really
S0074	and er well
S0018	where where would you move to
S0074	well we we'd probably sort of stratford and down towards
S0018	okay
S0074	sort of the cotswolds that would be very nice
S0018	mhm mhm
S0074	but of course it's very desirable and
S0018	yes
S0074	quite expensive
S0074	so i don't know i er i really don't know we be just you know think about it at the moment
S0018	mhm
S0074	so yeah er hampton er we've get hs2 you know the rail link this fast rail link

S0018	oh
S0074	from our house

S0074	which be not good and then they're talk about build a hundred and ten house on the field behind us
S0018	oh
S0074	in the next five years
S0018	crikey
S0074	so it's not very good be it really
S0018	oh
S0074	tut so
S0018	that kind of change somewhat
S0074	yes it do so er
S0018	the whole fabric of the
S0074	the village really
S0018	the town yeah village
S0074	so i think er huh i don't know it's perhaps not a good time because the value of the property probably isn't
S0018	mm
S0074	go to be good but we think we'd just see see what's about so we'll just see we'll see
S0018	where do your husband work
S0074	er he er have retire he retire in
S0018	oh
S0074	in december
S0018	lucky him
S0074	and he work for the criminal case review commission he be look at allege miscarriages of justice
S0018	okay
S0074	tut er so he'd do that for fourteen years have
S0018	mm
S0074	sort of retire from the police service before that
S0018	okay
S0074	so yeah still very much law so
S0018	interest
S0074	we can't get away from it can we
S0018	do you meet him here
S0074	no i meet him in hong kong
S0018	oh wow
S0074	meet him in hong kong i go
S0018	what be you do over there
S0074	i go to visit some friends who be work over there
S0018	uh huh
S0074	and er as a blind date
S0018	ah
S0074	tut so there you be
S0018	fantastic
S0074	so yeah so yeah and you know we er i mean he be in the police service in actually
S0018	uh huh
S0074	and er and i be here and so we decide to stay here cos i'd get a just a short time before i could retire
S0018	mhm
S0074	so i think perhaps it would be good to finish off my service so i could get my pension which
S0018	uh huh
S0074	these days be good be a good thing
S0018	mm
S0074	cos there's not much about and then we'd just let him do his part time job for a while fourteen years later
S0018	uh huh
S0074	he eventually finish
S0074	and er so yeah so we'll just see what happen after that so
S0018	excellent
S0074	that's the plan
S0018	and be he er a lad of leisure at the moment
S0074	he he be but he's he's be busy himself he's get a motorbike so he like to go out on his motorbike and
S0074	he's er he's get lot of sort of bits of diy that he's be do and so yeah yes that sort of thing but he er i think he really miss work
S0018	really yeah it's
S0074	tut i think he er if you've
S0018	it's a big adjustment
S0074	always work
S0018	isn't it
S0074	yeah i think if you've always work
S0018	especially if it's a job that you've be really passionate about and
S0074	he really enjoy it mm er i think he he he miss the people but miss the the work and it be
S0018	mm
S0074	quite sort of intense stuff
S0018	mhm
S0074	and he's still very interest you know whenever something come on the the tv or the radio he's you know he's there listen
S0018	tut aw
S0074	and can relate to who's deal with that particular matter and so er i think he you know out of choice he probably wouldn't have go but he just think that er the time be
S0018	mhm
S0074	right and so you have to
S0018	can he do consult on a very
S0074	um i suppose if he want to he's he's think about stuff
S0018	mhm
S0074	but hasn't actually take the next step he's look at some voluntary work for the national trust
S0018	tut oh okay
S0074	i mean he er go to baddesley clinton
S0018	ooh i love that place
S0074	and look at there and er and there be he say there be lot of ladies he say of a certain age he say and i think i can't do this i can't sit here with all these ladies
S0074	talk about their knit and what have you so he didn't didn't do that so
S0018	oh
S0074	so whether he he will
S0018	but could he consult for the police or the
S0074	um er i suppose he could but er i i don't know i don't think he would er
S0018	mm
S0074	he would go down that road but i think he's just quite open really
S0018	private eye
S0074	tut well
S0018	detective
