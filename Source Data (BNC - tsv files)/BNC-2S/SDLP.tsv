S0329	so what be that
S0326	there's a whole thing about like loeb shame
S0326	er they be kinda depress there's something about them but at the same time that's probably one of the most the amount of sort of the amount of place where you will will find a like an a complete loeb classical library sort of every library have it every classical library have it every classicist have one of their own you know
