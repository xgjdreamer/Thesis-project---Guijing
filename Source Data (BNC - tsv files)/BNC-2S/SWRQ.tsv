S0320	i take to go and play in the park
S0443	oh right be he go on the swing yet
S0320	nope still doesn't like them
S0443	ah perhaps they make him feel a bite like sick like a bite of vertigo
S0320	i don't think so he doesn't generally like swing he like climb
S0443	oh right so what do he climb on
S0320	the slide the everything really
S0443	have they get a climb frame there
S0320	mm not really they've kind of get erm like no erm more climb wall type thing so sort of round slop with erm climb wall hold bolt on to them
S0443	that's a bite sophisticate down at erm
S0320	yes it be
S0443	yeah
S0320	it's not as sophisticate as i'm explain it it's not as complicate as i'm make it sound
S0443	have they get like a cargo rope that you climb up
S0320	er what like a spider web one
S0443	yeah
S0320	yes
S0443	oh right
S0320	but he's too little for that
S0443	that's quite yeah that be quite high down at erm park they've get like a wooden frame one which be really solid it's go very high so it's about
S0320	yeah
S0443	twelve feet high
S0320	yeah
S0443	or ten feet high
S0320	yeah
S0443	but there's definitely a climb frame
S0320	yeah by the swim pool
S0443	yeah by the paddle the paddle pool
S0320	yeah yeah
S0443	i can't wait to take him bouldering
S0320	mm you
S0443	yeah why not
S0320	oh don't i don't know i think will probably take him
S0443	no you'll have to wait forever i think will probably take him
S0320	i'm go to take him to the erm play group in the climb wall when it's when it's rain so probably next week
S0443	which climb wall
S0320	maybe this week
S0443	at
S0320	no it's in erm
S0443	yeah that's the one i'm think of
S0320	it's a bouldering wall
S0443	yeah
S0320	yes
S0443	that's the one i'm talk about
S0320	yeah i think it's i think it's tuesday wednesday thursday i can't remember i have to check the days
S0443	yeah
S0320	so i think i'm go to take him there
S0443	oh right you might have a go a climb yourself
S0320	it's bouldering so probably not it mean you just have to get across and it's really hard rather than up
S0443	what like for an eighteen month old can do it but you can't
S0320	they have soft play stuff for them and it doesn't necessarily mean they have to climb up the wall
S0443	it sound like a good good chance for you to to have a go
S0320	i probably won't
S0443	oh
S0320	i'll just take
S0443	oh it's cold today there be nearly all frost this morning
S0320	i know i know
S0443	go round say he's cold he's hold he's cold i'm go to tomorrow so i can get some woolly sock
S0320	where be you go to get your woolly sock from
S0443	i don't know a woolly sock shop there be so many outdoor shop in
S0320	mm
S0443	but i won't be able to wear them with my shoe
S0320	shoe what those
S0443	yeah my new gore tex trainers
S0320	be erm or 's one of 's rucksacks arrive in the post today
S0443	one how many have he get
S0320	erm oh yeah maybe it's only one 's rucksack arrive in the post this morning
S0443	oh right be it a full on outdoor one or just a little one
S0320	yeah say it's it's quite small it's sort of in between they don't seem to like to carry much erm so it's bigger than a day pack but not a big backpack
S0443	oh right
S0320	for travel
S0443	so not like the marines
S0320	say it's better than his well they're both really small
S0443	yeah
S0320	so they've both get fairly small and i don't think they carry much or take much
S0443	oh okay just a lot of chocolate
S0320	maybe i don't know i think have to take like hammer and stuff so he can hammer rock
S0443	i think he be do mechanical engineer
S0320	i think he's go something to do with geology actually
S0443	that's a bite different
S0320	it's to do it's also engineer as well it might be geological engineer
S0443	ah sound a bite odd that's all computerise now cos your cousin do it and earn a fortune work in with his master's in geology
S0320	maybe not maybe that's what he want to do next i'm not sure i can't remember he do tell me but i can't remember
S0443	cos it it's mostly computer generate graphics to to interpret it to find out where the oil be
S0320	mm
S0443	nothing to do with bits and hammer
S0320	well then maybe he's do something different i don't know
S0443	mm oh right what else be you get for him
S0320	i dunno be do it trousers boot all sort mostly shoe i think for outdoor shoe for all of them
S0443	that's really funny cos you know get a new pair of shoe
S0320	mm
S0443	and it be only last minute he find out they be make from yak skin
S0320	yes
S0443	which be hilarious
S0320	mm
S0443	so they're obviously from actually they're probably from what be now china so it would have be tibet mongolia
S0320	yeah
S0443	that kind of region you get the yak
S0320	yeah
S0443	but also we're have a lecture about the last in the shoe
S0320	oh
S0443	the last be the bite that give the support to the archway way through
S0320	oh okay
S0443	and one of them have a last that be a triple last split in three and the other be a steel which be plastic and the other have a a single steel last that go through the shoe
S0320	in the shoe
S0443	yeah every shoe have a last
S0320	make of steel
S0443	or be make of a last yeah they're very expensive
S0320	i don't think every shoe have them the shoe i have get haven't get any of that
S0443	well they're not shoe they're just slippers
S0320	no yeah
S0443	when i try on my new shoe i want to throw my old shoe away cos there be just no support in them whatsoever
S0443	but i didn't
S0320	no i wear my walk boot quite a lot they're very good
S0443	oh they'll be handy for when you go to and 's wed

S0320	i must find some no i be think wellies or flip flop i must find some wellies not you can't have walk boot with a dress don't be silly
S0443	yeah
S0320	i still need to find some wellies i try some on in mountain warehouse and they're horrible
S0443	yeah everything in mountain warehouse be horrible i don't know how they exist
S0320	something's
S0443	go outdoors in the place
S0320	get his waterproof suit from mountain warehouse which be nice
S0443	oh yeah they're nice for kiddies but not for adults go outdoors be the place for wellies
S0320	right
S0443	they have cath kidston look alikes i don't think they've get hunter's they haven't get top of the range
S0320	oh hunter's don't fit me anyway
S0443	hunter's be just so faffy it's what every posh person wear to a festival
S0320	yes they do and in cities
S0443	well doesn't rain that much in cities
S0320	no i suppose not
S0443	mm
S0320	be that the plan for the wed then
S0443	yeah shall i tell you about it
S0320	yeah
S0443	what's happen there
S0320	yeah
S0443	as much as i can remember anyway so it's a nine acre site
S0320	be it
S0443	yeah
S0320	what's the equivalent to then
S0443	in west wales
S0320	nine acres
S0443	don't know
S0320	how big be your field down there
S0443	er that's three acres i think
S0320	oh okay
S0443	erm i don't know how many tennis court you can get in an acre
S0320	how many what
S0443	tennis court
S0320	i can work with acre
S0443	or football
S0320	i
S0443	how many football pitch can you get in an acre
S0320	i don't know no idea
S0443	there's probably two football pitch to an acre so this be nine acres so it's pretty huge it's massive
S0320	mm
S0443	and it's in west wales which be an interest location cos you get the coast on one side and then there's this long flat plane and then you've get the and the mountains in the distance which be go to so it's a bite of a rain belt i think
S0320	no really
S0443	mm cos when we get there it be absolutely pour from rain and you could see the weather clear from the mountain so it's in between the mountains and the coast
S0320	oh dear
S0443	yeah yeah so it's very wet
S0320	oh
S0443	and it have a lake go through the middle of it
S0320	yeah
S0443	erm and the chap that own the land be tell me it's actually quite an ancient thing they use to use it as a waterway and then further up here
S0320	do they before it be a lake then
S0443	before it be private land further up here they've get otters
S0320	okay
S0443	not not on their land but it's the same amount of water
S0320	but it's a lake it's a lake not a river then
S0443	i can't remember mm it's now a lake
S0320	so how do they use it as a waterway
S0443	yeah it use to be it use to go all the way down to the coast obviously from the mountains to the coast
S0320	oh okay
S0443	i think i can't remember a lot about about it but all i've get this aerial view you know a sort of google birth map erm so the site's right next to the main road
S0320	mm
S0443	which have get a fifty mile an hour limit
S0320	have it
S0443	yeah
S0320	oh dear
S0443	and then there's just this really small turn in there erm and there's only park for ten cars maximum
S0320	mm yeah okay
S0443	so we're go to get everyone to park in which be at the coast
S0320	mm oh okay
S0443	and it's free park
S0320	be it
S0443	we don't have any free park in yeah so we do a recce of the car park so we go and have a look at all the car park around and it's right by the co op so i reckon people will buy beer
S0443	at the co op
S0320	yeah they might run out
S0443	well i doubt it but erm so there isn't park on site so that's a bite of a disadvantage so we might there'll be local taxi drivers or a shuttle bus possibly i don't know i think it'll be local taxi drivers do it
S0320	okay it's not a work farm then
S0443	it's not a farm at all
S0320	not a farm at all look a bite like a farm
S0443	no no no no animals
S0320	mm mm
S0443	a couple of swan on the lake
S0320	mm
S0443	who be quite territorial if you go over their bridge they're not so keen on it all
S0320	mm
S0443	so it's sandwich between the road and then you've get field and then you've get the lake and then you've get the far side which won't be use
S0320	okay
S0443	so i think it's about that far side be about four and a half acres so this be about four and a half acres
S0320	mm
S0443	so there it be
S0320	okay and where be they go to do the ceremony
S0443	erm here
S0320	by the house
S0443	yeah
S0320	okay and so what's the blue field for
S0443	chill out zone
S0320	and the red field
S0443	er marquee
S0320	okay why be it why why be the blue field a chill out zone in between the ceremony and the marquee
S0443	why not
S0320	what's go to happen in there then
S0443	everyone's go to chill out
S0320	we might not need to chill out
S0443	it's a wed of course you need to chill chill out yeah now see what the red field's for
S0320	i do i say what be the red field for
S0443	no this one
S0320	there's two red field
S0443	yeah this one
S0320	that's and 's field isn't it
S0443	no
S0320	what's that for then
S0443	that's the camp field
S0320	mm
S0443	and then there's a secret location over here
S0320	oh okay
S0443	and then you go round on the other side of the lake which be where the generator will be be actually do a lot of erm wed specing today actually
S0320	how be the generator go to be all the way over there then
S0443	that's
S0320	what's it gonna be power
S0443	what do you think
S0320	the stuff in the marquee
S0443	mm
S0320	have all the cable get to come over the bridge then
S0443	yeah
S0320	have they
S0443	yeah
S0320	okay
S0443	the generator's pretty noisy
S0320	mm it's a big site though
S0443	and it's probably safer
S0320	oh okay what to have it over the water
S0443	mm
S0320	oh okay
S0443	and there might be some fireworks over there if get her own way
S0443	which she usually do but i think fireworks you might as well just burn a twenty pound note burn two hundred quid
S0320	mm
S0443	i think fireworks be a bite of a waste of money maybe we could all have sparklers maybe you be chief bridesmaid
S0320	i'm not chief bridesmaid
S0443	as a bridesmaid can say why don't we just all have sparklers
S0320	no my involvement in the wed tend to be yes that sound great would you like this bridesmaid's dress yeah why not that's that's generally as far as it go just go yeah alright then
S0443	have you get one
S0320	no i haven't get any yet just lot of different ideas erm but no i'm just go yes okay lovely
S0443	what would you like what would you like
S0320	i don't really mind as long as i can as long as it's get strap i don't want anything strapless
S0443	mm
S0320	i really don't mind long short whatever just the only thing i want be that it's get strap i'm not bother otherwise
S0443	oh okay
S0320	it's not i can't really it yeah no it's not 's get all of her friends and her cousin and her sister to tell her what they want i'll just go yeah okay yeah that's fine she doesn't need me go no i don't want that as well
S0443	oh okay
S0320	so i just keep say yeah fine yeah lovely that look nice why not why don't you buy this it's really cheap that's generally what i say look at this it's really cheap it's only twenty pound why don't you buy these you can buy seven on them and she'll go mm i don't want to
S0320	and she very politely go maybe and then ignore me
S0443	want to have a role
S0320	do what do you say to that
S0443	i say oh he's a bite little yet
S0320	i think my word would be he's a bite stubborn he probably won't do anything that anybody want
S0443	oh she just though he's so good look he'd look really sweet which be sweet
S0320	mm but he'll probably just run off and be on his own all the time he i don't i i don't
S0443	well he can't well he's get nine acres
S0320	exactly that's what i mean
S0443	he can't there's too much water
S0320	not run off and be on his own but he'll just run away from the other people like he always do
S0443	he might not
S0320	mm maybe he'll probably quite like it there'll be lot of kid
S0443	will there
S0320	yeah be say there's about twenty five kid so far
S0443	mm
S0320	i think they be go to do a tent for kid
S0443	yeah it's in this field
S0320	oh okay yeah
S0443	the kid zone
S0320	yeah
S0443	it's here
S0320	yeah
S0443	i think it should be in the chill out zone
S0320	er i don't because if it's if there's if the marquee be here and the kid zone be here that mean that you've get to walk all the way across here to come back and find the kid no i think it i think they're right i think it should be nearer the marquee at least in the same field
S0443	marquee be go here
S0320	yeah i think it i don't yeah
S0443	and there's a little bridge over here and then that's a muddy track over there
S0320	there be a lot of water isn't there
S0443	it's huge it's like it's a nature conservation site really
S0320	i hope the kid section be go to be enclose
S0443	course it's not
S0320	oh god
S0443	why would it be enclose
S0320	i don't know it might be like inside a marquee and all close up
S0443	no
S0320	there's this amaze slide that 's make
S0443	oh yeah
S0320	it look very nineteen fifties it probably wouldn't be in a modern park it's very tall
S0320	yeah
S0443	it's like fifteen feet tall make of stainless steel and quite steep and that will be in the kid's zone
S0320	mm that sound good
S0443	yeah so yeah it's a really lovely site actually it's just it's just a festival really be the thing
S0320	yeah that's fair enough
S0443	so this be where the ceremony be go to be cos there's tree here and want it there and i have to negotiate with them all because they say look if you stand there and look through the tree to the the mountains over there
S0320	mm
S0443	erm it'll work and say okay only if we can have hay bale
S0320	oh okay
S0443	so there's go to be hay bale for a hundred people there
S0320	really
S0443	yeah
S0320	gosh that's a lot
S0443	what of people or hay bale
S0320	both
S0443	i've get quite a few erm i've buy another couple of sheet to go on the hay bale cos they're go to be quite prickly
S0320	to do yeah
S0443	erm the other day so i get quite a few of those of course want to just go and buy a a bolt of calico
S0320	no really like the ones that you buy
S0443	i say oh it depend what like i can see what he mean it'll all but look very weddingy but calico be beige
S0320	she doesn't want really want it to look weddingy do she
S0443	calico be beige
S0320	i don't really know what calico be
S0443	er it's just you know the cover on the heater for the clothe
S0320	yeah
S0443	that
S0320	oh well that's alright
S0443	that kind of thing
S0320	it's very thick
S0443	yeah it be quite thick and it's that colour
S0320	you wouldn't get you wouldn't you wouldn't get prickle from the hay bale
S0443	but then what's the point of have hay bale
S0320	yeah
S0443	straw bale cos apparently straw bale be cheaper
S0320	straw yeah i be go to say straw bale be better
S0443	if you can't see the straw
S0320	i don't know
S0443	so that's go to start there
S0320	yeah
S0443	and then you've get to process into the chill out zone
S0320	okay
S0443	and then erm who be an expert welder be make a birdcage he call it
S0320	okay
S0443	it's like a pavilion that you get a bandstand
S0320	okay
S0443	and there's go to be a fire pit in it apparently
S0320	oh cool
S0443	and lot of cushion and lot of cushion round here and then a marquee there with serve pimms erm and a drink and some you know aperitifs and stuff there
S0320	yeah
S0443	and then acoustic music here
S0320	okay
S0443	and i don't think there's that's why i want the kid in there i don't think there's enough in the chill out zone
S0320	mm
S0443	but you have that so it be ceremony at two o'clock and then nibble and drink there
S0320	mm
S0443	and then you can either go across the rickety bridge which be just like the one in the three billy goats gruff
S0443	or you can go across here and
S0320	oh okay
S0443	and again i argue for that cos of the kid but that be the way the tractor will be go
S0320	mm
S0443	cos this be not a stable bridge
S0320	no
S0443	it's a beautiful but it's not very stable
S0320	yeah
S0443	and it's not very safe and then the main marquee be go to be here
S0320	yeah
S0443	so the food be go to be tapas in the main marquee at about half past three
S0320	okay
S0443	so the main marquee be there loos be go to be over here kid's zone be go to be here
S0320	mm
S0443	erm hog roast be go to be about here this be huge this field
S0320	mm
S0443	it must be at least three acres but it's flat unlike the orchard
S0320	okay
S0443	and then they're go to run erm erm a tap down here and this be go to be the camp area
S0320	yeah
S0443	not quite sure how it's go to work out with the cars et cetera but then if you go to a festival you don't take your car do you you just trudge trudge across a muddy field
S0320	i think people do take their cars
S0443	yeah but they if you think of glastonbury
S0320	yeah that's true
S0443	if you take your car you've still get to walk three miles to the site
S0320	yeah yeah
S0443	with and carry all your stuff
S0320	but then equally you get you can have a shower in glastonbury
S0443	yeah i think the loos will have shower
S0320	if you turn up well that's good cos if you turn up and lug carry all your stuff and put all your tent up and then want to go to the wed
S0443	no they'd come friday unless they be come only for the even thing i don't think they'd be do that
S0320	oh okay
S0443	so yeah
S0320	you're not camp then
S0443	no we're too grow up to camp
S0320	where be you stay
S0443	be you camp
S0320	i really don't know ideally i'd like i'd like or to go here you be we've find somebody to babysit for while you can go and have a have a nice time in the even and work it out that way but i don't know if that's go to happen or not
S0443	which even
S0320	well the even of the wed
S0443	well there'll be no one for him to
S0320	they can have for
S0443	babysit no that's not gonna happen
S0320	no i know it's not go to happen that's what i'd like to happen someone to go yeah of course
S0443	cos all the be the guests oh right
S0320	no not for the whole even just anyway i don't know erm i don't know if we'll camp or not maybe probably
S0443	i think you'll like
S0320	it's cheaper
S0443	the country park
S0320	oh yeah that's be that across the road
S0443	it's down down the road and off to the right it's very flat and by the beach
S0320	yeah but it also depend how long we
S0443	and it's get lot of little play park for to climb on
S0320	oh that sound better
S0443	mm and it's get much more facilities
S0320	and then i suppose if we'd have to take a taxi back
S0443	yeah everyone's go to be get taxi's yeah
S0320	from there to the apart from the people who be camp who be go to be stay the whole time
S0443	cos the house itself be out of bound it's actually quite a small house it's just a bungalow with a bite add on
S0320	oh be it yeah
S0443	so the house itself be out of bound
S0320	yeah then maybe we'll do that
S0443	yeah i think you'll like country park i think it'd be better if you have a the ideal would be if you're able to hire and camper van in country park
S0320	yes that would be nice actually
S0443	but erm i don't know
S0320	that would make life a lot easier
S0443	we find this yeah we find this big house find the big house that's set about eight or ten people and i say to shall we book it for you and and and the girls and you and and but erm cos it's august she have to wait for to tell her what she can do so the last thing be be think of book it for his merry men for the night before
S0320	yeah it sound like
S0443	which might be a great idea
S0320	yeah
S0443	cos it's not very far away it's in and it sleep load of people it's a really really big house
S0320	well that sound like a good idea
