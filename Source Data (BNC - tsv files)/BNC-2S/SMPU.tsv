S0588	but your mum be there and you're off on monday i know
S0589	my mum's here yeah
S0588	we could invite them with your mum here
S0588	then she'd take over she'd be tremendously

S0589	yes
S0589	not the i couldn't quote the exact figure but
S0588	yeah three thousand two hundred
S0589	i get the gist
S0588	quite a lot consider how little i've earn
S0589	yes
S0588	mm
S0589	erm now on saturday mum will be drive over but i want to go out and watch why have that wheel come off the chair

S0588	erm well there's chicken stock
S0589	freeze
S0588	oh er
S0589	do you freeze it

S0589	so it's not freeze
S0588	so it's not freeze which make that an option doesn't it
S0589	erm risotto's a bite too intense if i don't i'm not sure i'm in the mood
S0588	okay if you're not in the mood for risotto there's bad quality sausages
S0589	i'm not eat them
S0588	so we'll just have to surreptitiously throw them away i think
S0589	or try and foist foist them on
S0588	mm erm there be pies in the freezer
S0589	be there any vegetables be there any vegetables
S0588	vegetables in the freezer and there's half a red pepper i think there's an onion
S0589	do those courgettes work
S0588	yeah they're good
S0589	they look quite soggy in the pan
S0588	a little bite wet but i think if you the trick would be to put very little oil in i think they would have be a bite dryer i think i just put too much oil it but they be nice do with the bean like that so that's an option we could fry up bean and courgettes
S0589	look what about this for our porch
S0588	mm don't know it's hard to tell be that horrid or nice it's one of those on the line ones on the cusp of horrible or beautiful i want to see it
S0589	mm
S0588	further away
S0589	that's weird
S0588	yeah
S0589	don't understand what that be now
S0588	well it's get a double cover thingy do da whatsit
S0589	oh i see
S0588	i think not i'm look forward to have something for our porch actually would be really good if you could find something
S0589	well then let's have
S0588	oh that's a nice lampshade
S0588	that that one
S0589	mm sweet darling not for the library
S0588	no what's the library again an eclectic mix of nineteen
S0589	the second from the second decade of the twentieth century onwards
S0588	well it's
S0589	really
S0588	but the snug be
S0589	with particular
S0588	victorian
S0589	with an orange and or yellow motif
S0588	yes okay darling
S0589	mid century furniture do you want to put the pies on then dear
S0588	yeah i'm quite
S0589	yeah
S0588	enjoy look at these
S0589	no rush
S0588	maybe if we could just talk a little longer that's quite a nice one
S0589	what about a little pineapple
S0588	yeah sort of one i be think of just a very simple little one
S0589	i like it
S0588	i like it
S0589	i like it now do it have a fit though
S0588	it's six quid yeah good question
S0589	mm it look like it doesn't have anything
S0588	yeah so what do you do when it doesn't have anything
S0589	it's just the bare i'm think dunno
S0588	well you'd buy you'd buy a socket which you can get a make com and then somehow you'd have to
S0589	depend
S0588	fix it to that
S0589	depend what size this aperture be
S0588	yeah it do doesn't it
S0589	but otherwise you're right it would just be like a normal any old lampshade that you just put that between the who halve of the
S0588	yeah
S0589	lightbulb
S0588	well
S0589	holder
S0588	it's just the holder in the middle you'd need
S0589	but if that's an enormous
S0588	that nice yeah
S0589	then
S0588	then
S0589	i suppose i could fashion something
S0588	you'd have to fashion something
S0589	the right size
S0588	but fashion what and how
S0589	now what size be it dear
S0588	well it's the hole that's the the important question i wouldn't mind look at make com again
S0589	it's seven inch tall
S0588	that's good
S0589	so sort of
S0588	that's alright although we want it quite low down cos it's a higher ceiling that porch
S0589	that be quite low i mean that's
S0588	yeah
S0589	the height it fall down will just depend on the length of the
S0588	exactly
S0589	the cable which you just
S0588	so but we can buy a nice cable that's what i'm think that sort of vintage cable
S0589	well what would a vintage cable look like it's just a
S0588	i'll show you
S0589	it's just oh you mean like
S0588	well sort of brown and
S0589	you mean like a erm
S0588	nice look
S0589	what's it call
S0588	bakelite
S0589	like a rope tile
S0588	er
S0589	a rope type effect
S0588	oh hold let's see if there's anything that's more complete than that otherwise it might sit around for ten years i want one like that
S0589	mm
S0588	you won't let me have one like that will you
S0589	mm it's wrong you could in the snug
S0588	it's not wrong yes okay the snug then that's quite a nice one that's the sort of thing i be think but again we've get the same problem
S0589	again it's get no thingy would you like to serve some crisp
S0588	er well no not really again that's the same issue isn't it it's a bite small as well
S0589	oh for goodness sakes what's that all about
S0588	dunno go over paranoid
S0589	i always think that's a misuse of an apostrophe
S0588	yep it be a misuse of an apostrophe you're not suppose to have one there
S0589	it's very common
S0588	yeah
S0589	well you would do if it be specific to the year nineteen seventy
S0588	yeah yeah
S0589	a lot of them without the
S0588	that's nice yeah i dunno how you deal with that issue
S0589	i think that hang that way up
S0588	that's silly
S0589	oh okay
S0588	i don't like that one
S0589	sorry not for the porch
S0588	it's alright
S0589	for in here i still want a nicer one in here
S0588	we should check your mum's offer first before she take it down of the chandelier should go there
S0589	yeah
S0588	and check it out oh that's get the whole thing look otherwise we would have to use it
S0589	oh what's that hole
S0588	don't know
S0589	look that's the kind of cable you mean isn't it
S0588	mm it be
S0589	or be it a hole or be it just a weird reflection anyway i don't like it
S0588	no would you be able to finish the bookshelves in the snug
S0589	no cos i they need to be shape along the edge
S0588	have you not get them shape already
S0589	i don't have a shape tool
S0588	i don't suppose
S0589	oh hang on
S0588	could shape them
S0589	no i think do
S0588	before he go could he
S0589	cos do shape
S0588	yeah
S0589	the long edge but
S0588	well
S0589	we've get so little i don't want to cut it up and make mistake and then we don't have any
S0588	well can can you get to shape them before he go
S0589	no they be shape
S0588	they be shape you say
S0589	but then the
S0588	they weren't shape
S0589	the the long length it shape then it would need further shape once in situ
S0588	oh so then it's not shape then
S0589	it's not fully shape
S0588	well then we need to shape it
S0589	yes
S0588	could you get to do it
S0589	what about that one
S0588	before he go
S0589	buy it now twenty pound
S0588	have it get a light fit no not that keen move on
