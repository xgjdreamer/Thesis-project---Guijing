S0238	yeah erm i hadn't it's not something i'd really think about until my friend be run a vegetarian caf√© in in erm scarborough for quite a while
S0242	oh yeah
S0238	and so they have some of their dish all of their dish be vegetarian but some of their dish
S0242	some of them be
S0238	when they have v on their menu it mean vegan rather than vegetarian
S0242	right yeah yeah
S0238	erm and they have gluten free stuff and and so on erm and she actually make she make a vegan chocolate cake which be
S0242	right
S0238	much in demand you know she'd make it to order for birthday party and things
S0242	mm
S0238	because if you be a vegan it must be very difficult
S0242	mm
S0238	to actually er get stuff
S0242	yeah yes a festive vegan be almost an oxymoron isn't it
S0238	mm mm
S0238	mm there be a programme erm well it be a horizon about three weeks ago
S0242	uhu
S0238	but it be actually two consecutive days i think
S0242	mm
S0238	or at least two in one week erm about meat eat do you see it
S0242	no i didn't
S0238	erm it be the first one be look at the effect on health and the second one be look at the effect on the environment
S0242	uhu ah mm
S0238	and to me it be very impressive because
S0242	i hear about this
S0238	it wasn't say x y z it be talk to lot of different people who have do different study and some of them contradict each other and and you know
S0242	mm right
S0238	and quite a lot of it be well actually we don't we're not quite sure about this yet
S0242	right
S0238	but the general consensus be the planet would be better if more people eat more vegetables and less meat
S0242	yeah yeah yeah
S0238	and most people's health would be better if they eat less meat than they do
S0242	yeah
S0238	in in develop countries
S0242	it's a very inefficient way of feed your population
S0238	yes
S0242	to fee them meat
S0238	erm and i what shock me be what he be talk about as an average erm amount of meat consume by british men in a you know and so on
S0242	mm hm
S0238	and i be look at it and think i eat at least that much
S0242	uhu
S0238	and i'm not a man
S0242	right
S0238	you know and i be talk to my mum and say if i'm cook for myself i don't usually bother with potatoes i'll do two veg or sometimes even three veg and a larger portion of meat
S0242	yeah
S0238	than one perhaps otherwise would have therefore which be partly to compensate for the lack of potatoes and partly because you can't buy a joint for one
S0242	right
S0238	you know
S0242	yes yes yeah
S0238	erm and you know i really clearly be eat too much erm so it's make me think but i like fish
S0242	mm
S0238	and i like vegetarian food so it be a bite silly to eat as much meat as i do i need to try and erm plan things a bite better erm but it leave
S0242	you mention fish i sorry i think it be the day you move into this house and i phone you
S0238	mm
S0242	and a rather breathless pick up the phone because you'd just walk in the door with a large packet of fish and chip in your hand do you remember that
S0238	mm i don't often eat fish and chip
S0242	right but it be a suddenly it it'd be a right day for fish and chip obviously
S0238	mm yeah erm i remember it now you say it i'd forget no i be i it leave me with a lot of question because he be they be differentiate between process meat red meat and white meat ie chicken
S0242	mm
S0238	erm particularly in term of health more than environment erm and he keep go process meat for example bacon and sausage and i'm think well okay what about corn beef where do where do that fit and
S0242	mm yeah
S0238	and you know erm if you buy i quite often buy stuff from the er delicatessen counter in the supermarket for my sandwich
S0242	yeah
S0238	and okay he be clear about ham but if i'm buy cold roast pork slice from the delicatessen be that process or be it red meat do you know what i mean cos it's
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	ie would it be better for me to roast a joint of pork and use some of it use the fag end for my sandwich or or be it just the same as what i'm buy and and those kind of question obviously just weren't answer at all
S0242	right
S0238	erm and not and where do where do things like duck and turkey fit it be only talk about chicken
S0242	mm
S0238	in contrast to beef pork and lamb
S0242	right
S0238	i would imagine
S0242	also it's process meat ham i mean if you a ham in its simplest state be a piece of dead pig that you hang up in your hut for two years
S0238	mm
S0242	and then eat
S0238	mm
S0242	erm it it's not er most ham you would certainly buy in a supermarket there's nothing like that at all it's be process here and accelerate there and so on
S0238	yeah yeah yeah
S0242	but er they air dry cure lump of ham have be that really process or not
S0238	i don't know
S0242	you know i'm
S0238	mm
S0242	you really do just hang it up and leave it there for a erm eighteen months or so
S0238	well again you know so if you're buy meat from a farm shop for example how do that fit into the the whole
S0242	right
S0238	so yes it so it be look at very general categorisations and make some general suggestions and so on but it wasn't answer those kind of detail question
S0242	but then fair enough
S0238	turn out to do so yeah fine
S0242	fine well
S0238	but if you're actually think of change your diet you actually need to know the answer to those kind of question
S0242	yeah right
S0238	mm cos i remember the b and b that i use to go to near they do a cook breakfast every morning and that be all you know free range egg and and the bacon be from some specialist farm nearby and you know it would that be better bacon or be all bacon bad
S0238	you know
S0242	yes and another aspect of that that would interest me i i very seldom eat erm sort of vegetarian meat you know sausage vegetarian sausages
S0238	mm yeah yeah
S0242	and things like that but i'm gonna how much effort go into produce that be it a very energy intensive process to
S0238	well
S0242	move from a soya bean
S0238	mm
S0242	to something that look like a sausage
S0238	they didn't look at that they when when they be look at the environment they be mostly look at they be look at the environmental impact of beef well er mutton pork and chicken
S0242	mm hm
S0238	erm really and as he say he be not look at things from a an animal right point of view
S0242	no no
S0238	erm because actually the most the smallest carbon footprint be for chickens which be be raise in a big shed
S0238	not all squash together
S0242	mm
S0238	they have a bite of
S0242	okay
S0238	or well they be they be walk around
S0242	mm
S0238	but they be still very very concentrate and you know
S0242	mm mm
S0238	erm but it be it be i can't remember the figure now obviously but it be massively better than than any of the others
S0242	yeah
S0238	and as you would expect beef be the worst lamb be nearly as bad pork be substantially less and chicken be massively less
S0242	mm yep
S0238	but at one point he do compare i think he do compare a sausage and a vegetarian sausage but i think it be on the health thing and that actually there wasn't a significant difference between them on whatever they be look at at that point
S0242	mm mm mm
S0238	which could have be saturate fat or something like that you know
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	erm but clearly not a simple question each he take us to a a beef farm if that's the right word
S0242	mm
S0238	in in america where you know there's not a blade of grass in sight they're be feed erm cereals
S0242	yeah uhu
S0238	erm and keep in i mean they're not sort of stand in row but they're not exactly gamble free through the field or anything
S0242	yeah right
S0238	erm and er that be actually a lower carbon footprint
S0242	mm
S0238	a lot lower
S0242	mm
S0238	than have them wander about
S0242	ah
S0238	because they be they fatten fast they reach the point when they would be slaughter much faster
S0242	yeah yep
S0238	erm so they weren't burp methane into the atmosphere for for four years it be eighteen months that sort of difference you know
S0242	right right
S0238	erm but on the other hand if you look at then there's other things that you're look at so it depend what you what your focus be
S0242	mm yeah yeah
S0238	and what your priorities be
S0242	yes
S0238	as to what you actually think be good and obviously those particular because they're in america and there's no legislation there about antibiotics they're cram with antibiotics
S0242	oh yes yeah
S0238	which of course be an issue for us
S0242	right mm
S0238	and the the beef producers' answer to that question be more or less well there's no evidence that it's do any harm so we might as well do it you know rather than i mean you sort of think and there's certainly evidence that antibiotics that overuse of antibiotics in the world be do harm
S0242	yeah absolutely
S0238	erm but
S0242	quite right yes the particularly the food standards in the unite state be a big question at the moment in europe isn't it because
S0238	mm
S0242	there be the negotiations go on about the free trade area between north america
S0238	mm
S0242	and the eu and that may be a good idea or not but if it a lot of people be say and i think with great justification if it mean the consequence of that treaty that erm food raise to american standards be in be erm cannot be stop from be import into the european union and so on then then that be a problem for a lot of people
S0238	well i just i don't see how you could possibly justify that on any kind of legal basis but if you know if if european farmers be not allow to do x then anybody sell within that area shouldn't be allow to do x that's just to me that's just completely clear there isn't any issue about that and if americans want to conform to our standards they bloody well you know on to sell they're gonna have to conform to our standards tough
S0242	well yes yeah i think i personally would agree with you completely but erm if the big picture be that the european union will be a lot more prosperous if there be a lot more transatlantic trade and so on and if the us administration insist that that erm that open up the market to food produce to us standards be part of a treaty
S0238	mm
S0242	then what do you do i mean i would say and you say
S0238	no
S0242	no but
S0238	call their bluff
S0242	yeah
S0238	cos it's time they learn that they can't bully the rest of the world
S0238	i mean the fact be that we do accept goods produce in sweatshops and so on that shouldn't be you know there's not there's already a lot of question mark and i i just think you can't have those sort of double standards that's just so hypocritical we're say that these be the only acceptable standards then we shouldn't be be allow anything to be buy or sell that hasn't be
S0242	mm
S0238	produce accord to those standards but yeah we do do it with other things
S0242	yeah yep mm very good
S0238	good ah
S0238	yeah i mean i've yeah it's sort of
S0242	yeah mm
S0238	it's not my normal back problem it's a pull here and that be exactly what i get the last time i try to do that
S0242	uhu
S0238	erm which be worry because that mean i've actually pull something that i don't normally pull i think it's probably a particular muscle
S0242	mm
S0238	but i'm not well enough ground in
S0242	mm
S0238	erm physiology to be sure about that one
S0238	i think sorry to be erm nattery about this i think it would be a really good idea if you go and check your e ticket now before we sit down and have a nice long slow dessert erm because
S0242	okay
S0238	i be quite sure what you do last time be look at the start time say oh it'll be fine if i arrive by such and such a time and it wasn't because they're much stricter about it than you we expect
S0242	right
S0242	there we go
S0238	i'll just clear a few of these things mm
S0242	okay
S0238	what do it say
S0242	check in site
S0238	mm
S0242	that's a good bite of mix english and german isn't it
S0238	yes
S0242	erm be nineteen hundred
S0238	right so you your aim for six be absolutely fine
S0242	i be in fact okay i be aim to get there at eighteen hundred
S0238	well i mean as you say that sound completely reasonable it's just that last time you do
S0242	right
S0238	do something
S0242	right
S0238	that sound completely reasonable
S0242	it sound but yes exactly you're quite right but anyway we have now check it we can now relax as you say
S0238	erm i'm just recycle i've just recycle that cos i didn't think you'd really want garlic on the spoon you be use for the dessert
S0238	be you happy with it cold because i prefer crumble cold
S0242	mm
S0238	which be a
S0242	yeah
S0238	obviously i can put your portion in a dish and zap it in a microwave
S0242	no no no no no this be fine
S0238	right well i'm serve some custard and i'm sorry my custard's tin as well because i actually prefer tin custard to homemade
S0242	right
S0238	i look for some you know the supermarkets have custard in the fridge section which be nicer than the tin
S0242	mm
S0238	and i couldn't find any at morrisons sainsbury's certainly have it but i wasn't gonna go to sainsbury's just for custard that's
S0242	right
S0238	that do strike me just as a little bite we need a spoon you need a spoon
S0242	yep
S0238	oh ah there you go sir
S0242	thank you
S0238	so we'll use that to serve cos it's bigger
S0242	right
S0238	and just take as much as you like i mean i know these dish aren't brilliantly big but you can always have second
S0242	ah
S0242	oh yes i'm not gonna argue with my computer but i've get a message please do not power off or unplug your machine instal update seven of twelve
S0238	oh
S0242	now since this be not connect to the internet
S0238	and there's well
S0242	it hasn't be for some time
S0238	yeah
S0242	so where be these update come from
S0242	one ask oneself
S0238	well it's a little bite alarm actually i mean obviously there be there be there be always wireless network in the area but you need a password for them
S0242	yeah i know
S0238	which you haven't get so
S0242	right right
S0238	and i haven't get cos i've get a router
S0242	ah yeah oh i don't think i've tell you any of this story but we have great dramas with 's computer
S0238	mm
S0242	oh i do tell you
S0238	you do yeah
S0242	okay yeah
S0238	be it now fix
S0242	mm mm
S0238	but as you say things like that always happen at a point of maximum inconvenience when you really really need it with something specific
S0242	yeah still instal update seven of twelve
S0238	mm
S0242	i mean i'll just leave it chuntering away to itself
S0238	well i wonder if it be in the middle of something when you switch it off when you be connect and it think it's still do it yeah
S0242	yeah well last time last time i have i have it turn on it be connect
S0238	mm
S0242	that be yesterday morning
S0238	but you'd think if it be in the middle of a job it would have tell you as you try to switch it off then wouldn't you
S0242	mm yeah
S0238	mm
S0242	mm this be good this be very good
S0238	well as i say i think if i'm go to have to put up with all those brambles i might as well get at least i get some benefit
S0242	yeah
S0238	mm i mean the only trouble obviously about leave here at four o'clock be you're right in nasty traffic all the way at that time but i mean there isn't really anything you can do about that
S0242	no
S0238	erm oh obviously it's noticeably worse these last couple of weeks now that the school have go back
S0242	mm
S0238	it be it's quite a shock to the system cos you get so use to it
S0242	to to it not to school and so on yeah yeah
S0238	well i i've never really understand this but i find that the traffic get steadily lighter week by week from easter onwards so by the time and okay yes it's very light in the summer holiday but it isn't only for those five weeks or whatever it it have be get lighter for quite a while and then suddenly wham in september you're back to max again aren't you
S0242	mm
S0238	the only explanation i can think of be a lot of people enough people be take their annual holiday at any time from april to july that the number of the total number of cars on the road be be be reduce
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	cos it really you know i don't think it's my imagination
S0242	and ah i don't know i'm sure one could ah my computer
S0238	what
S0242	no no no the screen just go blank sorry but it's still it's still to update seven of twelve
S0238	oh
S0242	total nonsense
S0238	mm mm
S0242	as i'm sure people who study traffic and so on could tell us this but it could well be that let's say two percent reduction in the number of cars on the road result in a forty percent erm decrease in in the traffic in the in the journey time cos
S0238	mm yeah
S0242	if something be just about on the total limit if
S0238	yes
S0242	the two percent difference can make maybe an enormous difference
S0238	that's quite possible yes that would make sense
S0242	mm
S0238	mm i have a guy in one of my class in germany who do basically work for what whatever they're call be it n falfa you know the munich fecayers
S0242	yeah
S0238	yeah erm sort of work out the the maximum efficiencent on timetables and god know what
S0242	right right
S0238	you know i mean i would say that's not road but erm he be he it have never really strike me until i meet him that that be obviously a a real white collar job and he be very bright and need to be
S0242	mm mm
S0238	to do that sort of thing that it's not exactly comparable with mend the roads design traffic systems and so on exactly
S0242	no it isn't it it it be a very complicate
S0238	yeah
S0242	once once you sort of say right i be a mathematician i will model
S0238	mm
S0242	traffic and so on that's erm just the most about the most complicate model as what you can what you can manage as a mathematician because there be so many factor and er erm and you've get to factor in unknowns like er well an accident or whatever
S0238	mm
S0242	or somebody on the motorway it's down to one lane and somebody run out of petrol just there for instance and be it worth have pain to have two pickup truck park by the side of a road
S0238	mm mm mm
S0242	and hang about smoke fag do absolutely nothing for ninety nine point nine percent of the time but you need two truck there because if you have two incidents erm and you've only get one truck erm then you know the whole of the m25 or the whole of the m56 or whatever can grind to a halt and
S0238	yeah
S0242	and from the economic effect of that on the economy of britain could be enormous
S0238	mm
S0242	because if you if you've get thousands of people arrive late for work and so on and so forth and then
S0238	well and also we transport a lot of stuff on the road i mean that's something that
S0242	mm mm
S0238	that comment on that when he's be in britain how many lorries there be on the road a lot of of which stuff be transport by rail in america apparently
S0242	mm yeah
S0238	now i didn't think that america have such a big nail rail nail retwork rail network
S0238	but maybe that's passenger you know i didn't think that people travel by train so much i think they do more they do drive more
S0242	mm
S0238	but i don't know and i've certainly experience have you watch qi
S0242	i know it but i
S0238	mm erm cos it's something in i don't know which what letter they be do and what they be talk about
S0242	uhu
S0238	but there be something where they be talk about this sort of effect where on a motorway where somebody slow down for you know put the brake on and they there's this sort of wave effect that go
S0242	mm yes
S0238	that go a really long way back and you end up
S0242	yeah
S0238	all go slowly and think when you and there's nothing visible
S0242	right yes
S0238	be it all and i've experience that so many time and think what be we all slow down for
S0242	mm yes yeah yeah instal update eleven of twelve i don't know
S0238	well he's do something
S0242	exactly
S0238	isn't he how very odd
S0242	don't know what he's do but he's progress well
S0238	well when you get take over by little green men from mar
S0242	exactly it's maybe when it's we've have instal update twelve of twelve little green man say we now rule the world come up on my screen
S0238	possibly let's hope not
S0238	mm so i be think possibly do you prefer tea or coffee after lunch sit outside with a cuppa
S0242	mm yeah i really don't mind whichever really really i don't mind so whatever you normally have i'll go with
S0238	well i'm gonna be make erm ginger tea for me
S0242	oh
S0238	so that doesn't really help
S0242	no okay erm
S0238	it really doesn't i'm i'm it really really really doesn't matter that it's equally easy to make either
S0242	er coffee
S0238	right
S0242	shut down
S0238	oh right
S0242	no little green men wave at me
S0238	oh well excellent do it say what it be an update of
S0242	no
S0242	no
S0238	well isn't that a bite strange i mean don't they normally tell you
S0242	well possibly if i have have my eye on it in the begin it would have say microsoft update or whatever
S0238	mm
S0242	but you know if you say good night go to bed as it be you don't then stare at your computer screen usually you just er
S0238	yeah
S0242	er so i say you know go to bed and then glance at it a couple of minutes later and it be
S0238	and you hadn't
S0242	instal update
S0238	ever click on it to tell it to or be it be yours set up so that it automatically do it
S0242	it be yes
S0238	ah right you see mine isn't i would have have to click on whatever it be in the first place
S0242	yeah
S0238	erm cos what annoy me and i suppose i don't know any other way they can do it but you go into i only go into a programme when i want to use it
S0242	mm
S0238	and that's the point to which it say do you want to install an update and well no not right now because i'm about to do something
S0242	i'm busy yes exactly
S0238	erm and so i always say no and then of course i reach a point like i do with the skype where it actually won't work because
S0242	right yeah
S0238	i refuse the update so frequently er but erm presumably a lot of people just do have their computers on with various things open which i find weird
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	mm
S0242	ah
S0238	right
S0242	oh dear
S0238	ow ow
S0242	ah oh
S0238	yes but it's not so much the ow it's the fact that it that i can't get it to work that be really really annoy me
S0238	and i shall have to stop go on about it because it's quite unconstructive to just keep on tell you how cross i be
S0238	you know there's a this twining's ginger
S0242	mm
S0238	be call settle er and i definitely find that that doesn't that if when you whether it's good for my stomach i don't know but it's certainly not bad for it so
S0242	okay right
S0238	erm whereas actually even normal tea be not brilliant
S0242	really yeah yeah
S0238	it's better than coffee but it's still not brilliant
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	mm ah so you'll come to this restaurant again will you
S0242	most definitely most definitely
S0238	well i find it quite interest think of vegetarian things to cook actually you know
S0242	yeah yes
S0238	erm and think well i'm not just go to do bloody cheese on toast you know
S0242	right yes
S0238	try and do something try and think of something that i haven't do for you before
S0242	yeah right no very good indeed
S0238	so erm erm and i've actually get i've get a couple of colleagues who be vegetarian i mean one of them call herself vegetarian but she do eat fish as well
S0242	mm
S0238	she's one of those erm but i still think even if somebody tell me that in some ways it's easier just to cook totally vegetarian
S0242	yes
S0238	and the last time she come there be two of them and the other one be completely vegetarian so you know
S0242	the yeah yes right
S0238	so
S0242	some time ago we have a er well we invite four friends round for dinner and one couple two no be two couple one couple accept but in a sense very reluctantly not reluctantly in that they didn't want to come but they say erm er but she be allergic to er and der and der and der and der and der and der
S0238	i mean it do make it difficult i mean you would feel very very awkward wouldn't you
S0242	and right and so i say right well you know i'm sure we can sort that out you know send me er send me a list of of of everything which be not possible and i will then devise a menu and then send that back to you for for approval
S0238	yeah
S0242	erm and in fact it be a good job i do because then in my menu there be something which wasn't hadn't be put on the list but to which she be also very very allergic
S0238	right yeah
S0242	and so we have to have a revise list and so on erm but that er and i take that as a challenge and and
S0238	mm
S0242	it be really quite fun but but bloody hard work try first of all this time to work out erm a menu as it be and and then in fact cook things which some of which i'd never cook before in my life
S0238	good
S0242	erm and but i i get my reward as it be because erm at the end of the meal she say oh that be absolutely wonderful really enjoy that and she then tell us that this be the first time she'd be out to dinner in four years
S0238	bloody hell
S0238	you see i be well the last my german pen friend you know person that i do exchange when i be a teenager we stay in touch for years and years and the last time she come we really didn't get on well at all
S0242	i remember you didn't
S0238	and i end and we haven't communicate since and one of the factor there be she's a she have become a vegetarian she didn't bother to tell me before she come
S0242	no
S0238	so and she and she she'd just say oh well just cook what you're cook i'll just eat the vegetables well no if you're someone who like cook you don't want to do it you feel awful
S0242	yeah
S0238	and i and a lot of the things she be do be make me feel like a bad host
S0242	right yes yes
S0238	whereas if she'd just contact me beforehand it's not a problem
S0242	no quite
S0238	you know
S0242	quite
S0238	erm and the fact be that she be always a bite of a problem with the with you always felt rather bad because she's anorexic and i think that's something like be alcoholic that once you're anorexic in a sense you always be
S0242	mm hm
S0238	that it's kind of in your system so although she's no longer in the sort of state that she be as a teenager she still eat ridiculously small portion
S0242	right
S0238	so i mean she's slightly taller than me but she we my brother and i calculate the second time she come so she'd be sixteenish i suppose erm and my mother happen to have a book of calories cos she be at weight watchers at the time
S0242	right
S0238	so we know we we calculate that she be have about seven hundred calories a day six to seven hundred calories a day and as i say she's slightly taller than me so
S0242	yeah yeah
S0238	you know and still a teenager so i mean i'm not say she be still grow but you know
S0242	but well yeah but she be to some extent yeah for sure she's still develop
S0238	just and and okay she get a bite better than that but she be still not somebody who really bother about food and stuff
S0242	no
S0238	it still it it's just awkward when you're the host but well maybe it isn't to everybody some people be much more casual about things but it it bother me i want to get things right
S0242	and i would i would certainly be annoy if somebody arrive i mean and when they get here tell me that they be you know vegetarian or allergic to gluten or whatever or whatever
S0238	yeah
S0242	it's it's just a matter of well common courtesy i would say
S0238	i would think so yes
S0242	erm to say so and i mean i've have case mostly people will say oh yeah no problem but occasionally you sort of say this on the phone i'm a vegetarian and there's a sort of stun silence and
S0242	and then you say well erm how about er a for instance if i'm in germany and everybody know that and everybody know with that how to cook that and it be vegetarian and so on
S0238	yes
S0242	and you can sort of feel the ah yes
S0242	now sort of you can hear not hear it but feel it come down the phone somehow
S0238	right let's take these mug outside
S0242	okay
S0238	i'm just gonna if you take your coffee i'm just gonna switch that off
S0242	right
