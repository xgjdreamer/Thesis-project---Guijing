S0023	yeah we're record now go ahead
S0022	shall we check that it work
S0023	no it'll be fine
S0022	okay alright which of your personality traits would you most like to change
S0023	most like to change the my my lack of memory i've get a terrible memory
S0022	that's not a personality trait
S0023	well it probably isn't no that's the first thing that come to mind unless you think unless it's my laziness in try to remember that make me have a bad memory which it could be aha er personality trait that well one doesn't like to admit to one's fault that's a tricky one
S0022	oh well i think it's a virtue be able to admit to one's fault isn't it
S0023	what would i like to change yeah i suppose it would be it would be good but then you see if you've get the fault and you know what they be why don't you do something about them that's the
S0022	well
S0023	that's embarrass then isn't it
S0022	well not necessarily for example i think
S0022	i the what i'd most like to change be my sort of temper stroke speak before i engage my brain
S0023	oh
S0022	and it's really really hard but i think i'm definitely better but it's really really hard cos the thing be you don't see it come it's not as if you feel it come well if i do feel my temper come on i can do something about it but but often i find that i've say something and it's not until after i've say it i think oh why do i say that but it's do in the spur of the moment so it's really i mean it sound as though i'm make an excuse but it be really really hard so that's why i spend half my life apologise so
S0023	oh i don't think it's quite that much honey
S0022	well it be definitely better than it be definitely
S0023	yeah
S0022	but it's still it's still there a bite
S0023	well that remind me that remind me of a a flaw that i use to have and obviously don't have any more though my my describe it be never er as not have it any more it be in fact an instance of it sort of
S0022	it's arrogance
S0023	well it be actually yes i use to be a little bite
S0022	yeah you're definitely better than you use to be
S0023	yes i use to think i know everything and that everyone else be silly and um yeah i think i've stop believe that now and i think i'm one could be secure in one's ideas
S0022	yeah certainly take pride in yourself
S0023	and yet also open to other people's
S0022	yeah definitely
S0023	and and you do have to judge people and see if they know if they have reason valid in their ideas and if they do that's fine and if they don't well that's their business
S0022	yeah
S0023	um but you know you have to accept that everyone's get their own independent ideas and how they've arrive at them be often a bite different from yours
S0022	yes
S0023	um but it but you mustn't be go the other way and be on self conflict
S0022	no
S0023	what's the opposite of arrogant
S0022	er well
S0023	simper perhaps or be that too much
S0022	no no no no no that's not no simper be when you're like a to someone um what's the opposite of arrogant it's it's probably um well it's like be really humble but that's sort of modest maybe
S0023	oh okay modest yeah that sound about right
S0022	erm but i think it's a fine line because i think arrogance be clearly sort of an unattractive trait with people but so be false modesty cos that's just annoy
S0023	yeah
S0022	cos it just feel as if they're look for you to say no you're not really you're brilliant
S0022	and that's annoy i think it's to find the the sort of the fine line between what you think between have confidence
S0023	ah yes
S0022	and not this it's um quite hard
S0023	i'm sure there's a line of poetry i can't remember which be along the line of um
S0022	that's probably from if or something isn't it
S0023	yeah know all know your strengths and your weaknesses and draw the line between them
S0022	yeah
S0023	where you you're honest about yourself basically
S0022	mm
S0023	er yeah well that's a good thing to have
S0022	yeah
S0023	so i suppose still sometimes arrogant i don't think i get too er angry although i do sometimes i do swear at a bloke at work the other day just because he be sit in my chair but it wasn't really my chair because we have hot desking but i'd have a hard journey and i sometimes do lose my temper a bite when it come to because of the travel and stuff it's not really a very good excuse nice a very nice bloke
S0022	do you apologise afterwards
S0023	yeah i do later you know
S0022	oh good cos that's half the battle
S0023	but we're all in the same barrel there and it's because if it happen to be a bad day and everyone's in and there's no chair then it's just how can you get on with your work it's just frustrate
S0022	yeah
S0023	and er you think why do i have to fight for the right to sit down and get on with my job it's just insane
S0022	yeah
S0023	so i'm give that job up soon which be a good thing
S0022	that's good
S0023	yeah anyway
S0022	good right do you want to ask me a question
S0023	oh yes i'd love to ask you a question will you marry me oh no we've do that one already um
S0022	actually you do propose to me when i be wear tracksuit bottom that's nice go on
S0023	yeah well that that that bird be win i think funnily
S0022	that's gonna that's go to present a lovely image isn't it anyway go on
S0023	yeah if you decide to go on a spiritual journey
S0022	ooh
S0023	where would you go and what would you do
S0022	ooh now that's fairly interest
S0023	isn't it
S0022	a spiritual journey
S0023	yeah what be that
S0022	well i'll tell you what i
S0023	it doesn't have to be spas do it just go and
S0022	no although that could be interest as such
S0023	that's what come to my mind anyway go on
S0022	what i actually this be quite funny but when i think of when you say spiritual i think of religion
S0023	do you
S0022	what i have do a couple of time be um on good friday in london they have a well march isn't the right word but they have a sort of procession
S0023	mm mm
S0022	that go from oh the methodist outside the methodist hall
S0023	mm
S0022	up to be it to westminster abbey i think it's to westminster abbey and then to westminster cathedral in other word you're go from three different type of
S0023	oh right three different type of christianity well yeah
S0022	so i go there one time i go there probably i don't know five years ago
S0023	mm
S0022	and then i go another time with my mum and the funny thing be that now um i really although i might put christian on form i really i'm not a practise christian and i i you know i'll go to church at christmas and easter and stuff but when i've be on those i've be so i've find them so move and the last one i go on i think i cry
S0023	mm oh
S0022	um cos i think
S0023	why be that do you think
S0022	well i think the crucifixion story be so move and erm what's his name cardinal erm murphy o'connor he's the head of the catholic church
S0023	mm
S0022	he be er he give a little talk and i find that very very move so that's when i speak to that's what i think he'd do erm if i be go oh erm i'm not sure
S0023	i guess you could take it to mean some place that you go not because you wanna see the sit or have a rest but somewhere where you go to enhance your your spirit where you go purely for sort of i don't know spiritual i suppose it could mean anywhere that you go to enhance your um your consciousness as oppose to just physically relax
S0022	yeah mm
S0023	so what would you say
S0022	huh i really don't know it's not normally a i don't normally think about er spiritual matter be not normally something that i'd particularly think about erm
S0023	maybe you should
S0022	maybe i should
S0023	mm
S0022	um ooh i don't know i'm gonna leave too big a gap on the record if i think about it i'm not sure what about you
S0023	yeah i i pick this out cos i wasn't sure what my own answer be and think it be an interest question but if you yeah you know have the time to do it a spiritual journey somewhere somewhere you would go some things you would do whereby you would just focus on improve your own spirit mean your um er it's hard to describe actually isn't it
S0022	yeah
S0023	your consciousness and your your feel about yourself and um yeah it's a good question i suppose it do tend to be to do with religion and you say oh i'd go to the top of a mountain and um achieve enlightenment
S0022	but i think on the other hand i mean you could um i think if you if you think of a figure that you really really admire if you look if you think of um yeah if you think of a figure that you really admire i mean it could even i mean you don't tend to think of um business as spirituality but do you remember when i meet you you use to read those book every morning you read a book an autobiography
S0023	biographies yeah usually yeah
S0022	um about and so cos you say to me and you say to me yeah read a biography and a biography of people you admire and you say you read that in the morning so that you'd start the day
S0023	mm mm
S0022	you'd read it over breakfast and you'd start the day feel inspire
S0023	yeah
S0022	which i think be brilliant and um that in a way could be it's not i don't think it's what we'd sort of traditionally think of as spiritual but if it's something that give you more motivation more sort of zest for life then well why not
S0023	mm yeah yeah well that's true so that's make me think actually you could look at it in a broader way and i'd say say for example go to er florence i could see that as a spiritual journey cos i really love the art they've get there
S0022	yes yeah yeah
S0023	and i would go there purely with the purpose of try to enhance my er enjoyment of life through art and i definitely would i'd consider that
S0022	yeah and ice cream
S0023	yeah
S0023	yeah that as well
S0022	we should do that we should go back there
S0023	ice cream
S0022	the euro's good this year apparently
S0023	it's better than it be
S0022	it's suppose to be a good year for go to europe because the euro have have go down finally
S0023	yeah compare to the pound yeah
S0022	mm oh
S0023	yeah we should go and write that down as a suggestion for a holiday
S0022	no we should if this
S0023	it's true
S0022	i mean if this barge thing isn't go to work out then maybe we should go to florence
S0023	yeah although they have barge in venice but that's a different kind of barge
S0022	a different sort of barge
S0023	someone else do all the punt as well
S0022	yeah
S0023	yeah spiritual that's interest but then on the other hand see what's the opposite the opposite of spiritual be material so you could say you go on to a beach to relax and that be genuinely physically relax but then even that be relax your mind you know human be be both aren't they
S0022	but then if you're really you know what it's like if you're really um say you've have a really hard time at work and you're just all you can feel physically sort of
S0022	oh dear that's my phone you can feel sort of physically tense but you've also get your mind sort of whirl with all these things and then if you then go to somewhere like a spa or a beach whatever i don't know be that can you count that as spiritual what i'm think of be
S0023	not really
S0022	okay right okay
S0023	well i'm just read out the question it say spiritual journey so not spiritual relaxation
S0022	yeah okay
S0023	spiritual journey imply er you know a begin and an end and it's
S0022	i can't see myself go i can't see myself do meditation or go to a convent or or any anything traditionally spiritual
S0023	no
S0022	i don't really feel i think it would be i think it could be good to reflect on various things but i don't really feel the
S0023	you know you could have a spiritual journey on the barge through the you know er through the through the english countryside if you
S0022	you mean hug a tree
S0023	yeah something like that
S0022	yeah you could do but um anyway
S0023	anyway let's do another one
S0022	okay
S0023	oh it's your turn now
S0022	right let's have a look what have we get okay we've do that one ah here's a romantic one
S0023	what
S0022	be there only one soul mate for each person
S0023	well there be for me at the moment and i would i would not expect there to be anyone that could equal your wonderfulness darling so
S0022	ah
S0023	um i don't know be it true if you know something you think well you know touch wood such a thing would never happen but if anything happen to you then maybe if i'm search long and hard i might find someone who would come a bite up to your standard but um i think we're very very compatible
S0022	yeah but do you think that
S0023	i mean why would that be true what it say in the question only if you believe in some higher power that's pick people out to be pair which i don't
S0022	yeah see i don't believe it's true i think the thing be when you and i meet we have we be obviously compatible at a certain level
S0023	mm
S0022	but you i think you
S0023	we have change
S0022	yeah you grow more towards or apart from each other
S0023	yeah yeah that's true
S0022	um and yeah it i i don't i think that if you find a sort of perfect relationship with one person then to be able to expect that again be obviously gonna be harder but then ah mm but then i don't know but i no i don't i don't think that there's only one soul mate no i think you you meet people you sort of grow into each other as it be
S0023	mm yeah i think i'd agree with that it's a funny idea though that there be i mean where do that come from
S0022	well it's a sort of romantic idea isn't it i don't know why because it it um
S0023	well why be it romantic
S0022	maybe it isn't i don't know
S0023	yeah
S0022	maybe it's more romantic that there isn't
S0023	yeah well i think it's more romantic to say that you know as we've just you you've just say you have to work towards it
S0022	it's it's like that thing thing from louis de bernieres do you remember that read that we have at our wed and be it say it's like you're two you're two tree but your root be entwine together
S0023	oh yes yeah yeah but i think as you say it's more there's a lot of it that come when you meet it's about whether you decide to grow your root towards each other it it be a conscious decision a lot of it
S0022	yeah i know that definitely when um it's quite interest because my friend when i meet her she be go out with um a chappy who be a bite older than her
S0023	be older than her yeah you say
S0022	um quite sort of sensible and then when she um start when she finish her relationship with him and then she go she start go out with other people she become much less so um much less sort of she be more sort of
S0023	do she mirror the people she go out with
S0022	yes she do and i think at the same time it that that she split up with her um her original boyfriend i meet you and we sort of i i could see quite clearly that we sort of become less alike because i become more like you and she become more like her so yep
S0023	yeah yes mm interest be it my go now
S0022	yes it be
S0023	right my next one be
S0022	please don't think i'm rude if i read my text message while you're you know
S0023	oh how shock what historical i hope you're pay attention shall i wait until you're pay attention
S0022	oh this be from sorry i'll read it out to you
S0023	oh yeah what do it say
S0022	it be really lovely thank we go to see david hockney exhibition mm
S0023	oh yeah
S0022	have tea at have lunch at fortnum and mason and then a tour around west minister abbey it be absolutely fab how be you both
S0023	mm
S0022	i hope that she get my message i hope i didn't leave it no i couldn't have leave it on the wrong phone oh well never mind
S0023	oh well she's um say something now that's good
S0022	but she's yeah good she's have a nice day but anyway yes go on
S0023	that's good yeah so what historical time period would you most like to visit
S0022	ah ha ha ha
S0023	similar to the question we do the other day but not quite the same thing
S0022	to visit
S0023	it's not about where you be bear you just get to visit and come back so imagine you have a time machine and you could jump in it and it wouldn't cost you anything and you could go in and you could do what you want to you could stay for say you know um a week or two weeks and you'd be perfectly safe you know well assume you didn't get blow up
S0023	what would you the most curious to go and witness first hand
S0022	ahh that's interest
S0023	but you only have a couple of weeks be what we're say we're not say you could visit it and live there that's a different question
S0022	yeah
S0023	so you get to be at a certain time at a certain place for two weeks what would you do
S0022	erm
S0023	i better think about my own answer actually
S0022	that's really that's really interest well in some ways i'd like to go and visit an earlier period in history
S0023	mm
S0022	oh i'll tell you what it'd be nice it'd be nice to well i be go to say it would be nice to go to do things of biblical time
S0023	oh yeah like what
S0022	see jesus
S0023	well there you go now that would be interest
S0022	that would be fun
S0023	that would be really interest
S0022	very fun wouldn't it
S0023	you could find out some of the facts wouldn't you
S0022	mm
S0023	god that would be fun then you could come back and tell everybody what be actually true
S0022	yes
S0023	he be a very bad carpenter or he keep hit his thumb or something
S0022	ah
S0023	i don't know
S0022	um well it that's right in some ways i'd like to go back to a really really early period because i don't know about you but sometimes this sound really stupid but
S0023	mm mm
S0022	sometime with really with really early periods of history although obviously we know they're factual because you know there's evidence for them
S0023	yeah
S0022	but i kind of think well they're so far away that i can't imagine that they be real
S0023	yeah yeah yeah
S0022	i know they be but anyway
S0023	sure
S0022	but then another part of me think well it'd be nice to go when you have to a time of sort of peace and prosperity and you have a nice ruler
S0023	mm
S0022	i kind of think i'd be quite interest to to to go um say when i kind of think it's quite nice to visit around tudor time when henry the eighth be on the throne but it wouldn't really because i don't think life be particularly peaceful under him and that you're always afraid your head er your head would get chop off
S0023	yeah
S0022	erm
S0023	you don't have to live there don't forget
S0022	no
S0023	this be only a question of be there
S0022	oh oh i'm really not sure
S0023	just for just to be somewhere
S0022	um
S0023	i don't think in this in this scenario you can actually be anybody you want you can just imagine that you can visit
S0022	no
S0023	and they wouldn't see you as be a foreigner or whatever
S0022	yes
S0023	you could just witness something you could just be there and witness or be there for an atmosphere or for a a period
S0022	yeah
S0023	i suppose you could ask people question and stuff when you be there you could interact with them
S0022	yeah
S0023	as if you be a local
S0022	mm mm maybe if there be a queen on the throne
S0023	i mm mm
S0022	cos that would be maybe one of the early queen that would be really interest
S0023	really
S0022	i mean the first sort of crown queen of course be elizabeth the first so that you know would be quite interest
S0023	yeah
S0022	anyway
S0023	yeah then you'd be round er the period of shakespeare imagine that
S0022	ooh
S0023	imagine see one of shakespeare's play put on for the first time wouldn't that be incredible
S0022	that would be interest yeah
S0023	yeah cos i that's i hadn't think of that but i'd love to see people like richard burbage put forward his
S0022	oh yeah that would be really good yeah
S0023	just like in shakespeare in love but the real thing you know with the first presentation
S0022	yeah
S0023	cos he write you know shakespeare write the play with these people in mind as actors
S0022	yeah
S0023	he write it for them because he know their strengths and want to show them off and vice versa
S0022	okay
S0023	that would be amaze actually
S0022	yeah
S0023	yeah that's true i have a think but i'm not quite sure how it would work out it'd be really cool i'd have love to have be around when the moon land be happen
S0022	ooh yeah that would be bliss
S0023	the the ideal thing be to want to be on the moon yourself but i don't think that's include in the question
S0022	no
S0023	it's not like be the astronaut the best you could hope for would be say camp out at cape canaveral or where ever it be watch the rocket go off er and so on that would be that would be cool
S0022	but can you imagine how their wive must have felt er and their families they must have be
S0023	stress out
S0022	absolutely ah
S0023	and all the tv coverage and some of the press it must have be very difficult
S0022	yeah it must have be a nightmare but i don't think you know those program that be on a couple of years ago
S0023	yeah yeah
S0022	i don't think many of them manage to survive unfortunately
S0023	no
S0022	um
S0023	no but there be a lot of pressure lot of pressure on them
S0022	oh and there be this huge i think when they come back from the moon the men be all like sort of celebrities and oh the temptation
S0023	the trouble be when more time go on like that when no one else have be there the more it's sort of hype up
S0022	yeah
S0023	because it be still exceptional what they've do even the chinese and russians and everyone else haven't do it yet no one's do it and it's nearly forty years ago now
S0022	oh sorry go back to the last period
S0023	mm
S0022	sorry i'm change the subject now
S0023	that's alright
S0022	you know go back to the period in history we're still on the same question actually
S0023	yeah yeah
S0022	when i um use to teach there be a question we use to do a similar thing to these to promote conversation and there be a question
S0023	mm mm
S0022	that say if you slightly different if you could go back in history and change one thing what would it be
S0023	oh yeah
S0022	and i hadn't think of this but almost everyone say and now say what you think they would say
S0023	they would say er kill adolf hitler as a
S0022	yes
S0023	yes i know that
S0022	i i didn't think of that but they all say they would kill adolf hitler or stop him be bear
S0023	yeah that wouldn't make any difference unfortunately
S0022	i never think of that well
S0023	he be very very bad person but the ideas if you know enough about german history which i arrogantly i think i do have read the ominous parallel there be someone someone else would have come in to
S0022	oh yeah
S0023	maybe not quite with as much charisma but they want the the the it be such a statused institution germany it be and he be just pick up the atmosphere and the er the sort of preparation that have be go on for age
S0022	mm
S0023	so um he be in the right place at the right time no doubt about it but you know the nazi party wasn't him and everyone go oh hitler's so brilliant and so strong i hadn't think of that no no no they all want to do what he do
S0022	oh
S0023	which um be essentially about make germany bigger for the sake of it
S0022	mm how be we do for time by the way oh twenty minutes and six second
S0023	yeah why don't we do one more just to sort of give a bite extra
S0022	okay
S0023	do a quick one
S0022	um be it you or me
S0023	you
S0022	erm oh okay right here's right you get a minute to answer this question
S0023	yep
S0022	if money be no object what er kind of party would you throw and where
S0023	what kind of party
S0022	yeah
S0023	i would throw a party in outer space
S0022	i think you'd say that
S0023	or at least be in the light atmosphere if anyone want to be practical perhaps in a space station yeah there you go so i would take my friends up to the space station and we'd have jelly and ice cream float about the cabin and the fun would be try to eat it without make a total mess and then the rest of the fun would be look out of the window and go that's amaze and then the other fun would just be float about that's what i'd do yours
S0022	okay well what what spring to mind when i be read that alice king book she write about um a party i think it be for and they be somewhere like versailles
S0023	ah
S0022	or i just have this i have this vision of this sort of beautiful summer even everyone look gorgeous
S0023	mm mm
S0022	in beautiful garden in france
S0023	oh okay
S0022	with load of champagne but i also think a bouncy castle would be
S0023	you could have a fair size bouncy castle
S0022	yeah
S0023	you can have a like make up one
S0022	yeah there you go
S0023	that's a brilliant one i think that's enough now
S0022	okay that's probably enough of that isn't it
S0023	jolly good
