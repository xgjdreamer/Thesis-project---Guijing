S0398	er about it be just before midnight
S0392	oh right they like to get it count quickly then
S0398	yes
S0392	yeah well they tend to go labour anyway so i wouldn't
S0398	yes
S0392	imagine there's much dispute there they will be one of they will be one of the safest labour seat actually will they
S0398	yes i would definitely think so
S0392	yeah and then do they all sort of be there a bite of a gap before the next ones or do that
S0398	yes but not too bad one follow pretty quickly after but not that quickly
S0392	okay i see and who be it at sunderland now do you know it oh here we be be sunderland oh
S0398	yes i know it be a lady but she hasn't be very prominent at all
S0392	mm no they will change all the boundaries again soon
S0398	mm
S0392	because they like to do that don't they when do you get your postal vote
S0398	i er just get another one send this morning for the local elections
S0392	of course
S0398	and one for general elections and i think it it tell me when it will be about another fortnight before they
S0392	oh okay i would like to see what the the sheet look like with everyone on
S0398	it's in the kitchen
S0392	oh
S0398	yeah because er say to me yesterday they've send another one out and i just accept that and i think what a waste but when i look i've get a second one today but it be for local
S0392	yeah yeah

S0392	i think they either do get us we may as well if we be go to be there do one
S0398	mm well yes
S0392	we may as well do the other at the same time yeah
S0398	but then again older people might get might get a bite confuse
S0392	yeah oh of course yeah erm what turnout what do you think that will be like do it tend to be high or low
S0398	i think it'll be it will be the older people that'll go out and make the effort
S0392	yep
S0398	i would like to see more younger people
S0392	cos there be a lot of people who can't make their mind up
S0398	yes
S0392	and will just say no
S0398	there's a lot of people who can't be bother
S0392	yeah that's not good
S0398	but i be please that younger people in school be take
S0392	yeah because our school have have the candidates in
S0398	yes and younger people be get more involve in politics
S0392	yeah
S0398	which be a good thing
S0392	that's what we want you can see here there's more younger mps as well it be not all the same
S0398	yes
S0392	mm then because in the scottish referendum there be quite a high turnout there
S0398	yes
S0392	with a lot more younger people get involve
S0398	yes
S0392	which be a good thing
S0398	well yes it be their future
S0392	exactly i don't think we'll see something like that anymore for a long time whether it's in or out cos that the wales woman be say that she want something similar to that for wales sometime
S0398	yes
S0392	she say there's no reason we can't be friends but different countries that's what she say she come across quite well last night

S0398	yes
S0392	and that fella afterwards say that nicola sturgeon win the scottish they say
S0398	really
S0392	most people think she perform the best
S0398	oh i don't know who be say oh cos there be no mention of it in today's paper but i think
S0392	i think all the
S0398	they be all the same
S0392	all the poll say something different really you can't tell can you
S0398	i felt sorry for them stand all the time
S0392	yes
S0398	they must have be tire
S0392	they get a break halfway through
S0398	yes
S0392	but apart from that
S0398	yes yes
S0392	but that wasn't long either just a few advert
S0398	erm everything go very nice explain what they be do and what they
S0392	yeah
S0398	be want to do
S0392	be there anymore debate or be that
S0398	i've no idea
S0392	i think there be one that they be go to have a three
S0398	like they do last time
S0392	yeah
S0398	yes
S0392	but er cameron didn't want to have one on one with miliband that's why they have that thing the other week
S0398	yes
S0392	where paxman just give them the question
S0398	yes miliband come over alright but er i don't think he have what it take
S0392	no
S0398	to be
S0392	it will be really close to call
S0398	yeah absolutely i think his brother be the better of the two
S0392	at speak to people appeal to people yeah
S0398	yes and he be a big favourite of tony blair's because the night that tony blair fly fly down

S0392	what happen what happen to david miliband
S0398	he's he go over to the over to america
S0392	yeah
S0398	and he do quite a bite there but apparently he be get more friendly now with his brother
S0392	oh that's good
S0398	there's a possibility he might be come back but i don't know whether
S0392	cos if
S0398	it would be as a politician
S0392	be he go to be stand in the as an mp
S0398	i don't well not at the moment no because that would makenews wouldn't it
S0392	yeah it would so he won't be in the cabinet then
S0398	i think he be it be that way i know
S0392	he be somewhere around there wasn't he yes
S0398	and this er er because we stay up that night
S0392	yeah
S0398	when he say who be take down
S0392	because now be
S0398	oh right
S0392	it say here i'm see if there's any other people that i recognise on here be quite famous from isn't he
S0398	yes yes
S0392	but he be not stand this time erm like ours isn't stand this time and she's quite oh william hague obviously he's really well know within
S0398	yeah but he's retire isn't he

S0392	oh yeah
S0398	in politics
S0392	yeah he be but he be the leader at one point wasn't he
S0398	yeah but then i don't think he have what it take either
S0392	nah his people didn't like him nowadays it's get to be somebody who come across well on the tv hasn't it
S0398	yeah and you have get to have personality and lack passion
S0392	not good
S0398	no
S0392	it could be then if you take away the podiums it could be any of the same people speak
S0398	yeah yes
S0392	it be not how it use to be
S0398	i once go to a a meet outside and the mayor elect the council be beat by a socialist
S0392	gosh i bet that be big news
S0398	and people scream it have never not be know before and they be delight
S0392	mm yeah
S0398	but if that passion be lack
S0392	it be that yeah people just yeah lack of it say here that they've do a whole page on how it could prove crucial in the fight for control
S0398	right
S0392	or it be quite marginal
S0398	yes
S0392	it could define the election and they've get this fella call go against who i presume be the labour one
S0398	yes
S0392	yeah
S0398	he be a young fellow i believe
S0392	he look like it yeah i'm look at the result from last time gosh it be very close very close indeed mind you back then the bnp be stand i don't think they will be have any at all
S0398	will they not
S0392	i can't well i can't see them have many
S0398	no
S0392	because they haven't be on any of the
S0398	no
S0392	no they're finish they've all migrate to ukip now i think
S0398	i think ukip will get quite a few vote but
S0392	i can't see them take too many seat though
S0398	no i can't but er
S0392	mainly around the south east like in kent and right on the
S0398	yes
S0392	where they have get a couple now on the estuary
S0398	and it be immigration there isn't it that get the vote when you get the vote there
S0392	that seem to be the watch him last night he seem to that be his only policy wasn't it really whenever he speak it be about health tourism or something like that
S0398	yes
S0392	the turnout at stockton be sixty seven point four percent last time around
S0398	mm
S0392	i i think that will probably go down if anything
S0398	possibly yeah
S0392	it will be interest to see what the weather's like because that can have a big effect on
S0398	yeah
S0392	mm because if it be rain people don't want to go outside
S0398	and they've get to have people ready to give lift to elderly people who want to vote that can't go and vote because
S0392	oh that's a good idea
S0398	yes and i saw it happen once
S0392	yeah
S0398	and er the labour man er i be look for i think it be 's plan
S0392	mm
S0398	and say well you send somebody around
S0392	yes
S0398	and i be very disillusion he didn't
S0392	because you can vote by proxy as well can't you send someone in
S0398	yes
S0392	i'd never
S0398	but that be
S0392	i'd never trust someone to do that
S0398	that be quite a few year ago but there be no proxy vote then
S0392	oh right
S0398	and it be the labour people that want to go especially older ones and erm he didn't and that particular fellow i forget his name now he be he be elect a member of parliament and he be only there for i think it be a month but i can't remember his name i don't know what happen
S0392	mm i remember last time around the ukip candidate for this constituency die and so our constituency wait months
S0398	ah
S0392	after before it be reveal do you remember that
S0398	no i don't remember that
S0392	ah well you wouldn't have notice because you have a postal vote but the people who go to the station
S0398	yes
S0392	have to go a couple of weeks after because they have to fix up who be go to be his replacement and then adopt him and everything
S0398	right
S0392	to see if he be alright and then we all have to wait a bite and it wasn't until a few weeks after until they actually release who have win
S0398	right
S0392	obviously it be no surprise but it be interest to see the result
S0398	now we have a man he be a councillor for a lot of years a very good man he do a lot of good work and erm he ask would he help that night be home from university would he help
S0392	yeah
S0398	and he say enjoy go around and he be tell people who need cars and er the practical side of it
S0392	yeah
S0398	and erm
S0392	and then there's all the people who count up the vote as well
S0398	and who be now an mp
S0392	yeah
S0398	i think he get in that night
S0392	do he
S0398	mm
S0392	how do they count them up do they put all the ones for the same party on a pile
S0398	i've only see picture
S0392	yeah
S0398	i would love to be in there
S0392	because there must be some mistake sometimes
S0398	i would like to be there to get get the atmosphere
S0392	ah yeah it would be good
S0398	i would love that you know it would be
S0392	because i remember when they be vote for the london mayor
S0398	yes
S0392	they keep have recount and recount and it be change so there must be a lot of mistake because they be recount recount recount
S0398	yeah and they be count late at night as well
S0392	yeah and if if you be a bias counter you could either just slip one of the opposition underneath no one check it do they
S0398	no i suppose they don't no i wouldn't have think of that but yes i suppose yes
S0392	i mean there would massive fin and everything if you do do that
S0398	and i think it be a good idea the poll station be always close at nine o'clock they be close at ten now
S0392	ah that's good yeah
S0398	and that give time to
S0392	exactly yeah
S0398	run up he be always the last one because he be late in from work
