S0255	yeah
S0259	through the summer it's just leave open all the time up to about probably half past nine at night

S0255	oh know when we
S0259	so
S0255	when we be build the extension we get we have mice when we be first build this bite
S0259	mm
S0255	on the back here and we just in the end we get overrun and we didn't know how they be get in and they be just breed and breed and breed
S0259	oh god
S0255	and we actually have them so they be run round the house and it be it be ridiculous you know be there with a
S0259	wow
S0255	with a walk stick try to get them and oh it be really funny
S0259	that's like that's like pied piper
S0255	i know and it be it be because she be like you could hear it and it be just so every time you have to do anything any cook or anything you have to like disinfect all the top
S0259	oh god
S0255	and all the cooker and all the just er
S0259	yeah
S0255	it be absolutely ridiculous erm first of all we start off with the live trap cos we be all all be very good er we'll get the live trap
S0259	yeah and chuck them back out
S0255	so we'd be we'd catch them and then chuck them out and say but however they're get in they're just come back in

S0255	so then we start we'd drive round round the corner to near where the electricity pylon bits be round near
S0259	oh right
S0255	and we use to drive round there with all these trap with all the mice and let them all out and go go free little mice go free
S0255	and after about another week or so we be just totally overrun be sort of okay we've give them a chance you know we've
S0259	mm
S0255	we've take er so then we start put trap down
S0259	have to really yeah
