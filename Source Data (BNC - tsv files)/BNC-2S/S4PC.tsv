S0018	so can you explain to me what be the fifty p tax rate
S0017	the fifty p tax rate be institute i think by the labour government erm to tax people earn over a hundred and fifty thousand a year erm to try and recognise that they be suffer far less under any sort of restraints than those of us at the lower end of the scale
S0018	so what that mean they get why be call the fifty p tax rate
S0017	because they pay fifty p on every pound tax
S0018	do they have a limit tax free first so they can
S0017	yes so everybody well nearly everybody get a tax free allowance i think mine be something like eight thousand and seventy or something like that at the moment and so we all get that amount free but we be talk with your mother this morning she get her teachers' pension and she get a state pension and she get her earn and she's always worry because she end up pay a lot of tax on her teachers' pension because the state pension be taxable but they don't deduct tax from it so they have to take twice as much tax from your teachers' pension to make up for it so
S0018	where's the logic in that
S0017	it make sense it's an relatively straight forward way of do it the tax the income tax system in the country be not over complicate er the complications come in all the provision and allowance and offset and things around it
S0018	so why won't they why if it's taxable they don't deduct tax from it
S0017	because it's an interest question i don't know the true answer i guess it be that it be much simpler for the pension the state pensioner part of the organisation just to pay out an an amount on a regular basis rather than have to do any computations so they know how much pension you're entitle to each week so they pay out that amount every week and leave the individual to sort out her tax so
S0018	and how do one sort out one's tax in this country
S0017	it depend on how you're get your income if you're employ in a company and you receive a wage or salary then it be your employer's responsibility to calculate and deduct the tax and pay it over to the inland revenue
S0018	mm mm uh huh
S0017	erm if you be self employ it be then your responsibility to estimate in advance how much income you're go to have and calculate from that how much tax you're go to be due to pay and to make payments on account so that you don't end up have a massive tax arrears
S0018	okay and if you be employ by a company and you're pay a wage do you still have to declare your tax every year or do some kind of form fill
S0017	the you if you have very straight forward income in other word just a wage or salary from employment from one employment then it be very likely they won't ask you to complete a tax return every year
S0018	tax return that's what it's call yeah
S0017	if you have yeah if you have erm investment income erm somebody pay you rent for a property then you have different class of income that be all tax under different rule and then you would have to complete a tax return so that they can sort out what code to give to your employers to deduct tax and what arrangements you have to make about any other income that you're earn and you would then have to make payments on that
S0018	mm hmm
S0017	and your expect to estimate ahead and make payments on account not just wait until the end of a year and work out how much you've earn and then pay the tax on that afterwards so be employ by somebody else be from a tax point of view the simplest way of deal your tax affairs if you don't have lot of other source of income
S0018	erm if you're earn like twenty grand
S0017	mm
S0018	apart from aside from the eight thousand tax free or whatever
S0017	yeah
S0018	how many pence in the pound will you be pay
S0017	you you'd be pay if you be earn twenty thousand and you've get eight thousand tax free allowance then you're tax on twelve thousand and you pay twenty percent on that which be
S0018	er that's not to bad
S0017	yeah twenty four hundred mm
S0018	and if you're three thirty thousand
S0017	then you would still only pay at twenty percent i think the limit above which you start pay forty percent be thirty four thousand something like that
S0018	oh okay
S0017	erm so so you have to have an income of forty two thousand before you start pay forty percent tax because you then take off from your gross income your tax free allowance
S0018	that's a big jump though isn't it sorry wait there so once you get above thirty six thousand a year you get forty percent you have to pay forty percent tax
S0017	once you're earn
S0018	so once you're earn forty four thousand forty two what do we say thirty four or thirty six
S0017	i can't give you the specific amount i'm work from memory but in general
S0018	okay but do you mean do you mean on top of the eight thousand tax free
S0017	yes yeah
S0018	oh so you would have to be earn forty two thousand a year to
S0017	yeah before before you start pay tax at forty percent
S0018	oh okay
S0017	and you pay tax at forty percent on your earn above that so you still pay tax on your basic amount less after your free pay at twenty percent
S0018	huh what what's free pay
S0017	the tax free allowance
S0018	uh huh oh okay so that's eight thousand
S0017	it's also call free pay it's the same as there be different word that mean the same thing
S0018	er so but then you'd pay a certain amount up to twenty thousand a a certain amount of twenty percent
S0017	no you'd pay yes
S0018	oh so that so for example
S0017	so every everything up to thirty four thousand you'd pay twenty percent everything above that you'd pay forty percent
S0018	ah okay
S0017	you don't suddenly go on to pay everything at forty percent
S0018	oh right that's what i think be the deal that seem quite logical
S0017	mm and then the tax code that they give you if they work out that you're due to pay something like mm fourteen thousand pound in tax then they would give you a tax code and that tax code then refer to table and tell you you can work out the monthly amount of tax or the weekly amount of tax you're go to have to pay just from that code
S0018	and do that work
S0017	without have specific figure i couldn't describe it
S0018	but do that tax code work it out for the future or for the retrospectively
S0017	it work it out it's essentially short term future
S0018	mm mm
S0017	in other word it will work within a tax year
S0018	hmm
S0017	as long as you stay within the bound if you if you for the first half year you're earn twenty thousand and if the second half year you're earn seventy thousand then it wouldn't cope with that erm you would end up with have either an over or an under payment by the end of the year
S0018	hmm and when they send you notification of a tax rebate
S0017	mm mm
S0018	be that something that be generate from some kind of form that you have to fill in
S0017	not always sometimes if you're aware that you have over pay tax you can make a claim for a tax rebate
S0018	mm mm
S0017	normally the tax rebate come because the inland revenue calculate your tax at the end of the year from a tax return and find that you have pay more because they have estimate you would pay more and your tax code be set higher for example when i stop
S0018	hmm
S0017	pay higher rate tax they still assume i would be pay higher rate tax so my code be set on that basis so i end up get a tax rebate at the end of the year
S0018	and be that the end of the calendar year or financial
S0017	no the end of the tax year which end on the fifth of april each year
S0018	right
S0017	it's not like some well there be load of countries that do work their tax year to match the calendar year
S0018	hmm but do they also generate those tax rebate if you haven't do a tax return if you be in a situation where you be supposedly be pay a wage by a an employer
S0017	if they will normally send you the statement at the end of the year erm say this be how we compute your tax code for next year
S0018	mm mm
S0017	and that would give you a clue as to whether you in fact have over or under pay it's only if they acknowledge they have make a mistake in your cod for some reason and discover it erm that they would then possibly make a rebate without you claim
S0018	hmm
S0017	so it's always wise to keep an eye on your tax and make sure that you're pay roughly the right amount of tax
S0018	yeah and what other things be take into account because in spain i know it's er things like if you be rent or if you're pay a mortgage if you've make a charitable donation if you blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
S0017	mm when we be first marry we use to get mortgage interest tax relief i don't think that's give to anybody at all now
S0018	hmm
S0017	erm i know it be reduce substantially and there may be some small element erm but i don't know if you're pay into a pension privately rather than through your employment then you get tax relief on your pension contributions if it's a recognise pension that you're pay into
S0018	so do that mean that the amount that you're pay into your pension get it do that that amount doesn't get tax
S0017	correct
S0018	right
S0017	it get tax when they pay you your pension not time
S0018	they'll get you in the end
S0017	yes but that's i be argue with your mother over this this morning she be get all up tight that she's get tax on state pension and we've pay for it and so it be basically it's the same for everybody other than the extremely rich who can find ways around pay tax on all their moneys erm the rest of us pay very much the same sort of tax my mother one of the reason she go to australia be because she hat the tax system over here
S0018	why
S0017	erm mainly because i think she didn't fully understand it
S0018	ah
S0017	and just think it be unfair the tax that she pay on a fairly small income when she be work after my dad die
S0018	why be she pay why be she not happy with what she be pay
S0017	she just think it be not right that as a widow and do a a job and earn a relatively small amount that she shouldn't be pay tax on it so she use to get all work up about it
S0018	but be it i mean be
S0017	we're all in the same boat
S0018	but she still get her tax free sum and then and then i imagine that the tax that she pay be calculate in the band of her earn no
S0017	oh yes yes yes oh yeah she wasn't treat any differently to anybody else who work or be in employment
S0018	so why do she feel it be unfair
S0017	erm just
S0018	just because she be a widow
S0017	there be never a completely logical reason for it just like there be never a completely logical for your mother get upset about it so
S0018	oh there's women for you
S0017	that's right yes one of the things arguments that's go on in the background at the moment we may hear more about it today in the budget be erm this child allowance when you be bear and when be bear we be your mother use to be able to go to the post office and draw a child allowance every week and she have a a book with coupons in and
S0018	mm yeah
S0017	erm they're now try to restrict child allowance to families earn less than the twenty percent tax rate entitle you to
S0018	well i agree
S0017	so say that anybody who be pay tax at forty percent should not have
S0018	so anyone earn anyone earn over forty two grand say
S0017	yeah but that then discriminate if you have a husband and wife both work both earn say thirty thousand so together their income be sixty thousand they would get child allowance but a husband and wife or a couple live together where the husband be earn forty two thousand say and the wife be not earn anything they would loose the child allowance so i can understand the arguments that it's unfair
S0018	uh huh well i mean we despite be you know the era of single parent families and stuff it's still assume that the kid go to have two parent so why don't they just do it like calculate it on the basis of what the parent earn together
S0017	mm yes well that's that be my thoughts of the solution to it again go back quite a few years it we use to have the option of couple could opt to be tax the wife tax with the husband so that their income be consider jointly and what they ought to do be say erm for parent who be receive child benefit they should be have the option of say we wish to be tax as a couple rather than as two individuals
S0018	hmm
S0017	most of the time it be an advantage for people to be tax as individuals but if they're decide to tax or limit child allowance to those pay the lower rate of tax then the couple ought to be able to use their individual free pay
S0018	hmm
S0017	you know tax free allowance because if a woman stop work or if either partner stop work and have no income they effectively loose that eight thousand odd tax free allowance
S0018	yeah
S0017	so it make sense it's more equitable
S0018	mm
S0017	if they be able to use their tax free allowance even if they're not work
S0018	complicate run a country isn't it
S0017	yes
S0018	and what do you think about the fifty odd abolition of the fifty percent ie the fifty p tax
S0017	i i i do not believe that pay ten p a pound more in tax whether it's the difference between forty p and a fifty p rate at a hundred and fifty thousand make people decide not to invest in businesses not to start new businesses erm or to want to leave the country
S0018	mm
S0017	i don't believe that be sufficient motivation to make people make those decisions so i think the arguments about it be spurious
S0018	mm so you'd keep it
S0017	yes in the present in the present climate i wouldn't change it
S0018	hmm
S0017	i i think it be an unnecessary argument and it's be make into a political argument but it's not it it's spurious again
S0018	it's quite heavy though have to pay half of your income
S0017	there be people pay in excess of eighty percent of their income of tax in the days when i first start work i wasn't one of them
S0018	blimey
S0017	yeah
S0018	you're just a slave then you might as well be on jobseeker's benefit stack shelve at tesco's
S0017	ah well i'd cut that
S0018	and what do you think about the other measure that they're erm allow more tax free chunk of money for
S0017	i i agree with erm improve increase the tax free allowance at the lower rate they have i can't remember which government introduce it and it be probably ten or twelve years ago they introduce a ten p tax rate and that make sense it give more relief to people that they be the lower end of the scale
S0018	but shouldn't everybody just pay fifteen percent of their earn in tax
S0017	mm
S0018	isn't that fair
S0017	we we be in a welfare state and the money have to come for the welfare state it's not reasonable for somebody who can barely exist on their income to pay the same because they end up pay a much higher proportion for cost because they be both tax and pay national insurance
S0018	true hmm
S0017	erm so i agree with the lower level incomes be tax at a lower rate and people who be earn more be tax at a high rate i don't believe that a fifty percent tax rate be a disincentive to people start and run businesses erm move on from that i think it be outrageous that people who be risk other people's money in other word you know senior managers in business be risk nothing but their career should be pay these obscene bonuses and share deal and so on
S0018	yeah
S0017	erm at one time i have some sympathy for the view that everybody who work to their maximum ability whether they be sweep the road or run a business should earn the same and i think that's almost a communist
S0018	you little communist
S0017	yes reds under the bed erm but i why should somebody whose skills enable them to manage thousands of people be greater than somebody whose skills enable them to manage a broom you know there should be a small increase for responsibility but the main payment should be for effort and the effort proportional to their ability
S0018	yeah if you say that there should be a reward for ability that kind of go against what you say earlier because it you know people aren't bear
S0017	there should be when i say for ability for degrees of responsibility there should be some reward
S0018	mm mm
S0017	but it it have get totally out of proportion
S0018	yeah i agree
S0017	yeah i i think that a a bonus of fifteen percent of anybody's salary be a perfectly adequate erm motivate reward
S0018	hmm i think i think it's important because know human nature we're motivate by incentive and in this kind of society i think we be motivate by money because that's that help you buy things and people seem to want to buy things more than they want to be morally competent
S0017	yeah no i only agree to a limit extent different people be drive more or less by money but for me the amount of money at the end of the day as long as i've get enough to pay my mortgage and have a holiday and run a car and so on have never be that critical
S0018	hmm
S0017	erm what i object to be where i think erm i be be unfairly discriminate against and i remember have a long discussion when on another occasion and i be out in america in a company in america and he i know salary review have be do and i ask him what mine be and i think it be unfair and i say l think that be unfair
S0018	what have he give you a a rise
S0017	a much lower rise than i believe be merit and i believe be reflect in what others on the same sort of level and the same sort of responsibility be get
S0018	hmm mm
S0017	and i make it very clear that i think it be personal and ultimately it prove it be
S0017	erm but i i didn't erm have make that objection i then sort of just carry on as normal it didn't affect my work because i enjoy the job i be do and that i think be a much greater motivate factor than the money
S0018	yeah true and i see what you mean but i think if if you take away the incentive of a little bite more money for more responsibility there would be a lot of people that weren't motivate to go for it i think it would be nice if we could all live in a world where everyone be the same and everybody be treat the same but i think that a lot of
S0017	mm i yeah
S0018	i mean for example scientists and people who have a passion for a certain field will get their you know their recompense at their how do you say it their erm
S0017	mm reward for their abilities
S0018	their yeah they'll get their reward from from the scientific discoveries and scientific investigation and er kudos in their field as oppose to get the money
S0017	yeah
S0018	and i don't think money there be so much of a of an incentive and your musicians who do it out of love of music and you know but
S0017	but i i think there be i i think in in each of those categories you've describe and in the rest of the categories of people you will find there be those who enjoy their job and who work well because they enjoy it there be those
S0018	but maybe what i be say be that maybe a lot of the cut edge things that we've get the improvements in technology then again do we really need them have bring have come from an incentive to earn money and to make as much money as possible
S0017	i i would i would be very interest if it be possible to get statistics on that
S0018	mm
S0017	i i would believe that a higher proportion would come from those who be motivate by the search rather than by what they be be pay for the search
S0018	but a lot of people would be do it to be pay the money that their whole would be
S0017	erm even if you look at entrepreneurs erm start businesses i don't i don't think many of them would be motivate by just be able to earn unlimited amount of money base on the success of their venture because they be also take a risk erm difficult to put into word i think in in our community as many people other than those who consider work to be a drudge and go in and just want to switch off when they get there go through the day come away as soon as the bell go erm be have once get into the job and get to the point where they're manage to live or just manage to live on the money they get i don't think their effort be go to change much long term for the opportunity of get more money
S0018	hmm yeah i guess you've get a broad spectrum of personalities and how they react to motivation incentives and
S0017	hmm yeah and ambition irrespective of motivation elsewhere they motivate themselves because they want to do more and more and more
S0018	hmm
S0017	the more they learn the more they see the opportunities of do more things not necessarily in term of generate money but in term of get satisfaction from the job
S0018	hmm
S0017	be this a convenient point to pause how many have we do
S0018	yeah just a little bite more
S0017	mm
S0018	erm so yeah it be more important to get a job that you enjoy than one that you that pay a lot of money but what do you think be a necessary salary nowadays to be able to say what you know to be able to provide for a family to run a car to pay a mortgage to have a holiday once a year
S0017	er lot depend on where you're live and how much you can get your basic accommodation for and whether you're do it as an individual or as a family
S0018	hmm
S0017	erm if it be a family i would say you probably need a joint income of thirty thousand to be able to have some form of house car holiday
S0018	and as a single person to be able to afford a house and a car and a holiday once a year
S0017	oh fifty thousand a year
S0018	fifty thousand be you joke
S0017	well single people have a much more expensive lifestyle than couple
S0017	erm i the the whole thing be you you can manage to have all those things at most level say above twenty four thousand erm depend on how you manage your life
S0018	hmm
S0017	erm
S0018	and do you imagine that you'll be spend a third of that on your accommodation because obviously in some areas accommodation be a lot more expensive than that
S0017	yeah yeah obviously but that be that be probably the biggest variable of the things where you have no choice you've get to have somewhere to live somehow whereas with food you can eat cheap you can eat expensive
S0018	hmm
S0017	erm holiday you can have economic and be expensive cars you can go and have a new car when you when your other one get dirty
S0017	it it's very difficult to say what be an acceptable live wage
S0018	hmm hmm
