S0018	uh huh
S0093	but when you've get a camera in your face
S0018	yeah
S0093	which i've do to people all my life
S0018	mm mm
S0093	it's a really different experience
S0018	why be it cos it's daunt
S0093	yeah
S0018	the fact that you're visually
S0093	no it's not daunt it's more of a ego no er well ego be a bite strong it's more of a it's more i suppose
S0018	be it my best side
S0093	yeah it be yeah how do i look what do i you know not that i'm that narcissistic now please don't get me wrong
S0093	er you know i haven't get much to work with but erm but you do worry you know how's my you know i've do i have spinach er er you know or do i
S0093	what do i eat before wait have i do this have i and then you're conscious of what you're do as well
S0018	mm
S0093	be you wave your hand and
S0018	mm
S0093	and be you shuffle around and and whenever the worst be when you're stand do an interview
S0018	mm
S0093	be interview stand and suddenly yeah what do you do with your hand cos usually it's just a you know a relative close up
S0018	uh huh
S0093	on your face and possibly shoulder erm and er hand you still you know i do er this a lot anyway
S0093	and this for the microphone be me wave my hand around gesticulate but erm when you're on camera so i've learn to just put my hand in my pocket and try and stay still but you know just er er be yourself
S0018	mm mm
S0093	that's that's the thing so it's an interest experience
S0018	it be very
S0093	when the table be turn
S0018	mm well the table have now have turn but don't worry i'm only record you your voice
S0093	yes
S0018	there's no hide camera anywhere
S0093	it's erm
S0018	i be read an interest article the other day
S0093	yep
S0018	about how the the line between radio and tv be be blur because like in a lot of radio station they'll be erm webcasting
S0093	yes that's right yeah
S0018	a visual of the programme be make
S0093	yeah i can think of nothing more tedious
S0018	ha i know
S0093	why would people want to go onto a website and watch people sit across a table talk
S0018	i know
S0093	you know it's it's not the most visual of of you know
S0018	it's not
S0093	erm er but you know it's part of the interactive thing i suppose
S0018	yeah
S0093	which be all the the you know which be the future i guess of television radio whatever
S0018	mm
S0093	but television have be dumbed down an awful lot i work in documentary and current affairs
S0093	i do i've do a lot of tonight program on itv which
S0018	mm that's
S0093	for itv be be still they're still well make
S0018	mm mm
S0093	erm i've do a lot of stuff for the bbc but even within the bbc within channel four erm forget the cable cos that's really dumbed down but er everything be
S0018	yeah
S0093	be just cheaper now
S0018	yep
S0093	you've get to get to the story quickly you can't let the audience work it out for themselves you know and i
S0018	mm
S0093	blame the x factor and program like that i'm sad to say but um i hate the x factor er with a vengeance erm and er and that type of thing it's just get too
S0018	i agree
S0093	well it's almost dictate culture now
S0018	yeah yeah
S0093	and it's so i find it wrong because the x factor for example i know i know i've meet a lot of musicians i know a lot of musicians who have work and slave away and do all this sort of stuff and then x factor it's it seem to be able yes you've get the overnight success for some people
S0018	mm
S0093	but obviously a lot of them have be struggle for years and it be a great way for them to get onto telly onto television where they wouldn't be able to usually
S0018	mm mm
S0093	but there's a lot of there there it seem to encourage the fact that all you have to do be get up and sing a song in tune
S0018	mm
S0093	all be it well actually think about it there's be a lot of a lot of accusations that they don't sing in tune and they've be retuning it
S0018	yeah
S0093	in the edit process and even live they've be actually you know so they've pick the face already that's gonna fit
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0093	whether they can sing or not and that's dreadful but also it's erm it's not encourage people to actually write songs as well the creative process of write
S0018	yeah yeah
S0093	songs albums you know and actually create fan
S0018	mm
S0093	through your own voice literally go you your your own voice but also what you want what you have to say have be heavily dissipate i think we've always have those girl boy band back to the bay city rollers and whatever else
S0018	mm mm
S0093	but whereas someone like take that who gary barlow ironically be on x factor
S0093	it be a manufacture band but god they be talented er within their
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0093	you know collectively and er individually
S0018	also the whole thing about celebrity er nowadays isn't it than as in you're not you're not revere if you've get talent it's just anything that will sell whether they've get a talent or not
S0093	you don't have to have a talent to be revere and that's that's exactly it yeah
S0018	that's er i think that's the problem with nowadays like celebrity and music and
S0093	yeah
S0018	the whole media agenda
S0093	well what i find
S0018	but obviously it's be that it's be dictate by policies come down from above by fat cat at the top who want
S0093	well it be yeah yeah
S0018	to control what people be
S0093	simon cowell make a very very good live from from all this
S0018	oh he make me cringe
S0093	well it's all about that's what it's all about
S0018	yeah
S0093	he size people up and bang they're go within three months after that
S0018	mm
S0093	some some have make it a bite bigger but not many
S0018	hmm
S0093	will young of course have do very well not through x factor but by through pop idol or whatever it be
S0018	mm
S0093	um alexandra alexander berk alexandra berk um what be the be the boy band er not jls one one direction or something
S0018	i don't know i be er i don't know whether i should be thankful but i've kind of miss all of this
S0093	yeah you be
S0018	i've miss the past fourteen years of
S0093	be very thankful be afraid be very afraid
S0018	culture
S0093	er but i yeah i i really despair at the fact that also the the audience have become almost americanise as well
S0018	mm
S0093	so whether you they get up and so somebody stand up and sing a dreadful song a a cover version or whatever it's never their own song and um and do it really badly still you get this whoop
S0018	mm
S0093	scream from all the all the fan as it be
S0093	whether it's good bad or indifferent so it's just the fact that if you get on stand up and you're on television you're a celebrity you're big you're huge you're er talented
S0018	yep yep
S0093	oh my god you must be wonderful and it's not the case you know
S0018	but do you not think that there's that in a way there's you know a positive effect from that in that the backlash against well the backlash that's take place because of the manufacture
S0093	mm
S0018	the easiness of manufacture
S0093	yeah
S0018	hit and profit as oppose to actually er promote real talent
S0093	well it it's
S0018	cos that's that come about in the er er the the time where er social network be really take off and lot of people actually make their
S0093	yeah the famous one be erm rage against the machine
S0018	mm mm yeah
S0093	and there be this big facebook i think er campaign
S0018	oh that's right abouts yeah
S0093	to get this one song it's no it be chris the christmas number one and and they've succeed and it be brilliant
S0093	this song which it must have be about fifteen years old and it be i can't remember what the song be call now but it be something very appropriate to the situation
S0093	and er you know don't fee the machine or or er er i don't know what it be something like something about along that line
S0018	mm mm
S0093	and it be that be brilliant yeah
S0018	mm
S0093	but that be just a small individual you know
S0018	yes
S0093	unfortunately what i worry about be my be my nieces and the like all my kid's er children who be grow up
S0018	mm mm
S0093	think this be normal you know as they be grow up with ipads and er you know this be all normal to them
S0018	mm
S0093	so what you grow up with be normal i mean to me it be scalelectrics and and lego
S0093	to my parent it be huh scalelectrics how do that work er whereas you know now there be ipads and whatever but also that celebrity be just be on television
S0018	mm mm
S0093	it doesn't matter what you can do or can't do
S0018	yeah and then music be churn into their poor little head
S0093	yeah
S0018	it's like even the pop music from from my day it be er basically michael jackson and madonna but if you actually listen to the songs there's still quite a lot of musical
S0093	oh yeah
S0018	genius in them that but nowadays
S0093	but there's still musical genius around
S0018	yeah but it's not get pump through the airways
S0093	there's lot of it no with the death of top of the pop and er and i suppose the birth of of download
S0018	mm
S0093	and and and that you don't get the band that be actually write songs that be create things that probably
S0018	mm
S0093	probably would be create new movements as well
S0018	mm mm
S0093	which be what how music always generate
S0018	yep yep
S0093	you know punk come about because of
S0018	yeah that's true actually there hasn't be
S0093	progressive rock and all that
S0018	yeah
S0093	and then from punk come scar and
S0018	mm mm
S0093	two tone and er the new wave and then as a rebellion to that come er new romanticism and then a rebellion to that become
S0018	mm
S0093	come er house er well erm garage and and acid
S0018	hmm mm
S0093	and so on and so forth
S0018	mm mm
S0093	and it be er but at the moment it's just
S0018	evolution
S0093	now we're stick at cover versions
S0018	yeah
S0093	by x factor people and that's what it be
S0018	mm
S0093	or you've get the jangly brit pop band which come about and there be too many of those as well and what they haven't have in the last five six seven years be be the the next movement
S0018	mm mm
S0093	which maybe be just wait to happen as a as i say as a
S0018	mm
S0093	backlash to to the cowell era
S0093	and i hope it do you know cos there's always you know even when we be grow up there be boy band girl band manufacture music and and culture generally but erm but it's just get too but that's take over now and that's i
S0018	yeah yep
S0093	i find it really sad it maybe make me a a victor meldrew and
S0093	and i'm proud of that
S0018	don't worry i'm a complete conspiracy theorist i think it's be do for a reason people be be dumbed down
S0093	really
S0018	in one sense while above you know all the fat cat
S0093	wow
S0018	there in their little playgrounds
S0093	yeah well
S0018	and they're er try to orchestrate
S0093	there's a classic example of say i i i i totally agree in one respect cos i what i've notice be er well blair i suppose blair and brown's children
S0018	mm mm
S0093	be now the people who be you know they're the thirteen fourteen year olds whatever and i just have a load of letter and as i do every year er thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen year olds all try to in fact er yeah and to eighteen er all try who basically who be educate over the last fifteen years
S0018	mm
S0093	who erm want work experience all of that type of thing and they cannot put a letter together and
S0018	yeah
S0093	whereas over the labour years the new labour years i should say er one of the reason why i i be in favour of the change back in ninety seven er i soon come out of favour of that
S0093	erm be that oh my god you know cos education education education and suddenly all the a level result be all as
S0018	mm yeah
S0093	oh yeah and of cause they be just bring down the level
S0018	yep yeah yeah
S0093	they be stop the great the the the high flyers as if well in term of education bring er those down to a level
S0018	mm mm
S0093	and that's what i find now with britain be that there be this level and it seem to have come from the top
S0018	mm
S0093	where whether it be erm the press or erm or what could be tell in the press what er can be actually tell to the public or whether it be culture
S0018	mm mm
S0093	television erm education it's all a bland middle grind at the moment
S0018	yep definitely
S0093	everything er reflect the weather here
S0093	and it seem to have be a deliberate thing because when i grow up there be distinctly an upper class middle class lower class
S0018	mm
S0093	work class and there be also er at school whatever school you go to whether it be public private comprehensive there be the you know
S0018	mm mm
S0093	the the the people with photographic memories the people who be genuinely fantastically you know intelligent
S0018	mm mm
S0093	and geniuses then there be the middle grind and then there be the lower grind and you know they be split
S0018	yeah
S0093	that way and it be almost like everybody know their place
S0018	mm mm
S0093	not not in a you know erm nazi sort of way but erm
S0093	there's this there's one word
S0018	but no yeah i can see what you mean
S0093	but
S0018	i mean you have aspirations
S0093	yeah
S0018	that be set out accord to your not your station in life but your
S0093	not cos you no and then there be ways to achieve you know
S0018	mm
S0093	and when i be there there wasn't university didn't cost so much there be more grant cos there be less people go
S0018	yep
S0093	so whether you come from a work class background a middle class upper class you still have pretty much the same opportunities
S0018	mm mm
S0093	let's be honest it wasn't as clear cut as that but you you you could aspire and you could get you know the american dream almost
S0018	mm mm
S0093	you know that's what we all that's what we have more of now i think it's just sort of okay everybody go to university therefore we'll bring we we'll just generate
S0018	yeah
S0093	this entire er two or three generations we'll generate generations what a terrible phrase
S0093	you can tell i'm a writer
S0093	er ha erm i've really i find dumbed down very unaspirational and
S0018	mm mm
S0093	erm quite simple people to be honest
S0018	yeah
S0093	it's an awful thing to say very sad it's very snobbish and elitist snobbish and elitist but er i don't i don't mean it to be i i will just worry for the future and i think part of that have definitely come from higher certainly not you know er simon cowell have his own motives
S0093	and the british public be sheep for the most part have just buy into it
S0018	yep
S0093	er er isn't it great watch someone do a cover version very badly er not it's not actually it's not that great
S0018	yeah but it get more sinister than that when you find out that michael gove use to be erm the henchman of er rupert murdock
S0093	yeah yeah
S0018	and that they be in cahoots what i think just before the whole shit hit the fan with the the the leveson report
S0093	leveson inquiry and that yeah
S0018	and everything that erm precede that they be in cahoots try to get a lot of what be be teach in the classroom do virtually
S0093	oh
S0018	use erm the the whole archive of the daily mail and all the
S0093	oh my god
S0018	those kind of erm paper that obviously rupert murdock
S0093	mm
S0018	be gonna charge a pretty penny for they'd actually buy in an education tsar who be er part of newsgroup international
S0093	oh my word who be this er be it cameron or
S0018	michael gove well under cameron yeah
S0093	under cameron of course yes oh that's interest
S0018	since gove have be education secretary yes
S0093	of course yes erm i wonder yeah i wonder
S0018	it's dodgy as dodgy as hell though really isn't it
S0093	i've always i i've there's one or two conspiracy good old fashion conspiracy theories that i love
S0018	mm
S0093	the moon land for example
S0093	i'm man have not be on the moon they couldn't have do be there in nineteen sixty nine in a tin can
S0093	no way and i love all that but then it get ooh too much
S0018	it do
S0093	sometimes there's er there's some great ones yeah some great conspiracy theories
S0018	the yeah bush engineer nine eleven that's um
S0093	that's a good one yeah well he know know the obamas not the obamas the erm obamas
S0018	oh bin laden
S0093	oh bin laden sorry
S0018	osama obama
S0093	yeah exactly er yes he know the he know them the families know each other very well
S0018	mm mm mm mm
S0093	and erm actually there be a lot of echo though between the moon land and whatever you know bush wasn't have a good time politically at the time
S0018	mm mm
S0093	back in sixty nine of course a lose a lose war in vietnam
S0018	yep
S0093	everyone be completely against that jfk the one of the still the one of the the all american heroes
S0018	mm mm
S0093	that have be assassinate a few years and one of the last things he say be we'll put a man on the moon before the end of the decade so part of his legacy be to you know we've gotta get we've gotta get up there
S0093	of course there be the cold war and everything else and the russians be beat them
S0018	uh huh
S0093	and then suddenly these three men go into
S0093	go through space apparently er i forget what they're call now be it the van the van something ray that occur from the from the sun
S0018	mm mm
S0093	ha er it's not van demon but it's something like that van something ray it be the er which which be basically a hundred per cent radiation
S0018	uh huh
S0093	that come out of you know solar flare from the sun and it be the highest it's ever be during the time they do erm they get through space
S0018	mm
S0093	in a tin can
S0093	er and none of them have any radiation poison basically the experts say they would have they should have die all three of them
S0018	okay
S0093	and they didn't even er they weren't even sick
S0018	uh huh
S0093	er and then there's the fake
S0018	there's a film about that isn't that the film about the
S0093	there's lot actually capricorn thirteen
S0018	that's it yeah yeah
S0093	capricorn twelve capricorn thirteen one of those two
S0018	mm mm
S0093	and erm and then there's there's a lot of prove erm a lot of the photograph be prove to be fake
S0018	okay
S0093	there's too many light source ie they they be shoot in a studio
S0018	uh huh
S0093	now that you know open up question of why why be they fake a if the the surface of the moon apparently go from in the shade it go er er out of the sun it's minus a hundred and twenty degrees
S0018	mm mm
S0093	it's something incredible to in the sun cos there's no atmosphere at er plus a hundred and twenty degrees man cannot survive on that
S0018	mm mm
S0093	on its own nor can film
S0018	mm
S0093	film would either melt or or or disintegrate
S0018	right
S0093	in the intense cold
S0018	uh huh
S0093	so and then i think it be hasselblad supply the cameras which be basically on just
S0018	mm mm
S0093	attach to the chest of the space suit and yet if you watch you look at the moon shots they be fantastic
S0018	yeah yeah
S0093	beautifully pose they're everything's do
S0018	uh huh
S0093	the er light read be just perfect amaze erm and they have this camera attach which be just they would just basically point their chest in the vague direction of whatever they be look at
S0018	smile
S0093	yeah and they all come out brilliantly but there be er there be there be a lot of anomalies within them but also i think it's hasselblad have never use in all their publicity
S0018	mm mm
S0093	in all the market and any anything they put out to the public you know share erm share issue or whatever it be they don't mention the moon
S0018	mm
S0093	which be just the most astonish thing if you if you have be the
S0018	yeah
S0093	i think kodak have a bite of that as well they didn't really push it who supply the film itself
S0018	mm mm
S0093	you know hasselblad i think it be hasselblad supply the cameras so why on earth
S0018	well on the moon
S0093	yeah
S0018	why on the moon
S0093	we be the we be the we take the picture on the moon
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0093	we be the and they don't
S0018	especially in that era because it be all about
S0093	well ever since
S0018	advertise it be become huge wasn't it
S0093	yeah and they haven't say a thing well it's they have in in the past but
S0018	mm mm
S0093	they don't go overboard with it which you just think you'd be shout from the roof top then
S0018	mm
S0093	so er and the the anomalies the the whistle blow which be suppose to have happen be fascinate to me er and that's where i really start believe that it be something else go on so anyway come back to what i be say erm why be they fake if they be fake photograph
S0018	mm mm
S0093	which most a lot of experts say they be fake some of them be fake erm why be they you know if if they just go to the moon and they the cameras didn't work the film melt or snap or whatever
S0018	uh huh
S0093	you know just that's tough and then try and lie about it and pretend that they be
S0018	uh huh
S0093	so you know they might have land on the moon but they fake the photograph
S0018	okay
S0093	but i do believe they didn't do any of that
S0018	be there move film footage as well
S0093	yes of later well there be a camera attach to erm
S0018	oh okay
S0093	the side of the er or the er of the land buggy
S0018	mm mm
S0093	er land craft er but that could you know it could you could shoot any of that in a studio
S0018	mm mm
S0093	there's no question about that erm and there be so many in the within the photograph there's one famous one where there's a if you can imagine cross hatch
S0018	mm mm
S0093	where you get the cross on on a lens
S0018	mm mm
S0093	and in those days for some reason they're not on the moon land shots have that and of course the lens be right there at the front of the front of the picture er sorry the hatch be at the front of the big cross hatch and yet there's one particular picture where there's a flag in the background something in the background and yet the cross go behind the object
S0018	ah okay
S0093	that's supposedly two hundred yards in front so you can't it can't be and that's think to have be er somebody who have just sort of place a
S0018	uh huh
S0093	little cos
S0018	wasn't there something random in a something very strange in a reflection of the helmet visor or something
S0093	yeah well there's endless ones yeah
S0018	really
S0093	yeah
S0018	be it
S0093	light there's lot of light source as well though cos it's you know they be all wear white
S0018	mm
S0093	and it's so reflective erm there be light source there's only one light source it's the sun
S0093	that's what it should be but unfortunately it's get two or three light source ie studio light
S0018	right
S0093	and also shadow as well don't make sense there's a shadow go you know one sun you get one shadow in a direct straight line and yet on some picture there's shadow at different angle and er and it's it all point to and i love this
S0093	i love it i think erm and if you look at the you know the political side of things like that
S0018	mm
S0093	and rather like the twenty er the the two thousand and one conspiracies i suppose you might have diana as well might be in there as well but there be definite question mark
S0018	mm mm
S0093	the american government have be know to lire in the past and for and for
S0018	yep
S0093	for political gain
S0018	be that like in the race against russia to be the best at everything
S0093	that be all part of it as well
S0018	and yeah
S0093	yeah they beat russia supposedly and there be er we've get telescope that can see light years ahead they can see other planets they can see other solar systems
S0018	mm mm
S0093	the moon be the nearest thing to us and yet they nobody have be able to see any of the space
S0018	mm
S0093	er any of the craft that land
S0018	mm mm
S0093	they're all in sight cos they land on this side of the moon er nobody can see anything
S0018	mm
S0093	you know which be just the most bizarre thing you know they leave a huge craft which be you know half the size of this room
S0018	uh huh
S0093	if they can see er if they can see er er a a crater on the moon
S0018	mm mm
S0093	that's the size of this build they can see the craft within it but nothing and man and of course they haven't be back to and if you look at apollo 13 with the famous tom hanks film
S0018	mm mm
S0093	how well script that be you know so nobody can tell if that actually happen or not
S0018	yeah
S0093	but the american public be really lose interest in um and and subsequently the government
S0018	uh huh
S0093	be lose interest in erm well the finance behind the er be lose interest in the space race
S0018	mm mm
S0093	cos they you know they supposedly want so apollo 13 come about you know where they
S0018	okay
S0093	sling sling shoot round and come back
S0018	ah
S0093	and that win the public back onto the side of the space race the space
S0018	politically motivate yeah
S0093	yeah and that be brilliantly do now this could all be absolute rubbish of course you know
S0018	it could be but
S0093	for me er this be for say it but i've read this one book call dark moon
S0018	uh huh uh huh
S0093	and that's what convince me before that i be like i really can't imagine they didn't
S0018	mm mm
S0093	you know what a lie that would be and erm and then i read and go they didn't
S0093	they do not land no chance
S0018	i know
S0093	and i'm convince to this day so when you mention conspiracy theories it's you've get mine
S0018	relief
S0093	but they but there be er you know there be
S0018	yeah
S0093	there's gotta be truth in some conspiracy
S0018	definitely
S0093	you know people have conspiracy theories about everything but erm but when it come to anything politically
S0018	mm mm
S0093	you know with a political agenda fabulous you know
S0018	you could believe anything though
S0093	oh yeah
S0018	that happen especially with the american government i just wouldn't trust them
S0093	yeah
S0018	as far as i could throw them
S0093	well we know that the you know a lot of er er er you know dictators have lie in the past and
S0018	what i find interest be it hugo chávez the erm
S0093	hugo chávez
S0018	be it the venezuelan president
S0093	okay
S0018	he's say that isn't it funny how all the latin american presidents over the past twenty years have die of cancer
S0093	mm
S0018	or be die of cancer and he's he have actually say it's the cia
S0093	uh huh
S0018	who have er manage to manufacture some kind of
S0093	really
S0018	cancer induce substance
S0018	and that obviously they have give to all of us
S0093	blimey
S0018	yes
S0093	er i'm i'm stagger there isn't a cure for cancer yet
S0018	mm
S0093	and of the course the the the there be just to many people on this planet now and because we don't have the world war that we use to do where there be a natural selection process as it be
S0018	cull
S0093	yeah there be yeah men and women mostly men sadly but erm and we don't have those war now
S0018	mm
S0093	so all the governments about everybody in this room everybody could do more to help the starvation problems and aid problems around africa and various other place
S0018	mm
S0093	er and that isn't be eliminate either and yet erm gaddafi er mugabe all sort of people have be give huge amount of money iran have be give huge amount of money
S0018	mm mm
S0093	korea by by the west
S0018	ah to nuke a few countries
S0093	erm afghanistan who have be at war with us annoyingly and america for the last ten years
S0018	mm mm
S0093	twelve or eleven years have er that be mostly er they be fund by american and by us you know
S0018	yeah the er the taliban be train by the cia weren't they
S0093	yes yeah so it's a very odd situation yeah
S0018	ah so your your end game there be that you reckon that they're try to get rid of a lot of people so then there's not gonna be so much war for resources
S0093	for cancer yeah through cancer it's a killer
S0018	right
S0093	well isn't it we we we manage to cure everything else pretty much but not cancer which be well we get near to it of course but
S0018	mm
S0093	er yeah
S0018	they didn't steve job though do you not think they would have save steve job if they find a cure for cancer and they be just keep it secret cos they didn't want
S0093	yeah possibly
S0093	but no i but no i think i i'm agree with you i think there be something
S0018	mm
S0093	out there that they er there be something that they er there's just something to it because they do they do protect the the sort of people they wanna protect
S0018	mm
S0093	but i think like with the possibility of ufos and all that er yeah i don't know about that stuff but there's gotta be life out there
S0093	because we be there's life here
S0018	yep
S0093	end of
S0018	i agree
S0093	you know so there have to be another planet ninety two million miles from its sun that can sustain life
S0018	i agree i mean if you think about the fact that you know the whole gestation of a child
S0093	mm
S0018	and the creation
S0093	yes
S0018	thing that's miraculous isn't it so you're think you're tell me that
S0093	yeah
S0018	life can't exist on another planet but that can happen
S0093	yeah
S0018	it just doesn't seem
S0093	no
S0018	no i agree i agree
S0093	it's just ridiculous really when you think about it and er fortunately it doesn't get to the whole god question
S0018	mm mm
S0093	if you do believe in alien and i don't believe in alien necessarily
S0093	i think there's something there's gotta be life out there
S0018	mm mm
S0093	whether it er whether they can fly here and buzz people and never actually make contact to the people that really matter it always seem to be some hillbilly that they make contact with
S0093	and and anally probe and then you know i go out i i i i go out i've have a third a close encounter of the third kind
S0093	er why didn't they come and speak to er to cameron or to obama or somebody like that or you know get a news conference go
S0018	yeah
S0093	if they really want to make contact
S0018	maybe cos they're intelligent a very intelligent life form
S0093	maybe they don't want to know at this look they look at us and go what the hell do we want with these people
S0018	they're like what stay away from them
S0093	they'll just er kill themselves off in a few minutes we'll just keep check on the planet and we can move in when they when they have destroy us but there be there's some great theories the er conspiracy theories out there and there's gotta be you know there be some truth in some things but a lot of a lot of them will be just there's a question mark over something and they think ooh
S0018	yeah exactly
S0093	but there be major ones
S0018	a lot a lot of the the purveyors of conspiracy theories i think they do grasp at straw at very tenuous link and tenuous evidence to support some certain things
S0093	well i've see documentaries
S0018	mm
S0093	and you get that you get the sort of
S0018	yeah yeah
S0093	the same type of person talk about these conspiracies
S0018	uh huh
S0093	and that's what shock me about the moon land one and the dark moon book
S0018	uh huh
S0093	cos it be so well research and
S0018	right
S0093	and they speak the it it it be all it all make sense you know question i have about diana for example
S0018	mm mm
S0093	well that could have happen you know
S0018	mm
S0093	yeah so you know the queen want her to be kill off no you know that's just ridiculous
S0093	but there be question mark over what happen and why it happen and
S0018	mm
S0093	you know certain people and erm organisations responses that don't add up you know
S0018	mm
S0093	that it's human nature that come into it but er one one thing again be that sorry to bore you with the go around with this moon thing
S0018	no no no no not bore at all
S0093	be that there be er that when they be build the craft
S0018	uh huh
S0093	to start with and go through all the research process not one company have it now that could make economic sense so the spread the spread it around so but when it come to actually make the erm the the land craft and the rocket and everything else two or three thousand company sort of so one company would manufacture a screw
S0018	uh huh
S0093	another would manufacture the hole that it go in you know well they you know what i mean
S0018	uh huh
S0093	the bracket that it go into and all that sort of stuff so no one company could say put it all together and go ah
S0018	yeah
S0093	it doesn't work
S0093	erm and there be a number of people at nasa who be sceptical about the whole thing
S0018	yeah didn't you say there be some whistle blowers as well
S0093	and they disappear yeah but then a lot of people disappear cos i mean you just remind me when you say people die of cancer who be you know
S0018	mm mm ah
S0093	the er you know the dictators
S0018	right
S0093	erm and sure enough there be a number of people who die on a lonely road in the desert
S0018	mm
S0093	car crash spin out of control bang dead
S0018	mm
S0093	who be high top scientists work with nasa who might have know er one or two things and it just become after the after sixty nine when it all happen there just there be a spate of them and it be just so coincidental
S0018	mm
S0093	it be just too much again it be pick up in this book you know and you think well why don't they go and interview the top people at nasa and say come on what happen and the other thing be that the erm the er astronauts as well don't really or didn't until these conspiracies come out er probably about ten years ago that it this book hit the shop and everyone go oh my god they might be right on that
S0093	erm but the the astronauts themselves both aldrin and neil armstrong be there but they didn't really talk about it that much
S0018	no
S0093	and it end up with somebody accuse i think it be buzz aldrin it might have be neil armstrong actually erm er with a camera say you didn't land on the moon do you you didn't and neil armstrong punch this guy in the face er like on camera it be fantastic
S0093	but he just say i've have enough of this you know of course we do you know er but before that they didn't they have never really talk about it and again if i be an astronaut
S0018	mm
S0093	who walk on the moon
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0093	i'd be i'd be tell everybody never mind what you've get to talk about
S0018	look at my picture this
S0093	you know and i just think actually yeah there's all these interest link that that maybe just fantastically educate people have put together and go huh you know
S0018	uh huh
S0093	cos it be well argue the whole thing particularly the science side of it where the three men could not have get across space without even vomit once you know
S0018	right
S0093	through radiation this radiation be a killer erm the space station er mia and all those sort of things they're not in space they're in within the earth's atmosphere
S0018	uh huh
S0093	the furthest point er but if you go into space you're gonna die basically so subsequently no apparently nobody have go into space cos we just can't survive now we probably could now with the
S0018	mm mm
S0093	technology we've get to actually you know but in nineteen sixty nine
S0018	you wouldn't be able to
S0093	no chance no chance at all no
S0018	be there a russian space exploration around that time a bite later
S0093	mm there be load yeah
S0018	be that
S0093	er yuri gagarin and people like that
S0018	yeah that's right and be that prove prove to have be fake
S0093	no there's no question mark about that because they didn't actually make it get it to the moon but
S0018	right
S0093	but it accord to this book if i remember correctly they they be genuine
S0018	uh huh
S0093	you know the russians be actually win the space race by miles
S0018	okay
S0093	and then suddenly the americans be like ooh hello we've get one ooh we've land ooh we've come back again safely
S0018	yeah right
S0093	oh right okay we've win we win ha ha ha
S0093	any more flight to the moon now no sorry
S0093	no we've be there do that and they haven't be since you know
S0018	mm
S0093	and er there's so many
S0018	mm mm
S0093	i i read that book well as i say in fact i remember read it on the on a flight to new york in two thousand and one
S0018	mm mm ooh
S0093	bizarrely yes about well a few months only a few months before nine eleven and er and i remember fly into new york and yeah read this and go gawd blimey i'd love to have a chat with a few americans about this and see what they think you know
S0093	and i do and they be all like they be you can't say that we didn't you know one guy get really aggressive
S0018	it be i guess it's a national pride issue for them isn't it
S0093	well it be yeah
S0018	it be such a
S0093	but one another guy i speak to an american
S0018	uh huh
S0093	i just say you know i can believe that the american government lie to us about everything and anything and they always have do
S0018	mm mm
S0093	and they create all these things like you know the commie thing you know the the russians you know
S0018	create al qaeda
S0093	race
S0093	al qaeda of course yeah i mean who
S0018	that's another conspiracy theory that al qaeda don't actually exist
S0093	well that'll be the next the next big one because oh well it's just too much it's just too much you know that
S0018	yeah
S0093	the er er we get you know blaire stupidly get involve as well and er
S0018	mm mm
S0093	the americans look er er you know and er they have this great i can't remember what programme it be now i be watch something the other day and somebody be slag off the american programme and er it be a chat show or something and they i think it be craig ferguson actually craig ferguson who be a scottish guy
S0018	mm mm
S0093	but now very big in america he's get his own chat show and he be he be talk to somebody erm and it might have be susan sarandon who's quite right on usually but she say something
S0018	uh huh
S0093	quite anti french and he go ooh you can't say that and she say oh well you know they didn't get er behind us with the in the war and er craig ferguson say what the war that we go to against
S0018	the illegal war
S0093	iraq who have nothing to do with nine eleven erm and might have be about oil only
S0093	and we be lie to about in the er you know yeah they have it yeah they would have be right not to go to war with us you know and er er the audience actually clap and it be quite good
S0018	oh really
S0093	yeah
S0018	american audience
S0093	an american audience actually clap
S0018	and what be er susan's response
S0093	er she go well yeah okay
S0018	be she
S0093	not the best war that type of thing
S0093	erm so she
S0018	she's quite a vocal supporter of be it democrats
S0093	well she be very yeah she's be very good at the it be more of a slip of the tongue it wasn't anti french
S0018	mm mm
S0093	you know a sort of
S0018	right
S0093	political point
S0018	yeah yeah
S0093	it be just something about the food or something
S0018	mm
S0093	something silly
S0018	freedom fry not french fry
S0093	freedom fry yeah exactly
S0093	but our special relationship drag us into a war well david kelly you know er dr david kelly be another conspiracy theory yeah
S0018	mm what happen to him well it's that one's pretty obvious really isn't it
S0093	well it would be to most people most educate people
S0018	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0093	er but it's be you know prove by erm by a jury that be pick by blair erm that that that it nothing untoward happen you know so i'm surprise cameron hasn't open it up again actually
S0018	really
S0093	i think he's get enough problems of his own though really but er
S0018	mm
S0093	yeah just as maybe it be do and dust he can't do anything about it now but cos that be there's too many question on it and again blimey really
S0018	yes
S0093	and here's this guy say no no there's nothing wrong there's no reason for us to go to war ooh i'm dead suicide be a massive apparently he wasn't that type of person you know
S0018	mm
S0093	it be a bite out of leave field as the be say
S0018	it be the time of it though wasn't it really it's
S0093	it be perfect for er some people
S0018	ah but that's why you imagine that it be some kind of oh the two things be coarsely relate must be
S0093	er it's just too
S0018	who do it
S0093	coincidental yeah that's the er coincidence can can become a great theory
S0018	mm mm
S0093	a conspiracy
S0018	yep
S0093	and there's so many coincidences in life we have them all the time
S0018	that's true
S0093	you know just me bump into someone on the street serendipity and
S0018	mm mm
S0093	you know just plain coincidences be it it can really er cloud the the mind you know
S0018	yeah

S0018	mm
S0093	will always have a market i hope current affairs
S0018	mm
S0093	documentary you know where you can actually tell a story and you can
S0018	yeah
S0093	and it might be about a celebrity it might be about something else
S0018	mm mm
S0093	so there's always a a cross over
S0018	yep
S0093	erm you know i've do i've do a lot of sport and there's always a cross over there people be ha footballers footballers oh my god oh my god
S0018	mm
S0093	erm but i do this documentary not so long well a few years ago now and and er one at some point we we talk to a group of erm well er er all sort of people about aspiration and and there be a lot of girls we talk to across the various different interview young twelve thirteen fourteen year olds
S0018	mm
S0093	who erm almost to person want to marry a footballer when they grow up
S0018	mm
S0093	that be it that's the only thing they want to do now possibly because that's what everybody be talk about at the time
S0018	mm mm
S0093	and then they've grow up since then in term of that but er i just think oh my god you know how many footballers do you think there be to go around anyway
S0093	and but that's all they really want to do and there's the whole generation of
S0018	ah
S0093	young girls
S0018	mm
S0093	in particular post feminism you see who who you know their parent grandparents or whoever have fight for the right for a woman to earn and to be in the board room and to
S0018	yeah
S0093	you know to run company and everything else and here's this whole generation be bring up now because of x factor because of the the heat magazine the celebrity thing
S0018	yeah
S0093	where it's all about how much money you've get and and i think that's really worry and there's still i sort of speak to girls here at david who all they're after be the marriage they don't
S0018	mm mm
S0093	and it doesn't matter who it's to as long as they're rich they don't care about the person
S0018	how shallow what a shame it's just isn't it really
S0093	well i i know there's a few unfortunately there's one girl friend of mine who's actually cos she be quite a friend of mine but she's but she before i know her i have to say she actually target a guy who be wealthy marry him and divorce him in two years and take half his money
S0018	blimey
S0093	yeah and she do it deliberately she's quite open about it
S0018	do he not know a thing call the prenup
S0093	well no cos you know a lot of people don't
S0018	yeah well you you don't think
S0093	i mean this be fifteen years ago

S0018	mm
S0093	a lot of my my contemporaries don't want to get marry
S0018	mm mm
S0093	because of all this the last ten years have be dreadful for men
S0018	fair enough
S0093	with marriages and divorce and everything
S0018	mm mm
S0093	and men have be absolutely clobber financially women have their own er down as well of course
S0018	mm mm
S0093	you know it's not all one side you can't but you know financially there's be a lot of gold dig and all sort of stuff
S0018	yeah yeah
S0093	and i really worry for the this generation of kid who be grow up who haven't get the quite the quite the er erm they haven't be teach you've get to work at something
S0018	yeah yeah
S0093	the the education system now be almost about you do the work the day before and you pass it that day you don't have to study
S0018	yeah definitely definitely
S0093	and really work and go over the same subject
S0018	what what most surprise me when i be in school do er the train be that kid don't have a any kind of work work ethic they they seem to come to school to widen their social circle
S0093	yeah
S0018	and that's it they're in class talk about what someone post on facebook the night before and you're like er excuse me can you kind of like pay attention now we're
S0093	yeah
S0018	try to learn this can you tell me the answer to number whatever or can you perform your little role play for me
S0093	yeah
S0018	and they're like but miss we're talk about what happen last night on facebook cos do you know do you know that this happen and this happen and it's so much more important than french and it's like
S0093	well there you go yep
S0018	you'll always i mean you'll always get that to some extent but it just surprise me as to how all pervasive it be that they didn't value learn
S0093	well the
S0018	they didn't value knowledge
S0093	no
S0018	they didn't to them they can get they don't need to store knowledge they can just go onto google and get knowledge and dispose of it and not have to process it
S0093	i interview um an eighteen year old a couple of years ago now she's probably twenty one twenty two now or something i don't know for a documentary she want to be a researcher on a programme we be do
S0018	mm mm
S0093	and i just say okay so tell me how you would go about research um and i give her i can't remember what the subject be but i give her an example how would you go about erm research this for for our purpose for television
S0018	mm mm
S0093	an hour long programme she say well i'll go onto the internet and i'll look look it up and i say
S0018	resourceful
S0093	be that your answer seriously so so basically anybody can walk in to this job and just go onto the internet and look it up and so i say so what so er you're sure everything be correct on the internet she say well most of it be i say look i think we're go the wrong way here and i don't think you're gonna get this job
S0093	i be honest with her
S0018	mm
S0093	i say can i just teach you something er for the next job for your next job interview
S0018	mm
S0093	don't ever ever say that whether you end up go on the internet or not
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0093	and you've gotta do a certain amount of internet
S0018	yeah
S0093	which i do it we all do it but you've gotta check your subject yeah check your check the reference you've gotta really be sure
S0018	definitely
S0093	and you've get to back er that up with
S0018	one of the things that i teach as er academic english like how to reference things how to research and i have a group of chinese students last year who no matter how many time i tell them they have to they have to choose valid and reliable er source to get their information from there be still wikipedia two thousand and eleven pop up in all their essay so i just show them i put it up on the
S0093	that's the worst
S0018	the screen and i choose the thickest student in the class which
S0018	obviously i didn't say okay you thickest student in the class come here but
S0093	yeah
S0018	the kind of the black sheep of the family as it be that everybody know i say okay marina let's look at globalization in china can you see anything on wikipedia about it she be like yes i say okay right now i want you to go onto edit and i want you to write the most stupid er erroneous sentence you can imagine possible about er globalization in china and so she do and we press save and er i just say okay so be you gonna use wikipedia now know that it's be edit by people like marina
S0093	oh yeah well this girl actually do say
S0018	make the point
S0093	that her she do most you know she go on wikipedia and she get all her knowledge there
S0018	mm anyway
S0093	and i try to explain to her again exactly what you just say
S0018	mm
S0093	it's incredible so you know but she that be her that be how she's be bring up
S0018	mm
S0093	cos it be just okay er i wanna work in television i don't it's almost as if she ad erm have some sort of right to just walk in and say okay i'll do that and do that
S0018	mm yeah because she
S0093	she didn't actually research the job
S0018	yeah but that's the thing i think the kid kid be kid grow up in an atmosphere whereby education's not too important what be most
S0093	yeah
S0018	what most attract their attention be commercial advertise campaign that
S0093	yeah
S0018	kind of instil in them this this attitude that they have the right to
S0093	mm
S0018	these trainers that cost this amount of money
S0093	oh yeah
S0018	and they have a right to this car that cost this amount of money and they've get no er understand of reality about what they're gonna have to do to get that amount of money
S0093	yeah yeah
S0018	and so they just expect that they have this god give right to that job or to that salary
S0093	oh it's shock britain's terrible for that er come back to what we be just say erm when you have this the girls i've mention you know about
S0018	mm mm
S0093	they wanna marry footballers cos they wanna have the lifestyle they wanna have this that and the other and there's a guy i be speak to who i go to school
S0018	mm
S0093	not so long ago and he er just just get divorce and he's forty four and er he's a car salesman all be it porche
S0018	mm mm
S0093	so he's quite you know they the the commission be quite big
S0018	mm mm
S0093	but it's a very basic and when it's bad it's bad and when it's good it's good you know
S0018	mm
S0093	er so it's it's not a great salary he's not he's not earn a hundred a hundred and fifty thousand a year or something he's probably turn over oh i don't know anywhere between on a good year probably fifty to seventy
S0018	mm mm
S0093	bad year twenty to fifty i don't know something like that and anyway she want the lifestyle so they have a six bedroom house in dorridge which be a very affluent part of solihull six bedroom house the two of them
S0093	she's a a teacher by the way
S0018	right
S0093	she's a teacher he's a car salesman
S0018	mm mm
S0093	and they have a six bedroom house in dorridge and both drive porches and also have a big four by four mercedes four by four i can't remember what it be but you're talk about a fifty grand car
S0018	yeah
S0093	and you just go that doesn't add up
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0093	that just do not add up
S0093	you be you're go for the lifestyle without in any way pay for it
S0018	mm
S0093	and sure enough they can't afford it she just bugger off basically and have leave him and he have to find he's gonna have to sell the house so he can cut things down

S0018	crikey
S0093	let alone to live on
S0018	hmm
S0093	and that that's all because of the aspiration or whatever
S0018	yeah yeah yeah

S0093	what they deserve so when i grow up i be um you know if i want the latest action man or whatever else i have to you know er earn it you know whether it be clean the car or
S0018	yeah yeah
S0093	when i be really small or actually do a paper round well

S0093	and and have a store in so of course i use to do paper round and things like that
S0018	uh huh yeah yeah
S0093	you know six o'clock on a sunday morning i be up in the snow do all that when i be fourteen fifteen
S0093	and you try and get a fourteen fifteen year old to do that now you can forget it
S0018	a job what be you talk about
S0093	exactly yeah
S0018	a holiday job
S0093	but again a part of that whole x factory type of thing
S0018	mm
S0093	i keep say that but it's it's an overnight success it's a
S0018	yeah yeah you don't have to work at it
S0093	i demand to have it
S0018	mm
S0093	you've gotta work at these a lot of them do
S0018	mm
S0093	you know and but it's also the fact that it's just you know it's almost it's almost because it the the bits in the x factor i don't mind watch i don't sit there and watch it but if it's on if somebody else be watch it girlfriend or whatever it's just the it's those early round where
S0018	mm mm
S0093	it's all about how bad people be and let's laugh at how bad they be
S0018	yeah but that's that's the way they choose them i think they have a
S0093	yeah
S0018	three different pile the mingers the blingers and the clingers or something like that
S0093	yeah you're right that's it i like the phrase
S0018	just to make it
S0093	but there's all this erm
S0018	isn't it sad that that make people watch it
S0093	well i watch that's the only bite i watch it's brilliant you know in a way i don't watch it really just say if it's on
S0018	you're a rubber neck
S0093	that's the only bite i'll watch
S0018	car crash tv
S0093	well you can't help watch it these people be awful but they're be laugh at and i don't like that
S0018	yeah
S0093	and the and they they the the entertainment
S0018	mm
S0093	seem to be about how bad these people be and how what a what a fool they make of themselves
S0018	yeah
S0093	and then they get with ooh yeah you're on stage aren't you brilliant no you're not
S0093	and then the people at the the top end who be you know back to the down to the now that's what i don't watch cos i just find it so manufacture and and you know if if somebody could get through a song without cry and a speech afterwards without cry it's you know how about a backbone as well
S0018	yeah
S0093	you know yes there's emotion and there's a good time but not every single time you come on television don't cry
S0018	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0093	you sort of begin to lose a bite of sympathy with with me
S0018	it's crazy
S0093	if there's something er real i'm do this
S0018	it's sensational and
S0093	well i watch the apprentice the other night and that's the one programme i do actually quite like because
S0018	yeah
S0093	you can learn from it
S0018	mm mm
S0093	i can learn from it by watch these people who be mostly idiots who be mostly choose to be idiots or to be a bite confrontational or to be a bite erm you know a bite good at what they be suppose to be do who know er but they actually but i learn from it about how not to pitch
S0018	mm
S0093	i have to do that all the time you know
S0018	mm mm
S0093	so i pick up things from this programme and i think actually that's
S0018	yeah
S0093	that's interest i you know if i'm gonna be do a presentation
S0018	uh huh
S0093	don't do this but do this
S0018	oh okay
S0093	or if i'm go to buy something i'm quite a good negotiator anyway
S0018	mm
S0093	i've be work for twenty odd years in television and you learn how to negotiate with channel 4 the bbc and all that sort of stuff i'm quite good at that but you can still learn
S0018	mm mm
S0093	whereas the x factor doesn't actually teach me anything
S0018	mm
S0093	big brother didn't teach me anything erm i don't find you know even in sport there's an educational side to it i suppose of of most things about how to
S0018	yeah but even sport isn't really sport any more it's a profit make
S0093	oh yeah
S0018	machine
S0093	well it it yes er sky of course um you know be all about that but actually their coverage be very good i'm bias cos i've work in sport
S0018	mm mm
S0093	you know what they do be very good
S0018	do you know that work on the bar here
S0093	yeah
S0018	yeah cos he i be chat to him the other day and he say that he be a sport journalist who'd work for sky and since then
S0093	oh i'm think about another no which
S0018	oh he work on the bar here
S0093	not the singer then who use to work behind the in reception
S0018	i don't know
S0093	no i don't know this other i'll look out for him though he work for how old be he
S0018	he's about twenty four
S0093	oh right so he's probably do a
S0018	he's do a
S0093	he's probably struggle a bite yeah
S0018	yeah he's
S0093	hence why he's work here i'd say he's
S0018	struggle completely yeah it's a shame really cos he seem so into it he's start up his own blog and everything to
S0093	there be erm again there's i get a lot of people er come back to the dumbing down thing one of the one of the things i i'm guilty of i i i what i i don't hire people who have do media study
S0018	mm mm
S0093	by just on principle
S0018	be that's cos it's too
S0093	cos there be so many people
S0018	oh right
S0093	who be after each job when i hire people you know
S0018	mm mm
S0093	if i'm do a big production or something i get a series of runners researchers juniors for some research and obviously they're younger people and i wanna give them a give them a chance
S0018	mm mm
S0093	most and maybe it's come back to this dumbing down of education and it be it be deem a an an easy degree
S0018	mm mm
S0093	to get back in the two
S0018	right okay
S0093	back in the noughties
S0018	micky mouse thing
S0093	yeah
S0018	kind of yogurt study
S0093	a micky mouse degree yeah
S0093	and what i find with media study students be they're just er you know they'd know who win big brother in what year cos they've you know that's what they've do they've study the media they don't really know what who murdock be and they know who he be and who he own but they don't what his politics be or
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0093	completely you know important stuff
S0018	mm
S0093	erm but they certainly don't know how to actually make a programme
S0018	right
S0093	which be what i need so i hire people who have get experience and whatever else and this be what eliot must be struggle with that he's get
S0018	mm
S0093	a bite of experience but even he can't get in
S0018	yeah yeah
S0093	er so i er i myself have decide that i'm only gonna hire people who have actually get either a erm a an actual degree you know in er i don't know what it would be er cos you don't get degrees in research necessarily but you know
S0018	it's like broadcast journalism
S0093	yeah
S0018	something like that
S0093	something more specific erm job relate it er you can study to be a camera person for example
S0018	right
S0093	you know there be degrees the old b techs
S0018	vocational type things
S0093	yeah vocational degrees yeah and there be of course erm er excuse me actual er write course and that
S0018	mm mm
S0093	people er who have actually study and work
S0018	mm mm
S0093	again the x factor thing as well i raise it you see people who have actually just go into something ooh media study ooh great i can then get into media and become a celebrity
S0018	mm
S0093	ha
S0018	woo
S0093	no you can't you can't not with me anyway er unless you've get something to say
S0018	yeah
S0093	and you've get and you know you're a you're the next erm i don't know alan carr who i hate erm again alan carr be sum up to me
S0018	mm mm
S0093	modern television in many ways he's a very funny man on stage really funny funny man because it's his stuff be really well write
S0018	mm mm
S0093	but what have watch his show and listen to his radio show to a certain extent he's just not a funny man he's he's
S0018	no
S0093	he's a he's a modern day comedian
S0018	uh huh
S0093	that actually be not very funny and again if you watch his channel 4 show even if he just say the most er just a straight thing or
S0018	mm
S0093	whoop and the media american whoop and the applause and all that and he actually hasn't say anything funny
S0018	no it's all about well belittle people and as you say the whole thumb up thumb down
S0093	but there be that as well but he's an awful interviewer
S0018	yeah
S0093	so when he's interview you know quite big celebs
S0018	mm mm
S0093	he's dreadful erm and he come out with the odd one liner and it make you think well i could have do that you know but i haven't get what he's get you know in term of
S0018	mm mm
S0093	you know be a face and all that but i he just sum up to me the modern media and the modern culture i suppose
S0018	right
S0093	and er um and he's very much er a result of the last ten years that we've
S0018	yeah
S0093	be talk about in this interview as it be
S0018	mm mm
S0093	erm that you know that that social media have well i think the dumbing down of education be part of this the process of it
S0018	mm mm
S0093	and then in the back in the nineties
S0018	do you think it be the agenda do you think it be er the effect
S0093	it's cause and effect isn't it partly partly
S0018	but do you think that be actually a an engineer cause to bring in the effect of people be dumbed down or do you think it be a kind of like a secondary effect
S0093	i think i think it's a result of it i think it's a result of it's technology anyway isn't it
S0018	yeah
S0093	we've get this amaze technology where you can just go oh and you're talk to somebody else
S0018	mm
S0093	the trouble be you'll sit around this room next week when it's easter holiday and you'll see a load of teenagers here they're not talk to each other

S0093	well etymology
S0018	etymology
S0093	it be etymology isn't it
S0018	mm
S0093	yeah erm it's a really fascinate thing but he do this whole documentary on the history of pun really pun and
S0018	oh yeah
S0093	metaphors and
S0018	uh huh
S0093	erm yeah he go through various clichés as well which be quite a good one well how do clichés come about where do they come from and all that
S0093	and but i find i think there's a bite of a lack on television
S0018	mm
S0093	again it's maybe part of try to dumb up television unsuccessfully
S0018	oh what a fantastic cause
S0093	well you er there would be a lot of people who would be interest in that er a few years ago i start a company with a guy who unfortunately we fell out
S0018	ah what a shame
S0093	um er but we have a um an interest idea where it be gonna we be gonna call it well we we be aim television this be back in the early two thousands
S0018	mm mm
S0093	right and it be already go a bite big brotherly and reality e e and i want to er
S0018	and now it's go script reality which be even worse
S0093	what the hell be that about it's just it's all appal actors and everything as well the only way be essex jesus
S0093	the only way be downhill
S0093	erm but yeah
S0018	so what be your company call
S0093	er i've i've
S0018	educate
S0093	no
S0018	educator
S0093	no it wasn't that anything so pompous
S0093	er presumptuous and erm ha erm wholesome tv wholesome tv
S0018	ah
S0093	i be try to remember er and it be basically that we be try to do we be try to bring back sort of sunday even
S0018	mm
S0093	get the family sit around the television with their tea after their tea or whatever erm and just sit down and watch some non controversial
S0018	mm mm
S0093	probably bore you know but one of the first things we develop and the bbc be so keen and then they just go cold on it be er a silent comedy
S0018	oh yeah
S0093	a half hour
S0018	uh huh
S0093	and then lee evans come up with something similar
S0018	uh huh
S0093	and of course the artist have have win everything now er fair enough and i just think what a shame cos you know we have that idea
S0018	ah
S0093	but it be just really inoffensive
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0093	it be a comedy thing really
S0018	it wasn't the zeitgeist
S0093	a bite like a harry well not at the time
S0018	it wasn't right
S0093	no
S0018	before your time
S0093	do you see what i do there
S0018	you be ahead of the time
S0093	i'll tell you what i'm just gonna er i'll just send you this here's the
S0018	a bite uh
S0093	here's the er cv thing
S0018	all things about language be amaze like the relationship between language and think and cross cultural study the way people think because of the language that they've um learn
S0093	yes
S0018	and yeah the the comparisons between languages like things that have evolve that represent the way that humans think
S0093	yeah
S0018	because how could something
S0093	right yeah
S0018	er evolve very similarly in two different languages that have have no contact and
S0093	and yet have get this connection yeah
S0018	yeah like erm i think the baby become aware the first part of the body they become aware of be their lips and so that's why most of the word for mother
S0093	yes that be that be on qi or something that be mention on qi i think
S0018	ah
S0093	well it's coincidental
S0018	yeah
S0093	yeah
S0018	so that's though the first
S0093	yeah
S0018	most of the word for mother begin with mm bilabial sound
S0018	bilabial
S0018	get your lips together to make them
S0093	oh i've just work out where another word come from erm my apologies erm
S0093	i never realise that anyway erm yes it be erm i think it's a really good idea to bring back that idea of
S0018	definitely
S0093	you know it doesn't things don't have to be offensive and things don't have to be gladiatorial or
S0018	no
S0093	or erm or
S0018	and i think it's sad that if
S0093	offensive really
S0018	if dumb down tv you don't necessarily have to be dumb to become dumbed down by it i think there because there's a lack of an alternative a lot a lot of people
S0093	yeah
S0018	i know i you see i don't usually watch tv i didn't watch tv at all in spain i just use to watch dvd box set and stuff so when i come back to england i be quite surprise at what some of my very intelligent friends be watch
S0093	oh er yeah
S0018	come dine with me sex sun and a and e um supersize versus superskinny and just ooh
S0093	it's just so bland to me
S0018	it's exactly it's stuff that
S0093	i've get no interest
S0018	be just
S0093	but be it the lack of alternatives be that
S0018	it's like fast food for the mind i think
S0093	just because it's the water cooler thing if you don't watch it you're not part of the no or be it just
S0018	no i think they're past that kind of mentality but i i think it be because there's a lack of alternatives
S0093	there be that okay that's why i always fight for you know current affairs and all the stuff i try and do and
S0018	mm
S0093	you know you i i i er cos come dine with me again everything start with a with fairly good intentions
S0018	mm mm
