S0439	we have to like move out of this house
S0441	no
S0439	no no not move out of the house we have this view on this saturday it's really inconvenient
S0441	can call them back and say so
S0439	oh er be you here this weekend
S0441	yeah
S0439	oh i be here it's just 's here as well that's all
S0441	oh
S0439	mm
S0441	be weekend
S0439	er no i don't think so i think she's only here gonna be here on the saturday
S0441	okay
S0439	that's annoy
S0441	we can change it if you want
S0439	no it's fine it's just annoy just so soon
S0441	i know but that but she do say that if they can find someone then we can
S0439	oh i see that'd be better wouldn't it
S0441	yeah unless we say or we could ring the estate agent and just say that we're happy to
S0439	yeah before christmas yeah that'd be okay
S0439	okay
S0441	as long as it's basically as long as she's get someone to pay basically
S0439	yeah
S0441	she doesn't mind who who it be
S0439	yeah yeah yeah fair enough will they have they put the rent back up do you know don't know it's eight hundred not that it's much extra be it but
S0441	i'd imagine she probably would
S0439	yeah i think they probably just give it to us because we want it
S0441	i don't think they'd have much interest last time do they
S0439	no so
S0439	so she's get one view this weekend
S0441	no there's like load of people that wanna come and see it
S0439	good didn't popular
S0441	neither do i because the woman that we that show us round say that we be the only ones didn't she
S0439	yeah
S0441	like she hadn't have anyone else
S0439	mm okay well
S0441	weird
S0439	yeah that's fine i think we'll just have to we'll just we'll have to make sure that they know that the some of the furniture be ours and some of it's
S0441	yeah yeah
S0439	so they'd have to get themselves
S0441	mm
S0439	yeah no if they want to move in earlier i guess then they could move in earlier couldn't they
S0441	yeah
S0439	mm yeah
S0441	we could pay december's rent and then
S0439	yeah cos what i'm i think that that'd mean november'll be the last payment wouldn't it november the sixteenth would be the last pay we wouldn't pay on december the sixteenth
S0441	well er er we'd probably move out before the sixteenth
S0439	yeah yeah yeah that work for me cos that's still like the last week before christmas and i'm not work the week after so i don't need to be here
S0441	mm
S0439	mean i can find somewhere to move into after christmas
S0441	yeah i guess cos you'll be away anyway won't you
S0439	yeah be away for two weeks so yeah that work fine
S0441	okay when she ring me back it's at ten till twelve on saturday
S0439	okay
S0441	when she ring me back i can either say not then or i i guess actually
S0439	well no it's okay i think i've get a netball match at that time anyway so erm i won't be here can just make sure that everything's clean and tidy well the vacuum cleaner still doesn't work very well but i guess we could try again couldn't we mm okay didn't know they have load of people interest
S0441	yeah i didn't think it'd be so soon either but i suppose these things take time don't they
S0439	but also that mean no one's gonna be here we've get to be here to to show them round haven't we yeah
S0439	okay
S0441	that's the downside of have an estate agent in
S0439	yeah
S0441	possess her to do that
S0439	probably cheaper isn't it probably cheaper to have like an external well not external but like estate agent that work just by phone and email
S0441	yeah yeah yeah true i suppose
S0439	rather than like have to come out all the time
S0441	mm
S0439	yeah no that's okay then yeah
S0441	well if i say to them we'll pay our last rent in november and then be move out by the next sixteenth of december
S0439	yeah that work give me an extra erm four hundred or three hundred and seventy five pound
S0441	plus deposit we'll get back
S0439	plus deposit that can all go back into my save plus erm we don't have to pay bill and stuff that month or do we still have to
S0441	i don't know how that work be it the first
S0439	yeah oh unless we contact the bill company like in october and tell them that our when our last date be then we can organise all our final bill then
S0441	yeah we we wouldn't have to pay water would we cos i suppose that's
S0439	yeah that mean the next people be gonna get a fuck massive water bill which isn't theirs
S0441	it won't be much will it cos it'll be just one month one month
S0439	yeah but my point be that if we don't pay it if we we've only pay one water bill from january through to june or july whenever and then if we don't get another water bill until like until if they don't get another bill until like january
S0439	that's gonna be our water bill isn't it
S0441	unless we ring up the water
S0439	yeah or just sneak off and don't leave a no i'm kid let's not do that firstly cos it's in my name
S0439	and i really really don't want that against my credit rat yeah well if we ring them up in october cos then we can get the internet cancel we can get the
S0441	i don't think i'm gonna be able to get that cancel i think there's a
S0439	oh
S0441	mm
S0439	can't we ask them if they want to keep the internet contract
S0441	i don't know how it would work though in term of change the name round and stuff
S0439	well we could just ring up and change the name couldn't we cos then again it save them have to then get a new internet supplier
S0441	mm
S0439	which take us like a month
S0441	yeah
S0439	we could say that to them
S0441	true
S0441	let's try and make it as nice as possible so want it
S0439	yeah cos that'd be really good actually cos that mean we get our deposit back would be which be what four hundred quid
S0441	yep
S0439	and then our we don't have to pay rent that last month which would be another four hundred quid
S0441	yep
S0439	then we wouldn't have to pay council tax that month
S0441	er what do we council tax as
S0439	oh hundred and fifty quid
S0441	how er how often though
S0439	every month
S0441	oh it be monthly
S0439	if we pay it in november and then tell them we be move out in mid december they i think they reduce it or you don't have to
S0439	yeah
S0441	
S0439	and then electricity bill we can ring up and er can you give us a final bill
S0441	mm
S0439	what else have we get gas same
S0441	mm
S0439	just ask them for a final bill i think we have to pay like a five pound exit fee but that's not bad
S0439	er yeah no that's fine then actually save us a bite of money in december doesn't it
S0441	it do
S0439	it's christmas month
S0441	yeah erm yeah er yeah because we've this'll be october won't it october
S0439	yeah
S0441	we've only get two leave if it work i'm sure it
S0439	yeah so i've already yeah i've already i take cos i get pay on the eighteenth of every month i've already take my october rent out of this salary
S0441	yeah so have i
S0439	yeah
S0441	out of the one i just get pay
S0439	yeah and then we've get so then in october so
S0441	that'll go for november
S0439	so yeah er that'll go for november yeah so i won't actually have to pay rent in my november salary
S0441	no
S0439	that'll be good
S0441	yeah
S0439	and my december salary
S0441	yeah
S0439	that's two salaries without have to pay rent boom love that idea that's really good actually
S0441	if it work like that
S0439	if it work like that
S0441	let's not get our hop up
S0439	still i'll be like ha ha ha that's hundred quid which i do not factor for mm
S0441	i i wouldn't i couldn't i i don't see why it wouldn't work like that if if we explain to them that if you can come to an arrangement with somebody who want to move in that we'll move out by the sixteenth of december the fifteenth of december
S0439	yeah
S0441	what's the weekend of that
S0439	but i guess it's probably it'll depend on whether somebody would want to move in half way through a month just before christmas doesn't it
S0441	mm unless we move in unless we just say the begin of december
S0439	yeah that doesn't bother me i don't mind drive to work for like i could easily like ask or something if i could stay with her or
S0441	cos the sixteenth be a wednesday so we'd either say the first or second week of december
S0439	yeah
S0441	just pay a month's rent on the sixteenth of november
S0439	well if we ask them on saturday when they would like to or if like if they be interest when like when and what when be they look to move in and we could like negotiate from there maybe
S0441	yeah we could it's good it's good that it's not so like
S0439	imminent
S0441	well i mean quite so
S0439	no that's good
S0439	cos there's no point pay if we can there's no point pay for two weeks when we're not even gonna be live in the house so
S0439	mm that'd work yeah
S0441	she's very nice
S0439	really
S0441	nicest one i've meet when i speak to them
S0439	that's good with the fuck lie shite
S0441	yes
S0439	well erm cos they say someone be come over on thursday for the fridge do they say what time
S0441	gonna be here though
S0439	oh okay
S0441	be here but i will
S0439	she's just shit
S0439	she's actually the shittiest shittiest shittiest estate agent in the entire western world
S0441	i still don't understand why these company as well like they ring you up and they're like okay so when do you want me to come it's like well they say any weekday between nine and five it's like well
S0439	so any weekday between nine and five when everybody else be work
S0441	exactly i don't understand like er fair enough you have the same work hours as everyone else but you haven't
S0439	mm yeah
S0441	and i be like okay so morning then and she be like okay morning be between eight till one i'm like what the hell do you expect me to factor that into my day
S0439	yeah cos if you come at one o'clock you've just waste my entire morning
S0441	for god's sake
S0439	they're just shit
S0439	they're really bad like i hate the the internet though we can come in the even but you have to pay more it's like
S0439	so you're gonna charge me to come at the most convenient time of day
S0441	well that's just to complete the ploy though isn't it
S0439	oh yeah of course it be
S0441	cos they know that everyone's gonna bloody well want to go in the even
S0439	cos er yeah
S0441	it's an extra fifteen quid
S0439	exactly it's just oh er yeah no okay we'll do some clean
S0441	yep do you think they should come and actually touch it up a little bite it's er look very tatty and run down
S0439	it look tatty it do look tatty like the paintwork really should be redo
S0441	the paintwork's shit

S0439	erm you could because it's write by the people who create south park you can er while you're watch it you can imagine a south park episode it's really it's really weird but it be really well do and the theatre like our seat weren't bad they be quite they be near the back but they weren't bad or any or anything and then we just come back here go to a pub and watch the rugby and then erm sunday go to this country park fair thing at country park and then go to 's and then take go to 's for dinner have dinner with and then i go to yoga

S0441	then she must've know as well
S0439	and er so she know and didn't
S0441	weird
S0439	but i be just like why do it matter then for some reason i be a bite sad like not sad about it but just you know when you're just like a bite when you feel a bite weird about it and i think it's because be so like incestuous and so tangle i be like i hope he doesn't like say anything about me to her or like
S0441	yeah
S0439	and then like er awkwardly enough she be there at the rugby
S0441	oh
S0439	and i be just like and like apparently they've be see each other for a while and i'm just like why why suddenly do i like find out in a really weird way
S0441	mm

S0441	always weird i suppose isn't it
S0439	yeah the person that you be see start see somebody else
