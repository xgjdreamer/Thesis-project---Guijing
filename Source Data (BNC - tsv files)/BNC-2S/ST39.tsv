S0208	yeah sure well i'd really like that thank you i'll give you the money back
S0202	yeah don't worry about it
S0208	let you book it all in one go though cos it's easier and
S0202	yeah
S0208	at least you know you've get it
S0202	yeah erm
S0208	i've give up on get the bombay bicycle club because erm there's a there be a concert in london and the first time come over she tell me about it and her and be go and they she invite me erm it's like in december but it's roughly the time where i go back to er france last year
S0202	mm
S0208	so it be kind of perfect time cos then i could go from her house to the airport
S0202	yeah
S0208	so i say yeah i'll get on that a few weeks later when she come back she be like have you buy it yet and i be like nope
S0208	and i still haven't and it's definitely gonna be sell out
S0202	yeah
S0208	erm but it be only thirty pound which be it so stupid of me like i always do that and regret it just from laziness
S0202	mm
S0208	would have take me five minutes on the computer and i just didn't do it
S0202	oh well they might not have sell out
S0208	but hey like it will save a lot of money cos it might just be thirty pound for that but
S0202	the drink inside
S0208	plus drink
S0202	gigs be fuck so expensive
S0208	plus i'd i'd go down for the weekend so that's my train ticket whereas and a train ticket to get from her house to stansted whereas if i go to then i know that i get a free lift so
S0202	yeah
S0208	i need to ring as well to know if they can pick me up from the airport erm i'm sure will be able to if she's not work but i've sort of book my flight to stansted and i've leave all my stuff there and i just assume that they could get me but
S0202	yeah
S0208	i need to ask them
S0202	they will be able to get you
S0208	i'm sure
S0202	they'll arrange it they've get a few weeks' notice anyway so
S0208	yeah yeah i'm gonna ring them later but i won't ring during the day cos no one'll be there anyway so i'll do that this even and once i've speak to them i'll book my train ticket so that i know for sure if i need to get the train from hers to london i'll get on the day that's never expensive
S0202	well why doesn't she just like why don't she just meet you instead of you go down to come back up why don't she come up and then you go from there
S0208	well cos i'm fly into stansted anyway
S0202	i know but you're go to 's for night aren't you
S0208	yeah but from stansted it's like a thirty five forty minute drive
S0202	right
S0208	so they usually pick me up i stay there for a night and i get to see and see them
S0202	yeah
S0208	and then from her house station like ten minutes away from hers
S0202	no but that's
S0208	and then i go from there
S0202	but that's what i mean like why doesn't just meet you
S0208	to
S0202	in a train station in or wherever it be
S0208	erm because it's just more difficult because from it's a direct train to
S0202	okay
S0208	whereas from 's i can't get a direct one i'd have to stop anyway
S0202	oh right and change
S0208	so yeah so rather than go to and change for example if i just go to straight away and come up with her
S0202	yeah
S0208	because she'll have to get two train whereas in it would stop at er whereas like i would be go to anyway probably do you see what i mean
S0202	yeah yeah yeah
S0208	so it's just much easier for me to be the one that make that little extra trip rather than her because her one would be direct anyway
S0202	yeah i've get so much stuff to do when i get home get to go into uni and speak to the career adviser like get a proper meet book cos she only show me how to use the website when i go in
S0208	mm
S0202	like i be like this be not help me like you're not answer any of my question she be like well you need to book in for a proper appointment then i say well put book me in now be you busy er no but er no it's like well why can't you book me in now i'm here like i have to limp all the way round campus cos all the middle of campus have be close off
S0208	yeah
S0202	and my crutches i'd like and i have to carry all these book it be a nightmare
S0208	oh
S0202	cos i'd have a meet book in with my personal tutor who be fuck shit by the way he do not have a clue about anything like every time i ask him a question he go onto his computer and look on the internet it's like i could have fuck do that at home
S0208	yeah you need to change personal tutor
S0202	like he's really shit he doesn't know anything
S0208	i'm gonna give my personal tutor one last chance because he have get a lot of good contact and bless him he have try because he see that i'm interest in the exact same field he be
S0202	yeah
S0208	but i think cos i be a first year and all of that he pay more attention to
S0202	the second years and stuff
S0208	the older people
S0202	yeah
S0208	so i'm gonna give him more of a chance and actually make more of an effort to make meet with him cos let's face it it's not it's not his job to chase me
S0202	yeah
S0208	he's get so many students to care for
S0202	yeah
S0208	erm and i'm gonna give him one last chance and if that doesn't work out well then i'm gonna go and change to someone else
S0202	yeah
S0208	but i'm gonna
S0202	well like
S0208	give him a chance
S0202	my my experience of so far have be so shit as a university like i didn't know that you have until thirtieth of may to change degree discipline no one no one tell you that like you don't have
S0208	no
S0202	like and stuff like that i mean
S0208	but to honest i think it's the same everywhere cos it's like once you get to university it's like you're an adult you have to do it yourself sort of thing
S0202	you're on your own yeah
S0208	it's like we're say our experience with be shit but have we be somewhere else it would probably be very much the same
S0202	mm but i just expect like better communication
S0208	yeah
S0202	that's be all like
S0208	no yeah i i completely agree not defend it
S0202	no
S0208	i think it be pretty shit as well have lot of problems like choose my modules and stuff
S0202	i mean they be really good with you when that happen with your sister though weren't they like
S0208	yeah i mean
S0202	really really good
S0208	amaze and that woman brilliant i still haven't send her the erm well actually no that's not true my dad write a letter so that's fine cos she want a doctor's thing or a note from my parent like just to
S0202	yeah verify
S0208	justify it i be like i'm not gonna get a note off off of a doctor like that's impossible
S0202	yeah
S0208	cos i be only back from then so i be like that's just not not feasible
S0202	it's not gonna happen it's not gonna happen if you do
S0208	so she be like oh that's fine then a note from your parent so i get my dad to write one in block capitals as well so that she could read it because his write be atrocious
S0208	it's worse than my mum's my mum
S0202	why didn't you just write it and then get him to sign it
S0208	i could have but kind of look better
S0202	yeah
S0208	i could always forge a signature i do a lot actually my dad's it's really easy to forge
S0202	my my mum's be as well
S0202	and 's be his be just that's it
S0208	my one's i know my one's really bad i'm gonna have to change it cos it's just the a and an r
S0202	well mine's just a a and a squiggle that's it
S0208	yeah and it's
S0202	like anyone could do that
S0208	it's like that with an r
S0202	yeah
S0208	but i i reckon i'm gonna add onto it and it's gonna look a lot like my dad's cos his be so easy he do that with an h and then de de de de de and then a line for the d
S0202	yeah
S0208	so it's actually just h de de de de de line d
S0208	but my mum's write genuinely look like arabic
S0202	really
S0208	have you ever see it
S0202	no
S0208	come to the office my child i shall show you
S0202	oh do we have to go right now
S0208	yes
S0202	okay
S0208	yes we do it's of upmost importance
S0202	i think i saw a note once that that you snap at you know when she she be tell you about the condom situation
S0208	her write though it do look like arabic the swirl and the dot and stuff it's ridiculous my dad's like i can't physically even read any of that and this be her when she's write good i mean
S0202	how do you understand any of that it's so small
S0208	i don't it's just
S0208	ridiculous i mean
S0202	she's a special woman again the use of special
S0208	you need to use that
