S0024	i think she wouldn't mind with the higher students she's sit next to this student who be struggle already with
S0144	well make sure they don't sit next to each other then
S0024	yeah well how if she's late she's late into class i can't save a seat for her

S0024	save a seat for her where next to other students next to me i dunno
S0144	hide a chair take a chair away from one of the table
S0024	mm
S0144	and if she's always the last one to come in like hide it behind your desk and then you can say oh have you get a chair oh here you go and just stick it where you want it to go
S0024	yeah yeah but she shouldn't be late i'm sorry
S0144	no but all the chinese students be get there ten minutes early at the moment
S0024	yeah
S0144	so
S0024	yeah they're

S0144	what
S0024	yeah and it be a really long way longer than i remember
S0144	yeah that's a horrible walk that
S0024	yeah so i don't know why i do that oh i know i want to get her some thai noodles
S0144	mm
S0024	but whenever i go past they're never do them so i think they're only an even thing i've give up now there be no food store there at lunchtime well about twenty quarter to twelve so i'm gonna give up i really like those noodles that buy all the time but
