S0180	you know how you get a really strong coffee that be too strong even it doesn't matter how much milk you put in it it's really strong coffee

S0070	oh those card things

S0070	don't know
S0180	must be able to
S0070	don't know i'm not don't know how i it's all too technical for me that

S0070	some yeah yeah most of the if it if it's anything more than hi good morning how be you it's chinese
S0180	wow
S0070	so i don't know if it's to practise her english or just to have a pen friend one of these kind of
S0180	or yeah mean that's just one week stay there if you be there a year you'd collect a whole collection of these sort of strange random when it's happen to me i want to be your friend i just say well hang on a minute you can't just be someone's friend
S0180	you have to get to know them you have to see if you have anything in common
S0070	that's just like
S0180	it's like hello i want to be your friend
S0070	mm it's good like
S0180	yes it's so charm that's all
S0070	she never really ask question you know
S0180	yeah
S0070	so like you be say ask random question it's me normally that ask the question
S0180	mm
S0070	she would just sort of write hi and you know you tell me once before you sort of ask them what you do i'm sit
S0180	mm
S0070	you know she would so often do things like that
S0180	yeah yeah very
S0180	yeah yeah
S0070	i'm walk
S0180	almost like autistic
S0180	yeah yeah
S0180	it's true
S0070	and you say you know and like you know and she say i like walk so i'm try to sort of get you know so be it a hobby you know yes so where do you walk just in my yard
S0180	yeah
S0070	that's her hobby
S0180	no you have to ask question after question it's like no that's what i find really interculturally infuriate
S0180	you'd ask a question expect them to give you like a a lot of er yeah
S0070	oh i like walk i've be here i've do that and
S0180	and by the way there's a nice mountain in this province if you wanna go walk no
S0070	no
S0180	you have to ask question after
S0070	yeah
S0180	i find that really bizarre
S0070	and that kind of thing and it's and you're have a conversation you're like well
S0180	do you like walk yes
S0180	so where do you go i go there where be there
S0180	yeah what's the weather like there
S0180	yes what's weather
S0070	yeah
S0180	it's bizarre
S0070	so that's what i mean it's quite sort of funny
S0180	and that's what you have to teach if if you be teach all speak english like that
S0070	ah
S0180	you'd have to teach a lot of pragmatics
S0070	alright okay
S0180	that's what i realise too late when i be leave
S0070	aha
S0180	and it and if i have go in know that my lessons would've be so much more interest if i'd've do intercultural english cos you need to anyone who's go just to say they're teach grammar or speak english be
S0070	right yeah it's
S0180	gonna be wrong but hindsight's a wonderful thing isn't it but i i i always feel i would've teach much better if i'd have some more literature even some article
S0070	i suppose you're prepare for that that's cos no one tell you do they
S0180	no no
S0070	you know you've get
S0180	and you can only realise after the event but pragmatics crucial
S0070	right yeah
S0180	absolutely crucial and intercultural er you know conventions like yeah
S0070	yeah
S0180	cos i
S0070	it's funny yeah but they it that
S0180	different notions of common sense
S0070	right
S0180	different notions of yeah
S0070	like you be
S0180	volunteer information
S0070	yeah you know because teach that's what teach be isn't it teach grammar like those jokers down at international house when we do when i be down there they they'd give a little mention oh by the way there's this thing call pragmatics and they give the what be it the example the phone's ring i'm in the bath you know
S0180	mm
S0070	and then that's do you know that's pragmatics you don't really need er we just have to mention it you know and then it go back to grammar teach
S0180	it's intercultural teach it's crucial
S0070	oh yeah sure
S0180	yeah
S0070	yes you know but
S0180	yeah
S0070	you work that out yourself when you're there don't you kind of you're like oh yeah i'll do it
S0180	it's like my friend from china he know things like oh i'll treat you language like that you know what do it mean treat
S0070	oh yeah yeah
S0180	people might only know the noun
S0070	yeah
S0180	treat but then you can use it as a verb i'll treat you it mean i will pay for our meal things like that i mean yeah look back now i didn't do any of that
S0070	mm mm mm mm mm
S0180	i should've do i should've do that
S0070	because you probably didn't
S0180	i just do these well i just do these staid really labour monologues which you'd get from textbooks and
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	and it be cringeworthy what i teach and i'm think why didn't i think
S0070	because you're not because that's the problem you're not encourage to think the the teach language teach industry doesn't encourage you to think it encourage you
S0180	it no but yeah because i be a newly qualify tefl teacher i be obsess with stick to the plan
S0070	yeah
S0180	and the techniques that i'd be teach but they didn't teach me to use my knowledge and to say what do people really say in english you know
S0070	mm mm
S0180	and how can get that across
S0070	mm
S0180	what can you do in the lesson instead there's yeah there's a lot of problems with the train in in in sort of celta and er
S0070	yeah no for sure for sure for sure well this be it what do you teach trainee teachers you teach them how to teach grammar it's yeah it's the what do we say the low common
S0180	some techniques
S0070	the lowest common denominator of of language
S0180	well look back most of my lessons be fillers i be desperately try to fill the time stick to the plan do activities and it be all task base learn but with no language content it's like oh let's just do this so cos we need to use up half an hour
S0070	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0180	and i feel guilty sometimes cos i think really short change students not on purpose but because i be so green
S0070	mm
S0180	and so new to teach that i know you could say you can't help it if it's a new but but then it make me think well then maybe i'm not a
S0070	well you might find they might maybe wanna do those type of stuff
S0180	but then it put doubt in your head doesn't it you think make you think i'm not a natural teacher or or i if it hadn't click with me after two years maybe i should've give up then
S0070	i don't suppose there be anything such as a natural teacher be there
S0180	no
S0070	there might be someone who's you know naturally okay at stand up in front of people chat or or be more familiar with do that but teach i'm not sure if it be a a natural attribute be it
S0180	that's true it's it's a craft isn't it it it be it be a craft
S0070	yeah yeah tell me once he be a natural teacher
S0180	it be an art
S0070	and i think no don't i don't know that probably someone who's quite confident who can stand up and you know tell a story but that doesn't mean you're a teacher do it
S0180	no exactly
S0070	not at all be we allow to talk about this sort of stuff
S0180	oh of course yeah anything you want
S0070	oh
S0180	course you be it's not north korea
S0070	yes
S0180	it's not a north korean corpus of english
S0070	really talk of koreans apparently two korean korean koreans have be give the death penalty in china
S0180	really
S0070	for smuggle drug
S0180	yeah there's still the death penalty i mean
S0070	mm
S0180	there's the sad story of that ugandan man
S0070	uhu
S0180	erm who be put to death you know this be the problem if you're a foreigner in china you know you could you could you could easily fall foul of the legal system which be
S0070	right
S0180	not the legal system here
S0070	right
S0180	and this guy be put to death erm and his first thing his family know about it be when the embassy ring them up and tell em they they be they be optimistic he be come out and then that make then resentful because they think oh they just think african life be cheap you know
S0070	mm
S0180	there
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	and it's not value as much as a western life you know and it's happen a few time
S0070	but then there be that british guy wasn't there
S0180	yeah
S0070	british whatever he be british when he probably need to be british but
S0180	no it have happen to a few foreigners
S0070	yeah
S0180	and that that's why it's it's one of those place where you think you get a false sense of security you think it's cos they've get starbucks and mcdonald's that
S0070	mm
S0180	everything's yeah get come along well but when you fall foul of the
S0070	but but where be it where it's make it's produce it's grow it's come from china what be it heroin i suppose
S0180	i don't know i don't know what they what they be do maybe they be maybe it be just erm import in from somewhere or
S0070	oh yeah because of
S0180	yeah
S0070	that's well i mean don't aren't isn't that where all the opium use to come from
S0180	yeah
S0070	kind of or do they get it from
S0180	no they get it from get it from the british
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	from india british india
S0070	from india yeah
S0180	yeah afghanistan
S0070	so it be just a it's just a route through china then
S0180	burma a lot of the drug come from burma
S0070	yeah
S0180	and erm huge problem they call it the golden triangle
S0070	well yeah cos when i fly to vietnam they mention that cos we fly to
S0180	yeah
S0070	we we stop in malaysia and they say you know some oh just have to remind you erm there's a death penalty for traffic drug
S0180	yeah
S0070	so if you've get any flush them down the toilet now
S0180	oh yeah it's quite people don't realise you know
S0070	no no no
S0180	it's erm
S0070	well yes again and and i suppose because we've get such a tolerant
S0180	but but even laws like in thailand you can't criticise the king have you hear about that the
S0070	yes yeah yeah
S0180	swiss guy get drink and accidentally draw a a moustache on the portrait or picture of the king
S0070	you're not allow to do that here though be you
S0180	well but you wouldn't be
S0070	no no
S0180	you wouldn't be jail for it would you
S0070	no
S0180	that's the difference so you've you're you're in a country like thailand and you think oh quite western or you know
S0070	yeah
S0180	quite liberal but then people have these bizarre beliefs about their own king like some sort of demigod
S0070	yeah
S0180	and erm people would would be
S0070	don't they have their own separate language or something for talk about the
S0180	i don't know
S0070	king someone be it tell me that
S0180	that's interest
S0070	when we be talk about honorifics once
S0180	maybe you're right
S0070	cos there be er one of one of the essay and i be gonna do it on korean honorifics honorifics that's what they call it isn't it
S0180	be there lot in korean
S0070	yeah they're a bite weird about that you know like
S0180	but be it less with the younger generation
S0070	i don't know and that would be an interest thing to look into like for example the two nephews you know they'll call me but they when when they be young they use to call me their mum use to get really annoy
S0180	yeah yeah funny isn't it
S0070	you know yeah yeah
S0180	but for them it would change i think it would
S0070	and i suppose they be be a little bite cheeky i suppose they would because they would've know that he be i be older but but also that i be foreign so that's
S0180	no it's not that they know it's not the norm in the uk so they would
S0070	yeah
S0180	yeah it's funny that isn't it
S0070	mind you that little one
S0180	woah but it's get bizarre though cos in chinese er i ask what i should call her aunts and she say her aunts be call erm there's one
S0070	phyllis and maude no no
S0180	there's one no there's one term it wasn't a name it be just a term so auntie
S0070	uhu
S0180	and i say okay what do i call the other aunt
S0070	oh
S0180	and it's the same
S0070	oh yeah yeah
S0180	it's the same word
S0070	yeah
S0180	what do i call a third auntie
S0070	yeah
S0180	same word the fourth auntie the same word i be that's ridiculous
S0070	so
S0180	so what do i call
S0070	what do you do in the airport when you call out someone auntie and then a thousand people turn round
S0180	or just go oi you you know
S0070	oi you
S0180	but
S0070	no be
S0180	because they don't use name very much or they're not chatty with the older relatives i think
S0070	yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah cos i have the same problem you have to call er you know older brother sir brother sir something and i say so what what do you do if you wanna call you know he's there and you call you know
S0180	and it's the and it's the other one yeah
S0070	ah park eh even the same problem there with park
S0180	oh no
S0070	kim
S0180	that's ridiculous
S0070	isn't it yeah but yeah it's a weird one isn't it but but then i think the young don't do that they're a bite sort of like
S0180	but i think the younger generation no i think the younger generation will be change from that though cos i've always find that odd and i though well okay your four aunties in the room with you and you want to speak to one of them how would you differentiate
S0070	but they do they do do doesn't happen it doesn't happen like that
S0180	and they don't they no they they don't they don't initiate conversation with each other so much
S0070	you know no no yeah
S0180	funny isn't it
S0070	yeah cos i be watch
S0180	they still have this very hierarchical family system
S0070	yeah the the family next door there's a bangladeshi family next door and there's about three thousand of them who occasionally descend on and sometimes they like like they like last night they all rush out of the house for some reason and there's an like i don't know if there's an or i observe on this occasion that like the older ones talk to the slightly younger ones and the slightly you know what i mean
S0180	really
S0070	they don't
S0180	okay that's interest
S0070	it's kind of
S0180	hierarchy
S0070	yeah then i then i be think back cos i don't really have a family and i be think back to when i be younger and think when i meet my cousins and there be a bite like that you know there's the the kind of the the the uncles and your aunties and then there's the older cousins
S0180	yeah
S0070	and there's a kind of they have a sort of link with the
S0180	yeah
S0070	and then there's you who's the kind of kid and you can speak to the next ones up slightly and there's all those weird relationships i don't have any cos i don't have any family but
S0180	mm
S0070	i suppose i dunno what do british people do
S0180	er it's fairly flexible like
S0070	how to yeah i suppose
S0180	couldn't understand why you know i just call my aunts by their first name
S0070	oh
S0180	yeah i mean she's live here since she be eighty three that's like i don't why you surprise by that you should know about the conventions and
S0070	it's yeah yeah yeah
S0180	well maybe they don't and they don't meet people who be but i would just say you know i wouldn't say auntie even cos some would wouldn't like that we would say
S0070	yeah but then i don't but but
S0180	it's a lot much more relax in english culture
S0070	when do you when do you when do it when do you like some of my mum mum's friends like if i meet them in the village i would still call them like mrs so and so when do you get to the age
S0180	yeah there be that
S0070	when you can call them by their first name all your aunties like auntie
S0180	there be that
S0070	when do i say
S0180	there's that funny harry enfield sketch isn't there where he go er
S0180	and the friend come round to the house and he go yes mrs miss patterson yes miss patterson miss patterson miss patterson he just say by their first name he's really rude to his friend they talk about all you know really slang and
S0070	and then
S0180	off and then whenever the mother come in he's hi mrs yeah mrs patterson yeah mrs patterson
S0070	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0180	he's really polite to the
S0070	yeah
S0180	that do still exist in
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	i think
S0070	and when do you when do you suddenly
S0180	which be nice
S0070	when be you able then to sort of call them by their first name as and then whereas perhaps in
S0180	well but i dunno as you get older you
S0180	it's more relax i call my friend's dad
S0070	but but that's what i mean so we get relax as we get
S0180	older
S0070	but but in korea or china i don't if it's it's it's always
S0180	yeah yeah
S0070	you're always older brother sir
S0180	it come bizarre where in the first two years of my relationship with i didn't know what her actual parents' name be
S0070	right
S0180	and she be very reluctant to tell me
S0070	yeah
S0180	weird isn't it
S0070	what do you call them you don't call them by their name though do you
S0180	no i say
S0070	oh
S0180	father mother but he's and she's er
S0070	uhu
S0180	but i didn't know those name odd isn't it
S0070	it be odd and i find it odd you know obviously they know each other's name but they don't call them by
S0180	no
S0070	their name either do they
S0180	name be such a fascinate thing and that's that could be a whole lesson in itself if you
S0070	yeah
S0180	do
S0070	i remember one be teach
S0180	i should've do the whole lesson on that again bite of hindsight that's another lesson there
S0070	could've do there's a reason for go back to china
S0180	oh no
S0070	one one lad i be teach within erm milan i be talk about you know i learn the students' name and he say oh why do you wanna learn the students he be english
S0180	weird isn't it
S0070	why do you wanna learn the students' name like like
S0180	er cos you're the teacher
S0070	just to address them
S0180	yeah it's weird isn't it
S0070	a question yeah
S0180	i do that in china i make i make a point of
S0070	he be
S0180	oh i hate that yeah they probably just point at people go you
S0070	yeah you
S0180	and i have every students' picture this may be a bite extreme i have like
S0070	no on on a dartboard
S0180	i ask every student to bring me a passport photo
S0070	that be weird
S0180	and it's no
S0070	get lock up for that over here
S0180	because the
S0180	no cos i have eight class a week each class have forty students
S0070	gosh what do you do with all those photos
S0180	they're still in my file
S0070	top trump
S0180	no and i have no so i know who be who and if you do group work and you actually know who be who so when you come to examine them
S0070	yeah
S0180	at the end of the year you could do your job properly and know that person
S0070	uhu
S0180	that's their name and
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	you know what i mean that's i think i be do my job but it's funny that the students find that odd and i say well actually i want to because they're so use to be know as number in their system you know
S0070	to
S0180	and they they're they're
S0180	use to be inconsequential and anonymous
S0070	oh yes okay
S0180	their education and so that that make a big impression on them i think that i actually want to know their name and to link their name to their face i say i don't care what you do here this be what i do and this be how i teach you know i'm i want to know i don't want to
S0070	that explain why i have such a rigmarole get the name out of them on the first day when i be teach
S0180	point yeah yeah because you
S0070	and then they'd come out with all their bizarre english name like red and black and
S0180	yeah yeah oh yeah yeah devil and
S0180	have one call satan
S0070	really
S0070	huh
S0180	oh yeah i mean i have i've still get all the class list with picture
S0070	yeah
S0180	and their name below them
S0180	i think it's important cos how can you teach if you don't know
S0070	i think that's that's
S0180	people
S0070	i i think so but then that's our kind of method of do it isn't it it's address individuals and expect individuals to respond and
S0180	well i i should've
S0070	notice individuals or recognise them
S0180	well look back i should've explain that i want to i wanna do this because i want to this be how we teach this be what we do
S0070	mm
S0180	we have class list in the uk this be part of your education
S0070	yeah
S0180	your intercultural education i'm not a chinese teacher i'm a
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	british teacher and this be what we do
S0070	yeah
S0180	so that but i didn't make you have to make those things explicit i think when you teach in those contexts
S0070	yeah yeah i really think that that's a whole good discussion topic isn't it you know what what be your purpose when you go there be you know be you teach you know the whole kind of argument about what form of the language you're teach and do you go there as a native speaker or do you go there to teach chinese and english as an international language
S0180	mm
S0070	for communication between them and whoever else or
S0180	a purely functional language or pragmatic language
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	cos most of them would just need functional or not functional you know sort of book language
S0070	yeah
S0180	read manuals or
S0070	right sure yeah
S0180	but some of them would need pragmatic language if they're gonna be translators and
S0070	yeah
S0180	interpreters and which a lot of them actually and they're work for company who work in i get email years later from guy who go to africa go to kenya
S0070	oh really
S0180	translate for chinese company you know construct roads there things like that so they would need
S0180	to know about local englishes and maybe the history of the local englishes and
S0070	that's quite
S0180	what's different about the accent and the vocabulary
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	so very interest
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	since china's be engage more with africa they need to know
S0070	right
S0180	other varieties of english
S0070	yes yes yes yeah
S0180	and i'd meet people at english corner who be like work for tractor company export tractors to bangladesh and they
S0070	right
S0180	they would go on trip to bangladesh so they would need to know about you know they'd need to get use to the heavily accent
S0070	i meet a kenyan guy in
S0180	indian english
S0070	problem be he's talk more standard english than any of the
S0180	well this be it yeah yeah the high level of english you get yeah
S0070	yeah
S0180	be he erm a teacher
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	yeah
S0070	yeah
S0180	oh yeah
S0070	very you know well speak and like obviously very sort of
S0180	oh yeah for for elite people in those countries it's first language that's the that's the whole basis of my research you know
S0070	mm mm mm
S0180	i'm actually say people
S0070	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0180	actually native speakers that that group of people who be study abroad you know
S0070	probably get a higher level of english than a lot of undergraduates
S0180	which be why well yeah that's what what i be read this morning you know that
S0070	mm
S0180	l one who have l one be it always people who who be bear in the uk have l one not really that's only
S0070	no no yeah
S0180	like someone who's never leave their village
S0070	well that's a crass sort of term anyway isn't it what's
S0180	yeah
S0070	i mean it what l one what do it what how do it
S0180	yeah
S0070	really i think old blockhead talk about something about that
S0180	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0070	yeah i i mean it's errr well yeah it's just an assumption that all l one speakers speak the same they're a homogeneous group there's no you know speak in my l one you're speak in your l two they're tefl term aren't they irritate term
S0180	cos i've meet a lot of americans who who who get lose when they're listen to non american english you know british english
S0070	yeah what's her name 's friend when she come
S0180	yeah
S0070	over here she she she find my accent quite difficult to
S0180	yeah yeah this be it
S0070	my accent even me
S0180	she's from la
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	yeah
S0070	korean
S0180	it's about exposure isn't it that's what it's about
S0070	yeah yeah and by the time she leave she say oh i find your accent a lot easier to listen to to understand now
S0180	cos use to it cos of all the sitcoms in the
S0070	yeah
S0180	in american english so people
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	get attune to it don't they
S0070	yeah and that's all it be isn't it get attune to it same as learn a different frigging language i suppose isn't it
S0180	yeah absolutely
S0070	just a bite more the code be a bite more complex
