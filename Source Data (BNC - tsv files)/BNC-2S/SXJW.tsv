S0355	what do you make of that
S0281	it sound a bite like sour grapes you know that they're either miff that they didn't do it or think it's it's not on to support you know because of the the special relationship we have with america we're not really suppose to do that kind of thing erm china call it childish erm but i think america's feel increase increasingly threaten by china not militarily but certainly economically indeed it's be predict that by twenty thirty china will have overtake america as the lead economic power in the world what do you think about it

S0355	no it's that's it isn't it absolutely absolutely no doubt absolutely i don't know why my nail be so filthy i don't know what i've be do to get my nail so filthy it must have be that job i do yesterday i need to clip my nail always need clip and clean always they seem to grow
S0281	clip round the bloody ear

S0281	have you get any preference you're go to be bury aren't you next to your father
S0355	yeah but in a box of ash if they'd allow me
S0281	oh really
S0355	to put those in the grave yeah there's in the headstone for my name
S0281	i suppose once you're go it doesn't really make much difference do it
S0355	not really it's for the live
S0281	yeah that's right well i'm go to go and get myself a little bite more veg
S0355	yeah go for it mate do it do it do it
S0281	won't be a mo
S0355	great
S0281	right there we go obviously have change his mind have go off with his plate so much for cut down on the amount do talk to yourself constitute a conversation don't worry he'll be back in a minute ah
S0355	curry sauce and chip that's what i've get curry sauce and chip ah so how do how do that chinese cook and preparation of the vegetable differ from the preparation erm erm
S0281	well it tend to be all pretty much the same in term of cook nearly everything's fry
S0355	in china
S0281	yeah
S0355	right what like stir fry with a very small amount of oil isn't it
S0281	erm probably i think traditionally there be be not obese be in stark contrast to westerners but they be start to to now because of like everybody else they eat mass of erm fast food especially the kid
S0355	right yeah
S0281	they're follow the west
S0355	really
S0281	for good and for bad well mostly bad i suppose depend on your point of view
S0355	mother's day today do they have that in china
S0281	oh yeah
S0355	oh what same day
S0281	i presume so
S0355	so it's the end of their new year now
S0281	yeah it's finish everyone be back school be back to back to work
S0355	when do when do that finish
S0281	i think erm half way through february
S0355	oh right
S0281	well go back to school this week so maybe i don't know maybe most of february so i'm certainly glad i miss that those bloody fireworks be just incessant and it build up every day get a little bite more until the big day and
S0355	yes you're not a fan of celebration really be you
S0281	not really no
S0355	no
S0281	i think it's not the celebration of it that i don't really enjoy i certainly like celebrate as much as anybody but it's the organise celebrations that i i don't like cos well usually everybody be expect to behave in a prescribe manner
S0355	which be
S0281	well you have to try and maintain harmony and er happiness even though you know like as in the west at christmas time most family feuds'll rekindle themselves don't they at christmas so i think to a certain extent it happen in china as well but not to such a great extent because they don't base all their celebrations on alcohol like we do and they're also the family value system be they they try and maintain the this thing about harmony which be in my way of think just a façade
S0355	well yeah it's it's just that's not value that you you consider practise yourself
S0281	well if it i i think that if you're go to do this it should be do as much as you can nearly every day of the year not just in one time of year it's like christmas
S0355	yes
S0281	peace and and love and goodwill for men why be it just at christmas
S0355	yeah yeah why be it christmas yeah sure
S0281	but bloody fireworks drive me mad
S0355	yes
S0281	cos you can't
S0355	be it the noise you can't stand
S0281	yeah mm
S0355	yes
S0281	amaze peaceful in even where we be in the centre of so quiet
S0355	yes yes yeah well we're not in the centre really be we we're not in the or anywhere like that that's the sort of
S0281	well i'd say off road's pretty central
S0355	yeah i suppose you're right yeah that's true
S0281	eleven o'clock at night you can hear a pin drop outside
S0355	yes
S0281	in china my god everywhere's buzz
S0355	really why why do they why do they keep go twenty four hours do they
S0281	well not twenty four hours but certainly into the early hours
S0355	yes
S0281	yeah they work amazingly hard generally the chinese
S0355	yes look at that fuck great wall they build look at that
S0281	yeah well you can say the same about the egyptians
S0355	yeah and the egyptians isis be go to demolish them aren't they the pyramid
S0281	be they
S0355	i think so
S0281	they'll have a hard job how would you demolish a pyramid
S0355	dynamite
S0281	size of those you'd have to have a hell of a lot of dynamite
S0355	yeah yeah
S0281	the size of them
S0355	yeah islamic state's go to demolish them
S0281	ha
S0355	there's no one guard tripoli no one's in tripoli at the moment they can just walk straight in there there's no americans or english you know defence there libya they can walk straight in can't they be the pyramid in near libya well it's near egypt isn't it ah
S0281	painful again
S0355	it's painful all the time
S0281	yeah
S0355	every wake hour it's painful and probably painful in my sleep it's be go on for months and months now well it's it's it's get worse and worse
S0281	well you need to start oh god
S0355	i'm go to go to the doctor and say look this pain be get worse and worse and worse
S0281	of course when do it start get worse
S0355	well it get worse all the time i think it would go away i think i have pull my shoulder it's be about ache or now it's spread down my arm it's down into my shoulder i can hardly move it you can see how much i can move it if this arm do the same i'm fuck seriously fuck ah
S0355	yes thank you very much
S0355	there you go thank you
S0355	ah fuck me yeah we'll go and see the doctor see the doctor tuesday
S0281	i be go to say mate you can't carry on just
S0355	i can't i think i'd get over it i can't it's get worse and fuck worse and worse i have to put in some of that gel which be good it's like a chill gel something like that deep heat or something you know it seem to work
S0281	why don't you go tomorrow morning
S0355	well i suppose i could really yeah i suppose i could but i want to wash i want to get myself prepare i've get to get to 's by eleven which mean get out the front door by ten
S0281	that's alright you have to be there at half past eight don't you you're up usually by then
S0355	yeah but it's a rush it's i just want to get up slowly wash dress take my time focus prepare myself for a speech a eulogy it may albeit short and erm just rumble off the road get on the bus get to 's
S0281	well it's not exactly to look forward to be it
S0355	well i quite it's for the live isn't it funerals be for the live they're not for the dead
S0281	no
S0355	er although have say that you don't know you don't know how long
S0281	have she get much family
S0355	a sister
S0281	be that it
S0355	as far as i'm aware yeah some people don't have that but she didn't talk to her sister for a long time she certainly didn't tell her she be die so erm er her sister be a bite miff and a bite peeve by her erm then hopefully she'll get over it so you know i don't know why be an alcoholic why do she get sweep away on it you know what be that all about sad isn't it
S0281	i don't know don't they reckon that some be i suppose most of it's erm in your dna that some people be more prone to do whatever than others
S0355	yes yes i mean brief
S0281	and suddenly i mean to a greater extent
S0355	even if they have a pretty
S0281	after after that we have our fair share of pints and booze in general and yet we never get addict to it
S0355	well there be that there be that i suppose in my life i have be addict to booze at various time i remember wake up in the morning and think i have to drink erm but
S0281	it's a psychological dependence when you start
S0355	but i think cos certainly at the end of the day i would just go and have a beer and you know one beer lead to another i could never just have a beer and feel chill i'd have to have i'd have to get piss and i and at the end when i drink i use to go out by myself go to the pub drink by myself to get piss and you realise how how miserable that be you see i see other people who be drinkers who go there to drink to get piss and it's very it's sad very insular to do that isn't it it's very so erm yeah so but thankfully i'm not er i don't do that anymore er but i have periods when i when i get piss very occasionally think but that that's only happen once in the last years and years i didn't you know years and years and years so er no i agree that there be there be things in your in your genes that can influence that erm you know if that's what they tell us but i think that there be things that er i think there be also psychological reason why we drink as well
S0281	of course
S0355	and i don't think it's only just the one thing i think it's and i think you know if you look at she go out with for a long time and you know i i he wasn't er he didn't treat women nicely erm so you think well she she accept that but they do row they do have row but she still go out with him be you know with his with his attitude and everything and i think well she didn't have much self respect do she you know erm neither do but er you know so i think i think people i drink for a to try and get some self respect in in a crazy way i mean in and the madness of it be be you when you drink you the more you lose your self respect
S0281	yeah
S0355	it's madness isn't it sort of weird psychology weird stuff
S0281	especially if you remember everything you do or say
S0355	oh thank god i don't i mean i i yeah god terrible dreadful dreadful yeah well er you know i blame the society i be bring up in i blame it all for for everything bad that i've learn i blame it for for give a man the power sadist to beat a fuck six year old child you know if you that's what jimmy saville get put away for well perhaps not beat but you know and they that be and there be people want to bring that back corporal punishment and what corporal punishment do be when you get beat be it make you hate the institution hate
S0281	that's what the second world war be
S0355	what corporal punishment corporal hitler
S0281	corporal hitler
S0355	ah you know what be that all about what make him do that how be he treat as a kid and i i think we should forgive him i think we should do national things to forgive him to feel sorry for him and to forgive him because if you keep hat something in an idea that's what you can do you keep on hat hat them don't you just hat the live and er you know christ come along and do do his thing say er not to hate
S0281	yeah
S0355	forgive them you know and er turn the other cheek blah blah blah and that's what you ought to do you ought to have a er national day where we forgive hitler and see where it go wrong for him
S0281	that would be controversial
S0355	well why do we accept hat him and retribution why do we make praise those things that's in the new the old testament isn't it vengeance be mine sayeth the lord eye for an eye tooth for a oath well you know look look look where it get the jews that philosophy
S0281	blind and toothless
S0355	yeah here's my boy well look at where it get them you know what if you inherit the earth but lose your soul
S0281	be you ready to
S0355	forgive hitler yes
S0281	go back
S0355	i be i forget hitler i forgive you and i send you my love for he be a torture soul yes i think we should go back and rub jelly and chocolate pudding on my arm
S0281	nowhere else don't turn turn it into
