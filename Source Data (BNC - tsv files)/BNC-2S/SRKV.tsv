S0588	mm
S0589	maybe by the younger girl and the boy oh of course there's the sub story of the boy that murder so the chap will come forward and they'll realise that the killer of of that girl
S0588	yeah
S0589	isn't the same but know
S0588	yeah
S0589	the mo but it's either he the person know the killer or the person be in the police force
S0588	why would they know the person's in the police force
S0589	because that murder replicate the same
S0588	oh right
S0589	which mean they either a copycat killer
S0588	yeah
S0589	who know the killer because i dunno how much they've publicise in the press but we don't know that do we the the the
S0588	mm
S0589	bottle and
S0588	yeah
S0588	yeah but it would seem for dramatic purpose to be quite good but it would mean that hello
S0589	oh i'm gonna get myself another half
S0588	oh okay
S0589	because you take so long
S0588	cos i'm take age hello 's get another half won't be long
S0589	jesus fuck hell
S0588	what's the problem
S0589	it's five pound twenty
S0588	sorry darling it's what it cost when you leave the house isn't it
S0589	for a bottle of beer it's like two quid across the road
S0588	what in the
S0589	in the that would be about
S0588	three four
S0589	i think it's four quid a pint
S0588	oh my god that's half a pint
S0589	i guess that's they have a flat rate for bottle
S0588	yeah sorry darling it's expensive go out especially when i drink if we both drink it's more expensive isn't it when i'm on the wagon it's cheaper so basically on on happy valley there's three stories go on there's the the murder of vicky there's the serial killer and there's
S0589	oh of course the serial killer get
S0588	tommy lee
S0589	get er i hope it be him or she'll be gutted
S0588	exactly
S0588	well this be the thing cos it might not be
S0589	i guess it must be the er
S0588	it might not we don't know
S0589	but will they find out well what would she just fee the body to the pig
S0588	but if he he didn't actually say that it be him do he
S0589	kind of no i suppose not erm
S0588	erm someone say in a review that that be the same as of mice and men who write of mice and men
S0589	steinbeck
S0588	be that a play that it be erm directly take from that i don't care if it be cos it be very good
S0589	but she won't want to get do for murder will she she probably doesn't care now
S0588	no i don't think she care
S0589	because she do it for her boy
S0588	i er she be just love her boy
S0589	do it for her boy
S0588	and do what's best yeah
S0589	so he's not cos she could just fee him to the pig cos they will eat anything
S0588	raw or would she have to cook
S0589	no they'll no they'll eat anything piggies
S0588	they'll eat a a raw body
S0589	have to bash it up a bite
S0588	would they
S0589	yeah that's why all those muslims and jews don't like pig cos they're omnivorous
S0588	so be any any animal that eat
S0589	cow won't eat a a
S0588	what
S0589	a sheep wouldn't
S0588	so they only eat an animal that eat vegetables
S0589	no cow and sheep don't eat any erm
S0588	that's weird cos they're eat er
S0589	they're herbivores
S0588	but they're yeah the muslims be eat
S0589	yeah they're eat other creatures that
S0588	a creature
S0589	they don't like pig because pig eat anything
S0588	they don't like the idea
S0589	like that erm be he australian american that serial killer who murder about fifty possibly and he run a pig farm cos so they just get mash and feed to the pig
S0588	oh wow so but i no i think she'll just confess or i i think her love be it be do for the best possible cause misguide but do for the best possible cause which be love
S0589	but do she call the police and say what she's do and why
S0588	yeah
S0589	or do she fee him to the pig and carry on with her life and say he run away
S0588	er it depend how much she want to protect herself from what she's do
S0589	mind you shoot him in the middle of the kitchen isn't a good way to hide you could have
S0588	no they be in the middle of nowhere though
S0589	she could have lead him outside
S0588	they're in the middle of nowhere though
S0589	no but the police will come if she want to hide that what she's do
S0588	oh yeah yeah no i think maybe she's not bother i wouldn't be bother if i be her i'd be prepare to accept the consequences because i'd know that i'd do the best thing if if i be misguide that i have do the best thing for my son there's a er a draught somewhere do you go what five pound
S0589	yeah i go what
S0588	yeah
S0589	but it's a flat rate cos i remember buy a can of beer in erm in the er the
S0588	yeah
S0589	and it it be
S0588	yeah
S0589	five quid
S0588	it's erm geronimo's be flat rate then
S0589	young's
S0588	it's a pub though
S0589	yeah okay own it
S0588	yeah okay burgundy bloody hell that be the word i be try to find
S0589	no that burgundy's red darling
S0588	oh no it be oh no what be i look for then
S0589	that cushion's burgundy
S0588	taupe
S0589	taupe yes it could be
S0588	it's a a blue
S0589	teal but that's teal be a very
S0588	teal
S0589	sort of greyish type taupe you might be right why don't you google taupe
S0588	mm oh well
S0589	t a u p e er something aquamarine be fairly
S0588	no aquamarine be more yeah i guess that's get a greeny quality though i mean really if i'd concentrate on my art education i'd know all this but i didn't take one thing in at all i take more in now than i do in five years of art education cos i be young you you still get a really good degree through not really bother as well didn't you but i get a crap degree from not bother
S0589	didn't fuck turn up
S0589	in hindsight you see although
S0588	get a two one though didn't you
S0589	pay yeah for like about ten minutes' work
S0588	yeah amaze but you be very intelligent that probably help you be
S0589	not really
S0588	no you be you well well if you're not then you're lucky to have be hot house enough to have enough of whatever it take to get a decent degree through do ten minutes' work
S0589	i've always be a bite lazy academically apart from when i do my ucl course and i know
S0588	yeah
S0589	i be pay for then
S0588	yeah
S0589	so i milk it for every single penny
S0588	exactly it be always the ones who be pay for it who actually ask question in lecture and
S0589	oh like the like like er
S0588	the mature students and things
S0589	the mature students
S0588	always in there
S0589	be so keen
S0588	with like yeah well
S0589	and they'd read the book that you're
S0588	exactly
S0589	study and you go like what
S0588	the rest of the bloody lecture theatre's fall asleep
S0589	i mean i do a whole
S0588	cos they're hang over
S0589	i do a whole three hour exam on a book i've never read in my first year
S0588	how do you how the hell do you
S0589	well i just bollocks i think i be do really really well but i hadn't read the book so er
S0588	do you pass the exam
S0589	so they suggest that i i switch course but then it baffle why i wasn't do history in the first place
S0588	what do you do in the first place
S0589	i enrol as an english literature student
S0588	you see i think you're better off for life purpose do english language than english literature english literature be so bloody subjective i actually think that everything that i do be the wrong choice cos i choose really subjective things and actually i should have be choose stuff that be really there be one answer and one answer only
S0589	like maths
S0588	like maths yeah because i'm already creative and all that shit
S0589	well there's different
S0588	i need a bite of balance you know
S0589	there's a different way to describe i mean like history's subjective but you're deal with objective facts whereas literature
S0588	it's still subjective
S0589	there's no objective fact other than the work of art itself
S0588	yeah
S0589	any interpretation then become subjective
S0588	and and it's up to who mark it what they think as well and i i've have it with subjective stuff i really i mean this be why i quite like all the brain train shit because i've not use the side of my brain that should just be there's one answer i mean how great be that there's one answer it stop you think i've do too much think in my lifetime
S0589	the sweet the little boy's just shut the door very sensible yes that'll keep the draught out
S0588	it if i do it again i would choose really quite scientific things but i wouldn't choose science science
S0589	darling you're probably not very scientificy
S0588	no i'm not exactly but i that be why i would
S0589	would you like me to cut these off
S0588	yeah no i tell what i'd like cut off be that that's a bite ridiculous it
S0589	i might rework this
S0588	it
S0589	for the new season
S0588	dip in things
S0589	i might rework the whole thing
S0588	it be when that whole sort of slightly bondage look be in a few years ago
S0589	i'm try to think what i've get to cut it
S0588	so hence i've get bits of er belt stick out here and there and it's er superfluous and i don't need it thank you
S0589	try to think what i've get darling that would cut through that
S0588	yeah otherwise it's a very you don't need to cut through it
S0589	i'd get rid of that
S0588	you just you just cut that and then it come off
S0589	i know but then you've get a loose end
S0588	yeah
S0589	you don't
S0588	oh right
S0589	and i'd cut it off here
S0588	no it's no it wouldn't
S0589	of course it do it's
S0588	what a waste of er stuff it's otherwise a very comfortable warm coat
S0589	it's like your most longest run coat
S0588	uhu no it's not my longest run coat be the vivienne westwood no but my point be if i be to do it again i would choose subject like maths because i have such a propensity to be all dreamy i would pull myself back from that i mean like for example music which i'm very naturally talented at but what what if you can't read and write it
S0589	you can tell note and everything
S0588	i can't tell note
S0589	it's good i remember when listen to my dad play in a little erm
S0588	orchestra
S0589	who play in the theatre
S0588	okay
S0589	gilbert and sullivan
S0588	ah
S0589	i think
S0588	sweet
S0589	and she could tell a false note in an orchestra where i be just hear
S0588	yeah
S0589	noise
S0588	mm
S0589	but you've get an ear like that
S0588	well i
S0589	haven't you darling
S0588	i mean the thing be my my big sleepless night thing be how much i just fuck should've do music in my lifetime and cos that that's the thing that i'm best at and i didn't do it so it's my greatest regret but what it take be parent to sort of totally you know like parent of that violinist
S0589	well i never have that either do i
S0588	who i don't know why that's a disgrace that you didn't because you have parent that could've do it as well
S0589	it would've be a waste of money as well i suppose because i end up tone deaf so
S0588	yeah but do they put you into it when you be five or four no cos that's when you have to start so it become natural er the thing be that i can blame mine cos they be totally disinterested
S0589	well they'd already have enough by that point
S0588	well they'd have enough but i be always plonk away at the piano so nobody notice that i be pick up tune on the piano or suggest it at a very early age yeah and then it's my fault because by the time i get round to have the lessons i couldn't be arsed with it cos all the distractions you get when you're a teenager and everything and it's such bloody hard work it really be it's such hard work oh my god to just get anywhere you know just to make little tiny progress be so much practice and work but i mean i really totally notice that part of my brain that i'm not use be criminal absolutely criminal i feel like i'm illiterate that i haven't learn it that's what it feel like
S0589	it's terrible
S0588	it's terrible
S0589	i be very i be more surprise than anyone when you tell me
S0588	yeah and i've do incredibly well from from not know anything but it be terrible
S0589	a lot of good musicians
S0588	i know brian wilson and
S0589	i bet john cale can though nina simone
S0588	but on a personal level it's deeply frustrate and yeah that's what it feel like
S0589	and you could you could then also erm what's it call when you make music do you remember we send something to my daddy to be
S0588	yeah erm
S0588	well transcribe it and stuff
S0588	but i mean the thing be i dunno i mean the all i can do now be look what's the best i can do at this point in my life
S0589	you could transcribe it then you could give it to a local pianist
S0588	yeah
S0589	like 's mate
S0588	yeah
S0589	and then you'd be do gigs
S0588	yeah
S0589	in somewhere like the
S0588	yeah i can still i can still learn how to do it it's just that we're look at ten years no we're not look at ten years of work but we're look at many years of work and i will be sixty by the time i've get anywhere now so it depend what you say be too late i i mean actually i don't think that's too late i think that's learn and learn go on personally and i'm prepare to do it but i have this terrible oh i can't even explain then my morbidity set in and my knowledge of that life doesn't go on forever and that it's limit and there's only so much you can do and i should have start when i be five and this be my one life oh my god it's terrible what do i do do i still learn anyway with what's leave in term of time and years or whatever
S0589	i can't believe that cost me five
S0588	sorry
S0589	i'm sorry darling have like five can of beer
S0588	yeah there's me get really existentialist and that's the really
S0589	that's what
S0588	yeah
S0589	cos i know you're here all along
S0588	well i
S0588	i can understand that cos that's like
S0589	plus it's not really a
S0588	terrible
S0589	it's more rhetorical anyway darling it
S0588	be you gonna revamp my coat for the next
S0589	yes
S0588	season then
S0589	i'd quite enjoy do it
S0588	be you gonna add a few things like
S0589	it's a bite like when i
S0588	you could add some ribbons or something
S0589	some ribbon
S0589	some faux fur
S0588	it'll be really bad
S0589	i'm not allow
S0588	you know it's like
S0589	i'm not allow
S0588	like one of these book on revamp your clothe
S0589	i'm not allow to cut your hair any more
S0588	no
S0589	so this could be like a an equivalent
S0588	mm
S0589	thing a creative outlet
S0588	you could put a few safety pin in it possibly
S0589	no i'm underplay the bondage
S0588	well it's time it get i mean that's so impractical cos it just like dip in things
S0589	why do you do them up like that anyway why isn't it do up
S0588	cos it doesn't that's why
S0589	no but i mean if this
S0588	okay well change the
S0588	yeah i don't know actually oh because then it stick out like that and then it hook on things i get hook on doors
S0589	and then you get trap
S0589	ah i can imagine you would darling
S0588	it's not it's really not
S0589	that's come straight off
S0588	it's such a bad coat
S0589	i'm gonna get out my craft knife
S0588	cos er to try and do it up myself be impossible as well
S0589	have you ever wash it
S0588	no
S0589	we've never wash that have we darling
S0588	but on the other hand it's really comfortable to wear but as for do it up it's all kind of buckle and zip i'm sorry darling maybe go to the and you can complain about it no but the question always be what be i gonna do from here do you know what i mean it's not oh my god what the fuck what a disaster about the past it's what where do i go from here
S0588	yeah
S0588	yeah it be
S0589	don't be so existential drink up and we'll get you some food in your tummy and then we get you home
S0588	yeah but it be a relevant question isn't it
S0589	not really no it's not that important
S0588	where do i go from here
S0589	on a on a bricks and mortar scale we've get our
S0588	but it be
S0589	house
S0588	because it be about bricks and mortar though
S0589	and our no it's get over that hurdle that stop you commit to to love me
S0588	ritual suicide
S0589	naughty stop you commit to love me for ten years ago
S0588	sorry say that again i forget i didn't hear
S0589	it stop you commit to love me ten years ago that sort of attitude
S0588	oh yeah yeah it's true cos it go very much beyond all that sorry darling i've always have a propensity to get existentialist though don't i
S0589	existential maybe you're too tipsy to eat out now
S0588	well i don't mind i'm happy to eat out or we could just go straight home if we go straight home then there be onion bread which i make myself
S0589	onion bread which you make yourself that would be our supper
S0588	mm
S0589	oh chip
S0588	which i'd have with you'd have it with cheese i'd have it with the pate that i've get leave it would be cheaper and then we could just go to bed
S0589	get half a bottle of wine at home i don't like drink wine in bed cos you splash it
S0588	yeah
S0589	and then we wake up in the morning and there's a whole
S0588	yeah
S0589	it would be nice though
S0588	it would be nice well let's
S0589	would be nice to have a quick meal
S0588	be nice to go home actually it's true
S0589	er i agree
S0588	shall we just go home sorry darling we be mean to eat weren't we wine

S0588	i think he would have be out on adventure cos it be a very nice day
S0589	that's what i mean and then when he do that he's sometimes not aware cos if he's fast asleep
S0588	that's more impractical you see cos i'll get that hook up on things
