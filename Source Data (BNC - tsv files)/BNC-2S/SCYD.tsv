S0588	yeah dunno what we're gonna eat
S0589	chickpea curry it's
S0588	oh okay
S0589	the only thing in the house
S0588	we've not even get any oil
S0589	yeah that be an issue
S0588	there's butter though
S0589	well
S0588	we can use that
S0589	i would not use butter but
S0588	erm that beanbag i want to knit it
S0589	yeah that be good i come across that
S0588	can i i be try to find
S0589	do a job
S0588	the inner bin bag not bin bag the inner beanbag though
S0589	well you just don't you just sew that as well
S0588	yeah but i need a pattern for that
S0589	i can do a pattern for that dear
S0588	could you well we could improvise somehow or we buy a really cheap one a cheap but horrible one but that's the right shape
S0589	mr will be able to sort us out
S0588	who's mr
S0589	the erm come down
S0588	i don't know who mr be
S0589	he's our local upholsterer
S0588	oh yeah
S0589	in fact he have bag of those darling where's my play
S0588	do he
S0589	where have you put my play shoe
S0588	in the cupboard
S0589	he have bag of those polystyrene bits
S0588	yeah
S0589	i'd like to have one
S0588	well we want fireproof
S0589	then i would read my book in front right in front of the fire
S0588	no but it's a really nice pattern
S0589	unless unless be already there
S0588	the actual pattern's free and i have locate the wool but
S0589	it's eighty percent polyester
S0588	and here's the downside what's polyester the wool
S0589	yeah
S0588	oh that doesn't matter
S0589	eighty twenty
S0588	erm the downside be it's gonna cost about ninety pound
S0589	mm well we can buy one for thirty nine
S0588	exactly but it's not as fun this be the whole thing of make your own things oh we can't light the fire we've get no log
S0589	they haven't email me cos it's be a week a week tomorrow and they normally say they'll do it within five to seven days
S0588	hasn't be feed
S0589	do you want to do him whilst i start supper dear
S0588	okay erm no but i feel really inspire and i want to do it
S0589	oh sweet
S0588	so despite the fact that it's go to cost ninety pound shall we do it anyway
S0589	that's just the wool
S0588	yes i mean it's ridiculous but that's what it's like when you make your own clothe and go to primark and and buy it for five quid or something but actually the advantage be i would have the pattern so i'd be in control of it from now till the rest of your live
S0588	cos i could knit another one if i want to
S0589	thing be their shelf life probably isn't particularly long
S0588	i think that's true and i'm wonder that about my hand knit cushion as well
S0589	well at least they're not on the actual floor
S0588	no cos the point that you can knit it again so it's not like when it's over it's not over kind of thing so it's the antithesis of consumer culture isn't it
S0589	be there any yoghurt leave in there that
S0588	be i right it's
S0589	be there yoghurt in there
S0588	it's the antithesis of consumer culture if you make your own
S0589	i've get to use this if that's alright
S0588	yes you agree
S0589	yes darling
S0588	yes
S0589	fee
S0588	because you can do it again
S0589	well yes okay
S0588	well what be you go to say
S0589	i think just buy one
S0588	oh not when i'm get inspire
S0589	well could you knit a tiny one just like a small footstool
S0588	no i want the one it's a nice size
S0589	just scale it down fifty percent
S0588	well it's about sixty inch diameter
S0589	would you like a beer darling
