S0262	oh wow
S0335	i didn't know if they could make it and in the end about two minutes
S0262	yeah
S0335	before the doors close
S0262	he be there and jump on board
S0335	you know he he he jump on board
S0262	yeah
S0335	so it just about all work out
S0262	oh good for you
S0335	you know it be
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm
S0262	and then you get this thing when you get down there it's like oh
S0335	yeah but we're not waste all that effort
S0262	no god no
S0335	i mean just just the logistics involve
S0262	it's the effort yeah
S0335	yeah and and the time time travel
S0262	yeah
S0335	time travel you know
S0262	yeah
S0335	mm yeah it be bite of an investment so
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	so i'm glad that we do that cos that mean
S0262	so be the other guy good
S0335	he be alright i be say to though earlier that erm a a very good guitarist and
S0262	mm
S0335	actually his bass guitarist use to be in erm suede apparently
S0262	wow
S0335	yeah and he he be really really good musically
S0335	erm the lyric be a bite simplistic on on at least some of the songs he be sort of story tell
S0262	right
S0335	which be fine
S0262	yeah
S0335	but it be very literal
S0262	right
S0335	and to give you an example of that so one of them be erm a song where he'd go back to his parents' home erm i think it be in in and it have obviously erm fall into disrepair and make him think about you know memories and stuff like that whatever and erm but some of the lyric be things like erm there be no windows on any floor then there be another line and then it be because you don't live there any more
S0335	and you just think really
S0335	isn't that a little bite teenage
S0335	a little under develop cos he mid thirties
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	and it it it we be we be go outside for a cigarette you know we be giggle about that one
S0262	yeah
S0335	i mean be i be a bitch
S0335	you know if i'm if i'm be that critical and say no
S0335	i'm the same little bite cos he have say as part of spiel this guy he say this one hasn't make it onto the erm album
S0262	cos it's shit
S0335	yeah but it stay in in the set you know
S0262	but it's part of my repertoire
S0335	yeah
S0262	it's the one of the ones i like to sing live
S0335	and and say you know yeah exactly
S0262	cos i don't have to try too hard to remember the lyric
S0335	it's it's just there it's like yeah it's just there because it's really really
S0335	and not not all of them be that bad don't get me wrong
S0262	no
S0335	like erm
S0262	so it be hit and miss in term of the track though
S0335	little bite and also i i don't know i think you can sometimes get a bite spoil if you if you're use to and you appreciate the complexities of
S0262	mm
S0335	someone like for example
S0262	yeah
S0335	and and er that sort of thing
S0262	oh gosh yeah yeah
S0335	and you've get suggestions in lyric
S0262	mm
S0335	and absolutely heart wrench vocals
S0262	mm
S0335	erm because just the power behind them as as as well as his voice be suitable for it then when someone else who's try to sort of sing their heart out it it mm yeah
S0262	yeah
S0335	it's like
S0262	yeah
S0335	it's like i say to i erm i say it this be it's a weird comparison to make but it but it pop into my head but erm you know there be some poetry that i write that i be go to read out at grandma's funeral
S0262	yeah
S0335	and i actually realise that it wasn't appropriate for public consumption
S0262	yeah
S0335	it be it be part of my process
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	and that be it and that's where it stay
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	not in a sort of british oh i'm i'm shy to express it
S0262	yeah
S0335	but actually because it be just more simplistic er childish in its
S0262	yeah
S0335	style and everything when you read it back when you weren't in the moment
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0335	you know and it it just remind me of that
S0262	yeah
S0335	so anyway about this guy he he wasn't that bad and he be
S0262	what be his name
S0335	i've forget erm
S0262	he's that shit
S0335	i know
S0335	well i i didn't recognize him anyway
S0262	right
S0335	he's not someone that i know and because i haven't be around for the last three four years

S0335	and it take a while to quieten them down even if you say you know shut up
S0335	but it's fine
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm erm so so yeah so if if he know that there be a shipment like that come over
S0262	yeah
S0335	when he first start his his issue be well who do i tell cos if i
S0262	yeah
S0335	tell the authorities they're not gonna do anything
S0262	right
S0335	partly cos they're under resourced and partly cos they don't do
S0262	be there corruption involve too
S0335	or they they they they they don't care yeah the corruption as well i mean
S0262	yeah
S0335	he wasn't ever really sure
S0262	mm
S0335	about that you know who be
S0262	yeah i suppose you can't be too sure yeah
S0335	no so you've gotta be careful
S0262	yeah
S0335	and erm can't reveal his source and all
S0262	yeah
S0335	that sort of stuff you know
S0262	yeah
S0335	so it be frustrate so in the end you know traffic and the way that they sort of produce report and try and lobby governments and stuff like that seem a sensible solution and they they do have quite a lot of oomph i guess you'd say there's some weight behind them so if there's er cite meet and things like that
S0262	cite
S0335	cite sorry so cite erm be an acronym and it's c i t e s for the convention on international trade in endanger species
S0262	oh
S0335	of flora and fauna
S0262	okay
S0335	but that's not in the bite that you say
S0262	right cite
S0335	so it's not
S0262	yeah
S0335	it's not cite off fu fu fu
S0262	yeah fu fu fu
S0335	yeah so erm
S0335	erm
S0262	so who set that up cite then when do that get set up
S0335	er seventy six
S0262	oh
S0335	i remember that cos it's the year i be bear
S0262	oh right
S0262	so that's really
S0335	that be when it be all sort of ratify and
S0262	yeah
S0335	and and become one of these things where er governments have an option to sign up to it erm and it be all about agree the level at which different species can be trade so that those trade level be sustainable
S0262	okay
S0335	erm it's not about mm hardcore conservation
S0262	yeah
S0335	of leave the world alone
S0262	yeah
S0335	it's about accept that people be gonna trade stuff
S0262	yeah
S0335	and you might as well try and control it
S0262	it be it have much of an effect
S0335	mm no
S0262	no yeah
S0335	trouble be be that cite have no teeth
S0262	yeah mm
S0335	right so there be a big hoo ha erm a couple of years ago about erm japan
S0262	mm
S0335	want to still fish bluefin tuna
S0262	mm
S0335	and what can you say you know
S0262	mm
S0335	they go round and before any meet and before any vote be take erm
S0262	oh okay
S0335	on on on on any movements or or any erm
S0262	mm
S0335	er documentation or recommendations or action or anything like that that can come out of it
S0262	mm mm
S0335	and erm they go around and lobby it's very very political
S0262	mm mm
S0335	and of course japan's get you know various erm trade agreements with various countries and they're just like come on you know you wanna keep you know your lead or whatever open or this you know university agreement open or whatever let's just forget the tuna shall we
S0262	mm
S0335	and countries you know either opt out of vote
S0262	mm
S0335	so they abstain or they vote in favour so you know but i mean that that doesn't happen all the time
S0262	no
S0335	erm but the worst that can happen be for example this year erm there be a big hoo ha about erm vietnam
S0262	mm
S0335	and the trade in rhino horn go there
S0262	mm
S0335	a lot of the time aid and abet by thailand
S0262	mm
S0335	not thailand per se the government its very self i don't mean that i mean you know certain individuals
S0262	mm
S0335	within both the government and customs etcetera
S0262	mm mm
S0335	corrupt as fuck basically
S0262	mm
S0335	and erm
S0262	and this be rhino horn go into er into vietnam
S0335	yes
S0262	from thailand
S0335	erm some of them be go through thailand and some of them just go through thai hand
S0262	okay
S0335	because some thai
S0262	what do the vietnamese do with it
S0335	oh they grind it
S0262	right
S0335	and erm drink it in a powder form it's good for hangovers and things like that and longevity and of course it's mean to be well accord to some people erm it's mean to be good for erections etcetera although that's actually not what it be ever originally use for in the
S0262	mm
S0335	sort of erm be it call be it the cornucopia he er big book of medicine
S0335	east asian medicine
S0262	right yeah
S0335	be that the right word it's something like that
S0262	mm could be i'm not too sure
S0335	anyway erm it be not actually in there as as a religion thing
S0262	right okay
S0335	but people assume it be because it's a horn and therefore it's it's it's phallic
S0262	sort of fashionable yeah and it's a horn yeah exactly yeah
S0335	yeah no what what happen a few years ago
S0262	god
S0335	probably oh god be it four or five years ago now you could easily track it back look at the media erm be that someone claim that rhino horn have cure erm cancer in a government official and of course then demand shoot through the roof and rhino start be slaughter again in africa
S0262	oh god
S0335	and the last few in asia as well erm so there's several subspecies be now extinct have about three thousand leave one of them
S0262	jeez
S0335	there might be there might i'm not sure i can't remember now but erm you know erm trouble be when they when they get to that sort of level you start get inbreeding and stuff with slow breed rat and very very sensitive nervy individuals
S0262	mm
S0335	but they just become what conservationists call non viable
S0262	right it's not it's not gonna work out as in produce anything that's it's not get
S0335	it's not the the the the
S0335	yeah what we what that mean technically non viable in in sort of biological term i guess well that that they say
S0262	yeah
S0335	be the the way they measure it be erm if a species erm if everything if everything as it be now remain constant erm the species will not erm survive in a hundred years in a healthy genetic state
S0262	jeez
S0335	so it doesn't mean they will be extinct within a hundred years
S0262	yeah
S0335	it mean that the population that be leave be gonna have inbreeding problems and all sort of stuff and it be the begin of the end it's non viable be be the word that they use which be why you might see some discussions sometimes if you ever read article in er new scientist or something
S0262	mm
S0335	discuss it sometimes it's it's controversial but they say well actually stop stop it they're go you know most sub species be already go and we should be focus on different species
S0262	oh stop it as in stop stop the effort on on for the er
S0335	yeah
S0262	resources towards the
S0335	yeah because conservation be erm have get limit resources
S0262	mm mm
S0335	erm
S0262	mm
S0335	ergo you you know stop
S0262	yeah
S0335	spend it all on i mean if you think about it in term of erm the model of medicine or something like that you don't get people throw eighty percent of their money on one specific type of cancer or something do you that's that's be prove to be very very difficult to cure they try and go for
S0262	mm things that they can actually yeah
S0335	ones that they can
S0262	mm
S0335	you know cos someone have to make those fund decisions and erm
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	yeah it's tricky though cos sort of morally you know people get well and just emotionally as well
S0262	yeah
S0335	get really wind up obviously erm but i can see it unfortunately it's it come down like most things do it come down to a cost benefit analysis and
S0262	mm
S0335	and spreadsheets and stuff
S0262	mm
S0335	so anyway
S0262	mm
S0335	there we be cheery stuff
S0262	oh no i'm it's interest it's really so traffic's what would you say its its main aim be then now erm like you know
S0335	well their role be to monitor and report on erm the international wildlife trade
S0262	right
S0335	both legal and illegal aspects of it
S0262	right
S0335	now what end up happen in place like asia well and africa and well many place be that because the law enforcement be not interest
S0262	mm
S0335	to put it mildly in look at well the illegal trade erm they actually end up also fulfil a sort of enforcement role by at least gather their you know all this information about illegal or well quite a lot of detail about the about the illegal trade
S0262	mm
S0335	and analyse that and send report
S0262	mm
S0335	to individual authorities erm and then also in general to governments and to cite etcetera
S0262	mm
S0335	to say you know these guy be be not play
S0262	mm
S0335	now if they're deal with someone who be trade into america or something fine
S0262	mm
S0335	they can get in touch with authorities
S0262	yeah
S0335	and say look out for this you know
S0262	yeah yeah exactly
S0335	this this plane or something it's you know it's snake on a plane
S0262	yeah
S0335	that sort of a thing
S0262	yeah exactly
S0335	and and sometimes something get do about it
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	erm so there be a big big erm er mainly reptile dealer call who be catch by erm the fbi a few years ago in
S0262	oh good yeah
S0335	but then he be release and
S0262	oh
S0335	and in the meantime his wife be allow to er trade with impunity basically in malaysia
S0335	erm or no sorry his pet shop be allow to continue
S0262	yeah right right
S0335	so but what's ridiculous be that the people who give out the licence for the pet shop the they're an authority call perhilitan which be the wildlife police essentially in malaysia
S0262	okay
S0335	erm they also know full well about 's behaviour but because they're all corrupt well no sorry they're not all corrupt but at the time one of their erm she be at least deputy enforcement erm a lady call erm who be publicly denounce in parliament that's how bad her reputation be within within malaysia
S0262	oh dear yeah yeah
S0335	erm she be best friends with they're very good friends obviously get pay off etcetera
S0262	oh god
S0335	and she allow all this to continue erm and i have to ask her permission i have to meet her and deal with her to set up the forensics train when i be over there do our project and she be a biatch
S0262	yeah she sound like it
S0335	she be
S0262	yeah
S0335	lovely smiley lovely lady to your face
S0262	i bet
S0335	you know and oh you know
S0262	she's harden as hard as nail
S0335	yeah
S0262	and quite evil to go with it
S0335	yeah so
S0262	underneath i can imagine
S0335	first of all she be say erm all these excuse keep come up to start it be like oh i'm sure doctor i'm i'm sure that you know you don't want to use our small laboratory and i and i be just say no no it's fine it's great well we'll make it work we're only gonna have about four scientists and and we can do you know two at a time it's perfect thank you so much for let us and i'll be in touch bye
S0335	you know and i would i would use language like that
S0262	yeah
S0335	and sort of you know
S0262	yeah just railroad her
S0335	absolutely
S0262	yeah
S0335	and in the end she couldn't do very much because we'd go and get erm a letter of support from the minister of the environment from malaysia we'd we'd be and meet him and get a letter say you know you must erm offer your support to doctor and her team
S0262	mm
S0335	and all this and this be uk fund you know project
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm through the embassy and all that sort of stuff cos it be a darwin initiative project
S0262	right
S0335	which be all you know government fund and all like that
S0262	oh right yeah
S0335	so we have all that behind us it it it add some sort of kudos if you like
S0262	yeah
S0335	and we could say don't fuck with us
S0262	yeah
S0335	because even though you don't give a shit about wildlife i'm very sure you do give a shit about the the english government's
S0262	about save face yeah yeah
S0335	the british government's
S0262	yeah
S0335	yeah opinion of you
S0262	yeah
S0335	so that be not say directly obviously
S0262	no but that be
S0335	that's there
S0262	right right next to the bundle of
S0335	mm
S0262	this be what it's actually all about
S0335	absolutely
S0262	yeah
S0335	yeah erm but what she do do erm be erm mess up things like we have a press conference and she change it from the room that be promise which be quite nice to a almost a cupboard you know where we be sit on erm literally bench and it be just embarrass
S0262	oh god
S0335	erm
S0335	i know
S0262	ready to
S0335	i i just have to i have to persevere through all of that and just think right well it be still happen it's still happen
S0262	yeah least it's go ahead
S0335	yeah
S0262	just not quite as you know
S0335	no
S0262	cos you'd imagine be set up
S0335	no and then what she do be erm she haul me over about for a seven o'clock in the morning meet about two days before this event which be quite a large event in the end and we be train various scientists in the lab but also train quite a lot of enforcement officer
S0262	right
S0335	at fake erm crime scenes so we be sort of set up the poach crime scenes and stuff like that and teach them
S0335	people like be come over and teach them you know how d'you tell the difference between erm ivory and you know fake plasticky stuff and whatever by eye can you you know
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0335	actually it's temperature a lot of the time
S0262	right
S0335	things like that and here's you know real tiger skin and here's some fake
S0262	yeah
S0335	and stuff like that
S0262	yeah
S0335	from various seizures and things
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	so they get some sort of species idea stuff
S0262	train yeah
S0335	yeah and
S0262	yeah
S0335	some basic information about cite and
S0262	yeah
S0335	all sort of stuff so anyway it be quite large with i don't know about fifty officer and about four scientists
S0262	yeah
S0335	from three different countries and erm yeah so two days before this event she call me in and say erm oh i'm so sorry but actually the bus that we promise you to take all the people from the hotel to the train venue already book it's out of my hand now it's just rubbish
S0262	yeah she's totally organise all of that
S0335	yeah mm absolutely
S0262	yeah
S0335	and then so i just say oh really well that's very unfortunate erm but don't worry we'll find an alternative and it'll still go ahead
S0262	yeah
S0335	i'll be in touch thank you for your time
S0262	yeah
S0335	you know leave
S0262	so you know from the start that she be try to
S0335	i i be wait for something like that
S0262	get you off course
S0335	yeah absolutely
S0262	you be wait to yeah yeah
S0335	and then at the so at the last minute i be run around you know try to organise taxis and sort mini vans and stuff
S0262	yeah
S0335	and i just say to people i'm so sorry there be a bus and it's be cancel
S0262	yeah
S0335	you know so
S0262	it's out of my control
S0335	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0335	yeah
S0262	but this be in my control i can still get you to the venue
S0335	yeah i will get you there you just have to go
S0262	if you just bear with us
S0335	soz man
S0262	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0335	and they're ever so nice at least
S0262	yeah
S0335	to your face i mean who know what's say behind your back but er er most of them be just lovely people cos if they be there
S0262	yeah
S0335	they be there because they want train and they be interest and a lot of them care about animals it's just
S0262	right probably quite a lot of them be aware that you know there be these sort of internal kind of conflict go on
S0335	yeah they already know full well about her
S0262	i guess yeah
S0335	mm
S0262	that that that's quite par for the course in a way
S0335	mm
S0262	though that's sorry thing to say but you know
S0335	mm absolutely
S0262	people be say one thing and do something completely different
S0335	mm
S0262	behind your back yeah
S0335	i know so
S0262	gor it's a fascinate world isn't it
S0335	mm
S0262	i'm just it's amaze to me that you know something like erm i suppose a bite of erm word of mouth and you know vietnam or
S0335	mm
S0262	find out that one official claim that he you know this rhino erm powder
S0335	mm
S0262	or whatever help
S0335	cure cancer
S0262	yeah
S0335	mm
S0262	and that that just change the whole
S0335	mm
S0262	dynamic and the whole whole
S0335	well it's actually gonna change the landscape of africa
S0262	yeah
S0335	literally because you're change the the ecosystem erm
S0262	it's just it's it yeah that kind of blow my mind in a way
S0335	yeah
S0262	but
S0335	the ramifications
S0262	yeah
S0335	be quite large
S0262	yeah
S0335	and i don't know if we i certainly don't know them all as a non sort of you know fully fledge biology person but you know
S0262	yeah
S0335	i'm i'm not i don't know the population dynamics and i don't know the full on sort of erm chain of events that be likely to happen if you take out rhinos erm but there will be a change of grassland and things like that cos they're forage
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	and they're graze
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm have a massive impact on er grass and things like that which
S0262	yeah
S0335	then affect what else can grow which then affect what else can
S0262	oh god yeah i mean climate and everything i mean you know god yeah that's massive
S0335	yeah
S0262	and then you think about the human geography too
S0335	mm
S0262	suppose in term of the
S0335	well the trouble be be that we just come along and just sort of wipe it all out anyway so
S0262	well that's true
S0335	the sad truth be be that in a lot of africa at the moment there's erm wildlife still in existence but it's within these control hunt pen for want of a better word
S0262	mm
S0335	they're call park they're call reserve or whatever
S0262	mm
S0335	but they're
S0262	they'd be a pen
S0335	fuck pen
S0262	yeah
S0335	yeah
S0262	be there much education to the people who go mm i'd like some grind erm rhino erm horn you know be d'you think there's any way of actually
S0335	mm
S0262	prove to them that the stuff that they actually take
S0335	doesn't work
S0262	suppose there isn't be there there's no real way of do that
S0335	it's really difficult cos what d'you do you say listen i've do a randomise control trial
S0262	yes yeah
S0335	all western stylie
S0262	yeah that's right
S0335	and they turn round and say fuck off with your western
S0262	yeah
S0335	claim
S0262	this be eastern medicine
S0335	this you don't this be you don't understand
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	or that's at least what the propaganda would say that's what you know you can get if you talk to erm chinese herbalists who be probably involve in the trade that's how you can sort of yeah make make me suspicious about people anyway
S0262	well this be why be say erm i mean my friend keep say oh go go go to a chinese doctor say no
S0335	no you don't know what's in it
S0262	but not necessarily i suppose doctor maybe if they're do all that kind of like you know but anything that's gonna be kinda give to me as a internal medicine as a herbal kind of medicine
S0335	mm
S0262	i'm just like na cos
S0335	mm
S0262	there's no way of bloody know what's in it you know they
S0335	mm
S0262	can tell you anything that's in it
S0335	yeah definitely
S0262	and if it's get anything in it that i definitely don't like you know rhino
S0335	mm
S0262	kind of grind down rhino or a shark fin or anything like that i'm like
S0335	mm
S0262	no way be i gonna ingest that
S0335	mm
S0262	that's just not on
S0335	i know there's erm a lot of alternatives er so so there's lot lot of people go back to your original question lot of people be do a lot of work a to educate the public
S0262	mm
S0335	that this probably doesn't work and even if it do
S0262	and it's incredibly expensive
S0335	a little bite it's incredibly expensive yeah
S0262	and it's
S0335	well that that's another issue this be where it actually get all tie in with socio economic development
S0262	yeah
S0335	because erm excuse me as you've have more of a boom in place like vietnam
S0262	mm mm mm true
S0335	erm there's socio economic development people can afford things
S0262	yeah
S0335	it's a very bourgeois thing to have
S0262	they're more affluent yeah
S0335	erm and there's very much culture of
S0262	snobbery
S0335	of of interest
S0262	yeah
S0335	yeah in status symbols
S0262	yeah
S0335	of all sort
S0262	yeah
S0335	so whereas it use to be you know tiger skin on the wall
S0262	yeah
S0335	now it's for the youngsters it's go out get piss and be able to have rhino horn as a hangover cure
S0262	yeah
S0335	and or buy it for your grandma
S0335	for cancer yeah
S0262	yeah
S0335	it's a cure all and that's the trouble with some things that be wondrous
S0262	yeah
S0335	allegedly
S0262	yeah
S0335	and also how d'you educate the whole country with without a concert government effort
S0262	no you can't you can't no no
S0335	you know especially in a what's essentially still a erm communist country
S0262	yeah
S0335	you know you can't so you've get some charities that actually focus solely on that
S0262	mm
S0335	there's erm er du du du du du who's there's a strapline when the buy stop the kill can too and i think leonardo di caprio get behind that recently
S0262	oh yeah yeah
S0335	be that be that that's not that's someone else
S0262	can't remember the name of the charity but i remember think that be a good erm that be a catchy line
S0335	mm and and so that's
S0262	yeah
S0335	really all they do it's demand
S0262	yeah
S0335	reduction
S0262	yeah
S0335	and and there's there's load of different ways that we know from both social scientists and economists about how to sort of encourage demand reduction and education be one of them
S0262	yeah
S0335	but you know offer alternatives be another and incentives not to be be another all
S0262	yeah
S0335	all sort of stuff erm but whether or not they know about all those different alternatives or whether or not they're just go to school and say don't do it man poor rhinos
S0262	yeah and then they're like
S0335	you know and it's like mm well i dunno cos then you're rely on the mechanism be a level of empathy
S0262	yeah
S0335	which animals in general
S0335	don't know how but it be it be get better apparently cos some i don't even remember the study but there be some study that people quote at me especially when i be over work with traffic they say it's gradually get better generation by generation but it's this time frame
S0262	yeah yeah it's just not go fast enough in a way be it
S0335	no especially with in place like china where they they're just hoover everything you could almost draw a map of you know say what's what's trade to and from asia it's like well if you just do shitloads of arrows from all of the south east asian countries
S0262	mm
S0335	sort of be hoover up into china you wouldn't be far wrong
S0262	mm mm
S0335	there there's also some other stuff go on
S0262	mm
S0335	you know with countries be hubs and things like that and and end destination countries as well as source countries you know sort of
S0262	yeah
S0335	have their stuff take
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	erm but china a massive massive consumer and erm will continue to be so while it's get its socio economic boom as well
S0262	yeah which doesn't really look like it's drop off in any big hurry
S0335	no absolutely not so you know oh i dunno think about pangolins and whatever be just fuck that and that's the trouble you know
S0262	god how d'you keep how d'you keep kind of the hope you know kind of alive like that sort when when you paint it as a picture like that you think to yourself well god be i ever gonna really
S0335	i don't know
S0262	solve this
S0335	i i don't know if you do and i i sort of go i definitely go through a phase d'you wanna a ciggie
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	i definitely go through a phase when i sort of think well what be i what be i do this for
S0262	i'll bring that with us be that alright
S0335	yeah sure yeah
S0262	cool
S0335	erm why why be you do this if you don't think that you're have any effect
S0262	yeah
S0335	if you're get more and more despondent almost
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	you know and then i just think well even if it's not an a full blow solution
S0262	mm
S0335	right at least it's an you're make an effort as it be and
S0262	be they up there
S0335	erm yes they be well spot
S0335	erm
S0262	me and my eagle eye
S0335	i know nicotine withdrawal
S0262	yeah you come out little buddy no okay
S0335	no
S0262	too cold for you
S0335	but i just think well at least i'm erm
S0335	be employ to do something
S0262	yes
S0335	that i care about you know and and
S0262	exactly that's the that's a good way of look at it yeah yeah that's a good way of look at it and then like this other guy you be talk about the director i mean have he not get start
S0335	mm
S0262	in the thing that you know where he felt at least as an individual i'm make some contribution
S0335	yeah
S0262	then other things don't get build on those people's work
S0335	on those people that can exactly
S0262	so
S0335	exactly yeah
S0262	it's a then there
S0335	yeah
S0262	be gap hole where no one's do anything at least if someone's
S0335	mm
S0262	do something somewhere
S0335	yeah no you're right
S0262	but it do seem very difficult to keep
S0335	mm
S0262	that belief not that you know that hope or whatever it's call i dunno
S0335	yeah
S0262	alive
S0262	well yeah i mean this be it with me education oh it's gonna be a study study students that will never change you know
S0335	mm
S0262	and they kind of you know they have this
S0335	mm
S0262	we just have a lot you know move kind of erm erm yeah not production line that's not nice to say but there's always gonna be students you know
S0335	mm
S0262	pretty much so
S0335	uhu
S0262	at least you can go okay i'm kind of you know do my little little bite
S0335	yeah it it be a production line along which they pass you know
S0262	yeah
S0335	and we can hopefully have some influence as to which paths they take within that
S0262	yeah
S0335	and what happen to them while they're no it so
S0262	but i should start focus now on the on the on the employees and the university
S0335	mm mm
S0262	cos i think
S0335	this be exactly what be talk about i mean er more more for school
S0262	you need to you need to you need to look at go alongside the organisations i mean
S0335	yeah mm mm
S0262	the students be only gonna get what's come to them
S0335	mm
S0262	as you know what i mean
S0335	mm
S0262	as if it's healthy or not
S0335	mm
S0262	if the organisation isn't healthy their experience be probably not go to be awfully healthy either
S0335	yeah
S0262	you know in term of their you know personal growth mm
S0335	yeah
S0262	i think quite a lot of the time we we make we make it out like it's the student's fault but i think sometimes there's actually the organisations not
S0335	mm
S0262	really think care enough about their employees
S0335	mm
S0262	and this be
S0335	absolutely
S0262	particularly now academics i'm focus on
S0335	mm
S0262	i'm really focus on how fuck hard it be
S0335	mm
S0262	particularly if you're under the age of fifty
S0335	yeah you think
S0262	i think so
S0335	what d'you think that's because the age
S0262	think unions contract pressure there's so many different variables but
S0335	mm
S0262	when i talk to people like yourself and i've get people in australia i talk to and i hope to branch out a little bite more and find more of these people to talk to erm be how do we do this research and teach
S0335	mm
S0262	you know
S0335	you you don't
S0262	how
S0335	at at at busy place that's the thing
S0262	yeah
S0335	yeah
S0262	but that's an organisational structural problem that could be fix
S0335	mm mm
S0262	it's not unfixable
S0335	no
S0262	you you can there be like ways you need
S0335	but where's the incentive to do it
S0262	well this be why you know people have to like me
S0335	yeah
S0262	i'm gonna pipe up and say something
S0335	mm
S0262	and i'm gonna say look i can see cos i've be work in a particular area where i'm
S0335	mm
S0262	a para academic in the sense that i go like a paralegal
S0335	mm
S0262	i mean help out the academics
S0335	mm mm
S0262	i have a professional contract yet i've get academic qualifications that consist into the academics teach side
S0335	mm mm uhu
S0335	mm
S0262	but the problem be when i come into the faculty be it wasn't obvious at all what the hell i be hang around for
S0335	mm
S0262	and i actually have to build my own network within the faculty
S0335	uhu
S0262	and across boundaries where traditionally a person like me would never get to work with an academic
S0335	mm
S0262	let alone do any research
S0335	mm
S0262	a person like me would
S0335	mm
S0262	be see as an administrator
S0335	mm
S0262	go away and do something over there
S0335	mm
S0262	or take care of students or whatever it be that you do
S0335	yeah yeah
S0262	i'm not interest
S0335	yeah
S0262	so it's actually shape around this thing call the third space
S0335	uhu
S0262	which erm an academic in london
S0335	that phrase
S0262	be talk a bite yeah but it's quite interest it's kind of like say well there's a movement of people who
S0335	mm
S0262	who be academics
S0335	mm
S0262	do need a bite of assistance
S0335	mm
S0262	and there can be people like myself who can be useful erm and that we need to be as professionals we need to be give a bite more recognition i think for the input that we have
S0335	mm
S0262	you know so that's the paper we're write at the moment
S0335	okay that's cool
S0262	yeah yeah yeah it be really good because i'm not work for the university
S0335	mm
S0262	so i've get the head of department of where i be work
S0335	uhu
S0262	i be second into it
S0335	uhu
S0262	and i've ask her if she'd be interview for this paper
S0335	okay
S0262	cos i don't wanna slag off the management
S0335	mm mm you've gotta you've gotta be careful
S0262	without know what their perspective be
S0335	mm
S0262	well you've gotta be careful too and that's what i be talk to him about on sunday right i be go what's the ethics behind this what be our ethical framework here
S0335	mm
S0262	we're do action research but
S0335	mm
S0262	what be the you know he be like er
S0335	mm uhu yeah
S0335	don't wanna lose my job
S0262	yeah exactly
S0335	i don't wanna be see as a whistle blower just for have an honest chat
S0262	yeah
S0335	yeah
S0262	well there's that that's the thing you know
S0335	mm
S0262	but erm but yeah in term of ethical considerations what sort of things do you have to take to into account in your kind of field
S0335	oh
S0262	well if you're write a paper for example what sort of things be front of mind for you in term of ethics
S0335	erm well if you if it's a researchy one then erm you've already go through an ethics process for the actual research itself which be the usual stuff i guess if you've have participants
S0262	mm
S0335	that be people they're gonna know the purpose of the research and that you know they will remain anonymous if that's what they want data protection erm data store when it's destroy all that sort of stuff
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm the purpose of the research
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm the fact that they have a right to withdraw at any stage
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm
S0262	so you'll go through to an ethics committee what and you're er they'll they'll be submit and then it will be either prove or knock back
S0335	yeah yeah
S0262	yeah
S0335	yeah erm with recommendations or whatever
S0262	yeah
S0335	and so there's em committees
S0262	d'you mind if i have a coffee be that alright
S0335	yeah no go for it
S0262	thank you
S0335	i'll er put er kettle on
S0262	put that on so 's get kind of probably what a faculty ethics committee who be within
S0335	yeah there's well there's a there's a i dunno what be it there's the erm drep which be the the departmental research ethics panel
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm and then there's a sort of sub committee of that
S0262	yeah
S0335	within specialisations
S0262	yeah
S0335	so we've get a frep which be the forensics
S0262	right
S0335	research ethics panel
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm
S0262	so what kind of academics fee in be that a voluntary position if you're actually work
S0335	so yeah so i i sit on that partly cos i want to learn more about the specific ethics within this organisation
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0335	erm and also erm just to have a sort of a voluntary thing that i be kind of interest in anyway
S0262	yeah
S0335	cos if i'm think about research ideas i don't want to get so far down the line and then only later realise that it's not viable because of
S0262	yeah
S0335	some ethics issue that i never hadn't foresee or whatever
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	erm but then when you're when so er d'you want caffeine or non caffeine
S0262	non caffeine's fine for me thank
S0335	yeah non caffeine
S0262	oh yeah non caffeine whatever
S0262	like yeah that's a good idea too
S0335	that's two there's still caffeine
S0262	mm
S0335	it's
S0335	and i won't do you a whole tablespoon we've run out of teaspoons
S0262	mm
S0335	so i speak oh to the erm you know erm so when you're actually write a paper you you've gotta be i don't know first and foremost when i'm write i try and think about sort of the clarity of the language and things and then
S0262	yeah
S0335	make it suitable for the intend audience
S0262	yeah
S0335	so be it for academics or be it gonna be publish in an academic place but you're hop it's actually gonna come to the attention of a policy maker
S0262	yeah
S0335	who want really clear recommendations the specific action point
S0262	okay
S0335	you know very
S0262	yeah
S0335	very clearly in the summary and conclusion erm if you're criticise anyone else's work it's a question of politeness
S0262	yeah
S0335	rather than ethics but it's
S0262	yeah
S0335	sort of an overlap there
S0262	yeah
S0335	about acknowledge where their work be good or what it have be good for
S0262	mm
S0335	and why it might might now be outdated
S0262	uhu
S0335	or have be prove incomplete or
S0262	mm
S0335	slightly wrong or whatever
S0262	uhu
S0335	erm
S0262	d'you actually find that much though when you're read academic erm journal article
S0335	mm it depend who's it depend who's write i'm i one thing that i like about the group of people that i get involve with for my master and my phd who be erm specialists in crime prevention
S0262	yeah
S0335	forensics erm be that there be a very courteous erm style
S0262	right
S0335	and a and a very simple erm
S0262	thank you
S0335	they would definitely win prize for the campaign for for real english
S0262	right
S0335	you know so a campaign
S0262	yeah
S0335	for plain english be it
S0262	plain english yeah
S0335	with with that diamond symbol
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm because you know
S0262	thank you
S0335	a a paper would start out by say in the nineteen sixties erm car theft be go through the roof erm it be cost
S0262	ta
S0335	an estimate blah blah blah million
S0262	yeah
S0335	you know insurance be erm increase
S0262	thank you
S0335	it be cost the police which be therefore cost the public
S0262	yeah
S0335	you know this much money or whatever erm but car manufacturers be do little slash nothing about it
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm therefore erm we're we be try to find a way or therefore it be necessary to erm find a way to erm incentivise some more socially responsible behaviour
S0262	okay
S0335	by the manufacturers
S0262	uhu
S0335	one thing that they do that be do be that a car theft index
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm be publish
S0262	okay
S0335	so that people know which be the most risky cars to be
S0262	uhu
S0335	erm to own
S0262	yeah
S0335	therefore insurance become an issue
S0262	uhu
S0335	erm or sorry the insurance industries get involve
S0262	mm
S0335	therefore there be an incentive for the manufacturers to internalise which be an economic term
S0262	right
S0335	for take on the cost
S0262	okay
S0335	of add things like immobilisers central lock
S0262	yeah
S0335	all that sort of stuff
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm this paper erm tell the story of the development of that index and erm give evidence of erm its effectiveness
S0262	okay yeah
S0335	and and that's your abstract
S0262	yeah
S0335	you know
S0262	yeah
S0335	and and so it's not at all erm erm ambiguous
S0262	yeah
S0335	it's not convolute language
S0262	yeah
S0335	it be the the the
S0262	it be like what it be like yeah
S0335	yeah this this be the problem this be what happen
S0262	uhu
S0335	and this be what this paper's gonna talk about
S0262	yeah
S0335	and you just think right okay i'm totally on board with that
S0262	mm
S0335	i i therefore decide whether or not to keep read you know because
S0262	yeah
S0335	i don't have to sort of search to sort of work
S0262	yeah
S0335	out whether or not it's relevant or whether or not it's erm i dunno someone pull the wool over my eye a bite
S0262	yeah
S0335	so i just need a publication to keep my career go or whatever
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0335	so i i do find that within that erm specialism and i like it
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm and you do find it in the hard sciences i think to an
S0262	mm
S0335	extent because you're often talk about sorry you're often read about the result of experiment
S0262	mm
S0335	you know
S0262	mm mm
S0335	and that always start with a literature review which say this be what's be do in the past
S0262	mm be they systematic ones or systemic
S0335	erm
S0335	systematic
S0262	it be systematic isn't it yeah
S0335	it it it it should've be at at least erm you know reasonably systematic
S0262	yeah
S0335	literature review erm
S0262	yeah
S0335	if it's in a a highly rank journal
S0262	mm
S0335	otherwise it wouldn't be accept
S0262	mm
S0335	so you say this be what's go before
S0262	uhu
S0335	therefore the gap in knowledge be here
S0262	uhu
S0335	this paper therefore erm
S0262	address that
S0335	address part of that gap
S0262	yeah
S0335	by blah blah blah in the
S0262	right
S0335	experiment you know
S0262	yeah
S0335	and then it go on to the experiment and the result
S0262	yeah
S0335	and again you you know it might be a slightly longwinded way of say it but a you know where it's go
S0262	yeah
S0335	and b it very quickly capture you up on a whole erm specialise area
S0262	right
S0335	if you read the literature review
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm so you know where they be
S0262	so that's very different from the i suppose the yeah the history of of of academic erm write about education erm
S0335	uhu
S0262	you know as a social science and be it even a discipline in its own right you know there be still massive question about that which you know you find in the way that researchers write or academics write about education be that they themselves aren't too sure quite a lot of the time what actually be education be it a subject
S0335	mm
S0262	be it a science be it
S0335	a process
S0262	yeah it's it's it you know it
S0335	mm
S0262	it's come from very different origins you know
S0335	mm
S0262	education and and i i find that quite a lot it's that's why where the ambiguity lie
S0335	okay
S0262	which i think be why my you know i be tell you about my five thousand word essay which i do for my master which be you know all about these paradigms
S0335	mm
S0262	about four different paradigms that can exist you know for in education i think for research purpose
S0335	mm
S0262	i don't sit there and go i'm a teacher and i have a constructivist point you know paradigm position you know i don't
S0335	mm
S0262	i don't think like that
S0335	no
S0262	for some reason that be you see that more and more i don't know if it's more of a fashion or it's try to address a real deep root issue which be we don't actually know
S0262	what constitute erm you know the the pillars let's say
S0335	mm
S0262	of education and and educational research
S0335	mm
S0262	it's very wishy washy so there have be people in the past who've heavily criticise this i mean i can
S0335	mm
S0262	think of a few and they're very much involve in policy but they're miles older now i mean they're in their sixties
S0335	uhu
S0262	you know they be address it when really come to light
S0335	mm
S0262	erm and of course they have public debate as well about it you know with it be a public you know good in the sense of education but i find for me even to get start now on this paper which be quite a curious one because as i say i'm not an a researcher i'm not on the payroll as an academic erm though the person i'm write with be
S0335	mm
S0262	but i'm not and you know my my question i keep question be the ethical framework behind it which i can find something to kind of rest on
S0335	uhu
S0262	but still the the the the role that i'm play could be see as a participant in research
S0335	okay yeah
S0262	yeah i'm not anonymous
S0335	mm
S0262	i could be
S0335	uhu
S0262	but that mean then i don't
S0262	yeah
S0335	mm
S0262	and that's the thing i'm really try to figure out at the moment be be it really about be a participant in the study or be it actually about be a name author a person who have have this experience
S0335	mm
S0262	and it be part of a grow nascent area of research in education this third space but i can see that quite a lot of people might just look at it and go so what
S0335	mm
S0262	so you turn up for work each day and you have some frustrate experience but well so don't we all so you know the that's that's the question i'm try to answer at the moment be how do you get the message across without come across as be i dunno i suppose highly critical
S0335	uhu
S0262	critical would be alright
S0335	uhu
S0262	but what be i actually criticise you know i could be just criticise my line manager and nobody be gonna be particularly interest in that so
S0335	well okay so one way to reframe that maybe that might be helpful would be to not think of it in term of criticisms you think of it in term of observations
S0262	mm
S0335	so can you come up with a list of recur situations theme
S0262	uhu
S0335	question source of confusion whatever
S0262	uhu
S0335	all any all of the above and more
S0262	uhu uhu
S0335	you almost want to come up with a list
S0262	uhu
S0335	and say you know this keep happen for example
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm you know doctor x be try to teach class y
S0262	and give a and give a yeah
S0335	and
S0262	yeah
S0335	blah blah blah and give an example where you can
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm
S0262	yeah it's a good idea i like that yeah that's er observations
S0335	observations
S0262	yeah
S0335	that's what you start with
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	and then you can discuss where the source of those of the issue which cause those observations or the situations which lead to those observations
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm and i think it's okay to say you haven't get all the answer
S0262	mm
S0335	to that bite
S0262	mm
S0335	and that's actually why further research be necessary
S0262	uhu
S0335	and actually more participants be need
S0262	uhu
S0335	and more action research be need
S0262	uhu
S0335	and that would lead on naturally to the recommendation that
S0262	yeah
S0335	in essence more people like me be need
S0262	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0335	you know
S0262	yeah that's it yeah
S0335	and and then you the so then the overall purpose of the paper be erm to argue the case with evidence
S0262	yeah
S0335	of why this role
S0262	yeah
S0335	and further research into it be be important
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm yeah so so that i mean that's that's one of things isn't it you've gotta be clear what your what the purpose of the paper be from
S0262	yeah
S0335	the start
S0262	yeah
S0335	you always need to you always need to write your erm conclusions and what you come out conclusions and recommendations before you write the rest of it
S0262	yeah
S0335	at at least have them sketch in your head
S0262	yeah
S0335	and and then you tailor the paper so that you logically argue up
S0262	yeah
S0335	up to that conclusion
S0262	yeah yeah yeah yeah i know what you mean yeah
S0335	and you might have ten other point that you want to make
S0262	mm
S0335	but you save them
S0262	mm
S0335	and that's that's the skill
S0335	i think in good academic write
S0262	yeah
S0335	a clear paper argue strongly along one line
S0262	one yeah
S0335	to to deal with it thoroughly
S0262	main argument yeah
S0335	and okay you acknowledge that other areas exist and they will be address
S0262	yeah
S0335	you know in in other article and whatever
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	so people can't say oh you didn't think of this
S0262	yeah
S0335	say well actually i do and if you read it i do actually
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	you know
S0262	yeah
S0335	and and obviously there's an element of that
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm but be
S0262	yeah
S0335	really clear on your purpose
S0262	yeah
S0335	what
S0262	yeah
S0335	you want out of it
S0262	yeah
S0335	you know so first of all its intend audience and
S0262	uhu
S0335	purpose of your paper
S0262	uhu
S0335	be it policy makers d'you wanna
S0262	uhu
S0335	d'you wanna erm people to create more job
S0262	uhu
S0335	people like you essentially
S0262	uhu well this be where i'm think about erm how do one decide on which erm paper to submit to cos i be think if you have a clear idea two or three you know say journals that
S0335	uhu
S0262	you think this type of research would fit into quite nicely
S0335	uhu
S0262	you can work backwards then in
S0335	yeah
S0262	term of look at what the intend audience for that journal
S0335	yeah
S0262	you can look at the style
S0335	etcetera etcetera
S0262	you can look at what's
S0335	yeah
S0262	just go before the year before so don't cover that because they're probably not gonna be
S0335	mm
S0262	interest to the editors or whoever
S0335	well no there would be if it be a logical progression from that
S0262	true true
S0335	yeah
S0262	so i be think well you know do you target erm definitely have a look at those ones or d'you go you know into an area that say that might actually be er quite useful for some erm you know journals where they perhaps they're not even aware yet
S0335	mm
S0262	of this type of research that's come through
S0335	mm
S0262	or maybe have a two pronged effect you go for the ones where already begin become establish and you try a
S0335	yeah and do do your in depth
S0262	a a wildcard kind of
S0335	beardy strokey one for there
S0262	yeah
S0335	and your simple policy orient to the point one
S0262	yeah
S0335	as almost a letter
S0262	yeah
S0335	to a a a erm a practitioner's journal
S0262	yeah
S0335	or something
S0262	yeah
S0335	or a i don't know what be there be there sort of a a circular of the higher education authority
S0262	yeah
S0335	or something
S0262	yeah
S0335	you know research note
S0262	yeah
S0335	or something
S0262	yeah
S0335	can you get a
S0262	yeah
S0335	you know be be there that sort of practitioner policy maker erm route
S0262	there be there's the higher education academy and they
S0335	right
S0262	commission small you know small erm piece of research i mean that's commission you know erm
S0335	uhu
S0262	but yeah inside there yeah you're right research note that would assist
S0335	yeah
S0262	erm
S0335	the poor
S0262	they're
S0335	the poor bugger who've gotta keep on top of all of this
S0262	yeah
S0335	research
S0262	exactly
S0335	to then come up with relevant
S0262	yeah
S0335	and up to date policy
S0262	yeah
S0335	yeah
S0262	cos i find one paper that's just it's the first paper that er i'm aware of at the moment anyway i can't find any others but i mean you know there could be something but erm anyway let's just say i find one paper that's just be commission and publish last year erm no actually it be earlier this year into this idea of academic and professional partnerships
S0335	mm
S0262	and how that feed into
S0335	mm
S0262	overarch organisational strategies of the universities and blah blah blah
S0335	mm
S0262	so there be two academics you know lead erm investigators on that on that erm publication which be direct towards i would say policy makers
S0335	uhu
S0262	and practitioners less so a academic audience
S0335	mm
S0262	erm but whether get in touch with those two professors
S0335	mm
S0262	and say i be actually currently write a paper
S0335	uhu
S0262	that feed directly into what you're say that you didn't get from your research
S0335	uhu
S0262	cos they only have an eight percent respondent
S0335	right
S0262	a response rate on their survey
S0335	right
S0262	and they're clearly say what they need more of
S0335	yeah
S0262	they need more model and case study
S0335	uhu
S0262	so i be think why not give it a go and just see if i contact these two
S0335	uhu
S0262	and say what kind of ideas advice or you know sort of directions do you think this would most be useful to as a contribution you know
S0335	mm
S0262	and maybe they have some ideas about how to be a bite more point about
S0335	maybe but i also be careful how much you give away i'm sure you know this already but
S0262	mm
S0335	it it it's so difficult isn't it because they get people who either jump on a bandwagon and say oh well i if if i co author with you
S0262	yeah
S0335	then we're go to this journal
S0262	yeah
S0335	when actually they've do bugger all work
S0262	yeah
S0335	and all of a sudden you dilute your input if you like
S0262	yeah
S0335	and all that stuff so
S0262	yeah
S0335	if you want that to if that bother you
S0262	yeah
S0335	that's something to keep an eye on if you don't know i mean you trust you hope that people be nice you know and
S0262	mm
S0335	trust people and stuff
S0262	yeah yeah i know but
S0335	but
S0262	i know i'm just well aware that that doesn't really happen very much yeah
S0335	no isn't it horrible to even
S0262	yeah
S0335	have to have that conversation
S0262	yeah
S0335	but it's it's true so can you ask around first of all before you even approach them and you think oh for fuck's sake do i really want to have to do research on the research before
S0262	yeah
S0335	i talk about these people about my research and you know
S0262	yeah exactly yeah yeah
S0335	ah god
S0262	it's just yeah just tie yourself up in knot that way wouldn't you
S0335	absolutely
S0262	yeah
S0335	so do you take a leap of faith and trust in it
S0262	yeah
S0335	or
S0262	yeah
S0335	and in them i mean
S0262	yeah
S0335	but also i don't know if you come across as a little bite erm i don't know whether or not admit that you don't know where to put your stuff be a good thing cos it look like you're not an expert in your field
S0262	mm well which i'm not i'm a practitioner in the sense that
S0335	okay
S0262	you know i'm not an academic
S0335	okay
S0262	so i'm not task with you know right i wanna see you know three or four publications per year in your in your field you know
S0335	yeah okay yeah so there be that so in that way you've get less to lose i guess yeah
S0262	well yeah both of us haven't get
S0335	like by just contact them
S0262	we haven't neither of us get anything to lose because erm the guy i'm work with erm
S0335	uhu
S0262	his his field for research in his current position erm be way way off the what we're do he's in industrial relations
S0335	oh okay right yeah
S0262	and and and other stuff
S0335	yeah
S0262	you know stuff to do with the aviation sort of industries
S0335	yeah oh i've just have a think
S0262	mm
S0335	erm now then erm be friends with a guy call who they they just i just go round for dinner with the other night
S0262	uhu
S0335	cos he's good friends erm of his from his childhood and everything and erm he say you know it's like you you need to be tell sort of a thing it's like
S0262	yeah
S0335	okay it be one of one of one of those stag of relationship sort of things that be like woo
S0262	all good
S0335	erm it's you know it's it's it's
S0262	time to meet
S0335	it's almost one up from meet the parent
S0262	yeah
S0335	you know it really be it be like okay this this be important
S0335	erm but anyway so cook a really nice meal and and his wife be lovely so they both teach erm in secondary school
S0262	uhu
S0335	erm be very involve in unions and stuff like that
S0262	uhu
S0335	cos he's actually erm very active in the socialist work party
S0262	yeah
S0335	stuff like that
S0262	yeah
S0335	and erm anyway he would probably know about the different field or who to talk to in
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	about who's more sort of active about this as well
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	i think
S0262	that would be good yeah
S0335	so i can ask to ask
S0262	i i do need to start network out and
S0335	yeah
S0262	locally in would be a great place
S0335	and and that that's a start because
S0262	yeah
S0335	there you've get a
S0262	yeah
S0335	you know
S0262	get in
S0335	er yeah get one potential in
S0262	yeah
S0335	of of someone who i think be be well connect
S0262	yeah
S0335	i think he's run for councillor a couple of time and stuff so as well as his
S0262	right okay yeah
S0335	be a teacher side
S0262	yeah
S0335	and his sort of you know just generally be one of those people who's interest in and active
S0262	yeah
S0335	in all sort of aspects of of life
S0262	yeah
S0335	he's he's gonna be well connect
S0262	yeah
S0335	because of otherwise i don't think he would've run you know
S0262	yeah
S0335	i don't know
S0262	yeah
S0335	you may fundamentally disagree with his politics and everything
S0262	yeah
S0335	and i'm not entirely sure myself but erm doesn't mean you can't be mat where where where you and useful to each other where you overlap
S0262	yeah
S0335	you know
S0262	yeah
S0335	so
S0262	yeah well that's true erm you know because that be another that's another area in term of
S0335	network be important isn't it
S0262	you know yeah it be network
S0335	so start with friends
S0262	yeah
S0335	who can
S0262	but it's also be unaware of these type of third space perhaps erm if you know
S0335	yeah who know what else be already happen
S0262	that might happen in secondary it might be happen in further education it's not just you know exclusive to her education it's not just you know exclusive to her education
S0335	well like i say erm she's really not feel great today and i say oh d'you wanna chat you know about education and stuff and cos she be you know her phd and
S0262	yeah
S0335	whatever yesterday and she say oh not today actually i'm just blugh
S0262	yeah she's just she's feel tire
S0335	she's feel be high be high on
S0262	yeah
S0335	painkillers cos her back's
S0262	yeah
S0335	i mean she be crawl to the bathroom yesterday
S0262	oh god
S0335	you know back totally totally go so ehs'
S0262	be she gonna see someone
S0335	yeah she's be to the doctor and she's refer to a specialist
S0262	right
S0335	and and you know wait for all that to kick in
S0262	yeah
S0335	so erm but another time
S0262	yeah another time definitely
S0335	talk to her about her job at one of the colleges
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm where er she's basically a a sort of learn advisor and
S0262	yeah
S0335	that that sort
S0262	yeah well that's kind of my position
S0335	and all all sort of support to the staff
S0262	learn advisor
S0335	yeah absolutely
S0262	yeah
S0335	so she would be if she be at a different school she be say her her job would be lead practitioner
S0262	yeah
S0335	and probably deputy head
S0262	yeah
S0335	that she's that
S0262	yeah
S0335	that level
S0262	yeah
S0335	so very very useful and
S0262	yeah
S0335	again for authorities and probably magazines and stuff
S0262	yeah
S0335	that professionals and practitioners
S0262	do read
S0335	read so
S0262	uhu
S0335	have a chat to a few people i would say friendly people
S0262	uhu yeah
S0335	who be mat of mat in
S0262	yeah
S0335	probably before you contact those professors
S0262	yes
S0335	erm or whoever they be
S0262	yeah
S0335	who do that publication
S0262	yeah yeah yeah you're right
S0335	erm
S0262	yeah you're right cos those two professors probably think great we've get fund from hea which be already a very good start
S0335	uhu
S0262	they're probably just gonna keep on try to get as much fund as possible
S0335	mm
S0262	to conduct that type of research so in a way now when you be think be careful
S0335	mm
S0262	i be think they might actually see somebody like myself as a kinda like well do she fit in with our thing or be she actually try to go for fund
S0335	yeah it
S0262	as well
S0335	i know so so it could go either
S0262	yeah
S0335	way because they actually need a research assistant d'you want a job
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	and it's like woo hoo i tell you i should've phone him earlier you know i'm sorry
S0262	yeah
S0335	cynical
S0262	yeah
S0335	but you know
S0262	yeah but normally they have their in crowd of research assistants of pool of people that they
S0335	probably but maybe not
S0335	maybe maybe they've make these observations and don't know how to take it much further cos they're limit you know you don't know
S0262	well also yeah depend on whether their peer look at it and think you've do a good job here or
S0335	mm
S0262	didn't quite hit the mark in term of what you set out to do you know because they've put limitations down about
S0335	mm
S0262	you know why the people didn't respond to the survey and
S0335	right
S0262	sort of things but erm quite frankly i don't sort of really accept that i
S0335	mm
S0262	think that should've be think through much much more there's so much they should share on on survey fatigue
S0335	better better research design yeah exactly
S0262	and then it's
S0335	yeah
S0262	star you in the face if you know anything
S0335	yeah
S0262	about you know
S0335	exactly
S0262	work at university
S0335	yeah
S0262	the students and the staff you know
S0335	yeah
S0262	so i try to you know
S0335	yeah but maybe they didn't have the time to do the you know the gold standard one to one face to face interview
S0262	yeah erm
S0335	you know
S0262	no they they structure it as a survey and then they ask at the end if you'd like to be take part as in the focus group
S0335	uhu
S0262	so self selection
S0335	uhu
S0262	or so you know
S0335	uhu
S0262	and and then not a lot of people do
S0335	mm
S0262	and then not a lot of people turn up on the day for the focus group
S0335	yeah well they wouldn't've have time
S0262	yeah
S0335	i'm not surprise yeah
S0262	yeah
S0335	i i don't go to talk and things that interest me let alone someone's research that i'm sort of do as a favour
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	you know er you just don't
S0262	yeah you just don't have the time
S0335	it's no unfortunately which be erm you know so you're in a catch twenty twenty two situation
S0262	yeah
S0335	and actually that's definitely something to put in your paper be find give participants the time
S0262	yeah
S0335	to participate in this sort of research so that it can be do
S0262	yeah
S0335	to come
S0262	yeah
S0335	up with action point
S0262	very true
S0335	it's it's it's isn't it yeah
S0262	that's a really good recommendation yeah that be vital to the success of any of this kind of action research
S0335	mm
S0262	cos it be action research
S0335	mm
S0262	and that in its framework really do require people to
S0335	participation
S0262	to fully participate you know
S0335	yeah absolutely
S0262	yeah so
S0335	yeah
S0262	the other way i be look at it as well be like maybe cos ethics thing just keep
S0335	mm
S0262	so somebody who say to oh who be it cos we be discuss cos he's get an academic background
S0335	uhu
S0262	he say no no i wouldn't worry about it
S0335	yeah
S0262	you just go ahead and write your paper and be aid why be that and he go they're your veiws
S0335	yeah
S0262	you can just write in you know your view be not necessarily the view of the institution
S0335	mm
S0262	or any institution
S0335	exactly yeah
S0262	and you know you might piss a few people off but who
S0335	important work often do
S0262	oh you mean yeah
S0335	important work often do actually you've get to rattle cage and things
S0262	yeah
S0335	otherwise what be you do you're just describe if you if you're push to
S0262	yeah
S0335	for change
S0262	yeah yeah
S0335	you know how do change happen a lot of the time
S0262	yeah
S0335	your your point there's there's a problem you've gotta point it out
S0262	yeah
S0335	there's no get away from that i i think one of the things that i i be gonna say to you but er i didn't cos we then sort of move on a bite be that erm it's i think it's just totally your call about whether or not you you do it or not and and and er be er name or not it depend whether or not it's a battle that you actually want to fight that i think that's all it come down to
S0262	mm
S0335	and if you want to be
S0262	mm
S0335	see as sort of champion this champion this
S0262	mm
S0335	sorry and sort of campaign for it if you like then which you seem to want to
S0262	yeah they you'd need your name
S0335	then then
S0262	yeah attach to the
S0335	you've get to do your name and you've get to do it
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm whereas if you if you don't then well it just doesn't make sense to me to be do it if you don't want to be name on it actually
S0262	yeah
S0335	erm because
S0262	yeah
S0335	the whole thing that you're say be that you think you're bring something new to to it and also say give us a job as well
S0262	yeah yeah well that's it
S0335	you know
S0262	yeah
S0335	so erm
S0262	well this be what say er say
S0335	like i don't see why you wouldn't
S0262	think of what you be call learn advisor
S0335	uhu
S0262	therefore you be erm
S0335	sorry
S0262	you be employ in an advisory role
S0335	uhu
S0262	therefore the skills that you have require you to be able to do that
S0335	uhu
S0262	you're a level seven so you're not you know right at middle management say level nine level ten but level seven's like you know clearly you can progress into management kind of you know and he say if you're in an advisory role you can look at it as a kind of internal consultancy
S0335	mm
S0262	whereas you're really say you know i've be at the cold edge of this bite i can i've observe this
S0335	mm
S0262	but i've actually now network around the university and understand that you know things be feed in from all kinds of different place it's
S0335	mm
S0262	not just me go me my job and i and me me me
S0335	yeah
S0262	and also the
S0335	yeah
S0262	academic help because when he start talk
S0335	mm
S0262	in his narrative
S0335	uhu
S0262	it's like how be i mean to do all of this research output
S0335	yeah and that and that
S0262	all of these new course
S0335	yeah
S0262	with no time to develop either of these things
S0335	mm
S0262	and you be squeeze
S0335	i know
S0262	into a nothingness in a way
S0335	mm
S0262	you you just can't operate one way or the other way and the burnout that come from that be just
S0335	uhu
S0262	you know so who's gonna win out of that situation the institutions aren't cos they're you know as in term they're human capital
S0335	yeah
S0262	gonna fall by the wayside
S0335	absolutely
S0262	and then you get probably shittier lecturers or not even lecturers
S0335	staff turnover's gonna be massive yeah
S0262	people who haven't even get academic credentials you know
S0262	lecture so
S0335	yeah absolutely it's it's just it's gonna get worse and worse
S0262	it's gonna get worse and worse
S0335	yeah and it's
S0262	yeah
S0335	it's get worse
S0262	yeah
S0335	oh oh no no cake for doggies hello baby
S0335	this be this be
S0262	i might just
S0335	she's very cute
S0262	switch this off now gosh we've be talk for a
