S0517	last year and she have get over it or she's have a scan and it hadn't erm come it it be okay

S0518	oh no
S0517	that she couldn't get rid off well exactly she keep say oh it's a cough and they'd give her antibiotics then there'd be a break and then there'd be this
S0518	mm
S0517	but anyway just before half term i speak to her and erm she'd be rush into hospital and diagnose with pneumonia so i immediately think oh no cancer of the lung it's come back
S0518	mm
S0517	but they give her antibiotics and they let her out erm and that be only the week before half term so we're only talk two weeks ago and she'd have a scan and i think she be with the oncologist who say and i don't know why he's not qualify but he'd say i'm not qualify to look at this scan think it be the radiologist that have to look at it
S0518	mm
S0517	but he say i have look at a few and it look okay to me so you know so i be think oh well that's a relief it's still okay but she have she do have pneumonia and i'm think oh
S0518	how strong be she
S0517	yeah and you know cos you just your immune system's low isn't it anyway in half term i come home one day from get my nail do and erm say oh 's phone i say oh he say it's not good news i say oh what's the matter he say apparently erm the proper person have read this scan and they'd say that the cancer's back
S0517	it's in the line of the liver
S0518	oh
S0517	and somewhere else and somewhere else and they're go to do chemotherapy but they say to her that erm she need to know they're do this not to cure it just to extend her life
S0518	oh
S0517	and she say she didn't want to know cos i've speak to her since have speak to so i'm not sure how much know cos i phone back a few days later cos i think oh god what what be i gonna say i don't know what to say it be awful
S0518	mm
S0517	but when i phone her back she say oh erm she didn't want to know about life expectancy and i don't know whether she still know or not but have say to that the the doctor have say to him up to two years
S0518	they could extend it for
S0517	that's would be her life expectancy now
S0517	up to two years but then you don't know what her quality of life'll be for those two years do you or it might not be two years so she probably won't make fifty
S0518	do she want to spend those two years go constantly through chemotherapy radiotherapy
S0517	i know
S0518	feel like that
S0517	and her children be months younger than mine
S0518	oh
S0517	she get them years nine and not sure if 's in year ten or eleven either way he's do his gcses
S0518	mm

S0518	oh that's terrible that be
S0517	awful
S0518	that's awful
S0517	i don't know what to say i just think oh my cos she say oh you know she'd be quite when she be diagnose last year she be very positive
S0518	mm
S0517	you know i'm gonna beat this
S0518	and she do
S0517	and and she do
S0518	yeah
S0517	and she say to me on the phone this week she say you know i always know it would get me it would come back but she say i really genuinely believe that i would maybe have ten fifteen years before
S0518	yeah
S0517	now she say you know i i won't even get the school i might not
S0518	mm
S0517	how awful and then she be do all this you will be there for after won't you i think oh
S0518	mm god
S0517	just awful
S0518	i'm so sorry
S0517	oh it be really
S0518	i think about her the other day because i think oh i haven't ask for i think it be when we have after we'd have coffee a couple of weeks ago and i think i know what i'm mean to ask you and i didn't ask you
S0517	yeah well i mean and i've only speak to her sort of on and off cos obviously they're down in so
S0518	mm mm
S0517	and i really must go and go get down and see her now but
S0518	mm
S0517	it's so difficult cos all of our weekend be busy but i think i'm gonna have to just go on my own
S0518	mm yeah
S0517	let
S0518	you can do that can't you
S0517	yes but they always want us all to go cos her boys you know they're similar age to my boys and we've have holiday with them we've be up to the lakes together and we've be away and they
S0518	mm oh
S0517	you know they always ask after them but but i will go down
S0518	might just have to have a weekend and say to and we're not do hockey and football
S0517	on we're not do not do everything
S0518	weekend yeah we're go away for a weekend it's important so
S0517	yeah yeah i know but it's awful though i just think to myself i cannot imagine what you would what you would do what you would plan to do what you would want to do
S0518	mm
S0517	but you can't even do it because your children be at school you can't even say oh i'll go
S0517	and see a bite of the world i can't you can't you can't can you can't do anything
S0518	yeah well there be yeah no no no there's a friend of ours in the and he have bowel cancer but he do have ten years so you know they do and the daughters be grow up so they be able to travel and to do this and
S0517	yeah yeah
S0518	you know he erm buy a mobile caravan and put it somewhere so really nice so that he when he know when he wasn't there would have somewhere to go for holiday and stuff like that and he totally he get the house completely all make perfect so there wasn't anything for her to worry about
S0517	yeah
S0518	and they just do everything that they'd want to do
S0517	mm
S0518	but they have ten years to do that
S0517	have they sort of expect ten years though
S0518	yeah
S0517	or be it one of those where the doctor have say and then they'd you know defy the doctor and
S0518	no
S0517	live long oh
S0518	no
S0517	they do
S0518	because his i remember when he tell us it be the end of a committee meet any other business yes
S0517	ah oh no
S0518	i've get i've get bowel cancer but he say
S0517	oh
S0518	he know because it it's what his mother have and when he start with his symptoms he just think here we go so he be not surprise when he get that diagnosis
S0517	really okay
S0518	but it be basically they say we can operate we can do this we can do this we can do this and you know erm it it probably will kill you in the end however it you will have a you know a few more years leave
S0517	oh okay
S0518	because i think in the end that do spread and that go to his lungs and various other place
S0517	mm
S0518	other tumours
S0517	see and that and that's immediately make me think oh god they're gonna say lung cancer
S0518	mm
S0517	cos she's be cough all summer but
S0518	mm
S0517	and part of me still think oh let's hope they you know it hasn't spread there as well cos the
S0518	mm
S0517	the more it spread the quicker it be i suppose isn't it
S0518	mm thing be if it's get into your lymphatic system isn't it or
S0517	yeah mm
S0518	and it just go spread round
S0517	but but you know the the the awful thing be as well that i've know and cos be at college with so and they get together similar time and i get together so we've know them
S0518	mm
S0517	twenty odd years now and erm her brother who i think be just a few years younger than her erm you know when we before children you know this before we have kid and everything i remember see them and meet her brother and his girlfriend and they be lovely and they get marry and his wife her brother's wife die of breast cancer when she be only thirty seven
S0518	oh god
S0517	and she be diagnose when she be expect their second child so they couldn't even start the treatment until you know
S0518	mm
S0517	and she i think the baby be two when she die and i just think to myself that poor man they're not relate you know no blood relations whatsoever so he will've lose his wife
S0518	mm
S0517	and now quite probably his sister
S0518	mm
S0517	and i just think you know by the in your in your mid forties that's just awful isn't it
S0518	it be
S0517	awful
S0518	it be
S0517	anyway let's let's not talk about depress things anymore i know that
S0518	it's terrible no okay
S0517	that's all we talk about on a completely frivolous note be you do that hockey bonfire this saturday have you hear
S0518	no
S0517	you're not
S0518	because we might you know we might've do but erm we be go to my best friend from university they live in and when we be at college they they always use to have a bonfire party at their house and erm when they we leave and they get marry they always use to every year every year and then they haven't do it for a bite and then this year they've decide
S0517	oh they've decide to
S0518	let's
S0517	yeah
S0518	invent it invent it
S0517	reignite it whatever
S0518	yes yeah
S0517	yes yeah
S0518	erm so er we're go
S0517	oh okay
S0518	to that yeah
S0517	cos i have the email as you know we get hundreds of email from hockey day then i just say to today
S0518	mm
S0517	excuse me i say oh perhaps we should go we never support the hockey club things
S0518	mm
S0517	and it look quite a reasonable price way
S0518	yeah
S0517	cheaper than the rugby club actually
S0518	yeah
S0517	but he say be there anybody else go that we know
S0518	well we've do the rugby club one before
S0517	yeah we have
S0518	erm which the boys like because it have load of funfair rid and stuff
S0517	i i wouldn't yeah i wouldn't rush back to it though
S0518	no not
S0517	i think it be really overprice for what it be to be honest
S0518	yeah i mean i dunno what think actually i think quite like it because it have a funfair rid and stuff like that
S0517	mm
S0518	and he like go on all of that and you didn't have the mess of the bonfire in your own garden
S0517	yes
S0517	yeah
S0518	but erm
S0517	it be just a suggestion that i put to today and he say well be there cos i mean we're at the stage now the the boys probably probably won't even want to come with us
S0518	mm
S0517	you know
S0518	mm
S0517	and won't unless he's get some friends go but we'll see i just felt we never support the hockey club in anything you know we always do do

S0518	erm
S0517	we haven't reply yet we be one of the name in blue
S0518	well we be but last night i head because or you know we just have other things to think about really
S0517	well yes yeah
S0518	and erm just not know last week there be so many things that i want to do we couldn't plan anything
S0517	no
S0518	couldn't plan anything
S0517	just wait for the phone
S0518	well yeah because i didn't know you know one i've get a friend that be act in a play at that i'd say i'd go and support her but then i'd get a rehearsal tuesday night i'd get a rehearsal thursday night myself which only and then the boys have get football practice on wednesday which only leave friday but we want to go and see peter pan because our friend be play peter pan and we want to go and see that at the then have get a gothic read that he want me to come to
S0517	oh gosh
S0518	erm say oh i'm gonna do a jewellery party do you want to come all all on the same night and all on the same week and everything and i just have to say no to everybody really and we do go to see peter pan in the end and erm
S0517	at the
S0518	yeah
S0517	be it good
S0518	it be okay it be
S0518	it be very good because technically it it be for the and it be musical theatre company do it
S0517	oh so it be amateur dramatics
S0518	yeah
S0517	yeah
S0518	yeah
S0517	yeah
S0518	and but they be fly
S0517	oh
S0518	and so he'd all fly lessons so he be peter pan
S0518	so there's erm so peter wendy michael john all them the four of them all fly on the stage well i know what the wing be like so as they be go you know second star and beyond like this and then fly off
S0518	i just get visions of them all crash into the wing like oh you know like this
S0517	i know
S0518	they didn't look like that from the stage it look beautiful
S0517	oh really
S0518	and it be all twinkly and sparkly and load of dry ice and you know they be up in the air sing as well and i just think i've see them on dance on ice fly and
S0517	wow
S0518	the grow up rugby players be vomit it's so scary and make you feel all
S0517	yeah
S0518	disorientate and they be do it and sing and the little boy that play michael be have a beautiful voice he be really good erm
S0517	oh wow
S0518	but as a story it felt more pantomimey
S0517	oh it wasn't
S0518	so
S0517	it wasn't a wasn't suppose to be a pantomime
S0518	no no no it be the musical
S0517	oh
S0518	so peter pan
S0517	when you say it i assume it be a pantomime actually
S0518	the musical no
S0517	oh okay
S0518	peter pan the musical and erm
S0517	cos i be gonna say that be early to have your pantomime already
S0518	yeah
S0517	but it
S0518	no
S0517	that explain it
S0518	but it felt a bite more like that because the crocodile they have that dog don't they nanny who's like a big dog and that be obviously somebody in a costume crawl around and the crocodile be people inside a sort of fabricky costume and when captain hook erm come on some people just boo anyway which make it a bite pantomimey
S0518	and it be like come on do do we believe in fairies clap if you do which again it's a bite more
S0517	a bite more pantomime yeah
S0518	pantomimey so i prefer a musical a bite more like miss saigon or les mis or something like that that's
S0517	yes yeah be you be you go to see les mis at school
S0518	well we should do yes
S0517	oh i've book my ticket to go with my sister actually on the thursday i think

S0518	mm
S0517	so i'll go and erm they're go on the saturday though erm he be in something at the village like in but i didn't go and watch it i don't know what it be like put picture on facebook of erm
S0518	there be something i saw in the paper something no i know what it be it be it be that strictly come dance on ice x factor
S0517	oh yes yeah
S0518	wasn't it yeah
S0517	but he wasn't in that
S0518	oh
S0517	there be two i didn't realise
S0518	two halve wasn't it
S0517	there be two play that that be separate and he be in the first one call marble arch or something
S0518	i don't know
S0517	and then there be another one afterwards because be you know what he's like be they be go to watch in the first one and be wonder whether he'd get away with leave at the interval
S0518	mm leave

S0518	well i remember now because i saw my friend have put it on facebook

S0518	yeah
S0517	that one's do and it's just the school show but i should go and see him see the school one
S0518	mm
S0517	cos i think les mis'll be good
S0518	yeah and the school version be good as well so i think it will be
S0517	mm
S0518	's
S0517	so i'm down with to see that
S0518	direct it so yeah we must go and see that erm
S0517	and then i'm go to a barn dance on week on friday i can't remember the last time i go to a barn dance

S0517	well yes i i mean and you know they be always good fun aren't they
S0518	do go with you
S0517	no
S0517	of course not
S0518	i couldn't imagine
S0517	oh gosh do you know there's a it's a our friend in the village it's her 's the physio that i take to actually so but it's her son who be at school with but he's now go to school and he's raise fund for something

S0517	i forget what but he's raise fund and he's get to raise the fund for this trip himself so one of things he's do be organise a barn dance so and and and er and be all go because you know the s always support them when they're fundraise and i think you know it'll be fun could i drum up any interest from my family no be just an outright no way can't think of anything worse to be fair doesn't wanna go but have make him
S0518	yeah he have to
S0517	he have to just look at me as if i be derange
S0517	and say mum i'm go you want me to go to a barn dance you know he didn't even know what a barn dance be but i think just the fact it have dance in the title

S0518	oh right
S0517	county
S0518	yes
S0517	thing

S0518	a good night's sleep
S0517	a bowl of pasta and a good night's sleep so i'm go by myself but another friend of ours she say she felt she should go and support erm and none of her family want to go so i say well you can come with me
S0518	there you go
S0517	but i say to you know be it one of those do we need partner no no no there's lot of mums go on their own which just go to show none of the
S0518	yeah
S0517	men really be interest
S0518	i think er barn dance
S0517	they don't think it'll be fun
S0518	they normally say right come on we need eight people for the next dance in you know in group of eight
S0517	yeah
S0518	or whatever and you just ask just someone don't you
S0517	you just get on and yeah yeah
S0518	you know
S0517	so i've get a check shirt so i'll be sort
S0518	you'll be fine
S0517	so that's a week on friday
S0518	you'll be fine
S0517	and then the that night actually the saturday we've be invite to a birthday party in from somebody at the tennis club so we've get a busy weekend that one
S0518	which i don't know which weekend we're talk about now
S0517	that be the thirteenth and fourteenth of
S0518	of november
S0517	november
S0518	and be alright when you say you couldn't come for the christmas party
S0517	oh yes she be cos i do it by text which be a bite naughty
S0517	well actually i texted her immediately after she have phone me cos she phone me up when she be phone round just to say and i say oh let me get back to you cos that date sound really familiar and er so i go back to her that night say i'm ever so sorry and do you know what in actual fact the excuse i give be like in all likelihood be gonna come true
S0518	well when you
S0518	when you say it to me
S0517	what what be the date of the what's the date of that be it the
S0518	the er
S0517	twelfth eleventh be it that weekend
S0518	twelfth yeah the twelfth i think it be
S0517	you see the weekend before be actually 's mother's birthday the sixth
S0518	mm
S0517	which be a sunday and which would've be perfect but we've say yes i don't know if i tell you to an adoption party you know that the chap in work that adopt two little girls this year
S0518	right no you didn't tell me no you tell me about that but
S0517	yeah well he's he's the adoption i think it should be official i think it today or one day this week they're go to it's all become official so they've invite us to an adoption party
S0518	oh
S0517	on the sixth of december which we say yes to cos i say to that we should definitely go to that they've have such a you know a tough time get there

S0518	if he if it's the christmas party sometimes he he doesn't
S0517	he try to not to

S0517	mm
S0518	and they know and and be say well we can't go to number six because they don't like it but then in it's like it be
S0517	and and that's how it be here when the boys be small
S0518	yeah you know don't you
S0517	we'd cos you'd all be to the toddler group and they'd all start school together and you'd go around to the house of the of their friends
S0518	mm
S0517	basically or you know
S0518	exactly yeah
S0517	that they be in and that and you know and the the mums would all talk beforehand and they'd say oh you in but no but and that's fine because you have to be with them because they be small they be six seven eight years of age but now
S0518	mm mm
S0517	to go off on your own to just knock on people's door i say to i'm not buy you a halloween outfit and what be you gonna wear say oh i just wear black and put a mask on i think well so you're make no effort to dress up
S0518	just to get sweets
S0517	you just say i'll buy you sweets alright i will buy you sweets and it just the whole thing just annoy because it's just he should've outgrow it

S0517	yes yeah
S0518	that know we be come basically and didn't erm
S0517	and that and that be my issue with want to go
S0518	say i'm too old 's too old yeah
S0517	to go onto the to the new waitrose estate and all around there
S0518	mm
S0517	but it be two years ago that want to go last year as i say we're away but two years ago when he would've be twelve just turn twelve and he ask and just look at him and say you be far too old to don't be ridiculous you know it's just so
S0517	no well that's your friend who's also twelve who just wouldn't entertain the idea of go out trick or treat
S0518	yeah
S0517	cos it's for little kid
S0518	well when 's there do you mind if i stay in the house he say oh oh cos they have load of trick or treaters be cook erm my dad be there obviously he couldn't get up and down my mum be there so say i'll stay in the house and i'll give treat out to the people that come here be that alright so say yes my mum say you're never too old to trick or treat she say my father she say every year dress up as a toy soldier with a monocle

S0517	at school i think it's be it about eight nine weeks i can't remember but also cos i know be erm in year seven do his football train on a monday night
S0518	mm
S0517	and it's always be straight from school half past three till five o'clock and they have a letter say that the time be change quarter past four till six on a monday and say oh yeah that's because there's a referee course on and we've get to be the
S0518	oh right
S0517	the children they put they they learn on
S0518	oh right oh right
S0517	so i say to oh you'll be do 's erm

S0518	what time be it now oh twenty
S0517	half past three so yeah another
S0518	past three yeah yeah

S0518	i must er yeah i say to him have anything be say and he say no i ask mr and then he say i ask him and he say it's still go ahead but i just be struggle to get the right amount of number and i'll let you know the date when it's start
S0517	because i say to what be you gonna do for forty five minutes after school now i say no point come home cos as soon as you walk through the door we'd have to turn round and go back and he say oh there's a couple of others do it in his year i say be there he say yeah because they announce it in pe i say a long time ago or recently no recently so they're obviously still try to get up get number and a couple of others in his year but
S0518	yeah because we have parents' even the other week and we be talk to mr and he be say erm he say 's one of my one of the my most favourite boys i've ever teach and he say if i can't get him an a for pe he say i might retire
S0518	but so and then he be talk about you know because they have to pick their four best
S0517	oh sport
S0518	sport to
S0517	yes
S0518	that they've get the highest mark on and then he be but then he be say and on top of that then obviously now unless he be talk about cos do badminton after school on a tuesday and he say i think he say i want to train to be a badminton referee and erm
S0517	oh
S0518	he say because that's an area that not many people go into and it's you can get really good erm mark on that so i'm wonder whether he's say to you can't at the moment it's too much to do football referee and badminton
S0517	oh be there a course come up for the badminton referee then
S0518	and well er mr 's well he say i get the feel that it be basically gonna be him coach him
S0517	well he that be his sport wasn't it
S0518	be
S0517	mr
S0518	be it badminton
S0517	when he be
S0518	ah
S0517	younger that be his sport that he play to a very good level
S0518	right
S0517	cos he's try to get in er and and and i say to him but he's a tennis player he shouldn't play badminton and he say i know that he say i be a badminton player and i be not allow to play tennis
S0518	oh right
S0517	erm i say well stop stop encourage him then
S0518	just stop it stop it
S0517	yeah but he but he be erm but that's a bite unfair though isn't it i mean want to do the course because he want to earn money from it
S0518	yeah
S0517	he want to go on a saturday morning and referee the little ones which i assume be why be do it or be that
S0518	well
S0517	be it part of his gcse
S0518	it be a mixture of things because he come home and say mr have ask and me whether erm he think that we would be suitable for this and whether we would like to do it and i want to do it and it's this referee course because obviously you can referee and get money
S0517	mm
S0518	but also it's all extra go towards your gcse and if as well if you see erm like the last few football match that they play at school there's be a ginger haired boy referee it
S0517	oh yes
S0518	it's one of 's friends
S0517	i be gonna say he look like he's in school
S0518	yeah he's a
S0517	mm
S0518	he's a year eleven and i say to how come be reffing it and he say oh it's to get him more point for his gcse so i'm like well why aren't you and he say because i've get more point elsewhere
S0517	right
S0518	so he's he's he
S0517	right see but want to do it so he can earn money from it like do
S0518	yeah well so some people be
S0517	mm
S0518	do it to erm help their gcses and some people be do it for other reason but i say to like i say when we have the last conversation about it erm what have happen have mr say anything more and he say oh i'll ask him then he say well just what i tell you he's get try to it's not start yet cos he hasn't get enough people
S0517	i think it be mr that be organise it
S0518	oh well maybe i'm say the wrong name then maybe i'm say the wrong name
S0517	because i know i think i start with mr and he refer me to mr and i i'm pretty sure it be mr that send me the email link
S0518	i'll have to check
S0517	and it be a hassle you have to you have to you have to register with the fa and get a
S0518	oh right
S0517	yeah they call it an fan number
S0518	right
S0517	i don't know whether that stand for fa number so you have to register set yourself up as a user
S0518	mm
S0517	and then go on and then you could pay and it say at the
S0518	i'll find out because as i say
S0517	mm
S0518	at parents' even he be on about erm he's get this many and it's like there be swim life save skills rugby cricket football
S0517	all sort yeah
S0518	be one of the ones that do the cross country
S0517	yes
S0518	so athletics be one of them he's quite good at that erm there's all the sport circuit train
S0518	and then one of and badminton now mr say because he's a good all round sportsman he you know his badminton be fine but he say not that many people do badminton umpire and he say i think you can get more mark do that
S0517	that's really weird because he's tell er for a level you only have to do two sport
S0518	mm
S0517	so obviously he's get tennis
S0518	mm
S0517	and potentially he's get hockey although he doesn't play that to a to a particularly good level but i say you know he's do his in the half term he say he's er do his next level of coach course for tennis you know
S0518	right yeah yeah
S0517	cost us three hundred quid it's a good qualification and so he say to mr or mr whichever er well can i do tennis coach as my second one and he say you don't really get so er so many point for that but what you would be good be if you be a tennis umpire i say but there's no skill involve in that you've just gotta
S0518	mm
S0517	call out the score
S0518	mm
S0517	and he say i know but they say that you can get more point if you're just a tennis umpire i say well at
S0518	so that's after badminton
S0517	yes which be why i think that's weird cos again you're just
S0518	yeah yeah
S0517	watch a game and
S0518	mm
S0517	call out the the score whereas coach i would've think and i must be wrong but you'd've think there'd be way more skill involve in that wouldn't you because you've get to watch what they're do analyse it tell them how to improve
S0518	there's more skill you would mm
S0517	but if you're you've just basically gotta say well in or out that make the score that
S0518	mm
S0517	er
S0518	well i be just say
S0518	it's you've get to have a loud voice a clear voice you've get to be decisive you've get to make the right call obviously the score the right way round
S0517	mm
S0518	erm serve and things like that you know if they're out or whatever you have to just be and he say i think it'd be good for for his erm confidence because you have you have to control the game in a way erm and and he just say although his yeah his badminton be be good it's not outstanding it you know it's
S0517	yeah yeah yeah
S0518	middle
S0517	mm
S0518	it be solid whereas he say i think umpire
S0517	you could do it so there must be something and they'll maybe there's just not many people that do it but it be weird that he say the same to
S0518	yeah mm mm
S0517	with tennis
S0518	that be weird
S0517	cos you're it's not something you'd think would count towards a gcse or an a level really be it but anyway
S0518	no but there we go i'll ask him then about so he might just say oh yeah i be tell because of do twelve twelve exams and i'm do this and i'm do badminton umpire that
S0517	and he's get his duke of edinburgh hasn't he he's do
S0518	yeah
S0517	yeah
S0518	this year it's too much to take on or
S0517	maybe
S0518	might've decide himself it's too much to take on i don't know
S0517	oh
S0518	i don't know because with city he train twice a week and have a match so
S0517	he train twice a week
S0518	yeah
S0517	oh do he
S0518	they train saturdays and wednesdays
S0517	oh i didn't realise that
S0518	mm

S0517	mm
S0518	and so he's do badminton tuesdays football wednesdays football saturdays work every other saturday and then play match on sundays and this half term he have nine piece of homework well you've be through it so you know what it's like but
S0517	yeah
S0518	you know it's erm
S0517	it's too much sometimes i whereas come home and he say well i have get homework but all the teachers say the same apparently the headmaster say something different but all the teachers say we don't think you should have homework during half term so we're go to set it because we have to but you've get until the friday

S0518	she's hook
S0517	but yeah but no she be fine
S0517	she be fine we just didn't do much but

S0517	oh no
S0518	don't like her she's
S0517	who be this through the doctor's surgery
S0518	yeah i don't i i i she make me feel really guilty for be there
S0517	oh do she
S0518	yeah as if i be far too she what she actually say to me
S0518	er no i'm alright at the moment thank you
S0517	okay
S0518	you have one while you're listen
S0517	no go on you're just tempt me
S0518	she she actually say to me and say i think it might've be a bite of a clumsy compliment she say do you know she say you be my best outcome so i say sorry she say if i could get most of my clients to be anywhere near how you be today by the time they've finish with me she say i'd be so happy
S0517	and that be your first session
S0518	yeah so i say do you not think this be the right thing for me then
S0517	i be gonna say that sort of suggest you don't need whatever therapy she be offer
S0518	i say no i'm not do you think i i but i think what it be it's because like i say i've i didn't want to be sign off sick i felt you know ashamed embarrass duh duh duh duh all of these things i haven't spend the six weeks wallow in it i've be and see people and have coffee and lunch and stuff and but i've do load of exercise but i've also work quite hard at sort my own brain out and make myself
S0517	mm yeah
S0518	better and try to put things in order and understand things and think i tell you about a friend on the train who
S0517	yes yes you do yeah
S0518	some stuff to look at and everything and then i when erm the doctor put you in touch with these counsel people and they're well be and it's not and they contact you and they do this stuff over the phone to start off with to decide whether the theme work with it
S0517	yes yeah
S0518	and whether it's the right thing and they make it quite clear we're not counsellors it's this be cognitive behaviour therapy
S0517	be she the lady you'd have the phone interview with
S0518	no
S0517	oh it be somebody else again
S0518	yeah somebody more superior so
S0517	what she be
S0518	yes
S0517	the the the face to face one
S0518	she she's the actual
S0517	okay
S0518	doer if you like the other people work in an office
S0517	be just screeners
S0518	yeah and they do the initial question and talk you through some stuff and then make an assessment on you and decide what's the most beneficial so she say to me
S0517	right
S0518	you be speak to my colleague i be like yes and then she say erm she's put you through to me at a level three this be somebody that have get quite complicate issue and
S0518	need a more in depth approach on a one to one basis rather than just group workshops so i be like oh mm
S0517	right
S0518	okay
S0517	in depth issue mm
S0518	i think what it be be they couldn't pull apart whether it be real issue or health issue or relationship issue so health issue they can't deal with unless it's mentally affect your mental health so if it's just side effect
S0517	but also one of the side effect be panic attack and and that's mental isn't it so
S0518	yeah and on the four section of question two of them i i you know be not a worry but erm anxiety and low moods i score highly on because obviously when i be ask the question i be have daily panic attack how often do you feel anxious or panicky
S0517	every day
S0518	every day so that give you a high score
S0517	mm
S0518	you know how often do you feel
S0517	but you didn't though do you
S0518	what
S0517	you didn't you haven't always felt anxious or
S0518	no but they ask you it's base on the last two weeks
S0517	it's last
S0518	so every time
S0517	right but that i mean you've be on the drug for the last two weeks
S0518	yeah so
S0517	mm
S0518	when they first ask me the set of question they say only answer how you felt in the last two weeks don't think back to the past don't think how you've be previously or whatever how have you felt
S0517	mm
S0518	during the last two weeks and then i think i tell you i be not a high risk person because i hadn't entertain take my own life or self harm or anything that be not a problem and then there's a whole series of question like how much do this affect you erm carry out your social life so be you able to go out and meet people doesn't affect me at all yes i go out and meet people i actually feel better for meet people
S0517	mm
S0518	so all of those question i score really low on so they're not an issue but obviously anxiety and low moods because the question that come up in low moods be during the course of last fortnight and it it's sort of a choice between erm never it range between never
S0517	occasionally frequently or
S0518	yeah those aren't quite the word but basically every day
S0517	yeah yeah
S0518	er all the time how often do you feel erm as a person er that you be let your or others down so from every day because that's how you know just be off work i'm let people down you know
S0517	yeah yeah
S0518	every day so that's why i score highly in those two areas
S0517	oh
S0518	probably not reflective of how i be all the time
S0517	normally yes yeah
S0518	but that's how they have to do it and so i think because there be all these issue the girl that make the assessment put me through to level three then i go to meet this woman she's call and then erm she's
S0517	be that at the surgery or
S0518	yes but it's part of the well be team
S0517	right
S0518	and they do make it clear to me on the phone this be cognitive behaviour therapy so it's not counsel you don't need counsel counsel be all dredge up the past what's go wrong in your life to you know where you abuse as a child whatever you know be your parent alcoholics
S0517	you want a bite of counsel though didn't you
S0518	yeah but i think you've give me that
S0517	hardly i'm not a qualify counsellor at all by any stretch
S0518	i i know we all we all have things that make us what we be today there's nature and there's nurture so there's the way we be naturally and there's stuff that happen to us and i know that and i've tell you what my stuff be you know bring up a catholic
S0518	oh 's ask me where i be
S0518	bring up a catholic erm
S0517	do you want to answer him
S0518	shall i just text him back and just say
S0517	yeah just tell him cos he'll've just text back and say shouldn't you be at a referee course
S0518	yeah so just have they're really bother if i'm not there

S0517	mm

S0518	you know business and all this sort of thing so i think it would be really useful for that we didn't talk about that at all
S0517	oh
S0518	and she just sort of say to me i think you've get a really from the sound of it you've get a really close network of friends people that care about you a lot people that've be worry about you a lot can i tell you that most people that come through my doors do not have one single person to talk to they could not speak to anybody face to face they would not go out they would not socialise they would not go and see friends
S0517	so she be pretty much say you didn't need to be there you didn't
S0518	well i say that to her be you say that i'm not suit to this and that actually
S0517	mm
S0518	cos i say the last thing i want to do be waste your time but i say er obviously i've do a lot of research i've look into a lot of stuff myself and i've do a lot to help myself i say i'm not somebody for just sit around in a corner and not

S0518	no and she say erm i say cos i get the vibe from you that you think i'm far too sort and able to you know i've get lot of stuff that's go for me
S0517	yeah yeah
S0518	i say i know you can't help me with erm relationship problems and i know you can't help me with medical problems
S0517	mm mm
S0518	and she say mm she say but it's
S0518	oh no
S0517	oh no how do do
S0517	he get what
S0517	but you don't know if that's for you or not
S0518	but you're
S0517	because it say hi
S0517	what do the grade go fail instructor two instructor one pro
S0517	yeah
S0518	can you email back and say
S0517	can you hit reply who's it from
S0517	well no why would he know
S0517	no i'd go no go back to the guy
S0517	okay go
S0517	oh gosh that's not good be it
S0518	oh no that's awful
S0517	that's that's very unprofessional
S0518	and it make you think have get the right mark or have they get someone else's
S0517	yeah goodness i hope he get oh anyway
S0518	demand a recount
S0517	yeah that's weird isn't well the way they do it just to you know they be i say there be those three test
S0518	mm mm
S0517	the write the the skills and the coach they didn't then mark each one and take an average you get the bottom one
S0518	oh
S0517	that's that cos that's what he come back and say on the first day so you know if you're cos there be one chap on the course who's who's a good instructor he he's really good with the little kid and everything very good but his actual his tennis skills be fantastic you know 's a better tennis player erm cos i say oh that's a shame cos may be mark lower he say well that's what they've say they do so so for instance with with his you know
S0518	mm
S0517	the way he be with his dyslexia his write one could've be low cos i think his coach and his and his er skills would've be fine but you don't know about that write one
S0518	yeah yeah
S0517	which be an hour's test so he say no they just take the bottom one
S0518	well i think that's a bite unfair
S0517	i do too but anyway that's that's how it be do so
S0518	i think that's a little bite unfair
S0517	so be she gonna have you have you back or not
S0518	well yeah yeah because i think then she felt that she maybe have be er a bite out of order because you know i be quite upset as well during it and she say to me she say i don't really understand why you have low self esteem issue and erm she say er seem to me that you know you've get great friends and a great support network and i i i say to her try to explain to her that i don't actually believe what people say and erm so i say my manager at work will say to me you've do a great job so i'm gonna put you into this erm quality position and i say and i'll just think oh it there's some ulterior motive and actually i don't trust her and that and i say that's because of a i know what it's from i say a major life thing that happen to me which i tell about where the person that i trust the most have be lie to me for years and years and years so now i just always have my guard up and she say but you seem a really open love erm er you know talkative person that erm
S0517	yeah yeah
S0518	not as if you have a guard up and i say yeah but i say it's like so you know right i say i've do the thing and i say where and pick up this pencil and i say my natural lean to write with my right hand that's what i do naturally but if i need to i can make myself write with my leave hand so i say
S0518	oh sorry
S0517	who be it be that a phone call
S0518	on it's three texts i wonder if they've be queue up to come in
S0517	oh probably cos you're in now don't forget
S0518	that the the other two don't matter i don't realise but the referee course be on tonight till six oh the 's obviously send them they're all come through in the wrong order because this all make sense now
S0517	oh that's because of where you be
S0518	yeah i don't need to respond to them that's fine
S0517	oh fine yeah it's yeah they do they come this be what happen to me all the time
S0518	so yeah
S0517	come through randomly you don't know when you've send me a
S0518	he obviously send obviously send that one earlier
S0517	then i think that like that time do you remember i say oh our texts have
S0518	yeah
S0517	pass
S0518	yes
S0517	and you say no i send mine five hours ago
S0518	yeah
S0517	yeah it's
S0518	or i text you at midnight which i hadn't
S0517	hadn't yeah it's just
S0518	of course of course
S0517	it's just it's where you be i'm afraid
S0518	yeah of course but so i actually say to her you know i naturally my instinct and my lean be to to trust people i want to do that and i be a very open i love people i love people and i say but all the time in the back of my mind there's this little guard that when someone give me a compliment or say i've do a good job i don't trust that so i say when my friends say we're worry about you and we want you to be feel better and i'm not think of you in this at all but like and erm i think that they have an ulterior motive because they want me to feel better because actually they're needy and they don't like it when i'm poorly because they're like woah we don't like you like this
S0517	mm
S0518	cos who's gonna look after us
S0517	yeah yeah
S0518	so she and i say about follow her into the shop she say well someone follow you to the shop sound like somebody who really care i say let me just put it into perspective i probably wasn't help myself i say i've get a friend call and i say
S0518	when i be poorly one weekend i say i can't do this because i'm not very well duh duh duh and she say sorry to hear about that i'm in do you need any shop and i say i'm absolutely fine but thank you for offer brilliant you know where i be shout up have a good rest and i say that be somebody be supportive can i help i say no i'm fine i understand that but ask me if you need i say that be a supportive friend i'm not very well i can't duh duh duh duh shall i drive round and see you no i'm fine i'm outside your door be you sure you don't want to see no i'm fine go away don't want to freak you out but i'm run up and down outside your house cos i need to be close to you cos i'm worry about you
S0517	yeah that's not normal
S0518	like shall i call you shall i call you shall i call you i'm park in a lay by shall i call you god alright call me then oh now i've make you cry wish i hadn't call you so i and then
S0517	yeah that's not that's not normal
S0518	so then she say i can't pick your friends for you
S0517	oh
S0518	i say i'm not ask you to i'm try to tell you why i feel sometimes when my friends be be supportive i'm doubtful what their actual motives be because i say i don't feel that for stalk me be a supportive motive i feel it be a needy person go oh god
S0517	i want you to be alright yeah i need you
S0518	i want you better because i need you for me so she say well i'm sorry she say if you want your friends to be a certain way she say i think that's quite prescriptive of you and she say i say no i don't i'm not say that
S0517	oh god she sound like a bite of a
S0518	so
S0517	yeah
S0518	i didn't like her i didn't like her at all
S0517	so have you get another appointment
S0518	so at the end of it she say everything that we do be evidence base and she say i cannot go to my superior and say i'm just help her with a bite of this and bite of that so she say i need to go with a proper plan so she say i need to know that there's definitely an area that we can work on so she say to my mind she say i think erm there be some self esteem issue she say not true self esteem issue but more your perception of how you think other people perceive you so she she give it a name and i've forget what it be
S0517	right
S0518	so she say it's expectations the expectations that people put on you and your perception of what that should be and she say and you understand that just because you've get all this catholic guilt and stuff on you and other people have lie to you in the past not everybody be go to continue to do that so erm
S0518	we need to look at that and you just be able to say yeah actually some things i'm not great at but some things i be really great at and just understand that you be and she say and then i can't anxiety that erm but she say i'm i'm struggle on that because she say i think you have be knock off your feet she say you've be put have these operations you've be put on this drug you have to eat a bad diet that make you poorly you didn't take any time off work you've get lot of family pressure on you and she say i think a lot of the anxiety be to do with the drug that you've be on and she say i want to monitor you now you're on the reduce level of drug just to see if that anxiety get better which you know panic attack i think have get be better
S0517	yes yeah yes
S0518	so she's give me some homework to do and she's book another appointment for a fortnight so she say i want you to go away read these things answer these question and see whether you think there be some mileage in this for you but when i go back i'm gonna say to her what about help with the actual because whatever drug i'm on it's only gonna help me to a certain extent so be there no cognitive therapy behaviour that's gonna help me with the food intolerances
S0517	well yes and like you say the trigger that make you panic
S0518	yeah
S0517	because somebody say do you want a biscuit with your tea
S0518	yeah it's yeah
S0517	it it yeah yeah
S0518	and i don't panic
S0517	no i know but they that sort of uncomfortable feel if it's somebody you don't know that you've then get to go in to start tell them your
S0518	but
S0517	all your food issue to you know it
S0518	yeah and say like the christmas party with and that she's fall out the trouble we have last year to ring up and see what the options be and all of that
S0517	yes yeah it become a bite of a
S0518	say it's not gonna it's not gonna cure that
S0517	no but just ways to
S0518	but
S0517	that's like that like you say that be suppose to be the point of the therapy wasn't it to give you
S0518	well i think to look at the things that
S0517	and you could go back and say to her well i have think all this through i've take on board what you say and actually this be the area i would like to work on
S0518	yeah that's what
S0517	and see what she say
S0518	yeah that's what
S0517	you know
S0518	and if she say
S0517	take this to your superior and
S0518	and if she say no i'll say well thank i don't think it's for me i honestly think i could do better myself do better myself and then
S0517	well like you say if you've be research it on the internet and how you're suppose to sort of i don't know anything about it but you probably could do better you
S0518	er they if you look it up it'll tell you stuff so it's quite interest
S0517	mm
S0518	and it's it's stuff that's happen all go to shape the person that we be we can't do anything about that because that's happen but it's when we come up against something that potentially can trigger something off that you pick the right attitude to deal with it
S0517	yes yeah yeah
S0518	so certain things i do anyway and that's why i be go to work because i have the attitude where i don't take my problems to work i leave them on the doorstep and then i go in and put this and do a professional job
S0517	mm
S0518	and i can do that quite easily and i probably employ quite a few act skills in in
S0517	yes yeah yeah
S0518	do that so i can make those choices but and i think you say to me i think it's just women like say you've get a busy mind everything all go across in your once you need separate out
S0517	oh yeah but there's always so much go on isn't there
S0518	yeah but i think sometimes a erm a logical decision my logical mind'll tell me this but my emotional thing will just get in the way of it
S0517	mm
S0518	to be honest
S0517	mm
S0518	but on friday
S0517	mm
S0518	be really upset on friday and i have a whole diatribe
S0517	oh do you see him
S0518	yeah cos he be at the theatre with his family when we be there
S0517	oh gosh we'll have to have that for another time cos i'm gonna have to take to the tennis club
S0518	mm oh i'm so sorry do the er
S0517	no no no no that's fine so shall i shall i
S0518	yeah yeah
S0517	shall i stop this anyway and we'll erm
S0518	the long and short of that
