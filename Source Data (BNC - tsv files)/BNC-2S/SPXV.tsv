S0441	yeah
S0439	it be good stuff though
S0441	two teaspoons
S0439	yeah two maybe yeah two
S0441	we'll do another half
S0439	two and a half why not

S0439	mm do you know one of these light be break
S0441	be it
S0439	yeah crack

S0439	i'm pretty sure we would've notice if we
S0441	we wouldn't have do that well how would you do that
S0439	yeah how would you crack a light up there how do anybody how do they crack the light originally up there
S0441	play football in the house or something
S0439	no mm
S0441	uh
S0439	you alright there
S0441	minor issue with the er fruit pour
S0439	ah fruit
S0441	that's that be from it be actually not so bad it be like two ninety nine
S0439	for a bag of freeze fruit
S0441	mm
S0439	yeah cos like i i i love fruit but it's so expensive
S0441	i know it be i think it's much more sensible to get it freeze
S0439	yeah like
S0441	i suppose i'm only only if you're go to eat it in something not sort of fresh
S0439	yeah
S0441	cos that would be weird but
S0439	like three pound for a punnet of blueberries just like no
S0441	ridiculous whereas in morrisons i think i don't know whether they do it in this morrisons but they have in at the morrisons they have two punnets like punnets like this big
S0439	yeah
S0441	this deep for two quid of like freeze raspberries and stuff
S0439	it's not bad be it
S0441	that's after i buy the stuff but
S0439	i buy the strawberries from morrisons because they be one pound forty nine and i just didn't think that be too horrendous
S0441	fresh fruit be ridiculous
S0439	but yeah it's like four pound for a punnet of raspberries and a punnet not each but together you know you can easily spend ten quid on fruit which be really nice and everything but you know it's a bite excessive
S0441	bite excessive and grapes be so expensive as well grapes be ridiculous
S0439	mm i don't even like get you can get a bag of apples for ninety nine p say yeah but apples be bore
S0441	i hate eat apples but i i quite like them so i'll eat them otherwise i don't really eat fruit at all
S0439	yeah i quite like pears as well but i'm go through a banana phase at the moment i use to hate bananas
S0441	me too i'm go through a banana phase as well
S0439	i kind of like bananas be one of those fruit that i either really really like them
S0441	me too
S0439	or i loathe them
S0441	i think quite a few people have that reaction to them
S0439	i wonder why
S0441	oh yeah like them
S0439	mum's like that even the smell make mum feel a bite queasy
S0441	what but sometimes not
S0439	yeah
S0441	i can be like that especially if they're overripe even if i'm in a banana phase and they're overripe i can't
S0439	no yeah same
S0441	it make me feel sick they have to be like perfect
S0439	mm yeah i don't like them green but i don't like them yellow i like them in between
S0441	yeah but brown no
S0439	no god no
S0441	no i have brown i have load of brown ones and i'm like oh god what be i go to do with this so i freeze them and they're actually fine
S0439	yeah like a freeze bananas be fine especially if you like blend them and do stuff with them or put them in like your breakfast thing but i wouldn't eat them just on their own
S0441	no but i suppose that's fine cos i i hate waste stuff so i suppose that's quite a good thing to do if you've get like load of brown bananas leave over or make a banana cake
S0439	yeah
S0441	i like a banana cake
S0439	me too actually banana cake be yummy i don't do any bake i make a really really good victoria sponge in the week when i be at home but
