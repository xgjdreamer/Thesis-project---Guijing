S0432	yeah
S0503	erm but i think at least she's notice sort of thing
S0432	yeah yeah that's true at least it might mean that she might make an effort
S0503	yeah she be like there's a baby group in on tuesday and she be like it's two pound like she say apparently it's quite a good one and then she be like the baby sensory ones be go so you get to meet them before you start the baby sensory with him there
S0432	what be all that stuff like play like feel
S0503	baby sensory
S0432	yeah
S0503	yeah i think so i think she create sort of like
S0432	yeah
S0503	environments and stuff that like stimulate
S0432	have you get to be up early yeah
S0503	well he can stay in bed until i can get ready and then he can get up
S0432	yeah yeah do that
S0503	and i'll have to get myself out of bed and it's hard to get him up when if he's asleep honestly
S0432	yeah
S0503	to be earlier than him
S0432	you've get to let mummy sleep through the night
S0503	i'm scar he won't sleep through tonight cos he's only he's gonna have to have a fee cos he's have this at half four unless he have another one at like half six and half eight so he have sort of then that's only two hours between feed
S0432	so when do he usually have them like throughout the day
S0503	he have one say he have one at like five
S0432	in the morning
S0503	yeah then like nine twelve three six and then like eight say on average
S0432	like nine and twelve three six and eight
S0503	but when he be wake up at about say two three o'clock he'd still have sometimes he'd have seven bottle other time he'd have a longer stretch between so he wouldn't have like three hour gap so
S0432	mm
S0503	he be still get sort of six to seven bottle
S0432	yeah so before he be have one between like eight and five at night
S0503	yeah no so he have his last one like originally his time be like for sleep through on the night say he go to bed at say eight he'd wake up at like sort of two ish and then it start go to three and then this past week he's start go until five
S0432	oh okay so he
S0503	but then last night he sleep through until seven so he's not have that night fee so he's not have as many feed today
S0432	oh yeah i see yeah
S0503	like but sometimes when he's sleep like if he wake up say at about three so he have one at three in the morning five then like sort of nine twelve four maybe well yeah he'd usually have sort of like oh i can't work it out cos i'm too tire
S0432	i can't even i'm sorry do i scare do you see him
S0503	no
S0432	he just go
S0503	oh he be startle
S0432	sorry be that too loud
S0503	yeah but he'd usually have sort of seven to six bottle but recently it's be six because he's go that little bite longer at night without one
S0432	yeah
S0503	because he go from seven last night today it's be seven ten and one sort of four so maybe like seven seven and that's only five bottle and that's an earlier bottle as well so unless i can try and squeeze another one in between now and sort of eight so he have sort of two hour gap between them
S0432	mm
S0503	rather than three
S0432	yeah
S0503	cos otherwise i'm not i don't know if he'll sleep through because he's have like there's seven ounces less than usual
S0432	so he's have four so far today
S0503	yeah
S0432	but by this time he would have have five or six
S0503	yeah
S0432	no five
S0503	yeah
S0432	yeah
S0503	so i'm not
S0432	so he's only get one more to fit in
S0503	yeah
S0432	technically
S0503	really but then say he start get hungry about like half six cos he hasn't seem to have be last three hours today for some reason erm so he might still want the same amount of he might think i've sleep through but i still want the same amount that i would have have
S0432	yeah mm
S0503	so the gap be get shorter sort of thing cos i give him eight ounces this morning which he like drink all of but then the ten o'clock one i do another eight but he only have six
S0503	so then it average out at seven ounces anyway so then i've just make
S0432	oh
S0503	seven ounce ones at one and four
S0432	but he have six be that what you're say
S0503	no he usually have seven
S0432	i'm slightly lose oh okay
S0503	he have seven all day apart from eight before bed but like because he'd go so long last night i give him eight this morning but then the next morning he only have six so it still average out at seven
S0432	oh okay i see yeah
S0503	so it's not because i be gonna try and give him an extra ounce in every fee so that he's not technically miss a bottle and give him
S0432	but he just wasn't drink
S0503	yeah
S0432	you know what she's do
S0503	so i may try and fit another fee in
S0432	you're just gonna wake him up at two in the morning mm
S0503	yeah that be the thing like if he wake in the night now i'm not gonna know whether like i say whether it's cos we've be at and like he's not gonna have like a bottle fee like i don't know where he's gonna sleep
S0432	yeah you don't know if it's like disruption of
S0503	and like he's gonna be in the lounge as well
S0432	routine
S0503	yeah
S0432	go to or the fact that he sleep so well last night and miss a bottle
S0503	yeah
S0432	what do you think what do you think
S0503	because like as i say i don't know what's happen with like and this morning they sleep through and she say she be like i'm so jealous she be like erm she be like i'm start to think be i do something wrong i say to be honest i don't think we've do anything differently like he have a lot of milk and they do say that when they get to certain weight they like drop a fee so it might be that he's drop the night fee
S0432	yeah so he might be alright anyway
S0503	yeah but then also i say it could just be a phase like i don't expect i still expect him to get up at like two o'clock so anything later be a bonus really
S0432	yeah
S0503	because otherwise i'd be really like gutted if he start wake up at like three again
S0432	yeah
S0503	erm
S0432	he's just get the gene and like sleep all the time don't you
S0503	but erm
S0432	just like your aunties and your grandparents
S0503	yeah then she be say like oh i've get him into such a routine and she be like i don't know if it's just routine for him wake up and i'm like it's probably the problem
S0432	what do she wake him up
S0503	no but like because like his routine in the day be like be the same every single day with nap time and food time every single day be exactly the same
S0432	oh be it
S0503	time and stuff so it's like well then his it probably be a routine for him whereas his nap time in the day if he's awake and happy i'll leave him awake when i know he start get tire i'll try and get him to sleep if he's hungry like less than three hours i don't like to give him too much but if he's really scream i'd be like well sod it you're gonna have to have it then
S0432	yeah
S0503	or if he go a little bite longer between a fee i'll let him go a bite longer
S0432	yeah
S0503	so it's not like
S0432	yeah like he's like dictate it to you
S0503	yeah like i think with
S0432	which be not a bad thing i don't think
S0503	no i mean i know eventually we'll have we'll have to start try again into some sort of routine but
S0432	oh yeah but right now i think
S0503	yeah
S0432	you seem to be do it well
S0503	i'm just sort of listen to him at the minute and
S0432	he's happy
S0503	he's like be like like like i say i don't think we've do anything differently for him to sleep through he's just start go a little bite longer cos every morning we'll wake up and will be like what time have you feed him and i'll be like i haven't yet
S0432	really
S0503	and be like really and i'm like yeah
S0432	what cos he think you would have get up in the night
S0503	yeah
S0432	would he not wake up for that though
S0503	for what his night
S0432	yeah
S0503	who
S0432	would he not even notice that you've wake up to fee him
S0503	he doesn't sometimes
S0432	oh god
S0503	most of the time he do but he use to when i use to make it all like fresh and stuff but i've stop do that now
S0432	what do you do
S0503	refill the bottle up and so we go to bed at like eleven i fill the
S0503	i fill that up with boil water have you be shout
S0432	be you try to explain too
S0503	what be you say eh oh oh
S0432	do you reckon he's a bite like i wanna sit up
S0503	he's try now
S0432	be you try
S0503	yeah i fill that up with erm cos i do eight ounces before bed but night feed i just do seven ounces
S0432	yeah
S0503	erm i fill it up with seven ounces of boil water put it in his thermal bag thing and
S0432	oh
S0503	take a formula pot out and then when it get to his night fee i just like take out the thermal bag and put the formula in it's obviously with him sleep through it's cold
S0432	mm
S0503	so i will come down and tip a bite out and top it up with a bite of boil water and then put it in
S0432	yeah
S0503	so it's the right sort of temperature i mean i know i shouldn't do that but
S0432	well he seem to be fine
S0503	and like if it's like say he sleep till three and it be cold but it's not be cold
S0432	yeah
S0503	like but if he's not have a fee and like i think i'll give him a warmer breakfast but yeah he be fine so

S0432	this be one this be a black and white one her hair look a bite bald
S0503	oh yeah it look like it's not
S0432	it's a bite straggly
S0503	fall out at the front but it's like it's sort of come from the back to like cover it yeah
S0432	yeah like a comb forward instead of a comb over
S0503	and i think you're cute i think you be
S0432	he look i think he look more like a baby
S0503	yeah

S0503	tiny
S0432	yeah she be
S0503	what be up with you
S0432	these be the recent ones do you need to sleep
S0503	she doesn't have a baby nose do she
S0432	no maybe that's it
S0503	like baby always have a flat sort of button nose whereas hers look like a normal person's
S0432	yeah i think it's 's nose that she's get but and 's face
S0503	his mum say they don't usually have like the bridge of their nose and stuff like yet
S0432	mm
S0503	but i think that she
S0432	she do you can tell in that photo i don't know if it's the light
S0432	what's the matter do you need sleep
S0432	be that a yes do you just say yes
S0503	oh
S0432	let's bounce you oh
S0503	bottle and pyjamas i have to do
S0432	i know
S0503	you see i don't know if i should try him in his grobag but then i'm like if he doesn't sleep i don't know whether it's cos he won't be tuck in and he doesn't like a grobag
S0432	what be yeah maybe not tonight maybe tomorrow be that like a sleep bag
S0503	yeah it like zip up and it's like over there and then just
S0432	oh yeah yeah
S0503	it zip up like that
S0432	they're cute aren't they
S0503	yeah cos he do kick all his blanket off but i think i tuck him in a bite better last night cos usually i put i do a blanket and then a sheet but the sheet's quite small cos it always just he'd pull it out but i put the blanket underneath and then the blanket be really long and i tuck that under so i think that'll hold the sheet in a bite more so he be still tuck in this morning
S0432	oh
S0503	unless he just wasn't as wriggly cos that one night wednesday night when go to pool and when he get back he have to retuck him in cos he'd shove up the bed a bite
S0432	be that because he get really hot and he doesn't wanna be in the
S0503	i don't know
S0432	in the in the blanket
S0432	if he's anything like
S0503	yeah i know
S0432	for the cold
S0503	then i always think he have a few blanket on and like a little vest and sleepsuit yet we're in like pyjamas with a massive quilt on us
S0432	yeah
S0503	and i sometimes get into bed and think oh it's chilly
S0432	oh you're so wriggly
S0503	like he's start be sick as well a bite recently and i don't know whether he's have too much milk for his belly but like he obviously be still hungry and he have it all
S0432	be it anything to do with the fast teat oh that would have hurt
S0503	no
S0432	he just put his head into my earring
S0503	oh he always head butt me
S0432	be it do you reckon he's get like too much too ah too much too quick
S0503	it might be it might just be that it's too much milk for his belly cos he be fall asleep in the other one so i make it that's two i should probably get very teats but they're well expensive so
S0432	yeah i can imagine what be that base on like how they suck it
S0503	yeah
S0432	you just want to see me do you do you and what's happen to your top again i pull that down mr wriggly bum tickle tickle tickle
