S0202	erm i've get my welcome back meet on the twenty sixth of september i don't know where i want to go because like they say it be vital last year and it be fuck shit there be no point even go
S0208	yeah
S0202	like it's say this meet will provide you with important information about the forthcoming academic year therefore it be vital that you attend
S0208	although second year i guess it might be a little bite more important
S0202	yeah
S0208	explain things well we we're go to be there together we can always just travel up together
S0202	that's the day before the engagement party yeah we can i'll get to take us it's between twelve thirty to one thirty but
S0208	how how do you find out about that
S0202	i get an email like you want to check your email cos
S0208	earlier i didn't have anything but i'll keep check cos if mine's on the same day then we can just commute together
S0202	yeah well will take us anyway so
S0208	if it's not on the same day it'll be slightly more difficult
S0202	mine's school of english so i i reckon yours will be the same day because that's the day that everyone go back i think it's the the last day before the new term but will be travel to work every day that week so
S0208	okay
S0202	like he won't mind take you you might just have to hang around at uni for a few hours extra than if you would have if you get a train
S0208	yeah obviously if he be if he be take me then that's not a problem can't wait to just move in though get all my stuff decorate my bedroom
S0202	when you get when you and come up to do you want to go shop at the i can get 's mum to take us
S0208	yeah that would be really nice actually
S0202	erm
S0208	but erm
S0202	and cos they've get load of cheap stuff that we can buy to decorate
S0208	erm i would actually if you wouldn't mind i'd say wait until we've move stuff in
S0202	yeah
S0208	to see what we actually need and like what space there's go to be cos there's five of us and we've all get extra stuff
S0202	no i mean for our room like i want to get some fairy light i want to get like some nice bed and stuff like that
S0208	oh right okay yeah no we can do that yeah definitely i'm go to get another set of bed as well because two it be like it be alright but as soon as i'd take one off i'd have to wash it so it would be okay next one
S0202	yeah yeah but at least this year we get free wash
S0208	yeah
S0202	like cos that be really annoy last year have to go all the way downstairs and
S0208	can't wait to get my special pillow back i didn't really think it through because i buy it with me when we be drive
S0202	yeah
S0208	from here to england cos it's like my favourite pillow it's so squishy and lovely
S0202	yeah
S0208	erm and i didn't really think it through that i wouldn't have it back in so like christmas it be really hard i have to i'd like literally try every single pillow in the house now i find one that's okay
S0202	yeah that you can sleep on
S0208	yeah
S0202	well i've get special pillow i think that's why i've get a bad neck because the pillow that i've get be specifically design for the way that i sleep and i think that's why i've get a bad neck cos i'm sleep on
S0208	sleep on random pillow
S0202	yeah a square one that ain't no offence to the but it's not very good to be quite honest
S0208	no i it take me age to get rid eh use to the square ones but i've get use to them now so like i know that i'll sleep on it for a few nights on one side and then flip it over cos all the squishiness go up to one side so i just keep flip it
S0202	what's your favourite part about move in next year like what be you look forward to the most
S0208	erm
S0202	everything's alright between me and now by the way
S0208	oh yeah yeah i've notice it's fine
S0202	yeah like we talk to each other a lot
S0208	i think i'm really look forward to have like our first meal and first drink all five of us together
S0202	yeah
S0208	but also have access to food whenever i want
S0202	yeah
S0208	and have free wash
S0202	yeah
S0208	just little things that you don't really think be important but i'm really look forward to
S0202	yeah
S0202	i'll tell you what i'm not look forward to the trek into uni but like i'm quite lucky cos my timetable have be set as i'm in for full days not just an hour here and there so like
S0208	that's good lucky do you have any days off
S0202	yeah two i think or one i think it's one but it depend on cos you don't get your seminars until like till your first weeks
S0208	till you literally start
S0202	so my seminars might be on awkward days but if they be then i'm just go to swap them cos i'm not pay bus fare to get in and out when i don't need to when i could be study at home
S0208	yeah
S0202	because they say your degree be full time and you need to do all this study but like if you're in i mean we don't get a lot of teach hours for each module don't get me wrong but like you're in for like three or four days where the fuck be you suppose to find the time to do all the read all the other work
S0208	do all the read i'm go to set myself what i use to do back when i be board i use to set myself an hour per night and even if i didn't have any homework i would just read over my lessons
S0202	yeah
S0208	so like an hour per night sometimes it would be more but i'm go to do that this year now
S0202	do i do i tell you that they've introduce record of lecture
S0208	yeah you mention that the other day that's brilliant
S0202	yeah erm you're not allow to record in lecture now any more without without prior write permission but that be the same before anyway i just use to record like anyway no one know erm but apparently like not all lecture be do it lecturers be do it it's not a requirement but it's like to help your learn but i don't think that my lecturers won't do it i know they won't because they'd get piss off when cos then people won't turn up and they'll get piss off and they'll just stop do it
S0208	yeah
S0202	because last year on a wednesday morning at ten like the first lecture at ten o'clock and it be the only lecture i have all day so i never use to go to it cos it be fuck shit anyway
S0208	yeah
S0202	and erm no actually i do use to go to it i use to go to it every single wednesday and every single wednesday she would send an email email out after the lecture say the lecture hall be empty there be about ten people there and i'm just like well don't fuck hold it on a wednesday morning then the day after like student night i know like that's daft but the fact of the matter be like students be there to learn yeah but they're still go to go out and get piss every night
S0208	yeah
S0202	like or piss on certain student nights
S0208	especially first years
S0202	so why would you hold it at ten o'clock on a wednesday morning like why would you do that it's just ridiculous but every single day throughout the whole year she send an email out say the lecture attendance be scarce i'm go to start do register blah blah blah she never do never once do a register
S0208	mm
S0202	i be like if you're go to threaten it do it because then people will be scar
S0208	yeah that would get them in
S0202	then that would get them in but like don't just threaten it all year and never do it because people will just think like well you say you be go to do it and you never do it so i'm just go to ignore you next time
S0208	yeah i need to check my time it's on my list of things to do today go to actually check it because it didn't seem like anything be clash but there be no seminars write down it be just lecture
S0202	yeah
S0208	but there be like
S0202	but you can email to get them change them seminars
S0208	load of load of different options for each thing so like it be literally the whole thing be full but when i actually look at it closer it be like there be actually a lecture slot here but the same one like the same lecture but at a different time
S0202	yeah
S0208	so like i don't think that when i look it be quite early on so i don't think they'd even sort it out yet
S0202	yeah no yeah your seminars be like the week before you even start
S0208	i'll have a look at it now to see my lecture and stuff because then i can start think about when i want my seminars to be cos obviously i want to have a lecture first before a seminar because well there's no point in have a seminar the begin of the week
S0202	you have that last year didn't you
S0208	yeah it be just like there be nothing for us to do in that seminar
S0202	do you not discuss the last week's stuff
S0208	well that's what we start do because the woman be like this be actually pointless because we're go to be discuss things you haven't even see in your lecture yet in which case it doesn't really work
S0202	yeah
S0208	so instead what she do be for one week she hold off the seminars let us catch up a week of lecture and then what we do be on the monday we would discuss the lecture from last thursday
S0202	yeah
S0208	and stuff like that
S0202	one of my lecture lecture one be on a thursday and lecture two be on a tuesday how the fuck do they work that out
S0208	what do you mean
S0202	so do you know i have for some of my modules i have two lecture per week
S0208	yeah
S0202	so lecture one be on a thursday but then lecture two be on a tuesday how the fuck do they work that out unless we start our first day be on a thursday and that's why it's lecture one lecture two
S0208	it's not it's monday
S0202	well i don't know why they've do that then it's ridiculous
S0208	it's weird maybe it will pan itself out
S0202	oh yeah i've have a i'm really piss off cos i can't drop literature and just do full language there's no space available apparently and erm so i can go to language and linguistics but i don't want to do linguistics i'm go to have to catch up a whole year of fuck shit to do linguistics
S0208	yeah
S0202	so it's just like well i don't want to do that
S0208	maybe literature will be a bite more interest for you this year though
S0202	yeah hopefully because i don't want it to affect my degree because i'm not very good at it like that exam mark forty two percent that be disgust like all my essay i get sixty five sixty seven percent
S0208	mm
S0202	so how can they justify give me forty two percent in an exam
S0208	yeah it's not very
S0202	like how do that work out
S0208	it's not very fair on you
S0202	it's like i get sixty five percent all year sixty seven percent and then in my exam i get forty two percent
S0208	i can't wait to go get my feedback though cos obviously i wasn't there so i don't know what go along with my grade
S0202	yeah
S0208	i don't know why it be like that or i guess i'm just anxious to find it so that i know not to do the same mistake next time
S0202	yeah
S0208	which be why i think it's silly like when say that they don't get feedback i be like how be that go to help you learn
S0202	yeah
S0208	if you don't know what it be specifically that you're do wrong you'll keep do it
S0202	yeah
S0208	cos you don't realise you're do it wrong and that's such a bad way of learn
S0202	yeah it be a terrible cos you're just go to keep make the same mistake until someone point them out
S0208	well yeah like people don't learn unless they know it's mistake and like that's what you're there for you're there to learn how to do it right so like obviously you're go to have bad feedback but that's the point
S0202	even if it be bad it's constructive like cos you can work on it you can make them skills better
S0208	exactly what's the point of you turn up and be perfect there's no point go to university if you're perfect
S0202	no there isn't you're obsess absolutely obsess she look like she's go to kill you
