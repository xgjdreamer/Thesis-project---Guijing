S0083	there's fruit in this
S0084	yeah in the jam
S0083	fruit in the jam in the juice in anything really
S0084	yoghurts
S0083	yes it shouldn't be there
S0084	i don't like the yoghurts with bits in
S0083	with bits in i mean they're it's fruit
S0084	yeah it's
S0083	you're mean to eat fruit
S0084	fruit no i don't like it
S0083	oh dear i think you'd improve
S0084	no
S0083	well clearly not
S0084	no no no no no
S0083	and how be you
S0084	i'm exhaust
S0083	be you
S0084	ah i've just have the supplier come around to well when i say we i have to do a review meet
S0083	mm mm
S0084	and my brain ache i've be dread it for about a month
S0083	oh dear
S0084	i wake up with like a sick feel butterfly
S0083	oh no
S0084	yeah i've be really dread it because i have to lead the meet
S0083	oh
S0084	yeah
S0083	my daughter the manager
S0084	mm hardly but
S0083	you're so capable and
S0084	i'm not i want to cry
S0083	oh i think this be excellent
S0084	it's horrible
S0084	mm horri bubble but it be good it be erm because we've reach the end of two of our project that they've be project manage for us
S0083	mm
S0084	and we're replace the typesetter the typeset work with indian suppliers
S0083	oh excellent
S0084	yup because they're five pound a page rather than twenty five pound a page which uk suppliers be
S0083	mm
S0084	but they're rubbish so it's a completely
S0083	well yes
S0084	false economy
S0083	exactly
S0084	erm so we're look at ways of make it a bite easier for them look at ways look at how they've really let us down and
S0083	mm
S0084	because it be the first time we've use this project management company and the guy the md use to work in house
S0083	right
S0084	a really nice guy
S0083	mm
S0084	he use to work in like our academic division so he know my old boss because she work in academic
S0083	mm mm
S0084	and another one of the erm one of my er colleagues who be on maternity leave at the moment there's another production controller so it be good for him to come in and
S0083	mm
S0084	for us to say like we're all a bite concern about these issue how have you find it because he's essentially the buffer between us and the typesetter so he deal with a lot of their query but i think actually in reality the biggest problem be they don't query stuff so when it come in it's not it's substandard and they haven't raise
S0083	oh dear
S0084	any concern so erm we've do two of the six title so far erm so it be a good point to just take stock and hold a review so my boss call in from the state which she have to leave after half an hour because of train but she's deal with the same one of the same suppliers in new york and for some reason that i don't understand in new york they erm they've place all their work with one supplier which be they do it before with a company call adventure house and they go bust
S0083	oh
S0084	which be not what you want really because they've get all your file all your format all your cover
S0083	yeah
S0084	all your body file and they have it and now they've ask erm and obviously you don't you can't by spread yourself around by spread the work around you force competition so you get better rat so if you're think with your business head on
S0083	have erm yeah yeah i mean that be obviously what you're suppose to do
S0084	obviously you want to build relationships with people because then you understand each other you know each other you rely on each other and they understand your product
S0083	mm
S0084	but you know we have we have about four or five different suppliers in the uk
S0083	mm
S0084	we have about three or four indian suppliers that we're start to place work with erm so
S0083	be they improve though
S0084	mm
S0083	not really no
S0084	one of them be rubbish
S0083	use to erm complain about do that cos they're you know all company do it she say the paper be poor quality the ink be of poor quality
S0084	well luckily they don't erm control that
S0083	alright
S0084	i mean they literally do the design
S0083	right
S0084	erm and the products that we have and work on should in theory be extremely straightforward because they've practise test in cambridge esol so cambridge esol
S0083	oh i see
S0084	supply us with the exams
S0083	mm
S0084	we copy edit it erm we'll put our copyright line in you know we jazz it up a bite we lay it out erm and that's it it should be a relatively straightforward piece of work for some reason they're get it wrong you know we've find today with the set of proof that they're copy and paste from one
S0083	no
S0084	set of proof to another and so you've get half of one exam and half of another i mean it's just awful it's really basic
S0083	but that's really bad
S0084	bog standard stuff
S0083	yeah
S0084	particularly because we're we're we're move into a digital age where if we supply a word document it's already style so that they can flow it straight into their template in their design template
S0083	mm mm
S0084	they're not do that even though it's that would be the easiest thing to do sorry be i bore you
S0083	no i'm i be listen
S0084	what be you do you're not listen you're play
S0083	i be
S0084	put the tv on then
S0083	i be listen
S0084	er anyway so yeah so they come in and we have a chat
S0083	mm
S0084	end of story it be long it start at two
S0083	mm
S0084	and gradually everyone have to go to another meet so there be just me and joe it be fine i'm glad it's over but it be really useful
S0083	mm
S0084	cos it be a i think he's take stuff away and we've take stuff away so
S0083	good
S0084	it be good
S0083	be you go to be do more with these now be this this be gonna be part of your life now do meet like this
S0084	yeah i hate it
S0083	oh you don't hate it it's just it's just
S0084	i do hate it it make me feel sick
S0083	it make you a bite nervous that's all but
S0084	that's why be insist i go on this presentation skills workshop which be awful you have to give a presentation in the morning and she say when they'd confirm my place and she send me an email to say now you must remember that i do my presentation on ladybird book and do hers on bake so you've get a really high standard to maintain here but a talk for about five minutes on whatever you fancy erm and then you do the workshop and then you have to give a presentation on your job at the end of the day but you should come prepare with some material and then you hone it during the day so so she say it be really useful i mean i'm dread that there's gonna be role play and
S0083	yes oh this be your business
S0084	all that horrendous stuff
S0083	life now
S0084	i hate it
S0083	oh
S0084	but while those course be available and they're not free
S0083	yeah
S0084	but you know they could be they're free for me
S0083	yeah
S0084	the department pay
S0083	exactly we'll take them up on it
S0084	but you might as well
S0083	just think of erm i always think this be so funny and i can't i think her name be wasn't it in when she work in the office
S0084	mm mm
S0083	and she have to give that presentation and she have the circle
S0083	and
S0084	do she say what be we do
S0083	yes i can't remember when it be it be it be ridiculous
S0084	mm and they all applaud
S0083	and and they all applaud yeah that be so funny
S0084	and she ask everybody what be what be we do here
S0083	yeah
S0084	what what be this job and no no one tell her no one can answer her
S0083	but it's all just it's all just word and they don't mean anything and the idea be they don't mean anything and erm name for things that don't mean anything be actually all of it be just meaningless
S0084	erm and they just business speak be so stupid the
S0083	yeah
S0084	the things that they say like i be in a meet with erm it be when i be be a pa for geoff and i be take minutes and he be talk about something or other and he say we'll take this offline which just mean we'll talk about it later
S0083	mm
S0084	why not just say that
S0083	i know
S0084	or or go forward or what
S0083	mm
S0084	you know
S0083	it's all just jargon and
S0084	all management speak it's just
S0083	business speak and
S0084	you just sound like an idiot
S0083	it's it's all horrible i hate it
S0084	mm we've get to you've get to embrace it though if you want to get ahead
S0083	i suppose you do
S0084	and maybe it just happen one night you just wake up and you speak like an idiot
S0084	that's what i'm worry about
S0083	i think i think it's if you're in that environment you just it's you just become like that
S0084	yeah
S0083	and you start speak like them
S0084	yeah
S0083	so watch it we'll pull you up on it if we if we
S0084	well i already tell you that i felt sick the the other week when i have to erm knock down one of our uk suppliers
S0083	mm
S0084	on their price they'd quote fifteen pound a page which actually be no actually thirty pound a page for a for quite a difficult complex book
S0083	mm
S0084	and i i have to knock them down to twenty five
S0083	mm mm
S0084	and they be we go to see them and they're really nice have get a really nice set up but they're struggle for work like they keep email say if you've get any project you know we could handle anything any size shape whatever and you know that actually they've get a lot of overheads in the they expand i don't know if it be last year or the year before at a time when we be look to
S0083	but they they're obviously struggle now
S0084	offshore and they're struggle and so but you say well i would pay thirty pound but i know that because you're struggle you'll take twenty five
S0083	mm
S0084	and you're not you're not cut off
S0083	it's horrible isn't it
S0084	their hand but it just make you feel sick
S0083	yeah
S0084	and you think well that's basically what you have to do
S0083	it be horrible mm
S0084	i mean it's not it's not erm it's not it wouldn't be a problem to pay thirty pound a page because that's what you would expect to pay
S0083	mm
S0084	but we do say to them when we go to meet them that erm you know we be be ask to the dictat from on high be
S0083	yeah
S0084	offshore where possible
S0083	yeah
S0084	erm and if and our argument be it's a false economy because
S0083	mm
S0084	the amount of time we've spend in man hours liaise with them and answer the most basic of query and send stuff back when it's wrong
S0083	mm
S0084	you know to pay a production controller's salary you might as well freelance it out to a get
S0083	mm
S0084	uk supplier and get it right first time someone who know you
S0083	well yes
S0084	it's just
S0083	sometimes it be just a false economy
S0084	mm we be say that they'd have to come and come down on their price
S0083	mm
S0084	if they want to keep the work and it's probably what they're gonna have to do
S0083	it's very hard though cos you know small company er will really struggle in this kind of climate
S0084	and really at this time you want to be place work
S0083	mm
S0084	with suppliers you trust and
S0083	you would think so but it
S0084	suppliers in the uk
S0083	but every company when it come to it will will it's just the bottom line be the only thing that matter
S0084	mm
S0083	their own profit be the only things that erm
S0084	yeah
S0083	really matter
S0084	and we're not
S0083	so
S0084	we're not make any money
S0083	no
S0084	we're really not
S0083	and that's what that's what'll happen
S0084	mm
S0083	mm oh dear
S0084	mm it's a problem
S0083	mm
S0084	oscar i know you can hear me you just twitch your ear
S0083	he look even funnier from the other side
S0083	he look hilarious
S0084	half a head
S0083	yeah i can't even see his ears you can just you can just see this much
S0084	mm do they do it when it's rain
S0083	yes and i mean it's not rain at the moment so maybe he's just be cautious because he think it will any minute now
S0084	because he get very wet today
S0083	he always get wet
S0084	your bedroom doors be open though
S0083	yes well my duvet cover be cover in muddy footprints so i don't see the point in wash it until it stop rain and he stop jump on it
S0084	it's be rain for about three weeks
S0083	i know
S0084	mm
S0083	it's just so difficult to keep him out you know i don't it's a small flat and he's my cat erm i don't like chase him out of place
S0084	mm
S0083	but i do get feed up with paw print everywhere
S0084	like here
S0083	oh yeah and all up and down here i mean it's just
S0084	tend to wipe his feet when he come in
S0083	yeah i would do
S0084	the paw
S0083	he's also moult so there's fur everywhere i've just hoover big clump of hair everywhere or fur i should say
S0084	mm
S0083	anyway
S0084	so how have your day be
S0083	quiet i've have a quiet one
S0084	oh that sound nice
S0083	yes well i seem to need it
S0084	you've have quite a busy week from the sound of it 's and 's
S0083	i know i mean it's it be ridiculous it's erm i don't know it's just just me erm and when i only go to 's for a couple of hours so i mean it's not
S0084	mm
S0083	not onerous it's not erm it's just the the have to go there and i suppose i mean i do go from 's to his yesterday but the day before i didn't i just go straight there erm but i don't know i i just i just have this feel that i've take on too much i mean it's by any stretch it's really not but it it's begin to feel like it to me and i i'm try not to let it erm also 's erm erm he's he's start a project
S0084	mm
S0083	that erm he'd like me to be involve with and it sound really good and it shouldn't be too much i mean i'll you know i just say it's on a proviso that you know if i feel i can do it i'll do it and if i feel i can't then you know he's fine about that erm it just feel a bite much i suppose because it's not none of it be be just i mean obviously this be a good thing but it's also a bad thing from my point of view
S0084	mm
S0083	none of it be just turn up do it and go home i mean with you know i'm emotionally involve now
S0084	yeah
S0083	erm she be quite down erm the the scan be i mean it wasn't it wasn't terrible but they be grow again and she's start she's she will be start the next kind of treatment which which be a it's an unusual thing it's it's quite new it's only receive erm erm a a sort of license or approval or some i don't know whatever whatever you have to do to to get erm medication or a treatment pass in this country
S0084	mm
S0083	erm i think two years ago maybe less erm so it's quite new it's a form of chemotherapy but it's erm it's a tablet and it work in a different way
S0084	right
S0083	so you just take tablets but there be quite a few side effect and she's obviously worry that the side effect be go to be something she can't cope with there be quite a lot
S0084	really will it make her lose her hair
S0083	no i mean it the thing that will bother her most i think be erm be nausea and sickness
S0084	mm
S0083	it also can affect your blood pressure your iron level your thyroid level i mean there's quite a few things it can interfere with so
S0084	blimey because that be a problem last time
S0083	but they do
S0084	wasn't it all the nausea
S0083	absolutely and she do have it all the time and she have there's there be quite a few anti nausea erm drug but only one of them be be effective for her and it's it's fairly expensive and they be so stingy with it they only ever give her ten at a time or something and she have to take one every day if she doesn't then she end up you know be sick or just feel so sick that she can't do anything they be so stingy with them and i think if she's get cancer you know come on give her the bloody tablets
S0084	mm mm yeah absolutely
S0083	i just i just think it's so bad
S0084	mm
S0083	anyway
S0084	yeah absolutely
S0083	so i think she's worry about that erm so she be not herself yesterday erm and i can understand that and there be two there be two type of this they've get different name and i suppose they will try one or then the other and see how she be with either of them but actually erm this be the last you know there be no other options
S0084	last options
S0083	yeah that so either of these hopefully they will and people do i mean i be read on one of the blog you know people take them for fifteen years or something you know
S0084	oh god
S0083	so you know you can
S0084	yeah
S0083	so long as it agree with you and so long as it work
S0084	yeah
S0083	but it be effective for this kind of cancer so
S0083	yeah
S0084	well that's good news cos this
S0083	so they've get everything cross and i suppose alex be run around like a crazy person follow up you know he's make some very good connections now with these with this virotherapy but
S0084	mm
S0083	i don't know i don't know how close he be to get anything organise i've email him but i haven't hear back so i don't know
S0084	mm
S0083	sometimes he's just incredibly busy speak to er i think he's very good you know he doesn't i mean he go straight to the person you know he'll read about the the research at this clinic in this hospital in this place and this be the consultant who be do it or this be the scientist who be do it and he just ring them up
S0084	right fine
S0083	and and the thing be that they're brilliant they say oh yeah yeah what do you want to know about it yeah no this really interest and they talk away for hours to him so

S0084	mm
S0083	and such a good way about him and they're they seem very happy and and keen to talk about it and to discuss what they've do and you know possibilities and
S0084	mm
S0083	you know so that's what he's do he go straight to the top

S0083	it's nice to have
S0084	they sound like witch
S0083	a name that stand out you know i don't know
S0084	it's nice to have a name that's quite different
S0083	i mean
S0084	not that it be anymore
S0083	so your name we want something traditional and we think it would be unusual in those days
S0084	not that it be
S0083	to have you know everyone be call or or or
S0083	you know and we think well be be a much more traditional and beautiful name so we go with that and of course everyone be you know it be it be still the most popular girl's name that year
S0084	yeah
S0083	which we we didn't we hadn't bank on that at all erm
S0084	yeah good work
S0083	well you don't know these things do you i mean i'm would you rather have be or
S0084	no obviously not
S0083	well there you go you would have be one of millions
S0083	be actually a lovely name
S0084	i really like the name
S0083	yeah i don't think i do at the time but i do now i think it's a really nice name
S0084	mm i like that as well
S0083	because it also mean star
S0084	that's what i mean yeah no i wouldn't spell it with an a er
S0083	no it's it's with an a
S0084	no other than star poor well that's pretty excite news though i mean for him to have actually
S0083	i know i
S0084	and he's be the one to write it himself though
S0083	i think it's interest i think the the break ankle be actually quite erm crucial i think what that's do be that erm they've obviously not be perform and i think he's have some time
S0084	mm
S0083	and i think he's have some space to actually you know go off on his own
S0084	mm
S0083	and write the letter
S0084	mm
S0083	and i think she probably be very domineer
S0084	mm
S0083	and not that he you know i mean he obviously enjoy that and be happy about it
S0084	yeah
S0083	but
S0084	it doesn't leave much room for anybody else
S0083	no and i think this have give him some some space to do it
S0084	mm er forgive me i can't remember be you his only child
S0083	erm no he have he have a a daughter be his second wife and he marry erm er a woman call june and they have a little girl call who be about i think i think she be bear ten years after me erm wasn't sure whether it be sixty seven sixty eight or sixty nine but
S0084	mm
S0083	it's around that
S0084	mm
S0083	that sort of time erm erm and then they get divorce and he marry so erm but one of the things that that say when she write cos she do write i mean she say
S0084	oh and there be
S0083	that it be from the both of them
S0084	both but it be her and not him
S0083	but it be you know she say oh have ask me to do this erm but it be it be clearly from her
S0084	mm
S0083	i mean he might well have do he might have i mean i presume it be a a shock
S0084	mm
S0083	but anyway erm i mean she know about me but
S0084	mm
S0083	anyway and so she's i think she's i think she's quite difficult and i think you know that's where there's go to be a problem
S0084	mm
S0083	erm she didn't get on with her and erm i think her name be samantha i'm sure it be yeah erm and didn't get on with her now what she say be that samantha never accept her but basically they've cut her out of their live
S0084	oh i didn't know this
S0083	she say oh it's very sad and it's very you know all the rest of it but that you know that's what she want to do and we have to live with that kind of thing and i'm think mm it sound like it's probably the other way around
S0084	mm
S0083	erm and i be quite shock that you know that he would be okay with that but
S0084	mm
S0083	maybe he's one of these men anything for a quiet life
S0084	mm
S0083	i get the feel he probably be
S0084	mm
S0083	erm so she wouldn't er she wouldn't say anything about her now what i would like to do be be actually ask him you know in a very sort of gentle way i know you know things be difficult between them
S0084	mm
S0083	but would he be okay could he give me her you know an address or or something so that i could contact her would he be okay with that you know i don't i don't i'm not gonna force the issue with them
S0084	mm
S0083	but would he mind if i do because i would like to contact my sister so and i as you as you say i mean this come totally out of the blue and i'd really just resign myself to the fact that they didn't want to know and that be that there's nothing i could do about it
S0084	mm mm
S0083	i mean i suppose if i do have the money i could have go out there and and it might have be awkward it's a long way to go if you're not sure of your welcome erm it would have force the issue wouldn't it but but anyway erm but i have kind of get use to the idea and that be that you know so but this do open up all kinds of things again which be nice
S0084	very excite
S0083	which be nice i i mean i'm really please
S0084	it's really good
S0083	i be very touch very touch especially you know when he when he address it and i think oh you know that's
S0084	yeah of course
S0083	i be quite emotional about that
S0084	yeah yeah yeah
S0083	very emotional about it so
S0084	yeah it's a really nice way to open the letter
S0083	it be i mean i know the rest of it be a bite odd but anyway
S0084	well i mean how old be he
S0083	it's it's really nice
S0084	anyway
S0083	he's eighty one
S0084	well there you go
S0083	yeah
S0084	he probably be a bite bananas
S0084	he live out in australia
S0083	yeah
S0084	it be in queensland and they're all bananas
S0083	yeah well maybe well i certainly think erm if you go out there next year you should go you know
S0084	well only if you think that that's okay
S0083	have a have a weekend oh i i absolutely do i think i mean presumably there might have be a couple more letter by that stage
S0084	mm
S0083	erm and you know you should do that whether i'll ever have the money to do it be another matter entirely so
S0084	mm
S0083	because i can't imagine how much the flight might be
S0084	it depend when you want to go i mean the good thing be
S0083	well i'd go when it wasn't hot so
S0084	yeah exactly well yeah i mean queensland would be okay because it's halfway down on the east
S0083	mm
S0084	like if you be if it be the north
S0083	mm
S0084	then it would always be hot because it's the tropics but yeah i mean if you go on standby if you just go on the hope that you might be able to get a seat obviously you can buy them at the airport and they're cheaper because they just want to fill up the the flight
S0083	really
S0084	yeah remember when will and emma be live in melbourne and be say you can get like you know just come out on standby because obviously i be a student then and they just oh just wait
S0083	yeah
S0084	you know to come out and go on a day when you know if you think like mid week and it's not go to be very busy and they're gonna have empty seat on the plane
S0083	but you'd have to be prepare to go there every day you know on the off chance of
S0084	on the off chance
S0083	of get
S0084	yeah
S0083	i mean that's that's quite a risk
S0084	it be quite a risk that's why people don't do it if you work obviously because if they've
S0083	yeah
S0084	only get two weeks and you need to guarantee you've get a holiday
S0083	yes but if if i mean be it better to book way ahead or
S0084	i still don't know
S0083	nearer the time
S0084	erm i mean they do often do deal
S0083	mm
S0084	i mean i'm gonna try and keep an eye out for british airways but my colleague steve fly to cuba recently
S0083	mm
S0084	on a holiday there and i be so jealous erm and he book with what he think be british airways and i say
S0083	mm
S0084	british airways i don't think fly to cuba but he say yeah yeah it's british airways okay fine
S0083	i didn't think you could go straight there isn't that what you find
S0084	no you can't go from america
S0084	oh from oh okay
S0084	you can go from here but it's virgin
S0083	right oh i see
S0084	which be who i fly with erm or like a tin can
S0083	right
S0084	but you don't want to be do that
S0083	no
S0084	it turn out british airways put their name erm to other airlines and you think you're fly with british airways but you're not
S0083	no
S0084	so steve end up fly with some bucket shop erm tin can
S0083	surely that's illegal
S0084	which must be illegal so he's follow it up with the airline because there's no way they would have go because they get really good deal and they think this be brilliant british airways fantastic get to the airport and they find out they're on some sort of
S0083	how can they do that
S0084	little tin can
S0083	that's so unethical
S0084	so one screen for the whole cabin it's really bad it's it's er basically it's erm trade descriptions act isn't it
S0083	that's outrageous
S0084	because they're say you're get your british airways flight and you're not
S0083	that be outrageous
S0084	so he's gonna follow up with that because that's just absolutely shock
S0083	he'll write to er anne bloody robinson
S0084	yeah she'll take it up she love a good cause so erm with er well when i fly to australia obviously i get a cheap deal in fact it wasn't cheap i just fly with someone who i be the cheapest of the lot but really i fly at a peak time so i'm just
S0083	mm
S0084	wonder if you fly in the middle of the year
S0083	you do you think erm you know you'd pay quite a lot because you go out on box day didn't you
S0084	mm mm yeah my flight be a thousand pound and that be with an airline who only have one screen in the whole cabin and
S0083	oh my god
S0084	that be like budget but when i fly to new zealand it be about i think it be about six hundred pound return
S0083	that's just i can't imagine spend all that money on that cos you need you need money when you're out there
S0084	mm mm
S0083	my god
S0084	but if you go during the year but yeah it probably would be about a thousand pound by the time you i i mean if you depend on how you feel about it and how they feel about it whether you can stay with them you're gonna have to get accommodation
S0083	mm
S0084	and spend money so it'll be yeah a thousand pound fifteen hundred pound
S0083	oh god
S0084	so yeah i mean maybe in the letter you would write back and say yeah i'll i'll certainly be save some money so i'm not quite sure when blah blah
S0083	mm
S0084	erm oh be they come to the uk any time soon and then
S0083	i think she would say if he be i think they're probably not
S0084	mm i mean if he's say that he still owe as much of his mortgage
S0083	i mean he's get
S0084	as he do when he be twenty
S0083	i think it's you see i think she immediately think
S0084	you be after his money
S0083	i be after an inheritance which be ridiculous
S0084	yeah
S0083	but she immediately think that because she make several comment not directly
S0084	directly yeah
S0083	but you know obliquely
S0084	yeah
S0083	erm erm and i think he that that might be a way of him say you know i couldn't help you you know
S0084	mm
S0083	could you know because otherwise he he might have suggest but now anyway
S0084	mm
S0083	so yeah erm i don't think he realise how tough you know economically it be live here so
S0084	mm mm
S0083	excuse me erm so yeah oh i don't know i don't know i might win on the premium bond but i rather doubt it but i mean you know he hasn't get any family here now you know obviously his parent have they die some time ago
S0084	mm
S0083	his his brother er die i think i think i'm sure he say he die well quite a while ago in the early two thousands i think
S0084	mm
S0083	erm i can't remember exactly erm so he's get like nieces and nephews and me and basically that's it so i mean i think before they have reason to come over and and visit family
S0084	mm
S0083	but now no
S0084	yeah there's no reason to come all this way
S0083	no exactly so
S0084	mm so far away why do he have to live in australia for goodness sake why do they move to australia
S0083	i think he like it i think i think he like it there i don't i mean i don't know i don't know i think he go out there because he play with various band and orchestras and things like that and they travel a lot
S0084	mm
S0083	and i'm pretty sure that's what he be refer to you know he the band on these big cruise i think he use to do that for a while erm so i think there be a lot of that and i don't know maybe he just enjoy it there
S0084	mm
S0083	i don't know
S0084	well i mean in term of land you get a lot more for your money
S0083	mm
S0084	you know if if he do
S0083	well it look like they've get quite a nice big place
S0084	right
S0083	you know it's it's er it's a very posh kind of area
S0084	oh right okay
S0083	yeah erm
S0084	i mean australia be expensive but it
S0083	i look i look at it on the erm on google map i look it up
S0084	mm
S0083	well it's it's the gold coast so it
S0084	yeah
S0083	it be an expensive area yeah
S0084	yeah
S0083	mm
S0084	it's a nice nice area
S0083	mm
S0084	a nice area to live
S0083	so you know they've do quite well for themselves i think
S0084	mm mm
S0083	yeah anyway
S0084	so do she have kid
S0083	erm didn't i tell you she have a daughter and er she be murder i tell you this didn't i
S0084	yeah you probably do tell me that i don't know why that didn't stick in my mind
S0083	yeah and
S0084	god
S0083	i think she be her only child and she be incredibly close to her i think this be probably where some of the tension arise
S0084	mm
S0083	you know that she be so and it make me think of erm and erm what's her daughter's name you know 's
S0084	oh erm
S0083	what's her her name
S0084	oh
S0083	it make me think of that she absolutely she be fixate on her
S0084	mm
S0083	and i think there be just no space for anyone else
S0084	mm
S0083	and she become jealous of her and the way that you know be jealous of erm well
S0084	overprotective
S0083	yeah and and have no time for erm lauren
S0084	mm yeah
S0083	it make life very difficult for her and i think it would have be a similar situation i
S0084	yeah
S0083	that's what i'm read into it
S0084	yeah
S0083	that it seem likely that that's what happen erm no and she she go off and meet this erm egyptian guy marry him and er he he murder her
S0084	bloody hell
S0083	there be a big trial and everything yeah and er she's never get over it obviously so
S0084	well no
S0083	and it really be a terrible thing to happen of course it be
S0084	i don't think you ever could could you
S0083	no but erm
S0084	bloody hell
S0083	yeah
S0084	right so there's just the two of them then
S0083	mm
S0084	and do live in australia
S0083	yes but i don't know where and it's a big place
S0084	mm
S0083	erm so i don't know but if i you know if i have some way of find her i'd i'd you know it'd be just nice to
S0084	yeah
S0083	well it would be nice but anyway
S0084	baby step
S0083	yes
S0084	this be really encourage it's really positive
S0083	it be isn't it
S0084	it's nice to think
S0083	it be
S0084	that that's not go to be your last memory of them
S0083	yeah
S0084	you know
S0083	mm
S0084	that he couldn't actually bring himself to write the letter
S0083	mm
S0084	personally
S0083	but maybe it be a shock to the system at the time
S0084	yeah
S0083	and they've both kind of forget about it erm but obviously i think it's be kind of
S0084	yeah it's be in the background
S0083	yeah in the back of his mind and and suddenly he's have a little bite of space to do it and he's actually sit down and do it
S0084	he's probably want to for a while
S0083	i think may be mm
S0084	you know he wasn't sure what reaction she would have if she be a bite if he have pick up on the fact that she be
S0083	mm
S0084	a bite unsure about the whole thing as you say he might have
S0083	i think he's just use to let her make decisions and you know that be that really
S0084	well yeah it sound like it's like that well be tell me she hat it when 's parent come and visit because they always say when be you go to get marry and when be you go to have kid and say and 's dad be very much the same whatever meal they go out for he have exactly what his wife have without fail whatever she order he will order
S0084	go mental she go absolutely spare as you would because what kind of a life be that you know even to the point where your wife dictate every meal you have awful
S0083	i think some men just be like that you know whatever the woman say go
S0084	yeah
S0083	i mean erm be like that you know she organise and book and do every holiday every house move every you know weekend that they go to see auntie this or uncle that you know she organise it and granddad be happy about it i mean men just well that's what the women do
S0084	mm
S0083	they make you know they do all the domestic stuff i go to work that's a very clear division
S0084	yeah
S0083	and it save them from have to think about it
S0084	the precious dears it be my housemate 's birthday yesterday and er you know she want to join the navy
S0083	mm
S0084	and i'd find online a seller who deal in vintage ladybird book
S0083	mm mm
S0084	and you know sort of collectable
S0083	mm mm
S0084	book erm and there be one call the sailor which obviously as the name suggest be about the navy
S0083	mm
S0084	and obviously it's get a picture of a male sailor on the front
S0083	mm
S0084	and he's i've so i get it for her and give it to her yesterday and she open it and there be completely this moment where she think what the hell be this but you know it's only gonna accrue in value like
S0083	mm mm
S0084	they be they be worth something and it's you know it be er it be appropriate but you know when you see something and you think that's perfect and then the closer it get to
S0083	then you think yeah
S0084	the time you think oh i don't know be it
S0083	yes exactly
S0084	but she really do like it
S0083	good
S0084	but it's very i think it's from nineteen fifty seven
S0083	yeah
S0084	so it's obviously very much of its time
S0083	wow that's that's an early one
S0084	yeah really early erm so

S0084	so 's be in brighton 's be in and then i've book the time off but i haven't book the flight yet to go to on the eleventh of july for a long weekend which be a wednesday even 's get all of that week off i haven't see the new house and i won't get to see it obviously at the wed so
S0083	so and you're go for a week then
S0084	er no i'm go wednesday to probably saturday
S0083	okay
S0084	and that's it
S0083	okay that's well that's quite a lot blimey
S0084	that's quite a lot yeah
S0083	bl imey
S0084	i know that's why i have to say no to all the hen party the and hen party be last weekend 's hen party be this weekend and then 's wed be next weekend
S0083	wow
S0084	so you just can't i mean
S0083	no
S0084	and a wed a hen party would have be hundreds of pound so
S0083	yeah it would have be fun but anyway
S0084	it would have be really fun yeah just you know you've get to see the light at the end of the tunnel
S0083	exactly
S0084	like i saw on tuesday and she be say oh i haven't get nearly as much money save as i need and i say well can't your folks lend you and she say her mum obviously be a bite of a cow bag just say categorically before she'd even get the word out no there's no way i'm lend you any money which be really charm but to get into the country you need to have five thousand australian dollars in your bank account to prove that you can sustain yourself and they haven't just pluck this number out the year that's how much you need
S0083	yeah
S0084	but she doesn't have that so she's arrange for her parent to give her two of the thousand dollars erm like a thousand dollars each the day before she fly so it's in the account and then when she go through it'll look like she have the money and then take it out again
S0083	right okay
S0084	but the thing be then she won't have any money
S0083	well she's no quite
S0084	so her dad say i can lend you some money but he he's not flush by any mean so
S0083	no i mean it's it's hard for
S0084	you can't and you can't rely on your parent to do that
S0083	no
S0084	it's not really very fair that they fund your trip
S0083	i mean if they're wealthy then that's another matter but most you know ordinary people be
S0084	no you're generally just survive aren't you
S0083	yeah pretty much
S0084	so and plus it's her she be an adult and she want to go on this trip then
S0083	mm
S0084	she have to pay for it
S0083	she's gonna have to work for another year and save up the same as you
S0084	well she's pay for her flight she's off she doesn't have a job you know she's book the flight for the fourteenth of june or the tenth of june or something i'm not sure she's go erm but she hasn't get money save she'll just come back
S0083	well what oh i see
S0084	because her flight's now be june
S0083	i mean what happen if you go there on on holiday and stay there
S0084	they'll kick you out
S0083	mm
S0084	i mean you can't use any kind of identification because they'll know that you're not mean to be there
S0083	mm mm
S0084	so you have to apply for a work visa which she's be grant
S0083	mm
S0084	erm which be why you need to have the five thousand dollars
S0083	but if she doesn't hasn't get the money there then
S0084	they won't let you in
S0083	she's they won't let her no
S0084	yeah they'll just send you back which be in absolute waste
S0083	and what's she gonna do
S0084	well she say to start work straightaway i mean she want to go all around
S0083	be she gonna be she gonna take a loan out or something
S0084	well i don't know she's only just clear herself of debt
S0083	well she can take a loan out so the money be there but how would she pay it back from there
S0084	exactly well basically she's fine for get the money in
S0083	mm
S0084	she's just not gonna have any money when she's there
S0083	mm
S0084	because her mum at least will take her side of the share of the money back so she'll have to her plan at the moment be to bum around in brisbane of all place and some other random cities just have a nice time and then she'll think about work and i say to her she'll need to work almost straightaway because the cost of live be so high you need to be earn their salary but obviously she want to have a rest and a break and
S0083	yeah
S0084	erm it's gonna be fairly hard i mean obviously unless she teach summer school
S0083	mm
S0084	what be she really gonna be do
S0083	yeah quite
S0084	until the school go back in september or whenever they start back i mean luckily the curriculum doesn't sound like it's that different to ours
S0083	right
S0084	so she would erm the pgce be recognise globally so
S0083	right so she shouldn't have much of a problem
S0084	she wouldn't
S0083	it's just i mean how many job be there for primary school teachers
S0084	well this be it i mean certainly in the uk if you don't have a job by the spring the summer term
S0083	yeah
S0084	you won't have a job for september
S0083	oscar in or out oh thank you mm
S0084	so i don't know i mean she's book the flight the return flight for february
S0083	mm
S0084	but you can you can change it
S0083	right
S0084	it's you pay a premium but you can change it
S0083	hello
S0084	but you need to be really because i mean you don't want to tie yourself in
S0083	well it give her some time to to sort things
S0084	well it might mean that if she can't get a job and all she's get be the money that in her pocket which might only be a couple of thousand that's great for a really nice holiday but she'll be back after three months because the money will have run out
S0083	mm yeah
S0084	but it do mean i mean she must have something she must have like a couple of grand at least she's book all her flight and everything so that's fine
S0083	yeah it just depend how er
S0084	but if she's get a couple of grand
S0083	how expensive it be to live there
S0084	very expensive
S0083	well where where be she gonna stay
S0084	she's gonna have to stay in hostels which be expensive and annoy you know you don't want to stay in a hostel when you're thirty
S0083	no no
S0084	that's why people do it when they're you know eighteen or twenty one
S0083	yeah and they don't they don't care
S0084	and rest
S0083	he do like it up there it's really funny cos i forget he's there and i turn around and oh

S0083	i i doubt it
S0084	they do
S0083	yeah right
S0084	actually have a sale there
S0083	oh that's nice though
S0084	so that's yeah that's where we're do it because the other bite of volunteer stuff be go and build a bird's nest or something and you know
S0083	that would be cute
S0084	it would be it would be nice but they be do it this week in the rain
S0083	yeah
S0084	on the erm a bird hide or something
S0083	well i don't know you you'd quite like that wouldn't you
S0084	i would if it wasn't persist it down then yeah
S0083	yeah
S0084	but
S0083	oh well
S0084	yeah it's good that they do it and they give you the option to volunteer
S0083	yeah
S0084	a day a year so it's good
S0083	yeah
S0084	yup it be good so that's monday then i'm in the office in my current office tuesday wednesday thursday friday
S0083	mm
S0084	and then they're move us over the weekend
S0083	over the weekend yeah
S0084	so it's power down pack everything up next week it's quite good actually everyone's have to shed
S0083	yeah
S0084	all the crap that you accumulate so that's good so i've be have a sort out
S0083	so and where be it then
S0084	it's the it's the other build
S0083	really
S0084	yup so over time what everyone's speculate be that they'll move us all over over there
S0083	yeah
S0084	and sell our build which be a nice build sort of the brown brick
S0083	yeah yeah
S0084	build and sell it on to the property developers because all of that that's now flats be land and bite by bite they've sell it off and it's it's basically be keep the afloat
S0083	sell things off
S0084	sell things off so but the thing be you've only get one access road
S0083	well what happen when they when they've er run out of things to sell
S0084	well i think that's when the redundancies come
S0083	so what what have they do to the print er
S0084	well this where we be now
S0083	i know they sell it off but but i mean
S0084	yeah they've sell the
S0083	they're not offices be they
S0084	no they're it be a hangar
S0083	yeah
S0084	so they've bring in a company to put in a low ceiling and better floor
S0083	yeah
S0084	and light and all the rest of it the report cost be two million pound now i don't know if that's true
S0083	well why would why bother why not just sell that bite off and leave you where you be
S0084	well there's er there's more there's more space to move everybody into that build rather than move everybody from there into ours and ours be older
S0083	oh i see okay
S0084	and so they've move us all into that but i think elt's grow erm at an unsustainable rate
S0083	mm
S0084	very quickly where we actually now er be no more than two hundred and then education they downsize and they have redundancies and they offshore all of their page makeup and all of their cost and they're turn a a really good budget now they're they're make quite a a healthy profit elt be not make a profit this be the first year that i've be there that we won't get a bonus
S0083	oh
S0084	we won't meet budget this year which be really worry
S0083	mm
S0084	it's mainly and mainly because we sell i mean the education team don't sell internationally in the same that we do our market our international market and because of what's happen to the global market at the moment that's affect our sales
S0083	mm
S0084	so our office close recently you know the arab spring probably
S0083	right
S0084	didn't help the office close the office close
S0083	mm
S0084	erm yeah i don't know what's gonna happen i mean if if you have two hundred people basically we don't have enough people to publish the number of products that we have so they're hire but at the same time we've get too many people so i think they're really gonna have to look at
S0083	oh it's strange isn't it
S0084	what we can actually manage to publish and that be the whole thing behind this new restructure in the elt
S0083	yeah yeah
S0084	even though i've be there two years and we've have three restructure hopefully this be it for the restructure but they've decide that they're not gonna publish more products than we already have they're just go to look at respeccing what we already have in theory which should be less work but boost sales and look at obviously digitise everything that we have
S0083	mm
S0084	but i don't know
S0083	oh dear
S0084	but we have a hell of a lot of work on at the moment just and that our digital capacity just isn't isn't there
S0083	mm
S0084	you know that we've have to put on hold two of our global learn course so create something that's completely online
S0083	mm mm
S0084	and no book erm
S0083	wow
S0084	which american institutions and institutions love
S0083	mm
S0084	they want to be completely paperless fine erm but i don't think we have the functionality and the capability there because it's just we've have to put them on hold and it's embarrass
S0083	mm
S0084	i don't know i think the press be
S0083	well i suppose you've get to decide if that's definitely the way you you've get to go
S0084	well certainly that's if that's what the market be tell you they want that's what you have to do you have to respond
S0083	yeah
S0084	so i don't know i mean it's in term of what we have at the moment i don't think our job be in danger because we have too much work but there's certainly our department isn't gonna hire to the point where one of the lads in my department be do maternity cover and what normally what's happen in the last two instance be they've give the person do maternity cover a permanent job
S0083	mm
S0084	because there's money in the budget to do so and we need help that won't happen this time
S0083	no
S0084	and it be really unfair because there's two people in this department who be hire after maternity leave but won't be and he give up a full time job to do this one on the on the hope that it would lead to turn permanent
S0083	yeah i mean i mean you because you you know
S0084	but you can't ever go guarantee
S0083	it's you know it's only for i mean usually maternity cover that's it isn't it so
S0084	well yeah but not it doesn't seem to be at the and then then you get hire that's
S0083	well i think that they've be lucky
S0084	that's not
S0083	in the past because that wouldn't normally happen
S0084	no well i think a lot of the time it sort of happen from within
S0083	mm
S0084	i don't know certainly be hire who's another production controller but for education and he be hire as maternity cover but from erm internally
S0083	mm
S0084	he be work in finance be work in the content service department and then come across because he want a job in our department and think risk it for a biscuit i don't think it's gonna pay off though there's no money but it do make you wonder like if they're gonna manage to promote people when the time come
S0083	yeah exactly well i mean this you know in the long term that's not gonna worry you too much be it
S0084	no but i'd like to leave as a production controller and not a trainee
S0083	yeah
S0084	and i don't know how long it'll take
S0083	to get to that
S0084	to get there
S0083	okay well you'll have to wait and see won't you
S0084	yeah but i mean i'm already worry you know it's the end of april which i can't really believe
S0083	i know i know
S0084	i'm not quite sure how that happen
S0083	no i'm not
S0084	erm but we be
S0083	i wish it be a bite nicer i i really enjoy the light even now it's always a huge relief to me when it's lighter in the even
S0084	yeah absolutely
S0083	but i mean the weather you just wouldn't think everything's grow like crazy out there
S0084	yeah isn't it
S0083	and you know include the weed and and i can't get out there to do anything so
S0084	yeah we need it though
S0083	as soon as as soon as the rain stop we're gonna have to have a blitz out there
S0084	yeah
S0083	we do need it yes definitely but
S0084	that's fine
S0083	it have encourage
S0084	mm
S0083	all kinds of growth everywhere
S0084	i can see the honeysuckle oh that look nice in the corner be that a honeysuckle the yellow
S0083	no it's
S0084	oh
S0083	erm er forsythia i think it's call
S0084	oh
S0083	i mean it's it's very cheerful erm and it's bright yellow in the spring yeah
S0084	i mean really we need to cut down the honeysuckle on the
S0083	we do
S0084	trellis
S0083	i know we do
S0084	sooner rather than later no matter what the weather because as soon as that start bloom
S0083	i know i'm just not go i'm not go out there in the pour rain and pull out plant
S0084	well no but i mean on a day like this i know it's it stop start stop
S0083	yeah
S0084	start because of the wind
S0083	it be yeah
S0084	but actually if you be to run out now and not that any of us be go to for an hour
S0083	yeah
S0084	and hack it down while it's cold and windy but actually not rain that's what we need to do
S0083	i'll see i'll see how how i feel on the next few you know and if it's i mean we haven't have that much rain today yesterday be horrible
S0084	yeah it's be horrible all week
S0083	but it's but today have be better it's just incredibly windy
S0084	yeah
S0083	erm i mean it wouldn't be pleasant go out there in all this wind erm but i'll see how the weather be cos i mean i i be aware of you know things really need to be do i mean look how much the grass have grow
S0084	yeah yeah you can't
S0083	but you can't cut it
S0084	no i know
S0083	cos it's just too wet
S0084	mm
S0083	so we're gonna have to wait until it's all finish
S0084	mm
S0083	i mean i don't know i might have to risk it you know on a on a bright afternoon you know and cut it cos if we can it's if it's gonna rain for another two weeks solidly then what be you suppose to do
S0084	well there's nothing you can do but yes i mean the the grass will just have to grow
S0083	yeah
S0084	but the rest of it we can
S0083	well we'll we'll have to we'll have to give it a try yeah i do i do need to do it i know
S0084	it's my only concern be that big bracken because if we let it bloom it's gonna be a total nightmare
S0083	yeah really hard to do i know
S0084	we need to do it the next week
S0083	yeah
S0084	because really
S0083	yeah i should do
S0084	it be horrible chop it down last year
S0083	i know i know it be i know
S0084	but that's the only thing the rest of it we can dig it up as we you know when the weather be
S0083	as we go yeah
S0084	a bite nicer
S0083	i should go out there and do that at least
S0084	well don't do it on your own cos it's a nightmare but certainly when
S0083	i could have a go at it yeah
S0084	the next time i'm here if it's like this we can go out
S0083	yeah
S0084	and do it or if he's here

S0084	mm
S0083	cos she like those and they're very easy
S0084	yeah
S0083	and kind of vegetable fish finger and things and i'm think really fish and it's just cos it's the shape that's all
S0084	right
S0083	so it's it's all a bite strange but anyway that's fine
S0084	mm mm
S0083	erm because i because she just doesn't cook she heat something up and she just doesn't i mean she do the other day but that's the first time for weeks that she's cook anything and er she always say oh you don't have to do it for me but i but i do it cos i'm gonna do it anyway but sometimes i really just don't want to so we have pizza or scramble egg
S0084	yum
S0083	so for whatever's in the freezer and that's that
S0084	pizza and scramble egg together
S0083	well no

S0084	there you go
S0083	that's what it be florentine it's it's usually you know it's it's a bed of spinach that's be nicely cook and flavour and and you poach an egg on the top of it
S0084	oh well that's the name of the pizza florentine yeah
S0083	well i've never see that on a pizza
S0084	yeah
S0083	which seem a bite strange
S0084	pizza express do one i think
S0083	it seem a bite odd
S0084	yum yum yum in my tum
S0083	no i'm sure that's not right it doesn't seem right to me anyway
S0084	well no cos it's just egg on bread isn't it with tomato and cheese
S0083	yeah it's just you know i'm sure you know pizza be
S0084	pisa
S0083	you know a real italian pizza be be as it be it's not mean to have all these strange and weird and wonderful things on them so oh anyway oh i really fancy a pizza now i wish you hadn't say that and you keep on about it
S0084	put a pizza in the a pizza in the oven
S0083	i might do
S0084	have you get one of your garlic mushroom ones
S0083	i don't know what's leave actually cos she's be hit them quite hard erm and and whatever's leave
S0084	i have one for dinner last night
S0083	do you
S0084	for 's birthday
S0083	oh you might be have another one tonight
S0084	well if dad have get a pizza that'd be find by me but i don't think he's probably cook what he cook every time i go around which be chicken potato and veg which be fine because i never have
S0083	no and you like that yeah
S0084	meat in the house so well i'd rather he didn't cook the potato well i'd rather he mash old potatoes if i be to put in a request but it's fine it's him cook not me so
S0083	well you could always like peel potatoes when you get there and sort of so that when he come in it's that's ready and you know
S0084	yeah i could do i could do i mean i i just let him do what he's think of do
S0083	yeah
S0084	because if you start mess with the the way he do things he doesn't like it no he doesn't like he doesn't know what's happen he's get a very straight idea of what's gonna happen
S0083	oh dear
S0084	i don't want to mess with that cos it might confuse the poor boy
S0083	you see i think that's i think he have take a retrograde step
S0084	well no just that he his reactions all a lot slower when we be drive to wherever we go on the walk
S0083	i don't i don't mean in age i mean because he hasn't have me to nag him to to to think in a different way you know
S0084	well possibly i mean but i don't think that's a problem to him and it's
S0083	no
S0084	certainly not a problem for a i mean
S0083	no it's not
S0084	they but in in a way he's do things that he would never have do before
S0083	yeah and that's that's a very good thing
S0084	which be fine i mean obviously the things he do now be things that you suggest that he do ramble
S0083	mm
S0084	volunteer but they're things that he enjoy so fine
S0083	well if if he enjoy it that's absolutely fine
S0084	mm i mean certainly he get involve to quite a degree
S0083	yeah he do yeah
S0084	you know he's he's treasurer and something else and
S0083	i know
S0084	what have you so
S0083	no it's all good
S0084	it's it's good that he get out and you know
S0083	no it be it's very good
S0084	and meet people but yeah certainly when he be drive i notice that his reactions be quite slow but then that's probably only because i'm i drive now and i compare his drive to my drive and he's i've always think he be a very safe driver which he be
S0083	mm well as you get older your reactions do slow down
S0084	mm but probably you know just sort of hypersensitive to it because
S0083	mm you're you're
S0084	i know what i'm look out for now
S0083	yes exactly yeah
S0084	you know without realise i'm not judge him deliberately i don't mean that i'm judge him at all
S0083	oh
S0084	where's my dinner
S0083	yes where's my dinner who's go to cook me dinner
S0084	your dinner's in the freezer
S0083	well it might be
S0084	have eat all her easter egg yet
S0083	no she's not eat er very much at all she seem to be really off chocolate and i don't know why
S0084	weirdo
S0083	well she eat about three packets of crisp a day
S0084	right hmm you know i i only finish my chocolate bunny at the weekend so that be quite restrain
S0083	that be actually for you yeah
S0084	mm so that be a good two weeks after easter finish
S0083	she's nearly finish her bunny but she's get another thing on the side
S0084	have she
S0083	yeah
S0084	well let's go and liberate it
S0084	which mean you lose quite frankly have she hear anything from the boleyn university application
S0083	erm no er i mean she won't will she or do they send like a
S0084	well they should at least acknowledge the application i mean if they have
S0083	an an acknowledgement that's the word i be think of yeah
S0084	yeah
S0083	erm i don't know
S0084	do you know she hadn't even tell dad she's useless she doesn't tell him anything i mean i know their their relationship be a bite weird but still when i be around there the weekend that she be
S0083	what do you mean she hasn't tell him
S0084	she hadn't tell him he didn't know anything about it she's shock i be there whenever it be the sunday that she be apply because i'd be here on the saturday night
S0083	yeah that's right yeah
S0084	hadn't i or at some point and i make a pass comment to dad about potentially not be here in september and he say why where be she go and i say well you know i know she doesn't want us talk about it that much but you know the boleyn application and he say what he know nothing about it she'd not mention it at all she doesn't do anything to i mean i know he's equally as bad but neither of them make a
S0083	she
S0084	particular effort to see each other
S0083	you see he she doesn't
S0084	if he doesn't
S0083	she doesn't feel
S0084	then she's obviously she doesn't need to either
S0083	she doesn't feel that she should have to make the first move and i i tend to agree
S0084	well that's fine
S0083	but that be after all how he be i mean i'm but you know he shouldn't be like that but he be
S0084	mm
S0083	and i i i feel that i be wrong to say to you a long time a long long time ago when you be have all kinds of problems with him that's just how he be you have to accept it and i think you
S0084	i remember that conversation
S0083	and i think you do and you've always
S0084	but i think i be always more him
S0083	you've always make the effort no but you've always make you've always make people you know if you want
S0084	yeah but that's because i'm selfish and like i i
S0083	it's not a selfish thing
S0084	on him because i that's what i need from him
S0083	yeah but that's
S0084	so i make him do that
S0083	no but but there's
S0084	i don't know whether that's because he should be do that
S0083	but that's a perfectly natural thing for you need that
S0084	yeah
S0083	it's not a selfish thing it's perfectly natural and you prompt him and he then respond because he will he won't do it himself but he will respond
S0084	yeah but then he doesn't
S0083	and if she do the same he would respond to her but she doesn't see why she should have to
S0084	agree i
S0083	that's the difference between you two
S0084	i agree but the more you do it the more he it enter his head to do it with you
S0083	yeah i know
S0084	then because he think right i should call michael and he might not do it but he
S0083	mm
S0084	the feel the think be there which be probably what it be with i should call her and i should arrange to see her
S0083	mm
S0084	but he doesn't actually follow through all of the time and he will call
S0083	he do he do phone her sometimes not very often but he do do it
S0084	and he'll call me and say oh be you gonna come around for
S0083	yeah
S0084	dinner this week or whatever
S0083	yeah
S0084	which be nice and he'll call me at the weekend
S0083	mm
S0084	erm but i don't know whether that's because you know i do go around and see him which doesn't and the think be already in his mind
S0083	mm
S0084	because i have do in the past whereas if just you know when i be live here i would go i would cycle over and see him
S0083	yeah
S0084	you know spend the night there on a friday night or whatever
S0083	mm
S0084	she doesn't do that
S0083	no
S0084	and fine that's their that's up to them
S0083	but then she doesn't you see she she's but also don't forget she doesn't know if if he want her to do that she this be what she feel
S0084	be that be that true
S0083	no she feel that be absolutely true she doesn't know
S0084	what the the thing be with dad the the thing that i've always the reason i've always be able to get over the fact that he can't communicate through word be because i've always be assure of how i feel just through his action obviously i i feel it's true when i say action speak louder than word and i think he show his affection through the things that he do for us but that i also can see that he doesn't necessarily pick up the phone when he should and
S0083	mm
S0084	suggest things when he should but generally speak
S0083	you make allowance
S0084	it go above and beyond what i think be require but i can't i would never question how he feel about any of us and do
S0083	i don't think she question it i think she i think she just question what she should do and why and what she feel he want from her erm
S0084	that's so funny
S0083	mm there's just a different way of look at things
S0084	yeah i would have never have think that i didn't realise
S0083	no she do because he's the parent
S0084	well yes yes
S0083	it should be up to him you know i mean i do i do feel that
S0084	yeah absolutely he should drive the the relationship ultimately
S0083	yes but he's not he's not a good driver
S0084	but then i think you know it be easier when they be live together because obviously they be there and
S0083	yeah
S0084	now that they're not live together i mean i think maybe he make more of an effort when she be at uni because she wasn't in the same city
S0083	yes
S0084	so i think he think oh she's here
S0083	that's right
S0084	now why wouldn't she come and see me
S0083	yeah exactly
S0084	so he's not
S0083	mm
S0084	be the one say well come over because he think oh she must be really busy when in actual fact she's just here every night wait for him to pick up the phone so they're probably both guilty of
S0083	mm
S0084	not make the effort that they should but as to who should start it
S0083	exactly
S0084	who can say i mean yeah there's an argument that it should be dad
S0083	mm
S0084	i would say it should be dad but i suppose my relationship with him be be different
S0083	it be different
S0084	because i
S0083	and you be a different character to her so
S0084	yeah but she's
S0083	the way you respond to him be different to the way she do
S0084	that's probably because i'm a bull in a china shop when i just charge in there and she's more of a retire violet or whatever the phrase be
S0083	yeah but that's you know you you you get result through do that
S0084	yeah but you also annoy everybody because ultimately
S0083	no i don't think so
S0084	you just you're you're not as even though you try to be thoughtful and considerate you
S0083	you be
S0084	you try but yeah but i do feel like you sort of you put yourself out there and you put yourself first and that's all i need
S0083	that's it's always a risk it's not it's not put yourself first you're you're just put yourself out there and that be always a risk but i think it i still think you're right to do it erm and i can understand her reluctance to do that as well so
S0084	yeah
S0083	erm but don't beat yourself up for for any of this
S0084	no well no i just accept that that's that that's my character and that's hers but i do find it strange that she hadn't even mention it to him but then you know if he's he's not very i mean they be meet for lunch and things like that weren't they you know occasionally they'd meet in town or spend a day together
S0083	very occasionally i think that be before she even start work erm
S0084	right
S0083	i mean because i mean like like
S0084	that's the thing she be quite tire
S0083	like it use to you all go over for sunday lunch there
S0084	yeah
S0083	so she do that and then and then you see what happen be that he come over and he's do that a couple of time you know he will come over with when she's here to spend time with her
S0084	yeah
S0083	but i find that difficult
S0084	yeah of course
S0083	so because you know he'll be here for two or three hours and i think oh god just go home
S0084	mm
S0083	erm and that's fine so they get to see each other and that's good but you know it's
S0084	mm
S0083	a bite more awkward for me
S0084	mm
S0083	and i'm not gonna make a big song and dance about it but you know
S0084	well but the thing be she should know that do you know what i mean like she should think it's not fair on you
S0083	i know but she's also she's you know she's tire and
S0084	this be her home
S0083	yeah it be her home
S0084	but
S0083	and when when she's not work i mean she do just kind of sleep and read and that's it
S0084	yeah but you know that's that's not really an excuse
S0083	i mean i might suggest i might suggest
S0084	yeah but you shouldn't have to suggest
S0083	no you see she's work she's work saturday but i don't think she's work sunday i might suggest she go over and have lunch with him on sunday
S0084	i think they should just spend the day or some time just the two of them or if 's there then fine
S0083	mm i might
S0084	but they never do that
S0083	i might i might prompt her to do that because she doesn't do it enough really and i might i might prompt her to go over on sunday maybe because i don't think she's work
S0084	mm but she isn't that sort of person she isn't the sort of person to say what be you up to i'll come over
S0083	no she's not
S0084	she would always wait for the invitation whereas i'm not like that at all
S0083	no
S0084	because i think oh i'd quite like to pop down to and see and i would just say right how do you how how be you fix next weekend i think i'd come down and i would expect other people to be the same
S0083	yeah
S0084	but i suppose it's more polite to wait for an invitation but then in some instance when either either if it's family or if it's close friends
S0083	well no but they they
S0084	they're not gonna judge you if they want to see you
S0083	no and then and they're very happy to to do that
S0084	yeah
S0083	i mean i'm probably very please that you do do that so
S0084	i don't know
S0083	i'm sure they would be i'm sure they would be
S0084	yeah it's just different character isn't it
S0083	it be it be
S0084	she's a funny one
S0083	oh well i think she be a little bite but i think you all be and that's because probably i be so i don't think that's go anywhere that conversation
S0084	you and dad
S0083	mm
S0084	well everyone's a bite peculiar
S0083	yeah we be
S0084	qualities
S0083	i think we're quite normal when i see some people though
S0084	oh yeah i mean but what be normal
S0083	yes yes quite oh i'm tire i think i might put some dinner in the oven
S0084	pisa
S0083	pisa put some pisa in the oven
S0084	yup
S0083	i don't know
S0084	mm when i be in the cinema the other day and there be a trailer for a new ridley scott film that look exactly like alien in fact it's about alien
S0083	surely all his film be exactly the same aren't they
S0084	well gladiator wasn't like alien but this be actually about alien
