S0208	do it make sense to say eight percent dispersion of product x and product y
S0202	what what be the context
S0208	erm it's in it's like science
S0202	yeah
S0208	and 's ask me to translate it for her so in french what she want to say be basically like eight percent dispersion erm of a total mass in a solution so like liquid and solid it's like put powder into liquid and then it turn like the mass
S0202	dispersion yeah i think erm
S0208	cos it sound good to me like that's how i would've translate it it's like eight percent dispersion of product x in product y
S0202	dispersion yeah cos that dispersion mean erm to move or mix doesn't it
S0208	yeah
S0202	i'm just go to just google the definition and then i might be able to
S0208	she's erm go to for two weeks to do her trials so she's just translate all her document
S0202	the action and process of distribute things or people over a wide area erm state of be disperse be she do physics or statistics
S0208	physics
S0202	the separation of white light into colour or of any radiation accord to wavelength
S0208	yeah so like the separation of things into something else yeah
S0202	yeah that sound right yeah
S0208	yeah i love my brother but i'm not confident when it's about english
S0202	i'd say eh his his strong subject be not english
S0208	i'm just read this really funny article that completely relate to me so it's erm twelve secrets skinny fat people have think of a twig roll in gak but cute
S0208	so basically skinny fat be a woefully under representeted eh under represent body type it describe a body that appear relatively slender but that be not tone and be in fact quite squishy and those of us that have this body type harvest several secrets number one we're totally aware that that we look like a steamroll the minute our clothe come off
S0208	let the roll roll free so you don't have to tell us number two yes we're go to eat that and you don't have to ask us where we store it because we both know the answer everywhere
S0208	three not all not all real women have curve some have a sort of amalgamation of angle and squishy bits four yes some of us be perfectly healthy because have a lot of chub doesn't necessarily mean a person be in poor health or doesn't get enough exercise some people build muscle mass easily some don't
S0208	number five then again some of us aren't because ultimately be thin doesn't necessarily mean be mean someone be healthy number six some skinny people have double chin as well as a arm and melty buns isn't the human body a wondrous thing
S0208	seven and sometimes there's no avoid a muffin top they're the new cronut
S0208	eight good posture can do a lot it's like stretch out a roll of cookie dough nine but hey not every thin person have a flat belly pot belly be sexy number ten we know very well which fabrics skim but don't cling eleven do not poke us we will deflate and then attack twelve sure you might say olive oyl be a bite of a skinny fat icon so shake the top of your legs and embrace it cos we don't have bum

S0208	well that wing there at the bottom's rip and it's not on the other side

S0208	and that's one's a bite rip as well but like sometimes butterfly can be fine with a rip wing
S0202	mm
S0208	like i've see other ones with rip wing fly around and stuff but maybe it touch a nerve or something
S0202	yeah
S0208	i just don't understand the anatomy of butterfly

S0208	look
S0202	er
S0208	no vomit i think that she purge herself though the vomit
S0202	yeah she probably felt sick that's probably why she do it long time for a wash
S0208	i always think that but it's because it's that kind of wash machine i don't know like it's she always do it on that one i've ask her about before but she always put it on that cycle
S0202	i put them cos i always put mine on for an hour and then a spin cycle for ten minutes and that always wash mine cos my clothe never get dirty they just need freshen up
S0208	yeah
S0202	bloody fly go away do you want a cigarette
S0202	have those fly actually get teeth then or what

S0202	how do they bite you
S0208	i don't know maybe with pincers
S0202	oh yeah never think of that
S0208	never look into that
S0202	google solve all of life's question
S0208	mm i've get to google about the union jack as well
S0202	yeah they bloody start at half five this morning them roosters
S0208	yeah they do sometimes they start earlier so help you if you're awake right it say it doesn't explain where the jack come from though it say it's so cool because it combine the cross of three countries under one sovereign the kingdoms of england wales and scotland and of ireland but it doesn't say why it's call jack
S0202	don't know
S0208	a look deeper research
S0202	oh er the term union jack derive from the jack flag
S0208	mm
S0202	but i don't really know what a jack flag be maybe it's all together something
S0208	mm it be commonly refer to as the union jack but union flag be actually the correct form as it only become a jack when fly from the ship's jack mast
S0202	oh right well there you go then mystery solve
S0208	union jack mystery solve
S0202	thank you google
S0208	right what be the other mystery
S0202	i don't remember
S0208	no why you do this
S0202	what on earth be you do
S0202	so we're go to go into get some shop
S0208	mm hm
S0202	get some sunglasses
S0208	mm hm
S0202	and then what come back and chill by the pool do the in tomorrow
S0208	mm hm yeah dad say we didn't have to do it today
S0202	cos if we do that tomorrow morning like get up at a similar time do it tomorrow morning and then we've get the rest of the day
S0208	yeah
S0202	and your dad's still happy cos we do what he want us to do
S0208	erm to the big supermarket in first cos if i can get a pair of cheap sunglasses in there save trek into town cos i can get dry shampoo there
S0202	mm
S0208	so i'd rather just stay in one place if possible
S0202	yeah er why don't you invest in a pair of ray ban
S0208	i would but i'm perfectly happy like with some cheap stuff
S0202	yeah
S0208	cos then at least i'll know that i don't have to worry about lose them or break or damage them
S0202	worry about them mm
S0208	cos i don't really like have very expensive nice things cos i'm always scar i'm go to ruin them and then i end up not use them because i don't want to ruin them and that defeat the point of get them
S0202	yeah well i've lose mine already or think i'd lose them
S0202	it's like i have when i go to
S0208	case in point
S0202	yeah when i have s when i go to he drop me off at the airport and he be like if you lose these or break these or damage them in any way you be go to replace them and the whole four days i be terrify of them like i would wear them cos they all they be all that i have but i be terrify of lose them or break them but as soon as i buy my own like that just go out the window just like ah
S0208	mm
S0202	they're mine you know i be still gutted when i think i'd lose them but then i think well they're a pair of sunglasses like
S0208	mm
S0202	yeah i've spend a lot of money of them but it doesn't matter they're a pair of sunglasses you know it's not like it's a sentimental
S0208	but that's what's i mean for me it's like there's no point in me invest so much because they be just a pair of sunglasses
S0202	yeah
S0208	and i only use them in the summer
S0202	mm i love my ray ban though cos i don't often spend a lot of money on myself like clothe and stuff like that i'll go to primark or new look or somewhere cheap
S0208	mm
S0202	i never go to like top shop except for my jeans but i only buy a pair of jeans every six months so like i i didn't mind spend and i'd spend so long save that money to go to with so i just think well do you know what
S0208	yeah
S0202	fuck it
S0208	fair enough that be part of your holiday money part of your treat
S0202	yeah
S0208	cos at the moment i've manage to save up quite a bite this summer i don't know how some miracle erm but every penny of it now be i might go out for another meal or another few drink when i say goodbye to my friends and stuff but i i don't want to spend any more than fifty euros now
S0202	you might have to
S0208	because that's go to be money i'm go to be live off once i pay my rent
S0202	well i've get an idea obviously you've get your save off your grandad which you don't want to dip into except for drive lessons and stuff like that
S0208	yeah
S0202	erm obviously next summer you'll be do internships won't you so it might be worth use that money next summer because you'll not be able to work
S0202	and i don't know if intern pay you
S0208	i be think of use that money i'm go to look into that three week internship
S0202	yeah
S0208	erm obviously if i can do that then i'm go to put my grandad's save towards it
S0202	mm hm
S0208	because they say that like it's unpaid but it's three weeks so i just need three weeks' worth of live cost but they say that they put you up
S0202	oh so you get your accommodation
S0208	yeah so it's just live fee like obviously food travel pay for flight there and back
S0202	yeah
S0208	but obviously i mean if i do get onto the internship like now i can book the flight so far in advance that there won't be a problem
S0202	yeah it depend on what date you go though cos me and book our flight in september for erm june and the day after if we'd have book them the day after they'd add three hundred pound on to each flight so it it doesn't even matter how far in advance you book them really it save you a few hundred quid but it doesn't save you a lot cos it's
S0208	yeah well i'll have a look and then i be speak to my dad and i ask him as a joke completely at first i be like when be you go to hook me up with an internship in your company cos we be talk about i don't know if you be yeah i think you be there actually i don't know
S0202	yeah i be there yeah
S0208	just like just like the rich lifestyle and all that like i don't agree with any of the ethics of work there as an internship
S0202	no but you can work there for a few years make a lot of money and then leave
S0208	exactly and then i can actually have money to go into the stuff that i want like if it's voluntary work obviously it's unpaid
S0202	yeah yeah
S0208	and as a complete joke he be he be like oh do you mean in and i be like oh i be think but work and he be like okay i'll just give my friend a call
S0208	and he literally say it like so matter of factly
S0202	he say something about the un as well
S0208	and i be just like why why the fuck do you not tell me about this sooner cos like i would have be there in a heartbeat
S0202	i don't know if i could live in i don't know maybe it be cos i be a tourist if i live there it would probably be different
S0208	i would love to live there
S0202	but it be just so busy so so busy all the time every hour of the day
S0208	i love that though i've always love it every time i've be but i'd like to go back now that i'm that little bite older
S0202	but i be live out of a suitcase and i be out from eight o'clock in the morning till eleven o'clock twelve o'clock at night so maybe that's why i didn't enjoy it as much as what i should have
S0208	mm yeah
S0202	because we be do we have four five we have five days to do everything so we be out from the crack of dawn till late at night and we be jet lag
S0208	yeah that's what we be like when we be there
S0202	so like i'm just think like maybe that's why i didn't enjoy it whereas if i have my own flat there or something like
S0208	yeah i think that's a thing as well cos you be stay in hotels weren't you
S0202	yeah
S0208	we be stay with our friends like in a flat like we get to see the actual like not the tourist part of it if you know what i mean like we do tourist things obviously
S0202	yeah
S0208	but yeah even if it be another three weeks that would be a six week thing over the summer and i would already have so much experience just from six weeks then if i do a three month pay internship in
S0202	yeah
S0208	cos to be honest i'd rather go somewhere else than if possible or somewhere else than
S0202	yeah you definitely need to do an internship though or or and or a placement year
S0208	a a well i'm hop that i can do a placement in three months rather than a year
S0202	yeah
S0208	erm
S0202	you still go to think about that study abroad thing
S0208	erm i would like to but i didn't get the the grade that i need in first year
S0202	like seriously enquire about that because i didn't get the grade
S0208	well i'm go i'm go to in september i'm go to talk to them and just i'm go to ask what they recommend
S0202	yeah
S0208	like whether i do a three year eh a three month placement in industry like get work experience whether that would be more beneficial for me than do a year abroad study
S0202	mm
S0208	because i don't particularly want to go away for a whole year
S0202	yeah
S0208	and i think i'd benefit more from the situation if i be work rather than just study
S0202	well an internship the placement year you do get pay for that
S0208	mm
S0202	yeah if you do a placement year you get pay for it
S0208	well i'd much rather do that then
S0202	so what you do be you do your first and your second year then you do a placement year then you come back and finish your final year in in seventy percent of people who do an seventy percent of people who've do an internship get a job after uni straight away like as soon as they leave
S0208	cos eh i be when that guy be stay in erm the professor at he be tell me all of the things that be available and he like when i say i be interest in ngos and like voluntary work and stuff he say that be like the boom economy for ngo work
S0202	yeah
S0208	and it's like right on my doorstep
S0202	mm
S0208	and because i already have a little bite of spanish but i also have the french and fluent in english he say that i would probably be right at the top of the list
S0202	yeah
S0208	and i'm study international relations i've sort of get everything go for me
S0202	yeah
S0208	so i be think i'm go to apply for i'm go to talk to my dad about and then i'm go to talk to people at uni on whether or not i could do a three month placement as part of my degree but in
S0202	yeah
S0208	cos if i can do that as part of my course then i won't have to go to in the summer
S0202	yeah
S0208	but if it come to it i can just do another placement during the summer cos we've get three months' worth of summer
S0202	yeah we've get more than that cos our exams finish my last exam be june second that be latest exam so you've get june july august september and then you come back to uni on the first of october
S0208	yeah i mean my last exam be earlier than that as well
S0202	so you get like four months exactly
S0208	it be the end of may
S0202	so if you finish at the end of may you've get five months
S0208	so the one be three weeks in july
S0202	yeah
S0208	i could do from i probably go in june to if possible
S0202	yeah go a bite earlier so it's cheaper
S0208	and then i could i could always do august in if that's not an option on my course or something
S0202	yeah oh do i tell you disney's book
S0208	yeah you tell me
S0202	go in the middle of the fuck summer holiday though cos 's mam be obviously a teacher well
S0208	it's go to be a fuck nightmare
S0202	i know but we're there for fourteen days so
S0208	that's really good
S0202	like we've get a disney pass for the full fourteen days so we don't have to go to disney every single day but like we've get fourteen days to do what we want basically so we can spend like a week in disney then a week as a holiday or whatever
S0208	yeah cos to be honest you'll probably get around everything it's go to be in the middle of summer holiday you probably won't but ah i remember my trip to disneyland it be so special it's like one of my fondest memories
S0202	yeah what in america you go
S0208	no
S0208	we erm it be my eighth birthday we be drive down cos like we do every year we always go down for two weeks like drive down from to we'd usually stay in like the area in the north of

S0202	you've not just stick a piece of paper out of the window have you
S0208	yeah like oh my god
S0208	that's one of my fondest memories of my sister cos never use to come on holiday with us and then when she find out we go to disney she be like typical teenager
S0202	i have to meet
S0208	but do everything with me it be so sweet like she be so much older than me
S0202	yeah but she it be because like she didn't have a relationship with

S0202	like because 's such a bitch basically
S0208	but it be just it be so amaze and i remember i don't remember everything cos i be quite young but i remember what it look like where we be stay i remember always listen to avril lavigne let it go eh let go
S0202	yeah

S0202	i'm a bite gutted though cos like obviously this have happen with and mam want to take us to disney my mam want to be the one that take us so like she's get this with and then like
S0208	well would there be any way would it be at all possible for you to maybe arrange everyone pool some money together and your mam and come with you
S0202	i don't even know if he'll be alive when i go next year it sound awful but i don't know
S0208	or in any case your mam let her be a part of it
S0202	i might have to talk to 's parent cos obviously it's their family holiday that they've invite me on
S0208	yeah
S0202	but like circumstances like i'm sure
S0208	that might be a nice thing to do
S0202	but i might even just like i er it sound awful say this but if and when die i'm go to take her on holiday anyway as soon as all the funeral stuff be over i'm take her on holiday like we're go to go on holiday somewhere just me and her
S0208	yeah that'll be really nice
S0202	like even if it mean like we're go to fuck i don't know or for a week like just in a shitty apartment i just want to get her away you know
S0208	well always welcome to be here even if i'm not here my parent will put you up and that's already rent that you don't have to worry about
S0202	yeah thank you yeah thank you i really appreciate that you my mam and your parent would get on like a house on fire
S0208	they really would
S0202	they really would
S0208	but to be honest that might be a really nice option to do
S0202	yeah
S0208	cos like even if i be still here like even if i'm still at uni and you're take a week off or whatever my parent would still be more than happy to have you here
S0202	yeah yeah
S0208	and then if it's nice weather then you get all the stuff of the pool you're an hour away from mountains if it's the winter or even just to go sightsee like it's so beautiful in the summer
S0202	yeah yeah
S0208	and an hour away from the seaside
S0202	yeah cos i could rent a car or something or borrow one of your mam's and dad's

S0202	wow
S0208	it's so sweet and there's a massive zip wire that go across the lake and if you're big enough i've never be able to reach it but if you're tall enough you can slide backwards and put your hand through the water

S0208	yeah i remember there be a bald guy that always use to be our instructor when we go cos like someone always come up with you
S0202	yeah
S0208	and erm he would he he's so tall that he would always go backwards and put his bald head through the water when he be zip wire

S0202	yeah
S0208	but there's like it's a bite harder
