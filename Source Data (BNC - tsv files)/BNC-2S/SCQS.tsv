S0251	right so we're ready yeah so this'll be fun for the academics i think i'll make a nice change for them we're go to do the oatcake test now so i've get two plat of oatcakes one be the morrisons brand and one be the nairn's brand and then be go to see if he can determine which be which now what do you think about the appearance
S0252	erm well i think one be slightly darker than the other as in er the er type of oats use
S0251	mm
S0252	er the one that be use a darker complexion also a erm have a darker edge
S0251	mm
S0252	that's the other one erm be a lighter colour and a lighter edge in term of roughness they're relatively similar and in term of depth er the lighter one be just very slightly thinner
S0251	okay then right so what about the taste
S0252	right the taste
S0251	do you think it's quite crisp that one
S0252	another the darker one have quite a a crunch
S0251	mm
S0252	erm relatively floury in taste erm er get oat taste and relatively crunchy for an oatcake
S0251	right do you like that one
S0252	erm er er it's not a bad oatcake
S0251	how many mark out of ten would you give it
S0252	er you can see the layer which be
S0251	yes
S0252	a good sign
S0251	yes
S0252	erm the i'd say it's er seven out of ten
S0251	seven out of ten okay
S0252	yes
S0251	now try the next one don't take a really huge bite
S0252	no
S0252	okay
S0251	so how do you find that one
S0252	not as crunchy
S0251	mm
S0252	as the other one
S0251	not as crisp
S0252	that's not quite as floury as the other one
S0251	mm be that a good thing
S0252	in a slightly positive way erm the layer be still relatively well define
S0251	yes
S0252	the it's like a little bite sweeter
S0251	mm
S0252	and that's
S0251	do you prefer it a little bite sweeter
S0252	slightly more oatier
S0251	yes so how many mark out of ten for that one
S0252	er i think that's perhaps more of an eight and a half
S0251	mm so you think that one's a superior product
S0252	i do
S0251	so which one do you think be the morrisons one and which one do you think be the nairn's
S0252	i think the darker one be the morrisons one
S0251	yes
S0252	and i think the lighter one be the nairn's
S0251	alright so let's turn the plat over that's the nairn's
S0252	nairn's be the dark one and morrisons
S0251	that's the morrisons one
S0252	be the lighter
S0251	so be you right
S0252	no
S0251	no so be you go to review your buy policy
S0251	be you surprise
S0252	i be a little bite surprise er i'd say
S0251	do you think the label be on the wrong dish
S0252	er
S0251	always a possibility
S0252	yes yeah well i must admit i'm the ones that i've see of nairn's in the past have they look more like that
S0251	yes
S0252	than that one
S0251	it could be just a dark batch do you think
S0252	mm it could be a one off
S0251	quite a good snap
S0252	yes
S0251	mm that's good interest so do you recognise your regular brand
S0252	seemingly not
S0251	when we be small me and my sister we use to go to my uncle and auntie's on a box day
S0252	yes
S0251	my uncle use to do what be call the smartie test
S0252	mm
S0251	and we use to blindfold him and then we use to fee him smarties and he reckon that he could detect which be the orange smartie because in those days all the smarties have milk chocolate in the middle but the one that be orange have orange flavour chocolate in
S0252	oh
S0251	you know like a terry's chocolate orange sort of taste
S0252	oh right
S0251	so we use to fee him the smarties and he use to have to have a little sip of sherry in between each one just to cleanse the palate you know
S0252	mm
S0251	well it be christmas wasn't it and er we use to think that be great fun so we didn't know how happy we be you don't get uncles like that any more do you
S0252	not in
S0251	no
S0252	not really
S0251	no i don't think you've have an uncle like that have you
S0252	no
S0251	we be quite lucky with uncles in those days
S0251	mm and we have another uncle like that he take us to the zoo and erm i have this packet of ginger biscuits and we be feed them to the elephants and i never know that elephants really like ginger biscuits
S0251	but they do
S0252	i don't think you'd get away with that nowadays
S0251	probably not it would say do not fee the animals
S0251	health and safety regulations
S0252	and what do you think er
S0251	and you
S0252	be the big attraction for the elephants to have the ginger biscuit
S0251	i don't know they'd probably get feed up of his normal i don't know what elephants normally eat
S0252	mm
S0251	what do they eat
S0252	bamboo stick
S0251	that's pandas isn't it so probably a nice change to get something sweet
S0252	mm
S0251	and erm i hear it say that the way to have a happy and fulfil life apart from have uncles that do a smartie test and let you fee ginger biscuits to elephants be to plant a tree
S0252	mm
S0251	to have a son and to write a book so we how many tree have you plant
S0252	i've plant five tree i've plant an apple tree a plum tree erm a pear tree er a cherry tree and er another apple so that's one dessert apple and one cook apple
S0251	mm and have they bring you happiness
S0252	er no i don't really in some ways it's er the performance with tree be erm very vary erm think one delight that be more or less guarantee every year be that erm the tree blossom which er
S0251	yeah
S0252	they have very delicate and intricate flower
S0251	yeah they're beautiful aren't they
S0252	but er in term of fruit it's a bite less predictable
S0251	mm
S0252	er perhaps so far as the say you can't count chickens until the egg have hatch
S0251	that's right
S0252	erm that er frost and disease and pest attack
S0251	yeah
S0252	can affect the crop
S0251	yeah
S0252	once the er blossom have set so
S0251	i think once you get the blossom they be quite vulnerable aren't they
S0252	mm
S0251	and although they have a lot of blossom on all of the tree
S0252	yes
S0251	the pear for instance i think
S0252	i think two
S0251	i think there's only about two pears
S0252	yes
S0251	and i don't mean four i mean four i mean two
S0252	mm
S0251	pears
S0252	yes
S0251	not bad on the plums have quite a lot of plums this year
S0252	yes yes
S0251	we've make plum jam
S0252	yes
S0251	and plum chutney and i've be able to put lot of plums in the freezer for crumble and things
S0252	mm
S0251	in the winter
S0252	yes
S0251	so i think they've be quite a joy don't you
S0252	yes
S0251	and pick the apples climb up the ladder and get all the best ones which be always at the top aren't they
S0252	yes and the erm extender the like a net on a pole be quite a good buy
S0251	yeah that's be really invaluable hasn't it
S0252	but i'm very tall so that help
S0251	true i've also have quite a good harvest of brambles
S0252	yes it's be a bite of a surprise that have
S0251	i think the good thing about brambles be they're not hard to grow
S0252	they're not hard to grow
S0251	they're more or less a weed i think
S0252	but they be expensive to buy
S0251	they be expensive they be very dear
S0252	yes so say compare to an apple or a
S0251	mm
S0252	plum
S0251	yeah
S0252	which maybe twenty or thirty pence each a punnet of blackberry could easily be two or three pound
S0251	yeah and pick about two ice cream box of brambles this year haven't we
S0252	yes
S0251	i think we've do well and there's still some to pick aren't there cos some
S0252	mm
S0251	be not quite ripe yet
S0252	yes
S0251	so there's
S0252	yeah
S0251	some more to pick for next week
S0252	i'd say because it's on a a little bite of a slope
S0251	mm
S0252	they're gonna like that because
S0251	mm well drain
S0252	this should be well they'll be well drain
S0251	yes
S0252	and they're as well
S0251	mm i think it's probably quite an old say because i think it will be consider a bite unfair to say that just a son will make you happy and fulfil i think any child really have potential
S0252	mm that's
S0251	whether it's a boy or a girl but i think it's a bite like the christmas carol it's all your hop and all your fear when you have your baby and watch them grow up cos somehow it's more heighten the sensation for instance when you've be do your exams i've be much more perplex and really felt for you more so than when i do them myself i think you take it more in my stride i think
S0252	yes
S0251	but er it seem more important when it's your own child i think and really it's your life's work watch your child grow up and it's all your effort try to make it right and try to make it erm better than it be for you and make you
S0252	yes
S0251	more successful and that you erm get the benefit of what i've learn
S0252	mm
S0251	and my education so that you know the benefit trickle down the generations
S0252	yes i think perhaps book be a bite more of a a tricky aspect i suppose one thing be erm everyone well most people would have the ability to be able to write a book but it's
S0251	well i don't know
S0252	but it's it's quite another thing get it publish and
S0251	true
S0252	into a a shop
S0251	yes well we've get quite a few stories that we've write down haven't we
S0252	yes
S0251	but just because we haven't get them publish it just mean that they're go to be within the family aren't they so
S0252	mm yeah
S0251	in some ways it sort of keep it private doesn't it and they're our special stories
S0252	yes certainly
S0251	that we'll still have to share won't we you think what there be the common factor between all those things be that it's something that be go to live after you've go it's like a little bite of a legacy
S0252	mm
S0251	the trees'll be still there for some time
S0252	yes
S0251	after we've all grow old and your children be there mostly unless there's an accident after you've go and your work really what you've write could be i suppose these days people write blog don't they
S0252	mm
S0251	erm i suppose in the old days you use to write a diary
S0252	yes
S0251	and they be mean to be private they be often sell with a little key or a little padlock on
S0252	yes
S0251	because they be private and secret and confidential but nowadays people seem to put the blog on the internet
S0252	yeah
S0251	for everybody to share and everybody to read
S0252	yes
S0251	i don't know there seem to be a difference in attitude doesn't there about whether it's
S0252	yes
S0251	private or whether it's something that you're go to share with anybody who care to read your diary
S0252	i think there be a number of downsides to that be that people be post things every twenty minutes or
S0251	yes
S0252	every hour or something that when if you meet that person erm face to face you you don't actually have anything to discuss
S0251	new to say well you could talk about what they've already say
S0252	yes but then
S0251	in the diary but there isn't any news be there
S0252	it's nothing
S0251	no there isn't anything new to tell you cos you already know it all
S0252	mm
S0251	and another thing be that things might be say that you wish you hadn't say
S0252	i know
S0251	that you want to change and there's this controversy about whether you can hide things that have be put on the internet for instance
S0252	yes
S0251	retract them but i don't know that it's possible be it
S0252	well i think er the european union er the court rule have erm try make it possible for people to block er result from when you search their own name erm in the key search engines
S0251	right i believe that people who be look to recruit or employ people for job can check facebook account
S0252	yes
S0251	and things see if there's any silly photograph or compromise
S0252	yes
S0251	photograph and so on that they probably wish they hadn't put on
S0252	mm mm
S0251	if they're apply for a serious job
S0252	yeah
S0251	i don't think it would really help you
S0252	no so at least one advantage of not have a facebook account
S0251	yes i don't think it's something that really appeal to me i think if i want to tell a friend something or if i want to tell my family something then i'd rather meet them and tell them personally
S0252	mm
S0251	or tell them over the telephone rather than just put it out there and then you have to er look on the facebook account if you find out if i've get any news to tell you
S0252	yes but er some might say it's a way of keep in contact with perhaps your extend family or friends
S0251	yes
S0252	that you haven't meet for a long time
S0251	yes or maybe some people be be more private than others
S0252	unless i suppose it's because it's a reflection of individual personalities
S0251	yes yes mm
S0252	one thing that really i've not do er for i don't think we've ever do it be make marmalade with them whilst we've make chutney and we've make
S0251	true
S0252	er jam but no
S0251	and lemon curd
S0252	and lemon curd
S0251	i love your lemon curd you have to have that or it wouldn't be a real christmas would it
S0251	if you didn't have lemon curd tarts
S0252	yeah
S0251	mince pies but grandma make it doesn't she
S0252	she do
S0251	both grandmas actually
S0252	yes
S0251	have make it
S0252	they have
S0251	but it think it's become something that be be consume mainly by the older generation
S0252	yeah
S0251	the grandma generation
S0252	yeah
S0251	we don't really have it
S0252	no
S0251	apart from at christmas
S0252	yeah
S0251	but that's when we have the grandparents visit
S0252	yeah
S0251	but we do eat it then don't we
S0252	yeah erm
S0251	i don't dislike it
S0252	no
S0251	but we don't really have it
S0252	no
S0251	during the year somehow
S0252	also erm i sometimes use it in my ginger parkin recipe
S0251	yes that's true
S0252	that's
S0251	yes when we make that at halloween time
S0252	yes
S0251	with a spoonful of marmalade can help you make it nice and moist can't it
S0252	yes be there any other er condiments or preserve that you would ever consider make
S0251	erm well we've make two jam haven't we raspberry jam cos we go raspberry pick didn't we
S0252	yes
S0251	and the plum jam which we make as the kind of it's suppose to be christmas in a jar jam plums er orange juice and orange rind spice like cinnamon and some port i think that be really nice
S0252	yes
S0251	and it's very good for them cold winter mornings isn't it to have toast and that jam and the lemon curd i'm not really think of any more cos i don't think we could eat much more jam really
S0252	mm
S0251	the next thing i'll be think about make be erm christmas puddings
S0252	yeah
S0251	and then we're go to make the christmas cake maybe september october time
S0252	yes
S0251	to give them plenty of time to mature ready for christmas
S0252	mm
S0251	and then keep feed them with brandy put the little hole in the bottom and
S0252	yes
S0251	feed them up so they're nice and moist
S0252	yes
S0251	i think we've have quite a good success on that
S0252	mm
S0251	and it's a little tradition that we've build up together isn't it
S0252	mm the one thing we have yet to do be to erm get a a mixer that
S0251	yes
S0252	be fully capable of er
S0251	well
S0252	meet the er demand requirements at this time of year
S0251	quite i think the food mixer we've get be really past its best isn't it
S0252	it be
S0251	it's on its last legs and
S0252	it's make a lot of noise and i think the
S0251	it's make a lot of noise and
S0252	er the motor be not quite catch be they
S0251	mm yeah no they're not and there's a bite of a strange rubbery smell when it er
S0252	mm yeah
S0251	it's be run for some time so
S0252	yeah so be you plan to get a another hand mixer or be you think about more like a a chef's mixer with a
S0251	mm
S0252	a bite of a large bowl and spin
S0251	yeah i would like that because i think it will be easier for me because i find it quite heavy now do the mix there
S0252	yes
S0251	especially if it's butter as oppose to margarine it's quite stiff to get it erm nice and soft so if you have a mixer with the stand i think that will be easier
S0252	yes
S0251	but the downside be they be quite a lot more expensive
S0252	they be
S0251	aren't they
S0252	yes
S0251	so we'd have to do a bite of research i think erm and see if we could find one at a good price maybe if
S0252	yes
S0251	john lewis have a sale or something
S0252	yes
S0251	we could er get one there that would be suitable
S0252	yes but by the look of it a suitable replacement do need to be find within the next
S0251	yeah
S0252	three weeks perhaps
S0251	true because we need to get these christmas cake start and
S0252	yes
S0251	yeah i know
S0252	yes
S0251	i don't know what we'll do
