S0247	okay we've try to learn spanish now for
S0248	how long ago do you think how long
S0247	well it's over ten years isn't it
S0248	really i don't really i know it's not a consistent thing we've do be it you have more than me but it's it i don't really seem to be any further forward
S0247	well i'm sure we be a little but then
S0248	don't think i be
S0247	we first start erm go to spanish class when we be go to go to argentina for a holiday
S0248	and that be two thousand and five wasn't it
S0247	two thousand and three
S0248	wasn't it so it's over ten years
S0247	mm yeah it's over ten years
S0248	oh
S0247	mm but of the different ways because we start off with erm even class
S0248	yeah
S0247	and then we've do things like listen to cassettes and the michel thomas cds
S0248	i have those michel thomas things where you
S0247	yeah
S0248	just have to er listen to some text listen to some word with baroque music play in the background
S0247	oh that be ridiculous wasn't it yeah
S0248	not try and actually make any attempt to actually remember it
S0247	yes
S0248	but just supposedly you be mean to walk wake up in the morning
S0247	and it be there
S0248	and you just know it
S0247	yes
S0248	you be just like a native
S0247	and do you remember that tape you have where the erm they say it they read something out in a normal voice and there be a whisper voice as well
S0248	no i don't remember that be another idea be it
S0247	it's the it be another idea it sort of play the music and it it tell the story of erm of adele and peter and yeah
S0248	oh i remember adele and peter yes
S0247	and in guadalajara in mexico
S0248	i do remember it very well
S0247	and then you have a track where it just play the music and somebody be whisper in the background
S0248	yes i do i do remember it
S0247	the spanish and that the idea of that be that it would stick in your mind but
S0248	yeah
S0247	i'm not sure
S0248	yeah well it certainly i their name have stick in my mind i remember their name
S0248	what they say
S0247	mm
S0248	i really have no idea
S0247	no
S0248	they be quite fond peter be quite fond of adele i remember
S0247	yes he he do quite fancy her didn't he
S0248	yeah i think in in the end he
S0247	yeah
S0248	yeah
S0247	yeah
S0248	that's all he really care about be
S0247	yes
S0248	get off with adele more than learn spanish i feel
S0247	mm
S0248	although he probably have to do one to achieve the other
S0247	i think he already speak spanish
S0248	do he
S0247	yes
S0248	he just pretend he didn't
S0247	no no i think you're get two things mix up
S0247	you're get the michel thomas cds mix up with the peter and adele story
S0248	yeah you always have one person who get it right in those things and one person who's a who's a bite of a duffer
S0247	mm yes one one get it right and one get it wrong yeah yeah but erm go to class do you you only really do that one that we do with erm in didn't you
S0248	yeah
S0247	i've do some additional ones i take
S0248	you go to the erm institute didn't you in
S0247	yeah but i also do another night class in erm
S0248	i don't remember that
S0247	well you didn't go i go on my own
S0248	where be it
S0247	in in er school
S0248	oh
S0247	but she be hopeless that teacher a really really bad teacher
S0248	okay
S0247	yeah
S0248	blame the teacher
S0247	well i do blame the teacher it's because in a in a in an even class of two hours erm we hardly speak the the only time we ever speak be to read you know she might say will you read out number three you know and i would read out number three and then you know will you read out number four
S0248	it's no good be it it's really no good
S0247	we we didn't ever speak in any spanish and the teacher speak english erm a good ninety per cent of the time so everything she do be in english and although i think when you're learn the basics you need to learn in your your own language but you know they need to be rehearse the the language that you know so i i be very disappoint with that teacher
S0248	you do i mean some people be obviously far better than others at learn languages
S0247	mm
S0248	and we do all know the optimum way to learn it be to learn it when you're young and you know you you you you and so
S0247	yeah but you can't be young if you're not young can you
S0248	but i mean
S0247	mm
S0248	we've actually try different methods of learn er obviously you've gotta learn the grammar but then you you know you probably gotta be around people where spanish be speak
S0247	mm
S0248	otherwise you just don't really have the have the confidence to to carry on with it or the you know the
S0247	mm and it always get better when we go on holiday to spain doesn't it so if we have a week in spain by the end of the week you know we know more we feel more confident we recognise more yeah
S0248	erm when we go to i be i remember speak to people not not you know but really try and
S0247	mm
S0248	really feel slightly i be get somewhere
S0247	yes
S0248	but i don't seem to have carry on with i mean that's totally my own fault
S0247	mm
S0248	but it just seem a bite unachievable to me so and the older i get i i don't mind you know we both say we can look at a new a fairly er you know a newspaper or certainly a comic and understand most of the you know of what it's on about
S0247	mm mm
S0248	but do i actually have to be able to to speak it erm you can ask question at people but to actually hold a conversation with people just personally seem to be a bite beyond me apart from
S0247	mm i think we could
S0248	very basic things
S0247	mm yes i mean i do think we could get there and you start with the basics don't you so you go into shop and order stuff and you you know can ask for a meal and you can even you know elaborate on what you do and don't want and complain and book hotel room so it all start from there really doesn't it and then you build it up
S0248	i can't get away from the fact that you sort of have an english phrase and you sort of translate it literally from the english word
S0247	mm
S0248	and and you know it might not really make any sense
S0247	well it won't will it
S0248	you can't actually obviously don't know it it's
S0247	yeah
S0248	an obvious fact
S0247	yes mm
S0248	but the fact be you have to totally you know for the most part
S0247	mm mm
S0248	you have to learn a whole new way of not only
S0247	yeah
S0248	different
S0247	yeah
S0248	word you have er er learn a whole new way of say things
S0247	yes but it's but but some some of it erm you do without think so for example in spanish if you put the adjective after the noun you know if you say you don't think anything of that you don't think oh why be i say shirt black instead of black shirt
S0248	no
S0247	do you you just accept it so it's it's only an extension of that that you naturally need to let your brain develop these different pattern
S0248	i mean it's obvious that we've if we be really serious about it we've get to at least have a lot of tape record of you know constantly
S0247	mm mm
S0248	whether you're answer them back or not that would be better obviously
S0247	yeah
S0248	but at least have you know the spanish language play in your ear to actually get use to the speed of it
S0247	i think so yeah yeah
S0248	and and because you just hear i hear spanish people speak now and you know sometimes unless you know you might be a number or a colour or a name basically i can't really understand anything they've say
S0247	no but we've have this conversation before haven't we that do get better
S0248	mm
S0247	you you might not understand what they're say but erm you need to be able to recognise where the word be start and end and stuff like that which when you don't understand anything it's just a a stream of gibberish so if we hear a japanese person speak you know we wouldn't recognise anything at all would we not even the pause in between sentence
S0248	no
S0247	but with spanish we should be at least identify occasional word
S0247	and get use to the pattern of where they stop and start
S0248	no yeah
S0247	i mean i think that do get better definitely
S0248	well it must do hopefully you know if you if you persist with it i mean it we always use to laugh about them we've say it so often but er the fact be that we both neither of us we both take french for four or five i be never particularly good at learn french i again be
S0247	mm
S0248	okay with the with the the to write it down but no good at speak it but as soon as you try and learn spanish word all this french come into your head
S0247	yeah it's very funny that isn't it yeah yes
S0248	well it's really really odd
S0247	yeah yeah but i've
S0247	i've hear that so many time
S0248	yeah
S0247	since from other people about other languages yeah
S0248	but it's it's a say it's a it's a truism isn't it
S0247	yeah but it just show you that your brain be able to sort of switch throw a switch between languages so it's get a
S0247	english language and then at the moment it's get everything else hasn't it so
S0248	we shouldn't we can be the wrong switch though
S0247	yeah
S0248	no idea
S0247	i be talk to a girl a couple of weeks ago who speak four or five different languages
S0248	i can't imagine how people can do that
S0247	well two of them she be she be raise with but with bilingual parent and i can't remember what the languages be but let's say she speak german and italian from be a child and and then she additionally be er in to learn or to improve her english and er she also speak french which she be do at school erm and i say that to her about you know doesn't it become a jumble and she say yeah it do sometimes that you know when she's search for the right word you know and she can't think of the right word you know in any language so her brain'll throw up whatever it can think of and also who er obviously be very good in english now at i mean advance level english and speak the the two variations of spanish both erm catalan and castilian
S0248	do he
S0247	oh yeah cos he's
S0248	what
S0247	he's from so his
S0248	yeah i know that
S0247	his first language be
S0248	well why would he speak castilian then
S0247	well it's it's because catalan be the minority language
S0248	mm
S0247	and castilian be sort of like the official spanish language so all people who live in catalonia erm you know the the same as people live in the basque country speak in basque you know they all speak their first language catalonian basque whatever and then additionally they'll speak castilian because that's the language of the government and the you know all that and
S0248	and yeah i mean i suppose it's
S0247	but he say that sometimes when he speak to his mum on the phone erm he can't remember the word in you know he he he's he'll remember the english word for something it would need to be an obscure word
S0248	mm yeah yeah
S0247	you know but he can't remember the right word in in erm catalan or castilian but he can sometimes remember it in english you know so that's a weird thing isn't it
S0248	mm it be it be no i didn't know and i do you know i'm not sure it really apply someone like 's dad or 's mum or mum and dad
S0247	mm mm
S0248	if they really be catalan speakers i'm not sure they can all speak castilian you know but i suppose a lot of them can especially
S0247	yeah
S0248	the younger ones it they would
S0247	yeah
S0248	i don't mean
S0247	mm mm
S0248	i don't i don't think that you know you say that all dutch people speak english if you ever meet any old dutch people they don't speak english
S0247	okay so let's take a an example nearer to home then if you go to ireland
S0248	mm mm
S0247	erm the the you could probably find a a handful of people who only speak gaelic and don't speak english
S0248	mm
S0247	but everybody else that live there all the four million people or whatever who live in ireland who speak gaelic and not all of them do but the ones who do speak gaelic also speak english
S0248	that's true but a lot of them only speak well as you say there's not many gaelic speakers alone but there'll be a lot of people who don't have don't speak gaelic at all
S0247	yeah but the but it's it's it's not that you know it i mean it's
S0248	mm
S0247	i dunno what the proportion be i don't know the number alright what about even nearer to home wales
S0248	yeah well it's it's only
S0247	they're all teach it in school welsh
S0248	they they be but they stop teach it for a for a for a number of years and so one time there's still a lot of you know people who never learn it all really
S0247	no but we're not say you're tackle this from the wrong way round we're say that people who know the minority language would also know the majority language
S0248	mm
S0247	so in the case of catalonia
S0248	mm
S0247	catalonians would also know spanish
S0248	mm
S0247	you know gaelic speakers would also know english welsh speakers would also know english you be say that it you think in catalonia that you would get people who only speak catalonian you know and didn't speak spanish and that that would be a sizeable proportion
S0248	i would've still think there would be fair number of people
S0247	well you'll have to google it cos i think you're wrong
S0248	yeah mm i mean how different be they
S0247	erm
S0248	do it say
S0247	they're they're not they they be different
S0248	mm
S0247	but they be there be a lot of similarities
S0248	mm
S0247	and often he'll tell me a word he'll say this be erm the word for this be so and so and then he'll say oh hang on a minute no that's the catalan word the spanish word be and it and it'll be something similar yeah
S0248	but the basque language be really totally different
S0247	basque be completely different
S0248	yeah
S0247	yeah they
S0248	i mean
S0247	well we we we
S0248	you know just look totally different a load of what be it a load of ks
S0247	ks and xs and yeah
S0248	a load of ks load of xs yeah
S0247	yeah yeah
S0248	and and er the place we stay in start
S0247	mm
S0248	start and end with z
S0247	yeah
S0248	you know you just
S0247	which be place be that with a z
S0248	we stay in
S0247	it didn't start with a z do oh oh it do didn't it
S0248	yeah
S0247	yeah yes
S0248	start and end
S0247	yeah
S0248	with a z
S0247	yeah well no that be a weird place wasn't it
S0248	mm mm
S0247	they they they tell us that the language be unrelated to anything else wasn't it
S0248	think they say it be the they find some root in what be it polish or
S0247	some somewhere
S0248	but it's somewhere completely different
S0247	yeah
S0248	not
S0247	yeah
S0248	not not mediterranean at all
S0247	no that would be worth have a look for actually
S0248	yeah yeah
S0247	yeah
S0247	but no but i suppose we just have to keep on don't we really just i mean look we i don't look at my note i don't practice enough you know i we say we be well i say we be gonna have a song a week
S0248	a song a week
S0247	every week we'd have a a spanish song and we'd have the lyric and we'd practice and we didn't even do it once do we and i type things into a i've get a program call anki which be for erm vocabulary and for enthusiastically i type you know for several week but i didn't i stop do that i think it's quite difficult to to persevere really and we can't we haven't even get the excuse that we haven't get time
S0248	i have no excuse at all
S0248	once every er once every month or so and really quite much more regularly than that lately i've be think well i i need some sort of project and i can't really think you know i don't really like make corn dollies so i i er i think i'll learn spanish
S0247	well and now you're think that corn dollies might be quite a
S0248	i'm think of go into corn dolly work now actually i think it better i've just gotta go and go and get myself some corn
S0247	yeah
S0248	get a big batch arrive tomorrow
S0247	you could erm make some model aeroplanes
S0248	why be i er why model let me make some dollies anyway no i've be tell myself come on learn spanish but i can't get down to it
S0247	mm
S0248	and i'm not a particularly you know i like read er you know i i don't want to just but i i find it very hard to
S0247	yeah
S0248	actually think when i i i just bother me somewhat about i'm just gonna forget this or i'm not really gonna use it
S0247	mm
S0248	i know i know there's you know the the prize the benefit be of of be just learn and know you've achieve it if if if you can do it
S0247	oh absolutely yeah
S0248	i know that it's the the the sense of accomplishment be be the be the major thing but i can't imagine myself get to that point i think it's almost you know we all know that we'd love to play a musical instrument we will know how beneficial it would be but really we know how difficult it be you know for us anyway
S0247	mm
S0248	and we're not like this in everything we're quite good i'm quite good at crosswords and things like this which you you which i improve at but when i've try to learn a musical instrument i i i don't feel any improvement how ever hard i try
S0247	mm
S0248	every time i pick up the guitar or what have you it's like the first time i ever pick it up
S0247	yeah
S0248	you know i've see some people try and learn gold and and and they're just utterly useless
S0248	and they play for a time and they might miss it less less often than they use to but this you know they don't really ever really
S0247	mm mm
S0248	go anywhere it's the older people young
S0247	yeah
S0248	young ones
S0247	mm mm
S0248	always
S0247	yeah
S0248	pick it up to a degree
S0247	mm mm but i i still think it's worth persevere with the spanish maybe in september we ought to join another night class
S0248	ah dear just you you gonna you have a i don't what what how it work if it you know whether i say something and it say it back to me or you say it be quite a good site be this the one you've already be talk about
S0247	no that's a program anki the site be
S0248	be that the one that be on about
S0247	no that's something else erm
S0248	the the who a friend of his use to work on it or something
S0247	yes that's that's call readlang which
S0248	yeah
S0247	be a it's well actually it's quite good because if you install it it enable you to click on any spanish and up pop the translation
S0248	oh well yeah there's
S0247	yeah
S0248	quite a few of those i think some be better than others obviously
S0247	and the and then the er software remember the word you've click on so later on it'll say do you remember you know
S0248	okay yeah yeah
S0247	and so it it help by recycle them so it's that be probably quite
S0248	mm
S0247	worth have a look at but the one i be go to show you be just the bbc's erm spanish learn site have you see that
S0248	mm mm no i don't think i have
S0247	okay well we'll have a look at that this afternoon if you like
S0248	okay
S0247	yeah
S0248	okay
S0247	okay alright then will that do us for now do you think
S0248	yes yes we do
