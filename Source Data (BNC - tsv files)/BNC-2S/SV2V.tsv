S0041	mm those shoe under there
S0084	i know feel like he's just actually move in
S0041	mm i mean they're not even by the front door
S0084	i know huh urgh just rot foot
S0084	there's toe jam in there
S0041	oh no
S0084	so sorry sorry sorry
S0084	oh
S0084	it's a good one for the tape
S0084	toe what
S0041	he must've go to his mum's then
S0084	yeah i remember him say he want to cycle over and stay the night so he would've cycle over he be cycle to cos say he'd it use to take him just over an hour something like that i dunno which roads you'd go down though that's the thing it's probably take longer because he can't go on the main roads
S0041	i don't even know where be
S0084	no er it's over there
S0084	just like my geography of the north be everything be together up from er here as we discuss
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	everything be on top of each other about there
S0041	yep i be tell about that
S0084	oh god
S0041	and i say to be fair everything from here downwards be london
S0041	so
S0084	fair i think
S0041	all of it
S0084	i think unless you go to these place you have no er i mean even i've be to and i've actually be to these
S0041	mm
S0084	place
S0084	i've be to and i've i couldn't tell you where they be i be er think
S0041	mm
S0084	actually if you go there you know er you know where you be but no i've no idea i just get on a train
S0041	oh yeah i think if you drive it you'd probably have move of an idea
S0084	yeah well that's the thing well i be talk to someone about this about have a sit nav and i be say oh it's so good when i drive to like i know the roads pretty er pretty well from have be with other people up and down
S0041	mm
S0084	between and or and but i'd never drive it myself and it be really easy someone else be say well actually she try not to use a sit nav cos then she lose any understand of where she be like if it break
S0041	mm
S0084	something go wrong you'd have no clue cos you're you're so dependent on it
S0041	yeah definitely
S0084	i suppose that's that be the danger i i have the sit nav on my phone when i drive to last week and i have no idea like if it's east west north south
S0041	no
S0084	not a clue
S0041	it's the same way as if you never walk through you only get the tube
S0084	mm
S0041	no idea where anything be
S0084	yeah absolutely and that's the thing i mean er i think it's probably just the tourists who end up do that because people who actually who know the city know that there's stop in between and that in the middle be all so close together that you can quite easily walk between them
S0041	mhm
S0084	and it really help with join the dot i think i didn't really get to know until i do that till i
S0041	mm
S0084	till i walk through and i'd have to go and meet my dad somewhere cos my dad work in the city for years and obviously he's a boy
S0041	oh
S0084	through and through anyway so when i be go home from to i'd always stop off and i'd meet him at we'd go for a little wander and
S0041	mm
S0084	then he'd put me on the train from er i think or so we'd do quite a lot of walk which help
S0041	i can't remember where i've walk to now i always make a point of walk if it's an option
S0084	mm
S0041	but i what be that
S0084	that's the freezer i think
S0041	yep
S0084	don't know don't know if that really help
S0041	i think he want to talk
S0084	i think it want to take off
S0084	i think there might be alien life form live in there in fact there probably be i doubt that's be um defrost for years
S0041	ever
S0084	cos you can barely get anything in it i think it's only that use it
S0041	that's really concern ain't it do you think it's gonna explode in the night
S0084	well so long as um we no no one's here do it normally make that noise and be it the freezer or the fridge could we go in your room cos i'm scar that the freezer's gonna explode
S0041	yes yes
S0084	i don't want to be in here when the freezer explode just if if in doubt we didn't touch the freezer

S0084	men talk about themselves
S0041	so i tell her about the book of course
S0084	mm
S0041	and um that now we've get wizards i i play live wizard to add to that do you er what the hell happen with that

S0084	um he do carry on texting me and he texted me er to which i didn't reply and he basically just say oh i hope your phone's okay and i be just like yeah mm goodbye and he say well be that a bail out and i didn't reply and then he texted me on friday morning say be that you i be follow all the way home if it wasn't you've get a double to which i didn't reply because i be like well you haven't tell me where you be so i don't know and if you think it be me why the hell do you follow me and how far be you follow me
S0041	yeah
S0084	or some poor other girl that you've be follow and i didn't wanna encourage him so i delete it
S0041	yeah

S0041	what do the girls say
S0084	tut oh well they just say they think it would be a really good idea they think we'd get on really well they didn't they don't even really know him that er be what really piss me off they've meet him in the bar out like at work and er
S0041	so basically
S0084	they've get chat to him
S0041	they know him a little bite
S0084	yeah think what the hell
S0041	and er and think what the hell he seem nice
S0084	er he well he'd ask for my number and they be the so that's when they er the er bright spark think it up the thing be
S0041	the genius come into play
S0084	because with and 's always say this she's always say tut well she's too nice to say i don't trust her but she's whenever i talk about her she's always like that she's a bite crazy isn't she but like it make me think cos i trust 's opinion above a lot even though we've only know each other a couple of years like you know when people come into your life and you just feel like they get you
S0041	they'll only tell you the truth
S0084	they really understand
S0041	yeah
S0084	yeah and and you're so similar and you're you know you've just make a friend for life and um with her i really feel that and i really value her and not that i would not be friends with someone that she didn't like because er you you know
S0041	mm
S0084	you're your own person and you can make decisions for yourself but you'd certainly take it in as a factor and
S0041	yeah if she doesn't like them there's a reason why
S0084	it make me question the friendship and it doesn't make me stop be friends with her with but it do make me think well what be it that she that doesn't trust or doesn't like
S0041	yeah
S0084	and so i do i've always keep at arm's length mainly because the first time we go out drink together when i'd only work for the company a couple of months and we hadn't really work together at the time and er we go out drink and i be say to her oh i really like this guy in the office and she be like oh yeah er like load of girls really fancy him he's really nice isn't he and really cute and i be like yeah he's really cute know that he would be there at the pub later
S0041	mm
S0084	so we all proceed to get absolutely smash this be in a er salisbury arm off mill road
S0041	yep
S0084	and er lot and lot of booze later we're in
S0041	yep
S0084	some time in the morning
S0041	that's the place that stay open till like
S0084	all night
S0041	yeah
S0084	yeah till the last person leave
S0041	leave yeah yeah yeah
S0084	which could be like monday morning
S0041	yep
S0084	um and at the time it be christmas and i be work at on the saturday this be friday night i be work at at nine a m on the saturday morning it be some ridiculous hour of the morning all of us really drink and i turn over be sit in 's lap er in the in the pub now i think that have a bite of a thing for her cos er she's really pretty and er all lot of boys like her but obviously we'd have a conversation she'd never express to me oh yeah well i quite like him too or there's something go on or whatever there'd be no
S0041	yeah
S0084	conversation
S0041	yeah
S0084	nothing offer but she do know that i really like him and even during that night she be like why don't you you know i'll er leave you two to it or well something er er
S0041	like encourage this
S0084	yeah and i just think you know you're not in the playground you're not i saw him first he's mine
S0041	yeah
S0084	but a bite of like a bite of tact
S0041	yeah
S0084	i know you're fuck and i know we're all so piss but from that point on
S0041	mm
S0084	i do think
S0041	no
S0084	um this be a bite weird
S0041	yep
S0041	i think that's a bite weird
S0084	so i like the girl but i have always have my reservations and she she and helen live together and er they when i first move in here and i wasn't sure about it and i be definitely wasn't sure about trudy i be look around and the girls say well we might be move out so do you wanna move in with us like find a three bed place
S0041	yep
S0084	and i think even though i like them i've live with live as one of three girls before and the two girls fell out and i be piggy in the middle and it be horrendous fff and i just didn't want that to happen again and also er just i'm just not sure
S0041	mm
S0084	they're very very close and you'd be the person come in and you might disturb that
S0041	yeah and i always think as well if you work them
S0084	yeah
S0041	and you go home with them that could get really too much like
S0084	tut mm
S0041	i do it with for three months solid and we both say like we really live in each other's pocket it be so difficult because we be work all day while i be her manager
S0084	mm
S0041	and there be only sometimes there be just the two of us so sometimes she really have to take direct order
S0084	yeah
S0041	and i have to tell her off and stuff and we take her on know that if she be gonna get fire i be gonna have to fire her
S0084	yeah
S0041	so that be quite stretch sometimes especially if she she make a mistake or not just a normal error but if something be serious
S0084	mm
S0041	um but we manage it fine completely fine to the point where the md be like a bite worry about say something to her and i be like why well i know that she's your friend and i be like bullshit
S0084	mm
S0041	we both have make such a point to keep it so professional
S0084	mm
S0041	there's no way you could've pull that string i be like absolute bullshit
S0084	mm
S0041	cos our desks be join onto his
S0084	mm
S0041	cos we have a separate office to everyone else
S0084	oh okay
S0041	and so it be blatant lie he be he be just be a coward
S0084	mm
S0041	and then we be live in monday to friday
S0084	mm
S0041	literally a pull up bed and an air bed in the live room of a three bed flat cos we didn't want to heat up the whole place cos it would've be freeze the whole time cos it be middle of winter it be snow on the grind live on like salad and bean eat nothing
S0084	mm
S0041	cos we be slimming and then drive home at the weekend which she be then share with me and which be rocky
S0084	mm
S0041	so it be really the most stressful
S0084	mm
S0041	possible situation imaginable
S0084	mm
S0041	and we be with each other twenty four seven and we still didn't fall out
S0084	yeah that's a real test of the friendship definitely
S0041	and i say to like how much more stressful could this be
S0084	mm
S0041	really and we're still not fall out and get angry with each other
S0084	mm
S0041	and not get piss off and i wasn't look forward to the day she leave
S0084	mm
S0041	but then i think if you work with someone that you don't really know like i know when i take her on
S0084	mm
S0041	i be we be still worry the pair of us be a bite concern that it might just make us fall out
S0084	mm
S0041	i think if there's um any doubt don't do it
S0084	well absolutely and that you know that's why i didn't er we do work in the same office you know with her and the three of us all work at the press but work in the other build work for a different department and be very er in like a completely different business stream she's it
S0041	oh right okay
S0084	um and they there's three business stream there's elt er the english language teach which be where i work there's journals and then there's academic and professional and the it department support all three of those business stream
S0041	mm
S0084	so it's very separate so we're support by their team but we don't er really work together
S0041	yeah
S0084	generally speak they they deal with the systems that we use
S0041	they're helpers
S0084	they're the helpers they're the people who work behind the scenes so we don't really er have much day to day interaction with them so that's why it work for them
S0041	mm
S0084	because they have enough common interest in their their industry in term of their work and what they can talk about but it's very different to when they come home and they can just
S0041	mm
S0084	i mean i i would hope that they don't actually talk about work cos it would be really really bore
S0041	yeah
S0084	cos you'd be at work all day and then you'd be come home and talk about work and it would be really easy to spend your entire life talk about work
S0041	work
S0084	that'd be
S0041	yeah
S0084	my worry i don't want to i mean i very rarely
S0041	it'll just take over
S0084	do yeah i very rarely do actually i think i don't think i talk about work that much
S0041	no not not at all i think the only time work come up be when it's a relationship within that environment
S0084	mm mm
S0041	or an event within that environment
S0084	mm
S0041	in which case it doesn't really matter that it's at work cos it could be it could be anywhere
S0084	could be a friendship
S0041	it doesn't matter
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos it's the event that's the important part of the conversation or
S0084	mm i i try and leave it at the door just think you know i'm here one hundred percent seven hours a day that's enough
S0041	mm
S0084	i don't need to take it home with me and i think that's it's the first job that i've ever be able to do that i dunno i think actually
S0041	that's good
S0084	it's quite quite encourage i think it just probably mean that i'm quite settle i suppose
S0041	mm
S0084	but it's i think also it's just very i dunno it's not customer face so you don't have that you'll never guess what happen with this person who come in
S0084	and obviously you've get clients and suppliers but it's not really the same
S0041	mm
S0084	and i just think everyone else will find it bore like i really like it er maybe that's why i really like it
S0041	mm
S0084	i dunno if everybody else would so you just sort of get on with it really
S0041	nobody else would like my job can't understand do you know who would like it
S0084	mm
S0041	young girls
S0084	young girls
S0041	i think would really love it like
S0084	cos er plan weddings
S0041	yeah plan party plan
S0084	mm
S0041	conferences plan weddings
S0084	mm
S0041	i think some if like the girl we go to the pub right this new girl work behind the bar in
S0084	mm
S0041	and she seem quite nice um she want us to go out on monday she's do promotion for joey essex
S0084	aw
S0041	he's here
S0084	amaze
S0041	he's have his own night
S0084	where be he
S0041	we have free pass if we want
S0084	what in that pub
S0041	um
S0084	in
S0041	sorry no i didn't explain that properly i get a bite carry away sidetrack with er joey essex she do promotion for somewhere or maybe it's heart this be heart maybe it's heart
S0084	this be the girl who a new girl who work behind the bar
S0041	new girl work behind the bar also do promotion
S0084	in the pub in
S0041	in sorry
S0084	at the hotel
S0041	i'm miss out vital detail i think it's the wine
S0084	where do the bite come
S0041	cos that's where she
S0084	do you mention
S0041	that's where she work behind the bar in
S0084	but not in the hotel no right fine
S0041	and i meet her
S0084	last week
S0041	for the first time
S0084	or something when you go to
S0041	last week yes
S0084	yeah fine
S0041	sorry
S0084	okay
S0041	but apart from that know her i don't know her
S0084	mm
S0041	i do now she want me to come to joey essex
S0084	nice
S0041	um yeah so she do joey essex
S0084	as well as work behind the bar
S0041	mhm so she'll work behind there a couple of days a week
S0084	mm
S0041	she do promotion a couple of days a week and i she might work somewhere else i dunno
S0084	oh that's quite vary
S0041	mm she's quite young probably as young as who by the way i'm really lose my tether with
S0084	really still
S0041	mm
S0084	what's go on
S0041	tell you in a minute
S0084	oh
S0041	er yeah and i be tell her what i do and she be really into it and i think actually she's quite young she's kind of twentyish
S0084	mm
S0041	around that mark she's not the brightest button in the bunch and she kind of she obviously enjoy that people bite and she'd get that out of my job
S0084	yeah
S0041	she'd get the bore admin bite alongside it cos there's a lot of that
S0084	mm
S0041	but i think she would thrive on do that because of the end entertain part
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	so i think i think if you're not very bright and you would go
S0084	mm
S0041	to be a receptionist say
S0084	mm
S0041	that's what your aim in life be to be a receptionist
S0084	yeah
S0041	then to do my job
S0084	it's a step above that isn't it ultimately
S0041	would be a step above it
S0084	yeah
S0041	yeah i think that would be
S0084	yeah
S0041	i think some some kind of
S0084	it's not a bad job for somebody who's you know who's not get er further career aspirations
S0041	mm
S0084	you know if you just wanna stay local
S0041	or even to be a manager there i think would be quite i mean 's not dumb you'd have to be quite bright to do it
S0084	yeah
S0041	i think you just don't need to have much ambition
S0084	yeah
S0041	do you know what i mean
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	much further than that
S0084	yeah
S0041	it's a very direct route it's very small step over a long time and
S0084	mm
S0041	the job role basically 's job role be very much the same as my job role
S0084	mm
S0041	we do the same thing we do the same contract the only thing be she have to run report as well so
S0084	and line manage
S0041	yeah
S0084	mm
S0041	it's not really but she only have to line manage and i and
S0084	yeah it's the it's
S0041	that's not really a manager job to me when there's only two of you
S0084	well it's it's the same for my my level above so i'm the trainee and then you have the production so i'm trainee production controller then you have production controller which er there's no difference a trainee you get pay er less but you get to ask question but you would do if you be production controller like with the production controller they expect you to have
S0041	ask question
S0084	production experience yeah
S0041	do the for her
S0084	mm
S0041	like the system that we use he's er people in the i don't know if you have this we have champion of stuff
S0084	yeah yeah we have super users we call it
S0041	yeah like that
S0084	mm
S0041	so he's our champion
S0084	mm
S0041	so ask him
S0084	yeah and i guess that you do
S0041	could have her job
S0084	you do sort of delegate it but that's i well that's what i really like about our operations manager so my boss's boss be that she even though she's really busy cos obviously you're all you're suppose to have be a sort of overview of what's go on in your department cos you delegate everything so that you can more involve in the high level decisions er
S0041	mm
S0084	she's very aware of what each of us be work on who er you know what project we're work on who we're work with and any sort of major concern the department's have she's really she's really aware without be too hand on
S0041	mm
S0084	i think she's get the right balance
S0041	you see doesn't delegate
S0084	oh
S0041	she answer the phone as much as we answer the phone
S0084	so that's probably why she's so fuck stress you know especially now that you've come out the other side of christmas
S0041	mm
S0084	like obviously christmas be mental
S0041	oh shit that be bad but even she admit it be bad
S0084	yeah
S0041	and say i've never see anything like it
S0084	i mean if they really don't have budget to get some
S0041	we've get two thousand cover for next year
S0084	good
S0041	already
S0084	it's march fyi
S0041	we
S0041	we get four thousand as a total last last year so we're already halfway there
S0084	thank god you're gonna be out of there
S0041	yeah thank fuck
S0084	's get to leave although you say he quite enjoy it
S0041	mm
S0084	so fine
S0041	i think he should have 's job
S0084	yeah they should just swap um i can see why er you know peak time she could get involve and she should know what you do so that she can do that if need be you know if one of you's
S0041	mm
S0084	sick or whatever but day to day there's no need for her to do your job you know otherwise she wouldn't be get pay more and expect to do more
S0041	i think the only reason she do it be because there's not enough staff
S0084	mm
S0041	so for the amount of work that's involve
S0084	right
S0041	chasers and admin work
S0084	mm
S0041	really what should be happen be should have who's texting me you're here
S0084	me it's a surprise my phone's really excellent i've probably have only deliver the message now
S0084	huh when be the lamb time hammertime
S0041	i'm not sure about it yet hon 's in tonight
S0084	tell him to get out he's get plan to do
S0041	what's

S0084	it's on the coast it's really pretty
S0041	not sure he's back tomorrow
S0084	not sure or not sure he's back
S0041	so not sure he's back tomorrow or i'm not sure if he's back tomorrow i dunno

S0084	mm i actually like these brown ones
S0041	yeah she
S0084	hm
S0041	oh she what should happen be and i've explain this to her she's not daft she should know it be that basically what she do be work long shift so once a week or twice a week she'll work till eight o'clock at night so she's put extra hours in
S0084	and what do say
S0041	well one day a week she's a dm so she's get to be in the hotel anyway
S0084	mm
S0041	but that mean she'll stay and sometimes work till midnight
S0084	fuck me what start at eight
S0041	she's if she stay in the hotel yeah so she'll start at eight carry on through to when she fall asleep and then be up start work at say half five
S0084	half five
S0041	the next day yeah she'll be sit at her desk go down for breakfast at seven then leave that day at four
S0084	mm for for how much for twenty three grand a year

S0041	yeah she's er
S0084	and i'm a trainee
S0041	can you believe it yeah exactly
S0084	that's ridiculous
S0041	can you believe a manager would do that
S0084	no
S0041	and she have to take she have to take decisions that be for the entire property
S0084	mm
S0041	like she's get people come to to her for her to train them on best practice
S0084	mm
S0041	like she have to really take a massive responsibility for it
S0084	mm
S0041	i'm not talk like a manager in a team of managers perhaps
S0084	mm
S0041	with someone as her direct line

S0041	compare to them
S0084	mm
S0041	and i be lie hand them over
S0084	mm
S0041	like don't feel bad about hand them over cos she she hadn't before cos she want to see how comfortable i be after christmas cos this be a few months ago and i say no do it i say i'm a bite bogged under now cos it be the first wed i'd ever do
S0084	yeah
S0041	and i keep get the weddings which be a fucker
S0041	cos purposefully hand them over cos he hat them
S0084	fair
S0041	which be fine he's a boy you know
S0084	mm
S0041	um he help me enough for me to take on any wed he take he shove my way to be fair
S0084	okay
S0041	um and i say no that's fine you know once you've win it hand it over or if we just take the enquiry put it in and pass it over
S0084	mm
S0041	i don't mind at all i say yep shove it my way but she hasn't do it even though i say to do it she's still so on the book for the past for three weeks now i've have two three book in
S0084	mm
S0041	i mean to be fair i've be fight for other business like i i seem to do a lot more negotiate than they do
S0084	mm
S0041	and i've have er another wed to arrange i have well and now so i haven't have a break wed wise
S0041	fuck what a load of fuck that be

S0041	i'm not take another one after that oh shit no i've get one on the book for august
S0084	tut huh you might be go by then
S0041	ff finger cross so she she won't be a manager i don't know if she just like the the admin i don't i dunno dunno but get employee of the month again this month
S0084	oh yeah you say that's really good
S0041	yeah and he really deserve it and i be i be gonna say to actually cos i know she's plan on leave by the end of the year
S0084	mm
S0041	um and she we both have like pdp personal development plan to work on
S0084	oh yeah
S0041	and she be say how you know we haven't do anything on yours and we both secretly know that the reason we haven't be there's not much point cos i'm gonna leave either way um
S0084	mm
S0041	but she have to be see to be do something
S0084	yep
S0041	and i have to be see to be do something so i've put some really piss easy stuff on there that i already know how to do so we can just tick it off so i think i'm gonna say to her like why don't you really work on 's with his cos i think when she go he could apply for her job
S0084	that'd be great
S0041	i mean it's a big
S0084	good career move for him
S0041	he's jump cos he should be a supervisor before he's a manager but really he could be a supervisor now even though he doesn't have anyone to supervise the level of work that he do and the level of support that he provide
S0084	mm
S0041	he could be
S0084	wow
S0041	he's really competent really competent and he'll have his nvq admin qualification that he's just finish off so i be gonna have a word with her this week and say do you think cos
S0084	put in a good word
S0041	yeah if you if you bump him up to supervisor now if you leave at christmas cos she's not on about stay much longer than that
S0084	really
S0041	yeah he could apply for your job cos he could do it now he's mass the things that i would find difficult he would be spot on with so he's he'd need help with his managerial soft skills
S0084	mm
S0041	but report forecast number do contract doesn't miss a trick he's fine like he could do her job
S0084	how long have he be do it like do his job
S0041	mm a year now i think
S0084	hm
S0041	a year not a oh no i think he might've have his year in november or something a year not a year and a half yet
S0084	wow
S0041	yeah but he's really good at it he must've just i mean he's really
S0084	just really take to it
S0041	yeah really kind of put everything into it um and er i mean i know i take the piss a bite but you know i think he'll get somewhere with it he'll at least he'll get to 's level even if he do i maybe he doesn't wanna go any further
S0084	some people don't though
S0041	some people don't yeah
S0084	yeah i mean for me i think i'll just be happy a couple of level up you know operations manager or something like that you know sort of manage in our in our company it'd be manage direct manage five people and responsible for about ten so
S0041	okay
S0084	it's it's a small team but it's enough
S0041	yeah
S0084	to let you be on you know a publish salary but like i think 's on oh actually 's on really bad money i think for what she do she's i think she's only on about thirty three it's not an awful lot
S0041	mm but you can once you get to that type of level you can do it in any company can't you
S0084	mm
S0041	whoever's gonna highest bidder

S0041	right
S0084	anyway and then there's a nice like country walk and park and farm shop and loveliness it's call
S0041	mm
S0084	people er people her call it
S0041	i probably call it i think
S0084	it's like er yeah
S0041	mm
S0084	bury
S0041	i think it depend how you when you're bring up how you're teach things
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos i be from like
S0084	okay
S0084	yeah
S0041	but i'd say
S0084	oh okay yeah
S0041	mm i suppose it's how you're teach to how to say things i suppose
S0084	well in in you've get um a town just outside which be write so it's e double s e double s y
S0084	it's weird but they call it it's get about five more ss in it than they actually can be
S0084	bother to pronounce but yeah and they've you know they've get which be write
S0041	mhm
S0084	but they call it and they don't pronounce the d or or
S0084	any of the other any of the other consonants really
S0084	they just think
S0041	nah
S0084	i'm busy far too busy to be er pronounce word
S0041	no time for that now
S0084	i've get i've get better things to do i'm afraid it's not on my list of um priorities
S0041	there's another thing i saw oh that's what i hate do you call it derby or derby
S0084	derby
S0041	it's derby
S0084	yeah
S0041	why do those stupid people call it derby
S0084	as in donkey
S0041	yeah
S0084	mm
S0041	don't get that
S0084	oh it's people try to be posh
S0041	stupid derby
S0084	sound like sound like idiots
S0041	mm
S0084	i suppose i dunno i imagine people from birmingham might say derby
S0041	derby yeah maybe
S0084	or like coventry or something people with ridiculously stupid accent
S0041	stupid accent tut yep pretty much
S0084	use to watch the er welsh channel and laugh at all the welsh people
S0041	do she
S0084	speak welsh not great for er you know england welsh relations
S0041	no
S0084	really
S0041	no probably not
S0084	she's like ha ha ha ha they're really funny yeah i don't think they really find themselves
S0084	particularly funny i don't really think
S0084	they'd take that well to english people point and laugh
S0041	probs not probs not um jane at work be say she use to be marry to a guy that be welsh
S0084	mm
S0041	well he be english well i dunno what the fuck he be his first language be welsh
S0084	right
S0041	but i think he move away when he be like six or something
S0084	mm
S0041	um but his his mum be one of these i be welsh i be proud get your sheep off my mountain
S0041	type
S0084	ah
S0041	welsh till i die and she get a she didn't pay her bill for something i think it be like a phone bill
S0084	fine
S0041	and they send her the final reminder get reminder reminder reminder final reminder final final final reminder
S0084	we're gonna come break your legs
S0041	and she refuse because it wasn't in her language because it be send in english
S0084	that's er
S0041	she say no fuck off
S0084	well that's interest because the the language of wales be be english so that's not really a line of defence really
S0041	yeah so she say no my first language be welsh i can't understand this
S0084	but you but you can
S0084	because you speak english so whether your first language be welsh or not you speak english therefore good luck with that
S0041	i be not pay it um sod it that's that's against my human right whatever cut her fuck off didn't they cut her phone line out
S0084	fine they're ridiculous though cos my cos she be six when her mum move her and her sister to and she grow up in and she say the school they go to it be proper segregation there's a pocket of school kid who be english and all the rest of them be welsh and they didn't mix the welsh kid use to bully them no end
S0041	really
S0084	they be horrible to them yeah absolutely it's er it's breed there you know they just do not like the english er still to this day it's ridiculous they use to be truly horrible so her friends from school be the english girls from the school because the welsh girls never use to mix completely segregate it be all and this be what fifteen twenty years ago appal
S0041	why do they hate us
S0084	um who can say the i'm sure there's some like long history there i don't really know i don't really care when i go to visit her mum and her step dad in they live just outside well they live just outside in and it be it's really beautiful countryside and they take us out and about and they drive us into we go to tenby and you can see and you can wave to the people in it's really pretty
S0084	and er they be say that at that time i dunno whether they ever do it they want to change every single one of the road sign at the moment it say english first and then welsh underneath
S0041	mm
S0084	they want to change it so that it's welsh first
S0041	mm
S0084	and then the english it would've cost millions and
S0041	yeah
S0084	millions of pound but they wanna do it because they don't want the english on the on the road sign
S0041	i've hear that before
S0084	it's ridiculous behaviour
S0041	mm there's somewhere i can't remember where it be it might be near selby that the road sign be in polish before english
S0084	really
S0041	mm
S0084	that's interest
S0041	cos the polish population there be so high like in before we leave er it wasn't like there when i start at uni but there's so many polish there
S0084	mm
S0041	that the ruffians awful chav people hate but in actual fact they work fricking hard
S0084	absolutely
S0041	like
S0084	and they do all the job the english people won't do
S0041	won't do yeah so they use to work in the factories and they use to get on
S0084	mm
S0041	a coach use to come and collect them from their home which unless your boss think you're fricking good at your job they're not gonna put a coach on for you for free be they
S0084	no way
S0041	it use to pick them up at five in the morning
S0084	mm
S0041	all through the estate and then drop them back back excuse me back off about six half six at night so they work a long day twelve hour shift
S0084	mm
S0041	five days a week weekend off and send all the money home
S0084	mm
S0041	but because a lot of the shop be own by polish place like the sun bed shop and the little supermarket a bite like be on mill road
S0084	mm
S0041	be a bite like where i live when i be at uni
S0084	mm
S0041	um and there's all all sort of foreign shop and load of them then start put sign in polish cos they start be buy by polish
S0084	oh okay
S0041	and so they petition to put the road sign in polish but it never get it never get put through it should've really cos it well there's probably not quite fifty fifty but yeah in selby
S0084	mm
S0041	they they pass it there be more polish people live there than english people so i mean i think that's a bite
S0084	ff
S0041	out of control
S0084	huh
S0041	you shouldn't really do that it be england
S0084	er well i mean in any other country they wouldn't have it would they
S0041	no
S0084	do you know what i mean
S0041	they'd tell them to fuck off
S0084	and er huh i mean i i really struggle with this cos i don't really believe in border i don't really understand er have a national identity er now that people migrate the way that they do
S0041	mm
S0084	i don't really believe that countries should stop other people from move in i don't like this this be my country that's your country you have to stay in your country and this be my country and the two can't mix
S0041	yeah
S0084	er however you obviously have problems with how many people the infrastructure can hold
S0041	yeah
S0084	we're a small island
S0041	yep
S0084	we're pretty much full to capacity right now
S0041	yep
S0084	um
S0041	i mean if it's a trade that we need i think that's a good way of judge it
S0084	mm
S0041	like we we bring in a load of dentists about six years ago didn't we
S0084	mm
S0041	from poland
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos we didn't have enough
S0084	absolutely
S0041	fine
S0084	well that's um so that's certainly how australia do it isn't it
S0041	be it
S0084	and er and they only let you in base on um a number er system
S0041	tut oh yeah yeah i remember you say now
S0084	and um if you've get a particularly particular skill that they need then they let you in automatically don't have to you know i don't think i think you probably obviously have to fill out paperwork but it's not as much of a rigmarole like if i want to move there without and my skill isn't on their list
S0041	yeah
S0084	um i'd have to be sponsor by a profession there like by an industry there
S0041	oh
S0084	a company
S0041	yeah you can do that with america can't you
S0084	mm
S0041	if you get there on a work visa
S0084	yeah
S0041	and you're there for the duration of your work visa if they wanna keep you then they can do the rest of the paperwork you don't have to
S0084	yeah
S0041	do it
S0084	it's hard er i think cos er australia if you you can only get a work visa for a year and if you spend three of those months do rural work i e literally in the outback which be what my friend tasha do
S0041	oh god
S0084	you can be extend to two years and then after that you can apply for citizenship by ask your your company to sponsor you which be what she's do but rural work when she work there
S0041	oh god
S0084	she have to live in the outback it be you know that orange sand that you see in film and stuff
S0041	yeah
S0084	it be like that they be like a hundred kilometres from any other house they be on a farm it be her job to sweep the house clean the house cook the meals they obviously have men on the ranch farm they have wild kid just run around and she would sweep the house with all the sand it be very very basic and then they'd open the door and the sand would just come back in again she do it for three months she nearly die and in fact actually nearly do die because she break her ankle and
S0041	oh
S0084	they wouldn't send the helicopter ambulance out because they say oh er we don't think it's that much of an emergency and she say that's very interest but i possibly have internal bleed right now i can't stand on my foot i'm in excruciate pain ff yeah well the fly doctor can't come to you until tomorrow so can you just like bandage it and elevate it and we'll come out and she be like fine
S0041	what
S0084	so you really be at the mercy of whether
S0041	uh
S0084	someone can come and get you if something bad bad happen but yeah that's that's what you have to do you have to do your rural work if you want to stay for an extra year which be an a good way of do it if you if there's an industry that you're you can't get employees for
S0041	mm
S0084	but it's a bite harsh like it's quite quite a quite a way of do it
S0041	work on a farm
S0084	but this so yeah the go back to the point about the road sign this be this be the uk and er at the moment er er the language of the country be english
S0041	mm
S0084	therefore everything should be in english
S0041	yeah it's not like the majority speak welsh
S0084	er the it's have to be about the majority of the people i mean it could be that in fifty years time the national religion might be muslim
S0041	mm
S0084	because we're become the white the white population be become more secular
S0041	yeah
S0084	and i mean er it might be that it force people to become more religious
S0041	yeah
S0084	in response to that
S0041	choose yeah
S0084	i i dunno it's difficult to say
S0041	yeah
S0084	but certainly with the um migration of muslims come here could be that that's that's what become our
S0041	yeah
S0084	national identity i just i don't really
S0084	i don't really agree with that i think just let people migrate the way they want to well and that would help the situation between have a really rich west and a really poor east
S0041	yeah if people can move as they want
S0084	yeah
S0041	yeah it would
S0084	and that's why they don't want them to cos it's very easy to have poor africans
S0041	yep although i do think that everywhere should be like france with its er er huh what's the english word er maybe we don't have a word like religion freeness
S0084	tut yeah we're a secular state we don't unless you go to a religious school like a catholic school you're not teach about religion you er do you mean like have a religious
S0041	no er
S0084	religion separate to to the state
S0041	i mean they have a thing where in any school any government any it's anybody employ by the government so police teachers all that shabaz
S0084	mm
S0041	any school they're not allow to show their religion so no turbans no cross
S0084	mm
S0041	no anything no nothing at all
S0084	mm
S0041	that say your religious beliefs
S0084	mm mm
S0041	nothing
S0084	that's what they do in america isn't it
S0041	oh be it
S0084	yeah
S0041	oh i didn't know that
S0084	yeah because they
S0041	ah
S0084	they they're so well it's really difficult actually isn't it because obviously in the south they're a real bible belt but they want to keep religion separate to the state but i think in actual fact because so many of the like the um senators and the governors obviously the south be very strong
S0041	mm
S0084	they're quite religious so i think they actually have quite an impact because you've get this friction between state law and federal law so the law that relate to the country as a whole and laws that relate to just a state i think talk to an american person recently they be say that they don't imagine that the usa will stay unite
S0041	no
S0084	because laws that be that relative to new york for example be completely different to laws that relate to texas like obviously in texas they've still get capital punishment you know they've get the highest
S0041	huh
S0084	number of people on death row
S0041	it doesn't make sense to me
S0084	you know they still they still execute people on a on a monthly basis and to new yorkers it's er barbaric completely different mindset completely different culture and if you think in term of miles how far away it be it'd be like someone in england compare themselves to someone in romania the
S0041	that far away
S0084	that's how far away it be america's
S0041	what
S0084	massive like er yeah maybe not romania
S0041	i suppose you see it on the map and it be actually the full length isn't it
S0084	yeah if you think texas be right at the bottom in the middle and new york be right up there on the east coast
S0041	yeah
S0084	it's really far
S0041	jesus
S0084	it's like it's like its er its own continent essentially be probably what's
S0041	yeah
S0084	gonna happen
S0041	yeah definitely
S0084	cos you just can't you just can't create laws for all of them they won't come in line
S0041	what do you mean its own continent
S0084	if you think about the usa er um and compare it to europe
S0041	yeah
S0084	for example so that's probably what would happen it would become a continent as oppose to a country and each of the state would be its own country
S0041	so what's continent be america in
S0084	it's north it's north america so er usa and canada be its own continent then you've get
S0041	ah
S0084	central america which be you know mexico and some other countries
S0041	which be er all that crap before brazil
S0084	no yeah everything er before brazil so uruguay's up there some other stuff
S0041	some peru or summat summat like that
S0084	peru's south
S0041	be it
S0084	chile's south argentina's south paraguay's south there's load of other random ones but i dunno where guatemala be
S0041	oh
S0084	i think that's south
S0041	mm
S0084	costa rica's south huh so that's probably what's gonna happen i think
S0041	my geography's appal
S0084	huh
S0041	my geography's appal
S0084	mine's pretty bad
S0041	yeah at least you know where things be roughly
S0084	roughly very very roughly but as demonstrate my geography of the uk pretty bad
S0041	well you know
S0084	i think it be er because you look at the place that you want to go to i want to go to latin america
S0084	so i've look at
S0041	oh
S0084	where those countries be i haven't look at hull very sorry to say i haven't plan any trip to hull
S0041	probably wise
S0084	probably not gonna be do that
S0041	it's probably wise
S0084	any time soon
S0041	i wouldn't advise it
S0084	mm really
S0041	i wouldn't advise that except for to go to the deep of course
S0084	the what
S0041	go there er the only submarium in er in europe i think
S0084	what's a submarium
S0041	er it's like er an aquarium but you go underneath it so like glass above you and load of fish and shark stuff up there
S0084	oh
S0041	yeah you just
S0084	cool
S0041	walk through the little tunnel and you can see all the stuff
S0084	oh that sound awesome i wanna do that
S0041	yeah
S0084	last time i go to see cromer be there be there's one in cromer which be on the north coast and er we'd go to
S0041	cromer

S0084	fuck me cos the next day i be read in the paper which would be er yeah so yesterday i be read in the paper that the guy who invent amazon
S0041	right
S0084	who's worth eighteen billion dollars
S0041	yep
S0084	what do you even do with that money er you that you can solve all of the medical issue in the you could like find er cure for cancer and aid he
S0041	yes
S0084	be go to use money very wisely you'll be please to hear
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	by find the rocket from the apollo missions in the sea
S0041	tut
S0084	do you know like when the rocket blast off into space and they go and put so that what he want to find be the rocket that be attach to the shuttle that go up for the apollo 11 mission you know buzz aldrin neil armstrong walk on the moon nineteen sixty nine he want to find that rocket which he think he's locate
S0041	why
S0084	a it belong to nasa so fyi you can't even have it if you do dredge it up
S0041	yeah
S0084	what be you do
S0041	what what be you gonna what be you gonna gain from that
S0084	i think he he's someone who he er philanthropic i think they call it um
S0041	philanthopic
S0084	er philanthropic
S0084	philanthropy yeah but
S0041	philanthropic how do you say it
S0084	well i say er
S0041	not philanthropic
S0084	i'd i would say philanthropic but you do say philanthropy so it's all much of a muchness i would think
S0041	i think i might be wrong but i think it might be philanthropic only because it's the last vowel isn't it i think in english we pronounce the last vowel in the world as the stress er in the word as the stress
S0084	in the world
S0041	in the world i think
S0084	it's er
S0041	oh
S0084	but it's more to do with the way you put the stress on the first
S0041	philanthropic
S0084	first vowel isn't it because it's either philanthropic philanthropic so it's the second vowel
S0041	second to last vowel
S0084	so it's philanthropic well you've only get three you've get i a and o
S0041	it's the second to last one it's the same as spanish
S0084	so it'd be throp would be the stress philanthropic
S0041	oh so maybe you're right then oh i really wanna know now
S0084	i don't know
S0041	i'm gonna have to google it i'm afraid this be how serious er
S0084	i think it's
S0041	this be how much of a geek
S0084	philanthropic but er you do say philanthropy
S0041	but it usually change doesn't it
S0084	yeah
S0041	if you change the word
S0084	yeah
S0041	it do usually change
S0084	so
S0041	but yes
S0084	so that so basically he want to put it in a museum for the good of the people and for generations to come
S0041	but nasa's just gonna take it back anyway
S0084	yeah absolutely so good luck with that
S0041	so he didn't really think that through with his millions
S0084	ff
S0041	which he'll waste
S0084	it do make you think what on earth be lie at the bottom of the ocean like all kinds of space garbage
S0041	yeah must be
S0084	do you ever watch that that advert you know that be a smirnoff advert and they make them have like
S0041	the judderman
S0084	huh
S0041	be it the judderman
S0084	don't know what the judderman be
S0041	huh
S0084	you can show me the judderman
S0041	have you hear the judderman that might be schnapps actually
S0084	oh that be schnapps yeah i use to love him
S0041	oh okay yeah me too
S0084	mm judderman i dunno if that's what it's er anyway um
S0041	stuff at the bottom of the sea
S0084	stuff at the bottom of the sea yeah so the smirnoff advert you know that smirnoff be suppose to be really good for you it's suppose to be good vodka because it's triple distil it's not just
S0041	yes mm
S0084	straight from a potato
S0041	yeah
S0084	whether that's true or not i don't know but er the advert be dredge things out of the sea so you'd see they'd you'd see like a couple walk along the sea front and it be you know shoot in you know it be shoot true to life but obviously they'd add the cgi effect over the top because there be like gold pennies fly out of the sea and like ship rise out of the water and you know like submarine and all kinds of stuff come out of the sea and it do make you wonder like if you could actually dredge the sea
S0041	yeah
S0084	what the hell be you gonna find
S0041	load of shit
S0084	down there titanic for a start that's
S0041	yeah
S0084	down there
S0041	yeah
S0084	all kinds of carry on
S0041	yeah
S0084	be just rot at the bottom of the ocean
S0041	all sort of shit
S0084	and it's fuck massive like he reckon these rocket um that um you know become detach from the er er apollo 11 shuttle be fourteen thousand feet underwater below sea level that's fuck
S0041	how do you get to that
S0084	far i have no idea and er and what kind of a condition be they gonna be in like the it's er in the sea therefore it's salty
S0041	how be i spell this one be it p h philanthropic or be it an f
S0084	p h i l a n t h r o p i c
S0084	yeah i mean i imagine the salt's erode er the metal so i don't know what kind of condition they're even gonna be in but he hasn't say where they be apparently it be on one of his it be on his website that that's what he's gonna do but
S0084	whether nasa know about this i don't know
S0041	yeah probably not
S0084	his his other idea be that he's go to have a ten thousand year clock that's gonna count down to twenty er well i don't even know what's ten thousand years from now
S0041	ten thousand er would it be the year
S0084	it'd be ten
S0041	thirty thousand
S0041	thirty thousand and eleven like two thousand how many be he er how many do he want
S0084	ten thousand
S0041	oh twenty so it'd be
S0084	we're in the year two thousand now
S0041	that's be we in two thousand now
S0084	yeah so it'd be it'd be twelve thousand
S0041	twenty two thousand
S0084	er we're in
S0041	be we only in two
S0084	we're in two thousand and twelve
S0041	ah yeah
S0084	so
S0041	correct
S0084	twelve thousand and twelve
S0041	why would you wanna do that
S0084	cos he's a fuck weirdo and he's gonna put it in a cave so i think that
S0041	i i don't see i don't see the link
S0084	i think the the idea the link be he's a fuck maniac
S0041	right
S0084	with more money than sense and his money should be he should be make to give his money to science
S0041	yep i think you should have to prove that you're bright enough to have that type of money
S0084	well he's probably bright enough you know you get evil geniuses but he be
S0041	oh
S0084	probably mental
S0041	ah
S0084	so he obviously
S0041	none of the mentalness allow here
S0084	you know like when they um tut er put you in mental prison because you're not actually in charge of your own faculties like they can they if i think
