S0480	oh very much so yeah
S0392	would it almost feel like you're in you weren't connect if you be in one and the other
S0480	well they no they be really quite separate cities
S0392	yeah
S0480	really they
S0392	yeah
S0480	grow up independently of each other really
S0392	they just happen to be very close to each other
S0480	yeah
S0392	like newcastle and gateshead
S0480	yes
S0392	to name
S0480	yeah
S0392	but one
S0480	yeah
S0392	erm
S0480	yeah a not dissimilar situation really
S0392	yeah they're they're lucky cos they've get a river in between that river'll really make sure that they're never blend but
S0480	yeah
S0392	you know it be a metro area because our dream that the city the biggest city in the country base on the area that be mark out to be part of the queen's charter to be a city the biggest one be actually carlisle because carlisle
S0480	really
S0392	city encompass a lot of the countryside where the thing where whereas things like er the city of london be only a square mile really
S0480	yeah
S0392	isn't it
S0480	well the yeah the strictly speak
S0392	yeah
S0480	the city be just a square mile
S0392	yeah
S0480	of london yeah
S0392	yeah and then there's the city of
S0480	yeah
S0392	westminster as well which be actually bigger
S0480	i've have a few curry round here
S0392	i bet you have have they
S0480	well where i use to live in be only five minutes or so down there
S0392	yeah and have your have they all be good or have you have a few ones that have be memorable for the wrong reason
S0480	i don't think i've ever have a really bad one no
S0392	oh mm then there's a chinese there as well by the look of it abc but c spell s e a
S0392	yeah this sort of erm sort of outer ring of the city feel a lot like round in york just have that feel to it you know er on the way out from
S0480	yeah
S0392	the inner ring
S0480	yeah
S0392	road now the the sort of traditional house intersperse with small shop the odd restaurant
S0480	yes i know what you mean yeah yeah it be a bite isn't it
S0392	yeah
S0480	except that this be hilly
S0392	yeah yeah contour have start
S0480	you know you're you're go all the way down to the river here
S0392	yeah yeah
S0480	move continually down to the
S0392	that's a good way if you're ever stick in a city and you don't know where to get to
S0480	if you know the river
S0392	walk downhill
S0480	yeah
S0392	and you'll end up at the river yeah
S0392	yeah there's an industrial museum down there it's ten o'clock already
S0480	yeah
S0392	it definitely overrun didn't it
S0480	yeah weddings in particular always do cos people underestimate the amount
S0392	yeah
S0480	of time it take to fee people they say
S0392	yeah
S0480	okay right well we'll have our meal between you know half past six and half past eight but you know it take thirty minutes to get everybody's first course out
S0392	yeah it it be quite long wasn't it
S0480	well yeah that's an exaggeration but it it take a long time
S0392	it do yeah it take a long time
S0480	and then they've get to eat it then it's get to be clear away
S0392	and the next one's get to be
S0480	and then the next one's get to be bring out it take a long time to fee a lot of people
S0392	yeah well
S0480	when you know we see it again and again and again
S0392	yeah
S0480	's brother live just down here
S0392	oh yeah
S0480	there i think well one of these anyway
S0392	oh oh
S0480	this be the way i i shouldn't have turn right when i turn right and go down to er i should have just come straight on here from these
S0392	oh i see
S0480	traffic light but anyway a little trip down memory lane
S0392	see that's really nice that view there
S0480	yeah it's er er we play erm well we'll pass it on the way out we play at golf club
S0392	yeah
S0480	a few weeks back and the view that's on a cliff
S0480	and it the view over be amaze just absolutely amaze
S0392	yeah what river be it do you say the river
S0480	the river
S0392	yeah
S0480	from here yeah
S0392	yeah oh cos that's the one in isn't it as well yeah
S0480	yes it flow
S0392	yeah
S0480	through the two and the the canal follow
S0392	yeah
S0480	er that route out
S0480	and the railway follow that route out because the river take the flattest
S0392	i see yeah
S0480	route
S0392	yeah
S0480	and when the canal be build if you have to put lock in it's expensive and it's time consume
S0392	yeah
S0480	so you follow the flattest route with a canal
S0392	yeah
S0480	and when the railways be build
S0392	yeah
S0480	especially with the engines at that time they couldn't pull a train up a big hill or you need two engines
S0392	yeah
S0480	to do it so they follow the flattest route as well so if you be to
S0392	yeah
S0480	look down from about two hundred feet up when you come down here you'd see the canal the river and the railway all parallel other go out
S0392	yeah yeah
S0480	or into and and out
S0392	oh yeah
S0480	that way but not through the centre of
S0392	yeah
S0480	not through the centre of however
S0392	yeah
S0480	you know be centre on the river
S0392	yes
S0480	whereas isn't or you know
S0392	oh i see
S0480	it's not on the river
S0392	that mm
S0480	that use to be a
S0392	that
S0480	use to be a chippy there that stay open
S0392	oh yeah
S0480	on sundays
S0392	that about the river cos probably would mean that be around a lot earlier
S0480	yeah i think it be actually
S0392	yeah in fact that remind me be the biggest place in the world with an place name from celtic derive from
S0480	be there
S0392	compare to er yeah place like they're all celtic name
S0480	be they really
S0392	and it's the oldest one in the that's what my dad say anyway and i can believe it
S0480	uhu
S0392	definitely the oldest one in britain and i think otherwise unlikely there's anything bigger in like brittany or somewhere
S0480	yeah yeah the celtic yeah
S0392	or wherever else the celtic language spread
S0392	mm a lot of river name they're pre celtic so even pre european but be erm the oldest a bite of trivia for you
S0480	oh that's er that's good stuff i like my history you know i like
S0480	history that relate
S0392	yeah yeah that's it yeah local history family history stuff you can see
S0480	yeah
S0392	do you know what i mean yeah
S0480	down there i use to go to my moor
S0392	yeah
S0480	when i live on the boat
S0392	oh
S0480	god it be dark at night
S0392	would they do you always find the right boat or do you ever
S0480	stumble
S0392	yeah
S0480	onto the wrong one no i think there be just there the the car park be very very dark
S0392	yeah
S0480	and you be right on the edge of the woods there
S0392	yeah well
S0480	do you have a key to get in
S0392	i know i know where there be one erm
S0480	it's just if if we get there
S0392	yeah
S0480	first they might beat us
S0392	yeah i can go round and let
S0480	they beat us here so
S0392	yeah if they beat us there then they can open up and everything if we get there first then i can i can get in and er
S0480	you know how it's do
S0392	yeah
S0480	gosh it's nice to be finish at civilise time okay
S0392	yeah
S0480	it'll be eleven o'clock when we get home but
S0392	it's better than start at like
S0480	that's that's just that's er yeah better than go on for the last set at eleven o'clock
S0392	yeah welcome to it say
S0480	yeah
S0392	so when you play what sort of layout would the night take you just do a bite break do a bite break how would it work
S0480	usually two set so we'd typically go on sometime between nine and ten
S0392	yeah
S0480	depend erm
S0392	do you have like a set open that you start with
S0480	yeah usually erm it it we've change it a bite over the years i can't remember what i can't remember what the current one be because oh yeah we go for erm oh what a night by erm
S0480	oh i can't remember
S0392	yeah
S0480	er what's it tight harmony group frankie valli and the four season
S0392	yeah
S0480	erm we but it's it's never be erm it just didn't have the impact of the the our best one be move like jagger
S0392	yeah
S0480	i think and we use to do erm we use to do a a an opener a bite like the close but it be
S0392	yeah
S0480	our opener erm what be it call tonight's tonight's gonna be a good good night
S0392	the black eye peas yeah
S0480	that's it erm we do that erm just build it slowly then it just start out with the guitar then the guitar and the key then bass and one singer and then the drum and the other singer and then it just go round a couple of time then it stop then we do move like jagger and that be the best opener we've ever do you know the most successful one but yeah usually we do erm do a forty five minute set
S0392	yeah
S0480	have a break and depend you know if we start at like nine o'clock we come off quarter to ten again
S0392	yeah
S0480	something like that start again at quarter past ten play till eleven eleven fifteen but that's that's an ideal night very often it just get push back and back and back and back
S0392	yeah
S0480	so you're go on for the last one around eleven o'clock so sometimes you'll play forty five minutes come off for five minutes
S0392	yeah
S0480	just time for people to go to the toilet or whatever then get back on and do the second set
S0392	yeah
S0480	so the first set you're usually around forty five minutes and the second set around an hour and if if they're keen if they want encore it's a little bite longer but it just
S0392	yeah
S0480	just depend on the night sometimes they're absolutely go mad and they don't want you to get off under any circumstances
S0480	and sometimes say right thank that's the last number you've play the last number and that's it you pack up and go home
S0392	it must be a lot of fun though you must
S0480	it be
S0392	must be good yeah
S0480	oh it's it's great it's great i wouldn't erm i wouldn't swap it it's erm well it's similar to this really isn't it
S0392	yeah
S0480	you know you're play you're play stuff you like generally speak that you've have er some hand in choose and alright
S0392	yeah
S0480	there'll be piece that you're not particularly keen on there'll be piece that you really enjoy play
S0392	yeah
S0480	or you find a technical challenge
S0392	yeah
S0480	or you particularly enjoy them
S0392	yeah
S0480	erm and you're play it with your pal
S0392	yeah
S0480	which you know which be a large part of our band really
S0392	yeah you've gotta be play with people who you like play with
S0480	yeah yeah i mean a lot of band they a lot of band you're just play with somebody who can actually play
S0480	and you turn up and you play and you go home again and there's nothing more to it than that
S0392	be that famous
S0480	it be it set itself up as a erm a rival to harry ramsden's but
S0392	really
S0480	they're nothing special there's a chippy opposite call
S0392	yeah
S0480	which have be there certainly since the second world war
S0480	and that's a really nice chippy i would always choose to go to the if i be buy them yeah it it's a lot of fun because
S0392	yeah
S0480	partly the people who you're with and it's a bite of social for us and
S0392	yeah
S0480	but the you know the payoff be people enjoy it the payoff be people get up
S0480	and dance and erm just have a good time
S0392	yeah it must be fun yeah it's that erm do you must do a similar set or even the do you all know the order that things be gonna be in
S0480	oh yeah yeah yeah we do we have a set it's change from gig to gig
S0392	yeah
S0480	so usually every gig we'll change a couple of songs we'll say okay we'll take that one out and we'll put that one in
S0392	yeah
S0480	or maybe that one mm maybe we play it a bite early last time so we'll put it a bite later in the set so we we we shift stuff about but so over time it change i mean there's some we've be play ever since we start the the band and we just play them every time
S0392	yeah
S0480	there's a chuck berry one that we do but we have a certain order that we play them in cos when there's six of you and you're play sort of like rapid fire we can't you know it's not like the ceilidh where
S0392	yeah
S0480	you know your mum's get to get them on the floor then she's get to get them sort out then she's get to teach the step
S0392	they just do it don't they
S0480	we we stop one right thank very much now the next song be one of your favourites and we're in
S0392	yeah
S0480	and that so you you know you need the order to be a set order
S0392	yeah
S0480	that you all know and that you all stick to cos again you know when it's in a what can be an extremely noisy environment plus the fact that with ear you know in ear
S0392	yeah
S0480	monitor you can't hear anything that isn't come through the back through the pa system
S0480	so it can be a bite erm you know if you say to somebody on the other side of the stage we're skip this one and we're do so and so and so and so the odds be they're not gonna hear and they'll just start play the one that's on the list so
S0392	yeah so you've be there five of you
S0480	six
S0392	six you er drum
S0480	yeah
S0392	lead guitar
S0480	key
S0392	key and the
S0480	and the two girls
S0392	two girls yeah mm great how big's your repertoire about
S0480	oh in no i don't know let me think i think the last time we count it up there be about fifty odd songs sort of thing
S0392	wow brilliant
S0480	and we we're at the minute we're go through a process of weed some out you know stuff that think oh right it's never we've play it a couple of time what we'll try and do be be play one or two each one that be hot in the chart at the time
S0392	i see yeah
S0480	so we play a meghan trainor one
S0392	yeah all about that bass be it
S0480	er it it wasn't unfortunately
S0392	oh right
S0480	be keen to do it but i'd never hear of it so i think oh well i've never hear of this woman
S0480	and then erm
S0392	she be she be famous for she be one of those one hit wonder where they do a second one and people buy it cos of the name on the tin and then after that
S0480	yeah
S0392	it sort of fizzle out a bite
S0480	yeah i i i i mean alright she's still quite big in certainly in america but i suspect that in a year's time she'll have go
S0392	yeah
S0480	go the way of a lot of similar people
S0392	it's like that er there's a few like er a few years ago there be a fella who call himself passenger and he release a song and it get to number one and it be there for weeks people love it and sing it and they keep ask him to do it and he didn't release anything else and ever since i imagine he's still do
S0480	that song
S0392	tour and things
S0392	yeah he must still be do something but er he hasn't have any more hit since that
S0480	oh well that must well it's funny isn't it you know the the the people just come and go don't they you know they literally the one hit wonder
S0392	yeah well he be yeah
S0480	so we er you know we we'll do a song like that for a bite and if it's a really good song and people love it we'll keep it if it's just one of those throw away ones or if it doesn't work you know sometimes you put quite a lot of work into actually work up a song only to find that you play it a couple of time at a gig and it just doesn't seem to come off
S0392	yeah
S0480	really all that well you know the er sometimes we we can't get the time or the rhythm quite right or there's something lack you know some songs be erm you know they get lot and lot of layer of synthesiser and stuff in them and it can be it can be hard to replicate all that on stage
S0392	yeah what kind of er ones be you do nowadays from the from the chart
S0480	er i don't think we're do anything that's terribly current erm
S0392	when's your next gig
S0480	we're do erm now who be the bloke from the commodores he's who headline at glastonbury we're do one of his dance on the ceiling
S0392	oh yeah
S0480	erm i don't know i don't know if we're do anything that's hot in the chart at the minute if we be i can't remember it
S0480	but
S0392	be you play soon somewhere or have you get a rest
S0480	sorry
S0392	have you get a rest before the next gig or be it
S0480	erm
S0392	quite soon
S0480	the next one be hunt ball
S0392	yeah
S0480	and that's erm that's in october
S0392	yeah
S0480	and that it that's usually a good a good one cos the erm they seriously go for it
S0392	do they
S0480	yeah they really really go for it
S0392	yeah when's that
S0480	i forget which date in october it be it might be the tenth
S0392	do you get about one a month say
S0480	it it it average that yeah it average that it's funny we start this year with lot in prospect
S0392	yeah
S0480	oh yeah we think we've get this and somebody's be interest in that and and then half of them just haven't come off
S0392	yeah that's what i find with as well
S0480	yeah people make enquiries and yeah yeah
S0392	they think it's a nice idea
S0480	and they're keen and
S0392	but
S0480	yeah yeah
S0392	they never wanna commit yeah
S0480	but we've get two in erm in december and that's there's a a nice erm it's a sort of a bistro type place
S0392	oh
S0480	bar and bistro out on the a59 call
S0392	yeah
S0480	be a a restaurant type place for a long long time and we've do a few gigs there and 's quite pally with the guy that own it a guy call can't remember his second name but he contact us the other week and he say i'm think of put on a a couple of christmas party you know like work
S0392	yeah
S0480	christmas party where people you know he charge x amount per head he'll put on a meal put on a band and then he'll put on the bar and erm he he reckon he get quite a lot of interest in that so he's ask us for two date in december
S0392	yeah
S0480	so we're do i think the sixth and the nineteenth
S0392	yeah
S0480	and they they they 's gigs be always good because we get erm we get a nice room to sit in and we get really well feed cos their food be excellent
S0392	yeah
S0480	and yeah when well we get feed by and his team it's you know it's first class grub
S0392	brilliant
S0480	yeah
S0392	yeah
S0392	but that's a oh it's a pain carry all the bloody gear out of there cos we play
S0392	yeah
S0480	right in the middle of the room and you've you've either we either go out through one particular door but then we've get to walk the length of the place outside which if it's cold and wet and rainy it isn't much fun
S0480	or we can get out another door which be closer to where we've put the vehicles but you're pick your way through the table and people at the table and people still around all over the place so you're you know carry heavy gear past people
S0392	yeah
S0480	be er so that's the only drawback though and it's we you know and we like play there so that's a couple of that's a couple of decent christmas gigs
S0392	yeah brilliant do you charge the same to everyone or do you sort of tailor your price to
S0480	we we tailor it a bite and our standard be twelve hundred and fifty
S0392	yeah
S0480	and we pay our sound man two fifty and he do the sound and he do really good light as well
S0392	yeah
S0480	erm
S0392	and then there's a grand to share between the rest of you
S0480	and then there's a grand to share between the rest of us so we normally take a hundred and fifty out of it each
S0392	yeah
S0480	something like that and then put the rest into the band fund
S0392	yeah
S0480	and that you know that'll pay for erm pay for bits of gear sometimes if we invest in gear er it'll pay for that or it'll you know it go for the insurance we buy our beer for rehearsals cos we always have
S0392	yeah
S0480	a couple of beers at rehearsals
S0392	yeah
S0480	so it pay for that
S0392	yeah
S0480	other odds and sod there's like insurance and what have you
S0392	yeah i suppose with there be a lot more of you it's more expensive than a ceilidh when there's just three of us
S0480	yeah yeah
S0392	plus the caller

S0480	yeah
S0392	envelope of i think it be almost three hundred quid for the for our service
S0480	very nice
S0392	three hundred quid on the
S0480	very nice
S0392	and that be what's three hundred time twenty twenty five and if you do the maths
S0480	yeah several grand isn't it
S0392	you can the a lot of cash sit around yeah so yeah it be nice to be pay for rehearsals as well which be not something you often get
S0480	the yeah absolutely

S0480	yeah
S0392	still
S0480	two two pay rehearsals

S0392	oh yeah
S0480	he's he's he's not a bass player really he's a guitar player and he's a good guitar player incidentally
S0392	yeah
S0480	doesn't really like play bass very much
S0480	just say it's just physically such hard work
S0392	yeah
S0480	but it it it's you know he'll sit in to oblige you know he's he's get he's a nice lad erm so occasionally we have a dep drummer or a dep key man
S0392	yeah
S0480	and what we say we'll pay you whatever it be a hundred quid or two hundred quid or whatever it be erm for one rehearsal or two rehearsals and the gig you know like an
S0392	yeah
S0480	all in fee for the whole thing
S0392	oh i see yeah yeah where do you get the deputies from do you get them from an agency or be it just contact you know
S0480	erm just contact we know really erm i don't have we i think we once go through an agency i think for a guy on key and he be a super guy
S0392	yeah
S0480	i mean it's erm it do he he do a couple of gigs for us i think i think he do erm just on the back of the er of the float for the first ever erm race that we do
S0392	yeah
S0480	and he do a halloween gig up up at golf club again actually
S0392	yeah
S0480	i think yeah and er he be a he be a really nice guy and he be a good player and what he normally do be erm be sort of like a lounge piano man
S0392	yes
S0480	in hotels
S0392	i've be tempt to do that sometimes
S0480	yeah i er it doesn't appeal to me
S0480	in the slightest because nobody's really listen
S0392	i wouldn't mind that to be honest
S0480	would you not
S0392	no i would actually enjoy it yeah
S0480	i would find it soul destroy in the extreme
S0392	no no i be erm i go round to someone's house just these people in the village you know from from don't you
S0480	yeah yeah yeah
S0392	yeah and they've get a little digital piano and i just sort of walk over to it and they be all speak and i be play this thing and they be say how they'd be to a meal somewhere and they say that i be sort of sound like what their lounge man have be like and i think that might be quite good you just get your cash for the night there's no pressure at all cos as you say no one's listen to you
S0480	yeah
S0392	just a bite of fun to try a bite of jazz maybe try a bite of just a bite of improv as well i just think it might be a bite of fun
S0480	yeah i well i wouldn't erm i you know i wouldn't say a thing against it i mean this guy be make his live do it
S0392	yeah
S0480	erm it
S0392	it can be quite lucrative
S0480	it it it be you know i think he be quite well pay it i think he just find it a bite no i mean he wasn't really complain
S0392	yeah
S0480	he just find it a bite lonely in a way cos you turn up you play it
S0392	yeah
S0480	you you know
S0392	i couldn't do it as a as a job
S0480	you you you don't it be a job yeah
S0392	yeah
S0480	yeah
S0392	i wouldn't want it as a job i i would see it as just sort of like something i would do
S0480	yeah
S0392	in my part time
S0480	well the sort of thing you could throw in literally couldn't you and just just to earn an extra few quid every now and again
S0392	yeah
S0480	you'd probably do it when you're at uni
S0392	yeah yeah might even do it before maybe some time
S0480	yeah
S0392	if i find myself at a loose hen loose end one summer you would probably get the opportunity to play on some nice key as well
S0480	yes
S0392	some of those
S0480	yeah
S0392	venues will have really nice er steinways or er there's that new italian company that make grand pianos that be really really nice
S0480	oh really
S0392	a lot better yeah begin with an f er fazioli that's it
S0480	right oh i've never hear of this yeah
S0392	if you ever get the chance to even see a fazioli piano leap at it they're handmade
S0480	it's the business
S0392	in milan they've get a er not a warehouse a showroom in milan and they all cost i think the the bottom end one cost eighty thousand pound
S0480	how much
S0392	eighty thousand
S0480	crikey
S0392	and er at university
S0392	when i be there they in their sort of secondary auditorium they've get a fazioli piano
S0480	do you play it
S0392	i didn't get a chance exactly but i i want to
S0480	wow wow that's something isn't it
S0392	they've get this erm i think a lot of a lot of it's in the brand though the their logo be just sort of contemporary fazioli do you know what i mean it if if you saw it you'd know what i mean the sort of
S0480	oh right
S0392	yeah you get a lot of people although i didn't realise people who play steinways a lot of the time they don't actually pay for the steinway in the first place usually if you see someone play one it's because they be a steinway artist and that mean they call themself a steinway artist and then the company give them the piano to use and i think
S0480	right but it's not their piano
S0392	yeah fazioli can do a similar thing but i think it's if you be a venue you can become a fazioli venue
S0480	yeah
S0392	and then you can use it mm but yeah they're really good i always wonder how people who live at er you know the top of block of flats if they ever want a piano if you want to take one upstairs how be they ever manage to get those big grand pianos up
S0480	well it erm you'd crane it up wouldn't you and take it in through the er french windows on the basis that if you're rich enough to afford a grand piano
S0392	oh
S0480	you're rich enough to afford
S0392	yeah
S0480	the crane lift
S0480	to get it up there
S0392	yeah have say that i be look on ebay and there's a few go they're probably not much good at all a hundred quid hundred and fifty quid you know
S0480	oh for a normal piano
S0392	no for a grand
S0480	really
S0392	believe it or not yeah baby grands go for a hundred and fifty quid
S0480	good grief
S0392	and that erm that's buy it nows as well or sort of like on the last day of bid it's not just an open price they probably sound terrible and all out of tune and probably miss a a few key
S0480	course you can't i can't imagine anybody
S0392	well
S0480	sell a decent instrument for that little
S0392	no it'll be
S0480	you know
S0392	people who have die and their children
S0480	yeah
S0392	just want rid of it i imagine
S0480	maybe so yeah i mean batter old uprights
S0392	oh
S0480	you know you've get to pay to get rid of them
S0392	yeah
S0480	haven't you but
S0392	yeah yeah we've definitely come back from this way some time i think
S0480	have you
S0392	ask where we definitely come back from a gig this way cos i saw that branch of back there that i really recognise where might we have come back from
S0480	oh
S0392	might it be somewhere else maybe
S0480	oh
S0392	cos i i've never
S0480	think
S0392	drive down here before other than for gigs whenever i come to i come on the train
S0480	oh well i don't know way i i can't recall
S0392	it say there
S0480	do we yes there be
S0392	maybe
S0392	no
S0480	no
S0392	no
S0480	what
S0392	yeah i don't know why i say that even that be
S0392	that be a crazy you say at
S0392	crazy thing at twenty five to eleven but why would have have come back this way
S0480	be you sure it's not another
S0392	no it be definitely that one
S0480	oh right
S0392	might i have be to and come back this way
S0480	ah you might have be yes
S0392	right
S0480	yeah
S0392	that's answer
S0480	yeah
S0392	my question
S0480	yeah
S0392	i've definitely drive past that
S0480	oh right
S0392	it's
S0480	yeah you you
S0392	yeah
S0480	yeah yeah it'll be when you've be to or something
S0392	fireworks go off there i wonder what's happen
S0480	oh i think i saw a flash somewhere
S0392	yeah i think it
S0480	yeah
S0392	be just drive past the hedge but no there's some
S0480	yeah i know either that or erm civil war have break out in er
S0392	that might be to do with the devolution want to be part of
S0480	oh
S0392	and not part of
S0480	they
S0392	so they're have a big fight about it in
S0480	they'll be celebrate jeremy corbyn's
S0392	yeah
S0480	victory maybe
S0392	i think it's
S0480	or
S0392	more likely to be the
S0480	north be very conservative
S0392	yeah yeah
S0480	isn't it
S0392	save for bits of for north be even more so isn't it
S0480	yeah yeah
S0392	there's not a single labour councillor on the oh i think there be about six i saw and i think those be the two place if you want non conservative in north
S0480	yeah i yeah i'd have think certain 's
S0392	and maybe as well
S0480	oh really
S0392	yeah
S0480	yeah
S0392	it be i don't know if i tell you but i be have a look at the when i be work for the i be look at the health statistics that this woman give me to look at just something to do while my email load
S0480	the health statistics
S0392	and the biggest problem in health wise be erm skin cancer cos of apparently they've put this down to the fact that people take long expensive holiday who live in in the
S0480	oh
S0392	mediterranean which lead to that
S0480	well yeah i
S0392	it's abnormally high in compare to the rest of yorkshire and the rest of the country
S0480	really
S0392	yeah
S0480	well that's erm i mean that's a reasonable explanation isn't it
S0392	yeah
S0480	erm they or may not be the er correct one
S0392	yeah district their big problem be people under the age of twenty one be admit to accident and emergency and and i think that might be either to do with like agriculture or a lot of school who play sport think but a combination of those two children
S0480	people under twenty one
S0392	children break limbs break arm
S0480	oh right
S0392	sort of thing
S0480	yeah
S0392	a lot of break wrists
S0480	well that do sound like sport injuries doesn't it or the classic
S0392	yeah
S0480	break wrist one be slip in the winter isn't it
S0392	yeah so i'm try to think of what the other ones be and it be it be really interest to see district by district
S0480	to yeah
S0392	which be where poverty be as well in the county and where different demographics be
S0392	yeah yeah
S0480	scarborough's by far the poorest er district
S0480	be it
S0392	yeah
S0480	and i wouldn't have think so really for scarborough
S0392	no but it include
S0480	yeah i'm surprise
S0392	scarborough whitby and that sort of fringe coast closely follow by selby the richest one be oh i can't remember now i'm tempt to say but i'm not sure definitely scarborough be the poorest though and that's where a lot of the problems lie which be why they be say when they be try to persuade harrogate borough council or district or whatever to stay with them in the devolution they be say they'll have to come up with ways to persuade them and they be say don't mention
S0480	oh
S0392	scarborough
S0480	mm
S0392	oh that's right and then richmondshire be a lot of the military they be say be sort of the characteristic and a lot of the health problems be associate with that because you've get catterick garrison and a lot of those
S0480	yeah
S0392	in
S0480	yeah
S0392	richmond
S0480	i think you'd have a lot of psychiatric problems
S0392	yes yeah
S0480	yeah
S0392	trauma and things
S0480	yeah
S0392	it's interest he print off for me the this sort of dossier something like
S0392	forty page
S0392	all about but that's how er bad the it service be there i arrive on the monday and on wednesday afternoon i get my log in detail for the computer
S0480	oh
S0392	and er a few saturdays after have leave i could still log into my email
S0480	oh really
S0392	i have a dot gov dot uk email i be really proud of it be dot at dot government
S0480	you oh wow
S0392	dot gov dot uk
S0480	hey the big organisations though
S0392	yeah
S0480	they're just so slow move
S0392	yeah i go to this erm meet about the future of the county modern model office it be call and how we're all gonna run things in the future
S0480	yeah
S0392	instead of computers at each desk it have a little terminal which be wire connect there's no hard drive in it it wirelessly connect to a big data centre
S0480	yeah yeah be that like virtual
S0392	yeah
S0480	virtual desktop
S0392	they've
S0480	yeah
S0392	they've er they be all issue with these blackberry phone when blackberry be in vogue
S0480	right
S0392	and now they're not they're try to all go microsoft across the whole county
S0392	so they're all be issue with this like what me and you have yeah
S0480	oh i
S0392	yeah
S0480	i remember this i remember this yeah er one of er the lads at work his wife work for for the highways department
S0392	yeah
S0480	and they all get these flash phone
S0392	yeah
S0480	i you know when when smartphones be quite something
S0392	yeah er yeah because now they've all get to have windows the whole system be base on windows you have your email with microsoft you have your
S0480	yeah
S0392	they chat to each other on lync which be a microsoft thing and the whole website be basically
S0480	oh right
S0392	and now they're get windows phone as well and half of them be complain that they don't want another phone and it's not gonna be as good as the one they already have and half of them be complain cos they don't know how how they're gonna be able to use it
S0392	yeah so er
S0480	well you certainly can't please all the people all the time
S0392	yeah
S0480	in a in a scenario
S0392	yeah
S0480	like that can you
S0392	yeah and then you're they're all base around google so they've all get google gmail account they all use google document
S0480	yeah
S0392	google spreadsheets
S0480	yeah which be a separate system isn't it
S0392	yeah
S0480	and i i don't use that i just stick to excel
S0392	yeah i saw something and they say that you have to er submit something via a google doc cos then you can sort of share it and edit things on it they tend to be a lot more web base i've notice rather than sort of like erm microsoft word which be definitely base on your computer sort of software
S0480	yeah
S0392	you download expensive software you download nonetheless but still software
S0480	for what
S0392	microsoft word
S0480	yeah yeah it it be i've just buy a new laptop and they er
S0392	yeah
S0480	the basic office suite which be only word excel and project i think it be on the
S0392	be it powerpoint
S0480	with
S0392	maybe yeah it's a hundred quid
S0480	powerpoint yeah
S0392	that's it the twenty thirteen one
S0480	yeah and
S0392	who
S0480	i i don't know which version it be i pretty i presume it's
S0392	that that's the one that's a hundred quid
S0480	the latest yeah
S0392	at the moment yeah we get one from john lewis and they try to the the ticket price be a hundred and twenty five and i say hang that that's not right a hundred quid and it be a hundred quid for definite
S0480	oh yeah
S0392	i think they've i think so they
S0480	yeah it's a standard
S0392	take the twenty five off
S0480	it's the standard price isn't it
S0392	yeah
S0480	yeah
S0392	cos apple and microsoft they don't let you set your own price and so what they do be they take the twenty five quid off and send us a voucher in the post as well as like just as like
S0480	oh right
S0392	a gesture
S0480	oh that's good
S0392	yeah yeah but our school have just get a load of new computers this year and they're all fit up with microsoft 2013 office 2013 think how much that'll cos them well i mean they'll probably get a package of some sort but still
S0480	yeah oh oh i'm sure they will be even so
S0392	oh
S0480	it it's it's a big cost isn't it
S0392	yeah
S0480	a big cost
S0392	and last year they buy us all i don't know if you've hear of office 365 but that's like the online one for businesses they've get every student and every year seven and every staff member an account to that i never even know i have it so i couldn't use it so they
S0480	what when you be there
S0392	no this be at school last year
S0480	oh at school
S0392	yeah so
S0480	oh
S0392	believe it or not they get rid of that one it for this september they don't don't have that anymore
S0480	it change so quickly doesn't it
S0392	yeah
S0480	you know
S0392	they rush in and buy all the new stuff
S0480	yeah
S0392	and then
S0480	yeah
S0392	a year later they realise it be a mistake
S0480	it it wasn't the best stuff to get
S0392	yeah yeah yeah we've get a deputy head who's obsess with all technology and everything she love it really nice person but she's er
S0480	yeah
S0392	she like erm love cos be the first to get an ipad she's get a smartwatch and everything
S0480	oh really
S0392	the apple watch yeah
S0480	yeah
S0392	the other teachers be joke they in assembly say er have you see apple watch they be say they you know who get pay well at this school when the saw the deputy head
S0392	go round with theirs and yeah
S0480	gosh so how much be they i bet they're expensive
S0392	yeah i don't know how much they be
S0480	i've see stuff about them and i think
S0392	yeah
S0480	i've just not won't say i'm not the slightest interest i haven't
S0392	no
S0480	i at one time i hadn't the slightest interest in have a laptop or a smartphone
S0392	yeah
S0480	but you know time change don't they
S0392	yeah things like laptops and iphones and things you can see
S0480	i once oh look
S0392	oh oh yeah it's close gosh things like laptops and things you can see how gradually they take over and they become more popular with people but then things like smartwatches i can't see them catch on cos people like that traditional more executive watch look as well as something that do exactly what your phone do but a lot worse and a lot smaller
S0480	a lot what
S0392	well your your apple watch be
S0480	oh yeah
S0392	it's a bite useless isn't it
S0480	how how do you see it
S0392	be that small yeah you can
S0480	it's bad enough
S0392	you can check your texts but
S0480	on a phone
S0392	you can't reply cos there isn't a keyboard
S0480	no
S0392	i be read that the new ipads come out come with like a stylus pen to use instead of your finger but then all these journalists be pick up that the old you know steve job he sort of invest apple
S0480	yeah
S0392	his rule for his life be never to include a stylus with anything so they're go mad that they've
S0480	oh

S0392	yeah
S0480	she's go back to so
S0392	she's from
S0480	so yeah yeah
S0392	really that's a long way to travel
S0480	it be now i don't know whether she know the couple i i think
S0392	oh well
S0480	what
S0392	i get an email say that she be say our prefer photographer can only do the twelfth of september
S0480	oh right well it it may be that she's a pal then and her sister live in and she be gonna say with her sister but her her sister's go on holiday
S0392	oh
S0480	so she be drive down do the gig and then drive back and i think
S0392	yeah
S0480	god that be absolute donkey work cos she be when you're a photographer you're just you know she never hardly ever sit down
S0392	yeah
S0480	do she
S0392	yeah
S0480	she do actually get something to eat
S0392	yeah
S0480	at some point but
S0392	if i'd have be her i'd have be tempt to get the train rather than drive cos she only have one little wheelie suitcase
S0480	yeah
S0392	she maybe wouldn't have felt happy though be on a late night
S0480	yeah
S0392	train from to i don't know but
S0480	yeah that's an issue isn't it
S0392	that's what i would end up personally yeah
S0480	and i suppose you don't know when you're gonna finish
S0392	yeah that's the thing yeah
S0480	and all all those considerations but i oh
S0392	personally if i be by myself i'm quite easy go within myself i'd have be happy to wait but when you've get all this gear and you're with a lot of people it's
S0480	yeah
S0392	a lot easier to drive especially from rather than
S0480	i think you know if if i'd have be her i'd have try to get a bed for the night in
S0392	well we saw on the way in
S0480	in
S0392	didn't we that ibis
S0480	yeah
S0392	hotel
S0480	yeah
S0392	yeah
S0480	twenty odd quid bish bash bosh get the cab out to it mind you if she's a pal she'll be do it for nothing so
S0392	yeah oh right okay i see yeah
S0480	i don't know what a wed photographer cost these days
S0392	well my rs teacher he use to do wed videography and i saw he have on his website he have this package i think it be some something around how much we charge and he produce a video for you that's video though so i don't know
S0480	yeah
S0392	whether photography will be something similar i imagine but yeah so we must be get closer to home if that's there
S0480	sorry
S0392	i just saw a sign to there
S0480	yes we're not far now
S0392	so we must be get home
S0480	we're not far
S0392	yeah a168 be this or be we on the a1 at the moment
S0480	no we're on the 168
S0392	yeah
S0480	and we shall turn off down jolly old a19
S0392	yeah i like the a19
S0480	home to our song
S0392	yeah big fan of the a19
S0480	no it's good i i felt we play very well tonight
S0392	i think we do
S0480	and it wasn't that easy to hear
S0392	yeah
S0480	on the first couple
S0392	yeah yeah
S0480	cos we'd turn your mum up so loud i couldn't hear anything else
S0392	the problem with play there just at the end i could hear the raw sound come out of my fiddle great but i couldn't really hear the amp sound so i be play
S0480	no
S0392	as loud as i could think that that be it but forget all the time that i don't need to play loud because
S0480	yes
S0392	yeah er
S0480	yeah cos it's er the the the amp's
S0392	yeah
S0480	do your work for you
S0392	i still felt a bite more comfortable just play out a bite up upstairs i think there be there be nothing wrong with that the for the but yeah
S0480	upstairs be excellent i think we really play well upstairs really play well
S0392	yeah
S0480	i mean that's two gigs where we've just stand and play tune
S0392	yeah
S0480	after tune after tune after tune
S0392	and the one thing be it'll get a lot easier as well though
S0480	yeah well it's
S0392	you know
S0480	it's it's get easier for me i'm i'm far more comfortable with them now
S0392	yeah
S0480	after gigging them
S0480	hard
S0392	yeah that welcome home be a crowd pleaser
S0480	oh it be
S0392	yeah i love that slidey do on it
S0480	it be yeah
S0392	go into the b part i just think that's really great
S0480	oh yes
S0392	yeah
S0480	yeah i think it need the
S0392	with the
S0480	yeah down to b minor
S0480	yeah
S0392	yeah
S0480	yeah
S0392	and that b minor that's a bite of a trick i put in cos i realise that if you've get a minor at the start of the second section it just sort of hit them if you know what i mean that b minor chord hit them
S0480	it
S0392	it smash into them
S0480	yeah it's almost like a key change isn't it
S0392	yeah smash at them and they just and they're just they just can't help smile when they they don't realise that they've have that trick play on them
S0480	yeah
S0392	but in actual fact it's all intend nothing be not intend
S0480	oh so it be it's er it's a deliberate trick be it to go into
S0392	yeah
S0480	that minor well it's clever stuff
S0480	song write craft
S0392	it's it it's hard though you run out of ideas all of a sudden and the next one come along it's
S0480	mm that yeah it's good i like the close vamp as well like
S0392	yeah
S0480	i very often get lose in it
S0392	oh
S0480	for some i don't know why
S0392	it's really hard it's because the emphasis of the it's easy to play the melody where if you're accompany it it feel like a four two four time or four four but it's in three four it's really complicate it's a whole it's a strathspey so naturally it feel like it should be in four four and then the emphasis be sometimes on the second beat of the bar but it's write in three four so it's really technically a difficult chord to a difficult piece
S0392	yeah
S0480	to accompany
S0392	yeah it be yeah yeah i'll have to i know you say early on it's in three four and when we play it at the end i'd forget that i'll i'll have to erm
S0392	yeah it sort of go
S0480	think two three
S0392	one two three one two three
S0480	one two three
S0392	one yeah
S0480	one two three one two three
S0480	yeah
S0392	like that
S0480	yeah
S0392	but that one er
S0480	it be good
S0392	yeah
S0480	so a lot of people come up and say how much they enjoy it
S0392	oh good that welcome home as well it's completely when i first hear about the pentatonic scale you know er
S0480	yeah
S0392	which be really interest really i could spend hours just talk about that itself but that's that whole piece be just base around the pentatonic scale i be sort of hum it around in my head and it sort of spat that out because it's really what it be it's the sort of the scale that's ingrain in our head from the day we're bear and a lot of people have say
S0480	be it pentatonic yeah
S0392	study have show that the pentatonic scale it come up in every culture in the world independently of itself and a lot of
S0480	really
S0392	animals replicate it as well yeah and so
S0480	i didn't know i didn't know that i mean
S0392	which be probably another reason why it's a people enjoy it
S0480	it's a it's a it's a you know it's a guitarist's scale for
S0392	yeah
S0480	for melodic improvisation
S0392	yeah yeah
S0480	it doesn't have any minors in do it
S0392	yeah
S0480	for that sort of
S0480	no
S0392	blue sound
S0480	or it doesn't flatten the
S0392	well it it sort of like you what you can get be a fifth all the fifths on top of each other they're put in order so d and the five note above it make a and then five note above it make e and then as soon as you get back round to d again you all the note that you've come across you put them in order and it make the pentatonic scale
S0480	mm
S0392	as well there's no semitones in it
S0480	no
S0392	so in a normal scale and f sharp and g between those two you've get a semitone but if in the pentatonic scale there's none of those
S0480	yeah yeah they're all
S0392	oh
S0480	whole no certainly yeah
S0392	yeah whole note be bigger if you ever get a chance and you're on the internet and you're a bite bore have a look at the er pentatonic scale i think it be a ted conference t e d conference some neuroscience conference and it's jamaican i think he's jamaican reggae style singer slash musicologist come on and he do an experiment with the audience and it's really interest and he do the pentatonic scale and he prove how it's in everyone's head and it's really good he sort of improvise around it
S0480	oh wow
S0392	jump around you've get to have a look at it someone show me it i think that's where i first learn about the pentatonic scale really but it show you how it's well how it's just in in all our head without us realise it
S0480	i oh that's interest it's yeah
S0392	yeah t e d er pentatonic scale that's all you really need to put in
S0480	t e right i'll have a look at that that sound interest i i'd no idea that it be inbuilt
S0392	no you'll recognise the man i think i think he's quite well know i didn't but some say he's well know and the tune he hum along as well be actually quite catchy and quite good and he get the audience to sing the chord that he's do which be a note on the scale and he say at the end everywhere i've do that and these be not musicians in the audience they're all scientists and he say
S0480	yeah
S0392	wherever i've
S0480	yeah
S0392	do that it's always work yeah it's a shame we never have any cash from them but you'll have to wait a few days for that
S0480	oh well it won't hurt
S0392	i think they're just quite disorganise people to be honest
S0480	i think they erm they be obviously run themselves
S0392	oh
S0480	themselves into the grind
S0392	yeah that fella at the start keep go on about how or be it the woman go on at how late they always be to things the humanist lady
S0480	oh yeah yeah
S0392	the british humanist association of england lady
S0480	they be the the best man say the er he say they'd be
S0392	yeah
S0480	very successful but they ever get out of bed in time
S0392	yeah yeah i mean why not why not like definitely
S0480	well if you can do it
S0392	he he seem like an interest chap as well i think he work for british rail and
S0480	yeah
S0392	it's a good idea what they do with remotes in curry pc world be it or dixons
S0480	nice one
S0392	as it be
S0480	nice one
S0392	go and get a remote control and turn all the volume down
S0480	yeah or up
S0392	if
S0480	or
S0392	yeah
S0480	change the
S0392	yeah
S0480	channel up that that must be a gas do that
S0392	i i wonder if they get catch that would have be an interest way to finish the story if they'd be catch or what have happen to them or if they do get their product back at the end but it be
S0480	yeah
S0392	somehow completely destroy cos i'm sure a lot of tvs can pick up any remote really cos you can get those ones for all ones at argos
S0480	you can get universal ones can't you
S0392	yeah
S0480	yeah
S0392	er even like sky remotes people pay twenty five quid for a brand sky one and then at argos you can pick up one for four ninety nine
S0392	it might not have the sky logo on but it do the job
S0480	but it do the trick yeah well it's only a radio transmitter isn't it
S0392	yeah
S0480	when all be
S0392	yeah
S0480	say and do or be it
S0392	oh
S0480	infrared be it line of sight
S0392	er oh
S0480	ours it ours at home be line of sight so i think it might be infrared
S0392	they don't yeah i think you might be right actually there yeah infrared would be a lot safer than radio i'd have think it's just that bite towards the centre
S0480	yeah
S0392	of the spectrum
S0480	yeah
S0392	oh so i'm try to think we get teach a mnemonic of how to remember it it go
S0480	oh
S0392	rabbit which be r erm what's the next one yeah that's it rabbit's mate in very excite extraordinary garden or something and that do the whole spectrum from infrared
S0392	no sorry from er rabbit's radio mate microwave in infrared then visible very excite be er oh no unusual that's it ultraviolet
S0480	violet yeah
S0392	and erm extraordinary garden which be x ray gamma ray
S0480	oh brilliant
S0392	it's good isn't it yeah
S0480	yeah
S0392	i don't know about the tv i think there's something like more word for a tv remote than anything else really aren't there if you think about it
S0480	more word for
S0392	a tv remote everyone's get their own little bite of slang for it
S0480	yeah oh yeah
