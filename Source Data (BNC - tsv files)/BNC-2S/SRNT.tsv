S0281	so how be you do
S0144	i'm alright
S0281	what's so funny
S0144	huh er nothing yeah so you be say about the scotland thing
S0281	well yeah i mean it's gonna be really big isn't it just wonder if everybody er you know people have think about the ramifications of the yes
S0144	mm
S0281	i mean presumably if if they say no
S0144	mm
S0281	then erm there will be benefit you know and all the top politicians have say they're go to get more regional power and you know all the rest of it
S0144	mm
S0281	but if they say no then er i don't know what do you think
S0144	er well like i think they're gonna say no that's what everything's indicate
S0281	you reckon
S0144	yeah
S0281	i dunno
S0144	cos
S0281	i mean there's a poll the other day say they're the yes vote be fifty two percent to fifty or
S0144	oh really
S0281	yeah
S0144	oh okay
S0281	but no to forty eight i think one poll say they be four point ahead
S0144	uh okay erm well
S0281	in fact today i saw er another report i think it be in the guardian that erm it really be more split down the middle and that the way it's go to be be decide be gonna be on the the don't know people how haven't actually
S0144	yeah
S0281	make up their mind
S0144	yeah cos that's
S0281	it's that close
S0144	that's about six percent isn't it or something don't know yeah yeah like don't think i've not don't know how interest i be in it really cos i don't know it's not gonna affect me and
S0281	well it be
S0144	be it
S0281	well yeah
S0144	how
S0281	well if scotland leave right then erm if you should ever want to go to scotland i don't know if you ever would do but i mean would you need a passport to get in
S0281	erm would you need er some money to er set their their own currency to get there
S0144	yeah
S0281	erm on a on a national level er both economies be gonna be er affect by it
S0144	yeah
S0281	i mean already er the financial institutions er say they're gonna pull out er from scotland
S0144	yeah
S0281	erm and erm i mean also in term of erm the the british logo i mean what's britishness gonna mean any more
S0144	mm that's true yeah i i think scotland be the ones that be gonna suffer eventually i i i think i think they've get it cushty at the moment they way they've get the deal with london i mean free education at university education you know they really be they gonna be able to keep that i dunno erm but i be think i i would i be look at the exchange rate with the pound cos the pound's devalue as well because of all this
S0281	really
S0144	erm because of the uncertainty of it
S0281	mm
S0144	and i be think i wish i'd send a load of money back cos if if they er if they say no then the value of the pound be gonna shoot up again isn't it
S0281	erm
S0144	i reckon so it would have be a good time to change some money
S0281	i don't know do do this have to be on to be for it to be record
S0144	eh
S0281	because have we be talk just four minutes
S0144	yeah
S0281	oh okay
S0144	yeah i don't think it have to be on i mean my one switch off when it's still record and even even if someone else erm if i get a message or something come through
S0281	yeah doesn't affect it
S0144	yeah it still it still get i don't know what your phone do just check it at the end i suppose
S0281	yeah i suppose so
S0144	should be alright it's still go
S0281	yeah okay right
S0144	yeah so what how soon be they gonna find out the result do you know
S0281	i don't know that's one thing that i i haven't hear but erm there's i think there's gonna be a a bite of a transition period i mean if they do say yes
S0144	mm
S0281	i mean if that that's gonna be huge
S0144	mm yeah
S0281	i think it's gonna affect us i actually haven't think it through to be honest but er i think it's gonna affect us all more than you say ah i don't care
S0144	mm
S0281	it wont affect me but i i think it will cos it'll affect the the i be gonna say british economy but we're
S0144	mm
S0281	i mean the english economy
S0281	erm
S0144	mm
S0281	but in if you're a scot er today i mean the i suppose this be come from the no camp
S0144	mm
S0281	that erm er the national health service that that would be effect
S0144	mm
S0281	erm and er there's something else i cant remember that be have a negative effect on it
S0144	yeah i mean would they still have the nhs
S0281	well presumably no
S0144	yeah yeah so i don't know i mean what do be independence like an absolute clean break or can they still transfer some of the systems across i don't know
S0281	well yeah it it be as it say independence for scotland so
S0144	yeah
S0281	they would have to presumably apply for membership of the eu
S0144	mm
S0281	which isn't i mean it i should imagine that they would
S0144	mm
S0281	get accept but erm there be other countries with er issue you know like spain
S0144	mm
S0281	er they've get a separatist movement with
S0144	mm mm
S0281	basques
S0144	mm
S0281	there's belgium
S0144	mm
S0281	well erm where do this stop
S0144	yeah but i think it's a good thing break down rather than become one global super state
S0281	well
S0144	i i prefer it go in that direction than the other direction
S0281	i i tend to think the opposite point of view really
S0144	yeah
S0281	yeah because i'm i mean idealistically
S0144	mm
S0281	i think we should be break down border and barriers instead of erect them
S0144	yeah idealistically yeah but i mean what i worry about be if you take away the then you're gonna have one government for for everyone
S0144	which
S0281	ah well that that's never gonna happen be it
S0144	erm i don't know i don't know
S0281	well how how would it happen
S0144	mm well first of all you'd have eu and then like an asian kind of union and north america union which they're kind of get into place already and that would have one kind of level above that as well i dunno
S0281	yeah i'll have to look into the
S0144	mm
S0281	crystal ball about that but
S0144	yeah
S0281	whenever that come around i wont be here to see it
S0144	but then yeah scotland as well would they lose they'd have to build all these trade agreements wouldn't they with the countries as well
S0281	but
S0144	but they wouldn't have the uk trade agreements with china and they'd have to presumably set up all their own import export agreements with all these different countries
S0281	well presumably yeah any international agreements with the uk
S0144	mm
S0281	would then be presumably invalid for scotland
S0144	yeah
S0281	but there again would it still be valid for the uk
S0281	because the uk would no
S0144	be no longer
S0281	wouldn't be the same as before
S0144	yeah
S0281	i mean there be you know
S0281	the jimmy cliff song
S0281	there be more question than answer
S0144	yeah i gah i dunno i haven't really i haven't really look into it really
S0281	mm
S0144	i've always think oh they'll just vote no
S0281	no the two scots we know and you know they're on opposite side
S0144	be they
S0281	mm you don't know them
S0144	no
S0281	be vehemently er on the no side
S0144	mm
S0281	he think it's gonna be an absolute disaster
S0281	if they vote yes and er i haven't er er speak to her about it but from what tell me he he say that she's strongly for it
S0281	you know
S0144	mm who be i don't know
S0281	erm she's get very strange erm surname or something she's a very tall thin lady
S0144	where do she work

S0281	oh right okay
S0144	think he's from inverness or
S0281	so and he say he when he be back there he say you know the the gut reaction of the most of the people he speak to be he say there's no doubt it's gonna be a yes
S0144	really
S0281	yeah that's what he say
S0144	yeah i think maybe it's people round edinburgh that be the kind of nos
S0281	it could be regional i've see regional map
S0144	mm

S0144	i guess yeah when you get start get to the highlands and can see all them vote yes

S0144	mm
S0281	if all the kid be cos i've i've teach kid before but
S0144	yeah
S0281	but not that level you know it's too you know
S0144	well it's a bite of a change isn't it from what you've be do really
S0281	yes
S0144	well it's a completely different job really isn't it it's not you you call it teach but it's not it's not really under the same umbrella be it its more entertain i suppose
S0281	well i mean i i i just i just shouldn't never have happen
S0281	but yeah several different options come up you know
S0144	yeah
S0281	see what happen

S0144	oh okay be she still do that
S0281	yeah well she start again last night after two months

S0144	yeah
S0281	do you hear about that
S0144	yeah i dunno i dunno
S0281	what she tell me again be be er something that sound like up with the way i have this interview where somebody have get this idea for this coffee bar but it be on here where you live somewhere
S0144	mm
S0281	so there's no pass trade
S0144	no it's all gonna be from the uni which i think i've tell her i think it's she's gonna be on dangerous grind because it's work you know it's not do a little thing on the side it's actually start a business on the doorstep of your employee employer
S0281	but she wouldn't be she didn't tell me she be actually think about start a business she be
S0144	well no she's gonna put it through channel so it isn't actually her but she's gonna be do class
S0281	well she be talk to me about the possibility of erm take on the coffee bar part of it
S0144	i'd have i lose track of what 's do
S0281	yeah i know i know
S0144	and then she just she flit between these ideas
S0281	it's amaze i don't i don't know where she get it from cos she she's get she's be work website
S0144	mm
S0281	you know for for yoga
S0144	yeah i saw that yeah it look quite good
S0281	and
S0144	she put a lot of work into it
S0281	then there's this idea about er erm the other website erm that she's get together about teach teachers
S0144	well yeah
S0281	erm apparently she tell me last night somebody contact her about that i don't she hadn't speak to her about it for so long that i think it be she'd almost forget about it and then she say this weekend she's she's start a doctorate
S0144	mm
S0281	so i dunno she she's fill her life with all these things i don't know if she's gonna cope with it and
S0144	yeah i mean yeah she need to pick one thing and work on that i think mm yeah she's do this it's like a one year doctorate thing isn't it it's not like a phd it's a
S0281	one year one
S0144	well it's a what be it erm it's like a diploma i i'm not sure what it i'm not sure what it be
S0281	no i think it she tell me it be a phd
S0144	but i think it's a one year er i dunno i dunno it's the ed ed doc be it or some or i dunno ah i don't know i don't know what she's do kinda stop ask really
S0281	mm
S0144	it's different every time i ask
S0281	yeah well the adjective scatterbrain you know
S0281	come to mind
S0144	yeah
S0281	well i get her i finally get her to admit that she turn her phone off or the sound down you know
S0281	before she be try to give me all this bullshit about oh i put it in my bag and it turn itself off
S0281	you know like it's get a mind of its own
S0144	yeah so how be
S0281	ah well again
S0144	last time i very
S0281	very worry aspect
S0281	there's erm well there's that we go back again er on er sunday i think it be er for a second test and they say you've gotta go back again in another two weeks for another test
S0144	right
S0281	but i don't know it if she because we talk to her sometimes and like she doesn't answer us
S0144	mm
S0281	be it just because she doesn't want to or be it she she doesn't hear
S0144	mm
S0281	so it's difficult and then she's get this more or less semi permanent problem with er it's cold or be it pollution
S0144	mm
S0281	well that and
S0144	mm
S0281	she's she's cough and then she's develop this erm like cod this compulsive obsessive disorder thing where erm which vary i mean sometimes it's
S0144	squint yeah
S0281	squint blink thing
S0144	yeah
S0281	and when i sort of tell her that she's get to stop you know make daddy happy stop do this
S0144	mm
S0281	and she do and then she's get this other thing about keep pull her dress up like this
S0144	right
S0281	to shoulder and sometimes go like this
S0144	mm
S0281	and you know all combine i think well what
S0144	what's go on
S0281	yeah it's a it's a it's a er be it physical be it psychosomatic be it er sign of mental problems
S0144	mm
S0281	i don't know but
S0144	maybe it stem from if she have get problems with her ears maybe its knock her confidence erm
S0281	well she'd do fairly well at school
S0144	yeah
S0281	erm and i ask her the other day i be i be erm do you remember from the couple series the with the the sock
S0144	yeah
S0281	just talk to you
S0281	do you remember that one
S0144	yeah yeah
S0281	so i do that with her i i put one of my sock on my hand
S0281	and get her to talk to the sock erm and do a funny voice
S0281	er like erm so she wasn't actually
S0144	yeah
S0281	talk directly to me
S0144	yeah
S0281	and ask her you know if she be happy at school cos now she's board and she say yeah fine and what be the other girls like erm felt well they're alright erm except one snore
S0281	and er so i say what about your teacher be she nice say yeah erm do you like her yeah and there be no problems no so
S0144	mm
S0281	i don't know so the i mean for me there be only two source possible source of er for the problem one be school or one be home
S0144	mm
S0281	and she obviously like me she doesn't want to be a boarder
S0144	mm
S0281	it's her mother's decision really
S0144	do you have like teachers' days and things like parents' even what
S0281	mm well there be a teachers' day the other day wasn't there
S0144	the teachers have give you any any feedback on you know how she be in class and
S0281	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0144	and that's all positive
S0281	well yeah it's quite good
S0144	yeah
S0281	mm
S0144	ah it's difficult isn't it i mean i think i be always a worry for my parent you know cos i be always really quiet and i be and i be always popular cos i be always good at sport and you i always i always do well at school but i i always felt i always want to be even though i wasn't but i always kind of want to be so i just kinda sit there in class not say anything and not answer question and things and and for me yeah for me that be cos of my upbringing cos i live with weird stuff go on i suppose
S0281	mm
S0144	and it be my confidence
S0281	mm
S0144	that affect it but i dunno man try to get inside a kid's head at that age be be pretty hard especially when they're quite guard
S0281	mm
S0144	yeah
S0281	i mean her mother say to her the other day why why didn't you tell me you know you have this problem with your ear and of course she's she's scar you know
S0144	mm
S0281	because a couple of years back three years i think it be we yeah take her up to erm erm main hospital to get her check and receive the fright of her life when they they find this erm blockage and right up the top of the nose and they weren't sure whether it be er something that be at the top of the nose grow up or it be something from the brain come down
S0144	oh my god
S0281	yeah
S0281	well you can imagine how we felt
S0144	yeah
S0281	and er they do some test and erm thankfully i mean we find out it wasn't come down
S0144	yeah
S0281	so it be a growth there and they give us medicine to reduce it and erm but er
S0144	so do that really affect her or it affect you
S0281	well it effect all of us all three of us erm
S0144	so maybe you know it could be something
S0281	i mean my wife think it's a total waste of time and money
S0144	mm
S0281	erm she have an operation
S0144	ah
S0281	and the medicine seem to work but now we've get a recurrence of er nose problem
S0144	mm
S0281	and chest now
S0144	mm
S0281	but i mean how much of that be
S0144	mm but i mean chest that could be if she's not i dunno if she's not breathe properly then
S0281	constantly cough
S0144	yeah
S0281	this cough constant cough
S0144	mm
S0281	but i say to her the other night look i say i want you to
S0144	but that can be kind of ocd as well
S0281	well it can be i say and i put my hand on her chest and i say look now stop please stop this
S0144	yeah
S0281	and and she do you know
S0144	yeah
S0281	and and and the you know the movement with the shoulder i have my hand quite strongly on the shoulder to stop her move
S0144	mm
S0281	and she eventually do
S0144	mm
S0281	so i i don't know whether
S0144	something's bother her eh mm yeah maybe she's worry about something maybe worry about i mean if she's get the stuff again with her nose maybe she's worry about that
S0281	oh well i mean she's really scar about hospitals you know
S0144	mm
S0281	i mean when we go for the go for the test the other day
S0144	mm
S0281	she be right within the hospital but of course you know we have another blood test again
S0144	mm
S0281	and er she's very brave about it but erm she's she do have a fear i mean she be but she's frighten of everything
S0144	mm
S0281	she she won't go to the well i mean under duress of go to the bathroom on her own
S0144	really
S0281	yeah and when when she get in there all the light have gotta come on even the light of the heat in the shower
S0144	really
