S0144	right okay so what be we gonna try and change first
S0024	i need to change this thing that it say two thousand and thirteen i want to edit it so that nobody can see it can i go on yours to see what i can see as a student of yours
S0144	yeah
S0024	i'll enrol in yours you enrol in mine and then
S0144	see i don't even know how to do that how do i enrol in yours
S0024	i that that actually i think that might be the first thing we need to do isn't it not do this edit we need to change the students
S0144	maybe we should go to the er train sessions what time be it
S0024	it's at two o'clock that you have to register
S0144	two o'clock you have to register
S0024	i can't cos i haven't do the milk
S0144	oh
S0024	i'm pretend i know what i'm do which mean teach myself if you go to the train session you can come back and teach me
S0144	mm but i remember last year the train session be useless and i didn't come away with anything
S0024	well if you can't do it it's if we can't do it then it's
S0144	i just find it really confuse
S0024	it's definitely different it look easier doesn't it
S0144	it yeah it
S0024	well maybe
S0144	look better than it do last year
S0024	yeah
S0144	but i didn't use moodle last year
S0024	i do a little bite
S0144	i just prefer use it use my email just find it a lot easier
S0024	i think once it's one of those things once you know how to use it
S0144	yeah
S0024	it's oh except my internet's just too slow to be able to do anything do oh it's do you think it's cos i've get the proxy on
S0144	well i've get a proxy on
S0024	oh i haven't get the proxy on
S0144	i've get a proxy on
S0024	you've get a proxy on and yours be work faster
S0144	yeah so how how do i get a picture on my home page or like a welcome screen or something
S0024	yeah well that's yeah we've get to write a welcome message i don't think
S0144	but where
S0024	oh god maybe we should go to the
S0144	i haven't get a clue
S0024	we need to go to the train mm or we need to like watch a few er
S0144	there's a help thing here look
S0024	a few moodle help videos
S0144	i'd rather to be honest just learn myself cos sit there and just watch someone do it yeah you can take note but the only way to learn it properly be to do it yourself
S0024	participants oh look how many participants i've get oh where have all my students go
S0144	yeah well they be last year's students
S0024	yeah but that's what they be say you have to delete your last year students mine have already select themselves from me because i wasn't there all the

S0144	just look at the page so where do i need no i need to write all this down i don't look a dickhead in class
S0024	no that's why we need to spend some time do it
S0144	well we need to download the
S0024	that's what this week be for really isn't it
S0144	yeah
S0024	i can't believe that do you remember in in erm er in the listen brief
S0144	mm
S0024	listen and speak brief and that guy i don't know who he be who be he he say well surely we need to if er if we're change the examination to a one on one we're gonna have to have knowledge of the topics
S0144	mm
S0024	it's like how long have you work here and do the same book
S0144	yeah
S0024	what and what he say well if you're gonna teach it you're gonna know something you don't need to know really the detail
S0144	yeah it's probably it's
S0024	and do you see his face he be
S0144	no
S0024	sit right in front i don't know cos you might have be block by somebody in front of you
S0024	he be like no like shake his head like no why would i know anything about what i so
S0144	come on it's only base on like two read article
S0024	yeah
S0144	you'd find out what exam you're do and just read the article
S0024	oh my god
S0144	jesus what a loser
S0024	yeah so well if that's your attitude and he must have be here a lot earlier than us i think so he's already teach the course
S0144	yeah he's be here he's be here years
S0024	so he must know that book inside out
S0144	yeah it's good that they've upgrade all the wi fi in the class so
S0024	oh yeah
S0144	students can all bring their laptops now
S0024	yeah how be you gonna how be you gonna do that
S0144	well it depend on the class doesn't it but you can tell them
S0024	i need
S0144	to bring them they don't have to have them out every lesson
S0024	yeah
S0144	do i press record on this
S0024	it be hard to do erm
S0144	yeah
S0024	it's hard to suddenly change like to everybody have laptops in front of them do work
S0144	mm
S0024	it's i find that kind of class really hard to prepare for like and how it's gonna go and
S0144	yeah it kind of make it may be harder for group work kind of create barriers between people
S0024	what physical barriers
S0144	well yeah
S0024	mm
S0144	and you kind of focus more on your computer don't you rather than who's sit next to you
S0024	yeah
S0144	chinese students kind of do that anyway erm but it would be good for when we're later in the write course when they're like correct each other's work that would be quite good cos they'll be able to edit it actually on the computer and they have a record of there rather than
S0024	what do actually all the write task on a computer
S0144	why not well oh
S0024	well because their exam be handwritten
S0144	yeah i don't know
S0024	the exam be handwritten and half of them need to practice their handwrite cos you can't if you can't read it
S0144	yeah and their spell as well if there's spell you know
S0024	yeah
S0144	auto correct or something
S0024	unless they've get unless you can find a programme on the internet you know just like a not a photoshop you know where you can take a photo of your work send it to send it to your friend next to you on email and you can draw all over it but then
S0144	mm
S0024	what's the point
S0024	then you're do exactly the same as use a pen
S0144	mm
S0024	mm anyway where be we where do you say we'll gotta go freshers' week
S0144	yeah
S0024	i've get to get my computer fix too this week i need to go

S0024	yeah
S0144	just just to erm put it on my pdpr
S0024	mm

S0024	oh okay well let's
S0144	come on events there's the eap toolkit
S0024	just general
S0144	et yeah shall i have a look how that's different to the
S0024	i don't think you can access it without the
S0144	no but do it split into more than just listen
S0024	thirty to forty minutes of learn activity around a particular learn point doesn't say do it
S0144	so
S0024	you have to go right the way in
S0144	we'll have to have a look
S0024	to find out
S0144	at those cos you could spend a whole lesson just talk about this
S0024	principal or principle
S0144	couldn't you
S0024	yeah
S0144	before you'd get familiar with it
S0024	well if they've all get wi fi in their computers they can all sit there and really have a look at it
S0144	mm
S0024	they need time don't they
S0144	yeah er i'd give them like half an hour just half an hour just have a look through some of these and get familiar with them
S0024	yeah don't need a quiz or anything do they
S0144	no
S0024	no they're adults
S0144	i mean they well they don't have to do it in class but it will make them do it wouldn't it and they won't half of them wouldn't do it if you just say do it in your own time
S0024	yeah
S0144	cos i remember last year
S0024	well
S0144	the first week it's kind of a lot of the time be waste
S0024	get them to log in and stuff
S0144	just
S0024	yeah well and then when i get to whoever do the freshers' week of my students last year they didn't get them to sign up to to the to the to the i you've get
S0144	i mean that that be
S0024	erm
S0144	thrust down our throats to do that

S0024	i'm sure i still have students that weren't sign to no no no not to and to to to to oh no
S0144	no professional
S0024	i'm think of a different university

S0144	there's one teacher cos last semester we have to split it didn't we or last year we have to split it
S0024	yeah what happen i can't
S0144	because there be two introduction things one for the teacher and one for the teacher erm but one but the two activities weren't assign to a particular class so there be a danger that you would both do the same introduction in class so you have to liaise with the other teacher just to find out what one they be do
