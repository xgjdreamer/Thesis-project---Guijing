S0261	well i at the time i would have be talk about erm particular well not talk about i would have be talk of particular character that i be work with yeah
S0262	be they likeable character
S0261	not really
S0262	no they didn't sound very likeable so you're say it's more complicate than that
S0261	well i i i think more the point be that it be erm simply er if you're dissatisfy in your job and you're not get the opportunities that you're look for either there's a problem on your side or there's a problem on the other side yeah and the fact be be that the two of you don't meet somewhere in a zone where you can work together and part of that will be poor management that i have an awareness of what i think modern management be and the people that i be work with didn't operate under modern management they operate what i would have think be cold hard old boy style old school management style you know
S0262	i know but i love the fact that also you and use to go down to the pub every single fuck with a rebellious you know spirit which be i'll fuck turn into work when i want if i don't fuck go into work who care i'm a fuck contractor i'll go when i want to go there's something that change in you and you get different you go different about things you get more serious about things and it be around the time you meet me
S0261	erm well what change be that i go from be a contractor to be erm a a one of the people on the book with the company and part of the reason for it be that i could see as a contractor people wouldn't choose to take you seriously and allow you to grow in the sense that you need to
S0262	but but contractor suit you in your early i mean sorry your late twenties because you be your own man you have your own company you know that woman be do the account for you i'm not quite sure who it be or if that you be still actually run your own show you be in control
S0261	to be to be fair yeah i suppose you be
S0262	you fuck totally be
S0261	mm mm yeah you could choose where you want to work and all that sort of stuff
S0262	you be run through the book yourself you be do you know you be do what you want
S0261	yeah
S0262	and you just go and buy nice expensive cameras you have lovely holiday you do what you want to do that be the point
S0261	yes exactly
S0262	you never
S0261	yeah it's a very valid it's an interest valid point
S0262	really interest in the work really come on be honest with yourself you weren't all that interest really the time when you be hang out with you weren't that interest in your work
S0261	if you put that aside look the the fact be be quite a lot of the time when i turn up to work i would do a good job cos i be still at work
S0262	i'm not say you didn't
S0261	alright
S0262	when do i say that you didn't do a good job
S0261	and for the majority of the time while i be do that i i enjoy the job because i be work with people that i like yeah and
S0262	that's very true about you
S0261	er and and so there be there be a sense of partnership and we get along alright and then of course things change the management change and roles change and so on and so on and so on and you come across different people and different character and so on you know and and part of the role be try to mix and match and fit in between the reality be that when you come home that's when you let the steam out when you're at work you act professional when you need to and and otherwise erm you're probably relax and get along with people
S0262	yeah but why do that bloke the other the work for pb in why do he rise up the rank so fuck quickly why the fuck do he have it all
S0261	ah because he be a he be a chatter
S0262	and and you and others didn't get that fuck chance why do he get it then
S0261	well i mean that happen in all company you know they they
S0262	be he really that much better than you
S0261	there be young young people
S0262	young people he wasn't that much younger than you
S0261	well no erm five years or something like that okay
S0262	well fuck you mean he be that switch on that he need to to to butter it all up
S0261	look the simple the simple point of it and and you make it before be that erm he be one of these people who could erm talk himself up that he have the ability to market himself in front of everybody and er and that all start fairly straight forwardly and and these things people notice one day he be work as a courier and he knock on the front door to deliver a parcel and he notice that it be a company that be an engineer company he say i've get a degree in aeronautical engineer and no job go on that that's why i'm do this have you guy get any job go and they say well pop round and we'll have a chat and that's how it start yeah so he obviously
S0262	aeronautical engineer
S0261	and he yeah and he have now become a charter civil engineer and er have his own patch within the company you know and he's a specialist in some particular things and that's because he choose a certain line to go down and from his point of view he might find that he get rather bore with that but what he's sell be a product that for a company be saleable around the world
S0262	mm
S0261	erm he have expertise in it and until the the the the environment change so that product be no longer focus or our money isn't spend on it by government and so on and it's all about public transport then he will still have a job in it he might not enjoy do it day in and day out but he get on and he do it cos from my point of view if you do something forever for a long time it get a bite bore erm if it's something i'm passionate about it won't because i will just continue to learn more and if he's interest in something call bus rapid transit and that rock his boat and he want to spend his career do that then fine but you wouldn't find me do it more than five years i would go i'll give it a shoot and then i would have have to find something else to do and and part of it come off the back of probably something a lecturer say when i be at uni which be don't do job for more than five years
S0262	why do you not pursue the land survey
S0261	well when i come from new zealand to erm to to england it wasn't the same job the same job didn't exist erm we have a very project management base role when we be work in new zealand and then when we get to england the reality of it be in in england they use the work surveyor for a variety of different things you could be a plumber and be a surveyor you could be a build surveyor you could be a land surveyor you could be erm you you could be electrical surveyor you know you could be an insurance surveyor all of these kind of things and he use it in its true sense but the thing be be in new zealand surveyor and in australia surveyors be important because they be the people who set out the land they be the people who do a lot of exploration and adventure up front
S0262	yeah yeah
S0261	so erm a lot of what we have be train in didn't apply in the same context in the uk
S0262	so do you feel actually that be a right bugger in a way you know what i mean because you weren't use your expertise that you have start in hamilton as a job you'd get quite good at it yeah from what i can tell you you still have your surveyor mat today
S0261	well i become a charter surveyor
S0262	right so and you know and people you know i know they're friends but they're also professionals still work in their field be still land surveyor and charter surveyors so you kind of know what the picture be in new zealand from have that kind of you you know you're not right in there with them but you've get you've get so do you feel like sometimes a bite fuck like oh you know i could have go this way and stay in new zealand have you not go to the uk and i i could've just actually get really fuck good at something that i think i think i love at the time or do you never love land survey so where you felt that you be much kind of like hard do by that you know you kinda go oh you know actually well yeah no
S0261	er i think there be a bigger thing erm i i i give it a crack and em there would be a lot more that i would've learn along the way and that would have involve me need to to do a different job et cetera et cetera and the time i leave be the time to leave
S0262	be it be it not go too well
S0261	well it wasn't that wasn't the point the point be be erm i i always have this kind of goal which be i've be through uni and er education all of this time and then i've go straight out of that into work there be no break it be leave uni straight to work kind of thing and then i do that for three years and in that time i get my charter thing yeah so you know in england they have a gap year and lot of people make use of it
S0262	after you fuck around for age like i do yeah
S0261	yeah mm but a lot of people use it for for a good reason and that be to have break from the system
S0262	well i do use it for some good reason you know i get my degree and i go off
S0261	no not just you but a lot of people
S0262	no no no you're right but i'm actually a product of what you're talk about but i get a as you know i get a first class degree in business
S0261	yes
S0262	what do i do i go and become an au pair for a fuck year so people do make their own decisions right about what they're go to fuck do rightly or wrongly but you didn't you go and do the sensible thing which be go and get a job get your chartership and you could have actually just stay there
S0261	yes i could have but my interest be in explore the world
S0262	some people do yeah some people stay didn't they some of your mat stay
S0261	yeah but also some some some of them explore the world too and then they go back to what it be about
S0262	for a year or two and they come back
S0261	mm be away for five or six years
S0262	yeah but some of the others
S0261	as an example
S0262	some of the others just you know dip their toe in the water and come back
S0261	erm
S0262	no nobody be away as long as you be or have be
S0261	no i don't think well there be some that be still away that's not true
S0262	er who's that
S0261	like erm 's still in ireland i think
S0262	well okay then there's one
S0261	as an example
S0262	but yeah
S0261	as an example you know that's one example so erm
S0262	but you're one you're one of the few who actually have not return to new zealand
S0261	maybe that's the case i don't know there be a crowd of them i don't know where everybody be but a lot of them be in new zealand yes your point's take alright okay
S0262	be they do the thing that they do when they leave
S0261	yes they start off with something they go back to it
S0262	thank you thank you thank you
S0261	the point be that they
S0262	they like it
S0261	be do the same thing that they start out with and yeah but i get the sense that you know for some of them it's no longer as enjoyable as it be it's it's it's business it's graft it's make money
S0262	do you know what it be it's a traditional point of view
S0261	mm
S0262	i do my study as a bachelor degree which be what i be tell to do i fuck become a charter land surveyor which be what i be fuck tell to do i've graft my fuck graft and now i'm try to make my way in the world okay until i'm a pensioner why shouldn't society my contribution be this why shouldn't society give me a fuck good crack at it you know pursue one career and get very very good at what i do why should i not be a give an an an opportunity to have a life long career in the thing that i've work hard at other people
S0261	yeah but that's the way we're all bring up we're bring up that it's go to last for life
S0262	right okay
S0261	and that's what we want for life
S0262	do you want that from life
S0261	well no not from my point of view cos i've always kind of think well well part part of it be if i be do my own thing my own business like i've say erm it be about the location thing i always like the idea of move around because that kind of reinvigorate you it's new stuff you learn new stuff it force you to look at thing differently you try different stuff just because you're do that when you're base in one place sure you get to know the community you become better know in the community you know more people there but you're there and that's it you know erm you don't necessarily get the freedom to go and have a look around and look at other stuff and
S0262	so who's a a not a role model but who's a model of what you're actually someone older than you who be actually epitomise a little bite of what you've just say they don't have to be a role model but somebody who's be live their life in a way that you've just describe
S0261	well i suppose it's connect in a way to people who call themselves expats and
S0262	so who who who who
S0261	and an a and examples i can think of be like and be expats your your aunt and uncle erm in in cairo they're expats you know they they've live that lifestyle all of their life and they wouldn't have live that lifestyle if they be comfortable with be in one place they're not do it just because of the job they're do it because they don't mind be post around the place
S0262	you know who's actually probably a good example as well be he's become that way
S0261	he he yeah he will he will maybe morph into that in a way
S0262	he have sort of modernise version of an expat yeah he's get quite a lot of choice about where he go i mean most expats do but actually if you want to climb up the ladder you've get to just take what's really kind of on offer the best that they can give you
S0261	oh fuck what's that put that out
S0262	vital part of it but i don't know if you're ready for that yet yet i don't know if you're really ready for the introspection part cos it's probably cos you haven't actually get to a safe platform in which to sort of feel retrospective i mean sorry introspective you probably don't want to think about it yet but question will be ask i don't know if you're go to interview but be probably a bite more down play but he'll be look at you go what the fuck be you do you know you could be just like me you could come back to new zealand you could work with em whatever you could set your own business up you're still a charter surveyor what be fuck wrong with you just just do what we've be train to do
S0261	yeah but if you don't enjoy it or you don't want to do it then why would you do it
S0262	you see that's a hard conversation to have with somebody who's actually still do what they be train to do when they be in their twenties
S0261	yeah well it depend on whether they actually still enjoy it or whether they're
S0262	but you kind of upset them either way whichever way you announce it
S0261	well you can certainly say well be it something that you still enjoy do
S0262	ah but that's confrontational
S0261	well you could put it in a different way which be erm
S0262	i don't think you want to get righteous about it put it that way
S0261	no i don't tend to be want to be i mean there's nothing righteous about try something new
S0262	try something different
S0261	or something different
S0262	it's new and different but new er carry this connotation of something original what you're do be just something different it's not necessarily something new it feel new it's just different for you
S0261	it's new for me cos i'm learn new things stuff that i didn't know i'm i'm find out i'm learn about
S0262	okay so in a way you're gonna have to get kind of quite well verse at how do you explain this to your friends so that they understand actually what you're try to achieve cos i think your friends will actually be your biggest critics
S0261	oh of course they will
S0262	yeah
S0261	and they'll try and put me to point er well what do you think you're do and i well you know these be the reason why i'm go in this direction why i've leave that direction and i'm in a transition which be work towards this and create something different you know and if you put it in context of the bigger picture which er could be like you be talk about the idea of of the way the education market be work et cetera that one way to learn about how to do something be to talk to people who have already do it or be do it and if you come across enough of them you're gonna pick up little tit bits of stuff and you're gonna see a common theme between them and you're gonna look at it and go well okay i can run with those things i don't like those bits but i'll run my way this way and that's the beauty about what entrepreneurialship stuff be that that people all be do it by themselves they have a common thread that's why they make it work but the reality be be all of us could be ten of us could be do all sort of different stuff go in different directions and we will all meet at the same point at the end and that's the great thing about it that there's more one more than one way to skin a cat you know so if i'm talk to these guy and they're like well why be you do this well because i admire what you do which be you're do it i'm interest in that and i'm interest in more than just tell your story i wanna find out from you about the things that matter to you and how you've go about it cos i expect to learn something from that and that there's always value in learn something from anybody else so they might not get that they might not understand my perception of them or my perception of the bigger picture er that they're a part of but i certainly think by the time i get there i'll have a feel for what that particular moment be about it might not be the bigger picture because one of the question might be be there a bigger picture to a certain extent or something like that well my extent will be shorter than what their extent be cos i've already travel a longer journey
S0262	absolutely be there a way that you can erm in a diagram and i don't mean it have to be a diagram of sort of like you know beakers and sort of you know bunsen burners and whatever but be there something that you can actually send them in a sort of interest kind of you know way where it actually surmise what you've just say to me without lose them yeah but just something that you can point to and say the reason why i'm do this be because i wanna learn this from you this i can actually teach to others and i potentially could make money out of it as in this be probably a new careership for me
S0261	yeah
S0262	i don't know yet but i'm go to experiment with it
S0261	absolutely of course mm
S0262	so could you you know surmise it in such a short way where it's so down pat where they just follow your train of think
S0261	i'll create a cartoon strip
S0262	yes
S0261	me and them
S0262	that's a brilliant idea
S0261	de de de
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah
S0262	that be this this this idea of create a team put it in a cartoon strip brilliant that's your personal way of get the message
S0261	cos cartoon strip tell us quick stories
S0262	yeah look at tin tin look at how brilliant everybody else be at do that
S0261	and then new zealand it use to be
S0262	right
S0261	or whatever
S0262	there you go then
S0261	yeah could be
S0262	do it like that
S0261	the guy who
S0262	do it in the way that you know how in the way that they will understand best
S0261	yeah
S0262	but i think it's integral that you get that understand and back support from your mat before you go to a video er into and interview with them
S0261	oh absolutely of course
S0262	they've get to know one hundred per cent that they trust you
S0261	mm
S0262	in this new way
S0261	well you've get to be able to erm articulate to them the reason why you want to do it
S0262	yeah and you won't spot them
S0261	and they won't do it
S0262	yeah
S0261	comfortably
S0262	yeah
S0261	without understand where you're come from
S0262	exactly where you're come from
S0261	and sometimes that might make might take you know and email a chat a product a a a a a discussion document more chat and then you meet them and then you have a chat and you sort it out and away you go you know because with everybody there's stuff they want to say and other things they don't want to say
S0262	right
S0261	you need to know that
S0262	that's right and also
S0261	because you don't want to be ask the wrong question
S0262	have you think about if they don't want to participate how you give them the easy way out without offend you have you think about a way that be actually dead easy if they just don't want to participate for whatever reason that they have which be personal or whatever to themselves that they've get an easy way out and you won't look at them and go what the fuck
S0261	well erm i'll have to work that out
S0262	mm
S0261	erm most of the time from my point of view people's reactions say a lot of things and and if they don't connect to it easily then they probably don't want to do it
S0262	mm
S0261	simply simply that
S0262	yeah
S0261	you know erm
S0262	you can yeah
S0261	so if they don't want to do it well you have to find others who be go to do it it's it's part of it
S0262	no i think you're right i think you know your mat that if there isn't a sort of you know little kind of interest
S0261	i mean a lot of them would just say straight up look mate it's not what i want to do
S0262	yeah yeah some of them will be worry that that no interest to go to give it a go some of them will be worry about what's the the copy what's my be i like be my liken go to be use and you know where be i go to end up
S0261	well you need to understand that
S0262	yeah
S0261	and you need to understand erm how you want to approach it you might simply say well i'm gonna i'm plan to use your liken or this discussion in this particular product and i'm look at erm use it in a particular way erm and they might want you to contact them every time you do that others might say carte blanche do whatever you want but make sure you back up my company every time you do it
S0262	yep yep
S0261	that you put your little pitch in for us like it's a vice versa i'll scratch your back if you scratch mine
S0262	yeah yeah
S0261	which to me seem absolutely fine
S0262	yeah no you have to offer them
S0261	of course you do
S0262	you have to offer them something
S0261	of course you will
S0262	yeah
S0261	look i'll splash your business all over the net
S0262	yeah you can't take take take take take
S0261	more than you could do yourself
S0262	you've get to give back as well it's get to be two way process
S0261	yeah well i mean the reality behind a lot of these guy and and part of it go back to some of the old school stuff and some of it be just their way of business think not they don't really have an interest in the power of the net
S0262	mm
S0261	they don't really
S0262	yeah so you could be teach them something
S0261	follow
S0262	yeah
S0261	why you should be interest
S0262	yeah yeah so you could
S0261	some of them be start off with it because they know it's an easy way to be connect to your mat as an example but things like well you know for some people it things like be it go to create more growth for my business well for a lot of people yes you know if you be like run a a a a pick up coach bus service type thing for drink establishments at any time of the day during during during the whole year then the ideal thing for them be an app something on a mobile phone that people can go de de de okay it's go to turn up here i need to be out the door by then and of course these guy probably turn up and somehow let somebody else know and they say well you know the wagon's here guy it's time to go home or whatever but
S0262	no you're right you're right you're right
S0261	people
S0262	you're right but
S0261	people would make a better connection be have the choice to make that connection themselves
S0262	yeah
S0261	rather than you tell them to go all the time
S0262	well i be go to say that but the thing be be that if you're move along with i understand how erm er social media technologies be work because i'm have to because this be part of how my business be gonna be set up equally they're teach you about entrepreneurship they'll actually go oh right so what do you do and you're like well this be how i work it because this be the way i've be kind of like you know understand how to do it be like oh right so like be it that easy or be it hard and you're like no actually it's quite easy so all you have to do be this and i can actually show you how to do it do you want me to show you how to do it and they're like oh okay so actually they might not realise that they're actually learn something for you only because you're just be you you're not try to force fee them you're not be sanctimonious about it you're just go oh this be the reason why i'm do it it's because i'm do it like this and everyone's like do like what oh okay why do you have to do it like that with so many like well because actually the way it fit together if because if you don't have this bite and you don't have that bite bleed ble ble ble ble ble so that's the beauty for it be that not only do they get your name in something on the on the internet but they're actually learn something from you
S0261	yeah exactly
S0262	potentially learn from you
S0261	well that that would be the ideal would be yes and and again it's this idea of a relative expert that you know a bite more than somebody else and you can offer them something because you know that bite more
S0262	yeah but they probably also don't think
S0261	and that be valid
S0262	feel like they're the experts to you but you know it's all relative isn't it when they think of entrepreneurship they might think of you know somebody big in new zealand or a name that they they think be a famous person or this this this talk
S0261	well if if they yeah yeah of course
S0262	you know that no one have to get too big like i don't understand the
S0261	well if new zealand have the thing but i mean they might still have the people the mentor or the people that they look up to
S0262	right
S0261	all of that kind of thing
S0262	so when you say i admire you i admire you want to learn from you they're like get real i mean for fuck's sake we're only a couple of couple of years before you you'll catch up if you want your own business of course you're go to be right there will tell you that straight away
S0261	yeah of course absolutely crack on and give it a go but
S0262	you will be successful just like us
S0261	mm
S0262	because why wouldn't you be
S0261	mm
S0262	you're just like fuck intelligent as we be
S0261	of course just give it a go
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	so they thing be that they way you you really get to get it so many of these angle right cos they're your friends
S0261	yes i do appreciate that erm and
S0262	i love the strip the comic strip i mean the the cartoon thing i think that be a bloody brilliant way of of of get their interest try to understand where you're come from yeah and and actually want to be part of it not just oh it's and i like him he's a good bloke but actually be quite excite about it if you could actually get somebody get somebody feel quite excite about be participant in something wow that will show on the camera
S0261	of course erm we will have to play it out and see how it go
S0262	well you've get a big job love
S0261	yeah i know erm
S0262	you've get a lot of things to think about
S0261	there's there's a lot of stiff to follow and learn and lot of hours to put in i think
S0262	yeah there be
S0261	and erm and and we'll have to work out how to put all that time aside whether it's a case of work together or er that we focus on certain things at a certain time you know but it i expect to get my head down in the even and stuff like that
S0262	okay well i'll be start my course soon so you know i'll be i'll be study as well
S0261	when do that start
S0262	second of february officially but i think i can go online end of january
S0261	righto
S0262	but yeah you're right but let's put this into the context of if you be actually study your your your choose curriculum in a in a face to face erm composition you'd have maybe eight hours of lecture per week you'd maybe have six six hours of tutorials that's all you get as face to face with someone tell you the rest of the time you go off and do it all on your own that's at that's actually the landscape now of borrow in education be you don't get a lot of face to face time you get you know
S0261	so you're say out of let's say what's a full time twenty five hours a week kind of thing the reality be be now it's only twelve
S0262	mm
S0261	cos when i go to uni you get twenty five hours
S0262	i know well i i think i be at uni every day
S0261	which which be sixty per cent of a full work week
S0262	but these kid say to me i've get a job here and i've get a job there so i'm go to pile all my lecture into the one day and my tutorials and i'm like how do you do that oh because i can manage it i can move my stuff into even class and they'll have a lecture in the afternoon and go straight i'm like don't you get tell that like tutorials no no you can choose now
S0261	yeah so they've get multiple time slot that they just say well i'm gonna turn up to the time slot
S0262	yeah fuck fuck that
S0261	and and they're flexible enough to have one hundred people at that one
S0262	yeah
S0261	and one person at the other
S0262	they'll all bunch up somehow
S0261	yeah
S0262	get your first dibs in or something i don't know how it work
S0261	well it might be limit number or whatever
S0262	cos i remember have to go to management account stroke two on a friday fuck afternoon and i hadn't have to go in in the morning
S0261	well it's a timetable and you turn up at that time otherwise you miss out
S0262	yeah it's fine i be always at college i be always fuck around do something at college i don't remember days on end when i didn't fuck go in unless i just couldn't be fuck arsed to go in but even then i actually still go in cos i live round the corner from where the college be
S0261	well i well i can see a sensible context on one side and and not so sensible context on the other
S0262	but these lot they're they're get the maximum they're go i've get a job at uni i'm volunteer at uni i mean they talk like they fuck know everything and i'm look at them go jeez man you be serious power fuck players but they're only power players because they're young and they don't actually understand they're still look into a job it's a completely different kettle of fish they all believe when you're about erm twenty er twenty one to twenty two you can have it all and then you get in to our job and go fuck hell why do i think like that i think expansively and i do everything i want to do at uni it's not until people start put you into fuck pigeon hole that you realise you can't
S0261	well and and look you know i think that be part of the problem with with common day business and employment you know that think of like google who have what be effectively a campus and they operate in the nature of universities so
S0262	yeah you turn up when you kind of feel like you can
S0261	you you you get play and that of course somehow all of that's monitor you turn up you have to be see to be there for a certain period of time but you can take whatever break and you can mix and match with whoever you want and if you've get a deal then you go and present that to the top geezers and you say well look i've get this idea we've work together as a team for the last six weeks and we've be able to analyse and come up with we reckon this be a goer give it a go trial it out it go up on google they try it out as a product you know check it out it stay or it die
S0262	but you know these you know these youngsters right these youngsters now the ones i'm talk to they're probably about nineteen twenty twenty one i think erm i've never ask them their age i mean i just assume but i think they're go to have a bite of shock because they be work the university system as in i turn up do a bite of work for that university then i go off and do a volunteer through university and then i'm actually work in the community anyway and then i'm actually just do a sort of like part time job at like jv hi fi whatever then i'm do my study but i'm actually do them in the even cos that's how it work out for me they have totally understand how to maximise their time these be normal third years students by the way and the shock be fuck off you get your first full time fuck job as a fuck grunt you don't have that freedom you don't have that liberty to think in the way that you think you've get to stop think like that and you've get to get with what everyone else be think which be get in at eight leave at six
S0261	yeah but what they get with to start with be that they've get some stuff they do and they deliver whatever they've get to deliver they work for jv hi fi and they sell shit they do their education and they submit their assignments and they do their assessment and they get their piece of paper and they go down the community centre and and they shovel a few soup kitchens or something like that i don't know whatever
S0262	no that's what people do
S0261	you know yeah
S0262	they do that
S0261	mm well good on them
S0262	all all all in the same fuck week
S0261	good on them yeah good on them
S0262	yeah
S0261	but what then actually i think on another side be sure you might not have the freedom to do all of those things or operate in that manner when you're at work and you might have to sit in one bloody spot and suffer through it but i'll tell you what have those skills erm will show you up to be rather organise and if you're of that type of ilk you're probably quite sociable and interactive and come across as a bite of a go getter
S0261	mm
S0262	so you probably sit there and tap your feet like you're bore cos you want to get on and do something and if you're i expect if you're kind of transition into a space then either you will be a lot more free or you will be totally constrain and go and do something else
S0262	yeah which be what i'm think these lot they won't have the time for it the things that they've actually train to do in their degree fuck
S0261	so they're more likely to collaborate and create new stuff
S0262	yeah
S0261	which be the way all all these new erm businesses and products come about they they all go of well this be bloody shit isn't it well why don't we do it like this and we'll go and make a business out of it okay guy somebody gonna give us some money yeah give us some money mate away we go piece of cake now that's the way they think they think i just go and get it
S0261	yeah
S0262	very good example of that
S0261	well be he ready
S0262	let's take at what be he twenty six twenty seven and put as in fuck in the uk would be work in the degree he be train in and he wouldn't be fuck around do what he be do because actually the landscape there be very tough if you've buy a degree as in you've buy you're you've import you've pay you've actually do the time and you've actually do quite well all of those things have to align quite nicely don't fuck tell me that i'm go to go off and fuck do some crowd source for free in melbourne and work quite hard over the weekend just fuck do the job that you've actually be train to do cos there's plenty of other people in the world who don't get to fuck do what they're train to do and i i i'll actually get i be a little bite annoy with him today but i didn't show it but i will get back to him about it and just like don't fuck tell me that you find it too hard cos that's what work be you feel it's too hard because you're give your time for free then fuck go out and do what you actually train to do and earn some money
S0261	well if he doesn't like give his er his time for free then make sure he get pay for it
S0262	mm what i'm try to say be that look i know i'm not really the best person to talk to cos i get a business degree and i could have just go go corporate blue chip you know i could have do but i didn't but i go and get a job as a fuck au pair i get pay for it i lead a lifestyle in uni that be actually pretty nice it didn't last very long but i stay in uni and i become an english teacher still get pay for that i fuck make load of money out of that and it pay for my fuck master's degree so i'm try to understand the mind set of some of these twenty year olds i'm think great great great you're so fuck cool you do all of these things you're all all there things you you know social network you're so this i'm not talk about no i'm talk about others it's like why don't you actually give a fuck go in the fuck thing that your degree have train you to be like you do land survey yes i'm go to be a land surveyor and i will just become a charter surveyor because that's what i fuck be train to do why be you piss around not do stuff instead of what you're train to do do you think you're that much better than everybody else i i don't understand i don't understand why there's so much unemployment in europe that these kinds in australia seem to just go oh well i don't give a fuck
S0261	well because they haven't have their they haven't have their base for it they haven't have their pant pull down they haven't have the shock of their live you know the people in europe have the kid in europe have people come out of uni have
S0262	but you see what how i could come across
S0261	the reality it's it's it's the standard the standard old human reaction interaction thing
S0262	yeah you don't know until it happen to you
S0261	you don't know until it happen to you till you're shock to death you know and and those people in europe those poor people in europe be really really have a rough time the reality of it be though in relation to a relative thing that tough time isn't as bad as it really seem yet you know
S0262	mm
S0261	it's not like there's not enough food to fee people
S0262	no no
S0261	you know the the basic be all there
S0262	no no no i know it's all it's all relative
S0261	and all of that kind of thing
S0262	i'm just say i'm i'm
S0261	here isn't just quintessentially i'm go to get enough money therefore i'm not gonna do their job that's the kind of attitude
S0262	yeah actually you're right that's more the point yeah
S0261	yeah and and okay i challenge you to try and get more money somewhere else to do that job have just leave uni
S0262	or or or or or 's just a continue student that he like the freedom when he be an undergrad cos he do a million different type of things and what he love about be in this job now be he do a million different type of thing but he hasn't knuckle down to that you know one day you have to knuckle down to something you just in your life have to just go fuck it i be this and i will do this
S0261	well if you're go to have a string to your bow you need to set your attention in some direction
S0262	yeah
S0261	and that's that's simply the way it be erm and i don't know what he do but
S0262	well whatever he do he do it quite well
S0261	well there's probably something that he can continue on do then
S0262	but they want him to stay they want to offer him fuck permanent shit there
S0261	right right right
S0262	he's just not play their game either
S0261	well he doesn't want to then do him
S0262	he won't play anyone's game and he's not just it's 's just not it's not him as an individual it's other people as well and i'm just think actually you know what there's nothing wrong with fuck turn up for work and be somebody for a couple of years and understand what that feel like
S0261	no there's nothing wrong with that erm and and like any other experience in life that you give something a go for a while and erm then you can turn around and say to somebody well i know what i's like that's why we would choose to go and travel round the world cos you don't know how to do it unless you've do it or you don't know what it's like until you've do it be more the point
S0262	that's true and then we've just be like them but we're run away from it in different way we're not run away from it but we're we're
S0261	well no we just we're just explore the
S0262	we're exercise our free our freedom
S0261	the thing our freedom and that's what's important so i don't erm i don't i don't hold him back for do that if he doesn't want to be focus and fit into a particular role because society expect him to then good on him if he doesn't want to do that and he's get something else to do and he can make his crust and live that way he could be happy live on a baguette and a piece of cheese for the day
S0262	you're right be just it be just pant this morning normally he's not hat down about things
S0261	yeah
S0262	but he might have just have something go on that he doesn't want to talk about
S0261	he might he might have be hangover or his sister might have like steal his shoe or i don't know
S0262	or yeah it's just annoy that's true yeah it's true
S0261	you know the girls get at him for the day so he's not go to react to the girls very well be he
S0262	yeah normally
S0261	whatever
S0262	normally he's alright with me
S0261	yeah so go give him a hard time next week
S0262	i will
S0261	when when he get back
S0262	yeah
S0261	and and sometime we'll meet up or whatever
S0262	yeah he probably just
