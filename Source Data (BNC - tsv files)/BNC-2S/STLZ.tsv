S0261	erm okay yeah so i i like er i'm try to kind of get a bigger strategic picture over what we're really enter into erm and er maybe i'm just be try to move too fast but i get that feel that we need to move fast so erm i'd rather do that and so if we're talk about personal learn network er one model that i could see that would benefit people be connect students with what the business world be and do that before they enter the business world and so personal learn network become a an extension of what they're do er and what they integrate be this connection with the real world yeah so they do these study and there's a practical thing that they do erm they do this summer work or their holiday work and the majority of students don't i think don't get experience in what they they're work at what the what the they're train in what
S0262	no they're not
S0261	they're educate in
S0262	the most of the time they're try to earn money part time work
S0261	right okay so erm so go beyond they might still have to learn earn money but it doesn't mean to say they should stop study while they're on holiday okay so if you put it a different way they should be develop their personal learn network such that regardless of whether they're work in a a job or a role that be relate to what they're do they should be try to to to to find mechanisms to build experience that be somehow connect to that
S0262	yeah no i agree and that's a
S0261	and and that but from their point of view do some they might not get the picture of do something in a community base thing with some role of responsibility they might not understand that that be quite heavily connect to do a role of business yeah so let's say they be er have a small leadership role
S0262	well i
S0261	have a little project to run
S0262	yeah yeah
S0261	all of that kind of stuff
S0262	yeah
S0261	so you're try to map things that they you know which can be perceive as a ethereal but if you can demonstrate the connection or value
S0262	if they can explain it to us then that mean that if if they can explain it we can talk about it and interview other people about it
S0261	yes
S0262	so the idea be erm i would say be to go and put your eye in some cold water and you will get rid of what's bother your eyeball cos the way you flush out your eye be just by get some cold water and just flush out the thing in your eye
S0261	okay alright erm start to feel like mickey rourke okay erm i'm just try to think of a bigger picture thing which be er
S0262	well i actually have a brainwave today while you're kind of
S0261	oh okay well i know what you yeah
S0262	try to articulate what you're say
S0261	yeah
S0262	erm look i'm only bring this to your awareness a because you be like make your own personal learn network
S0261	yeah
S0262	so now you have the terminology to talk about it and write about it other people will be interest in what you're do because it be on the fringe yeah
S0261	okay
S0262	it won't be a it won't be an it won't be a term that most people be aware of what that mean
S0261	yes
S0262	erm and it also mean that the students themselves when you when you ask question like monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday if we still run with that idea that there be a personal learn network that's be expose and the idea be to move away from network or social network yes we know that what it be but we need to show learners of any age that actually what they're do in this new way of use people in real life but also connect over the internet be a way of just shape your personal learn network and the reason why it's call a personal learn network be because there be some theory that back it up yeah and that the reason why we use that as a frame question be because we need something that's different from all the other websites out there you know we need to be talk in a in a forum of something other yeah
S0261	yes exactly we need to we either need to be work in a niche that exist or create a new one
S0262	it i think create a new one and and especially bring in other ideas from where people be on the fringe they're educators they be perhaps even parent even but they're aware of something happen with their children
S0261	mm
S0262	and those children turn into young adults and those young adults turn into adults so all we're do be jump in on a on a on a sequence of somebody's life and it doesn't really matter what age they be but i mean a and originally you start go younger adults erm mainly because i think they be draw a bigger crowd but maybe not you know what we've now get be this idea of a personal learn network bring in anybody of any age as long as they're part of your personal learn network and you can explain why they be
S0261	okay so what i think i would prefer to approach it with would be you start at university and we be talk about this idea of a peer to peer connection
S0262	yeah
S0261	okay as a as a learn thing erm and that you would take people who who be near they've just they've leave university fairly close by yeah erm and er in my experience typically what happen be people walk out of university and they don't go back that's it
S0262	yeah
S0261	they don't pass on any knowledge there's no there's a total disconnect okay
S0262	that
S0261	they just get on with i'm gonna go and live my life
S0262	most people yeah
S0261	yeah
S0262	most people
S0261	so
S0262	yeah
S0261	so but however those people have their own personal learn network and typically it's it's a continuation of what they've be do at university because a lot of people will enter into some kind of professional growth thing with work okay they've get something to learn to bridge a gap to actually operate effectively in a business
S0262	yeah
S0261	okay erm so that kind of tranche of people make sense to me that you can connect these two together quite effectively erm and then you can take people who be perceive to be experts or people who might be role model that you can supplant as a er as an overall connector for everyone
S0262	yeah
S0261	just a think but
S0262	yeah no that's right
S0261	i initially when you be talk about this idea of just work in the university students i be a bite kind of well it become quite constrain
S0262	mm
S0261	and although it be a niche and it's a well define niche erm i i think we would have to think very specifically about how how you're access people's dollars if you want to get some money from them you know for pay for products et cetera
S0262	well i i think about this today and i think erm we can certainly start off erm with university students as the primary audience but the thing about it be that if we be use this idea of make a move image as a case study and the people who be in the case study be actually use their own liken you know they be a part of the case study they agree they wanna co create they want to earn some money from co create a product erm and then the idea be that once you've get these niche products i think i've understand what this be all about in term of scalability you hone the skill you be not necessarily sell you can sell those products but what you're go to sell up in the scale of things be the the know how of how to do that cos i just realise when i be talk to today that he be talk about qantas as a case study and he be say so if you have like you know the ceo the this this the that and the other all these people who be try to organise qantas and make it better erm you'd need access to these real life people okay to make it authentic and then you could put it across as this be the problem what theories do you need to use management theories to you know solve the problem so i've just realise that the way you can scale it up be by work away at the begin chip it out as a product but then actually go to much bigger company and go this be what we do this be how we can make it it's almost like a corporate video but it's call a corporate case study and this be the reason why we can do it be because we've be chip away at this area where we've learn about them the students and the knowledge base and pitch it at the right level for the students cos the students will be your customers cos you'll sell this into say for example an educational well
S0261	well well it can be a subscription model where people or a membership thing you know a whole range of different gatekeepers that you can create to bring people into a pay community
S0262	yeah
S0261	whether it's that you have your your your your core erm er let's call it your your market blog presentation all of that that be your that be your your outward look for your business and beside that you can have er a membership community which be people who want something extra go to that community okay that could be that could be a tangible you get access to it erm a a a coherent network of people who do x y z or whatever
S0262	you're right look you could work it out on so many different level i'm just tell you where the scalability come from
S0261	okay carry on
S0262	if you're talk about big dollars
S0261	mm
S0262	and people be stupid enough to spend shitloads of money on crap stuff which they be at the moment i've talk to another a number of educational designers and the money that's fly around in certain universities at the moment be just stupid money they need content they be not a production house that's not what they're there for they need content and they need relevant content that will sell on to their client base which be a young audience basically so they're gonna run out of ideas very soon i be talk to on the train she say it's not about stick an academic in front of a at a fuck computer er sorry camera
S0261	camera yeah yeah i know that
S0262	and get them to talk at the camera that's that's old style mooc
S0261	yes
S0262	that's not where we're go we're go further much further than that we're gonna go into the realm of edu tainment education plus tainment get the punters to part with their money
S0261	mm
S0262	so even if the universities won't touch it with a bargepole because it's too ooh it's leave of centre moocs will and if moocs start to change into something other we'll be there with product and content to keep fill it and we should be ahead of the eight ball because we've already start the know how of how to make this happen because i think this format that we have in mind be quite unusual i think the idea of actually let real life people drive their own narrative and wanna be a co creators and earn money from that that's where everyone benefit the point be they'll earn royalties what more of an incentive do you fuck want
S0261	carry on
S0262	and not all of them will sell some of them won't some of them will be really good and they'll sell well so you'll have your cash cow and you'll have your sort of slightly random ones
S0261	well that's what you're test and that's what you're try out as you go erm so if one's to start somewhere we we really have to kind of get down this kind of idea of we need to do some some market market research we we need to create something that we can then use to explore certain things
S0262	mm
S0261	so erm you can go out and do bore old survey but as you say people aren't that interest in survey er er i think a better mechanism of try to find out more information be by write stuff publish it online like a blog or whatever erm and encourage people to get involve and to comment on it and that's where you get your information out of the the the feedback that they're write between each other or about something on on the on the content yeah
S0262	maybe
S0261	because you can see it's quite easy to er find a storyline within all of that
S0262	yeah i suppose you're right but that would take some time to generate won't it
S0261	well you need to do that anyway because this be a a keen mechanism on how to get traffic into your site okay so you need to put yourself out there as the the relative expert
S0262	alright
S0261	okay
S0262	okay alright okay so i'll
S0261	so you can start on any thread but the the idea be we need to be build up some information that people be then draw to yeah
S0262	okay so i write something the other day
S0261	mm
S0262	erm that i can show you and the students tomorrow
S0261	mm
S0262	erm which it say dear university teacher and then what what we'd like from our learn be this and then it it put through some ideas about what kind of learn should be happen at university so i be think of show to the students tomorrow and see if they agree and wanna add something to it so it's start a thread by a letter a letter that go to dear university teacher and it's sign from university student so it's no name attach
S0261	mm
S0262	it's just a get the ball roll
S0261	mm yeah mm
S0262	and i be think in that they might be something that you know students might get draw to where they go yeah yeah that be what we want or no no no we want more of this so you be begin to find out what they think they want from their learn and then once you've get that kind of ball roll maybe there be a narrative come through about or trend we want more this we want less that you know
S0261	and in term of the way you you'd be write it erm be be the context of of what the recent history be or what the recent now be
S0262	yeah
S0261	what the recent future should be like and what you you provide them at the end of it all be the how do we join this together
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah so i like your idea it doesn't have to be write like that to present to people but if they can get the thread of it then they'll provide you the stuff which be the bite that you tell them at the end
S0262	yeah and i think one thing that you know i keep come back round to again be that i think what we're really try to tell young people be that employers there's two things that employers will look for and they may not be able to articulate it but they i'm pretty sure they're look for it creative problem solvers most of the time and secondly that you're adaptable and adaptation mean you learn how to adapt it's about learn how to adapt and that require you to be a learner most of the time
S0261	and hence and hence have your your own personal learn network
S0262	personal learn network yeah
S0261	mm yeah
S0262	so if those two things be the way that the students and i you know be frame we don't confuse the water er confuse people too much with too many term we're just basically go what be you watch you're watch people creatively solve problems this be a dialogue of monday to tuesday to wednesday and what be they do every single time we interview them be they're add part of the solution how be they do that by communicate
S0261	mm yes yeah yeah
S0262	and that's where you get the case study material from
S0261	and i've just think of another thing about erm a connection and that be with employers and a big thing that you i mean you just hear it say but whether it actually be be another thing and that be er this kind of common commentary about students who come out of university or gen y students don't fit the bill for the employers that they seem to be fall short of the expectations now whether that's a a just a a common difference that always exist or whether there be a relative difference with what we might be consider for our generation versus theirs i don't know but you do hear that so part of your research you could say be well find a a a bundle of of employers and ask them what they think
S0262	yeah yeah absolutely you could do that
S0261	and then what you can you're effectively do be you're you're join two problems together one which be you there's a problem here that exist before you even get there that you that you need to be aware of
S0262	yeah
S0261	and that you need that's what what you're try to provide the student be the mechanism to shine above what this problem be
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah and then at the student end they've get their problem which be that they're expect to try and learn within an institution that er hasn't yet mature in such a way in context of what future learning's go to be
S0262	mm
S0261	so they're in a
S0262	mm
S0261	transition period
S0262	yeah yeah
S0261	where they've actually get this this common fuss and and and chaos and erm probably they've get expectations that they're not have meet so that's their they actually have something in common with the employers
S0262	true
S0261	and and one might be able to join this all together and say well actually don't look at the students it's not the students it's the people that be teach them so business go and talk to them don't forget about the students it's not their fault
S0262	mm yeah it's a it's a it's a it's a pretty powerful erm message that's get send to the institutions but you know the i be talk to an educational developer who work at for three years and now work here she's get quite a good job here in erm she's one of the head sort of developers and she say look it's not about video video be just a way to convey information it's what you do with the video and the learn that go around it that surround it that take place that's where you need to put your energy she say i've try talk to you know people up the top about this and they're not interest she say but one thing i do know be that eventually the students will vote with their feet they be become more price conscious they be become more savvy about how to decide which course to do and it only take a few real websites that be big for the students to keep always go to to check out where the course be and who's do the most sort of entice learn at the moment that's all it need and then boom students will know where they wanna go and why and i and i can see that happen i mean i know i'm say i'm seal the idea that we're gonna have a big website but again i'm look at the scalability of it be that once you've get the dialogue go in the right way and you've get something that's change that's interest you be learn something from it you can buy something from it too be that you'll keep go back as long as the stories be fresh appeal be drive by the user and not
S0261	the there's a adaptation in it
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	and that's actually live and breathe what we're say we do
S0261	yes exactly and i i be think also initially i be think well part of the problem be that these students they're not students forever they go through the system and then they move on
S0262	yeah
S0261	and so you've get this kind of continual thing of of of of er you you start somewhere down here and you learn to a certain level and then that experience be lose from our point of view as well and that's why we're interest in try to continue a connection beyond their university time because because we would be continue to learn about the reality of this new connection
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah that that we need to understand whether there be a benefit that be then provide to business as an example erm and it's very tangible to connect this kind of journey path together
S0262	mm
S0261	in a more proactive and positive way
S0262	mm
S0261	and you can certainly get employers interest in what you're do
S0262	mm
S0261	and you can say well this be this be where we side here and this be where we side here and we be the medium that join the two together
S0262	yeah
S0261	and the the the thing i do like about it the antithesis of what i'm talk about be that you always have a continuous flow of new people come into the system
S0262	mm and they're connect
S0261	yes
S0262	in a way by the time that you've kind of you know go through this this format that's that's gonna be a real skill to get go but if you can get that know how really professional that you can scale up
S0261	mm
S0262	people will come to your website and go can you do that for me i love it
S0261	mm
S0262	i love that
S0261	mm
S0262	i want you to come into my company and do that with my people
S0261	mm
S0262	cos i wanna show my own employees a case study
S0261	yes
S0262	from our real company
S0261	yeah
S0262	please come and do that
S0261	yes
S0262	erm so there's money to be make
S0261	mm
S0262	in various different place it's just that we're gonna have to work really hard on the format and work really hard on protect it
S0261	mm
S0262	cos it's so easy for somebody to come along and get a get a whiff of what be actually be do
S0261	and just be
S0262	and just go off and create it themselves
S0261	yeah and that come down to erm a lot of things but erm that be part of you know you can kind of get this feel that if you be to draw it on a piece of paper there's a kind of a rough thing there
S0262	yeah
S0261	you know
S0262	it's
S0261	mm
S0262	it's it's gotta be it's gotta be demo i mean i don't know if it's possible to do but look
S0261	well you yeah yes you do and you do it er that's that's exactly what the lean model be about that you do a minimum version of it
S0262	yeah
S0261	now yeah you know there be a lot of things that would need to be build in a very short amount of time if you're go to do that at some cost
S0262	right well i mean what i need to talk to and and also and about as i say not tomorrow but another time let's see how they go with make a film and everything
S0261	mm
S0262	tomorrow but erm i i need i need to know from how he see the narrative work he's get quite a good sort of write style he's quite you know free flow with his style you er you read some of his article erm but i need to know from whether you know things can be cut together pretty quickly
S0261	er in context of video
S0262	of yeah because i be think really what people be go to come along to watch be they will some people will watch monday tuesday wednesday some
S0261	they they want to see the
S0262	most most people will wanna see the summary
S0261	yeah well so what what you you you're talk about two different group of people you're talk about those who intrinsically become highly connect with you and they will watch it
S0262	yeah
S0261	to to the end
S0262	yeah
S0261	and then you've get the others who know i i i can't do that bite but i do like the summary that i can see on a friday night or a saturday morning or a sunday or a monday morning or whatever it be
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm and so you're actually feed two different crowd and so what you're interest in be how quickly can you put all this stuff together in a narrative
S0262	and i be think if you wanna buy and get people to buy in
S0261	and a day
S0262	to the answer so you can go here's about a minute of the problem
S0261	mm
S0262	you only give them the problem but it's entice enough to wanna know what the answer be erm so you say your learn opportunity be to solve this problem so you work on it and you think about and then when you're ready to come and have a look at it to see if your solution meet with the actual real life people's solution then you'll enter into the subscription you actually watch the whole of the case study and see how it play out and then you can have like say people in the community be write oh that be such a really neat way of organise people and get the problem solve i would never have think of that yeah well people will be go in the forum go like your forum how you're always help people
S0261	yeah
S0262	you know it's like yeah right okay now what you could do next be so people be just in the community they be just actually use the case study as a way to very quickly share ideas about how to solve problems because they've get something to focus on you know
S0261	and i like the idea of you you well you you can quite quickly build many communities within your community
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm and some examples i'm see er with location rebel er that it's a big community there be large number of new people come in and i get the sense that people kind of be with the community for six to twelve months and then they go off and do their own thing
S0262	oh right
S0261	so they might jump back in and dabble in it
S0262	yeah
S0261	but there's this continuous kind of refresh go on right
S0262	yeah
S0261	but what you do see er with some of the people who be experience be that they find a mechanism which be the next stage up from what this be and they go and join that community
S0262	yeah
S0261	or they become part of something else which meet their new level because they've already learn the base they go to the next level they go to the next level erm which be kind of fit together for what i'm talk about this kind of peer to peer to peer thing
S0262	yeah
S0261	the learn er and some of them be do that on a small group basis so like the hundred club the hundred dollar club i don't know whether i tell you about it
S0262	you do yeah
S0261	but i read about it
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm they be they be they be eight people they be eight people and each of those eight people over the last year have be help each other build each other's businesses
S0262	yeah fair enough
S0261	so so a similar idea that they be solve problems as a group together on a small basis of a really cosy community
S0262	yeah
S0261	and produce group products as well that they're involve in as well
S0262	you see what i like about try to use the primary market as the the voice which be the student who's come in from like university or or just graduate come in as monday and start the whole ball roll it's almost like here i'm gonna tell you my story and i'm gonna get some other people to be storytellers with me and that's the reason why they will select you know a person to interview and i will interview that person oh oh yeah it's in the cupboard underneath the oven be erm i need to need to be sure that we need to transition them from just the student voice and the community into a scalable option where they're either private providers be begin to take interest namely because the site be so popular and that secondly businesses might start to get interest in it because erm you know you're provide erm them with viewable content about what young people be actually do in term of what they're do to get themselves ready for for the world of work and and solve problems
S0261	and quite often there's just no transparency of that connection at all
S0262	no and the transition from be out on your ear after you know graduate to get your first job be a fuck painful one most people find it quite hard
S0261	yes yeah
S0262	and it's not like your university be go to help you get a job be it no they don't really help you get a job
S0261	that's not really what they're there for
S0262	at all no they're not they say they do but they don't
S0261	no and they can't get everybody a job
S0262	exactly
S0261	because you're talk about a large scale of people
S0262	yeah so i think that's a very good point that we can say as well in our in our website be no not every university be go to be able to help every individual get a job so that's why you'd come and look at these things that we're show you
S0261	well we're not offer them job either but we're try to provide them
S0262	with insights into what get you a job
S0261	with insights into mm yeah i don't like yeah i wanna get away from it appear to be a traditional thing
S0262	no i'm just say that there's there be you we've gotta somehow scale it up where when we're feel kind of confident about the know how that we've get to do it be that we can move again and about have a big jump where say you know i don't know start out with maybe moocs or find somebody who's gonna go right now i want a package of this yeah i want a package of these little move image case study i want you to to put a package together and i want you wanna wanna buy it and i want it to be this long and this this kind of teach materials you know i need to be able to go out and sell it on somewhere
S0261	so if you to start out erm with this i i think first one we'd start with not that model not that model straight off
S0262	no
S0261	you you would be just do a an a different model which be simply interview some interest students
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah and and parallel to that you would be build er a series of these sessions these week long sessions okay
S0262	mm
S0261	in the background and you might get them such that you've get a float of them you've get six of them
S0262	mm
S0261	okay erm and within that half a dozen of them if you're gonna kick this off because you can you you you've get a transition and you've get this be go to be the core thing so you've get something before that a foundation before that and that you can er build some momentum into the expectation the release of the something new
S0262	yeah
S0261	you know there's something new come guy
S0262	yeah
S0261	that'd be quite interest and you can flow a few thread through er er in the upcoming kind of period and stuff erm at but give yourself enough headway such that you've test it you're happy with it and that within that six you can probably almost present them as the package
S0262	mm
S0261	you be just talk about
S0262	mm
S0261	that there's a box set of six of these case study together that you could then sell immediately you could go you could get to number six and say we're offer these up for sale this content up for sale
S0262	mm
S0261	and you can put a price on it and what you would do initially be the price that you would put on it would be with the aim of draw in er a more people to build your membership your user base so it would relatively be cheaper
S0262	mm mm
S0261	because you're just start out
S0262	yeah okay that
S0261	that kind of yeah
S0262	that sound like a good jump because you can get feedback from your market
S0261	exactly
S0262	because if they're gonna part with five dollars or ten dollars to go and see what the answer be you know to watch the case study in its entirety erm and then er get the solution you know so it's actually kind of model things like critical think communication skills it's things that actually be quite tangible and you could probably take with you into your study you know or into your job into your job so so but the thing be that you have to make that explicit to them so that they would part with their money to join the communities that they could actually tangibly use some of those ideas and use them in term of skills but that's
S0261	absolutely but you can build that
S0262	why we say
S0261	within the line of a
S0262	yeah
S0261	blog a facebook
S0262	you can
S0261	thing you can
S0262	but you can also say
S0261	let out all sort of different ones
S0262	we're just part of your personal learn network
S0261	yeah
S0262	we're just a a node
S0261	mm
S0262	on something you're build yourself
S0261	mm
S0262	but we need you need to have us as part of your personal learn network
S0261	exactly
S0262	because we're show you actually how to grow it
S0261	mm mm
S0262	so you need us we need you
S0261	yes
S0262	that sort of thing
S0261	mm uh mm
S0262	and there be the some students work off the erm i i'm you know i wanna share i'm very altruistic you know i just wanna get my story out there so they're come in go yeah i wanna be the community once you're inside the community you be then allow to actually offer up your story i say allow but you be invite and then you can start to shape it by think oh who's go to be the you know who's go to be interviewee after me who's go to be tuesday who's go to wednesday so you're already they be already drive it
S0261	mm
S0262	i mean i'm i'm convince that there be students out there who could just drive the whole thing if you let them
S0261	mm mm mm
S0262	some would need more help than others but er as and i say there will be some students' ones which will be a bite a bite nowhere go a bite nowhere but there'll be some that be probably fuck fascinate like you would never know
S0261	and i think that's where your skill come be that you be seek to erm erm facilitate the best result out of these sessions erm so er if you see something that's go slightly er awry i think you would find erm through your experience the mechanism to try and get something really good out of it
S0262	yeah
S0261	and and er and this be where things like people be expect everything to work fine the big message be that failure be not such a bad thing because hey guy what do we learn out of it
S0262	yeah
S0261	and there you go
S0262	we we don't succeed every time yeah
S0261	we've get all of these takeaways
S0262	yeah
S0261	that we can say well next time we would look at it like this and we'd look at it like that and actually erm what we've find out be this particular problem that none of us really have any awareness about
S0262	yeah
S0261	and so that be a big learn message for everyone
S0262	yeah
S0261	and so there's a great thing to take out of it
S0262	yeah yeah yeah that's good because you you wanna get let them know that it's not always gonna be that they can succeed at everything and that failure be okay as long
S0261	mm
S0262	as you use it to succeed
S0261	yes to build upon something
S0262	yeah
S0261	for the next stage and and for a a a better solution next time
S0262	yeah i've actually get some theory about how that to back that up too not that they might be all that interest in that but anyway erm so yeah i think there's you know a number of ideas worth explore there erm and it's really gonna be find the right people to engage with to kick it off and trial it with and you know be er be also still a good option too because he's somebody who's graduate he's now go back to his home country we don't actually know what he's gonna do there but we could actually just run it with almost like doesn't know what's gonna happen we'll tell him a bite but not very much and we'll have to skype him from jakarta
S0261	yeah for sure
S0262	and do the whole thing
S0261	well the the good thing about it be that you could kick kick start this off with erm 's an example but you can maybe you can tangibly find er another five people so you've get six erm and you can run er a thread of these people be on that you know
S0262	yeah
S0261	and they're try to explore themselves through their own learn network
S0262	yeah
S0261	so they be examples of the people we want we want to help but also to learn from from their experience of bounce out of university trialling things find things out
S0262	mm
S0261	change paths and you can let that threat run through the whole lot of all this stuff you can say we wanna be connect with you for a year
S0262	mm
S0261	and find out where this go
S0262	mm
S0261	and we want to trial we'll get in touch with you every two months and we'll get an update and we'll do a little blah blah blah and we can connect with you through you know we can provide you exposure to your site through ours
S0262	mm mm
S0261	et cetera and we'll get you to be a bite of a guest and you can write a little piece for us
S0262	mm
S0261	and that's what we want as well we want people who do produce stuff for us
S0262	yeah so the so we've get some tease elements to tease people into the community but the subscription to start off with with the model be to have a student base subscription and to show popularity that people be actually part with their money to come into the community and get for example the whole the whole thing they get the whole shebang they get the whole case study they get the forum they get the content
S0261	yeah well we can work out what
S0262	that be
S0261	that be yeah erm
S0262	well there'll have to be some reason for them to part with their money cos i mean what i've notice be that there's a lot of people give stuff out for free out there
S0261	yeah well they're do freemium you see so what they're do be that they give you something to start with this be what i've kind of i haven't put it that way but it's what i've present you've get a core market connect network
S0262	mm
S0261	and that on the side of that you've get this thing so the people come in here you give them back something for free and with that connection you you're teach them about this which be you have to pay money to have a part of this
S0262	yeah
S0261	and and it's gonna take time to to build that momentum but what you'll get be you will get a few er you know the the classic model of the people who be interest the the the newbies be will always go on there and then you've get the main crowd quite a bite later and the you know and then you've get the slow runners
S0262	yeah
S0261	later on
S0262	yeah
S0261	so it's exactly that kind of model erm and we'll have to map out how all that might fit together and what products be involve and what products we need to create to start with
S0262	mm
S0261	and actually what time we really wanna get this thing to be connect so we're get some money in the door
S0262	mm
S0261	now er what i would suggest be that this be why i'm kind of we want to try and start something off now to build the build block as a tester and to get some connections in because it will take six months at least to be get some kind of awareness
S0262	yeah
S0261	of this be what this be
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm online and at that six month period you might then start to introduce the idea of if you've get this pay thing go on
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah erm or it er might even be a longer period but on the other side of it you might go well in this case we would be focus on something else that's bring money in from this side of the things
S0262	yeah
S0261	instead
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah
S0262	and then you have to figure who's what roles people be gonna play you know
S0261	you yeah you
S0262	er do we need just me or you do we need a web developer do we need a content creator
S0261	mm
S0262	you know do we need a film person to edit stuff you know what what's the list of resources we need
S0261	absolutely erm
S0262	and how much be that gonna cost to start up with
S0261	er exactly erm and we we need to present if if we be think just think we need to try and raise some finance in some some manner okay
S0262	mm
S0261	so we need to run something effectively before we can do that
S0262	mm
S0261	we need we need to demonstrate that's er the idea work
S0262	mm
S0261	okay er so you know i don't know how much money be invest in his thing but it's under ten thousand dollars
S0262	mm
S0261	it's somewhere between five and ten i think at the moment that be at a small level and he's try his hardest to to to cut it down to the bare bone to see whether it have some kind of traction
S0262	mm
S0261	now you can argue well if you add that and add that you might get a bigger picture but he's like well i'm gonna try it at this scale if it work at this scale then i'll try the next bite and then the next bite and that take time but what you've get be a sustainable foundation on which you've build something
S0262	yeah i think we'll know when we're gonna start hit the scalability because we'll have to work on social media quite a lot to get people come into the platform and then want to part with their money and then show that we've get those number
S0261	yes
S0262	and then we can start go and knock on doors
S0261	well the other part of it be be try to find mechanisms to draw people in to do stuff erm you know on on a cheap and voluntary basis
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm whether it's they be relative experts that you get guest bloggers to do stuff you people like the students you know to do a couple of free edit for for some videos
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm that we actively outsource some stuff and maybe build a connection where we're get stuff do for cheap cheap from somewhere
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm and you know you can do a fiver to get some basic stuff do
S0262	and also the legal stuff be who er who actually own what
S0261	yeah and there's a guy who's a part of the location rebel community who erm be he's a international lawyer bloke i don't know all i all i see be that he represent er er a range of people and people outside of the location rebel who i've have an awareness of otherwise who be wander entrepreneurs erm so he must have some kind of ability erm whether he's the right kind of person to engage with or whether you get a certain better approach because or better deal because it's through location rebel i don't know you know maybe
S0262	yeah
S0261	we'll start think and maybe know some people who would always who
S0262	mm
S0261	who have some kind of
S0262	media
S0261	i get i get the first thing australia's gotta be one of the most expensive place to actually get any of this stuff do
S0262	which which cost though everything
S0261	anything everything
S0262	just cos resources cost a lot of money
S0261	just bloody everything yeah
S0262	mm
S0261	so so
S0262	but we have to demo it to start off with
S0261	that's right erm
S0262	you know we've gotta make sure that it we've gotta be confident that
S0261	mm
S0262	our ideas be gonna work
S0261	yeah
S0262	and that then we can start think about well shift it say offshore or something like that but we've gotta have the technology we've gotta have the professional you know look thing and er we've gotta have ability to draw in people and fast
S0261	well you've get your mate down the road who's who's er who she's a developer isn't she
S0262	yeah erm yes she be i mean as you know just
S0261	but
S0262	yeah
S0261	to get that kind of context of how much do it cost to build one of these you know and you could go and pick an example off the net and say how much do you reckon it cost them to do that
S0262	yeah
S0261	alright erm
S0262	well i'm hop that we can work with people we we form a good relationship with erm you know i know that they be probably go wanna go off and do their own things which suit me fine because they're gonna pursue their own career say some of these students but at the same time they always need a bite of money
S0261	yeah and they're get some exposure et cetera et cetera
S0262	and as long as it's kind of go up their alley like you know
S0261	mm
S0262	he like a bite of film he like a bite of web development he's obviously do something else as well
S0261	mm
S0262	but to keep him kind of around and about and interest you know
S0261	what about or he's
S0262	's
S0261	think a different picture
S0262	's good at sort of talk to people he'd be probably with a bite more confidence he'd probably be quite a good salesperson but i don't see how he fit in at the moment apart from just talk it up
S0261	or maybe his connections
S0262	mm erm
S0261	it's things like that you know
S0262	he's i'll tell you what he's good at he'd er he'd review it for you he'd evaluate it and be very
S0261	mm
S0262	honest
S0261	yeah okay
S0262	constructive
S0261	alright well we you obviously need somebody who's like that
S0262	mm
S0261	and kick you in the butt
S0262	mm he's good at review things
S0261	and throw in a bite of a a wobbler at you every now and again
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	he's good like that and then erm well actually the law student she might know something about copyright and ipr and all that sort of thing so
S0261	yeah it's kind of a case of at what stage erm
S0262	she's
S0261	you get all that stuff sort
S0262	yeah but she's worth ask she's just that she'll just sort of say well do do you work with people or a company
S0261	mm
S0262	i mean this be another thing where you you're use their personal learn network
S0261	yeah yeah
S0262	to find out stuff that you need to know yourself
S0261	yeah
S0262	at no cost
S0261	absolutely
S0262	to start with
S0261	uh huh
S0262	and then you reach erm at the end of the no cost and you have to then pay for it
S0261	and presumably there be some kind of cheap bizzo type stuff that you can get your nose into
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah yeah you know erm that all come down to detail but i think first we i think what we say the other day be cos tomorrow's tuesday morning be we gonna do anything beyond what we've just do
S0262	no i don't think so
S0261	no
S0262	i think we've gotta we've gotta now just get a feasibility plan together
S0261	so i think we'll have a look at what we've get in front of us
S0262	yeah
S0261	let's see if anything else pop up and er get some kind of map out down
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm
S0262	get some people sign up for this thing
S0261	and yeah it's it's the market type stuff as well to not market it's market research erm frankly i'm not very convince with the name erm and i think that there be some a lot cleverer name that we could come up with
S0262	alright
S0261	one that cross my mind be something call the helper erm
S0262	it make me think of mother's little helper
S0261	yeah but it's just an example of so it's somebody somebody's try to sell a domain anyway but erm
S0262	well we'll talk about that another time
S0261	that kind that kind of thing
S0262	i'm too tire to think about it
S0261	a brainstorm of look at you look at all the the the the type of websites that be actually in people's consciousness now all have a very well craft clever brand brand name
S0262	well i'm sure they do but i think about that in on sunday morning and basically
S0261	yeah i know i know it just
S0262	we just buy it
S0261	yeah
S0262	somebody will have it at some point they'll buy it off us but at the moment that's what it's call
S0261	yeah i don't wanna
S0262	cos it's need to have a name
S0261	run anything on it
S0262	okay
S0261	because once you start with it it's an it's an arse to change
S0262	well we'll sleep on that i'll see how i feel about that i'm not convince yet but we're just gonna change it but yeah alright i'll see
S0261	yeah i i agree with you've gotta crack on
S0262	mm
S0261	erm
S0262	i think you've gotta test it amongst the age group i don't think you and i could make a decision alone on a name until
S0261	mm
S0262	you've actually really test it out there i don't think that's fair to the people that potentially might quite like it
S0261	what would be more rather than port of cool port of call be isn't such a bad idea
S0262	yeah alright now i'm gonna go to sleep
S0261	eh
S0262	cos my brain's just go into meltdown
S0261	okay alright shall we see whether this actually record any of that
S0262	yeah i'm go for a wee
S0261	okay wee wee
