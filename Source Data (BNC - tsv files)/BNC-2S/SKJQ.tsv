S0198	design for fish aren't they yours
S0229	yeah yeah ain't nothing on there worth tear it up
S0198	i think it's just a receipt for something dad

S0229	be just one i say to mum how the hell be i go to get over there to pick it up unless i can leave the car there that day

S0198	yeah take the
S0229	get the driveway clear
S0198	yeah
S0229	and i can back the van in we can load it up whatever we get
S0198	what about be he gonna be here in the morning to help
S0229	yeah
S0198	he will be
S0229	yeah
S0198	but he have to sign on in the afternoon
S0229	yeah well ten o'clock he sign on
S0198	oh
S0229	but he'll have so we can't take him anyway
S0198	ah
S0229	i'll have take the satnav though cos i don't wanna get lose come back
S0198	yeah come back on your own
S0229	yeah
S0198	and then just drop the van off and post the key
S0229	yeah and pick the car up
S0198	yeah cos erm you leave it on your property overnight if it get anything get happen to it
S0229	oh i know i ain't have it no i ain't have that that can go back straightaway i won't i won't leave it too late come back anyway you know once we've do down there then you can get sort out and settle in can't you
S0198	yeah
S0229	then i can come away
S0198	spend the even sort the flat out
S0229	cos i wanna get back cos that's card night and all anyway
S0198	oh yeah wednesday night do you know be mum work a full day that day or
S0229	i don't know
S0198	cos she might she
S0229	no she's work ain't she yeah
S0198	but i mean to
S0229	be another twelve hour shift we'll sort it out
S0198	yeah erm when you pick up the van you wanna look it over and make sure there's no
S0229	yeah
S0198	scratch or cos that's another thing they try and do although if you pay eighty pound
S0229	it cover it yeah i think it's eighty five ain't it
S0198	it's eighty
S0229	eighty then there's what the the tank's full of diesel then what it use you have to put back in
S0198	oh be that what they do
S0229	yeah so if you use twenty five quid's worth of diesel you have to put twenty five back in
S0198	i'll give you the diesel money
S0229	well don't worry about that
S0198	no you're pay enough out although mum'll pay for the rental won't she
S0229	yeah course she be
S0198	but still it's a lot of money
S0229	it's only the once ain't it
S0198	yeah until you have to move it all back out again
S0229	when you move i mean
S0198	you'll have to boot it all won't you
S0229	i'll say we'll take what we think we need and then let the charity shop have the rest
S0198	yeah
S0229	cos time if you think you're gonna hire a van again it's gonna cost more than some of the stuff's worth
S0198	yeah i suppose so unless i can sell it locally
S0229	unless you can sell it locally
S0198	some of the stuff like the stuff 's bring down there i think his parent be only really lend it to us
S0229	be they
S0198	there's table and chair and stuff they're not gonna let us sell them on or anything i think we're gonna have to take them they're gonna have to but that's up to them to pick them back up isn't it
S0229	i mean the only thing that might be any good at the end of the day be the wash machine
S0198	wash machine yeah
S0229	i'd probably get that in the ford focus
S0198	maybe the i reckon i could sell the futon locally even if it's for like thirty quid or something
S0229	yeah keep it tidy keep it yeah you keep it tidy
S0198	someone will have to collect it but
S0229	yeah
S0198	someone'll buy that futons always go especially with all those students around there
S0229	i mean all the pot and pan and that i mean
S0198	yeah once pot and pan be use
S0229	either chuck them or give them to charity
S0198	yeah
S0229	anything electrical
S0198	i still need
S0229	microwave well it ain't worth worry about
S0198	george foreman
S0229	depend where you're gonna end up
S0198	yeah yeah it do if i need it all then i need it all don't i
S0229	if you need then we'll have to get a van back down there
S0198	if i go abroad again for a year though

S0229	yeah
S0198	'll have to hold the fort on his own
S0229	yeah well can't be help can it
S0198	no it'll be fine something i mean it's only really well it's friday night saturday night
S0229	yeah
S0198	his dad might even spend the night
S0229	yeah
S0198	if he want to but then no he can't can he cos he's get to get that van back by eight thirty
S0229	well that's it see that's the trouble
S0198	yeah
S0229	how much do his van cost
S0198	well look up some local company in and think it be gonna cost about forty pound but maybe he wasn't look at the right van or or it wasn't in the right i don't know
S0229	yeah
S0198	that place seem more expensive where we go to today er yesterday so i'm not really sure
S0229	i just wonder if we do do need that long wheelbase cos a short wheelbase would be better and it's be better for park cos i'll
S0198	it's only gotta be the fit a mattress in it hasn't it how short be short wheel
S0229	no the futon bed
S0198	the futon yeah
S0229	sofa bed
S0198	measure it and then look at
S0229	yeah
S0198	measure the futon and then i'll look up the measurements of the thing
S0229	yeah van
S0198	and then if we have to phone them up and change it we'll change it
S0229	well yeah short wheelbase cos when i when we get down there you might just have a car space to get in and unload
S0198	yeah yeah i'm sure wasn't look at the biggest vans just ones that be like a van say that you do wanna have enough space
S0229	yeah it it's only the sofa bed really i mean the mattress'll go in easy
S0198	mm and the wash machine
S0229	the wash machine's nothing
S0198	and some box and suitcases
S0229	yeah be
S0198	also i be think anything like clothe suitcasewise that i mean if there isn't space and there should be space but you can always bring it down in the car
S0229	there'll be plenty of room to pack it in
S0198	yeah
S0229	plenty of room
S0198	it might be cheaper to get short base
S0229	i ain't worry about that it's just i down the other end
