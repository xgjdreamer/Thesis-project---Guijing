S0439	i want to be blunt with you you know like
S0440	mm
S0439	you've get to make change you've get to change your job you've get to change what you're do
S0440	mm
S0439	because you're not help yourself you're just make it worse

S0439	you be like oh there there
S0440	mm as i say i'm just i'm just i'm just really i'm just really piss off that i still haven't sort my job out
S0439	yeah
S0440	but when i speak to the woman she say right she say put a note on your personnel file er this have be outstanding and have still not be erm sort and then she say we can you know we'll look at it
S0439	yeah but like at the moment we're well we've merge with production so we're now do production and project coordination
S0440	mm
S0439	and we be tell when we be merge that our team be erm we be go to get reduce er reduce the amount of project we're do and increase our workload like to compensate so we be have some of our project take away right that hasn't be the case we i use to have erm like sixteen project erm and apparently we're not have new job descriptions and we're not have any pay rise and i'm a bite like well that's not very fair and then my boss like my head of department she get a promotion recently
S0440	yeah
S0439	and i bet she get a salary increase
S0440	yeah
S0439	and it's just a bite like we be the ones who have suddenly take on this massive extra work
S0440	oh we're the same we're the same
S0439	and you're not give us the credit
S0440	we're the same i have be give a complete job which if i be do this job as a standalone job

S0440	i'm do exams and data management
S0439	and you're on
S0440	and i'm twenty
S0439	twenty twenty twenty eight
S0440	twenty eight and that be what's really upset me and it because i can't get it sort out before i can't do it on the pay and benefit
S0439	yeah
S0440	thing from the council so i then have to go in back into the i now go into the public sector er the private sector
S0439	would you want to go into would you want to change your job and go into the private sector
S0440	that's well i be we're move into the private sector
S0439	oh i see when be they gonna be able to pay you more

S0439	yeah wish i be on thirty five grand
S0440	you will be i be on
S0439	yeah
S0440	at your age i be on four thousand eight hundred
S0439	erm erm be australian and she erm her year run up she's be here for a year and then her second year run up this time next year and she be like why don't you come over to australia and i be like that be so tempt but she doesn't want to leave but erm
S0440	so her
S0439	sponsorship yeah so and her company it cost a lot to sponsor somebody to stay in the country so i think she'll go
S0440	what company be she with
S0439	she's like erm i i don't know what it's call but she's er she's a social worker so she go to people's house and like help them like not like a carer but like erm
S0440	no
S0439	somebody like you know manage like don't really know just look after families who need extra support so and then erm it be really weird our head of like the head of our department not but like the head head she resign two weeks ago erm and who be the head of like in erm education
S0440	uhu
S0439	he turn round and his email be really cryptic it be like erm this be really sad and we're gonna get together over the next few days and decide what the next move be for us and we haven't get any replacement and stuff so we don't know whether there's gonna be a bite of a restructure like whether someone like who's gonna take her place whether anybody's gonna take her place
S0440	well if there's a restructure
S0439	yeah
S0440	what they might do be move you up because they've recognise that you're good haven't they
S0439	yeah but
S0440	they might move you move you up
S0439	i don't think they will we're
S0440	well you don't know
S0439	no because we've you we've just restructure like we merge production and project coordination
S0440	doesn't matter
S0439	they're not gonna do it but erm
S0440	they might do you don't know
S0439	but erm yeah but everybody be a bite like why be leave it's suddenly we've get to this point in the department when we're all like really the it the the department be perform really really well and we're make lot like enough money but now she's resign
S0440	and you don't know where she's go or anything
S0439	yeah she's go to erm
S0440	so she be obviously headhunted by then
S0439	well yeah we work really closely with them they well they work just down the road from us so erm people it just er seem a bite weird like people weren't sure whether they whether she might have be like force out by or whether like she just didn't fit in the department anymore whether
S0440	no i would suspect that she erm that work closely with someone say we've get a job come like say to me get a job come up why don't you apply for it
S0439	yeah
S0440	that's probably what happen so if you work closely with you might get headhunted
S0439	i doubt it but a lot well a lot of people from do go to
S0440	mm do a lot more international work don't they
S0439	no they're just the examinations board they just control all the exams
S0440	assess yeah they do though don't they

S0439	at least they have replacement paper
S0440	well they always do
S0439	oh do they
S0440	they always make up they always do replacement paper use but quite often the replacement paper be easier

S0439	but to be fair if dad die would we still speak to
S0440	no
S0439	exactly
S0440	but i wouldn't it wouldn't be because i didn't like them
S0439	no you just wouldn't have anything to talk to them about
S0440	but this be because die after his mother
S0439	mm
S0440	which mean that the brother have to split the house
S0439	mm
S0440	where he wouldn't have have to if have die beforehand
S0439	i see it's so sad isn't it
S0440	uhu

S0439	no me and would we'd be fine we wouldn't argue about money and house and stuff
S0440	no
S0439	we'd just split everything evenly
S0440	mm
S0439	yeah which be what i would like you to do that's exactly what i would like you to do
S0439	yeah i think it's quite sad that you and dad neither you nor dad get on well with your sibling but then like i i think it's just because
S0440	it's the first
S0439	your dad's they be that age gap
S0440	no i think the problem with dad be

S0439	yeah yeah but they've never get on then i wouldn't they like dad's always say that he's never really know his sister
S0440	mm but but i just think to myself you know it's very sad i get on really well with i don't have a problem with but er for her to turn round after he'd already say to her
S0439	and do you want some money
S0440	do you want the money but the thing i do hate about be the fact that she ignore her mother

S0440	no i've be over to see i don't know how many time more
S0439	yeah
S0440	erm it just it do it just annoy me that she's so erm
S0439	against her mum yeah
