S0179	okay well default to start with of course
S0058	yeah
S0179	and then what be you have
S0058	ha but but
S0179	sorry put the name
S0058	that one ha it's a bite like erm bolognaise but it have lamb instead of mince
S0179	ooh that sound lovely
S0058	it be actually i've have it before
S0179	i might have a carne calzone
S0058	ha
S0179	sort
S0058	ha ha that be really easy
S0179	wine
S0058	oh yeah yeah a bottle of wine yeah um red
S0179	how about the chianti
S0058	erm wow yeah it sound nice
S0179	cool
S0058	cool
S0179	erm yeah it take me exactly ten minutes to get to the bus stop
S0058	be it slightly faster
S0179	no
S0058	no it isn't
S0179	it take me nine minutes i'm not convince it's closer
S0058	mm
S0179	it feel closer but i'm really particularly come back if you stay on the bus as it go round to the heart and get off there i think
S0058	yes
S0179	that's closer
S0058	that's closer but the not all of them do that be the thing because the one i the ones i come back on er at night do but then the really late ones i don't think they do
S0179	i think they do where else do they go ones go
S0058	i'm not sure cos the timetables don't seem to show that but
S0179	well let's see what it do tonight
S0058	in all fairness we could ask in all fairness we could ask the bus driver when we get on and say be you gonna go round erm
S0179	
S0058	and then back out at the church like they're gonna know where they're go
S0179	no cos the one's in the morning go around the other way so they start by go like and then come back to lower then
S0058	oh what do you mean great then lower
S0179	sorry yeah they go great then lower whereas the even i think they just do lower and not great
S0058	oh okay
S0179	so they start by go that way and then come back the other way
S0058	but on a night they do come in from great though
S0179	only earlier on in the night
S0058	mm it's very confuse you see yeah i mean er i think the best thing to do be ask where it go
S0179	oh yeah they do come in from great
S0058	yeah they do cos in the morning they come in that way to er er stop outside morrison's cos i'm on it but then on a night they come in that way so i i can never work it out
S0179	it's so weird
S0058	i always look at the timetable and then i just think it's too much effort and i don't actually care so erm yeah worth ask i think
S0179	mm
S0058	cos i i think it be quicker from the hub it's it's definitely less than like nine minutes from there but get off at morrison's i'm not sure it be
S0179	mm
S0058	i'm not sure there's much in it
S0179	i be pave it down erm i didn't
S0058	really
S0179	really have enough time to look cos i have to get in and get change sort of in et cetera
S0058	oh thank you
S0179	erm i've take the other one back
S0058	oh bless thank you
S0179	erm but i've the main entrance to the road be still block
S0058	right
S0179	but they do appear to have get pave part of it so
S0058	awesome
S0179	one can only assume that that time cos the rest of the week be actually fine
S0058	ha um um i mean i'm wonder if
S0179	consistently taylor wimpey
S0058	yeah i'm wonder if what they actually mean in the letter be
S0179	we'll be do it throughout this time
S0058	we'll be do yeah exactly
S0179	yeah i think
S0058	we then we won't be there at the weekend and then we'll be there again on the twelfth be probably what they mean which be really badly um put
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah
S0179	oh dear
S0058	oh well at least they're do something
S0179	yeah
S0058	ah i be gonna ask you to bring my inhaler my chest be a bite tight
S0179	really
S0058	just a little bite yeah
S0179	i would've bring one from work if you'd tell me
S0058	ha ha it wouldn't have be as retro as my other
S0179	no it wouldn't have be it would have be i still can't believe the nhs provide those they're so shite compare to our ones
S0058	be they what like well yeah i mean i guess it would cost them a lot though to get anything half decent whereas that's presumably a very basic
S0179	the one's we make aren't expensive they're design to have very low component cost
S0058	mm
S0179	the problem be
S0058	and the nhs just haven't look at them or be it that they're just not common enough
S0179	the nhs just haven't well they're make for specific drug by specific pharmaceutical company
S0058	right
S0179	so they'll sell the drug and the device
S0058	right okay
S0179	erm
S0058	ah so the nhs presumably couldn't just be like oh we'll just pour you a bite of our stuff in it and what be that i don't know if those blue ones be use for anything other than salbutamol i i don't
S0179	what's salbutamol
S0058	it's just the drug for like when you get asthma people
S0179	right possibly not it's just very common um the point of our ones be two fold firstly um it it use um
S0058	yes thank you
S0179	thank you
S0179	i think so yes please
S0058	yes i think so
S0058	erm to start with can we get the er seleccin e classica please
S0179	yeah that sound fantastic
S0058	yeah it sound good
S0179	your be always good
S0058	yep
S0058	and then can i get the please
S0179	and can i have the carne calzone please
S0179	and could we have a bottle of the chianti please
S0058	thank very much
S0058	hmm cheer ha
S0179	cheer
S0058	quick hydration be er
S0179	yes
S0058	be require
S0179	i'm look forward to this
S0058	mm yeah i'm starve
S0179	it felt like a friday today
S0058	yeah yeah it really have do which be nice actually
S0179	mm
S0058	i'm please we have time i work till sort of half fiveish and then erm and then run and then meet you in perfect time
S0179	you've have a long day
S0058	i know i didn't really have a lunch break particularly either
S0179	wow
S0058	i just you know end up do things so yeah i have actually have a reasonable length day yeah
S0179	brilliant okay um
S0058	mm
S0179	so yes any other news to report
S0058	no no um same um hopefully there'll be some more when they er get out to this even
S0179	i be think about when heather turn up
S0058	yeah
S0179	if she turn up on the sunday
S0058	yeah
S0179	in reasonable time
S0058	yeah
S0179	we can book her on a gym induction
S0058	yep
S0179	get her on a pay as you go thing for a week
S0058	yeah
S0179	er actually it might be slightly cheaper to get her to pay for one month if it mean go like four or five time for that week
S0058	yeah i think if we if we have a think about how many time we're gonna go then yeah it might be i don't i don't know how much a month be if it's a one off though
S0179	cos you pay thirty pound for the induction
S0058	yeah
S0179	now you don't pay that if you get the contract so that'll be
S0058	but er you do pay that if you pay monthly though
S0179	oh do you
S0058	i think so
S0179	oh okay yeah that'll be cos otherwise you'd just pay for one month and then cancel erm it's not an active gym she's a member of in leeds be it if they have the same class
S0058	no no she's it's a uni gym
S0179	oh okay
S0058	and er so it's free completely free for the students which be what should have but yeah um with a decent set up um
S0179	be these class free
S0058	her class be free yeah
S0179	wow that's good
S0058	i think the uni must pay for the instructor and stuff whereas at the gym obviously
S0179	that's impressive
S0058	it's very impressive yeah consider how much they you know so like twenty five people in the class so you know five quid each be the the sort of go rate obviously it doesn't
S0179	no that's the amount the gym get so that's to make you go to the gym
S0058	mm
S0179	a fraction of that will go to i'd say half at most would go to the instructor
S0058	company well it's probably to the company who
S0179	so it will go to the company and then
S0058	and then the instructor get some of that
S0179	the instructors yeah the instructor be probably get like twenty thirty quid from that
S0058	yeah oh no entirely yeah um but the uni must be erm must be pay the company which be however much which be pretty good
S0179	yes
S0058	nice deal but yeah um yeah so okay so so um yeah so sunday gym induction bite of dinner
S0179	and i think well i think that if we'd get someone else for dinner
S0058	yeah
S0179	like etcetera er that'll make four so we could have a game of badminton
S0058	this be true this be true that might be nice okay
S0179	and then then either then on monday there's no particular reason she can't come and join in on a free weight session
S0058	erm i don't know if she'll fancy that but if she doesn't she can do something else like she might prefer to just do some cross train or something and we can just do our normal
S0179	yeah indeed and then what else be there
S0058	tuesday i think we should go to body pump
S0179	okay i'll run you go to body pump i dunno or perhaps i can do body pump as well
S0058	well it's up to you i mean don't
S0179	actually that might be better i haven't be to body pump in a while erm
S0058	i just think that might be quite entertain
S0179	then won't work cos we're not gonna be able to book her in until she's register as a member
S0058	yeah it'll probably be full
S0179	and by sunday afternoon it'll be full
S0058	oh okay never mind
S0179	we'll definitely have to do circuit on wednesday
S0058	yes of course she have to meet
S0179	and then something else week
S0058	yeah
S0179	cool
S0058	sound good oh no hang on it's her birthday on wednesday oh well ha circuit it be ha
S0179	indeed and just i can just imagine and a big shout out for the birthday girl
S0179	he could probably be persuade to do something
S0058	i'm sure he would
S0179	erm
S0058	wouldn't put it past him
S0179	ah
S0058	mm thank you

S0179	yeah if you want to erm but yeah we can have a roast dinner that sunday night couldn't we
S0058	yeah um she do um she doesn't like beef so we could do lamb again i think investigate the realms of chicken might be a bridge too far
S0179	we could do a bite of but yeah that lamb's a good default
S0058	mm
S0179	although much more expensive
S0058	mm i dunno though morrison's might do a decent
S0179	i do prefer it with the i do prefer it as a meat because you can have mint sauce with it which be better
S0058	yeah which be yummy yeah
S0179	but we can er oh it be very nice last week just just sort of chill out
S0058	yeah
S0179	in the lounge

S0058	yeah
S0179	we can get a big vat of it and just serve up
S0058	i be gonna say yeah we could just erm we might have to do it in the wok
S0179	yeah i be anticipate that
S0058	or how we always do it in the wok and then put yeah i hope we have enough room in the bowl for pasta and two garlic bread
S0179	maybe a bite more than that big garlic bread
S0179	ooh
S0058	yeah
S0179	interest
S0058	ha we deal with this last time for how long

S0179	well that and just two liqueurs screw the coffee
S0058	er well yes or you can just just have the erm just er just for that
S0179	yeah
S0058	but they might yeah they might give us that
S0179	be it
S0058	hold the coffee
S0179	can you just give us the liqueur and the coffee separately
S0058	yeah actually no
S0179	this be go to the someone at work will appreciate it
S0058	hmm erm
S0179	oi oh dear erm so yeah i think that sound like a good plan
S0058	cool and then maybe go back on saturday but i've um get a couple of bits and bob sort out for us so as in one of the people who commission classics erm not the senior editor he's busy most of that week but somebody else and health and safety induction book
S0179	oh goodie
S0058	very excite it's necessary anyone who come in have to have one
S0179	what do it involve
S0058	i think it's just a a kind of where be the fire exit erm
S0179	where the
S0058	where what would you do in an event sorry not where be the fire exit what would you do in the event of a fire procedures
S0179	hit the fire alarm if safely possible
S0058	don't run with don't
S0179	and exit the build do not come back in for your stuff
S0058	yeah don't run with scissor don't you well you know in cold weather the site might be icy it's this sort of thing i think
S0179	mm
S0058	that they just have to do
S0179	they don't have to they're choose to
S0058	yeah but the woman who do the heath and safety be really nice she's lovely so it's not a horrible chore to have to do your health and safety thing
S0179	i didn't have to do one
S0058	do you not
S0179	no
S0058	you have to do a thing for your be it drill when you have to have the safety course
S0179	there be a class for it be open beam laser
S0058	yeah that's what i mean
S0179	but the class don't come higher than that
S0058	oh right so that would cut anything
S0179	basically well not exactly but it's the most dangerous type of laser there be
S0058	right
S0179	within that class there's possibly even not the most interest er but the u s military have finally develop a laser which can sink a ship
S0179	admittedly it be a small ship and they essentially set fire to it
S0179	erm
S0058	right
S0179	a bite underwhelming
S0058	so so a lighter could could sink a ship and like okay
S0179	well not from a mile away
S0058	ah yes that's true fair enough
S0179	here
S0179	it's go out
S0058	yeah throw a match at them take this
S0179	at which point we be just essentially just throw shell which be pretty much what they've do for hundreds of years
S0058	well yeah it's not really an advance ha hmm yes that should be good
S0179	yeah so that's the laser
S0058	ah it's scary
S0179	yes we we be speculate a bite for the erm what you have to sacrifice to the spirit of the laser drill in order to get it to work
S0179	we've get two summer students come
S0058	ha ha nice ha
S0179	we've get
S0058	do you want to make the greatest sacrifice for this company
S0179	well we've get a uni student and two summer students
S0058	oh okay cool how long
S0179	i'm gonna corrupt one of them
S0058	how long do uni be it a a whole year
S0179	yeah
S0058	with with tcp
S0179	yeah
S0058	nice
S0179	it would be a good placement
S0058	it would be an awesome placement yeah
S0179	the odds of be employ afterwards be possibly questionable
S0058	mm entirely but it's a very good
S0179	well it's good for us cos we they'll essentially be at almost zero fee rate
S0058	yes
S0179	erm so it's fantastic for project leaders cos they get sort of free labour and i'm occasionally look for a bitch to do some of my board work
S0058	yeah work experience ha ha oh yeah ha ha
S0179	yes
S0058	do you do like school's work experience or do you just really not have anything that could be do
S0179	no it's all pretty skilled i mean it's a great work experience far better than my one be it'll be a good gig
S0058	yeah yeah ah i think that be a sharey thing
S0179	what
S0058	i think that thing that just go past be a sharey thing it's very cute
S0179	that thing
S0058	mm um
S0179	er it would be a good gig if you could get it
S0058	mm how do you get it be it be they selective
S0179	you apply
S0058	about work experience or
S0179	they won't be hugely cos they can't be really
S0058	exactly yeah that's what i be think like
S0179	i mean i i i mean you'd probably need you know straight a a level but that's not exactly selective
S0058	mm but that's not you know i be gonna say it's not the biggest differentiator mm yeah great opportunity
S0179	mm
S0058	but yeah i guess it's kind of frustrate if you think this be an amaze company i really wanna come here but then like you're just not good enough and in spite the fact that you've work there for a year and sort of make really good relationships and stuff it's really sad in a way on the other hand i guess you can't employ people for kind of sentimental reason
S0179	yes indeed
S0058	not really sentimental but i guess
S0179	so i saw some pig skin today
S0058	you saw some
S0179	yep
S0058	mm
S0179	out by uxbridge
S0058	good good ha be that where like cos it's
S0179	what's this what's it er the easiest available substitute for human skin as in the local butcher's get it and
S0058	mm

S0179	anyway sorry you be say
S0058	yeah um i can't remember what i be say oh yeah no
S0179	you have something in the cupboard

S0179	you know um please just use it for meet one point please don't use the coffee machine in there
S0179	for erm just to take coffee back to your desk because it's very expensive
S0058	right so hang on so this what be this room for it's for meet with internal people at which you can have a coffee out of the machine
S0179	mm but it's an open plan space so basically it's for brainstorm sessions and just general chat
S0058	that's ridiculous
S0179	mm and time
S0058	so but do you have like a sort of a lunch area
S0179	no well yeah
S0058	like a normal sort of coffee room
S0179	well we've get the moat house which be sort of for a cafeteria
S0058	right
S0179	slash restaurant on site
S0058	mm
S0179	which you can eat your own food in
S0058	but it would make more sense really to have a a one in the office
S0179	yeah
S0058	you could nip in have a quick sandwich read the paper that's that
S0179	yeah well particularly in bad weather we don't want to walk across the courtyard
S0058	mm inconvenient true if an employee doesn't want to walk all that way or sit at their desk
S0179	well in all fairness we've get some in our office we have a company corner sorry a cosy corner it's call
S0058	ah be that what it's call
S0179	yeah
S0058	cute you say that without irony
S0179	well possibly because we have a high proportion of women so that's why it's
S0058	right yeah
S0179	acquire that name
S0058	mm i'm dread what's gonna happen when we move over to the other build as in all of elt be just gonna be in like a massive um open plan space which
S0179	yeah like most offices
S0058	well no as in it be kind of like that at the minute but it's different floor and a bite better whereas this be gonna be massive i don't know how cram it's gonna be and i don't know what the coffee provision be gonna be like you know
S0179	mm
S0058	as in you can't have one coffee area for all those people um so and i'm just worry we'll
S0179	do you use your coffee area
S0058	yeah sometimes a lot of people do use it
S0179	what for
S0058	have lunch meet sometimes it's just nice to have a space where you know you put the kettle on and read the paper for two or three minutes while it boil and just sort of you know
S0179	mm
S0058	it's a bite nicer
S0179	yes we don't do that erm
S0058	hmm mm
S0179	incidentally um can i um at some point can i just come in and look round your office
S0058	yeah i guess so don't see why not
S0179	i might need a health and safety induction
S0058	well yeah mm messy mm yes no that's actually i'm sure you can

S0179	anyway why not er cease the
S0058	hope it's not gonna be like a er like a nettle

S0179	do you think so
S0058	oh well yeah i mean it's very cool
S0179	it's a trade off between that and speed
S0058	yeah

S0058	hmm in sweden you want a suked up b70

S0179	very corrupt
S0058	mm
S0179	but yes i mean
S0058	but in the scheme of things not quite as bad as some of the others on that list hmm
S0179	no i mean on balance it's do the best out of the former british colonies
S0058	mm
S0179	really rather well in fact
S0058	yeah

S0058	i would assume i don't know i haven't hear from her i'm i'm sure she's have her scan maybe not i don't know
S0179	pregnancies
S0058	what sorry
S0179	pregnancies
S0058	yeah but yeah um may be she's just store it all up for when we have a talk again
S0179	sorry
S0058	may be she's just store it all for when we next talk
S0179	okay well she's not gonna be at at the weekend be she
S0058	ah she might be i could ask her
S0179	er you're get to check
S0058	shall i ask her
S0179	i'd say you could you probably could go on saturday night cos erm well actually your parent might appreciate some company wouldn't they
S0058	possibly yeah we'll see i mean
S0179	i'm stay in um it occur to me this week i've be tire cos we've be go away every single weekend
S0058	right
S0179	um
S0058	i mean if you don't wanna go er this weekend like i could get the train
S0179	no no no i'll um
S0058	be you sure i mean to stay after walk
S0179	oh well that's alright that's not a that's just a day trip
S0058	that's not like yeah
S0179	it's probably about four or five drive actually but but mentally it's just a day trip
S0058	in one day yeah cos the night before will be really relax
S0179	yeah
S0058	be it depress that i've texted more recently than i've texted
S0179	no
S0058	not particularly actually yeah
S0179	i text more than you class as harassment
S0058	sorry
S0179	i class i'd text him more if it didn't count as harassment
S0058	ha ha yeah well it's the problem
S0179	i do that
S0058	i know you do
S0179	it's occur to me dad could get just a pay as you go membership at the gym which would enable him to use it with
S0058	er your
S0179	yeah
S0058	yeah the one in harlington you mean
S0179	no
S0058	dad your dad
S0179	yes the idea be that he and i could alternate weeks with
S0058	oh sorry with yes sorry i'd forget about that i couldn't work out why you'd need the one so would he need to be a member to get 's personal train sessions in the gym
S0179	probably
S0058	probably
S0179	but you can get a free pay as you go membership
S0058	mm
S0179	and one could yeah to to sort of have a gym session you that'll probably be free if you have a pd session or it should be
S0058	yeah yeah you'd think so
S0179	so er beyond an induction that could work quite nicely
S0058	cool yeah he might be keen on that
S0179	i can't believe they charge you thirty quid for an induction
S0058	really bad
S0179	it be really bad to
S0058	like five minutes of someone go this be a run machine this be a this be a cross trainer these be heavy these be weight
S0179	yeah
S0058	ha thank you ha
S0179	mm yes well i'd say my knowledge of the functionality of these machine be severely impair ie almost non existent
S0058	the which machine
S0179	any of these machine these gymming machine
S0058	what the person give the induction
S0179	no no my as in i don't use any of the feature or anything
S0058	oh right yeah i see what you mean yeah
S0179	now the row machine i click just row
S0058	ha yeah treadmill just run ha actually no the treadmill i no you need to change the units
S0179	yeah which be an but have get over them it's fundamentally quite nice
S0058	mm oh my god the treadmill in the gym at work rock when you run on it probably er why my foot be in a state probably run more on one foot than the other
S0179	still good for core stability
S0058	yeah well that's what i think erm and
S0179	you're um gonna be in good shape for this ten k
S0058	well yeah i'm i'm think i can probably do it
S0179	i think you probably can in fact i'm sure you can
S0058	ha it will be actually easier
S0179	i'll have the crust if you don't want it
S0058	yeah it will actually be easier do um the ten k when there's things to look at because um i think i've get snow blinders from that run i'm run literally into a white paint wall could have be right up against the wall white wall
S0179	i couldn't do that
S0058	it's it be
S0179	you need something to focus on i mean in the distance to maintain your balance that's really you should get them to move it
S0058	oh well yeah i'm actually gonna write to them whoever run it i'm not exactly sure and say one your treadmill be wonky get the floor fix erm two move it so that you're not run into a white wall do you know
S0179	preferably a window or a tv screen at the very least something else in the gym
S0058	but i be wonder at i be wonder about them get another tv and put it
S0179	or a mirror would do
S0058	cos there's a tv but there's two there's a treadmill little window treadmill
S0179	that's stupid
S0058	then tv so if you're on the treadmill's you if you wanna look at the tv you're like that and that's why i be on that treadmill in front of the wall rather than that one because on this one you you you your kind of attention's draw whereas that you know the far one you're further
S0179	that sound utterly ridiculous
S0058	it be ridiculous yeah
S0179	that be lovely
S0058	great thank you yeah
S0179	yeah the er the rib be a nice change to the chicken actually yeah
S0058	yeah they're good
S0058	oh right
S0179	mm
S0058	yeah sure
S0058	fair enough
S0179	yeah
S0179	you can shove them in my direction it's fine
S0058	i be gonna say yeah there should be a little exchange service in a restaurant if you order sort of a meal which have a bite that you don't like you can swap it
S0179	i do it's you
S0058	oh fair enough mm but yeah no it's a ridiculous gym erm
S0179	have you get a free weight section
S0058	yeah
S0179	you
S0058	no it's it's really good actually
S0179	you see that's what i say about our at that stupid meet when we should be at work er can you just keep shift round a bite cos otherwise it's difficult to talk to you
S0058	i know i'm try to stretch my legs out
S0179	erm
S0058	yes erm
S0179	erm because
S0058	that would have be so much better
S0179	well no i just suggest a free weight gym so a bench you know a couple of bar a machine if we're feel like if we're feel you know expansive but that would be a sponge floor and that's about it and it would be a really good space because so much of tcp be men and most be sort of fairly active women actually i reckon you'd get
S0058	well it could
S0179	quite a lot of business do in a gym work out over lunch time
S0058	could you not just stick a few cardio machine in there or would it or would that just er er make the cost
S0179	you're get more expensive and they need to put an ac unit in there so
S0058	mm
S0179	like heavy ac
S0058	yeah okay ha i don't know what the cup one's get but if the window be open we'd just suspect it might be the ac or it's warm ha
S0179	see we've already get shower and stuff so
S0058	mm
S0179	realistically
S0058	so it wouldn't actually be that much of an issue
S0179	no
S0058	suggest it
S0179	i
S0058	it's the kind of company where they actually listen to the employees
S0179	no it's not
S0058	no
S0179	as evidence by the stupid room
S0058	well yeah fair enough
S0179	they've probably spend quite a lot of money on
S0058	do anyone say though
S0179	as in they've get well you should read this email it's like
S0058	ha don't do anything in this room
S0179	yeah basically
S0058	i love stuff like that
S0179	well so it's get a posh coffee machine and it's not for clients and we've be tell not to use for other purpose so it's like why
S0058	in all fairness there's a posh coffee machine in um the centre you know the sort of sport where the gym sort of be
S0179	yeah
S0058	there's a posh coffee machine in there which be sort of lock so you can't use it unless you be on a train course in there so it's like oh ha
S0179	be it free
S0058	yeah
S0179	um
S0058	but it's it's one of those ones they always have in car show room
S0179	yep
S0058	with the little sachets i love those
S0179	i mention that to er to today when we be talk about pig skin
S0058	mm
S0179	that er i wasn't in fact keen for coffee that er you have the strength one of the car show room
S0058	ha ha yeah
S0179	i think it be quite er quite funny
S0058	hmm mm oh hang on aren't we get the bmw next weekend
S0179	i think it's this weekend but
S0058	this weekend oh right
S0179	i haven't have a call
S0058	oh right
S0179	i don't effectively want it for anything i mean to be fair with the p40 come out there's not a huge amount of point
S0058	no but i mean just if you fancy borrow a fancy car but it's pointless sort of change our plan and make it a bite more of a you know
S0179	yeah
S0058	pointless it be a erm an inconvenience for us
S0179	i mean originally we want a zero d it's a better engine i have to hate to say it but it i mean i haven't see the new stats for the d4 stop start
S0058	no
S0179	and slightly improve efficiency in general but it would be nought to sixty in probably eight and a half second which be a second slower than the and it's probably subtly less efficient
S0058	mm
S0179	so be that that
S0058	engine wise
S0179	actually that's not as good
S0058	mm
S0179	objectively but i mean
S0058	yeah
S0179	it it will sound better because it's a five cylinder
S0058	mm
S0179	and five cylinders sound awesome
S0058	roar
S0179	yeah indeed
S0179	i don't like them i don't understand it
S0058	be this or be this general people top gear
S0179	who's
S0058	sweet you be talk to him about engine noise weren't you and
S0179	oh um no ah think of bricks someone's hit the back wall there next to our shed
S0058	have they
S0179	there's bits of brick all over the floor not huge bits
S0058	oh
S0179	but sort of er you know perhaps sort of i don't know that kind of size someone's take the corner off the wall
S0058	shit do you reckon that's and again
S0179	i'm not sure
S0058	well there be a few people drive through there though i mean fair enough our neighbour don't because their cars be out the front
S0179	yeah
S0058	and they and they do move the one at the back though don't they
S0179	occasionally
S0058	so there's there's few people that could be that's a pain cos it's our house
S0179	but it's
S0058	at the end of the day
S0179	yeah that be our
S0058	oh thank you thank you
S0179	er that be what's in our property
S0058	yeah well exactly well that's what i mean
S0179	but it doesn't make any difference
S0058	the road isn't but
S0179	exactly it'll be concern their damage their cars more than us
S0058	lovely
S0179	well like i say it'll be damage their cars far more than damage our house
S0058	well yeah but
S0179	but that's not the point
S0058	but no that's not the point
S0179	there be a principle involve thank you
S0058	i'm fine thank you
S0179	i'm okay thank you
S0179	yes
S0058	yeah we be thank you
S0058	thank you i'm sure this be different to last time it's more more curly
S0058	anyway ha it look funny doesn't it erm shall we do you wanna oh you've get a glass there ha i don't wanna finish mine 'till you've er start yours
S0179	mm
S0058	very quickly
S0179	mm but yeah we should er we should look into that i'm contemplate put spike on it
S0058	well i mean be talk about put a protector thing on but i mean in all fairness he's not the most um
S0179	active
S0058	yeah
S0179	i mean i'm up for that in principle
S0058	mm
S0179	i mean i think what we might say be you wanna put it on i'll help you do it
S0058	yeah definitely
S0179	but
S0058	you get all the beer and um
S0179	another thing be it's our house i don't think he's really into it but
S0058	yeah quite
S0179	but that's ridiculous that that's happen and no one's tell us about it it must have do some serious damage to the car
S0058	in all fairness we could just go and look at the cars
S0179	yeah i'm contemplate it well as in we could check the height and the at the time
S0058	mm well exactly you know
S0179	but i don't see how you could do that it's not exactly hide
S0058	could it be one of the people who turn
S0179	yeah possibly but he have to be turn pretty tightly
S0058	mm do you think they've just misjudge the turn cos i mean in all fairness though i mean and have hit that and they've be go forward through it so
S0179	yeah but that they
S0058	no i'm fine thank you
S0179	i'm good thank
S0179	but they put tyre mark onto it that's a whole different
S0058	mm
S0179	level of impact
S0058	yeah
S0179	yeah it's okay to lose a bite of rubber
S0058	well be there be there any paint or anything
S0179	not that i could see it be dark mind
S0058	mm
S0179	so i dunno it's er
S0058	mm it's weird
S0179	a bite of a mystery
S0058	hmm i guess that's the problem with live in a house that everyone else drive through
S0179	oh
S0058	hmm mm as it very much be
S0179	underneath underneath
S0058	ha ha yeah mm
S0179	well like i say in practice it have almost zero impact on us
S0058	mm
S0179	i mean it be just the principle
S0058	yeah
S0179	ah yes maintenance company remind my dad about that
S0058	mm yeah i'm slightly concern
S0179	it also make me slightly curious at what taylor wimpy do to have invest the first year's the balance of the first year's maintenance
S0058	what do you mean er mm like
S0179	they've get that on completion i wonder who the hell they give it to
S0058	well quite mm hmm in the pocket ha nothing's ever straight forward i dunno some things have be quite straightforward
S0179	such be life
S0058	such be life indeed such be house buy
S0179	well
S0058	we haven't do badly really it's
S0179	no i mean i keep think about sort of enjoy my lovely commute
S0058	mm yeah
S0179	and compare it to like oh or whoever who's like
S0058	yeah
S0179	live in a shit hole
S0058	yeah
S0179	with a load of randomers you've get one room
S0058	yeah
S0179	and pay quite a lot for it probably pay more than half what we pay for the mortgage and
S0058	yeah oh oh definitely
S0179	the for it not even do a phd it's like
S0058	well from what he be say though he's apply and he might be move away
S0179	mm
S0058	yet i don't think he's quite cos i mean be kind of very good for cambridge maths but from what say he's not i mean i don't know if he get a first
S0179	i'm not really sure if he i think he do one year
S0058	right ha i bet yeah cos you remember all of that cos you know who be at scholars dinner
S0179	no
S0058	no you don't remember
S0179	we be talk about it
S0058	oh right maybe i be out of the room at the time
S0179	no i think you be just drink
S0058	hmm mm right so he get a first one year but not the others
S0179	yeah
S0058	out of four yeah fair enough might be move you know on
S0179	it be possible
S0058	i imagine he'll get a phd elsewhere not a problem
S0179	i wouldn't assume
S0179	mm it's funny he's always strike me as pretty competent
S0058	mm well i think he's competent but in a slightly more general sense whereas be very very very competent at maths but pretty inept at kind of
S0179	life
S0058	life generally whereas just seem fairly competent have say that not always ha he's slightly unusual
S0179	he's lovely
S0058	mm well no i mean it in the best way but
S0179	it's unusual but none of those things be in a bad way
S0058	mm much like though like be unusual in a very nice way except for when he be like i'm forego company for the next six years thank you i'm gonna end him a facebook message
S0179	and say oi geezer
S0058	in no offence if ever if i have if i write on
S0179	lovely thank you
S0058	it's great thank you yeah if i write on his wall he'll have to respond
S0179	yes
S0058	that's a good idea i'm gonna do that he doesn't need to respond to texts because he probably doesn't he's probably have his phone off for the last six months because it's a distraction
S0179	mm i say we're come to get you
S0058	ha ha yeah hmm we're come to rescue you from that dark place what ah i think you be pause to say something but you be just chew
S0179	but yeah i do erm it be a good situation to be in
S0058	mm definitely
S0179	um oh yeah oh yeah so there's an article in i dunno the telegraph or something there's a link to it on facebook someone have read it erm
S0058	right
S0179	compare the er fortunes of two cambridge graduate i reckon
S0058	oh interest
S0179	well it's
S0058	erm which one the one from the year below us or the one from the year above us
S0179	below
S0058	oh
S0179	whatever
S0058	i know who you mean i can't remember
S0179	well
S0058	i know i know exactly who you mean so er 's friend
S0179	yeah
S0058	okay that's interest so she be in the she be in the yeah
S0058	yeah accurate hmm so she be in the telegraph
S0179	yeah or something like that
S0058	what's her fortune then be she i'm guess not particularly do well
S0179	no no opposite erm
S0058	oh right
S0179	she's hold up as an example of some one who have do well she's do the graduate programme for a lead charity in london
S0058	nice good stuff
S0179	i didn't know charities have graduate program
S0058	hmm
S0179	apparently they do
S0058	do it say which charity
S0179	no
S0058	i apply for a few charity job though in all fairness but they be quite small charities they didn't have erm
S0179	no it's erm it's interest
S0058	right
S0179	erm but she's like i don't know if she write all this herself but it so ridiculous i just wanna slap her
S0058	she probably didn't then she's really nice
S0179	mm erm
S0058	she's a really nice person
S0179	i suspect it's her word from an interview
S0058	mm
S0179	which be break up
S0058	yeah i suspect so
S0179	erm i mean this other guy who get erm he drop out of vet after do the erm bachelor bite so preclinical vet
S0058	yeah
S0179	which be of course a degree
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	it's actually a very unusual degree with a two two
S0058	but so it's a a ba in vet
S0179	mm yeah
S0058	veterinary science be that
S0179	mm yeah yeah apparently he miss a question on his final paper which be worth ten percent of the mark yeah right
S0058	how how you know how many question there be
S0179	well exactly if you're that stupid you haven't do any practice question and you're that stupid then
S0058	ha well it's just you know you find out how many question there be
S0179	yeah or you could blurb
S0058	well anyway what so he hasn't do very well
S0179	mm
S0058	that's not really representative though cos work really hard get really interest in things and probably get a good grade
S0179	mm
S0058	and probably know how many question there be in her exam like i'm not sure it's really fair
S0179	yeah but it be just for contrast between the two and he sound like he's work in a coffee shop in er cardiff or whatever
S0058	i mean i think there's better examples than him like people who genuinely work very hard to get very good degrees and just because of the job market they find it really hard
S0179	that's true that's not true
S0058	i dunno i dunno
S0179	um
S0058	i mean a year ago though
S0179	if you get a two no yeah but she be look very specifically she could have get a civil service job or
S0058	true yeah
S0179	you know an accountancy firm job or
S0058	mm
S0179	there be options she just choose not to take them
S0058	mm
S0179	um
S0058	and it's you know it's work out which be great but yeah i see what you mean
S0179	well in fact she didn't get a very good degree she get a history two one
S0058	yeah but that's the same as my degree
S0179	well no you get extreme top end two one you be
S0058	i think she do pretty well i think she be sixty six or sixty seven and i'm only sixty seven
S0179	yeah but
S0058	it wasn't really extreme top end i be very popular
S0179	yes you be you be three place off a first you say you be
S0058	oh yeah that's true
S0179	you be extreme top end for a two one
S0058	i forget about that that's a nice thing to be remind of ha
S0179	mm i e you er deserve a first but the exam system beat you to it
S0058	hmm mm yeah it do but still
S0179	you'd be in exactly the same position do exactly the same thing
S0058	i would be that's the thing
S0179	but i can't see any of them have take you because if it's experience that's hold you back not academic qualifications
S0058	mm they wouldn't no no yeah i mean why on earth would they have need a first in english like it wouldn't have make any sense there be no yeah the difference be i have didn't have experience that be fair enough and that be a serious deficiency
S0179	mm well
S0058	i also do go mental on applications
S0179	yeah well you know this guy be say he be do five or six a week
S0058	i be probably do five or six a week some weeks probably more some weeks probably less
S0179	but
S0058	and i do that for a while i think i be at it for a couple of months
S0179	well no unfeasibly there's a peak in the job somewhere
S0058	it depend how broadly you look cos i be look quite broadly but not anything like i be just look for any publish
S0179	you you weren't go into graduate scheme
S0058	any no um i be look for any publish any kind of charity any college job like administration job erm any museum
S0179	which in retrospect i think be a mistake
S0058	what a college admin job why
S0179	well i dunno actually no that be say it would have get you er six months experience
S0058	mm yeah that be all i be think i be think if i can do this you know play about with databases and write some letter to people for six months
S0179	unfortunately they probably know that
S0058	yeah in all fairness all the job know that and this be er the job i've get be one of the high level ones i apply for and maybe that be my mistake
S0179	that's possibly why you get it
S0058	yeah i don't know cos they be like well she actually will stay in this job for a little bite whereas i i do wonder if the admin assistant job they be just well blatantly you wanna be in publish not in you know you're not gonna hang around
S0179	yeah obviously and it's gonna then cost them to recruit again
S0058	mm yeah
S0179	it's an interest tip though aim high
S0058	mm
S0179	because if you aim too low you won't get it
S0058	well no that that's something definitely to learn i think but also i didn't wanna rule things out and i i be you know i be get interview which be great and i be apply for quite a range i be apply for some really terrible ones but probably none worse than what verity be look at so
S0179	now that's special you want to work in theatre we want you to bear our children we think this be a fair compromise
S0058	yeah basically mm
S0179	she should have do that
S0058	we want you to aid us in our drug traffic efforts ha we feel this be fair i don't think it be a bad job though that's the thing
S0179	i think it be an appal job
S0058	be it i think she be alright with it it be just a bite bore
S0179	not that just you're you know you're pay the amount that
S0058	mm i don't think any one's pay anything in theatre hmm
S0179	sorry
S0058	i don't think any one's pay anything in theatre though
S0179	actors
S0058	no actors in theatre aren't pay anything either unless you're jude law
S0179	oh god i love that erm so erm yeah we often say islam isn't very nice to you know it's prejudice against women you know they have sharia law sharia law whatever the fuck it be
S0058	true
S0179	yeah we have jude law much the same
S0058	nice where's that from mock the week think so oh nice ha ha he's very cute though and he play bosie so i can't hate him completely although bosie be an arse
S0179	in what
S0058	um wilde
S0179	oh dear lord
S0058	actually it use to be
S0179	didn't bosie have an arse that's why wilde like him
S0058	no he be an arse i suspect that be why wilde like him um yeah well me and
S0179	oscar wilde just sound like an tit
S0058	he be a bite
S0179	and he be
S0058	and he be kind of er special he be different
S0179	yeah but so what you're not no mate you're not special get back in the box
S0058	which box
S0179	i dunno but
S0058	the box ha
S0179	well like and it's not as if he be campaign for gay right or anything
S0058	no he wasn't
S0179	exactly so it's just like
S0058	but what he do do though um
S0179	bugger all no no sorry bugger someone um
S0058	well he be well um what he do do be be stand up and say i refuse to be treat like this when somebody treat him badly which be good
S0179	in what sense
S0058	which lead to example so erm so what happen basically bosie's father lord queensberry as in the queensberry from box um
S0179	that's a straight name if ever there be one
S0058	so lord queensberry erm write um you see oscar wilde have a play on him and and queensberry hat wilde for obvious reason and um send him like a bouquet of kind of rot vegetables with a card say pose sondimite he spell it wrong um and um wilde take objection to this and sue him for slander and um it's he win the case but then he be investigate for um for sodomy and i don't really know er i think er yeah
S0179	how the hell be he be he investigate once he'd win it
S0058	hang on i don't really know maybe he lose it
S0179	possibly friends in the er police force
S0058	there be well yeah there's something yeah basically yeah i can't remember exactly what happen but then he be investigate again in another trial and find guilty and sentence to two years hard labour or whatever um
S0179	didn't he die in prison
S0058	no he's he become very ill in prison and have um cerebral meningitis i believe which be pretty nasty and he didn't live for very long when he come out a few years he go to paris under the name sebastian mark someone i think and he he's um he's tombstone it's like a massive stone monument thing ha not that i really know a lot about oscar wilde or anything ha
S0179	no um but i i never like him purely because he's get that stephen fry complex of
S0058	ha i don't think he's just a
S0058	i think if anything it's an oscar wilde complex i don't think stephen fry be first
S0179	fine either way it's they're both arseholes as in they're both too aware that they have
S0058	be you just associate the two
S0179	they're no i've read at least one of his play he's where the er character be base on him
S0058	mm tenuous tenuous
S0179	not tenuous
S0058	but you ah but if if you oh you say oh cos i've read um i've read hamlet apparently shakespeare play hamlet's father so i'm gonna make about hamlet's character it's a
S0179	no but there's a very distinct very unusual personality in erm
S0058	mm
S0179	oh sorry what's it call
S0058	lady 's lady windermere's
S0179	no
S0058	um importance of be earnest
S0179	yep no
S0058	um a woman of no importance
S0179	that's it
S0058	i don't actually know the play at all
S0179	the lord chap erm
S0058	i don't i don't know it at all
S0179	well he be essentially wide he he's sort of an old er savage person whose wit be er devastate shall we say
S0058	okay mm but do you you know do you know anything about him as a person have you read any biographies or read any of his kind of or kind of look into him a bite more rather than just his his work i mean you can just like his work but i'm not sure that really unless you can really point that to the author
S0179	i possibly have an association with stephen fry
S0058	mm
S0179	base on the fact he play him
S0058	yeah mm that's what i mean you can you can refuse to watch the film wilde but i'm not sure you're gonna necessarily say i dislike oscar wilde for that reason and actually wilde isn't quite as good as me or think he be we watch it
S0179	sorry
S0058	wilde isn't as good as me or think it be we watch it one time with a bottle of wine um last year i think and at the end we be both a bite like yeah it's alright but we all come we both come up with this massive list of reason why it be a bite erm glossy ha and we didn't like it quite as much as we do when we be eighteen
S0179	you watch it when you be eighteen
S0058	yeah i be a massive oscar wilde fan
S0179	of course you be tragically misunderstand
S0058	not particularly i just though oscar wilde be cool ha ha we didn't do oscar wilde
S0179	i didn't say that be cause and effect i just say there be a oh i must've imply that
S0058	mm
S0179	i dunno i i just have an intense dislike for stephen fry
S0058	i know that's what i'm say and that's fine but don't let that spill over into other people who have nothing to do with him stephen fry have a lot to do with oscar wilde oscar wilde have nothing to do with stephen fry ha necessarily
S0179	i'm not entirely sure that that follow
S0058	a modern understand of oscar wilde if you try and explain oscar wilde to a thirteen year old you'd probably say oh he's a bite like stephen fry but that doesn't mean
S0179	that's probably a fairly accurate assessment
S0058	mm anyway i just think he's a really interest character now and you know less slightly less obsess with him but i just think he's a really fascinate person
S0179	i'm not sure i agree
S0058	not not a particularly
S0179	i think there's far more fascinate people
S0058	oh i'm sure there be but i
S0179	and from the same era um kitchener er churchill um
S0058	it's a bite later
S0179	a con doyle there's a fascinate character if you like
S0058	mm i'd love to know more about him
S0179	you see again right watch the film that er mum give me for christmas the modern adaptation of his early life
S0058	
S0179	it be sherlock holmes and the mysterious case of conan doyle
S0058	oh do she oh that doesn't the christmas this year
S0179	remember she get that box set no last year
S0058	yeah oh yeah last year i i be yeah i saw them again that box set do it have a
S0179	yeah it's a sort of semi autobiographic
S0058	mm
S0179	well biographical
S0058	oh
S0179	well it be semi auto as in it's but i'd strongly suggest watch that um it be fascinate but there be a complex character
S0058	be he
S0179	wilde isn't very complex
S0058	be
S0179	he er at the time he be different nowadays he's not er he be just unfortunate
S0058	well exactly trivialism
S0179	i don't think unfortunate and interest be the same thing
S0058	why unfortunate
S0179	sorry
S0058	i never hear why unfortunate i've never quite hear that word use
S0179	well as in he be
S0179	probably gay he be imprison on that account
S0058	oh okay yeah
S0179	and then die possibly as a result
S0058	yeah
S0179	that's not a fortunate story
S0058	whatever
S0179	but beyond the fact that he be slightly unfortunate he's not very interest
S0058	i disagree
S0179	this gay man who write some play
S0058	i find him interest
S0179	whereas look into conan doyle's stories they're far more involve
S0058	mm no i'm i'm i'm not disagree that that's interest
S0179	so we're talk a man whose father be in a mental institution
S0058	interest
S0179	er in edinburgh
S0058	yes
S0179	a man who have a a a medical doctor who have a very interest relationship with his mentor
S0058	mm
S0179	cos of course er er doyle be watson
S0058	mm right
S0179	that's the point
S0058	well that's interest not sherlock
S0179	you didn't know that
S0058	no i don't know much about it
S0179	no he study under professor bell who pioneer forensic science at edinburgh university
S0058	mm i know that i know that from the reichenbach fall ha which you need to watch it's amaze you'd really enjoy it i'll try and find it on dvd
S0179	what be it
S0058	reichenbach fall it be this thing that be on bbc4 a few years ago and me and mainly watch it initially because archie from monarch of the glen be in it but it's really good
S0179	it's not moriarty be it
S0058	no um so it's not really about that it's about this modern day writer in edinburgh um and there's he write these crime novels basically and but then it all start get a little bite twist with conan doyle and sherlock holmes and it all get a little bite yeah knot up basically
S0179	right
S0058	it's really good your ha i say that like famous have you if you've see it a few time um what be i say um conan doyle dad
S0179	move on please god
S0058	his dad be in edinburgh mental institution
S0179	yes
S0058	so conan doyle be watson
S0179	and he he's marry but he begin an affair
S0058	conan doyle do
S0179	yes er sort of inadvertently but there's it's not his
S0058	with this marriage
S0179	not exactly no
S0058	sort of thing no
S0179	but plutonic marriage and he start an affair his wife then develop a terminal illness
S0058	mm
S0179	and he support her very faithfully through that while also see his mistress who he then marry after his wife's death
S0058	mm
S0179	but he never let his wife down or abandon her at all
S0058	do the wife know about the mistress
S0179	i don't know
S0058	and mm interest
S0179	as in i can't remember
S0058	alright fair enough unknown by you but not necessarily unknown by history no that's cool that's cool
S0179	yep erm but if you want a fascinate author
S0058	mm
S0058	yes thank you
S0179	please thank you er look no further
S0058	mm so so be be he an ugly man well if he no cocaine be he a cocaine addict or be he
S0179	no opium you don't inject cocaine
S0058	be it opium he take i don't think it
S0179	yes
S0058	it's not it's not
S0179	it be
S0058	it's not opium
S0179	it's er it be
S0058	okay um anyway he be he an opium addict or be this entirely sort of imaginary
S0179	no it's in the book
S0058	no no i know it's in the book but do be it conan doyle's personal experience of say drug
S0179	i have no idea
S0058	cos i find that interest about sherlock holmes
S0179	why
S0058	because the idea that now er it it's a very modern conception of drug that they narrow the mind and make you stupid and ruin you whereas there's this
S0179	no some drug do
S0058	well er i think they try and kind of get across the message that hey kid drug be bad drug will do bad things to you
S0179	no no but no but er cannabis screw
S0058	mm
S0179	other drug don't in some way they have other very unfortunate side effect
S0058	mm
S0179	but they don't i mean opium be er heroin be his point be that it give him it enable him to think clearer
S0058	yeah well i just find it fascinate that there's there be actually a line of sort of er yeah creative people who mm particularly er i mean i'm think about musicians in particular
S0179	yeah
S0058	so the beetle wouldn't have write a lot of their crazy music without acid
S0179	acid
S0058	acid acid
S0179	that's not a drug you want to be more specific
S0058	i don't know whatever acid be in chemical term it's the bill bailey talk about when he's like the leg on the line of the chair make it end make it end make it end
S0179	what
S0058	there's a bill bailey sketch where he's he's say you know if someone want to describe something as be really kind of quirky and different and amaze and modern they're like you you know it's like so and so on acid so it's like it's like terry and june on acid
S0179	see the woman behind you
S0058	mm
S0179	look at the hair colour look at the blouse do that remind you of your mum
S0058	okay mm ah so um really badly
S0179	that's weird
S0058	so he's talk about um yeah so and so on acid you know it it's like um it's like monty python on acid you know but then he's like actually you know it's ridiculous be on acid be really bore you get a plate you know a decorate plate with flower on and you spend hours just be like and then you know you'd be look at someone who'd be sit down on a chair with their legs cross and you'd be like the leg of the chair with the leg make it end make it end make it end make it end for an hour and a half
S0179	well it's not bore clearly you're not bore
S0058	fair enough yeah ha ha i'm just make the point that you know be like so and so on acid isn't necessarily a particularly good thing but um yeah um so the beetle be kind of take drug and write this amaze weird psychedelic music and you kind of think well obviously they're really bad and they destroy you but
S0179	when do they break up as a band
S0058	er late late sixties i can possibly oh this be really bad be it either late sixties or early seventies erm lennon be shoot in eighty one i believe eighty or eighty one and he'd have a few years of solo stuff since the beetle erm
S0179	who shoot him
S0058	a guy call mark oh er this be a really good trivia thing basically he'd become obsess with lennon um he be er derange basically he become obsess with lennon and decide that he have to shoot him but he also be also obsess with david bowie you know the ziggy stardust grind control to
S0179	oh yeah
S0058	yeah he be also obsess with him and he circle he'd be to see david bowie in a play and circle his name in the programme and be weird about him as well um
S0058	ooh
S0058	um possibly what do you reckon
S0179	okay um could we possible try er this one
S0179	yes please
S0179	yes indeed
S0058	yeah it sound great um do you wanna just get the ordinary one or get the big bottle i'm not particularly fuss actually but i want some wine
S0179	let's maybe wander after this
S0058	pardon
S0179	we can maybe wander into a bar or something afterwards
S0058	yeah that sound good seb hasn't get back to me
S0179	ring him
S0058	i'll ring him when we've finish i don't know what he's do tonight he might be in rehearsal in all fairness ah no last er last thursday be he in rehearsal
S0179	tuesday
S0058	tuesday oh play his violin like sherlock holmes
S0058	i like that i love the bite in the erm in the modern one when he he discover that play um kind of random note
S0179	actually i think the rest of it might be mine if that's okay
S0058	i've have probably more than you
S0179	yes
S0058	and i love it
S0179	yes you've have another glass
S0058	i love it when he discover in the modern film that play random note if this randomly but then when he play a erm chromatic scale they they switch fly circle i think that's er funny
S0058	yeah i just think that's a really clever funny way into the character personally
S0179	we should watch those again they're good
S0058	they be good when you say those we've only get the first one and the
S0179	we've get six
S0058	oh oh sorry no the bite with the violin the um the chromatic scale be in the film the robert downey junior film
S0179	make one of those
S0179	okay sure
S0058	he's not that weird actually no he's quite weird ha i love the bite when um mrs um what's her name the landlady when she open the fridge and there's a head in there she's like sherlock
S0058	it's so good
S0179	but the final one be very clever the er
S0058	oh
S0179	media manipulation i think be exceptional
S0058	oh it be so good i really enjoy all of them they be so well make and i think um the benedict cumberbatch and um martin freeman be really well cast i think they play it really well i just enjoy those so much oh so they've set up a second series
S0179	third series
S0058	yeah well cos of course everyone know that the sixth episode be gonna be call the reichenbach fall so
S0179	yeah
S0058	so everyone be a bite like be they actually gonna end it you know be they gonna do that cool thing and like not carry on not have too much of a good thing you know
S0179	that's not ooh stargate universe
S0058	but that wasn't stop sort of
S0179	that have go downhill
S0058	yeah that wasn't stop cos of have too much of a good thing that be stop because it be a bite rubbish
S0179	i don't know who what writers be do
S0058	the writers probably know they weren't gonna be pay after the end of it so decide just to screw it over
S0179	yeah
S0058	they probably stop put any effort in what so ever i don't know i i
S0179	cos the first series be it be
S0058	it be the first series be so good but in all fairness though how long could it go on have say that go on a long time and that be a similar kind of idea stick it in the middle of space
S0179	that be very different that be very much a this be a cosy stick in the middle of space where and that be
S0058	yeah no i i think that's why the first bite of universe be so good but then once they'd get cosy it be like well this be just voyager
S0179	and again it have run into a series of space battle and it be like
S0058	yeah it be like well this isn't very interest whereas yeah the first one there be alien it be just we have no water
S0179	no there be alien briefly
S0058	the blue ones
S0179	so yeah the blue ones
S0058	yeah the they be a bite weird though because they they didn't really do they you know it wasn't a battle it be just a traditional alien thing it be just a really weird mind thing ha
S0179	yes and that bite with the er the god planet be weird
S0058	the god oh the god oh yeah oh and then they all come back to the
S0179	yeah
S0058	ship oh that be weird
S0179	that be fuck weird
S0058	mm not in a particularly nice way just in a slightly depress upset way
S0179	that be kind of the point but it but it make a very interest theological point
S0058	mm
S0179	in that um you can believe in a higher power and they do and there be a higher power on that planet a lot of good it do them
S0058	i just think it's interest how stargate's really interest in this theology thing
S0179	well no it's and i i i defy anyone to watch all ten series of stargate sg 1 well stop
S0179	but i defy anyone to erm to watch that and then not be able to question the the belief in a in a well
S0058	it would certainly make you think about what why
S0179	well not not to be able to question the catch twenty two in the belief of a god
S0058	yeah
S0179	what be a god except a more powerful be more knowledgeable be
S0058	yeah
S0179	in in which case that's not you know that make us a god to a pig and but er the only thing that one should be able to worship or revere be supreme moral worth
S0058	yeah exactly that's the difference in stargate
S0179	but in that case why would a be of supreme moral worth want us to worship them
S0058	yeah
S0179	er er er because ultimately there that's very self serve and they certainly could would not and could not punish you for not worship them cos that would
S0058	yeah that would go against the idea that they be worthy of worship in the first place
S0179	indeed and therefore defy the point of it's a very simple
S0058	it be a catch twenty two i agree
S0179	yeah and
S0058	it's really interest
S0179	well it amaze me how many very intelligent people don't understand that anyway
S0058	but yeah anyway no er er i agree like universe be great but then it kind of go a bite i think that's the thing though we be watch the second series and we be both a bite like oh this be really disappoint but it's better than it be amaze till the end and then know it wasn't gonna finish at least this way we be like well it's never gonna end but it be also a bite rubbish ha
S0179	yes
S0058	it felt a little bite
S0179	i mean unfortunately that mean that stargate have fizzle out it didn't go out on a bang
S0058	cos
S0179	it just fizzle out
S0058	yeah it it do fizzle out with which be such a shame cos the first series be so good it could have be better than all of them you know
S0179	well no cos er they know sg 1 be gonna stop at some point between the seventh and tenth series cos it
S0058	what because it richard dean anderson have leave do you mean or just because
S0179	sort of but also because most sci fi series be only ever run for seven series
S0058	oh right
S0179	um none of the star trek
S0058	with borrow time
S0179	all of the star trek stop after seven season
S0058	that's interest why just because that be enough ha
S0179	arguably yeah erm seven years be a long time
S0058	it's a long time yeah i agree yeah
S0179	but erm so at the end of season seven stargate sg 1 have a huge high budget finale episode
S0058	right
S0179	that could very easily be the end and then they come back
S0058	should it have be the end do you think i don't know if i've see enough of the later ones be it when do richard dean anderson leave
S0179	complicate
S0058	thank you ah so dinky
S0179	i feel that this may be over price
S0058	somewhat never mind
S0179	shotgun chocolate
S0058	yeah
S0179	thank you
S0058	lovely
S0058	thank you very much
S0179	erm so yeah
S0058	i'll just turn it round
S0179	oh
S0058	turn it that way and then you can get the chocolate and i can get the nut yeah so what when do richard dean anderson
S0179	um well it's complicate
S0058	ha ha well he's never really leave
S0179	he stop be the leader of sg 1 after season seven
S0058	right
S0179	he come back as the leader of the sg c for the season eight hammond move on
S0058	so be that kind of a a pretty big part then
S0179	mm no um
S0058	not quite as big as sg 1 but
S0179	and the idea be that he be spend more time with his family he want to cut it down a bite
S0058	right the actor yeah
S0179	mm
S0058	so presumably he could rock up do a lot of his things in a shorter time period
S0179	mm
S0058	less location film i guess
S0179	oh almost none
S0058	yeah more yeah so one afternoon or you know him and the rest of the cast on the base
S0179	mm
S0058	yeah
S0179	um
S0058	okay
S0179	but hang on he be still exec producer
S0058	oh right
S0179	i think
S0058	he be still quite involve then
S0179	yeah
S0058	how be that executive producer isn't the same as producer a producer kind of guide the direction and the feel of the piece you know they can be quite woollily involve
S0179	yeah but he do that for the entire series that's why stargate be so much his
S0058	from the begin
S0179	yeah
S0058	oh right i didn't realise that
S0179	oh
S0179	that's one of the nice things about it it be his series it just the quirky humour the
S0058	mm
S0179	you know it have serious moral issue but it be also funny in a way that star trek never be
S0058	star trek's never funny actually no the doctor can be entertain but not funny in the same way i think he's a really nice character cos a lot of the others be quite worthy and quite kind of heavy whereas the doctor never feel like that but i suppose
S0179	a lot of the comedy come yeah it's entertain but not funny
S0058	mm i know that
S0179	none of star trek be funny whereas sg 1 be and it all come from jack
S0058	mm and his interactions with other people but yeah from his kind of one line i dunno i kind of felt like later on that game like labour though personally i felt that some of the wise crack weren't very natural
S0179	no
S0058	and it felt quite labour well to me anyway
S0179	no i disagree erm oh no it depend which series you're talk about but you haven't see anything like half of it
S0058	no no i haven't um just it just felt to me like yeah like kind of
S0179	that be nice hugely over charge
S0058	ha
S0179	shall we take the bill
S0058	yeah ooh i need to get my thing out
S0179	yes yes you do
S0058	oh i'll finish this first mm it be yeah tasty if slightly old never mind
S0179	do you have that cash leave
S0058	i haven't spend it no
S0179	i might need it for tomorrow we're have lunch in the pub
S0058	have fun
S0179	's last day
S0058	yes that'll be nice that's the day before her maternity leave
S0179	yeah
S0058	do she know how long she's gonna be off
S0179	either a couple of months ten months or permanently
S0058	right
S0179	i assume you have to say when you be come back apparently not seriously maternity rule like maternity laws be ridiculous cos you're not allow by law to give away the person's desk if they don't want you to you have to reserve their desk as a testament
S0058	no but you surely you have to replace them
S0179	no that's the point you're not allow to replace them cos they be normally come back
S0058	no i mean replace them as in maternity cover you have to cover them at cup they always get cover
S0179	i don't know but
S0058	so yeah you take either so to a different job or someone would be employ specifically for you're employ to cover this person's maternity leave when they come back you're out
S0179	see i still don't think it's reasonable that you have that kind of i mean maternity leave be pay as well isn't it
S0058	mm it depend how long you're on it for erm if once you get past a certain month that it get pay a very small percentage i think it's not you're not in in you're kind of on
S0179	yeah but for a few months it's pay
S0058	yeah
S0179	yeah it's ridiculous
S0058	well
S0179	i'm sorry but why shouldn't
S0058	no but in all fairness though dad's can have fully pay paternity leave
S0179	not for anything like the same amount of time it's fractional at best
S0058	i think you should be able to argue one parent have yeah fully pay long term maternity leave one parent doesn't and you decide like it doesn't really work if you've get two parent sorry well if you've only get one parent i'm say or if you've get three parent on the same or four parent it might not work because it's not quite as straight forward as two you know mother father baby ha
S0179	yeah well in ninety five percent of case it would
S0058	like well how what happen if there's a couple so like erm baby and friends
S0179	yeah
S0058	who get the maternity slash paternity leave out of those three you know how do that work if one person can have it to look after the baby but one person have just give birth if you have er you know
S0179	well by that logic you should be able to have it for adoption
S0058	you can yeah you can get maternity for adoption
S0179	really
S0058	yeah
S0179	mm
S0058	exactly because
S0179	remind me never to employ a woman oh fuck do you see what cameron do today it's international woman's day
S0058	cameron
S0179	yeah david cameron
S0058	oh no ha that's quite bad i didn't know who you mean i think you mean 's boyfriend i be gonna say how do you know what cameron do today
S0179	so you know it's international woman's day
S0058	erm yes
S0179	sorry let me just murder a prostitute and move on erm
S0058	mm
S0179	i'm sorry how ridiculously offensive be that
S0058	i only know about that cos of the google logo
S0179	well indeed but okay i haven't see that
S0179	but honestly i didn't know what it be but er
S0058	i just i hover my mouse over it while i be type something in
S0179	no i be look i be too eager to get to the forum
S0179	but er there's irony for you
S0058	ha yeah nice
S0179	er but you know so he's now make stalk a criminal offence specifically stalk er
S0058	that seem reasonable cos stalk be kind of scary
S0179	no but it yeah but it's like so there's be four case over the last six years of stalkers commit murder and that's actually not a lot if you look at the total murder rat
S0058	no but stalk be
S0179	and no no but just but it's already in effect as in er i think you can be possibly
S0058	mm
S0179	specifically what this do be enable the police to enter a property without a warrant on suspicion of stalk well why what possible good be that go to do
S0058	mm
S0179	that's just gonna er but that's just gonna abate a woman say i don't like this man i'm gonna say he's stalk me and let's get the police to arrest him for a while the defendant have right unless you've be charge you cannot unless a warrant have be apply for you cannot do that you should
S0058	hang on i don't really understand how come this crime be any different form the crime of intimidation or whatever bad behaviour
S0179	well they be just make it more slightly more they're just give the police more power to deal with it
S0058	right
S0179	it's like oh the police have enough power to deal with it and should just bloody do it i don't understand if someone be stalk someone how do it get er how do er enter their house help you
S0058	mm yeah um it's not this kind of
S0179	the crime isn't happen there
S0058	yeah that's um what i'm wonder it isn't it doesn't seem logical cos for other crimes it make sense to be able to
S0179	yes
S0058	to say confiscate
S0179	drug traffic prostitution
S0058	yeah to so to confiscate the property you know to confiscate their laptop it make sense cos it serve the crimes i think but that just seem a bite odd surely the right to follow them um while their follow say woman have say that i mean er i guess you could have e stalk they could be constantly send them message which would involve yeah confiscate a laptop or computer
S0179	well no it wouldn't it would just involve contact the site administrators
S0058	mm
S0179	and get access to their account
S0058	yeah true
S0179	erm i find it
S0058	well it it's like the last episode of morse though where he go into a house and he's get all the sorry have you see the last episode of morse
S0058	yeah
S0179	when morse die
S0058	yeah
S0179	yeah i saw that
S0058	cos of all the picture
S0179	of who
S0058	morse
S0179	didn't know that but he die of a heart attack
S0058	well yeah so i haven't actually properly um this be the only this be the only bite of the only episode i've ever see so the bite he go into this woman's house and she er like on some part of the case but then she's get like load of picture of him and some about his case and like she's be photograph him and it's all over her like her live room wall so i guess if it be that kind of level
S0179	well yeah but morse die of a heart attack
S0058	yeah but i can't she doesn't kill him
S0179	i know
S0058	do he die of a heart attack in
S0179	could we have the bill please
S0058	and um can i give you that thank you
S0179	that er
S0058	thank you
S0179	catch fire
S0058	i didn't actually notice that that's not bad cos wasn't there do he have the heart attack at the shop it be see all the picture of himself
S0179	no
S0058	oh
S0179	he be just quite ill cos he be not in very good health
S0058	mm
S0179	to be honest i'd like to watch some classic morse it's good
S0058	i've never see them er it's funny though if you're in oxford they've get load of morse stuff load of morse tour you can do and stuff they really market it which seem odd
S0179	he go to the crook chimney with be a pub on the way to hatfield
S0058	yeah yeah oh that's cool
S0179	yeah want to go there at some point it's like fine you're drive back

S0179	we've be past that many time
S0058	ha yeah fair enough um if it's really horrible though it will be like every time you drive past you'd be like oh disgust meal
