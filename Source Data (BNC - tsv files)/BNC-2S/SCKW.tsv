S0324	well just don't let anyone else see it be that why you're worry cos someone else use it
S0325	no because i feel like i'll leave it somewhere and it'll get squish
S0324	so yeah you just need to make sure that no one use your acrylics
S0325	maybe ill try and find i do have some cheap ones i get from as a birthday present
S0324	what acrylics
S0325	hmm from like the work or something but i get some other ones cos i didn't like those that much but they they should be aright on paint wood i can use them up
S0324	yeah i'm just go to bring in i'm just go to paint mine white so i'm go to bring in some tiger acrylic
S0325	i'm go to paint one of those i'm go to be ambitious paint it
S0324	what colour
S0325	blue
S0324	blue to light blue
S0325	and my plastic's blue and stuff i come over my design fault you know what be go to happen i make a circle out of plastic
S0324	what so you've already stick the thing on and then you're go to paint it
S0325	yeah
S0324	okay but you're not go to paint the plastic
S0325	no
S0324	so sort of paint around the plastic
S0325	yeah
S0324	and paint on the same colour
S0325	have lot of fun with that the wood isn't all out of the plastic it's like a fan outside it but i've make it a circle out of plastic and then i make four triangles out of the wood and i be plan to stick them on the plastic and have the clock mechanism come up out of the bottom then i realise that the hand of the clock won't go over the wood
S0324	oh yeah
S0325	and so
S0324	that's a problem i have so i need to move
S0325	so i think what i be go to have to do be sand down the wood until it's like paper thin and stick it but then i think it's gonna
S0324	yeah
S0325	so what i decide to do be chop off basically all of my wood half of my wood and stick it at the back instead it's look okay now but once mr put it in a box they're all go to snap off yeah
