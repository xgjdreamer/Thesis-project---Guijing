S0320	and then go down to peru and
S0322	and how far be that
S0320	i think she's fly out of chile actually i'm not really sure how far be what
S0322	machu picchu
S0320	from ecuador it's a twenty four hour bus ride to
S0322	oh okay that's quite far
S0320	er lima i think let's have a look why don't you google it erm yeah i remember it be a twenty four hour bus ride to i think it's lima and then it's not even in lima machu there we go
S0322	it be there
S0320	yeah machu picchu in ecuador er machu picchu in peru that's more like it
S0322	oh actually that look quite far
S0320	where be it
S0322	where be it
S0320	oh they don't know where it be
S0322	don't be silly oh they can't give directions
S0320	well let's well cusco be normally the nearest place that you go to there we go four oh four hours
S0322	couscous
S0320	couscous cusco
S0322	well fly it's flip heck that's like fly from here to africa north africa
S0320	yeah it's thirty four hours
S0322	that's quite far
S0320	it be quite far so she's gonna go from so she's get two weeks i think in ecuador
S0322	mm
S0320	so anyway we're go to for her birthday she use to go to all the time
S0322	oh
S0320	so we're go to for her birthday the first weekend we arrive and then erm we're probably gonna go to the beach we're gonna go to another beach actually let me see if we can find it it's call let's see if it's on here to ah in be not that far from yeah look it's only
S0322	oh okay
S0320	nearly two hours
S0322	so that be
S0320	further up
S0322	it's up there isn't it
S0320	and it get the coastline get as you can see look it get sort of quieter and less populate and much prettier the further up you go
S0322	mm
S0320	to about here this be a national park
S0322	mm
S0320	and it's just yeah look you can see the picture
S0322	oh that's better
S0320	but it's also sometimes spell with an x instead of js
S0322	oh
S0320	because it's
S0322	and then i think it would be like
S0320	erm andean it's an andean language
S0322	oh
S0320	it's not a place you wanna go anyway actually whether you can pronounce it or not
S0322	oh that's a shame
S0320	and then after that so we're gonna go to er for 's birthday for the weekend which be gonna be entertain with i don't quite know how it's gonna work and then the week after that we're go down to mm
S0322	oh
S0320	down here which be where 's family come from
S0322	mm
S0320	so we're gonna go and visit all of his cousins and his grandparents and his grandparents live on a farm
S0322	oh
S0320	yeah and yeah so yeah
S0322	so how long about a week in
S0320	er erm
S0322	so you've get
S0320	a few days in erm so about a week in and and then we'll probably go to the beach for a bite while
S0322	mm
S0320	's here so 's book on to machu picchu for a specific time cos it close in march
S0322	mm
S0320	or close in february
S0322	mm
S0320	so she have to go on like the sixteenth of january or something so i think probably what we'll do be just hang around the beach
S0322	mm
S0320	and 's mum be rent a an apartment in actually
S0322	mm
S0320	so we can go there and should all be quite easy and we'll go sort of and then back to for a few days i think and then go down to to see 's family and i think we're gonna go via over here no no new picture
S0322	how be you gonna go
S0320	erm well be suppose to have pass his drive test in which case he would have drive but he hasn't pass it and there be no test until january erm so i don't know we'll probably have to hire a taxi i think because i'm not drive
S0322	mm
S0320	there's an i didn't drive the whole time i live there there's no way i want to drive across
S0322	mm
S0320	the andes on my own with
S0322	mm
S0320	in the car in a foreign country have never drive on the other side of the road before so i well i go with my parent we they we go from erm quito to which be sort of which be here
S0322	mm
S0320	erm which be probably a few hours and i remember it not be extortionately expensive but that be quite a long time ago so there's quito
S0322	mm
S0320	so there to sort of down here i think that's the only way and i think stop overnight in cuenca because otherwise it's er like eight hours in the car and there's absolutely no way can handle that
S0322	mm
S0320	erm
S0322	mm well that's
S0320	so yeah we'll see i don't know that's the big question how we're gonna get anywhere
S0322	yeah
S0320	so we'll see anyway tell me about italy so when be you go
S0322	ah mm erm april
S0320	let me find a map
S0322	i dunno i think i think easter be quite near the begin of april
S0320	oh i look this up the other day erm fourth of april maybe
S0322	mm i think it's fairly early in april
S0320	oh it's around it's around 's birthday his birthday
S0322	his birthday right
S0320	often fall on good friday he hat it
S0320	okay so you're go begin of april be you go to go for easter
S0322	no no no i'm not i'm go end of april
S0320	oh good time so nearly may
S0322	cos it's three yeah
S0322	i'm think i might start cos my birthday's right at the end twenty seventh
S0320	of
S0322	april
S0320	of course yes
S0322	so i might
S0320	so around
S0322	do it more
S0320	yeah
S0322	begin then
S0320	yeah
S0322	and then have the time afterwards
S0320	maybe
S0322	i don't know cos i'm try to work out
S0320	be you gonna have you're gonna have a celebration here as well aren't you either before or after
S0322	yeah
S0320	yeah
S0322	yeah but basically i've kind of say to people the first dilemma be when i be say i really wanna go to venice you know and if by the time i'm forty if i haven't be i'm i'm gonna go because
S0320	yeah
S0322	you know i really wanna go erm and to florence
S0322	i really wanna go to florence
S0320	oh i've be to florence 's from florence
S0322	so yeah so i be yeah so i be talk about those things and my mum say oh i've never be to venice
S0322	she's half italian and my mum's from rome
S0320	oh
S0322	and she be like i've never be to venice
S0320	okay
S0322	or florence i'd love to go and i'm think part of me i love go away on my own
S0320	yeah
S0322	but at the same time she's not gonna be around forever
S0320	yeah
S0322	she's sixty one she's never be to venice and florence and these place
S0320	no
S0322	she's not gonna go on her own
S0320	yeah that's true
S0322	so i think you know plus it's like my birthday
S0320	yeah
S0322	so though i actually want to be away on my own on my birthday
S0320	yeah i'm gonna go for no
S0322	so that's what i've come to like
S0320	okay
S0322	it it would seem quite churlish and actually like i get on fine with my mum we on holiday
S0320	you've be on holiday a couple of time haven't you yeah
S0322	yeah it's you know we we do like it's nice to have somebody to go to restaurants cos i would never go to a restaurant on my own
S0320	oh yeah that's true
S0322	when i go away i you know it's not it's just not there's different things
S0320	yeah
S0322	that so
S0320	oh
S0322	i'm probably gonna end up spend most of the holiday
S0320	oh do you think she'll
S0322	we
S0320	come for the whole time
S0322	well i would have prefer not but it's
S0320	so
S0322	quite tricky cos i
S0320	i be gonna say
S0322	as i say
S0320	be nice to have a compromise wouldn't it
S0322	i've kind of say cos i wanna go to the and do some decent walk
S0320	you wanna go where
S0322	the
S0320	where's that
S0322	okay so basically it start off where i want to go last year if you
S0320	mm
S0322	see it a bite closer
S0320	shall i go
S0322	and look for okay florence pisa
S0320	yeah okay
S0322	this part here if you zoom in a bite
S0320	yeah
S0322	between pisa
S0320	yeah
S0322	and er no start at actually i think
S0320	mm
S0322	this coast here
S0320	mm
S0322	it's basically it's really similar to the coast it's
S0320	oh
S0322	it's five towns about five it's call the
S0320	okay
S0322	so it's exactly
S0320	oh
S0322	five towns which be really pretty and that that's
S0320	really
S0322	no that's not it
S0322	look
S0320	that's
S0322	yeah
S0322	no that's not how
S0320	look nice behind though
S0322	exactly erm but if you go further up
S0320	mm
S0322	not there
S0320	that look quite nice
S0322	now you have to look for the name of some of the
S0320	anyway but yeah what be
S0322	this be
S0320	not
S0322	no not around here so you've get
S0320	ah
S0322	mm that place
S0320	oh wow
S0322	okay so it's very much
S0322	like the coast it's all sort of
S0320	oh my god that look absolutely stun
S0322	you know hang off
S0320	wow
S0322	and you basically can walk between them along the top here
S0320	really
S0322	so it's really nice hike
S0320	oh
S0322	oh god this be weird what's this
S0320	it's a photo tour
S0322	it look really strange
S0320	oh look kayak
S0322	oh you can kayak there
S0320	would want to go there
S0322	so it's very very pretty very italian
S0320	oh that it look beautiful
S0322	and lot of walk
S0320	oh my gosh
S0322	so you could actually like check in at one place
S0322	and then walk onto the next
S0320	oh cool a bite like
S0322	and do it like that
S0320	the southwest coast path but much better and hotter
S0322	yeah
S0322	so that
S0320	wow
S0322	i want to do on my own
S0320	oh yeah
S0322	cos i love that
S0320	yeah
S0322	i feel like i can explore when i go off hike on my own
S0320	oh wow be you go to take a
S0322	but i'm try to work out whether to do that at the begin or the end
S0320	be you go to take a gps
S0322	no
S0320	now hike on your own really
S0322	you can't get lose it it's by the coast you can't get lose
S0322	and you always find the sea
S0320	you can fall off the cliff
S0322	and gps isn't gonna help you if you fall off a cliff oh for other people to find you you mean
S0320	that's what i mean
S0322	maybe
S0320	yeah
S0322	maybe
S0320	wow only just look at that gosh it's just
S0322	so then
S0320	stun
S0322	yeah and they're all kind of like this there's a series of
S0320	wow
S0322	i can't remember what the other one be call but
S0320	oh it look absolutely beautiful
S0322	yeah
S0320	so
S0322	and when i be in
S0320	so be you gonna go
S0322	so many people be say this be really lovely but you really have to go to as well
S0320	so it's five
S0322	this be off the
S0320	oh it's a national park
S0322	yeah
S0320	so
S0322	so that part i definitely wanna do on my own
S0320	be you plan to er walk between each of the five towns
S0322	i don't it's not that far it's er i i check out cos it's very expensive
S0320	yeah
S0322	to stay here as well
S0320	okay
S0322	you can stay in somewhere like
S0320	yeah
S0322	and it's about half an hour by train
S0320	oh okay
S0322	to get to the first
S0320	okay
S0322	so probably i'd stay somewhere else and then just every day go in
S0320	oh that seem like a good idea yeah
S0322	and do out of a walk
S0320	oh it look absolutely beautiful
S0322	erm cos it it's nice the idea of work your way down
S0320	yeah it be a lot and it's a lot like this
S0322	but oh look while
S0320	a lot like the erm
S0320	southwest coast coast path oh wow
S0322	yeah it
S0322	it do look really nice
S0320	look absolutely beautiful
S0322	yeah
S0320	oh my gosh look at that oh look do you walk along this be a road
S0322	that's a
S0322	this be what the coast be like be the road be just go around like this
S0320	oh my god that look
S0322	it's it's brilliant fun
S0320	that oh my god
S0322	but it make you feel a bite sick
S0320	yeah big time
S0322	bus just go you know
S0320	oh god
S0322	bomb round
S0320	look worse that actually
S0322	so that
S0320	okay
S0322	i'd like to do on my own
S0320	yes
S0322	and i be think
S0320	yeah cos that's not really a mum sort of thing be it
S0322	and i kind of say to my mum look i wanna do this this this you know come you can come along for
S0320	mm
S0322	some of it
S0320	just this yeah
S0322	and then she keep say well i'd like to do pretty much all of it really except he walk bite i mean i really wanna go to florence and i really wanna go to and i'm like well mm
S0320	well it's not the end of the world
S0322	no
S0320	so it's not
S0322	exactly it's it's i've get load of time to have holiday on my own
S0320	she probably won't be able to do the walk bite in the end anyway
S0322	no she doesn't want to do the walk bite
S0320	no exactly
S0322	no
S0320	but you could just you know
S0322	shall i do
S0320	she could just
S0322	do that first
S0320	go and have a wander round the towns
S0322	and then meet her
S0320	yeah
S0322	well no er this be as in she would go home and i'd stay for
S0320	ah okay
S0322	like i'd have a week to myself
S0320	yeah oh that look brilliant
S0322	so that's fine
S0320	so what's the plan
S0322	so i'm try to work out whether to do that first cos i'm think if i do load of walk then i'll feel good about load of eat and drink afterwards
S0320	that's very true yeah
S0322	i mean the other way round i think i'll just feel really like
S0320	yeah
S0322	by the time
S0320	i agree i think
S0322	so
S0320	that's as good a reason as any to do it first
S0322	cos originally i be think i'd start in venice but i think i'll work backwards
S0320	mm
S0322	so it's
S0320	yeah so where be you gonna fly to
S0322	and then
S0320	pisa
S0322	well pisa yeah
S0320	yeah easyjet
S0322	though it's very good fly to venice as well actually
S0320	yeah
S0322	so maybe fly out from
S0320	yeah maybe fly in to pisa and out from venice
S0322	so probably then meet my mum in florence
S0320	yeah
S0322	so do that walk and stuff
S0320	yeah amaze
S0322	florence
S0320	yeah
S0322	then erm lake er what be it
S0320	oh cool
S0322	because
S0320	yeah
S0322	erm and i think i might actually spend my birthday there rather than in venice
S0320	oh
S0322	because there's a lovely park by the lake with big erm there's a cable car next to the lake
S0320	be there
S0322	so you can go up to the top of the mountain and then paragliding off the top of it
S0320	oh awesome for your birthday

S0320	i think it's a
S0322	paraglide off a mountain
S0320	great thing to do for your fortieth so
S0322	definitely
