S0454	so what do you think about that audio record from peter kinderman
S0453	erm you mean the one talk about erm the factor contribute to mental health and mental wellbeing and whether it's nature or nurture
S0454	yeah exactly
S0453	i mean you know he he spend a long time tell us what we already know which be that
S0454	yeah
S0453	it's a combination of the two
S0454	it's kind of i mean that one's an introduction to his new book so i suppose it's a kind of obvious place to start that you sort of state the bleed obvious erm and look at the historical context and then say there be some problems with it
S0453	plant yeah
S0454	that you can't really say it's nature and you can't really say it's nurture it's a bite of both
S0453	mm
S0454	that make sense
S0453	yeah it do
S0454	erm but i don't know it's i mean at the moment it seem like psychology and psychiatry they're lean more towards nurture erm but it seem like the treatment be still base on nature so then he be say about how dopamine and serotonin be link to wellbeing but like my sister's take anti depressants and i know those be
S0453	so have mine
S0454	sssis which be about serotonin uptake
S0453	yeah
S0454	so if we say if we're accept that it's mostly nurture why be we mess with the chemistry of the brain
S0453	i think the reason that medication be use in in these situations be because the symptoms can be so acute that do elementary things like just plod along with life and not not take everything out on other people can be a real challenge so that's where medication come in it's like a short term erm bridge to help you get to the long term goal of get better which i agree with you be not go to be through medication it's go to be improve the erm improve your your wellbeing through environmental factor and and want to get better and surround yourself with with people and and erm
S0454	mm mm yeah
S0453	yeah so so i think i think medication do have a role
S0454	okay
S0453	it's not that it doesn't have a role at all but erm particularly in depression i think anxiety be a bite different because with anxiety
S0454	mm
S0453	anxiety pills be really erm intend as short term medication and and not more and actually
S0454	but isn't this be the danger that because gps be busy that you go in
S0453	yeah
S0454	okay initially you get prescribe some anti depressants nothing wrong with that as you say people need a short term survival solution
S0453	mm
S0454	but then because gps be busy they just let you have prescription after prescription and of course that's not go to solve the problem
S0453	true this be true erm the er especially with the gp cut
S0454	mm
S0453	that we have now and they're less likely to erm take a consider approach to the individual patient
S0454	what do you mean by gp cut that there be less of them
S0453	well the cut no well they it's not that there be less of them but they've get less erm well now that gps be manage their own budget gp surgeries
S0454	mm
S0453	they be prioritise cheaper treatments they be it's like a factory production line they're try to get through patients as quickly as possible
S0454	yeah this be a huge mistake isn't it let gps manage their budget
S0453	it be it be a huge mistake er and it basically it it's try to central government be try to save the administrative burden of deal with those budget
S0454	mm
S0453	er and also they're try to incentivise those gps to limit those budget
S0454	right
S0453	but it's actually backfire because it's have a catastrophic effect on the quality of patient care
S0454	yeah
S0453	and particularly around mental health which you know to this day society even develop you know sort of supposedly civilise societies like like in the uk erm think that mental they just don't view mental health as be on a par with physical health
S0454	true
S0453	they just don't
S0454	even though actually people take more time off over stress and other mental issue than they do for physical ailments
S0453	yeah yeah i mean you know you look at erm look at er someone who have be depress for fourteen years
S0454	mm
S0453	for example erm they can't work they can't do anything they they don't have a hope of that they're go to improve that's not different to someone who have erm let's say a chronic disability
S0454	mm
S0453	they can't you know so so this be this be what need to this this need to change this idea that that mental health be you know the the sort of soldier on and you know pull yourself together and carry on approach
S0454	mm
S0453	erm which unfortunately be still prevalent in not just i mean not just in societies that where you'd expect that to be the case where mental health doesn't necessarily get the attention that that it it warrant but also in the west i mean in in the uk
S0454	mm true
S0453	erm so that that that need to change erm it's yeah it's of course it's nature and nurture erm and you're right that medication shouldn't be see as the end
S0454	the solution mm
S0453	it's the mean to the end
S0454	mm yeah so it's a mean to provide some space some distance between the problem and get on with daily life but it can't be use as a permanent solution you can't give someone anti depressants and then tell them to go to work and not address the root of the problem
S0453	yeah absolutely absolutely right
S0454	but then at the end where he say erm that if we can just think in a different way then we'll all be happier i don't know if that's realistic either like tell someone who's depress just to think more positively well they might not be able to do that
S0453	yeah it's a bite it's a bite erm it can be a bite delusional but
S0454	for the average person they probably can like if you're not mentally ill and then someone er train you to think more positively you're probably capable of do that but for someone who's already depress that's just go to be slightly less depress perhaps at the end they're not go to suddenly get better
S0453	yes erm absolutely and er i i don't think there be any easy answer and i think that each individual's erm condition will be unique and will have unique erm er causative factor and
S0454	mm yeah
S0453	and and treatment options erm so that so that we can't look at this i mean we we can at a high level we know it's nature and nurture
S0454	mm
S0453	or we know that erm that the the traditional approach to mental health treatment might not always be the right way of go about things
S0454	no
S0453	so this idea about cognitive behavioural therapy train yourself to think positively all the time erm you know it it can be beneficial
S0454	but it's not perhaps very realistic or even a very natural erm result because nobody be happy all the time it's natural for everyone to feel down sometimes
S0453	mm
S0454	and sometimes there might be a physical reason for it like you know women when they get their period we feel unnaturally depress for a couple of days
S0453	yeah
S0454	and sometimes it might be environmental that you have a bad day at work and sometimes there might not be any discernible reason for it but you know that's real life isn't it we don't have to be happy all the time and we shouldn't feel we do
S0453	yeah absolutely we shouldn't feel we do erm it's natural to have to have vary moods up and down erm
S0454	mm
S0453	that's just the way the way life be but where it become where you stray into the territory of mental illness and it's prevent you from lead a
S0454	yeah
S0453	a you know it's affect your quality of life that's where where you where it's different and the stigma attach to mental health unfortunately still exist
S0454	mm
S0453	erm you know there's still a perception that mental health be just not take as seriously as as physical ailments
S0454	mm
S0453	and that need to change
S0454	yeah
S0453	i think i think the more honestly i think in this culture of celebrities and social media i think the more those celebrities come forward and say that they're open up about the mental illness that they've suffer depression
S0454	mm
S0453	the less you know the the more the stigma will reduce
S0454	don't you think the terminology itself though be stigmatise like say erm depression i mean depression in itself be a negative word it sort of suggest greyness and you know er something go down like the i think he touch upon that but so he say so call mental health issue
S0453	yes
S0454	that that in itself lead to people not be open about it that perhaps most people everybody feel bouts of depression that doesn't mean we're clinically depress but it may be there be better word to use like we don't say patient any more about erm people who see a therapist we talk about clients and that kind of distance them from the idea that they're break
S0453	yeah mm yeah possibly although erm they be break i mean the fact be
S0454	be they
S0453	well i i
S0454	isn't it natural if a woman lose her husband for example after fifty years that she would be depress and there's nothing unnatural about this process of serious grief and depression
S0453	well absolutely
S0454	and they don't need erm you know to be fix per se they need to be give the space to explore their feel which perhaps they don't have anyone to talk to because their husband die and that be their closest you know confidant of fifty years that they need someone outside to to take that place
S0453	absolutely
S0454	and be a listen ear and to to have give be able to give them some perspective but not to tell them to snap out of it and be happy
S0453	no absolutely right but i think that erm we're we need to focus on reduce stigma and effective treatments rather than change of terminology and nomenclature that somehow in this consistent with this sort of politically correct approach to everything er that we think be go to make a meaningful difference cos this be not i mean you know to change terminology that's be build up over years around depression around a patient to then start call it erm you know i don't know whatever you want to call it natural grief or client
S0454	yeah
S0453	that's not go this isn't this be just we're deal with little superficial change here
S0454	but you know it's like some word now have become unacceptable because of the stigma they have associate with them i don't mean mental health i mean what like for example down syndrome we use to call the mongaloid but i mean that be a very insult term because that imply the mongolia doesn't it mongols because of the the way their eye be and we've stop use that because it's well it's insult to everybody it's insult to the person with the condition
S0453	mm
S0454	and it's also get nothing to do with the country or the the feature so i think there be a place for use less judgemental language
S0453	yeah
S0454	right er the same way that
S0453	definitely
S0454	when we talk about black people we don't use word that have you know very accusative mean or
S0453	like what
S0454	well like you know people of colour be a very insult phrase isn't it i mean
S0453	well
S0454	what be we say white people be the absence of colour
S0453	well well i mean look the way i see those be they go through phase don't they i mean you know we have we have a a phase when we say half cast and then it go to mix race and
S0454	mm yeah
S0453	honestly i don't this i don't view as important
S0454	it depend how they're use though
S0453	exactly
S0454	if we only use these word negatively then sell someone you know you be this be go to give them erm a bad feel about it but also they're not go to feel comfortable go to their employer and say i have this like i have a personality disorder i mean what how be the employer go to view that employee if they go and say that they're not go to take them seriously any more they're go to be like oh personality disorder do i really want this person on my team whereas perhaps if we have a different term for it
S0453	mm
S0454	or you know a very umbrella term for it then people wouldn't feel so bad go to their employer and say erm i'm receive therapy at the moment for some personal issue
S0453	yes
S0454	but yeah you're right it's it doesn't make the problem go away but i do think it can help address the stigma around it
S0453	absolutely i think you're right on that note
S0454	yeah just go no sorry just one more thing before we finish if you don't mind erm
S0453	mm yeah sure
S0454	the the thing you be say about nature not be very important erm it be kind of peripheral to his argument i'm not sure i agree because like in my experience mental health issue do run in families
S0453	yeah you're right
S0454	and you could say well that's a product of their upbringing so for example bad parent tend to be intergenerational you don't tend to find you know the grandparents be fantastic parent and then suddenly your parent be terrible i mean that doesn't happen
S0453	no
S0454	so it's because they didn't have a model of good parent that the bad parent model continue cos i mean you learn good parent from somewhere and mostly it's quite unconscious isn't it what you pick up as a child from live in your house for eighteen years but i'm not sure that alone explain it i think that there be something go on at a chemical level erm that be intergenerational and that be something genetic
S0453	yeah
S0454	so if you look at a family without much mental health much in the way of mental health problems then you'd look at it and go well that's nurture
S0453	mm
S0454	you know that one guy who's get mental health issue out of fifty relatives that must be nurture
S0453	mm
S0454	must be erm you know some experience he have maybe at school or something but when you see whole families where all the women seem to have nervous breakdowns that to me suggest that nature be quite important
S0453	yeah yeah
S0454	and it's only by track those families that you'll see that like i've get a great uncle who be in a mental asylum for most of his life but it turn out all of my grandfather's brothers have nervous breakdowns at some point in their live apart from him
S0453	mm
S0454	so i don't know i mean maybe his upbringing be so terrible that erm you know they all develop mental health issue but i don't think so that's not the impression i get their father be undoubtedly strict but it seem there be something biochemical there
S0453	yeah definitely i think you're absolutely right and i think on that note erm we'll er we'll draw that one to a close thank a lot
