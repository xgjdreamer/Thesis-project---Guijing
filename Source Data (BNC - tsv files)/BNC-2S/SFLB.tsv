S0167	she work in theatre like a production manager or something so she work on show and there be a show go on in budapest that she be work on
S0375	i think do erm like music as well
S0167	no just theatre i mean he's work on musicals but he yeah he lose his job at the national theatre
S0375	why
S0167	and erm oh he get make redundant i guess it's just the market isn't it and erm he's get a new job at the royal shakespeare company now
S0375	oh wow but what why be there just not enough
S0167	erm yeah i guess it's just fund and stuff they don't have as much as they do have do they so they just have to let people go and reorganise
S0375	oh it's hell at the moment isn't it it's genuinely hell
S0167	but yeah fortunately he's get a new job pretty quickly sorry the microphone
S0375	sorry
S0167	that's the microphone
S0375	oh i forget actually be he like it still
S0167	who
S0375	mm
S0167	well he's quite new there so i guess he be at the moment whether it'll stay that way i don't know i be gonna apply for a job there actually
S0375	why didn't you
S0167	no i be go to it's a cos i i just put tabs up on my computer of job i see and then gradually i apply for them but i haven't apply for that one yet it's a digital market assistant at the
S0375	oh
S0167	royal shakespeare company that could sound quite fun
S0375	that would be really fun but what do you do at digital market what would you do
S0167	it's just like it mean market but you do it online so i guess it's just like the modern market
S0375	be market something you wanna do then be market cos i think you want to do more sort of publish and write
S0167	i do but then it all kind of merge into one kind of thing so i'm kind of qualify to do all those kind of things i've have the experience and the whatever to do all those kind of things like publish write market
S0375	wow
S0167	they're all kind of under the same umbrella so i've just be apply for all those type of job
S0375	that's brill
S0167	i mean market be mostly write anyway cos you have to write email and you you have to write press release and you have to write erm i don't know posters or leaflets or whatever so it's basically publish but
S0375	what about a erm you have to write people's speeches be it ghost write
S0167	i guess i could apply to be a ghost writer but then you don't get the credit
S0375	i know oh i think that's the worst job ever i don't know who would do it
S0167	although i didn't get credit when i work in peru actually we didn't get erm bylines on our article
S0375	oh
S0167	they just go onto the website with no name there you go that doesn't go in my portfolio
S0375	no this be the nature of the job so anything you do if it doesn't have your name to it you can't put it in your portfolio
S0167	no i could say this be the website i write for this be my article but there's no proof it's my article they would just have to take my word for it so it's not really the same as have it in my portfolio but i've get quite a big portfolio anyway
S0375	cos imagine if you have a really erm i dunno english spy type name like john smith
S0167	yeah oh and it could be anyone
S0375	yeah how do they know it's definitely you
S0167	i dunno i guess they just kind of
S0375	you'd have to you'd have to ask wouldn't you
S0167	that kind of thing that be kind of just trust isn't it
S0375	cos there must a zillion john smiths in the country imagine search for article by john smith you'd be you'd be everywhere
S0167	i know well like i've get all my cuttings from uni that i do like when i write for the paper i've get my like and i've get the book i do in in berlin and they've get my picture in i think so that prove it's me and then my online ones have usually get my picture with them like my blog and my edinburgh portfolio
S0375	you know you read book like fifty shade
S0167	yeah
S0375	it's a really good example but she get into publish there and then get in straight into a job it's obviously not like that it sound like it's pretty competitive
S0167	yeah it be really competitive cos everyone want to do it and then you've get to do like work experience to prove that you want to do it and to have work experience you need money to do the work experience in the first place and it's like you have to do all this free work before you actually get pay
S0375	yeah
S0167	like i've do
S0375	it suck
S0167	i've do so much free work
S0375	yeah do you feel angry do you feel like angry and
S0167	yeah i just wanna be pay now
S0167	but such be life i mean the more i do the better chance i've get i suppose and it's all it all add up
S0375	it do
S0167	and it's all stuff i've enjoy i guess like
S0375	and at least you've carry on like in a way that you haven't want a job that's like full time a full time wage and you've get the money there and then you don't have it anymore and you have some more experience
S0167	yeah
S0375	at least you're on a continual kind of you you know what internships be like and you know it's gonna be for something in the long run
S0167	yeah like that's the thing
S0375	i always think that about people that do their master cos 's just finish her master and she pretty much she work alongside it in this erm well she work on she's get a really good erm good job there but she
S0167	mm
S0375	to pay for a master on the side er but she get pay a pittance like as a nurse clinical psychologies assistant she get twelve thousand i think
S0167	oh right yeah
S0375	and it be just pittance money and although it be ridiculous but with the train she say you know i've i've all i've do be work so far for a good goal at the end i know i'm gonna get a good job at the end
S0167	mm
S0375	but she be like i've just get no money ever well she have because she's still get quite a lot of inheritance from her
S0167	whereas me i've never get money frigging
S0375	yeah

S0167	yeah yeah
S0375	that's crazy what be still with her boyfriend
S0167	yes they've be have some problem areas but erm i'm not sure what's
S0375	what cos she's up there and he's
S0167	well apparently he they they've just start argue a lot and not really connect in an emotional way and erm
S0375	in an emotional capacity
S0167	in an emotional capacity and yeah and she be she be what be happen a few weeks ago just say about how the things he be do that really that be really annoy her and upset her and stuff and she be go oh i don't know how long it's gonna last but you know i'll give it another go but
S0375	isn't it funny that everything everything you use to love about them when it just grind on you
S0167	yeah i'm find out the other way with though like things that use to really grind on my i'm now think ah that's cute
S0375	that's erm that's how long term relationships start that be
S0167	oh oh
S0375	yeah
S0167	well that's what i want
S0375	honestly i read i read a er i'm always read study these days and that's why i'm not in a relationship cos i read all about them so much
S0167	so every time someone speak to you you go i read a study
S0375	i know about this erm they be say yeah like if you start off kind of it it grow into something rather than it be an initial kind of
S0167	yes
S0375	passion and it fizzle out
S0167	because i didn't fancy him at first i didn't fancy him till he ask me out on a date
S0375	didn't with either
S0167	yeah and that's probably the best thing isn't it cos you don't you don't carry on with the expectations the expectations grow as the experience grow
S0375	yeah
S0167	so they're always in tandem they're not like there's not a big gap
S0375	which be potentially where i'm go wrong
S0167	potentially
S0167	you need to find yourself someone you don't fancy and try and find ways and things to like about them
S0375	apparently though mum erm cos obviously we do everything yesterday didn't we go to so we go to and go to primark and go to
S0167	nice
S0375	you know go down
S0167	you just go everywhere
S0375	into well yeah then we go to if they have any bargain and mum texted this to like she get the girls group from school
S0167	yeah
S0375	they have everything like and erm write back and then we go obviously go to erm and write back how do you expect to find anyone like you know really amaze to marry if you keep drag her to all these place
S0375	and i be like yeah mum
S0167	that's true
S0375	like why aren't we go to harrods and
S0167	harrods
S0375	but like where do you meet people really
S0167	you work in a restaurant
S0375	well yeah need to do obviously what you do but it be through work so i might meet someone
S0167	well you might meet someone through work yeah be there no nice speech therapist there or nice doctor you go out with a doctor didn't you
S0375	yeah yeah no that be it be a good day it be a very good day i think we're gonna meet soon erm though no there's there's on there's one doctor at work again he's completely not my type and i didn't like him at first he's really geeky and goony obviously i'm a bite of a goon

S0167	yeah
S0375	a buzz but he's get a girlfriend

S0167	to break them up
S0375	she's like right what can we do
S0375	and then i i don't know whether to drop it into the conversation cos i think be a be a girl ask a guy you know have you get a girlfriend it's very difficult to kind of be blasé about it

S0375	so she be like i i mean have perfect
S0167	why don't you invite him round for dinner and say oh bring your girlfriend you know come and come and you and your girlfriend come round for dinner

S0375	yeah i know what i want at the moment to keep erm
S0167	the thing be the right person will come along if you can enjoy your life live your life do what you want to do and the right person will appear that be what happen that's what happen in life
S0375	what if i'm if i'm like thirty and life's pass by
S0167	life doesn't pass you by cos you'll have be do what you enjoy if you if you stop your life to wait for someone then that's waste your life if you do what you enjoy do what you love then
S0375	i feel like i'm have a midlife crisis at the moment where i'm like oh my god
S0167	you're only twenty four
S0375	i'm twenty five this year
S0167	twenty five just revel in the fact that you don't have to worry about anyone else you you don't have to worry about anything about but yourself all your money can go on yourself
S0375	that's very true i like this think yeah
S0167	yeah oh i've get a coil now
S0375	do you get the coil
S0167	mm
S0375	what's it like
S0167	i don't feel it it be quite painful have it insert but
S0375	i really really want it but everyone's keep put me off how long have you have it
S0167	mm well and both say it be good have get it and she say it be good and 's get it and she say it be good they've all get copper coil though and i want a copper one and the the woman try to put me off she be like erm this be doctor i don't know know her but
S0375	oh yeah
S0167	she be like well
S0375	she's nutty
S0167	yeah but she's quite nice though isn't she she be like well you know it do make your periods more heavy and it do make them quite painful and there be a there be a higher rate of failure and stuff but you know it still it still work and it's not it doesn't fail all the time
S0375	be that the one without the hormone
S0167	yeah the one without the hormone which be what i want
S0375	cos that that's what i want i don't want anything with hormone in it
S0167	yeah
S0375	i don't want to mess around with
S0167	no that's that's my that be my thing as well
S0375	mess around
S0167	erm so she really try to talk me into the the hormonal one and i be like no i'd rather to be honest just avoid hormones cos you know i've be on the pill before and you know it didn't react well with me and i'd rather not risk that again she be like well it's only a tiny bite of hormone really it's a tiny bite of hormone like the pill be a lot of hormone
S0375	no
S0167	and i be like no i think i'll stick with the copper one she be like okay so she go and get the copper one and she say ah there's a problem she say because you haven't have a baby you're go to have a little coil cos they do them two size women who have have children and women who haven't and you're gonna have to have a small one we've only get the copper ones in the big size so you can either come back another time and we'll order in an a smaller coil or we do have the hormonal one in now we've get both size in now so it's up to you and i just think oh i'm here
S0375	get the hormonal one in
S0167	oh yeah she be like it's only a tiny bite of hormone anyway and i be like yeah okay just do the small one that you've get so i've get the hormone one in
S0375	and do you feel any different
S0167	no i don't feel any different really she say the pill be like twenty milligrams of the hormone every day and this be like twenty milligrams of three years so she say it's like
S0375	oh wow
S0167	minimal the amount of hormone you're get and it's much you're much less likely to get pregnant on it than you would on the copper coil although she say the copper coil be still good for contraception but there's just a slightly higher rate of failure with the copper one erm so yeah so i've get that in now it do oh it be like my period when when she insert it i turn up
S0375	i i think that's one you need that you need to be i think
S0167	well i don't think it matter
S0375	cos i i i i ask about it erm
S0167	mm
S0375	i've ask about it so many time and never have it do erm and she say that you need to be on your period they prefer it if you're on your period to get it insert
S0167	ah cos no one ever like say either way to me and then i go there and i say oh sorry i've just start my period yesterday and she be like oh no it's no problem we can still do it
S0167	maybe maybe you you just have a really on the ball doctor
S0375	yeah
S0167	i dunno but anyway
S0375	i go to a clinic
S0167	i be on my
S0375	yeah
S0167	period anyway and it be a bite gross but
S0375	so erm do it how long have you have it in again sorry
S0167	since last week
S0375	oh you've only have it for a week
S0167	mm
S0375	oh i and have you have you have sex with it yet
S0167	no well i haven't have here have i
S0375	oh yeah that's true
S0375	yeah sorry momentary momentary blank
S0167	erm yeah so that's that and and i say to them i go to peru erm last year and i have my injections do and i have hepatitis a and b do here in june and she say if i have another shoot do when i get back that will protect me for longer and she say yes if you have a hepatitis a shoot now that will finish your course that that will protect you for twenty five years so okay that will that sound good i say so do i book at appointment at the reception then to come back in for that she say well we've get them in the fridge now if you if you're feel brave you know you can have it do now if you want
S0375	bung it in
S0167	and i say yeah go on then
S0167	so i have like my i have pain from there while my coil be in and then she just jab a needle in and i be like ah
S0167	but no it be good i just get that all out of the way at one in one fell swoop so now i'm protect for hepatitis a for twenty five years
S0375	i have do the hepatitis b one three time now
S0167	do you never finish the course
S0375	no i finish it just never take it doesn't take on dad either he's like he yeah
S0167	oh
S0375	he's have it do twice with and erm he say that he didn't ever take to it
S0167	so maybe it's just a genetic thing then you
S0375	yeah
S0167	you and your dad
S0375	but you have
S0167	so you just need to make sure you have it do every time you go away
S0375	you have to be like over a thousand or something
S0167	mm
S0375	and erm
S0167	it could be your weird blood
S0375	i've get it do and then yeah maybe and then i've get it do and i be less than five
S0167	oh
S0375	every time less than five and i think what i don't want it do a fourth time i'm gonna be hepatitis bd out with this
S0375	and the first one the first one doesn't make me feel great
S0167	yeah
S0375	and the rest of them be fine like er you know suppose if you're reject something and it make you feel a bite sick
S0167	yeah i know yeah yeah just make sure if you ever go somewhere just to have it do every time you go away and erm
S0375	but no i work in hospitals
S0167	oh yeah
S0375	so i'm suppose to hepatitis b protect
S0167	oh right if it doesn't take it doesn't take do it
S0375	exactly just i've kind of say i don't want it do again i think i might just get one more course to make them happy and then you know
S0167	yeah yeah no that's a good idea that's weird i just think if you have it do you have it do
S0375	yeah i do as well
S0375	they so i be like na ah and the second time no
S0167	you've get a weird body
S0375	i know
S0375	the system of an eight eighty year old it's a little oldie and they've never go to the doctor's never go to the dentist in their life you know like
S0167	oh no go to the dentist you've get to go to the dentist
S0375	oh it be so funny this guy he come in and he he yeah he'd never be to the doctor's in his whole entire life he be like ninety six he'd have a stroke wasn't even a a bad stroke he have actually he have a have a have a erm he be a bite cognitively impair but it's he be quite he'd be able to walk and and erm he'd never be to the dentist either and he just have no teeth just this one rotten stump of a tooth
S0167	er
S0375	they be like you know when it poke out of their lip and they're like hello love and it
S0167	that's horrible
S0375	it be one stump and i think well you've definitely never be to the dentist that's for sure
S0167	cor why do people not go to the dentist that's
S0375	well he's do his whole life in
S0167	yeah but then you have rotten teeth
S0375	well i think he pull out this he pull out his bag and erm obviously this bag with his clothe and want to find his glass and it be to do his assessment thing and in this bag be his jog bottom and they be just like they
S0167	they stink
S0375	stink stink of urine and there be a bite of poo in there as well and
S0167	oh no
S0375	i think he just i think
S0167	be he be he a bite
S0375	i think so yeah
S0167	oh no
S0375	i mean i think there be a bite of an air of maybe a small stroke before that he just get on with
S0167	yeah
S0375	and then erm he be kind of decline then and when he do come to the hospital with the second stroke i mean at ninety six he doesn't really give a damn
S0167	yeah so what happen
S0375	and one old lady
S0167	be he alright after that
S0375	yeah we put put him on some anticoagulants and you know we do say he he might need to go into a nurse home or something now
S0167	yeah
S0375	or go home with carers because
S0167	yeah
S0375	because you know he need helpers and stuff but i don't know i never know what happen to them you don't ever know do you when they leave hospital
S0167	that's weird why don't you set up your own erm speech and language therapy business where you you go to people's home
S0375	you can do i think
S0167	why don't you do that and then you've get your own business then and then you don't have to worry about be sack
S0375	yeah i think i'm a bite young i think
S0167	no no one's too young to start a business
S0375	no but i think my generally in my job you need a bite of experience in like
S0167	oh okay
S0375	i i do actually need to get experience in how to
S0167	yeah
S0375	to assess and
S0167	that's worth think about for the future
S0375	yeah it be yeah and i wouldn't mind do it privately like my but you do always i always think you need cash in hand at first to start a business
S0167	mm that's where you need to save save a bite for a couple of years and then you've get a bite of money
S0375	and then i think i want to live in the next couple of years like i've miss i've be at uni four years i haven't do anything
S0167	yeah
S0375	you know i've be in but it's too expensive i haven't go ski i haven't do any of that sort of stuff that everyone always seem to do sod have a business i'll do that when i'm older on er i want to ski
S0167	live
S0375	yeah you know i really you've be ski you've be ski haven't you
S0167	yeah i go i've be for one weekend ski i mean i think it take a bite of practice i wasn't very good but i only do it for two days
S0375	yeah do you wish you'd do it for longer
S0167	i think a weekend be enough for me just because it it i be a beginner and like
S0375	you you didn't really
S0167	yeah i think if i go on a week's ski holiday that would be good but
S0375	i mean even on a now i can't walk in a straight line can you imagine me on ski
S0375	i can imagine rock up in to the bar
S0167	it be fun it's just it be really cold i have to say obviously cos of the mountains
S0167	erm but yeah no it be fun but i'd recommend just to like i would go for a couple more ski weekend first and then to go on a
S0375	well you didn't do anything like the dry ski slop or anything do you
S0167	no
S0375	like people here do it do it when she go recently they go on like a few sessions of ski slop
S0167	no i just go to the mountains
S0375	you just go all out and go straight to ski
S0167	i go to the mountains i be on the baby slope though which be like that steep
S0375	that would be enough for me
S0167	i be with with the two year olds
S0375	use to probably oh you snow plough into these er
S0167	oh yeah that be on the slightly that be the that be the erm
S0375	because they go blue don't they
S0167	yeah the well green be lower than blue there's green blue
S0375	and then black
S0167	red and black
S0375	that's it yeah
S0167	green blue red black
S0375	they all seem to be very much the same don't they
S0167	yeah
S0375	cos i think have the same colour she go to andorra
S0167	oh well i go on the red one accidentally and it be really steep and then when i go on a green one and i be like god this be more my
S0375	do you go down the red one
S0167	yeah
S0375	do you manage it
S0167	not really i couldn't really control myself no it's because okay so we go this girl organise it who's like she's be do ski since she be like three she didn't notice the colour of the slope she just take us on this slope and we like none of us could get it and after about an hour she be like oh we're on the red slope no wonder none of you be get it cos we all just couldn't control ourselves we be all just whiz off and like fall off cos it be so steep and we didn't know how to control ourselves
S0167	and that's the one below black
S0375	yeah
S0167	it's the so that be a really hard one to like begin with so we go on the baby ones and then we be much better
S0375	oh bless you
S0375	bless you little ducklings
S0167	yeah that's what we be like cos she keep say right go off and then stop yourself and i couldn't stop myself so i be just whiz off like and i didn't know how to stop myself
S0375	she's
S0167	so i just have and erm so i just use to she say if you really can't stop just sit down on your bum and that will slow you down so i would just do that every time i want to stop i'd just sit on my bum and then you'd just come to a slow half stop
S0167	well
S0375	what even on the green slope
S0167	yeah even on the green one
S0375	you didn't master
S0167	didn't even master it i keep try i didn't master it i need a bite more practice i think
S0375	be you on your own then on the green slope in the end or be you with other people
S0167	with other people people that yeah i think with a bite more practice i'd be alright i think with anything
S0375	do you have to rent ski stuff and everything like that
S0167	yeah you have to rent the ski
S0375	be it expensive
S0167	i can't remember how much it be really i remember i just go and erm i get the ski jacket no lend me a ski jacket the helmet the ski and the pole i get and i i go on the cable car at to the top of the mountain and then it be cool
S0375	cos erm 's a good skier isn't she
S0167	yeah she's like black slope
S0375	do she
S0167	she get off she's er she's even erm above that she's er off piste she do it off piste which be over the which be more than the black slope
S0375	do she what
S0167	mm
S0375	she just go anywhere sort of thing
S0167	yeah which be quite dangerous actually
S0375	yeah
S0167	but she i guess she's quite experience so she know where to go and where not to go and stuff
S0375	she i didn't know that be she still do pt work by the way

S0375	yeah
S0375	yeah
S0167	on a ski slope hospital
S0375	oh could you imagine
S0167	that would be cool
