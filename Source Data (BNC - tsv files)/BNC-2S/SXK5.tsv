S0554	rs
S0405	rs you know how we can apply it to people or situations and look at culture identity all that kind of thing whereas ucl they they say it's interdisciplinary but it seem much more about what you be think the sciences be which be anatomy physiology you know the chemistry erm i like genetics but they go really deep into it on a science level which could be really useful for lot of job but not really what i'd be interest in right

S0405	exactly yeah
S0554	vodka doesn't mix as well as rum
S0405	yeah it's just kind of like bulk things up with alcohol with
S0554	gin
S0405	a slight taste
S0554	gin as well gin's really good with mix
S0405	yeah yeah yeah erm talk to about whisky and stuff he be like whisky be really hard to get into until you're like

S0554	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0405	er he be say like two things you can do you either just mix it with ginger and she be suggest or you start with a a little bite and dilute it with water then you slowly add more and more whisky until eventually you you like the taste of whisky
S0554	i prefer whisky over vodka like vodka's just no flavour at all it's just there be no flavour
S0405	how about the
S0554	no no no
S0405	really
S0554	there's still no flavour

S0405	right
S0554	it taste of too much of nothing
S0405	okay yeah yeah
S0554	unless you mix it and that's why people

S0554	so like when you take shots you're just like oh this be fine it doesn't taste of anything
S0405	right
S0554	it's not that pleasurable it just get you drink rum and whisky
S0405	yeah
S0554	eventually it'll start to taste nice
S0405	yeah
S0554	so that's why people will drink it gin

S0554	gin gin and tonic
S0405	gin gin

S0554	yeah well i'll take the thirtieth off and i can work any other day
S0405	okay yeah yeah
S0554	yeah that'll be fine so oh
S0405	so good oh
S0554	yeah be we even halfway
S0405	do you ever wanna be bartender well i wanna learn how to make drink not shitty drink not like some
S0554	like this one
S0405	yeah i think it really impress girls if you're like like take a girl back to your place and then give her some shitty energy drink concoction or some fuck whisky and coke it's just so shit but if you can make this
S0554	it's probably really easy to find online
S0405	yeah they're not even hard there be like a youtube channel with a simple bartender or something
S0554	it's like
S0405	simple drink or something and they like make so easy shit
S0554	bottle be expensive
S0405	yeah yeah
S0554	like how much be the ciroc like twenty pound be it
S0405	cheapest you get cheapest you get be like twenty two quid
S0554	yeah
S0405	erm but that's fine if you're only have if you only wanna get tipsy then you only need like a quarter of that really it's only when we have a party
S0554	you can
S0405	that it get everyone
S0554	i dunno if i go to uni i will keep a bottle in my house i will keep like a i dunno a few bottle of rum maybe one or two bottle of vodka
S0405	yeah
S0554	and maybe some gin
S0405	yeah
S0554	i'll probably want to
S0405	i dunno
S0554	in my house
S0405	i just would people steal it i dunno
S0554	what
S0405	if you take alcohol
S0554	oh no that's a good point
S0405	that's why i think erm people always buy drink when they go out they don't er they don't host party they just go out and drink
S0554	yeah you're right right
S0405	that's why i think the nights out be so expensive cos you come to a bar and drink be so expensive and you keep drink and you wanna get drink but you have to pay a lot so er that's why
S0554	maybe something like i mean it's all pretty because you're probably gonna be live in rent room
S0405	yeah
S0554	they're gonna have a limit on alcohol
S0405	yeah
S0554	and how
S0405	what would they would they be able to find out would they
S0554	no
S0405	find out
S0554	yeah because if you get fuck up and then you fuck everything up
S0405	yeah yeah
S0554	you're fuck
S0405	yeah yeah
S0554	like you have to everything just to get like imagine the amount of vodka we go through after your party
S0405	yeah that's true and they have yeah mostly these have cleaners every day into your room so they will fuck know they'll they'll know if you're hide alcohol or anything er
S0554	i guess that's why a lot of people go out
S0405	yeah but they know you're gonna they know you're gonna drink cos it's uni isn't it so
S0554	yeah
S0405	you know so but i mean
S0554	this if i'm if i'm live not in uni accommodation
S0405	yeah
S0554	you can buy alcohol
S0405	yeah
S0554	whoever be live with us just ask them to
S0405	that's true but i think there's a lot of break kid that wanna try and get as much free alcohol at uni as possible
S0405	you fuck what you won't fuck what you know party crashers or whatever
S0554	i dunno i that's that's a really hard situation that
S0405	anyway what be you most look forward to about uni
S0554	the course
S0405	really yeah that's good
S0554	i mean that's the reason you should want to go to uni
S0405	oh yeah fuck yeah
S0554	for the course
S0405	if you if you end up
S0554	it's not for the drink
S0405	yeah i know
S0554	not for the go out for the course
S0405	absolutely
S0554	like straight up the course be what i'm look forward to
S0405	good
S0554	whatever uni i like that i go to as long as i like the course bar 's course be good
S0405	what about
S0554	but it be in the middle apparently it's the deadest uni
S0405	really
S0554	in the country yeah
S0405	i'm sure that's just like
S0554	it's it's in the middle of it be actually in the middle of nowhere
S0405	yeah
S0554	that's what a lot of people find with a lot of campus unis
S0405	right
S0554	middle of nowhere be the exception
S0405	right but i mean
S0554	even even 's pretty dead apparently
S0405	but i think you kind of create your you create your own kind of community of your uni i mean that's what i think about down in that it would be so so dead there wouldn't be anything but
S0405	the university be so yeah it's so live like they have more club there you have more time to go to club than
S0554	oh like bar and stuff
S0405	it's anywhere else yeah like they have a lot of club
S0554	will you be a bartender at uni oh we be
S0405	i wouldn't mind
S0554	we be go on about it with and stuff would you be would you
S0405	what's that
S0554	like to be a bartender
S0405	erm
S0554	i think it would be
S0405	not a bartender but just to find out how to make drink so
S0554	i think i think be a bartender would like you get to know
S0405	yeah if you get behind a bar
S0554	you you get to talk to lot of people
S0405	yeah
S0554	and you're make cocktails
S0405	yeah and then you could learn how to make those cocktails which ones be the best so maybe i will train as a bartender that's what i wanna do train as a bartender so i can er
S0554	and you work at a bar for a bite
S0405	yeah yeah just do it i dunno i dunno how easy it be
S0554	i'm eighteen now i'm eighteen so i can
S0405	oh you could do it yeah can you serve alcohol at eighteen though
S0554	yeah yeah
S0405	don't you have to be oh right yeah
S0554	you can serve alcohol it's the the biggest problem be like a lot of place that i can work at
S0405	yeah
S0554	will have to be during the day
S0405	right
S0554	and no one drink cocktails during the day
S0405	yeah yeah
S0554	so at most i'll be sell beers
S0405	yeah yeah
S0554	and then serve people food unless
S0405	yeah work at
S0554	i work at a club
S0405	yeah er
S0554	and when i when i go to the club i be like i dunno how these bartenders keep it up but
S0405	yeah
S0554	like everyone's so fuck drink the music's so loud how they can hear anything
S0405	it's crazy you probably get use to it from when i er visit unis erm and load of people seem to er work at the actual bar at the uni so they work for the uni at these bar i think
S0554	yeah
S0405	all they really do be serve beer though so erm
S0554	i think when it get late in the club
S0405	yeah i don't think you
S0554	i dunno what i hear be like a lot of bartenders at uni get drink as well
S0405	right what themselves
S0554	that's what
S0405	you're you can't do that and work can you
S0554	people do
S0405	they just like sneakily like take a shoot of
S0554	i mean work a bar for a student union isn't exactly serious be it
S0405	no it's true yeah i wanna learn
S0554	if you
S0405	how to make this okay i wanna make a copy
S0554	write it down
S0405	yeah
S0554	google it youtube it
S0405	yeah yeah three percent but yeah
S0554	three percent
S0405	yeah should take a picture of that menu or i can look it up online but it's good so
S0405	sorry sorry so easy to analyse something i have so many leftover fuck lime from the party cos i make like three we use one and er they be literally the shittest lime ever they don't have any juice cos i try to use it in my cook but
S0554	really
S0405	they're not they're not they're not great they're not great
S0554	well oh so be you look to make so everything you make be from the erm
S0405	from the book yeah so i wanna use tofu there's this thing call miso paste which be they describe as pure like the meat taste it's the japanese word for meat taste so it add like depth to a dish so er
S0554	that's
S0405	and then i wanna cook with some more rice that kind of thing you know they call for one of those to be like take back to the store do you wanna keep it
S0554	i be keep it it's
S0405	oh if it explode i'm sure you can't
S0405	be it good like what be the problem they're like overheat or something
S0554	overheat and they're like melt and
S0405	be that it's cos like
S0554	it's when people overcharge you
S0405	be it it's cos like everyone every single phone operator suddenly start provide these that i i don't think they check them enough

S0405	they've call them all back
S0405	mine be

S0554	which be like the worst in the country
S0405	yeah yeah which
S0554	so it's like it's really
S0405	they're the worst what the fuck
S0554	it's it's a really bad uni
S0405	yeah yeah
S0554	also they're not exactly the smartest
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0554	or they they've be like school dropouts college dropouts and it's really nice to have that different perspective

S0554	i dunno how you want to drink yours so
S0405	it's so good man yeah put that on the side you know
S0554	my sister eat these casually
S0405	it's quite good oh no might be good i dunno let them see you properly
S0554	my plan be to go out
S0405	yeah
S0554	and tell my sisters drinking's really bad out
S0405	yeah
S0554	so she won't drink out she will only drink with her friends
S0405	oh that's better though you drink with your friends than just get out and get drink with people you don't know wow be you still plan for the er for the rugby game yeah i've get a party that day but erm
S0554	really
S0405	it start at like seven so
S0554	where be it
S0405	er my auntie's sixtieth like any other party i'd just ditch but it's kind of like yeah yeah
S0554	sixtieth
S0405	she buy she's the one that buy all the drink for my party and everything and she's like
S0554	oh the only white auntie you have
S0405	the the only white auntie she's like she's rely on us come so but er that's at like seven so
S0554	how old be she sixty
S0405	sixty sixty yeah so she just retire this year and get marry so
S0554	oh oh that's
S0405	er
S0405	oh no no so it's kick off be at three right i think it's at three so
S0554	it'll finish it'll finish by
S0405	five
S0554	five six and it's
S0405	five six
S0554	and it's it's only in
S0405	yeah no yeah
S0554	so it's it's
S0405	that's fine then but then i we i get home maybe an hour an hour and a half and then my mum will drive me so i can go to it
S0554	thing be i have no fuck
S0405	eat the bean
S0554	no
S0554	no no like that's bad it's bad for me
S0405	if i
S0554	i honestly
S0405	if i didn't have the
S0554	yeah i don't i have no idea how to get to by public transport absolutely cos er my auntie
S0405	yeah
S0554	she live a five minute walk away from stadium
S0405	really
S0554	so whenever i go to twickenham i'd go on my own with my sister with friends
S0405	yeah
S0554	or with erm my dad er we would always go to their house park up their house and walk i've never be there by public transport
S0405	shit erm we can google it i mean obviously
S0554	i
S0405	we can find out how but
S0554	i've be to i've catch the bus to and then walk from to
S0405	yeah
S0554	and it's like a half an hour walk i dunno that that might be viable
S0405	if it's if it's
S0554	might be
S0405	better than cos they have suggest rout for like where it won't be so busy if you take the normal route then it's like
S0554	the thing be like if you go to and then walk it be really short
S0405	yeah
S0554	and there's no traffic cos you're walk
S0405	yeah er there's i've never be to a like i go to a couple of chelsea match and like you either
S0554	really
S0405	yeah you either go to er or there's one that's like a ten minute walk away and it's somewhat
S0554	well that's that's because
S0405	quieter
S0554	there's a tube
S0405	yeah yeah
S0554	be not inside central
S0405	oh shit yeah
S0554	it's it's on the outskirts
S0405	shit yeah
S0554	that's what i be think
S0405	but they have the train they have a train
S0554	they do they do so it'll be so busy it might not be worth it that's that's why i'm think walk
S0405	okay yeah we can walk to
S0554	well walk from catch the
S0405	what about afterwards walk from it
S0554	when i go i go with
S0405	yeah
S0554	er walk out to it and walk back to
S0405	okay
S0554	and it be really easy
S0405	be it good okay yeah let's do that if it if it's not as busy then the i can just yeah go
S0554	the go right past
S0405	really close to my house so i can get pick up from there or something or i'll yeah that'll work that'll work out that'll work out
S0554	that's the main problem for me like the reason i come to like
S0405	yeah
S0554	there's a direct train
S0405	right
S0554	but for there isn't
S0405	what about from where how how do you get to your house
S0554	i'd have to go to and then from to
S0405	really
S0554	the easiest way
S0405	shit
S0554	be if i somehow get to
S0405	right
S0554	go to and then catch a bus from to that would be the easiest way
S0405	erm
S0554	but i've never how to do that
S0405	you could get on the and then there's a stop on the and you can take the which go to so you would take two bus and you end up at erm which i could tell you where that be on on the bus or whatever but erm i'm not sure if that's what you wanna do so
S0554	yeah maybe
S0405	yeah
S0554	i i be just fairly sure there's a direct er route cos
S0405	oh yeah
S0554	on my train journey here through national rail
S0405	yeah
S0554	we go past there there's the stop at
S0405	yeah
S0554	like that's just there
S0554	my train pass right to next why couldn't be a rugby club

S0554	so there be three good french team toulouse
S0405	yeah
S0554	who have win three
S0405	yeah
S0554	title
S0405	yeah
S0554	but they've lose every game this season for the champion cup
S0405	yeah
S0554	toulon who have win two title
S0405	yeah
S0554	they be the reign champion they've win the last two or three i
S0405	okay
S0554	yeah i think three or two
S0405	yeah
S0554	i can't remember erm
S0554	so yeah they've obviously be play well
S0405	yeah
S0554	erm and then clermont er fourth
S0405	right
S0554	oh clermont which be they're quite good they have nick venton do you know who nick venton be
S0405	no i don't
S0554	david strettle jonathan er jonathan davies
S0405	oh right
S0554	the frenchman er not frenchman welshman
S0405	right
S0554	they they're play quite well oh erm harlequin also have er jamie roberts welshman
S0405	okay
S0554	he's sick yeah clermont be good and then race metro they have dan carter
S0405	okay
S0554	so they're also really good so four french team
S0405	where do where do most of like new zealand and australia's players play
S0554	france
S0405	be there a league oh france yeah yeah
S0554	so and erm
S0405	south
S0554	australian
S0405	okay yeah
S0554	australian have south african players
S0554	but
S0405	yeah yeah
S0554	but because they don't get pay a lot
S0405	they have their own league don't they
S0554	yeah so it's super rugby but super rugby doesn't pay a lot erm
S0405	do it not
S0554	no
S0405	oh right
S0554	because if you imagine like the population of new zealand
S0405	yeah
S0554	the population of france and then that that amount go to rugby game
S0405	yeah
S0554	it's much greater in france so they get a lot
S0405	they have enough to like transport each other to all the different like stadiums or
S0554	cos that's
S0405	be that minimal compare to like
S0554	yeah i think that's minimal like the highest amount of money a team in the premiership the english premiership
S0405	yeah
S0554	can spend be much less than i think something like three time less than the shittest team in the french league
S0405	really fuck hell
S0554	that's why they all
S0405	that's a big difference
S0554	go to france
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0554	cos they get there's no salary cap in england
S0405	yeah
S0554	there be but in france there isn't
S0405	yeah
S0554	that's why french rugby's kind of open like before that it use to be very much irish dominate
S0405	yeah
S0554	so er irish and scottish so glasgow warriors erm leinster
S0405	leinster
S0554	and munster
S0405	yeah
S0554	they use to win all the time
S0405	okay yeah
S0554	but they they haven't be do so well
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0554	they've be lose
S0405	okay yeah our
S0554	which be
S0405	cause use to be munster and leicester at rugby our win er
S0554	erm
S0405	okay so what's what's good about the english league what do you see as like
S0554	english players i think
S0405	oh right
S0554	you get to see them
S0405	play basically yeah
S0554	english club be dominate the european scene at the moment
S0405	yeah
S0554	two weeks ago in the second round of the championship

S0405	yeah
S0554	that be massive
S0405	oh
S0554	that's what i be tell
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0554	because toulon be the barcelona of football they be
S0405	oh i see
S0554	the richest they be the best team by far er they can't really be dominate apart from maybe clermont and stuff like that so they're
S0554	english english team after the world cup after embarrass themselves
S0405	yeah
S0554	be play really really really well
S0405	how come do you think
S0554	i dunno i mean

S0554	of english rugby er after get promote they be now second in the league and they beat clermont

S0405	yeah
S0554	erm we be play we're play badly this season we lose our first three game but we've win everything since then
S0405	right

S0405	okay oh i see yeah
S0554	and i use to go and watch all the match
S0405	really
S0554	with my mat yeah
S0405	shit shit
S0554	and it's only after they leave that i start to like them
S0405	really
S0554	but yeah would be my second favourite team
S0405	yeah
S0554	be good but they don't have many
S0405	didn't they use to dominate
S0554	they have
S0405	a lot more
S0554	they have a lot
S0405	oh
S0554	but the reason they're so good
S0405	yeah
S0554	they be i think like fourth
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0554	in the premiership erm they're do really well in europe as well
S0405	what happen like wasn't it like five years ago they win it every year didn't they but they be like
S0554	yeah
S0405	so dominate
S0554	yeah they use to be really good they use to be dominant i think
S0405	yeah yeah
S0554	be but now they have hardly any
S0405	i see
S0554	erm there be only five team in the champion cup from
S0405	okay
S0554	from england
S0405	from england
S0554	and wasps be the one of them
S0405	i see
S0554	so they're play well erm wasps have amaze players really good players
S0405	yeah
S0554	which all should have be in the england team
S0405	yeah
S0554	but i can think think of two people that should have definitely be in england team
S0405	yeah
S0554	that weren't or at least in the train squad erm elliot daly
S0405	yeah
S0554	you he's only twenty four he will definitely be in england and then joe simpson who's quite old but he be the best scrum half in the premiership last season
S0405	really jeez
S0554	i mean i dunno i dunno what it be with wasps but they're just not they be a team of young people
S0405	yeah
S0554	like their back line be no older than twenty five
S0405	oh really
S0554	the majority of it's twenty three to twenty five
S0405	really
S0554	they also get charles piutau do you know him all black number fifty
S0405	oh okay
S0554	erm not recently but
S0405	yeah yeah
S0554	their back but he's he's really good he's be really with wasps
S0405	yeah
S0554	and then
S0405	okay
S0554	he's also a all black winger
S0405	right
S0554	for a few years ago
S0405	he be
S0554	so that's help them in their and do you remember christian wade be he he play for he go to and he's
S0405	oh yeah you tell me
S0554	he play for the irish lions
S0405	okay okay
S0554	er he's injure so
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0554	but wasps be definitely contenders for the i think
S0405	for the champion yeah
S0554	this season
S0405	yeah
S0554	will be not bath they're too shit at the moment
S0405	yeah
S0554	er after they lose to saracens in the finals last year they've be lose pretty much every game
S0405	yeah
S0554	i mean northampton beat them away at bath
S0405	yeah
S0554	so they're play pretty badly saracens northampton exeter wasps leicester
S0405	yeah
S0554	those would be my contenders for the title but i think it might be too early to say
S0405	yeah yeah i see so much of an effect do the manager have cos like be that
S0554	erm
S0405	be that why wasps be do badly like
S0554	the manager doesn't have much effect on it
S0405	really oh right
S0554	they're just there for the money
S0405	it's not like football
S0554	and for the players
S0405	yeah yeah
S0554	so like to buy a new players that that would be for the manager but it's not like football there isn't a transfer window
S0405	right
S0554	it's just at the begin of the season you buy new players
S0405	oh right
S0554	during the season you can't change that
S0554	so those louis picamole be come to northampton at the start of next season
S0405	yeah
S0554	he's play for his french team toulouse at the moment erm but yeah it's it's not much

S0554	they're very hard to find like
S0405	oh right
S0554	and if erm and football it's so easy to find highlight
S0405	yeah
S0554	it's like here it's like every team from the champion stuff
S0405	yeah
S0554	er the second division like the europa league the challenge cup
S0405	do you think it inspire you to play though
S0554	yeah
S0405	right
S0554	definitely definitely
S0405	watch it yeah yeah
S0554	but i think mainly it's more down to laziness
S0405	really yeah yeah yeah
S0554	because
S0405	i couldn't deal with the train that's the main thing i can't train it's so take it so out of you you're like
S0554	but but like for you it's hard i understand because you have to catch
S0405	right
S0554	a a train
S0405	yeah yeah yeah no i have to
S0554	to go to
S0405	no i i cycle there always cycle there
S0554	that's even worse
S0405	but my bike's be shit recently so
S0554	that's even worse like
S0405	but it it keep me really fit in year eleven and twelve but not anymore i just
S0554	but that take away too much of your time
S0405	yeah it
S0554	even for me my club's like go on a thursday night
S0405	yeah
S0554	finish quite late just really take it out of you and then when i have to catch a bus in the morning at
S0405	yeah
S0554	six o'clock
S0405	yeah
S0554	at six thirty it's er it's just too much
S0405	i get you to be quite honest with the er with the people at like i get on with like three of them and then there be a couple of others who be they're both
S0554	right right
S0405	there be a couple of others who be really awesome but a lot of them be dicks a lot of them be real dicks
S0554	really
S0405	like they weren't dicks to me particularly but i just like
S0405	right
S0405	erm but you be like they be actually dickheads they they like a lot of so there's only a couple of them that i i i hang out with outside of the rugby club erm and one of them leave this year cos he have some fuck up family shit or something so and no one know what happen to him really weird like he be he be really funny
S0554	it be very similar to me the majority of the a team be complete arseholes
S0405	yeah
S0554	all the b team i be really close friends with
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0554	so that's why i find it easy cos when you go to b game match none of the a team players would be there or only
S0405	oh right
S0554	about two of them would be there
S0405	yeah yeah yeah
S0554	so i'd have a great time
S0405	i see
S0554	with you you only really have one team
S0405	we have one team so it's really like that's it between people i mean i get on with everyone there now but it's just like tour be always sick i love the tour like the two tour i go on be the best things ever i get i get drink just have a good time but er and and er i'd really like to get to see cos like before that i have you know an
