S0486	yeah erm yes i yes i suppose yeah the erm
S0526	mm
S0486	and of course it's the same colour as the the what what do they call it over there the pavilion the
S0526	yes
S0486	yeah
S0526	yeah
S0486	it's the same colour as the
S0526	i think it be do with that in mind to merge everything in

S0526	yeah
S0486	a bite
S0526	yeah
S0486	cohesive really but then they go for these erm bright blue rail didn't they
