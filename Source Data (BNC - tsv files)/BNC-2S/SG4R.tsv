S0529	bother
S0530	ah
S0529	and continue watch it
S0529	yeah that's and i've just have pasta and i really wish i'd make more cos i'm really hungry still
S0530	oh be you
S0529	and i can't be arsed to make more cos effort you know oh i'm gonna have to go shop tomorrow and have like no food
S0530	oh have you run out
S0529	yeah
S0530	damn
S0529	oh and i dunno what i'm gonna do really like about this week
S0530	what be you feel about it right now like
S0529	i dunno like i just it's difficult cos i've have the whole week off so it's kind of give i've i've literally have like seven days off and give me like a load of kind of erm like a lack or almost care about it really like i haven't really be think about
S0530	mm
S0529	this week as go back to you know be at uni and be part of a you know like education environment it's just not really occur to me yet
S0530	mm
S0529	and i'm just a bite worry about tuesdays
S0530	what's on tuesday
S0529	erm an art seminar
S0530	oh yeah
S0529	yeah cos i've never be one and i dunno if i'm go to start go to them or just kind of like
S0530	i mean if you can if you feel able to
S0529	mm
S0530	i think it would be a good idea because
S0529	yeah
S0530	after the half term i think if there's any moment that you can feel you'd mentally be able to jump back in it's this week after the break
S0529	mm yeah no i agree
S0530	and obviously it it doesn't work out if it doesn't work out then you'll know then but if you don't go back after this week if you just like
S0529	mm
S0530	what if i have turn it around that week sort of thing you know
S0529	yeah exactly
S0530	and i know it's really really hard to actually
S0529	i just really don't know how to turn it around
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	it feel like an insurmountable problem and then it
S0529	but it's fine
S0530	no i think you'll be able to do it if you if you've just focus on get not even focus on try to work at the moment just say it's a challenge for you to get there because it be a moment to be attend
S0529	mm
S0530	so i'd focus on that and then when you can maybe focus on actually like i take it one step at a time like first start go second step actually start be able to take stuff in in the lecture and the seminars
S0529	mm
S0530	maybe the next step do independent work you don't have to go above and beyond you don't have to do you know a something incredible you don't have to produce first piece of work you don't have to do that it's just about cos that's the thing with you cos i don't think you're use to like do the minimum kind of thing you're use to do really well and want to do really well
S0529	really but
S0530	no but when when
S0530	if you go back to your other work if you you probably work really hard at english like you it sound like you fuck like go for that grade
S0529	mm yeah i suppose
S0530	and maybe
S0529	think i do
S0530	yeah
S0529	but it's just you like do you think that i can actually get this back
S0530	and yeah yes of course i i wouldn't be say this to you now
S0529	i don't know
S0530	if if i think that you you should go home i would've tell you
S0529	do you do you really
S0530	of course i would've do cos i've be in this situation
S0529	would you yes
S0530	and i remember when people you know i know in some case some people should go home university's
S0529	yeah
S0530	not for them
S0529	but i just i do feel like that i feel like it may be
S0530	the mm
S0529	not might not be for me like
S0530	mm
S0529	oh it's just confuse really dunno i mean cos even when i be like kind of in a better frame of mind i still wanna go to university it's never be like
S0530	the goal
S0529	what i want to do
S0530	yeah
S0529	well no it kind of be the goal because that's just what you expect that's what people expect of you
S0530	mm
S0529	that's it's the kind of expect path to take
S0530	mm
S0529	after school and college
S0530	yeah
S0529	but i never ever like since i be younger
S0530	particularly want
S0529	all the years like lead up to it i've never want to go to university i've always think think i would be completely out of my depth and here we be so yeah it's just
S0530	i mean yeah for me as well i'm the same really like personally i never want to go there i
S0529	mm
S0530	yeah people students that have do you know they be enjoy school be expect to go onto
S0529	yeah
S0530	university
S0529	but i do enjoy school but it's completely different
S0530	yeah
S0529	it's not
S0530	it's not school here
S0529	it's not the same in the slightest and i prefer kind of not be spoon feed but just know a little bite what be expect of me
S0530	mm
S0529	because we have teachers who would tell us what we be expect to do
S0530	to do
S0529	and i like that because there be some sort of you know certainty to it
S0530	mm yeah
S0529	but just here it's just
S0530	you're just not sure what you have to do
S0529	you know it's no no not at all i don't know i just worry about the kind of person i'll become if i go home i mean cos i've change so much like just this past year by just
S0530	mm
S0529	sit around so much like people say it to me all the time like i'm a really different kind of person
S0530	in what in what way do they say you're different
S0529	like you know i've never er they just say like i just i just speak differently and i just act differently and react to things differently and i'm just not as interest or kind of i dunno enthusiastic or
S0530	mm
S0529	i dunno yeah which i kind of get but also i feel like i've always be negative like that but i suppose no i i mean i definitely have get worse like it's so obvious like like i be read through like my archive from like last year and the year before and it's just like the contrast be quite frighten like
S0530	mm
S0529	like how much someone can sort of change the way they think about stuff it's just like some of the stuff i write when i be on you know tumblr a few years ago it's just like that's not me that's not i don't know and i just worry that if i go home it's just gonna be like that again and
S0530	i think like obviously i think for a lot of part of grow up be that you get more cynical
S0529	yeah
S0530	but at the same time the way you're feel right now isn't just down to get older at all
S0529	no
S0530	like mm i mean you know when when you be do your a level do you feel how how what do you feel when you be do your a level i know that be a long time ago
S0529	do feel like a long time ago
S0530	but like
S0529	i mean i be depress
S0530	yeah
S0529	i wasn't
S0530	yeah
S0529	any well i be different to how i be now but i yeah i be depress but i have i just like college be the distraction like i just do
S0530	okay
S0529	i just do the work for the exams but i didn't do enough because i couldn't concentrate for very long and er with all the mess but no i be a lot better than i be now
S0530	mm
S0529	even though i be still kind of have the same problems really i be a lot less anxious that's the thing that have change so much i think
S0530	you just yeah
S0529	i've become like really anxious just with everything like with literally pretty much everything in my life it's become mm
S0530	yeah that thing
S0529	this sort of
S0530	mm
S0529	anxiety and it's just like an irrational thing that's happen because of you know the way i've spend last year i suppose and just like the things that happen last year and yeah
S0530	i think the more you're isolate the more prevalent can become
S0529	yeah exactly no definitely
S0530	because you kind of i don't know you just and i think that's why i be doubtful i think this be why in hindsight my parent be doubtful about me take a gap year when i tell them i didn't in the end i go to uni but
S0529	mm
S0530	i think this be the sort of reason like after six months like i don't know what happen it's just i get even worse than when i have be at university and it it's really scary isn't it like i can't imagine
S0529	yeah i know it's to imagine like be like be worse than you be when cos i think i'd like hit the lowest point when i be uni last year
S0530	right
S0529	but like i have like no idea how bad it would be when i get home like i just it be
S0530	same same i think things would improve when i get home and they didn't
S0529	yeah i know just horrible really no i mean if i go home it's just
S0530	it's return to that
S0529	and like it really doesn't
S0530	but yeah
S0529	and my family would
S0530	eat you alive
S0529	they would just be yeah i mean i could deal with that cos i'm i i i deserve it like i could deal with it if they be angry at me i just can't deal with the disappointment and the upset and the worry and all of that side of it cos that that really that really bother me like i don't
S0530	mm
S0529	i don't want them to be like that and it's just and it would be so difficult to get a job as well like there's just no chance for work in in it's just impossible to get a job especially at this time of year and then i'd feel too anxious to do that anyway
S0530	i read something about it be quite interest actually it be like if i find it again i'll tell you
S0529	mm
S0530	it be like an article that some like an a graduate write when they leave uni and one of the things that they wish they'd do when they start university like all the stuff they'd wish that they'd've do differently and i be like okay and in my first year i'm gonna read this because it's you know
S0529	mm
S0530	why not and she say what be it i can't remember if it be a he or a she but they be talk about the kind of the stress that you go through think about the years ahead that actually be quite paralyse
S0529	mm
S0530	and they wish they hadn't worry because it's not even though it can be hard workwise like you shouldn't see it as a mountain that's ahead of you and you're gonna fall off it kinda thing like like it can be difficult but it's not what you think it's gonna be in term of and it's probably gonna be tempt to drop out and feel like you've mess things up but you haven't mess things up for yourself not and that probably i know that sound ridiculous to you but in the space of a three year course you haven't mess things up by not go in the first term you know like it's not even the end of the first term yet we've get halfway through the first term if somebody have go through high school say i wanna drop out because i've mess up my first term year like you'd tell them it be that be that would be silly wouldn't it because they've get so much more to go and there's still chance
S0529	oh but it's the money that's what make it different
S0530	in that time mm
S0529	it's the fact that it's not compulsory it's about the that you're here for this
S0530	yeah exactly yeah
S0530	don't see it as money though that's the worst thing
S0529	i know just oh cos i do see it as money when i drop out and that's the problem
S0530	mm yeah it do that's that's the downside it do become money when you leave
S0529	that's what i'm think about yeah i know what you mean
S0530	if you stay in though and swim
S0529	yeah it's fine and everyone treat you nicely and then you realize how shit it kind of be and people be always ask you for money it's terrify
S0530	i know they do make your life difficult if you leave
S0529	they do i'm just not sure i can do it and i don't think anyone's gonna convince me to stay like if i go to see a counsellor or whoever
S0530	mm
S0529	i don't they would try and convince me because by the way the way it sound you know it sound like i should probably not stay like in term of how i'm feel and whatever but but i don't wanna leave you know it wouldn't be good i just
S0530	i mean don't don't see people that say like you you believe that counsellors and people at work at uni want you to leave be a reason to go you know like don't see it as like oh well they should see they don't see any hope in me so why should i even try when they've meet you once or a couple of time and for me at the moment what be help me a bite like obviously it's not perfect but what be help me be i see this as something that i've get to kick in the face like i've never see it that way before but i've just see it as like a very negative part of myself but if you're like no gonna gonna do this gonna do this because like i just think like you get to the point where you get so like life become so crap like you just think what if i try what could go worse like what could get worse but it's absolutely your decision if you feel like it'll be best for you to like if you feel like you can't cope here and that it would do you distress to be here i would not want you to be like upset and distress and anxious all the time be here yeah
S0529	i mean i'd only say that if i felt like it be better at home like
S0530	you don't think it be
S0530	you just don't wanna be here
S0529	yeah
S0530	mm
S0529	don't wanna be anywhere to be honest if that's
S0530	yeah
S0529	stuff i can't say to my friends cos if i say i don't wanna be anyway they say get up it's just annoy
S0530	no i get you i get you
S0529	mm i just wish i care about it as well cos if i care about it then it would be another reason to
S0530	mm
S0529	you know fight for it i just don't i don't give a shit about english any more
S0530	mm yeah
S0529	i just don't care
S0530	do you just feel very distance for everything yeah
S0529	yeah
S0530	and i think because you've you've not be temping as well i think it's difficult to want to stay because you don't feel a part of the uni
S0529	yeah i don't feel a part of the uni at all
S0530	yeah
S0529	i just feel like i'm kind of live in this house and that's it i haven't be to campus since like
S0530	mm
S0529	enough time for the bus stop
S0530	maybe this week you could see as like literally give it one more go and maybe it would be a comfort then because if it doesn't work out for you then you'll know it doesn't work out then yeah i know it's so so hard so please don't feel like you should be upset be you okay because everyone go out for you cos you deserve it okay i promise honey you really deserve it you really deserve it to work out for you
S0529	i'm
S0530	i'm very grateful for you chum and it's just it's just shit isn't it basically but
S0529	yeah thank for say that cos that's just be more helpful than
S0530	a shit situation
S0529	yeah
S0530	because you be you can't really deny that it's cos i don't think there really be like one way to get out of it kind of thing
S0529	mm
S0530	like it's not like one thing be gonna fix it by do one i dunno try one way and do one thing and
S0529	i dunno what to do i i dunno whether to start take the fluoxetine that i bring with me because i haven't make another appointment because
S0530	mm
S0529	i've like i miss it but it it seem like it take kind of a while to get see properly and
S0530	mm
S0529	i mean they weren't they don't give me side effect or anything so
S0530	you could start do that like i don't know how dangerous it be to just start do it
S0529	yeah i know like that's the problem really i don't really know whether
S0530	i mean when be the last time you be on fluoxetine
S0529	mm oh age ago year
S0530	okay
S0529	i dunno i just i just feel like i need something to get me start this week and
S0530	mm
S0529	i know it's not gonna work that's the problem it just the more time the better with it really cos it take so long to work
S0530	you could try i mean potentially like even if like chemically it doesn't act for a while sometimes it can give you like a boost yeah placebo effect
S0529	placebo mm
S0530	and you might feel different
S0529	yeah
S0530	you never know you never know unless you try and then you can
S0529	i dunno but i wouldn't be able to get a a prescription if i just tell them oh yeah i've just be like take this just because it's in my house
S0530	oh god that's no yeah
S0529	cos i mean it be prescribe to me but it be like at the begin of the year and i stop use it way after that and it's not on my doctor's record so i start use it again so they wouldn't be able to
S0530	give you it
S0529	yeah
S0530	mm
S0529	probably i don't really know how it work but i mean i doubt it i don't know i think i i've get twenty two
S0530	twenty two so almost a month's supply
S0529	yeah i dunno
S0530	the doctor here aren't very quick be they and efficient with things i mean i think a medication would be good idea i mean not necessarily fluoxetine or the ones you've get here at least
S0529	no
S0530	at least not without medical stuff but
S0529	i mean cos i know i be say that i stop take them because they weren't work very well but it be only cos
S0530	but you didn't give it enough time yeah
S0529	it be in the first couple of weeks and i be feel suicidal during the day when i be on my own and i didn't feel like particularly like good with that i didn't feel like that be a good idea
S0530	mm
S0529	to be do that
S0530	mm
S0529	cos my mum like be at work so there be no way for her to you know erm so i stop take them for that reason but like otherwise they weren't you know affect me in any other way and that pass after a few weeks anyway so
S0530	you could try again
S0529	dunno yeah i just wanna feel like i'm do something active to
S0530	combat the
S0529	yeah
S0530	yeah
S0529	cos they do say to me get you some you know medication in in the next appointment but and i don't know how long it would take to get another one
S0530	be this at the medical practice down there
S0529	mm yeah
S0530	i mean you can book an appointment and it can i think it's within two weeks
S0529	yeah see that's just
S0530	it be if you book an well you could call it an emergency appointment
S0529	yeah that's what i that's what i do the first time that be what the other one be cos i wouldn't've get it so soon otherwise
S0530	mm
S0529	but then i have to go through like two different people to
S0530	get the medication
S0529	get an appointment
S0529	i i miss that appointment like oh well how be you anyway
S0530	no don't talk about me i'm fine
S0529	talk about you i wanna talk about you
S0530	have a bite of a er weekend but no
S0529	mm
S0530	for no particular reason just i don't know probably cos i forget to take my medication yesterday and the day before
S0529	tut tut
S0530	yeah which have probably make a difference but
S0529	might've do cos it it make more of a difference the longer you're on it doesn't it
S0530	mm yeah definitely
S0529	be you feel shit
S0530	not i think i've be i've be worse
S0529	mm
S0530	i think cos i i go out for a walk before which kind of make me feel a bite better but i'd just be in the house like all weekend like i be just so bore and i haven't do any work
S0529	yeah
S0530	which be make me like really tire and bore and stuff
S0529	yeah
S0530	but i think hopefully once this week get go like that's why i just i dunno i just don't like weekend
S0529	no they're shit here they're just different
S0530	mm
S0529	yeah weekend don't really mean anything to me anyway cos that last one didn't happen
S0530	no exactly
S0529	it be just another day but yeah i don't do anything special on weekend cos i suppose that's i'm not do special things up here anymore cos it's just i can't afford it anymore
S0530	mm
S0529	and i dunno what's go on on campus and i can't be bother to find out it's like it's too far
S0529	really there probably be stuff on but it's just
S0530	it feel quite far away
S0529	yeah it do yeah this week have be pretty crap
S0530	it'll be better i think when the flat's full again i don't know why i always feel a bite more cheerful when everyone's here
S0529	mm yeah so do i
S0530	no particular reason just cos and everyone else be all together so it's not like
S0529	mm
S0530	you feel cos it it do get very quiet in this flat when there's not many people here
S0529	it really do yeah be back yet
S0530	erm i don't think so
S0529	she probably won't be yet
S0530	she'll be back probably like
S0530	yeah
S0530	later on
S0529	yeah
S0530	i think i dunno
S0529	we need a lounge

S0530	mm
S0529	they're make a film of that
S0530	the yeah
S0529	oh do you know who i feel sorry for
S0530	i
S0529	erm jamie dornan cos i absolutely love him in this series on bbc call the fall
S0530	oh right
S0529	erm before he do fifty shade and i be just like oh my god don't do it it's just gonna ruin your life like look at robin robert pattinson and like what happen to his career and it's just so upset cos he's he's such a nice actor and he's so nice and now he's do fifty shade of grey and it's just very sad very very sad
S0530	it be a horrible franchise
S0529	it really be and like the obsession with split stuff into two like when harry potter do it and it just set the ball roll like everyone do it
S0530	yeah when they do
S0529	but
S0530	be they like the first people to do that part one part two
S0529	yeah yeah harry potter be the first one to do it
S0530	because of the book yeah
S0529	i mean that make sense though i that
S0530	because of the book yeah because the book be huge
S0529	yeah and i'm one of those people as well who kind of enjoy no i really like i really enjoy film that not much happen in like i'm not one for like action film so i actually really like the first film like better than the second part

S0530	mm
S0529	cos part two be just really over the top and they spend too long on the voldemort thing and it be all just really silly
S0530	mm
S0529	and the first part be nice and i really enjoy it
S0530	oh
S0529	but they just they just need to stop do it for money it's just like the worst thing ever
S0530	cos it's really obvious isn't it like

S0530	yeah
S0529	it's just they're not even be subtle about it any more like they use to say it be for like erm reason like so that the book would be more like realise but now it's just they're just do it for the sake of it
