S0037	so d'you think it's be warmer in here today like with the heat d'you think it's improve
S0115	uh
S0037	you know cos the boiler's be funny
S0115	well there's be a a bite of uh uncertainty i mean i but i look at the the dial of it and i realize
S0037	in the cupboard
S0115	yeah that you can i mean it it go it have that flame doesn't it which look a bite like like the symbol of the red flame it look a little bite like you know
S0037	yeah that's like a reset button though i think
S0115	you know the symbol of the flame on the on the dial at the top sort of twelve eleven o'clock on the dial there's like a red flame symbol
S0037	oh right oh i don't know
S0115	on the dial on the temperature dial
S0037	i hadn't notice
S0115	i i think you say that we weren't suppose to go past the flame
S0037	we're not suppose to go past that little mark have you see the little like pencil line
S0115	yeah that's what i mean like the flame thing
S0037	what flame
S0115	that's that's what it look to me like a flame the mark
S0037	oh it's just a bite of marker pen that the landlord put on there
S0115	yeah so say we we shouldn't need to go past that
S0037	cos he say we shouldn't go past that because it's hard water and then it like get clog in the pip or something
S0115	yeah if if it get too hot
S0037	if you put it on really high it make the water like more likely to
S0115	right i reckon that that might
S0037	which be probably what's happen anyway
S0115	it may be happen anyway yeah but uh well it have be quite hot uh um
S0037	i wasn't cold this morning or anything
S0115	it have be like the the the floor's be reasonably hot
S0037	yeah d'you think i should ring him then
S0115	uh we'll probably have to get in touch with i mean i could do a couple of experiment but
S0037	no well
S0115	uh i mean i could
S0037	i don't like the idea of the boiler just like blast away and then
S0115	well no i don't mean turn it really high i just mean just record what the temperature be in the room
S0037	yeah
S0115	if we do but actually i have i hadn't set that one on the right temperature though cos the room be a the room be all program accord to a reasonably complicate system actually where you
S0037	i aha yeah i know there's so many options
S0115	each we've get three room and each room have you can set the weekdays
S0037	i know
S0115	and you can set the weekend but uh
S0037	the wake and the wake and leave and return and sleep time
S0115	yeah include so a total of say like four per day different time
S0037	yeah
S0115	um and for the three room so there's a lot of different
S0037	i think you can add other ones as well if you want to
S0115	there's a lot of different ways that you can program these and and i'd sort of i'd only put the bedroom on to twenty one degrees
S0037	ah right so it wasn't
S0115	it wasn't program our bedroom wasn't program to do twenty two
S0037	aha
S0115	and i be complain that it hadn't do twenty two without actually realize that i didn't hadn't ask it to do twenty two but
S0037	ah i see
S0115	if you put this one here and the live room on twenty two for an hour it probably won't get there on the current settings
S0037	no but it use to though didn't it
S0115	i don't know
S0037	i think so
S0115	i don't know for certain
S0037	unless it be just warmer i mean
S0115	i don't know for certain i think it's partly the outdoor temperature as well so there be
S0037	it have be freeze it be so cold today
S0115	to be honest we we don't know for certain whether but i suppose in order to be in order to be sure we'd have to ask him but on the other hand yeah we should do the this be what my my point be we should we should do some test first
S0037	we need to do some empirical test yeah
S0115	uh cos it may just be the fact that it's colder outside uh and uh we may've put up with um twenty three degrees in the past
S0037	cos i can't remember what happen last year like i can't remember if it be freeze last
S0115	uh well we have a really cold um winter
S0037	do we have to put the boiler up do i turn the boiler up or not
S0115	i think we just crank we just crank the boiler up a bite higher
S0037	do we
S0115	and and just put up with that i i kind of suspect that it's just a combination of crank the boiler up and like i kind of suspect there isn't really anything that wrong with it but
S0037	okay
S0115	i think it might need bleed so i obviously take all of the stuff out of the way to check
S0037	yeah
S0115	and
S0037	i know i need to
S0115	there be there be the sort of two bleed hole there
S0037	yeah
S0115	but i suppose i wouldn't wanna bleed it myself
S0037	two bleed hole waay
S0115	well very very funny yeah
S0037	all that so i need to put that d'you think we should put that away then all those bits on the bed or d'you think we should leave them in case that he come suppose it depend if we're gonna ring him
S0115	well just we'll do the experiment and then
S0037	yeah
S0115	um and then uh we'll see what happen then uh
S0037	cos there's all those like
S0115	if if if if i put it on in this room to go to twenty two it probably wouldn't get up there on the current dial set but if i turn the dial up it might
S0037	no
S0115	so i don't know it
S0037	yeah
S0115	or the someone's gonna have to come round and unplug the pip at some point but uh
S0037	i know get some calgon in there or whatever
S0115	but it might it might make more sense for him to do for us to do that lot when we move out of here
S0037	well i dunno when that'll be
S0115	no
S0037	but um yeah so i mean we might need those those stuff that stuff out of the cupboard anyway like those sleep bag and stuff if if we're go to that thing at easter
S0115	yeah um
S0037	have you ask your mum about it yet
S0115	we no we be wait for um something we have to actually get a uh sort of schedule from the if we've go
S0037	will your mam not know
S0115	if we're yeah well we'll probably have to i need to find out when uh
S0037	cos your parent might not even be go do they not say something about go away or do that be that what they mean
S0115	yeah cos and go so many time a year and i don't know all the time that they go but i be hop to get some kind of plan cos i imagine they go at the bank the easter bank holiday
S0037	yeah
S0115	then they uh one of them and the when they start when they start the caravan cos they don't use at winter so they they have to sort of
S0037	oh yeah that's right it go to sleep i forget about that
S0115	yeah so in the in the sort of april one that they go at
S0037	yeah
S0115	they have to sort of wake it up
S0037	yeah
S0115	for the so they have to plug um do something with the pip uh
S0037	all the stuff in the electricity
S0115	then yeah um
S0037	i forget about that
S0115	then so they go then they go in april then they go uh a couple more time over the year so
S0037	in the summer in the summer holiday
S0115	yeah we probably just wanna find if you wanna to do it in april we'd have to find which weekend in april they be go
S0037	i'm not set i haven't get me heart set on that just if if that's like if that's gonna be a way of get to see people rather than christmas time then i think it's probably worth do so d'you think plus i like a bite of camp
S0115	yeah yeah um yeah i think we should go uh probably probably the the april one time's a a good one uh
S0037	it'll not be too cold though will it
S0115	uh well that it's hard to tell isn't it i mean i doubt it
S0037	be rainy wales be always rainy
S0115	uh yeah yeah yeah it can be it can be rainy out there
S0037	it's part of the fun though i suppose
S0115	but but with camp i suppose it yeah the the the wetness of it sort of you've get get around that by have a good tent or or whatever um
S0037	yeah and do do i show you me waterproof trousers
S0115	so so one of them's get a caravan so we can possibly hang hang around in their in their caravan
S0037	get warm i know but they've get all them dog
S0115	i know well you well uh
S0037	i'd be a bite scar
S0115	not sure if they've still get them
S0037	no but if your mam and dad's there
S0115	no more than two dog in
S0037	oh ben won't be able to go will he he's too old now
S0115	yeah so um that's a shame actually but their dog be probably get old as well so they
S0037	what be he call like or something
S0115	and he be brown uh that be his name
S0037	and be that what's her second
S0115	uh and
S0037	what's her second name
S0115	what
S0037	's second name
S0115	surname yeah
S0037	yeah
S0115	so he be actually yeah his name be actually
S0037	that's what i mean bash up all the other dog and that
S0115	um there's uh what
S0037	musta like be your dog like whitney
S0037	like the bodyguard
S0115	oh well there be uh there be what be her name with the black labrador uh who do that belong to that's 's dog the black labrador
S0037	or like um have a stupid name it have like seventeen name didn't it it be call like
S0115	oh i'm not sure about but uh
S0037	it have like twenty name
S0115	what be it there be lucky but no there be there be lucky be 's one before um
S0037	no that be um do it not not have like twenty five middle name the dog
S0115	the they always give them a lot of middle name but um i can't remember what his first name but anyway and then there be that's a black labrador and then there be my parents' dog which be a a cross
S0037	i know yeah
S0115	so yeah so we would be stay on the you know uh in a tent on that massive caravan site
S0037	but i think this time we should get like
S0115	in so hopefully we'd have to get a tent that be good enough uh to withstand all the difficult surround wetness of wales and uh
S0037	but i think we should like invest in more like camp gadgets this time you know more like grill and like hot you know things for cook
S0115	yeah probably we've gotta up
S0037	enter into the camp spirit
S0115	up a gear you know and go to a greater greater trouble to
S0037	or we could just do it ray mears style
S0115	yeah should uh
S0037	shoot ourselves a wild boar and
S0115	i dunno how um there be things that live around it that you could possibly
S0037	get ourselves a wild boar
S0115	um i don't i don't have a gun though so
S0037	fashion some cutlery out of a tree stump
S0115	d'you d'you uh how would you catch a a rabbit
S0037	a wild boar oh with great difficulty i i haven't get i'm bite trouble catch a cold me so i don't think i'm gonna get a wild boar
S0115	uh uh there won't be any wild boars but there might be a couple of rabbit or
S0037	on that programme they just shoot them didn't they
S0115	um yeah that be uh
S0037	maybe we'll get them
S0115	you talk about the gypsy programme
S0037	maybe this this weekend's turn into something quite different to just to a camp trip
S0115	yeah we don't wanna sort of
S0037	go back to nature
S0115	to go shoot everything
S0037	claire and matt back to nature
S0115	um so yeah but we're at sort of ray mears style might be might be good could could get a d'you wanna get a portable gas stave or something
S0037	d'you remember that ray mears yeah i think so d'you remember that ray mears thing
S0115	uh which one
S0037	somebody must i bet i know somebody who's get one we can borrow
S0115	d'you know one the one when ray mears do a roast hog or something
S0037	yeah and he spend like ray he spend so long make like a brush for his dress not for his roast things
S0115	yeah he put well he put the pig on the uh on a he make a spit roast out of some piece of wood which be easy to do
S0037	that's right yeah yeah stick essentially
S0115	uh two stick holders or they're call andirons or be they
S0037	be they really have you just make that up
S0115	they're things they're things that hold the stick
S0037	how on earth do you know that
S0115	they put ah it be a pub quiz question a while ago
S0037	andirons
S0115	they're the things on the uh
S0037	what pub quiz be that
S0115	the things you put on a fire and they have like a hand thing like that and they're sort of like
S0037	oh ah yeah like they rest the the stick the spit stick in
S0115	something like that anyway yeah but i don't know if they're always call andirons or if that isn't just the iron version they he make two side stick to hold it up and then
S0037	uhuh
S0115	sorry two ones that rest hold it up and then the the spit across the top
S0037	yeah
S0115	and he put his pig on the and he make a fire underneath
S0037	yeah
S0115	then he then he he set that go then he he think he'd make a brush to brush the pig with
S0037	no what be he brush on it
S0115	but while but while he be make the brush
S0037	he be put like honey he'd be like ferret around in like a bee's nest or something
S0115	he get uh he well he have these he have his glaze you know to put but while he be while he be uh he the pig be basically roast on the spit and he be spend about an hour maybe about an hour make this this wooden brush just to brush the pig like
S0037	yeah it'd be like
S0115	meanwhile the pig's totally burn and it and it he's he's get no sort of no glaze on it he could of just use his hand to put it on
S0037	aw cos you're suppose to turn it round and he be just like
S0115	yeah he be just spend all his time do uh
S0037	aw silly ray mears
S0115	do his uh with a wooden brush which didn't even work and it wasn't a proper brush it be just like a stick with like some hole in the end of it
