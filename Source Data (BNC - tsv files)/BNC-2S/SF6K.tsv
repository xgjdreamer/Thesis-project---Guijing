S0012	oh dear but it's just a fleet moment isn't it
S0013	mm
S0012	where you yeah god that oh dear yeah
S0013	panicky for a little while wasn't it
S0012	it be panicky for about two minutes but there you be that be twelve pound a pen and i have to buy a pen for me to sleep in
S0013	yeah so we've spend a lot of money over we wouldn't dream of spend that now
S0012	no i mean you're you're talk thirty thirty five years ago
S0013	yeah it be a lot of money wasn't it
S0012	it be yeah the only thing we didn't have to pay for be the park
S0013	yeah we get all get in free but i suppose that pay for half of it
S0012	we get in free yeah so that be it yeah yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	and now it's about twelve quid to park and twelve quid to get in each person well twelve quid to park and twelve quid each person to get in i i
S0013	it's more than that
S0012	yeah i think it's twenty five
S0013	it's double that i think
S0012	i think it's twenty five now
S0013	yeah it be
S0012	that's a wonder anyone go
S0013	yeah
S0012	still if you if you think how much we pay then it's all relevant isn't it
S0013	i guess so yeah
S0012	it must be
S0013	but not many people do go now really
S0012	well i don't know they have a hundred thousand last year
S0012	on on the thursday and about eighty thousand on the wednesday
S0013	yeah erm
S0012	and if they if it didn't pay they wouldn't have it would they
S0013	no they wouldn't they wouldn't get anyone go would they
S0012	no god i always remember when when we use to go to school because the school be on the a47 as well they use to give us two days off
S0013	yeah well they do up up here in the begin
S0012	yeah
S0013	we have two days everyone have two days off
S0012	and then they just have thursday off and now they get none
S0013	and now they don't mm i think they have do they have thursday off last last year i believe
S0012	i think they're allow thursday off i think
S0013	i think they do in the end because they realise that it be stop a lot of families go
S0012	yeah
S0013	yeah
S0012	otherwise they've get to get permission to get leave school now to take them out of school
S0013	not sure a lot of families have belong to farmers around here don't they
S0012	yeah of course they do the always use to go
S0013	yeah
S0012	god
S0013	that be a big get together for them they don't see anyone otherwise
S0012	well all the farmers have
S0013	bite remote job really isn't it
S0012	that use to make me laugh all the farmers use to get together there
S0013	yeah
S0012	and they use to go in the beer tent and
S0013	yeah
S0012	they use to have a wonderful time
S0013	probably don't see each other from year to year
S0012	no but i think now you see that's less less er popular because there's so much legislation about movement of cattle now isn't there cattle and cow
S0013	yeah they're still do it though
S0012	yeah but the legislation have go up a lot because of the foot and mouth that break out in the country about four or five years ago
S0013	oh yeah that destroy a lot of things didn't it
S0012	that destroy a lot of stuff
S0013	a lot of show be cancel weren't they
S0012	they be all cancel yeah and now because of that they have to they have to be well we have to have movement book anyway didn't we
S0013	yes
S0012	just where where we take them from
S0013	anyone who keep livestock will have to have movement book
S0012	yeah but that's that's more dense now if you like that's more sort of er strict it's a lot stricter now they've all get to be ear tag
S0013	yeah
S0012	everything have to be ear tag well we didn't have to ear tag them do we we they want they say we could have it have that
S0013	it be just come in wasn't it
S0012	it be then come in then yeah
S0013	mm i think if we'd keep go much more
S0012	yeah we'd have to be ear tag
S0013	yeah we'd all be tag
S0012	well you wouldn't have have to be ear tag or me but the goats would
S0013	yeah okay
S0012	anyway i think we better get on hadn't we
S0013	yep okay
S0012	otherwise the day will be go
S0013	yep we'll get on
