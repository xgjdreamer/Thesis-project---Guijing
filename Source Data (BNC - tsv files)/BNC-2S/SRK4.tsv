S0024	if i get a train position they start at forty grand i mean what train position start at grand yeah well what
S0144	train
S0024	like a trainee
S0144	yeah forty grand
S0024	bullshit today cos i look into do accountancy cos i use to be really good at number
S0144	well i think it's the contact he's get it depend who you
S0024	no i i don't think it's true
S0144	well he say his sister's walk into a job straight after uni and at forty or fifty grand or something
S0024	really
S0144	yeah but i'm sure that's through connections you know
S0024	yeah
S0144	there's no fuck way i'd be able to do that
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah live in a just a different world different connections different different outlook isn't it
S0024	yeah
S0144	he's get such hope and expectations in
S0024	excuse me
S0144	different place than i have i think i mean cos he's always talk about his mat and how successful they've be you know and like one of his
S0024	it's what he want isn't it
S0144	yeah it's what he want he's compare himself against them
S0024	mm
S0144	and so he feel like
S0024	it's like
S0144	he's not achieve
S0024	oh i see that's why
S0144	because all of his mat be multimillionaires
S0024	yeah oh that's really sad though
S0144	yeah i think so well cos he go like through like private school and
S0024	yeah
S0144	you know a very to do education
S0024	yeah
S0144	kind of and that's his peer
S0024	yeah
S0144	and you do kind of measure yourself against your peer a bite don't you
S0024	yeah you do yeah see
S0144	i mean
S0024	against my peer i feel like i've do quite well
S0144	yeah i mean everyone do i mean you have a quick look on facebook don't you
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	i mean i think everyone must do it
S0024	what people
S0144	i mean like
S0024	be do
S0144	click through that like er
S0024	but i don't know what
S0144	people you go to school with it's like ah ha ha look at them
S0024	yeah
S0144	everyone must do that i think it's a natural thing isn't it it's how you how you measure success maybe
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	cos you can't think globally in term of success cos it it's not not meaningful you have to kind of narrow it down into the some kind of social group that you can quantify and that you've have relations with that yeah be tell me about a er oh what be it when he be at er board school he oh it be one of his mat it be the champion league final or something and his mate say oh do you wanna come and watch it he be like well we haven't get ticket what be you talk about it's in germany or something he go oh yeah i i can get ticket like i've get you know mat in the sponsorship or whatever erm and i i'll just charter out of a private plane do you wanna go and like within a couple of hours they'd go to the airport hire out a private jet fly to i dunno munich or something
S0024	what
S0144	and go to the champion league final
S0024	oh my god
S0144	i mean that's the kind of life where you can't even imagine what it'd be like to have that much money you know
S0024	no
S0144	but that's you know he be rub shoulder with those kinds of people
S0024	yeah
S0144	and so i suppose he's try to aspire to be that i dunno
S0024	yeah well he must be though because i don't think this job be shit and i feel like i've work
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	mm i mean there be part of it that's a bite er
S0144	no i'm really happy with this job
S0024	yeah i'm happy with what i teach them too i feel like i'm er i be teach them the structure of essay and i be teach
S0144	yeah
S0024	i feel like i'm help them
S0144	yeah
S0024	but some people think that it's just
S0144	just a shitty dossy job
S0024	that it's shit and we're not teach them anything
S0144	yeah
S0024	that really really
S0144	i think it's what you make of it isn't it but
S0024	huh
S0144	it's what you put into it
S0024	yeah but then they all end up with the same grade anyway
S0144	yeah yeah yeah
S0024	because the mark scheme everybody get like they only fail if they're really shit they only get really great if they're all of the middle grind they all get fifty sixty percent er doesn't make any difference
S0144	well yeah no cos that's all education be it's just a money make scheme there's too much impetus on the teachers i think i'd say ninety percent of it come down to the student's motivation
S0024	no but i i feel like i i really help them
S0144	yeah yeah i do
S0024	by teach them different things that if if a teacher didn't bother with
S0144	yeah
S0024	then
S0144	yeah i feel like that
S0024	i don't understand
S0144	as well
S0024	why my students don't do better than those
S0144	i feel like that as well but then on the other side of that you've get things like what we be do the other week with er presentations show them bad examples you know where you've get i don't know grey write on dark grey write on a black background
S0024	and the students do exactly
S0144	and everyone in class when you be show that they be laugh go oh ha ha you know
S0024	yeah that's it
S0144	that's funny and then lo and behold when they give their presentations you've get fuck rainbows and yellow write and it's like what the fuck what have i be teach you i mean
S0024	yeah
S0144	that's just pure laziness on their i mean they could you grab me one
S0024	yeah bite sad isn't it
S0144	so i mean how much of what i'm say be actually go in or how much
S0024	yeah
S0144	be they just sit there go through the motion but not actually pay attention i dunno
S0024	they say to me that they be but then but
S0144	yeah some of them i mean some of them be really smart right
S0024	but the mark it's it's like the exams it's just a joke
S0144	yeah
S0024	it be a joke because even i'm gonna do it now sit there and work out exactly what people have get for their like be really careful about fifty sixty percent
S0144	yeah
S0024	if i be at uni i'd be gutted if i get fifty five but most of these kid be gonna get fifty five just because the markers can't be bother to
S0144	yeah
S0024	decide whether they'll get a sixty five there's a massive difference between a fifty five and a sixty five even the examiners go oh it doesn't matter it doesn't make an difference to them
S0144	well it doesn't in the sense that it's a foundation so it's not go towards any overall mark be it it's just get them on to the next year
S0024	well
S0144	any mark than that it's the top ten percent
S0024	yeah
S0144	who'll get the scholarships or maybe it's not top ten be it it's the top it's the top ten students or something
S0024	yeah but even the top even if they write something really well the examiner could disagree
S0144	yeah
S0024	and just too tire
S0144	well
S0024	too tire
S0144	there be such problems cos i mean i never give over seventy well i very rarely
S0024	mm
S0144	i think about seventy five be the highest i've give and
S0024	me too
S0144	you see some people and
S0024	very rarely
S0144	they're do like eighty five
S0024	yeah
S0144	that's a massive difference
S0024	yeah
S0144	and what's the difference between a seventy five and an eighty five it get really complicate and the same with the lower end as well what's the difference between twenty five and a thirty five
S0024	mm
S0144	that's not that's not clear at all
S0024	twenty five and thirty five well they just fail don't they
S0144	well they don't if they get thirty five they get put through anyway
S0024	mm yeah
S0144	so in effect if you've get people get twenty fives
S0024	be you record
S0144	yeah
S0144	well i just switch it on a bite earlier it's be alright hasn't it not a very interest conversation be it
