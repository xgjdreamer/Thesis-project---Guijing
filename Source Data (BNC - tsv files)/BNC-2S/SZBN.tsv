S0681	so i think we need to have a quick discussion about erm plan for both today and the next few days
S0679	yes what do you think you be go to do today
S0681	well i'm i'm quite keen to go on this open farm day erm and er and er be it it's about an hour away erm there be another farm about four miles away from the big tomato grow place it's open at four o'clock so i might go they open at ten eleven o'clock it close at four o'clock
S0679	mm oh okay i think four be a bite late to start i think they might be do cow or something different with that
S0681	erm well no no this be just tomatoes tomatoes this place you know it's a huge
S0679	the tomato place be ten to four
S0681	yeah and the main farm eleven no eleven to four and the main farm from eleven to five so there be another one an arable farm about four miles to go if we want to go to that now how do that hang with you
S0679	mm well i'd like to come but
S0681	i know there would be a but in there
S0679	well i would like to come very much i mean i've always want to get into and i think it's broadly similar
S0681	oh yeah
S0679	but if i do that i'm put myself under a heck of a lot of pressure and you might be able to do it but i'm not sure how much turn of speed i know i've get more energy than i've have but i just don't know if i can do it and i'm sorry not to come to keep you company and i'm sorry for me because i'm miss out on something i want to do and i think yesterday be a bite of a bummer of a day i manage to get some things do in the end but i couldn't really energise myself and have not sleep very well last night i'm a bite concern i might flake out when i get back
S0681	right okay
S0679	how do you feel about go on your own
S0681	well that's alright what i might do be i'm fairly certain she's not interest in go i might ring up because she's the great horticulturist so
S0679	she be a bite dismissive about go to a farm wasn't she
S0681	she be yes yes so that might i'll give her the option the other thing i've get to do today erm i've get to do this erm chase of all these people on the heidelberg trip but i'm gonna ring the guy who be normally the organiser and erm see if he's get the contact detail for this rather mysterious italian lady that's come with us the one where all my email be bounce because i'm obviously i'm not spell her name right but if i do that i can send her the email but then this even i'm gonna ring them all and see if they be interest and i might get a bite snappy because
S0679	oh yes well it would be useful if they know if they want to or not i mean you be not say they have to you just want to know don't you i mean there's not there's not a wrong decision there's not a wrong answer it's just not have a decision be awkward
S0681	yeah that's right yes as far a yeah
S0679	have you give up on your group discount
S0681	yeah i do i contact european rail and the group discount be not a you can't save any money you marginally save something on eurostar but nothing on german railways in fact i've get a cheaper fare on german railways go by a different route than they seem to be get be able to get
S0679	oh okay so what way do you think you're go now
S0681	well this will be down to london eurostar to paris across paris well cross it's only a few hundred yards
S0679	oh which station
S0681	you come into paris nord and go out of paris est and they be only a few hundred yards apart apparently accord to our source
S0679	nord nord oh because the first time i go to paris i have never well i have master the london underground but i think oh i don't know if i could manage do it so i get a map because i i understand map and roads even if i don't understand metros
S0681	well i've get map of paris
S0679	and i i and my then boyfriend walk across and i suppose we have luggage but whichever one we go to i think we go to be there a
S0681	yeah
S0679	because we be go down to which be in the south it's in the middle
S0681	but fine yeah
S0679	and it seem quite a long walk but i mean it be a doable walk because i have
S0681	no these people reckon it's literally three or four hundred yards
S0679	be you think of a wheelie case
S0681	oh yeah i'll be take a wheelie case even if it's only the small one but erm but the the the issue about that be there's a formal reception i will have to take at least one set of smart clothe you know
S0679	mm
S0681	erm so that's that's sort of today what be you do tomorrow
S0679	tomorrow well that rather everything i haven't do today basically
S0679	erm what i think i might do today you're promise me sunshine aren't you
S0681	well that's what the weather forecast yesterday say i'll check it in a few minutes
S0679	it's quite early yet it might it might erm
S0681	yeah it say by the middle of the day it be go to be twenty two degrees
S0679	well it be pretty warm by yesterday even i mean warm for an even
S0681	but brilliant sun as well the sky be still quite grey
S0679	yeah erm if i can i want to finish a bite of admin here which i just won't do for very long and i think between about ten and two i might try and go to
S0681	uhu
S0679	include travel
S0681	right i'm
S0679	and then come back and do some more admin and if i can do any paperwork tidy up all to the good with a view to do my wash in the late afternoon so to be out of your wash arena and then tomorrow set aside the whole day with think through what i need to take where and any extra time i get i can go i can continue fill up that recycle box i'm not short of things to do but i fear there may not be other time and i may have to pause that activity that's oh erm i might like to go to the the library as well tomorrow my only thoughts on the library tomorrow be that one of my book on its third renewal be erm due back on the twenty first so something have to happen and what i think i might do be if i can take the book in check it in and then if no one want it i'll check it out again if if i don't manage to do that be you au fait with that technique
S0681	mm right check it out again yeah okay oh yeah oh just
S0679	i'll tell you the other thing that's really important that might take a bite of time be i ought to write to hospital about my pain clinic appointments but i've get to get my head in the right space to do that because i don't want to become across as erm ms angry of
S0681	mm right on monday i'm i've get the i'm i'm do poetry so that will be finish at that'll be finish at half eleven so what i could do be come from there then come to if that's useful right it'll have to be it'll be indirect because i'll have to come via the park and ride because i'm go in on the park and ride but that's possible
S0679	mm well er the only thing i could mention be depend on what the weather be like a you don't want it too hot but you don't want it torrential storm you've get those tomatoes
S0681	tomatoes to put in yeah i don't want to leave them particularly in the car all the morning while i'm at poetry so you could if i package them you could take them in yeah
S0679	what only if i go over on monday
S0681	yeah yeah if you don't go on monday i will come back here pick them up and take them over because i need to get shoot of them effectively because they'll need one or two days of tlc while they be over there to bed in with lot of slug pellets
S0679	yes i'm afraid there's lot of
S0681	know your know your population of snail
S0679	if you ever need them when they be over there do you know where to find them
S0681	have you get some over there
S0679	yes
S0681	oh i didn't know you have
S0679	erm if you go into my utility room and look on the shelve there's erm it's like an ice not an ice cream container erm the one that have the clean powder in it it's get a label on that say slug pellets but just to give you an idea of what shape and it's if you stand up it's about there
S0681	yeah mm oh right so just above head height
S0679	yeah
S0681	right
S0679	i think it's on the shelf above where i keep the key
S0681	right tuesday erm when have i get to get you to the station
S0679	yeah erm we write in the diary the other day nine forty
S0681	leave here at nine forty right okay
S0679	because because earlier be better for you because then you you you need to drop me off and i have a little think about that actually because erm we can go to the disable car park and put use my blue badge and then you could walk me we could or we could
S0681	well that's that's not a problem mm ah but you might need your blue badge in
S0679	yes and then could you drive round if i wait outside the station could you drive round and drop off the
S0681	badge yeah that's possible
S0679	otherwise i do check the front of the station and there be some drop off space we could try for one of those but as a fall back option possibly do that oh you know we be talk about libraries
S0681	yeah yeah i know where they be yeah yeah i'm not under so much pressure from that don't forget because the venue have be of the exam have be move to rather than be in
S0679	oh right oh well you could drop me off at twenty past one then couldn't you
S0681	i could do yeah it's not a problem
S0679	erm i think you might want some lunch so that's what we try to factor in
S0681	oh that's not a problem i can dance around that whatever
S0679	oh you could go to the erm sandwich shop for old times' sake
S0681	yeah i don't think that one's open anymore be it
S0679	i don't know
S0681	i think i think the blue one be open but the old one be not open i don't think
S0679	erm if you go to tomorrow i'd like you to register my new prescription card at the chemist because if i go to with my prescription he i mean they they know of me they know of me and they just say don't worry about it but they be a bite funny in well they're a bite more particular i mean they be probably more correct because they've get this electronic system and things but i mean that mr be very nice
S0681	mm yeah that's not a problem yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well i've i've get plenty of time on monday afternoon in principle
S0679	yeah and that would enable me to have the card register there erm in case because it's always useful i don't know what they'd you you don't want to be there and them say go away you haven't get your card i don't know they would but
S0681	mm mm mm you be avoid the possibility of that
S0679	the thing i want to tell you that come through on my library news which i think be a bite shock erm because i always say how great our library service be one of the feature i very much like have go free reservations
S0681	oh be they go to start charge
S0679	a quid
S0681	yeah that's what they use to charge years ago
S0679	yes erm but i think the free reservations be the pay off for not give us a choice of very much choice of library book and they say in order to maintain service we have to charge you a pound it wasn't just target at me say because you have be overuse the service erm you can have i mean i i think it would be very encourage to say you can you can have your first fifty a year free or i don't know how many book should you read in a year
S0681	mm mm ten for the price of five yeah and that's too difficult program into the system
S0681	well i don't know but try to collect pound off everybody when you do things online it presumably isn't simple
S0681	well no it just go onto your account the same as your erm overdue charge doesn't it if a book go overdue you can log it in and it say you owe them money but you don't have to pay it then you can carry on take book in and out but at some stage it start block you and say give us the money and i'm sure that's how it will work because it's just an extension of that system then isn't it
S0679	right mm
S0681	and i'm sure that's the system they use to use
S0679	sometimes they don't make you pay the the fine immediately do they
S0681	no well that's your choice you can either pay immediately or defer it
S0679	yeah because erm i years and years ago when libraries be much friendlier place i take these library book back for erm er our person who be work as a caretaker you know we use to have students in and erm and i didn't and i forget to take them i take them in i get them say i would drop them in and i didn't for a couple of days and they go overdue and there be some fin to pay on them and er they say oh you don't have to pay if it's not your book if you be just return them but as this guy have go off to work in erm where his country he come from or his mother come from erm finland i think because er i think it be a bite mean to leave him with a fine as i have i'd engender the fine
S0681	mm it be your fault
S0679	yeah but they seem to think it be quite erm very good of me to pay the fine but if know if you say you be go to take a book it seem a bite mean not and he didn't come back to the country for a while but he do come back because he do his pgce in he like it up there because erm erm he like it up because er he be a mountaineer and he have more things to climb
S0681	yes mm in
S0679	well you can go out to all the
S0681	well i suppose you can go out to the peak district
S0679	i mean how far away be the and people be always shin up that i mean what have you get here the climb wall at
S0681	that's true well there's not much climb there be there unless you do horizontal climb yeah mm mm mm so do you know what what you've get in mind erm to do when you be at your sister's be you still gonna be clear out junk
S0679	who know well i don't know i mean the trouble be i i fear you know what i'm do at the moment with paperwork if it's junk it's quite easy to dispose of if it's old break and tatty it's when it's pretty good but not want replacement er not you know not replacement what the word be you know new rehoming rehoming be a more difficult scheme
S0681	mm yeah it take a lot more effort i think you can
S0679	for example these big speakers especially when they be things that take two people to move
S0681	mm well don't forget you could always contact if you would have to find the right one i know how to do it in the red cross for instance so phone them up and tell them you've get them they might well
S0679	oh i've get i've get a list of phone number of contact for like furniture but specialist equipment that be use that be heavy bulky and only use in certain situations probably by a particular sort of person i'm go to see how feel but erm i might well email because her husband erm partner husband i think erm he i don't he may have retire completely now but he use to have quite a good live be a bite retro go around to popstars and people of the older generation who still have record equipment that you couldn't you know he could mend it and do some of that so i don't know it's the right sort of era
S0681	yeah analogue equipment yeah yeah well that's that's a good source and the right sort of thing as well yeah but
S0679	yeah not quite not quite i mean i don't think they'll be play but i mean he i think i i speak to somebody and oh i think it might be actually and because she didn't have a contact but i have now get a contact another thing you have to send birthday card today she say if saw an email for that she probably wouldn't pass it on because she's have a heck of a job try to get wean him down because he's get really quite a big jukebox in the live room you know he's that sort of person and he erm he be go to get rid of his great big carp which be well most of the garden be a a a sort of shed thing to keep his carp in at i suppose at night time i don't know perhaps they stay in all day but you know big carp they need a lot of space to swim around
S0681	oh right yeah yeah oh yeah mm the remember the red cross be one of the few place that will take electrical equipment a lot of place won't because if they take it if they be gonna resell it they have to test it which mean quite a lot of extra work that's why a lot of the charity shop won't take electrical equipment but you know the big red cross shop in have get a lot of electrical equipment televisions video recorders and things like that
S0679	oh right i don't know mm mm mm also if you need to recycle stuff electrical stuff i i assume you could take it to
S0681	oh yeah you could take it there
S0679	but it say in the erm whatson in somewhere well one of these things we get news things possibly the library thing but it's a bite out of their sort of thing for them that they be do you can there's a date in july you can take it to park and ride and there's all over the all over the all over the county
S0681	oh be be this specific for electrical equipment
S0679	yeah
S0681	oh right okay you know it's not that charity again be it
S0679	no no they well i don't think it be
S0681	they get their finger burn because they end up with so much stuff
S0679	no no they they just didn't they they use to come round because they use to give the parish council some money for do it they use to advertise they use to collect it take it away but they say the price of scrap have go down to such a rate that it's just not viable they didn't say response be overwhelm because everybody find they have a garage full of rubbish
S0681	money yeah mm electrical rubbish they want to get rid of
S0679	but also when that happen they apparently allegedly didn't get everything they should do because somebody else come round in a white van and
S0681	help themselves
S0679	yes
S0681	yeah yeah
S0679	erm but i mean at the moment the the way they're write like you know you'd have to pay these people in white vans to take it away any way you look as though you need to hurry off now
S0681	mm yes
S0679	okay erm what time do you think you'll what's the earliest you might go out so we can liaise as necessary
S0681	about eleven o'clock i think
S0679	oh okay so er that's a little while yet isn't it
S0681	yeah i've get to make these phone call first to see if i can set up these contact
S0679	right catch up with you later then
S0681	right
