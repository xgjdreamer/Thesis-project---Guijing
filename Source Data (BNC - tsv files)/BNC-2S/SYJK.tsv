S0525	mm
S0622	some things that people could try but i wasn't really up to that standard so i
S0525	mm
S0622	i sort of

S0525	because they have to split it i you it'd be okay
S0622	mm
S0525	erm and we we'd just do a saturday or something instead and we'd change it but erm
S0622	yes yes well no problem accommodate but
S0525	no 's a bite of a nightmare
S0622	she's oh i couldn't
S0525	no you couldn't get on with her for long could you
S0622	not really no
S0525	we have a lucky escape when she want to go out to bulgaria that time with all of us that be the year that there be a problem on the site
S0622	oh yeah yeah
S0525	and contact me to say that all the villas have be repossess and she decide not to go in case the the bar wasn't open or the restaurant wasn't open but we'd never sort it well wouldn't wanna do it again now would she
S0622	no no
S0525	which be the main thing
S0622	but erm she oh small dose fine but er wouldn't want to as a choice i won't i would if er
S0525	oh she's
S0622	want us to but i wouldn't
S0525	she's hard i know she's hard work
S0525	well i've be ask about erm a christen i say be you gonna sort out a christen for we've get that cake in the freezer
S0622	mm oh yeah
S0525	and the woman who decorate her wed cake say if we contact her cake i think it be she'd she'd do the erm the christen one for free redecorate it which be nice
S0622	oh okay
S0525	although she never come to the wed cos we invite her but she have there be some issue on the night wasn't there some accident on the motorway or something happen with her and she couldn't get there
S0622	oh right
S0525	erm anyway
S0525	obviously know her from
S0622	be this the lady from
S0525	yeah work with her that's how she know her but i mean
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	the cake be gorgeous so anyway we've get the cake
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	in there i say you should organise this erm this christen not easter cos nan say she couldn't make it and er controversially we be talk about the guest list and the people who definitely wouldn't be on it would be which i don't think be a problem be you alright with that and co she she say no i wouldn't because it's 's christen so his aunties be and it's not
S0622	mm
S0525	they're like great aunties and uncles
S0525	remove
S0622	yeah yeah mm
S0525	now obviously that's a different story because they're involve all the time so we'd invite them
S0622	mm
S0525	say oh yeah i'd have to invite auntie because she's always involve and want to know and you just wouldn't not
S0622	right yeah yeah yeah
S0525	you wouldn't not invite auntie because she'd be upset
S0622	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	and that would be a bite of an issue and erm
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	you know cos i i be think back to when we get our kid christen er it be a small gather
S0622	small gather of people
S0525	i mean it be mainly your family go though and auntie and co didn't we with all of that lot but apart from that it be just erm er from my side because mum and dad never have any of their family there
S0622	no no no
S0525	it be just from our side and who be godparents with erm and er be obviously the parent to so be and it be just so you know the it be small but i er doesn't wanna invite because erm we're think of er
S0525	because there's probably gonna be at least thirty people when she add it add it up whereas we have about ten so i i'm think well it's er gonna be a lot here again it's always gonna fall to me it's always gonna be expensive so i say how about maybe have the conservatory at 's and go yeah i'd er i'd like that it's be refurbish at the moment but they're er open it again in erm april
S0622	might get a good deal
S0525	yeah so
S0622	probably
S0525	so go there and i say even if you're pay
S0525	i dunno eight ten pound a head for a buffet which you probably would
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	thirty people three hundred pound plus your venue hire go yeah i'd be happy to pay that she say we we could so to me that make much more sense than all come here especially if it's wet and you can't go outside it's too many people
S0622	mm
S0525	so i be happy with that but bear in mind then that we're pay you wouldn't wanna spend another fifty quid on 's family and i say no absolutely not so would you have an issue
S0622	well it'd be sad but i suppose
S0525	oh
S0622	whatever yeah
S0525	well but they don't they don't
S0622	but er but if that i mean yeah i know they don't but
S0525	but you know but
S0622	but i you know why because of her
S0525	yeah
S0622	erm yeah
S0525	er but you you know when be you there when take over or be it no you didn't go
S0622	no er no go
S0525	and say and she didn't
S0622	yeah
S0525	and she didn't even bother to look at the baby let alone pick him up the boys weren't bother
S0622	mm
S0525	it be just er you know erm
S0622	yeah
S0525	and
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	nobody else she say it's er they've er
S0622	yeah well er well yeah i know i know
S0525	and i think it's fair comment to say why cos i mean i be loathe to pay the money for the wed obviously a wedding's a bite different
S0622	yes yes yes yeah yes
S0525	and they be miserable at the wed i mean look how she behave at the wed
S0622	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0525	she behave appallingly at the wed
S0622	oh er yeah yeah yeah
S0525	so there's no way we should spend should fork out fifty quid doesn't wanna invite them it's 's do and so i'm just say now that
S0622	okay
S0525	you know to to well to because to be honest it's not really 's thing because
S0622	no no no
S0525	this be
S0622	and yeah yeah
S0525	and she's invite erm and
S0622	yes
S0525	to be godparents and be come and
S0622	yes yes yeah
S0525	it's not
S0622	i i know i know i know
S0525	an extend family thing
S0622	yeah
S0525	but she feel that always ask always want to see always you know
S0622	yes
S0525	which
S0622	make the effort to go round that sort of thing
S0525	yeah
S0622	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	so she because we're invite she wouldn't wanna exclude but she say i'm not invite
S0525	i say no i i don't want them there at all because they just make it difficult so i'm just say that be how it's gonna go
S0622	mm
S0525	obviously with a wed it would've be different and we couldn't exclude them but we can with this they won't even need to know it's happen but if your mum's gonna kick up a fuss then then they needn't come either and i decide
S0525	no er get no quite frankly oh i can't say well you can say it's happen if you wanna
S0525	if you feel really bad and you have to say it's happen they won't want to come
S0622	no no no
S0525	they will not want to come anyway so it's just
S0622	oh i think you're right
S0525	it'll mean make the effort to come down er she'd hate it buy him a present possibly er no they they wouldn't want to do it so it suit everybody so if your mum's a bite peeve well
S0525	we're certainly not invite you know all
S0622	oh yeah yeah
S0525	oh that fine you're okay with that
S0622	i wouldn't i wouldn't say i wouldn't say yeah
S0525	so er i think it'd be erm er mum from our side mum 's lot us and again your parent and and i we won't necessarily invite and it'll just be and
S0622	mm okay fine
S0525	cos they're they're off do their thing so those two your parent that's four on my side 's four and mum
S0622	yeah yeah fine
S0525	and us
S0622	yeah mm
S0525	erm and then she'd invite there'd be and and and 's boyfriend she think that would want but it's like me have so she's gonna leave that with if they get and and and 's expect now do you know that
S0622	think i overhead somebody say
S0525	and they get marry the year after them
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	erm
S0525	and
S0622	mm
S0525	but say you know you can forget 's brothers and sisters or that that judge she's not have any of that
S0622	no no no
S0525	they want and to be godparents and but she doesn't want and i say well it's a fair comment she go 's gonna kick up a fuss it doesn't matter i'm right behind you with that if it's and that's it
S0622	well won't wanna be he won't will he
S0525	well yeah yeah but 's gonna be why be you not have
S0622	oh
S0525	she's bind to 's right will kick up a fuss but we're all
S0622	well he have no
S0525	no we're all ready for it we're all and it's
S0622	right
S0525	not happen she's not marry to him you know it's not happen
S0622	right okay yeah
S0525	doesn't want him i'm fully behind her decision so
S0525	and they they wanna invite because he come round a lot and
S0622	yeah that's
S0525	ask about him and i say okay invite
S0622	yeah
S0525	so they're have their few friends then it's just family but
S0622	mm
S0525	so i think we add that to be about thirty people
S0622	so so be so invite and probably then possibly
S0525	's leave that with yeah er it's not 's choice but yeah she say erm possibly they will come
S0622	well what about erm what's the er what's the other what's the twin
S0525	well he wouldn't be much of a problem because it'd be him on his own cos he doesn't his family don't get on with anybody else so
S0622	oh right okay
S0525	so if they invite him i'm not i haven't really ask about that
S0525	but say no probably not it'll probably just be
S0622	mm
S0525	and and then and but and seem a bite of a
S0622	bite over the top
S0525	surplus to requirements to be honest but
S0622	mm well yeah
S0525	but say she she'd just let because we'd have and the boys she'd let say whether well it wouldn't be it'd be but the best
S0622	anyway up to them
S0525	the best news yes the best news be 's pay for that 's prepare
S0525	to lay that on at 's and er so i think well that that's good because i mean that shouldn't be down to us
S0622	no no no yeah
S0525	we've host everything else go on round here
S0622	oh no no they can er sort their christen out mm
S0525	erm but i'm just
S0622	their son
S0525	i'm just say now that and like i say er do you know there's no need to invite and but she would just because they show an interest but and forget it they're so they're so far remove i mean er 's a godmother but what do that mean to him nothing
S0622	no
S0525	so
S0525	well of course it doesn't
S0622	yes
S0525	and so it's not happen
S0622	right well it's up to them if they're organise it they can do what they want
S0525	yeah but you'll have to
S0622	pretty much
S0525	deal with the fallout from your parent
S0622	i'll just say didn't invite him
S0525	well yeah yeah exactly
S0525	i don't want i don't want him ring up and
S0525	your mum go oh well yes i'm sure you be invite

S0525	he have somebody in the car with him
S0622	didn't last long at work
S0525	well he have somebody with him and he be kind of er he be look around like this he didn't see us but
S0622	oh okay no
S0525	i wonder what he be do
S0622	whose car be you in 's be you
S0525	we be yeah
S0622	oh so he wouldn't probably
S0525	no he wouldn't've recognise 's car
S0622	's car no
S0525	no
S0622	obviously er taxi people around or whatever
S0525	i dunno what he be do
S0525	be you gonna get in touch with him
S0622	half the time
S0525	be you well what's gonna happen now with this proposition proposition of a job be you gonna get back in touch or leave it or
S0622	yeah well he's gonna sort the walk out after next week and then erm
S0525	oh
S0622	i'll i'll ask him if he's er
S0525	when be you gonna walk
S0622	if the job have be delay then possibly i'll be
S0525	well it be delay because it should've start in january
S0622	oh so now
S0525	so oh it so he say to me when i last saw him oh it's be delay six weeks so it's take him into march but let's face it we're into march in a week or so's time so
S0622	i'll when we get back yes well i don't see him and
S0525	who know but erm
S0622	on his sort of
S0525	i'm sure it well it's scotland so be it er be it that's too far where be they do it i can't remember
S0622	where's the job be er
S0525	i that's what i'm say
S0622	it be
S0525	somewhere in scotland
S0622	yeah oh yeah no i'm not sure if it's it's somewhere in scotland
S0525	that's they're have the pipe deliver up there cos we've have the pipe deliver erm down south before now
S0622	yeah
S0525	we've have it down on the south coast and then we've have it on erm on the east coast but this be right up north this one
S0622	oh okay
S0525	cos that's where the job be er well it's for so
S0622	fair enough make sense
S0525	it's miles away
S0622	mm
S0525	back of beyond some sort of desolate area i imagine
S0622	yes mm
S0525	it well you don't wanna take your own car up there because if you do end up go on site you'll be erm down some track on a road that's not properly build so you be best if if you end up do it to get him to hire you a car fly up and hire a car because
S0622	okay
S0525	you'd you you'd you'd wreck your er because these sit be in the middle of nowhere usually without roads to them
S0622	cos they're lie the lay the pipe
S0525	yeah
S0622	across country
S0525	yeah
S0622	right
S0525	yeah so you you know
S0622	but don't they deliver em deliver them to a
S0525	well yeah they've gotta deliver them in the wagons yeah
S0622	a yard or something
S0525	well that's half the problem because they say yeah yeah not a problem and of course the wagons can't get down the non existent roads so that's that's your first issue
S0622	oh right
S0525	then you've gotta oh yeah we have it all the time no trust me it'll be somewhere that's very remote
S0622	remote
S0525	that you don't wanna
S0622	inaccessible then
S0525	you don't wanna you don't wanna take the car
S0622	somebody hasn't somebody hasn't think about
S0525	no
S0622	how do we get the pipe to this
S0525	mm
S0622	remote spot
S0525	yeah they think about that once they've decide what they're do which of course be way too late then some bloke come along with a wagon we can't get it down here or they can get it onto site but they can't get it down the access roads lead to the site
S0525	or they've gotta go through some village where hgvs be not allow
S0622	oh okay mm
S0525	it's you know the the
S0622	there's a weight limit and you can't
S0525	oh yeah
S0622	too heavy
S0525	no you can't go through under bridge across under you know bridge over bridge
S0622	who's suppose
S0525	you can't do it
S0622	who's suppose to er
S0525	well we use to send up as a recce
S0622	sort all that out
S0525	we use to we use to spend send and do a route
S0622	oh okay
S0525	and we use to give the route to the it's their job as a transport company but they would never
S0525	take it on
S0525	they would just go on day one and say
S0525	er sorry we've hit a block can't go any further what do you want us to do so we use to send one of our people up to do a route
S0525	to make sure they could get there
S0622	yeah cos it's their their
S0525	well
S0622	job from
S0525	you'd think so
S0622	the port to the
S0525	they're do er yeah
S0622	right
S0525	oh it be everything's a nightmare the it it's run by men that's the problem
S0525	it be that be the problem
S0622	well thick men clearly
S0525	well men
S0622	thick men
S0525	they men
S0525	they just go back to this oh we've gotta get here oh computer say no
S0622	stupid
S0525	satnav say no can't do it can't do it and of course if the weather get bad and the roads get cut off oh you name it
S0622	yes
S0525	so you end up spend like i say sometimes a day on site and nothing get deliver or oh hurray the wagon's turn up and the crane break down you can't unload the crane then you've get the wagon driver moan swear blue murder because he need to be go in two hours and what's he gonna do you've gotta get you've gotta him off gotta get the pipe off somehow
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	well you you can't get it off the wagon so you
S0622	the crane be er 's presumably or the or who own the er
S0525	who er usually
S0622	the job
S0525	yeah the contractor quite often would hire a crane we've hire crane in the past obviously
S0525	at our cost
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	because it just get too much
S0622	mm
S0525	but you either have erm er a vehicle like a they call them hiab vehicles which have crane on the back of them so they can offload them but they're very expensive so you don't just transport pipe generally on hiabs you transport it on flat back wagons which be cheaper
S0622	yeah
S0525	especially with a job like this where you've get load and load go in
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	if you've just get four pip you'd have a hiab and it would do it all
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	but for this you'd have your flat back and they'd go in and you'd have a crane offload vehicle and 's very much into these erm suction crane they're good crane they've get like big suction pad like two suction pad
S0622	mm
S0525	and go and they suck the pipe up so even though it's like four tons the piece of pipe these two suction pad will hold it and they drop it
S0525	so you haven't get to lasso rope around the end of it
S0622	right okay
S0525	and do all that you've just gotta drop the suction pad on and er so they're much quicker but they just break down all the time but a lot of company now have them
S0525	especially the big contractors you know er erm that that's what they have they have these pip but of course once that's break and then the pipe doesn't unload and then you if you're on site as the guy for you'll need to record exactly how long that wagon sit around do nothing cos you generally get two hours to offload a wagon
S0622	right yeah
S0525	anything after two hours they call it demurrage
S0622	right
S0525	and you're into a demurrage charge and they'll charge that by the hour or
S0622	the transport company
S0525	yeah they charge that
S0622	oh right
S0525	by the hour or by the half hour
S0622	cos they're have to wait
S0525	yeah so er demurrage mean wait time
S0622	mm
S0525	so you'd need to clock cos they they go oh you be wait six hours you're you be wait two and a half hours you know so you you you've gotta clock those type of things as well
S0622	yeah
S0525	to make sure they're not clock that up because they they do that all the time
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	you need to get the driver to give you some sort of confirmation as well when he leave get time
S0525	because all that help with all the extra charge cos all those charge come in to us and never pass them on
S0622	no no do he pay em then without question
S0525	we just of course we do cos it's
S0525	i question it and say well you know er but because you go back to the site the site there's somebody on the site
S0525	they don't know they don't care that's not their cost
S0622	no no no
S0525	they're not interest in that that's nothing to do with them we're provide the transport we've say that we've agree the transport we're give them a deliver cost to site
S0622	mm
S0525	so they don't care if the wagon can't get there
S0622	mm
S0525	they don't care if it take the wagon three days
S0525	they don't care if the wagon sit there for three days
S0622	no as long as it's
S0525	but we
S0622	deliver on time
S0525	but we care so those be the sort of things that you have to try if you can to
S0622	mm
S0525	watch out for and the best thing be just to be friendly with them friendly with the drivers and you know yeah it's a nightmare you know but just get a bite of banter go and then oh listen mate can you just give me a sign sign that this be how long you've have to wait for and we'll accept the charge from your company yeah
S0622	mm
S0525	that's it
S0622	mm mm sure
S0525	but it's just a case of get on with them which be why we never send
S0525	cos
S0622	he'd be er
S0525	oh he's a nightmare
S0622	tell em they're late or tell them er
S0525	oh yeah he just get everybody's back up the minute he walk onto site
S0525	with his high vis and his hat and that's it and his mr md sign or whatever he be now
S0622	yes
S0525	and just start shout the odds and
S0622	oh yeah
S0525	i mean people aren't they're not interest these people aren't be pay enough to be interest
S0622	no
S0525	in listen to they don't care
S0622	he have a certain lack of tact don't he in anything he do
S0525	well if you do this job you'd have to put up with him
S0622	i'll see
S0525	just gotta let it ride off really
S0622	mm
S0525	like i say 's pay you 's your mate know exactly what 's like so it doesn't really matter whether you get on with or not
S0622	no
S0525	because at the other end of it you've get
S0622	mm all over
S0525	yes
S0525	he's never gonna fall out with you over this
S0622	ah we'll see what he come up with at the end of end of feb
S0525	well er
S0525	yeah but i i don't see how it's gonna work because it's gonna be like erm
S0525	it's gonna be eight ten week contract to get that sort of pipe deliver to site easily it's a four
S0622	
S0525	it's a four million well four million pound worth i i don't know erm twelve hundred mil pipe i imagine four on a wagon that that's what you say er if you say four on a wagon
S0622	four a wagon yeah that's what he say to me
S0525	it's gonna be either a thousand mil or twelve hundred mil pipe
S0622	right
S0525	erm i dunno erm it's gonna be a lot hundreds
S0525	yeah well when you think four pip on a wagon
S0622	right
S0525	there's er yeah you're gonna have weeks' worth of this it's gonna be a case of like go up on a monday come back on a friday nobody work much on a friday so they always finish by midday at the very latest on a friday but you you'd end up be up there so how would that
S0525	fit in with your other work that's the thing
S0622	i dunno
S0525	mm
S0622	it's er not it's not very er tax
S0525	no it isn't very tax it's bore because you're stand around you've gotta
S0525	well it won't be tax do do do do this
S0622	there so i'll be like
S0525	because literally you're you know you're look you've get four pipe number
S0622	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	on a delivery sheet and you've gotta make sure somebody sign that delivery sheet to say those number but
S0525	yeah but what well it what it won't have the number on the delivery sheet there's you'll have load of delivery sheet standard
S0622	mm
S0525	so you'll put the date on and the time and you'll write the pipe number on
S0622	right
S0525	and somebody will sign it but then what er you know what you'll get be the duplicate pipe number because they will be hard to read they will be the foreign number
S0622	right okay
S0525	i'll show you how they write the one and the seven and the four and the nine
S0622	mm
S0525	they're very very similar but if you're not sure
S0622	no you could er er er go back to this take a picture you could
S0525	yeah yeah of course if if you're not sure
S0622	you you could sign them er ask them
S0525	take a photo
S0622	to sign from the picture er that's what you've have mm and you've no question
S0525	yeah but you you you want the delivery note er
S0622	you can just transpose it onto a
S0525	because the the delivery note's the delivery note's you you still wanna write a delivery note
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	okay so you wanna go erm so if you've get the pipe number what so if you've if you've get your delivery note and you write your four pipe number your delivery note's get a unique number on it
S0622	mm
S0525	okay and a date so but it's but you'll you'll have several with the same date but it's get a unique number the delivery note
S0622	right
S0525	there's only one with that number on it zero five six two or whatever
S0622	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0525	erm so if you're not sure of them any number on it you take a you take a photo of the pipe and on your phone and you call it zero five six two or whatever that delivery note number
S0622	delivery note yeah yeah yeah
S0525	so and then somebody else can make their mind up what they think of it
S0622	yes yeah
S0525	i think i'd just take a photo for your backup to say
S0622	yes yes mm
S0525	these be my pipe number and and call them all that delivery note number
S0525	you know delivery note zero five six two pipe one zero five six two
S0622	mm mm
S0525	pipe two and just
S0622	yes yeah
S0525	take photos like that but you know there's er well i say there's there's no need it it be i would be amaze if if there's anybody there now because i'm not there actually record pipe number and check for duplicate
S0622	oh yeah yeah
S0525	none of them can work the spreadsheet so
S0622	no no
S0525	but i use to do that i use to get the delivery note in from write down their number
S0622	yeah
S0525	and at the end of every couple of days do a sort where you think woah okay we've have that pipe number three time be anybody else gonna spot it
S0622	mm
S0525	sometimes they don't
S0622	suppose they'd pay you for what they be suppose to have and that be it
S0525	yeah er they you know you've
S0622	but
S0525	you've sign for four number but
S0525	if somebody else decide to be a jobsworth or if somebody come in and say like we want cost cut what can you do
S0622	mm
S0525	that's what they'll go for
S0525	they'll go for something like that well hang on you've charge us for this delivery this pipe number on three delivery note we're pay for it once well
S0622	mm mm
S0525	they know they've have four pip on every single
S0622	yes yes and
S0525	it's not hard to count four one two three four
S0622	no
S0525	but it's it's that actual number that erm and that that number get put on when it's make then it get coat and at a factory probably in i dunno where they're do the coat if they're do it in turkey or holland and then they write that number back on
S0622	oh
S0525	so you've get somebody write it so a you've get some young guy who's not that bother who's earn you know a fiver an hour
S0622	mm mm
S0525	who maybe be dyslexic so he's not write it necessarily correctly
S0622	well
S0525	cos he's be tell it's this and he's you know so you've get that to deal with then you've get the fact that erm you get another process on it and it get coat over again and then it's get
S0622	cover over
S0525	well it do and then you've get
S0622	cos then it's
S0525	er the dirt
S0622	do that they then write the number on again
S0525	they they they write it on with some sort of paint or whatever but you've get somebody er be tell er that's this number come out it go in as this get coat so at the other end they're write the number back on
S0525	cos it's it's not
S0622	so i suppose along the way there's lot of
S0525	it's not it's not a stamp if it be like a big heat stamp in the no problem but it's not it's write on the outside of it and it's coat and it's line doesn't matter
S0525	where you put it
S0622	another er
S0525	so you've get you've get so that's erm
S0622	process that could get erm
S0525	yeah so it it could be wrong before it
S0622	wrong
S0525	before it leave the continent
S0622	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	in which case you've get no chance
S0622	flawless system
S0525	but the other thing at the end of the day you say to the customer right you order you know seven hundred pip you've get seven hundred pip
S0622	you've get seven hundred
S0525	alright so
S0622	yeah
S0525	there's be crossovers with the number due to blah blah blah
S0622	yeah so what you moan at
S0525	yeah
S0622	you've get seven hundred
S0525	yeah
S0622	pay for seven hundred
S0525	yeah
S0622	call it quit
S0525	yeah so as long as you
S0525	get a sign delivery note for four pip
S0622	yeah that's the that's the main thing
S0525	you know write the number on be important because it's to do with traceability like when we have the erm er the the erm and a section of it they they decide this section be fail or whatever well the first thing you do be look at the pipe number and those pipe number should all be traceable to a process first of all when they're line
S0622	right yeah
S0525	and when they're coat so it could be that there's a a particular batch
S0622	oh yeah
S0525	that be all faulty because there be something wrong with the line machine
S0525	they weren't line properly
S0622	number
S0525	or
S0525	even when the steel be spin spirally weld they spirally weld the steel on this thing
S0622	mm mm
S0525	so it all get trace back that pipe number trace it back trace the manufacture process back so if they
S0622	right
S0525	have one pipe go wrong or one pipe corrode
S0622	mm
S0525	then there should be a
S0622	you need the number off it
S0525	they need the number because then they can identify the entire batch that be produce in that process and they
S0622	right
S0525	so then they identify possible problems in the pipeline so it be
S0525	it's so that's why it's important
S0622	mm
S0525	cos it give them the traceability
S0622	well plus it's erm if they come up with a spurious number well we didn't provide you with that number pipe
S0525	yeah
S0622	so where you get that pipe from
S0525	yeah yeah
S0525	well yeah
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	yeah yeah yeah
S0622	and it it cover you as well as
S0525	yeah
S0622	obviously go back to the
S0525	yeah
S0622	manufacturers and say
S0525	yeah
S0525	but it it would be good to have a photo because if i could ever see the photo of the pipe number i could quite often pick out what number it should be just by know how they write the foreign number
S0622	write yeah yeah
S0525	whereas wouldn't pick it up
S0622	no no
S0525	and often wouldn't pick it up but you could think oh actually that's not a four that's a nine and he'd go oh oh i see what you mean you know you er
S0622	mm mm sure they do that though
S0525	they have a a weird way and the ones and the sevens they've always get well it's obvious because the ones they go like a seven
S0622	mm
S0525	but they don't put the line through it do they
S0622	line through it yeah
S0525	but but because they make a big thing of it like that it's just
S0622	they think it's a seven
S0525	yeah
S0622	yeah
S0525	but it's a one
S0622	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	that be the most common one all the time and you'd think well you've have that
S0525	so it be a bite erm it be a big tricky
S0622	mm good
S0525	but i think you will be away for a while if you end up do it
S0622	well we'll see
S0525	be good money though
S0525	cos you're
S0525	he he'd he'd pay you all day you're on site so if you get to site for eight in the morning and stay till six he's gonna pay you all day
S0525	even though quite often you'll be sit around with a flask of coffee wait for a wagon to turn up
S0622	mm
S0525	i bet before you know it he'll be train you on canusa he'll have you that'll be the next thing cos if you if you do it you've gotta be like yeah i'm hire from an agency erm you know i can give you a number of somebody that can help but
S0622	right yeah i don't wanna get involve
S0525	because if they're yeah if you they think you're all of a sudden oh right you're provide the canusa wrap on this so how do we how do we put this on the joint
S0622	mm
S0525	why be that not stick
S0622	yeah yeah i don't wanna
S0525	have you pre heat it to whatever degree have you
S0525	you'll have to call you'll have to call
S0622	yes

S0622	oh right
S0525	be like you will not believe what the weather be like up there and try to put canusa on in like a force twenty gale
S0525	on the edge of the sea say's well
S0525	it's all good train

S0525	he'd love to be back wouldn't he
S0525	yeah i know i know he'd love it
S0622	you know and get him to experience out in the the real world and er
S0525	yeah

S0525	come back and do it
S0622	yeah
S0525	i wouldn't be surprise i wouldn't say never to it but it you know if have get rid of erm and by that point
S0622	i reckon 's go to retire and probably go 'll go probably
S0525	oh yes they're i mean they're they're thick as thieve
S0622	mm
S0525	that pair and they're all old
S0622	yeah
S0525	why would they wanna work more than another five years they'll all be in their sixties by then
S0622	true
S0525	i'd go back if erm if be md and we have a proper crowd and i i'd go and start him off again and do another few years
S0622	and
S0525	be ideal
S0622	with go you'd go back wouldn't you mm
S0525	oh god yeah i mean get rid of all the wrong people he he do i mean we we should have there we should have erm there be a good move to go and obviously thank goodness he go
S0525	but no he he make the wrong decisions otherwise we'd all still be there it's a shame
S0622	mm
S0525	i wonder if will i suppose it depend if he stay round here it depend if he really like his next job he start it in march start of march
S0622	right
S0525	his new one
S0622	from home be it or something
S0525	be it be that what he say
S0622	from home yeah
S0525	mm it's a shame this one didn't work out really he's only be there six months hasn't he
S0622	mm
S0525	the thing be it be so easygoing with easygoing lay back and people would achieve you know we achieve a lot in that environment because nobody slack because only a few of us everybody be more than happy to pull their weight work the extra hours put in the extra time because er we all get the reward from it
S0622	mm
S0525	and then suddenly with and i mean when come fine cos i do the account and didn't get on with me cos he would always moan
S0525	but get in you know after a couple of years they just become like a little gang didn't they and
S0622	mm
S0525	pull the wool over 's eye and just suck our company dry and could see there be no future
S0622	mm mm
S0525	well that's a real shame cos he have a lot of you know potential there and it be perfect for him be down the road from and kid and have the flexibility to go and do it i mean i i doubt he get that sort of flexibility with any other job just
S0622	oh no
S0525	i need to go i need to pick up from nursery or i need to do this or 's get a
S0622	mm
S0525	hospital appointment and they'd drop off in the office
S0622	mm mm
S0525	and 'd go off to the doctor's and come in and pick him up an hour later and we'd all have him you know you don't you you don't get that
S0622	normally no that be true
S0525	but be so good like that because everybody pull their weight because they just appreciate that and it's a shame
S0622	yes that be the upside obviously quite a few downsides but
S0525	well only only after and
S0622	mm well the way that erm erm work as well not good be it
S0525	oh well no but you can put up with

S0525	who give you that number
S0622	erm it be
S0525	
S0622	no i think it be erm who's the who's the other electrical people down there
S0525	dunno
S0622	er can't remember what they're call now
S0525	oh what down on erm down by
S0622	yeah n n it begin with a n i think
S0525	dunno
S0622	n e something
S0525	dunno
S0622	or something anyway
S0525	
S0622	that's right
S0525	oh
S0622	yeah yeah
S0525	oh right okay
S0622	yeah yeah they erm
S0525	god we use to use those when i work for at
S0622	mm
S0622	he say oh the these the we get our the dimmer light those those from these people you may wanna
S0525	oh right
S0622	cos i think er all these
S0525	they're just salesmen
S0622	supply em and sell em
S0525	they're not electricians
S0622	they just they don't really know much about them
S0525	mm alright then
S0622	so i'm gonna ring em but er it's definitely about the number of bulbs we've get but
S0525	well it can't be
S0622	but they
S0525	because all ours be under the limit
S0622	well no no what i'm say be er because the the value of the bulbs it's because we've get two more bulbs than it can cope with whether they're whatever erm
S0525	oh
S0622	wattage they be so i dunno why cos yeah they're under the limit
S0525	well there there must be a switch you can buy that cop with it
S0622	er i presume so but i er i dunno
S0525	they call them different name don't they trail dimmer and something else
S0622	anyway if i ask they might be able to er
S0525	well see if you can find out
S0622	okey dokey mm so that's that's the next step
S0525	alright i still think we should just try a new switch
S0622	well we might have to if they say look you need one of these switch
S0525	mm alright then
S0622	might have to
S0525	well
S0622	but i don't think it's worth buy another one we've have two already and
