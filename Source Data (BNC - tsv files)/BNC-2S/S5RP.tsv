S0180	never teach in like a place like that
S0070	sometimes there be students
S0180	yeah sometimes with the students i mean i have one really keen italian guy who turn up three weeks in a row but when it become apparent that there be no one else come

S0180	he didn't mind one to one but i mean erm
S0070	it's a different lesson it's a you know you
S0180	yeah
S0070	you can prepare a one to one lesson that's fine but you don't know if it's gonna be a one to one lesson or a group of ten
S0180	it's different no exactly exactly
S0180	it's just a shame but erm
S0070	it be a shame but then didn't help either he be
S0180	no hopeless
S0070	a meddler
S0180	not interest
S0070	not interest and and at the same time a meddler
S0180	yeah
S0070	pain in the arse but they've do something with the paths round here haven't they
S0180	it look yeah they've cordoned it cordoned it off with rope
S0070	yeah
S0180	it look it look a bite more
S0070	and these must be new over there
S0180	maybe they're try to protect the grass more stop them all
S0070	yeah maybe
S0180	use paths like a lot of paths which be
S0070	yeah
S0180	unofficial
S0070	maybe some
S0180	but there's a lot more growth i mean all that all that all those leave you could see the wall before
S0070	oh yeah
S0180	you can't see the wall cos it that's that's summer growth
S0070	be that a lime tree be that
S0180	be it a lime tree
S0070	i dunno yeah then they grow like
S0180	confuse with why do they call it a lime tree it's not a lime tree be it it's not the fruit
S0070	no no
S0180	so what what do they call a lime tree then
S0070	i dunno
S0180	lime tree go on
S0070	must be like an cos they're native tree so it must be an olde olde olde word i reckon
S0180	right yeah probably
S0070	don't know and we can look that up later
S0180	there's no squirrels in but i tell you the er my two visitors
S0180	fascinate by squirrels we go
S0070	yeah
S0180	through park but i take them through the park because there be a beautiful view of london from the top there
S0070	oh okay
S0180	they weren't interest in the view could see big ben london eye you know the things you'd think
S0070	weren't they
S0180	visitors
S0070	alright
S0180	to london would be interest in
S0180	they be just fascinate by these little squirrels
S0070	yeah
S0180	and they be take picture of them videos of them and and the cos in china you wouldn't have them run round they'd be eat
S0070	yeah
S0180	it's true
S0070	i mean they
S0180	they'd be in someone's pot
S0070	they have something on the news last night about some pandas that have be pandas or they've inseminate a panda up in scotland or somewhere
S0180	oh yeah
S0070	and erm and so what what be the panda thing in china then have they eat all them as well
S0180	well no they exist in sichuan province in the
S0070	right
S0180	bamboo forest but they don't mate very well in the wild so so
S0070	even
S0180	so that's why and they use them for
S0070	so even if it be in china they'd still
S0180	no
S0070	oh
S0180	i mean chris packham you know that funny er naturalist he say oh let the panda die out he say they should've
S0180	a naturalist he's a conservationist
S0070	a like a like a language death sort of thing
S0180	he say he say yeah you should let let let it have a natural death sort of thing
S0070	oh okay
S0180	but i mean erm i mean in
S0070	but
S0180	some ways like if they're really mat and they have the opportunity to do so
S0070	if they can't be bother to reproduce
S0180	they can't be bother mat it's true isn't it bite like several teachers
S0180	the students can't be bother what be you do
S0070	yeah
S0180	jump up and down like a maniac but
S0180	the pandas can't be bother
S0070	i dunno
S0180	it's they're bizarre animals though they really be
S0070	mm mm what be they be they they're just pandas they're not bear be they
S0180	bear they're a type of bear
S0070	be they oh
S0180	yeah cos the chinese word for panda be erm cat bear
S0070	uhu
S0070	okay
S0180	cat bear so i dunno what it doesn't it's not really agile like a cat so er
S0070	it's odd isn't it
S0180	i don't know why they call them cat bear
S0070	they sleep a lot
S0180	yeah basically
S0070	mm have they get other bear there
S0180	i think they do i mean there be some nice have you see that bbc programme wild china
S0070	wild china i've see
S0180	there be
S0070	a few of them
S0180	very nice areas where there be still wildlife you know where they
S0070	mm mm
S0180	tend to be remote and things
S0070	oh
S0180	i remember go outside the town i be teach in in the countryside look for wildlife
S0070	right
S0180	i be there be just like sort of the nuclear landscape be like the soil be red dust it be dry there be tree you know and bush but i saw this sort of erm really sick look hedgehog sort of try and make its way across the field and it look as though it have be like you know cake in dust and it be it look like it be about to die basically and then that's the only wildlife i saw in this supposedly rural area
S0070	and and this be why because of industry or
S0180	over farm use of fertilisers soil pollution be a huge problem in china
S0070	five hundred time round the
S0180	yeah maybe he's work locally
S0070	yeah
S0180	lunchtime jog yeah so erm
S0070	oh yeah because i remember watch there be a documentary a few couple of years ago about some guy who be do face transplant
S0180	really
S0070	and there be yeah there be a chinese there be a guy in the east of east of west of china who'd get attack by a bear hit across the face
S0180	oh no
S0070	mm get ambush or something
S0180	wow yeah they do exist in the
S0070	yeah yeah big bear
S0180	deep forest i suppose yeah i mean most of the chinese population be concentrate in a very small area
S0070	mm
S0180	and most of china be like tibet and xinjiang and these big provinces to the west which be not inhabit so much and desert and mountains so
S0070	mm
S0180	most of the population be sort of squash into
S0180	one third of the country the other two thirds
S0070	right
S0180	be very sparsely populate
S0070	uhu
S0180	so that's why it feel even more crowd when you go to the populate part of china cos it's
S0070	i bet yeah
S0180	one billion people but not not spread out
S0070	mm
S0180	you know
S0070	yeah talk of tibet i ask another girl i meet on the plane and ask
S0180	catch a pigeon
S0070	oh really
S0180	boy's catch a pigeon what be he do bite of animal cruelty isn't it i be hop he'd trip up on the rope
S0070	it's a bite
S0180	things students do eh
S0070	oh it's so funny
S0180	look like the class clown doesn't he not
S0180	it's like his head's be wedge down a loo and flush
S0070	be he the one that have the pigeon
S0180	yeah what a twat that's a bite cruel actually you shouldn't do hope he's hope the pigeon's alright what nationality do you think they be must be italian dunno
S0070	something like that i should imagine she doesn't look very happy do she
S0180	oh dear yeah no you be say
S0070	tibet yeah the the the the the girl i ask cos i sort of say oh you know she say i would like to travel somewhere and i say oh where would you like to go and she say tibet and i say can i ask you a question i say what what for you where be tibet and then her reply be i love my country
S0180	and 's chinese
S0070	mm
S0180	yeah
S0070	and then i say
S0070	that
S0180	that's the that's just one of the standard phrase that get oh
S0070	and then i probe her a bite bite deeper and she say erm that she she she embarrass by by friends there erm she say what do she say something about i can't remember anyway it's part of china let's
S0180	yeah
S0070	let's not discuss politics
S0180	i mean yeah i mean if it be then fine but they should have like a federal system i mean there there be intellectuals who've argue for a federal system
S0070	mm
S0180	and they've be under house arrest for years now
S0070	okay
S0180	yeah i mean there be lot of people in china who would respect it more you know er but the official line be it's you know like well it be invade in nineteen forty nine you know it be
S0070	mm hm
S0180	they do invade and take it over cos it be a ambiguous situation but it doesn't mean they'll tell you it's be part of china for centuries well no they be a vassal state and they pay tribute to the emperors
S0070	uhu okay
S0180	but they be their own country you know
S0070	mm
S0180	but the people's republic incorporate it
S0070	this
S0180	as as xinjiang as well where east turkestan independence movement be grow yeah
S0070	kick yeah
S0180	kick off
S0070	yeah
S0180	because they they be be you know disrespect by the state you know
S0070	i and and and that yeah that that could be a bite of a
S0180	well they're very heavy hand the chinese government so they'll do things like in one town in the far west of xinjiang they've ban people from with beard from get on bus
S0180	no this other no but the thing be if you're gonna have a terrorist they're not gonna get on
S0070	i suppose not
S0180	be they with a full beard and they're not gonna look like a you know
S0070	like that yeah
S0180	what most people think like do you know what i mean
S0070	yeah
S0180	it's like it's a very naïve approach to take to
S0070	right
S0180	anti terrorism so what they're do be they're alienate the bulk of the population who
S0070	okay yeah
S0180	who that's just their culture
S0070	mm
S0180	and they're not terrorists
S0070	terrorists
S0180	that's just the this be the this be the thing
S0070	jihadists
S0180	so that's the so it's like a sledge their response be always sledgehammer to crack a nut
S0070	right
S0180	and that's what rub them the wrong way with the local people
S0180	and they they never learn not to erm they haven't get that intercultural sort of erm approach to you know diplomacy or politics which
S0180	be lack in the
S0070	mm
S0180	i dunno
S0070	well that's what i mean that girl surprise me because i think she would be
S0070	she's a bite more kind of
S0070	liberal but er
S0180	no i mean
S0070	it's the
S0180	the younger generation don't know very much at all about if they do they keep it quiet and they
S0070	mm yeah and she be say she be she she be read she say to me a few months ago she be read a a a her her her daughter's ten years old and she be read a bedtime story and i say oh what you read five thousand years of history
S0180	oh god you're joke yeah
S0180	cos that that get drum
S0070	bedtime read
S0180	that get drum into them like some sort of
S0070	think
S0180	you know
S0070	she's gonna sort of be read some nice you know child story or chang'e
S0180	i i well the i always say be well everyone have five thousand years of history it's just
S0070	mm mm
S0180	what they mean be continuous history and and or political but then you know that's
S0070	oh i know
S0180	it's always contentious you know it's all a load of bollocks
S0070	it's a load of bollocks
S0180	i mean people will they do that because they're insecure you know about their nation and you know and they do have a chip on their shoulder about well the problem with china be that they've get a chip on their shoulder about how britain treat it in the opium war but they have absolutely no sensitivity when it come to other countries' experience of as well you know or so it's like get a bear with a sore head a bite like russia can be you know like the oh i'm always the victim but no one else ever be and that's the classic sort of victim mentality isn't it
S0070	mm
S0180	people nor nations i think erm some students but others don't think deeply i don't think but it's like funny you know like my friend and his wife say oh have you come back teach or something i dunno i say aha secretly i be i didn't tell them it might hurt them i say well four things would need to happen pollution would need to improve you need to have political reform freedom of speech and freedom of erm assembly whatever without those things i think i'm gonna back you can't get twitter or facebook or anything like that can you
S0070	no no it's crazy isn't it
S0180	even south korea's be ban and the and my friend say oh that's because
S0070	yeah
S0180	the government doesn't want competition i say no
S0070	no
S0180	it's a political thing they don't want people to they don't they want control of how people communicate
S0070	yeah
S0180	and that's what it's about in these days no matter how much they dress it up
S0070	mm
S0180	and they can well
S0070	so be that what they say they don't want the competition
S0180	the party be very clever they'll always dress it up in nationalist term cos that's their last refuge to appeal to the chinese people they say oh we're protect you because you're chinese yeah or we're protect the film industry because we want chinese film or you know we don't want to
S0070	oh yeah
S0180	and then and then you can always turn it around and say well hang on a minute in uk and all the other countries we can access chinese websites
S0070	mm mm
S0180	baidu and all those place so you know you can't have it one way and not the other they'll always dress it up in national term so that they're not the their legitimacy
S0070	okay
S0180	be still there so that
S0180	and they get support from a lot of simple think people well it's quite a dangerous situation in that sense you know erm so glaxosmithkline beecham their western representative be arrest recently
S0070	be he
S0180	and er yeah and the government in china's be target foreign company to make examples of them put them you know on trial and
S0070	er
S0180	spy and espionage and
S0070	er
S0180	there's a lot of cold war stuff go on still
S0070	ah
S0180	so i wouldn't feel comfortable go to teach there not not in this stage at you know since i be there essentially it's become worse
S0070	well it sound yeah yeah
S0070	and the this kid there's one student lad i be teach there and he want me to send over download some google thing and send it to him because the government have stop all the people
S0180	really yeah yeah
S0070	oh
S0180	well my friend's quite open mind he's he go to waterstones and buy a lot of book in english about china
S0070	mm
S0180	political book he's go to take back and read so
S0070	free
S0180	he have get a mind of his own
S0070	so where be they now still in paris
S0180	in paris that's why i say to him have paris syndrome cos i think they have that
S0070	no it's crazy
S0180	they go to montmartre which be a a very historical area
S0070	yeah
S0180	but because of their their experience be hassle by trinket sellers they probably think oh this be not very nice and they're in paris they're head to germany i think
S0070	and they're still there
S0070	where in germany be they go
S0180	frankfurt and berlin
S0070	why frankfurt
S0180	i dunno it's the it's the financial capital but it's not i don't think it's that particularly pretty
S0070	no that's what i think be it the financial capital then be it
S0180	i'd rather go to munich yeah
S0070	yeah yeah yeah munich's a nice little place little place do i say little place it be a little place and it's nice
S0180	i mean i don't know why they're go there but then they're very brave they they they haven't book in advance they're just go on train and youth hostelling and
S0070	oh okay
S0180	you know very independent but erm yeah really first day they arrive they're oh culture shock in paris and i think i say i look up paris syndrome and it say for japanese tourists
S0070	oh
S0180	they have
S0070	mm
S0180	paris syndrome where they arrive and because it's not like how they see it in the movies or tv in japan they they get a shock
S0070	doo doo doo doo
S0180	and some of them have to go back on the plane and i read that in the paper but i be amaze
S0070	well
S0180	it's funny isn't it cos travel be all about expectation
S0070	mm hm
S0180	but if you have no expectations you you're quite pleasantly surprise sometimes with what you find
S0070	yeah
S0180	if you have such weird high expectations of a place
S0070	but then again paris probably
S0180	you know
S0070	yeah i be talk about it to and you know paris probably trade on that doesn't it i suppose you know this idea that you know it's a it doesn't have to do anything we've get this image and
S0180	yeah
S0070	everyone come to see it bollocks if it's not there
S0180	but i think people compare it now to other cities and then they might lose out because
S0070	mm
S0180	word of mouth get around they think oh it's not as nice as er london or
S0070	yeah
S0180	lisbon or wherever
S0070	mm mm
S0180	so people might say well if you have time oh don't bother go to paris
S0070	don't bother go to paris
S0180	think there's that danger now because erm and and and he doesn't speak french so i don't know how he get on order food and things cos they apparently they can be quite funny
S0070	yeah that's what people say
S0180	the paris
S0070	but i've always find them to be and there's a new sort of younger generation of people there who be kind of
S0180	yeah yeah
S0070	probably
S0180	they don't care about that no no you're right you're right
S0070	no no no
S0180	and there's so many french people in london
S0070	yeah exactly and and london and that connection between london and paris be see as a a thing of business and
S0180	yeah yeah yeah yeah it's
S0070	opportunity so why would you sort of be an arrogant fool and pretend you can't speak english just so that
S0180	oh no
S0070	you for pride or whatever i dunno
S0180	cos the other side of the coin be we use to go there speak french and they they don't speak to you cos you're not speak perfect french but
S0070	no i just try and be polite
S0180	i think might be change
S0070	erm you know i'm sure
S0180	i haven't be there for years
S0070	yeah quite like paris
S0180	i'd like to go to france again soon cos it will practise french you know i haven't practise it in years
S0070	yeah oh yeah do you wanna go erm some point we can do erm go to the battlefields or something like that
S0180	oh right yeah no that would be nice
S0070	interest i've never see any of those kind of
S0180	i know world war one
S0070	or as it's that
S0180	yeah i know definitely
S0180	might be might be this year but
S0070	it will be interest though yeah yeah
S0180	definitely in the future no yeah definitely no that would be a nice trip actually
S0070	cos i'm sure wouldn't be that interest
S0180	no
S0070	into that so
S0180	that's the thing you have different interest don't you as a couple
S0070	yeah no and i'm glad about that you know i remember a friend of mine say about oh so what interest do you share then cos you know but
S0180	you don't have to
S0070	but no and i say well i'm quite happy that we have different interest she go out with her
S0180	yeah
S0070	her friends and do her things and i go out and do my things
S0180	exactly
S0070	yeah and we do things together
S0180	yeah
S0180	that's the way it should be
S0070	yeah her mat
S0180	conversations yeah everything's go on and
S0070	yeah everything together yeah oh can i come out with your friends my friends go on get your own friends
S0180	yeah i know i don't particularly like
S0180	my wife's friends
S0070	no oh yeah that's it yeah yeah
S0070	you gotta sit there and er er
S0180	couple of them be very nice but the things they talk about i'm not
S0070	yeah you're not interest be you
S0180	really into don't mind host dinners and things you know for friends and
S0070	yeah
S0180	but not to go out specifically to meet them
S0070	don't go out
S0180	it's cos that's when problems occur when you're force to do everything together
S0070	yeah
S0180	i don't think you should be
S0070	and i think that you should
S0180	you need your space
S0070	yeah yeah and allow them to talk the way they talk and to be the way they be do what they wanna do
S0180	exactly exactly
S0180	cos would be bore if i
S0180	you know if we sort of meet and talk about
S0070	yeah
S0180	tefl and stuff
S0070	yeah yeah yeah
S0180	no it's well i've always find that funny as well what's what's people's concept of be marry that they don't
S0070	it's that bloke again
S0180	oh yeah
S0070	where do he go i dunno
S0180	maybe he's do er tavistock as well
S0070	maybe
S0180	those shirt be very hot actually aren't they
S0070	i've never erm
S0180	i don't find them very cool to wear
S0070	i've never erm they're like they're like what be that material
S0180	football yeah erm they're horrible
S0070	yeah
S0180	what you wanna wear be sort of like a loose cotton thing but those things you can't
S0070	those you sweat like a
S0180	yeah
S0070	sweaty thing
S0180	i dunno why i mind you i don't know maybe the technology's move on the shirt now they could be quite cool to wear but erm
S0070	cool as in temperature
S0180	yeah
S0180	even if if it's hot so when be west ham move to olympic stadium then
S0070	season after next
S0180	after so not even next season
S0070	not even next so the the scam go at the moment be
S0180	that's a long way
S0070	if you buy a season ticket this year you'll have priority on the last on the final season at boleyn at you know the boleyn grind
S0180	you don't need priority there'll be hundreds of seat empty it's a massive stadium
S0070	well you see what they reckon they're gonna do be every match be gonna have a theme to it so next season be gonna be a
S0180	what dress up as crocodiles or
S0070	well i dunno er yeah what kind of theme the the the fact be the team be still gonna be the same and the team be gonna be shit
S0180	they're try to distract from that aren't they that's what it be about
S0070	i think that's what it's all about be that
S0180	what do they mean theme
S0070	i dunno er each match be gonna be theme and then if you have a a ticket
S0180	like what bring bring your own wine or something
S0070	i dunno bring your own tomatoes to throw
S0070	and then and then and then if you have a ticket for that that season you'll be on a priority list for the season after in the new stadium which be what eighty thousand seater they're not gonna sell that out in a hurry be they if they have a diabolical couple of season which be highly likely
S0070	mm i dunno but they be gonna
S0180	that's weird isn't it
S0070	but apparently they're gonna be theme but erm
S0180	how strange yeah i dunno you so you're not gonna miss the season ticket then
S0070	no i couldn't afford it it be a bite erm
S0180	it's expensive isn't it
S0070	it's expensive to watch a pile of muppets run round do nothing
S0180	yeah
S0070	you know and it yeah
S0180	so they're not famed for like luton be famed for like a good pass game when they play well they've always do a very good pass game
S0070	they they since sam allardyce have have join erm they they've they've start a little song which erm we're west ham we run with the ball cos you know
S0070	west he's sam be big sam's famous for his long ball game isn't he
S0180	oh i see okay
S0070	so you know the fan react to that say we we're west ham we run with the ball but erm then again if england they be play nice little triangles the other day
S0180	oh yeah
S0070	just in front of their own goal and i say to the guy next to me
S0180	just for the sake of it
S0070	it'd be nice if they yeah exactly you know oh look oh look we can pass but
S0180	the ball doesn't really move up the pitch
S0070	no no
S0070	if it be in front of the opponents' goal then maybe that's good but no in front of your own goal doesn't mean anything do it
S0070	there's a pass look we're keep the ball yeah but keep the ball go anywhere no
S0180	so be upton park or whatever it's call
S0070	boleyn grind
S0180	boleyn grind
S0070	upton park
S0180	be it be it nice a nice stadium or
S0070	it's a nice sort of you know one of those stadiums where you're here and there's the pitch
S0180	right
S0070	you know and you get a smack in the face with the ball and that sort of thing
S0180	be the stand comfortable
S0070	and
S0180	be it nice
S0070	i go to one
S0180	historical
S0070	yeah yeah it's a nice little grind
S0180	be the grind victorian or be er art deco or be it like arsenal's highbury use to be or what sort of period
S0070	not as grand as highbury
S0180	no
S0070	it's no i don't think it's as it's no it's as
S0180	any any architecture
S0070	no it's a bite
S0180	so they might knock the whole thing down and
S0070	i would imagine they would
S0180	build something there
S0070	yeah there's no nice facades that they would keep
S0180	cos highbury they keep the heritage architecture be the art deco
S0070	yeah yeah no that's a nice build
S0180	main stand that be beautiful
S0070	yeah
S0180	and then the middle be flats very clever
S0070	mm mm mm no west ham doesn't really have anything like that but it'd be interest when they move and they because i reckon they're save money to and and they're not gonna buy any real big players until they until they've move cos they can't afford it i don't think
S0180	that's a long so they won't that's a bite strange the stadium won't be ready until season after next
S0070	i don't know no isn't didn't you say there's some athletics go on there or something
S0180	oh yeah the world championships
S0070	so perhaps they're wait till after that
S0180	ah the world championships be twenty seventeen
S0070	oh be it oh perhaps they no i don't know perhaps they've get to do the seat or something i don't know make change it so that
S0180	or they'll make it so that the it's retractable stand
S0070	it's retractable isn't it
S0180	stand already isn't it
S0070	mm be it already
S0180	i think or maybe not maybe that's what they have to work on
S0070	maybe that's what they're do
S0180	god it's very hot isn't it
S0070	it be in the sun
S0180	it's intense
S0070	oh yeah
S0180	oh yeah so erm there's still a lot of these be language students cos the most of the term have break up haven't they
S0070	yeah yeah
S0180	wouldn't be university students here unless they've come from pre sessional that's the other thing i need to almost go round with flyers and grab students to like for my study it's terrible
S0070	oh okay
S0180	even the pilot but this be the problem nowadays even my pilot study i've send it to colleagues in the linguistics department
S0070	uhu
S0180	only one person reply
S0070	really
S0180	so this be people who know me or a know of me
S0070	yeah
S0180	and they're not even bother to reply and the my supervisor have the same problem so it's try to get strangers
S0180	to take part in your main study can you imagine
S0070	never gonna happen
S0180	i think research be all research out isn't it people don't seem to want to take part in and the problem be with my online questionnaire it's it's longish they need to write a lot so
S0070	okay
S0180	to have any value
S0070	yes yes yes yeah yeah and like a lot of things people probably don't wanna be bother with stuff do they what's that crazy horse do over there
S0180	i think that's t'ai chi i think
S0070	i well i be wonder if it be t'ai chi it look more like something she's make up
S0070	see a bite of t'ai chi
S0180	it's not bad though i suppose should be do it in the shade perhaps
S0070	yeah erm yeah like this one they're pay us eighteen quid that's probably the incentive to do it really be it
S0070	although i've get an interest corpora at the moment cos that's part of
S0180	have you
S0070	well that's part of my argument for erm course book design really
S0180	oh be it part of your study
S0070	well not this but yeah
S0180	ah
S0070	in general corpora and be
S0180	and how be your write go
S0070	well it be alright it be bite it be a bite slow last week last last week or the week before but that be i think go away and then come back and be a bite disruptive
S0180	oh yeah how be devon
S0070	lovely lovely
S0180	like my dad's still down there in cos
S0070	still
S0180	yeah they have to get scaffolders for the house because it's fall down or have some problems with rot so it's it's quite a serious problem
S0070	this be not where you live while you be there no you live next
S0180	no my dad my parent buy a house a small house in
S0070	okay
S0180	it be like a little holiday home they're one of the londoners who out price locals and
S0070	bloody hell bugger
S0180	yeah sorry my parent be one of those people
S0070	mind you when do they buy it
S0180	well everyone who live there live from work in anyway they're probably you know
S0070	right yeah yeah and to be honest 's one of those place where yeah there's nothing go on anyway so everyone have to live in work in
S0180	well exactly exactly yeah yeah yeah
S0070	so you're do them a favour by buy stuff
S0180	cos the well exactly cos the bus to quite expensive and if that's your daily commute it's not easy travel in rural areas of you don't have a car isn't it

S0180	well
S0070	they're chinese speak aren't they
S0180	well if they be then they could be taiwanese
S0070	okay
S0180	cos that's more the american diet
S0070	aha
S0180	fast food stuff and but you'd find yeah i think or japanese but it's but i think you diabetes and blood there's a lot of salt put in food
S0070	right
S0180	there be this wonderful stand up comedian from china she be make a joke about people from shandong province
S0070	uhu
S0180	and she say food be just a vessel for salt for these people so they just put salt in everything
S0180	and she say when you see people you see people do drug in shandong like a line of coke they're not do drug she they
S0070	they're do
S0180	they're do salt
S0070	salt
S0180	it's
S0180	but it's true i have a student from shandong he come to my flat to cook for me one day
S0070	uhu
S0180	and he put i keep say to him do not put salt in the food because you put like three tablespoons of salt in everything and i think that part of the world
S0070	where's south of beijing
S0180	the yeah south but on the east coast
S0070	yeah
S0180	but they as their diet
S0070	maybe that's where that girl's from
S0180	match western diet they're gonna have diabetes and high blood pressure problems like you won't believe cos they the salt intake in food be huge people people do sweat a lot cos of the summer heat but so some salt be good cos it stop you lose
S0070	okay
S0180	erm liquid but most people there put i would say put far too much salt
S0070	right wow
