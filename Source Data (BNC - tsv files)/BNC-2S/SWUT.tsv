S0208	be alright oh it's quite lovely out here actually
S0202	yeah
S0208	it's a nice temperature
S0202	i might have toothache
S0208	oh
S0202	cos i'm eat on that side all time cos i'm i'm sick of get stuff stick in that one
S0208	yeah mm i find one of those little brush i be tell you about remember the ones i use to get food out for
S0202	yeah
S0208	when i have my brace it's in the erm toothbrush pot in the bathroom
S0202	mm
S0208	just give the tip a little wash
S0202	yeah
S0208	but i wash it every time i've use it anyway and that's really good because it's so thin
S0202	yeah
S0208	with the long handle you can
S0202	get in there
S0208	get in there ah it sound really lame but i'm really look forward to when we get back and like all of our stuff's be move in i'm really look forward to look through all my toiletries and then go on a shop
S0202	yeah
S0208	for what i need get all my cream and all my shampoo
S0202	yeah
S0208	cos i know i know
S0202	i
S0208	i have like shampoo and stuff leave over but it's in a bag somewhere
S0202	yeah i must admit i'm look forward to like get my stuff in
S0208	i know
S0202	and like move in properly
S0208	it's i'm get so excite now that it's get closer
S0202	yeah me too
S0208	like it feel more real cos like i'm so nervous about how the first part's gonna pan out but i be exactly the same this year i i use to walk around with a map of the campus and i would check where every single erm thing be before i'd leave so i know where i be go
S0202	yeah
S0208	but cos i'm quite a panicky person as you know but at least that's do it's just like get the bus and stuff but i reckon the first few trip if you're up for it we should go in together
S0202	mm
S0208	like hopefully we'll have roughly the same timetable but if you start a little bite earlier than me then i'll come in with you and i'll just hang around then at least the first few time then we're not make the journey alone
S0202	get some work do
S0208	yeah exactly
S0202	just get some work do like when you're there do some read like
S0208	and then at least we're not do the journey alone
S0202	cos er my days be pretty full like my whole week be pretty full my timetable like i go from one lecture to another blah blah erm and but the in some of them i'll have gap so in them gap i have i'm just gonna go to the library
S0208	mm
S0202	and just do the read that i need to do
S0208	i'm go to do that as well
S0202	i'm gonna have like a strict schedule next year of read and i'm gonna fuck do it cos this year i do no read whatsoever and i really like struggle
S0208	but it's gonna be easier for us to do that because think about it you can't just walk home
S0202	no
S0208	and there's no point get a bus in a few time a day that'll be expensive before we get bus pass and stuff
S0202	yeah
S0208	and time consume so i reckon that hopefully my timetable will be a little bite better this year as in like it won't just be hours here and there because first semester be awful i mean i be literally there be some days when i be in for just an hour
S0202	yeah it's stupid innit
S0208	whereas second semester be really good because i get two days off but the three days that be in be be like practically full
S0202	yeah
S0208	so i'm hop it's gonna be a bite more like that now so that i can go in for a whole day and not have to go in for halve and stuff
S0202	yeah
S0208	like 's timetable be absolutely perfect like she's in full time two days a week full full time like
S0202	yeah
S0208	from nine o'clock in the morning till five o'clock at night
S0202	mm
S0208	like school but that mean that she doesn't go in for nothing
S0202	yeah
S0208	and i i want it to be like that but i'm gonna go to the library way more
S0202	yeah me too
S0208	to do my work and stuff have to try and find my student card
S0202	how much do you get deduct from your rent then for your deposit
S0208	er twenty something quid
S0202	be that it
S0208	yeah i get a hundred and seventy something back i think a hundred and seventy one so not much at all but i think that be just for the burn mark that be in the chair cos to be honest nothing be damage and it
S0202	they must have clean it
S0208	they obviously clean it like do say that they be gonna clean it and i wouldn't lose any money and from that side of things i haven't but the
S0202	yeah
S0208	burn mark on chair like even though i wasn't in that flat and it's not my fault it's you know i'm not gonna
S0202	it would the it'd be a hassle like
S0208	i'm not gonna go to everyone and say like give me ten pound each or like a fiver each or something that's ridiculous
S0202	yeah
S0208	it's twenty something quid but
S0202	well we're not gonna have that problem this year so
S0208	no once i get my next bite of rent sort i'm gonna sort my finance out once you leave with my dad and stuff
S0202	yeah
S0208	so that i can get it set up until my student loan come in with cos i'm gonna pay the rent every month
S0202	yeah
S0208	i think that'll be much easier for me to do erm and then once i know how much money i've get i'm gonna make a budget and then give my dad back the exact amount that hundred and seventy one pound cos he cos i didn't have my loan obviously when i have to put the deposit down he pay for it and he say it's not a problem that he doesn't want it back but i tell him from the start that he be gonna get that back so
S0202	yeah you're not give him the two full the full two hundred
S0208	well he doesn't want it
S0202	oh okay
S0208	cos it get deduct but i mean if i can then i will
S0202	mm
S0208	i'm gonna have a look at how much money i have i might just pay him in like little instalments
S0202	mm
S0208	and he can take it out of my euros that i have
S0202	how much euros have you get save up now like
S0208	four hundred and something
S0202	oh that's good
S0208	yeah but that's gonna go towards a cost of live
S0202	mm
S0208	like for september that's gonna go towards my rent so i have enough to pay september erm and then what's leave i'll use that extra one hundred as live off until my student loan come through
S0202	yeah well your student loan come back come in the day after you land in england so you won't be wait long for it
S0208	exactly erm cos then with the student loan i'll be able to get through october and november and probably december and still have enough to live with
S0202	yeah
S0208	and then i think i'm just gonna work it out with my dad that i've get some money in my french account that he say he'll push over to me and then once the money start come through from the french student finance what i'm gonna do be i'm gonna get him to transfer me just a bite over from the french account that i need for rent
S0202	yeah
S0208	and then use my student loan to like to live off
S0202	mm
S0208	so my french money's gonna pay for rent hopefully
S0202	just remember that it three hundred and ninety one pound and three pence or something ridiculous like that come out at the twenty second of every month
S0208	i'm gonna get my dad to
S0202	so you need to remember
S0208	always transfer four hundred
S0202	yeah
S0208	cos then that's exactly for rent
S0202	yeah
S0208	and then i can use my student loan myself
S0202	yeah
S0208	but i'm gonna give the student finance a ring erm probably not today but tomorrow
S0202	it's an 0845 number it's gonna cost you fortune from here
S0208	no no the er french one
S0202	oh the french one okay
S0208	yeah just to make sure that everything be intact because erm 's get a few email from them since this summer but the email that i get he only just receive
S0202	right okay
S0208	so i just wanna make sure that because i'm not live in france and stuff they might have just send me the email straight away of confirmation and i'm not gonna get any other email cos i'm not live in france
S0202	yeah
S0208	i'm hop that's the case because if if they me out of that money again cos last year i lose out on a few thousand i won't be able to survive the year if i don't get the french money though that's for damn sure i mean i have a little bite save up but that four hundred or whatever be not gonna last long
S0202	yeah well it's one month's rent innit
S0208	exactly it's not even money to live off
S0202	you should talk to finance as well
S0208	give them a ring when i get back to england
S0202	mm like or uni
S0208	yeah i'm gonna have a look at any kind of help that i can get though because
S0202	well ring them before you leave because it's a house er number anyway so it'll be free
S0208	mm
S0202	so ring you when you sort your finance out with your dad
S0208	yeah i'll do all of that with my dad i'll take a day out to do that
S0202	mm
S0208	as long as i do get the money from france though i know everything will be fine
S0202	yeah
S0208	it's just the stress of if that doesn't happen cos i know that my dad will always be there to help me but he's not in a position where he physically can
S0202	yeah
S0208	and i know that he would but i don't wanna put my parent in that position where they have to live off less because i don't have enough money
S0202	mm
S0208	that's not fair i don't wanna do that
S0202	yeah
S0208	but if worse come to worse i'll just get myself a part time job
S0202	yeah
S0208	and i'll live off that
S0202	you're get the full whack from student finance this year aren't you
S0208	yep
S0202	it's just under eight grand half of that'll pay your rent
S0208	i'm only get twenty quid more than i do last year though
S0202	yeah
S0208	yeah cos i be practically at the maximum last year but it be only twenty quid difference this year
S0202	it's inflation though it's go up a little bite
S0208	so
S0202	have you look at have you look at how much you're actually get like have you get the
S0208	yeah yeah
S0202	yeah
S0208	seven thousand eight hundred and something
S0202	yeah nearly eight grand
S0208	yeah
S0202	but rent's cheaper this year by about four or five hundred quid
S0208	yeah exactly so the money that i be save from the cost of rent be go towards a
S0202	live
S0208	bus pass
S0202	bus pass yeah
S0208	erm just really really need this french money so i need to ring and check that it's all alright but i have i've get my save from my grandad if worst come to worse but if i be get the french money then i'm not gonna touch that
S0202	yeah you don't want to yeah
S0208	cos you know i might need it in the third year i might need it towards get a placement or something
S0202	mm thing be if you get a if you do a placement year you get pay for it anyway normally if you get a industry place
S0208	yeah rather than a voluntary work yeah
S0202	yeah
S0208	so hopefully
S0202	and you do get pay for it
S0208	it'll all be alright
S0202	you normally get about fifteen grand to twenty grand a year so
S0208	yeah but i'm think about just do three months
S0202	yeah
S0208	erm cos yeah i don't really wanna be abroad for that long
S0202	well you don't have to be abroad to do a
S0208	no i know but
S0202	placement
S0208	i don't wanna do it in england
S0202	right okay
S0208	i want to put it well i want to take advantage sort of be able to go abroad without have to worry about every single part of finance
S0202	mm
S0208	so hop it will all sort itself out and once i've get it down on paper as well
S0202	mm
S0208	figure it out but i
S0202	shall we go back in then
S0208	yeah
