S0509	yeah
S0510	and then she's put it's definitely your bike because it's get a rack and a spring saddle
S0509	how do she know that from go past on a bus
S0510	on a bus well i don't know
S0509	yeah
S0510	i know i know you kind of get all these suspicions don't you
S0509	yeah but then
S0510	but i really think it's it be she have genuinely just see it
S0509	yeah
S0510	cos you know what i be like as well when i be on the bus the next day i know it be my bike so it be personal to me
S0509	yeah
S0510	but i be literally watch every bike
S0509	but you be look at every bike yeah
S0510	that go past and sometimes the story engage somebody doesn't it you know
S0509	yeah yeah yeah
S0510	and so there's
S0509	be it like on the corner as well
S0510	it be right on the corner
S0509	it might have be like go round so she have a little moment to look
S0510	bite of time to exactly yes no you're you're spot on it be right on the corner of the road she be go down so she be probably view it as she be come down
S0509	right yeah
S0510	she have a bite of time
S0509	yeah
S0510	erm and so it but it be weird cos it be almost like it be advertise itself you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	so then one of the school nurse saw this and she put she tag me and then she tag all these other ladies at work say help someone get text you know
S0510	and then say i'm on it and and then she texted me but she follow it up with a phone call straight away and that be the phone call that you hear when just before i leave
S0509	yeah
S0510	so she say you know they think they've find it erm what be you do i say ah i'm just about to run for the bus and she say look i'll give you five minutes to gather your thoughts but i think ought to go up there in the car i can give you a lift i'll call you back in five minutes
S0509	my god
S0510	so so i'd run to the bus stop at the end of the road she call me and she be like you know it's be post so you know therefore other people be gonna see
S0509	mm
S0510	that it's there as well you what be you where be you okay i'll come and pick you up i'm in my pyjamas but i'll just jump in the car
S0509	dedication man dedication
S0510	oh my god it be such a mission so erm we're on the way up we're like erm you know possibilities well
S0509	yeah
S0510	i be say well she say she think it's my bike but i'm not so sure because she's put it's get a bike rack and a spring saddle but she's mention nothing about the rust
S0510	ah then we be like drive along and
S0509	what if we need pliers or whatever
S0510	yeah yeah like oh it's like what if it's lock up i be go well well we'll just call the police because i've report it to the police
S0509	yeah
S0510	it's get a crime number and erm and then it be like why would why would somebody kind of go and leave it in a really prominent place
S0509	yeah
S0510	after they've take the trouble to steal it and be say well maybe it be just to get them from a to b maybe they just need to get up there and i be go yeah but who would wanna cycle all the
S0509	steal a bike to do that
S0510	to cycle all the way up that bloom hill and then i go oh maybe that's it they get up the hill get half way and think sod this for a lark and leave it there
S0510	you know what that hill have and how long it go on for
S0509	yeah yeah
S0510	maybe you know but then actually that that doesn't quite work out cos whoever steal it would have have to have bolt cutters and so they would have specifically go out for plan plan it you know
S0509	yeah they would have plan
S0510	erm because of the type of lock it be they would have have to have do and erm but then you see so we we're go up the road and like all these different scenarios what what could be happen be it still there will it be the one
S0509	yeah
S0510	we're come along the road and i can just as we're about to turn into this road i can see the back of it and i say it's definitely mine it's definitely mine oh my gosh oh my gosh like this
S0510	and like we don't know whether there's gonna be somebody there or or what you know
S0509	oh my gosh
S0510	and er but we turn the corner and there's nobody there we're look actually although we've go through all this council estate the road that it's sort of park on the end of you look at the house it's actually quite a nice little area there in in that road
S0509	yeah
S0510	and erm it's like somebody could just be pop into the house you know erm so 's like right okay you get out of the car grab the bike erm cos we could see that it wasn't lock or anything grab the bike i'll just turn around and we'll come back round i'll come back round and course we be think of put it in the back of her car
S0509	yeah
S0510	so i jump out i'm like ah it it look alright kind of thing she's pull back round it's like we're not gonna get it in your car be we it's just too small so she's go right she say er just just run it up and down the road make sure you can cycle it and then we'll just get out of here sort of thing so i do i get on the bike and it be like it's fine the only thing that be different about it it the tyres be fine they be pump up lovely well you have them pump up for me
S0509	yeah i do yeah
S0510	proper job erm be that on the front of the bike you know i have that really massive bell that be a bite of a statement bell it be huge wasn't it
S0509	yeah and rusty
S0510	and rusty and of course it it you know it wasn't really function very well
S0509	and barely work any more
S0510	erm that be go and also my front light be go so erm but anyway test it i say that's fine oh my gosh you're amaze you're a star
S0509	yeah
S0510	you know give her a big hug and everything and erm and she be go right well i'm off then you know get yourself to work
S0510	so yeah so i be like ah i'll try and i start try to cycle it up the hill and i think i'm not even go to bother i'm just go to cos it be just too too steep and then i get on the phone as well because auntie then ring me
S0509	mm
S0510	she be ring me to see how i be and be there any news on my bike
S0509	wow
S0510	funny you should say that
S0510	because it just so happen that
S0510	yeah so i literally walk all the way up from from there with the bike get to work just in time
S0509	oh my god you get in on time
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	what that be mental
S0510	how about that cos i be think will i text and just tell her i might be a little bite late but i get in and erm how amaze be that so i i post a message on the noticeboard because you know erm
S0509	yeah they help you find it they help you get it back
S0510	they yeah and so and so many people have share it that i'd post this message last night to thank everybody for all their good you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	for post it and what great community spirit we've get here and shame about the few that just you know carry out these activities really
S0509	just yeah
S0510	and erm have post before i'd have a chance cos obviously she'd get home before i kind of get to work
S0509	yeah
S0510	a little symbol reunite well spot and thank you to the lady it be emotional
S0509	ah it be emotional
S0510	but it's just amaze i never think i be go to get it back
S0509	yeah well no blimey
S0510	so you you think it be steal on wednesday sometime i find out at five o'clock didn't i when i get back from work
S0509	yeah
S0510	and then i post it i think within an hour of it be steal and then it have be share literally hundreds of time between wednesday at about six and friday this morning at seven you know seven thirty or whatever
S0509	yeah aha crazy
S0510	the power of social media
S0509	yeah it can do good things can't it
S0510	it can do very good things
S0509	so why do you think they take your light and bell off
S0510	well i think maybe and i only think about this just an hour or so ago because it do seem a random thing to do
S0509	yeah
S0510	although the bell i think maybe it's such a statement bell
S0509	yeah
S0510	it's another you know thing to
S0509	a clue
S0510	clue but the light didn't make a lot of sense but then i think well hold on my my erm lock it be one of those coil lock that you know
S0509	yeah yeah yeah
S0510	i say coil it be quite a thick one that be long and you could wrap it round lot of things and i always wrap it round my handlebars
S0509	yeah
S0510	one of the things that i do as well as the frame be wrap it round my handlebars
S0509	handlebars
S0510	and so maybe where they cut it it be by the handlebars
S0509	they'd break the yeah yeah
S0510	and therefore they have some problems there and maybe you know they get break along the way so they take them off
S0509	yeah yeah mm
S0510	take the light off anyway the bell might have just get take off because it be a statement bell
S0509	yeah yeah
S0510	but i mean thankfully you know the good thing about my bike be that it have quite unusual paint job on it
S0509	yeah
S0510	cos you don't see many with that kind of colour
S0509	it's an i be go to say it's an unusual colour
S0510	yeah it's like a metallic light blue and a silver
S0509	yeah it's kind of a funny old frame actually it's quite like it's really thick in place you know
S0510	yeah yeah cos it's well a lot of hybrid bike have get have that kind of shape
S0509	right well yeah
S0510	but you know it's erm it be distinctive i think and so that's a good thing that's go for it
S0509	yeah yeah
S0510	and maybe you know it just get too hot for the person that have it because it get share so much
S0509	yeah yeah
S0510	that you know on all these sort of community group as well and bike group
S0509	mm
S0510	that er i don't know maybe they just leave it there but then you i wouldn't have think they'd leave it in such an obvious place you know if you're gonna dump a bike there's plenty of place
S0509	maybe they felt guilty and they want it to go back to you
S0510	well and that be what i think about the woman that post it
S0509	yeah
S0510	so just think oh that's you know you immediately think oh well that's wonderful and then you start think well that's funny
S0509	yeah
S0510	you know that it's it's in that place
S0509	yeah
S0510	and that some you know but i don't think so i think she genuinely she be just somebody on
S0509	yeah
S0510	on the bus that saw it i've check out her facebook page see what kind of person she be
S0509	i be go to say yeah
S0510	i mean she's be swim with the dolphins for goodness sake so she she must be of good character
S0509	probably not
S0509	ah i don't know
S0510	yeah so crazy huh
S0509	yeah
S0510	and then i thank in clinic you know always do all this pray she's really into her churchy things and erm
S0509	yeah yeah yeah
S0510	she have some amaze stories to tell about you know outcomes after she's pray for something
S0509	course
S0510	and but i say to her anyway i thank everybody that share it socially and and that and i say oh amaze news thank you for pray i've get it back she be go no really be it okay be it intact
S0509	be it ill be it hurt
S0510	i say yeah it's intact well you know it's all the the bell and that's go but that's okay it's probably be it's make an improvement
S0509	it's time
S0510	exactly she be go well as soon as you tell me when i go out i say dear lord you know please you know let get this back and let her get it back intact
S0509	ah bless her
S0510	bless her
S0509	maybe the only reason they steal it mummy be because your bell be a crime against bell and they have to remove it
S0510	they have to they have to do something this cannot be yes not only be it you know twenty time the normal size of a bell
S0510	it be warp and rust and have no functional use
S0509	it's it's a disgrace to the society of bell
S0510	yes quite yeah maybe they be oh god what do they call them what be the bell ringers call there's a word isn't there for a group of bell ringers
S0509	bell ah a belfry i don't know
S0510	no that's not it yeah yeah
S0509	i know i know i be just make up word with bell in them
S0510	i want to a say but it's not
S0509	a taxidermist
S0510	it's not a taxidermist but it's erm no no no
S0509	mum a taxidermist be
S0510	but it oh gosh what be it
S0509	i don't know what it be
S0510	that's go to get me now old bill bailey would be able to tell us
S0509	ah yeah probably
S0510	as he be he be chief bell ringer erm
S0509	oh yeah course
S0510	yeah cos er yeah
S0509	ah
S0510	so amaze stuff so i i'm so glad that i didn't rush to kind of get a replacement from
S0509	yeah
S0510	cos i i just think i'd give it a little few days and just give me time to sort out with cos have erm have offer to give me her old bike
S0509	aha
S0510	do i tell you about that
S0509	i think you do yeah
S0510	yeah erm so yeah amaze but now of course the dilemma be after you know after what happen you probably remember i say to you even if i have the money i i'd wouldn't get a new bike now cos i'd just be too worry about it get steal
S0509	yeah
S0510	erm
S0509	and now the dilemma be how to protect it
S0510	yeah so i be
S0509	cos you have a really good lock
S0510	yes although actually uncle send me a message and he beg to differ that i have a good lock so you know
S0509	oh
S0510	eh eh
S0509	isn't there like a whole thing about no lock be a good lock though
S0510	i've not hear of that
S0509	well it's just like basically all bike lock be useless
S0510	oh right well if any if somebody want to enough
S0509	yeah
S0510	campanology
S0510	campanology
S0509	campanology the art of bell ring
S0510	yes indeed yes
S0509	i be go to say isn't there i maybe there be someone in a bike shop who be tell us or maybe it be uncle about like how like you can spray freeze stuff on it or something and then it break really easily i don't know
S0510	oh
S0509	someone be criticise that kind of bike lock
S0510	oh okay oh really
S0509	i might have just be make up that up
S0510	yeah
S0509	but
S0510	but then i've hear a couple of things in the last couple of days about how you can one get erm like a tag almost like you can get for animals you know a little erm oh what do they call it
S0509	yeah microchip type thing yeah
S0510	microchip thank you yeah for your bike so that you can locate it
S0509	oh what like a gps thing
S0510	yeah yeah yeah so you can tag it
S0509	oh do it man
S0510	erm
S0509	but then you've get to make sure that they don't remove the tag
S0510	tag yes make sure well i guess
S0509	like drill a tiny hole in like
S0510	mm
S0509	the metal bite and push it in
S0510	the frame yeah yeah that's it that's the thing i mean you could couldn't you you could put it within the frame or within the handlebars or you know they might not necessarily find it right away
S0509	yeah yeah in the handlebars would be a good one actually
S0510	yeah yeah so there's that i don't know about the cost of that i'd have to check it out erm also insure it
S0509	mm hm
S0510	i'd say i'd have to find out about insurance but it's like you know be it
S0509	be it worth it
S0510	yeah i mean although my bike kind of all in with all the accessories be four fifty when i buy it
S0509	it's go downhill since then
S0510	it's yeah you know for the last year and a half i've leave it in town every day in all weather uncover so there's a bite of rust on there you know
S0510	erm but it's still a good bike but yeah
S0509	yeah
S0510	erm so therefore that thing about get an old wreck where it doesn't really matter and nobody would want it anyway if it's an old wreck come into play however of course the key thing which i'd completely forget about until we be discuss get my bike home
S0509	yeah
S0510	because obviously it's not get light on and i didn't want to cycle down that massive hill with no light
S0509	yeah
S0510	hence chat to
S0509	yeah
S0510	can we get it in your car
S0509	yeah
S0510	he say can you take the front wheel off i say yeah it's get a i've never use it
S0509	yeah
S0510	but it's a easy release front wheel
S0509	oh
S0510	so that's what i need to do just take the wheel with me to work hello
S0509	it's a miracle
S0509	it's a miracle
S0510	why have i never think about that before because i'd never think about it get steal before really
S0509	yeah
S0510	well you know not
S0509	but then how long be it go to take you to take a wheel off every morning
S0510	no it's a quick release wheel literally it's get a lever it's just figure out how to put it back on
S0509	oh
S0509	if you could get the art of that down
S0510	you know i mean i just need to get the manual out and have a look cos i've never do it before
S0509	yeah
S0510	but it literally have a flick lever cos be say his and cos when we get it to his boot he be go aw have we get to mess around with the brake as well and i be go no i think it just flick off and you take it off so there's no worry about that
S0509	yeah
S0510	it's literally an easy release one but it's just figure out the erm how you put the bolt back in
S0509	yeah
S0510	cos there's a spring and stuff i just need to find the diagram to show us show me that and
S0509	yeah yeah
S0510	job do and then i just take the bike on the ah the the wheel
S0509	yeah
S0510	on the bus with me to work
S0509	i mean you could still steal it if you be really determine but it'd be it'd probably be enough hassle to deter a thief especially if there's other bike there
S0510	well they're not go to make a quick getaway be they with a bike with only one wheel
S0509	oh yeah you can't cycle it
S0509	i be think because they could still wheel it like on the back wheel and just like walk around but then it would be like why why
S0510	it's a bite obvious yeah yeah
S0509	yeah that's yeah yeah just do that you'd be you'd be fine
S0510	so i'll do that
S0509	yeah
S0510	and maybe get the double lock cos uncle be say to me you know he lend me his bike last night to come home
S0509	yeah
S0510	and er i be say i'll take it home you know i wouldn't want to take it out and leave it erm and he say well just double lock it and i'm sure it'll be fine double lock his bike
S0509	double lock what so put two lock on it
S0510	yeah so
S0509	right
S0510	i've get to buy another lock anyway i don't need to now though you know i don't need to double lock his now
S0509	yeah
S0510	but i be go to have to buy another lock anyway
S0509	yeah yeah yeah
S0510	erm so that would have be the other thing but i don't even need any of those things
S0509	you don't even need a lock to be honest
S0510	oh well i do need that
S0509	i be i be kid i be kid
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	oh wow
S0510	so amaze eh yeah
