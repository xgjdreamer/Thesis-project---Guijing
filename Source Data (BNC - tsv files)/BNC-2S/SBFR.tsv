S0255	yeah

S0255	yeah
S0256	i'll do it then
S0255	yeah
S0256	yeah
S0255	and it's cos rainbows hasn't start yet have it
S0256	no it's wednesday tomorrow anyway
S0255	oh yeah
S0255	today's tuesday
S0256	yeah so no erm it'll be good i cos i i've get a lesson tomorrow morning and then i'll have in the even but i'm gonna go straight from work i'm gonna try and build a bite of time back up from today
S0255	mm
S0256	so
S0255	so will you be alright tomorrow be will that be a long a enough time in the morning
S0256	yeah yeah yeah he say like on the day
S0255	oh that's alright then
S0256	in fact
S0255	well i think that be that be really good though ring and go and get him to check it
S0256	mm
S0255	your tooth
S0256	yeah i'm glad i do because it's a lot better now but i know it must have be bad for me to say yeah i'm gonna go and get it check i think yeah it's it's good i'm happy it's out now
S0255	so do you feel less wise now you have less wisdom teeth
S0256	no one tooth's fine
S0256	i always say a secret genius in the make so
S0255	you you say you say what
S0256	i say i'm a secret genius
S0255	oh right
S0256	erm no it's good though it still feel weird
S0255	mm
S0256	cos so have a tooth there now that it's it's strange that it's go but
S0255	yeah
S0256	i'm glad it be it's so much more comfortable i can actually feel i've come back to me
S0255	mm
S0256	that's nice
S0255	so tell me what you do with the skate now
S0256	erm well we've get the we'll be start work on the christmas so er show soon cos it's we normally know by october what we're do and so we should know if they're talk about like cinderella or mary poppins or jungle book or something like that but
S0255	yeah
S0256	erm hopefully this year if it's a show it'll probably just be our lot so then we might get to do a bite more as well so that'll be nice erm just practise for my test at the minute though i'm wait for my test date it shouldn't be long
S0255	how how long roughly
S0256	i wouldn't say it would be that long like i think we'll know the date soon and then it just depend on when there's enough people to put in for a test cos they won't bring a a judge in if it's only like one or two people want to test they want to have like a full morning's worth of test before they'll bring a judge
S0255	so they have to wait until they've get
S0256	yeah yeah
S0255	enough people be there lot of people last time
S0256	there be a fair few yeah erm lot of people do a number of different test so people do like their elements and their freestyle and their field move on the same day so then it erm it just end up be that the there's not necessarily that many people but there's enough people to do a number of different test otherwise it's a waste of a judge's time to come in and a waste of the money
S0255	so what's be they in a particular order that you have to do one lot then another then another or be it just you'll do
S0256	erm
S0255	different level in each type
S0256	yeah you have different level in each type so like it go up to ten and then you have it in freestyle er so like the that's like your programme and you have elements which be like your jump spin things like that erm and then you have field move which be show off like the skills and the basics of skate to show that you can do footwork and things and then you've also of course you've get dance and they all go up to ten so i've get my field move level one i've pass and my free level one i've pass and i'm work on my field move level two my free level two and i'm work on my elements level one and two so that i can put in for them
S0255	so when
S0256	once i've do level one
S0255	when you do the test thing then can when they come to test you could you be do two or three different things be that what you normally do
S0256	yeah you well you can either do it depend really what you've get ready for test er my level twos aren't quite ready for test yet so i'm not put them in but i could very easily do level one and two in in in elements while i'm do my level two and three and my level two in field move but they're
S0255	mm
S0256	not quite polish enough yet that we're ready to put them in they're nearly there with some of them but there's just bits where they're not quite ready like my my sit spin isn't quite low enough
S0255	mm
S0256	so then it's not ready to be test
S0255	oh that's alright
S0256	yeah
S0255	so like what be the last show that you do with the ice skate i'm try to remember
S0256	that be the gala
S0255	oh that's right yeah so that be all just load of different bits
S0256	yeah it it be rubbish really and i'm glad that we're not do that this year we're do an actual show this year
S0255	i think the last show be that the like the lion king
S0256	the lion king yeah
S0255	that be really good
S0256	or the er african adventure as it be formerly know
S0255	well yeah yeah
S0256	yeah no it i think the problem be because we do a gala the the other group like the join it because they could just put stuff in that they be put in the gala
S0255	yeah so they it isn't really
S0256	so they weren't great so there be more people that and more coach involve so it mean that there wasn't it wasn't the same as when it's and like run it it's not quite the same it as as that but this year if there's a show
S0255	then you'll get the continuity and they'd know how to bring the best out in everybody rather than
S0256	yeah exactly
S0255	lot of people have an input
S0256	and it's control
S0255	yeah
S0256	like last year with our group the we end up be give cast off from another group
S0255	mm
S0256	that be a lot lower level than us and we have to like dumb the whole routine down for them which mean that those of us that be higher level weren't get to do anything or show off anything and it also mean we didn't have enough time
S0255	mm
S0256	to do what the coach want to do but if it's a if it's a show like with here won't because they've get the gala that they do every year so if that's on they won't do the show
S0255	yeah
S0256	because they it's too much of a commitment with just start
S0255	yeah
S0256	it just mean it'll be the skate academy lot so like and 's lot that'll do it and and it'll be a lot more availability and we'll have to do more
S0255	well that's good because like even if you're in a group and a lot of the stuff you're have to do isn't at that high standard you should be able to hopefully do two or three or little bits yourself
S0256	yeah
S0255	to go off and actually do a little bite more
S0256	well some of the people that be in the group like the top two circle
S0255	mm
S0256	be at the same level as me which be fine
S0255	yeah
S0256	and have a good work ethic as well because it's the problem be you get the ones that just muck around and don't wanna do it
S0255	mm
S0256	you get the ones where they're learn the basic the most basic of move that we've all be do for years
S0255	yeah
S0256	and then it's they don't know how to do it and you that's when you can see there's gonna be a problem because you can't put anything too complicate in
S0255	mm
S0256	because they won't do it won't be able to do it and then those of us that be that be at the top of our group because we're sort of the in between ones we're not quite we're almost at the level of the lower lot in the higher group but they're push to keep up with the top group whereas if you do a show the ones that be at the top of the top group
S0255	mm
S0256	will be the main character
S0255	yeah
S0256	with some of the ones lower down be some of the main character
S0255	yeah
S0256	you'll then have the ones that almost at our level be at our sort of level and we could all be in a group together
S0255	yeah
S0256	because they're closer to our level some of them be be try double and just about land axels but they're actually more comfortable do the lower down jump so then
S0255	yeah
S0256	we'll all be around the same sort of level and a lot of people have say well not a lot but some people have say they're not do it this year any more they're not sure if they're go to do it they might help out instead
S0255	cos that's one good thing with you you can actually have the flexible time at work this year can't you
S0256	yeah yeah at least i have
S0255	whereas before you'd really struggle didn't
S0256	and i've get the october half term off
S0255	yeah
S0256	which be a very
S0255	er
S0256	clever plot of mine because usually we have extra rehearsals in in october half term
S0255	yeah
S0256	and i can never make any of them
S0255	no
S0256	but it be free there be like one space across the week leave and i be like i'm have that thank you very much
S0256	so i've get that off so then even if we're not do anything i can still go in and skate or do other things but if we have
S0255	yeah
S0256	get it plan work that we'll be do which we usually do
S0255	yeah
S0256	i'll be able to commit to more rehearsals
S0255	so what date's that roughly
S0256	er it's the week after my birthday
S0255	okay
S0256	so like the twenty fifth of something i think it be something like that twenty fifth twenty sixth cos my birthday's on the wednesday which i've get off and then it's yeah so it'll be about the twenty sixth i think or twenty seventh it's the end of october
S0255	mm
S0256	so
S0255	that picture of dad be that the one where you go to stay near
S0256	yeah yeah
S0255	erm tell and it be when you go up the stairs do what be it you have to duck
S0256	oh yeah er for
S0255	just make me think
S0256	cos it be like a convert barn or something so like those be the like beam go across the top of the stairs so as you if you like if you be stay in a bedroom that be upstairs it look like something out of like an old story book
S0255	mm
S0256	you have to duck under this beam to actually like get get to the bedrooms the problem be you'll probably forget about that in the the morning and trip over and fall fly down the stairs so
S0255	mm
S0256	i think it be safer to stay in the little room
S0255	yeah oh i know mum be say all about it say about all the things that be there from be it the old erm when it be a stable
S0256	yeah that's it a stable it wasn't a barn it be a stable yeah
S0255	yeah yeah
S0256	my room be just big enough to swing a cat in but
S0256	it be it be fine apart from the
S0255	without a beam
S0256	yeah exactly but the problem be cos it be erm right down on the grind floor and because there be field nearby
S0255	yeah
S0256	there be a mass of spiders so i be on spider patrol cos nana doesn't like spiders do she'so i be
S0255	oh
S0256	on spider patrol
S0255	it be funny one of my friends put on facebook something about erm saw the biggest spider ever it be so big it actually stop and wave at me
S0256	yeah yeah that's what this one be like that i find
S0255	yeah
S0256	there be some big spiders i don't know what it be there seem to be lot recently haven't there
S0255	no it's this time of year it's when they
S0256	yeah
S0255	erm the the harvest they they cut all the the weed
S0256	it's probably because
S0255	and the the spiders all come out
S0256	there hasn't be facebook have there and people have get more so that when they're post on facebook
S0255	people be put picture of
S0256	they post the silliest things
S0255	yeah
S0256	whereas you think a couple of years ago you probably wouldn't have have that your facebook be just about what be you do you know keep in touch with and now it's just post a picture of a spider
S0255	exactly yeah that's what make me laugh on facebook when people that or about the tenth person that put it's snow it's snow it's snow and somebody put yeah i could look out the window and see it's snow
S0255	but thank for tell me
S0256	yeah but then but then you you go on facebook and you see it's snow and if you be tell you be it and then go oh it be
S0256	like you like you have to verify what they're say like i don't trust that you're say it's snow
S0255	yeah
S0256	i've get to go and just check the facts
S0255	and then people click like
S0256	yeah
S0255	that you like that they've say it's snow
S0255	be that the fact you like it's snow or you fact you like that they say it's snow
S0256	or be it just because they're your friend and you think mm they've not get enough like
S0255	you just yeah you just
S0256	at this stage and like everything
S0255	yeah
S0256	yeah
S0255	oh
S0256	yeah it be funny some of the things people put put on there
S0255	mm
S0256	it's er it make me laugh
S0255	at the minute everyone's put on all the picture of the kid start first day at school the first day of
S0256	i get a little bite feed up of that i think well i don't mind like the first day of primary school

S0255	yeah
S0256	my my fee be just full of first day back to school picture
S0255	yeah
S0256	for like two or three days
S0255	yeah
S0256	yeah
S0255	i i i saw quite a lot of those
S0256	yeah
S0255	as well but then i mean we've still get the picture of you and the picture of both start secondary school
S0256	yeah
S0255	the the photo yeah of your first
S0256	well your
S0255	well i mean i've get picture that i take in the garden of both of you each time
S0256	yeah yeah i remember those
S0255	i've get picture of you both on your first first day at school
S0256	mm
S0255	and then erm er 's get the the the official picture from the first year at at
S0255	er at secondary
S0256	oh
S0255	she's get those
S0256	i know
S0255	and she say she like that cos that's how she remember you when you be both little
S0256	yeah i don't
S0255	before you grow up
S0256	look anything like that now though
S0255	no you don't actually it's it's funny look back at some of the old picture
S0256	and i be all like oh hello i'm all do up ready for school
S0255	yeah well that be it it be good though cos the school make you have pride in your appearance and we insist that you still keep that and do that as well
S0255	so
S0256	it slip after the first few years though
S0255	but that's fair enough that's explore the boundaries
S0256	the shirt come out and you know
S0256	tie come down a little bite
S0255	yeah i remember when i be at school with our tie it be the fashion everyone use to have it in a really really big knot
S0256	yes
S0255	with just this tiny little bite poke out
S0256	yeah
S0255	and then we decide we change it and we use to just do the back of the tie like a mod a really thin tie
S0255	you have the back of the tie
S0256	yeah
S0255	go right down like that
S0256	yeah no we have the really big knot and the er and the little bite of tie but i i couldn't be bother with that i didn't do it like really long but
S0255	mm
S0256	i use to have it like loose but no i wasn't
S0255	yeah
S0256	wasn't part of the crowd that do the like real big knot or anything so i didn't bother
S0255	yeah it's funny
S0255	it make you think like so who do the fashion and who decide or whether
S0256	yeah
S0255	one cool person do it or person who think they're cool
S0256	we use to just each other's tie so there's no point
S0255	what's that mean
S0256	where you get hold the tie and then pull it down really hard and it like tighten the knot really bad like bad so then they can't undo it
S0255	you're such a cruel child
S0256	i didn't do it no other people use to do it
S0255	you just say we just use to
S0256	like my friend's group use to do it and then i be the one that get very good at undo the knot so everyone use to come to me and go
S0255	well yeah
S0256	cos i be good at undo knot
S0255	okay
S0256	so they use to come to me
S0255	yeah
S0256	and say can you undo this and i'd go stand still
S0255	i be always really good at undo knot if you get like
S0256	yeah
S0255	a string ball of string really bundle up
S0256	yeah
S0255	i'd be the one i'd sit there and i'd have the patience i would just sit and keep work it and move it
S0256	yeah or necklaces that's the
S0255	oh yeah
S0256	where if the necklace be where you have to like wiggle it really carefully
S0255	mm
S0256	and then get it out so that it doesn't break
S0255	it's a real sense of satisfaction
S0256	yeah
S0255	it's work it out and just gradually work each bite and do it
S0256	yeah
S0255	and
S0256	i like that so yeah i be a undoer i don't think that's a word i think i've just make up a word
S0256	oh i i make up a i can't remember what it be i make up a word the other day and i can't remember what it be but it and it it be such a silly thing i end up combine two word just randomly make up a word and go it wasn't what i be aim for but i don't remember what it be though
S0255	mm
S0256	but it be it be just really weird and i be like okay
S0255	language be fascinate though
S0256	yeah
S0255	i think you should be able to make up word or
S0256	yeah
S0255	or you know put word together and express how you're feel
S0256	yeah yeah
S0255	yeah although the mind's boggle right now
S0256	i can't remember what it be like it's gonna bug me
S0255	mm
S0256	but i i don't even remember i think it be something like i be say i'm great and something else or whatever you know when you do you just mush the two together and it end up be some sort of
S0255	yeah
S0256	that be it i say jarble it be mean to be jargon and garble i be like
S0256	i'm garble or it's jargon and i go
S0255	yeah i'm jarbling
S0256	oh what it be i'm jargle it's or it's jargle and i go that's not a word
S0255	no it should be though
S0256	jargle i think so yeah
S0255	it should be it's a good word
S0256	it's yeah when you're talk jargon but you're garble it jargon jarble sound like a gerbil though
S0255	this be get silly
S0256	i don't know fine
S0255	oh
S0256	yeah
S0255	well i think that's forty eight so that must be ten minutes we
S0256	i hope they're go to get that at the end again we
S0255	yeah so thank you
