S0517	okay
S0558	and she be say how it's like an academy status and it's one of something like five and it's
S0517	right
S0558	a really seek after school
S0517	oh so the and be they in
S0558	and the price have rocket
S0517	the catchment for it oh
S0558	yeah
S0517	gosh yeah
S0558	yeah
S0517	yeah
S0558	so they've pay about i think it be a hundred and forty something
S0517	i be gonna say that sound good actually hundred and forty for a semi detach house that
S0558	yeah i suppose it be really
S0517	it be yeah
S0558	i think i i but i'll have to check erm anyway lovely they've
S0517	oh good
S0558	decorate the lounge and the din room and paint the kitchen the kitchen cupboards will need replace eventually but they're absolutely fine at the moment
S0517	mm
S0558	erm but it's what they've do be it be two room knock into one room plus an extension
S0517	right
S0558	and then it's open plan round to the kitchen
S0517	okay
S0558	so she say although it's lovely there's no doors to go through as such when the wash machine be on
S0517	on you can hear it
S0558	or the dishwasher
S0517	or the kettle
S0558	yeah
S0517	and the smell from the cook
S0558	yeah
S0517	yeah
S0558	so she's
S0517	that's the only downside to open plan
S0558	yeah
S0517	yeah

S0517	yeah yeah
S0558	particularly when children come along and

S0558	this
S0517	bring her back to
S0558	well i don't know how the
S0517	somewhere that suit her i expect
S0558	you know what happen probably what's probably happen be maybe all three of them go in one car
S0517	mm
S0558	then maybe because of all the logistics of sort out the car come back stay with drive back in the new car drop at the hospice
S0517	maybe
S0558	and then she be on standby to potentially
S0517	to pick him up
S0558	pick him up but i drop him home
S0517	who know yes yeah
S0558	but she wasn't home anyway
S0558	say she might be at home and we pull round the corner and go no she's not

S0558	can't they widen their drive
S0517	well they've widen it they do widen it years ago so that they could fit three on when learn to drive and then of course there be always four because both the girls
S0558	yeah
S0517	have cars but then they always have boyfriends round it be not uncommon

S0517	whereas bt you've get to do it on the phone and it's a pain isn't it mm
S0558	oh start well
S0517	about time
S0517	we're have a a nightmare we do you do do you know he buy himself a an expensive watch before christmas
S0558	no
S0517	he'd save up some of it it be some birthday money and some of his paper round money and he save up and he buy himself a hugo boss watch very nice
S0558	wow
S0517	hundred and sixty pound he spend but that's fine that's what he want you know what kid be like today he he search and search and search on the internet and he find the one he want so i order it for him and he give me the money and it be the watch shop and they say they'd deliver it to us or that we could pick it up from a goldsmith jewellers and i say well we'll pick it up cos you're gonna need the link take out it's gonna be too big for your wrist so we do that but this be all do by email so which be quite good it's all er record and then erm he he wear it and not even three weeks later the clasp break
S0558	oh dear
S0517	and you know how the you know how these watch they have both side
S0558	yeah
S0517	just wouldn't close so we take it back to goldsmiths and she say oh no that's not catch be it she say i'll send it back for you so they send it back so we have an email say they've receive it etcetera etcetera and then erm an email come from the watch shop that say it's go to cost you forty eight pound to replace the bracelet or the clasp erm it's not cover under our guarantee because it's erm consumables and it's a lifestyle thing so i write back and i say i appreciate that it's you know the strap
S0558	mm
S0517	would be wear and tear i say but this be three weeks old that's not
S0558	no
S0517	fit for purpose that's not reasonable
S0558	no
S0517	erm and then they come back with yeah we understand that you're disappoint with our response we're prepare to go fifty fifty so it's twenty four pound ring this number and then we'll get it and pay and we'll get it repair this be our final offer and will not be negotiate so i write back again and say you know no that's really not good enough there's be a new consumers' right act come in first of first of october
S0558	you're very good
S0517	well i google it first of er first of october there's a new consumer right act and you know within thirty days if goods be faulty you can have a full refund i say you know and obviously because it be all do by email we've get the email say when it be ready for collection the email say when we
S0558	yeah
S0517	pick it up when all the rest so all within thirty days so i say obviously our first choice be that you repair it at no cost to ourselves but fail that will accept a full refund because the goods be faulty within thirty days oh and then they've just come back i have to chase them up for a response to that cos they didn't er but then they email me exactly the same email say we understand you're disappoint we'll pay fifty percent ring this number pay twenty four pound it's not negotiable and i be this close to pay it i just though do you know what twenty four quid
S0558	yeah
S0517	it's not
S0558	yeah
S0517	you know twenty four quid it's nothing be it in the scheme of things nothing and be just like but they're in the wrong i say i know they be i just say but if we take this fight on cos they be so not for move say he's not gonna have this watch for months and he's save up say no we're not pay that that's wrong so phone citizens advice who say they can't do that there's a new consumer right act come in i say yes we know we've already quote it to them so they refer us to the website template letter you know say to them oh there be a whole load of stuff be there an independent person that they use to to resolve dispute let us know who it be we be entitle to a full refund all of this standard letter and if you know if this doesn't work then i think the letter be entitle you know notice before a county court
S0558	yeah yeah
S0517	claim or whatever and erm so that be just before christmas it be close to christmas i think it be the twenty second didn't oh no on the it say the template letter that we use off their website say you know you've get thirty days to respond to this but in the email i have say i would appreciate it if you could just email me back and acknowledge receipt of this email but they didn't so i email again on the twenty ninth copy you know the same thing say again you've get thirty days to respond i just want to know that you've receive it nothing so i phone them up she where be we today friday wednesday
S0558	friday
S0517	and you can't speak to the people in escalations they only deal with email i say well that's not really good enough so cos they're not respond to my email anyway sure enough literally five second after i'd kick off on the phone five minutes later the email come through with their response exactly the same you can pay twenty four pound and we will have it re er or we will repair it or at this stage erm we can send it off to the manufacturer for refurbishment they be call it now and erm we will deduct the cost of it from your eventual refund so i oh what a hassle so we get back onto citizens advice who be just say
S0558	it sound to me like they potentially have have a watch return in the past but i mean how do you know that be a brand new watch and it's not one that they've have a problem with i e this problem
S0517	well
S0558	and i walk through the door tomorrow
S0517	door
S0558	and they sell me that very watch
S0517	who know
S0558	cos they're try to get rid of it
S0517	i know it's i know so now we've ask for them er for yesterday i email them and say i would like you to return the watch without repair or refurbishment and without delay i will let you know when i've get it the citizens advice bureau say you know your option then be to take it to a jeweller ask them for a a report say be this reasonable wear and tear on a hundred and sixty pound watch that within three weeks the clasp have break chance be they're gonna say no that's not reasonable but you'll have to pay for that report then you'll probably have to pay for the repair cos he you know he just want to wear it
S0558	mm
S0517	and then we'd have to go to the small claim court and go down that route what a hassle i just say to i don't you know it's too much hassle
S0558	it's disgraceful
S0517	it be disgraceful and luckily every time we've phone the citizens advice they say well you know this new consumer right act have come in to help consumers in this type of situation you do have thirty days
S0558	can you not just ask to speak
S0558	to a senior manager just phone up and speak to a senior manager or print off every form of correspondence and on the first page highlight the date and the highlight the date
S0517	mm

S0517	which be a reputable jeweller
S0558	it be
S0517	and that's who we take it back cos they change the link take the link out
