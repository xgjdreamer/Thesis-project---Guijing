S0618	yeah i think it's more manageable in term of file size erm there be one that be a hundred and thirty two megabytes the other day and it be just too big
S0619	aha
S0618	yeah but anyway so yeah ah not too much further up here then you turn right
S0619	aha
S0618	and then be a bite like where we be
S0619	aha
S0618	with the other day just like erm it's get a smallish
S0619	smallish place
S0618	yeah a small square in the middle with park all around a few shop you know the butcher the baker the candlestick maker all around in a square and that's it
S0619	mm mm
S0618	and otherwise it's just sort of a thoroughfare for other place
S0619	yeah
S0618	and be quite similar to that and then for the you branch off and go another i don't know ten fifteen minutes up on a lot of single track windy roads and you end up it's about a thousand metres above sea level so hopefully you won't be too hot in the summer erm and it's stun
S0619	sound nice
S0618	absolutely stun and then the bite that i'll be stay in will be like a little log cabin and you've get an orchard behind you where you can see woodpeckers even in september october
S0619	mm
S0618	still see woodpeckers saw erm the great spot saw a male and a female and i saw a green woodpecker and they have jays and they have all sort of cute little bird as well thirteen cat i think something like six dog
S0619	do they have wi fi
S0618	they don't have wi fi
S0618	unless you're near the main house
S0619	aha
S0618	so you can go to the main house and get wi fi and then in theory the log cabin have an ethernet cable but i take my computer one time and plug it in and didn't work so
S0619	oh okay
S0618	and then erm it's get a little wood burner which be why i'm not live there now erm so yeah i think april time be or may time be sufficient it's get a wood burner and that's the only heat er water be alright the shower have a boiler where you don't touch a thing don't change the temperature do nothing and you should get warm water
S0619	right erm that's funny
S0618	yeah it be and then you sort of look out there's like a bite of a clear and they've get horse and cow and duck and hens and they sort of be in the clear bite and then you've get some more tree and then over the top of the tree where the sun rise you get this beautiful view of
S0619	nice
S0618	and you've get all the jaggedy mountains that look really sort of red and orange with the sunrise and it's just beautiful
S0619	very nice
S0618	mm so i'm look forward to that oh and they've get thirteen beehives and i really want to learn everything there be to know about be
S0619	yeah no no no post me some honey
S0618	yeah
S0619	well i'll come and get it myself
S0618	yeah
S0619	no i'm look forward to a relax couple of days wherever we be go anyway
S0618	what now
S0619	in yeah
S0618	yeah i'm really look forward to the spa i love feel the heat in my bone
S0618	you know
S0619	yeah and it you need it at this time of year
S0618	yeah and i love a wet heat that you get from the steam room
S0619	yeah i've be consider i've not be do it i don't think it's fair to but have like even shower as well
S0618	yeah
S0619	just because i mean to get you know warmth in my bone my feet especially
S0618	mm have your flat be cold
S0619	ah well i've have the heat on
S0618	yeah
S0619	ah on and off depend on where i be and what i'm do but i keep wake up in the middle of the night really hot and have to turn it off when i go for a wee at about four
S0618	ah okay you can't change it someway so do you just have a timer
S0619	it's it's not on a timer
S0618	ah
S0619	but it's a little bite it's either too sensitive or not sensitive at all in that it's either on really hot
S0618	oh okay
S0619	or it's not on at all
S0619	yeah and like even if you put it on two it stay cold and if you put it on three or four then it's really hot it's
S0618	
S0619	yeah ah it's be a real problem
S0618	i've find that i can be toasty in the live room because it's you know it's a big enough room and it's get two radiators in it and then i go up to bed it's fuck freeze
S0619	mm mm
S0618	cos it's you know a big size room with just four windows no curtain
S0619	yeah
S0618	and yeah i i think just that volume of glass make it really really cold and so i just take a hot water bottle up and have two blanket wear a fleece and when i get up for my first middle of the night wee i take my fleece off and i'm fine for the rest of the night sometimes kick a blanket off
S0619	yeah no quite snug
S0618	good i don't mind take the floor tonight by the way see as erm i'm probably more use to it i've get a couple of foam things in like the top here that i can put on the floor and then i've get the double sleep bag that live in the van then my double duvet and two blanket so i can kind of make a bite of a camp bed thing of sleep on stuff
S0619	mm mm
S0618	erm and then stuff on the top so i don't mind
S0619	no i don't mind do that
S0618	and then i gather then there be just three single bed for three single people but i didn't really like the idea of four people spread out on three bed push together
S0619	no
S0618	little bite close not that i don't like you all cos of course i do but you know
S0619	no i'm the same i just can't sleep with other people around
S0618	nah me either
S0619	i don't think i'll sleep very well anyway so it doesn't matter if i'm on the floor or not so i don't think i'll sleep much ah we'll see it's be quite a long holiday already there's another week
S0618	it's great isn't it
S0619	to go yeah we've do so much but it's be erm like as i say before as i've say before i've really enjoy do daytime things and have nights to yourself
S0618	yeah i suppose that's more natural yeah
S0619	yeah
S0618	cos when the you've get sunlight you know technically you're active and then oh lot of flash light
S0619	yeah oh my goodness me
S0618	oh
S0619	i think what be that
S0618	oh my god cop cars one two three four five six
S0619	oh my god
S0618	that's a raid that be seven oh my god that's that's a raid that's not an accident
S0619	yes load of
S0618	wow
S0619	detectivey type cars
S0618	yeah undercover cars seem to have a lot of those undercover cars in poland
S0619	do you think
S0618	yeah i quite often see one that's pull somebody over it's a like a plain clothe car
S0619	yeah well when get do for jaywalk
S0618	yeah oh that be yeah
S0619	that be an undercover car
S0618	yeah
S0619	i think i think they be really police and just some guy push their luck
S0618	i know yeah that cross my mind but he say it be all very official and they have badge and paperwork and
S0619	yeah document yeah
S0618	and they give him a receipt that look official so yeah but it would be real cos you know they could be pull over a polish person and there's nothing about he his foreigner
S0619	yeah he his face yeah yeah i think he's just kind of have a look in his eye
S0618	yeah
S0619	have you speak to him
S0618	yeah we've correspond a little bite on whatsapp and erm do a few whatsapp record voice message
S0619	he's a huge fan
S0618	he be i quite like it so yeah it's good he's meet a nice lady i can't remember her name or something like that
S0619	aha
S0618	but no and he's share a flat
S0619	like net meet nicely
S0618	as in net meet
S0618	as in have a relationship with
S0619	he doesn't mess around do he jesus
S0618	no he doesn't it's like right up here where be the single ladies yeah he's funny like that isn't he but he he do seem to be a guy who do seem to function better as part of a a team than on his own
S0619	mm mm
S0618	erm but he's live in a house with i think four men so oh wouldn't want to sit on that toilet seat
S0619	no
S0618	yeah
S0619	wouldn't fancy that at all
S0618	yeah
S0619	and i think he live with four men in london or he live with a few guy
S0618	yeah these guy love to cook and he love to cook
S0619	good for him
S0618	erm i think they're teach him about italian cuisine so he'll be thoroughly enjoy that erm and on his first night he go straight from the airport into the forest by a lake for an all night party and book his accommodation at six in the morning and yeah that be sort of his welcome to italy
S0619	good for him he's land just land on his feet doesn't he
S0618	yeah yeah he do but you know hat off to him he put himself out there he say right this be what i want now so i'm go to go and get it and i think that's marvellous i think it's very good to actually know what you want
S0619	mm mm yeah
S0618	and and then to go and get it
S0619	yes i think a lot of people just simply don't
S0618	so yeah
S0619	often know what they want
S0618	yeah i've be look for this petrol station but i fear we've now pass it so
S0618	erm
S0619	cross your legs
S0618	well i know but we should after the turn for i would imagine we'll start get a bite more into ski tourist town where they have a lot of bar and restaurants where the skiers go
S0619	yeah
S0618	of an even so shouldn't be a problem
S0619	i've never do sort of ski type party they look fun
S0618	it's just it's just drink beer isn't it
S0619	yeah
S0618	and eat fondue i don't know do it involve exactly
S0619	exactly that
S0618	mm
S0619	just drink and dance look fun all of these people have get their ski and their snowboard
S0618	yay but not us
S0619	no i hope 's well she doesn't have to have do all these things i hope she's get the helmet that i've be wear if not
S0618	pop round this morning to pick up her helmet and goggle so erm i say to her
S0619	tiny head unite
S0618	i know yeah and her little fifty four inch head and proud and i funny thing be my brother be the other way round he have a massive head
S0618	a huge head so when we both have motorcycle i have trouble find a small enough and he have trouble find one big enough
S0619	's brother's really really tall and she's
S0618	she's tiny
S0619	she's tiny tiny
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah and her brother be at this party as well i think he's gay erm and he be sort of say to me oh i'm not very religious but my sister and my mother be
S0618	oh 's quite religious be she
S0619	yeah
S0618	oh i wasn't aware of that
S0619	i think lot of well i don't know it depend how you define religious
S0618	yeah
S0619	and if you know go to church every sunday make you
S0618	no it doesn't
S0619	religious
S0618	it doesn't in my little bite of northern ireland where the whole community go to church religious so
S0619	yeah exactly yeah
S0618	but yeah i think that it's a more community thing and it's yeah well mind you my friend sort of swear oh jesus mary mother of god saint patrick fuck
S0618	so as you know that make you religious well i don't know yeah perhaps there's something to it but actually no they would light a candle for people or say a prayer for people but
S0619	aha
S0618	then if you say do you believe in god do you believe in afterlife do you believe you're a sinner do you believe jesus die to save you
S0619	mm mm
S0618	then the answer be invariably no
S0619	yeah his sin be be forgive oh yeah
S0618	i'm no sinner that's what piss me off what more of a disempowering control mechanism
S0619	aha
S0618	for humanity can you possibly have by say you're shit and you know you be you be bear that way
S0619	mm mm
S0618	and you have to repent and you've get so much to make up for i think bollocks isn't it much nicer to say to a baby and a small child you know you be a gift you be love incarnate you be perfection itself
S0619	that's nice
S0618	you be beauty you be the light of this world you be god incarnate if you want to use those term how much more of a you know positive smiley happy woohoo
S0619	mm mm
S0618	kind of an upbringing be people go to have with that but anyway to each their own
S0619	to each their own indeed it's not for me have fall out with me because i refuse to go to church on christmas day
S0618	wow
S0619	ah even on christmas day and it be because i be very hungover but
S0619	and i just think i don't go at any other time of year why should i go just cos it be christmas
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm i don't really i don't know i should probably have do it for her but
S0618	yeah but that's
S0619	she felt that strongly
S0618	that's a really shit reason to do something
S0619	mm
S0618	because you're no longer stand in your own truth you're sacrifice a part of yourself for somebody else's happiness
S0619	yeah exactly
S0618	i would wonder i mean your mum sound to me like an intelligent woman i would think if you phrase it to her in those term
S0619	yeah
S0618	she would probably think oh shit oh sorry about that
S0619	yeah true and we've talk about it before we've talk about religion and how i can't do it anymore don't want to do it it's not right i don't not only do i not believe in it but i actively disagree with the majority of it
S0618	oh yeah
S0619	wrong
S0618	me too i actively disagree i think anything that subjugate humanity or put humans down
S0619	yeah
S0618	be just so wrong i mean people be beautiful people be you know people be love and light in my mind
S0619	mm mm
S0618	people be wonderful we be an aspect of the divine we be the divine express itself and learn about itself
S0619	be that man just sell jam out of the back of his car

S0619	mm mm
S0618	like you'd take to a summer picnic sort of chair drink his tea out of his flask wait for a customer for a fire extinguisher
S0619	that's so nice
S0618	isn't that amaze
S0619	who ever would want to buy a fire extinguisher
S0618	i know just in case you happen to be
S0619	on fire
S0619	thank god you're here
S0618	maybe it's a polish thing maybe they have to have somebody every five miles sell fire extinguishers just in case a vehicle be on fire i don't know
S0619	outside there's someone who sit and sell bits and piece apples or potatoes or whatever they can find
S0618	mm
S0619	and er near zenith as well there's people who sit outside and sell stuff

S0618	well i can't no i can't fuck find them i know you know where they be and i just yeah they hide them when they see me come but yeah or a tin of soup or you know certain convenience things that you would expect would be sell internationally but they're just not but you can get himalayan sea salt and coconut oil easily
S0619	mm mm
S0618	you can get spirulina easily chia seed easily
S0619	and they i don't see or consider polish people to be especially erm what's the word ah health conscious
S0618	no
S0619	i think it's a lot more visible in england er people be far more healthy i mean lot of people be the exact opposite but you know
S0618	i be just wonder if you get that because of the polarity
S0619	yes possibly but you know there's sort of a holland and barrett everywhere
S0618	mm
S0619	lot of people be obsess with fitness i see far more joggers in england than here
S0618	yeah
S0619	and i've speak to students about this before
S0618	it be cold
S0619	no but i mean all year round and i've speak to students about it before and they say erm
S0618	oh
S0619	it's just not it's become a thing
S0618	oh it be become a thing
S0619	yeah yeah in the most student call he be a
S0618	what a great name
S0619	head of logistics at er this factory er and he say you know a couple of years ago you would never see anyone run in the streets they'd be sort of star at
S0618	mm yeah
S0619	erm
S0618	where's the fire
S0619	yeah
S0619	well
S0618	if it be the extinguisher man
S0619	er but now it's become more popular lot of meatheads in the gym and that lot of big guy
S0618	mm
S0619	no girls don't think girls exercise polish women exercise very much
S0618	no
S0619	not run really not
S0618	run run
S0619	run run yeah
S0618	mm
S0619	don't know i suppose a lot of them don't have time when i talk to the core group about exercise they're just say oh we don't have time
S0618	i know
S0619	we sort of clean the house or cook
S0618	we work fifteen hours a day yeah
S0619	eh well this be inconvenient
S0618	i know i'm not quite sure why we have a queue of traffic i hope it's not all the way to
S0619	i know can we just see what's potentially there
S0618	yeah erm no you can't cos cos i'm not well i'm not connect to the internet
S0619	no you can't
S0618	so it won't tell you about any traffic jam
S0619	no i'm just try to zoom out and see
S0618	and now since we've stop i think oh i really need a wee now which be a bite of a bugger i mean if it come to it we can have a pee in the van erm i'll just have to empty it but it's not a problem so accord to 's satnav we've get thirty minutes and forty two kilometres to go erm
S0619	mm mm
S0618	isn't expect us for an hour or a little bite under an hour
S0619	mm
S0618	so we can stop and get a coffee somewhere
S0619	yeah we let's just see what happen with this
S0618	erm yeah it's a bite annoy though irksome
S0619	let's just see not if there be any sort of traffic things but if there's like a town or i don't know junctions or type things come up what do you see
S0618	so zoom in ah zoom out ah
S0619	try and work out why
S0618	yeah keep an eye on the things at the side of the road cos cos when you've get a coffee shop come up they quite often do have billboards
S0619	mm mm
S0618	but it doesn't look like there be a town by the side of the road ah that could be ah no that's just random house i think
S0619	yeah
S0618	erm siberia
S0619	siberia
S0618	we might get a coffee in siberia
S0619	siberia
S0618	erm that probably look favourite
S0618	a little
S0619	little bite french
S0618	oh look and there's a knife and fork symbol oh and a p for park
S0619	oh good that's good
S0618	oh right we're go there so park area add as waypoint please
S0619	good
S0618	okay so we've add it as a waypoint start and won't tell us how far it be to waypoint but i don't think it's that far
S0619	well we'll see how this
S0618	that's probably a maccy d's or something
S0619	er anything's better than nothing though
S0618	indeed actually it's really not that far at all by the look of this
S0619	oh good
S0618	if we be drive i would say two minutes or or less so
S0619	probably not so
S0618	yeah look at this car number plate it ah it look like it say potty or something
S0619	oh yeah
S0618	i like all the fours
S0619	four four four four
S0618	so we be move oh that's good
S0618	okay so i'm just visualise a massive lorry that have miss its turn and need to do like a a seven point manoeuvre
S0619	mm mm
S0618	in the middle of the road so all of the traffic have to stop while the lorry do the manoeuvre and now the lorry be move and it's on its way so the traffic may now flow completely freely so there's my creative visualisation
S0619	good i'm think about it too
S0618	yeah and we're move see this be brilliant now it'll take a little while to get up to speed cos you've get people like me in big vans who can't really accelerate that quickly but yeah we're go and it's all good
S0619	good
S0618	mm
S0619	good good good
S0618	yes well glad we sort that out
S0619	otherwise we'd have a yellow snow situation
S0618	you would yeah
S0619	i wonder what that say well be health
S0618	but yeah healthy slippers shop
S0619	healthy slippers
S0619	i have bring my slippers they be five zloty and they're awful
S0618	i have as well

S0618	haven't you see the lady that stand outside in
S0619	outside yeah
S0618	oh my god

S0618	i think older polish women must have load of secret layer of fat
S0619	yeah
S0618	or just be wrap up in hot water bottle
S0619	yes
S0618	cos they stand outside in like minus fifteen degrees celsius

S0619	ah it's not look
S0618	well i suppose we be fairly rural so
S0619	yeah
S0618	but erm actually maybe that's what's cause the slower traffic be with things pull in and out of the restaurant

S0618	well i'm call it a restaurant it's just a knife and fork
S0619	knife and fork on a thing
S0618	on a satnav picture yeah i must ask i get the impression doesn't clean her own car i be go to ask her where she go seem a little ironic to me that anywhere you go in in the unite kingdom you can find somebody eastern european who
S0619	clean your car
S0618	clean your car efficiently and effectively for not too much money yet in poland it's kind of impossible erm i mean i don't mind clean the van myself but i maybe need somebody and i know you offer thank you to put coin in the thing to keep the water flow
S0619	yeah
S0618	but also to read the instructions cos these things you know usually have a soap function
S0619	yeah
S0618	now where be park here we be i can pull in here can't i yes
