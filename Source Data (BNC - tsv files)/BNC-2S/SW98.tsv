S0018	so be you live still with the the housemate that you find back in october
S0002	yes unfortunately i mean fortunately
S0018	what what but why be it i think you say it be a lovely place
S0002	er oh
S0018	you remember when you go to see it
S0002	do i say that
S0018	you remember when we saw those hovels
S0002	yes it's just a lesser hovel
S0018	oh but it's only the other it's only one flatmate
S0002	two flatmates but they're quite quiet they're third year undergrads so they're about to finish and they've get tons of exams and assignments so
S0018	but wasn't it er just live with one woman
S0002	mm
S0018	or be that a different place
S0002	mm that be a different place
S0018	ah
S0002	which i probably should've take but i didn't um
S0018	i be under the impression that you'd
S0002	oh
S0018	go with that
S0002	the nice one
S0018	one you see
S0002	no no no i didn't not in the end
S0018	i think it be all swish and you have a big room and
S0002	no oh that oh god i'd totally forget about that
S0018	so be it cheaper this other place
S0002	this place be cheaper but i've get i've be lock into a contract until the end of june and i'm now i'm try to find someone to replace me but i'm it's be i've be advertise it for two months and i haven't find anyone so
S0018	oh dear
S0002	probably i have to pay until june
S0018	how much be it
S0002	three hundred no yeah include bill and internet and everything it's three hundred and ten per month
S0018	that's not too bad with bill and stuff
S0002	yeah it's just like two minutes down the road
S0018	oh
S0002	so it's really close
S0018	perfect
S0002	yeah sort of roll out of the bed and go to the school in the morning
S0018	and be it a small place it's er what what be it that about the other place that you didn't like or be it just the price
S0002	do you you know where be
S0018	yeah
S0002	it's it be there
S0018	uh huh
S0002	um and that consider it be five hundred and fifty per month
S0018	oh right
S0002	um
S0018	okay
S0018	that be a lot more expensive
S0002	yeah it be a lot of money but she be quite flexible about when i could so i she say i could um leave after three months
S0018	mm
S0002	which would've be better um so i probably should've do that
S0018	what happen if you break your contract have you give them a deposit
S0002	i don't know yeah they've get a deposit
S0018	i mean that's
S0002	i don't actually know it doesn't it say that you have to complete the full contract i believe there's no like get out clause like give one month's notice and you can leave as far as i can see they tell me at the begin if i can find someone else to replace me then i can break the contract
S0018	se hmm
S0002	but that's quite hard
S0018	and how many months er rent do they have from you for
S0002	one month's
S0018	as a deposit
S0002	deposit but actually um huh we're think of push legal action against the landlord because er for the last three months we haven't have any well not we haven't have any but we've have major problems with the boiler
S0018	mhm
S0002	so we've be days sometimes weeks without hot water and heat um i've be go home to my mum and dad's for shower
S0018	oh no
S0002	yeah i know and every time we say every time well we must they we must have have british gas come round about fifteen time this year
S0018	yep
S0002	and they're still not replace the boiler and that's just one of the problems there's be tons of problems so
S0018	why don't you just refuse to pay your rent until he sort it out
S0002	so we've that's what we've now say that we're gonna do but it have to be all of us we have to all do the same thing if we don't then it's yeah we don't want them to er huh the thing be we get yell at every time we say look we're not pay until until it's all fix they make us feel like we're completely unreasonable which i know we shouldn't get talk round in er these things but
S0018	be it a private landlord or
S0002	no it's it's through an agency
S0018	mm
S0002	and the agency won't hear of us not pay so
S0018	yeah but i mean at the end of the day if they're not it could be a way of get out of your contract
S0002	that's this so in january when it be really bad over christmas actually i get really ill because
S0018	oh no
S0002	there be a week that there be cold water and it be cold at christmas and um i go i come to the university first i go to my faculty kind of adviser and say look i'm have these problems i wanna know if i can break the contract because i don't see why i should be pay consider it's it's like uninhabitable literally um
S0018	it be so cold as well wasn't it
S0002	it be freeze um and they say that there's nothing they can do so then i go to the university house they also say there's nothing they can do so now we now we've go through the citizens advice bureau and we've apply for legal aid
S0018	uh huh
S0002	and only one of the girls in the house qualify for legal aid be free because if you earn over a if you have a certain amount in save you can't get free legal aid
S0018	oh okay
S0002	so it's all up to her if she's will to push otherwise we can be do for not pay rent
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0002	it have to be do properly which be such a pain in the arse the whole thing
S0018	and have you have you get any er be there not a legal adviser in the university house association
S0002	no
S0018	cos can you be there not
S0002	no i've take my contract
S0018	mm
S0002	and they've just kind of go well we can't do anything they're pretty useless shouldn't really be say this on a record should i
S0018	why don't oh
S0002	um i yeah i don't cos it's a standard agreement i don't know i don't even understand why we're in such a difficult position to it's er so something will break and then someone will come round and it'll be fix for like a few days and then it'll break again so it's not like they're not react every time we complain they do come round like pretty quickly but it's just the point that if they dont' replace it or if they don't give us a proper solution i don't know
S0018	well they're obviously fix try to fix something that can't be fix need replace
S0002	basically yeah
S0018	and in your contract do it say that the that they be responsible for upkeeping the i don't know what they'd call it the
S0002	there's a yeah the like
S0018	fixtures and fittings
S0002	yeah
S0018	and
S0002	i mean like it's one of those contract which be like thirty statements long and one statement say the house will be keep in a reputable i can't remember the exact word but there be one clause that say that they but it doesn't define what it mean by inhabitable
S0018	well if there's no hot water
S0002	hot water
S0018	and no heat that's hardly habitable be it
S0002	they keep say to us oh summer's come soon and we're like and we'll still want a hot shower your point be really not valid at all like
S0018	well why don't you just try and get a lawyer to just get advice to say look they've break the contract in that they haven't keep the house habitable um i want to write them a letter say er
S0002	don't i have to pay for that
S0018	in consideration well i dunno try and find a
S0002	that's why we're try to go through the legal aid thing
S0018	or just ask er ask the question if i write this letter say that they've break this contract and this there have be no hot water and no heat since november
S0002	it's be intermittent since december
S0018	then that's you know that's not they're break the contract that's not what you sign up for
S0002	i think we talk to the landlord recently apparently they've be try to get hold of him and he won't answer the call and then finally the estate agent give us cos one of the girls be yell at him on the phone and she he give us the landlord's number and he the landlord phone back and he sweet talk her i be just watch her on the phone just go
S0018	oh
S0002	she start off really angry and then she sort of calm down and then by the end of it she be simper on the phone and i be just like
S0018	oh no
S0002	come on woman like but um it sound like he say he wasn't aware of the problem yeah right i don't believe you um and that he be gonna get someone round some of his own people to check it and if it need change he's will to change it but it's just be go on forever like and i think if we do threaten not to pay they probably will just fix it um i won't be able to break the contract
S0018	mm
S0002	which be kind of the idea
S0018	well that's the thing just don't threaten just say look for the past four months it's be uninhabitable we've be repeatedly tell you it have not be fix um i cannot continue i'm in i'm in full time education i have a lot of work to do blah blah blah blah blah
S0002	yeah we've we've say
S0018	this be
S0002	all of this
S0018	compromise my ability to concentrate it's um make it extremely inconvenient for me on a day to day basis because i have to go and have shower
S0002	at home
S0018	twenty miles away
S0002	yeah
S0018	um for this
S0002	but
S0018	reason i would like to dissolve the contract base on the fact that you haven't respect
S0002	i er that's actually i think pretty much be say and the answer just be you can't so without some legal intervention somewhere
S0018	can you not se what about the citizens advice bureau
S0002	that's yeah that's why we're go we've be to them and they say we need to go through legal aid
S0018	oh okay
S0002	which take time and i mean they're book us an appointment and the girl have to go in and see them and we can't all go because we can't all be represent blah blah blah blah blah it's just like typical really but to be honest i'm i just wanna forget it as in i'll just keep pay the rent just for an easy life in a way
S0018	yeah
S0002	and i can just go home whenever i'm lucky i have that option the other girls don't their family's down in london so
S0018	hm have they join the gym
S0002	yeah i know i i don't know what i think one of them go to her boyfriend's and the other one probably go to a friend's but or they've just be have cold shower i don't know
S0018	it's not typical i e it's not typical it's not what be i talk about
S0018	it's not er oh what's the word it's not an ideal situation
S0002	yeah
S0018	there you go
S0018	not an ideal situation when you
S0002	i'm like what be you try to say
S0018	i don't know what i'm try to say huh
S0002	no it's not an ideal situation
S0018	especially when you've get so much else to deal with oh

S0002	um and it wasn't at all it be pretty much like pakistan or like cambodia or yeah it be it be up there with some of the most sort of dodgy trip that i've do
S0018	really
S0002	in term of i mean they have sort of run hot water and things like that so
S0018	well it's better than what you've get at the moment
S0002	yeah i know i'm live in a third world country right now like

S0018	we be go to do we be go to i think arrive in fes
S0002	yeah
S0018	and then travel down the east coast go to er oualidia mm can't remember it be like twelve years ago
S0002	oh yeah i dunno about travel there i go with a female friend and we just she didn't get hassle for some strange reason i get hassle but it be not i mean like my friend who i go with have be to tunisia and say that that's much worse so i get i understand that what i go through be not that bad compare to other countries but i still don't wanna go through it again so they be pretty rude man like
S0018	i find that that um like the kind of te maghrebins in france be just so rude
S0002	yeah yeah
S0018	and there's like there's no barriers there's no they'll like they won't stop think that it's just not polite or not socially acceptable to come and sit next to you in a bar
S0002	yeah
S0018	and just not chat you up even just blatantly leer at you
S0002	yeah yeah mm that's horrible
S0018	it's disgust
S0002	yeah no i notice that i mean there be place in europe where it happen actually i mean i remember when i be travel
S0018	it's weird though it doesn't happen in spain
S0002	it doesn't happen in spain but that's cos they're all an amorous bunch aren't they so
S0002	i mean i get follow once or twice in spain and i have like random things happen like a guy on the subway in barcelona get down on one knee in front of me and sing me a song with his guitar and i be just like oh please go away
S0018	be you sure his best mate wasn't try to rob you from behind
S0002	um
S0018	pick pocket
S0002	probably but um
S0018	it be probably a diversion tactic
S0002	yeah it probably be yeah you're right well that's normally the thing in spain though they have their own problems
S0002	different ones but yeah no in france it be a bite dodgy and in some part of eastern europe it be a little bite but yeah no er morocco be just i don't know why er they think i be local which surprise me because
S0018	oh
S0002	i think if they think i be local they would treat me with a little bite more respect i mean i be dress like a local pretty much like i don't think i stand out blaringly obvious se i'm a tourist but er they just be so rude and the things they would say i just like i wish i didn't understand french
S0018	oh no
S0002	cos i don't wanna know what you're say like
S0018	so like lecherous things
S0002	just nasty they just comment on your body and what they wanna do and you're just like i'm gonna keep walk and ignore you i'm just gonna pretend you don't exist it's like
S0018	just say you can think it but just don't vocalize it alright
S0002	just don't even don't even look at me like it be pretty nasty actually
S0018	oh no
S0002	and
S0018	i'm sorry
S0002	well it be an experience i didn't realize it would be that bad like i have bruise on my arm where someone grab me i be like

S0002	yeah
S0018	crikey
S0002	and my mate be like why don't you just hit them or like shout at them and i be like we're in a muslim country you can't do that

S0018	mm
S0002	no one's gonna save you like
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0002	they're all gonna stick up for each other so
S0018	oh well
S0002	yeah
S0018	you know
S0002	so i'm not go back there
S0002	but apart from that
S0018	and i saw that you say to that you've get friends in thailand where she's go how do have you visit have you have you travel to thailand too
S0002	i have be to thailand i go a few years ago i do like a big six week trip backpack around
S0018	ah
S0002	thailand cambodia and vietnam
S0018	okay so that's how you get everything in it's like it's like katie say you you've be everywhere
S0002	i haven't be everywhere
S0018	you know people everywhere
S0002	i haven't be everywhere i haven't be to enough place i work it out the other day i've be to twenty six or twenty seven countries and there be like another fifteen that i really want to go to
S0002	i be like oh maybe one a year be my
S0002	aim at the moment to tick a new country off
S0018	oh my friend's just be to burma and it look amaze
S0002	amaze
S0018	she have such a fantastic time she really make an effort to meet meet locals and
S0002	yeah
S0018	and do local things
S0002	things
S0018	as oppose to touristy stuff
S0002	how do she do that cos i always wonder like what's the best way to sort of get a real experience when you go somewhere it's hard like
S0018	i think she's just get such a that
S0002	personality
S0018	kind of personality she really she really
S0002	that's pretty awesome
S0018	take risk in chat with people
S0002	yeah yeah
S0018	and because she's so eager and she's very i dunno she's very um engage
S0002	yes okay i can understand
S0018	i think she pick her she pick her victims well
S0002	charm
S0018	but yeah she be chat she she travel with a another girl who she meet in a a backpack place
S0002	yeah
S0018	en en route and i think the fact that there be the two of them together give them confidence
S0002	yeah to
S0018	to maybe
S0002	to sort of
S0018	chat with people um but they get invite back to families' house and
S0002	nice
S0018	have a few whisper political discussions and
S0002	blimey
S0018	go and stay at er temples and stuff like that
S0002	my mum's one of those she's really good at sort of te wheedle her way into
S0002	i mean a long time ago they come to visit me in japan and i would come home from work and my mum and dad would be sit there and my dad would be go don't tell her don't tell her and i'm like don't tell me what
S0002	and every day they have some story of how
S0002	they'd have a tour in a police van or
S0002	someone have drive them home or this woman have invite them into their house and i be just like you're in japan people don't even do that
S0002	but you're just like work your way round the countryside like it be pretty funny er they have a really good time
S0018	that's good
S0002	yeah
S0018	whenever my parent use to come to visit me i felt i just felt that they they abandon all abilities to make any decisions at the airport
S0002	oh and expect you to do everything
S0018	yes
S0002	oh
S0018	i mean i can
S0002	oh i just leave my parent to it
S0018	i can understand cos you know they don't speak the language they're a bite
S0002	be this in spain
S0018	yeah but also france actually
S0002	yeah
S0018	when i be in live in france as well yeah
S0002	yeah though i have friends who do that
S0002	they come visit you and they're just like you're gonna look after me right and i'm like um my language skills be just as bad as yours like
S0002	don't be deceive by the fact that i've be live here for three months like it doesn't mean anything like
S0018	so where's the next country on your list
S0002	to go new place or to go new i really wanna go to china um i'm sort of hop while i'm in japan cos i'm go for quite a long time that we can manage like a week trip i have a friend that live in shanghai with his girlfriend and they have a big apartment and they've say that we can go stay with them so
S0018	cool
S0002	i'm sort of hop that it might happen but it's very hard to sort out the visa
S0018	really
S0002	yeah because you need a visa to go to china and they need to know your concrete travel plan so i can't apply for it here
S0018	mm
S0002	because i want to buy the ticket in japan so that mean i'd have to apply for the visa in japan dunno how long it take
S0018	mm
S0002	so i'm not sure if it's even possible
S0018	that's a shame
S0002	it be i wish i could just get up and go but
S0018	er go to taiwan instead i don't think you need a visa to get into there
S0002	yeah can you go from taiwan i know you can go from hong kong into china quite easily
S0018	right
S0002	i dunno about taiwan
S0018	i don't know i've no idea and so do you be you try to get um teach work in china
S0002	before
S0018	yeah you know the the whole pre sessional thing
S0002	oh yeah i want to but i i keep umming and err which be my demise because
S0018	aha
S0002	it would be from may to june and i have to hand in my first full draft by the end of june so to do both at the same time be probably a bad idea but i be overlap one six weeks of pre sessional with the end of my dissertation
S0018	how many weeks have you get to do your dissertation
S0002	i've get from may to begin of september so may june july august four months
S0018	mm
S0002	so i'm hop that i'll be pretty much do by the end of july then i can do corrections in august and work at the same time for the six weeks and that's the plan i don't know if it's gonna happen
S0018	mm have um have your tutor be quite supportive and helpful in er your proposals your for your dissertation or you know it sound like you're just give her ideas and she's
S0002	yeah i just say i've think about this and she tell me yes you can do it no you can't do it you can do that for a phd love and i'm like i don't wanna do a phd
S0002	i just wanna get through this yeah they're alright i mean it's better here than it be at my previous university when i be an undergrad i felt like i didn't know anyone
S0018	mm
S0002	but here it's quite a small department but the problem be be they won't give you ideas and if you're really stick then you're really stick
S0018	mm
S0002	like if you don't know what to do cos i really can't think of er a plan b which i probably might need
S0018	what what be other your fellow students do
S0002	most people be not do teach relate project
S0018	oh okay
S0002	because there's actually only five apply linguistics people there's a huge number of critical discourse in communication like my friend that you meet earlier um and there's quite a lot of tefl people but they're do very tefly things
S0018	mm
S0002	like how do this affect a classroom or i dunno i don't really wanna do anything too tefly cos i didn't i do half of my course very linguistic and half tefl so i try to make a balance but it might have be my undo in some ways like
S0018	what kind of tefl stuff do you cover
S0002	i do teacher train
S0018	oh yeah
S0002	um english for academic purpose and that's it actually and everything else have be linguistics
S0018	and do they actually provide modules lecture and stuff on those subject
S0002	yes
S0018	oh right
S0002	but that's part of the tefl course that i kind of
S0018	okay
S0002	transfer over to a little bite
S0018	mm
S0002	but the other stuff i've do be corpus linguistics and
S0018	aha
S0002	discourse yeah yeah um discourse analysis and social sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics
S0018	okay
S0002	and yeah kind of
S0018	have you have to cover like structural linguistics and stuff like that
S0002	we have a choice i didn't cos
S0018	oh good choice
S0002	we all do do a bite of functional grammar which be not fun
S0018	urgh
S0002	urgh i end up write my assignment on we have a choice between functional grammar analysis and um something to do with lexis and i go down the lexis road which be probably the best decision i've ever make
S0002	because i would've fail the grammar a lot of people fail apparently
S0018	right
S0002	i think like cos we spend three lessons three ninety minute lessons analyze one sentence
S0018	oh my lord
S0002	so most of us be not really prepare to go in and do a full analysis by ourself and i think about more than half of the people that submit that paper fail it so yeah it be a good idea not to do it
S0018	how long be paper
S0002	four thousand word
S0018	huh four thousand word crikey it's all
S0002	our dissertation's only twelve thousand
S0018	mm se that's not actually much
S0002	it's not its actually probably not enough cos i have a
S0018	especially
S0002	problem with te wittering
S0018	especially for a research project
S0002	yeah
S0018	as well be the paper just like essay or be they research
S0002	we have one research paper this term and everything else be just essay
S0018	so how many have there be in total apart from the dissertation
S0002	not that many you know i don't know why i spend all my time complain um
S0002	i've do three already i have three more now and then i have my dissertation so six paper plus a dissertation
S0018	still quite heavy go
S0002	it's
S0018	especially when you have to read so much
S0002	i know
S0018	before you i i my problem be that i couldn't i couldn't get out of that stage of read and take note
S0002	mm
S0018	i have to always force myself into start to write things i just
S0002	because you be still read and take note
S0018	mm
S0002	yeah i'm i dunno i feel i just feel really uninspired
S0018	aw
S0002	so i'm just like it's not interest i don't wanna write about it that's a problem
S0018	mm
S0002	like you have to be interest otherwise you know
S0018	yeah
S0002	well you don't have to be interest but it sure do help like
S0018	and it what what do you think the master level be like cos i be you know the course i be do be er um at a master level but i think that it be grade i mean huh i read some of the paper that the research project that um some of my fellow school mat classmates whatever you call it
S0002	mhm
S0018	er have write cos they ask me to proofread them
S0002	yeah
S0018	um not only be the language awful but the actual content be awful as well
S0002	but do they do well
S0018	well they pass
S0002	they pass
S0018	they pass a master level assignment
S0002	i think pass well i don't know to be honest because i proofread one of my friend's paper and she fail two paper and when i start read it i think why have she fail it's not that bad but when i get into it structurally
S0018	mm
S0002	and content wise she didn't have a clear understand of what she be do
S0018	right
S0002	so i do understand why
S0018	mm
S0002	but i think i mean you know i don't know many people that be get firsts to be honest like it seem pretty hard to do well
S0018	well i get
S0002	it seem fairly
S0018	i get two distinctions
S0002	oo get you
S0018	and i be just absolutely floor cos it's
S0002	why you've so much experience you're
S0018	because it just
S0002	bring to the table like
S0018	yeah but it just felt like it be the the research be completely mickey mouse
S0002	mm yeah okay
S0018	whereas i be think oo master level research it's go to be really heavy and
S0002	yeah yeah
S0018	it's gonna be statistical analysis and it's gonna be
S0002	no i don't think it be that bad
S0018	and lot of different variables and it wasn't it be just basically
S0002	common sense
S0018	mickey mouse
S0002	how many paper have you already submit
S0018	three and i'd have to do three more
S0002	okay and then dissertation
S0018	no there be no dissertation
S0002	there's no dissertation
S0018	cos it's it's so practical base
S0002	and how long be the paper
S0018	three thousand word
S0002	okay
S0018	which be a nightmare because it's so difficult because you have so many things that you have to do the requirements of the
S0002	so keep it short and concise
S0018	yeah
S0002	and
S0018	yeah
S0002	yep that's hard
S0018	it be difficult like so you have to write an introduction review the government documentation then review the literature then describe your rationale behind choose the research methods that you do
S0002	mm
S0018	and then describe the research methods
S0002	that's a lot
S0018	and then te analyse the research methods and te analyse how if they work do i just say that can't remember
S0002	no
S0018	see i'm get confuse just tell you about it
S0002	well the i mean if it if you have to do that much it's literally what a paragraph for each thing
S0018	more or less
S0002	yeah i mean er
S0018	yeah i mean obviously you have to do the critical analysis with it i the yeah the the review of the literature
S0002	yeah
S0018	be more or less two side
S0002	side
S0018	and then the evaluation and of your find and criticize your research methods be about two side but i i dunno i just felt that it be really
S0002	mickey mouse
S0018	mickey mouse squeak
S0018	but i guess you don't find that maybe cos on my course it be more practical
S0002	i'm find well i mean i don't i i didn't know at the begin what a good level be do you know what i mean like what be what be a distinction you have no idea until you've actually submit something and get it back and for my first paper i get a distinction
S0018	all as
S0002	and then after that i didn't do so well i get two merit but low merit and i just think i couldn't see the difference between what i have do in the first and the other two and i be just like okay you set me up on a high but i still don't understand how to get up there now
S0018	mm
S0002	like it's er the the things last term cos it be all new i mean linguistics i don't really have a background in it i didn't really know it be all brand new they that all felt quite hard but this term the two tefl paper they don't seem hard it's not challenge it's just try to put it all together in a good way
S0002	yeah
S0018	yeah yeah
S0002	in fact i might show you one of my paper in a bite and go
S0018	yeah no problem
S0002	what do you think of this rubbish
S0002	oh
S0018	it sound so difficult have to choose your dissertation topic with no hardly any support though
S0002	but i guess that's the way it be
S0018	so what's your drive instructor like
S0002	i think no more complain
S0002	he's alright he shout a lot
S0018	why
S0002	but apart from that i don't know i think that be normal why what's your drive instructor like
S0018	really chill he's such a nice guy he's really er er er his instructions be really clear and they come at exactly the right moment and he chat around them as well to keep me really calm and it's it's as if like everything's really natural i felt
S0002	mine have a lisp and i can't figure out what he's say half the time
S0002	which be not helpful and then he think i'm not listen and he shout at me and i'm like i don't know what you're say
S0018	oh no
S0002	but i mean i like him and he i feel like he push me but he's quite critical if i mess up i mean how many lessons have you have
S0018	three
S0002	oh you're ever
S0018	yeah in my life
S0002	oh okay
S0018	this be my third one i have two this week and one last week
S0002	blimey and you're enjoy it though
S0018	yeah actually while i'm actually in the lesson with him it come quite naturally and it's not as
S0002	do you get work up before the lessons
S0018	yeah quite a little bite
S0002	yeah i do too
S0018	he tell me that i be gonna be drive on the the day before yesterday he tell me right tomorrow i'm take you out on the you'll be do forty miles an hour in fourth gear or something and i be like oh my life
S0002	already
S0018	crikey
S0002	and it be alright
S0018	yeah it be fine there weren't many cars on the road it wasn't rush hour but he say next he say next lesson if your neck's okay because in my second lesson he take me around quite a quiet er residential area that have load of speed bump
S0002	oh yeah
S0018	and you know i've get problems with my neck
S0002	yeah
S0018	well oh the day after i be like
S0002	ff
S0018	like today we're gonna do emergency stop i be like no no no
S0002	already
S0018	no i can't do it i'm gonna
S0002	already
S0018	mm he he push me
S0002	that's really quick
S0018	he push me quite quickly
S0002	okay maybe i need to change instructors
S0018	well i be think if you're get er you're travel over to your parent to have this guy
S0002	yeah
S0018	well why don't you just catch the number one bus get off in and he'll pick you up in cos i can't
S0002	don't they normally pick you up from most place though
S0018	no well he only work the south of he wouldn't he wouldn't travel
S0002	the thing be that i'm i've be drive around the test centre roads near my parents' house and it's get a higher pass rate than the ones near here because it's quiet it's a quiet very very quiet area
S0018	i don't understand higher what
S0002	um so um different test centre have different pass rat and i've be practise around the roads around the test centre that i would go do my test at
S0018	ah
S0002	so i wanna stay in that area because i know it otherwise i'll have to learn a whole new area for the test
S0018	ah okay i see
S0002	so i've have like sixteen lessons so i'm
S0018	oh quite advance
S0002	probably about ten lessons away from take my test i'd say
S0018	ah
S0002	i haven't do many manoeuvre i haven't do an emergency stop i've only do bay park like reverse back park i don't even know what that's call which be not a good thing
S0018	gosh i've not even yeah no i haven't even do a reverse
S0002	i didn't do that until like my tenth lesson or so
S0018	what be you do for your first three or four lessons
S0002	drive drive drive get use to the car get it all sort of automatic in my head
S0018	yeah you see i i don't feel that i've have enough of that i don't feel automatic enough when i'm change gear and
S0002	oh i'm only there now and it's seventeen lessons later and now i feel it's quite natural to do everything i'm not think about it i'm not look at the gear stick i'm not look at my speed it's all sort of just
S0018	oh okay
S0002	but it's take a long time
S0018	and how much do you pay per lessons
S0002	ninety two quid for five lessons five hours
S0018	so that's eighteen quid an hour
S0002	yeah
S0018	yeah i'm pay about seventeen i pay a hundred and seventy for ten lessons yeah
S0002	mm that's alright
S0018	oo and have you start revise your highway code
S0002	i've pass my theory
S0018	oh have you
S0002	yeah i pass it um in january
S0018	ah
S0002	but i'm take a big long break now so i don't
S0018	mm
S0002	i'm gonna have to come back and sort of get back onto it i really just wanna get it out the way
S0018	when how do you do the theory then do you just apply to do it
S0002	you just apply online and pay online and you can reserve any date and there's a test centre in the middle of town
S0018	uh huh
S0002	near argos
S0018	uh huh
S0002	and you just go in and do it and yeah it be alright i er literally kinda read the highway code the day before
S0018	really
S0002	yeah and didn't i didn't think i be gonna pass
S0018	but do have you learn a lot from the drive that you'd do
S0002	no and i'm one of these people that actually have no common sense sometimes and don't understand the like my friends er most of my friends drive and pass their test when they be like eighteen and they're all like test me a while ago and they be like how do you not know this it's common sense and i be like i just don't know i never pay any attentions when i be in a car with anyone like i don't really care about i didn't really care about drive never really want to pass so i wasn't really interest but it wasn't i think i be lucky and my test be not a hard one
S0018	oh okay what kind of
S0002	it depend on what you get
S0018	what kind of question come up
S0002	the usual like what's this sign mean what's this speed limit the the the worst part be the hazard perception part which be you watch the video and then you have to click when you see a hazard and it only mark you on two and if you have to click within a second to get the full point so if you click a little bite too late you lose all those point and that's quite difficult when i do all the practice for that i fail it every single time but somehow in the actual test i pass it
S0018	oh right and what kind of hazard come up
S0002	just for example if so you're watch a video and your car's travel down a road and you're look out for people step onto the road or something that might the thing be there be lot of things that can develop into a hazard
S0018	mm
S0002	like someone who's walk along the pavement might suddenly step onto the road but you don't get you don't get mark on see a potential hazard you get mark on see a hazard when it occur
S0018	okay
S0002	so i'm just like click click
S0002	click click
S0002	click click click click like it's just yeah um and the best hint that somebody give me for the hazard for the hazard perception be you see a hazard click wait two second click again because if you didn't if you click it too quickly you'd lose the point
S0018	oh okay
S0002	so make sure you do it twice at least when you see the hazard and then you've get a better chance of get some point for it rather than just
S0018	oh no
S0002	do it once so
S0018	didn't the theory test use to be just a few question ask by the by the tester when you be do your
S0002	you still have some question ask by the by the drive instructor on your
S0018	really
S0002	yeah but it's more about the car
S0018	okay
S0002	like you have to lift up the bonnet and say what's what and stuff like yeah
S0018	no
S0002	yeah yeah yeah just little just little just like three or four question
S0018	oh my life
S0002	nothing major i know it feel like a very high hill to climb to pass
S0018	mm
S0002	i mean cos they say like on average you take as many lessons as your age that's a lot of er lessons and a lot of money
S0018	oh crikey
S0002	and i'm just like uh
S0018	i've never hear that one
S0002	god cos like most of my friends keep go oh i pass in like twenty lessons which be actually probably a big lie
S0002	i would say i don't think most people could pass in er not unless they're drive someone else's car all the time but you don't even do manoeuvre until like
S0018	yeah yeah yeah that's the thing i'm not have any practice outside of the lessons
S0002	i neither be i so it's just the lessons and that's quite a big ask
S0018	yeah
S0002	so
S0018	how old be you
S0002	twenty eight
S0018	how many lessons have you have
S0002	seventeen
S0018	oh well eleven more
S0002	i think i'll need a few more to be honest
S0018	i'll see i'm just happy to be er
S0002	do it
S0018	yeah i've dream about it so many time that i've be drive
S0002	wow
S0018	and it's always be such a huge thing er when i wake up i'm like oh my oh my gosh i be drive in my sleep i'm like
S0002	how quickly do you wanna do it
S0018	um i've
S0002	not bother
S0018	i'm er not rush i'm not i don't need a car i don't want to have a car even
S0002	yeah yeah
S0018	i'd prefer to live in a nice little city that's get good public transport
S0002	me too i don't want a car at all
S0018	but i just think it would it's a good idea to
S0002	it's good to have it right
S0018	take advantage of this time
S0002	yeah that's the same
S0018	also if there's any job that come up that require
S0002	that you need to drive
S0018	a drive licence
S0002	yeah this be what i think it be just like it's just something it's one of my friends break her leg in japan and i be just think neither me or my boyfriend can drive if one of us could drive we could help her out
S0018	mm
S0002	and it's just such a shame when you're like okay we can't help anyone can't do anything
S0018	yeah yeah
S0002	and it would just be useful to to be able to hire a car sometimes to sort something out
S0018	yeah
S0002	and so yeah so yeah kind of just wanna get it out of the way and it be suppose to be a competition between me and my boyfriend who would do it first but he hasn't even start his lessons
S0002	he seem to think he can do it in a month i've be drive since last october i'm like really good luck mate
S0002	and in japan they don't let you practise on the road
S0018	right
S0002	they practise in a little grid area in the back of a test centre
S0018	actually do you know what i think i'd prefer to do that for the first
S0002	for the first one or two
S0018	first few lessons just to get confident to know what you're deal with mechanically in the car
S0002	yeah
S0018	not i mean tut not bonnet and explain what's go on but what you have to do in order to change gear what you have to do in order to stop at a junction and it would be a lot easier to do that without a lot easier to get automatic without with that without worry about
S0002	without worry about the road
S0018	oh there's someone follow me i bet they're think bloody learner driver
S0002	yes yeah i've develop this like my er drive instructor call it a mouse sound
S0002	instead of swear when i'm drive i always just go eek eek
S0002	and he's just like stop it stop it and i'm like you don't understand how much i would be swear if i wasn't do that though
S0018	well i say i think i say bloody
S0018	and then i say oh excuse my french and he say don't worry i use to be a builder
S0018	there use to never
S0002	hear it all
S0018	be a sentence without a swear word
S0002	yeah he say my drive instructor be like i would prefer that you just swear instead of make that stupid noise and i be like okay actually last week we go out with my dad in the back cos my parent just buy a new car and they put me on the insurance but i haven't drive it yet because i'm terrify cos it's a new car
S0018	mm
S0002	and i don't wanna just drive it into a wall and then my drive instructor be like i'll take you out and your dad can sit in the back so he can see how much instruction you still need and he can er
S0018	uh huh
S0002	so i mean i drive it fine it no major incident but i just keep squeak
S0002	because like the clutch and everything be so different on a different car
S0018	really
S0002	and it be i be just like couldn't feel the bite properly and just really jerky and slow come out of corner and my dad be just like you're very safe just like your mother
S0002	you're very safe and slow just like your mother
S0002	and my drive instructor get all defensive for me he be like no she's do really well you should praise her more and i be just like oh god i feel like i'm
S0018	aw
S0002	twelve in the middle like
S0018	aw well at least he sound like he's get some nice word for you as well i think he be
S0002	yeah he's
S0018	just shout at you all the time
S0002	not all the time eighty percent of the time
S0002	yeah
S0018	i mean i'd just jump if he shout at me
S0002	i cry once in the car and i think he sort of come off it a little bite
S0018	really
S0002	after that
S0018	why what happen
S0002	he just be yell and i be already really upset cos i think i'd come out of the the house after a fight with my mum and i be already like just tire and and i and he be like you're a danger on the road
S0018	no
S0002	and then he be like pull over and then i just be like i'm try really hard and he be just like okay
S0018	oh no
S0002	and he sort of stop a little bite after that he's not as bad anymore
S0018	that's the whole thing about learner drivers they're they're learn how not to be a danger on the road
S0002	i know yeah
S0018	like yeah call a spade a spade why don't you
S0002	i know er the thing be i've be look for another instructor cos i just you know i wanna see if it's different with a different drive instructor
S0018	mm
S0002	but it seem really hard to find someone good
S0018	well why don't you just have like a few lessons with my with my instructor cos honestly he's so he put you at your ease
S0002	but it's just the whole
S0018	i can't believe i'm confident
S0002	i don't i really don't wanna take my test somewhere else
S0018	but you won't wouldn't have to just have a few lessons
S0002	but you have to have that driver's car
S0018	yes i know
S0002	and that instructor
S0018	but you could go back you could go back to your instructor
S0002	oh right to do my test
S0018	yeah just i think
S0002	yeah
S0018	it might be it might be a good thing just to have experience with someone else in the car just to prepare you for your test as well
S0002	that's true actually yeah i've actually get a groupon voucher six three lessons for six quid which have be sit on my table for age i should probably just phone them up and use it
S0018	yeah you see i be i there be there be le le le le there be quite a few drive school in my area that do er lessons
S0002	stuff like that
S0018	for eight pound and stuff and i'm think mm do i want to go with a drive instructor who be work as part of a franchise and probably get pay
S0002	yeah
S0018	ten p an hour
S0002	yeah yeah
S0018	be he gonna be happy in his job no i think
S0002	that's true
S0018	i'd prefer to go with the guy who's get his own business and he's relax and
S0002	yeah these guy have their own business i find them on groupon actually
S0018	really
S0002	yeah they be they be pretty they've get a good pass rate but that's probably just cos they whip their students
S0002	until they pass the damn thing so
S0018	you will pass your test
S0018	you will bring shame onto our drive school if you don't
S0002	it seem like that
S0018	gosh
S0002	yeah i know i probably should try a few others
S0018	and just out of interest how much extra do it cost your parent to put you on their
S0002	three hundred
S0018	three hundred quid
S0002	for a year
S0018	pff
S0002	for a brand new fiesta
S0018	right
S0002	it's not that bad
S0018	yeah okay
S0002	it sound a lot but most people be like only three hundred
S0018	really
S0002	when i tell them yeah
S0018	you see tut
S0002	that sound like a huge amount of money though
S0018	that's like a bus pass for the whole year
S0002	yeah i know no you're right it be and i've drive it like twice and it's not i need to drive it more to really sort of get some money's worth but i'm terrify cos it's a new car
S0018	yeah
S0002	like i have all these lessons and then i get i go in the car in the new car with my dad and the drive instructor last week and i be er literally shake
S0018	mm
S0002	and my drive instructor be just like what's wrong with you like
S0002	you're not normally like this and i be like i just don't wanna ruin the car like
S0018	aw
S0002	but they're not really my it be suppose to be for my mum the car but my mum doesn't drive very much anymore so in fact she didn't even wanna drive it at the begin because she couldn't get use to it
S0018	mm
S0002	so i'm just like well should've somebody should really drive this car like
S0018	do your dad choose it or do your mum choose it
S0002	my dad choose it
S0018	why didn't he let your mum choose it cos surely
S0002	cos he's a numpty
S0002	wonder how often that'll come up in a corpus search
S0018	he's a numpty
S0018	hm yeah my my mum have to go and er my dad be complain about it actually she he say she have to go and sit in about fifty different seat and test the cars and
S0002	that's fine you should find a car that you're my dad buy the first car he saw
S0018	ah
S0002	that's not clever at all but um yeah it's a nice car it's it's a poser car a little bite it's bright red
S0018	oh no
S0002	i know
S0018	it's just like have a
S0002	it's like hello i'm here and like
S0018	yeah it's like have a big finger point at you
S0002	basically
S0018	all the time
S0002	but in a way it's good because i use to never be able to find them in a park lot because they have a silver car and there's so many silver cars
S0002	and now it's just like there they be
S0002	like i can see them a mile away it's so bright
S0018	what kind of car be it
S0002	it's a fiesta it's like a new fiesta titanium thing they're really nice but the one thing i don't like about it be the dashboard it come like basically the front of the car be really small and the engine be build into the dashboard and the front
S0018	mhm
S0002	so the dashboard come really far down in front of you so you feel a little bite cramp in the front which be not really great and it's so like every mod con like voice activate it talk back at you
S0018	it's like kitt car
S0002	it be basically and i'm just like do you really need all of this my dad's like oh we'll learn how to use it he hasn't even open the manual so
S0018	so what what can you command it to do by voice
S0002	so it's all auto like all the light it will it will dim and the light and the windscreen wipers be auto and you can tell it like i'd like the car to be this temperature and it will set the temperature for you what else can you make it do you can make it do quite a lot you can make it phone people like er you know
S0002	er you can make it you can put it onto auto like cruise er through voice activation yeah it's kind of weird actually it's like
S0018	no wonder no wonder the dashboard come up to your face
S0002	i know
S0018	it's it need a brain
S0002	it's like a rocket
S0018	and have you try night drive
S0002	um i have one lesson at night two lessons at night
S0018	be that a lot different from drive during the day
S0002	it's not that bad actually
S0018	really
S0002	um i think it would be terrify but it be pretty just pretty much the same just you can see
S0018	cos i don't know whether my eye be sensitive to light but you know those um headlights
S0002	mm
S0018	that be really kind of like
S0002	bright
S0018	bright blue
S0002	oh yeah
S0018	white they they leave such a trace on my vision
S0002	mm
S0018	that er but but it doesn't seem to be so intense for other people i'm just wonder whether i've get particularly sensitive eye
S0002	have you ever have it check
S0018	yeah i've have my eyesight i've never have any problems with my eyesight apart from be er maybe a bite light sensitive
S0002	be there special things glass you can wear for that
S0018	yeah i'll just look really cool all the time
S0002	yeah
S0018	with my sunglasses and
S0002	with my shade in the night
S0002	that's proper knight rider
S0018	yeah i'm too cool
S0002	yeah i mean
S0018	i dunno
S0018	i'd like to end up in a little city and be able to walk to work or catch a bus
S0002	you wanna stay in the uk
S0018	if it's cold do i want to no not particularly if there be mediterranean weather here yes
S0002	so er
S0018	but at the moment all i want be you know a bite of stability
S0002	yeah
S0018	and a stable income
S0002	but when you say i want to end up do that mean that could be anywhere you're open to end up anywhere or be you kind of
S0018	i'm open to end up anywhere as long as there's a way of er support myself
S0002	stability
S0018	and financial independence
S0002	stable job
S0018	cos that be the worst thing about spain you never know when they be
S0002	how much you be gonna earn
S0018	go yeah well you never know how much you be gonna get earn month to month you never know when they be go to turn around and tell you that your contract have be terminate
S0002	yeah
S0018	just because they want to save a bite of money but you could still carry on work there it's just you wouldn't be work with a contract
S0002	mm
S0018	and so that mean no
S0002	spain be
S0018	healthcare
S0002	yeah
S0018	no
S0002	i understand
S0018	unemployment benefit in case you lose your job and
S0002	that's what i be like in japan but i be self employ so i bring that upon myself but get a good job that have a proper full time contract actually i be work for the british council before i come out here come back here not out here um
S0002	and um recently they contact me and say oh we've get full time job and i work for them for quite a long time hop and pray that the day would come that they would say we have full time job cos it's the kind of place that no one will ever leave
S0018	yeah
S0002	and suddenly they come up with four full time job se and i be just like
S0018	in japan
S0002	yes i be really angry
S0018	yeah
S0002	but then i look at the condition and i be like nah i earnt more when i be self employ so
S0018	mm
S0002	and i have more flexibility could do what i want take a holiday when i want it just depend what you want i suppose
S0018	mm yep well that's the thing i've do the whole
S0002	flexible
S0018	be flexible earn very little money but still have a great life
S0002	mm
S0018	but live with the restrictions of not know when you're gonna have holiday not know when you're gonna be able to afford to buy the thing
S0002	yeah
S0018	if the fridge break down
S0002	yeah then you're screw
S0018	oh
S0002	the the thing be that i be er part of a two income household and
S0018	mm
S0002	it be even my boyfriend's job be not a hundred percent stable but between the two of us or even one of us could cover the rent if the other one go out of work so we have we have that to help so that make it better for me because i i ideally want to go back to work part time and self employ when i have kid so it kind of suit me in a way but if it wasn't in that but even then even when i be single i be quite happy work part time
S0018	yeah
S0002	i dunno
S0018	it would be great to be able to earn full earn part time wag and be able to live off them but i just think the price of the
S0002	i think in spain that's very hard
S0018	oh it's impossible yeah but the price of life
S0002	in japan
S0018	be just horrendous and
S0002	i use to make for one lesson er so i work for a little i work for british council and i work for a little college
S0018	mhm
S0002	and they would term employ you per term but if you do one term you be fairly guarantee to get the next term and in fact they'll keep you for as long as you want but the their whole thing be that they wouldn't employ anyone with enough class for them to rely on that
S0018	okay
S0002	on them
S0018	yep
S0002	so they have a maximum of eight class but if you do eight class during the day so decent work hours that be two hundred two hundred thousand yen which be like
S0018	and how much be your rent
S0002	my rent between two thirty thousand each
S0018	uh huh two hundred i'm try to
S0002	it's about come up to two thousand eight hundred a month
S0018	mhm
S0002	which be as much as most people make full time
S0018	mm
S0002	sometimes so even that be enough to sort of keep me tick over um the average rent in tokyo be about eighty to ninety thousand
S0018	right
S0002	but a hundred thousand a month will quite happily clothe fee party whatever you wanna do
S0002	it's quite a decent amount of money but like you say if anything happen
S0018	yeah
S0002	you need to go home or something break down then yeah it's a problem
S0018	mm
S0002	but yeah
S0018	but it just seem here even um the one of the newly qualify teachers at my er at the school i be in before december she be struggle on a teach salary okay she'd start off on the the lowest
S0002	what be the lowest eighteen
S0018	twenty two eight hundred
S0002	i think the cost of live in the uk be extortionate
S0018	it have go up so much
S0002	yeah cos
S0018	but it's the same in spain it's it's comparable in spain now but salaries be so much lower
S0002	yeah
S0018	but here it's yeah the fuel bill supermarket bill
S0002	just things like council tax and stuff
S0018	mm
S0002	be so expensive
S0018	yeah
S0002	i dunno i suppose it's expensive everywhere the only thing in japan that's not expensive be food
S0018	really
S0002	everything else be expensive but food be important food eat up a lot of your bill to be honest like
S0002	i always feel like i spend a fortune here on food
S0018	you're suppose to eat it yeah me too i use to go to the market and stuff you could get like like your whole rolly bag trolley
S0002	yeah full
S0018	fill
S0002	yeah
S0018	with fruit and vegetable for pff ten euros
S0002	ten quid ten yeah yeah
S0018	that would last you more than a week
S0002	not here
S0018	well i can't believe it it's like oo slap a price on it what shall we say a quid okay one pound for a tiny little bag of spinach
S0002	it's really expensive
S0018	it be it's
S0002	if you wanna eat well it's really expensive
S0018	stupid which be why you need a job that pay at least at least thirty grand i think to be able to have
S0002	there be not many job that pay thirty grand
S0018	i know
S0002	i don't know if i even wanna live in this country to be honest i don't not i dunno i wouldn't mm not convince about the quality of life here to be honest
S0018	no me either i just think that from what compare to you know i'd like to live in spain again but compare to spain it's just there be no possibility of earn a live wage there
S0002	yeah
S0018	and there be an a possibility of do that here so
S0002	here yeah
S0018	but obviously cos you
S0002	you wanna stay in europe
S0018	um
S0002	would you ever look further afield
S0018	i don't know because i i move to france and live in france and then i move to spain and live in spain i've in my adult life i've always live abroad
S0002	yeah
S0018	and know what tut know how much effort it take not just effort but how much time it take to feel like you've settle into a new culture and
S0002	yeah i understand
S0018	a new language and to a new way of do things i think maybe i'm i'm too not too old but i'm too
S0002	just exhaust by the whole thing
S0018	yeah
S0002	yeah i mean i get that too
S0018	it's comfort in a way be back in the country where you know i speak the language um you know
S0002	everything you can function in every single way
S0018	yeah
S0002	there be no limitation
S0018	exactly
S0002	yeah no i understand that
S0018	but no i wouldn't um rule out live in another country but i think when when you're in your thirties you start think a lot more in term of your family and
S0002	mm
S0018	put down root and and if you can't do that and survive basically be able
S0002	yeah
S0018	to support yourself and if if you can't do that that's when you start get anxious and uh i just want it i just want a quiet life
S0018	i don't wanna earn too much money i don't wanna earn
S0002	just wanna be comfortable without worry about money
S0018	definitely like one little summer holiday a year and just enough to pay your rent or oo a mortgage now that would be see most of the you know you can't get a mortgage on a single
S0002	yeah
S0018	person's salary
S0002	that's true
S0018	unless you're earn over thirty grand and even earn over thirty grand you'll have problems get a mortgage
S0002	i just think the house crisis be disgust here
S0018	yeah
S0002	like i mean pff it's so expensive
S0018	yeah
S0002	i be in teach on monday and
S0018	oh yeah
S0002	the the family that i the the woman that i teach be a housewife but her husband's do an mba here they're japanese and um they're rent a very nice townhouse flat
S0018	mhm
S0002	and i be just curious cos i be like oh this be somewhere that i can imagine that me and my boyfriend might end up live at some point so i look it up and i look up the oh my goodness if you want to buy one of the flats it be two hundred and seventy five thousand
S0018	oh
S0002	and i'm like they're not they're nice they're new but it's a flat and it's small
S0018	yeah
S0002	and it's far away
S0018	but it's
S0002	from the city centre
S0018	but it's also i think
S0002	i know 's expensive
S0018	yeah
S0002	but that's just insanely expensive
S0018	it be it be
S0002	a one bedroom flat for two hundred and seventy five
S0018	crazy but for example my friends be look to buy they're live in rent at the moment but 's too expensive for them to buy in and they're look at which be right you know five minute drive down the road and the comparison price difference be
S0002	be so
S0018	enormous
S0002	different
S0018	i mean they're look at um two bedroomed house er semi detach or terrace or and in you're look at um two hundred and forty two hundred and fifty thousand and in you're look at one hundred and sixty
S0002	oh okay
S0018	one hundred and seventy
S0002	there's a big difference then
S0018	really big difference so i imagine in harborne it's the same
S0002	but i mean er we be look at buy um before we rent we recently move to a new flat in tokyo and before we rent that place we be look at house we be look at buy and you can buy a brand new house in tokyo have it develop to how you want it the thing that's expensive be land but probably all in for a two three bedroom three three level house probably about three hundred thousand pound but we're talk in the middle of a metropolitan city
S0018	yeah yeah yeah
S0002	and that's not bad
S0018	especially when salaries sound to be better
S0002	yeah they be a bite better so we be like well it would make a lot of sense but we don't know where we're gonna end up
S0018	so where why do you say that you don't know if you wanna live in japan cos i i think you seem quite enamour by it all
S0002	no i mean i like it but i don't the idea of spend a long time there doesn't appeal
S0018	be that in light of what happen last year with the earthquake and the nuclear
S0002	it's a little bite about that um a little bite about the earthquake a little bite just about bring up a family there
S0018	mm
S0002	um and be away from my family
S0018	mm
S0002	i want like i the thing that fill me with terror which be me get way ahead of myself of course but i don't wanna have a child and be away from my mum
S0018	mm
S0002	and not only be away but be an ocean
S0002	a thirteen hour plane ride away
S0018	exactly it be so far isn't it
S0002	it's really far and i don't think that his family be gonna really be that involve in our live
S0018	mhm
S0002	so i just i just want a support network as i get older
S0018	yeah
S0002	and as they get older i'm worry about my parent too
S0018	yep that be one of the decide factor in me er in my come home as well
S0002	yeah
S0018	especially with all the injuries i have it be just so much easier have be able to rely on people in case
S0002	mm
S0018	all of a sudden you've you can't
S0002	yeah you can't
S0018	rely on your body or something
S0002	yeah yeah and the other thing be there be still quite a big language barrier i mean i would have i feel like if i make a commitment to go back i would have to go back to language school
S0018	mhm
S0002	just to improve my speak but i'm always gonna be have the huge barrier of read and write
S0018	yeah
S0002	because that be not something you can make up that's like prr ten years i would say to become
S0018	yep
S0002	get to a point where you can sort of get by
S0018	yeah
S0002	so that's a huge thing be feel like i live on a periphery of a society and i've that's okay when you're just not visit but
S0018	yeah
S0002	it's temporary but if that be to somehow become permanent i don't know how well i would do with that you know
S0018	it do leave you feel slightly marginalize doesn't it
S0002	and yeah er i'm not the brightest when it come to languages they're pretty hard like
S0002	especially japanese
S0018	such a difficult language though surely there's different alphabet
S0002	school's expensive too it's like a hundred and sixty thousand for three months
S0018	oo ff
S0002	that's like three four four hours tuition a day and i be do that and work eight hours a day at the same time so i probably didn't get as much of it as out of it as i should've
S0018	mm
S0002	but it be just so expensive i don't know how people afford it and everyone else there be a full time student there be me like beaver away at work and do homework and do class and just like huh can't do this it's exhaust like
S0018	yeah
S0002	it's fun but it's exhaust like and like why do you fail the test cos i didn't have time to study like
S0018	yeah i don't think teachers be the best students
S0002	students
S0018	either
S0002	no definitely not
S0018	i hate
S0002	learn that on this degree
S0018	yeah i hate study and i hate have homework to do i don't mind work late i don't mind in a job do a lot of work
S0002	but actually study
S0018	but actually oh and exams and urgh
S0002	yeah it's pretty brutal i have test every week when i be on that course i have test almost every day actually for the character
S0018	mhm
S0002	and it be just like i couldn't get them into my head
S0018	mm
S0002	and it be just you know it be really hard i just can't imagine get to the point where i can say you know what i can manage now i know enough japanese to really get by i can't imagine ever get to that point and i don't want my kid to be run circle round me like linguistically
S0002	like that would be not good
