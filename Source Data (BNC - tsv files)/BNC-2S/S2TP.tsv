S0320	ooh let's have a look then
S0321	okay so this be the plan
S0320	oh wow look at that
S0321	it's quite big actually
S0320	what your allotment or the plan
S0321	yeah a bite well both
S0321	it's not to scale erm so the gate would be here
S0320	okay
S0321	and then
S0320	be it all fence off then
S0321	so there's a fence round the outside
S0320	be there
S0321	yeah
S0320	oh that's very london
S0321	erm
S0321	well yeah there's a gate with a padlock
S0320	be there
S0321	and but that's cos so the allotments be all dot around er this estate so there's mine be here there's one behind
S0320	mm
S0321	and then there's two next to us so
S0320	okay
S0321	so erm the gate's here
S0320	cos the allotment's down my parents' allotment be there's no gate so it's all just
S0321	they yeah
S0320	open
S0321	there be they have those in london too with like a big fence around the outside
S0320	oh yeah er
S0321	yeah
S0320	there's no fence in
S0321	yeah
S0320	in
S0320	okay so the gate's here
S0321	erm you know i leave mine unlock most of the time because it's i feel like people can enjoy if they want to
S0320	oh
S0321	the gate's here and i be quite lucky that there be several raise bed there already
S0320	okay
S0321	these three be like really big robust good raise bed
S0320	okay yeah
S0321	erm and then there's this one which be a bite rickety but it would do
S0320	okay
S0321	and then there's
S0320	so have you get like wooden like board around the
S0321	yeah they're about they're about
S0320	the
S0321	half a metre high
S0320	oh be they
S0321	yeah they're they're
S0320	oh quite high then
S0321	and deep
S0320	yeah
S0321	like my biggest problem at the moment be i need to fill them with compost and manure and i need
S0320	ah
S0321	tons of it
S0320	yeah
S0321	erm i've find a stable where i can get some free manure but
S0321	i haven't be haven't be to dig it yet erm so yeah these three be raise bed
S0320	yeah
S0321	erm then there's one that's like small concrete and like it's
S0320	oh
S0321	the the
S0320	around the outside
S0321	yeah it's just
S0320	oh
S0321	pave slabs like they're only like
S0320	that's odd
S0321	twenty centimetres high yeah and i mean someone's basically stick sort of pave slabs on their side along the boundaries
S0320	er yeah okay
S0321	of the bed to kind of keep it in
S0320	mm
S0321	erm and there's there's random pave slabs and the grind be actually particularly here be really
S0320	mm
S0321	uneven
S0320	okay
S0321	erm so what i'm gonna do yeah i've get three raise bed
S0320	yeah
S0321	one's gonna have salads in it
S0320	yeah
S0321	one's gonna have like spinach and chard and leafy things
S0320	wow
S0321	one's gonna have bean
S0320	yeah
S0321	erm and i'll put something else at different time of the year
S0320	yeah
S0321	and then this trough be gonna have edible flower
S0320	okay
S0321	and arables and nasturtiums
S0320	oh cool
S0321	and then all along this fence
S0320	mm
S0321	i'm gonna have raspberries
S0320	mm
S0321	so i've work out one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve plant
S0320	that's a lot of plant
S0321	i love raspberries
S0321	i'm gonna start jam make and then erm three gooseberries
S0320	yeah
S0321	two loganberries and two redcurrants
S0320	okay
S0321	erm so that's gonna be sort of my soft fruit area
S0320	mm
S0321	i've get a compost erm sort of wormery here
S0320	mm
S0321	here's my shed
S0320	okay
S0321	erm
S0320	have you replace the shed yet
S0321	no
S0320	be you gonna keep it
S0321	at the moment it's fine i need to reroof it
S0320	oh yeah
S0321	but
S0320	i remember you say
S0321	i would like to replace it with a half shed half greenhouse
S0320	oh cool
S0321	but i haven't get at the moment it's
S0320	oh
S0321	my contract i'm not allow
S0320	okay
S0321	a greenhouse
S0320	okay
S0321	but we're form this committee
S0320	yeah
S0321	and then we can kind of make up the rule
S0320	oh yes
S0321	so
S0320	i remember you tell me about that
S0321	i've get a rain butt next to the shed
S0320	okay
S0321	so in theory i want to do some rainwater collection i buy this off ebay for like
S0320	yeah yeah
S0321	a fiver and then erm
S0320	they sell them at the council in actually
S0321	oh
S0320	really big must no they're compost bin sorry
S0321	oh compost yeah
S0320	mm
S0321	but there well there be one of them there already actually
S0320	yeah
S0321	there's quite a few things there erm
S0320	be that a seat
S0321	yes but i think i i i guess i haven't make up my mind
S0320	you're gonna replace it with rhubarb
S0321	what to do
S0321	i think the rhubarb will go so i've get tyres
S0320	oh cool
S0321	i've get some tyres that i'm gonna put the rhubarb in
S0320	oh okay
S0321	so they're gonna act like raise bed
S0320	yeah
S0321	so they're gonna go there the strawberries which be already in and that's the first thing i've plant
S0320	oh brilliant
S0321	erm get my first chard harvest as well
S0320	wow
S0321	mm and then there'll be another bed for tomatoes here
S0320	tomatoes
S0321	mm
S0320	do tomatoes not need to be grow in quite warm temperatures
S0321	they're fine here
S0320	every time i've see tomatoes they've be in a greenhouse
S0321	don't need to be
S0320	really
S0321	yeah don't need to be at all
S0320	yeah cos my grandparents always put them and my next door neighbour
S0321	could grow them grow them here
S0320	who be old fashion
S0321	they grow better
S0320	oh okay maybe that's it
S0321	i mean and you get you you get more probably if you grow them in a greenhouse
S0320	and they always grow them out of growbags as well the ones i've see they have bag rather than
S0321	you can but if you've get er it's better to put them in the grind
S0320	mm
S0321	so i put them in the grind and then but you need to construct like support
S0320	yeah i be gonna say yeah
S0321	they need erm show me how to do it you need to if you you need like a cable hang down
S0320	okay
S0321	and then wrap it round the tomato
S0320	mm
S0321	so it's erm but like a string so it's flexible so it can move and grow with it
S0320	okay
S0321	erm so yeah and then a bed of courgettes
S0320	courgettes lovely
S0321	and then this be sort of a nondescript veg patch where i'll grow things like
S0320	i be look at that i be wonder if that be the for all of this so what other what other veg have you
S0321	not entirely
S0320	think of
S0321	sure yet erm but probably probably like quite seasonal stuff so i'll probably grow some
S0320	what about potatoes
S0321	i'm not sure i'd bother with potatoes
S0320	leeks
S0321	yeah maybe leeks maybe garlic
S0320	onions
S0321	maybe maybe onions but they're really hard to dry successfully although in this house it's so hot
S0320	you'd probably do it in a week
S0321	erm
S0321	er carrots
S0320	oh yes carrots
S0321	erm
S0320	what about something like turnips or no not turnips
S0321	no
S0320	squash how easy be it to grow squash
S0321	maybe squash yeah very easy actually yeah
S0320	mm
S0321	so i'll probably grow pumpkin so sort of seasonal things
S0320	sort of seasonal things yeah
S0321	yeah so i mean and that will be that's just sort of i mean it's quite a big area
S0320	cool
S0321	but i probably won't do it all at the moment this still have like metre high grass on it
S0320	oh do it
S0321	i find a door as well
S0320	do you
S0321	there's so much junk
S0320	oh
S0321	there be there be there's a shed here at the moment that's be remove
S0320	oh okay yeah
S0321	there be a small shed in this corner that i smash up on saturday
S0320	oh yeah
S0321	and then and there be so much junk inside it like i find erm a hoover from like the nineteen sixties like an old upright
S0320	do you
S0321	hoover i find so much junk i find so many shoe
S0320	do you
S0321	just yeah and this this be why i'm not gonna dig down any more i'm gonna go up
S0320	ah
S0321	because there's quite a lot of and it's also so the site where erm the whole estate be an old horse hospital and there's quite a lot of bone
S0320	an old horse
S0321	horse hospital
S0320	hospital
S0321	yeah they
S0320	just for horse
S0321	yeah from the from like army army horse from during the war
S0320	yeah no don't dig down any more then yeah
S0321	and i find quite a lot of bits of bone like it be a bite weird
S0320	ooh do you
S0321	yeah
S0320	yeah no just
S0321	erm
S0320	yeah yeah that's a really good idea
S0321	but this seat be gonna be like erm a swing seat
S0320	oh cool
S0321	that's what i really want anyway
S0320	yeah
S0321	may as well have it and then a little armchair and stave
S0320	so this be where you're gonna be walk when the baby arrive he's gonna get the pram and walk to the allotment
S0321	hopefully
S0320	how far away be it you say it be
S0321	it's about half an hour to walk
S0320	yeah that's about that's a good distance then
S0321	yeah erm
S0320	so it'll be it'll be summer
S0321	yeah i can
S0320	it'll be nice and warm
S0321	i mean i can drive in five minutes if i'm be lazy or get on the bike and it's almost erm it's almost all like er so off road cycle paths the whole way
S0320	oh cool
S0321	so you can walk or yeah so it's gonna be nice
S0320	so do you consult with on this
S0321	erm she have suggest some things but this
S0320	cos be there anything about erm plant so like all of the soft fruit be there anything about ones that can go next to each other and work together and that might fight with each other
S0321	erm berry be all fine
S0320	yeah
S0321	mix i mean you want to rotate so this be my first year plan
S0320	okay
S0321	and then i'll probably move everything on one bed for the follow year
S0320	every year
S0321	well these be all annuals
S0320	but you need to move them every year
S0321	you should do
S0320	my dad doesn't i think he do rotate them but i'm pretty sure it's not every year
S0321	but the other thing you can do if you don't do it then you just need to replace like put lot of manure
S0320	that's what he do
S0321	or do
S0320	he do it every year he get
S0321	green manure
S0320	yeah
S0321	which be clover so i try to plant clover in the rise bed this year
S0320	oh
S0321	but it i didn't get there in time and it didn't germinate but i get all these leave in this one
S0320	yeah
S0321	erm and i send the photo cos i be like these things
S0320	yeah
S0321	look like clover or what be it and er and i i try one cos it look like rocket but it wasn't rocket turn out it be poppies
S0320	poppies
S0321	yeah cos i have it
S0320	oh
S0321	in a so she give me a envelope full of
S0320	yeah
S0321	clover seed and also she they've get some amaze giant poppies
S0320	mm
S0321	at her farm
S0320	yeah
S0321	so she give me some of the head
S0320	okay
S0321	and i think that they must have fall in with the clover
S0320	ah
S0321	and they germinate and the clover didn't
S0320	oh how funny so you've get a bed full of poppies
S0321	i know which be not really where i want it cos it's in my salad bed
S0320	you you want it
S0321	i might have to have a half salad bed
S0320	ah
S0321	er the then at least if i get the poppy seed then i can move them and then
S0320	yeah
S0321	yeah
S0321	for next year so yeah i mean they'll be really beautiful so if that's what they be
S0320	yeah
S0321	but there's there's load there's like an area like that that's just
S0320	they're massive as well aren't they
S0321	thick
S0320	yeah
S0321	i mean at the moment they're just like they look like sort of little dandelion leave
S0320	okay
S0321	but they're slightly hairy i probably shouldn't have eat one
S0320	no probably not eh
S0321	yeah and tree
S0320	oh yeah
S0321	so i'm gonna put one here and one here
S0320	be these oh they're not there already
S0321	no there be a bite erm horse chestnut tree here
S0320	oh wow
S0321	erm like bite like the the erm the trunk be like half a metre diameter
S0320	oh my god
S0321	erm i quite want to keep it but the council say that it be above it be too big for the plot so i'm not allow
S0320	ah
S0321	tree more than twelve foot high
S0320	okay
S0321	erm and also they point out that it's it'll be sap all the
S0320	yeah
S0321	goodness from the land
S0320	yeah definitely if it's that big
S0321	there be one here and one here so
S0320	yeah
S0321	this they be both cut down
S0320	yeah
S0321	but it mean that they've leave quite nice stump for sit on as well
S0320	oh cool
S0321	erm so yeah they're sort of around here
S0320	yeah
S0321	but and i haven't quite decide what tree
S0320	apple tree
S0321	i keep uming and ahing
S0320	pear tree
S0321	i think i think pear i don't eat enough pears
S0320	apples
S0321	to warrant a pear tree but i think apples could be good but maybe a mix variety tree cos you can get them where
S0320	mm
S0321	they've get different varieties graft on
S0320	oh
S0321	so you get it like like two or three different varieties because also you have to be careful about erm self pollinate tree
S0320	yeah i remember have a lecture from my dad it's all so very complicate
S0321	yeah
S0320	which tree you put next to each other so that they
S0321	yeah on the
S0320	yeah
S0321	on the royal horticultural society website
S0320	yeah
S0321	there's like a cross pollinator finder because not all breed
S0320	ah
S0321	of apples will will cross pollinate other
S0320	okay
S0321	so you need to get two you either need to get one that's self fertile
S0320	yeah
S0321	or get two or get
S0320	okay
S0321	a tree that's get two that be complementary graft on
S0320	mm
S0321	the same
S0320	okay
S0321	you can actually get a mix apple and pear tree as well
S0320	that sound a really
S0321	which i be think of
S0320	weird
S0321	sound really weird i know i didn't like that
S0320	it sound really odd
S0321	yeah
S0321	and then i be think should i go for something more interest for the other like a fig or a plum or a cherry but cherries grow very big if they're good
S0320	okay
S0321	so i'm not sure but
S0320	yeah you want something that's not go to cause problems for all the rest of the vegetables i suppose
S0321	no and you know it will it will shade part
S0320	mm
S0321	cos at the moment i've just get a full sun plot
S0320	yeah
S0321	there's no area
S0320	mm
S0321	that's not sunny
S0320	mm
S0321	erm at all except for i guess right in front of the shed
S0320	yeah
S0321	but where i get this plan from
S0320	mm
S0321	what i be work on this book call the half hour allotment
S0321	so the theory be that you if you set up your allotment right with
S0320	mm
S0321	the right plant you can get yourself food every week of the year
S0320	oh wow
S0321	and erm you only have to go be it it's half an hour like four time a week or something
S0320	oh cool
S0321	or you could condense that into longer slot at
S0320	yeah
S0321	the weekend so it but there's a lot of set up
S0320	yeah
S0321	and then the theory be all you need to do be pop up and weed
S0320	brilliant
S0321	do a bite of water but actually like the guy in the plot next to me say he doesn't water
S0320	okay
S0321	what he do for his raise bed which he make all himself erm he put cardboard down just straight onto the grass
S0320	mm
S0321	and then manure and compost on top of that
S0320	okay
S0321	and because the cardboard be so wet and
S0320	mm
S0321	retain the moisture he hasn't water all summer
S0320	wow
S0321	and he's get some
S0320	so there be
S0321	he's still get sunflowers in his bite and it's
S0320	oh really
S0321	november it's crazy yeah
S0320	so he just put his bed on top of the grass then
S0321	yeah
S0320	he didn't dig them over or anything
S0321	no he go up i mean and most people
S0320	i mean that's interest
S0321	because of all the bone
S0320	yeah of course
S0321	have not dig down they've go they've go up instead
S0320	yeah no fair enough wow
S0321	but yeah so
S0320	that's really excite
S0321	yeah yeah i don't think i'll get it all this year though
S0320	erm
S0321	half of it
S0320	yeah no maybe not
S0321	no
S0320	it look like a longer project
