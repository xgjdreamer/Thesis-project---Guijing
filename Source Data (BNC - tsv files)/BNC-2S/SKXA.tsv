S0618	minus two point five it's quite warm actually actually
S0619	how much do you hate your glass steam up
S0618	i know i couldn't agree more and what i find really hard this time of year be decide do i want to pull up my scarf so my chin bottom part of my face

S0619	i've never ever have them i've only have glass for two years
S0618	oh
S0619	so
S0618	i have glass well i've have them for nearly thirty years now but erm i get contact when i go to australia and new zealand

S0618	and i want to swim and yeah i wanna be able to see all the colourful pretty little fish and things erm so i get them and i start with monthlies and it take a long time to get use to them but i do and then i find i couldn't really cope with the waste with fluid and keep buy fluid
S0619	mm hm
S0618	and then it go off and then you go abroad and then you need to buy some more and blah blah blah seem like a lot of waste so now i have daily disposables

S0619	he do he do he do
S0618	he do he say turn right and now he say go back the way you've just come that's really annoy oh jeez he want us to go back on the street that we be on before erm i wonder if i can turn leave here and then come back down the other way

S0619	well we can just use it to turn around and then just go back out

S0618	i do forget that on narrow roads sometimes
S0619	yeah it's all
S0618	yeah
S0619	the bloody same isn't it right so we're go right and then leave
S0618	we're go right then leave
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah i think go right should be easy enough cos we're sort of with the traffic cos it's on the right and then
S0619	yeah and on the leave there should be traffic light
S0618	there should be a filter yeah
S0619	oh it's all go very well
S0618	ah
S0619	mm garden centre shop look nice

S0618	old woman and it's this leave isn't it
S0619	i once oh a sunday have
S0618	give way to the bmw cos they're scary
S0619	i
S0618	and turn here

S0618	oh my god
S0619	sideways you know
S0618	yeah
S0619	it's just
S0618	domestic bliss
S0619	i just don't have time for these nightclubs the promiscuity any more i just want the simple things in life
S0618	you might have a second wind where that's concern
S0619	yeah
S0618	cos i didn't really do it in my teenage years i think cos i didn't go to uni and didn't go well i go to sixth form for a term and hat it and leave erm so because i didn't really do that i didn't really have that drink party lifestyle
S0619	yeah
S0618	and then when i be about twenty eight i start well party basically for a few years and it be fantastic
S0619	yeah maybe i will
S0618	yeah
S0619	cos i do sort of eighteen to twenty one twenty two solidly
S0618	yeah that's plenty surely
S0619	yeah with intermittent you know action and
S0618	detox break
S0619	er yes erm
S0618	yeah
S0619	but it'll come again but i think you like in my sort of good time in the good time when i'm sort of be a healthy person like you've gotta fuck ride with it as much as you can
S0618	alright shush it's only just go green for goodness sake oh where be they all go
S0618	can i actually drive on this bite of road yeah i can i get a little bite alarm when there's nothing on the road in front of you and then sometimes i expect traffic to be come towards me
S0619	mm hm
S0618	but no it's a not a one way street and we're not in the bus taxi lane and we're fine but there's a red light okay we can do that
S0619	all go well
S0618	yeah so far so good
S0619	right and then we just go into a straight line until we get onto the motorway
S0618	until we hit the motorway and then we go in a straight line until we're home
S0619	yep
S0618	what could possibly go wrong
S0619	right well here we be park ten minutes ago
S0618	ten minutes ago yeah that's a heck of a lot of traffic why be they all go that way what do they know that we don't know
S0619	what town be in that direction cos krakow be in the other direction 's in
S0618	yeah 's the other direction
S0619	there even the other direction maybe but be be maybe you can get on the motorway there and it's better than get on the motorway here
S0618	mm the motorway here
S0619	this side
S0618	yeah possibly
S0619	cos i suppose you've get to go north
S0618	yeah but then it's four
S0619	motorway
S0618	four o'clock so maybe this be when people finish work
S0619	mm hm
S0618	cos i've notice that
S0619	oh absolutely yeah it's rush hour
S0618	there's a rush hour at twelve
S0619	uhu
S0618	whereas in the uk you'd expect rush hour to be one till two
S0619	uhu
S0618	here it seem to be sort of twelve till one or later erm yeah so maybe four clock be the erm knock off time
S0619	yeah rush hour oh very cautiously drive illegally
S0618	uh oh
S0619	if they do it so slowly and quietly no one will notice
S0619	right well there be a naked woman on a billboard how do you feel
S0618	yeah what
S0619	well she's you know get hair
S0618	i've notice that that's so weird as well
S0619	it's so promiscuous
S0618	yeah i there's erm a place in that have i think it's some bridal shop next to a sex shop or something like that
S0619	mm hm oh i know where you mean
S0618	you know the one i mean yeah and there's some sort of erotica dot com slightly fruity website thing and i i'm not quite sure what the word mean but it sound like some sort of sex relate stuff go on
S0619	mm hm
S0618	and it i don't know it just seem to be a culture full of contradictions sometimes with the whole
S0619	yeah it's sort of a lose generation it's all this sort of period transitional period between er
S0618	mm communism and
S0619	very conservative traditional religion
S0618	yeah
S0619	and sluts and whore
S0619	i'm joke i'm joke
S0618	embrace more western culture
S0619	yeah and yeah
S0618	i'm i be really incredibly surprise to find everybody shave their armpits in poland
S0619	do you
S0618	or at least they appear to
S0619	no these girls man be so up on cosmetics and
S0618	yeah
S0619	everyone have their nail do everyone
S0618	mm
S0619	you know people sort of make comment about not have a lot of money or not be able to afford things but
S0618	yeah
S0619	all of them have their nail do professionally at
S0618	have their nail do
S0619	er at a cosmetic place
S0619	beauty salon
S0618	that's the one
S0619	sorry sorry about that
S0618	a cosmetic place that'll do
S0619	erm at a beauty salon or you know they have er they use sunbeds or they have their hair cut really frequently or blah blah blah
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	erm
S0618	it's curious
S0619	it be need to change those
S0618	i hope you know yeah i wonder about that ah no i've get an arrow i've get a straight arrow
S0619	i know i don't i know we've get that's still a bus lane
S0618	i be hop that the erm sort of insecurities that can quite often go with that sort of beautification thing
S0619	mm
S0618	you know for me a lot of it be around you're a shit person nobody will love you unless you a b c d x y z
S0619	follow the follow the norms
S0618	yeah exactly or you know it's almost like people be be tell these be the norms and unless you conform you're you you suck
S0619	mm
S0618	so you know i kind of hope that those insecurities don't come with this sort of wave of westernisation of the culture i don't know
S0619	but i think i think they've all but i think erm uh these aren't new i think it's sort of ingrain female i don't know
S0618	i don't know
S0619	i think they go to more effort here than girls in in england no i don't know if that's true
S0618	oh northern ireland everyone's orange and have no eyebrows
S0619	no that's true yeah
S0618	northern ireland be oh
S0619	i don't know
S0619	you can't compare the two culture i guess
S0618	yeah
S0619	but there be have you notice this sort of erm you know there be a very polish girl sort of way to look
S0618	mm hm
S0619	you know long hair
S0618	uhu
S0619	very slim very thin legs think it's genetics rather than sort of through diet or exercise they're just
S0618	yeah
S0619	genetically have very small legs even if they have huge upper body
S0619	like
S0618	pin legs
S0619	like a marble on a match stick and like
S0618	okay
S0619	a marble on match stick i think it be it's genetic think about it before
S0618	okay
S0619	erm that's why they can't lift any weight in the gym cos they've get little spindly legs
S0618	right that don't support them okay
S0619	er whereas er british women have much thicker legs don't know why it's not to do with cold cos it's colder here er maybe to do with diet and sort of store fat in a different place don't know
S0618	yeah
S0619	more sedentary in the past don't know don't know
S0618	interest
S0619	uh yeah and sort of very thin very sort of natural makeup not so much over the top although some people be er but yeah always beautiful nail
S0618	yeah i've notice
S0619	everything very polish
S0618	polish women tend to look quite natural
S0619	uhu
S0618	and those that do bother with makeup don't
S0619	over do it
S0618	well some over do it but most
S0619	uhu
S0618	will just have a little touch so you hardly know it's there
S0619	mm hm
S0618	have i gotta give way to that man go on fella go on oh maybe i wasn't mean to give way to him how the fuck should i know
S0619	he look very alarm
S0618	he look really shock that a vehicle have stop at a cross how do i know when to give way and when not to you think it's a cross i'm stop anyway yeah and i think polish women look all the better for it as well
S0619	mm hm
S0618	and i like that sort of more natural look northern irish women on the whole be pretty darn ugly i think quite naturally very beautiful but
S0619	yeah
S0618	to my taste to my eye to my perceptions just go way over the top with paint themselves orange with a pinky sort of lipstick shave their eyebrows off and paint them in again very badly
S0619	yeah
S0618	you know yeah not good really not good but i suppose everybody should have the freedom to be and act and look
S0619	mm hm mm hm
S0618	as they want to without my judgment
S0619	yeah
S0618	but i i do think polish women to be far more attractive for do far less cosmetically
S0619	that's yeah yeah half agree half disagree
S0618	mm
S0619	erm i think they be more beautiful anyway erm
S0618	yeah good bone structure

S0618	i give up on luther i think in series two or series three
S0619	uhu yeah it get really hardcore
S0618	it just get far too too into this and i didn't wanna be look at all those nasty visuals and it be generally a female victim have some sort of sexual thing go on
S0619	yeah yeah sure yep
S0618	and end up dead and i just think no there's only so much of that you can put up with
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	in one lifetime so i stop watch luther which be a shame because i really enjoy it before that
S0619	he's character
S0618	yeah brilliant character but the sort of agatha christie's the miss marple's erm even midsummer murder that type of thing they poddle along gently and
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah it's good without too much gratuitous death
S0619	er yeah er yeah i i see it i see your point erm i like silent witness
S0618	oh yes yeah
S0619	silent witness be back on iplayer

S0618	so you make a robot
S0619	yeah or and make them move around in the kitchen
S0618	that's really cool
S0619	yeah yes really good i'm absolutely feel really strongly about not gendering toy
S0618	i agree
S0619	and not say you can't have that it's for girls or you can't have that it's for boys i just think fuck play with your dolls
S0618	yeah thing be in erm be it the usa there's a store call target
S0619	yep
S0618	that do away with that and i think with clothe as well
S0619	yep yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm ah all these book that be like oh things for little boys and you know
S0618	yeah
S0619	why do boys get well i'm not really interest in space or rocket or science but why do they get that
S0618	yeah
S0619	and i get why we do we only get princesses like
S0618	i know
S0619	shit i don't wanna be a princess
S0618	i have action men
S0619	yeah i use well i didn't have action men but i use to have a gary barlow doll
S0619	like before i know what sex be i use to rub him against my posh spice
S0618	oh my god
S0619	i know
S0618	i use to rub my action man against who live over the road's barbie
S0618	or be it sindy i don't know it be probably one of the two yeah oh dear
S0619	yeah and he have
S0618	that's hilarious
S0619	he have like an orange jumpsuit from the music video he look like he'd be to guantanamo bay
S0618	yeah like any spice girl would go with an orange jump suit guantanamo bay gear up gary barlow that's hilarious
S0619	yeah god gary barlow dolls
S0618	oh dear
S0619	yeah so that be me
S0618	yeah but i think part of the sort of gendering children be all to do with how they're treat er regardless of their toy
S0619	mm hm
S0618	so oh isn't she a pretty little thing or er he's a tough fella like his dad you know there's all of that business
S0619	yeah
S0618	and a lot of that be culturally engrained but i do feel that it's get less and less so the bottom line we're all humans
S0619	yeah
S0618	we will all have male and female characteristics and i'm read a lot a lot about this in erm the seth book i'm read at the moment i can't remember the title of it i think i finish the one on mass events which be really about the collective human consciousness
S0619	mm hm
S0618	and the one i'm on at the moment it deal a lot with sex sexuality gender things like that really look at how humanity have evolve in that way
S0619	mm hm
S0618	and there be a lot of stuff that be now nature rather than nurture
S0619	mm hm
S0618	that wasn't it didn't begin that way
S0619	yeah
S0618	it's just it's so engrained now it's kind of in the genes because it's be sort of adopt over so many generations you know this idea that men aren't feel or sensitive
S0619	mm hm
S0618	that children be you know women's domain erm
S0619	mm hm
S0618	men go out to work you know it's all bollocks really it's just the way that things have be design over the over the generations
S0619	yes and
S0618	yeah male logic female intuition well hang on
S0619	mm hm yeah what do it mean
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm yeah and gender sort of fluidity or er things be change erm and yeah no you know i be say before about oh i feel not i feel like lucky to be alive and it's an excite time to be alive i think it's excite
S0618	yeah
S0619	time in term of progression of erm trans right
S0618	yeah
S0619	and erm er not coverage or publicity be not the right word but erm trans be go mainstream i suppose or in the in the last year
S0618	yeah yeah it really be
S0619	stuff's happen super excite
S0618	yeah and you're alive to bear witness to that
S0619	yeah
S0618	and a lot of it be about humans become less judgemental
S0619	yeah
S0618	if you look at sort of forties fifties sixties and you've get the whole black issue
S0619	mm hm
S0618	then you've get the female issue
S0619	mm hm
S0618	then you've get the gay issue
S0619	gay
S0618	then you've get the disability issue and now you've get the trans issue
S0619	mm hm
S0618	so it's almost like humanity have find all of these ways
S0619	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0618	to divide and separate themselves but finally you know we appear to be come together
S0619	yeah we're sort of tick things off the list
S0618	yeah
S0619	i mean always gonna have to go back over things and it's not quite right yet it's not quite right yet and it's gonna take forever and forever but you know it's be air it's be talk about it's be er
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm
S0618	massive progress in just even sixty seventy years if you look at the
S0619	oh absolutely yeah
S0618	world yeah
S0619	so
S0618	it's all good
S0619	it's all get well it's get it's get there for sure for sure
S0618	yeah but it's a work in progress and i do feel it's move in a you know a positive love direction yeah
S0619	oh yeah absolutely yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	it's all good things be look up until someone fuck it all up but we shall wait and see
S0618	yeah no but even when people fuck it up you know if you look at someone like you know cameron who be self serve have no interest in humanity
S0619	uhu yeah
S0618	full stop
S0619	people mm hm
S0618	very much service to self i think people like that then prompt a reaction it's almost like if you you need the the darkness to see the beauty in the light well you can't see the light if there's only light
S0619	yeah
S0618	you need darkness you need contrast you need something to compare with something in order to say oh that's not right or could that be different so i think in a way
S0619	mm hm true
S0618	he's do a brilliant job of show
S0619	yeah give us a something to work against something to push against or erm
S0618	yeah yeah yeah or help people to realise what they don't want
S0619	yeah
S0618	so people then wake up to what they do want this be
S0619	yeah that's a good point
S0618	you know on a sort of microcosm of all of that be where i've be at this last two or three weeks since come back since come back from christmas break be i'm bloody bore some days
S0619	mm hm
S0618	and i think part of that be i think okay this be this reality be mine to create what do i want to create what bring me my greatest joy
S0619	yeah
S0618	what can i do here now today in my life
S0619	what will make me happiest yeah
S0618	to make this wonderful and i don't know
S0619	yeah
S0618	i don't know what i want and then you get someone like cameron and you can say well i don't want that so you know
S0619	well yeah uhu
S0618	and it at least help you to shape your life and to create your life
S0619	yeah you can you can yeah it doesn't give you the it doesn't give you the answer you want it but it give you the answer that you don't want
S0618	yeah but then that can help to open up debate it's always like it's of it's almost key to conciseness then things over in your brain to start say
S0619	mm hm
S0618	oh okay well not that so what the
S0619	yeah
S0618	what's the opposite well what be the alternatives so yeah no i do need to do something though i'm i'm alright for the next couple of weeks while everybody's free to play cos it's holiday
S0619	yeah
S0618	but i need to find something for the four weeks of february to keep me occupy
S0619	yoga
S0618	yeah very possibly i can engage with the day class at yoga er and there's a woman there actually an older woman who's name i've completely forget who speak very good english
S0619	uhu
S0618	and she be talk about erm take some lessons with me but i think it's maybe i'll just suggest we go out for coffee a couple of time a week
S0619	yeah nice
S0618	yeah so it's all good but anyway yeah where be we
S0619	i don't know
S0618	trans issue and what a great film pride be
S0619	oh man i just god
S0618	yeah
S0618	movie night
S0619	i could bloody talk about this film for ever and ever and ever
S0618	ah i can't believe it have pass me by until a few months ago and a friend it and we watch it
S0619	yeah
S0618	and i just think what a magnificent feel good film it be just great
S0619	yeah yeah i didn't know i didn't hear anything about it i think i just it be about october last year be it or do it only come out this year or last like
S0618	twenty fifteen sometime wasn't it
S0619	and it must have be the begin of twenty fifteen cos i've know of this for quite a long time erm and i be just look for something to watch online and just go oh i'll watch this and i be hook within about you know half a minute
S0618	yeah yeah
S0619	and then i just sort of watch it continually since since then days in a row i
S0618	i i've only watch it once but i'd love to watch it again
S0619	yep
S0618	so definitely get a movie night sort part of why it be amaze for me be cos it be erm you know the erm you know the at the begin of the film they go on that pride march and i think it's nineteen eighty nine or something like that erm or eighty eight or whatever
S0619	yep mm hm yeah yeah a little bite earlier
S0618	my first pride march be nineteen ninety
S0619	uhu
S0618	i be there ninety one and then i think skip a few years and then ninety five
S0619	uhu
S0618	and then didn't bother after that but i can remember a pride march in london in nineteen ninety and be spat at be shout at be verbally abuse erm sing some interest songs like two four six eight be that copper really straight
S0619	yeah
S0618	cos people in the police force who want to go on pride march that be the only way they could do
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	be to be police erm and to you know that be the only way they could engage with the event but yeah so it's interest for me from that personal viewpoint as well and that prejudice and the abuse at the time that i have first hand experience of but yeah i i and i think the whole thing with the miners and thatcher and i don't think even though i grow up in that era grow up in cambridge i don't think i really
S0619	yeah saw it
S0618	no i didn't see the miners' strike like people who live in different part of the uk do
S0619	yeah
S0618	although i be very very aware of it cos it be all over the media
S0619	mm hm mm hm yes i just miss all of this erm and i
S0618	amaze time and really define you know the era that we're in now
S0619	yeah
S0618	like i say earlier i think thatcher and reagan really define how the next few decades be gonna go and thatcher it wasn't well it be the undo of the unions that
S0619	mm hm
S0618	that really have such a profound impact on the uk i feel yeah
S0619	i don't know how old i be at my first pride i don't know twelve thirteen with my mum in manchester
S0618	oh brilliant
S0619	yeah and my parent go every year to manchester or to liverpool

S0619	yeah it's like yeah a sort of tradition i suppose
S0618	yeah
S0618	that's funny i join a gay youth group when i be still at school i think i be fifteen sixteen and there be two other girls from my school at this youth group
S0619	oh that's nice
S0618	yeah they both turn out straight or mostly straight but yeah

S0618	invent one if you didn't know what the word be what would it be
S0619	oh i don't know
S0619	i'm sorry
S0618	i never do have a student to tell me to fuck off but i think i be probably close with some of the teenage class
S0619	funny my eighteen year old boy tell me to fuck off all the time

S0618	no you fuck off
S0619	fuck bell end
S0619	and like i'm go to get sack ah

S0619	funny
S0618	interest just gonna put the heat up a little bite again
S0619	yeah sure
S0618	get cold feet not figuratively literally
S0619	god nearly take me for lunch
S0618	i've be sleep load lately and i do wonder if it's that sort of
S0618	you know work thing and i've be go to bed between nine and ten and fall asleep between nine and ten
S0619	where do that conversation change occur
S0618	well no cos you're yawn
S0619	oh right sorry
S0618	and then
S0619	yes
S0618	i've be wake up any time between six and half seven generally
S0619	uhu
S0618	but if i've fall asleep at half nine i'm still get load of sleep
S0619	yeah it's fine man let your body do what it want
S0618	yeah exactly that's where i'm at
S0619	yeah last night i be like right i really must do a little bite more of this spanish and then i go no i'm tire i'm go to bed
S0619	so just listen and if you're tire sleep i think there be many many world war or arguments or anything that would be solve by people sleep for eight hours a night
S0618	i agree
S0619	i swear to god
S0618	yes and not work so many bloody hours
S0619	yeah
S0618	i really can't get over that there's a you know a facebook slogan pop up now again stop the glorification of busy and i can i can understand that and engage with that sentiment but you know have be there myself for a number of years and i remember i probably tell you this i work on a small industrial estate and i use to go out for a coke or a coffee or a whatever with the bloke who run the small business centre over the road and i remember us both have a cuppa together feel guilty about have a lunch break because dedicate hard work people didn't stop for lunch
S0619	mm hm yeah
S0618	they work right through and have the conversation about how we felt that even if we be pay till five or work officially end at five we should stay till six or seven or eight or nine to demonstrate some kind of dedication to the role well fuck that really and i i really it really bring home to me i've get a german friend who run an ashfelt business and he must be worth millions he's get an extraordinary successful company he run out of berlin and düsseldorf erm do a lot of work in china et cetera et cetera blah blah blah he work fewer than forty hours a week
S0619	yeah good for him
S0618	and i think that's great and i think no it wasn't him another german friend first say to me if you can't do your work in eight hours you're not sufficiently efficient
S0619	mm hm
S0618	hallelujah
S0619	yeah that's a good point
S0618	yeah but the northern europeans seem to be lead the way on that with more emphasis on family and less of an emphasis on work
S0619	yeah
S0618	it's good
S0619	i don't know i don't know because i don't know where i'm gonna go with this sentence
S0619	i'm really sorry i'm just work it out first before i continue erm i've always work extremely hard but i've always know that fundamentally i'm quite a lazy person and if i can get away with the bare minimum erm i'm not a sort of i'm not a lazy person in term of erm what i do in a day
S0618	uhu
S0619	but lazy in term of er why do i need to do this sorry why be i work so much
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm so in that way i think i'm quite lazy and i can always draw the line and go right that's enough and i do it on celta i do it when i be a student i'm you know try to do it now
S0618	yeah
S0619	and you go right enough's enough sorry it's my time now bye
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm and it's you know it's not easy to do and not everybody do it er but i've always be really sort of self aware of work not run into your normal life
S0618	mm
S0619	and in this job it's hard you know you're work at home or prepare at home
S0618	yeah
S0619	where be that sort of erm line draw
S0618	yeah where do you draw the line yeah and i seem to remember you say at some point that you'd set an alarm for your lesson prep time
S0619	yeah no on a timer
S0618	yeah
S0619	and once the timer go off then
S0618	stop prepare
S0619	stop prepare it's either finish or it's not and if it's not it's your own fault
S0618	yeah
S0619	er and yeah that's the only way i can do it
S0618	yeah if you get the first part of your lesson plan i i think that's quite often sufficient
S0619	yeah
S0618	cos lesson depend on the students depend on the day can go off on different tangents anyway
S0619	mm hm
S0618	so if you've plan the entirety of it you maybe have less flexibility then sometimes
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	er you can't say do it all in eight hours because if you're teach for
S0618	eight and a half
S0619	six hours yeah you can't necessarily do it all in
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm that remain two hours but you can have a go
S0618	yeah i guess it's different with the job that you have because some days you will teach a lot of hours other days you will teach far fewer hours
S0619	yeah and do the plan then
S0618	and it's yeah up to you to then balance when you do the plan so day be like the next day
S0619	mm hm yep so it's all
S0618	yeah
S0619	fall into place erm can't remember what i be originally gonna say before we start on that dunno but don't know if i can do it i've see the effect of what happen if you work too much erm and you know it sort of ruin your life ruin your health and your mental health erm
S0618	mm yeah
S0619	you know and i compare myself to friends who live in london for example and they don't have enough time in the day to do anything
S0618	yeah
S0619	you know they're on an hour commute on public transport er transport work all day more than they should for what to make money for someone else
S0618	yeah
S0619	it's just a bite pant er and and you know and then me think oh god should i be do be more would i be make more money if i be do more would i be happier no probably not so find the line find what's right for you
S0618	yeah yeah exactly i do think also depend on the individual and what's right for you i think for me at the time when i have my er period of a number of years of work crazy hours i think in a way that be right for me at the time i get such a buzz off of it
S0619	yeah
S0618	i get such a kick out of it you know it be stressful but i be kind of like an adrenaline junkie
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah and i always
S0619	yeah and people say they feel like that as well
S0618	yeah i have job that be you know sort of semi physical as well you know my day job be furniture recycle charitable organisation and quite often i'd be drive the van or carry wash machine up
S0619	yeah lug the furniture yeah
S0618	three flight of stairs and things like that erm and then i'd go home have something to eat have a nap and my night job would be wash up in a pub restaurant waitress bar work
S0619	yeah
S0618	so that's very physical as well erm and i do have a fair bite of paperwork cos i be the boss of the charitable job so i have to do all that account stuff and whatnot as well so you know i have the brain stimulation but i think importantly have the physical stuff
S0619	mm hm
S0618	whereas i think in other job where i've work a lot of hours and it's just be desk base i've really struggle with that because i haven't be able to move my body
S0619	mm hm yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah that's
S0618	yeah
S0619	and in term of you say erm work more so that you look as though you're really dedicate and commit
S0618	yeah
S0619	i think there be other ways to to show that without have to work
S0618	yeah
S0619	more and more and especially in this job it's simply by say it to the boss i say to all the time oh look here's what i'm do to improve myself
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm and like i'm not say i'm do it to i don't know to play game or to sort of look like i'm fake it in order to you know give this false impression of how much work i'm do i be do it
S0618	yeah you be do it yeah
S0619	but i'm make sure that i'm fuck tell her because erm
S0618	yeah good for you
S0619	you know she's the one who's go be write reference for me so i need her to see
S0618	i'm sure she would mind if you add onto the end of that sentence just remember this when you're write my reference please
S0619	well yeah i'm i'm
S0618	she's the sort of person i imagine you could say that to
S0619	yeah and like i've not say it like that but i'm write her a list and when i say be it okay if you write my reference here's the things i think be important
S0618	definitely
S0619	or would you consider put them in
S0618	definitely
S0619	you know
S0618	yeah
S0619	it's not like i'm tell her what to write and it's just you know she's busy she's get so many teachers
S0618	exactly
S0619	she might forget all the time i've do x y z
S0618	yeah and i i think as a busy person she'll really appreciate you give her an outline of what you'd like to see in your reference
S0619	yeah give her yeah
S0618	save her have to sit and think so yeah
S0619	so
S0618	and you're right she won't remember it all and she's get a few hundred teachers so yeah
S0619	yeah so yeah it doesn't hours behind a desk doesn't really show dedication i think other things should
S0618	no
S0619	i don't know it depend on the job i guess
S0618	it seem to be a sort of an equation with a bite of victimhood and martyrdom erm
S0619	in what way
S0618	seem to equate with hard work or you know oh i'm so tire oh i'm really sick erm
S0619	mm hm
S0618	oh i be work till midnight last night well more fool you you mug really
S0619	mm hm
S0618	and i don't you know maybe some boss be impress by that maybe that be a mark of dedication
S0619	if i be a boss i'd be like bloody hell get a life
S0618	yeah i would think that show such a
S0619	i'd be a terrible boss probably
S0618	such a such a lack of respect of self really
S0619	mm hm mm hm
S0618	it's not necessarily a quality that you want to see in people
S0619	mm hm yeah
S0618	yeah actually say that when i work for a big charity in england i have er one manager who be in seven every morning didn't get pay until nine erm
S0619	mm hm
S0618	but i think it kind of suit her as far as traffic and transport and get lift and travel and things like that go
S0619	yeah
S0618	and she didn't lord it as a symbol of martyrdom but i use to say to her you're a mug you know you're a complete mug don't expect anybody you know i be her boss
S0619	mm hm yeah to recognise it or
S0618	but i be say it to her you know obviously we have a good relationship and i express my appreciation and gratitude for the wonderful work that she do she be the best manager on the team by far but i'd say to her don't expect anybody to thank you for this don't expect anybody to recognise or appreciate this
S0619	yeah yeah nobody owe you anything
S0618	no exactly so if you do it you do it for yourself if you expect anything you're a mug
S0619	yeah my auntie be the same she's an accountant and she technically start at eight but she get there before seven every morning erm you know and have her breakfast at her desk and turn her computer on and all of this stuff and start work early and then she's like oh and they don't respect me and blah blah blah and it's like well you're not do anything different to other people
S0618	yeah
S0619	other than go to work earlier and they don't owe you for it
S0618	and she's clearly show how she doesn't respect herself so why should anybody else respect her
S0619	yeah yeah
S0618	you know
S0619	exactly
S0618	yeah anyway maybe i'm a bite harsh on that front
S0619	yes
S0618	but i suppose i'm recognise in people a lot of what i recognise in myself historically
S0619	yeah
S0618	you know young be that person
S0619	and i still i'm rubbish at this which be go early to work to photocopy stuff because i think it will take an hour and in reality it take ten minutes
S0618	yeah it take ten minutes yeah
S0619	or i would just you know i'm not just at the point in my career yet where i can just roll in
S0618	yeah
S0619	ten minutes before like the polish teachers do whack on the photocopier go to the lesson
S0618	yeah
S0619	i need the time to organise it make a coffee sort of deep breath ready to go
S0618	that's fair enough erm
S0619	erm what you're say take the next exit
S0618	yeah five o two
S0619	erm
S0618	let's see what the sign say i'm not sure if i'm gonna follow simon
S0619	so you know i'm not quite
S0618	do this say
S0619	yeah
S0618	yes it do right simon i'll believe you
S0619	mm so in some ways i can see people go to work and blah blah blah but i don't expect them to be like oh she's so good she's always here for hours
S0618	she's so dedicate
S0619	they're probably go why
S0618	yeah
S0619	be she lonely do she need to talk to somebody
S0618	yeah probably
S0619	do be it cos she just need to get out of the house like
S0618	oh i suppose if it help your mental well be and help your stress level then that's fair enough
S0619	yeah it do yeah it's just this sort of like anxiety of it go wrong
S0618	but it's all fair enough anyway yeah
S0619	erm so and it's you know so i'm try actively to reduce this time
S0618	mm
S0619	and get it down to only go a half hour early instead of an hour yeah
S0618	the back up of course be if you get there and there's a problem with the photocopier or whatever
S0619	well yeah exactly
S0618	be if you can do what you need for your first lesson and leave anything else with the reception guy
S0619	yeah
S0618	cos they're brilliant at you know do the extras and come into your room and leave it with you so
S0619	oh speedy gonzales
S0618	i know there be no speed limit on this road which freak the hell out of me sometimes and i think oh i've get load of time for overtake not realise that something do a hundred and twenty miles an hour rapidly approach you can be a bite scary sometimes
S0619	yeah when pick me up for the airport we do the journey
S0618	do you get there before you leave
S0619	forty minutes
S0618	oh my god what should it take about an hour and ten at least
S0619	yeah and i be like oh goodness me
S0618	yeah she's a fast driver
S0619	she be but i feel really comfortable in her hand
S0618	yeah yeah i do
S0619	when she's drive
S0618	i do
S0619	you know it's her job
S0618	yeah
S0619	and she have extra train for like snow on motorways and drive fast and drive under weather condition
S0618	yeah
S0619	so i feel kind of okay
S0618	she's good
S0619	yeah and especially like when 's in the car i'm like she's not gonna do anything stupid her own sort of daughter
S0618	yeah
S0619	be all she's not gonna take chance she's drive as she think best
S0618	yep yep
S0619	yeah buddy so we should come out near my flat or we should just come out in the middle of nowhere
S0618	i think we've pass the real supermarket
S0619	mm hm should go past
S0618	the real supermarket mm
S0619	poss
S0618	no i don't think we do go past i think we end up on
S0619	right
S0618	er instead but if you know an alternative route tell me
S0619	well this be the way that the voyager bus come
S0618	ah
S0619	er and this be you know how i manage to get out there bus er near my flat but i really don't know so just follow the satnav

S0619	and all of these cars be like really cautiously drive around a massive bauble
S0618	oh dear
S0618	it's a bite random isn't it that's funny
S0619	and block two lanes of traffic they're funny
S0618	this be a funny road cos it's get seventy kilometres per hour on here and then i think bits of it be fifty but i'm not quite sure
S0619	mm
S0618	but nobody take any notice of speed limit anyway so i'm always a little bite in no man's land not want to get nick for break the speed limit
S0619	yeah
S0618	not want to hold people up
S0619	yeah everyone else
S0618	but at the same time want to be aware that there be pedestrian cross that i might need to stop
S0619	mm hm
S0618	or might not erm yeah it's hard to gauge so i tend to do somewhere between fifty and seventy with this bite you know fifty fine fair enough
S0619	yeah
S0618	and then it just get like it's a big wide road
S0618	and you think maybe it's ninety or maybe it's seventy i don't know here we be it's seventy

S0618	oh jesus
S0619	one or seven days i can't remember
S0618	right so
S0619	i know that the time to make a habit be a lot shorter than to break a habit but i
S0618	okay
S0619	the specifics don't know
S0618	some time
S0618	i don't know
S0619	anyway
S0618	i think it be three weeks for both but i don't know

S0618	yay what a model citizen

S0618	no this be me be the angel talk to you
S0619	oh right okay
S0618	like rah rah rah
S0618	more glow baubles randomly distribute in
S0619	i really wish like we be also film this so that more people could understand what we're see
S0619	it must feel like you know in a context it would make much more sense
S0618	i know i it would
S0619	i know they're analyse the language and not actually what we're say
S0618	yeah
S0619	and there be a difference between them
S0618	they're only gonna get a half a picture really without see these
S0619	yeah cos i do that in work
S0618	red glow orb
S0619	and it's really hard to you know see the difference between what people be say and the way they're say it
S0618	mm hm
S0619	you know read the english i mean listen to the english and not to the stories
S0618	yeah
S0619	but fuck me listen to people speak english be bore listen to stories be great
S0619	mm dunno how do you feel about all of these plastic things on the side of motorways i think it's rubbish
S0618	no as as a passenger on a bus quite often
S0619	it's crap isn't it
S0618	yeah it's rubbish cos you don't get to enjoy the beautiful scenery and see all of the buzzards
S0619	mm
S0618	i do particularly like buzzards
S0619	you just see clear plastic with fuck bird silhouette onto them
S0618	it's not just bird
S0619	as though it's the same
S0618	buzzards
S0619	oh be that what they be
S0618	yeah buzzard silhouette
S0619	oh i just think it be any old bird
S0618	no and the ones that be in i nearly point them out to you and i think oh that's really square
S0619	yeah i've see them before
S0618	i couldn't work out what bird it be but it wasn't a buzzard
S0619	yeah
S0618	mm
S0619	i think it's just a generic bird
S0618	no no the ones in they be a bite more i don't know maybe a bite red kitey but you don't get red kit over here slightly more fan stumpier tail than a buzzard which would indicate a red kite but the wing shape be all wrong so
S0619	just think it's a tremendous waste of the view for what reason
S0619	unless to sort of keep sort of pollution away from the tree
S0618	mm something to do with snow
S0619	mm
S0618	wind
S0619	mm
S0618	i don't know
S0619	there's no rivers it's not like they're block you know
S0618	no flood and i walk quite a bite erm round the back of mine and i can go sort of all sort of right near the number ninety four road near me
S0619	uhu
S0618	and there be the the drainage system be amaze
S0619	mm
S0618	i wonder if in the uk the drainage system be equally amaze but it all seem to be underground perhaps but here you can see the motorway run off erm there's never gonna be a problem with flood or rain or whatever
S0619	mm
S0618	so yeah i'm go right here aren't i
S0619	yeah please
S0618	yeah yeah and it's be quite pretty actually walk while it's all be ice over
S0619	mm
S0618	mm
S0619	i saw a load of duck in the river or in the canal
S0618	oh yeah
S0619	whatever it be and it be ice over
S0618	yeah
S0619	and i be like bloody hell duck
S0618	oh i can go nobody else want to go no so i can go oh pedestrians that freak me out the first few time i realise i might have a green light
S0619	yeah so do i
S0618	and i put my foot down to turn round the corner and there be pedestrians cross it's a little bite freaky
S0619	and it's hard as a pedestrian as well when you're sort of cross a road on a green man and a car come scream towards you
S0618	yeah i know or even on like a normal pedestrian cross cos i tend to just go and expect everything to stop
S0619	mm hm
S0618	erm but particularly at night now as a driver there be no flash orange light
S0619	yeah
S0618	to indicate there's a cross so you might just see a silhouette of a human as you rapidly approach it
S0619	yeah and try not to kill them
S0618	yeah try not kill anybody it's erm
S0619	i get so piss off when they don't stop erm and the weather's really bad or it's rain or it's freeze cold
S0618	yeah
S0619	and i've just i've just start like not even really look and just walk out
S0618	yeah oh jeez steady
S0619	because otherwise i'm just gonna stand there all day cos they don't wanna stop
S0618	yeah
S0619	for me despite the fact it's like minus whatever degrees and they're just you know oh you're so nice and warm in your car be you that's nice
S0618	yeah i'm fuck freeze
S0618	and i need to get home and cook my lasagne lasagne dish
S0619	i'm so excite for this lasagne
S0618	good for you
S0619	lasagne dot com might put it in the oven again just to get the extra warmth instead of in the microwave
S0618	yeah probably teach my granny to suck egg here you probably know this already but transfer it into a different dish because if you put a dish in the oven that's already be into the oven
S0619	well it's in tupperware now so i'd have to put it back into its lasagne
