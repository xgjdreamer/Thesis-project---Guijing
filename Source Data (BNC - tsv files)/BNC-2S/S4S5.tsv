S0320	yeah i'm not surprise
S0443	i keep say you know she's get a hide past but i'm sure her kid don't
S0320	yeah big time they've get no idea doesn't want to know and just doesn't know cos she be always like she be very strict with i think
S0443	yeah
S0320	so yeah it's all a bite hypocritical i should imagine
S0443	it's all a bite what
S0320	hypocritical from 's point of view
S0443	mm

S0443	okay i think you want some jam
S0320	i do i have it on the other one

S0443	and i take some picture of the pianist who we'd see last week with another singer
S0320	mm
S0443	he be with last week in the halls which be full of rough as men this be the opposite end of the spectrum
S0443	yeah it be very entertain oh yeah use to sing with meat loaf meat loaf
S0320	yeah i understand what
S0320	what when
S0443	only once only once on stage
S0320	how what
S0443	i don't know
S0320	that be bonkers
S0443	yeah bonkers
S0320	didn't you ask any more

S0320	why not
S0443	if you ask people question they stop tell you give you information
S0320	oh okay
S0443	haven't you notice that with
S0320	yeah but that's the sort of thing that warrant at least one question
S0443	no
S0320	that really
S0443	i know i think it be funny
S0320	that be that be odd
S0443	only once i think it be a bite like go on stage with rufus wainwright
S0320	oh okay
S0443	i think it be probably a
S0320	pull out of the audience kind of thing
S0443	but she use to sing there be a folk group call the spinners and she use to sing with them
S0320	that's really funny
S0443	i know all this hide past come out
S0320	i know i think i use to tell people like and she wouldn't believe me either
S0443	oh don't don't tell don't blow her cover
S0320	no i didn't i don't any more cos never see them but i just use to say the same thing she didn't use to be like this i'm sure she have a life she be a student don't you know
S0443	mm that's true
S0320	yeah that be a massive give away
S0443	i think it be just an on stage thing with meat loaf i don't know but
S0320	no but she use to sing in a folk group
S0443	there's such a their band yeah she use to do a lot of folk sing
S0320	how funny
S0443	i never know she sing before
S0320	no but then i suppose if she be drama and all of that
S0443	she wasn't she be art visual
S0320	well yeah visual art really
S0443	mm yeah
S0320	again very well hide
S0443	yeah and then go launch into this strange psychological lack of self image
S0320	what what be he talk about
S0443	he be talk about he be bear in what be which be now
S0320	yeah
S0443	and as an adult he go back and he be work in the bush on top secret things and you weren't allow to take photograph well and his mum say there be no mirror no one have any mirror
S0443	real men don't have mirror don't you know
S0320	okay
S0443	it's not real men moisturise real men don't have mirror
S0320	no
S0443	and so he go on holiday to the seychelles
S0320	yeah
S0443	and he take some photograph and then he have them develop and there be a photograph of him in front of a plane
S0320	mm
S0443	and he he just deduce that must be what he look like
S0443	from the photograph
S0320	how odd
S0443	i think it be very jungle book you know animals look in ponds and see their reflection
S0443	i didn't quite get it but
S0320	no
S0443	it be an interest tale
S0320	they be an odd pair
S0443	they be they're very close to each other
S0320	yeah yeah they're both a bite bite loopy
S0443	mm and now they've get this itinerant lifestyle pass on
S0320	they probably quite like it actually
S0443	i think they're get a bite tire of it and then from today they're go over to look after dog in
S0320	oh yeah
S0443	they're go off to australia
S0320	mm
S0443	for 's wed and they're stay for a month

S0320	but they do before they use to come down all the time
S0443	mm but they don't now

S0320	yeah
S0443	take it out and then that's
S0320	well it's probably easier than bat that we use to get in ecuador
S0443	bat
S0320	yeah once we have i you know where 's mum and use to live and we live upstairs there be like a sort of metal cage around the door and i walk up and there be a bat just hang upside down right next to my head it be really horrible
S0443	er
S0320	it look like something out of a vampire movie
S0443	wow
S0320	yeah but use to get get rid of them
S0443	wow
S0320	yeah they be really horrible
S0443	well they quite often carry disease
S0320	yep er we be cos we be so high up we be like on the fourth floor
S0443	when we stay yeah when we stay at the beach there be bat outside your beach hut
S0320	yeah but they be quite small and they be just fly around they weren't perch inside your house like in like in it be a massive as well it be really horrible
S0443	really
S0320	yeah er
S0443	oh wow
S0320	just hang upside down asleep it blend in very well
S0443	that do sound horrible
S0320	yeah i don't know how it get in actually no idea but yeah we be quite high up 's mum's on the first floor this time so hopefully there won't be any bat
S0443	apparently do a course on erm ecology course when she come back from go round latin america cos their motorbike keep break down
S0320	mm
S0443	and they run out of money of course she do an ecology course and she become qualify so she could go round and erm identify where there's bat in build
S0320	oh wow
S0443	which be what do of and
S0320	oh okay
S0443	that's his job he's employ by county council to go round and do bat survey because if you've get something like the horseshoe bat you can't build
S0320	yeah
S0443	cos they're a protect species
S0320	oh okay
S0443	cos nobody want these bat in their belfry's kind of thing
S0320	yeah
S0443	and she'd go round but what she didn't like be tell people that they have bat and they couldn't build
S0320	yeah
S0443	so she's now work in a dental hospital in as a receptionist apparently
S0320	oh
S0443	which be a nice safe way for her to earn some money before they go off on their next erm crazy adventure
S0320	i wonder where they'll go they haven't get africa maybe they haven't get many place leave to go have they they've be quite a lot of place
S0443	mm i don't know
S0320	how funny
S0443	so opposite to her sister

S0443	didn't they have a
S0320	some interest cousins

S0320	oh
S0443	no i think they've buy them up so ordinary that's why
S0320	oh yeah definitely
S0443	but they're both a bite bonkers
S0320	i don't think who be bonkers
S0320	i don't know i don't think what 's do be bonkers sound quite fun to me i think it's quite normal actually
S0443	it's a bite extreme
S0320	she'll stop soon how old be she
S0443	she's only twenty five
S0320	yeah there you go she be still she's only twenty five she's get at least another five years
S0443	i think have a baby by the time she be twenty five

S0443	oh she's not off the rail she's just very adventurous
S0320	yeah it sound great
S0443	mm
S0320	don't blame her

S0320	yeah
S0443	unless say just do it
S0320	it's not great for his drive test practice because there's no rear view mirror you just have to use your side mirror
S0443	that's very good
S0320	so it's not brilliant but yeah
S0443	not a drive test
S0320	not drive test practice
S0443	he know his drive test practice be the thing be it's safer if you can drive
S0320	yeah and he's on 's car i think and 's dad's car

S0443	that's the main thing you get to keep your car
S0320	yeah oh oh i know what the deal be the deal with he may have be drink when they be talk about this deal be erm he can he can pay be canoe lessons
S0320	so there we go that's all sort
S0443	for what for the drive or
S0320	for the car
S0443	that's an awful lot of canoe lessons
S0320	well that's alright one a week will be fine

S0443	yeah
S0320	although it might be quite nice to go i'm sure this won't happen but probably quite good for me to go in the back of the car when he's drive someone else's car and just sit in the back while he's drive without really get involve
S0320	i think that's probably quite a good idea
S0443	er i don't think that's go to happen
S0320	so i can get use to it no i don't think it's go to happen but i think well it's not good for anybody else other than me be it i think it would good for me
