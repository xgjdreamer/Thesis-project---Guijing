S0012	not at thirteen years old anyway
S0013	not throughout your school it's silly
S0012	not throughout school no but i mean they might start wear them at er or higher heel not high heel i mean when i think of high heel i think of these stiletto things
S0013	i don't actually think the school would have allow it anyway
S0012	no course they wouldn't
S0013	no no
S0012	but maybe maybe the cuban type heel not er
S0013	maybe they wouldn't allow much
S0012	not stiletto type heel that be stupid but there you go know better didn't she
S0013	but then everyone's more sensible now now trainers be really fashionable anyway
S0012	that's brilliant that be ain't it
S0013	yeah
S0012	cos they be sensible shoe that keep the feet
S0013	mm
S0012	really good
S0013	although they do say no trainers at one time then they have to allow it didn't they
S0012	yeah
S0013	i think maybe i'm wrong maybe they don't allow it

S0012	well that's the problem er this be why they say school uniform's the best thing that they can wear

S0013	in the whole of area
S0012	well i expect there be no i don't know any other i don't know any other one i don't know i don't know how it work to be honest with you
S0013	no
S0012	but ours be the grammar school and er all us boys in our class and some of the girls
S0013	be there one at there's
S0012	that's a posh school
S0013	well be there a grammar school at when you be young
S0012	oh i don't know never think of different school we we just go to er it didn't even cross our mind we just think we're not go to a posh grammar school and and have to wear them stupid little hat that they wear so we all decide not to pass the er eleven plus
S0013	so what hat do they wear

S0013	so er
S0012	all us who didn't want to pass

S0013	mm
S0012	there be stream there be a b c and d and all us our gang finish up in the as so i i think the teachers know what we be capable of
S0013	when i be at school anyone who be at er secondary modern could make their way up
S0012	oh right
S0013	to grammar school we have quite a lot come up every year
S0012	do you

S0013	no you don't no
S0012	head of the green party that's me
S0013	you probably wouldn't've learn a lot more
S0012	well i tell you what i would rather have the skills i've get now as a you know engineer and woodworking and all that sort of stuff than go to a grammar school and just have the skills of know how to count
S0013	you learn other things as well
S0012	such as
S0013	well you'd've learn all the all the rest as well
S0012	latin
S0013	that's only part of it isn't it
S0012	well this be what put us off
S0013	they still do woodworking and stuff
S0012	they didn't do a lot in grammar school they didn't do anything like that then because they be more potential office workers and government workers rather than
S0013	well i do er
S0012	they be academics
S0013	but i do art needlework and domestic science and things
S0012	well there be that there be that

S0013	well you just help people out don't you
S0012	oh god you see this this be where secondary modern and
S0013	what you'd've charge for it
S0012	well of course
S0013	i'll do your homework if you pay me
S0012	that's right and it happen at our school
S0013	oh i just help people out i like i i like erm work out things i like all the erm work out the side of the triangle and things like that
S0012	oh i i have to say that you're a lot better at work out than i be i have to i have to give that one to you
S0013	but yeah i think it do change your change your think some even though it's not mathematical your think change
S0012	yeah well this be where we have
S0013	how to logic and things come into it i think
S0012	yeah well we have arguments with our teacher well not arguments but er question to the teacher just a stupid er what why do we have to learn about algebra it's really a stupid thing when be we go to use algebra in our live
S0013	yeah well you don't don't use it really
S0012	and he say well it's not the use it's to get your mind work to get you think correctly
S0013	yes
S0012	and that's what he tell us and we think what a waste of time but there you go
S0013	yeah yeah it's just work things out isn't it
S0012	yeah
S0013	mm
S0012	yeah
S0013	how a square equal b time bracket
S0012	oh god
S0013	c minus d
S0012	yeah
S0013	get complicate but
S0012	equal two e
S0013	so what be a or what be c
S0012	yeah that's right but that do you have to think about that don't you that's the whole point
S0013	yeah
S0012	you have to think
S0013	really hard yeah
S0012	yeah and er that be
S0013	mm
S0012	the whole point of algebra to train your mind
S0013	mm
S0012	whereas er we we couldn't see that we just couldn't see that at all but there you go when we be in er in er primary school well er or the infants they call they call it then we have to learn our table before we go up to the junior school
S0013	yeah so do
S0012	yeah
S0013	she be tell she she have to she have to know them all
S0012	yeah and so we
S0013	be able to chant them
S0012	we have to chant them
S0013	mm
S0012	every day and
S0013	yeah
S0012	and that's really weird because chant make you remember
S0013	mm it do it's like songs isn't it

S0013	keep sing the word of a song you get them
S0012	and then our teacher use to go five nines forty five oh right thank you right you and and er he he just use to shoot at us you know with with his
S0013	yeah
S0012	finger and say and that
S0013	we use to play a game call buzz where you have to go round the round the classroom go one two three four say say you be do the seven time table
S0012	yeah
S0013	you buzz when it be like seven or fourteen or twenty one
S0012	oh i see right
S0013	or whichever name you be but really you have to a matter of count up but it be quite good
S0012	well yeah well i mean to make things into game that's that's
S0013	mm yeah anything really
S0012	that's how they try to do it nowadays make them into game don't they
S0013	mm
S0012	so that people learn through game or fun rather than through
S0013	yeah
S0012	oh meticulous sort of
S0013	i suppose most stuff you learn through er a bite of a play don't you
S0012	well yes
S0013	if you can muck about with something
S0012	yeah
S0013	you realise what you have to do
S0012	yeah well i mean er sport and cricket and football and all that sort of thing still help you funnily enough with count cos cricket you
S0013	yeah
S0012	have to score i mean we didn't play cricket at our school mind you well not much well i didn't like it because if you get hit by that ball that hurt
S0013	mm
S0012	i remember this boy he be brilliant bowler he come tear down and bowl the ball and i chuck the bat down and run off
S0013	oh dear
S0012	and i think i'm not gonna get hit by that so no i didn't get pick for for cricket
S0012	i didn't get pick for football
S0013	you run away from the ball then
S0012	i no i want to play football but all all the teachers' pet play football
S0013	yeah they do
S0012	and we be put on the tennis tennis court
S0013	mm

S0013	it's very bad isn't it when they
S0012	yeah
S0013	they do pick the same people for team
S0012	er all the time
S0013	so if you weren't any good in the begin you'll never get a chance
S0012	no
S0013	to get good
S0012	no you don't i score a terrific goal it it be terrific goal and the teacher say no goal why he say you you gotta keep your elbow in while you're run you try and keep your elbow in when you're run
S0013	oh right
S0012	and i though oh you big and er from then on in i never play football
S0013	but there there's only so many in a team isn't there they shouldn't worry about that when you're at school
S0012	no
S0013	cos there's never gonna be exactly the amount for a team so i
S0012	no
S0013	i don't know if they've change it now but you should all be able to play shouldn't you
S0012	you should be yeah everybody
