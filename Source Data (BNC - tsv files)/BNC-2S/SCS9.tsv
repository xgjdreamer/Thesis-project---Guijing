S0529	have time to look around yeah we'll we should do that
S0530	yeah and then i can type up

S0529	we can go to the learn zone cos they've get space in there as well
S0530	oh yeah the learn zone
S0529	and that's open later as well which be really annoy like why be the library

S0529	i know
S0530	how arty
S0529	must be the monet
S0530	must be the monet oh i love your little picture that's so cute you do
S0529	i need to change it
S0530	it's amaze
S0529	cos my hair's longer now it doesn't brush back
S0530	you're so good at hair
S0529	really
S0530	mm
S0529	hair be my weakness i feel like i'm really bad
S0530	really
S0529	at draw hair yeah
S0530	cos you can get that look amaze like
S0529	mm
S0530	it look really like thick and do you know what i mean
S0529	yeah i don't know what it be i think maybe like from my perspective cos i've draw it and i've like do i remember like the process of it that i can't really appreciate it as as just a draw like other people can so i can never
S0530	you see all the flaw in it don't you
S0529	yeah exactly
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	yeah so i can never see my own art the way other people might see it cos people have say to me oh you're so good at draw and just like really
S0530	but you really be
S0529	i i don't
S0530	you're really incredible
S0529	agree with that thank you
S0530	cos i guess that i'm gonna see it as a finish piece you're gonna see it as like
S0529	yeah
S0530	something that
S0529	exactly
S0530	still need work aren't you
S0529	like i remember like spend hours do that hair hat life
S0530	like do you ever feel completely satisfy
S0529	no never
S0530	not of any of them
S0529	no
S0530	no
S0529	you just like the only reason i stop do the draw be because i feel like feed up with it and i'm like right i can't do anything more than this i'm just gonna ruin it even further like i haven't actually draw anything that i've be like properly proud of
S0530	really
S0529	yeah
S0530	that's really sad cos
S0529	i know it be quite isn't it
S0530	you're so good
S0529	i dunno
S0530	i always wonder if people that be really good at art or really good at real draw like you see like cartoon as like really shit or do you just see it as different
S0529	different yeah
S0530	just different
S0529	it's just a different style like i wish i could draw in that style as well because it's more creative to me
S0530	really
S0529	the only way
S0530	really
S0529	i can sort of draw be by observation and
S0530	but i think
S0529	and
S0530	observation's harder cos you can't make up shit if it's not there
S0529	yeah
S0530	you know
S0529	i know well it's difficult cos your brain try to make make it up like especially
S0530	but you have to kind of and
S0529	when you're draw people
S0530	ignore it
S0529	you have to ignore it like no that's not where the eye go like i know it look like it should go there but in the picture it's actually here and it's like really be frustrate to get it right and i don't often get it right like i'm most most of the time when i'm do face now i use a light box because
S0530	oh okay
S0529	it's so much easier to get the face right like cos it's not cheat because so many artists do it and it's just
S0530	yeah
S0529	a basic
S0530	yeah
S0529	like guide of where you want things to go like it you kind of make it your own when you just do the shade so it's it doesn't really count
S0530	that's cool
S0529	that's cheat in my opinion some people might say well
S0530	if you think about it
S0529	it's just a way of do creative art
S0530	in some ways yeah
S0529	so it's easier
S0530	i mean art be less creative than you think it be
S0529	oh yeah
S0530	it's very er
S0529	yeah definitely
S0530	like when you actually do art like everyone see art as creative but when you actually sit and it's like really it's really difficult you know like not that
S0529	yeah
S0530	be creative be not isn't isn't difficult but like it's really
S0529	yeah like i don't feel like any of my art's creative i just feel like i'm look at something and draw it the way i would the way my hand
S0530	but your hand
S0529	work i suppose
S0530	no it's not the way your hand work it's the way
S0530	the way your kind of your brain project it and then
S0529	yeah
S0530	your hand follow
S0529	i dunno
S0530	it's not it's it be a skill
S0529	mm
S0530	it's definitely a skill
S0529	yeah
S0530	like anyone that can do like great art i bow to because
S0530	you know and you be include in that

S0529	and people be like what why can't you paint like you're good at draw like blah blah blah
S0530	it's completely different isn't it
S0529	it be not the same thing not at all or not for me anyway i just make a mess i'm just like a messy clumsy kind of person and i can't control paint when it's in my hand i just get it everywhere and make such a
S0530	me too
S0529	mess and
S0530	i'm not the best painter
S0530	to be honest people think
S0530	that's the thing when you say you enjoy art people think you're good at everything
S0529	i know all discipline but it's not like there be so many different side to it like there be some er people in my art class who wouldn't draw at all and they get through the entire without draw like
S0529	i'm not go on it i'm just go on it to see
S0530	okay okay
S0529	just for the lols
S0530	yeah
S0529	and
S0530	yeah
S0529	and then some people
S0530	i'm not judge you
S0529	no know i'm
S0529	oh just like some creepy guy call
S0530	that's be it's me it's me
S0529	maybe it's you
S0529	oh so creepy
S0530	what's he say
S0529	i don't know there's creepy people on the sexy dentist oh
S0530	yes
S0529	wah
S0530	get some gnashers in
S0529	no he's not sexy that's horrible
S0530	what's he look like
S0529	vomit
S0530	okay
S0529	make me wanna vomit
S0530	lol
S0529	yeah and then some people do like screen print and textiles and all that shit i just wish i could do all of it really
S0530	yeah me too just be like
S0529	and then i could just go to art school instead
S0530	would you like to go to art school
S0529	yes if i could like get into that frame of mind where do art be all i wanna do but yes cos i do enjoy draw when i want to do it just not when i'm be force
S0530	how about if you do fine art here
S0529	mm i don't think you can like i i know they do art here but you have to like have be to foundations and stuff
S0530	oh
S0529	but i do ask from upstairs and she do a foundation and then i look it up and it seem like
S0530	complicate
S0529	it's like they expect that of you like and i don't have that
S0530	oh
S0529	and like i didn't do that well in art
S0530	well that's really annoy
S0529	overall in er a level anyway cos i up my exam god that exam be embarrass
S0530	what your art exam
S0529	mm
S0530	do it go that badly
S0529	yeah it really do
S0530	why
S0529	cos i didn't do any work for it
S0530	cos from what i can see you do well
S0529	no like cos the problem be like at a level they they want you to it be like quantity rather than quality because they can't
S0530	they want more like
S0529	measure
S0530	yeah
S0529	quality cos it's it's subjective like the subject like someone who might like my art might hate someone else's or vice versa so you can't like judge it on how good it be
S0530	mm but you can surely tell if something's
S0530	technically quite good you know
S0529	well yeah i mean cos that that's the point like to get to a level art you kind of have to have some technical ability to be able to just keep up with it but other than that they have to just judge it on how much you've get and how you can show that you've like create something
S0530	mm
S0529	from all this stuff beforehand and i didn't have any like support work like any at all so i just go into the exam do something and didn't have anything to
S0530	oh my god
S0529	back it up so
S0530	excellent
S0529	no wonder i do so badly in it like really no wonder
S0530	you didn't do that badly what do you get
S0529	i get a c
S0530	yeah it's not
S0529	mm
S0530	bad
S0529	yeah i suppose it's a bite average isn't it
S0530	you didn't fail
S0529	no
S0530	nowhere near fail
S0529	i didn't i yeah it's true i could have get an e like i think i get a d in that exam but but my coursework mark wasn't terrible so
S0530	mm
S0529	it
S0530	that's good
S0529	would have boost it up a bite but i still get a c
S0530	i really i don't know why but i really

S0530	we can search the sonnet genre
S0529	gonna have to
S0530	so it's two thousand word
S0529	it be
S0530	okay

S0529	this be the beauty of be like all fuck up and people know about it
S0530	at least people know now
S0529	yeah
S0530	like it's not like oh
S0529	you could get extensions too if you're struggle
S0530	i mean personally in term of actually work for some reason like it's not affect my work that much
S0529	no that's really good
S0530	i don't know why it's not affect my work that much but it isn't it maybe it's cos i'm use work as a vice to kind of
S0529	yeah
S0530	not think about shit
S0529	i think cos you just do it it last year and you're just maybe better at work than i be
S0530	no no i i be shit last year i be awful when i before i drop out of uni last year
S0529	mm

S0529	yeah everyone
S0530	because
S0529	seem to be talk about it
S0530	er i think it's a bite early isn't it like
S0529	yeah
S0530	a smidgen early i mean most people didn't do it sort it out till christmas
S0529	i mean we
S0530	at my last uni
S0529	at the erm survey thing the other week they talk about that and how apparently people be just like get really paranoid about house now and that you you don't have to do this quickly
S0530	yeah
S0529	like you can wait until after christmas
S0530	mm
S0529	and i feel like some people have to cos not everyone's like make
S0530	their mind up about uni
S0529	very good friends or who or who they're gonna live with and all of that like
S0530	yeah exactly
S0529	if i didn't have you lot i'd be completely fuck cos i have no other friends
S0530	yeah yeah exactly
S0529	so i'd be like who be i gonna live with next year lol but yeah it's not i dunno
S0530	if you stay
S0529	i don't think we should worry
S0530	we should all go together next year
S0529	oh yeah absolutely
S0530	definitely
S0529	yeah i'm a hundred percent live with you next year if i'm stay cos
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	i don't have anyone else
S0530	definitely
S0529	oh yeah
S0530	i think it would be nice just to have like a little place
S0529	it would
S0530	use that as motivation
S0529	yeah cos you don't need yeah that's true and you don't need like load of people like my sister only live with three other girls so you don't need like a massive group of people
S0530	yeah
S0529	so
S0530	yeah
S0529	you know any of your friends who might be up
S0530	want to join up
S0529	for that
S0530	yeah
S0529	you know as well
S0530	i've have some people ask me so yeah
S0529	i expect erm yeah so just just say yeah sure
S0530	like we'll all go in together
S0529	the more the merrier cos less rent lol
S0530	that's true actually
S0529	and try and find
S0530	the more
S0529	someone rich who can pay the sky tv
S0530	yes
S0529	that'll be nice
S0530	how much be sky tv
S0529	a lot
S0530	like twenty five pound a month
S0529	i don't know maybe but you can get a deal and then you can get sky broadband but i wouldn't get sky broadband cos it's
S0530	no
S0529	really shit
S0530	yeah
S0529	you can get virgin tv cos virgin broadband be good
S0530	yeah we could
S0529	it would be so fun
S0530	could
S0529	if we actually do this and then we'd have like a little house together
S0530	oh my god
S0529	so be you not
S0530	that would be excite
S0529	gonna stay in college then cos i think you might want to do that
S0530	i don't know cos er
S0529	well don't feel like you're pressure to cos
S0530	no cos i'd rather live with people i like than stay in the college
S0529	yeah
S0530	like it's not a big deal to me stay in the college or not
S0529	no
S0530	it's just like it depend how much contact hours we have next year
S0529	yeah
S0530	cost and shit
S0529	you do get less i think in the second year
S0530	yeah
S0529	because people know that like you you live off campus mostly
S0530	cos yeah i guess you'd go in and then come for the day and then
S0529	yeah well that's the thing really and then it's good because you like actually spend a day and then because you've get nothing er better to do you end up just work like that's what my sister say
S0530	mm
S0529	erm i mean she have a car so it's quite it's a little bite different
S0530	oh yeah
S0529	so it's easier for her to like get around
S0530	she could get around that's good
S0529	and also she like walk to campus sometimes cos it be really close by but because we're a little bite further like we'd have to be in town and whatever and you'd have to get the bus
S0530	mm
S0529	so you would end up just spend the day and probably go to the library and like do work or something
S0530	two fifty a day man
S0529	i know i would probably get a bus pass next year though
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	cos you're gonna be save on like other things like rent will be way cheaper like rent here be apparently really cheap
S0530	that be good actually
S0529	cos we just think we're like pay a lot of rent for this

S0529	so we'll be like pay a lot less
S0530	like a hundred and sixteen a week
S0529	yeah we'll be pay a lot less next year
S0530	so technically that would probably like the price of it would yeah
S0529	i mean i know you have
S0530	that's cool
S0529	like bill and stuff but then when you're in the house with like
S0530	sometimes it's all inclusive
S0529	sometimes yeah it would be good if you could get that but i mean that's mm i dunno
S0530	bill be scary because like what if you use too much of something
S0529	i know it's it's just scary cos i don't know how all that work i
S0530	no
S0529	have no i have no idea how to sort that out with the landlord like how to get a house or anything
S0530	like what if we're use too much what ah
S0529	like the way
S0530	yeah
S0529	my sister do it she just seem to like do it with her friends and she didn't have any like outside help from the uni or something to get a house they just do it
S0530	mm
S0529	and i'm just how be we gonna do this
S0530	i know
S0529	maybe will be
S0529	no but like if yeah
S0529	too fiddly
S0530	if my wrist actually work er

S0530	bling bling
S0529	just need my ears pierce and that's it
S0530	oh you've not get your ears pierce
S0529	no i do have and then i take them out cos i have like i didn't have an infection i just like get scar i would get an infection
S0530	mm
S0529	and then just take them out cos it hurt put them in
S0530	it do hurt it do hurt
S0529	when you've just get them do no one tell you that
S0530	it can be pretty painful to be honest
S0529	yeah my friends have get like nose ring and stuff i'm like that do that not hurt
S0530	oh my god
S0529	the funny thing be my mum would never let me get like a nose ring or a tattoo or anything
S0530	would she not
S0529	but there would be nothing she could
S0530	no
S0529	do about it though like and that's
S0530	oh my god
S0529	all that's the fun i find in it like i would totally do it just to kind of piss her off cos
S0530	would she shout at you
S0529	she wouldn't be able to do anything yeah but so what like
S0530	she couldn't actually
S0529	she'd have no
S0530	she actually do anything
S0529	exactly
S0530	you could get a tattoo if you want to
S0529	i could i could i be think about get a little comma cos i like commas and apparently they be symbolic of
S0530	it's not
S0529	i don't know
S0530	over
S0529	mm
S0530	continue
S0529	oh be that what it be
S0530	yeah
S0529	oh no that's really cheesy i think it be just
S0529	a nice symbol
S0530	okay you don't want that anymore
S0529	no that's a bite shit no like a semicolon that's bite rubbish no i didn't what would i get
S0530	you should get erm
S0529	i'd just probably get like a little moon like a little crescent moon
S0530	that's really nice
S0529	yeah cos i do sometimes draw crescent moon on my wrist
S0530	that's really cute i know people that get like erm cat tattoo and stuff
S0529	oh cute
S0530	like little cat and all that
S0529	that would be so cute
S0530	i'd like a a hairbrush tattoo
S0529	i my god imagine
S0530	like
S0529	like a little hairbrush on your arm
S0530	it's just like yeah
S0529	little black and white hairbrush
S0530	just remember him forever kind of thing
S0530	like just have them on my ankle or my arm

S0530	i know but i'll be like i have that cat
S0530	and he be lovely
S0529	yeah
S0530	but yeah
S0529	no i think i'm too much of a wimp to get a tattoo to be honest it's so permanent and it hurt it would hurt on your wrist as well cos it's so delicate
S0530	yeah i know i always say i'd get a tattoo if i ever publish a book
S0529	oh
S0530	when i be younger
S0529	that's a good idea
S0530	like i'd do it on that condition
S0529	mm
S0530	so i might do it as a milestone but
S0529	you wanna
S0530	you never know
S0529	publish a book
S0530	i i'd like to think i would but i don't know if i've get the motivation

S0530	oh my god me too that's just that's literally the life you'd like
S0529	that be just how you play sims
S0530	it's like you binge it for three days
S0529	everyone be like that
S0530	straight
S0529	yeah
S0530	and then you don't touch it for another few weeks
S0529	you really do but when you're on it you're like shit i've be on this for like eight hours today i'd better get off
S0530	it's actually quite scary how addictive
S0529	it be
S0530	game like that be it's pretty bad but yeah oh i hope erm that guy reply to me tomorrow
S0529	mm
S0530	because he keep
S0530	come online and come offline but he doesn't actually see my thing so maybe
S0529	no
S0530	it's it's like three in the morning in erm thingamajig
S0529	do it say you're online when you're on it
S0530	it say i'm online but it say he he say he be he be online briefly for like one minute like
S0529	oh
S0530	an hour and a half ago but then it be like two in the morning so maybe he just go on for and go to sleep i don't know
S0529	yeah that's probably set at the different time he
S0530	cos he be reply that's the thing like
S0529	yeah
S0530	he reply from about eleven o'clock to three o'clock
S0529	mm
S0530	in today's time and then he's usually absent so i have to get him in that
S0529	what at night
S0530	timeframe in the day
S0529	in the day yeah
S0530	so that's his like even when he's come in from work
S0529	oh okay well just send him another text tomorrow
S0530	yeah
S0529	at that time yeah
S0530	and be like have you do it
S0529	that's my money bitch
S0530	cos i yeah i'm like have you do it and i really wanna hear back from the appeal i'm really scar of not get it because i need that money and i'm just i i've get a feel in my head that i know that they're gonna reject it like ah i feel like they should accept it cos i feel like my case be justify
S0529	yeah
S0530	and they shouldn't have charge me that much for because i leave like how many days like eight days before the end of the course
S0529	yeah
S0530	erm but
S0529	but just remember though it's not your fault
S0530	yeah
S0529	like it's not
S0530	yeah
S0529	your responsibility to pick up the money for this like it's completely
S0530	yeah
S0529	their responsibility cos they
S0530	i know
S0529	have make the mistake here you should get that appeal because your case be just like it it make sense
S0530	mm
S0529	erm yeah and you've get load of evidence you've get like sort of stuff
S0530	and i technically finish lecture
S0529	yeah you
S0530	like i'd finish uni it be just that deadline be because the coursework be gonna be hand in
S0529	mm
S0530	so yeah
S0529	no it's totally unfair like i don't just don't worry about the money
S0530	mm
S0529	but i know it's hard to say that because it's a lot of money but
S0530	i know it be i always say that but it's it's difficult isn't it
S0529	but i mean you you would have you have you get the overdraft yet
S0530	yeah
S0529	have have you do that
S0530	i've i've
S0529	you've do that
S0530	i've do the erm
S0529	oh good be it easy to do
S0530	i've convert it to a student account but i've not apply
S0529	yeah
S0530	for the actual overdraft yet
S0529	oh okay you should do cos
S0530	do you need well
S0529	better safe than sorry
S0530	yeah do be it pretty quick
S0529	mm yeah
S0530	okay cos i i won't need it till like after christmas but still i'll do it
S0529	i mean well cos have you get any money in that account in the student account that you've get now
S0530	yeah
S0529	cos i think you need about three hundred pound to activate the overdraft and then it should just do it
S0530	okay
S0529	like you don't necessarily need to like
S0530	yeah i've get like
S0530	a hundred and fifty or something
S0529	yeah okay
S0530	i'll try and like and when that guy put his money in hopefully
S0529	yeah
S0530	like it'll happen
S0529	which yeah it should
S0530	i'll i'll i think i'll stop freak out when that guy put some money in i think
S0529	yeah
S0530	i'll relax but you know you don't know
S0529	mm
S0530	he's gonna cos he sound genuine and he's not like be
S0530	he just he he's ask me for information and he's say that he'll do it and oh like maybe he's already do it and it's send it now
S0529	it'll just take a while cos it's a different country
S0530	abroad yeah
S0529	yeah but if he doesn't do it then
S0530	it's not the end of the world
S0529	it's not the end of the world
S0530	it's not the end of the world
S0529	and you will still be able to you know sort it out erm you know there be ways round it i'm sure
S0530	oh tomorrow's gonna be a long day isn't it
S0529	yeah i think so
S0530	oh my god you german universities be now all free of tuition fee
S0529	yep i know that one i saw that as well it's so annoy
S0530	for international students what
S0529	what
S0530	let's go to frigging germany
S0529	germany exchange
S0530	german exchange
S0529	we're not twin with any german universities though
S0530	aren't we
S0529	we've only get some like random ones in malaysia and one in america i think but it's not a very good one in america i do look it up yeah
S0530	that's really annoy
S0529	cos i would quite like to go a year abroad but then you don't do much work and you have to do another year usually and it's
S0530	really
S0529	like any less time be er any more spend time spend here be just like not good for me really i wouldn't be able to do four years
S0530	my god no i'd like to do abroad but same like
S0529	mm
S0530	i don't know if it'll worth the oh why do money come down to everything
S0529	oh no but it be no but it would be so worth it cos it would be like your only chance to go abroad
S0530	yeah
S0529	cos
S0530	in your life
S0529	you really you can't really travel like cos we don't have any money like
S0530	yeah
S0529	likewise and this be such a good opportunity
S0530	i'd you'd love to yeah
S0529	cos
S0530	cos
S0529	you'd be protect by your university and they give you fund as well no they don't give you fund but you're you get an allowance i think like
S0530	yeah
S0529	the way you do here
S0530	i think that you if you i think they pay for the
S0529	yeah they do like it's like student finance i think i'm not really sure how it work but you don't have to cover the cost yourself not at all
S0530	mm
S0529	and you know you just it's it just sound like a good opportunity
S0530	yeah it's cool
S0529	i'd really like to do it the annoy thing be that i be gonna go like in the really early stag of this clear thing i be actually gonna go to because they offer like a three month trip to rome
S0530	really
S0529	and venice and
S0530	in first year
S0529	florence
S0530	or
S0529	in first year
S0530	wow
S0529	cos it be history of art and english like those at the same time and i think that would have be so much fun to go to rome for a couple of months not not
S0530	that's really cool
S0529	just rome like all of italy for three months like go on a little tour look at all the art i would have love that
S0530	that's crazy
S0529	i know
S0530	some universities offer so much like more
S0529	yeah they really do
S0530	than others you know they give you more opportunities
S0529	cos 's one of those weird ones that i hadn't really hear of and it's not a bad university
S0530	no it's not
S0529	it's just not really that prestigious it's just quite modest it doesn't like shout about itself and yeah i just sometimes i wonder whether that would have be better for me
S0530	mm
S0529	do history of art as well
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	cos that's more in my comfort zone i think
S0530	's like this secret university nobody know what be
S0529	no i really didn't know about it until last year cos my friend go erm the one that my that i tell you about like who's here as well
S0530	mm
S0529	who who go to my primary school
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	like
S0530	you say
S0529	like be like oh he go there and i be like oh what's and then i look it up
S0530	do you look from picture on the website of it and stuff
S0529	erm
S0530	not really or
S0529	no i didn't really i just look at league table cos that's all i be base it on at the moment
S0529	at the moment cos i'm really shallow like that
S0530	ah
S0529	you see it's just cos my sister go to and i just want to go to a good university like like she do
S0530	what to kind of like compete with her
S0529	yeah
S0529	cos i don't wanna be know as the shit sister
S0530	you're not the shit sister
S0529	no but i be really er in
S0530	why
S0529	context like cos she go to a better university and she do well like at university she do better than me in most things in life generally she's just the better sister
S0530	yeah but she's probably have her own problems as well
S0529	yeah no she have but it's just i dunno yeah i just didn't wanna go to some shitty university
S0530	like everybody have moments in their life when they kind of thrive and find it easier and i know
S0529	yeah
S0530	yeah erm i guess some people it feel like they've be like that all their live like they've just find it easier generally like for me i find it easier at sixth form
S0529	mm
S0530	whereas my sister find it easier throughout school life but she struggle when she get to sixth form kind of thing
S0529	mm
S0530	so i find a level easier but
S0529	be she in her second year then
S0530	yeah
S0529	yeah
S0530	she's at a2 now and she's find it really hard
S0529	so you're two years older than her as well
S0530	yes
S0529	yeah that's like me and my sister
S0530	two year gap
S0529	mm the gap have really close over the years for me
S0530	yeah it do
S0529	like we use to be so like not friends
S0530	distant almost
S0529	yeah
S0530	the thing be when i be when i be really little we use to play together a lot and then there be like a time when be like twelve what sorry when she be twelve and i be fourteen and we be just kind of like we didn't really get on
