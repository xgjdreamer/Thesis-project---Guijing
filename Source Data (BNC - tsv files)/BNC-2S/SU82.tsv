S0084	mm
S0041	and that's that
S0084	yeah
S0041	but if you er if you do wanna be a friend then you have to be a a full friend not just decide what you can and you're capable of cos this whole thing of i'm i'm weak and not good enough
S0084	mm
S0041	you know i'm gonna let you down
S0084	yeah
S0041	be a pile of shit
S0084	yeah
S0041	i say because otherwise i wouldn't have be with you for three years
S0084	yeah
S0041	you never let me down
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	i wouldn't want you as a friend if i think that you be gonna be a crap one
S0084	yeah
S0041	just because you don't keep in touch with and
S0084	yeah
S0041	doesn't make you a crap friend you know
S0084	i mean it's like we say yesterday like this be the point if you can identify that you let people down why not do something about it
S0041	yeah
S0084	it's not like you're eighty and you can't change and you think oh i really like i regret
S0041	yeah
S0084	treat my friends in that way
S0041	do you know the worst thing be when we be together before er before we decide to separate
S0084	mm
S0041	um i do say to him why be you neglect your friendships so much
S0084	yeah
S0041	and i i have say it to him before in the relationship and i use to maintain his friendships for him
S0084	mm
S0041	you know i use to invite tom to things we be do for his twenty second i i take him back up to cos i though oh he's away from his friends
S0084	mm
S0041	i take him back up to to a gig and surprise him i arrange all his friends to be there
S0084	mm that's nice
S0041	um to do that for him and now cos obviously gemma doesn't know him very well
S0084	mm
S0041	she you know she'll not think to do that
S0084	yeah i mean it's early days isn't it
S0041	yeah um and we've cross this bridge before and i say to him at the time you know when we when um when we decide we need to live apart
S0084	mm
S0041	i be like part of that reason be you've never be out of your comfort zone so you don't really know how how to form a bond with someone because
S0084	yeah
S0041	he'd like he have the same part time job grow up
S0084	mm
S0041	when he go to uni he keep it cos he go to uni in the same place he grow up in
S0084	mm
S0041	he never change high school
S0084	mm
S0041	so the same type of people um he could stay friends with some er some people from his cos he go from high school to hnd
S0084	mm
S0041	so he do leave his friends then but he live near them so it wasn't an issue
S0084	yeah
S0041	go to hnd but then obviously you don't then leave college and go to uni cos it's hnd conversion and everyone stay in the same stream so
S0084	mm
S0041	until he move down here with me he'd never his choices consciously or not have never put him in a position where he'd have to work on friendships cos everyone's
S0084	mm
S0041	there all the time and
S0084	mm
S0041	so when he move away i say to him you know it's hard it's hard be away from your friends and you have to make time for people and
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	why don't you go and see and you know why don't you invite him up here and he do a couple of time
S0084	mm
S0041	and not very often but
S0084	mm
S0041	but he say some really awful things liz really awful things
S0084	to you
S0041	yeah about and not just about it be difficult to be around but you know say i mean i be i be i be awful to him like the last six months we be together and i be very control and i do expect a lot from him and
S0084	mm
S0041	i know what he's get at when he's say that if we do something if something go wrong
S0084	mm
S0041	i use to freak out
S0084	yeah
S0041	and i do i do like
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	i don't know why
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos and the strange thing be i'm not like it with anybody else i mean if i'd have go out with samara i didn't freak out it be just him
S0084	mm
S0041	because he didn't in hindsight i should've say this to him but i didn't think the only reason i be like that with him be because i carry him so much
S0084	yeah
S0041	that i i didn't feel i could i could rely on him
S0084	mm
S0041	if we be plan to do something
S0084	mm
S0041	you know
S0084	mm it's difficult to know though isn't it at the time
S0041	it's
S0084	cos you sort of take that person for grant and you think you you sort of it get worse and worse sort of you know snowball and you end up
S0041	yeah
S0084	treat them really badly without even realize it
S0041	yeah
S0084	because it take for you to either wake up one day and think shit you know i've i've be a total cow and i'll try and be better
S0041	mm
S0084	or it take for them to say do you know what you've push me so far i don't think i can take it anymore
S0041	and he never say that
S0084	and he never do it so it's not
S0041	no
S0084	it's you know it's it's circumstantial at this point because you break up and that there be a reason why you do that
S0041	mm well i say to him i say to i say sorry and he be like i know you're sorry i know
S0084	yeah
S0041	how bad
S0084	yeah
S0041	you feel and he say and i don't want you to feel bad cos you know there be good bits as well
S0084	yeah
S0041	and i know you're not like that cos i see what i'm like with you now
S0084	yeah yeah tut oh love well i mean that's the thing you can't beat yourself up too much cos if you think that um when you're oh don't get upset
S0041	mm
S0084	oh honey come here come here don't get upset you know it's there be so much go on feel like i'm a duck feel like i'm stick my arse out do i look like a duck
S0084	come on don't wriggle away come on i don't really like hug you know me that's fine
S0041	and plus
S0084	yeah
S0041	get on the scale
S0084	huh
S0041	four pound down
S0084	shit fantastic
S0041	and i be terrify of get on them after sit
S0084	really
S0041	in bed and eat camembert and maltesers all week be ill all those maltesers and chocolate i eat
S0084	yeah well there you go that's why diet be so retard
S0041	but how do that possibly work
S0084	yeah i know well i have carrot cake at my dad's last night and someone in the office say oh my god you've gotta start eat food and i say er trust me there's not an issue there she say you're look so skinny you've lose load of weight and i be like there be like two days when i have the flu last week when i didn't really eat but that be about it she be like no you're look really skinny and i be like i think er body fluctuate so quickly
S0041	mm
S0084	like er you know day to day they look different
S0041	you just don't
S0084	unless like um it's probably just the heel
S0041	don't notice it
S0084	to be fair probably just like lower by bmi
S0041	yes
S0084	by like five huh
S0041	yeah so i don't know
S0084	oh sweet
S0084	yeah
S0041	and i could see he be start to panic and he didn't want to say anything
S0084	oh
S0041	um and i be like it's alright calm down it's alright um i be like do you want to go and he be like no no honestly i'm fine um and so cos i'd get my arm there i be like stroke his arm and i be like honestly it's fine it's don't don't worry it's okay
S0084	mm
S0041	honestly it's okay
S0084	mm
S0041	cos he be just get himself work up more than anything you know there's nothing really to be scar of but er
S0084	yeah
S0041	it's just daft
S0084	yeah and when you're down there it do seem scary
S0041	um and he lean over and put his head on my head
S0084	mm
S0041	and just hold it there and i be just like uh it's so hard have you that close all the time
S0084	that's i mean it's really unfair of him really unfair
S0041	yeah
S0084	i think because he know he know how you feel about him and he's make it worse
S0041	he i think er he he must know like
S0084	it's out of order
S0041	he be hug me and pick me up and
S0084	mm mm i mean it's hard for him obviously because you know you've go from be in a relationship to just be friends and you know there be that grey area for a few months afterwards but really like that's not okay like as nice as it be for you
S0041	mm
S0084	and you don't want him to stop do it because it's very lovely like that's what's confuse you
S0041	mm oh fuh

S0041	uh what base do you go for
S0084	mm traditional classic
S0041	yeah that's the one i usually go for
S0084	mm hm mm where's sweetcorn
S0041	that's a winner
S0084	that's pretty nice isn't it
S0041	i always add load of them so i have to choose one that's get most of the things i want on
S0084	yeah
S0041	cos i have so many toppings
S0084	yeah that's true yeah but all the other ones have get stuff on that i don't want oh actually if i customize
S0041	couldn't you replace it
S0084	yeah could you just take stuff off
S0041	yeah i think so
S0084	er oo half and half tear between two pizza oh that's only on large isn't it i think
S0041	maybe
S0084	er chicken feast chicken mushroom and sweetcorn see i wonder if you can take the mushroom off
S0041	maybe and replace it with something
S0084	mm like sausages
S0041	do we have wine in or do we need to go to co op
S0084	oh this be really good um there be one that i bring back for your celebratory drink last week
S0041	oh yeah
S0084	cos do you start on the second bottle
S0041	no i don't think so
S0084	no i think that's in there and the um i've still get that
S0041	yeah look
S0041	can tick it
S0084	oh
S0041	winner
S0084	yeah but it's er we open it about approximately a month ago so that's a good amount of time to mature it might just be really strong which be
S0041	well er
S0084	what we want really
S0041	i think it probably just need to mature it want to breathe
S0084	i think it definitely do
S0041	you can't leave something cooped up suffocate
S0084	no that'd be silly
S0041	it might die
S0084	chicken oo yeah sweetcorn oh how's this sixteen ninety nine already
S0041	have you choose large
S0084	yeah that's where i've go wrong right everyone stand down
S0084	stand down er so it's fourteen ninety nine
S0041	maybe that's how much how much be it before
S0084	that's how much it be with all the normal three things
S0041	ah i see
S0084	i think so that's so if you add meatballs what do it do ah see er i think um
S0041	so you've get one more thing to choose that's within the fourteen ninety nine
S0084	oh
S0041	see i always take off mozzarella cheese and add half fat cheese but then get double cos then i don't feel as bad for have double cheese
S0084	interest
S0041	yeah should just have one lot of mozzarella but no i don't do that
S0084	well i mean if it mean that your brain be happier
S0041	mm
S0084	then that's not a problem
S0041	well it's like one of those things ain't it you go to mcdonald's and have a diet coke and there's no point in drink diet coke
S0084	two big macs
S0041	yeah and two big macs
S0084	with large fry duh duh
S0041	so have you be this on the margherita
S0084	this be on the margherita so i think
S0041	put it together and then see
S0084	mm so this so far with two things be twelve ninety nine er twelve nineteen
S0041	oh
S0084	so if i do three things
S0041	thirteen nineteen
S0084	oh it must have take a while to calculate and chicken sweetcorn and
S0041	oh god
S0084	squasages go on then go on then reset what
S0041	oh it take them off
S0084	uh for fuck's sake i think it be gonna calculate it right go on then eleven nine nine twelve ninety nine

S0041	i've have all of them apart from the top one i think but i'm i don't really mind with ice cream cos i barely ever eat it ice cream's great to me whatever it be even if it be plain vanilla so if there's one you prefer

S0084	er mince polar bear
S0084	pour moi
S0041	i stand next to a polar bear
S0084	no you didn't
S0041	i go to the natural history museum yes i do
S0084	oh right not a real one i mean not a
S0041	not a real live one
S0084	a live one
S0041	yeah
S0084	i love the natural history museum i love the dinosaurs
S0041	yeah i'd never see
S0084	they're fuck huge
S0041	the dinosaurs before i can't believe how big they be
S0084	yeah freak you out
S0041	and this make me sound really awful
S0084	oh god mm
S0041	not as awful as the africa thing
S0084	that be pretty bad
S0041	that be pretty bad but i know it sound ridiculous but doesn't didn't didn't part of you think before you saw those do you think dinosaurs be make up do you think they be fake they can't have really be that big really and
S0084	do anyone think that
S0041	well
S0084	apart from you
S0041	i do well i i know they be real cos i know we have proof but i didn't realize how much proof we have
S0041	like i didn't realize we we actually have stuff like that
S0084	right
S0041	i think we have you know some bone and you might've find like a couple of bone that would make a leg and a couple from another dinosaur that would make something else i didn't realize we have actual full skeletons of one thing
S0084	yeah
S0041	no i do not know that
S0084	so you've never be to the
S0041	and i didn't know there be so many different type as well i mean
S0084	yeah
S0041	you know you see like the one with the long thing that eat the tree and
S0084	mm
S0041	the triceratops and t rex and the thing that run on jurassic park and you're really scar that that could be real cos it's not that much bigger than a dog
S0041	but but there be just so many different ones and there be one and i stand next to it and its leg be its knee be higher than your head
S0084	yeah yeah yeah well humans weren't around at the time well maybe they be homo sapiens weren't around at the time obviously because they would've be eat
S0041	mm
S0084	cos all the dinosaurs would've eat them cos they would've be stupid and dinosaurs would've win um er not one part of me's ever doubt them but i suppose that's because i grow up so close to relatively like compare to you
S0041	mm
S0084	we have load of school trip to the science museum and the
S0041	huh
S0084	history museum and
S0041	i would've love that
S0084	it's pretty excite like we do er you be you do sort of take it for grant when tell me she'd never be to until about a year ago
S0041	mm
S0084	cos she'd live in
S0041	yeah
S0084	and it's just too far like your school trip wouldn't be able to get there
S0041	no
S0084	in a day so we yeah er i never consider it wasn't real
S0041	yeah i be say to
S0084	ever
S0041	actually because we be go there i say the exact same thing i say do you know what people always say they wouldn't bring up kid in the city but if i manage to get somewhere to live in in i would bring my kid up in the city centre in you know i'd make the effort to take them to park every every weekend
S0084	yeah
S0041	but just to be around that environment all the time and all those different culture and people and have all those museums just so available to you you know
S0084	er er yeah i mean er we er obviously i grow up in the countryside even though i didn't think i do cos i grow up in a village and i would always say to my mum mum when i grow up i wanna live in the country and she be like uh huh she'd obviously live in for like forty years she be like you be live in the country fyi and in my head i picture the country as like a cottage in a field and not be able to see anybody else
S0041	oh okay
S0084	that be the country
S0041	yeah
S0084	we didn't live in the country and she be like and i think because of that i be quite obviously quite a shelter life but obviously my parent live in when i be bear er you know we move out when i be two and my dad show me a house in the same road he's he's obsess with rightmove you know when you can go and look at properties
S0041	yeah
S0084	absolutely obsess and when i go round on friday night he be like oh i've find a house that's in the same road um as the house we live in in road in er and i be like oh and i in my head i be like god i bet that's worth a few bob cos when we go back to visit it a couple of years ago and it's the same woman live there
S0041	oh yeah
S0084	who'd buy it um she show us round the house and obviously i have no memory of it and er he say guess how much it's worth and i be like five six hundred eight nine five like and it's just it's like a three bedroom house and he be just like
S0041	huh
S0084	i would've make the same decision i would've move you kid out of and i be just like yeah but imagine if you hadn't have kid
S0084	you would have a house that's worth nearly a million pound
S0041	huh
S0084	not be live in an old
S0041	jeebus
S0084	granny flat in i mean that's a decision you make
S0041	mm i get a bite carry away actually think about it when if i go into the navy for four years and i earn thirty grand a year and the likelihood be that after well it would definitely go up at least two or three grand
S0084	yeah
S0041	but pretend it doesn't and i just get thirty grand a year
S0084	mhm
S0041	for four years i and i can now live on fifteen we know that and i'm pay out rent
S0041	there i won't be pay out rent
S0084	mm
S0041	so i could really pocket fifteen grand a year
S0084	mm mm
S0041	hypothetically if i work at it i reckon i could even without much think
S0084	but you're gonna be on a on a boat most of the time aren't you
S0041	and then i get an extra twenty pound a day for be on the boat
S0084	yeah
S0041	on top of the thirty grand
S0084	so that's pretty sweet
S0041	so fifteen grand to save
S0084	mm
S0041	a year over four years be sixty grand
S0084	yeah cos even if you save ten grand and you be realistic
S0041	that's still forty grand
S0084	with yourself that's still forty grand that's a deposit on a house
S0041	yeah
S0084	mm
S0041	so i think oo
S0084	mm
S0041	and when i leave the navy and then they give me money for for towards my new life
S0084	mm
S0041	they give me they help you with your mortgage basically i won't have to go through scary mortgage lenders
S0084	wow
S0041	i i could i could and a pension and other stuff technically i could really choose where i want to live
S0084	that's amaze
S0041	like okay so i wouldn't be able to get in central but certainly kind of zone three
S0084	if you want to if you want to i mean the best er particularly because when you come back you you know you'll want to move out and you'll be i mean in in theory you won't have a fella or something because you'll have be on live on a boat but who know you might
S0041	mm
S0084	shack up with one of your crew
S0041	mm
S0084	er but it'd be it'd be great if you just buy a flat out in
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know outside in one of the suburbs and um i mean even like you could afford something in
S0041	yeah
S0084	and that's it's pretty excite place to live i er i know quite like it but um and then take a view on it cos when you meet someone and when you wanna have kid you might feel differently because it's probably worth live in london just yourself
S0041	mm
S0084	for a couple of years
S0041	yeah
S0084	and make the decision because there's no point think right now i've get a family let's all move to and not know what it's like
S0041	yeah
S0084	because it be mental
S0041	that'd be a bite extreme
S0084	and i mean it i like i mean i love visit i think it's so excite and i've there's always be part of me that think oh maybe i should move but i like leave again at the end of the day
S0041	oh i don't
S0084	i really
S0041	i be i be really upset when i have to get on the train home
S0084	really
S0041	yeah
S0084	well
S0041	i always be
S0084	well that's what be like and i think she do like live there but really i can't see her last much more than a year or so because
S0041	i just can't understand why you wouldn't
S0084	she miss well it's just er it's
S0041	like 's like that
S0084	dirty
S0041	well yeah it's dirty yeah it be dirty
S0084	it's dirty and it's really impersonal because even though there's
S0041	mm
S0084	load of people there and all the time and when you go to bar and stuff it's great because there's a real mix of people which you don't get in everybody's in a hurry everybody's in their own little world and no one really take time everyone's rush rush rush which be just so excite
S0041	yeah
S0084	when you're visit and everything's er massive and i don't wanna lose that mystique i get so excite and a bite like
S0041	oh
S0084	oo i don't know i you know not that i get nervous cos i'm i can i i
S0041	yeah but it's an excitement isn't it
S0084	can navigate myself around
S0041	yeah
S0084	yeah and i think if i live there every day i'd take it all for grant and i it would
S0041	yeah
S0084	lose that sheen
S0041	yeah
S0084	and i don't want it to um i love and i think i'd rather just um
S0041	uh huh i just can't how do i keep this to myself

S0041	why i be so irrate and i be like i just don't understand why make a point of parade down the kitchen and open the door
S0084	mm
S0041	she wasn't go through the door
S0084	mm
S0041	to use the to use the you know the fridge or something cos when i i go in to brush my teeth and she come out and i and the door be open and i'd see her walk past and i just assume she'd use the fridge or something and then i look to see what she be do and she wasn't cook i think oh oh well maybe she be look for something and you know so i come back out and i close the door
S0084	mm
S0041	and i get something else to go to the bathroom with cos the light be better in there and she'd do the same again

S0041	by the time i'd get back to the door she must've follow me out of the kitchen open it on purpose and walk back again
S0084	really
S0041	yeah so i be like why would you do it like
S0084	that's mad
S0041	if you're not use it
S0084	yeah
S0041	it's not bother you why like what's the point obviously at the time i think you be in bed and then i think that's really rude

S0084	they be fuck noisy
S0041	just because it's just go nine it's a sunday
S0084	yeah
S0041	anyway
S0084	yeah
S0041	no matter what time it be
S0084	yeah yeah yeah
S0041	and so i walk into the bathroom and close the door
S0084	mm
S0041	and i think and i i i don't know why but i kind of give her the benefit of the doubt again

S0041	and that's when i start get angry i say well doesn't wake me up walk up the stairs neither do craig and he wear fuck work boot
S0084	mm
S0041	so
S0084	mm
S0041	either you're ten ton
S0041	or you're just be inconsiderate
S0084	it's it's just this be
S0041	like they be just be stupid
S0084	petty isn't it yeah i agree
S0041	and that's why it get me angry cos they weren't even have a conversation
S0084	mm
S0041	or just talk they be just be argumentative be be an absolute bitch
S0084	really
S0041	honestly she be be horrendous
S0084	god
S0041	you know what 's like she just kind of get on her
S0084	mm
S0041	high horse um and she won't listen
S0084	mm
S0041	which she you know i'm i'm kinda use to get that from her now but be actually fight like go for a fight like i would've
S0084	it's mad isn't it
S0041	i would've swing for her
S0084	what the hell's the matter with the girl
S0041	dunno
S0084	no one but no one's be sort of antagonistic towards her no one's cause her massive issue
S0041	well then she say well you didn't ask me to close the door you get up in the morning and slam the door instead of ask me to close it
S0084	mm

S0084	mm
S0041	polite enough to close the door if you're ill mannered that's not my problem
S0084	mm mm
S0041	and i say and you'd think perhaps after the first morning you wake me up and i tell you thank for wake me up

S0041	yeah
S0084	because it turn out it's the most bore thing in the world
S0041	yeah
S0084	so basically um
S0041	my my not my
S0041	at work that you know turn out to
S0084	be a cowbag
S0041	be a cowbag
S0084	mm
S0041	get a flight to that place
S0084	city
S0041	yeah er she have to go for a meet and she pay include tax thirty eight pound
S0084	really
S0041	mm
S0084	tut
S0041	bmi baby
S0084	see we be on bmi baby
S0041	mm
S0084	so cos there's bmi and there's fly
S0041	to
S0084	flybe
S0041	okay
S0084	they also fly from somewhere but the thing be you have to fly from heathrow which be a mother bitch
S0041	oh that be a mother bitch
S0084	so
S0041	she go from stansted
S0084	not to city then she must've go to the international
S0041	oh
S0084	which be cheaper because you fly easyjet or bmi to international but we wanna go well i say to do it really make that much of a difference and she say yes because you're come in the morning city airport to the hotel um actually what i need to do be find 's e mail because that give us locacines this be when
S0041	cos i be think if it's a big difference we could hire a car
S0084	well yeah yeah the old inn dot com so be that it be that the hotel presumably yes
S0084	right it's a logistical nightmare i mean
S0041	a logistical craziness
S0084	yeah i might can you just come to london please because that would really suit me
S0084	in fact can you come to
S0041	you'd really help me out if you could change your entire wed around me
S0084	yeah for goodness sake right
S0041	and stop be so selfish
S0084	stop be so fuck selfish city airport to where do that thing go i click on oh right contact us um what i need be a postcode okay here we go
S0041	be the be the wed at the old inn
S0084	no the wed be in which be the village she live in so the annoy thing be we have to fly into city airport get to the hotel
S0041	mm
S0084	you see thirteen minutes that can't be right be that right i need to zoom out a bite cos that's not very helpful so you can see that's pretty close
S0041	mm mm
S0084	although actually it's the other way so we need to get into the airport go to the hotel get our glad rag on
S0041	yep
S0084	and then apparently the bite that she didn't tell me originally be that we then have to get a bloody train um to the village that she be get marry in which be
S0041	right
S0084	quite annoy oh hang on that's the barcelona thing um okay i would recommend fly into city airport as it's very close to the hotel and will only be a ten minute taxi ride then you can check in and use the facilities to get ready but i'll have to call to make sure we can check in early
S0041	mm
S0084	then you get a train
S0041	or if not they could keep our bag anyway couldn't they
S0084	yeah exactly and we'll just get ready in the loos or something
S0041	yep
S0084	they're gonna have nice toilets and then we can get a train from the nearest station but she's gonna tell me which what that it be direct to which be where they're get marry or a taxi if you prefer but that could be a bite pricey so what we need to do be she need to text me the name of the or we could find out i mean we could actually research that the name of the train station nearest to the hotel which might actually be
S0041	and where's the other airport on this map of wonderfulness
S0084	um belfast international airport be that you be that actually you go go
S0041	go go go go go
S0084	so it's forty minutes do you mean a different um i just mean the airport i don't understand er but why's it come from about five different no that's it isn't it that be the right place so
S0041	that's get an airport next to it
S0084	so that's that's the city so that's so that's the airport that's the city airport
S0041	mm
S0084	because that's the city that's the international airport
S0041	get it
S0084	and that's the hotel so it'd be about forty five minutes which in a in a cab would be
S0041	extortionate
S0084	extortionate so if we put in the hotel which be this
S0041	and be everybody stay at the same hotel
S0084	yeah
S0041	right okay cos i be gonna say if not then depend on where she's get marry
S0084	we could
S0041	we could actually get another hotel with the chain
S0084	yeah well that's what i be think
S0041	between the two
S0084	yeah um if we
S0041	and it would cost us like twenty quid each
S0084	oo
S0041	for a holiday inn
S0084	now that would be an option wouldn't it
S0041	mm like if if it's an option if there's a way
S0084	mm
S0041	if there's a hotel half way between with the last place we've get to get to her
S0084	mm
S0041	and the international airport
S0084	mm
S0041	if there's a hotel between the two
S0084	mm
S0041	then it would work out cheaper for us to do it that way
S0084	yeah
S0041	if that's a real life option
S0084	okay well the hotel to the village be twenty five minutes
S0041	right
S0084	so worst case scenario we can just cab it which i think realistically be what we wanna be do
S0041	yeah
S0084	if we're gonna do that way
S0041	yeah
S0084	because by the time we get ready i don't really wanna miss the wed and i think might have a few things to say about that
S0041	yeah yeah that could be death
S0084	so the options be either we fly from stansted to international and just get another hotel
S0041	yep and if we move move the
S0084	huh huh
S0041	huh pizza
S0084	right get the pizza man get the pizza
S0084	hello pizza
S0041	oo pizza delivery
S0084	yeah finally

S0041	sausages
S0084	mm mm mm mm

S0084	mm
S0041	if the the wedding's just below the city
S0084	mm
S0041	if we fly into that side a bite if there's one between the two
S0084	yeah and then get a cab from
S0041	the
S0084	the reception back to the hotel
S0041	mm could do that
S0084	mm cos that's the only thing we've gotta remember how to get back
S0041	yeah that that's that's probably quite an important factor
S0084	mhm one would hope
S0041	probably quite a
S0084	or sleep in the
S0041	pivotal factor
S0084	hotel toilets
S0084	which be always an option
S0041	yep
S0084	mm
S0041	i mean i don't own a sleep bag but
S0084	mm mm
S0041	i'm figure by the time i've weddinged it up i won't care
S0084	yeah yeah they have get a party bus it's a big red bus that they've hire to drive people everyone from dunmurry to the hotel
S0041	yep
S0084	mm so
S0041	mm
S0084	we could sleep on that mm maybe we can persuade them to drive us to the airport in the morning
S0041	airport party bus
S0084	airport party bus yeah
S0041	that would be pretty good to have an airport party bus
S0084	mm i'm quite keen on that idea
S0084	or we just barricade ourselves in the honeymoon suite
S0041	mhm why do i not think of that
S0084	didn't think of the viable option
S0041	mm well let's be honest they'll be so tire that they'll just sleep on their own chair
S0084	mm
S0041	at the reception
S0084	mm you have to remember that you're party with irish people
S0041	yes
S0084	they can drink
S0041	that's quite excite
S0084	mm yeah glen's an absolute animal the groom he can really pack it away
S0041	do you know what i always think and i think this at michelle's wed when i saw that be that like after your whole day of tiredness
S0084	mm
S0041	and all the drink be your wed night really gonna be a night to remember
S0084	mm well i've think this before you're basically just gonna pass out aren't you
S0041	yeah
S0084	there's gonna be no shenanigans
S0041	no
S0084	you've probably be up since five a m
S0041	yeah get ready
S0084	you've be drink all day
S0041	from champagne breakfast
S0084	mhm
S0041	you're probably gonna die
S0084	mm
S0041	you're probably gonna get back to the hotel and think right you know i really love you and all that but
S0041	and this be my sexy underwear
S0041	i'm gonna sleep in it now
S0084	yeah
S0041	you may look
S0084	and try not try not to vom
S0041	yeah i'm gonna try i'm gonna try not to vom on it so
S0041	if you're lucky and i don't vom you might see it tomorrow
S0041	otherwise this be it
S0041	nice know you glad i marry you
S0084	look forward to the next forty years
S0084	start of things to come though isn't it cos as soon as you get marry the sex be over
S0041	oh that
S0084	so you might as well
S0041	if there be ever a slogan not to get marry i think that's it
S0084	mm just don't do it
S0041	talk to frank just say no
S0084	just say no in fact i might wear a t shirt say that
S0041	and wear it down the party bus
S0084	wear it on the party bus mm coleen and glen won't be on the party bus coleen's quite upset about this idea
S0041	oh
S0084	so she's er try to persuade glen that they should get on the party bus and drive say party bus
S0041	right
S0084	when they have to be i be like you you don't have to be traditional you don't have to like go in your own car and arrive
S0041	mm
S0084	and to have the big pompous circumstances you can just have what the hell you like it's your wed day
S0041	mm
S0084	like the fact that they've ban children which i love
S0041	i'd have totally ban children
S0084	mm
S0041	i think everyone in the country should
S0084	just er for everything
S0041	yeah generally yeah
S0084	well yeah i mean it's not fun be it have kid around ruin everything
S0041	i mean if you're have kid lovely keep them to yourself
S0084	yeah no one want to see them let alone hear them
S0041	mm
S0084	oh yum
S0041	liz the pizza be such a good call
S0084	mm
S0084	we just squash that on
S0041	yep this um
S0084	it's quite
S0041	array of everything
S0084	mm
S0041	there's not a lot of spinach on here
S0084	no
S0041	be there really like token spinach
S0084	mm it's like an introduction of spinach
S0041	here's your token spinach get on with it
S0084	hm yum i hadn't realize how hungry i be
S0041	hm hm hm
S0084	starve
S0041	hm hm hm
S0084	mm i have a meet with my boss today
S0041	mm
S0084	and she basically give me all her project to look after
S0041	oh
S0084	while she's away
S0041	in preparation for the big move
S0084	she be like you know i'm only an e mail away i be like yeah but you're also six hours away and time difference
S0041	mm oh yeah oh crap
S0084	i mean our clock go forward so actually it might not be too bad cos they go forward sooner they're actually they actually in america they get a month longer summer than we do cos they go forward earlier in march and they go back later in november
S0041	that's not fair
S0084	that's not fair so it's completely different to ours
S0041	mm
S0084	and the old battle axe in my office when she go to new york no one tell her
S0041	yes
S0084	mhm hm
S0041	serve you right for be a battle axe
S0084	mhm
S0041	i think you'll find
S0084	mhm she's a massive cow
S0041	all on you
S0084	can't stand her
S0041	love it
S0084	mm
S0041	mm i really wanna go see see the new york bad
S0084	mm i know well it just look amaze i saw this thing on tv the other day and there be this guy in new york who's like this like there's no other place there's no other place like it like everywhere in america be completely different to this and
S0041	good
S0084	it just look really excite
S0041	cos half the americans be stupid
S0084	mm er they're mental as well aren't they
S0041	mm
S0084	rave loonies
S0041	when i um when i be in perugia because there's an international it's like a a university for foreigners
S0084	mm
S0041	there as well as their normal uni um like a lot of the americans go there as part of their course and well they basically cheat so instead of go to the standard uni for their language degree
S0084	mm
S0041	they go to the uni for foreigners
S0084	right
S0041	which i mean you still get a qualification out of it cos i go to that one as well just cos my italian wasn't good enough so i go to the normal uni and they be shit they keep change the class round so you'd turn up and there be no one there or
S0084	mm
S0041	it be just crap
S0084	god
S0041	mm but that's their university education standard
S0084	good
S0041	um so i think right while i'm here i'll enroll in the foreigners' uni cos they're the international qualifications for languages go like a1 a2 b1 b2 c1 c2
S0084	yeah
S0041	so i get my b2
S0084	mm
S0041	really that's quite bad it should've be a c1
S0084	mm
S0041	really c1's like
S0084	degree level
S0041	degree level
S0084	yeah yeah that's what we use in our book
S0041	oh be it
S0084	common european framework yeah
S0041	um but consider when i get there they be try to put me in an a class you can you can see how er
S0084	wow
S0041	bad my italian be
S0084	mm
S0041	mm so i get that bad boy i get my b1 in spanish
S0084	mm
S0041	don't know how because my spanish be really good
S0084	mhm
S0041	but i suppose i be only there for three weeks so
S0084	mhm
S0041	mm um and er the american girl that be on my in my class she be say that when she say she be gonna go to italy all her friends be like why
S0084	what
S0041	mm
S0084	really
S0041	and like she say to them what do you mean why italian and i get to go there for like a semester and obviously from america that's really far
S0084	mm
S0041	that's a really great like opportunity
S0084	mhm
S0041	and they be like but why do you want to go even her family be like what be you talk about
S0041	why be you go there and i be like why don't they understand it she say well apart from me and one other person on in my class
S0084	mm
S0041	i don't know anybody else that own a passport
S0084	hm i know it be bad i didn't realize it be er that that bad
S0041	she doesn't know one other person that own a passport they just don't
S0084	in her generation that's mad
S0041	everyone not just her generation
S0084	mm
S0041	anybody
S0084	mm
S0041	she doesn't know one other person
S0084	mm
S0041	yeah and her family live all over america they just don't own them
S0084	no americans be quite happy in their own country
S0041	mm and even a girl that live er in maine she's spend a lot of time go to canada back and forth and i er i think she work in hotels which be why she do it er her that i live i live with her in lyons
S0084	mm
S0041	um no
S0084	mm
S0041	they don't do it never any family holiday they spend there
S0084	yeah it's mad isn't it
S0041	you know some other state maybe you know
S0084	mm
S0041	like her and her boyfriend live six hours apart
S0084	mm
S0041	mm so their like perception of distance be much greater than ours
S0084	mm
S0041	like you wouldn't think of start up a relationship with someone in scotland would you
S0084	no no
S0041	mm
S0084	but everything's on a massive scale there isn't it
S0041	yeah but no no no passports and if you apply for one then apparently you're crazy
S0084	i just find it weird that the this generation there's not the same there's not a get up and go there's not an attitude of
S0041	mm
S0084	you know the world's a much smaller place these days you know international travel's more affordable and place be you know accessible
S0041	mm but really though
S0084	that they don't think it
S0041	cos then i start to think about it and actually for us to go see well say as far as as far as turkey like ukraine even egypt you know
S0084	mm
S0041	you can get there for under two hundred quid you know
S0084	mm
S0041	you could probably even get to china for if you book it right my a friend of mine find one to singapore ridiculous amount of change but for two fifty
S0084	mhm
S0041	but if you're in america for me to fly to america
S0084	mm
S0041	i wouldn't i wouldn't really think to do that i'd want to
S0084	mm
S0041	but that's a big difference i mean you're jump from the the kind of seventy to two hundred mark right up to five fifty
S0084	mm
S0041	and er maybe their initial flight to leave america start at the five fifty mark
S0084	if it be yeah
S0041	i mean i've never look into it so i don't know but perhaps that's it
S0084	mm i think it's weird as well when go out to her brother live in he's a teacher
S0041	mm
S0084	and i always think in my head cos she be say he'll come over for easter for a week and i be think oh well you just fly round the the pacific fly from the east and fly round
S0041	mhm
S0084	to get to america no you fly west so from thailand he would er yeah thailand he'd go up to tokyo and from there fly to jfk from tokyo and it be gonna take twenty four hours
S0041	what
S0084	it be mental
S0041	why
S0084	and she say the other one he's find be dubai so bangkok to dubai and then dubai to jfk fuck long flight mental
S0041	why
S0084	i don't know
S0041	do someone want be some crazy like war type people own the airspace or something
S0084	i mean i don't know if it's just that they can't it's just too far a distance to fly without stop and there's nothing to nowhere to stop in the pacific
S0041	oh
S0084	i dunno that's my that's my guess
S0041	oh maybe
S0084	mm or whether there's
S0041	ah do you know we can fricking put a a man on the moon and you can't fly over the pacific ocean
S0084	mm well it's mental isn't it
S0041	i bet they can you know i bet they actually can it's just too much hassle like you can refuel in the air can't you
S0084	yeah yeah you can or you can get another plane to come up from somewhere but then from where
S0041	oh yeah that's true
S0084	samoan islands
S0084	not gonna have a lot of petrol
S0084	um yeah i don't know it's very weird so consider he's only come for a week and he's gonna have two twenty four hour flight like when you go to
S0041	oh
S0084	australia and new zealand you for a month at least
S0041	mm
S0084	because the jet lag's a bitch
S0041	unless you're and then you do three weeks and think you've travel
S0084	and consider it travel
S0041	yep yep yep
S0041	which of course it be we all know
S0084	well for for him travel be go to the co op
S0041	in
S0084	yeah
S0084	go down the high street
S0041	but it be in his defence
S0041	it be the longest high street in the uk
S0084	sorry i'd forget that temporarily forget that
S0041	yep

S0084	charm
S0041	and i mean at the time you know you're only what eighteen you kind of
S0084	yeah but do they not sort of self reflect and think well possibly if she'd have a bite of family love and support she might've
S0084	be able to actually do some work like live in her own home
S0084	possibly
S0041	yeah apparently not but at the time because they're adults and you're not
S0084	mm
S0041	you might think you be but you know really you're not quite there yet
S0084	not like emotionally yeah
S0041	then i be like oh god that really be i have do bad and i felt awful and then
S0084	mm
S0041	i go to uni didn't say congrats speak to me the day before i go to uni to tell me that everything that i'd prepare be shit
S0084	nice
S0041	nice
S0084	so have you go through clear
S0041	no i'd get um i basically i apply to do spanish and drama
S0084	mm
S0041	and how ridiculous be this the entry requirements be er straight bs
S0084	mm
S0041	the entry requirements to do french and spanish be straight cs
S0084	mm
S0041	so i call up say you know not get my grade get four ds but obviously they only want three cs so i wasn't very far off point wise
S0084	mm
S0041	um and they say no that's fine we've accept your application you know you're in
S0084	nice
S0041	so i be like winner bite gutted that i didn't do the drama bite
S0084	mm
S0041	get there be there for three weeks and change my course
S0084	yeah
S0041	er it turn out now if you would like to do three languages at any university in the country you need four as
S0084	shit man
S0041	how bad's that
S0084	that's really bad well that's what i do i come in on a different degree because i get a b and two cs at a level and i come in on a completely random degree that no one have ever hear of call cultural study that my mum be like
S0041	yeah
S0084	that'll be really interest and i be like fine whatever i just wanna go and get piss
S0041	yeah
S0084	that'll do
S0041	of course
S0084	get in on that change it and that again that be another one you have to have a and two bs
S0041	mm
S0084	there be no way i would've get in on that no way
S0041	no
S0084	so
S0041	it doesn't make sense do it
S0084	winner it's ridiculous and now a course at uea's really well know for for arts and humanities course and they have the poet laureate teach there
S0041	oh yeah
S0084	it's straight as if you wanna do anything arts base
S0084	gotta have three as four as and you're just like fff
S0041	yeah totally get that
S0084	but they're i mean they're so er ridiculous though you know that's sort of oxbridge level isn't it
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	it's ridiculous
S0041	cos i know when i when it might've change now but when my sister start look she want to do one language mum be try to push her to do two so she go in do spanish and french like i do
S0084	mhm
S0041	completely ridiculous cos she didn't enjoy it at all which be why she's change now um it take her to fail her first year for them to let her change it though
S0084	nice
S0041	cos my mum and dad's
S0084	oh yeah
S0041	a dick
S0084	you do tell me that yeah
S0041	um but yeah every place she look she wouldn't get in to do two languages anyway cos they want straight as even i mean the reason i choose be because at the time which be madness for frigging but um it be second or third in the league table after
S0084	wow
S0041	so it beat i don't know how
S0084	mm
S0041	i cos they work it out on teach and like research don't they but i don't know yeah so it be like either joint second or third i know and be above it
S0084	mm
S0041	um and i saw there saw and i just like that everything in be all in one place and it look pretty cos it be all full of grass and i
S0084	fine
S0041	didn't have to get a bus to different lessons
S0084	fine
S0041	so
S0084	well that's a good enough reason
S0041	yeah so even when i get my result when i get into uni no congrats no well do no nothing
S0084	fuck me
S0041	and it wasn't until i come back from live abroad for my twenty first
S0084	yeah
S0041	that my mum tell me how proud she be of me i'm so proud of you you know you're such an achiever not like er my sister
S0084	so even though she's give you er pay you a compliment she's put your sister down
S0041	yep
S0084	so she can't do both
S0041	no
S0084	she can't compliment both of you
S0041	oh no it's a it be a run joke grow up that either or i have to be the bad guy
S0084	nice
S0041	er at either any one point
S0084	mm
S0041	one of us have to be in the doghouse all the time
S0084	fuck hell
S0041	yeah and so it's follow up by a backhand dig at
S0084	mhm
S0041	and that you know you'll go you'll go much further than you know what she's like try to get by on her try to get by on her look and her a laugh and a smile and you know er you know that there be that doesn't last you know i'm so proud of you and you'll go really far and she be like um and then i and i be like oo that you know that's really nice of her to say it shit about my sister but at the time we just know
S0084	but your sister be be a bite of a cow then anyway wasn't she
S0041	oh yeah
S0084	yeah
S0041	of course but we know anyway that if one of us
S0084	mm
S0041	be get praise the other one wasn't
S0084	mm
S0041	um and then she follow it with the comment of tut i know i know kick you out would stand you in good stead and i
S0084	no she didn't
S0041	yeah and i say and i didn't say anything and i just like um right and she say you know you just need that time you need that time to grow up and you know mature and you know it be sink or swim you need to stand on your own two feet and i know you'd do it and that's why that's why i kick you out and she basically samara be gobsmacked at the time she basically put my entire success
S0084	er
S0041	on her kick me out
S0084	er i mean er
S0041	yeah
S0084	you huh you can't actually fathom it can you you can't actually think that a mother
S0084	someone who give birth to a child
S0041	i know
S0084	manage to justify
S0084	kick her firstborn out the door
S0041	yeah
S0084	but it's okay you've turn out to be a success and in fact actually it be all
S0084	all my do
S0041	yeah
S0084	so well do you but really
S0041	thank mum
S0084	you should be thank me
S0041	yeah
S0084	actually for cause you such heartache for the last
S0041	yeah
S0084	what five years
S0041	yeah
S0084	and er everything precede that
S0041	and then about er maybe eight months later when they buy the bungalow
S0084	mm
S0041	um we go to see the bungalow and my dad oh my dad be in hospital so it must've be a year after that um and we're sit in the car and she say to me can i ask you something i say yeah course you can she say um tut you know that that time that you spend in barnsley which be where i you know oh look at me and my shelve of boob
S0041	um that time you spend in do it do it really affect you and i say er and i think she be be quite heart felt and think a bite of remorse be
S0084	mm
S0041	come out here
S0084	mm
S0041	and then i felt a bite bad and we be sit in the car together and she be close proximity and i be like oo oo this be gonna be weird
S0084	although but that she have to ask you
S0084	she can't empathize with the fact that a sixteen year old child who at their at that point think that they know it all but of course they don't
S0041	mm
S0084	actually need their parent as more than ever
S0041	mm be spend half their days
S0084	it might find it
S0041	off school in the social security office
S0084	yeah
S0041	try to explain to them that i couldn't get them
S0084	yeah
S0041	you know er er a either a what's the person call
S0084	who what your social worker
S0041	social worker's letter or a police letter to say that i be independent and need their help
S0084	mm
S0041	without that you can't even get help from the state
S0084	mm
S0041	and i be like well no i can't cos i might be sixteen but i've be independent for quite a long time
S0084	mm
S0041	no i be seventeen either way by the time i get all of this sort i'll have turn eighteen so this'll be a waste of time and conversation
S0084	mhm and thank
S0041	well yeah cheer
S0084	while we're here
S0041	this be what i pay my tax for
S0041	you know i work
S0084	i just want a chat
S0084	actually you know i've just come here for a
S0041	yeah
S0084	a gas bag
S0041	just want to talk to someone
S0084	cos you're really ineffectual
S0084	so the fact that she actually have to ask you
S0041	yeah
S0084	be that a bite difficult for you she couldn't actually think shit that must've be really hard
S0084	it's gonna be really difficult for but you know i need for whatever her reason be that's the point where she say this be why i've do it
S0041	yeah
S0084	not it's all your fault
S0041	yeah
S0084	you know and it's you know to be able to have a frank conversation about it she need to say you know it be either it be really hard for me or i can't believe i do it or whatever
S0041	or i do it for this yeah
S0084	but i think er obviously er you know sort of reinforce the mentalness that she the override idea behind it seem to be that she be be a martyr
S0041	yeah
S0084	she be kick you out
S0041	yeah
S0084	probably quite hard for her
S0041	yeah mm
S0084	be a mum
S0041	mm
S0084	must've be really difficult for her
S0041	cut the cord
S0084	yeah with all that
S0041	yeah
S0084	extra space in the house
S0084	well i mean what do she do with the room
S0041	you know cos er her husband work away and it's just her and my sister in a four bed house yeah
S0084	yeah
S0041	yeah
S0084	spend all that money must've be quite hard
S0041	yeah mhm
S0084	yeah
S0041	that she's never work a day for
S0084	yeah
S0041	yeah that must've be really difficult
S0084	yeah
S0041	so i think she be gonna like you know get a bite upset and or perhaps
S0084	mm
S0041	say sorry so i felt a bite bad and i be like oo you know cos i know my mum's old and
S0084	mm
S0041	i know she's get a bite of a craziness
S0084	yeah
S0041	and so i be like oo
S0084	tumour
S0041	yeah tumour so i be like um er i say er you know what it do but don't worry about it because it be difficult it be hard but it's over with you know water under the bridge and you know i've make life life friends out of it actually
S0084	mm
S0041	and i stand on my own two feet years before anyone else i'm quite proud that i do it
S0084	mm
S0041	in hindsight
S0084	mm
S0041	so er er just don't worry about it just forget about it
S0084	mm
S0041	you know think we'll we can build something from now
S0084	you can move on
S0041	you know my dad's nearly dead
S0084	mhm
S0041	and you know we need each other this should be a family unit and yeah no that be not the way she lead the conversation
S0084	what do she say
S0041	so i be like no mum no no it's okay don't you worry oh tut well i think that would be the case you know i have no choice you leave me with no option and i think oo i don't know what to say to this now so i think i'm i'm not gonna say anything you really do leave me with no option you be just so impossible like as if i be like on drug or something
S0084	mm
S0041	um i'd have say er i say do you know what we don't need to talk about it
S0084	mm
S0041	we don't need to worry about that now it's years ago let's just you know slate
S0084	concentrate on now
S0041	let's go and she say no it's my fault i fail you as a mother
S0084	right
S0041	and i think mm be this gonna be a cos i do badly you know it's hard when your dad be away
S0084	mm

S0041	it's not love
S0084	but i probably will see him again cos he's quite funny but he's just mental like he's a roofer but he also write screenplays
S0041	obviously the two go hand in hand
S0084	naturally but he say that he doesn't watch film in case they corrupt his
S0084	ability to write screenplays so i be like so you actually haven't when be the last time you watch a film and he be like probably about four or five years ago and i be like right the thing be film move er on quite quickly so if you're not keep up to date with
S0041	in the loop
S0084	what's go on how be you gonna keep yours current and he be like oh well i get really annoy cos he be write a love story about vampires and um they have a baby and i be like i dunno if you've ever read twilight
S0041	huh
S0084	but ff that's not dissimilar
S0041	i think that might've be do now
S0084	yeah i be like the vampire thing the market's pretty saturate i dunno if you're really gonna like find your niche there and he be like yeah yeah yeah it's really great i read it to my kid and i be just like fff okay then you fuck mentalist
S0041	what
S0084	yeah
S0041	rewind
S0084	er he's get three kid it turn out
S0041	turn out
S0084	mm and a crazy ex girlfriend who sell her son for a blackberry he be like yeah she's really mental and i be like so
S0041	oh my god oh my god
S0041	she she
S0084	it's like something out of
S0041	she sell her baby
S0084	yeah
S0041	i be gonna say jezza but i prefer yours
S0084	uh right
S0041	oh god
S0084	the thing be he's so even though this be this be the excellent thing
S0041	mm
S0084	so even though he
S0041	mm
S0084	procreate with someone who's fuck mental
S0041	mm
S0084	he decide to do it three time
S0084	because cos once be just the test two time forgivable she's still mental maybe the third time be the charm
S0041	yeah no
S0084	no turn out she's still mental so she's they be together nine years and the eldest kid's thirteen and they live in and he want them all to live with him but he
S0041	oh not they as in him and his crazy girlfriend
S0084	no he live here on somewhere over there in it's like a sort of student house it's not nice it's him and this other bloke who's never there basically he can't keep his have his kid round cos he hasn't get any spare room
S0041	space yeah
S0084	so he's look to move out but he's basically just agree a settlement that mean that he will have custody of the eldest son so he's get a son and two daughters and he take the the the woman his ex to the phone shop and buy her a blackberry and then get her to sign the paperwork in the in front of the lawyer so he tell her what to say and then she go to the lawyer with him and then parrot fashion repeat it back to the lawyer and the lawyer write it down and they both sign it so even though he's like he didn't you know say right if i get you a blackberry you've gotta give me our son he buy her a blackberry and then produce the paperwork and she sign it so essentially that's basically what's happen there and er he he say over time
S0041	she sell her son for a blackberry
S0084	yeah yeah yeah quite bad he be say she doesn't do anything with them like she doesn't talk to them really she doesn't read them stories she doesn't do time table with them like all the stuff that your parent do with you

S0084	it's really nice
S0041	we ought to go on a sunday afternoon though
S0084	we should
S0041	and do the hunt
S0084	yeah i mean it's just so close isn't it
S0041	um
S0084	yes er
S0041	what be i go to say yeah so there be a like an exhibition
S0084	mm
S0041	like i be tell her about people want to move to australia and you go there and there's people come to exhibit
S0084	oh yeah that's right
S0041	there's one in london on the twenty sixth um
S0084	mm
S0041	she ought to do that really than rather than go
S0084	yeah
S0041	to sta travel i suppose
S0084	yeah absolutely get rid of the pizza tracker
S0041	whilst it be obviously the most important thing
S0084	it's definitely the most important thing do i actually wanna eat some more pizza right
S0041	right
S0084	so if i zoom out a fraction basically can we that there be international that
S0041	so what so this to here be pretty good
S0084	that's pretty good that be that er hollywood
S0041	obviously
S0084	be city airport and that be the hotel where they're get marry so
S0041	they're get marry at the hotel
S0084	oh no i mean at the reception they're get marry there
S0041	oh right no i miss that
S0084	sorry
S0041	get it
S0084	so international airport city airport
S0041	yep
S0084	hotel where the reception be wed venue
S0041	right and if er hypothetically
S0084	mm
S0041	we go from er airport
S0084	mhm
S0041	to holiday inn
S0084	yeah
S0041	to wed
S0084	mhm
S0041	to reception
S0084	party bus
S0041	then where do then
S0084	that that be a bite of a bitch to get from there to a a mythical hotel here
S0041	right
S0084	i mean er honestly er it would be just as easy to get something in the city of belfast
S0041	yep
S0084	because we could get a cab in or
S0041	or a train in
S0084	train just as easily
S0041	get it
S0084	into the city out again
S0041	yep
S0084	to the
S0041	for ten minutes
S0084	venue yeah because that would be easy to go to like the mainline train station
S0041	party bus it up
S0084	party bus
S0041	and
S0084	stay there
S0041	yep
S0084	or come back because we're there
S0041	because we're already there
S0084	rather than there
S0041	so really the next question be how much be the flight to the to this place
S0084	international
S0041	and where be the holiday inns situate
S0084	i um
S0041	oo oo oo
S0084	what be you do
S0041	oh free free blanket
S0084	mm
S0041	because we might find that on those date
S0041	maybe it's no difference
S0084	yeah i think the price be probably gonna be the same i think it's just gonna be how much of a hassle it be when we get there and in which case
S0041	mm
S0084	we might as well just if we go from heathrow we have to figure out how to get there because the flight's at seven a m
S0041	mm
S0084	so what we could do be stay with chrissy in brixton on the thursday night
S0041	mm
S0084	kip on her floor the first tube i look from brixton be five twenty six a m little bite antisocial
S0041	huh
S0084	which be the first one and that start at victoria line and and you can change at green park and pick up the jubilee which take you to heathrow so er it should take about forty minutes so you'd probably get there at just after six flight's at seven in theory that should give you enough time cos we'd have do online check in just gotta get through
S0041	mm yeah
S0084	um
S0041	just get through security
S0084	baggage so and in theory that'd be enough time or we can drive down and park up but we're look at the park like the cheapest park be still like thirty quid overnight
S0041	mm
S0084	and it's literally like park er at the bottom of the road like it's so far away from the terminal that
S0041	yeah yeah yeah
S0084	you need
S0041	whereas if we do er fly to the the wrong airport
S0084	mm
S0041	and go from stansted
S0084	mm
S0041	then can get us the sales director can get us free park and lounge entry for like a tenner per person so you get there you get free drink
S0084	mm
S0041	and dinner and whatever like sandwich i mean not that you're really gonna want it at that time in the morning let's be honest
S0084	but come back and it's
S0041	come back
S0084	good to know that you've get a lounge et cetera
S0041	to fall asleep in
S0084	mm so if we say we come back the next day cos we will we will want to and go
S0041	go now think you'd better go now
S0084	so mm oh that's gatwick we don't want gatwick we want stansted luton oh er huh stansted okay
S0041	stansted which date be we go on again that one
S0084	on the friday yeah the wedding's on the friday
S0041	right
S0084	so we get in at ten past nine
S0041	right
S0084	and then say we come back the next day what er at one thirty that give us enough time to check out and stuff doesn't it and we'd get back at
S0041	yep
S0084	a decent time so that be considerably cheaper than oh i be like hang on wait a minute how do that make ninety two pound that's for two of us
S0041	oh
S0084	er whereas if we fly with bmi from heathrow it'd be a hundred and fifty five pound and we'd be come back much later on the saturday
S0041	ah
S0084	which be a bite of a bitch because we'd get back to london the only flight leave be this
S0041	mm
S0084	be this one oh hang on yeah we can do that oh we get in at six that's not too bad
S0041	it's not horrendous we'd be back for kind of eight o'clock
S0084	mm or if we want the cheaper one it'd be a hundred and thirty three pound but we wouldn't get in until half nine and then you've gotta get back across london
S0041	yeah
S0084	you don't wanna be do that
S0041	that's a bite of a killer
S0084	so realistically we'd have to do that one we still wouldn't get home until ten o'clock at the earliest probably cos
S0041	yeah
S0084	by the time we get out across london on a saturday even um so say that's a hundred and fifty five
S0041	okay
S0084	and then that's a hundred i mean it's pretty cheap isn't it
S0041	mm
S0084	that be right stansted to yeah so we would fly in i've lose it here
S0041	right so next question be google holiday inn
S0084	okay
S0041	or in fact before we do that
S0084	mm
S0041	we'll go and we'll just put the employee thing on
S0084	the who now
S0041	er i can't remember the website but it's basically the people who work for website
S0084	right
S0041	for employee rate
S0084	oh nice so er do it just depend on like availability in the hotel that night
S0041	yeah but really even if i can't even if it on this website tell me that i haven't get it
S0084	right
S0041	i can just get leo to e mail them and ask for a favour
S0084	oh really
S0041	yeah i mean he can only really pull in favour in london
S0084	mhm
S0041	but the likelihood of someone in the hotel know someone up there be quite likely
S0084	mm
S0041	and we just say i know you've not get this on but because they put it on if it's really definite that they'll have room
S0084	mm
S0041	that they wanna sell
S0084	mm
S0041	but in actual fact everyone every single hotel that's own by ihg get a certain amount of days per month they have to allocate to staff
S0084	mm
S0041	for usually anniversary days or something like that
S0084	oh that's good
S0041	so technically leo could e mail and say look i've get er someone come up for a wed it's really important
S0084	mm
S0041	can you allocate a day
S0084	mm
S0041	for employer rate please
S0084	mm how's it all go with leo
S0041	um pretty cushty now i mean the killer be that you and i both know
S0084	mm
S0041	it's all complete bollocks
S0084	mhm
S0041	you know he's best bud be really nice friends and tell me how good i'm look now and keep up with the train and rah rah rah
S0084	mm
S0041	but you know it's actually a lie you know
S0084	mhm
S0041	he'll stab me in the back at the first chance he get
S0084	mhm
S0041	in fact if he doesn't tell if it wasn't for the fact that he hat
S0041	he would've probably tell her before now that i'm move want to move no thank i do not wanna participate so in
S0084	mhm
S0041	what day do we wanna check in
S0084	the eighteenth of may
S0041	mhm tut nineteenth of may
S0084	be there any word on the take over
S0041	er not as of yet the the everything should go through by fifteenth of march we're look at at the minute
S0084	mm that's the hilton
S0041	well there's no official party line on that but the people that be bid already own hotels that be own by the hilton
S0084	oh
S0041	so it it would be look that way but apparently have put a really strong case forward
S0084	mm
S0041	so and i mean as much as they own hiltons we're in a city we've already get a hilton
S0084	yeah
S0041	so either you have to plough more money into our hotel to make it a five star
S0084	mm
S0041	or you've get competition from your own brand and if the own brand any time anyone google it
S0084	mm
S0041	two brand same
S0084	mm
S0041	er you're gonna choose the cheaper option
S0084	oh yeah
S0041	so
S0084	well
S0041	i think if they do that they'd probably shoot themself in the foot
S0084	mm do seem a bite silly
S0041	this be not me this be not me cos this be best available we don't want that we want the
S0041	employee rate i think not a none of this no no not now no no no no no
S0084	have you do it wrong
S0041	yes mm forward slash no forward slash tut no forward slash employee no mm
S0084	maybe if you take rate out of the um search maybe it's confuse the poor thing
S0041	tut where be that
S0084	be that not it employee reservations
S0041	no um we're gonna go on let's try dot com forward slash employee maybe it'll give us like there'll be an option
S0084	hm
S0041	oh here we go no this be it
S0041	huh that's pretty good we're in dollars
S0084	mhm
S0041	but you know we don't want the airport do we
S0084	we want international not city
S0041	okay check in er do you say eighteenth
S0084	mhm
S0041	really shouldn't work in events you know i can't remember date
S0041	people call up and enquire and i have to ask them a million time what the hell date they ask for
S0041	if i've not get a pen
S0084	be it not like when you ask for directions and you and they go right you just turn leave and that's that's when you stop listen
S0041	yeah that's it that's all you take in right so it should give us a map to say all the available
S0084	mm
S0041	hotels here we go so tut from the city centre there's city at eighteen pound this be divisible by two by the way
S0084	nice
S0041	yeah um there's this one at twenty five there's wherever this be on the m2 at eighteen
S0084	huh
S0041	so there's three hotels we can choose from um
S0084	amaze
S0041	it'll load the map to give us where they be please do still do
S0084	so they don't have then they just have holiday inn
S0041	um if there's 's in the area they'd give me the option as well but the
S0084	yeah
S0041	's usually around forty
S0084	mm
S0041	to share between two
S0084	oh
S0084	nice but that's fine isn't it i don't know if i've ever stay in a holiday inn
S0041	oh it's pretty bog standard like they're clean they be they're clean they're comfortable there's just no like
S0084	mm
S0041	there's no flat screen er no actually there be flat screen the last one i stay in you know there's no twenty four hour room service
S0084	mm
S0041	there's no concierge
S0084	mm
S0041	um
S0084	but they're better than a travelodge premier inn
S0041	yeah
S0084	mm
S0041	it's yeah it's it's probably like actually we stay in a premier inn near alton tower and that have twenty four hour check in
S0084	mm
S0041	and on site restaurant and they be pretty good but i always think the advantage with a holiday inn be that the staff be train to the same extent as the intercontinental staff be train
S0084	mm
S0041	like we're all train
S0084	that's true
S0041	the same way so
S0084	yeah
S0041	the service be always there
S0084	better quality of service
S0041	although you know when we be in um london
S0084	mm
S0041	their staff weren't half as good as our staff
S0084	really
S0041	yeah like when i check in they they proper bollocks up my reservation
S0084	oh
S0041	um and i didn't wanna cause too much of a stink cos i think like
S0084	yeah
S0041	i know you're gonna get into trouble for this cos i know
S0084	mm
S0041	it be through a friend of 's that i get that rate in the first place it should've be forty quid more
S0084	hm
S0041	er i can't see this this map
S0084	mm
S0041	maybe we should just put these in the map
S0084	er click on it mm yeah it's get it's get a postcode have it
S0041	mm
S0041	it will
S0084	we could just put the address in
S0041	er yes i didn't wanna kinda cause too much of a scene
S0084	mm
S0041	so i
S0084	er what be it that they didn't have your reservation
S0041	they have it but they didn't know i'd already pay for it
S0084	mm
S0041	and they think that i be pay extra for be able to go in the club lounge
S0084	mm
S0041	be i fuck no don't think so
S0084	mm
S0041	so that's where this be
S0084	that's the distance from the hotel from the airport
S0041	where be i look
S0084	that say city we don't want that one we want that one
S0041	belfast international airport
S0084	put your two finger on the mouse mat and scroll down that's it
S0041	oh so
S0084	twenty miles be that
S0041	from the airport
S0084	well that's fine
S0041	it's er
S0084	how long would that take to drive
S0041	about half an hour
S0084	mm
S0041	maybe we if we go back we can get the actual go back oh be this this be not the page i be on i have press one haven't i please say i press it
S0041	yeah so here we go this be the map so there's one we don't want number three
S0084	no
S0041	so we've get number one or number two to choose from
S0084	mm
S0041	number one's twenty five pound number two be eighteen pound
S0084	mm
S0041	and this be one point one one miles from the city centre and that's nought point three so that's right in the city centre
S0084	mm mm if you go up
S0041	mm
S0084	er i mean from the airport it doesn't really make much odds do it
S0041	mm mm
S0084	but from the hotel be we'd be at the reception
S0041	yeah
S0084	er two look like it's nearer
S0041	two look like it's nearer main roads doesn't it
S0084	mm

S0084	so international airport so if you cut copy that and put it in the destination b or it doesn't really matter just put international yeah that's right
S0041	that one
S0084	yeah
S0041	sixteen minutes
S0084	uh uh miles
S0041	miles oh thirty two minutes
S0084	mm
S0041	it's about half an hour from the airport although hypothetically
S0084	we could get a train
S0041	we could get a train
S0084	mm
S0041	or where's the where's the hotel
S0084	um it's that one it's that tab can you copy the postcode
S0041	so this be basically the journey
S0084	mm
S0041	that we would be save otherwise isn't it
S0084	mm
S0041	cos we'd just stay there
S0084	yeah
S0041	so it's twenty at the longest twenty three minutes here in a cab
S0084	mm well that's very doable isn't it
S0041	and we can also do train back to airport
S0084	yeah
S0041	as oppose to cab from here to airport
S0084	we definitely could on the saturday couldn't we cos we'll have time
S0041	mm
S0084	my worry would be
S0041	on the way in
S0084	wait for train yeah
S0041	yeah we'll probably
S0084	i'd rather like suck it up i'd pay i'll pay for the cab
S0041	cab it cab it to the
S0084	yeah cab it in
S0041	to the wed
S0084	mm
S0041	yeah definitely
S0084	and then get the train out cos we'll have time
S0041	cos then we won't have to rush
S0084	we won't need to worry
S0041	and if you you know you can spend time get ready can't you
S0084	mm i just don't wanna panic
S0041	yeah
S0084	cos if if we're fly to belfast international our flight get in later
S0041	oh do it
S0084	so if you click on easyjet i think it get in at nine ten outbound
S0041	gatwick gatwick
S0084	yeah there we go arrive nine ten be it yeah so we leave at five to eight and we get in at ten past nine
S0041	and what time's the wed start
S0084	twelve thirty
S0041	yeah so we get a cab
S0084	cos by the time we get out of the airport it'll be ten
S0041	yep get a cab there
S0084	get a cab get there at half ten
S0041	yep i mean the other thing be as well that we could do be cos by the time we get to the hotel the hotel check in be at two
S0084	mm
S0041	so we can request early check in
S0084	mhm
S0041	but really probably don't wanna check in cos er check in at early check in will be twelve
S0084	okay
S0041	and we'd want to be leave by then wouldn't we
S0084	we wanna we wanna we need to have leave by er quarter to twelve at the latest
S0041	yeah so we really just wanna get the cab drop the give the luggage to
S0084	mm
S0041	reception
S0084	mm
S0041	and leave it there
S0084	will they be able to do that will they be to hold our luggage
S0041	oh yeah yeah
S0084	and
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	will they mind us check in at at eleven o'clock or twelve o'clock p m
S0041	in the morning p m
S0084	after we
S0041	no you just tell them
S0084	get back just tell them
S0041	just tell them
S0084	okay
S0041	yep what i'll do be i'll e mail them and double check everything
S0084	okay
S0041	but they shouldn't really care
S0084	well that sound fine so if we say hm do i bring a pen in with me yep it's under your buttock
S0041	in under my buttocks
S0084	cos we've basically talk around in circle for the last two hours so if i
S0041	thirty million years
S0084	jot this down on my mazuma huh envelope
S0041	yep
S0084	um i mean we could book the flight now in fact maybe that's safest do you reckon do you wanna make er this decision now i just wonder cos that's quite cheap
S0041	yeah
S0084	it's only fifty quid or forty five quid
S0041	yeah we should probably do it
S0084	mm
S0041	just so it's do
S0084	mm
S0041	cos you never know we might look at this in a week and it might've go up might've double
S0084	mm
S0041	yeah i think we should just do it just get on board and do it
S0084	okay i could
S0041	or
S0084	put it on my card er
S0041	do you want to wait until i've e mail the hotel in the morning
S0084	i think this be probably the better option because then we don't have to worry about get into london and get out again i think either way
S0041	oh yeah
S0084	we should we should book into
S0041	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0084	international
S0041	yep even if we
S0084	even if we can't stay at the hotel
S0041	can't check in at proper time
S0084	mm
S0041	yeah okay deal
S0084	and i think we could pay on my card
S0041	yep
S0084	or we can pay on your card and
S0041	or mine
S0084	i give you the cash
S0041	it doesn't make any difference well i've get cash in my purse just think it be a good idea to draw out load of cash
S0084	well that that's a brilliant idea well in that case if i pay on if i pay if i pay on my if i pay er pay on your card i can give you cash cos i've get load of cash that you've just give me and my worry be that i'm so bad with money that i've get load of cash on me then i spend it
S0041	oh right
S0084	the thing be if you've get a bite of cash and i give you more cash then you might have cash for trudy
S0041	we can do that
S0084	yeah that
S0041	yep
S0084	sound alright hm
S0041	so
S0084	we're go to be this be this this be definitely what we want isn't it go out five to eight come in at ten past nine yeah that's right
S0041	leave the next day at one thirty
S0084	it's friday saturday yeah that's right
S0041	yep i mean we're gonna be dead we'll sleep to death on the plane and we'll be
S0084	yeah
S0041	hungover to fuck but
S0084	that's fine though isn't it
S0041	you know
S0084	that's the good thing about it that come back on a saturday cos basically sunday's a write off
S0041	yeah
S0084	so it's sleep day
S0041	sunday's a complete write off
S0084	mm
S0041	yeah that's it if you stay the extra day you come back late
S0084	mm you're gonna be knacked
S0041	dead dead and also this way with leave on the friday i don't have to take the thursday off work if i don't want to
S0084	yeah exactly
S0041	like we can drive down first thing or last thing
S0084	mm
S0041	well first thing probably i'll um i'll find out about about the park and stuff as well
S0084	oh yes that's so much better because the hotel that she want us to stay in be a hundred and thirty pound a night do i tell you
S0041	no
S0084	she say it start off be ninety pound a night and i be like holy jesus that's ridiculous and then she say oh no ellen her sister's just book her room it's actually a hundred and thirty pound like it look beautiful like we'll have a look at it in a minute like it's a really nice place to get marry
S0041	mm
S0084	but to insist on people stay there and it be a hundred and thirty pound so even if both of us stay there like could you imagine if i didn't have a plus one i'd have to pay that on my own
S0041	on your own
S0084	a hundred and thirty pound
S0041	mm
S0084	and with the flight and and you know whatever else that's why i'm not gonna buy new dress i'm just gonna have to dig out something from my closet
S0041	yeah
S0084	unless i can find something in a boot sale
S0041	i reckon i can rock my er maxi dress
S0084	mm
S0041	the one that look like it's break glass
S0084	yeah i'm gonna wear the green one with the white flower from warehouse with the yellow belt
S0041	i like that
S0084	cos that's quite spring like
S0041	i like that mine's not very spring like but i mean the plus for this for me be that i don't know any of them
S0084	exactly
S0041	so they don't know what i usually wear or whether this be out of character or not which be a lovely
S0084	well yes
S0041	lovely place to go
S0084	yes yes yes yes
S0041	as long as i look presentable they're not gonna care about my fashion sense be they
S0084	er no i think it's a one come one come all type affair which be fortunate really okay
S0041	ready
S0084	shall we book it continuez okay so we're say
S0041	okay
S0041	luggage we don't need to take luggage do we
S0084	no just pack our pant in our handbag
S0041	yep don't need priority bore bore
S0084	bore not at that time in the morning
S0041	travel insurance really not a point for what we're pay
S0084	i've get travel insurance
S0041	do you wanna take your ski you've get travel insurance
S0084	i do annual travel insurance cos mine's virgin it's twenty pound a month er twenty pound a year
S0041	wow
S0084	and that's sixty er oh it's ten pound so it's ten pound every time you fly so i mean you might as well do it it's i do it when i go to australia because obviously your insurance be so much higher if you go
S0041	mm mm
S0084	that far internationally
S0041	i do have annual for the past i haven't hadn't for the past year though
S0084	i only yeah i mean er that and the year before that i be in prague and and i be go to berlin a lot as well and i just think oh it make sense
S0041	mm
S0084	like
S0041	yeah it do
S0084	i won't have to worry about it every single time
S0041	do we have a promotional code
S0084	um five five five five five five
S0041	do you want me to google it and find out if we have one
S0084	five five five five five
S0041	be we fly with easyjet
S0084	easyjet er can you do that
S0041	mm
S0084	promotional cod for easyjet god you're a fricking genuis
S0041	depend if they've get any go doesn't it
S0084	yeah
S0041	so that's for february
S0084	mm
S0041	may two thousand and six oh no
S0084	what year be you live in two thousand and six
S0041	two thousand and six
S0041	right that's no help to me
S0084	this be all very long ago i can't believe the holiday inn be gonna be eighteen pound a night
S0084	per per double room
S0041	yep
S0084	oh i hope we can get it that'd be good because even if we be get taxis it's not gonna be that much it's not gonna equal sixty five pound a night be it
S0041	no
S0084	versus nine pound because we would've have to get cab anyway
S0041	yep yep yep yep
S0084	and it's nearer so even though belfast international be nearer to the hotel that people be stay in it's actually further away to the wed venue whereas our hotel will be nearer to the wed venue
S0041	yep and even though
S0084	so it's all much of a muchness but the flight be much cheaper
S0041	and even though it's further away from the hotel
S0084	mm
S0041	we'll get a cab from the hotel but then we can get train
S0084	exactly yeah
S0041	so as oppose to cabbing the whole way
S0084	mm
S0041	okay
S0084	get in there get in there oh i be suppose to call chrissy tonight uh
S0041	hm hm hm to say hello be it me you're look for
S0084	i just call to say i love you dunmurry what i need also be the venue the wed venue which i don't have
S0041	mm fff
S0084	i haven't even have a wed invite
S0041	that's probably you haven't even have a wed invite well
S0084	i mean er i be invite to the wed because coleen to say here's where the it be but i haven't have a wed invite i'm surprise they didn't
S0041	hm
S0084	just do it on facebook actually fazbook
S0041	le le fâché
S0041	no thank you
S0084	party bus and then
S0041	alright we've have this okay i want to continue please no look it's try to sell me hotels now fitzwilliam belfast seventy four

S0041	shove that up your arse
S0084	hyundai no bentley

S0084	mm
S0041	and you want to er car it
S0084	yeah
S0041	thirty quid a day
S0084	it's really cheap
S0041	job do
S0084	mm especially if there's a group of you
S0041	yeah imagine if four of us be go over
S0084	mm cheap as chip
S0041	share eighteen pound by four people
S0041	and thirty pound by four people if you think about it this way it's cheaper for us to go to belfast than it be to go into cambridge for the night out
S0084	it's that's probably true actually isn't it
S0041	yeah
S0084	so at the moment so the flight cost
S0041	what be your e mail address
S0084	um
S0041	that's not my e mail address it's you

S0084	they give you this status history with these number that don't mean anything to you and even with the explanation you don't understand and i get a store card from when i be young and stupid and i pay it off but i think it's still gonna take six years to clear all of the crap that's on there cos i like miss payments and stuff so and that stay with you for years i think it be six years isn't it
S0041	yeah
S0084	and then they write it off
S0041	mm mm i've get a credit card it's gonna be go soon when be the last time that i be a i think we're look at when i be about twenty twenty five now so that's four years so in two years that's the last thing on my credit history

S0041	yes i do i tell you what i do miss a bite of a package holiday
S0084	it be
S0041	only because you don't have to think
S0084	it be easy isn't it
S0041	like you actually don't have to think of anything
S0084	yeah
S0041	they just herd you like cattle
S0084	yeah
S0041	i mean the downside obviously be that they herd you like cattle
S0041	and um you have to get on the plane with the huh we go to this place once where be it we go i remember we go somewhere on a say package
S0084	mhm
S0041	and what we use to do be because we go on holiday quite often
S0084	mm
S0041	we have our own travel agent and we basically tell her when my dad could get off time off work
S0084	mm
S0041	you know in this month or this month or this month and she would we'd say we'll be pack and ready to go you say where and as soon as she have a cancellation
S0084	mm
S0041	we'd basically pay a third of the price
S0084	nice
S0041	for like five star holiday
S0084	fuck
S0041	cos someone at the last minute have to say no cos er she deal with so many people
S0084	mm
S0041	we didn't care where we be go
S0084	yeah
S0041	we'd just say yeah fine
S0084	just go
S0041	do yeah
S0084	wow
S0041	so
S0084	that's awesome
S0041	i mean we only ever go to normal holiday place like corfu or
S0084	mm
S0041	you know ibiza or just normal family place
S0084	but it's just get away though isn't it
S0041	mm um and stay in the good nice place
S0084	mm
S0041	and she be like er yeah we'll do we've we've get this do you want this yeah okay
S0084	mm
S0041	we'll go there just any time but it mean that we'd see all the normal normal place but we go to um land a grotty
S0084	nice
S0041	which actually be very pretty when you go to see the volcano and the green lake and all that stuff
S0084	mhm
S0041	you know the tourist bits that's what we do we always have a couple of day of be tourists um cos obviously and i be still children
S0084	mm
S0041	and we get there and we get on er some type of easyjet flight and er some people get on the plane and instead of have hand luggage tesco's carrier bag
S0084	oh bless
S0041	the s
S0084	oh bless
S0041	the s get on the plane
S0084	oh
S0041	they have carrier bag
S0084	oh fff that's go wrong hasn't it really but i mean go be the days where you could get a flight for two p and any old bloody man and his dog could get on the plane
S0041	yeah
S0084	in fact i actually do get a flight for two p to from stansted because they didn't charge you to pay on your
S0041	no
S0084	do you just get charge to pay on your card
S0041	yeah i think it be less though than if you get charge to pay on a credit card
S0084	so do i owe you money for that though how much do it come
S0041	no it be all like that
S0084	do it still come to ninety three it be
S0041	yeah yeah
S0084	altogether
S0041	that be yeah
S0084	oh okay um yeah cos then if you pay on it use to be with ryanair if you pay with electron they didn't charge you visa electron but they do they charge you for everything now apart from their own credit card and er i book it and with with there be no tax no vat i'm not quite sure how but it be two p and i so i use my mum's visa electron card pay for it give her she be like you don't have to give me two p
S0084	so essentially it be free for me
S0041	free
S0084	cost my mum two p that's that's the most
S0041	god
S0084	bargainous flight in the world so then when i when i have to pay like a grand to fly to australia
S0041	huh
S0084	i think well i've have some really cheap flight in my life like i get
S0041	this be probably equal itself out
S0084	yeah when i fly back from cuba will and i book our flight in the january sale we fly back with virgin obviously separately cos by that time we weren't talk to each other
S0041	of course
S0084	um i didn't realize cos he'd book that flight and i'd book the flight in to texas and he book the flight out of havana and um i hadn't look at the ticket until i'd get to the airport and realize it be premium economy and i know that that flight only cost three hundred and ninety five pound to get from havana to london and er they be like oh right this way and like no queue you get in there
S0084	and you sit in the virgin flight you sit upstairs like the hoi polloi all sit downstairs you go upstairs to premium economy armchairs er have a glass of champagne sit on down here's your flight sock what would you like to eat for dinner they serve you with gloves
S0041	really
S0084	the whole shebang and it cost me three hundred and ninety five pound and er there be this old boy in the seat next to me and he's do a lot of business in the caribbean and i didn't really ask him much about it and er i be like can't believe this i get my flight for four hundred quid and he be like what be you talk about
S0084	and i say oh i get my flight in the january sale how cos by this point it's like the end of may and er he say this flight cost me two thousand pound
S0041	huh
S0084	he be rich though he could afford it but i be just like i didn't i didn't
S0041	gutted to be you
S0084	at that point er i didn't realize how much of a deal it be
S0041	yeah
S0084	yeah it be really really really good really good cos that's what i be hop i'd be able to do this year with the new york flight but they just haven't come down in price at all like you i think the best option be really to book it last minute
S0041	mm
S0084	and get a cheaper deal that way rather than try and book ahead cos i don't think
S0041	just wait until the weekend
S0084	think they go down
S0041	and just say look i can go tomorrow
S0084	yeah just i'll go on standby just put me on a flight
S0041	yeah how much do they go down by then if you go on standby
S0084	a few hundred quid
S0041	oh
S0084	cos they wanna fill the plane so they'll put you on rather than put nobody on
S0041	yeah well that's good then
S0084	you i think you could probably talk them down when er actually before i be with him and his then girlfriend fly out to australia they be there for a year they be live in melbourne i'd speak to them every so often and they'd say you know just get a flight you know just come out it can be really cheap er you know come out on standby be like four hundred quid i be like it's such a risk though like if you've only get a couple of weeks off work you can't really justify stay in heathrow airport for a couple of days wait for a flight or wait
S0041	mm
S0084	for a seat to come up like it's it be a bite of a gamble but you're better off do that as a loner than you be with a family
S0041	yeah i mean it's okay if it's okay if you're go out to stay with someone
S0084	mm
S0041	but if you're pay for a hotel
S0084	yeah exactly
S0041	that's the killer isn't it cos then you
S0084	mm
S0041	you're pay for days in the hotel that you're not there
S0084	mm that's why when any sort of natural disasters happen you're better off be a loner like be a lone back packer or whatever cos they always deal with you first
S0041	oh do they
S0084	cos yeah what they do oh i wanna remember who be tell me this someone's friend work at the airport it might've be who i stay with in melbourne she be say that when the volcano errupted and when the snow come you know er people be strand what they do be they target the people who be on their own particularly back packer back packers cos er then they're go away for age and they'll say look we'll pay your hotel cost but we'll just put you on a flight in a couple of days' time be that alright and they go fine
S0041	whatever
S0084	so they'll just put them up in like er the nearest three star hotel for a couple of nights cos what be that a few hundred quid and then they'll which they claim back on the insurance anyway i suppose and then they prioritize the families cos they're the ones that be gonna kick off cos they've only get like a five day holiday book so you're better off be a loner actually most of the time because
S0041	mm
S0084	the airlines will actually give you quite a good deal
S0041	yeah
S0084	cos and then
S0041	well it make sense really doesn't it
S0084	yeah and then you say oh i'm stay in a five star hotel when i get to bangkok and they're like no you're not
S0084	you're stay somewhere that's gonna cost you three pound a night
S0041	you're not no
S0041	no
S0084	look at you
S0041	you say i work for ihg oh that's the thing um you know i always just think you know cheap hotels that's great don't really think much about it
S0084	mm
S0041	but um i choose this one cos er of the feel of it would you have guess
S0084	it's pretty nice
S0041	can't help but touch
S0084	i like all the um the the detail
S0041	er yes so
S0084	mm
S0041	er sales director's want to go to dubai for easter with his family
S0084	mm
S0041	and the cheapest hotel he could possibly find be he be look at two grand a night
S0084	no
S0041	i kid you not
S0084	how many of them be there
S0041	um four five
S0084	fuck hell
S0041	five two grand a night
S0084	that's not possible though surely
S0041	yeah his his his holiday quote um come in at twenty six grand
S0084	no way
S0041	yeah and he be like have you see this have you see this he be just like what the fuck like
S0084	er that's the point when you just think right back pack around france with the family it be then
S0041	it be yeah caravan it up
S0084	you can't have twenty six grand holiday
S0041	no so he be like what the hell and then he find out that he could get um employee rate at the intercontinental
S0084	mm
S0041	and now his whole holiday not include flight er for the two weeks be cost him two and a half grand
S0084	nice
S0041	compare to twenty six five star intercontinental
S0084	sweet
S0041	and you think really they could charge maybe not twenty six grand but i'm sure it's about fifteen it's quite a lot i know the quote that he get er he get a a lot less than half price
S0084	wow
S0041	mm
S0084	that's mad isn't it
S0041	yeah so i mean you can never get it in london cos they always sell all the room but he's want to go
S0084	mm
S0041	at easter where they're not guarantee trade
S0084	mm
S0041	so yeah come obviously cos it's on the employee rat per room not per person
S0084	mm
S0041	so he can get a family room
S0084	mm
S0041	for him and his wife and the two kid cos the kid be young in one room
S0084	wow
S0041	so it's one eighteen pound a go
S0084	lovely
S0041	well not eighteen pound for there but yeah
S0084	whatever it be oh that's a winner
S0041	that's i mean if we go to nottingham for my birthday
S0084	mm
S0041	we'll pay the eighteen pound or twenty five depend on which one we fall into
S0084	mm
S0041	but for four of us
S0084	hm oh
S0041	cos it'll be two double bed
S0084	well if you don't mind do it mate that's awesome
S0041	yeah
S0084	thank you
S0041	fuck eh
S0084	yeah
S0041	yeah
S0084	so
S0041	i figure we need to take them for all we can while i still work there
S0084	absolutely use and abuse use and abuse have you think about which weekend you wanna do it
S0041	i think it's probably wiser to do the twenty eighth the weekend after
S0084	mm
S0041	because people have be pay
S0084	that would be sensible
S0041	that be the thinker er but then i also think that that will take us into the same month as wed month won't it
S0084	true that true that
S0041	so cos i i mean i don't really mind not do it at my birthday time cos we could always do it the month after and do it some time in june
S0084	well then to be honest the wed we've now pay for the flight
S0041	oh yeah
S0084	you have a dress i have a dress the the the cost be gonna be any park that we have to do at stansted if we decide to drive down
S0041	mm
S0084	and a bite of petrol money um and the cab and er and a bite
S0041	yeah so really
S0084	of money for drink so er it's not any different to just go out one weekend
S0041	oh yeah that's true
S0084	so you'd be do that and then do nottingham so it would be a bite more pricey and i've get actually for me i've get another wed the weekend after
S0041	oh
S0084	so that would be a bite of a pisser
S0084	yeah cos i've get
S0041	that might be a bite of a pisser
S0084	sophie's wed in on the saturday
S0041	yeah
S0084	and i be look at hotels in and er it's just not possible like there's nothing below eighty five pound a night
S0041	in where
S0084	yes
S0041	in where
S0084	yes in
S0041	okay i can can't get you employee rate but i can get you friends and family rate
S0084	oh how much would that be
S0041	i don't know

S0041	we actually um we have on a we have a board in our we have a massive whiteboard like the size of that space
S0084	mm
S0041	on the wall we write all sort of shit on it but part of it be important date in the city
S0084	mm
S0041	or weeks that we've get symposiums in or stuff so we can put the price up
S0084	mm
S0041	so we know we're gonna be busy so if someone ring and enquire and we know we've get group in on that day we put the price up
S0084	okay
S0041	and um one of them be during pikey weekend
S0084	what be that the official term
S0041	when all the gypsies come for
S0084	oh yeah
S0041	they always try and book in the hotel all the hotels in the area they do
S0084	do they
S0041	but none of the hotels let them in the one hotel we we do accidentally let some in last year because we didn't know they be gypsies
S0084	right
S0041	we end up i think with just one room and they refuse to let them in
S0084	mm
S0041	they come to the hotel desk girls in trackies they have a bull dog on a lead she be straighten her desk at the reception desk while she be queue she ask someone to plug the straighteners in over the plug desk
S0084	no
S0041	yeah and nick be like fuck they're blatantly gypsies man
S0084	shit
S0041	so
S0084	how do you turn them away without them stab
S0041	sorry
S0084	you in the eye
S0041	sorry we're full really sorry but we've over book we can out book you
S0084	huh where do they put them
S0041	doubletree cos we'd rather pay an extra hundred pound and book them out
S0084	and the hilton put up with them
S0041	hilton don't get a choice
S0084	really
S0041	if you out book someone then they don't know the client until they turn up so we just say oh we're over book
S0084	and then they and they can't turn them um away once they're there
S0041	well they can but they'll probably
S0084	they're gypsies and they'll stab them in the eye
S0041	yeah so we know the they sometimes go to belfry
S0084	mm
S0041	and don't turn them down or they didn't use to cheapo hotel they don't give a shit
S0084	mm
S0041	but apparently they let a load in last year and they steal all the tvs
S0084	oh my god
S0041	out er even out of the bar take them off the wall
S0084	how how do they manage that just rip them down
S0041	mm
S0084	shit
S0041	yeah they've take them off the wall they be go into the hotel even though they weren't stay there like one have book a room
S0084	mm
S0041	i forget my key there be like twenty of them in a room there be nothing leave in the room they steal the lot
S0084	fuck me and that's the thing cos
S0041	bed linen pillow
S0084	that's disgust
S0041	curtain everything
S0084	yeah that's that's why they get such a bad name for themselves isn't it
S0041	yeah cos i'm sure all of them aren't like that
S0084	mm mm
S0041	but then
S0084	well it's all very well protect an old tradition traditional way of life and travel around and make money by sell pot and pan but the fact that they just they steal and rob in order to
S0041	theft be against the law
S0084	in order to fund a lifestyle that mean they don't have to get a job er well that's not okay actually
S0041	no
S0084	we all have to get a job why don't you have to get a job because your tradition dictate you don't have to get a job well no that's bollocks
S0041	mm
S0084	no i'm not have that
S0041	no i tell you before i'm sure the girl that serve me at the tan shop's a gypsy
S0084	mm
S0041	i'm sure she be
S0084	mm
S0041	but she's nice enough
S0084	yeah yeah
S0041	she's obviously work for her money so yeah we don't let them in and um we've be lucky this year actually we've take a group book from some society and sell about a hundred and fifty room but out of two hundred that's pretty good
S0084	right
S0041	we usually don't take group book over seventy ever
S0084	oh right
S0041	we probably take like three of thirty
S0084	okay
S0041	to make us up to sixty and we don't book out any more cos we can sell the room for three hundred pound a go whereas if i if i book them in advance then my client'll want it at one forty
S0084	oh okay
S0041	so we leave about half the hotel empty
S0084	mm
S0041	like an airline the closer you get we'll whack it up
S0084	okay
S0041	but we get a group book this time and they're only pay one forty a room it might be one twenty but we don't give a shit cos usually we would have the hotel empty
S0084	mm
S0041	we'd rather lose like maybe ten k for that night than risk the damage
S0084	mm mm yeah that make sense doesn't it it's really funny when you once you start work in that industry like what you find acceptable like if you be the consumer you'd be outrage to learn that obviously that what you think what you suspect be true that you know certain events push price up and when things get busier the price go up like as a consumer you're like for fuck's sake why do it have to happen but once you're on the inside you're like yeah brilliant get those price ratchet up
S0041	give me the money
S0084	yeah
S0041	yeah i'm awful
S0084	mm you're just go a good job you know that's that's what the job dictate you sort of make that call when you take the job don't you like
S0041	simon and i last week
S0084	that's what you do
S0041	accidentally price the same job
S0084	mm
S0041	um
S0084	do you price it differently
S0041	oh yeah he give them two hundred twenty four hour rate i give them two twenty
S0041	he give them forty two rate i give them fifty five
S0084	that's hilarious
S0041	i mean to be fair i have allocate them a larger room he'd be a bite stingier on the space which be how they could've get it cheaper
S0084	oh okay
S0041	so really
S0084	mm
S0041	have they pull us up
S0084	mm
S0041	we be quite consistent
S0084	mm
S0041	but i'm more competitive than he be if i can the money out of them i'll give them the bigger room whether they need it or not
S0084	mm
S0041	in fact if i know that when they turn up it look like they warrant it it
S0084	mm
S0041	and usually actually so far it's prove well because people if you can't afford it they won't give you the money
S0084	yeah
S0041	and then i'm i'll bump it down but people have turn up get this big space and have go wow
S0084	mm
S0041	oh she's not marry
S0084	no no look like she's just go to her school prom
S0084	but how i love the way that they complain like you're the one who wear this ridiculous monstrosity of a dress

S0084	mm
S0041	really extreme and they're basically take to the street and

S0041	no
S0084	and in your mind make the connection that all muslims be extremists
S0041	no he wasn't actually he wasn't say that

S0084	mm
S0041	um recruit more radical muslims
S0084	mm
S0041	to follow this guy's name i don't know cos i wasn't really pay a lot of attention
S0084	mm
S0041	um and you know force girls into marriage and really really extreme view
S0084	mm
S0041	but the the kind of idea of a conversion rate between the three percent muslim
S0084	mm
S0041	and the percentage of those that be extreme
S0084	mm
S0041	be really very high whereas the he be argue that the percentage of people of other religions convert them to like bnp style
S0084	mm
S0041	craziness
S0084	mm
S0041	the conversion rate be much smaller and so he say the reason why we're campaign against it be not campaign against a race but rather campaign against a religion which would encourage people to do that and the guy that be film be say but it's not er a religion that's encourage people to do that it's the people like
S0084	exactly
S0041	it's the crazy people
S0084	yeah
S0041	and he say but either way the only correlation be the thing that they believe in and if they can justify if they can justify it
S0084	mm
S0041	then can you imagine when we become more multi cultural and twenty per cent of the country be muslim
S0084	mm
S0041	once you up that conversion rate you're to an extent that we won't be able to control anymore
S0084	mm
S0041	and it wasn't he wasn't as racist as i expect him to be
S0084	mm
S0041	like i expect it to be like holy fuck this this man need burn at the stake
S0084	mm
S0041	and he he be er he be really quite extreme but he wasn't irrational which be surprise he he seem quite educate for a yob you know he be still blatantly a blatantly a yob
S0084	mm
S0041	but um i know it er doesn't really make sense do it
S0084	i think it's all it's all it's just what he say be very suspicious like where be he get his facts from it seem very unlikely
S0041	yeah
S0084	that he's actually do any proper research because really he
S0041	yeah
S0084	want to believe what he's say you've get a small proportion of people three per cent a conversion rate on three per cent be gonna be higher than a conversion rate on the same number of people
S0041	that's what the filmer be say
S0084	and you know we live in an actual fact like white british people be become more secular
S0041	mm
S0084	so we're er veer away from be a religious country
S0041	yep
S0084	which be allow for a greater rise in other type of religion so you know
S0041	yeah
S0084	whether it's muslim or sikh or you know buddhism judaism whatever it be
S0041	those gypsies
S0084	gypsies lovely gypsies
S0084	i mean the fact be
S0041	yeah
S0084	anyone can believe what they like so long as they're not indoctrinate other people and i think any kind of extremism whether it's edl versus extreme muslims
S0041	yeah
S0084	it's it's all dangerous
S0041	it's all that's the thing
S0084	and he's gonna say anything he can in fact educate extremists be far more dangerous than yob extremists because
S0041	yeah
S0084	they're more eloquent they can put together an argument and they can encourage people who be live in areas that be become run down
S0041	yeah
S0084	that they should join because their job be be take
S0041	that's exactly what he be do that's exactly what he be do
S0084	they go to areas that be struggle
S0041	he be say that this be part of history and i'm think right you've go too far now
S0084	mm
S0041	there might've be part of your argument initially which i agree with
S0084	mm
S0041	i wouldn't never i wouldn't ever act upon it but i do agree with some of it but it
