S0474	that be perfect time
S0456	yes
S0474	cheer
S0456	chin chin
S0474	do you think those bricks over there be for that build or for the
S0456	they look like flagstones don't they oh yeah they've
S0474	before you mean
S0456	dig out in front of the build
S0474	oh yeah
S0456	so a big moment and out come a giant carrot
S0474	you excite
S0456	yeah i to take me so
S0474	oh we've get a plug oh cos it's not
S0456	yeah so here it's already on eu and this be this be these ones be brilliant because you just put it in and then screw it fast
S0474	wow it's lovely we don't need these bits yet do we it's handy to have a foreign plug
S0456	yeah so wherever you like now by way of comparison yours look better
S0474	it's so much lighter but it's cos it hasn't get a battery in
S0456	ah
S0474	ah it's smaller but it's a bite thicker which be probably better for your hand
S0456	yeah
S0474	what do you call it ergonomic
S0456	ergonomics yeah it definitely look
S0474	oh nice
S0456	like the success be more down to that doesn't it
S0474	yeah
S0456	instead of the frame it be well you can tell a bite more use it's it's only a fraction larger
S0474	apparently as well this be more this be a protective case and it
S0456	it use a yeah
S0474	it's make out of
S0474	the material be like solid the colour so if you scratch it it's still the same colour if you know what i mean
S0456	yeah well same as this one
S0474	yeah and also the button be water water and dust proof
S0456	ah huh very well if you open it and then you can find out hang on where's the battery here ah and look it speak french
S0474	huh
S0456	oh no it speak everything
S0474	and spanish
S0456	and spanish you can have the spanish one or german it just doesn't speak finnish or english
S0474	i think i'll let you take it out of its case
S0456	oh yeah i remember i have have that issue before you can
S0474	it feel more like a toy than this one do you know what i mean
S0456	thank you what do i do with my apparently you press it here and then there but then that didn't work for everything else
S0474	i kind of nearly do it
S0456	yeah it be something like this come on phone
S0474	maybe if you tip it the other way up so you get it out like a cake
S0456	no i
S0474	like this
S0456	like a cake
S0474	yeah like you know when you're get a cake out of a tin or an ice cube
S0456	yeah that's the
S0474	out of a tray
S0456	that's the idea but i've get it now anyway
S0474	oh
S0456	i have yeah i have it yeah
S0474	yay
S0456	dual sim
S0474	yeah
S0456	so you can actually get a finnish sim if you'd like or a spanish one or
S0474	well
S0456	or a south american one so yours be dual sim and mine claim to be
S0474	ah
S0456	yeah it's standard size
S0474	well if we know i have the post stock i'd get a finnish fin now sim a finnish sim
S0456	well you would get a pay as you go they're not expensive anyway thing be i can always ask whether i can have a second sim
S0474	ask who
S0456	ask
S0474	oh yeah oh wow so we but so it work with your number two sims
S0456	i wonder i wonder whether it's right you'd better get your
S0474	so essentially would be the same person
S0456	well i'll i'll have to find out er so the battery be smaller
S0474	okay
S0456	but
S0474	i definitely think the water shorten the life of my battery
S0456	yeah
S0474	either that or or it wasn't a good a good model for battery life and this be the improve one
S0456	well they're both three point seven volts this one have slightly fewer amp here micro amp here
S0474	do it matter which one i put it in it doesn't do it
S0456	no
S0474	i can lead a double life with this can't i
S0456	oh god don't tell me that there'd be all these men that be after don't don't close it yet you need something else

S0474	call i think
S0456	oh yeah call

S0456	just look for your message depend whether they be
S0474	yeah
S0456	yeah
S0474	oh look twenty twelve
S0456	i'm there twice what do it say
S0474	hope you get my love letter a picture now
S0474	oh there's only three message on it not yours be that all sims hold these days three message
S0456	i i don't know
S0474	there might be a way of shuffle them round the different apps but if you go on this one and click on it there you can switch sim
S0456	yeah which obviously i can't yeah i think it that but i've only get one sim slot the other be doesn't exist
S0474	yeah should be able to put the torch on a hot key
S0456	yeah i haven't do any hot key cling cling
S0474	chin chin
S0456	happy yeah i mean that look like the matt version doesn't it and this be the shiny blue version
S0474	yeah this probably look more expensive doesn't it
S0456	yeah
S0474	the way the button be than this
S0456	we know it isn't
S0474	i think it's lighter
S0456	that's good
S0474	yeah
S0456	i can definitely confirm that that one be more expensive than that one
S0474	thank might even be able to go on the internet have a quick look at something what should i go on yahoo or what's the all this
S0456	won't you get that abroad
S0474	don't know oh probably not should i try i've get etp on there
S0456	i've get i've get i never try myself no
S0474	could be easy
S0456	don't you have to connect first
S0474	dad roam be off
S0456	connect er okay same as you so connection be this one i guess connectivity mobile data cos i be think
S0474	yeah
S0456	whether i should not swap sims because i will have all this mobile data with that one
S0474	yeah
S0456	but not with giffgaff so i have it anyway it doesn't really matter that i haven't get wi fi but mobile data just take more battery and stuff okay so let's see
S0474	oh
S0456	i've get mobile data
S0474	well the irony be it's you that need the dual sim and i've get the phone
S0456	data roaming's off ah hang on create a secure connection but i think it be on roam so
S0474	oh
S0456	maybe not a good idea
S0474	yeah i would red that's not red any more it use to be red and green didn't it
S0456	yeah
S0474	yeah my mum she be on my phone once and she say how'd you get back she forget you know the red and the green
S0456	mm
S0474	cos you don't have that any more you just have one single button on an iphone don't you really one touch button
S0456	do what
S0474	just a circle so you can't you don't have
S0456	yeah but for what
S0474	a green and a red any more you know that to rely on
S0456	oh yeah but if you but if you have a but if you
S0474	green for go red for stop
S0456	but if you if you do a call then you have to
S0474	yeah but if you're stick on the screen somewhere with a touch one you've always get the option to get out of it by press the red
S0456	yeah
S0474	if you do it as a smart
S0456	yeah well with this one you have this one this one get you out
S0474	oh
S0456	and if nothing else help you go for the er power button
S0474	should i leave the the screen still stick
S0456	mm mine be on it erm i leave mine on until they literally fall off and yours say lock your
S0474	i wonder if this will be rare soon because i we didn't see any more do we they seem to update it
S0456	yeah
S0474	i think because it i read a review somewhere and it say it's get the internet but it's in no way a smart phone it's a feature phone and it's try too hard to be a smart phone by have the apps
S0456	oh
S0474	i guess like this one as well
S0456	yeah like like this one this one
S0474	yeah
S0456	yep cos there this be the funniest bite this one have even the screen be but it be so the screen be bigger it's flatter but otherwise the functionality seem to be exactly the same
S0474	yeah
S0456	apart from my hot key directly to the internet but yeah yeah i definitely have only one sim as you can see in the description i have one sim like that and one from the side and the bite from the side be empty
S0474	oh well this phone come as both
S0456	yeah
S0474	the one in the uk i think only they only market it as a single sim maybe that's why we couldn't find it and it be this one look for
S0456	unless it be a slightly different number
S0474	yeah
S0456	you want to send me a text to sort of you know it's
S0474	yeah i'll have to take those noise off it as well
S0456	mm oh can you send me a text to the erm finnish one

S0456	you do find it eventually
S0474	how do you get contact up again yeah but i don't think it be in ah i can't see what the number be
