S0589	and you should also campaign to have the tree cut down in front of it
S0588	yeah well that's another thing one thing at a time but the thing be there's erm there's so so many politics involve in it and it get it's be list but they're go through bulldoze through with it anyway bulldoze be the apt word er so ignore what people think

S0588	er
S0589	i mean if that be the footprint only that bite be the library

S0588	and that's why
S0589	can we
S0588	and also there be this idea to have a hub in one of the build that they're intend to demolish no not demolish to sell off to pay for this idea erm and they reject that but they've include it in this in their plan the glass build they've include it in the plan as a café

S0589	well we'll see dear
S0588	you know they're call it the way they're spin it eleven million pound sound tempt doesn't it
S0589	yeah cos a fraction of that just to improve the current build wouldn't it
S0588	exactly but
S0589	and then spend millions to rebrand to
S0588	mm
S0589	and a shitload on their propaganda paper on the other hand if everyone on who do tend to be quite moany people
S0589	that's true
S0588	like to moan about council and they all sign there's about three thousand members of
S0589	post a comment like it's another sign of gentrification
S0588	yes exactly yeah you need to sort of i mean i be try to word it in a simplify way but you could potentially try to attract those type of people who hate anything to do with gentrification but it's not it's just gonna make it more naff really
S0589	and they'll pull down the back of the build
S0588	yeah
S0589	do you want to pop into the shop on the way home

S0589	i know
S0588	oh i see what do they say in your then
S0589	erm i do a higher than average amount of work so than the average do by everyone else i make five errors per thousand
S0588	oh that's alright
S0589	which be below the department average erm but the overall work i do be slightly below the department average but that's explain by the fact that i'm not train on every aspect so so that explain that erm
S0588	you should tell your mum she'll be very proud
S0589	yes she will be altogether happy with me but the figure be sort of make up from i haven't be there for a year so
S0588	yeah you have to do a sort of pro rata
S0589	yeah but when i have my six months so like in summer your sort of six month review they'll then it'll be accurate figure cos i would have be there for a year so that will be more tell one way or the other
S0588	mm mm be that good be it
S0589	i'm enjoy it dear
S0588	mm
S0589	ginger will be good for me what do you have for supper last night
S0588	actually i have the
S0589	the pasta
S0588	macaroni cheese yeah and then because you'd bring them in the house i have to have a caramel
S0589	a caramel have you eat them all
S0588	no
S0589	do you eat all the cheddars
S0588	i eat one packet of cheddars if you bring them in the house do you sleep alright last night
S0589	eventually tomorrow i've get rugby the rugby to watch darling
S0588	oh that's good
S0589	five o'clock
S0588	uhu i like all this onion
S0589	yeah it's good it's much better than the other iterations of of their king prawn dish
S0588	yeah oh great big chunk of ginger there oh the be absolutely heave when i go past
S0589	be it
S0588	yeah
S0589	that's a good sign
S0588	mm i don't know if there's a party go on in there or something
S0589	haven't be there for a while
S0588	no
S0589	why didn't you want to meet there
S0588	cos i think it would be a bite noisy it's a very noisy pub
S0589	that be perspicacious of you
S0588	that be what what what's the word
S0589	er perspicacious
S0588	what do that mean
S0589	foresight good foresight
S0588	how come you remember all these long word
S0589	just come across them a lot
S0588	what in crosswords be that mainly it
S0589	i think so
S0588	but then how do your brain retain them
S0589	i get use to them dear
S0588	my brain's like a sieve
S0589	well so be mine
S0588	no it's not cos you can draw on word when you need them i have to find them i think crosswords be very good though
S0589	uhu
S0588	but i be notice when i do brain train and the memory game i can only do them if i use word so if it's remember an order as in symbols or shape i have to say the name of each and then i can remember them i can remember a sequence of name but i can't remember it just by look so i have to sort of go blue green green blue yellow and then i'll remember the sequence
S0589	it's a mnemonic
S0588	it be a form of a mnemonic well it be a mnemonic but it's and so i can only remember things with mnemonics or in mnemonic form and yet i mean for example if you're trace erm you have to follow the route of the robot and remember it but if i count the number of square it's go down you could do it almost mathematically and then you'd remember but just visually
S0589	but people have different
S0588	it's really hard to do different
S0589	skills and ways
S0588	skills and ways of remember but
S0589	like proust and smell of his madeleine cake
S0588	what do that mean
S0589	it's the smell that or that he remember
S0588	but that's more of an emotional memory
S0589	darling why don't you have that last prawn or the last bite of erm
S0588	i'm go to have the last prawn and then i'm full
S0589	shall i have that bite of
S0588	yeah
S0589	it's actually a double bite
S0588	but i think when you get past a point in music and read music past a certain point you're you're not have to do anything mnemonically cos musical note be first of all a mnemonic poem
S0589	you just read it
S0588	yeah you go every good boy deserve fruit that's how you're teach to remember it e b e g b d
S0589	yeah
S0588	f so there's a point where you don't need that anymore and there's a point where you just glance and your hand would go to the right place which of course
S0588	as soon as you start do things by feel it make a lot more sense like touch type
S0589	thank you dear do quite well there didn't we
S0588	i think i might start up my piano lessons again
S0589	you say dear
