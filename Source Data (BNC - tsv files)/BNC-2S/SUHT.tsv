S0262	it be like eighteen dollars
S0261	pretty bonkers wasn't it
S0262	yeah it be it be bonkers
S0261	and they just pitch themselves as a certain type of outfit didn't they
S0262	english british and it can't really cost that much to import those kind of ciders surely into the into australia it's just that's right that's the mark up cos there aren't as people do it it can't can't cost that much
S0261	well it doesn't cost that much they're just make a good kind of triple profit on it
S0262	yeah
S0261	don't forget they've get to pay more tax in australia for alcohol too
S0262	yeah well i don't miss that so anyway i think that it's be quite a journey
S0261	come up here today
S0261	it be a lot quicker than i think it would be
S0262	i be think more about the journey we've be on for the past nine months
S0261	nine months
S0262	yeah
S0261	oh be that your number do you grab a number
S0262	be that the beef and the lamb
S0262	oh that's ours thank
S0262	lamb shank be it yep brilliant thank you
S0261	and beef fantastic cheer mate
S0262	great thank you
S0261	brilliant
S0262	that be fast
S0261	erm
S0262	wow
S0261	a haggisy type thing
S0262	mm lamb shank i haven't have a lamb shank in years
S0262	great thank you
S0261	oh brilliant thank you yeah i kind of didn't erm expect to be here to tell you the truth
S0262	oh mm why's that
S0261	well i've only be up here a couple of time before and i kind of figure it be because it be struggle to come up this way
S0262	mm mm mm i know what you mean
S0261	and oh look at this it's like a big old truck
S0262	mm mm
S0261	a sightsee tour so i've felt that they've just kind of come down here so they can check us out while we have a fee
S0262	that's quite cute
S0261	mm
S0262	mm
S0261	it's a lot more a thing to go
S0262	mm i think so i think once you kind of get away from the shop malls and that sort of thing mm i think it's i think it's an alright place i mean there's a lot more go on than meet the eye
S0261	well what meet the eye be pretty good anyway
S0262	mm mm and i think in a way it's quite it's quite cute because i think the students here by and large sort of make a bite more of of of contribute to the sort of the scene
S0261	mm
S0262	where as in if you get to university you be you're keep you you know you sort of keep yourself to yourself erm and the things like and whatnot be more for inside the university's entertainment
S0261	do you think so
S0262	mm i think so i mean have you ever be along to a production in
S0261	no
S0262	no and that's a bite weird isn't it consider how long we live there
S0261	in the past
S0262	mm
S0261	what's weird about it be just that it's not the kind of stuff that you want to go and see or
S0262	erm perhaps it's perhaps it be perhaps it's not but when i think of i actually i don't get excite about the cultural the cultural elements to it and maybe i need to see it through a fresh pair of eye
S0261	well what's your picture of the erm of what happen at
S0262	i mean to be fair i don't i you know i don't know apart from the fact that you know the name be famous
S0261	mm it carry a lot of history of a lot of kind of famous actors and presenters
S0262	mm
S0261	right
S0262	and it find people and find talent it's good at nurture talent
S0261	yeah
S0262	so all i'm say be that maybe i should go along one day to actually have a look and judge for myself
S0261	mm mm
S0262	but i think what i'm say be that i've probably never really try to engage with quite on a sort of cultural level that maybe some other people choose to and that that's my own fault
S0261	mm mm
S0262	so you know erm and it sort of annoy me in a way because there be there be obviously quite a lot go on
S0261	that be random how do they do that
S0262	mm
S0261	that's pretty cool
S0262	and i think there be some you know there's some good stuff like that you know erm festival ideas and some of those things be free and i think we should tap into it
S0261	mm
S0262	what do you think
S0261	well it depend on whether there's anything worthwhile on
S0262	yeah
S0261	that that actually when i say worthwhile that go beyond look at a lot ofstuff's just steep in history and connect to us do you know
S0262	mm mm
S0261	what's erm
S0262	you you mean the academic side be very to the fore here
S0261	what what's new what's
S0262	i mean in
S0261	well i'm simply look at like that kind of outfit
S0262	yeah
S0261	for the erm
S0262	that that's a very specific clientele i'd say
S0261	yeah but i mean
S0262	it's quite music focus
S0261	and but pretty much most of it be kind of deal with go and have a look at the history of this history of thatand the history of this
S0262	i think that's how they get the fund
S0261	you know but it mean that it's support some of the old stuff and give it a face and a name and a bring it to an audience and so on and so on
S0262	mm mm
S0261	which be fine but i think i'm more interest in a cultural connection which be more about the people that be around today
S0262	mm
S0261	it's kind of like you could be stand in a crowd of people talk about history of and yet not know anything about anybody around you
S0262	yeah
S0261	and so what's the point in it
S0262	yeah yeah i mean i've always find to be very sometimes i think to me it just lack a heart it lack a soul it it lack a centre it lack a place where everyone go to hang out and i think maybe that be in the summer or the or whatever you know in the summer and i remember be sixteen or fifteen but i'm i'm not fifteen and sixteen anymore you know i need somewhere else to go to feel that sense of heart city and i struggle to find it
S0261	well they have those kind of events like in summer like the they have the beer festivals and the that kind of stuff you know
S0262	mm mm i mean
S0261	some of them be family orient some of them aren'tyou know
S0262	i mean more regular feel rather than once a year i mean of course they have folk festival and all that which be very you know prestigious but i mean when you go into the city you make a beeline for somewhere and go oh i'm gonna go and see what's go on you know and have a sort of a race heart oh i wonder what excite things be happen
S0262	well maybe it's a part of
S0262	and some cities have that
S0261	yeah maybe it's part of the culture that you know what people be do be mooch around and shop
S0262	yeah shop mm mm
S0261	or that these kind of erm gather and events be they be like i say they're kind of the type of things or
S0262	mm
S0261	erm like the film in
S0262	yeah i don't decry that i'm talk more about something all year round something that be more of a place of an open it's not necessarily an event it's like go to the
S0261	yeah
S0262	i miss place like that where people congregate because they need to they want to feel something from each other not just shop
S0261	mm so so give me an example of a place anywhere that you've be thatkind of pull that together
S0262	well you know
S0261	so you're talk about right
S0262	well you just say give me an example so i'm give you one
S0261	mm erm so i mean they're hubs because they're transport hubs you know and
S0262	true yeah but they're also cultural hubs
S0261	yeah so they've shank to some kind of cultural connection around those hubs
S0262	mm
S0261	the
S0262	mm
S0261	you've get erm some of that kind of i suppose bar you've get a square that's on the other side of of the quay
S0262	mm
S0261	but it's not actually in town but it's on harbour side right so they've wrap that around a feature
S0262	mm
S0261	erm so what kind of feature in would they wrap that kind of thing around erm you've kind of get like the river you've get the square you've get the colleges yeah erm but the thing be be that ironically the the colleges you have some kind of split so
S0262	mm they do split the flow up quite a lotin the city
S0261	but also they split split the culture and the society
S0262	mm
S0261	so although kind of the tourism be center around some of the colleges the fact be be that they're they're not actually align yeah
S0262	not really i don't feel they be
S0261	no
S0262	i mean i've show people around cos they're tourists and i'm mean to show them around and i've struggle to make it seem coherent
S0261	mm so part of that be space
S0262	mm
S0261	and and and and layout
S0262	mm mm
S0261	and location
S0262	mm
S0261	erm and part of it be culture
S0262	yeah
S0261	different culture live together in the same place
S0262	mm mm
S0261	look for different things erm
S0262	see if you have to choose between say live in somewhere like no if you have to choose between no well yeah let's start with that one how would you feel about you know live in a place that like this that's it's get a history but it's more provincial whereas be very much on the map
S0261	well it depend on what you're look for alright erm if you be here i mean as it present itself it kind of feel like an interest place
S0262	mm
S0261	but i've not live here so i can't really kind of make a judgment
S0262	no that's true
S0261	in that way erm you know you can look at things on the surface but they may well be different when you're experience them over a long time
S0262	mm
S0261	erm and that it be off the beat track
S0262	mm
S0261	so if you want to be connect i don't know you know we're use to be somewhere like a place like or or whatever or where you can get to an airport easily and that airport can take you to place that you wanna go
S0262	mm
S0261	you know
S0262	mm
S0261	so if it mean that you know i'm sure you can fly certain place in europe from but
S0262	i know what you're say i i know
S0261	it's not hub base so
S0262	yeah yeah i mean like if your business depend on fly frequently you would want to be nearer to a well accessible to an airport like because 's bloody brilliant in most respect
S0261	yeah because it give you access to a lot of europe pretty easily
S0262	mm
S0261	be in be good for the same reason that it doesn't have to be the northern airport of it can be any of them
S0262	mm mm
S0261	and on a good day if you want to get to airport you can get there in under and hour
S0262	mm yeah that's true
S0261	so for some people that would be like live in and try to travel across to get to these place
S0262	mm mm
S0261	and you you don't you live outside of it and you're connect differently so the point be how do it fit together with the way you feel connect with the location the place the culture so on and so on your particular need or whatever you know
S0262	mm
S0261	erm if your need be you've get to be able to go to an airport once a month they're not gonna want to have to go from here to as an example
S0262	mm and conversely if you don't need to be somewhere go somewhere once once a month the payoff be something you might contemplate
S0261	well maybe yeah
S0262	yeah i mean if you only know you be fly two or three time a year from that's why you wouldn't you know you wouldn't mark it out as oh i have to live live near
S0261	i don't know how long it take erm well you i suppose you just bomb it down the
S0262	on the train
S0261	if you're gonna go to coach
S0262	yeah it's a coach
S0261	mm but i imagine that journey be between an hour and an hour and a half
S0262	i agree if you be a businessman and you have to fly nearly every week or every other week from you would live in but if you didn't actually have to fly every week or every month from erm you could contemplate live a little bite further further afield
S0261	maybe
S0262	cos your need wouldn't be the same and also some people you know do have to fly from but they choose not to live near an airport so it's all depend on you know i don't think your life be completely dictate by transport it do have an it do have an impact but some people choose not to make it a big deal and others do yeah it just depend on your personality i guess you know if you like have ease of access to transport then you're gonna place yourself near a station where you can get to place
S0261	yeah uh huh
S0262	erm but train travel's very expensive in this country so it's kind of not my choice of er of transport at the moment
S0261	well
S0262	if i can help it
S0261	versus what other er options
S0262	well there's bus and coach and your own transport
S0261	yeah so relative to time it depend on how you want to where you want to go park time how long it take versus cost and so you take the train because it get you quite often close to where you need to be
S0262	yeah i agree but it's still if you haven't get the money in your pocket you're go to have to find another way of transport yourself you know if people go i haven't get fifty quid to spend to go to london for the day day go back and forth or thirty five or whatever it be you really do have no other option but look at other transport systems like get a coach you can get a coach into for six pound fifty from for a single
S0261	and the journey take probably two two and a half hours
S0262	yeah
S0261	versus forty five minutes
S0262	yeah it do mean that you have to spend
S0261	so
S0262	more time travel
S0261	so if you value your time and you say your time be worth fifty quid an hour
S0262	i know i'm just say if you didn't have money in your pocket i find a lot of people don't necessarily have money in their pocket to spend on on train
S0261	oh yeah be that right
S0262	yeah well if you be like yeah if you didn't have that much money you wouldn't be go on expensive train journey
S0261	be there something wrong with that bite
S0262	no i just couldn't fit it all in i'm full
S0261	can i can i have it
S0262	yeah course you can and also if you be erm not rush about to get into you have a choice which be do i take the cheaper option and give myself forty pound to play with while i'm in but take a longer time to get there but i don't have to be there for a specific time i'm just go in to see friends or you know i'm go to do some kind of show or exhibition or whatever it be that you're look for you might take the cheaper option just because it give you more spend money while you're in erm so that's another thing i'm say as well but anyway it really start off not really necessarily about transport it be more about how have never really excite me i just still kind of can't really put my finger on why why it doesn't why it doesn't feel like it's an excite place to be
S0261	well i've always pin that down to the fact that the bloody place be flat
S0262	mm true
S0261	right grow up in a place which have hill and mountains and bush to walk in and have none of that really
S0262	mm
S0261	so that's why i've never find it attractive like i never find a place like attractive
S0262	mm
S0261	because the bloody place be flat you know so
S0262	hello yes that's great thank you very much that be lovely
S0261	yeah it be really nice thank you
S0262	it be it's great yeah
S0261	yeah it's nice and warm
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah erm and that's what we be say before we come over here from australia that we be gonna look at place which carry the right environment a place that felt good to be in and i think for me that's where that connection be the connection be with the environment around you and then you look at the other things that relate to that yeah
S0262	mm mm
S0261	you imagine be in a place like as nice as it be just imagine if it didn't have a harbour and didn't have beach
S0262	mm
S0261	what kind of different place it might be
S0262	mm yeah
S0261	you know erm or that if you live in but you have to live out of the flat plain and in amongst suburbia so you be still thirty forty fifty kilometres away from the centre of the city be not out there it's a different place you know
S0262	too right it be yeah
S0261	so that's kind of like live in or in
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm so when you go to place other place in europe i mean feel more like a european place because it's get some of kind of older heritage to it and stuff like that and and you feel that it's it's kind of there erm and be a bite kind of bits and piece about all that yeah not as coherent so not not feel like that it doesn't feel like it it have that kind of heart it doesn't have a very strong central heart i think that's just my feel
S0262	no that's exactly what i be say twenty minutes ago
S0261	mm mm so erm if you then take the environmental side of it a place with hill a place with some kind of water it's what we talk about you know a place that isn't necessarily a big city could be a big city or maybe not but certainly it's get kind of a central heart to it
S0262	yeah where the people be friendly
S0261	a place where people want to be
S0262	i think that make a big difference to me
S0261	mm yeah
S0262	i could probably forego the the whole mountains and thing erm if i felt that there be a a central hub of erm people who enjoy live in the city clearly be very proud of it want to make it something interest and fun for people and have a friendly attitude i think that would be you know a much nicer place a much nicer experience
S0261	mm mm
S0262	because most of the time if you're work or whatever you be interact with people
S0261	yes
S0262	and i think yeah i think you can get out into the countryside erm unless you live out in rural countryside where you probably want to get away from people erm be in the be in the heart of something in a city must be excite because there's just so much go on so many different type of people to interact with
S0261	mm mm
S0262	so for me it's kind of like well if we can't live somewhere straightaway that's gonna be mountains and the lakes and the you know the things that we say would be important for us erm where else can we have as a stop gap which be you know interest different but not and not cost like the earth you know to to make happen see i don't mind have you know as a base it doesn't bother me to have it as a base but it it it still it need to be temporary
S0261	of course it be temporary
S0262	so i need i need either a reason to pull away from it and say oh you know sorry we're not live there anymore because something's happen and we both need to go and live somewhere else which give us an impetus to actually go up go go go away from and get off our arses and go off and do something else
S0261	yeah of course yeah that's always the way that i've be think
S0262	yeah the reality be though be that we have to turn it into an implementation plan
S0261	yes that's right
S0262	and we've kind of stall on that side so i'm still clock it up in my head go well how do we implement this how do we make it happen give what we know give our circumstances give our limitations what we have at the moment that we're really try to just get by on various things
