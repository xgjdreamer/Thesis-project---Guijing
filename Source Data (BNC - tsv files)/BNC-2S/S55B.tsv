S0427	yeah
S0426	it's just
S0427	yeah
S0426	horrendously difficult but there's five strand to this project and it's pretty obvious to everybody that they're all very different they do different things and they may or may not cohere together but you know each strand will probably
S0427	mm
S0426	be good enough in its own right to produce stuff and that's what the want
S0427	well you see a few years ago i be involve a project like this
S0426	ah
S0427	which be suppose to be about good governance and the criminal justice system and it be coordinate by a chap from er london who be also a fellow at in and erm i'm not say that there weren't some valuable piece do with each individual study but the whole thing fell apart as a farce because one of the study be railway timetables in the victorian era whereas
S0427	i be do one on on crime figure
S0426	do
S0427	you know
S0426	it it it surely there must be you're tease me no it be really that

S0426	yeah
S0427	apples pears
S0426	apple pears
S0427	yeah
S0426	well the the fund body must have go in with its eye open i mean they would have if they didn't like that element of it you know that that obviously
S0427	mm
S0426	out with the the general pattern the social science element they'd have say cut this bite or we won't give you the money
S0427	mm
S0426	the other thing be you
S0427	instead sorry
S0426	you they mutate don't they once you get the money people do slightly different things
S0427	yeah
S0426	you know
S0427	be there anything likely to be in for a discourse
S0426	that's what i'm hop for the
S0427	mm
S0426	one of them the strand be about the kind of thing i've be do
S0427	yeah
S0426	on intellectual stability
S0427	well that would be very good wouldn't it
S0426	it would
S0427	and very prestigious
S0426	mm

S0427	biscuit
S0426	it would have to be a biscuit in tea it couldn't be something like this in tea
S0427	no i mean my
S0426	cos it would just fall apart

S0427	and there they be with their
S0426	yeah

S0427	i oh well i i'm not er i'm not a dunker of croissants or i'm not with them on that score and the cup be so big it's
S0426	yeah yeah
S0427	far too much effort

S0426	that's right to go to the other extreme i be in a
S0427	mm
S0426	a place in the other day which i think you'd get a decent cup of coffee here it be
S0427	yeah
S0426	it's er kind of an arty place
S0427	oh yeah yeah yeah
S0426	so i think i'll just ask a young lady and er can you espresso she say oh yes no problem er okay well i think actually i think i'll have a macchiato blank look
S0427	completely blank face be it
S0426	completely blank look but obviously you know keen to help er i i'm certainly i'm sure we can do that just remind me what it be again i say well i i but i choose my word not very carefully i say
S0427	uhu
S0426	well it's basically an espressowith a drop of milk in it
S0427	uhu
S0426	ah now that
S0427	right
S0426	be that's true up to a point
S0427	yeah it be up to point yes
S0426	up to a point
S0427	yeah
S0426	and what do you think i get
S0427	a milky lukewarm coffee
S0426	espresso
S0427	yeah
S0426	with milk in it and
S0427	yeah and stir in
S0426	and stir in
S0427	yes exactly yeah
S0426	yes that's right
S0427	mm not quite what you have in mind
S0426	no er but then i it when she say er i mean it and give it to me and i look at it and basically it's beige liquid you know
S0427	yeah
S0426	and it fill the cup and she say be it alright i should have you know do some an education on it some education on it and she say be that alright cos i really want to learn and i say yes it's fine
S0427	mm oh well that be that be nice of you er that be nice of you
S0426	but that mean that
S0427	yeah
S0426	you know
S0427	you you you
S0426	every that's
S0427	that's what you'll get every time
S0426	every time
S0427	unless you go in and say you know what actually i mislead you there
S0426	mm
S0427	er and macchiato be like a mini cappuccino
S0426	yeah yeah right exactly
S0427	you know
S0426	of course that may lead into all other kinds of areas
S0427	er or that that assume she know what a cappuccino be
S0426	yeah
S0427	yeah that's just as the italians say which be what you just have dirty water
S0426	yes dirty water
S0427	which be which be their slang word for an american coffee though they don't say that
S0426	okay no no that's right
S0427	to the americans who order it
S0426	that's right
S0427	yeah
S0426	if you ask for an americano you just get a
S0427	you get the equivalent of
S0426	a very liquid a very dilute
S0427	a long sort of coffee drink
S0426	yeah
S0427	and they they pour milk into it
S0426	and that's
S0427	you know that's
S0426	hold in some contempt be it
S0427	that that's the one they mm often call dirty water
S0426	but you wouldn't ask for you'd ask for an americano
S0427	well er no i mean as a joke
S0426	right yeah
S0427	you know i mean
S0426	okay
S0427	i think it's well understand that this be what the tourists
S0426	right
S0427	not not necessarily the americans
S0426	no no that's right
S0427	but this what tourists want
S0426	that's right yes
S0427	but but an but an americano be be on the menu in a bar
S0426	it's on the menu
S0427	for tourists
S0426	that's right
S0427	it would be like i can't i i can't believe that many italians would drink an americano cos it
S0427	it be a bite like erm you know you you may as well get erm instant coffee pour boil water on it
S0426	yes
S0427	and pour the milk in
S0426	yeah i mean
S0427	cos that that's that's
S0426	that's right that's right
S0427	essentially all it be
S0426	i i can't remember in whether in spain there's an equivalent of an americano as such
S0427	oh right i don't know i don't know enough about spain
S0426	i i think you'd have to ask for
S0427	well
S0426	i don't even know they'd have one
S0427	what i've hear in in some place on the continent be british people say can i just have an ordinary coffee
S0426	yes that's right
S0427	hear that
S0426	an ordinary coffee
S0427	and they're not it
S0426	no no no no
S0427	you know and it's a
S0426	can i just have an ordinary coffee
S0427	i i know i know exactly what they mean
S0426	that's right
S0427	you know just an ordinary coffee you know
S0426	that's right exactly
S0427	but but it
S0427	may not be know on the continent what an ordinary coffee be
S0426	exactly i mean their notion of ordinary
S0426	you know surely be as respectable a notion as our
S0426	but okay yeah
S0427	i think that's a classic just an ordinary one
S0426	i think what you should have be an italian go into a bar in britain and say can i just have an ordinary coffee and
S0426	and show amazement at be give in fact an ordinary coffee
S0427	oh god well er i mean i suppose you you you learn from your travel don't you
S0426	well coffee we've say this to each other before coffee have get better
S0427	oh yeah definitely i mean i agree with you entirely erm and i mean if you go into some of the big chain er it's ridiculous some of the variations that they offer and then
S0426	yeah
S0427	they they don't want to use term like small medium and large do they
S0426	no no they're in it
S0427	i don't know what they be be it tall or
S0426	that be ludicrous
S0427	whatever it be
S0426	that's right
S0427	yeah
S0427	yeah you know yeah
S0427	yes exactly
S0426	and i think that's for god's sake yeah that's right
S0427	it's all seem a bite pretentious to me
S0426	that's right i bet the
S0427	which again you don't see say
S0426	no
S0427	in italy or i imagine you wouldn't see it in er
S0426	well that's another question
S0427	spain
S0426	do they offer you different size
S0427	you can have something like erm an espresso grande i think but er that's just or a
S0426	yeah
S0427	but that's just two of them
S0426	sure
S0427	you have to ask for that
S0426	right
S0427	i don't think you often see it write up on
S0426	no that there be different
S0427	on the wall
S0426	size to be have
S0427	no
S0426	that's a very anglo american type of thing isn't it
S0427	uhu
S0426	i mean
S0427	and you don't see too many coffees to go either because the er the assumption be that if you be in a hurry you you will have it in a nice bite of cutlery but at the bar and you'll knock it down and say thank you very much pay your bill and out and out you walk
S0426	well yeah that's right that's right that's right
S0427	yeah
S0426	but here routinely you're ask if it's for an espresso be that single or double sir
S0427	yes or or to go or drink in or do you want anything with that or
S0426	that's right always yes
S0427	but i think coffee drink here be something when you look at some coffee shop i mean that have open up in bookstores or
S0426	yeah yeah
S0427	there there be material to read
S0426	well yeah
S0427	and you talk about wi fi
S0426	yeah oh yeah
S0427	and all have their coffees with it
S0426	yeah yeah yeah
S0427	coffee in britain be more than it be for a lot of italians i'm not say italians don't go into a bar
S0426	mm
S0427	or or or a kind of a mini place and and linger but equally you see a lot of people go in the espressois knock back
S0426	yeah that's right
S0427	and they go
S0426	that's right even if they're
S0427	yes
S0426	they'll they'll order together or
S0427	mm
S0426	one of will order
S0427	mm
S0426	they'll stand at the bar
S0427	yeah
S0426	they'll drink it and then they go off again
S0427	and you've get very experience baristas
S0426	yes
S0427	who can knock these things out very quickly
S0426	that's right that's right that's right
S0427	they're not fiddle with the dial or
S0426	that's right
S0427	or anything like that
S0426	that's right that's right
S0427	they know where everything be
S0426	that's right
S0427	they've get er they've get two what i don't know
S0426	that's right
S0427	nozzles be that's not the word for it
S0426	yeah yeah yeah
S0427	but then they've get two or more nozzles work and they knock these things out
S0426	true true
S0427	quite quickly
S0426	that's what you could have in your new kitchen if you go down that
S0427	oh
S0426	a gaggia machine take up the entire half of the wall
S0427	yeah you mean add about four thousand pound to the cost of my kitchen
S0426	er but think of the prestige you know
S0427	mm and think of how many people would be knock at my door
S0427	i just happen to be pass
S0426	that's it pass by
S0427	but it's a cul de sac for god's sake
S0427	oh really can i smell the coffee
S0426	oh do i smell coffee in the air yeah
S0427	it's a shame
S0427	you retire but still we know you're in most days
S0426	yes that's right well you could just hang up a little sign outside
S0427	yeah you could really
S0426	say you know
S0427	yes but i'm i i think some of them would be cheeky enough to be say but i think you'd like it if you buy the students round for a seminar
S0426	yes that's
S0427	in your live room
S0426	yes in your room i've bring
S0427	you know
S0426	my own cup
S0427	yes exactly
S0426	it's like you know no wash up that's
S0427	keep your hand in you don't wanna completely retire
S0426	that's right
S0427	yes
S0426	but it apparently it turn out those things cos you can get them for the house
S0427	yeah
S0426	for you know
S0427	i know
S0426	for domestic be just appallingly temperamental
S0427	be they
S0426	and difficult apparently that's right
S0427	oh right
S0426	er they rely on
S0427	well i'm glad you've put me off
S0426	i
S0427	cos i be just rush out to get one well
S0426	cos you've get the water pressure issue apparently i don't know it's what they say but
S0427	oh really well the water pressure's not brilliant where i live they change the water supply recently and they send me a note not a note they send me a formal letter
S0426	mm
S0427	tell me of the official change of some reservoir to a new reservoir
S0426	oh right
S0427	and tell me that er no assure me
S0427	that the water be still good to drink and there shouldn't be any change in
S0427	taste but that i
S0426	well they
S0427	might find it quote
S0427	a little harder
S0426	oh right this be cos
S0427	which be not good news for your your
S0426	yeah that
S0427	wash machine
S0426	that's right machine
S0427	or dishwasher and so on
S0427	if it's get much harder
S0426	be well know to be
S0427	a hard area
S0426	you know a centre of water aficionados and cognoscenti cos they
S0427	right
S0426	turn on the tap and they say mm this be not the same reservoir
S0427	no
S0426	it's it's
S0427	and it's not yes and it's not from the north side i can tell by the
S0426	no it's the
S0427	temperature
S0426	south side exactly
S0427	this be the south side it's a
S0426	it's it get a lot more sun
S0427	it's a might too hot
S0426	that's right
S0427	yes i'd describe this tepid er well let the tap run for a little bite longer then
S0427	oh yes
S0426	well it's very good of them but i haven't have any such communication
S0427	well you obviously they haven't change your supplier well it's not it's not it's still water
S0426	right
S0427	but they be
S0426	right
S0427	you're
S0426	right right
S0427	get it from your your bog standard reservoir
S0426	that's right
S0427	you've always get it from
S0426	probably get it from the the
S0427	but you see people in
S0427	be more discern so they have to
S0427	change the reservoir where we get ours from
S0427	there's there's be there's be blind taste of the water
S0426	yes i think probably just the the incidents of dead dog er in your old reservoirs have reach the
S0427	add a certain
S0427	dare one say body
S0426	piquancy
S0426	body
S0427	yeah
S0426	that's right yeah
S0427	yeah well there we be
S0426	i shall look out for that i i shall see what er
S0427	well if i be you
S0426	they have to say
S0427	i would be write letter of complaint to
S0426	say that
S0427	say
S0426	well why have i get
S0427	why aren't i get a new reservoir
S0426	the old reservoir that's right i have a guy
S0427	mm
S0426	come round do the bathroom thing er and he be
S0427	yeah
S0426	look round the bathroom and he you know he be perfectly you know sensible and he say to me first question er do you have high pressurise water and i think oh god i i don't i have absolutely no idea
S0427	well i no i wouldn't know what what the definition of that be i mean it's gonna be it's either gonna cut the mustard or it's gonna
S0426	well it's just
S0427	you know i mean there be it's it's either highish or lowish or something but there there's no
S0426	mm
S0427	it's just like say have you get gas central heat no i haven't you've either get that or you haven't get it
S0426	or you haven't
S0427	but
S0426	that's right
S0427	pressure be a matter of degree when do it become high pressure
S0426	well maybe it also er it's one of those things that you just say you know
S0427	oh right
S0426	when you're
S0427	well what difference
S0426	enquire
S0427	would it make
S0426	well i suppose the i can't imagine
S0427	three thousand pound
S0426	anyway
S0427	as to
S0426	er it
S0427	what he be gonna put in
S0426	just i say
S0427	mm
S0426	well the tank's around here and he go and look at the tank he say
S0427	mm
S0426	oh yes yes you've get high pressure
S0427	mm
S0426	of course this could be an entirely make up question with a make up answer just to you know wrong foot the client
S0427	well i can just imagine someone say erm do do you want an engine in this you know
S0427	oh let me just check oh it's get an engine
S0426	that's right
S0427	yeah
S0426	but but
S0427	yeah
S0426	you can imagine it be semi veridical like you know
S0427	well yeah
S0426	er if the electrician ask you er be you on ac or dc here
S0427	well i'd know that be a kosher question
S0426	okay okay you'd know that
S0427	yeah yeah
S0426	be a kosher question
S0427	yeah actually i think if somebody ask me that i'd think well hang on if i'm not high pressure what's that gonna mean
S0426	yes
S0427	and i might be worry then if he say
S0426	that's right
S0427	oh well
S0426	oh well
S0427	you can't have this that and the other
S0426	that's right that's that's it
S0427	you'll have to have a bog standard shower
S0426	yeah that's right
S0427	rather than one that come at you from
S0426	that's all side
S0427	twenty two different angle and
S0426	that's right
S0427	you know and
S0426	yes
S0427	and a bidet will be no good at all
S0426	oh yes exactly
S0427	unless you've get high pressure you know
S0426	you get i get that's right
S0427	cos water have to go up that way
S0426	that's right
S0427	you know
S0426	but it
S0427	yeah
S0426	would probably be the other way round wouldn't it so ah well if you haven't get this it'll cost you a lot more
S0427	ah well
S0426	we or if
S0427	that's what i mean
S0426	you have get x it'll so whichever
S0427	then we have to tone it down
S0426	way you answer that's right yeah
S0427	we have to tone it down or it'll kill you
S0426	that's right yeah
S0427	you go in that shower you'll be dead
S0426	that's right
S0426	well i shall see how that plan pan out
S0427	well you must let know how this work out
S0426	i well
S0427	cos i've never know before i i've be ask about hard and soft water
S0426	ah okay right
S0427	but
S0426	right
S0427	i've never be ask or hear about high or low water
S0426	pressurise water
S0427	well no i don't know i i'd
S0426	it it i i may be
S0427	mm
S0426	do him a disservice here he may have say do you have a pressurise pressurise
S0427	oh
S0426	boiler do that
S0427	ah there be
S0426	make any more sense
S0427	there be such a thing as that yes erm that that's where i think it might be something to do with where you turn the tap on the hot water top the boiler come on instantly and heat the water
S0426	no it's not
S0427	he didn't mean that
S0426	no it didn't mean that
S0427	oh right okay well i give in
S0426	but that could only be a gas thing
S0427	erm well i don't know there be new there be tap now apparently that you can have by your sink
S0426	yeah
S0427	and they do hot water cold water or or boil water instantly now how they do that
S0426	that's just
S0427	must be some kind of special electricity thing they go through i don't know
S0426	okay if it's a hadron collider spin off
S0427	well i yes it could be yeah
S0426	this be probably how they get the science fund for it
S0427	you mean
S0426	it's get it's get
S0427	we make
S0426	impact you see
S0427	you mean your kitchen might might be the discovery post higgs boson
S0426	yes
S0427	kind of thing
S0426	exactly that's right i mean after a while
S0427	yeah yeah
S0426	the science foundation in the european union could fund such a thing
S0427	well
S0426	but if it didn't guarantee impact in the real world what's the point of it
S0427	well i i of all the most unlikely place where string theory would be verify
S0427	or negate i never think of it be you know your kitchen
S0426	but but think how many households often look for string in these time
S0427	and they can never find it
S0426	can never find
S0427	when they need it
S0426	yeah that's
S0427	no
S0426	why you want a hadron collider in the background
S0427	yeah well
S0426	it's gonna find your string for you
S0427	that's gonna cost more than nine or ten thousand pound though i suggest
S0427	it could take more than a week or two
S0426	yeah
S0427	to put in
S0426	that's
S0426	yes and it could involve a certain
S0426	amount of dig the road out
S0427	mm
S0426	underneath
S0427	or that would that won't be a discomfort for you because
S0426	oh no
S0427	because you would be at the centre of it
S0426	in the centre of it
S0427	i assume it'll be
S0426	it's
S0427	bite of a problem even worse than the tram
S0426	all your that's right
S0427	be in at the moment
S0426	that's right
S0427	i think it'll be a bite deeper and longer than that
S0427	yes that's right
S0426	well we shall see about that but yours
S0427	well
S0426	would probably come first if it's if it's september
S0427	yes and i can i can erm er report back on high water
S0426	well it
S0427	low water pressure and goodness know what else
S0426	it may well be that if i
S0427	if it's er yeah
S0426	still haven't get something do i shall approach you again
S0427	oh well you can by all mean
S0426	and if you find out if you
S0427	come around and have a look at it and see what you think and you know whether it's worth it and all the rest of it cos i'll er it'll all be do and dust by then should should be finish by the erm
S0426	start of term
S0427	end of end of the first week in september
S0426	brilliant yeah
S0427	okay see you later on
S0426	okay cheer matey
S0427	thank you for the coffee
S0426	my pleasure
S0427	cheer mate
