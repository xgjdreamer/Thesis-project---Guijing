S0281	oh that's for yeah
S0015	from
S0281	yeah do do do do do do ba ba ba ah ah ah so
S0015	i think would be back by now
S0281	yeah
S0015	right i'll take this for
S0281	mm
S0015	round to her house i suppose
S0281	would have be handy have a printer as well
S0015	huh
S0281	handy have a printer
S0015	yeah but she can't use a computer very well she's not good erm so she so she can understand but she's not very business orientate
S0281	mm
S0015	she come home separate
S0281	tell me er last email he say they sell their house in er where they be in in
S0015	where in china
S0281	within the hour
S0281	yeah
S0015	ah be it a nice house then he's get there they buy it over there
S0281	not particularly yeah
S0015	oh
S0281	amaze so seem to be undervalue if they sell it so quickly
S0015	within an hour mm thing that's no good good don't want that
S0281	mm
S0015	this be i tell you this estate agent leave the doors unlock and open
S0281	oh
S0015	they offer her three hundred pound erm compensation although i think to be honest the amount they charge
S0281	what be the compensation for because nothing actually be steal be it and nobody break in
S0015	well break their code of conduct they be tell they've get to keep it secure
S0281	oh
S0015	take something from her premise a key
S0281	oh really
S0015	yeah they take the key away the key be on a er on a dresser on the top of a clock
S0281	mm
S0015	and he'd get the same key get the key for the back door but he pick up another one go out leave the door right open and leave the house with a key when she get back she couldn't go out
S0281	what be he think of
S0015	well exactly you know just a nutcase they they shouldn't employ people like that really so erm but you know say he's sorry
S0281	oh sorry i forget to dry
S0015	reluctantly no it's alright he say sorry reluctantly but i think what get they're they're extortionately expensive this estate agent erm you know something like four thousand pound they charge to sell the house and i she's now ask for a reduction in the in the their charge
S0281	mm
S0015	they've not be very good bloody useless they've get the most awful reputation and she'd know if she use her computer before she could've go online and see their review about them
S0281	yeah
S0015	and it's just awful but this be where you're also much more vulnerable when you don't you know you can't have you can't access things like that but the thing be they've get a buyer for this house but she hasn't find another house that she want so they haven't send her any
S0281	mm
S0015	so
S0281	so presumably she's get a contract with these people
S0015	yeah she have get a contract with them and it's a terrible contract it say
S0281	well can't can't she get out if it by say you've break the term of your contract
S0015	yeah they they say yes you can get out of it but if she then say say for instance these people be hang on want her house what they've say they've say if those people then have register with other estate agents which be what you'll all do you go to load of them and put your name down and you get you know house from them if they come to her and sell you would have to pay their fee and the new estate agents it would be eight thousand
S0281	huh
S0015	well and if they come privately up to two years later
S0281	be you joke
S0015	yeah oh it's just the use car that's this here it's just notorious they're not very professional as you can tell they don't answer phone call they don't get back to you she's have to i i don't think they're gonna get anywhere and i think but i think they will need to go to the ombudsman er almost as a way of register their erm negligence so it's probably won't get very far because they three hundred quid and she's turn it down she hasn't you know three hundred quid for the inconvenience and the anxiety cos she come back and think she'd be burgle
S0281	yeah
S0015	and she think there be someone in there so you know you get her scar then she couldn't go out because she hadn't get a key to lock the back door
S0015	no it's just and then you you know we've go off with this finally the spare key and his set of key and erm she phone the office oh he'll be back you know he must be can't be far away and it be er well over an hour or so before he come back he could've cut key in that time
S0281	mm
S0015	so or do he give be do he erm you know allow the other the the viewers to pick things up and touch things and do he go and have to go and get the key off these people who know nobody know you know will they turn up and burgle her some other time
S0281	mm
S0015	so it's you know it's not
S0281	have i get a couple of shirt
S0015	yeah a grey one
S0281	yeah
S0015	be there another one
