S0486	no
S0527	and it's it's change the way they run the apprenticeships be
S0486	absolutely
S0527	not not good for the the construction industry
S0486	no i'm sure they're not erm
S0527	yeah
S0486	the erm i i mean i do an art degree erm five years ago erm at college with university
S0527	right

S0527	oh
S0486	penultimate well there be one other after my course erm but anyway it er be the college of arts and technology erm and it all she's really interest in in hairdressing apparently
S0527	oh yeah
S0486	the accord to the tutor who all get make redundant they be quite you know cross about that anyway back to you which be far more important so you're a model engineer today and you're
S0527	yes
S0486	and you're here to do the work party yeah
S0527	well i've i've stop in just to drop some materials off really
S0486	oh have you oh
S0527	for for for all the rest of them to do something
S0486	oh
S0486	oh yes well that's right line them up and get them
S0527	yeah this be it
S0486	and get them get them work
S0527	yeah give them something to work with
S0486	erm and erm and so you've be in the model engineer for how long
S0527	erm oh on and off for oh expect thirty years really i suppose
S0486	right
S0527	but er i drop away for a for quite a while it be probably ten or fifteen years erm really not have so much to do with it cos it be more my father's hobby
S0486	yeah
S0527	erm unfortunately when he pass away i decide that you know i'd come and sort of help them do a few bits and piece and then er i've get back into it a bite more since then but er yeah it's it's really er i'm but i've be involve in some way or form for a long time really
S0486	what be you work on at the moment
S0527	er well i've erm not not on the model engineer side except for they've just make three carriages or three carriage
S0486	oh right
S0527	base in there which i'll make all the woodwork top for
S0486	oh right yes
S0527	sort of thing so
S0486	oh right
S0527	erm cos they're hop to have a an open day next year
S0486	right
S0527	erm and they want some extra carriages
S0486	oh right yes i've hear about the open day that that should be interest
S0486	i think there be several school of think on that aren't there
S0527	yes there's a yes there's erm
S0527	it's er should be interest anyway but er yeah so we can get the carriages make and i'm also make a couple of my own so
S0486	right
S0527	i'll get those as well and then they'll have plenty of er carriages to run on their railway here
S0486	jolly good jolly good that's great erm because erm this model engineer be in a park here isn't it can you tell can you describe the park to me this morning
S0527	er yes the park's erm probably about er five hundred yards across and five hundred six or seven hundred yards deep erm it's er originally be a recreation field erm with a football pitch erm with some tennis court on the side the tennis court get very badly vandalise and er disused and we be invite here by the parish council erm to er rent a bite of land and to give the parish council some income at that time erm so that er they could carry on do other things and then we've build a track round the periphery of the park erm which er you know we've get a track run all the way around that do a complete loop tack to a turntable at the other end
S0486	right yeah and erm it it's a er it be a lovely park
S0527	it be
S0486	yeah and the we're we're very near the motorway in the background you can hear the motorway erm and that's that's not a problem erm i use to live in and have this noise all the time and it didn't worry me after a while you don't notice it do you
S0527	no to be honest you don't i mean
S0486	no
S0527	we we work next to a railway line in our workshop and people have come in to us before and say christ bet you enjoy this cos the train aren't run today and you go what train cos you really don't take any notice of the
S0486	exactly
S0527	you know it's right next to the main line
S0486	well i mean also i expect you've get a lot of equipment on the go haven't you noisy equipment
S0527	yeah there's a lot of time yeah
S0486	and you've get ear defenders on i expect and all that sort of thing
S0527	most of the time yeah yeah
S0486	so you wouldn't so erm i know that your father be instrumental and your family in build the large build here
S0527	er
S0486	which you know
S0527	that's it yeah be erm the the carriage be the carriage shed er there be name in his honour after unfortunately after he pass away
S0486	oh
S0527	and they name it in his honour and cos because he be sort of like the drive force behind it if you like
S0486	right
S0527	erm in get it build and that well and for the model engineer for a quite a you know a long a lot of years really
S0486	yeah yeah
S0527	he be er very much involve from about nineteen eighty i think when park
S0486	yes
S0527	originally start up
S0486	yes
S0527	erm so yeah it's er it's nice to sort of like er have the knowledge that there's something's name in his er honour out here really you know
S0486	wonderful
S0527	it's quite a privilege really yeah
S0486	wonderful give the local politics you know that ebb and flow around the place erm it's great that you manage to get it up really
S0527	yeah yeah
S0486	isn't it
S0527	this be it yeah this be it
S0486	bite of an achievement
S0527	er yeah it be really consider er you know well consider we have a lot of vandalism to start with because
S0486	yeah
S0527	as they be build it
S0486	yeah
S0527	whenever night time when all people go home somebody kind person from the village use to come up and push the wall over
S0486	really
S0527	at night time yeah
S0486	really yeah
S0527	yeah sort of thing just sort of and they do find out it be one particular person er i don't know who it be now but live in a bungalow down across the way and he could see it be put up during the day and obviously didn't like the idea of somebody build up here and come up in the night time and push the wall over
S0486	i didn't hear that story
S0527	oh right
S0486	i hadn't hear the story
S0527	yeah
S0486	i do hear cos the twenty years ago when i meet i be live in
S0527	oh right
S0486	and i have a house in fact they're build in you know at the back of it now and i'm jolly glad i be always worry that they be go to build cos there be a lovely field behind and erm one of the things that be in the news at the time be about the bulldozer
S0527	right
S0486	and it how it bulldoze the pavilion down
S0527	yeah yeah
S0486	and i remember that and when later they say oh they're go out to i say oh they mustn't do that and now
S0486	it's a terrible place
S0527	a terrible place
S0486	yeah and so now i've hear that you you know you have trouble with your builder
S0527	yeah this be it yeah as we've build it up they they'd come up the next day or the next week
S0486	yeah
S0527	and find all the wall be push over sort of thing and have to rebuild them
S0486	oh how do you feel about that
S0527	well it's i just think this be just there's er there's too many people with er too much time on their hand if they can come up and do that you know
S0486	yeah
S0527	they'd rather vandalise something than actually construct something
S0486	yes
S0527	you know and er they you know instead of just come along and say well you know why be you here and why do you wanna be here and understand the reason for it
S0486	yeah
S0527	they'd rather just come up on their own and erm
S0486	yeah
S0527	destroy other people's hard work
S0486	yes i mean even if you ask them to to join and come they probably wouldn't come
S0527	no no but they'd rather you know they'd rather spoil everybody else's thing and
S0486	spoil everybody's work yeah
S0527	they cost people money at the end of the day you know and
S0486	oh definitely
S0527	and i think at the end of the day it be criminal damage as well you know
S0486	yeah
S0527	er
S0486	erm do you ever feel at any time about give up i mean give the situation
S0527	well i mean i wasn't that involve at that point
S0486	no
S0527	erm i mean it be because it be more my father's hobby
S0486	yeah
S0527	i think no you know he's happy do that and it's his hobby er and it wasn't until after he go we sort of we say well you know we just will go out there and help er do finish off something he start cos
S0486	yeah
S0527	it be very unusual because usually he be help finish something we start
S0486	right right
S0527	erm so we think we'd go out and sort of help finish it and we be out here sort of thing erm and the clubhouse have be finish by that point
S0486	right
S0527	erm but i mean i know when he use to come back and he use to say you know sort of thing people have be up here and vandalise it they you know
S0486	yeah
S0527	they spend a day build wall and have to then
S0486	yeah
S0527	rebuild them
S0486	yes
S0527	sort of thing which be really
S0486	exactly
S0527	rather dishearten for people
S0486	oh definitely
S0527	yeah
S0486	definitely erm one of the things that really i really admire about the model engineer above any other society be that they're all well you all be craftsmen and you're all engineer
S0527	of some description yeah
S0486	of some description
S0527	yeah yeah
S0486	and that you all make things and sometimes from scratch erm mostly from scratch erm er be say he spend three hours a day in his workshop
S0527	yeah yeah
S0486	and if he can't go in he get grumpy
S0486	er er do that apply to you if you can't make something
S0527	er well i no i well i i enjoy get away
S0527	from the work i have to admit
S0486	oh right well you do
S0527	yeah yeah i do enjoy get away from the work
S0486	yeah right
S0527	erm but i mean i also i've get a boat as well you see
S0486	oh have you
S0527	so er i enjoy sort of
S0486	right
S0527	like er use that which be er something so that's my escape from work and that's
S0486	right
S0527	that's on a marina down in and er
S0486	ah
S0527	if i'm down there i can't be on the phone just
S0527	somebody can't get hold of me easily to say come and do this and come and do that
S0486	yeah
S0527	because the phone be always on twenty four seven but erm
S0486	mm
S0527	i mean it's nice to be away and then you can say well i'm too far away to come and do it you know
S0486	yes exactly and you don't take a mobile with you obviously
S0527	i i do but that's only for emergencies really
S0486	yes yes
S0527	yeah yeah
S0486	so erm well well tell me about your boat that's wonderful erm how many foot long be
S0527	erm it be twenty twenty four feet feet long
S0486	oh right yes
S0527	erm it's a it's a fish a type of fish boat
S0486	yeah
S0527	er it be originally they make them as fish boat but they
S0486	right
S0527	they've they call still call them a fish boat but it's more of a pleasure boat now
S0486	right
S0527	rather than a fish boat erm the they gradually evolve from give less deck space at the back and give more cabin space
S0486	right
S0527	erm which be quite nice and it sleep about four people
S0486	oh i see
S0527	and er
S0486	yeah
S0527	you know you've get a little cooker and fridge and
S0486	yeah
S0527	just just just er pleasurable to get out and get out on the sea really
S0486	so erm be you you're not nervous obviously about take it out
S0527	oh not at all
S0486	erm what what sort of weather would put you off
S0527	erm to be honest as long as long as we're under sort of twenty two miles an hour
S0486	yeah
S0527	we're we're alright and then it depend on the direction of the wind er down in er where i'm in if it's easterlies
S0486	yeah
S0527	er they're particularly bad they have a tendency
S0486	right
S0527	to really chop the sea up
S0486	right
S0527	erm but if it's southerly wind and it's offshore
S0486	right
S0527	you're not too bad
S0486	right
S0527	usually the sea stay fairly flat
S0486	good
S0527	yeah
S0486	right so so whereabouts be it berth do
S0527	er
S0486	oh i know
S0527	yeah
S0486	it's lovely
S0527	yeah it be beautiful

S0527	so it's not too bad
S0486	no
S0527	and of a night time when i come home and it's late
S0486	yeah
S0527	er i can usually do it in about an hour and five

S0486	but we have sail as well
S0527	that's it
S0486	yeah
S0527	i've do a lot of sail in the past cos i use to have very good friends down in
S0486	yeah
S0527	have erm sail boat and that but unfortunately erm they're get older well one unfortunately pass away one's
S0486	yeah
S0527	get very much older which he doesn't do very much
S0486	yes
S0527	but i do prefer sail i have to admit
S0486	yeah
S0527	it's lovely to be out sail
S0486	yes
S0527	but erm unfortunately it's the length it's the upkeep
S0486	yes exactly
S0527	erm cos
S0486	yeah
S0527	it's every time you go up er three feet of stuff you you're pay more on your moor for
S0486	absolutely absolutely
S0527	yeah
S0486	so erm yeah i can imagine that the erm yeah so erm now what have we get to do next oh yeah erm so erm do you take people with you
S0527	i do yeah i take my partner down and my
S0486	yeah
S0527	stepdaughter
S0486	oh
S0527	erm there's also quite a few people i know friends of mine
S0486	yeah
S0527	often say oh well if you're go down the boat we can come
S0486	yes
S0527	sort of thing and i've get quite a few people erm er i've take the erm er my partner's erm sister and her husband
S0486	yes
S0527	and the two children out on it
S0486	yes
S0527	i've take a friend of mine and her two children only youngsters about five and six years old sort of thing
S0486	yeah
S0527	they've come out erm and provide they're well behave it's fine you know
S0486	it's fine
S0527	sort of thing
S0486	yeah
S0527	cos you've gotta be obviously sensible
S0486	oh yeah
S0527	for for safety really
S0486	oh yes
S0527	but i mean we i always make er make sure they you know we all wear life jacket
S0486	yeah
S0527	er so that's the main thing cos you've get
S0486	do do you swim from the boat
S0527	er i haven't er no
S0486	no
S0527	but i mean it's in the summer down there yeah it's quite feasible to do it
S0486	yeah it be
S0527	sort of thing cos the
S0486	yeah
S0527	water temperature do get quite good down there
S0486	yeah i'm sure
S0527	in in the summer
S0486	yes
S0527	er especially if you get into the bay sort of thing
S0486	yeah
S0527	the water temperature can come up quite considerably
S0486	yeah i be take out by some people in once who have a little a small erm little a powerboat and i i be take out and then they stop and say throw the anchor down and say come on now you can go swim and we swim and it be lovely
S0527	yeah yeah
S0486	i never think er i would be absolutely terrify because i'm not really a very good swimmer but the thing be if you just go round the boat and
S0527	yeah that's it and stay close
S0486	there's someone who do sing er swim well
S0527	yeah
S0486	you know
S0527	and be in salt water you always seem a bite more buoyant in salt water as well
S0486	oh exactly exactly
S0527	rather than a swim pool
S0486	and so can you swim well
S0527	i can swim enough if i if my life depend on it
S0527	i could swim well enough
S0527	but if i'm just pleasure swim i do get tire quickly mm
S0486	yeah well exactly
S0527	but er if er if my life depend on it i expect i could
S0486	yeah
S0527	keep go
S0486	well that chap walliams isn't it walliams he he he swim the channel didn't he
S0527	yeah
S0486	erm and erm i i mean i don't know how he do that but they manage to do it somehow so erm look we're at sixteen minutes so we're alright there erm
S0527	very good
S0486	so i can
