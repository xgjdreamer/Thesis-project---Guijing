S0018	so what do you think be one of the most important key responsibilities or competencies involve in the job
S0162	an an understand of what multimedia be and show i'm i've gotta show um my experience in different
S0018	and what what like multimedia be
S0162	be audio um podcast video film still use um social media sit
S0018	mm
S0162	um websites an understand of websites i guess their website it'd probably be good actually to reference their website a couple of time
S0018	well well you say well you say that you'd be look at it on a regular basis for a long time haven't you
S0162	exactly yeah and they they want
S0018	and what what kind of stuff do they put on their websites be it about their project
S0162	it's it's about their project and because it's a a charity they kind of have to show what they're do it's like it's an issue of accountability basically so they'll have either you know photos or short videos or audio um which be kind of show what the project be so for example if they've set up a radio station in iraq
S0018	mm
S0162	they would have some of the audio of a a discussion that be hold or something like that
S0018	mm
S0162	but that i think that link into accountability
S0018	well you've get you've get experience in radio broadcast and social network media haven't you what about cos the film aspect seem quite important have you get experience in that
S0162	well i work at um i've work at two i've work at one i i do some freelance work at a tv company but it be a while ago and i also do some freelance work with a tv journalist so i've do shoot edit
S0018	when be that
S0162	that be when i be try to get a job at the bbc er
S0018	be that in
S0162	it be all over the place it be kind of like round the midlands mostly
S0018	ah cool how long do you do that for
S0162	i just do a few i think i do about five or ten i can't remember about five five or six time i just help out a guy who be make piece for tv and i'd just go and help him
S0018	ah what be that what be he do it about
S0162	normally news items so newsy kind of stories quite a lot of asian stories
S0018	mm mm
S0162	um so that be really good and also you know i'm practise edit and shoot in my own time with the help of a multimedia husband
S0018	but i guess those skills be transferable cos you've be edit radio piece for what ten years
S0162	mm about five six years but
S0018	but isn't it transferable
S0162	it be transferable but it's completely different software
S0018	yeah
S0162	and edit still be er edit sorry visuals be be very different to just have one line of audio
S0018	mm but i guess the software change so frequently nowadays though that if you
S0162	yeah i mean i think i think also that um you know it's about i think in some ways you're right they're transferable skills because it's about story board it think about what you know what be it gonna look like as an entire piece what's the story you're tell script it which i which i do um and you know i want to brush up on my film and edit abilities and the way to do that would be to be in a job where i be do it or have the opportunity to do it
S0018	mm mm
S0162	but i think also a big part of the roll be actually devise some of the team about what they could do what they could make
S0018	where would the team be this like team in different countries
S0162	yeah team in different countries so it might be like you know you could oh you've gotta um it could be something like they're make a radio drama to um talk about health issue right but the radio drama's go to be the vehicle to kind of inform people but they could then perhaps film one of the one of the days when they're all record and they're in the studio they could do a really short film show you know and then it would show the face of the people involve and them all get together and record and um you know where they're record how they're do it or it could be that they talk to somebody about the radio drama who say how it's connect with them and inform them on health issue um
S0018	and how do they get that out there through radio and tv or internet or all of them
S0162	they're all different project in different countries so they've actually like in some countries they'd have actually go in and use erm the money to set up a radio station so
S0018	oh cool
S0162	they'll you know pay for the for the place of the studios the equipment
S0018	ah and you'd be in charge of like the um train the people there too
S0162	i'd i'd be there to help and advise them but also i'd be my main responsibility i think would be to get them to make material that i could then that could then go on the website so erm but yeah also help and support them and give them ideas just stuff and
S0018	that sound like your perfect job it really do
S0162	exactly it sound really good
S0018	and they give an give you an idea of how much travel be involve
S0162	no it's mostly base in london it's say but it it ask for an ability or willingness to travel to asia and africa they have project in thirteen countries
S0018	what be the countries
S0162	um iraq okay well actually we should probably think about if it say asia and africa in africa i know they've get project in like somalia recently asia they've just do something in cambodia india um
S0018	right so somalia be when the whole sort of
S0162	yeah exactly
S0018	part of the job description
S0162	but that's a good question actually i need to brush up on that where be the i think that kind of question though be go to be more of an interview question
S0018	yeah
S0162	not in an application form question
S0018	true true
S0162	what do you think
S0018	no definitely cos you don't i mean you can say in your application form how you have that you do sympathise a lot and you're enthusiastic in the you know that you're really interest in what they're do and that you can you can say that you've be check out their website on a
S0162	and i can also say that i've travel extensively um particularly in india i've live abroad i've work
S0018	and you've train people and
S0162	i've train people and i've work abroad so that show a kind of
S0018	mm but you've train people in spain and the czech republic haven't you
S0162	yeah exactly
S0018	so that's that kind of cover that base
S0162	um and i've travel i do the i do the cambodia thing last year so
S0018	i do the cambodia thing
S0162	yeah you know but it's er but it's show that there's kind of an understand of the world i think
S0018	yeah
S0162	and that i've visit develop countries and um you know cos for some people it's not an easy thing to go to a develop country
S0018	well that's what i be say about this job in thailand
S0162	yeah
S0018	i mean i know it's not that much of a develop country but still when you're in a culture that you don't know anything about you don't speak the language it's an enormous challenge to be able to operate you know do your job to the best of your abilities when you're in situation that's completely alien to you
S0162	exactly
S0018	so
S0162	exactly um so and you know i haven't live in india but i've be there for like i go that time for about six weeks or something
S0018	yeah
S0162	which i think be a a pretty solid period of time
S0018	definitely and you've live how long do you live in spain
S0162	about three years three years
S0018	that show that you've live in a different culture and
S0162	exactly
S0018	and work
S0162	exactly
S0018	and learn the language and
S0162	yeah and um
S0018	so
S0162	i'm just wonder whether there could be something in there about think about india and travel and cambodia and travel but like when we be in cambodia we go to a lot of kind of social project and that kind of stuff so maybe there's something in that isn't there about
S0018	definitely or you could say as a personal a blob lob al a as a personal interest um i enjoy travel and it um not just visit the touristic sit but find out what's happen on a grass root level in different social project for example in cambodia last year we duduluduludula whatever
S0162	yeah we should well i think that's an interest point actually i think that's an interest point actually
S0018	yeah
S0162	um so yeah you know you've just gotta go for these things really haven't you
S0018	definitely and what else do they say with the competencies you've manage to i reckon that you're you've have experience and you've demonstrate quite a lot of the competencies um like you've lead team you've work in team influence and persuade
S0162	mm
S0018	i think be probably quite important communication i don't know whether you should mention actually focus on communication because it your job over the past six years have be facilitate communication and broadcast so maybe
S0162	oh yeah and have to find people speak to them convince them to do radio so that's all about communication
S0018	and creative think
S0162	that's something i need to talk about creative think
S0018	definitely but not only the creative think but to be able to transform those ideas into practical reality then again you've talk about that a lot in the first question
S0162	yeah cos that's
S0018	on the application
S0162	that's exactly what that question be about isn't it
S0018	what about editorial judgement i guess that's be you be you i mean you have an editor no or do you do a lot of the edit
S0162	yeah but i have to have editorial judgement because the piece that you know i have to be make it in an editorial way i do have an editor who then will listen to stuff but you know it's my responsibility basically she may she may advise me on on things but then i also advise people on editorial as well
S0018	mm
S0162	so people in the i'll talk to them about how they so the story how to balance it how to that kind of stuff
S0018	mm
S0162	so um it and this isn't this be not like a senior producer's job it's a producer's job so there would be somebody that i'm report to if you like
S0018	yeah yeah i'm just wonder whether you can say talk about your job and kind of cover a lot of these requirements
S0162	yeah i think so
S0018	in a short paragraph for example your job already encapsulate share skills with others experience of deliver train as a teacher trainer um understand the value and the the guidelines
S0162	mm
S0018	um health and safety
S0162	well yeah i think it's quite a consideration because if the project be in develop countries obviously um and not just develop countries in term of poverty but also often in politically unstable countries
S0018	oh okay
S0162	so you have to have an understand so if you're advise a team to do something you know you can't you have to take into consideration the fact that there could be a curfew or you know
S0018	right
S0162	they can't go out at night because there's trouble at the moment or that
S0018	i be think more along the line of don't put your cup of tea too close to your laptop
S0162	well that's also important as well um cos it say look deliver output in risky contexts
S0018	mm
S0162	so
S0018	yeah well it seem that you've get oh it just sound like your dream job though cos do you remember when you be think of apply for a job with oxfam
S0162	oh yeah yeah
S0018	cos i could
S0162	i do apply for it actually but it wasn't like this it wasn't so kind of hand on and
S0018	well it didn't have media
S0162	it be i think it be a press officey job or something
S0018	oh i guess that's quite media relate isn't it
S0162	just sell press sell stuff to press really but yeah so it it's it's an excite time it's a very excite time
S0018	ee and how long to you reckon you'd have to spend in london do you think you'd you'd move down there would be able to move down
S0162	well
S0018	with you
S0162	it i don't think i think we'd probably still base ourselves here because it say three or four or five days but so i'm assume there's some kind of um discussion around that
S0018	they're flexible
S0162	they're flexible so um if it be for example just three or four days a week i'd just i'd have to look at rent somewhere for three days a week or
S0018	haven't you haven't you get any friends down there you could crash on their floor
S0162	this be it we've get i've get friends and stuff that i could ask and also
S0018	have you have your have your brother still get the flat in london or be he rent it out
S0162	he's still get the house but as far as i know all the room be rent out but i can always ask
S0018	or sleep in the bath
S0162	or sleep in the bath and yeah between me and we've get load of friends down there so it could be you know sometimes other people be work away or whatever or they wouldn't mind rent out a room for three nights a week
S0018	yeah true
S0162	i don't i don't see that as a big issue and
S0018	ooh would the would the salary be london weight
S0162	probably i don't know anything about the salary
S0018	that would be cool
S0162	but even even say er i have to commute at the begin it be only one and a half hours on the train to london and you know plenty of people from that i know go down to london two three time a week
S0018	wendy do it yeah quite a lot doesn't she
S0162	exactly do it
S0018	then it when i be work in on the other side of it i use to yeah i use to allow an hour and forty five minutes just to be sure
S0162	exactly so and i you know in fact maybe it's i don't know do you think it's something i should mention in the cos they can see my address so they know i'm base in
S0018	yeah but they will probably assume that you be base in because of your job and
S0162	oh yeah you're right you're right so they wouldn't really need to
S0018	then again i mean if you're think about commute three days a week you'd probably save it would probably cost just as much to commute as it would to rent out
S0162	yeah it's true i mean i ideally i'd like to find you know a friend's room that i could you know
S0018	where's
S0162	she's in and er she use to have a house where there be a spare little room and we always use to joke about it cos i be like and i stay there a few time and and she be like you know it would be perfect if you get a job here cos you could just rent it but she hasn't get it any more but there's enough of a network of people and even you know at the begin i don't mind crash on someone's floor a bite
S0018	hmm
S0162	so you know i think it's about the job i mean i location doesn't worry me at all but i don't and and 's in london like two he'll be in london at least two days a week
S0018	hmm
S0162	from now this week he be there from wednesday to thursday friday work
S0018	but so they pay to put him up when he's there
S0162	yeah he get pay
S0018	oh cool and what about his friends
S0162	and i'm sure they wouldn't mind if i crash on their floor there's quite a few of them actually so um i i i you know i'm i'm it's pretty i think it'll be pretty okay um
S0018	it'll be doable definitely
S0162	yeah
S0018	be you still think of er buy a place up here though if
S0162	yeah i think we'll still buy somewhere here so we'll still we're always gonna have a base cos we've get family here so yeah we'll definitely still buy something up this way and um yeah you know spend a bite of time in london i think it'd be nice to work in london
S0018	it would be ar it's such a it'd be nice to have a a base here but be able to
S0162	exactly work in work in london and get a bite of the london vibe
S0018	mm
S0162	for a few days of the week and um it's a bite more excite i think to work in london
S0018	definitely it's more things be more creative there's more opportunities there's a lot more i mean up here if you wanna go out and see something or do something i don't know it kind of like seem that you have to wait until something be on whereas in london you just say okay i wanna go out tonight
S0162	yeah
S0018	you just check what's on and
S0162	yeah definitely i think for media it's a good place to be i think in term of the industry there's so much go on in london that it's a good place to be but i'm not you know i'm not go to think about the practicalities of it yet
S0018	mm
S0162	i'm just go to concentrate on it stage by stage and you know if if i get an interview that's brilliant if i don't then i can go back to them and talk to them about i've make a contact now so
S0018	yep i think that's important especially if you if you're able to er even i mean even if you don't get an interview maybe you could ask just to come in and chat to them because you're really interest in what they're do
S0162	exactly
S0018	and maybe collaborate on a freelance would would your boss
S0162	even ask just to shadow
S0018	yeah
S0162	so you know whoever do get this job offer to shadow or
S0018	could you not get an attachment if you if you weren't to get the job could you not get an attachment
S0162	it have to be advertise the job have to still be advertise there have to be an attachment for you to go for
S0018	oh
S0162	um but who know who know i think it will be a very competitive job but um
S0018	do you know anyone else who's apply for it
S0162	no i didn't really wanna tell lot of people in case in case they haven't see it and they decide to apply for it
S0018	shh top secret
S0162	although it be on a web you know on the website so we'll see what happen so what about you how's your job hunt go
S0018	yeah fine i'm glad actually to see the process that you're go through write your job applications cos i just think it be me that take so long over them
S0162	oh no i take i'm take age i've be really slow but it's good it's and i don't think you should rush them do you
S0018	no no no definitely not rush them but i be just surprise at how many hours you have to put in into write it and then edit it as well and then proof read it and then check the content check this
S0162	it's a job to get a job
S0018	yeah well the one that i be go for be um a lot of proof read and copy edit you know it have a big a big part of the job be proof read and copy edit eh edit so i think if my cv and application aren't well write and i'm not even go to get a chance to get invite for interview but
S0162	it's pretty hard nowadays apply for job
S0018	well i just think it's yeah it's it's even more important cos there be so many people go for the job it's even more important to get your job application and your cv and your cover letter to
S0162	it's like
S0018	to convey exactly what you
S0162	what they say but also what be it about your application that's gonna be different say there's like a hundred people go for this job they've all get the skills
S0018	mm
S0162	you know what be it there's get to be something in there that shin out there's get to be something that they connect with because if they just go through all of them go yep same kind of experience same kind of skills
S0018	yeah
S0162	what be it so
S0018	definitely but i find cos you have to write it in quite a formal tone you know you be say try and make sure you sound enthusiastic and
S0162	yeah yeah
S0018	it's quite difficult to convey that when you're still try to follow the the formality of the cos er like a cover letter be a formal letter isn't it and
S0162	yeah yeah but i bet you do i mean the bite we saw you do sound enthusiastic you just need to up it a bite and you do it's just by it doesn't mean that you have to be um you know kind of too cheesy but it's just some of the term that you put in and some of the
S0018	i love your company
S0162	you know it's understand like the brand or whatever it be and show that you understand it it's
S0018	mm
S0162	um you know say why you're passionate about it i guess
S0018	mm would you use that word passionate
S0162	it's a good question because i think i have put it i might have put something about well i've write i would love to work for you innit
S0018	innit as in
S0162	isn't it
S0018	okay
S0162	um that's that obviously that's not gonna go on the final edit but um er i think i've put somewhere that i have also have a passion for the work
S0018	oh that's okay that sound better that i be passionate about i dream about it every night
S0162	and i've talk about how i've always you know i've be aware of their work for a long time um visit the website keep up to date with the work of the charity
S0018	mm
S0162	look at ways for promote the stories for the audiences i work with so i have actually do piece on some of the project that world service the world service um that the organisation um have do in india and kind of try to relate that to british indian communities
S0018	mm
S0162	so yeah you know i think there's a fine line between you know you've get you've just gotta be careful not to be too cheesy but you have to be honest
S0018	mm i think the enthusiasm be something that probably come over more in interview though doesn't it
S0162	mm
S0018	it's very difficult to put yourself over on paper it's a lot easier to communicate that face to face
S0162	sometimes but sometimes interview can be a complete nightmare
S0018	oh god yeah i'm a shiver wreck in interview then again i think the experience teach and get up and get up stand up in front of you know thirty odd people not odd people but
S0018	thirty odd people um help you develop those skills of not not mind so much be in the focus and
S0162	exactly you know and i mean what i don't like about interview be or the interview i've be to most recently be that kind of feel as you walk in and there's a panel of people say three or four and they're all make note and like every time you say something and they're like scribble something down or they tick something or they but they don't show any emotion at all
S0018	mm
S0162	and you're just it's it's kind of weird it's like someone once tell me that if they're write things down after you um answer a question it's a good sign
S0018	mm
S0162	because it mean that they're take note and and obviously you've say something right
S0018	nowadays isn't it all about tick box though and not actually write
S0162	yeah that's true tick
S0018	tick tick cross
S0162	but um i go for this one job where i have to go for three interview
S0018	three
S0162	yeah an application form and then three interview
S0018	that's a bite excessive
S0162	i know one of them be like a practical session the there be a panel interview and then there be a one to one interview which i fail on
S0018	what be they three separate occasion or three
S0162	three separate occasion
S0018	oh wow
S0162	yeah it be quite crazy actually
S0018	i be surprise at the different that it's very task base a lot of interview nowadays it's obviously formal chat when they're ask you about your cv and you know you can expect question like what would you do in this circumstance or what what do you think about this aspect of blah blah blah but i have to do actual task i have to give a i have to prepare and give a presentation oh you remember
S0162	yeah yeah
S0018	um and that be crazy because they they ask me to to critically evaluate their products
S0162	oh no
S0018	and obviously you don't want you you have to fulfil the task but then you're think okay i have to my feedback have to be critical so you know you have to give some suggestions for improvement though but also you don't wanna completely slate the company that you're try to get a job with
S0162	exactly say how rubbish they be yeah that doesn't really that doesn't really help at all i always think that actually sometimes the hardest thing be even though you know it in your head be just when they say why why do you want the job or why would you be good for the job
S0018	hmm
S0162	you know and it's like oo
S0018	but those be kind of question that you can prepare for i get i get more scar when they ask me question that you have to quickly think up a a concise yet effective response in a matter of milliseconds
S0162	so what have you do when have you be in a situation where you can't answer the question
S0018	yeah yeah yeah and i say oh i'd have to do more research about that i couldn't tell you i i couldn't say right now what i would do in that situation
S0162	and do you get the job
S0018	well i get offer the assistant position of the job
S0162	oh well that's alright
S0018	but i think that's because i i be when i be ask them question i be ask them question about whether there be a lot of support give to new new intake staff and
S0162	oh right that's why they hand you the assistant
S0018	i've yeah cos i think i didn't pitch myself as very confident because obviously you know i've always be a teacher and i think you develop a lot of transferable skills as a teacher but when you go into a job that's office base when you're use to have spend you know most of your work life in a classroom interact with people and that's your job as oppose to sit there plough through paper work and manage project then again i mean er classroom teach be all about manage project really isn't it
S0162	manage people
S0018	i can't remember what the question be that they ask me that i couldn't that i didn't know how to answer oh no it be about assessment procedures
S0162	i don't like it already assessment procedures ugh sound terrible
S0018	no i can't remember exactly what the word be but no when when i didn't have any knowledge of that question because i have no previous experience in the field that wasn't too much of a faux pas to say i don't know but it's when they ask you of a
S0162	i think that when you answer as be honest be good
S0018	yeah true
S0162	it's like actually you know i don't know this but i would i would go and research it i think i'm more likely to try and make up an answer if i didn't know but that's not necessarily the best technique for an interview or um answer a different question you know like you go into an interview you have all these pre prepare answer and then they don't ask you the question it's really frustrate
S0018	i'd say it be the ability to think on your feet isn't it
S0162	yeah and then afterwards i always like to ask at least two or three question cos they always say have you get any question and i i don't know i always feel weird if i don't so
S0018	mm although it's good to say no i think you've cover everything
S0162	yeah that's a good one i guess you could you be very thorough
S0018	oh i might write that down actually that's a good one
S0162	i really like you
S0018	i could work with you could you work with me do you wanna give me a job go on
S0162	what about in spain do you go for interview in spain or be that a different process
S0018	no i always get the job on the basis of send them a cv and um i guess because not as many people there there aren't many people that have get as much experience as i have and um like a master's level qualification
S0162	yeah
S0018	cos in spain it's kind of a teacher train factory isn't it so most of the teachers go for job be people that have be be there for you know have a couple of years' experience and just do a certificate so i usually just walk into the job on the strength of my cv and whenever i they call me in for interview it be never rigorous it be more okay we just wanna check that you haven't get two head or you haven't get tattoo all over your face
