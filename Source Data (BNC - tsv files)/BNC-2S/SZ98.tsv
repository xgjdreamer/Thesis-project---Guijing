S0439	god
S0441	he's like he's actually in a domestic
S0439	really
S0441	mm
S0439	to be fair i think that's really unfair like a lot of men don't come forward because because of domestic abuse
S0441	mm
S0439	because they think it's like unmanly or whatever
S0441	mm
S0439	such bollocks
S0439	that's so sad
S0441	as well like women can go to refuges and stuff but what can men do
S0439	yeah
S0441	like be there a refuge for men
S0439	there probably be something but
S0441	yeah
S0439	it's just not very well documentated
S0441	it's not
S0439	domestic domestic violence be just
S0441	it's not it's not physical it's emotional
S0439	that's sometimes just worse that's not worse like
S0441	cos he he stop she stop him work like dissuade him from go to work and stuff
S0439	mm
S0441	and he hasn't get any money and she doesn't give him any money like doesn't share
S0439	yeah
S0441	he's get nothing
S0439	some some women i just don't understand
S0439	but then again it's like why be he with her why doesn't he just leave her
S0441	well then that's easy isn't it you're not if if you've be wear down that much by somebody you probably think that they're the best you're gonna get and that's it
S0439	mm god i'd hate to be in a relationship like that obviously er er anybody would hate to be in a relationship like that
S0441	mm
S0439	but your mum's alright and she look after him well not look after him
S0441	i mean he's absolutely fine when he's with us
S0439	yeah
S0441	that's not an issue like you wouldn't have ever think that there be any problem
S0439	mm
S0441	he just get he suffer from really bad anxiety now
S0439	ah
S0441	and he's get he doesn't understand like he doesn't see his symptoms as anxiety as anxiety symptoms
S0439	yeah
S0441	like he's get he get really bad er indigestion and like problems
S0439	oh yeah yeah like through stress like ibs trigger through stress and stuff
S0441	yeah but not it's not it's not as such it's ibs but it's like his
S0439	yeah
S0439	mm
S0441	he be like i i don't know what's what's what happen really like my stomach hasn't be play up at all since i've be here
S0439	ah
S0439	ah that's er bless him
S0441	mm
S0439	there's you can do be there
S0441	mm
S0439	apart from just look after him when he come over and just spend time with him
S0441	luckily he's be assess by er mental health
S0439	oh that's good
S0439	that's really good
S0441	house association and domestic abuse people
S0439	oh wow brilliant well not brilliant but you know what i mean like it's good that they're take step in that direction
S0441	mm my mum get to speak to them as well and they like what actually happen cos he doesn't ever say you know
S0439	it's just think how many like in how many families be this actually go on
S0439	like 's like a social 's a social worker
S0441	yeah
S0439	and the amount of things she see she's just apparently on average it's a woman be either er physically abuse or emotionally abuse forty eight time before she call the police
S0441	
S0439	i be just like forty eight time
S0441	mm
S0439	on average that mean somebody must've like take er like a hundred beat before they call the police
S0441	mm
S0439	that's it's just horrendous isn't it
S0439	cos you always think oh if i get if my boyfriend or if my husband hit me i'd go straight to the police or i'd leave him but you you wouldn't
S0441	you probably wouldn't probably
S0439	like as much as i like pretend that i'm like a really strong person and all that kind of stuff if i be in love with somebody and he hit me i'd still be like oh he be have a bad day and it won't happen again
S0441	yeah yeah
S0439	cos you just would
S0441	you would or you'd say oh maybe i push him to
S0439	yeah
S0441	better
S0439	yeah
S0441	and and if you probably get into that mindset for a long time you'd just start believe it wouldn't you
S0439	yeah er yeah i
S0439	i as much as i'm ashamed to admit it if my if i be in a relationship and he hit me once i probably would take him
S0441	i probably would as well
S0439	i probably would take him back
S0441	i probably would
S0439	second time i would be like fuck no
S0441	yeah
S0439	the first time er i always i would always try to give someone the benefit of the doubt
S0439	which i know in that situation you probably shouldn't
S0441	and then er then you're open yourself to always let it happen
S0439	yeah exactly yeah yeah i think you have to be so brave to be able to turn round on the first time and just be like no i'm walk away from this
S0441	mm
S0439	but erm yeah at least your uncle's get the help he need
S0441	hopefully
S0439	well yeah finger cross how be today though be it alright have any interest case no

S0441	yes he can
S0439	like er i saw yesterday and i be talk to about it and she go would you and would you and ever get back together and i be like no because i think you need to be in a relationship with somebody who challenge you and like not enlighten you that sound gay but you know like offer you new experience or push you and like introduce you to new things and he wouldn't do any of that for me
S0441	he's a he's a complete twat

S0439	yeah it's like if i be na√Øve i'd be like oh wow he care so much but he just doesn't
S0441	no he's
S0439	he's just do it because he doesn't know what else to do
S0441	and he know that you're there i suppose
S0439	yeah like i don't i reply i do reply sometimes i don't reply as much as i use to

S0441	mm
S0439	er so we bid for like to publish fourteen book last year for them
S0441	mm
S0439	and we win them all so we publish fourteen book however apparently we're the worst perform publisher in get the book out
S0441	oh no
S0439	so there's us oup hodder and collins and we all bid for products and then like er what be they call what's it call when erm begin with b do it yeah to ballot
S0441	okay
S0439	so you you go in for er you go in for the tender and then you win the tender and apparently of our fourteen title and compare to everybody else's we're the worst perform
S0441	oh my god
S0439	but it's only like i think because we've get like some really difficult title
S0441	okay
S0439	and then i realise that we we manage to publish four on time then there's ten remain and we have this whole team meet i be like apparently erm so say there's ten title that be remain and they're the ten fail ones i'm project coordinator on four out of the ten
S0441	oh
S0439	and er that mean i'm literally
S0439	i'm nearly like er fifty percent of the failure be really my fault
S0439	like oh it's fine because i've get pre u sciences and pre u maths
S0441	yeah
S0439	the candidate number in the whole country be like two hundred people the products be gonna cost us like forty grand to make despite the fact that the candidacy be only for like two hundred people
S0441	god that suck
S0439	like yeah it's er they're the four worst project basically they're the most unviable
S0441	why have you get them
S0439	i don't know they're non viable we should never have do them they're cost too much they're take too long and the author's just no
S0439	and i and and they be just like and be just like it's fine you get give four really shit project no one be blame you i'm like thank
S0441	that's good though
S0439	yeah yeah it be just it be just when she say that i be like oh crap i'm the project coordinator for like four out of the ten like forty percent of the project fail be mine great
S0439	so
S0441	it's fine
S0439	yeah also if you well obviously when you move out
S0441	mm
S0439	what be we gonna do about the sofa
S0441	it's fine i'll take it i'll pay you fifty pound and take it
S0439	oh okay well or twenty five it be only like a
S0441	it be a hundred i think
S0439	oh be it
S0441	mm
S0439	oh okay
S0441	so there's fifty for my bed as well
S0439	oh fair enough
S0441	sure it be wasn't it yeah
S0439	yeah i think yeah
S0441	mm okay yeah that's fine
S0439	oh yeah it be yeah
S0441	mm my mum be like it's a really good sofa so if you don't want it i'll have it i be like okay fine
S0439	yeah yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't know what's good
S0439	so that's fine with me
S0441	yeah yeah that's fine
S0439	be like what be we gonna do with the sofa and like the bed and stuff like cos you're
S0441	erm
S0439	i guess you can take the bed apart can't you
S0441	yeah could probably have that at home anyway cos it's quite a nice bed
S0439	would you go into 's room
S0441	only on the sort of deal with it when he come home he can sleep in there
S0439	oh okay
S0441	which be fine cos he's never really home anyway
S0439	yeah
S0441	cos i have i've actually
S0439	yeah it be your room originally though
S0441	it be actually just go back into my own room
S0439	exactly
S0441	it'll be fine i think
S0439	mm and how er
S0439	it'll only be for like a year like
S0441	not even hopefully not even two years
S0439	yeah
S0441	it'll hopefully it'll be eighteen months from when i move back in
S0439	mm
S0441	cos it be two years from now about eighteen months hopefully
S0439	how much be you plan on save
S0441	if i can save five hundred pound a month then i'll have six thousand off by the end of the year and then see what we cos they're do ninety five percent mortgage again now
S0439	yeah and also the government have a help to buy scheme
S0441	yeah
S0439	and must have at least like fifteen grand
S0441	he's get a lot save up so
S0439	yeah
S0441	and maybe i can bring something else to the table like the sofa
S0439	and cook
S0441	yeah
S0439	but also even if like the initial deposit deposit be slightly more him
S0441	you'd still pay the same
S0439	you'd still pay the same mortgage
S0441	yeah
S0439	and you could just contribute like an extra hundred quid towards the mortgage each month or something like that
S0441	yeah
S0439	like you could always work it out that way
S0441	yeah yeah
S0439	like in the grand scheme of things if he put in what like fifteen grand and you put in seven grand or something in the grand scheme of in the grand scheme of things seven thousand pound be not a lot of money
S0441	no
S0439	against like a hundred and fifty thousand pound house
S0441	no
S0439	so if you do break up it wouldn't be like well i have seven thousand pound more invest in this house it's like so
S0441	i'd probably just walk away
S0439	yeah i'd be like it's seven grand
S0441	it's fine
S0439	you can have it
S0441	just take it
S0439	yeah not that you be gonna break up
S0441	well you never know we might do
S0441	i hope not if we be buy a house together i really hope not but you know
S0439	oh god just imagine if have buy house with her
S0441	jesus christ then she would've be stupid
S0439	yeah i just feel so bad like what do you do if you'd move all the way to another country to be
S0441	i know that's hard
S0439	like this be only what they start go out maybe in the august
S0441	mm
S0439	of last year
S0441	mm
S0439	he leave the end of september october last year so what they've be go out let's say they've be go out for like six weeks
S0441	mm
S0439	just sound stupid to anyway but
S0441	go out for six weeks and she move here
S0439	be go out for long
S0439	because i i he'd only just be he'd only just go on a date with her when i be see and i be see in like the june of last year
S0439	yeah so and he have only just go on a date with her so unless they jump into a relationship really quickly they can't've be like boyfriend for like
S0441	okay
S0439	more than two months
S0441	she's a little bite more stupid than i think
S0439	so say they've be go out hypothetically for two months and then he come back in september october and i don't think she move to the uk until like january so she's be in the country for like eight months and for like the entire time she's be here he's want her to go home
S0441	it's not like she just live in you know france
S0439	yeah
S0441	it's pretty far away to
S0439	yeah like your boyfriend's just dump you his mum agree with him like his mum be like yeah you shouldn't be like you make the right decision
S0439	her his brother 's a complete knob anyway but say that he make the right decision cos 's a complete cunt and i never use that word but he seriously be erm yeah just she have no one here to support her like
S0441	hope she's make a friend somewhere i hope
S0439	i she have well you'd hope so
S0441	i hope so
S0439	in though not really sure like
S0441	mm true
S0439	the calibre of friends you would have up there
S0441	maybe a work friend
S0439	who's not from
S0441	yep
S0439	i'm so horrible but yeah no yeah just to have your boyfriend of like a year let's say turn round and tell you to go home like
S0441	harsh
S0439	that's harsh like it be a brutal text message
S0441	what be wrong with him
S0439	i don't know like he wasn't brutal as in like you're a bitch i hate you it's just more like
S0441	just to the point
S0439	yeah like very blunt like do not hope that we'll get back together please go home
S0441	well i guess that's good in a way but still not good
S0439	yeah like you can't just go home like you have to like end your tenancy get your deposit back
S0441	yeah it's a little bite difficult
S0439	yeah
S0441	more difficult than just go home isn't it really
S0439	like the flat like
S0441	yeah
S0439	sell the furniture like what the fuck
