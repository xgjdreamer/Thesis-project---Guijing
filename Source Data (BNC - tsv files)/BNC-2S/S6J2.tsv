S0084	oh god i'm not sure what that's what's suppose to happen
S0041	he say i never think that i'd be the person to let you down like that to that extent die who do you think feel worse
S0084	oh god well it need to be say didn't it that's the thing
S0041	yeah i feel better that i've get everything off off my chest like
S0084	okay yeah
S0041	i feel like he understand and i say to him about even about the in the so we be in the hotel and we have a conversation very similar to this in which i kind of take responsibility for the the way that we i behave if we be together and that i kind of panic if something go wrong
S0084	mm
S0041	and i say but you never say anything back do you not think no wonder i panic
S0084	yeah
S0041	i never behave like that with anybody else i've ever know
S0084	mm
S0041	well except for you because you're the only person that i felt so concern that if something go wrong i wasn't pick just me up i be pick you up as well
S0084	yeah
S0041	and now i don't need to pick you up
S0084	yeah
S0041	and i say you you never think think about it at all you never give anything you never evaluate you
S0084	no no it be all it be all you know to do about you and your fault
S0041	yeah so
S0084	so how do you leave things then
S0041	erm he say send send his love to my dad and and basically see you around
S0084	mm
S0041	and he say you know i hope you do keep me post with navy things as you go through the the process
S0084	yeah
S0041	i suppose i'll just text him like i'd text his mum
S0084	well it's up to you isn't it i mean it if it be me i wouldn't as i i've say to you
S0041	no i'm not
S0084	i've put you off the plate back in here for the warm
S0041	the warm i'll probably wait to see if i hear from him on my birthday
S0084	yeah
S0041	if i don't i won't text him
S0084	i'm sure he will definitely text you on your birthday well i would have think so
S0041	mm you never know with this guy yeah it's just i think it's easier to pretend he doesn't exist now
S0084	i think this be the bite where you walk away
S0041	yeah
S0084	you've say your piece you've say what you want to say
S0041	i've say my bite and feel better about it and
S0084	anything else that's get say now be just go to be rake up the same issue
S0041	yeah
S0084	it's go to hurt again and again and again
S0041	quickly yeah i think so too that's that's good for me
S0041	he say er do you know you're the most amaze person i know he say cos no matter what happen no matter what you you do you always take the situation and make make yourself the best you can be out of it and i see you i see you every time become a better person because of things
S0084	mm yeah
S0041	and i'm think in my head that's just what adults do that's what you do that's a natural reaction
S0084	mm yeah okay yeah
S0041	erm and he say i read he say i read a an article today er it be a design thing erm and it be basically about get rid of a sorry get rid of everybody need to get rid of things in their life that be surplus to requirement
S0084	right
S0041	you know that you're not that don't help you that actually hinder you and he say i've realise i've become one of those people for you
S0084	a bite fuck melodramatic isn't it
S0041	mm
S0084	erm well i mean it that whole self that's that's the same thing isn't it the self loathe that oh i can't do anything about it it's change my personality bollocks
S0041	yeah
S0084	it's just that you know it's it's like he's not take responsibility he's just say woe be me i'm such a bad you know i'm such a bad friend oh dear oh dear he never do anything about it because this be hardly the first time you've say you're let me down can you man up
S0041	yeah
S0084	i mean how many time have you have this conversation you know i mean i appreciate today it's probably a bite more sever than he's use to
S0041	yeah
S0084	but london be pretty bad
S0041	yeah that be pretty bad
S0084	and the time before that when he you know you be say here
S0041	it's like he can't gauge severity
S0084	it's like i mean he he get upset every time you have this conversation and even if that's his gauge for how serious a conversation be he can see that you're hurt which then upset him fine so you know it's not malicious he just isn't do anything to change it
S0041	yeah but i be i remember you know if we use to argue he it's as if he didn't quite grasp how angry i be
S0084	mm
S0041	and i i once scream at him so bad i throw him out of the car i've never be that angry with anyone but it's like he couldn't it's like he didn't quite get how how bad it be
S0084	mm
S0041	and that's i think that's a bite of an autistic thing
S0084	yeah
S0041	like the way he walk in here today as if he know it be wrong but he didn't know how wrong to me
S0084	he didn't know what be wrong yeah
S0041	yeah
S0084	even though when you leave things in london you say be it you want if you want to be friends man up
S0041	yeah
S0084	and he just hasn't do that
S0041	no
S0084	cos obviously he wasn't here last week so
S0041	i'm a bite scar about the flip
S0084	i'm feel very confident for you
S0041	what about if the olive go everywhere though
S0084	i'd do it over the hob and then at least it can be save as oppose to over the floor
S0084	wooh you didn't end up with a pancake hat though
S0041	oh oh no oh no no no no open up it clearly wasn't ready for flip wasn't quite wasn't quite cook yet just burn you up on there now
S0084	cook cook cook
S0041	i'm just feel like i'm drain my resources be just go
S0084	well as hard as it be at least you know you've make the right decision
S0041	yeah he's probably never go to man up in his whole whole life
S0084	probably not in the short term not in the time that you need to because he would have do by now
S0041	uh uh
S0084	i know maybe it's you know it's ask quite a lot from him maybe he just need the time you know normally it's when you're single that you really sort of have that self reflection and he's not really do that because he's just launch himself straight into something
S0041	mm
S0084	that look to be fairly easy go but have quickly become quite serious you know plan all your weekend together you know book a holiday with each other when you've only have like three date
S0041	yeah
S0084	do you reckon that's probably another sign of him not be able to gauge what's acceptable because you wouldn't book a holiday with somebody you've only see three time
S0041	yeah no you wouldn't
S0084	mental issue of the brain
S0041	mental issue of the brain yo erm don't really know when you know these be cook
S0084	be that cook
S0041	don't know
S0084	aren't they suppose to be more brown than that
S0041	i think so yeah
S0084	do it need to be flip again
S0041	do you think
S0084	it's an it's an alien alien come out
S0041	oh i'm a bite scar of the flip
S0084	wooh there you go
S0041	that's cook on that side now isn't it
S0084	yeah apart form the alien growth on the middle that's fine that look delicious delicious and nutritious again
S0084	hmm i go around to my mum's today at lunch it be really nice actually because i have the car and i my head be hurt quite a lot this morning so i just think oh fuck it i'll taka a longer lunch i work through my lunch yesterday

S0041	argh
S0084	my sister make me a cheesie a cheesie toastie it be nice we be talk about life and the universe which be a bite full on for a lunch time
S0041	seem to be a bite of full on wednesday i think
S0084	yeah it's all a bite serious no wonder my head about to fall out my my ears
S0041	yep
S0084	no wonder
S0041	be your sister still set on er a foreign life
S0084	yeah well the course that she want really really really want to do which she didn't have to think about too much be the one in berlin and you can't apply for that until april six months before you'd be due to start
S0041	well it's
S0084	yo i think she's apply for the one in stockholm she's just wait to hear and just as a sort of backup yeah it's all go okay
S0041	you don't get to hear from six till six months before you're due to start
S0084	you can't apply until six months before
S0041	really
S0084	pass i don't know what's go on there
S0041	that's a bite extreme isn't it
S0084	be your things on fire
S0041	only a little bite of black on the bottom
S0084	i'm fine i might need to try and leave work early tomorrow i might work and ask why big boss as i have no boss whether i can leave a two thirty and go and look at charity for burlesque costume
S0041	oh
S0084	yeah say she be look at corset online last night but i mean i could have tell her that they're really expensive
S0041	yeah erm and you can't get one this quickly now
S0084	seventy no so we're think some sort of erm net possibly with some sort of top i'm think charity or vintage shop for instance sort of feather you know big feather
S0041	yes feather
S0084	yeah
S0041	peacock feather peacock feather
S0084	yeah peacock feather i'm think of go all in black possibly you know maybe even some full length gloves if i can find them cos even if i find them on amazon or something you can get next day delivery so
S0041	yeah
S0084	i'm feel quite confident about that laura the girl whose birthday it be she send a message around to just the girls say i think it would be quite nice have a few drink before hand but erm i'm aware that we won't be wear many clothe so if you don't want to go into town just let me know and i'll organise drink at my house house cos we will be naked i speak to and say cos she hadn't speak to me since and say i'm not come out for your birthday
S0041	yeah
S0084	oh you have meet her from oh you know womble from new years eve
S0041	yeah
S0084	i think the birthday turn out to be some sort of double date so i'm quite glad that i didn't go
S0041	oh
S0084	cos basically and and womble and his new girlfriend it be the four of them so i'm quite glad that i didn't just rock up at like ten o'clock for one drink and then all the couple go home to shag because that would have be really depress
S0041	yeah
S0084	cos i think that strange little dj be suppose to go but i don't think he do so anyway i be feel a bite guilty and i mean to text her myself but she beat me to eat apparently she's book the flight for australia on saturday morning so i say i'll meet you in town at one which give me time to make the guinness cake in the morning i'm hop i'll be able to add to it tomorrow afternoon or at least gather an idea for something because i don't want to just try and find something on saturday and like it would be a real panic
S0041	mm yeah yeah no that would be bad
S0084	and that's what i'm worry about that's why i kind of just want to meet her in the afternoon in fact maybe i will just say that and be say about go for erm well for guinness basically
S0041	yeah
S0084	because it's saint patrick's day so i mean meet for a few bevies in the afternoon which could be dangerous because i'd have to factor in come home get change and put on the feather and the pant combo so
S0041	this look a good one
S0084	that look a perfect one
S0041	mm
S0084	what be you go to have in yours cheesy
S0041	er sugar and lemon juiceness
S0084	red and yellow and pink and green and orange and purple and all the colour
S0041	all the colour in the world ever
S0084	mm
S0041	er mm mm mm
S0084	er i wonder if maybe we should open the window and close the door
S0041	be we make smoke
S0084	i i couldn't see it before but i can see it now and that fire alarm be intense you do not want that to go off
S0041	yeah i don't really want to witness that if i'm honest
S0084	no i might cry i mean that would finish my brain off quite frankly yep i'm feel quite confident about that tomorrow cos there's load of charity shop on mill road aren't there so i can start with over there check those out and then go to the grafton centre cos there's load on that street
S0041	yeah
S0084	erm and then and then your above primark
S0041	yep
S0084	and the vintage shop
S0041	do you know the best place to go to for stuff like that would be camden market wouldn't it
S0084	right it would be bite of a trek camden market's really great because you can haggle which i quite like
S0041	yeah and they do load of stuff like that
S0084	they've get load of just random shit cos the thing be you don't want it to look cheap whatever it be you're wear that's probably it's quite cheap
S0041	yeah i saw load actually while i be there
S0084	do you
S0041	yeah i take a photograph of a blazer actually cos it be a very strange shop that erm do that type of gothic corset in a day type attire
S0084	mm mm
S0041	erm and also do a really amazingly tailor blazer i've get a photograph of it that i've download and i've never see anything like it it be amaze it's kind of get this bite that go across which make a lapel on one side but not on the other side it's really difficult to explain grey amaze
S0084	mm how much be it
S0041	it didn't have a price on it
S0084	ah pricey
S0041	yeah and it but the rest of the stuff in there be quite kind of around the forty pound mark so i don't think it would have be ridiculous
S0084	oh really
S0041	yeah
S0084	you weren't tempt
S0041	very tempt but potless it be before payday wasn't it
S0084	oh yeah
S0041	yeah and also it would have suit your figure but i think once you put boob in it or waist in it it would have look awful you need to have a nice petite frame cos it be really kind of smooth it be gorgeous i'll show you the picture
S0084	mm do you get the photos do from the camera be it alright on it didn't kill it
S0041	yes oh on your camera no i haven't try that yet i do get the ones that erm send that i cut on my email that i couldn't open i open it on firefox instead
S0084	oh good
S0041	ah ah ah get over yep you're do that
S0084	that's fine
S0041	that's fine
S0084	that's how it's suppose to go man
S0041	i'm try to think of a place you could go for for stuff like that what about erm well like h and m underwear i haven't be in there for years and years but i remember get a corset top from there once
S0084	h and m yeah possibly i mean there be lingerie shop obviously in abundance it's just find one that's affordable but i suppose once you've get one you've get one
S0041	yeah
S0084	and i would like a nice one there's triumph isn't there
S0041	yeah i be think that
S0084	or i could go in the lovely lingerie place in town and see if they've get a sale on erm le le reve
S0041	the one near the yeah
S0084	in it's beautiful i'll have a look in there but they've always get a ten pound bin it's just whether you could come up trump really erm
S0041	i think it will be a really fun night though
S0084	it should be really good should be i think the music's go to be quite good and there's cabaret act which be always quite fun and like a drag queen compère and it i mean it should be a good crack i think i'm quite look forward to it i think erm i almost have this moment where i don't want to go people that i don't know it's go to be a bite of an effort know
S0041	yeah i always think that
S0084	i don't know who's go to be there and but then you go and you have a good time so it's like force myself to go
S0041	yeah you go and you think why be i yeah
S0084	mm so i think i will force myself i mean the thing be even if you go and you leave by midnight at least you've go and you've be out and you've meet people and be sociable so erm
S0041	yeah yeah and you always have more fun than you think you you think you will i think you kind of hype it up a bite in your head don't you to be a bite difficult and

S0084	mm mm mm
S0041	to drive thirty five minutes this morning
S0084	god thirty five minutes
S0041	i didn't have to be at work till ten so it should have be after rush hour traffic
S0084	mm mm
S0041	oh i just no i just can't deal with it
S0084	it drive you mad
S0041	just no just no
S0084	mm
S0041	it be a yeah it be a definite killer and then on the way back from the doctor i go to thank you i go to the erm doctor at mid day cos on on the way to work i
S0084	mm oh do you
S0041	yeah i drive via the surgery and just explain and say oh if you come back at twelve you can sit and wait
S0084	okay
S0041	but if you come just before twelve you'll be the first one to check in so you won't have to wait okay thank
S0084	i'll be here for that then
S0041	i'll be here for that
S0084	oh of course cos that's when they say that you'd have to go to hospital
S0041	mm erm on the way back some guy cos you know it merge there's two lanes doesn't it that merge into one on
S0084	oh yeah it fuck me off
S0041	and at the very end you get to the point where you have to give one give one give one give
S0084	mm mm mm
S0041	he wasn't go to give one he wasn't go to let me in and i be like fuck that and he merc in before me
S0084	mm
S0041	he get this little punto and erm teenage guy
S0084	so you're in the leave or the right
S0041	i'm in the leave
S0084	mm
S0041	so i'd let like the car in front of me have go and the one before have let him in
S0084	mm mm mm
S0041	so i'd let the big merc in
S0084	mm
S0041	and then punto put his foot down i think he can fuck off so i put literally pull so far forward that the merc could have possibly scratch my car cos he be i be still like my bonnet be the full length of his boot and pull my car the wrong way so that punto couldn't move
S0084	mm mm
S0041	and he just look at me and i go tada
S0041	and this teenage boy be like
S0084	i would have be so fuck off that road really piss me off because there's no i don't understand why there's two lanes there's no reason apart from obviously when you come off the east er into roundabout you've get two lanes by the court because one be to turn leave into
S0041	yeah
S0084	fine at that point filter it down into one
S0041	from the traffic light
S0084	from the traffic light but because you've get that whole stretch and then it filter at at the next set of traffic light everyone get fuck off
S0041	yep yep and nobody turn into down the down past that heart thing you know you can go across the carriageway can't you the bus go there
S0084	yeah
S0041	there's nobody every go down there apart from there apart from bus so there's no reason that shouldn't be a bus lane
S0084	mm yeah absolutely although when i be in the queue this morning it we'd i'd stop before like the british heart foundation furniture shop and there be a some sort of white lorry come out of where the entrance to the cinema be
S0041	mm
S0084	and he pull out and it obviously the traffic be come from that direction because we'd stop and for that traffic that stop so he know we be about to move and he pull out and what should have happen be we're all queue here and his road be here he pull out up here
S0041	that's so bad
S0084	i'm like what the fuck do you think you're do
S0041	yeah
S0084	and then he start nestle in so basically the same thing he be bumper to bumper literally touch the van in front so that he could sneak in
S0041	mm
S0084	oh man if that have be me i would have go absolutely ape shit
S0041	yeah
S0084	absolutely mental
S0041	i'm laugh because that's something i would do
S0084	that be something you would do i know it be and i would go mental because i think oh i'm go to do it the right way and get really angry with everyone who doesn't do it the right way
S0041	yeah
S0084	but then i think why don't i just do it the wrong way and then i'd be there quicker
S0041	mm that's me i do awful things like that okay i'm go
S0084	my speed in city's a bite of an issue as well because i really put me foot down
S0041	mm
S0084	because obviously by now i know where the speed cameras be
S0041	yeah
S0084	but you just don't know like someone at work get catch go down the other day
S0041	really
S0084	cos you know it's twenty now yeah they've change it the put sign on to twenty miles an hour now they've change it probably about six months ago
S0041	the whole thing
S0084	yeah the length of it all of well i'm pretty sure it's all the way down but it's certainly from town end definitely past the bridge it's twenty
S0041	no i do not know that i bomb down there on the way back from the sun bed
S0084	right okay well there's quite a lot sign i mean there's sign but the thing be i don't think speed be that big they're quite consider it's tell you how fast you're suppose to be drive you'd think they'd be massive
S0041	mm well i've stop look now if i'm honest maybe because i've be down that road so often erm
S0084	don't expect it to change yeah well that's it erm but yeah someone at work get catch the other day get fin eighty quid for speed
S0041	wow
S0084	well they be do thirty over their sign and i think well it's always be thirty up until a few months ago so if you've always drive it at thirty you're not go to
S0041	yeah you wouldn't question it would you
S0084	you're not really go to look
S0041	and the worst thing be on as well there's so many cyclists like that's a shit i'm terrify to drive down there in case i kill someone
S0084	mm yeah
S0041	you're not look at this road sign you're look at all the people
S0084	so and because the roads be so narrow people just walk out on the off the pavement
S0041	on the ward on the road yeah
S0084	and that's that i nearly run my colleague over this morning actually he'd i be on because i come obviously come down and then turn onto and erm he overtake another cyclist so he come out of the cycle line on but come out into the road as i be go past and erm i be about to honk the horn and then i realise it be him and i be like
S0084	cos isn't it you know it's horrible when you're cycle and the cars beep at you you know you get really like oh my god
S0041	i nearly die
S0084	my heart's in my mouth
S0041	i think i'm do
S0084	yeah no i think you have to eat the last one
S0041	i don't think i can fit it in i feel a bite sick
S0084	tough no actually may maybe maybe not
S0041	i like just leave it move it in the fridge and then if i feel the need i might heat it up later
S0084	yeah that sound like an absolute winner erm so aqua fit be half six to half seven
S0041	half six to half seven yeah
S0084	so we could be home by eight
S0041	yes i would say by the latest quarter past but probably eight
S0084	okay probably eight my dad want to go out for dinner tomorrow night but he doesn't get home from the shop till seven
S0041	well we can make sure just think the drive back be about ten minutes
S0084	mm
S0041	i can just quick be quick change
S0084	quick quick shower mm
S0041	be quick showerers
S0084	yeah yeah in and out we could be at my dad's for eight yeah eight fifteen even that yeah that sound fine maybe i could just try and see him at the weekend the weekend's pretty busy though
S0041	yeah you sound a bite book up book up for the weekend
S0084	well i'm suppose to be see on friday for gym and jar jar of beer
S0041	gym and gym er gym and beer

S0041	i like gym and beer go together
S0084	the two go hand in hand mm but that's if he finish on time but i'm definitely go to go to the gym after work whether he come or not and then so i'll probably drive and then come home on friday we'll see
S0041	one thing the doctor do say be yes swim keep it move
S0084	oh good okay so at least you know
S0041	yep
S0084	do he say that the willy might have grow because of the exercise
S0041	no the willy will do what it want basically
S0084	it's always go to just go to grow of it's own accord oh
S0041	should have go but keep it move so that's that
S0084	oh man so when do you have to call them back by
S0041	this time next week
S0084	oh right so it's not a week after the accident it's a week from now
S0041	the doctor's
S0084	if the willy hasn't go down say within a few days
S0041	i have a week from now for willy
S0084	a week from now
S0041	erm cos he measure measure willy today it be so funny
S0084	he actually measure it
S0041	yeah and like i be like okay so you're go to want to see this he be like yeah i say okay so i'm go to take my tights down so you can see the full potential of the bulge because i feel like my tights hold it in he be okay then he say if you just want to turn around while i just get the tight down because it's really not that graceful
S0084	oh mm
S0041	erm he say okay before you do do you want me to get a nurse in here so it's not just the two of us cos i mean he's a guy and i be like oh no i don't care
S0084	mm
S0041	erm totally be eye up my bum though by the way
S0084	the doctor
S0041	yeah i saw his eye he be obviously truly try not to but he kind of go cos i be he'd like measure my willy of course so i'm like stand there with my my dress around my waist pant galore
S0084	yeah as you do yeah yeah
S0041	erm obviously choose the good pant because i know i be go to have to get them out
S0084	absolutely
S0041	erm and so he measure the willy so the guy's kneel at crotch level measure my willy with the tape measure
S0084	mm
S0041	and then afterwards i'm talk away to him while i'm put my put my tights up and pull them up but obviously pull them up mean my dress be now around my waist so i can pull my tights up i mean he be totally cop a look
S0084	be he
S0041	yeah you could tell he be like look at me and then he be just like
S0084	oh my god
S0041	i think it be more an embarrassment of don't look don't look shit i look like that
S0084	i know i know that's hilarious
S0041	it be so funny
S0084	although people just do it all the time i mean i find that i stare at women's boob all the time because i can't help because i think i don't have boob like that like what must it be like
S0041	yeah i stare at stomach
S0084	do you
S0041	yep all the time especially i think it must look so bad because it's usually you know teenage girls they wear like the hipsters and you can see the the kind of this much midriff i can't help it i just stare at it
S0084	yeah the midriff mm
S0041	i think that just must look so bad
S0084	well i suppose better than star at their boob like i do
S0041	yeah
S0084	although be say he think that women stare at his crotch all the time and i be say i don't think they do i think that's wishful think that's you've forget the difference between dream time and real time
S0041	yeah real time
S0084	and you've get a bite confuse he say no no no i walk down the street and they
S0041	i've never look at women's crotches men's crotches
S0084	you just wouldn't would you why i mean unless they're wear super tight trousers and we're not live in the nineteen seventies so
S0041	yeah and usually you'd go for bum rather than frontness
S0084	yeah always bum although i'm quite partial to a man's erm shoulder and neck area that really get me
S0041	favourite favourite so how sad we actually be erm and i this you now
S0084	yeah
S0041	i have a i have a thing about back
S0084	yeah
S0041	not just the whole shoulder neck area like the whole back
S0084	mm mm
S0041	and erm there's a clip in just friends film at the end when he take his top off and and i freeze it press pause so he's just this perfect back be the screen saver for the tv for the day
S0041	and people be come around and say what's that it's just the screen saver but that's the television yeah so we press pause what of it perfect back
S0084	that's a bite peculiar must say that i've never hear of that one before girls
S0041	yeah but we might have accidentally do that for the day
S0084	who's pay the electricity bill
S0041	what
S0084	bet you be their favourite tenant actually what with the whole what like turn the oven on when you get really cold
S0041	yeah yeah we do that yeah
S0084	yeah
S0041	and just open all the compartments of it
S0084	yeah that's not normal it's put it out there
S0041	yeah
S0084	that's not what normal people do
S0041	yeah they get a bite obsess by yeah i'm definitely more of a back back person
S0084	what be she make that smell wrong
S0041	i've no idea we'd best wash that pan
S0084	yeah she make death
S0041	death i would never look at a guy's crotch never
S0084	no i've never hear of that one i think it's all just wishful think
S0041	yep that's the truth of the matter
S0084	pancakes pancakes
S0041	although i be think today after the whole doctor cop look at you
S0084	mm
S0041	i mean i i be get a i have get my arse out really so
S0084	mm
S0041	poor poor bloke couldn't really do anything else but look
S0084	mm mm
S0041	erm i kind of get quite excite which make me sound awful about how i'm go to maybe in about two months
S0084	mm
S0041	we're hop for less than that because birthday's in less than that
S0084	mm
S0041	have more of a hot bod i'm totally go to utilise this to my advantage
S0084	have a hot bod
S0041	because i've never do it before i've never have a hot bod before
S0084	have a hot mm
S0041	cos when i be smaller than this
S0084	mm
S0041	the last time i be ever smaller than this be when i be twenty one
S0084	mm
S0041	but my fit my shape be different it wasn't tone so i still felt really uncomfortable skin
S0084	oh well i don't know what how people do it i've never have that confidence but i suppose you know once you have start work out and you can see a difference that's confidence that's go to give you confidence in itself isn't it
S0041	yeah like even when i be in italy the least i go out in be the little dungarees
S0084	oh yeah
S0041	i do have a a sheer shirt on underneath
S0084	but i mean you have get quite a level of confidence already haven't you if you think about you know sexy top and skirt
S0041	the sexy top and skirt be a very new thing
S0084	it's very very very lovely very risky i mean i would never wear it i mean cos obviously you know you put it on and you feel good you know you look hot so
S0041	but i didn't even wear stuff like that when i be eighteen
S0084	really well i think the confidence do come with age though doesn't it
S0041	no
S0084	it get to a point where i think you sort of well fuck it
S0041	yeah do you know what i realise the other day i be i can't remember how i how my brain get on to that point but erm say to me i can't believe your next birthday's twenty five i know it sound like a substantial age and i don't any different to where i be when i be eighteen really
S0084	mm mm mm mm
S0041	well i do but not compare to say twenty
S0084	yeah
S0041	i say but twenty five sound like a a serious age yeah
S0084	serious birthday mm
S0041	she say yeah it's a bite of a right of passage isn't it and i say you know when you be a kid and you though about twenty five you'd be get to get marry and stuff
S0084	have yeah baby
S0041	baby yep all that
S0084	own a house
S0041	yep all that cack
S0084	have a career
S0041	erm and i say oh i think you know things be just different now you don't people who be twenty five in this generation won't won't have the same type of lifestyle of people of ten twenty five or ten years ago
S0084	mm
S0041	erm but i realise i still compare myself you know if you be
S0041	no that's okay
S0041	you know when you go when i see picture of girls or i see other girls on the street you know you kind of compare yourself to them or if i see myself naked and worry about the wrinkle and stuff before
S0084	mm
S0041	i still compare myself to girls who be eighteen
S0084	right like no you can't do that though
S0041	well i know but i do and i only realise it this week
S0084	mm
S0041	like my think of you know be naked with the guy
S0084	mm
S0041	my ideal in what he's expect
S0041	mm
S0041	be an eighteen year old body
S0084	mm
S0041	when really there's not a cat in hells chance
S0084	well you no exactly you can't compare yourself that even if actually all men would prefer an eighteen year old body i or if you think that they do i don't think that they do because ultimately an eighteen year old doesn't know what to do with their body anyway
S0041	well yeah that's true
S0084	there be no womanly bits to it you know it's not go to be attractive for them really you don't know what you're do at that age so
S0041	move my head that's it
S0084	oh mate well no wonder crazy girl
S0041	it's a bite weird innit
S0084	i mean you just i think you get to the point where you think where you think there's no point be hard on yourself like everyone would rather be a bite taller a bite shorter a bite fatter a bite skinnier
S0041	yeah have always say that she's come back with my legs and i say that's okay i'll come back with your belly
S0084	well there you go you see when i i mean apart from i mean even people who think that appear to be confident aren't they're just put on a front you just have to it's about find a body that you're comfortable in that's you know
S0041	yeah
S0084	healthy and that you can be satisfy with
S0084	no aren't you
S0041	that's seven years ago
S0084	but you can't do that no
S0041	seven years ago
S0084	you're a maniac
S0041	in head it's only about three minutes ago
S0084	well no well look this be it because i always think of myself as twenty one
S0041	yep
