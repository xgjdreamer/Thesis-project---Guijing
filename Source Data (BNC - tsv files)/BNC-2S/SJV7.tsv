S0529	well i mean er we shouldn't know why they do it cos it make absolutely no sense to anyone who have you know be
S0530	cos i try look into it last night like
S0530	what sort of logic be there to this like
S0529	mm
S0530	what what do you they plan to achieve with it
S0529	yeah
S0530	and basically it's like everyone should be muslim on earth and that something and i can't even remember yeah they believe that i'd not actually consider this but like i've hear people like talk about it on the internet like people like do you do you reckon like whether say like feel quite nervous be around like people that be non muslim right now in case we have prejudice against him
S0529	probably
S0530	because
S0529	yeah
S0530	yeah
S0529	i mean actually like i speak to him yesterday and i didn't tell i didn't like talk to him about the paris attack
S0530	no neither do i
S0529	even though i've be speak to most people i've see about the paris attack cos it's like you know
S0530	mm
S0529	a topic of conversation or whatever
S0530	yeah
S0529	but no i didn't i say like i didn't think about oh i'd better not say anything to him he might be quite you know sensitive about it i just didn't think like i just didn't
S0530	yeah
S0529	but yeah i wonder how he feel about it yeah i hope he doesn't think that people be gonna judge him because
S0530	no not
S0529	i don't think they would here cos i feel like this be quite an accept place
S0530	you'd think so
S0529	i mean we have a lot of international students here and i'm not say he's an international student but i'm just say like the tolerance level here seem to be you know higher than
S0530	yeah definitely
S0529	than it might be
S0530	like most place
S0529	somewhere else yeah but no it would be interest to see what he think about the whole isis thing
S0530	i can imagine he'd feel quite angry
S0529	yeah yeah i don't think i'd wanna ask him about it to be honest i just i like think it would be a bite rude
S0530	yeah er i mean only if it come up in conversation or he
S0529	yeah
S0530	chip in himself like
S0529	mm
S0530	but i wouldn't directly say hey what do you think of the
S0529	no
S0530	probably wouldn't do down very well
S0529	do you know what time the shop shut
S0530	the shop shut like at eleven
S0529	oh okay i've get age
S0530	you've get age

S0529	dunno
S0530	kind of like yeah
S0529	like when she be try to convince me to go she be talk about how like the only reason she like her uni be because of the people she'd meet and that she doesn't really like the way it's teach because it's really bad there and they don't pay attention to
S0530	the welfare of the students
S0529	the students no not at all
S0530	yeah
S0529	cos they're just all about you know the money and the prestige that now have like it's kind of like this new money thing they've get go
S0530	mm
S0529	cos they're kind of newly group erm and they're sort of erm they're in the spotlight now
S0530	mm
S0529	which they weren't before so they be just use it and they're just use all the students to you know churn out success but not actually care at all about
S0530	yeah
S0529	their welfare like you say
S0530	i mean
S0529	erm
S0530	yeah
S0529	yeah
S0530	i i've get i tell you about my friend that's there at the moment do english call
S0529	yeah
S0530	i actually ask if she know your sister and she do
S0529	she do oh wow
S0530	she say
S0530	she's head of your sister
S0529	yeah she be yeah she and
S0530	so
S0529	her friend like reinstate it when they be in first year like it wasn't a thing like it be now
S0530	okay
S0529	like they kind of have
S0530	they make a
S0529	a renaissance
S0530	vamp it up
S0529	yeah
S0530	that's cool
S0529	erm which be really cool and they have load of interview with like proper magazines and like
S0530	wow
S0529	they be in cosmo last year
S0530	really
S0529	which be cool yeah
S0530	that's amaze
S0529	and they've have katie hopkins there they've have load of like
S0530	what at their uni
S0529	important people yeah to do
S0530	wow
S0529	to have like debate with and interview and stuff like that yeah i'm really proud of her for that
S0530	god
S0529	she and her friend be like no this be not good enough like we need to improve this and they get like a whole group of girls together to
S0530	that's really good
S0529	to make it what it be now and now it's like really really popular
S0530	oh awesome
S0529	and i'm so proud of them yeah yeah
S0530	but yeah erm the girl that be there she'd get she's get several like mental health problems and
S0529	mm
S0530	she's suffer so much
S0529	yeah
S0530	with the workload as well
S0529	yeah
S0530	because of everything and it's really sad because it sound like the way i mean she's be put on like she's get such so many roles and responsibility like part of her problem be that she just she just take too much on so she do like she's like head writer of one of the magazines there and everything
S0529	yeah
S0530	yeah so it's just like and it's like they don't see like she need a break kind of thing you know like she they need to maybe keep an eye on her and help her
S0529	mm
S0530	because she really do like i mean like i they just don't know the half of it really they just see like professionals that be in a professional environment like these hard work students
S0529	mm
S0530	when actually behind it all it's not always
S0529	they're really struggle
S0530	yeah yeah definitely
S0529	mm no it's just it's mess up like when you put it together like the figure of the amount of people our age who who be suffer with mental health problems or you know any personal thing like that
S0530	yeah it's huge
S0529	and when you like put it together with a university that's the cause of it all the time it's just they need to just look at that and think
S0530	definitely
S0529	oh we're not do we're we're not do enough here to help people
S0530	like despite our parent say they have the same problems at our age they really didn't
S0529	no
S0530	they didn't think the same
S0529	it's different
S0530	it be completely different
S0529	this generation be way more aware we're way more socially aware we be way more like we're more deep thinkers
S0530	yeah we're more reflective people
S0529	yeah
S0530	in general
S0529	yeah which be
S0530	to be honest
S0529	sometimes a bad thing i get that but
S0530	it's yeah
S0529	but most of the time
S0530	it can be a good thing
S0529	yeah cos it mean that we actually question things that we that maybe our parent didn't erm i think we have more of a capacity to change things
S0530	we're less passive with what we
S0529	yes definitely
S0530	yeah definitely yeah
S0529	but no on the whole i think we're a more kind of depress
S0530	yeah
S0529	generation
S0530	we really be like i mean
S0529	i mean that as like an umbrella term cos i feel like be depress come under all mental health problems really like
S0530	yeah i mean it's a symptom yeah
S0529	it's almost kind of a side effect isn't it yeah
S0530	of every single one pretty much like it's just crazy like how many people i know that have be to like counsellors or
S0529	mm
S0530	have be in hospital because of mental illness
S0529	yeah
S0530	and stuff and it's really sad
S0529	it be
S0530	like like even in the last decade it's just be a huge increase like
S0529	mm
S0530	obviously like when you be in primary school you're not really aware of these things so you don't really know but i swear like people seem to actually enjoy be teenagers then like when we be like in year six
S0529	mm
S0530	like there be there be probably still like you know a lot of pressure but i think i don't think people like teachers can't remember as many students break down over their exams and shit like
S0529	mm
S0530	it seem to be quite common to have anxiety attack before exams now it's very normal
S0529	mm
S0530	when i don't that use to be the case
S0529	i think also it's because we have more kind of understand of mental illness
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	and there's less i mean the stigma hasn't go at all like i'm not suggest that but
S0530	mm
S0529	people have definitely become more aware of it
S0530	definitely
S0529	yeah
S0530	i feel like i honestly like i know i think like i be depress a few years ago i really didn't actually know the depth of it until like
S0529	mm
S0530	this year
S0529	yeah
S0530	i know that sound really strange but like
S0529	doesn't sound strange it's like i don't really get the
S0530	yeah
S0529	thing of not really know that you be depress
S0530	mm
S0529	cos it's like you've deal with it for so long that you can just sort of
S0530	yeah
S0529	start to think that it's just what you're like
S0530	i mean i have like it be quite weird this time because like last time i kind of know what happen because obviously like physically i be bad and obviously like
S0529	mm
S0530	a side effect of anorexia actually be like so it's to like be depress because of your lack of nutrients to the brain and shit
S0529	yeah
S0530	so that be like sort of like whatsit it be a reactive depression
S0529	mm
S0530	whereas this be like everything physically be fine
S0529	yeah
S0530	and it be really scary because i didn't know why it happen like i be do so well before christmas and then it be just like after christmas overnight it be almost just like whoa you know and it be like i don't even know why or what's go on and i think when you can't pinpoint why this have happen like why now it's so scary because you just don't know how to go about
S0529	yeah
S0530	treat it except with medication obviously if it
S0529	about your eat disorder cos my friend like she have trouble with it and then it sort of come back and
S0530	yeah
S0529	do you feel like yours have ever
S0530	i feel like
S0529	like resurface
S0530	it's change in a way like if feel like in my head like to be honest like mentally i still feel the same i just have to do whatever the opposite of it say
S0529	mm
S0530	like i have to just like cos sometimes it be just so tempt to backslide like it's so difficult
S0529	that's so strong
S0530	but like it's just like you know what's gonna happen if you do like you can and i don't wanna end up back where i be because it's such a miserable life like
S0529	yeah
S0530	it can almost feel safer because part of the not the appeal cos that sound a bite like mm a bite but part of like the reason why a lot of people like end up kind of stick relapse again be because it kind of numb everything like
S0529	mm
S0530	you kind of just shut down like your whole body and it kind of just like give you this like
S0529	it must give you like control as well
S0530	oh definitely like you can totally like shut yourself down from anything negative and also like i think a big part of it as well be like when nobody when you have like when you're at a low way and when you have to drop out of everything nobody expect anything from you
S0529	mm
S0530	like you're not expect to function like a normal human and people understand that you've get something like mentally wrong with you
S0529	mm
S0530	whereas if you're kind of like i dunno if you're just like help yourself like if you're like at a healthy weight and you're like stuff it's just like do you know what i mean
S0529	mm yeah
S0530	mm it's yeah it be it be difficult because to be honest like some days be better than others like some days it's like doesn't even affect me really but then other days particularly when it's hard it's like the best way i'd describe it would be like it's like try to fuel a but it's like you see it as try to fuel a car that's already like break like dead
S0529	mm
S0530	like there's no point almost you know like that's the way i see it personally like it's different for everybody but that's for me but yeah how be your friend that's
S0529	she's okay now yeah
S0530	that's good
S0529	i mean this be the one
S0530	that's good
S0529	that's have other issue at the moment but
S0530	okay yeah
S0529	no like the eat disorder be kind of hasn't resurface for like a year or two so
S0530	that's good
S0529	yeah
S0530	that's good
S0529	and it be just with it be in reaction to her dad get cancer so i suppose
S0530	oh no
S0529	yeah that make sense to
S0530	wow
S0529	have some sort of reaction to it and that's just what happen but no she's okay now
S0530	that's good
S0529	yeah
S0530	that's good
S0529	i mean it's just it's horrible to watch like from the outside
S0530	no do you see her when she be ill then
S0529	mm
S0530	and then all throughout it all
S0529	i remember see my sister and her friend have it too like it's just
S0530	your sister
S0529	mm
S0530	really
S0529	yeah for a time it wasn't as bad as like
S0530	oh that's really sad
S0529	as what it could have be because like she kind of realise earlier like right this be bad and then she go and get sort and it never really like affect her like it could have do but it be just horrible to see her so
S0530	how old be your sister when this happen like
S0529	erm it i be in first year of college so like three years ago
S0530	okay
S0529	so not not long ago but basically she be like work all summer and she just get really thin and everyone be worry about her and she wouldn't go and talk to anyone and she just wasn't talk to anyone and
S0530	be she not eat deliberately kind of thing or be it just like a
S0529	yeah she wasn't eat deliberately like
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	i mean she never tell us that but i kind of know that
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	because i dunno i feel like i know her
S0529	enough to know that
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	i don't know but no she go to the doctor's and get it sort thankfully but her friend be worse
S0530	oh really
S0529	mm
S0530	be her friend ill at the same time
S0529	er no before no that's horrible like the fact that her friend be like that and then be like that
S0530	mm
S0529	no her friend have to go into like a clinic for age
S0530	really
S0529	mm
S0530	oh my god
S0529	which be annoy cos in there be no clinics so she have to go to i think it be or somewhere in anyway
S0530	oh god
S0529	yeah
S0530	yeah i know people like that go to my clinic come from like everywhere
S0530	yeah
S0529	because
S0530	no it's that island you know when you
S0529	no no i know it's an island
S0530	yeah
S0529	be it like a be it like a
S0530	no
S0529	close island
S0530	no
S0529	oh
S0530	they have to be get impatient and they get the plane
S0529	bloody hell
S0529	crazy
S0530	you have to yeah they have to fly over here it's it's a bite mad but yeah
S0529	if i live in an island
S0530	yeah we do
S0529	i mean we do live on on an island yeah
S0530	it's very pretty isle of man
S0529	it would be nice if
S0530	oh that would be nice to
S0529	mm
S0530	just shut be shut off of everything
S0529	so i didn't know
S0530	from everywhere
S0529	that the isles of scilly be only like thirty miles from cornwall i think it be like further up country
S0530	oh my be it
S0529	this be how bad i be at geography
S0530	oh my no i don't know
S0529	no
S0530	i don't know anything about geography
S0529	no apparently you can get the ferry from penzance to to isles of scilly and it take like
S0530	oh my gosh
S0529	forty minutes or something
S0530	wow
S0529	it's just ridiculous and i've never be i wish i have
S0530	that's crazy oh oh it's sometimes really hard for people like with it's really er i dunno like it's very difficult to kind of look back at people that i know from when i be in treatment
S0529	mm
S0530	and see them do badly because i
S0529	be be you in contact with most of them
S0530	yeah i'm in contact quite a lot like
S0529	yeah
S0530	some of them like i'm really close friends with and thankfully some of them be do like really well
S0529	yeah
S0530	but then others just like keep end up back in hospital and
S0529	no it's sad
S0530	it's just like a constant cycle
S0529	yeah
S0530	and it's just i dunno it's really sad to see that like they should be just out live their live
S0529	yeah
S0530	and it's like like someone i know be like they be in inpatient for like three years like nonstop
S0529	wow
S0530	like how can that even happen
S0529	how be that even allow like
S0530	yeah
S0529	that's
S0530	i mean some people aren't allow out
S0529	well i suppose cos it's not nhs though be it so you could just stay for an extend time
S0530	the thing be they get put on a section
S0529	yeah
S0530	which mean they can't be
S0529	yeah until they're like
S0530	mm
S0529	legally able to leave or something yeah
S0530	yeah
S0529	but you weren't you weren't section be you
S0530	no i wasn't
S0529	no
S0530	section
S0529	you go voluntarily
S0530	i didn't want to get well
S0529	no i don't think anybody want to get section
S0530	obviously like i dunno i be like i'm not get section because apparently like it could i think one of the reason i didn't want i i go in willingly because i know that if you get section it can like stop you from do things
S0529	yeah
S0530	as well
S0529	it go on your record like it's
S0530	yeah it's
S0529	it's like a criminal record
S0530	yeah basically
S0529	which be horrible really cos it's not your fault like most of the time when people be section it's for their own safety
S0530	mm
S0529	it's not like they you know be try to help anyone else but still you get
S0530	yeah
S0529	you know punish for it
S0530	i know
S0529	it's really bad
S0530	i wonder apparently some of them can like stop you from do things like work with children and stuff
S0529	mm yeah
S0530	but it's like i don't understand like if you've have an eat disorder like i can understand for a paedophile or if you're
S0529	yeah
S0530	if you've like get an experience of be violent with children totally if you just don't eat i don't understand
S0529	yeah
S0530	do you know what i mean or eat funny or
S0529	i reckon cos i watch this louis theroux programme about like mental
S0530	mm
S0529	health hospital like instead of a prison like so these people be kind of like sentence but they be mentally ill so they be take to a hospital instead of a prison and most of them be like severely schizophrenic or you know mentally disturb and like you know
S0530	yeah
S0529	try to kill
S0530	yeah
S0529	people because they think that be what they have to do and things like that but i think all the general stuff like eat disorder
S0530	yeah depression anxiety
S0529	or depression all those sort of things that you'd be a danger to yourself would have you'd probably
S0530	mm
S0529	would still be able to do like job
S0530	yeah exactly
S0529	er you know once once you be out there and stuff
S0530	cos i know people like that have like when they say though like you can get section people i know there it treat also erm schizophrenia
S0529	mm
S0530	and it's like some people who have schizophrenia do have impulses in their head to hurt other people but others be like you've gotta do this or say your mum's gonna die or
S0529	mm
S0530	you have to like walk back and forth or else something's gonna happen but it's not always violent
S0529	no
S0530	and people don't understand that like they think it's like hear voice but it's actually like a it's like everyone use like addictions and things in the same way it just kind of translate differently into people's brain
S0529	mm
S0530	it's very similar
S0529	i think schizophrenia be like one of the worst
S0530	yeah it cos you literally
S0529	i i just can't imagine like
S0530	no yeah
S0529	be it would just be awful you feel so sorry for them ostracise
S0530	yeah definitely
S0529	more than they do with other mental health and like people can like glamorise mental health a little bite
S0530	oh god
S0529	and it's always the ones that get glamorise be always eat disorder always depression always anxiety those be the three
S0530	mm
S0529	and then you get all the other ones that be a bite more kind of like people don't like talk about them because they're a bite more
S0530	exactly
S0529	you know like yeah
S0530	like things like borderline personality disorder
S0529	yeah
S0530	erm what else just
S0529	yeah just cos they have the potential to be more dangerous and
S0530	yeah they're almost villainised you know
S0529	yeah they really be yeah
S0530	and if you're like erm
S0529	and it's horrible
S0530	be it sociopath
S0529	sociopath yeah
S0530	yeah
S0529	yeah oh i have more in my bank account than i think i do that's good

S0529	regardless of her of her gender like sorry but

S0529	i hate that shop it's so expensive
S0530	it be expensive
S0529	it's like it's a student shop and it's suppose to be cheaper that's the point of student shop
S0530	no
S0529	it's like our co op
S0530	it's not
S0529	at be
S0529	like ten percent cheaper than your average co op

S0529	it really do yeah not good
S0530	oh dear
S0529	be there like a politics club then
S0530	er should be
S0529	mm
S0530	there'll be a like a i think they just have the political party here
S0529	yeah
S0530	i think
S0529	yeah cos i i expect there's like a an actual society for politics
S0529	economics and the other one
S0530	mm
S0529	like the ppe or whatever it be
S0530	mm
S0529	what's the other p philosophy no
S0530	philosophy
S0529	er politics economics and something you know what do
S0530	oh god what
S0529	what's that call
S0530	ah something i can't remember
S0529	mm i don't know
S0530	international relations
S0529	oh it could be yeah pp no pi i don't know anyway
S0530	we know what we're talk about
S0529	you know that
S0529	they probably have a society for that
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	but expect everyone to be part of
S0530	i really want to join the i forget about the animal care one but they don't seem to be
S0529	oh
S0530	organise any trip soon
S0529	no it doesn't even
S0530	the only reason i want to go be to do the animal sanctuary
S0529	yeah oh yeah the problem with them be that they're just so like small and they don't really have a lot of fund so they can't do all this fun stuff that you'd want to do
S0530	exactly
S0529	yeah i dunno i just when societies i just think be a bite unless they're like big societies that have lot of people in them they're just a little bite lame really cos they're not you know you don't do anything much cos none of you can afford it like
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	cos it's such a small society
S0530	mm
S0529	i mean it's pretty bad really cos that that survey thing everyone seem to have have one at least and it be like oh shit
S0530	mm
S0529	i don't have any
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	i say to them like i read a lot but i don't even do that

S0530	cos they're not gonna how big be your seminar group
S0529	i have no idea i have no idea how big they be
S0529	probably quite small since it's like a small course and just the fact that i haven't hand in that essay make it even more awkward i don't know what to do ah

S0530	oh
S0529	do i just say that or do i just go
S0530	yeah just say that that's enough
S0529	yeah i don't care about the pleasantries to be honest

S0530	you see that be like you you just get squish
S0529	thank
S0530	but it's not your fault
S0530	you just happen to be the squish raspberry
S0529	mm
S0530	some raspberries have it better than other raspberries however that raspberry
S0530	that raspberry can do really well in life
S0529	yeah
S0530	he can overcome his depression
S0529	he'll just ace it so
S0530	oh god that no this one there
S0530	i be refer to he be not dead
S0529	which this one
S0530	yeah no don't eat him no
S0530	that raspberry can overcome his battle he can go to his lecture and pass his english degree yes he can because he be mr raspberry and i'm just gonna give up with the analogy
S0529	yeah i think
S0530	because
S0529	you should now
S0530	it be really motivational i'm really disappoint
S0529	it be why be they spell holland with an e
S0530	hollande
S0529	hollande
S0530	i think it's a name actually francis hollande
S0529	oh oh god i'm so stupid
S0530	francois
S0529	no but that's not spell with an e there
S0530	because they've probably spell it wrong
S0529	what be they chat
S0530	cos his name's french so they've just might have put an e on the end of it that's probably right
S0529	oh well this be useful i'm try to be like interest in it i just need to take an interest in news
S0530	it's like it's difficult for where to where to start
S0529	i know
S0530	when it come politics and all of that
S0529	i need to look at what isis be actually about cos i really don't know
S0530	what be isis about because we don't actually know do we
S0529	no i can't fuck type
S0530	do anybody know
S0529	jesus christ there we go woah that be stressful
S0530	very stressful
S0529	let's do the guardian cos i quite like the guardian and
S0530	the truth about isis be much worse this be a very negative article
S0529	oh they just look scary
S0530	they really do like how many people be part of isis
S0529	it's like all over again that sort of image there
S0530	do you think we're gonna have a third world war
S0529	mm i think this be it i think we're just not acknowledge it in the same way that we have before because people be really self centre
S0530	yeah
S0529	and it's not affect us you know like it's not affect england particularly
S0530	well it be technically war isn't it like
S0529	yeah we're at war definitely like load of countries be at war and if england be to get involve if say they come and drop bomb like on us too like they just do with france then it would be a world war pretty much
S0530	yeah
S0529	you know cos america would get involve they're our ally and all the european countries would get involve yeah it technically would be
S0530	that be so scary
S0529	and that would be scary wouldn't it
S0530	shit like oh god i can't even imagine
S0529	mm
S0530	like if you put it like that cos it's easy to think we're so like shelter here but
S0529	yeah
S0530	we're really not
S0529	no not at all
S0530	like
S0529	we're like one of the worst target
S0530	be we
S0529	we be like threat level like the highest threat level for terrorism at the moment
S0530	our country i think you mean
S0529	mm
S0530	and i be like
S0529	well yeah
S0530	shit
S0529	severe
S0530	severe
S0529	mm mm
S0530	brilliant
S0529	this mean that a terrorist strike be highly likely
S0530	moderate it
S0529	and ireland be severe huh
S0530	moderate in great britain but when be that last update
S0529	i dunno yeah so for the whole of the uk it's severe northern ireland be severe but then it say northern ireland in britain moderate that make no sense
S0530	why don't you type in how many people make up isis because i don't know i'm confuse because it can't be that many i use to think it be just in my ignorance
S0529	two hundred thousand
S0530	what seriously
S0529	mm mm
S0530	no that's crazy
S0529	fuck hell they've underestimate
S0530	rule an area the size of britain
S0529	jesus look at that it's er i i would definitely call it a third world war like you know fifty years later in the history book this'll be know as like a war i reckon this whole thing
S0530	mm
S0529	that we've get at the moment even if it's spread out like it be like cos they be spread out as well
S0530	yeah definitely
S0529	i think the way we kind of determine war be kind of like their urgency and the way they're like all happen like
S0530	mm
S0529	in the moment but really they go on for a long time
S0530	yeah
S0529	and they weren't
S0530	yeah
S0529	always in the public eye like
S0530	definitely
S0529	it so happen that we get affect cos it happen in england like
S0530	cos it's not always like the whole country be take over it's not always like that
S0529	no
S0530	be it
S0530	well cos it's kind of do secretly now really isn't it like because of the media and stuff and what they can hide and
