S0144	okay it's green
S0144	well it's not er green it's red but that mean it's green
S0024	okay but yeah what i be say tai chi be just for an hour but it's all the way over there by the time i walk back 's class will start and 's class be an hour and a half you know
S0144	an hour and a half
S0024	yeah but it would mean one good session of
S0144	but be that
S0024	keep fit
S0144	but that's thirty minutes yoga thirty minutes
S0024	meditation
S0144	meditation
S0024	yeah
S0144	and thirty minutes thirty minutes meditation each side of the yoga be it
S0024	i i don't know i don't know
S0144	cos i i read on her website last night and she be say that yeah that that's what she do
S0024	cos i know a lot of meditation things so
S0144	mm
S0024	her meditation might not be my cup of tea that's another reason why not to pay for the er i could
S0144	yeah cos it's a very individual thing
S0024	yeah but
S0144	especially when you're in a class
S0024	mm
S0144	of up to twenty people can you really meditate in that kind of environment
S0024	and she tend to stutter a fair bite doesn't she i mean erm not stutter but erm
S0144	well she's kind of vague kind of hyper i mean
S0024	maybe she'd change in that situation
S0144	not hyper i mean yeah yeah cos she's get so many ideas go through her head all the time
S0024	battery oh no the battery's go i'm gonna have to run and do the battery be you alright for a minute
S0144	yeah
S0024	well if that's alright with you because i've get no interest in go out drink
S0144	mm
S0024	i mean i'd like to go for coffees and stuff but i can do that with anyway
S0144	mm
S0024	or at odd time you know for an hour or so but be back for feed i want to be back for feed most nights for bedtime it's a nice time really it's a cuddly time and
S0144	yeah
S0024	it's she she need stability at that time
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah so tuesday yeah that would mean dinner time plus feed time and bedtime
S0144	mm
S0024	yeah
S0144	well yeah no it's fair i go out sundays i i can manage one night a week
S0024	yeah but you don't usually go out until she's asleep
S0144	yeah
S0024	so you know it would be be a bite different
S0144	well
S0024	if i say right i'll put her to bed and then go out
S0144	well again that's another case to to pay for per session rather than pay
S0024	yeah
S0144	for the whole semester see how it
S0024	to see how it go
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah okay well i've tell her i'm do tai chi it's that's
S0144	yeah
S0024	er that be a definite cos i can be back for bedtime with tai chi so
S0144	what time's that
S0024	quarter past five to quarter past six so dinner time er but i'll have all erm tut they're gonna do a big cookout maybe tomorrow maybe tonight
S0144	yeah
S0024	oh i've gotta think about dinner again always think about dinner and what we're gonna fee ourselves
S0144	tut yeah well sorry i've be so grumpy today
S0024	it's alright
S0024	it be all a bite of a mess wasn't it
S0144	yeah

S0024	yeah
S0144	i really do like them i just feel so different
S0024	mm yeah there's nothing
S0144	and there's nothing wrong with be different to people
S0024	mm
S0144	there's nothing wrong with that at all but i just find conversation quite hard
S0024	yeah
S0144	it doesn't flow cos a lot of what they say i i kind of in my head i'm kind of disagree with and i don't wanna say anything and i'm sure it's the same with me
S0024	them yeah
S0144	and it's just kind of a little bite but no they're great people i really like them you know they be they're lovely
S0024	mm yeah
S0144	but er
S0024	yeah
S0144	i don't know i dunno maybe it maybe it be the dad thing maybe i don't wanna hang around other dads
S0024	and then judge yourself by other
S0144	well i dunno
S0024	people

S0024	that's what i feel like you're do
S0144	really
S0024	and you shouldn't cos you're a great dad you shouldn't

S0144	yeah
S0024	it's different
S0144	yeah
S0024	older so i don't think you should well that's what i feel like maybe you're do deep down don't know if it's conscious or unconsciously
S0144	he do make me feel guilty
S0024	why
S0144	well cos he he say that he's not gonna go out at all from now on and you know and cos i'm go out play music and
S0144	i dunno and he be say oh i'm not go out i don't wanna neglect my baby and
S0024	that's rubbish you don't go out till she's asleep it's rubbish
S0144	yeah but i i know that he's judge me in that way i do
S0024	who care what he think
S0144	yeah i know
S0024	who care what he think
S0144	i know
S0024	i don't
S0144	i'm just too sensitive
S0024	yeah but he's not say anything have he
S0144	huh
S0024	he's not say anything
S0144	no
S0024	i can't believe today what a pickle that key just
S0144	well
S0024	finalise things didn't it
S0144	well we get in okay
S0024	yeah
S0144	i think we be gonna have to get the locksmith
S0024	well he be a locksmith that guy that come
S0144	and he be gonna change the lock
S0024	yeah he he have his toolbox i dunno if he be gonna change the lock or pick the lock or something he have his toolbox
S0024	i don't and i couldn't work out whether he'd just walk straight past you guy and go in the door
S0144	i didn't see him yeah maybe he go in the back door
S0024	so i be like hang on a minute wait a minute i'm gonna call my husband and just check that this be the right thing
S0144	well that's a good job cos yeah cos she literally
S0144	she yank the er the mailbox open
S0024	my god
S0144	she yank three different ones open
S0024	whose mail
S0144	and it break the lock of three different people's mailboxes
S0144	before she find our key
S0024	oh my god they're gonna they're gonna be so piss off aren't they
S0144	yeah well i'm glad she do it it wasn't us
S0024	no
S0144	but i think she felt that she have to do it because it's kind of her fault well it be her fault
S0024	which mailbox do she put the key in
S0144	she put it in the one that's two above ours or three above ours two or three above ours
S0024	so not
S0144	so she break the one above she break the one below
S0024	ah then it be the next one
S0144	and then she go above and it be in that one
S0024	i i think it would be that one because it's two two 0 two and we live at two 0 0 two
S0144	er yeah
S0024	and i think that's the most obvious one she would've put it in
S0024	and she say no no no no it's not in that one it's in
S0024	two one 0 two
S0144	no
S0024	we be like nobody live there so that's okay we can break that one open
S0024	but people do live at two two 0 two
S0024	so do we have to go and tell them what happen or
S0144	no
S0024	maybe i should text and
S0144	well be there someone er live in that one
S0024	two two 0 two yeah they just move in
S0144	oh really
S0024	yeah
S0144	er
S0024	and and below us
S0144	oh shit
S0024	below us too
S0144	i dunno how break it be but
S0024	the guy
S0144	they use you can open any of those mailboxes just by yank them
S0024	oh my god the guy below us speak english so maybe we should go and speak to him and say er oh i dunno or maybe we should ask the to come and speak to them
S0144	er maybe cos you know they might have some really important document in their mailbox you know
S0024	yeah
S0144	and you don't wanna just i mean it's cos it won't close again it's just flap around
S0024	yeah
S0144	i mean mostly yeah i mean
S0024	but i don't want them to blame us
S0144	it's probably just junk mail but
S0024	i don't want them to blame us
S0144	not us personally no
S0024	i mean the the nanny
S0144	maybe we should yeah we should tell them
S0024	er the cleaner should've the cleaner should've go up to the flats that she break the mailboxes of and just tell them she's just go home

S0144	if it have go over the kerb like the full kerb there'd be really high kerbs there
S0024	yeah they'd erm

S0024	that upset me so much
S0144	yeah i know it do

S0144	but fuck that that be a real lesson wasn't it
S0024	well
S0144	no it be weird cos i be watch that video about the pram the other day
S0024	mm
S0144	blow onto the railway track go oh my god look at that erm
S0024	the thing be every time i stop i put the brake on
S0144	yeah
S0024	it's just that one time
S0144	well cos it look flat yeah you know you can't even leave it on a flat area because
S0024	no
S0144	it's get such a big kind of er surface area that any slight wind catch it and because it's four wheel drive it's just off
S0024	yeah
S0144	so no that i mean it be yeah it be it be quite upset that that happen but it's not gonna happen again
S0024	no too right it's not
S0144	so you know it's a bless really
S0024	well yeah that's why like say when we get in the car things like this happen so that you learn from it it's just if you like some parent be really unlucky
S0144	mm mm
S0024	at that moment
S0144	yeah that one time it happen and it end in tragedy
S0024	yeah
S0144	and like can you oh god it's not even worth think about be it
S0024	no
S0024	but i can't believe how good she be she didn't have she didn't have rice porridge tonight
S0144	no
S0024	and she have a nice good fee just now
S0144	yeah
S0024	but that be because i be quite full because erm cos she hadn't have any for a while luckily she have that banana today she have quite a lot of bananas i think that probably fill her up yeah
S0024	yeah well i in a way i'm glad that you saw that as well and i didn't just come home one day cry that the pram have like what a couple of metres away from me but it's just the
S0144	mm
S0024	mm
S0144	but i i just can't believe how it just take off like that

S0144	it be just a slight breeze
S0024	yeah
S0144	jesus man i wonder how many
S0024	but er
S0144	baby
S0024	yeah
S0024	but er i be glad that you saw it too because
S0144	yeah
S0024	then it become like a learn thing for
S0144	yeah
S0024	both of us
S0144	cos it's quite a heavy pram as well you wouldn't think that such a light wind could do that
S0024	mm
S0144	i mean it be literally both of us take our eye off it for literally five second
S0024	yeah we be get in the car weren't we
S0144	yeah
S0024	get her ready to get in the car yeah
S0144	god yeah but you can't get you don't wanna get paranoid about these things either you just just get into the routine of
S0024	well
S0144	whack the brake on like the first thing we do at when i go to be cos we be next to the river
S0024	yeah
S0144	i think oh my god imagine if it happen here
S0024	yeah but like i say cos it er didn't look like a dangerous
S0144	no
S0024	it wasn't er like a dangerous place
S0144	no but it
S0024	it didn't seem like a dangerous place
S0144	no
S0024	so it be
S0144	but it it turn into a dangerous place very quickly cos it turn the whole pram round and blow it completely the worst place er
S0024	turn it round
S0144	yeah it be face one way
S0024	huh
S0144	turn it and then it be off
S0024	oh god i didn't even realize that i just
S0144	yeah and i be kinda watch it but cos i think be in the car i be like oh be that the pram move and then it i dunno it just take a little
S0024	it take a while to click
S0144	no only like a couple of second but
S0024	well a couple of second be everything isn't it

S0024	well it's funny i think it's fine
S0144	we'll have to get well i mean you know we don't speak the language but but i think if you're try to speak the language then i i think you should be give a bite of leeway
S0024	but they do er er the most people do they're they're very
S0144	especially when there's so many different dialects and accent
S0024	yeah
S0144	that you know er if we're if we learn the accent perfectly well here go up to beijing and say it they'd still take the piss
S0024	yeah
S0144	just cos it sound like we're farmers
S0024	yeah
S0144	anyway yeah it be a quite funny sketch
S0024	i leave my phone inside again let me go and get it just in case
S0144	yeah i haven't hear back from maybe i'll give him a ring

S0144	because of who she be er
S0024	i'll i'll do use cos
S0144	she's never give a shit about anything else but but just to be polite i think you should say you know

S0024	english that you use every day
S0024	now we be in home
S0024	we be at home we
S0024	be fine okay shall i just put that
S0144	yeah that'll do
S0024	okay oh oh it actually er didn't last that long all of that palaver
S0144	no no but it be
S0024	it felt like a long time
S0144	yeah it do and and i take out a lot of that junk you know
S0024	yeah i know i couldn't believe you be carry those
S0024	those sideboards and carry
S0144	i take out three doors
S0024	er yeah
S0144	and
S0024	you've gotta be careful with that because of all those nail stick out as well
S0144	yeah
S0024	just
S0144	well i take out some earlier as well
S0024	cos sometimes she's well no she's a lot sturdier now she doesn't do that push back thing anymore do she
S0144	no
S0024	she doesn't try and get away like
S0144	no
S0024	she doesn't flick back she go through a
S0144	so i i've be take like a bite of that those wardrobes
S0024	yeah
S0144	out every time
S0144	and it's get less and less
S0024	mm
S0144	and they keep disappear from outside the apartment so someone's take them away
S0144	so i'm just gonna keep do it until it's all go
S0024	yeah but you can't take the whole the big wardrobes
S0144	er i'll i'll just get a hammer to it and break it up
S0024	so do you think we should go and knock on the neighbours' doors
S0144	not now
S0024	and try and no but what about their post you say
S0144	well i dunno cos i mean i know they speak english but their english be it's not you know to the extent that we need to explain the situation
S0024	yeah i know
S0144	which be quite complicate
S0024	but they're gonna find out what happen and then they're gonna wonder like why we didn't come go round and tell them you know
S0144	yeah well maybe tomorrow morning
S0024	but like you say what if they have get an important letter in there you'd be piss off wouldn't you would you be piss off
S0144	dunno it's pretty safe here
S0024	well what if if somebody do that to your letterbox what would you feel
S0144	i'd feel piss off
S0024	yeah would you feel better if they go and tell you
S0144	i dunno
S0024	i mean
S0144	i don't know if she's
S0024	they didn't
S0144	it might be worthwhile have a quick look at it actually cos i don't know if she's completely break it or whether er if they put their key in it they can just latch it back in i don't know if the actual lock have just bend
S0024	right
S0144	so if it have bend then we should just go and bend it back
S0024	okay
S0144	and then they'll be able to
S0024	well maybe one of us
S0144	just put the key in otherwise they're gonna go down and see that it be just bend out of shape and then they'd be piss off
S0024	yeah because
S0144	but if we
S0024	i would be
S0144	but if we bend it back first then so it's probably worth have a good look first
S0024	yeah one of us should go down and have a look
S0144	mm
S0024	because you know that would that that kind of thing can ruin your relationship with a neighbour
S0144	mm
S0024	and like he's a nice guy downstairs
S0144	yeah they be nice
S0024	i mean we don't we don't know the other ones but i know that they've just move in erm we could always ask to speak to them
S0144	mm
S0024	mm and erm could say what happen do come
S0144	yeah
S0024	oh they rally round didn't they
S0144	yeah they do yeah they be great well er should never've happen in the first place but they be great
S0024	yeah but then we we we we need to get a couple of key do i mean i know the nanny have one but she leave for a few days
S0144	mm
S0024	should've get the key back really to
S0144	mm
S0024	just to keep a spare one in and then you lose your key the other day but we need we should have another key as well that we keep round somebody else's house
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	i mean actually you know the best house to keep that round and 's house because they're always gonna be there
S0144	yeah
S0024	they'll be there like a lot more than anybody else with the baby won't they like
S0144	yeah that's true
S0024	's out and about quite a lot go out go away for the weekend and stuff
S0144	yeah 's always out
S0024	mm
S0144	yeah
S0024	and then if they've get their key round somebody else's house then there's always like a back channel of get key
S0144	mm
S0024	like if they're away then we can go to and get in their house and then get get the key from their house and get in our house but usually it will be fine cos we'd have a key each
S0144	yeah we should do that between us actually
S0024	make a trio
S0144	make a
S0024	a triangle
S0144	yeah make a
S0024	mind you we've get
S0144	mm
S0024	's key and
S0144	mm
S0024	he completely forget i think
S0024	when he'd get lock out again
S0144	well i don't think the problem be i don't think the problem be his key he just get so blind drink
S0024	he didn't know where he be
S0144	and he lose his glass and he didn't know where he be
S0024	he doesn't always wear his glass
S0144	well he hasn't recently because he lose them but like say she be piss off because if he's not wear his glass then he's not that blind be he
S0144	so why do she need him to come and get her er her to come and get him
S0024	where where be he
S0144	dunno in a ditch somewhere
S0024	that's the second time 's go to find him
S0144	yeah
S0024	and he's be but if you're lose how can you explain where you be
S0144	oh i dunno well he be in somewhere so i dunno
S0024	weird weren't it it's that draught beer
S0144	maybe but beer's not much different to be honest but yeah

S0144	yeah it be nice yeah
S0024	yeah it be nice cos it be it be kind of spontaneous
S0144	well cos we be do our master as well and we we have no money
S0024	mm mm
S0144	and so that be a big thing not have to pay
S0024	yeah
S0144	we be skint
S0024	yeah
S0144	like we be in debt then weren't we
S0024	yeah
S0024	yeah
S0144	that be a tough year that be
S0024	yeah who be say oh be say to me today oh there's this great course on for chinese you just have to pay er pay for a year's subscription and it's you know it's quite a lot of money or what i would would've say be quite a lot of money but actually now that we've get a little bite behind us i'm will to pay for a better course than free ones
S0144	yeah
S0024	and i say to him oh i would've never even consider pay before but if you say that it's good
S0144	mm
S0024	cos do you hear his chinese tonight be very good
S0144	well yeah er he's be study full time for a year and a half
S0024	mm erm but i would've never consider pay money for like an internet course before but he reckon it's pretty good it's like just some listen file so you can just listen to them on the way i can just listen to it on the way to work
S0144	mm
S0024	so i think that might be quite good for me
S0144	it's listen file can't you just copy it off someone else
S0024	well that's yeah well i i say do you you download it but i think he listen to it on the internet
S0144	mm
S0024	which be a problem actually walk to work cos you can't mm
S0144	yeah yeah if you can't download it then
S0024	no
S0144	you don't get much chance here listen to stuff
S0024	maybe i'll ask him again maybe he's download them all but then they wouldn't be able to do that because they wouldn't want people to share the the file if then you'd just pay for a course between a whole load of people and share it
S0144	yeah
S0024	so i doubt if they'd do that
S0144	no no that'd be silly wouldn't it
S0024	at least i get my video on facebook with that copyright
S0144	yeah
S0024	i don't consider that a copyright issue
S0144	well no it's not these copyright laws be so archaic we need to redo it cos it's you know we're in the digital fuck world now people be gonna share stuff share songs you know put songs to your videos and you you can't
S0024	i see that as publicise
S0144	yeah it be
S0024	because they can't copy that song it's not like they can
S0144	no
S0024	listen to it on their own
S0144	no
S0024	they have to watch the video
S0144	no and they're like oh what be that song i really like that
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	let me okay now i know what it be i'll download it for free
S0024	well yeah
S0144	yeah but
S0024	but like with er like on the video
S0144	you can't stop it
S0024	that i make with the picture that's publicise that's not copyright
S0144	mm
S0024	i don't think
S0144	mm yeah i i think copyright law need to be readdressed
S0024	mm
S0144	it's just
S0024	i be so upset when that happen but
S0144	mm
S0024	i'm really glad that
S0144	well i think you know like i say i think i think facebook must have a team of people in the us
S0024	yeah
S0144	go through just er
S0024	huh
S0144	just a random kind of check
S0024	must've be random must be random
S0144	of videos get post of a certain length and just see if it's get music or copyright material
S0024	that's weird cos it's not the length of one song it's the length of two songs
S0144	and you just happen to have one that be check by someone
S0024	yeah
S0144	so when you redo it it would've be outside of the us work hours
S0024	yeah
S0144	and it be fine so
S0024	what a job to watch people's private videos
S0144	yeah but i suppose facebook be probably kind of legally oblige to do that now they probably have pressure from er record company and
S0024	yeah
S0144	er i dunno movie company
S0024	what about youtube then
S0144	well youtube yeah erm well they be they they do delete things
S0024	mm
S0144	but it's a needle in a haystack how can you stop it for the million er millions of people that post some something how can you actually check it because you can't you can't set up a computer program to check that kind of thing it have to be do with a a human
S0024	mm can't they can't a computer program check the wavelengths of like what's contain within video
S0144	what
S0024	like the songs
S0144	what to recognise the wavelength of a particular song
S0024	yeah it would be like recognise a fingerprint
S0144	not not at the moment
S0024	you have a huge database of er of
S0144	well in theory yeah but
S0024	like a fingerprint database
S0144	what every if you think of every song that's ever be produce you'd have to set up a whole system of people put these things in for every single song into this system
S0024	well yeah but once you've get a fast enough computer that should be easy enough shouldn't it if people want your
S0144	well er
S0024	want their work copyright specially then they'd just plonk it into the they just submit
S0144	yeah but er
S0024	they submit the song that they want
S0144	yeah in the future i think that would be hopefully conceivable
S0024	the computer record the wavelength
S0144	but be it worth pay all that money to set up that kind of system which be a huge project
S0024	well
S0144	it's massive right
S0024	probably better than pay a thousand people to
S0144	yeah but
S0024	randomly check
S0144	what i be say about the copyright law it's surely gotta change so it's kind of a redundant thing to do i think
S0024	mm yeah
S0144	cos i mean i know they're they're push it in like the uk and the us this copyright stuff but look at the rest of the world they've get no copyright laws at all
S0024	no
S0144	everyone just download anything they want
S0024	mm
S0144	they they put the fear on you in in europe
S0024	mm
S0144	cos they they can kinda track your ip address and
S0024	mm
S0144	but the rest of the world don't give a shit about that what what do the chinese government care about you're not pay some british record company their dues
S0024	mm
S0144	they've get no fuck concern
S0024	mm
S0024	yeah what you gonna do tonight
S0144	i dunno i haven't hear back from so let's have some food i'll give him a ring
S0024	oh god i forget food huh we could've have the bake potatoes in all this time
S0144	tut oh
S0024	it'd be ready now
S0144	yeah
S0024	we forget
S0144	well i'll stop this and then i'll give a ring
S0024	okay
S0144	bye
