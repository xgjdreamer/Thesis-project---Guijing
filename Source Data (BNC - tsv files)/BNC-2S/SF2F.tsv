S0115	um no uh just that would be an interest different colour
S0037	it would be

S0115	well i wouldn't uh insist you know like i wouldn't try to force you change your hair to blue um
S0037	no that might be a bite like a
S0115	and uh you gonna have it base similar to what it be or uh shorter
S0037	i think so i don't know i keep think like should i get it cut a bite shorter because it grow very fast but
S0115	yeah yeah maybe
S0037	i quite like it like i like be able to tie it up
S0115	yeah
S0037	specially in the summer like it's nice have short hair in the summer if it's really short but if it's like kind of medium it's it's annoy because it's hard to tie up
S0115	um isn't there a way you could sort of do that uh tie it up sort of half tie up
S0037	not yeah there be but it sort of tickle me neck like if it's that's the bite that's the worst i don't really mind the other bits shall we halve this
S0115	oh right well we can't have that can we i mean you can't have
S0037	tickle neck
S0115	you can't have your neck be tickle
S0037	na not by the own hot hair so yeah
S0037	so i don't know i'm go back to the same guy but he be quite sort of like he's really like camp

S0037	i don't mind if he camp my hair up i wouldn't mind that make it nice and big and fluffy
S0115	um but yeah as i say before uh you could've have a perm
S0037	i'm not sure i'm wild about that idea

S0037	i think i'll just get it trim and like and then i've get some dye so i might dye it a bite more just a slightly different colour
S0115	like julia roberts in uh

S0037	yeah well kevin keegan have a perm but i'm not gonna get one

S0115	oh yeah it use to go all round
S0037	aha and like they're quite long though as well like
S0115	yeah
S0037	your hair get a bite like that sometimes
S0115	mm well um you you actually so i suppose that's
S0037	i know no i just mean when it grow like it grow cos it's curly
S0115	well sort of it it's thick isn't it i mean yeah it's too i i'll get it i'll get it cut i'll have it uh um
S0037	no you don't need to get it cut it's nice
S0115	i'll have it shave shave off
S0037	i'm not sure that's that would be very nice but
S0115	might do
S0037	well might do
S0115	which uh um no i could have a crew cut
S0037	you could have a crew cut i could have a crew cut maybe be nice for the summer
S0115	you well um
S0037	just have to rub a flannel on me head and that'll be do
S0115	not not sure if uh
S0115	if if it would suit you crew cut
S0037	i think it would be beautiful that lovely forehead and uh the bite lumpy bite at the back of my head i think
S0115	so would you will you change the colour of it then maybe red
S0037	well i've get uh i've buy some dye which be more or less the same colour as my normal hair
S0115	yeah
S0037	sometimes die your hair like it give it a bite of like make it nice to nice condition nice and i dunno what i be what be i say make it
S0115	maybe give it a nice texture
S0115	yeah so i might do and it's also a little bite more a little bite different so for the spring it's like a bite more gingery
S0115	yeah
S0037	on my already quite gingery hair well red
S0115	be there already whose whose be your favourite celebrity hair
S0037	who's my favourite celebrity hair
S0115	yeah be it like one of those greek ones
S0037	which greek ones
S0115	mm like most most of them you know the the big big greek hair
S0037	um kate middleton's get nice hair hasn't she she always have it do nice
S0115	uh
S0037	i do like um cheryl cole when she have it really massive
S0115	what's it like
S0037	kate middleton hair kate middleton's hair be like just brown but it always look really glossy and nice but it's get like it's her who always have it uh sort of curl towards the end like bite sort of big big sort of curl though
S0115	and curl at the end yeah like so she's get fat hair and she curl it yeah
S0037	she definitely have it do yeah well no um maybe she's get hair that's a bite wavy but it's not not curly
S0115	oh right
S0037	but she's get sort of straightish hair but she just well she the that's she always look nice like cos her hair she's obviously get like a fulltime pardon me a fulltime hairdresser but um and i quite like any of the ones where they have like when they have it really big like cheryl cole sometimes have her hair quite big
S0115	yeah i guess um someone um like
S0037	um and also who else's hair i don't know but i like sort of quite big hair but my hair's just the very very opposite it's quite
S0115	could be there a way that you could get it big
S0037	well i'm not sure you can like back comb it stuff uh which i do do when i go out but i don't wanna do that every time cos i don't wanna like knack the texture of it
S0115	yeah
S0037	like snap it all or anything but i shouldn't complain because people who have like frizzy hair say they wanna have straight hair like i'm lucky i can go out with wet hair in the morning and it'll just be fine it'll just like my normal look like i've blow dry it i only blow dry it to save time
S0115	yeah
S0037	like my hair's not really any different
S0115	yeah like
S0037	you know especially for work i just i just like blast it i don't like do it with a brush or anything so i'm half the time i just don't even do that i just leave the towel on me head while i'm potter around in the morning and then just take it off and i normally dry me fringe bite and then just let the rest dry itself
S0115	yeah
S0037	so
S0115	right
S0037	be i bore you with my hair stories
S0115	um well no i be ask um i be just uh
S0037	so um yeah so i'm quite lucky cos some people some people just can't like me friend lucy she's get lovely hair and if i be her i'd just leave it but she like full on straighten it and that every single day
S0115	cos you cos you cover up mm
S0037	which be crackers if you ask me
S0115	um
S0037	but each to their
S0115	yeah i think a lot of people uh probably more than um more straighten than uh otherwise um
S0037	curl yeah
S0115	but some people uh if you straighten the hair it would grow like in a in a mushroom shape
S0037	yeah that'd be good
S0115	um like um
S0037	maybe i should straighten yours one time
S0115	i think mine
S0037	in fact i don't even know if i've get any straighteners any more
S0115	i think mine mine might go in a mushroom shape um but uh
S0037	oh it'd be nice mushroom
S0115	i think it probably would actually a and e uh survey
S0037	oh it's like some sort of survey
S0115	about the nhs um increase ration
S0037	do you think it should be privatize
S0115	um well it's not be properly uh i don't i don't um uh no i don't i don't understand enough about it but uh i believe that uh they're if if if if it become more like america's one there's a risk it could become more america's be
S0037	i know it's not be privatize as such by name but no i think like for what
S0115	but it's not the same as america's one and it's it's always gonna have that sort of centralize feel i i suppose um but uh
S0037	i don't
S0115	but it it i believe there's a problem in certain company with certain private there's a lot of outsource to private company
S0037	mm
S0115	part of the problem with that be the sort of monopoly aspect of uh
S0037	yeah
S0115	or um it it's not quite a monopoly but it you know the thing with the well we do think we we've talk before about the uh the like the tv the entertainment stuff and the internet stuff
S0037	oh yeah
S0115	um like about how you're you're um a captive audience and you have to pay you have to pay uh a a really uh extortionate fee fee to just to be able to watch tv um
S0037	oh it's horrible i hate all that thing and also like i think and also the the thing about like
S0115	which so but of course there's there's no way that the customer can can choose uh different service there there's only that one private service possibly available from that bed and they can't go anywhere since they're they're stick in the bed so they're that be a force monopoly which be always um
S0037	feed the yeah yeah and like yeah it's horrible and like feed the patients shit but then give them the guests like the in the canteen have all like nice food
S0115	yeah the the sort of desperation to raise um money be be the problem that that hit that like if you if you make um
S0037	yeah
S0115	if you make uh um if you want to introduce like obviously uh a lot of money make um strategies it would you're gonna you um you aren't gonna find things like um you know desperation to make money and and raise all possible
S0037	yeah
S0115	any any price that would possibly be able to go up would go up and uh and yeah charge charge a patient ten pound a day to watch tv for example be uh be be uh be it's partly desperation and also of course it's very unfair because they can't um have they have no ability to to to choose another service although i don't know what they do with laptops if they allow them um which they probably should do
S0037	yeah i know shock opt out like yeah i think you weren't allow them before but i think you sort of be now but i'm not sure
S0115	um so yeah well i think i already talk about that but i mean if i i don't understand like what they be do with the uh nhs now i don't i don't um
S0037	i think it be gonna be that they would let let doctor choose how they should spend the money i dunno the for me the government seem to the conservative government seem to really like like it can't be arsed like it's just put the onus on everyone else like do you read that thing about a level in the news
S0115	uh no i didn't
S0037	so michael gove the absolute the absolute i can't even use the word on a tape cos it's just i don't wanna you know
S0115	they're privatize that as well he's get a funny old face hasn't he i think he's be be lock up lock up in an attic as a child for a while
S0037	but he's horrible isn't he oh he's just i just really dislike the man anyway michael gove um say that he want universities to set a level like to pose the question you know
S0115	uh no i've do he want that or or
S0037	yeah that's what he say he want
S0115	why be he do that to save money
S0037	well
S0115	what's the advantage of it
S0037	well he's say he say he want them to be more rigorous he want to do away with the option to do modules he want to
S0115	whereas no i would've think modules be could be a good thing cos then you'd have a wider range of um knowledge that probably it's likely to help you get a job and probably likely to help you in university
S0037	of course i mean but it's presumptuous to think that a level be
S0115	i don't i don't know i don't see why they're change it be they just change be they just change things simply for the sake of it or they be they do this to make money to to save money somewhere um
S0037	oh probably but i think he's just be elitist by say that like he say that the russell group you know the russell group should set a level so he's offend not only like all other universities in the unite kingdom but for example like a level teachers who perhaps have a better place to know what's work and what's not um
S0115	um i don't know though because this be this actually gonna well the russell not all the russell group be that that great anyway be it i mean
S0037	well who's in the russell group that's not that great warwick warwick be alright
S0115	no i you i you can't insult a whole university but you can say that there may be they're not it's not always that um
S0037	well 's not in the russell group but there's another group of like the the best the most sort of research intensive and 's in that one but but anyway
S0115	yeah i mean i just uh how do i mean where do they even you know where do they get these these ideas be this just the university themselves propose that idea
S0037	basically no not all it's they're like ooh we're a bite surprise by that and we're like there be a woman on this morning say you know universities be so overstretch and now they want us to set the a level things as well and you know it just seem a bite weird it's just like some daily mail view like exams be easy that's basically what that's come from you know
S0115	really have it come from that
S0037	well that's my opinion
S0115	why but but how many uh but why wouldn't they want their wouldn't people want their exams to be wouldn't people want exams to be easier for their own children but harder for everyone else sort of in a not my not in my back yard sort of thing
S0037	well older older people think that a level be easier now don't they oh i don't know but i just think that be stupid i just think he be just try to put it onto other people like they're not tackle any problems
S0115	i i don't know i mean i don't know the whole of the
S0037	i think he's just put problems onto like
S0115	ah i don't know that i wonder um
S0037	but anyway maybe that's just
S0115	there's be
S0037	maybe that's not the case
S0115	yeah so the main story in the on this one seem to have be the introduction of something call uh um big society capital i mean what be you obviously haven't you haven't hear of that have you
S0037	what cameron no not really i mean i i've hear of his big society ideas none of which i've be particularly like bowl over by but that's just me
S0115	um the it's not easy to just sort of tell people to do stuff for free um
S0037	cos the people who want who be gonna be incline to do that be already do that i bet
S0115	um
S0037	ooh sorry ooh i'm sorry
S0115	it yeah well if you can force people but it doesn't always work do it because
S0037	sorry
S0115	uh because they would say that you know like with the uh where they try to get people to to work for nothing um
S0037	ah thank you oh yeah in the in the shop
S0115	yeah in fact so that didn't work that didn't sort of
S0037	thank you
S0115	that didn't work very well they they all pull out of it
S0037	yeah no it didn't because yeah they be just like take advantage of people weren't they really
S0115	i dunno well the company pull out so um if the company pull out then somebody uh well the customers must've complain or
S0037	yeah
S0115	someone scar cos like some of those company like tesco be be you know as powerful if not more powerful than the government itself so if when they if they change their mind then they must've really be scar by it uh probably some aspect of the media be yeah maybe media sort of try to scare them out of it but
S0037	yeah well it be just bad press wasn't it yeah i'm all for people be give chance though but if they're just be take advantage of then i mean that's obviously not cool
S0115	uh well it just appear i mean because on the one hand it it seem like a good thing to
S0037	so we didn't sorry
S0115	to to try and get people into into job but i would i would think if you wanna force somebody to work you can at least force them and then pay them not not force them and then give them the same that they have before that that's a difficult issue it's different here than in america isn't it because like they're not they're not really cut in the same way be they
S0037	yeah yeah um i don't know
S0115	i guess it depend on the state obviously but here the message be absolutely you know um austerity and cut everything whereas in uh i think in america they they've they've decide to to put in load more um money they've basically not currently um
S0037	yeah what's that call again
S0115	they're not cut they're not cut
S0037	to stimulate growth you mean what's that call i'm sure it's get like a
S0115	uh well there's different things aren't there you know be there there's quantitative ease
S0037	quantitative ease
S0115	and then that's uh i think that just mean print money um
S0037	yeah i wish they'd just say that
S0115	like but um and it's it uh it bond um like bond be issue uh that's the bank of england loan the government money then get take the bond or something like that and then as the bank of england have loan the money then
S0037	yeah
S0115	um that mean the money get to be print it's inject another yeah they do there be three hundred billion or something recently the um extra money be print
S0037	i find it i find i
S0115	but it america though they're more sort of i think they've increase they have the bailout package which which be uh something that be um there be a lot of news about that i think back in whenever it be um and they're so they they have a really enormous amount of money that be inject into um into their economy
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	um which be the world's biggest um and uh that seem to me to be a slightly different technique to what's go in over in europe it's seem to be always um apart from maybe some of the more successful countries like germany pretty much everyone's just um basically chop the
S0037	yeah
S0115	it uh just just reduce um spend and and cut um cut government spend cut fund for things um so just struggle to sort of define that
S0037	well i dunno i find it hard to follow like i suppose it's not i suppose that it's get i'm not like really massively interest in um economics
S0115	yeah i know well it it can be it can be very bore i understand why people find it bore because they it's quite technical and it's also depress as well but i but i think it have uh a huge impact on people's daily live
S0037	yeah
S0115	from the number of bus to uh how much it cost to buy food to fuel to everything it's all like connect in in the economics isn't it um
S0037	oh no i can i can see why
S0115	and i i mean obviously uh you know fuel price be a good example of uh
S0037	yeah the fuel crisis as well
S0115	well we just have we just have the panic didn't we so uh panic panic buy
S0037	i like it that like other things be jump on the band wagon and say like oh panic buy beer and like panic buy you know shoe or whatever
S0115	yeah yeah i mean that be that be cos they think it be gonna be a strike which be never confirm um but uh that's
S0037	have there even be a strike like they
S0115	no no there there wasn't but there be
S0037	i'm sure they be just try to get some extra revenue in before the end of the tax year
S0115	oh yeah something like that i mean they try to get the guy to resign but he didn't um he didn't resign uh i think they be just try to like sensationalize it and put the blame on um you know sort of uh attack the strikers hadn't actually start strike yet so um
S0037	hadn't strike
S0115	they they they he sort of want i suppose he want to attack them before they'd before they'd actually before they think of start the strike um yeah perhaps to scare them out of start the strike
S0037	yeah
S0115	which which work in that way but but it also mean that there be massive like panic and and uh one person do die actually so there be one uh
S0037	oh be that the woman who be decant that in her next to her gas cooker or something
S0115	i don't know but um someone someone there well there one person die basically from the from the panic from the panic buy sort of
S0037	which who d'you mean die what of what do she die of though it wasn't just sheer panic
S0115	uh be burn by petrol i imagine
S0037	yeah that be the woman who'd i think who'd stockpile the petrol and she be decant it from one like jerry can into another while her oven be on
S0115	well it's above the oven or something
S0037	no like i think she be just splash it around while a gas flame be on in her well it's like the vapour'll ignite won't it
S0115	yeah i dunno yeah i never i never think of it i mean i didn't i didn't think like i suppose you when you say oven you don't you mean the actual uh you mean a gas hob you mean like a hob
S0037	like she be cook her dinner yeah yeah a gas hob like a naked flame yeah
S0115	yeah yeah uh that's that's like naked flame yeah
S0037	well i mean that's like darwinism that be if you ask me
S0115	but if it weren't for the if it weren't for the panic then she she wouldn't have get burn
S0037	d'you know what i mean i feel i feel very sory for her family and everything
S0115	she wouldn't have be um she wouldn't have be decant
S0037	i really do i do feel sorry for her family and stuff cos it's you know it's not very nice but at the same time like that's like you know safety like one oh one that if you ask me
S0115	well it i guess it be
S0037	bite of natural selection there i think
S0115	yeah but people just make mistake man if they're if they're if they're in a hurry if if you're in a panic
S0037	well
S0115	then then you you you you may make a mistake like because cos they're not normally they're not normally do that be they
S0037	well if you're gonna get into
S0115	you don't normally handle fuel in the house do you so
S0037	well you shouldn't either i mean there's no good reason to
S0115	yeah but if you can you can pour it in the um live room can't you or can't you i mean
S0037	well you can
S0115	you're say that even the even the vapour of it be gonna catch fire
S0037	well i wouldn't do it i mean i don't
S0115	you'd have to yeah decant it outside
S0037	oh uh yeah exactly
S0115	yeah so i don't know why she didn't decant it outside that's something that we don't we don't know
S0037	in your garage or something innit ah
S0115	um perhaps she didn't have an outside
S0037	well most people have an outside
S0115	so no i don't know whether that be uh but uh uh yeah so everyone's feel the pinch
S0037	well
S0115	um it be it do feel like it have since the crisis or whatever felt like a
S0037	a a fuel crisis
S0115	that everyone's like everything's get everything's shrink or be raise in price
S0037	and now they're say i know and now they're like oh you can't water your garden or whatever
S0115	well that's annoy that's an old one that be
S0037	no no but like from today it's a if you get catch water your garden it's a thousand pound fine
S0115	that's quite that's quite bizarre you know
S0037	ridiculous isn't it
S0115	it's quite strange consider the amount the sheer enormous quantity of rain that fall in england
S0037	i know i know well we've get a rainwater thing haven't we so can just collect it
S0115	why be they sort of do all this all this stuff anyway about it's rain now
S0037	i know it's rain now
S0115	be you suppose to collect your own water or something
S0037	i think it hasn't be rain for a while though
S0115	um i mean can they not take water from the sea somehow
S0037	well i don't know
S0115	yeah uh i suppose like that that's the most efficient that you know with the with um reservoirs presumably you have to store water in a reservoir you can't store it in in in some way to prevent it from evaporate
S0037	i don't think plant like sea water that much in the sea don't know
S0115	i guess
S0037	well
S0115	a a lidded reservoir
S0037	no i suppose it always do evaporate it would be quite a big lid for the reservoir
S0115	yeah
S0037	so
S0115	but it's just be it's just not perhaps that that possibility's there isn't you know it would be too expensive to uh
S0037	put a lid on the reservoir
S0115	to to lid the reservoir
S0037	i think it most definitely would be they could store it underground maybe
S0115	depend what you lid it with though doesn't it
S0037	could store it underground
S0115	yeah i mean presumably there's some reason why they because they collect the rainwater but um
S0037	i dunno
S0115	i suppose there could there could be able a method of of try to keep
S0037	but you're right it's rain all day today
S0115	cos cos it's it seem that the volume be there you i mean
S0037	yeah
S0115	somehow anyway
S0037	but i bet they'll still water the grass at king's and all that they'll just pay it won't they
S0115	um i don't know uh they they they would be pretty exempt i imagine cos they're a public um institution or something
S0037	yeah be it just private home then
S0115	guess so yeah i imagine you could get round it if you if you're a public institution no that's never well it use to be hosepipe like um
S0037	yeah
S0115	they always use to have those things but but um uh it it's pretty wasteful i suppose innit all the get a hosepipe and just like sort of let it let it run
S0037	squirt it around yeah i suppose it be but if you're grow stuff like we're grow vegetables i mean i'm not gonna be like let them dry out be i
S0115	well part of it they'd have to prove they'd have to prove that you that you water your garden or something they'd have to come round and i mean sort of
S0037	look at your garden yeah see if it's wilt
S0115	and then um you could you could be frame though someone could uh
S0037	ah and like neighbour take picture of you like the uh stasi
S0115	get get a hose hose pipe and sort of spray like could get their hose pipe and spray it on your garden then like
S0037	then you can like remember
S0115	well that that's like one of those one of those stupid petty garden war where
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	where neighbour chop each others' tree down
S0037	that's right yeah or argue over like spend hundreds of thousands of pound on legal cost about like like land the size of like a stamp or something
S0115	like border border that happen quite a lot i think you know when have work in litigation there be a lot of case you know the fee be enormous like
S0037	why do people do it people've just get more money than sense haven't they
S0115	well yeah basically i think that's that's mainly um but they're also just some people be just genuinely bad people so you have to do something to um
S0037	yeah yeah but if it be like a tiny strip of land then you would just be like d'you know what have it like
S0115	well i mm i it's not it's not be something that well some that i ever really think of but you've get a kind of neighbour that decide to sort of rebuid a fence and then sort of you know put his fence sort of
S0037	yeah right on your bite
S0115	like a a metre further in
S0037	they do that to me nana like me nana use to um have
S0115	i think it's just bad people isn't it
S0037	me nana have daffodils
S0115	person who's always get to
S0037	have all these tulips and daffodils a massive big load of them against against that fence in her old garden where we where she use to live and the council come and replace the fence um cos the her neighbour be horrible
S0115	yeah i know yeah i remember you say
S0037	yeah and they replace the fence cos um when it be me marge use to live next door they have a lower fence cos they would chat over it but they get it she have it replace when these horrible neighbour come and have like a high one
S0115	yeah
S0037	so then they move it though and like she lose all of her flower they all go on the other side of the fence they move it over like by
S0115	how who who move it
S0037	the council move the fence by about you know
S0115	but how i mean that can't just happen can it or be there some corruption or something
S0037	dunno just by mistake i think not on purpose
S0115	so she she wasn't there to see see it happen
S0037	well i don't think you realize until the spring time come and all the flower be on the get eat by the like horrible like staffies and that next door
S0115	fuh
S0037	never mind
S0115	there um uh they're i guess some them sort of families cos like we be watch the uh that um that gypsies program weren't we
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh i suppose when if you see those sort of staffie type families it it remind you of the similarity to some of the um gypsy families like a cultural similarity
S0037	yeah but i mean you can't say that anybody anyone with a staffordshire bull terrier's bad i mean it's not the dog's fault like you say before
