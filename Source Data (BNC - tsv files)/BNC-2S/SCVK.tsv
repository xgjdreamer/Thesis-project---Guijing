S0530	it be and er like we're not religious but it be a typical day of rest
S0530	like me and my sister would just stay in our pyjamas till like two in the afternoon and then like i dunno then we'd maybe go out for a walk
S0529	mm
S0530	as a family when er cos that's what our family do
S0529	oh god that sound tragic
S0530	that's what you do in you go for a family walk because there's nothing else to do
S0529	oh mm
S0530	and yeah so that be
S0529	yeah i hat sundays as well it feel like it feel to me like four o'clock all day
S0530	yeah it's so dull
S0529	like cos four o'clock be my least favourite time of day cos it's like near the end and five o'clock's the even and things start get like
S0530	i know
S0529	you know people like slow down and it's just i just hate it i've always hat it and that's what sunday feel like
S0530	and sunday's the longest yeah it's the longest day of the week
S0529	yeah
S0530	so it feel
S0529	but you're dread the next day like
S0530	yeah
S0529	you kinda don't want it to end but it's also really tedious you do yeah what do my what do my family do on sunday i dunno we have we have sunday lunch pretty much every week
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	and my and my gran come to that so that's always quite entertain
S0530	mm
S0529	cos she always like sit and at the table and be like oh i be sick as a god last night
S0529	and then she like to describe in detail how sick she be erm how long it last and
S0530	right
S0529	all of that so that's good erm then i just sit and slob around or go for a walk as well around the beach
S0530	mm very nice
S0529	yeah
S0530	great day sundays
S0529	it's fuck bore
S0530	mm fine day sunday
S0529	no post on sundays
S0530	no post on that's right harry no post on sunday
S0530	we need to watch that like have
S0529	watch harry potter again
S0530	we should have a harry harry potter marathon oh it's just a shit day and the weather's always shit though which make it even worse
S0529	there's really nothing to do in this college
S0530	i dunno if there's more to do like cos i know we're in and that just kind of it's far out
S0529	yeah and i be wonder er the the other day like whether the college thing be actually that great because i feel like we get a a worse deal with it like
S0530	yeah i yeah
S0529	like some colleges aren't as good as good as the others and some i dunno whether they get more fund but they seem to just have more stuff go on all the time and like just like different vibes and
S0530	mm i mean i do be quite a
S0529	mm
S0530	a lot of foreign students be here which base they say that it's so people can have more like time to themselves kinda thing but i guess the thing i don't agree with with the with the college system be like colleges be all about what you can afford
S0529	yeah exactly
S0530	basically so
S0529	they should be completely equal they're just like kind of nice to have your own college it shouldn't be like oh like get all the superior house and they have like a good bar and they have stuff go on and they're near campus and all of that stuff so
S0530	yeah i know
S0529	and just really get short the short straw really and that i get why you know foreign students like it here cos it's quiet and everything but i think i'd probably prefer to be somewhere a little bite like where there's a little bite more go on maybe
S0530	no i know definitely
S0529	cos i mean i'm really not fuss about be quiet like it i don't really like be too quiet it make me a bite uncomfortable like i dunno
S0530	i mean it's just too quiet there's there doesn't seem to be a lot go on at bar
S0529	yeah no although i once have erm i go for sunday lunch the other week at the bar and it be like there be load of people in there
S0530	mm
S0529	i think it's just like we just don't really go out
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	so we can't really realise that there be actually like people around and we could go to the jcr but that's just really tragic
S0530	we could go to the jcr yeah everyone go on about what be like
S0529	oh it's erm you know where be it's like underneath that
S0529	and it i think it's like restaurant thing
S0530	okay
S0529	i'm not sure what food be though it's foreign some sort of food do it cost money to send photos
S0530	to
S0529	to what
S0530	oh to send photos like via text
S0529	yeah
S0530	do it
S0529	no i think it do do it like i'm not sure

S0530	he's a twat
S0529	jesus what be it

S0529	oh yeah i've see that one but then i find it hilarious that the french ambassador erm he say be huge erm vulture
S0529	think that be amaze
S0530	that be so funny
S0529	cos everyone hat him which be brilliant
S0530	who even do like him though
S0529	i don't know scary i really hope for america's sake that he do not get elect like
S0530	i mean do you think he will he can't
S0529	i don't know he probably could you know the conservatives get elect and we think they be okay
S0530	yeah that's true i don't want it to be monday but i don't want it to be sunday
S0529	mm
S0530	er cos i get bore of weekend
S0529	well they're really shit up here
S0530	like it's not like yay it's the weekend like
S0529	i know
S0530	i feel happy on fridays but then it's like oh
S0529	yeah fridays be good i just wish we could do more i just don't have any money
S0530	like that's it you need money for everything
S0529	everything cost money yeah
S0530	like
S0529	cos you have to get the bus everywhere if you wanna go out of the campus like
S0530	mm
S0529	and it really add up like two fifty a week like i usually go into town like once or twice a week so that's like a fiver every week pretty much for six weeks so far it's just bloody ridiculous
S0530	yeah
S0529	and you and you know the reason the price up on bus cos it be cheaper last year
S0530	i know how much be it last year
S0529	it's it's i i don't know but i know they put them up it's because they've get wifi on bus now
S0530	well who need wifi on the fuck bus
S0529	i know exactly so they think that they would be able to charge students more because they have wifi
S0530	i don't even
S0529	it just be the most ridiculous thing ever i don't use the wifi on there doesn't fuck work anyway
S0530	everyone just use data
S0529	yeah i know
S0530	fuck's sake
S0529	well actually i don't because once i use so much data that i like incur about like a hundred pound
S0530	yeah yeah but i just text people if i need to communicate with them like
S0529	yeah
S0530	i know the bus journey's gonna be quite long but i don't go on the internet really
S0529	i know they do feel really long don't they like it doesn't take that long to get into town really
S0530	because the bus yeah the bus rout be shit
S0529	oh i know they go everywhere
S0530	it's really sometimes the bus stop at a stop for like ten minutes as well like
S0529	yeah
S0530	what be with that
S0529	oh yeah i never get the one from cos it go to and then wait at for literally like twenty minutes
S0530	yeah
S0529	until it go under the underpass and it's just like
S0530	yeah and then it sit at the underpass
S0529	i don't see why you just you just cater for the underpass then that's great that's just bite of discrimination against again
S0530	it really be it really be
S0529	make me angry and i really i don't feel like go to ever really like i just
S0530	no
S0529	erm i just dunno what i feel like do
S0530	i mean club be just i dunno yeah
S0529	like sometimes i like go club but it's very occasionally
S0530	you've gotta be in the right mood for it
S0529	yeah
S0530	like it's gotta have like a special event or it have to have a like a theme night or something that's actually worth go to
S0529	i know although like when i i feel like if i'm about to go out i always feel like i don't want to and then when i go out i i usually enjoy myself so i feel like i should just drag myself out more but then
S0530	mm mm
S0529	but then but then at the same time i just can't be arsed with it really
S0530	but i have to admit club at the amaze like it's so good
S0529	yeah i bet
S0530	like you could just go in and out of a club for the even like they'd all be open and they'd have like you could go to like huge club or you could go to a small one and then
S0529	mm
S0530	go to a pub and oh it's so good and now it's just like oh
S0530	like i wasn't a big clubber but i can imagine if people who be really into that be go to and expect to like
S0529	oh god i know
S0530	can you imagine
S0529	although like it's very easy to actually go club in cos the bus the megabus erm leave at one thirty
S0530	oh okay
S0529	so like you could plausibly go to for the night
S0530	how much be the megabus
S0529	four pound
S0530	that's good
S0529	i know it's so cheap
S0530	very good
S0529	i mean that's what i do when i go when i go to like gigs i would get that bus and it be like really
S0530	mm
S0529	convenient but no i just don't feel like do it like don't need it any more
S0530	you you just don't yeah you just don't you feel like you've grow out of it almost
S0529	yeah i do a bite

S0529	i hope i get to see london though that'll be cool but i probably won't cos it's dark it'll be dark when i'm fly
S0530	the lights'll be on though
S0529	oh yeah that's true
S0530	and the christmas light which'll be great and
S0529	yeah oh that'll be nice and
S0530	some of the things'll be all light up so if you travel over the main city bite i don't know if you will but if you do you'd be able to see all that for sure
S0529	oh oh they call it airport now that's so cute
S0530	airport
S0529	oh bless
S0530	that's really sweet
S0529	good it's so small yeah look it's literally like that's the only runway and it's just that
S0530	oh my god
S0529	in the middle of nowhere
S0530	that's really cute so not exactly like heathrow then
S0529	no oh there's the sea
S0530	oh you'll definitely have to skype me from
S0529	yes i will
S0530	we'll have so much fun

S0530	i do i'll add you
S0530	what what be you on skype

S0530	i don't even know what i be
S0529	i be
S0530	okay
S0529	that's my user name
S0530	okay i will add
S0530	not
S0529	no no i dunno why i but wow look how empty it be there's like nothing there
S0530	oh my god there's like it's literally just field
S0529	it's only field yeah okay train ticket right what be i need eleventh be you leave on the eleventh as well cos i feel like i'm go earlier than everyone else
S0530	i'm leave on the eleventh
S0529	you be okay
S0530	be that the day we break up because
S0529	yeah we break up on the eleventh
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	but i think i'm probably gonna have to miss that day because i need to get to the airport in time
S0530	that probably won't be a problem
S0529	i should've say i be go on the twelfth really but i i didn't
S0530	oh well you'll be able to go home a day earlier then
S0529	mm i dunno what day i have to get come back though
S0530	you're thirty six weeks right contract
S0529	yeah
S0530	do we do we do not have to vacate our room at christmas
S0529	no only easter
S0530	then why don't we have to pay over christmas then
S0529	i don't i don't know like i really don't understand
S0530	like i don't get it because we're still here technically
S0529	i think maybe in easter there's something go on and they need like accommodation free or something cos i know that yeah in in my town like the uni in my town like they have like jewish conventions on and people have to like leave their room so there's space for people to stay
S0530	okay
S0529	but i don't know it's i don't really know why
S0530	cos cos the people here they're pay still for the full amount so what's the point
S0529	yeah i know it's it's really bad well if worst come to worst we can just dump our stuff in like someone's room who who's get erm forty six weeks
S0530	i mean say we could chuck her stuff in room
S0529	yeah yeah exactly it'll be fine
S0530	cos you be your
S0529	just get so much stuff though that's the problem
S0530	be your parent pick you up or be you go
S0529	from from the erm airport
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	what in
S0530	oh no i mean when you go home over easter be you your parent come up here
S0529	oh we haven't work it out yet well we just didn't wanna think about it but i suppose they'll have to really
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	i think what i'll do i'll go i'll get my dad to pick me up from here take it to my dad's which be like a little bite closer to home like not not really very closer but erm it'll cut off like an hour or so of the journey so
S0530	oh that's that's
S0530	bite better slightly better
S0529	but erm well yeah not really but it's
S0530	how far be your dad
S0529	er he live in so it take about three hours to get here from there
S0530	mm
S0529	and then be about five hours from still
S0530	okay
S0529	so it's it's like i think when you get to you go the other way or something to
S0530	oh right
S0529	to when you go here i don't really know but
S0530	mm
S0529	yeah that that's probably what i'd do and then they'd come and get me the rest of the way or they drop me off in where my sister be and then we drive round to with all my stuff
S0530	yay
S0529	but i don't know how that would fit in a tiny car but
S0530	fun
S0529	this be what i say to them i'm not take as much stuff this time
S0530	because it'll just be a pain
S0529	and yet they still fuck tell me like you can't do that you have to take everything with you like
S0530	like you've gotta be fully commit
S0529	cos i look at this room and i just think how how on earth be i gonna get all this stuff home
S0530	i think say if you put
S0529	mm
S0530	if you've get like if you get under your bed
S0529	i mean i have get box
S0530	yeah
S0529	all over there but it's just a massive massive
S0530	yeah i'm gonna pack all my stuff into box
S0529	load of stuff
S0530	i'm gonna take all my clothe home decide
S0529	yeah
S0530	but put my shitty like do we have to how about the kitchen
S0529	i know what i'm think about the kitchen be i might just leave my stuff here like if i be to leave i would just leave all my stuff here and
S0530	mm
S0529	someone else could have it cos i can't take it back with me and i'm not go back to uni so i don't need pot and pan yet like
S0530	but like
S0529	i probably
S0530	i think that they say i can't remember but apparently it's just the bedrooms you have to vacate not the kitchen at easter
S0529	yeah must be cos everyone else who get to stay would be able to use the kitchen so probably
S0530	yeah that's a little bite better
S0529	yeah yeah i think it'll be alright
S0530	yeah
S0529	yeah
S0530	it's just a fuck pain cos i could not afford to
S0529	it be
S0530	get the full contract that's why cos i be like

S0530	i know
S0529	or save it god's sake
S0530	i hate money

S0530	i hate why can't we have a frigging other currency like why can't we just farm our money
S0529	i don't know
S0530	rather than earn it
S0529	you should write a book on it it would be the next dystopian novel thing
S0530	what he what an ideal universe

S0530	rather than like yeah
S0530	we have to look in the hedge for money can you imagine just like if that be like

S0529	erm basically i i email the wrong person who like when i ask for an extension
S0530	mm
S0529	erm so they haven't email me back and it be the wrong person anyway and then the woman who like who's like the course convenor or something
S0530	mm
S0529	she say to me like due to what you've already tell us like you qualify for an extension and i can give you one
S0530	oh
S0529	if you email me back and i do email her back say like yeah an extension would be really helpful but it's you know it's the weekend so she hasn't
S0530	i'm sure she'll yeah i'm sure she'll reply to you say on monday it's no problem we can give you
S0529	yeah she should she say it wouldn't be a problem to give me an extension which be a relief
S0530	well that's a relief isn't it
S0529	i know it's so good it's cos of this it's cos of the really long email i send her cos she be the one i send that like really like sob story email to and she's like obviously
S0530	it obviously work then
S0529	i know it's very helpful to me
S0530	and you definitely you're eligible for one so
S0529	yeah so she's just say yeah you can have one so it'll be that'll be but the problem be it say like three to seven days and i dunno whether that count from the day the essay be due or the day you get give the extension and whether or not you can get seven days and like even if i do have seven days i don't know how to
S0530	start it
S0529	i still don't know how to do it like it doesn't solve that problem it's just delay it again and that doesn't really help
S0530	mm i mean i think definitely it'll be an achievement
S0529	yeah
S0530	when you actually hand this one in
S0529	i know absolutely we're gonna have a party
S0530	no matter how late it be yes of course we be
S0529	we're gonna have a party when it's gonna be like a momentous occasion for me in my life
S0530	cos it be hard like push through that definitely get hand in the first thing
S0529	mm
S0530	or the second or whatever like it be
S0529	mm
S0530	it be hard
S0529	it be
S0530	cos you just don't feel in the right mind to do it and it doesn't even feel like a likelihood do it like it's gonna happen that actually when it do like
S0529	no it really doesn't
S0530	i can't believe that i hand in my one like i didn't think it be gonna happen but then it do and then i'm like we'll just do you know what i don't actually care about the mark any more like i've just i'm glad it's do
S0529	oh i do though
S0530	and that's how you feel like
S0529	i just know it's gonna be shit like
S0530	but it doesn't as long as you hand it in it really do not matter
S0529	no it do
S0530	why's it matter
S0529	i don't know it just do cos i hate be bad at things
S0530	it's first year first same i hate be bad at things
S0529	yeah
S0530	i hate be bad at things but the thing be like i know you've not do it in a while but i think still your essay write skills when you actually do it when you actually hand your stuff in i think you might surprise yourself a bite
S0529	mm
S0530	i mean i know you're a bite doubtful but you okay more than a bite doubtful
S0529	a bite yeah
S0530	about that but
S0529	i dunno
S0530	yeah
S0529	i kinda wanna show you the one i write at a level just to tell you how bad just like so you can get an idea of how bad it be also i don't cos it's really bad
S0530	you're not you're better i can guarantee that it won't be bad like
S0529	oh it be bad it be bad i don't like i i look at it and i think how on earth do that do well it's just
S0530	it must've do because you do do well you do incredibly well
S0529	yeah but i just think it's i think it's the standard of everything everyone else like it must've be just a little bite better than everyone else's because everyone else be kind of shit too like we be all just really shit at english and i dunno
S0530	i don't really know what it mean to be good at english any more
S0529	no i don't either it's such a woolly subject
S0530	like be it know all the history or be it be able to construct an essay or
S0529	i know
S0530	like what what
S0529	i think at a level the problem with me be it for me like be good at it mean know what the examiner want and now it's not like that and it's kind of difficult cos
S0530	mm
S0529	you've gotta have that kind of talent to get through it
S0530	yeah i mean i feel like that
S0529	i don't think i would've do as well in english if i'd just go through it on like my own sort of instinct and my own write i always look at what i could do for the examiner like i always look at context and all this like all the critics and stuff like that and yeah just
S0530	but i think that's what it's
S0529	yeah i know it kind of yeah but now it's like more about your opinion and that's the problem
S0530	actually about at that point yeah
S0529	that i encounter now
S0530	cos everyone you're just a bite like na
S0529	i don't know my opinion i i'm full of shit and
S0530	na that's what your essay should just be title na
S0529	oh god
S0530	just na or nope or no
S0529	yeah it's just gonna be nope
S0530	nope
S0529	that's it
S0530	no
S0529	it's entirety
S0530	no way
S0530	that'd be a very interest essay i'd love to read that like
S0529	just it's
S0530	what's your opinion on shakespeare nope na
S0529	it's entire experience be just nope
S0530	nope
S0529	really
