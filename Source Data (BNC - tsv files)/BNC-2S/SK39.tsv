S0180	mm
S0183	it be brilliant it be really nice
S0180	that's clever
S0183	and the place where i meet her be shibuya
S0180	shibuya
S0183	something like that shibuya
S0180	i've hear of shibuya isn't that a famous fashion district or something
S0183	i don't know
S0180	or in tokyo mm
S0183	well you know they all look the same with all those em criss cross
S0180	cross
S0183	zebra cross
S0180	okay do you get the feel like it be a mega city over there too big or very big
S0183	no i didn't feel it be very big eh definitely they're big but i think the a lot of the young people look exactly the same
S0180	right
S0183	like the girls have all have long hair you know wavy hair
S0180	mm
S0183	dye copper with em burberry rain coat
S0180	really so it's
S0183	style raincoats
S0180	so it's fashion but everyone follow the same fashion
S0183	yeah and all girls be like the same
S0180	yeah
S0183	like a lot of them and all the men be like and all the men they be so skinny young men that be
S0180	mm
S0183	they're more narrow than we be
S0180	like an androgynous nineteen seventies look
S0183	yeah
S0180	yeah
S0183	they be all in black suit
S0180	mm
S0183	thin tie
S0180	bite like the seventies in the uk
S0183	em
S0180	yeah cos some countries like italy i notice with the students we have they all dress the same
S0183	yeah i'm sure
S0180	even if it's they're not in school uniform but they're all dress in the same fashion
S0183	well if you look at a teenager now they all look the same you know this really messy hair where their fringe be right in their eye
S0180	yeah
S0183	i don't know my all my cousins have their hair like that
S0180	do they
S0183	mm hm i forget what i be go to say now
S0180	i think teenagers in outside london tend to dress the same as well
S0183	oh everywhere
S0180	in london london though you tend to get more differentiation cos i always notice like if you go to or and you see all the kid get on the train come out from night club they usually all dress up boys be all dress in the same t shirt and white trainers and white sock all that sort of thing
S0183	and girls all dress the same
S0180	yeah there's less differentiation than those in london i think
S0183	mm
S0180	oh look that's the asimo robot isn't it that's come a long way honda i didn't know honda make it it's really clever
S0183	oh
S0180	they use to sell them here as gimmicky toy didn't they but now they're these be quite big ones on this television program there
S0183	mm
S0180	that's really clever look at it
S0180	so em excuse me
S0183	and i go to hong kong with
S0180	oh right
S0183	and we go through to taiwan together
S0180	oh i see
S0183	cos her sister at the time be live there with her husband
S0180	mm
S0183	he be work there
S0180	and where do you think of taiwan
S0183	em they have really nice foods and lot of really nice street food
S0180	eh mm hm
S0183	em even at the even eh there be this street market that be open in the even and it be just amaze lot of lot of food
S0180	oh yeah that's how they market themselves now on the advert the street market i think
S0183	yeah
S0180	but how be it different to hong kong do you get an impression the people or the pace of life or be it the same be it similar
S0183	em well taiwan be bigger than hong kong
S0180	yeah
S0183	a lot more spacious i can't remember cos i didn't actually spend that long in taipei
S0180	taipei
S0183	em but
S0180	i suppose there have more of japanese influence do you sense that
S0183	oh yeah i do because i think the roads be wider and it look more like japan and em and anyway em i only go there for one night
S0180	mm
S0183	and i come out the next day and i fly air china early in the morning and stay an extra day to be with her sister
S0180	so you didn't stay very long in taiwan
S0183	
S0180	you
S0183	no i didn't
S0180	yeah
S0183	or maybe it be two nights but
S0180	only two nights that's a bite strange
S0183	but that be i don't know why we do that actually because i don't know that be cos we would want to spend more time in hong kong and i hadn't be to hong kong for age
S0180	and that's in two thousand and seven
S0183	two thousand and three
S0180	oh you hadn't be since two thousand and three

S0183	i mean you felt the weight of it but yeah but em i take a lot of photos obviously when i be in taiwan but they never come out

S0183	mm but i mean i have a really good fuji camera
S0180	not just a
S0183	a film camera
S0180	oh
S0183	and maybe cos it be em it expose to light and i never get those photos i be really upset cos i get all the street food
S0180	it would have be not digital
S0183	no it wasn't digital
S0180	mm
S0183	that be when the those em i don't know what what film they call it now where they take
S0180	disposable

S0180	shiyan or guangzhou no
S0183	no i would like to go to shanghai i think
S0180	mm hm yeah let's rather visit but i think better be inland place like shiyan and changdao and place like that wuhan you get a very it's very interest the inland place history and all that shanghai be interest and of course hong kong owe a lot of its wealth to shanghai families who come after nineteen forty nine doesn't it i mean a lot of the shanghai moneyed families escape to hong kong didn't they
S0183	yeah they do yeah
S0180	they bring a lot of wealth and em
S0183	mm hm
S0180	business acumen but em it be interest yeah to see that oh don't cry baby he's have a little nightmares isn't he oh he's gotto go back to sleep so
S0183	his face be all great
S0180	he like sleep on his stomach though doesn't he
S0183	he do
S0180	what do it say in the book be it bad for the baby to sleep on their stomach on you i mean be it em be it
S0183	no
S0180	be it not because no it's only
S0183	i think
S0180	it's only if they're leave there
S0183	i think it's for long term for short term it doesn't really matter
S0180	mm
S0183	i mean
S0180	it's more comfortable for him
S0183	thirty forty years ago
S0180	after feed isn't it
S0183	it be it be it be eh recommend that you put them on their front so there's no danger of it but like your brother say em you get a bite out of breath
S0180	be that what say
S0183	that's what say yeah
S0180	oh i when he sleep as an adult yeah
S0183	yeah
S0180	as a baby we don't how they're feel but eh yeah
S0183	but no i think
S0180	so mm
S0183	they they feel okay sleep on their back as well
S0180	so the nct people have be in touch the about meet up again no
S0183	no i think they've get the idea that i don't wanna meet up so i don't think i'm be email anymore
S0180	really
S0183	yeah
S0180	you think they get that from the weekend meet
S0183	yeah
S0180	really
S0183	well yeah because they haven't email about wednesday well maybe they have maybe i don't know
S0180	oh they want to meet up this wednesday
S0183	yeah
S0180	cos they might just i suppose because they're home aren't they so they like to meet up every week
S0183	mm hm
S0180	because some of them be on their own aren't they they haven't get any family
S0183	yeah
S0180	so for them it's more important
S0183	cos i didn't think vanessa be that friendly
S0180	to you
S0183	yeah
S0180	really
S0183	which be fine you know i don't have to have you know
S0180	no i mean we didn't have to do the nct class do we i mean
S0183	i wish we hadn't
S0180	really
S0183	we'd have save ourselves three hundred pound
S0180	oh
S0183	well i want the information
S0180	well you didn't know at the time you didn't well do you think it be useful to get both of them the nhs and the nct class
S0183	i felt i felt a lot better with the information
S0180	mm
S0183	i didn't i didn't go there to make friends
S0180	no
S0183	i go there for the information
S0180	well yes i think other people in the group go there to make friends didn't they
S0183	mm hm
S0180	em
S0183	because you know as much as you read book you still get a different set of information when you attend a class
S0180	yeah
S0183	you know with the teacher and all
S0180	well that's right i mean em i mean it be useful but em yeah i mean just because you're in the same group as people you don't have to just cos you don't you don't necessarily hit it off with them i mean the men be alright but then i wouldn't say that they're that chatty or you know i mean i find the new zealand and australians generally a bite macho the men
S0183	mm
S0180	and if you don't sort of join in the banter without beer drink and all that which a lot of british people can be like that as well but you know em then you're not not exclude but oh but em you're not exclude but what i'm i try to say i mean there's no there's certain superficial conversation around beer you know and all that sort of stuff but
S0183	oh you know
S0180	they're okay i wouldn't say em i'll be best buddies within the year but eh
S0183	mm no i don't think i just think and also after they all go back to work will they still keep in touch
S0180	that's it yeah but i don't think that i don't think it's important for the men either cos we're all work presumably and when i have time off do they want to be meet up not really well i wouldn't say well i wouldn't personally
S0183	and also don't they have the other friends that they need to you know entertain
S0180	oh that's right
S0183	i mean i don't i can't be bother i mean you know
S0180	that's fine though em
S0183	i don't know i don't feel like i should pressure myself into think
S0180	yeah that's
S0183	i need to be friends with them
S0180	that's like when say oh see you in two weeks or something i think two weeks what do they mean by that
S0183	i mean cos doesn't work
S0180	yes
S0183	she can't work
S0180	right
S0183	and she's only move here for two years so she's usually you know want to make friends and meet people and
S0180	well yeah cos it be interest that she come there to these glass after have a child already you'd think they be for people who haven't have children yet
S0183	mm hm
S0180	but she's have a child and she didn't have them for her it's definitely where they're meet people isn't it
S0183	and also she know she be gonna have a caesarean
S0180	yeah that's right
S0183	em
S0180	well yes a double reason really for not go to nct class isn't it
S0183	mm hm
S0180	because but so yeah she be obviously there which be fine you know some people do want to make friends in those class but eh it's not for everyone be it em
S0183	no that's right
S0180	yeah but em that man's get strange glass hasn't he he look a bite like a richard o'brien from the crystal maze
S0183	mm
S0180	these super super fashionable glass you're right about the baby glass cos i saw a child this morning in a pram with these silly plastic glass on that didn't look as though they have lenses in and i think i think be the parent put them on as a fashion statement
S0183	no they're real glass
S0180	really
S0183	to correct their sight
S0180	but how do they know if the child's sight need correct at that young age
S0183	i don't know
S0180	it's ridiculous
S0183	maybe they go to opticians and
S0180	no but when the child's grow up when it's a toddler you need to give it time for its eye to grow into its you know face
S0183	i don't know
S0180	i only need glass when i be fourteen
S0183	i know i don't know what they're think they're probably think they're correct it them now
S0180	but that's so stupid when do you start wear glass
S0183	about fourteen as well
S0180	yeah so on average i think it's when you be just enter the teenage years be when most people
S0183	mm
S0180	and you can you know you can articulate that you need glass because you're sit at the back of the classroom squint at the blackboard or something
S0183	mm hm
S0180	but em if you're a toddler you can't say i need glass can you
S0183	mm shall we bath him tonight or not
S0180	i don't know i think he's he's out for the count at the moment isn't he so em let's see if it get to nine and he wake up em i'll bath him if not we can go straight to bed but when do we last bath him
S0183	not yesterday maybe the day before
S0180	it be the day before yesterday okay we should give him a bath now look at that car on the program em on the program that would be perfect for london because they're like a little it's like a little minivan and the japanese experts at em compactness aren't they that will be perfect for park in london streets and you can still get four or five six people in there with some luggage at the back they really know how to design in a compact way now if you look at cars in london now these stupid chelsea tractors
S0183	mm
S0180	but you know i mean they're not london streets be not design for them be they they just get in the way
S0183	no em i be go to say
S0180	why don't japanese company sell these sort of cars here
S0183	i think they be go to aren't they cos em
S0180	because they would be perfect for london streets which be cramp and you know you get into look at that it's a brilliant car
S0183	now what be i go to say oh god i've forget now
S0180	what em have you hear from and what they're have you hear from about how she's cop with em what's his name go back
S0183	yeah i think
S0180	oh that's not very good oh please go back to sleep oh
S0183	do you think you could i think i'll go and get a drink
S0180	okay wait let me so have go back already
S0183	go back for like maybe a couple of weeks or more now
S0180	oh
S0183	and i do call her two weeks after and eh she say she's try not to think about it she have a couple of interview telephone interview and
S0180	oh for job
S0183	for job and em
S0180	so she's do the rent in a by herself
S0183	she's at the moment she say it make sense to you know
S0180	they didn't have a mortgage
S0183	no yeah they never have a mortgage which be why one of the reason that all mount up to what
S0180	oh dear
S0183	this be all about really cos he never seem to really want to settle here so they never and he seem really happy they say they speak about you know they obviously speak a few time since he's be back
S0180	on on the phone he seem very happy
S0183	well he seem really happy and he keep ask her when she's go to join him
S0180	what
S0183	which be not go to happen because
S0180	well i think he i think they be separate
S0183	well i don't know what illusions he's em he's hold to
S0180	really
S0183	cos for her there's nothing for her so
S0180	no well she could probably get a good job translate or something like that couldn't she but she wouldn't want she doesn't want to do she
S0183	well no we'll i think she won't be able to have her work visa and then even after a work visa she might not get a permanent visa so
S0180	so they haven't really split split up or he think
S0183	well it's all
S0180	it's more about him be home sick
S0183	well and her not and also i think he he wasn't commit himself and financially it be a strain on her
S0180	right i see oh dear so em and
S0183	oh i don't know about i mean she's just buy a place no idea i don't she didn't really i didn't really get to the bottom of what what oh no i do know what the problem be but i don't know what be happen right now
S0180	mm
S0183	again
S0180	you don't don't keep in touch regularly do you i mean i mean every not every week
S0183	not every week so yeah but i like to visit her flat her flat look great
S0180	oh she's send you photos
S0183	i saw photos on her phone
S0180	oh wow where be it again they buy
S0183	wapping
S0180	oh yeah there be some nice big flats down there
S0183	and i think she's get one of them
S0180	wow so yeah why don't you go with for a day trip
S0183	well i can't because she hasn't settle yet cos she only
S0180	eventually
S0183	eventually yeah
S0180	or something
S0183	no eventually i want to take get out by myself
S0180	yeah i know you will i know so at the moment you're watch more em
S0183	tv series
S0180	tv series
S0183	i'm re watch this one it's call heart of grace
S0180	these be your dvds from hong kong
S0183	yeah
S0180	i see
S0183	well no the series be from hong kong but i buy them from em this malaysia
S0180	right
S0183	em internet place
S0180	so what what what be the main storylines generally what do they tend to be about
S0183	they tend to be just about families and you know in in all of that they'll be in the ones i watch anyway there's lot of different genres but the ones i watch tend to be about families
S0180	mm
S0183	and within the families they'll be like arguments or argue about money argue about eh inheritance say but and then in in all of that they'll be em romance there's always gonna be a romance it might be a a love triangle or things or something like that em
S0180	a lot of them seem to deal with these em like small company or something
S0183	yeah or
S0180	it seem to be a continuous theme from my casual observation of it like a small business
S0183	yeah like say eh you know you know someone just get the job and they've get this really difficult task to do
S0180	yeah
S0183	and it's like an impossible task then always someone come along to help them which in reality won't happen of course
S0180	mm
S0183	but it's not
S0180	like a fairy godmother type
S0183	yeah it's always like a fairy godmother type but you know no no one take these series as real obviously no one think that they're realistic
S0180	no
S0183	or believe in or you know like it be actually a bite very fairy tale like like this man he's help this woman unconditionally you know
S0180	so as a as a as a comparison maybe it compare with neighbour
S0183	no
S0180	be it less or more serious
S0183	it's even less serious
S0180	it's even less serious than neighbour
S0183	yeah
S0180	right
S0183	it's it's just fantasy really
S0180	right
S0183	which even though it play out like
S0180	mm
S0183	or or normal everyday life be be it's just about
S0180	more cartoonish
S0183	it be actually it be very cartoonish because because it play out it's just impossible
S0180	do you think psychologically it appeal to what hong kong people want their situations to be or be it total escapism
S0183	i think it's just total escapism
S0180	okay right
S0183	hong kong people be too realistic for that
S0180	be they
S0183	yeah i mean even if you you know if you watch any you know none of them be real you know none of them because in term of the time scale i mean okay let's not put a time to it you know in term of what happen but you know people and their attitude like it's not it's not mean to be real and em
S0180	so what who be the target audience be it very much housewives
S0183	i think it's em
S0180	be it female and housewives
S0183	and young children like
S0180	young children
S0183	ten yeah
S0180	really so young children to and their mother to watch it at the same time
S0183	yeah
S0180	it's target at that audience
S0183	because when i come to the uk and i be seven and a half and
S0180	you watch them with your mum
S0183	the week no let me finish please
S0180	oh sorry sorry
S0183	don't try to guess
S0183	em no the week we fly we come to england there be this really big series cos it be come out it be really advertise and everything
S0180	mm
S0183	and i be like oh my god we're gonna miss it but we didn't because where we live someone deliver stuff to us and deliver tap
S0180	oh
S0183	which be part of the they have a a centre in china town which these tap and everything they give to people
S0180	distribution centre
S0183	yeah
S0180	right
S0183	and then we would watch all the series and it be only seven and eight so and then and so it's target at young people really really really young people and teenagers you know
S0180	right
S0183	it's because it's the teenagers who become fan of these uprise star you know so and then these star you know they'd be like these star will be singers as well and then they'll be fan club and things
S0180	you can do a phd on no i'm serious you can do a phd on tvb series the appeal of them and you can go around interview people
S0183	good
S0180	and why people watch them yeah
S0183	well i'm off to
S0180	that's if you've do sociology
S0183	well it's quite interest because a few years ago i meet this girl who be gonna have a year's experience at at the tvb at the moment at the time which be only one studio
S0180	mm
S0183	non non pay they'd just be work i be really happy to go there
S0180	voluntary
S0183	voluntary but now recently there's another em cos it tvb have a have a monopoly
S0180	mm
S0183	on like
S0180	on soap operas
S0183	on soap operas and they do have a years ago they do have another eh rival but they didn't they didn't
S0180	but they can't be the only channel who make soap operas in hong kong be they
S0183	ah i think they might be i mean for while they might be but let me finish cos i be say a few years ago there be this em eh the rival em studio and they produce em series as well and but they weren't very popular
S0180	mm
S0183	and they be buy these big star from tvb
S0180	i see
S0183	and this this the series be not not very good or
S0180	mm
S0183	it wasn't very popular and then they start promote these star uprise star that weren't even good look and
S0180	right
S0183	eh i think they go bankrupt anyway and then em now i think there's lot of these tv series tv studios open up
S0180	right you mean private ones so it's be deregulate
S0183	i think so i think so and then now they be then in talk with these real establish star to come over or it could be a situation where i don't know whether you know this em in hollywood on the nineteen twenty thirty forties em a star be have a seven year contract with one studio
S0180	mm
S0183	and they're not allow to make any film
S0180	with the other studios right okay
S0183	apart from when the management allow them to be loan to the different studios
S0180	right
S0183	so now
S0180	be he wake up no
S0183	i think it's a bite like that where in hong kong the management sign you up for you know four five years and you're not allow to work with you know
S0180	oh i see it's the same as if you sign with itv or bbc or whatever
S0183	yeah
S0180	okay
S0183	and now a lot of star be be be be be em want in in hong kong want to be eh on pay per series
S0180	right cos they want more freedom
S0183	more freedom
S0180	right
S0183	cos obviously now
S0180	yeah yeah
S0183	a lot of them have go to em have go to china
S0180	right really
S0183	yes they have cos they all get pay a lot more you know i don't know how much more maybe ten time more
S0180	but you mean make cantonese language ones be guangzhou or they learn mandarin
S0183	we'll i'm not sure cos cos what happen be be that they could be so they couldn't be make a series in well this be what i think cos i've never actually see one they could make make a series in in in in the mainland where the mandarin where the mainland star speak mandarin and then hong kong star speak cantonese
S0180	and they redub them
S0183	and they dub them
S0180	right i think i've see that happen yeah
S0183	yeah
S0180	i think i saw a few when i be teach english there yeah
S0183	because i have see one or two only clip of mainline mainland oh excuse me series that be show on the em on the satellite
S0180	right
S0183	and the cantonese be speak cantonese and then the mainland star have be dub
S0180	have be dub yes it's the other way yeah yeah
S0183	so you know one series could be sale sell yeah
S0180	yeah
