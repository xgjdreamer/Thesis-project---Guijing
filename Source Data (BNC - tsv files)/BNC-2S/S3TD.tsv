S0247	so i've be look at superstitions for a class tomorrow
S0248	okay
S0247	you believe in in good luck and bad luck don't you
S0248	erm i believe in good luck and bad but i know it's something you can just perceive you you can get down on yourself and think erm you know i never get any luck but i and i and i believe statements like i make your own luck certainly but just outrageous bits of bad fortune don't happen to everyone the an accident
S0247	mm
S0248	or something that you couldn't've foresee or er but but i do believe that some people if you put yourself in a situation too often you that you're unlucky if bad things happen to you and if you keep do the wrong things or things that you know be a fifty fifty you know chance or or worse that you're gonna come and you can you can have a bad run of of do seemingly
S0247	things go wrong yeah
S0248	things seem go wrong so i think it's just something that if you if you do the right things then it will presume or or certainly other people think oh he's a lucky person because he's he you know he's put himself in that position to get luck and and it's more likely to be good than bad
S0247	yeah
S0248	because the ps the place he's put himself be be a good place so
S0247	yeah do you walk under ladder and things like that
S0248	no i don't i i yes i i wouldn't say i deliberately do it but i really erm i really don't believe in that sort of thing i mean apart from the fact that if any you go to any close to a build site or what have you there's more chance of a bucket fall on you than than than if you be not walk
S0247	yeah it's kind of erm you know but but if you break a mirror for example would you immediately think oh that's good you know that's seven years bad luck
S0248	no i wouldn't
S0247	no
S0248	i don't think mind you i i've never actually test it on myself
S0248	cos i don't think i've ever actually break one
S0247	yeah be your parent superstitious do they throw salt over their shoulder and stuff like that
S0248	no no
S0247	no
S0248	pepper not salt
S0247	you be joke
S0248	mm
S0247	yeah and
S0248	yeah
S0247	and what about erm in gamble what sort of things do you do to bring luck

S0247	do you cross your finger or
S0248	i tell you what actually i keep win and i i give to beggar anyway
S0247	yeah
S0248	but er not all the time but sometimes and but but i i keep win and i think to myself that i go inside of on the same place and and give money two or three time
S0247	mm
S0248	to this guy and one time he wasn't even ask for any money
S0248	he be just he didn't he didn't have a cup or a bowl or what have you he be sit with his legs you know bunch up in front of him
S0247	right and presumably you recognise him do you
S0248	yeah well no i no i'm not even sure it be the same man
S0247	oh
S0248	but due to the fact that i'd actually think hello i'm be er you know sort of pay back here for for be er nice and generous
S0247	right
S0248	but i think this be absolute nonsense and i didn't wanna go one day through that side and i be a bite later and i want to go through the centre of the station and i be gonna go out to the side to give this bloke some money
S0247	mm
S0248	i i don't even know if he be there or not and i think don't be so silly i go down there and still win so
S0247	oh you still win oh okay yeah
S0248	still win er er so er
S0247	mm
S0248	you know that that be good
S0247	yeah
S0248	that be good that that something have happen yeah
S0247	yeah that you do it what about in the bet shop generally do people do things to for luck you know do you see people go through rituals or anything
S0248	oh they do erm they complain about their back luck by kick the machine and er swear at the telly and what have you no i think it's er i think you get it more it it's er in sport where one person always put always to go out last or he
S0247	mm

S0247	oh like a footballer yeah

S0247	yeah
S0248	er all this sort of stuff
S0247	yeah
S0248	or have a lucky you know what people have a
S0247	i think i remember bjorn borg didn't he
S0248	mm
S0247	have a ritual i think he didn't shave for the whole of wimbledon
S0248	they probably
S0247	so he always end the wimbledon fortnight with a little beard
S0248	yeah they they

S0247	like what
S0248	well that's he's say that's exactly what superstitions be
S0247	yeah but it
S0248	he's say he's not though then he didn't go on to say what they be
S0247	oh okay yeah
S0248	but it be just the fact be it you know it be exactly
S0247	yes
S0248	what er
S0247	yeah
S0248	yeah and so he be say that he be superstitious yeah
S0247	yeah
S0248	what about you and luck you don't er
S0247	i don't believe in it at all i just think it's everything's a coincidence really but some it's it's quite useful to have erm a way to refer to you know bad coincidences and that so you know if you if if something if you happen to pick the wrong day you know the of of er a month of brilliant sunshine and you you're have a garden party and you happen to have choose the day that it pour down with rain then
S0248	mm
S0247	you'll think of that as bad luck won't you
S0248	it's just it be bad luck
S0247	yeah
S0248	though isn't it but it's not
S0247	yeah
S0248	there's nothing no no one's
S0247	but you haven't bring it upon yourself or
S0248	no one you haven't bring on yourself no one's pick
S0247	yeah
S0248	on you it's just some things good happen to you and some things bad happen to you
S0247	yeah and you can't do anything about it so you
S0248	but if keep happen to you start get to think oh god dear why's this
S0247	you know do you remember that erm friends of mum and dad's call unlucky
S0248	yes i didn't i never meet him i hear you say it
S0247	no i i think i only meet him once or twice but he have erm all his life have have the most awful bad luck and you know if if he try to do anything that when he i think they tell us when he be in the army the soldier use to get up to all sort of you know little things erm bend the rule and that sort of thing you know but if ever this unlucky try it you know he would
S0248	yeah
S0247	always get catch or he'd he'd choose the night that they be be inspect or you know things like that and erm and he be forever in plaster you know he'd turn up to meet them
S0248	i remember i don't i remember you say about him or i remember your dad say about this unlucky
S0247	mm
S0248	i don't know if you
S0247	mm
S0248	you but the fact be whether they be laugh with him at him or whether they actually believe it or you know whether
S0247	no they say you you can't believe how unlucky somebody that you so many things go wrong in his life that he he
S0248	yeah he yeah yeah yeah mm
S0247	and he be about sixty or so so you know he be just use i suppose
S0248	he trade on you know on the end er in the end doesn't he you know
S0247	yeah yeah but you know it be it make good chat you know good good stories and so on but
S0248	oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0247	maybe they weren't all true
S0248	mm
S0247	erm a a lot of people have lucky colour and lucky number for do the lottery and that kind of thing
S0248	yeah
S0247	erm and obviously when you get marry you have the something old something new something borrow something blue stuff and and horse shoe and things like that
S0248	yeah i mean i really
S0247	but
S0248	cos once you get into those things
S0247	well they're just symbols really they're not actually you know nobody really believe they're go to bring luck oh if you haven't get the something borrow or
S0248	mm
S0247	something blue that's gonna be erm you know bad luck for the future
S0248	just actually it's erm
S0247	it's just like a ritual isn't it
S0248	in the end you think look why don't i just go along with it
S0247	yeah
S0248	you know
S0247	yeah
S0248	you know and then really because if something do happen
S0247	yes
S0248	i might find myself think well i be a bite silly why didn't i just you know i
S0247	yeah
S0248	i don't i know it's all daft but er you just don't really wanna get into those things
S0247	no and and of course to prove how daft the whole thing be
S0248	mm
S0247	if you ask people internationally about black cat
S0248	mm mm
S0247	you know they're they're mostly bad luck but in our country they're good luck
S0248	and and we have say lucky number seven or what
S0247	yeah
S0248	have you or the unlucky thirteen but
S0247	yes
S0248	they're not exactly the same the world over apparently
S0247	er well i don't know about the other countries other than italy but in italy it's erm the unlucky day be seventeenth not thirteenth
S0248	mm kay
S0247	and i've i might be make this up by i've get an idea it's tuesday not friday so tuesday the seventeenth not friday the thirteenth
S0248	mm
S0247	but i don't know if you know
S0248	erm australians use to have a unlucky number at cricket
S0247	oh right what be that then
S0248	eighty seven or something or or it or or it come to if it wasn't eighty seven seventy eight so
S0247	yeah
S0248	either they would lose a wicket at eighty seven or what have you
S0247	i'm sorry i'm not quite sure what i whether i understand that
S0248	well when they when the team have score eighty seven they
S0247	oh okay
S0248	be worry until they get off the number
S0247	right
S0248	because it's something would seem to happen when they score eighty seven someone someone have actually suddenly realise kinda we'd just score hundred i'm just out what's the score hundred and seventy four
S0247	right
S0248	and someone'd go well someone'd go that's two eighty sevens innit
S0247	oh right okay
S0248	or or two hundred and sixty one
S0247	yeah that that's like three eighty sevens
S0248	yeah
S0247	yeah
S0248	so you can make what you want of that but you know
S0247	you'd have be good at arithmetic
S0248	but or or or any australian at cricket well actually it might not be eighty seven it might be eighty nine but
S0247	so it's a number like that
S0248	there be a number
S0247	yeah
S0248	that you know if you think oh christ now eighty seven you know
S0247	yeah
S0248	you know you'd be very please if you've personally score eighty seven and you get a single to take you onto eighty eight
S0247	right
S0248	you'd be very please
S0247	right and what about
S0248	yeah
S0247	erm other sport be it just cricket or
S0248	no well that's just different things and i suppose some of
S0247	you know be it but be it like a general number
S0248	some of them back erm erm probably say do you know do you know the number of time we've lose a wicket or at the number eighty seven and then you know it just get one of those things that that just escalate you know
S0247	oh okay mm yes yeah
S0248	i mean obviously there's nothing in it
S0247	yes
S0248	but the fact be you know
S0247	yeah
S0248	it's cricketers boringly they've score ninety you know to get to a hundred at cricket
S0247	yeah sure
S0248	to get to a hundred be a milestone
S0247	yeah
S0248	so blokes play quite beautifully freely until they get to ninety
S0247	yes
S0248	and then suddenly they get worry
S0247	yeah
S0248	because they've gotta score the last ten run they call it the nervous nineties
S0247	right okay
S0248	okay so the fact be you could put that like like i be i be down i be on ninety five and i get out because you're not play your normal game because you're worry er that you'll get
S0247	yes cos of because of the
S0248	as soon as you get to a hundred and one you start play normal cricket
S0247	yes
S0248	what how daft be that
S0247	yes
S0248	and the same be same with someone say christ boy chap you're on eighty seven so you start play daft you wanna get off you wanna hit a ball you shouldn't hit or it
S0247	yeah yes
S0248	so it's everything
S0247	yeah and i and i think that's a bite like in erm in snooker match be it terry griffiths who always wear his red shirt because he'd have a couple of win wear this red shirt
S0248	oh yeah yeah i don't know how many he have of these red shirt
S0247	it wasn't just the one then
S0248	well no but the thing be that they lose as well obviously
S0247	yeah
S0248	don't they
S0247	yeah
S0248	there be a horse race trainer who would always wear a red shirt
S0247	yeah
S0248	now the fact be well you know but the fact be he must've have bad days when he if he wear it all the time
S0247	yeah
S0248	he must've have a lot of bad days when he be wear the red shirt
S0247	mm
S0248	you know so in the end it's all a bite
S0247	yes
S0248	you know i suppose he have even worse luck if he doesn't wear it
S0247	yeah i know but but i suppose if you're and you want to give you maximise your chance then you know
S0248	you'd you would
S0247	you'd wear your lucky red shirt yeah
S0248	you'll feel happy i suppose with yourself no i i can't no if i don't do well but i can't least i can't blame my shirt i have these fortuitous underpants didn't i do you remember
S0247	oh yes your lucky underpants that's true but they weren't red though be they
S0248	yeah yeah no i forget what they be and in fact i don't think there be cos obviously you know i think i have more than one pair
S0247	i know and you you forget in the end which one will they be
S0248	yeah i don't yeah yeah
S0247	yeah yes yeah
S0248	so you can imagine how easily it can get a grip of you know this sort of stuff
S0247	yes yes i'm glad i'm not a slave to it but the erm mrs who i use to erm go berserk if anybody put an umbrella up in the office really you know she she would've say i she didn't believe in superstitions but if anybody put an umbrella up she'd go put it get it down get it down you know so some of it's just kind of ingrain you know
S0248	mm
S0247	train or something
S0248	mm mm yeah i know
