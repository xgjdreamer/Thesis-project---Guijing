S0202	ah
S0211	yeah but i be in the taxi erm and i go to erm just go check my phone and it wasn't in my bag so i ask the taxi driver erm after he drop me off to erm look under all of the seat and i have a look under the seat and i couldn't find anything and we open up the boot and push the seat back and there be definitely nothing in there so erm then i message my mum who be just to let her know that the phone have be take and erm my friends try ring it a few time and it just go straight through to voice mail which be strange because i have like sixty percent battery on it mm mm and we try ring it quite a few time and still erm nothing other than my voice mail erm my mum ring erm my mum ring the company and erm block the sim card erm and then i imagine she contact you erm and that be erm saturday morning uhu erm and i i don't have the er find my iphone activate on my phone but i could still erm put it to where it say a message the phone have be lose erm please ring this number with a contact number but obviously nobody's contact nobody's use it erm nobody erm contact me or anything with it so yeah erm and then just be wait on a phone call from yourselves to sort out the insurance go into erm just to make sure that it definitely be the sim card have definitely be block and i speak to apple support erm just to make sure that nobody could get into the phone without obviously erm put it onto itunes and restore it to factory settings erm so that that yeah that's essentially what happen that's fine
S0211	alright okay i have to ring the police as well i do get a log number for it and i do that on saturday morning
S0211	yeah no worry thank you i'm on hold
S0202	oh right do you reckon they're gonna pay out then
S0211	i hope so i need a new phone i don't need a new phone i need an iphone or a different phone with my sim card on it you know
S0202	i mean like even though the block they can't they can't use it so there's nothing they can do with it except sell it abroad
S0211	yeah they can restore it to factory settings erm but i mean if somebody start use it like i say the ime whatever the fuck number have be report to the police
S0202	right
S0211	so
S0202	that'll be block then they can't use it even if they restore it to factory settings they can get on to it but they can't use it as a phone they can use it as a fancy ipod
S0211	mm
S0202	that's it there's they can't put a sim card in and use it unless they're plan on take it abroad or sell it abroad
S0211	yeah
