S0355	i know i know oh it's so nice meet a woman just nice woman even if she be with a boyfriend
S0281	well i could put a wig on and put some lipstick on if that'll help
S0355	yeah yeah she be a councillor i say what er do if it's not a rude question what be it you do erm she say i'm a councillor i say what for the local council she and she say no i'm a private counsellor you know er i counsel people on their problems i go oh right
S0281	oh like a
S0355	and
S0281	psychiatrist almost
S0355	erm
S0281	therapy
S0355	well counsel be a something a skill that we all have once and we've lose we give it away due to manners and civility and i mean i still think you need to have manners because it's in the society and they're all different accord to different societies
S0281	absolutely
S0355	erm but we give a lot through religion we give away erm earth religions which erm er be interest i go to celebrations on solstices quite often
S0281	uhu
S0355	and erm that's interest to to look into i i i find that fascinate and then we the the other thing we give we give that away to er domination of religion which be control spiritual philosophy and counsel i think we give away to it be rob from us it be we be we're not teach it in school we should be teach it in school i think
S0281	yeah
S0355	we should be teach how to counsel each other
S0281	do you think kid could handle it though
S0355	yes i think they're the they know it's they know it's the right way impulsively cos it be the right way
S0281	instinctively
S0355	instinctively yes what's the difference between an impulse and an instinct
S0281	impulse be an immediate reaction
S0355	right so it's a
S0281	and
S0355	reaction
S0281	yeah
S0355	right
S0281	i mean and and i those things you see when you checkout at the supermarket the they're call impulse purchase
S0355	yes
S0281	and you do it on the spur of the moment
S0355	of course
S0281	it's not pre plan
S0355	oh i see
S0281	you do something on impulse you do it oh i fancy that i'll do it
S0355	yeah
S0281	i mean instinct be something that erm be intrinsic i think in us that probably be pass down through our dna somehow like animal instinct
S0355	yes
S0281	when a an animal be bear very often or depend on the species of course it can get up and start walk immediately
S0355	yes
S0281	by instinct
S0355	they say a lot of it be well someone say to me once and i tend to agree with them and it may be a column i'm sure there have be load of millions of book write on it but breakdowns essentially occur in human be when they're tell and and er when they're tell that if they behave in a certain way their life will work for them get a job be responsible stand up for your country do all these things erm and life will be alright
S0281	mm
S0355	and they get to midlife and they realise that their life isn't work and they've forget the spiritual aspect of their life you know their spirit their spirit be something that be within them and want to do things and er be be basically a joyful thing spirit's a joyful thing it's the joy within us the spirit of man it's not a not a not a something outside of us it's something i think it be with er with a yeah spirit of god i think be everywhere we've just get to open ourselves to it erm and many religions preach that or or teach that and but i think the way that they cloak it all be in mystery and superstition and er
S0281	dogma
S0355	dogma and er all these bloody things yeah but the man or woman get to a point in their live especially in men with the work ethic they get to the a point in their live where they say my life isn't work and i'm do but i'm do all the right things that society say be the way to go and it's not we we're we're drive by market force and we're drive by the fact that we have to rent a house from the landlord or buy a house at er a great proportion of our wage rob us essentially of time because money be time and time be money we change our we exchange our time on this earth for money they're units of time and erm
S0281	so where do you think in that lie the the clich√© of midlife crisis
S0355	er well i think a man get to a time when basically he should have have more fun i think you know and er it happen i suspect generally forties fifties
S0281	mm
S0355	and er it's just the time that it happen it happen in younger erm people who be in their twenties you know when they're when they're work against themselves really they're they're the the deeper psyche they're on their subconscious or unconscious mind subconscious mind they're er part of them i don't know all the part the ego the id the subconscious the conscious the that's all part of the mind but part of the human be that they're restrict through live their live in a particular way er through compromise erm er just isn't be feed isn't be nurture it's be put on the backburner and all the time we say i'll go on holiday next year i'll do this later in my life i when i'm get enough money to do it
S0281	mm
S0355	i'll do this then and er and the force that be or the way that things go say that money be always the factor you know kid naturally look for party and place to dance and enjoy and rejoice and the police go and stop these party they say oh drug be involve yeah well you know traditionally drug have always be involve in party
S0281	yeah
S0355	from the year dot so erm er
S0281	but it's be separate isn't it from er his er mystical element to just get out of your mind but without any specific purpose other than to get out of your mind
S0355	yeah
S0281	i be think in particular remember carlos castaneda's book like when he's trip on peyote
S0355	oh right er what be the book call
S0281	oh i think he do several i can't remember
S0355	yes
S0281	a particular one at the moment i mean the main character's call carlos or something but it's it's set in i think it be set in mexico or texas or somewhere like that and it be about his mystical experience under the the influence of this drug mm well at least the legislation have start to change in a lot of place isn't it
S0355	yeah like but
S0281	mm better late than never
S0355	yeah but again it's be by capitalists to make money if you look all all the all the erm it's the way that the americans have now legalise cannabis a you've get to have a medical condition to be able to warrant your possession of it and usage of it
S0281	mm
S0355	and probably b grow it be still illegal so
S0281	yeah
S0355	again they they they again the er the mean of production
S0281	they wanna control the mean of production yeah
S0355	have be take away from the workers you know
S0281	mm
S0355	as everything you er that's be do er you could say it's from the use of herbicides where we could go er get gather herbs in the countryside to the erm introduction of myxomatosis the and the countryman's food in the rabbit have now be poison so there's very few ways that you the the the common land that you could farm and fee your animals on or even build a house on under circumstances have be take away from us and so er er they give clever reason for it all but essentially erm it's they're all ways that have either intentionally or unintentionally take away free food free live from
S0281	yeah
S0355	from people erm it's it's all part of a plan that we be enslave totally
S0355	we have to pay for everything even water
S0281	yeah
S0355	and this be the big thing go on in third world countries now that er people like coca cola be move their plant to india where they have only a limit amount of water and the grind water now be pollute by what coca cola do and the products that coca cola make instead of be drink but the local population and pass through their body and put back in the grind it that doesn't happen in that area so it even deplete the groundwater more erm so er and the coca cola be sell hundreds of miles or thousands of miles away so er the it go on without the regard of the vidual with er with right you know you know continually there be people in this world work out ways of how to charge people for things how they can make money out of everything charge for every single thing and that erm and that's not right when we're bear onto this planet we're bear with right that er you know it's it's your world it's no one own it but the capitalists own it now so and now the the capitalists be buy up small farm there won't be any small farm in fifty years' time they'll all be run by big corporations
S0281	mm
S0355	all the animals be farm in build pig the cattle all farm inside sheep
S0281	yes i think we we be lucky in our generation to to have be bear when we be cos i wouldn't like to be grow up now
S0355	no well i'm still grow up now
S0281	yeah i'm still wonder what i'm gonna do when i grow up
S0355	yes
S0355	oh
S0281	me
S0355	what's your take on it
S0281	well i think most of what you've say be absolutely true it's erm we seem to be our er as as you say it's erm all of our natural bear freedoms be gradually be erode be be control more and more i mean look at the society we in we're in we're lucky in many respect to be in the society we're live in look at the amount of people try to get here er illegally so they can benefit from it but er it's think er when you think this be one of the best place to live and all the things that be wrong with it the things we can't do more and more control over us more and more spy on us that have er come to light in the last few years the whistle blowers you see i america the er the time limit on the erm on the er er american government's er legal right to snoop on people's private email have now expire so and like they now can't do do that unless they they get apply for a specific permission but i saw an on a programme not long ago in the uk when er the police or government erm apply for the the the legal right to do this to its citizens it's it's mm almost automatically grant in ninety six percent of the case and they've never be more er surveillance you know the cctvs and er i'm sure there's lot of things that be gonna come to light sooner or later that they're do now mm spy on us but we've still get the right to a certain degree of to go out on the street get up on your soapbox and say what you like more or less i think in china that erm they're not allow to have meet of more than six people or something like that at er in any one place unless they've get police permission but that's gonna be an interest case sooner or later because the the generation that's now start to reproduce and er they've grow up in a in a society although strictly control by the government erm they're expect more and more freedoms so that's it's a lot of people think that sooner or later there's gonna be a revolution there but er i don't know it's er they've get such a tight control on everything on everybody
S0355	that's yeah and most of the governments in the world it doesn't bode well for the future it be interest watch that programme inside the medieval mind the other day
S0281	oh yeah
S0355	after he mention what if you remember he mention what happen after the black death
S0281	i don't think i be watch it
S0355	yeah you watch it
S0281	do i
S0355	sit there and watch how the how the peasants be treat and
S0281	oh right yeah
S0355	and one thing he you know what they could do to serfs they serfs you work for the person and that be it for the rest of your life and er
S0281	mm
S0355	you be enslave to them basically you couldn't say well i don't want to work on your land anymore you couldn't do that you er your children be bear into serfdom so it it be that be all all pretty scary and horrible wasn't it so erm what er happen after the black death be that the erm because there be there wasn't the labour it kill so many people that there wasn't the labour leave in the in the land
S0281	oh
S0355	so then er you find that the the serfs well they give the instance of a plough man who say no i i want more money and i want better live condition to plough your land and i shall go elsewhere to find it and that black death have an effect on the on the system so all i can think of be well you know it's now maybe we're so control because we're overpopulate and they find they fear that if there be a revolution by the work man er they would be swamp wouldn't they and so they have to control them even tighter it's interest listen to that mm er there be a guy on on the on youtube i don't know if it be noam chomsky but he be say that people er when they erm why people aren't vote be because er i think he be talk about democracy and capitalism he be say so many people er don't vote because they they believe they're powerless anyway it's they're they're they're not go to be listen to anyway and it's only erm er and the governments aren't do anything or the english government isn't do anything and the american government for the dispossess the poor
S0281	mm
S0355	and the ones who haven't get money
S0281	mm
S0355	which be become the greater amount of people in the country
S0281	mm
S0355	even the middle class there be suffer so he's erm er er so he be talk about england and i would imagine america that erm the er be a democracy it doesn't count for anything because they're not make the laws that benefit the people of the country
S0281	mm
S0355	you know the country and the government should be there to benefit the people
S0281	mm
S0355	not just the privilege few
S0281	mm
S0355	or the bankers
S0281	that's just a bite one side isn't it cos er for big
S0355	well
S0281	big business
S0355	mm he's great to listen to noam chomsky
S0281	yeah oh he be
S0355	i think he's jewish isn't he
S0281	yeah
S0355	yeah a good you wanna hear what he have to say about israel
S0281	mm
S0355	be just get rid of it if it bomb the lot of it wipe it off the face of the earth
S0281	well if anybody do dare that dare do that they'd take a hell of a lot of people with them suppose to have about a hundred and eighty missiles at the moment
S0355	well
S0281	and they don't admit to it but
S0355	israel's be experiment with dirty bomb
S0281	yeah
S0355	have you see that
S0281	yeah i saw that the other night
S0355	they've they've test about five or six dirty bomb so they let go of a dirty bomb and then they go and see what what it's cause what damage it's cause and so i suppose that information could be use in several ways one way be what damage you can inflict on your enemy maybe a to create a radiate buffer state around you irradiate buffer state rather and er or whether you can er develop a non dirty bomb through those process but that's what they've be test non dirty bomb to see how non dirty they be not dirty bomb to see how dirty they be do you get my drift why test the bomb to see how dirty it be unless you think well we'll see if someone send one here who i don't can't imagine it's no one i don't think any of their enemies er have get any nuclear weapons pakistan might have pakistan
S0281	mm
S0355	pakistan's get some i think
S0281	mm
S0355	but erm oh yeah how do we attempt to clean up or how do we er what's gonna happen if we we do let this go on all these other state what effect what will we have to deal with in what in what it will be essentially land that we we now claim as victors
S0281	mm
S0355	i don't know but but er i don't know why test the dirty bomb see you're good at chess so you've get that sort of mind haven't you to
S0281	well i wish i be
S0355	well
S0355	it's only they say er erm it's like a game of war isn't it chess they say
S0281	yeah mm yeah i wish i be good at it
S0355	well you've get an idea of the principles haven't you
S0281	yeah
S0355	i do this you do that
S0281	mm
S0355	that's what life be isn't it or conflict er you know who come out with one piece leave or two piece leave
S0281	mm oh i've give up play for the moment
S0355	you be play yesterday
S0281	no i be just study
S0355	oh right do you find do you go through periods where you you play and play and play and then you stop and then you can er have a an epiphany or or a leap forward and things seem better after you've have a
S0281	i do i i give up for eight months
S0355	yeah
S0281	a couple of years ago and erm er i i get better mm
S0355	right
S0281	so
S0355	be that strange i suppose the the mind must process it all
S0281	mm
S0355	all the info and
S0281	yeah
S0355	they say you can ask your mind a question and it'll come up i've i practice do that a lot
S0281	yeah
S0355	well if i can't remember something i think right i'll think on that
S0281	mm sleep on it
S0355	and i just i i don't even consciously do it i put i say i'll think on that i'll think on that i'll try and see if i can remember and it go in there and bugger me quite often nine time out of ten i think
S0281	mm
S0355	or even more the the answer come out
S0281	mm
S0355	it's er you know trust in the subconscious unconscious i don't know
S0281	the universe
S0355	god it might be all a bite weirder than we imagine
S0281	yeah a lot of people believe we have to unlearn everything before we start learn
S0355	mm maybe we should have a game of something tonight of scrabble no don't feel like it
S0281	i don't feel like it no
S0355	okay
S0281	but thank you for offer my apologies if i don't
S0355	that's alright
S0281	you pick a fine time to leave me lucille with four hungry kid and a crop in the field i've have some bad time
S0355	mm
S0281	i wake up at half past six this morning
S0355	what do you do i hear you up early i don't know how early that be
S0281	er well when i finally realise around eight o'clock i wasn't go to get back to sleep
S0281	erm and decide to finish my lesson plan for tomorrow
S0355	do you keep your lesson plan
S0281	well usually no erm
S0355	oh
S0281	i i i should have do i do from er the last lesson erm so

S0281	well yeah i do
S0355	just correct the fault that
S0281	well yeah
S0355	or the weak point that you find
S0281	mm but erm it's not really like a what you might call a normal lesson it's er
S0355	yeah
S0281	basically there to tient and to entertain the kid er
S0355	and to encourage them to take interest in english
S0281	er yeah and get them get them use english but it's er yeah but it i'm sure it'll be nice er just to get in the classroom again
S0355	what do you enjoy most about be in the classroom oh bugger
S0281	i think to a certain extent similar to what you do when when you work er do something that you're reasonably good at and er do it well so you get appreciate for what you do i think that's basically it it's horrible when you get a a class who have get no interest you know and that's why they teach chinese people be such a usually such a joy cos the they're so eager to learn i don't think i could be a teacher in england you know er in the state system
S0355	teach english or
S0281	well teach anything it well the
S0355	but you be a teacher in england
S0281	well but in the state system it wouldn't be teach english as a foreign language it wouldn't be efl or esl

S0355	punch you in the nose
S0281	well just give me a thump well he try to i i avoid it mm
S0355	yeah
S0281	but it work i didn't i don't think i do it again yes i've still get this one of the rare things i'm proud of be that it's reach this ripe old age and er i still haven't hit anybody or be hit
S0355	yes
S0281	i don't many people can say that a lot of it be cowardice
S0281	i use to dread go cos of go home from school sometimes and you'd see some kid you think might be trouble and try and avoid them
S0355	yeah
S0281	still i think it be an amaze record
S0355	yeah
S0281	especially when in my adult life i be for what eighteen years in the east and a couple of years here work in pubs you know as a landlord and
S0355	yes be you ever threaten
S0281	and er oh yeah when i first take over
S0355	yes
S0281	erm i have to get rid of most of the customers i inherit it be such a rough
S0355	really
S0281	yeah local mafia and the lot and have a gun point in my face er but even throw people out be which i i have to do occasionally
S0355	what do you
S0281	i
S0355	do when the guy point the gun in your face
S0281	what could i do just stand there and somehow i always manage to talk my way out of trouble very lucky be a good help a great help in that respect cos often a woman can do things a bloke can't and to get obnoxious people out
S0355	yeah
S0281	she do well bless her and this remind me i've get to send those bloody form off and my birth certificate so she can start chase the bank up the erm insurance company up
S0355	yes
S0281	i'll have to do that this week i think friday should be get my ticket soon i ask to to get me some time in the first week in july
S0355	how much do that cost do you reckon
S0281	i dunno come over here be only sixty quid
S0355	amaze
S0281	and it cost me another sixty for the extra baggage i have
S0355	yeah
S0281	but er i'd imagine it would be about the same it would be great if it be to save a bite of money could be on standby of course so i might have if i'm unlucky i might have to wait around a bite
S0355	oh what like a couple of days sort of thing
S0281	i don't know i i think normally they try and get you on the next flight you know if you can't get on so but if er if er choose wisely in the middle of the week it should be alright hopefully yeah it'll be weird get back there
S0355	what's that
S0281	it'll be weird be back
S0355	will it
S0281	oh yeah especially in the change circumstances and a big question mark over the future you know
S0355	i think you'll be alright
S0281	yeah i think the first thing i'll do when i get back be erm try and get hold of a lawyer who can speak english to handle my application and my resident's permit
S0355	do you think you'll need that
S0281	well it's either that i will need something i need a visa some kind of visa
S0355	yeah
