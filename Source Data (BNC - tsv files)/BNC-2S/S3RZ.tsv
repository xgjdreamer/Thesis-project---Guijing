S0024	be we go to do the coast to coast
S0144	i'd love to do the coast to coast
S0024	you know 's do another run
S0144	yeah
S0024	i wonder when that be
S0144	yeah she's do it for that company she work for that charity

S0144	yeah no i'd love to do the coast to coast maybe in the summer after the party
S0024	mm
S0144	maybe we could just go up don't know how far it be but
S0024	problem be drop the car off at one end
S0144	well that's the problem isn't it you do need to carry a lot of the and it's go to be quite expensive
S0024	yeah
S0144	because the the place to stop on route have kind of monopolise it a little bite
S0024	mm
S0144	and they know you've get no other choice but to stay with them but i think they offer place to pitch tent and stuff so
S0024	yeah
S0144	if i could carry the tent as well but that would be carry twenty or thirty kilos across
S0024	that's what we use to do yeah
S0144	yeah but from one side of the country to the other i know we use to but we're a bite out of practice aren't we
S0024	yeah it just depend injury wise
S0144	yeah it depend if my foot go again no i'd definitely like to do that or i'd like to go to i'd like to climb ben nevis
S0024	yeah
S0144	something i've always want to do
S0024	that doesn't take too long to climb do it
S0144	no no it's not that big if you do it in the summer the weather will be alright that will be nice
S0024	you've get to get up there
S0144	or you know well we could go and do snowdon or something but i've always want to go up to scotland and and out on the east er the west sorry it look beautiful up there or even up to erm what's it call that in the north west what's that island
S0024	what of scotland
S0144	yeah what's that island call i've forget
S0024	what the one that you love
S0144	yeah
S0024	isle of skye
S0144	yeah
S0024	be it
S0144	look really beautiful there
S0024	do you get a ferry across
S0144	no i think they've get a bridge they've get a toll bridge
S0024	ah but i wouldn't be able to do all the drive all the way up there
S0144	yeah
S0024	that's impossible
S0144	yeah well you can get pretty cheap flight can't you
S0024	yeah but then you need a car the other end as well
S0144	yeah yeah but from you can get a flight to er i don't know inverness
S0024	yeah probably
S0144	so how many email do you sort out today
S0024	there be two well you see cos the i never want to sort them out cos there's just too many so there be two hundred and fifty three that i hadn't even open cos they be i don't know junk mostly or something but then when i get the new message they just kind of all blur in and you're just like oh now i've get two hundred and fifty four oh and it's difficult to i don't know i've be use that flag option now to like flag the ones i want to answer cos i'm not very good at answer them straight away
S0144	mm yeah
S0024	like ben's email i haven't email him back have you
S0144	er i do say yeah i do write something
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah
S0024	we need to write them a nice
S0144	well there's a couple of people i didn't write back to i don't think i write back to
S0024	's birthday today
S0144	
S0024	yes
S0144	right okay that's a good chance then to write something send him a message later
S0024	yeah oh i don't know you know all these people who have say they they'd love to come and see us in the summer but yeah we've get to write
S0144	yeah we're crap at stay in touch aren't we
S0024	yeah i'm rubbish
S0144	yeah we both be
S0024	i think that's mainly because of my disorganisation and then my my think process be quite slow so it's like ah i don't know
S0144	yeah and you think too much of what you're go to write
S0024	i and then i wait a few days and then i forget that i even have an email or i don't want to go on the computer for a bite so i don't go on the computer for a couple of weeks unless i'm expect an important email
S0144	yeah
S0024	and then and then i forget
S0144	yeah
S0024	and that's the same with with my other social network as well i always forget
S0144	huh
S0024	ah look at those daffodils
S0144	yeah
S0024	beautiful
S0144	very yellow aren't they
S0024	yeah see be those wild ones
S0144	yeah i don't know do you have a difference between wild ones and other ones
S0024	well they say yeah there be
S0144	well they must be wild no one would plant them there would they
S0024	no
S0144	but they come up don't they again like every year they come up
S0024	yeah yeah there's an orange tulip one well not not tulip trumpet
S0144	yeah so if i have a garden i'd plant stuff that come up every year i don't understand it when you give yourself so much work and you have to replant it and
S0024	that's a hobby it's a hobby and then you reap the benefit in the summer time and go wow
S0144	yeah it's very time consume though isn't it
S0024	yeah but if it's a hobby you don't notice it so much
S0144	yeah
S0024	i mean and if it's something that you do year after year then it just become this be what i do in in may
S0144	mm see i don't know if i could be bother
S0024	or in
S0144	i'd just like them to come up every year
S0024	just buy buy them ready ready make
S0144	yeah don't mind do the work once
S0024	look at that fat waddle cat
S0024	she's get some kitten in her oven
S0144	go and throw it in that wheelie bin slow down in our village
S0024	yeah they have the magazine come out and they're try to get everybody to put those on there
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah because they're not there all the time cos there's that research that say and there's when you've get a traffic sign
S0144	mm
S0024	and people get use to where it be and then they just start ignore it if they drive past it every day whereas if you put the sign on the wheelie bin and they go out at different days they're different colour
S0144	right
S0024	then you put them in a slightly different place which make people look
S0144	yeah
S0024	well i don't know how true that be i don't know little primrose
S0144	yeah
S0024	i'm start to recognise a lot more flower and things now since we've be learn a little bite about them
S0144	there's a sting nettle
S0024	well do
S0144	there's a dandelion
S0024	well do
S0144	that's about the extent to my knowledge
S0024	oh i now know what a primrose look like
S0144	that's hedge and that's grass
S0024	what be you do you silly bugger
S0144	yeah it's still a bite chilly can't believe it it be absolutely piss down about an hour ago
S0024	yeah i know
S0144	and now it's beautiful
S0024	i be worry we'd get catch out in it again
S0144	no
S0024	huh
S0144	oh it's good to walk off the dinner
S0024	yeah yeah definitely god mum's face bless her it be too hot for her
S0144	it be worth cook that dinner just to see your mum's face her eye nearly pop out her head
S0024	she have some funny face
S0144	yeah
S0024	ah
S0144	well i mean i know it be it would have maybe one or two chillies
S0024	it be hot and you say hot it's not hot it be it be quite hot
S0144	it well yeah but she eat it
S0024	mm
S0144	quite surprise
S0024	thing with those kind of ones though with the little bite of pita bread and stuff if you haven't get something on the side like guacamole or salad or something
S0144	yeah you need the
S0024	i think you get hungry again a bite later because i don't know they seem quite fill at the time
S0144	yeah no that's why you need like a burrito or something and you fill it full of like beef or something don't you like fill it out nachos aren't very er fajitas aren't very fill
S0024	oh look at that
S0144	have someone make that
S0024	yeah
S0144	that's brilliant
S0024	ah a little piece of artwork
S0144	that's cool that be
S0024	well what animal would you say it be i'd say it be a fox
S0144	a dragon
S0024	ah that's really good
S0144	no that's good yeah
S0024	now i'm go to have to look out for more piece of wood make ah
S0144	yeah last night i think i'd do a bite of research cos i'm i still can't get my head round what the hell a derivative be and all this like credit default swap stuff and like commodities and and i wish have do you know what i mean i wish i have learn more about economics when i be at school
S0024	mm didn't we make a they do now they change the whole of the gcses you take things like that now
S0144	they should yeah
S0024	mm
S0144	i wouldn't mind buy like an economics for dummy book or something
S0024	mm
S0144	look there's that private jet again
S0024	who live in
S0144	that's the same one well there's load of military base round here
S0024	yeah but
S0144	it's probably some general or something
S0024	oh
S0144	it's like that top secret plane that fly around with a big er antenna on the front of it just as it get dark fly at really low altitude have you see it
S0024	ah they're test something aren't they
S0144	yeah or it could be come off like a reconnaissance like mission off the off the coast like be just come back at the same time everyday
S0024	hello pheasant mm it look like the grouse whiskey advert except it's not a grouse
S0144	well
S0024	yeah what do you think they're test for
S0144	well it could be a reconnaissance of some kind of thing over the coast or they could be pick up something with it i don't know it's a bite weird isn't it anyway yeah i be look at max keiser be go on about this woman call er blythe master
S0024	i've hear of that name
S0144	yeah she be the person basically at the centre of this credit default swap thing
S0024	where's she from
S0144	she work for erm er oh what's bloody what be they call jp morgan
S0024	oh right
S0144	erm she's educate in like canterbury and oxford and now she's run like the whole of jp morgan's commodity division
S0024	oh right what do she do
S0144	and she basically set up this credit default swap thing i don't know now she's move on to like commodities like rice and wheat and stuff basically what he be say be she's make it they've buy everything all the food
S0024	what in the world what in the what
S0144	so well pretty much this be what i need to look at but
S0024	can't have buy everything in the world
S0144	no but
S0024	might have buy all the seed
S0144	with all the trillions of dollars they've get but basically no countries be buy instead of the market operate where you go into the marketplace and buy the goods
S0024	mm
S0144	because the bank own all the goods they're act as like a middleman
S0024	oh great
S0144	or something so they've they've get control of a lot of the world's food supply
S0024	but they can't they're not act as a middleman then they're act as a behind the scenes erm
S0144	yeah but they can they can manipulate the price of the food
S0024	oh
S0144	i don't know i need to look into it but it's it's quite worry
S0024	i don't really understand what that would do
S0144	mm i'll have to look into it
S0024	it make them more money or they control i suppose oh i don't know whether they control everything
S0144	oh yeah of course yeah cos she go on erm cnn
S0024	yeah
S0144	erm she's never give like an interview before she's
S0024	hello
S0144	hello she's never give a an interview before she's very kind of media savvy just stay away from all of that but she she come across as just this like kind of bumble woman doesn't really know very much about economics and she's just try to do some good
S0024	oh she's a george bush
S0144	but she be very clever in the way she come across
S0024	mm
S0144	when really she's extremely intelligent and you know quite evil
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah i'm go to research it tonight anyway hello duck
S0024	yeah well that's the thing cos i like all all this stuff i don't have the arguments to
S0144	well that's it isn't it
S0024	i know that it's wrong but i can't explain in word what i feel about it or any back up
S0144	yeah well you need to do a a degree in bank or finance to understand the basics of what's go on really
S0024	yeah
S0144	and i can approach it from a political or a social aspect and i can i can see how it's work but to actually understand the actual
S0024	do an a level in economics why not like oh with erm
S0144	no but i don't think that would be good enough i think it would have to be a degree
S0024	yeah you need yeah you need to go deeper
S0144	yeah i mean cos they're not go to teach you the stuff that you want to know anyway they're only go to teach you how the system work
S0024	but i be just think how you could no yeah but at university it become a bite more they they like to give you a round opinion most of the time well it depend which lecturers you get doesn't it
S0144	yeah cos that's how most people end up
S0024	i think they be plastic oh my goodness i think they be plastic aren't they beautiful
S0144	what be they
S0024	tulips but they're really tall my tulips be only have the the leave
S0144	oh
S0024	we should go and have a look see if ours have grow
S0144	well they're get the sun look that's why
S0024	they're beautiful you need to get a good like that's the thing when you look at university course and stuff like that you don't research the lecturers that be go to be teach you
S0144	yeah no that's very important
S0024	it's very yeah
S0144	cos even the universities teach you like how the system work but you can come out of university and still not be able to like critically view it
S0024	mm
S0144	or have an alternative
S0024	but yeah well like my
S0144	especially scientific things like that
S0024	yeah my research that i do for undergraduate the psychology project that i do the subliminal message thing
S0144	yeah
S0024	and then like that be how many years ago and nobody have do it before anything similar
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	and i know the and and the lecturers be like oh don't be so stupid and all they want to do be erm eye witness testimonies
S0144	yeah just go over grind that's all ready be tread
S0024	eye witness i'm an expert in eye witness testimonies
S0144	yeah
S0024	this be all i know about and
S0144	exactly
S0024	then it's on on the tv and they've make a whole program about it i wonder if someone i mean i be seventy four percent one percent off of be bloody ah it would have be good if it be publish cos then i could turn round to them and say look i do this this many years ago
S0144	yeah
S0024	but ah i just can't believe it do all of that work and somebody you don't you just don't know somebody could have find it plymouth university look through it and go ah i'll just adapt this one a little bite
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	and bob's your uncle they've get some research
S0144	yeah yeah yeah
S0024	some psychology graduate come out and then they and then they say on the news wow it's be find that that erm different word i mean they do exactly the same they do positive word neutral word and negative word subliminally take in and how it affect their emotions but they do it how they walk didn't they how they walk down an aisle or something and i do it through the the stroop test and just some that emotion questionnaire things
S0144	yeah
S0024	and mine be flaw in many many ways really but it be the whole basis of the idea that hadn't be research again it's not it's not fair
S0144	yeah but i mean subliminal message be quite a big topic i mean it be only a matter of time before someone else do it it's like you know when you come up with a great idea for something and then a couple of years later someone's make this invention
S0024	yeah yeah but it's not it's not fair yeah
S0144	and you go oh bloody i think of that
S0024	yeah that happen all the time
S0144	you know that always happen
S0024	but you didn't do anything about it i write a research paper about it
S0144	yeah well that's the thing yeah but you didn't do anything about it you didn't you know have courage in your convictions and follow it through and er and publish it which you could have do so
S0024	i couldn't publish it cos i get seventy four percent you have to have seventy five percent to publish it
S0144	oh you could have i'm sure you could have do
S0024	well i be young i didn't know how to do that kind of thing do you
S0144	yeah yeah i know
S0024	especially when you've get the lecturer stand there go urgh
S0144	yeah
S0024	i mean they didn't help me one iota
S0144	yeah well the problem i have with like write stuff like that be cos i always want to write something that have mean
S0024	cos they weren't interest yeah
S0144	that be kind of push for something new to find something new
S0024	yeah
S0144	whereas that isn't what a a degree's about a degree's about just write a research project in in a good way
S0024	and and the the main thing be be the write of it even if you yeah and and write down every single problem whether you generalise or whether your be specific or make all the all the flaw in everything clear
S0144	the main thing be make sure the literature review tie in with your like your whatever what be they call and then you tie it with the conclusion yeah and that's what the yeah
S0024	yeah you've really get to know how to write one yeah rather than the actual research
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	i mean the manipulation of the data it just drive me mad you can do anything with it
S0144	yeah well that's what that's what i be surprise about with
S0024	just just make it a log value oh look now it look better now we'll analyse it
S0144	yeah
S0024	just just cut out oh these erm what do you call those those point which be far far away from everybody from the normality or something
S0144	mm
S0024	oh i've forget the name of them
S0144	yeah
S0024	oh we can't use that piece of data we're we'll just take it out of the equation
S0144	oh yeah yeah
S0024	even though it be somebody's opinion somewhere or it's something that happen somewhere
S0144	well exactly that's why all of these study be a load of bollocks
S0024	they be especially in the social sciences
S0144	especially and especially when they're you know you've get these big company which outsource a project to a like a research agency and they know you know what i mean even if they don't make it explicitly what they have to find the research agency know what they want to find and they can massage the data in any way they want to
S0024	oh yeah yeah they know what they have to find yeah yeah yeah remember that
S0144	and the same apply to like government agencies or whoever
S0024	remember like part of our part of our master be how can you manipulate this data
S0144	yeah
S0024	and everybody come out with different ideas but it wasn't what you come out with that be the what you get the mark for it be how you do it and how you write it up and how you explain your action of how but everybody
S0144	have you get any mint
S0024	everybody erm everybody massage the data in different ways
S0144	mm
S0024	and they come out all different directions but everybody who do a good job in write it up and explain what they do and why they do it get erm a's or whatever or if they do it well
S0144	yeah er
S0024	oh that's enough of me moan
S0144	yeah
S0024	i didn't mean to start moan
S0144	don't know we always seem to be moan when we're record stuff
S0024	i don't mean too
S0144	oh do you just drop all those mint
S0024	mm
S0144	thank you
S0024	no i don't mean to moan sorry
S0144	apologise to me
S0024	they do do some erm good research they do do i just it just frustrate me how they put it in the paper and and they're allow to come out with completely oppose research every other week
S0144	mm mm mm mm
S0024	eat chocolate don't eat chocolate i don't know
S0144	yeah well that's do on purpose as well
S0024	yeah i know well exactly oh i could walk for ever be there somewhere else we can walk
S0144	well we could walk around the other block
S0024	mm
S0144	i say we're go to wash up when we get back
S0024	yeah well there's not much to do
S0144	mm we could play have a game of table tennis when we get back
S0024	mm yeah i've get to practise
S0144	yeah you do well if you want to be as good as me one day you need to put the hours in
S0024	well i'm go to practise with everybody every day
S0144	mhm
S0024	so that i get at least three game in a day
S0144	mm
S0024	they take longer than you think though don't they
S0144	mm
S0024	by the time you've do the three
S0144	well i notice your mm
S0024	round oh that's half an hour really isn't it
S0144	mm
S0024	a game
S0144	i've notice your spinney shots be get a lot better
S0024	yeah i think they be get worse
S0144	no
S0024	it's my erm forehand i need to work on my forehand cos i've only get one move on my forehand
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	my back hand i'm get better at do all these different move but my forehand i just can't seem to
S0144	yeah well i think the biggest thing you need to work on be your psychology cos when you lose like a few point in a row you completely lose it
S0024	yeah i know yeah i've get to stay calm
S0144	yeah which way be we go this way
S0024	this way yeah
S0144	it's go to be a long walk
S0024	yeah why not
S0144	god yeah
S0024	well i either get too excite or i get too frustrate cos i've do something silly a silly move
S0144	yeah
S0024	and that that annoy me because i know as i hit it that i've do it wrong
S0144	mm
S0024	and i think ah i should give do hit it a different way but it's so fast the game that you haven't really get time to think you've get to rely on your own reactions so you've get to train your own reactions as to what you need to do
S0144	yeah yeah yeah
S0024	so really you can't you can't see i think too slowly and then do the wrong shoot
S0144	yeah it's almost very kind of intuitive isn't it your movements and
S0024	mm mm yeah
S0144	it's good for your reflexes
S0024	mm we should try a leave hand game
S0144	yeah i want to work on my speed cos i remember remember when i erm go to that place in china that that room where i have to practise my stuff
S0024	mm mm
S0144	and they have they have a little section where all these kid be play table tennis and they be just awesome they're only they can barely get their head above the table you know they be that small
S0024	mm
S0144	and they be just ping them back sort of like sort of like forrest gump and that's
S0024	yeah and erm
S0144	that's what i want to i don't know how to do that how to practise get to that speed
S0024	do you know how fast we're go
S0144	huh
S0024	i think i think what you need to do be cos remember when i er there be a couple of shots two years ago dad erm we do some record and we record us play table tennis
S0144	yeah
S0024	and we record dad and you play table tennis and they be faster than you think
S0144	yeah look faster
S0024	it's not
S0144	when you're play it seem slower cos your awareness be tune in and your reactions when you're observe it yeah it do look faster
S0024	yeah yeah yeah mm
S0144	yeah that's true yeah but it's not you know you look at the professionals and stuff and they they can take two three pace back from the table and still be whack them
S0024	well that's what i've be try to be step back to back from the table
S0144	you know and have proper like rally like just smash it to each other
S0024	mm
S0144	and then put in a drop shoot
S0024	yeah but you've you've still get to be able to jump in and reach those
S0144	oh yeah
S0024	those short shots
S0144	but i haven't get to the stage where i can just whack it from you know a couple of metres from the table
S0024	but in to practise that we've both get to step back
S0144	yeah haven't really get the space though have you
S0024	cos what they do those fast players they almost hit it to each other to each other to each other and then find a spot in the game where they can find a spot in the game where they can flick it the other way or gently tap it you know they really bide their time and wait for the right moment it's like
S0144	oh yeah oh yeah and they can put the ball right in the spot that they want it in
S0024	mm
S0144	which i'm get there do you know what i mean though you should be aim you should actually right you should mark a a bite on the table just a bite of chalk
S0024	mm
S0144	right on the base line like a couple of centimetres or a few centimetres or actually start more than that and aim to hit the ball into that zone cos that's the key zone you don't want it bounce in the middle of the table
S0024	no yeah
S0144	cos then it's it's easy
S0024	too easy yeah
S0144	you want to be hit it on the base line or or just drop it over
S0024	mm
S0144	so you should try and you could start couldn't you by put a couple of chalk mark on and then gradually move it either way
S0024	yeah for the like really work on the precision
S0144	yeah yeah yeah
S0024	blah blah blah
S0024	oh he nod i didn't know him
S0144	yeah he do nod
S0024	what a nice man
S0144	that be a proper farmers' nod
S0024	yeah it be wasn't it yeah well maybe instead of have game we should do something like that but the problem be you're so much better than me that i don't know
S0144	cos i i would yeah
S0024	but
S0144	i mean cos the main thing be just play for fun anyway but i would like to step it up a little bite and try and get to the next level
S0024	put some yeah and that mean some dedicate practise at one particular thing or
S0144	yeah cos i mean korea be the prime opportunity to to work on that
S0024	well we weren't into table tennis then
S0144	yeah but they have table tennis club everywhere didn't they
S0024	yeah but we weren't into it
S0144	yeah but i remember gregg join the club in hwamyeong dong
S0024	yeah
S0144	and in in the club be erm that woman who be on the olympic team
S0024	really in hwamyeong dong
S0144	yeah or or an old olympic team yeah and he be get teach by her
S0024	oh wow
S0144	and he become like excellent really quickly
S0024	oh you know korea be such a great place for learn things learn new things it be really good
S0144	yeah it be good wasn't it
S0024	well i know i know there's well india be a great place as well i think it be like a felt like a place to study something different or do something different
S0144	yeah
S0024	both of those
S0144	well it be kind of a boom country wasn't it
S0024	i hope yeah
S0144	i mean everyone seem to
S0024	everyone have to have that artistic side to them too so the kid have to study an instrument
S0144	yeah but what
S0024	that's like a major thing
S0144	yeah what i find with korea be a large proportion of the country be middle class you didn't really see that many poor people in korea
S0024	no or maybe we didn't go in we do go out in the countryside
S0144	and so they have everyone could kind of afford for their kid to learn piano or play table tennis or learn english
S0024	yeah well it wasn't extremely expensive like here either
S0144	no no that's what i mean it be
S0024	so the middle class could afford it yeah
S0144	yeah but i think be you know probably the height of their economy i don't know if it's that good any more and i don't think it will be for very much longer cos they've sell all their stuff to china
S0024	oh yeah yeah
S0144	so they're go to gonna struggle i don't think it's hit them yet but but it be great though wasn't it
S0024	yeah it be
S0144	i mean you have the
S0024	it's one of those things that you look back on and go ah i wish i'd have more piano lessons cos i really can't play anything anymore and what i learn have go out of my head
S0144	yeah
S0024	i wish i do more of this more of that
S0144	mm
S0024	whereas some place we've live it's be like well there wasn't much to do so
S0144	mm
S0024	you know i could have do a few things but more or something
S0144	yeah i don't know i think we make good use of our time really
S0024	oh yeah
S0144	don't sit around on our arses do we
S0024	sometimes i do
S0144	yeah but that's usually after a period of like work excessively hard or
S0024	mm mm that's about perfect time by the time we get back because i don't want it to get too dark
S0144	mm mhm so all of these rape field
S0024	mm
S0144	be that just to provide like rapeseed oil for like vegetable oil for the uk or do we export it
S0024	i don't know but they get a subsidiary not subsidiary erm they get subsidise by government for it
S0144	mm
S0024	which be why i mean i remember when i be a kid it's just use to be wheat barley and some lavender
S0144	mm
S0024	i don't even see lavender field anymore but dad say there be some a long way up but rape just take over
S0144	mm it look nice but you can't eat it though
S0024	yeah it's pretty no no and how much oil can you have
S0144	yeah
S0024	you can get oil from so so many other things i don't know if they try to use it as i don't know if they're try to do something else with it
S0144	mm can you use it as fuel
S0024	i think there be a possibility to but who's go to do it i mean if they if they do use that as fuel then every single field would be cover in rape
S0144	mm mm well it's like the palm tree or the palm oil tree in malaysia or indonesia
S0024	mm mm yeah
S0144	and then they just cover everything with that and then they can't grow their own food so they have to export it and then they're over a barrel
S0024	yeah yeah i'll never forget fly over that thing we be expect to see jungle
S0144	well it be jungle
S0024	and then yeah but we didn't see like we saw some jungle and then it be just clear out and then there be just plantations
S0144	well no that be really sad that be
S0024	that where be we fly eh where do we fly round there i don't remember fly around there
S0144	no well i think you might be think of erm erm in sumatra we climb this massive hill and we look out over the what we be expect to be jungle
S0024	no oh i wasn't in an aeroplane
S0144	cos it be jungle the first time i go there
S0024	rabbit
S0144	it be like a virgin rainforest
S0024	hmm
S0144	and then it be just all palm oil tree
S0024	mm mm
S0144	no that's why i be say about the rape because that's what we use to do to all these other countries
S0024	yeah they don't want to
S0144	we use to make them grow well they use to be like banana republics we use to say right you're grow cocoa you're grow bananas you're grow coffee and they couldn't grow any they couldn't grow anything else and they have to import all of their food
S0024	well i think that's basically what they've tell the farmers here because if you don't if you don't grow rape then you don't get the the extra money
S0144	and that's what mm yeah
S0024	so it's it's obviously more financially beneficial to grow this stuff because otherwise otherwise farmers would be grow food
S0144	yeah yeah yeah
S0024	wheat
S0144	yeah
S0024	it be pretty isn't it
S0144	it do look pretty yeah
S0024	mm it's not it doesn't like ruin the whole landscape it's not like they've cut down load of stuff to do it
S0144	no
S0024	they've just stop produce food
S0144	yeah and they could next year just change it i suppose
S0024	mm yeah yeah
S0144	i don't know what it do to the soil
S0024	i don't know
S0144	it might change the ph level or something i don't know
S0024	i don't know no idea
S0144	ah it's beautiful isn't it
S0024	mm yeah look see yellow all the way yeah that's a really pretty view actually there
S0144	yeah
S0024	if those cloud be different that would be a lovely photo
S0144	yep
S0024	oh i might come up here mm
S0024	ah
S0144	so what do you want to do tonight
S0024	i don't know i feel quite relax i've do all my work
S0144	mhm
S0024	i've sort out some stuff i've get to get organise yep er play a game
S0144	yeah

S0024	oh it will be so much easier if we can test each other and play game and i don't know
S0144	yeah i don't know i just can't get into this arabic i just think i haven't get the motivation for languages
S0024	but
S0144	that's my problem i think i could learn them alright
S0024	i think you would have the motivation for it if you get into use them
S0144	it's just
S0024	you know car
S0144	yeah
S0024	just think how how beneficial it would be er negotiate for a better price on a house just say a few i don't know
S0144	what in england
S0024	no no
S0144	that would work against you
S0024	in oman if we ever get there i don't know we could just just for politeness and i mean we already know the polite word and things but they have get a couple of alternatives for hello that we need to learn from the formal arabic the tunisian arabic be different different
S0144	no well it do of course yeah yeah
S0024	so it's not it's something else and i have quite get there
S0024	yeah er
S0144	that's tunisian isn't it
S0024	er er no i think you can say it but they say it slightly different so the whole pronunciation we've get to work on
S0144	mm
S0024	so we've get to find out how they say it and they they say a different word for just a general hello they cos the tunisians have the french so they didn't
S0144	yeah
S0024	they didn't have that
S0144	no anyway i don't know if i want to do that tonight
