S0227	she doesn't need to have any more unless they cos once you've get a boy and a girl you think well do we need another one where if you've have a few of one sex you incline if you want one to have another go at at throw the die
S0192	yeah
S0227	see what it turn up but once you've get boy and a girl you think that's it it's perfect family perfect unit brother brother for the name girl for the woman erm and daddy's little girl all the box be tick so it's a erm unless you be really in to unless you're catholic or really in to big families you wouldn't think well
S0192	that's enough
S0227	why do i need that all that
S0192	yeah
S0227	all that extra tiredness money that need to be earn to put food on the table and all that malarky so yeah
S0192	do you er help move be it fairly straightforward
S0227	yeah no i i he move on the friday erm be there er from about eleven so she'd come over and she that's 's that's erm 's sister's eldest daughter i think you've meet her before

S0227	but er yeah er come over we er we help move she have feed them a lunch and then i finish i get home a bite early i be home by about two and i erm go straight over and i help do a bite erm basically dry up cos be wash
S0192	yeah
S0227	yeah that be an
S0192	so they're please to have move in
S0227	oh yeah they're er all all ensconce in their new in their new place and er it's get quite a sizeable back garden it's not bad at all
S0192	oh nice
S0227	as a first home it's it's three bedrooms they'll only use two they'll use one as a man cave and one as
S0192	and be this a mortgage
S0227	oh yeah
S0192	oh
S0227	the er
S0192	how long what kind of mortgage do you have on a property then
S0227	i would imagine they've get thirty years or thirty five maybe
S0227	something like that erm erm they have a bite of a deposit but after these first time buyer scheme that the government be er be do at the moment
S0192	what's the benefit of that scheme
S0227	well they get a a reduce rate for a number of years i've never really look into it because i've never need it
S0192	yeah
S0227	myself so i haven't really bother find out what it's all about but it's a erm it's a the government do erm do lend themselves to these er these scheme to try and get first time buyers on the on the market
S0192	mm
S0227	so yeah so they're up and run and er it won't be easy for them to him to come back this time like it be last time as he be just pay rent one would assume that mean the relationship be over if that be the case
S0192	yeah
S0227	and if either way it would cost them money cos i think there's a deal they're at now with house buy that erm you have to pay some kind of penalty if it's if you if you sell up
S0192	change your mind
S0227	you know in a couple of years or something
S0192	so this be quite a big move for them then
S0227	well yeah yeah it's a big move and so and also erm with a mortgage and that you know erm you a lot of people find that erm house price drop and they be live with straddle with negative equity the loan be worth more than the house
S0192	yeah
S0227	so if you try to sell it you'd still owe money rather than you know if you be lucky we we sell we we we pay off on our debt you go one way i go the other and there be nothing leave absolutely nothing to show for it erm or or we've gotta hold on to this house because like it or not if we sell this we're ten grand short
S0192	yeah
S0227	we still gotta owe the mortgage company ten grand but we don't have nothing to show for it you know so it's a so house price go up be good but erm but harder for
S0192	first time buyers
S0227	first time buyers but house price drop be good for first time buyers but not good for people who've erm get very little equity in their property
S0192	yeah
S0192	and be cool with move out
S0227	well yeah he's a man he's twenty five
S0192	it's gonna be quiet in the house
S0227	quieter yeah definitely yeah definitely yeah it'll be strange we've have it before we have it for six months last time before they decide to move back it do erm feel a little strange i don't miss his shoe the man love shoe load of shoe
S0192	do he leave them lie around
S0227	a lot of the time yeah
S0192	yeah
S0227	mm
S0192	cheer for play that game the other day i'm i feel terrible that i give that card

S0227	yeah no you're bombard with erm stuff on tv about the subject so
S0192	yeah
S0227	it's not so such a taboo subject anymore although er i tend to find think that they go the opposite way and try to belittle it and trivialise it and it's not something that you you know that erm there's advert on the radio erm i give you my mum's give you a bite of a spank cancer and all that sort of stuff it's a sort of er condition that erm er er that a lot of people survive cancer but erm er a lot of people die from it as well

S0192	well i apologise anyway
S0227	no there's nothing to apologise for you deal a card it happen to be on there that be it really

S0192	yeah
S0227	in september
S0192	but i mean come may i'll have actually finish with my tuition it'll simply be erm me work on my dissertation my thesis
S0227	right
S0192	up until september so i've get like four months pretty much
S0227	right right
S0192	may june july august yeah four months where i could potentially enjoy the summer provide i'm on top of my my dissertation
S0227	yeah what's be do
S0192	wake up late play on his computer chat to his missus he's cook with me a couple of time and we've like eat
S0227	ah he say he could've get himself he say he could've
S0192	not too much
S0227	try himself to a job but i think well i'm not gonna interfere
S0192	i think he say he try it's just that they just didn't have work for him or something so don't know how hard he try
S0227	no i think that he's will to go a little bite but for not not really apply himself but i'm sure he's cost this all out and he will strap himself to a debt
S0192	yeah
S0227	he'll transfer a little money in september mum have help him i say don't expect mum to be do the same because she's help you in a different way
S0192	yeah
S0227	but i didn't want him to try and make a comparison that cos i've give him money she should i say no erm you move back in that be her way of help you it help her too but it help you so i don't erm
S0192	i can't say it help her that much i mean maybe someone to babysit for but
S0227	babysit yes that's it that's to the extent
S0192	which be free pretty often
S0227	yes
S0192	erm
S0227	that's that's the help for her but
S0192	his rent's ridiculously low
S0227	yes
S0192	it's a hundred pound a month
S0227	yes
S0192	probably doesn't even cover
S0227	he do when he first erm erm the last year of his payment well it be suppose to end at eighteen but she have one of her her well mean friends inform her that erm i should actually have to pay until he be nineteen cos he be go in to further education
S0192	yeah
S0227	i didn't know this at the time so i say well i'll get back to you on that one so i ring back and say you appear to be correct i then do something that be cheeky and i know that by how quick she respond er i i know that she be it be a it a lot of what she be say be tongue in cheek with that thing because although it be a legal thing she couldn't enforce would have have to've if i refuse point blank to pay it would have to take me to court for it and
S0192	it's not gonna happen
S0227	not many children would actually have do that
S0192	no
S0227	i know that i know that she probably know that so i say as quick as a flash i say right you do appear to be right cos i stop you know eighteen he's a man i say i wanna payment er i wanna payment break i don't wanna pay for the first month do she say and i think the speed that you do that you know you have you be you be it be a bite tongue in cheek that you be gonna get anything anyway that if i'd just say no stick it up your arse you wouldn't have get anything but the fact that i say well okay er accept but i'm gonna have one month off agree with the alacrity that she respond i know that er she have chance her arm and i play along i then er erm seize the initiative and er probably to her angst say to i'm go to give you the money because you have majority i've consider that you should be responsible for your own money i shouldn't be give it to your mummy
S0192	i'm sure that fix it
S0227	yeah i'm sure it do er he say well how much should i i pay her i say that's between you and your mother i say i can't i can't influence you in this regard i say the only advice i can give you be that if your an imbecile you'll give her all of it if you're very astute and cunning you'll give her nothing you will give her something in between i i couldn't manipulate the situation it be up for him and her to to arrange
S0192	how much be it that you be give him
S0227	oh something like about a hundred and thirty
S0192	a month
S0227	hundred and forty a month because it have be freeze in time i'd do a clever little erm thing when it first when i cos we come out the csa idiots have have not erm have not be take it from my account and pay her so i never realise a about four months later cos you probably agree with me in this when you study your bank account you study the money go in not the money go out
S0192	mm
S0227	but when it's on a direct debit you don't worry about it because it's set up
S0192	yeah
S0227	so i i be set up to pay the money it didn't it didn't erm it didn't happen erm it do initially and then erm for some reason the idiots uncouple it and it and and and never happen i never notice this and she didn't notice it for about three or four months always too frighten to ask for it that much i doubt very much so when's she's i haven't receive anything er for about the last three or four months i say er she say be you aware i say i don't really look at what's you know go out only what's come in so i say let me make a check on that i'll get back to you so i get back to her and say you're right er it hasn't i say let me write a cheque cos be come over i say i'll write a cheque he'll take it back with you when he come back tonight tomorrow
S0192	yeah
S0227	so i do that and i say tell the csa this be what i've do er i then get a call from them about a week later say er er how do you fancy come out of this arrangement er i say well that depend on what your mother er she's quite happy for that i say fine we'll do it that way but i'd give her a false i'd give a false impression anyway because er when it come for the snapshot of the csa er cos i know your mum have set them on me erm i be do all my overtimes but i wasn't claim them
S0192	mm
S0227	so when it take a a photograph i know it be a snapshot in time and they would work with the figure that be available to them once i know they'd be in i then posthumously start claim my overtimes
S0192	yeah
S0227	well why shouldn't i i i wasn't the one who'd leave her for someone else
S0192	no of course
S0227	so i be vindicate in my own mind do that now if i had've leave her for someone else that would be a real bastard thing to do but erm the way i look at it be erm you're get reward for everything here you take my kid away from me and then er i have to pay you for a for each of you so i'm go to manipulate it if i can and i do
S0192	yeah
S0227	so that be that but so erm erm negotiate a a rate with her that's be pay but like i say i couldn't say to him no you should only pay ten pound a month or some stupid arbitrary figure because it be down to them to to thrash out not me er if i be make it if i be treat him like a man then he have to be a man to resolve this with his mum not say oh dad what should i do how much should i pay but
S0192	but he hasn't erm he hasn't have this since he be nineteen then i take it that stop
S0227	no it end
S0192	yeah
S0227	yes he when it end yeah it yeah
S0192	cos he's twenty four now
S0227	yeah so it end at on his nineteenth birthday but
S0227	job do but it be this little erm thing that obviously her one of her little friends have tell her this thing i be i be a bite miff cos i think bloody hell he's eighteen years old he's a man why be i pay you
S0192	we do that in our culture don't we once you get to eighteen you're out on your own after that it's not the same most of the world isn't the same
S0227	yeah yeah but not if you're in further yeah but not if you're in further education he do it because if if he'd've be if if his birthday have fall a bite differently i'd've have to've pay it for another bloody year
S0192	yeah yeah
S0227	so i be go like what but you
S0192	in korea the parent pay for uni pretty much for all like i'd say ninety percent of the people that go to uni and then about ninety percent of people go to uni
S0227	yeah
S0192	so it's pretty high
S0227	i mean italians erm 's be a benefactor of this erm in italy not here the parent buy the children home
S0192	yeah
S0227	how the hell can they afford that i no wonder they have to come to england to work
S0192	yeah
S0227	to get money but yes he buy them home in italy they're not worth nothing like they be here
S0192	as culture go
S0227	yeah
S0192	with regard the independence of our children we're fairly cold i think
S0227	yeah yeah
S0192	there's not too many culture that er treat our children more independently
S0227	no no no probably probably
S0192	my students couldn't believe me when i tell them that i be live on my own from like seventeen onwards
