S0255	i don't know
S0256	they they be really hard they've make em really really difficult that's the problem
S0255	yeah it's almost like it's too difficult
S0256	yeah
S0255	it should be quite a few easy ones so you can get go
S0255	oh that i know what that one be i saw that film it's somewhere in spain that'd be vietnam good morning vietnam with robin williams yeah usually quiz they do there's quite a few easy ones and then some middle and then some
S0256	some bits of he's just be really harsh
S0255	you need to have word with him
S0256	i don't really know him
S0255	that's like it's lonely at the top when there's no
S0255	to kick oh okay
S0256	think that's suppose to be a clue i think he's take out some of the letter
S0255	so that's stamp or footprint
S0256	no it's not that's part of the logo
S0255	oh
S0256	it's just that he's take out some of the letter that
S0255	mm
S0256	so
S0255	well it's all get this about maple leave and that so it's something canada there's a mousse
S0256	so it's yeah so it's canadian something isn't it canadian canada or something that's johnny english i know that one
S0255	yeah that so that's just english which i've get the whole thing
S0256	you have you have to write the name of the the show
S0255	yeah
S0256	that's captain america
S0255	you see you're on a roll
S0256	well i know a few of them anyhow when i look at it the other day
S0255	see i don't know who they be
S0256	that that's
S0255	oh be that no
S0256	erm that's will farrell ferrell one of them
S0255	colin farrell
S0256	colin farrell exactly the same person they're the same person
S0256	i've get this i'm sure of it oh crocodile dundee i know that one yay look it's eddie murphy
S0255	that's eddie murphy oh that be when he be erm be that come to america
S0256	i don't
S0255	oh okay wait a minute erm mm er ha ha mm mm mm mm should've be cos that that probably isn't idi amin but i don't know why that's the only thing i can think of
S0256	i have no idea
S0255	mm yes you need to tell him this be too hard
S0256	it be really difficult and that's the problem i get that you wanna make it difficult but
S0255	mm
S0256	there's make it difficult and then there's make it too difficult cos if people find out it's too difficult a lot of people who maybe have buy it probably won't buy it because they know they're not gonna have a half chance of win
S0255	yeah this be true cos they know it just mean that
S0256	it doesn't tell you as well it doesn't tell you what you win if you actually win it
S0255	mm right let me just look that up
S0255	i think that's come to america yeah there you go come to america that's the film cover there
S0256	so we've get two americas that's pretty random
S0255	mm hm what's this with minis up in the air sort of bank job maybe i i be think italian job
S0256	yeah that's what i be think that's it
S0255	but be it
S0256	yeah i think it be
S0255	that might be a clip from the new
S0256	yeah it be cos they no it cos they it it be cos they jump across the thing
S0255	italian job okay that's fine pretty good so i don't recognise her that's that's erm they oh no so that's patrick swayze that i'm think she's rizzo out of erm greece but it obviously it's not the same film they're not in the same
S0256	because patrick swayze be not in greece
S0255	that's not that's kirk
S0255	kirk douglas
S0256	don't even know who kirk i do but i didn't
S0255	he's michael douglas's son
S0256	oh yeah well yeah
S0255	kirk douglas
S0256	but but i don't have an idea
S0255	film image no kirk douglas be the dad right it's not kirk douglas he's the one of the now who be he who be he
S0256	i don't know
S0255	he's not michael douglas be he no see that's not him either probably isn't even one of the douglas boys
S0256	that's the last page but it it be extremely difficult
S0255	douglas brothers that's no good right so let's let's get back to the big the harder ones on the first sheet once the gun and roses guitarist lose his l plate so it's axle a x l e or a x e l one of the other but then you're take the l out
S0256	mm hm see that
S0255	he go to south america so you've get s a and once
S0255	laxessa
S0255	and then it's an anagram be it
S0256	i don't know
S0255	oh
S0256	i don't think so cos
S0255	cities and countries c lax c that's
S0256	have you get this song the song be so good francis name it twice i assume that be new york new york
S0255	yeah francis make it twice erm who sing it frank
S0256	frank sinatra
S0255	frank yeah frank sinatra so yeah that's new york new york mermaids can't do this in tennessee except for her be it mermaids that be that film with erm cher in wasn't it
S0256	i don't know the ex policeman like his tea and toast in the big apple
S0255	the ex policeman like his tea and toast in the big apple ex policeman ex oh ex cop tea and big apple new york
S0256	see i don't think that's what it be
S0255	no that's you see that's the way they do erm
S0256	yeah but i don't think it be and i think it's more literal but just
S0255	the thing be you you have to either be in on his wavelength exactly for how he's twist things and do it
S0256	yeah that's what it be you've gotta be on his wavelength and he's do it really obscure
S0255	yeah
S0256	but also like you've gotta know the songs and a lot of what he's do be really old reference
S0255	yeah
S0256	so again it make it even more difficult
S0255	yeah i suppose if older people might know some of i mean yeah it's ex take her son to mm
S0256	see i think if patsy kensit's ex would be maybe be they mean ricky from eastenders or be they mean her literal ex as in in real life who she be with patsy kensit
S0255	oh be patsy kensit in eastenders
S0256	she be erm what be it bianca i think it be wasn't it
S0255	that's patsy palmer
S0256	be it
S0255	mm
S0256	think that be patsy kensit
S0255	patsy kensit be
S0256	patsy kensit
S0255	she's the one she be erm with noel gallagher from oasis and before that she be with another rock guy
S0256	so so noel gallagher take her son to northern ireland
S0255	i'm not yeah northern ireland patsy kensit's ex yeah so that well that could be noel or she's actually get erm it's like she say yeah famous quote from patsy kensit i've only have four boyfriends and i marry them all so she's be marry four time
S0256	oh that be patsy kensit
S0255	yeah
S0256	what's she in
S0255	er she be in emmerdale sadie king
S0256	yeah
S0255	then she be in holby city
S0256	so again it could be her literal ex or it could be the ex
S0255	marry yeah she marry not noel gallagher liam she marry liam gallagher and jim kerr so jim kerr take her son to to northern ireland sunny i dunno right spock's mother make sure you're hold the finest cup and saucers so finest cup and saucers might be china
S0256	mm tea in no
S0255	spock's mother
S0256	that's all the tea in china all the tea in china
S0255	no i think that's just a say spock's mother mrs spock
S0255	really not think what he's so herbie's four friends return to the cis no
S0256	try to think of a song with china in it
S0255	china in her hand china in your hand china

S0255	maybe t'pau t apostrophe p a u
S0256	what's spock's mother call
S0255	spock's mother spock's mother's name what do we do before google erm spock's mother amanda grayson so her her marry name be unpronounceable by humans
S0256	so probably the sound that it be be it cos they make sound don't they sound's probably t'pau or something like that
S0255	yeah
S0256	but this be what i mean you've get to understand not only have you gotta know music you've gotta know things like from star war cos apparently he or star trek i think he's a big fan of star trek so he's gonna do cryptic things that he understand
S0255	oh right
S0256	but no one else do
S0255	yeah this be it as i be say unless you're on the same wavelength
S0256	but hey i've give a pound to cause that's the main thing
