S0619	mm mm oh er one hundred and forty six be what timber architecture trail of timber church
S0618	i think once you've see one wooden church you've see every wooden church
S0619	one hundred and fifty six be er renaissance residence perfectly preserve oh this be i think
S0618	oh yeah
S0619	be it sumptuous late renaissance magnet magnate residence from the turn of the sixteenth century right or would you prefer to go to the world's oldest oil well
S0619	the choice be yours today
S0618	no wonder people be invade poland
S0619	one hundred and thirty seven this isn't clearly bore i'm just try to find oh it's more church no you can shove your church
S0618	indeed i live in ireland for eight years i don't need more church
S0619	one three four be what
S0618	get in the right lane this be near where i go wrong the other day cor bumpy road
S0619	yeah be ready to turn leave i think be
S0618	yeah it's a little bite ah pick a lane mind the pedestrians the light might be red it might be green it might be your light it might not be
S0619	keep drive just pretend you be in a video game where it doesn't matter
S0618	go go go i know you just sort of bowl people across the bonnet i can do that
S0619	yeah i use to play a game call driver where the aim be to drive without get catch by the police but it be better if you get catch by the police and then just sort of you know
S0618	okay say i'm play a game and i just lose no
S0619	no and then no and then just be chase by the police and try and get away from them and then just do it again just to sort of to get within touch distance of the police
S0618	oh my god be this a video game or be this reality
S0619	it's not reality
S0618	okay
S0619	i didn't go like bumper to bumper with a police car and then wait for them to turn around and then drive off
S0618	okay and drive off i do wonder but you know
S0619	no i'm not that bad one hundred and thirty six
S0618	your childhood
S0619	right we be get i'm make some progress with this map one hundred and thirty six be there
S0618	i think that be a policeman who be read a map but of course i'm look at the passenger
S0619	he doesn't know where he's go
S0618	he doesn't he need 's satnav mate
S0619	one hundred and thirty six be there and that be and be no i've lose the thing now
S0618	yeah every time
S0619	that's nice one hundred and thirty five
S0618	every time i go past i think oh i must go there i mean and i suppose another part of me think well while the sky be blue and the sun be out and it's just beautiful it might be nice to have a wander around outside somewhere but yeah i know what you mean
S0619	yeah yeah i could say that
S0618	i just don't want to drive for five hours today
S0619	no yeah one hundred and forty i just can't tell the distance on this map
S0618	yeah i think it's all relative as well it depend on erm what sort of roads you've get if you've get little wiggly woggly ones then it can be really close but take forever
S0619	i think i've go off because we can do it anytime in in forty five minutes and it's and it's inside yeah so be i believe erm there we could do it in
S0618	mm oh okay the car park in foothills
S0619	it be in the carpark no it's not it's in a place that i can't pronounce
S0618	okay
S0619	i know that it have get a beautiful square it's like a little er it's get a square so there will be restaurants and place to roam around and castle things all castle and things
S0618	and when it's rain cool
S0619	er
S0618	i like the sound of that
S0619	er i'm suppose to make all the decisions
S0618	it sound like it's get everything
S0619	i think it would be nice for the day
S0618	and i think if it's south of here it's go to have beautiful scenery as well
S0619	it's not south it's north
S0618	what be it
S0619	yeah i just don't think it's on this map because it's in it be in the next one
S0618	ah okay
S0619	but if you want to stay if you want to go south then
S0618	oh shit that's where i should have turn oh do it again
S0619	dammit
S0618	oh can i turn here now which what be that no entry sign maybe that's for me
S0619	i think
S0618	i'll turn around here again like we do the other day oh well at least i know i can turn around here
S0619	so if we go south then the next one south be one hundred and forty six which be one of the church
S0618	i don't mind go north alright
S0619	or one five seven what's that one five seven be oh that's the oil
S0618	no
S0619	you've already say no to that
S0618	i know i think that just need just strike off who be interest apart from george bush
S0619	i need a pen and then i can edit this
S0618	i've get erm i've get pen in my bag
S0619	but then if we go too far south we be just you know in slovakia one sixty what's that palace music and oh that's
S0618	what's go on there right
S0619	one six two here that's church
S0618	i need to reverse out again oh i seem to have a bite of queue behind me oops sorry so talk amongst yourself
S0619	one hundred and fifty eight
S0618	castle and park complex that do look nice
S0619	one five eight
S0618	you see i like the sound of the place that we be go to go miles away because i like the sound of the ground and everything everybody move along we be turn round sorry here we be can you point that heater thing towards your window because i can't see in my mirror ta so where do we decide on
S0619	yeah yeah i think
S0618	okay
S0619	i don't know how you say it or yeah that's as far as i've get
S0618	okay
S0619	we will have to rely on the satnav because of this map
S0618	no the satnav be good
S0619	because i've just run out of map i think unless yeah here we be
S0618	that be quite simply negotiate i think we've get quite good at things like that
S0619	well i don't think it be negotiate it be me just go well we be go to go here so
S0618	okay fair enough no you do come up with a few options there
S0619	well and yeah from a selfish perspective i've always want to go
S0618	what to this place
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	i've never hear of it
S0619	and people have recommend it to me before but to get to on public transport you've either get to go to which be two bus away and then go from to there or go to and go from there
S0618	yeah
S0619	so it's a bite of a faff
S0618	okay however you look at it it's not really work
S0619	yeah
S0618	so if i drive in 's driveway be i go to get out again yeah i should do shouldn't i there's enough bumpy bits
S0619	yeah
S0618	i think this be my theory in northern ireland as well that you know when things freeze and stuff if you've get like a well maintain road that's really flat then you've get problems in snow and ice but bumpy roads grip
S0619	bumpy roads be brilliant
S0618	yeah you've get load of grip and i reckon as well northern ireland didn't bother with speed bump really they just didn't bother repair their roads it work fine yeah we be reverse in snow
S0619	in snow with the valency tyres
S0618	yeah so let's see if 's oversleep today
S0619	no because she send a text unless she would have wake up send a text and then erm go back to sleep let me just take off many clothe
S0618	yeah me too say bye
S0619	bye
S0618	bye
