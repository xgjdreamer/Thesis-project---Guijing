S0261	okay this be part two of our discussion this be more about education et cetera and strategic erm direction with that okay fire away
S0262	erm
S0261	so we be talk about erm the context of of try to find a strategic direction where innovators be head and see if you can erm er focus your your join up in that context so the example be in place like vietnam that erm outfit like the british council be connect up with tech erm outfit like nokia erm to er collaborate on try to get erm english learn materials out in in a digital publish arena
S0262	yeah
S0261	through tech company erm as oppose to outfit like pearson er or or other digital publish house
S0262	yeah and er you know really that that's
S0261	so who's actually run the the the publish side of it be they say the techs the tech company be or be they say that that's a mechanism for them to self publish through a tech er erm output
S0262	they i think i think you know if you start with the core business of what a publish company do it's always get to get its content out there it's get to be able to sell it and so british council erm be in a good position because they publish content they be in a good position and they're massive enough to partner up with nokia and get people into china and vietnam who will work away with the tech people and work a way of make a mobile learn experience as seamless and as as fun and and as brilliant as possible erm so that's where the real tech stuff will come through be make sure that on a nokia you've get a fantastic learn experience a mobile nokia
S0261	yeah so the context be try to erm include mobile devices erm as platforms for spread the message e learn et cetera erm and er er supply people with products to the tool that they're go to use to be able to get exposure to er whatever they're try to learn and the better their tick product erm the er the potentially the larger the market you can access
S0262	okay this be it so this be another one successfully implement in ten countries in three continents the bridge it project be now be pilot in vietnam by the british council in partnership with nokia and the pearson foundation initially twenty primary teachers from ten poorly resourced budget school in ho chi minh city bridge it use smart phone and network to deliver materials and professional development to educators erm around the world in order to develop teach capacity enable learners to access digital learn materials through mobile technology with the focus purely on english for this pilot project select british council learn resources include videos and songs stories grammar activities from the learnenglish kid website have be upload to a cloud server the teachers use their nokia education delivery software already instal in nokia smartphones can download the teach resources to smartphones use the 3g network they then connect them to the tvs or data projectors and display the materials as teach aid okay do you want me to continue
S0261	yeah yeah yeah i'm i'm listen
S0262	okay with the power of mobile technology students can now explore state of the art educational program regardless of their school's location internet access or academic resource budget head of primary education at the ho chi minh city department of education say at the launch this project promise to bring an effective tool to help school in poorer areas where they can implement the digital english teach method more effectively with the help of technology to i believe this will bring benefit to those pupils instead of cover subject such as maths and science as in the philippines and other countries the vietnam pilot project will focus only on teach english in primary school this approach fit in to vietnam's ministry of education and train plan to implement ict and digital learn resources as part of the english twenty twenty strategy so you've get a few years there then to upgrade the teach and learn of english across primary and secondary level furthermore since two thousand the ministry have be place ict on reform agenda as both an object of education and an innovate teach methodology an important pedagogical tool from two thousand two thousand and seven vietnam move up fifteen place in a worldwide list of ict development put it among the top ten develop countries however research have show that while many school and teachers have access to ict for administration purpose and some for make lesson materials very few use it as a tool for creative learn in the classroom the pilot project be launch on the twenty fifth of january in ho chi minh city as one of the participate school follow by a two day workshop for all the participate teachers the workshop aim to equip them with the skills need to use smartphones to access quality teach and learn materials provide by the british council and map to vietnam's national curriculum through the director of the british council vietnam say we're delight to partner with nokia and pearson foundation in this meaningful project
S0261	pearson
S0262	who
S0261	pearson
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	foundation
S0262	that's different though from pearson publish
S0261	oh be it
S0262	yeah
S0261	different place
S0262	er
S0261	same company different
S0262	philanthropic
S0261	philanthropic
S0262	yeah
S0261	okay
S0262	but we can check that out
S0261	yes
S0262	the british council vietnam can contribute a vast experience in teacher train to this project in the past ten years the british council vietnam have train nearly eight thousand english teachers face to face and over two hundred and fifteen thousand teachers indirectly furthermore take advantage of the nokia education delivery platform the world renowned learn english and teach english resources of the british council will have a huge potential to be share among hundreds of thousands of vietnamese children live in remote and disadvantage areas across vietnam the success of the pilot which end next may so it's may two thousand and fourteen will be measure by the enthusiasm and commitment of the twenty select english teachers well crikey that's not very much er of the twenty select english teachers in use the nokia smartphones
S0261	do you say may twenty fourteen
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	erm and the as well as the british council learn resources there will be mid course and final evaluations through observations feedback questionnaires attitudinal survey er i haven't hear of one of those and focus group discussions
S0261	mm okay so that's an example of something that be go on and then er
S0262	and then there's another one about china which be do exactly the same
S0261	right right okay so what we want to try and nail that's an example
S0262	yeah
S0261	what we now want to look at be within southeast asia what kind of countries be likely to take on this type of programme or be head in a more progressive direction
S0262	yeah you
S0261	that that that that be grow into that
S0262	yeah
S0261	they're not already through it
S0262	well no one's gonna have be through
S0261	no cos it's a new thing
S0262	er er potentially south korea maybe japan anyone who's get already very well establish erm
S0261	ict
S0262	er yeah
S0261	and and policy and network and
S0262	yeah
S0261	and and money et cetera
S0262	yeah yeah but these be top ten develop countries
S0261	yeah so they're relative they're relatively wealthy
S0262	so if we just know what the top ten develop countries be
S0261	mm
S0262	we can focus on those to start with and i'd suggest that south korea and japan isn't a develop country
S0261	yes
S0262	but if we're interest in look at the top ten develop countries then we can figure out where others might be head
S0261	and this be reference southeast asia be it
S0262	yes
S0261	it's in context of southeast asia
S0262	yeah it's in the supplement for southeast asia or asia pacific
S0261	asia pacific
S0262	yeah
S0261	okay erm okay erm alright so if so if we know that list can we find that list now
S0262	do you can i just tell you how it work how the british council have partner up with nokia
S0261	yeah yeah
S0262	tell you how the technology work
S0261	yeah yeah
S0262	okay
S0261	mm
S0262	so erm the er the british council and nokia have be collaborate since two thousand and nine to deliver learn materials through nokia non smartphone headsets the materials consist of text base and gprs base english learn content create by elt professionals from the british council available at various different level it also include culture and history and be design to teach english sentence test vocabulary and punctuation users access materials by either subscribe to a text message service or browse online through nokia phone materials be deliver through nokia life an application pre instal on nokia mid and low end mobile devices and offer personalise information for daily live learn share to millions in develop market primarily to those who never use a pc that's interest
S0261	yeah so what they're say be be keep it simple yeah so they've do it on a text base delivery that's cheap doesn't cost a lot of money
S0262	mm
S0261	they're say that's subscription base so either you're pay a certain amount per month to have access to it or maybe on a daily rate or whatever it be erm through a pay as you go service or you look at it via the internet which be on a data relate service
S0262	mm
S0261	so if you've get enough money to pay for the data you would access it through there
S0262	mm
S0261	but presumably the text message delivery system be the cheapest possible way to get the message out there
S0262	mm
S0261	erm
S0262	okay
S0261	who know there might be other ways to deliver it that be that er that that's that that's that's the starter and also they're say pre smartphones
S0262	yeah
S0261	so they're they're devices that can be provide at a very low cost as well
S0262	yeah
S0261	which be probably more likely secondhand or or er er i don't know
S0262	yeah
S0261	how many will still be manufacture but
S0262	well with three hundred million english learners in china five hundred and sixty four million internet users and over one point one billion mobile phone subscribers in china
S0261	they're probably still
S0262	you could go on forever
S0261	yeah yeah yeah er
S0262	with er old crap phone
S0261	yes yes that's right
S0262	erm accord to the british council's head of english learner product development in china
S0261	you've get different the point be you've get different level
S0262	yeah
S0261	so you can you can they're all different market
S0262	it's it's what we call differentiation of market
S0261	yeah mm
S0262	erm and the content reflect the diversity and diverse need of english learners in china what you say when people start to realise the necessity of learn english in the early nineteen nineties in china er eighties sorry the aim for the mast the vast majority be the chance to study abroad nowadays learners include elementary students big business teachers and retire and both that's another one retire we haven't hear that one before and both rural and er urban residents yeah this need their need range wildly from education to career development and to social requirements and in order to help them learn
S0262	we at the british council of high quality english learn materials through an increase number of channel call include include nokia life
S0261	what be their need again
S0262	so erm elementary students
S0261	yes
S0262	teachers new one be retire
S0261	yeah
S0262	and now we're look specifically at erm what they call rural and urban residents
S0261	okay so so there's there's a mix of the market and mix of different type of the population et cetera
S0262	so if you want to focus on a niche market start with
S0261	you could pick one of them
S0262	and the british council be not gonna be do all of these brilliantly
S0261	no
S0262	it's far too fuck
S0261	no
S0262	big a market and there'll be other people try to
S0261	be in on it
S0262	cram in
S0261	as well
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah cos if we're somebody's do it somebody else be do it also in a different way
S0262	but they've get to run a business a big business so they've get to show profit
S0261	yes that's right
S0262	whereas if you're come in
S0261	er er on
S0262	on a niche
S0261	er on a smaller
S0262	you you can run a business
S0261	level
S0262	but you don't have to show as much profit you don't have to be run it at you know
S0261	well you don't have to be run if for shareholders
S0262	no
S0261	you don't have to be run it to deliver erm month er quarterly report
S0262	so you don't have to stay in the big you don't go in the mainstream section where they have to be they'll go in mainstream like for example mainstream be erm in china elementary students the reason why they're focus on elementary students be because
S0261	before we go on with that
S0262	yeah
S0261	can i just finish off the need that
S0262	okay yeah that's the end of it
S0261	erm but you do say that their need be something specific
S0262	oh sorry so yeah their need range wildly from education to career development so that's not just about erm teach er teach chinese teachers how to teach english it's actually about say
S0261	business career development
S0262	if you learn english if you learn english where in the world can you go with it
S0261	mm
S0262	what can you do with english once you've get it
S0261	that's right
S0262	that's career development
S0261	yes
S0262	okay
S0261	mm
S0262	and then erm and how do you keep your english go as you're as you're progress through your career
S0261	mm
S0262	that's a very big part and then to social requirements so potentially more foreigners live in china they're not really speak chinese yet because it's take them too long so there's more there's more impact or need for this for
S0261	mm well there's a there's a business niche in know english and deal with the people who be move in
S0262	it's a a social social requirement can be work
S0261	that's right
S0262	it can be outside of work
S0261	yes
S0262	yeah so it's it's another way of look at don't need to necessarily look at the work way of do things
S0261	mm
S0262	it's all those other well like the chinese housewives who sit around speak to erm native english speakers
S0261	yes
S0262	because they all live in shanghai and beijing
S0261	mm
S0262	guangzhou blah blah blah yeah
S0261	yeah yeah yeah yeah so the the need be i er i want to learn this so i can become a certain part of society
S0262	yeah
S0261	or you can look at it in a private context
S0261	of i want to travel somewhere so i want to learn it
S0262	absolutely
S0261	it could be on a vocational level
S0262	tourist level
S0261	it could be like the community's class level
S0262	yeah
S0262	that would be rural and urban you know that sort of er well rural how the fuck do you teach some rural people english
S0261	er well you
S0262	what's the point
S0261	er as a community group
S0262	yeah
S0261	you know you're er somebody come in and once a month er everybody go everybody go to the
S0262	well you're raise their aspirations yeah
S0261	the village hall and listen to what's what's do
S0262	yeah
S0261	and they collaboratively learn
S0262	and it's raise aspirations cos rural you'll never be on the same aspirational level as an urban dweller
S0261	that that's that's right yeah
S0262	so it's good for the chinese to get their rural people think a bite more you know higher level
S0261	yeah
S0262	erm and so the next bite be erm a vice president for nokia in china say the wide range of content mean that we can also graduate service accord to what consumers want so the scalability be massive that's what he's say the the wide range of content mean there be so many different people out there who want different type of content that they can scale it up at any level
S0261	er yes so you can you can identify paths which er run er er with stronger thread for a particular period of time
S0262	yeah
S0261	cos there'll be trend
S0262	yeah
S0261	and erm you can say well we want to be on that pathway for this time and move to a different pathway as and when say the growth in it start or something like that
S0262	and the generations be get older so you'll you will watch a little elementary kiddie that's what i be about to explain to you that if you teach elementary in two thousand and fourteen their appetite for this kind of content will grow with them as they progress through their
S0261	throughout their live
S0262	language development so by the age of eleven it's quite possible that they will become fluent in english and they've never even leave china
S0261	mm
S0262	and there's some people believe that because of this type of er learn activity and access to resources you could actually you really could be fluent like almost native english speaker
S0261	yes okay
S0262	cos you start so young when their brain be so
S0261	develop
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah er of course erm so right so er similarly the the identification be be that there's a there's a massive stream er a massive stream of opportunity regard all of that
S0262	so it's not quite the end yet so it go for both partner the initiative provide so this be the win win provide an invaluable opportunity to reach a vast underserved market nokia life be available on simple phone use by rural and migrant workers mean the content be probably the first contact that those people have actually have with a mobile english learn product and anything from the british council so it's the first time that they'll ever see something like this which i can totally imagine to be true
S0261	what be it call again nokia
S0262	nokia life
S0261	right
S0262	say director of the british council china she add that many of these users will become city residents with the same aspirations and the same need to use english and that with rapid social change in china new media be the only way to get the message out there
S0261	yes
S0262	so it's what we say
S0261	it's it's spread it's spread the word to a large audience in a in a very specific and easy way
S0262	and it's it's it's it's keep them plug in because language doesn't
S0261	yes
S0262	it's not something you can consume overnight you can't just go and buy a bag
S0261	no you need to need to be ongoing
S0262	you you yeah that's what what's brilliant about language and make so much money well english particularly be because you you you've gotta you've gotta keep at it to get any good at it
S0261	mm mm
S0262	so that's why there be always gonna be scalability use the english language as a product
S0261	yes
S0262	well maybe not scalability but
S0261	yeah longevity
S0262	longevity
S0261	erm right erm so do that kind of get us to a point
S0262	i think so
S0261	yeah
S0262	for mobile technology
S0261	right
S0262	yeah
S0261	okay so in that context if you be consider how one let's say there's product x and product x need to be deliver then the from our point of view the things that one need to have access or or to or no be the the technological delivery of such stuff
S0262	yeah get your hand on everything that you can find that they're talk about so you'd go through you'd go and you know you'd you'd go and find someone in vietnam and go can i have a look at your phone and can i have a look at how it work and can you show me how it work and can you and you'd actually see it up close and and personal
S0261	so one could suggest that an action be to actually erm contact erm locals use the service so you you look at it on different level to see how it's deliver how people use it what it's deliver on any potential er elements where it's at different level so that could be on different devices
S0262	and the thing be be that you you gotta understand the structure of the british council and how it operate because the british council need content providers they can either choose to have erm you know managers who er assess the quality of content but who know they might be outsource the content to
S0261	a large provider pearson
S0262	they might be find someone who just fuck write lesson plan and fuck come up with new ideas for english every single fuck day erm so whether we could provide content to someone like the british council or whether they're actually a close a close off
S0261	close shop
S0262	content creator themselves but the suggestion be be that you know okay well do british council who be in vietnam who be in china but you're not gonna be the only people there
S0261	no
S0262	and i think you can bet that there'll be pretty other substantial company do similar things but perhaps with different mobile erm erm
S0261	company
S0262	company
S0261	mm
S0262	yep
S0261	erm so
S0262	and you gotta think about nokia because if nokia isn't actually do all that well in the global market
S0261	yeah but they're try to change that
S0262	well
S0261	they're back into the smartphone market
S0262	well er but clearly they're
S0261	mm
S0262	funny they're go around this bite too they're on the the lower scale as well
S0261	er when what do you mean sorry
S0262	well smartphone mean you know you gotta have a certain income to be able to find a to to to to buy a smartphone
S0261	yeah so maybe they're just keep their niche be at a different level
S0262	but china you you know not everyone can afford a smartphone
S0261	that's right so they're they're
S0262	so why be they
S0261	carry on make
S0262	yeah
S0261	the lower level phone so everybody else have technologically move on and nokia's go well there's still a market to supply all this stuff so we still manufacture that stuff for people
S0262	right so they've differentiate
S0261	at at a lower price
S0262	again in the market
S0261	to the market yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah
S0262	so you know what what we'd all think be be western we'd go it's all about three g four g
S0261	mm
S0262	it's all about the next one the next one the next one
S0261	exactly
S0262	what we forget be probably all of these other countries in the develop world be still use
S0261	still operate yeah yeah yeah
S0262	stuff we have about five eight nine ten years ago
S0261	at a yeah er yes of course of course
S0262	but it's still gonna be useful to them the technology the mobile technology with the right way of get it on the phone already what's the word instal like that's what nokia life be it's already instal with english content on it jeez that's that's clever cos you're already get an appetite go for it
S0261	yes that's right i mean erm that's no different than a lot of other delivery systems to do with different products which be inherently it's like windows windows be a part of a of the majority of a certain type of pc right
S0262	let's just talk about
S0261	yeah
S0262	phone mobile phone yeah
S0261	but that's er it's an example of
S0262	yeah yeah
S0261	of build in delivery system
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah so
S0262	but that's slightly different because i think what i'm say be and you're gonna get to the tech bite in a minute but what i'm say be be that there's content someone's write it and then someone have decide how that content fit into the tool and then how that tool sit inside the mobile phone technology
S0261	so you can say that there be different level of content that be deliver to different devices same message but present in different ways because you've get basic middle top end deliver to one g three g four g right so
S0262	yeah
S0261	you've actually get several different versions of of the content that be deliver at the same time to different customers
S0262	and now you've triple or quadruple your market
S0261	your output yeah and your market yeah yeah so it's stack
S0262	yeah
S0261	it's lot lot of layer to it
S0262	content and you've hit already four of five different type of generation of mobile phone
S0261	mm yes so
S0262	so who's who's do that technology
S0261	yeah but can before we yes
S0262	yeah
S0261	before we move on i just wanna capture capture er what i be try to say
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm and forget it so erm
S0261	that er that annoy me erm but we're say that there be different level let's just summarise this there be different level of content deliver to different technological devices now erm different technological tech devices erm so what i be otherwise gonna try and get in there be british council they er have all of these different level different people provide the content
S0262	er we don't know that
S0261	we don't know that erm so from our point of view that's what i want to make a point about the british council have go onto these different countries and they've create a strategic connection that's very high it's not something that we have the the ability to do
S0262	no
S0261	so we we we be pitch to be in a different level where you're actually work with these outfit or for these outfit or the connection to those outfit as a pathway to deliver your product
S0262	i think
S0261	because you don't wanna go in at the top level because you might find that difficult
S0262	i think if you could provide content if you even if you could provide content you'd get screw by the british council erm cos they'd copyright it and everything and it wouldn't be yours er i i i actually just don't think they would go there i'm i could be wrong but i think you'd get shaft by straight off
S0261	yeah well they basically say that we hire you as a consultant and therefore everything we have be our copyright
S0262	right what i think you do be you go you you interrogate that market and find out what the actual product look like and you find all the different type of users and then you think about a service that you add value to the way that they're use the technology so your service and it's get nothing to do with the british council you're say to the british council thank you for do the legwork and provide us with all this stuff but now seriously we've gotta show these people how to maximise how to use it because when they're walk round on their mobile phone it's not obvious to them what they're mean to be do how be they mean to practice pronunciation for example how be they mean to get the you know all these kinds of question be where you erm go to erm some other people and you go ah now what be we do here be we suggest that actually we're use mobile technology as a way to mainstream erm people into language class cos that's actually the traditional way of learn a language or be it that we're actually say to them you can have a blend experience you can come sometimes to some of our service but you also can knock around just with your phone and and see how far you go
S0261	right okay so i mean the the that lead onto er another question which be people be deliver this service but but how be it reinforce what
S0262	how do you learn
S0261	how do you learn it
S0262	how do you learn to use the mobile
S0261	mm
S0262	to get the language experience cos that to me be not obvious
S0261	no no but er let's put that aside let's er they have to learn the how to use the mobile to have access to the service
S0262	yeah
S0261	right so erm we're not in a
S0262	but can you ask that put that question down cos that's important
S0261	right so say that again
S0262	how do you use the technology the mobile phone technology
S0261	yeah yeah
S0262	to learn the language
S0261	yes and that's the bigger picture of erm see how the service work and erm er pick out some of those point about how do somebody get from basic to some kind of competent level through this through this process
S0262	yeah
S0261	over what period of time
S0262	yeah
S0261	because there be good examples online of people who be try to train people to learn language in three months
S0262	mm
S0261	right so speed be of the essence
S0262	mm
S0261	so if you can provide somebody a good service on the back of you know you can learn off look at how westerners be do it for themselves
S0262	mm
S0261	between themselves
S0262	mm
S0261	so be that a model that you can then approach to a a foreigner who be try to learn the language as a basic
S0262	mm mm
S0261	yeah because the presumably if you can take those core you can say it doesn't matter who it be what level what language we've get this core mechanism which be if you do this you er there must be reinforcement now er i imagine a lot of this be do through visual media high end delivery through video et cetera
S0262	mm
S0261	which won't exist on a cheap
S0262	mm
S0261	er device but it will exist on the new technologies with the right ict et cetera four g whatever
S0262	mm
S0261	so there could well be er develop countries which be look to implement that erm as as as a start because instead of invest in infrastructure which be crap stuff that go under the grind they've jump that technological gap and they're put in cell phone straight up
S0262	mm
S0261	so their investment go up like that
S0262	mm
S0261	straight away the quality of their investment be huge because they haven't have to spend all this money in the past
S0262	mm
S0261	they don't have to keep an old system go
S0262	mm i mean it's in a way it's
S0261	so they can actually jump the jump the gap a lot better
S0262	this be what australia should be do forget the fuck broadband network
S0261	yeah i know
S0262	just fuck go mobile technology
S0261	yes yeah but erm er well and and i think some people would argue well it's a dead investment erm but
S0262	which one
S0261	the the broadband thing but but
S0262	yeah well every australian you talk to roll their eye about it
S0261	mm erm er mm i don't know enough about the the future of where it's go but i er i it it be something that be expandable if you have the right core of of wire in the grind you can expand it to in some kind of element of of degree
S0262	so what do mobile technology use satellite
S0261	yeah they use a satellite so it's different and the capacity of it be a bite different too because satellite can only be a certain size in the sky can't do everything and that you know what happen when you get too many people all in one place the network get overload so that's when you go to the wire because it's hardwired that's why it work better because because of a variety of reason but so they're complementary in a way yeah
S0262	well write that down because then if they're in a complementary relationship a value add service could be a complementary service to one or to the other
S0261	er a value add service of delivery
S0262	so if you be if you be complement yeah if you've get two complementary er technologies one be the mobile and the one be the er network or whatever
S0262	broadband whatever their country have if you be try to complement that you can complement by add value so if somebody's struggle with how to use their mobile you could complement that by put up a website on the internet which tell you how to use the mobile
S0261	well well part part of the message be normally nowadays when you deliver content you deliver it in a variety of mechanisms and and format you know so
S0262	but that's in the western world
S0261	mm yeah but what you're say be be the same thing
S0262	i be think the i be think develop countries
S0261	yes we should note that
S0262	yeah this be er i'm not think at all about you know where we're at i'm think
S0261	erm delivery of but there there be a point which be delivery of content in develop countries erm because as as as an output as a business output right you can actually fee a new chain which be you deliver you you create it all at the same time as if you're in a western block you only deliver part of that because the technology be of of a certain level when the technology er
S0262	catch up
S0261	you can actually go through another cycle
S0262	mm
S0261	of reintroduce it and resubmitting it
S0262	mm
S0261	for the new market
S0262	mm
S0261	the new technological market but you've already do all that work in the in the background which predominantly be just the output through what something that you've gotta do at the time
S0262	mm
S0261	yeah erm or that you could choose you're just do it at a certain level you output that and you go back and recreate something use the same content visually describe
S0262	yeah alright yeah
S0261	you know what i mean
S0262	yeah yeah
S0261	then there's the opportunity to go round the round the wash machine again if that's the case
S0262	what so there's so there's a sustainability factor that's what you're say
S0261	for the product
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah that can survive
S0262	well you should write that down sustainability
S0261	erm that have er a an additional longevity er longer life through that mechanism mm
S0262	yeah it's what you call product life cycle
S0261	yes erm but we're kind of talk about a lot of detail here er i mean i'm
S0262	yeah i'm try to look at the bigger picture stuff yeah
S0261	yeah i i think we should kind of step back and and look at some of the bigger picture and part of
S0262	well some of the things you need to research you need to research you need to research that relationship between nokia and british council erm so you could look at nokia and i could look at british council erm and then you then you need to find out on both side who be nokia's competitors in the same countries that we're talk about let's just choose vietnam and china
S0261	before we before we go there er
S0262	i'm just tell you how you find out more information
S0261	yeah yeah yeah that's that's
S0262	but why would you stop me from that cos what i'm tell you be really good
S0261	no carry on sorry
S0262	it's just that it's not the same way you approach things
S0261	sorry er just carry on
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah carry on
S0262	this be the way my business brain work it's that's how i've be train to think of market
S0261	that's fine that's fine you don't need to i'm just i've stop right so carry on
S0262	okay so you'd you'd find out who nokia's erm you'd find out if there be another type of partnership like nokia and british council so you'd find out and then you would just do erm as much sort of swot analysis on both of those erm and then you would look for erm you would look at the ways that big company can't always provide everything to everyone brilliantly that's the question i always say to myself be there's only so much they can do they can't do it all and they can't do it all at a personal level that some people would pay money for and i'm particularly think about these er the richer ones in these countries who can afford to pay for a little bite of value add service use the cheap cheap stuff though
S0261	so what you're say be be if you be gonna tap the market you would try and tap the market of those who be will to pay for a product
S0262	yeah
S0261	and of course then you're
S0262	or service
S0261	or service and therefore you're pitch erm er er more of er a higher quality higher price which obviously deliver more profit rather than i mean you can look at it on two ways you can say we're deliver this product at this level but we have a charity arm which be deliver this at that level which give you the benefit of
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0261	you're you're not just pander to the wealthy you're provide something also but it's a similar business stream
S0262	yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	you you normally make a splash if you go in with the community value to start with and you work away at it and then you start build relationships with the wealthier ones
S0261	er yeah but er i'm just make that connection that you know
S0262	well write that down as well because you you might start from the wealthy way i would suggest that you get a name for yourself quickly if you go on the community level into a develop country
S0262	cos you make those contact at the government level once you go in on a community charity what's it call thing non profit organisation then er you start make you know ngo type relationship type people who be then also very well connect cos they've be in the country forever and then you get to meet the wealthy people
S0261	right erm okay that that sound that sound cool so er erm that's get you to that point
S0262	mm
S0261	so if we move on from there erm if we now step back
S0262	mm
S0261	and we look at the bigger picture
S0262	mm
S0261	and we say erm what be it that we could put together that fit something like that
S0262	okay but always remember
S0261	without the detail
S0262	we're in no we're in research mode
S0261	yeah i know
S0262	so we've get to think of big picture research you've get to cos we're not we're not at the stage yet to offer anything we haven't get anything to offer
S0261	no my my okay i'll put my my question differently which be erm be it likely that we would fit into a market like this
S0262	er well this be what you have to explore
S0261	right so all of that's er really where i'm come from be be be it erm go to provide us value to research this straight up
S0262	well what you would do to justify your further research and development be you would actually do erm er a you would do a erm
S0261	a swot analysis
S0262	no you would just basically list financial state er financial data so you'd go how much be the world market erm
S0262	how much be the you know how much be so you'd find out how big your market be and
S0261	yes
S0262	how much money be be churn around inside that industry
S0261	and whether it's growth
S0262	and i think you would then
S0261	yeah
S0262	split it up into segment and go
S0261	mm
S0262	if we look at this one how much money could we make
S0261	yes
S0262	because it's already make so much money
S0261	that that that's fine
S0262	yeah that's how you'd do it
S0261	yeah and right erm okay so well that be that be potentially something that we would have to do along the way as well
S0262	well i'd suggest that i mean i know quite a lot about the market because obviously i've work in it but if you want some erm sort of reassurance that i mean i say the market the industry the the global industry and even develop country industry er would be worth your while to explore erm research and development then you just need to put down billions of dollars and then you'd be look at it and go billions of dollar mean that somebody's pay for this there's profit that's be make
S0261	and where's the money come from
S0262	and who's make money and how be they make it
S0261	mm mm erm okay well maybe er what i'm try to get er a a a context of be that stuff sound cool what things can do while he's away to fee into this kind of thing
S0262	well i would say for your own information you need to know how big the market be how big the industries be you need to get the financial information so that when you go when you go you're go in with right i know how much this this industry be worth i know the worth of the industry
S0261	it's just that very high level information
S0262	but it's it's macro
S0261	mm
S0262	you've get the macro and then when you go in micro you understand the context of the macro you can always place it when you're talk to people within a macro context erm and then you know er when you're on the grind you're do the micro work erm and then you piece the macro and the micro together and you really then understand the industry
S0261	erm yes for er you you've kind of erm tack onto this quite quite erm be this just because it's something that's pop up that's er that's catch your eye or
S0262	well you can see it's an exercise in your analytical think of how you would approach any industry if you're interest in it
S0261	that that that that's right but my
S0262	so
S0261	my question be be that you've pick up on a particular thing out of out of a gazette that that demonstrate something
S0262	well only cos you ask me before you go to the shop can you talk let's talk about education
S0261	yes and
S0262	if you'd ask me to talk about something else i would've do the same thing
S0261	mm er er which be valuable so erm how do that help us also understand so out of that exercise we would understand how it's be do in other countries if it be as well
S0262	well i think you're learn how to break down break down an industry break down into a market apply some kind of analytical think in term of like you know how do i research where the opportunities might be and then once i've get a sniff or a whiff of something how do i go to that local environment that country or that particular city or wherever and find these people and find out whether my hunch be right or not my hypothesis be actually correct or not
S0261	okay so my i'm still wanna get to the point of do you see value in research this particular point
S0262	well i'm at the same point as you how can i answer that question unless i've do the actual homework
S0261	be there other different point that be worthwhile consider
S0262	what point
S0261	er i dunno er er erm what i'm interest in be try to establish a thread of something that that both of us see
S0262	why don't you just get off your chest what you're try to say cos you're ask me question when i think you've already get some of your own point of view
S0261	no no i don't i don't know erm my point of view be that
S0262	well in order to answer that kind of question you'd already have to start think about ask that question to me you must be think something else
S0261	no no no i'm not think of anybody anything else i'm certainly think that there's a thread here be there another thread that actually you see value or you have awareness of that be worthwhile research that you would rather research in context of look to build some kind of business stream
S0262	so you're ask me be there another area other than english language another english you know be there another industry
S0261	or education relate you know
S0262	no look i'm in the business of education if anybody ask me to do anything i would never go outside of the the the the the business of education i think what you're ask me be be that be you just look at the english language education or be you interest in other aspects of education
S0261	yes exactly
S0262	yeah
S0261	in context of business if we what we talk about be if if we try and kind of er have a vision of what we we might maybe do we don't know yeah but erm that's what i'm try to get some tangibility about you know
S0262	yeah erm no not no i i'm not business wise no i can't i can't see anything right now that i think be erm er er a viable way of make some money
S0261	a er er a right goer
S0262	yeah
S0261	okay so if er if we if we simply look at it in context of what we might like to do together
S0262	yeah
S0261	and we don't know whether there's money in it or not but er imagination
S0262	yeah
S0261	in in relation to the skills that we've get
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah so you've get the business and the education side of things and i've get a tech side and a project management side
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm and we both have an interest in work together in in that kind of area
S0262	and and we don't wanna be a middle man
S0261	no
S0262	we're not gonna go to british council and go we'll fuck work really hard for you and you'll take all the fuck credit
S0261	absolutely so we wanna
S0262	we we be our own outfit
S0261	yes
S0262	but we've figure out exactly why we're our own outfit and how we remain our own outfit yeah
S0261	er and and and we want to have our strength
S0262	yeah
S0261	on the background of the product and service that we're go to provide
S0262	yeah
S0261	we don't want to be effectively work for somebody else
S0262	no
S0262	no
S0261	cos that's what we're try to get away from
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah so even as a as a as an an expert a consultant in something we we don't want to unless there's wad of cash in it and it's
S0262	yeah
S0261	the the market you but you can't do that from the start anyway you need to be
S0262	yeah it's it's you er yeah
S0261	you need to've start something
S0262	it's easier to just take it like erm you know you take your vegetables to the marketplace and you sell them on that day
S0261	yes
S0262	if you start on that concept
S0261	mm
S0262	you find your consumer
S0261	mm
S0262	they pay you ten quid for something
S0261	yes
S0262	you get money through the door
S0261	absolutely
S0262	and you know you don't have to worry about big company clients
S0261	no
S0262	and all that fuck shit
S0261	none of none of that stuff
S0262	you just phone the consumers
S0261	no bureaucracy
S0262	and you sell them something
S0261	yes
S0262	you get money through the door and then once you really understand what their needset be
S0261	mm
S0262	you can perhaps work your way through into other areas
S0261	er er er er yes that's right
S0262	that's what i would do
S0261	and and part of it be be ensure that you've get a a stable cash flow on the background of an a simple product to start with
S0262	yeah but the credentials i have for the english language area
S0261	mm
S0262	be enough even if i want to rub shoulder with the british council people erm you know
S0261	to to roll on in
S0262	i can chat away to them and find out information
S0261	yes okay so there be
S0262	if they you know have have a few drink on board and be talk about what they be do
S0261	mm
S0262	erm or you know it it be sort of like erm just sort of rub shoulder in the right ho chi minh city
S0261	mm
S0262	just an expat thing
S0261	mm
S0262	british council and some other people turn up
S0261	yeah
S0262	and i would go chat chat chat chat chat and you'd go chat chat chat chat chat
S0261	mm
S0262	and i'd be chatty teacher person you'd be chatty sort of whatever tech kind of project manager person
S0261	tech guy yeah but i'm interest in deliver service through tech to people
S0262	yeah
S0261	so that's the other arm of it mm
S0262	well and actually i think if you always say you're a project manager
S0261	mm
S0262	it always make sense
S0261	yes of course
S0262	cos you just say i manage project
S0261	yes
S0262	and if they think oh fuck i've get this project that need manage
S0261	mm mm mm
S0262	what sort of thing can you do
S0261	right
S0262	i've get prince whatever
S0261	mm mm mm
S0261	yeah
S0262	credibility be already straight away there
S0261	yeah of course
S0262	you don't need to tell em anything else
S0261	no
S0262	don't even tell em you're an engineer
S0261	absolutely
S0262	not interest
S0261	mm mm mm
S0262	just wanna know you know have you get those skills to transfer into any project
S0261	yes absolutely of course
S0262	yeah
S0261	so erm
S0262	so you're not a technical person you're you're a manager of technical people
S0261	yes that's right
S0262	and if we have a company you would be manage those technical people
S0261	that's a very good point
S0262	yeah
S0261	that's a very good point that you make erm so if we carry on with what skills we've get and er and we talk about what uncle be talk about
S0262	i've just sorry sorry
S0262	i've just think about this the the way you and i would manage project would be so entirely different
S0261	yes
S0262	so that be er that be in term of er uncle there would be a massive problem there okay cos er i it make complete sense that you're the project manager but remember i've also have project manager experience through filmmaking et cetera et cetera
S0261	mm mm
S0262	so
S0261	yeah but that's about share the knowledge and try to find a common path together
S0262	it
S0261	that that that do say well when you're deal with this type of project this be how it's deliver and as a project manager i learn er elements of how that project be put together so the the the core system of manage a project be be the same then you get people who specialise in certain type of project which carry information that you don't understand or have awareness of to start with
S0262	okay
S0261	
S0262	if you want to er build an oil rig
S0261	yes
S0262	build an oil rig
S0261	mm
S0262	who's at the top of the chain apart from the ceo who make er you know whatever the company i'm not i'm i'm say people on the oil rig or around the sea where they're try to actually fuck get this thing in the grind who's there
S0261	well you'd er you'd er you
S0262	who's there who's the top top honcho
S0261	you well you would er have a very large engineer company
S0262	yeah
S0261	who who's probably a consultant that have be hire by the company bp whoever
S0262	yeah
S0261	to build such a thing like er be halliburton
S0262	yeah
S0261	erm er and er you're talk about massive contract so the people at the top would be the ceo of the consultant company the ceo of the the er oil company if that's what you mean
S0262	one down from that
S0261	in term of the operation on the grind
S0262	yeah the operations managers
S0261	you you you would have erm you would have a strategic board which would run the project specific for the
S0262	can you write can you can you make a diagram of this
S0261	right okay so right up the top you would have the project board yeah and that project board would be make up of representatives from erm er various company company and the client yeah so that could be the er you could have a delivery through a variety of
S0262	just keep draw and i'll go to the toilet
S0261	yeah okay
S0262	and then you can explain it to me when you get back
S0261	yeah okay
S0261	that sound cool i'll just pause this for a moment
S0262	where you be want to be when you leave your engineer career cos you've always want to be a project manager and you be a project manager as well in some job so that's interest isn't it but what would say er the what would uncle say about that
S0261	well you see i don't think that what we see here be relevant to to our situation
S0262	okay so how no not not our now let's start talk about you
S0261	yes okay me
S0262	right so what so what be you do now
S0261	okay so erm so in what's in my head
S0262	mm
S0261	the way er if we consider that we've get time here yeah and that what we wanna try and do be over that time try and connect a few dot together so if we consider what we be talk about the other day it be the idea that you and i work together on some collaborative stream to be able to work together in business to be er you know to to deliver whatever products whatever value to whoever yeah so if we say that on this timeline that be over here where we connect yeah so this be the period lead up to that where this be this be full time yeah and so to start with where we're at over here be me in this one and you in that one right and we have get to both come together and converge at this point over time so here at the moment you're at and then we might consider that over time you're at plus we'll call it b for business yeah
S0262	or e for more education
S0261	plus e
S0262	yeah
S0261	b plus e yeah
S0262	yeah
S0261	well you're at the moment you're plus e
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah okay so you're er you're do both of those
S0262	but i'm also plus b too cos we're already start about er talk about business
S0261	er mm mm yeah that's but just hear me out
S0262	okay
S0261	you know so where i'm at at the moment be that i'm actually in a subset of of this b
S0262	right
S0261	so what i'm look at try to do if i call that d b yeah alright what i'm try to do be that that's 's business at the moment which we want to try and align in such a way that we get the most out of this that feed into that into the business
S0262	that mean we need to know what b be
S0261	there be part of that
S0262	yeah
S0261	but if from my point of view if i can step back and go ethereally there be certain things that we wanna operate and know how to operate here that i can be learn now that that that already feed into that straight up so part of that be the business operation side of things
S0262	jeez that's reverse engineer
S0261	well i'm in advance of it
S0262	not not
S0261	i'm in advance of it i need to operate a business now
S0262	yeah i know but not many business people go about try to approach build a business with with sort of retrospective way of look at it
S0261	well i'm not retrospectively look at it i'm here now lead up to it
S0262	yeah but you've you've pick a point in the future
S0261	i'm in advance i'm in advance
S0262	no er no
S0261	i'm i'm lead up to it
S0262	no okay alright
S0261	i i'm already if we've get that i'm already in b here this just happen to be my b not our b
S0262	we're here now yeah
S0261	yes
S0262	this be the future
S0261	yes
S0262	yeah this be the future's future
S0261	yes
S0262	okay and that's like b d b yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	so in order to see the future's future you'd need to know what the future be and then from the future you'd need to know where you're at now
S0261	yes that's right so i know where i'm at now
S0262	but we haven't get a crystal ball though
S0261	no no no you i understand what you're say but i'm try to take it we don't know what that be right that's
S0262	no so how can you decide what to do now to fee into that if we don't know what that be
S0261	no no no but er think
S0262	that's what you say
S0261	right okay so if we think about the things that we want how we want to deliver this stuff it's in a digital format it's online all of those kind of things that's what i'm say that there's
S0262	oh but be it we haven't do our research yet we don't even know what b be we're just talk about ideas at the moment they're not even concrete
S0261	er that that's right but if we put two and two together what we
