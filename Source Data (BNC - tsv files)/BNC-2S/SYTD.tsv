S0084	yes my love
S0135	tell me about your panic attack then
S0084	oh it's really weird though where do like where do they come from
S0135	so when be the first one again when you be at that party with your friend
S0084	the work's do
S0135	and you felt like you be in a shadow and you didn't want to say anything
S0084	yeah well i suppose that like that often happen like i feel like like i don't necessarily be the one to make the effort
S0135	but then do it subside
S0084	well yeah i suppose i just sort of carry on and just didn't give into it i just think well look calm yourself down calm down
S0135	yeah
S0084	but i really want to leave and i be just really grateful that be like oh yeah i wanna go as well
S0135	yeah
S0084	um
S0135	do you feel sick
S0084	i just felt yeah i couldn't catch my breath i felt sick i be shake i just think oh well um i just tell i'm just go to the loo i'll be back in a minute
S0135	yeah
S0084	and just sit on the toilet for a while
S0135	sort of compose yourself
S0084	yeah i be just like just calm down it's fine um stop be an idiot and er but that make it worse cos then you sort of put pressure on yourself
S0135	yeah
S0084	um but it be fine i dunno i mean i'm just hop that the more i sort of put myself out of my comfort zone i think i i think that's what it be i think because i haven't do anything scary or anything that challenge me for a really long time like i haven't be travel i haven't do anything i haven't take a new job well the last few years have be really
S0135	you have take a new job in your
S0084	yeah but it doesn't really count cos it's not well
S0135	yeah it do it's it's a new team it's new work
S0084	yeah yeah it's get its
S0135	it's a new build floor it's a new desk
S0084	yeah
S0135	it's a new new thing
S0084	yeah it's it have its own challenge i suppose
S0135	yeah
S0084	i suppose the thing be like you get to this year and you start think like what have i get to show for myself i live in a crack den i'm only earn twenty whatever grand a year
S0135	wait just watch everything that you're say right now because that will drag me down with you
S0084	no because it's all relative it's all relative to what you think you should have achieve by the time you're thirty
S0135	right
S0084	and in my head when i be twenty one i think by the time i'm thirty i will have at least have a man if not be marry
S0135	yeah
S0084	and with a potential for children at some time in my thirties and now that i'm here i think well there's no man on the scene therefore kinder would be a a number of years later
S0135	yeah
S0084	could i be a single mum because you've get you've get entertain the notion that you're just not datable which be possible i might not be and in which case i er wanna have kid so then i'll just get er some sperm but i need to be financially stable in order to do that and i wanna do all the things that i wanna do before i entertain that idea so
S0135	that's just like put pressure on yourself
S0084	i think because there's no it's almost like because there's no limit to the possibilities
S0135	mm
S0084	it's really difficult to then think okay then what do i want to do and the more i think about it the more i panic the more i think oh my god well what be i gonna do with myself i can't i can't think of something that i wanna do so much that i'm work towards it
S0135	mm
S0084	like i don't know whether i should move here or there or do this job or that job and then start to really panic myself and i think just calm down it's fine but the more time that i get panic about it the worse it seem to be so i think i just need to make a plan just any plan whatever the plan be even if it turn out to be shit at least it's a plan
S0135	yeah
S0084	and at least it mean that i'll be work towards something so
S0135	i wonder if it's anything to do with the fact that um and be get marry and um like we we be both single we have each other
S0084	we have each other
S0135	and be single
S0084	yeah
S0135	erm
S0084	which be fine you but you sort of get to this age and think you would have find somebody and only because it's like four years
S0135	mm
S0084	single for four years be quite a long time
S0135	yeah but you've have blokes in that time though you've have options and dalliances and
S0084	but
S0135	it just hasn't be the right one
S0084	i mean i be only half joke when i say you lose a part of your soul each time
S0135	oh right
S0084	cos people do like it be quite depress with each one that you can rule out cos that's a lot of men that you're rule out and a lot of different type of men my ear keep um
S0135	fill up with fluid and shall we drain it let's lance it do it go muffley
S0084	yeah i have a bath earlier maybe that's what
S0135	oh no you're gonna get your ear syringe
S0084	there's water in it really oh
S0135	don't do that
S0084	just
S0135	don't get it syringe don't do that never let them come at you with a needle
S0135	not towards your ear it's quite a vital organ
S0084	well it's because i be get what i think be my wisdom teeth come through but the pain be also like here as well
S0135	shit man just wisdom teeth
S0084	um
S0135	maybe you'll be wise when they come through
S0084	more wise that'd be nice
S0135	wiser older and wiser
S0084	well you'd think something there must be something good about age there isn't anything good so far there's nothing that spring immediately to mind
S0135	no i think we should maybe your plan should be to invent a time machine
S0084	that'd be quite nice i'll i'll start work on that
S0135	but have the pressure come from anywhere else or be they all completely self
S0084	i think they're self impose
S0135	right i think it's part of the western culture that you know you think you should be marry and have children
S0084	own a house
S0135	and have a career and own a house all that shit
S0084	mm
S0135	but if you go into different culture and like say for example in germany no one own their own house
S0084	yeah
S0135	no one i didn't
S0084	this be what i keep tell myself
S0135	i didn't know a single person in the embassy that own their own house
S0084	mm
S0135	not a single one of them um
S0084	it's a different culture
S0135	it's just a completely different culture in italy the men will live with their mums until their mid thirties
S0084	mm
S0135	um
S0084	we're in that we're in the shit generation
S0135	yeah
S0084	i mean our parent have it quite good
S0135	yeah
S0084	cos they be the baby boomers so they get all the house so
S0135	yeah
S0084	mortgage be more readily available there be more opportunities for work
S0135	mm
S0084	but the generation before that our grandparent's generation have to live through the war so they be the shit generation
S0135	yeah
S0084	so i think it's just gonna be that our kid will have a good generation
S0135	reciprocal yeah well not
S0084	unless we fuck up the world
S0135	i'm not have any but yours maybe
S0084	yeah
S0135	i'll be their aunty erm
S0084	yeah
S0135	maybe i don't know maybe your like biological clock's kick in or something
S0084	something's go on
S0135	yeah
S0084	i think well what i need be a plan
S0135	okay
S0084	and i feel very listless and i think as soon as i get the job at the press
S0135	yeah
S0084	i be a bite like right okay so now what
S0135	because that's what
S0084	within a matter of moments
S0135	yeah that might be because that's what you'd be always work towards
S0084	and you if you lose that
S0135	and then you get it and you be like bang i get it
S0084	and and now what
S0135	now what
S0084	yeah
S0135	yeah
S0084	and if you just spend your life work towards something cos when you be younger your parent be like well you're gonna go to university
S0135	yeah
S0084	there's never really an option not to
S0135	yeah
S0084	i mean they say there's not but there isn't
S0135	yeah
S0084	so that's what you spend your life work towards and then you finish uni and you're a bite like oh now what do i do
S0135	yeah
S0084	sort of bum around for a while the you make another plan
S0135	yeah
S0084	and that follow through and you think okay well that's great get that
S0135	yeah
S0084	well now so now what
S0135	mm mm
S0084	and now i've i've get a job that i really enjoy i really like my job which be quite fortunate i know
S0135	yeah
S0084	i know it's like i'm quite lucky to enjoy my job
S0135	yeah
S0084	but at the same time it be a job i could do anywhere for any publish house in any business stream
S0135	mm
S0084	it's not specific to elt so again i'm quite fortunate in that regard but it do mean that i have to find a way of make my skill set unique to an employer in another country rather than just hire somebody that they have there
S0135	yeah yeah
S0084	so that's that's the problem i couldn't apply for a job here for a job abroad because they would just hire somebody there
S0135	mm
S0084	so i would have to move there but it it i mean it that's why i would struggle to go somewhere where that i didn't speak the language
S0135	what what be it that make you think that you wanna move abroad change
S0084	it's just yeah just a just a new challenge just to see more of the world and every time i see somewhere new i get the feel that i'm not go to see everywhere
S0135	okay
S0084	which be just unrealistic you're not gonna see everywhere
S0135	yeah
S0084	i'd like to visit every country at least once
S0135	mm okay
S0084	and i'm thirty now and i've not really see that much
S0135	okay
S0084	i've see some so i mean that's the immediate plan
S0135	mm mm
S0084	cos there's no point stay at home to save for a mortgage cos i'd never be able to scrape together the deposit
S0135	no
S0084	even though they're say on er rightmove i be have a look the other day that there's they've bring something out to help first time buyers all this sort of gobbins so like which if you're still interest you should look at
S0135	mm
S0084	but i'm still never go to be able to get together half of the deposit for round here
S0135	not on your own
S0084	not on my own
S0135	and that it's not just the deposit it's about find a lender
S0084	mm mm
S0135	who will lend your mortgage
S0084	exactly
S0135	because your mortgage will probably be in the region of you know six hundred to nine hundred pound a month
S0084	yeah
S0135	could you afford that
S0084	no
S0135	could you find a lender to lend it to you even if you get the deposit
S0084	mm
S0135	but i mean do you actually want to own a house or do you think you should own one
S0084	i'd like to own a house
S0135	right
S0084	at the same time it's not on my list of priorities
S0135	yeah
S0084	versus travel around the world with a backpack on my back do you know what i mean
S0135	right yeah
S0084	like it would be nice to have the stability that if i own a house here i could rent it out i could pay off my mortgage and i could naff off and i would be able to come back to something
S0135	mm
S0084	cos my worry be if i go away i don't know what's gonna happen to the job market
S0135	mm
S0084	i don't know what's gonna happen to house price i mean
S0135	mm
S0084	if i go away and come back it's go to be difficult
S0135	mm
S0084	and i need to leave myself enough money to come back to and that's why i want to work in the same field that i'm work in now
S0135	mm
S0084	because i don't want er to come back and an employer say well why do you go fruit pick for a year when you have a perfectly good career so
S0135	yeah
S0084	i don't want to go fruit pick but
S0135	mm
S0084	and at least in that regard i have find a job that i do want to do so if i be to move abroad that would be the type of job that i be look for so at least that would be some sort of guide
S0135	mm mm
S0084	i don't know
S0135	i think
S0084	i feel like i think about it all the time and i never actually do anything so
S0135	i think what you need to do be you need to get either a journal or a massive blank piece of paper and write it all down to try and untangle this web because i think you've get a lot of uh compete ideas but you're not clear what your priority be like you don't know
S0084	yeah i don't know
S0135	what be the most important to you and i think you're be influence by as one be by i dunno parental expectations friend's expectations the media and
S0084	exactly
S0135	what everyone think everyone should be do and colleagues and go for promotion and go for a house and do this and all that whereas actually if you want to go and fruit pick with a back pack on your back and return to your mum's spare room
S0084	mm
S0135	if you be super happy travel and that's the thing that make you happy that's what you have to go for
S0084	do that
S0135	but i think that you probably need to just sort of take some time you know sort of get it all down on paper maybe untangle it all and figure out what be it that's actually that what make you happy
S0084	yeah
S0135	and what do you want and there's like a couple of like techniques um one er you might have hear of it like the death bed test or something and it's probably quite complicate and you probably shouldn't do it unless there's someone's who's a grow up but like you know if you're on your death bed
S0084	mm
S0135	would you look back and think i wish i'd do this or that be a bad idea or i should have do more about that i wish i hadn't even bother worry about that cos that's like a technique
S0084	mm
S0135	of try to help you figure out what's important
S0084	mm
S0135	and all that other kind of stuff
S0084	mm mm well that all make sense yeah
S0135	um yeah i mean in theory they'll all probably make a lot of sense but in reality it's quite difficult um you know just to kind of try and boil it all down because
S0084	mm
S0135	there's load and load of different cause of panic attack i mean with me i think i be bore and so
S0084	oh right
S0135	my brain
S0084	mm
S0135	would start analyse and over analyse everything and like be like super um sensitive to what i be feel
S0084	oh okay
S0135	like oh god i feel a bite sick oh yes i actually i feel really really sick i'm gonna be sick i've gotta go sort of thing
S0084	oh god
S0135	so i think it mine be kind of like from boredom
S0084	mm
S0135	and also like loneliness
S0084	mm
S0135	and like a lack of people to talk to and stuff like that
S0084	mm
S0135	um and so yours be probably go to be quite a different cause erm
S0084	too much go on in my brain
S0135	well maybe and it's your body maybe your body's way of say hold the phone
S0084	uh
S0135	right you know i don't i mean i don't know we're all just guess aren't we
S0084	yeah yeah
S0135	erm but you're a hundred percent right when you say and when and everything say that you have to carry on it's so true face your fear
S0084	oh man
S0135	that be so true
S0084	that's hard isn't it
S0135	it's absolutely terrify
S0084	mm
S0135	like me i haven't be out for a meal in quite a while
S0084	mm
S0135	because for whatever reason have get into me but i know
S0084	mm
S0135	the only way to get through it be to go along and do it and everything and eventually it will get busy erm busy easier
S0084	better
S0135	like when i didn't want to go fly anywhere
S0084	yeah
S0135	and i be absolutely terrify and the first four sort of three of four flight be absolutely horrendous i think i be gonna be sick i be sweat
S0084	mm
S0135	i be horror blah blah but now the last one i take fine absolutely fine
S0084	good
S0135	erm the thing be like even go out for a simple drink go out for coffee things like that
S0084	mm
S0135	a busy place whatever
S0084	mm
S0135	avoid it like the plague
S0084	mm
S0135	but you have to put yourself in it and you have to stick it out so you can prove to your body nothing dangerous happen it be okay and i survive it but by but by not go into it your body think you've get something to be scar of
S0084	yeah and that make it worse
S0135	and if you and if you run off before you've experience it
S0084	mm
S0135	that's how you build up the fear
S0084	yeah
S0135	it's the hardest thing in the world and that's why fear be sort of like self perpetuate like self fuel and everything
S0084	mm mm mm
S0135	and it's just so terrify when you're in the minute logically and rationally you can sit here and go yeah i use to love go out mosh it concert and
S0084	mm
S0135	er whatever and meet new people
S0084	be at a festival
S0135	and festivals and all that sort of stuff what's happen now why be i a bite why be i like query me and stuff like that you know cos it's not like a logical or a rational fear which make it really frustrate
S0084	yeah i think but that's the thing in in the moment that's what you're try to tell yourself you're try to calm yourself down but there's nothing logical or rational about it
S0135	no yeah
S0084	i think you're right you you know it be just about sort of pull together more of a plan and and more like more cohesion to my thoughts because at the moment it be just a massive jumble
S0135	it's a jumble
S0084	and that's what panic me
S0135	yeah
S0084	be that there's be that i'm age every day life be get away from me and i haven't get a plan
S0135	yeah
S0084	but at least if i be you know i be live in a crack den but it's okay cos i'm save money and it mean that in a year i'm go to be do something amaze
S0135	mm
S0084	but for now i can just take every day as it be and enjoy it
S0135	mm
S0084	because i'm work towards something
S0135	yeah
S0084	so i'm not live in the future i'm enjoy
S0135	yeah
S0084	now but i know that in a year's time or whenever there's gonna be another challenge there's go to be something interest and excite and then something to aim for
S0135	yeah
S0084	cos you do sort of inevitably get sweep up in the the wheel of the office and you know oh well will i get promote and will i get a bite more money and it's worth stay and
S0135	mm
S0084	i think if i stay there i would be live in for the next five years and i'm never go to meet a man here not that that's the be all and end all
S0135	yeah
S0084	but it's just dire for men and just socially really
S0135	mm
S0084	you know there's not an awful lot go on i think it's just i need to go and meet new people and just go and experience a few things and i never get the same buzz from anything as i do from when i travel and the last time i have that be when i be in australia and as lovely as croatia be it be very safe cos it be you know we be there together and a long time and despite the rain
S0135	yeah it's quite touristy yeah
S0084	it's quite touristy
S0135	it be the monsoon season
S0084	i don't know whether we pick the best date
S0135	it be august i mean what and what else can you do i mean
S0084	we do we do get to see some tortoise porn that be quite offensive
S0135	oh god like
S0084	rape of a turtle
S0135	chase for a rape yeah
S0084	erm there's not er you know i love it it be a really nice break but it wasn't the same as when i be in australia
S0135	that's not travel that be a holiday
S0084	that be like you know sort of ten days
S0135	yeah
S0084	nice couple of days in berlin a week in croatia live in our nice little house be you know nice and safe and easy
S0135	yeah
S0084	whereas when i be in australia i be on my own and i be go to see excite place and it be different like just have to fly between place and meet new people and i don't know it's just i get that buzz when i do that
S0135	yeah what's
S0084	and i get really excite and i live for that and like that's the most important thing
S0135	what's stop you from book a flight in two months and go with nicky over there
S0084	money financially i couldn't do it
S0135	and do you not have the fund
S0084	no cos you have to have five thousand us dollars in your bank account when you enter the country
S0135	mm if you
S0084	and your flight would be like fifteen hundred pound
S0135	if you have ten thousand pound would you
S0084	i'd go now i would get my passport
S0135	you would go
S0084	yeah it's just a question of fund i would just get on the first plane i would er drive to stanstead now in olive and i would get on the first flight
S0135	yeah
S0084	because really it's only money
S0135	yeah
S0084	and that's what stop me like if you know if i come into money now that's it i'd be off
S0135	yeah you wouldn't take a caravan and go around england with my ex boyfriend
S0084	it seem unlikely it seem pretty unlikely i mean the that's there's er time for that
S0135	yeah
S0084	when i'm old and decrepit if we haven't destroy the planet by then erm
S0135	planet yeah
S0084	er yes so i don't know i think i'm just gonna save like a beast like with these record it's obviously be really great to pay off my overdraft and i'll get another i'll get one payment in my next bank in my next pay check which will be
S0135	yeah
S0084	mid april and then the the last one will be mid may and i'll put that amount into my save account which will probably be like four or five hundred pound put that straight in
S0135	yeah
S0084	and that'll be the start of it and my mum's already say like if do move out in september cos if she doesn't go to berlin or
S0135	yep
S0084	stockholm she's just gonna move to she say but september be the date where she's move out come hell or high water
S0135	okay right
S0084	cos she's find it really tough
S0135	really why
S0084	i think when you finish uni it's horrendous isn't it because
S0135	i can't remember
S0084	reality bite i think you move home didn't you and i move home and
S0135	oh i can't remember yeah i don't know i can't remember
S0084	and you quite enjoy the temping cos it be always different place
S0135	yeah something different
S0084	and while you be do your erm civil service train you know you do quite a lot of that
S0135	ooh i don't i er generally don't know where i've be
S0084	two thousand and one
S0135	for the last twenty eight years
S0084	er twenty nine years erm
S0135	erm yes yes
S0084	but she's er i think she's not in a job she particularly enjoy
S0135	mm
S0084	and she's in where none of her friends be and she's live with my mum and
S0135	yeah
S0084	it's just i think reality be such it's such a hard fall when you finish uni like you think
S0135	yeah
S0084	what it's like when you're at uni and you go to the student union and you know everybody and
S0135	mm
S0084	every night you're do something and
S0135	yeah
S0084	you come down to reality with a quite a hard bang
S0135	yeah true true true yeah
S0084	so she's find it quite tough and i think my mum's find it hard go cos have never be very good at put on a brave front she if she's in a bad mood you'll know about it it's like live with a stroppy teenager and i mean i ought to er for all i remember er which i can't remember i be probably exactly the same
S0084	but it be at the time when my mum and dad be together when i be live in the house and
S0135	yeah
S0084	i think they be quite understand i think when i move back i didn't work for a few months because
S0135	okay
S0084	obviously you don't pay rent or anything i mean you're live with your parent
S0135	yeah
S0084	but now erm it's cos she's my mum my mum have obviously not get much money so she pay there's not mortgage on the house so she doesn't pay rent
S0135	yeah
S0084	but she pay i think she pay a hundred and fifty pound a month so that's like board basically like utilities and food
S0135	yeah
S0084	so it's pretty cheap it's cheaper than what she'd be pay in norwich so she's manage to save quite a lot of money and she's quite savvy with money unlike moi
S0135	you be so savvy
S0084	er i would like to say i be i think car boot would be good i've also get my old violins to sell i weren't take them to car boot though
S0135	find a dealer or a shop of something
S0084	i need to get them like i need to get a quote for them
S0135	mm
S0084	but they would have be seven hundred pound new so but that be you know a good ten years ago so er they would have depreciate
S0135	what about do the lottery
S0084	lottery yeah i think it's probably a waste of money but yeah maybe someone's gotta win it
S0135	or maybe take up gamble
S0084	gamble could be the answer
S0135	gotta be in it to win it
S0084	i mean while while we're there why not prostitution high class escort
S0135	how much do you wanna go abroad
S0084	a lot
S0135	i don't think there's any wrong with it
S0084	oh well as long as i only have to hold hand
S0135	i'm not talk about street walk
S0084	no high class high class escort
S0135	establishments yeah cos you can provide conversation
S0084	well that's that's the idea i mean if i have a good body then i'd do pole dance and erm
S0135	you have get a good body
S0084	i've get wobbly bits
S0135	where
S0084	everywhere in all the wrong place not on my bangers erm mm yeah there's get there's get to be a way of make more money
S0135	well it's
S0084	because second job be not the answer unless they be escort
S0135	yeah too exhaust or
S0084	too exhaust and like pay fifty per cent tax be just not viable
S0135	no um so i mean it sound like if you could say like kind of you say earlier on next year you wanna be somewhere else no matter where not no matter where it be but overseas somewhere so you can get the new experience and the new challenge and prove that you can
S0084	yeah
S0135	do all those bits and piece on yourself set the goal you know blah blah but a year's still quite a long time but be that
S0084	i be just think because between now and september i can save money from my salary which would be like a hundred and fifty pound a month maybe maybe two hundred
S0135	be that all you can save
S0084	well i just think maybe i could save more if i be really savvy maybe three hundred cos if i could get say i get fourteen hundred pound every month i suppose i could work this out
S0135	that's quite a lot maybe get a pen and paper
S0084	oh let's make a plan i just need to not spend money and that that's the problem when you get bore be you just wanna go out and everyone's get marry
S0135	that be so expensive
S0084	it's just everything and er if i wanna go and see tasha and petrol's so expensive
S0135	petrol's so expensive yep
S0084	want to go to for her birthday luckily she's talk about do that in june so maybe that won't be too bad e pub for ebooks snooze oh you're good at maths so that's fine
S0135	yep well use to be
S0084	shall say uh you be good at maths
S0135	that's your income see that be more than i get
S0084	per calendar month yeah
S0135	yep after tax
S0084	after tax
S0135	yep
S0084	so come out of that be three five five for rent
S0135	and that include all bill
S0084	that include all bill
S0135	yeah
S0084	a hundred and fifty which be my career development loan
S0135	yep
S0084	twenty six which be my phone bill
S0135	yeah
S0084	say sixty quid for a tank of petrol
S0135	yeah
S0084	but i could er obviously that's a a place to shave money
S0135	yeah possibly yeah
S0084	erm say what a hundred pound for food would it be more than that that's like twenty quid a week that's not that much twenty five quid a week
S0135	do you ever buy lunch and stuff like that and
S0084	no i try and make soup every week but if you say two hundred pound for food cos what's that a hundred and fifty pound for food say forty quid a week four fours be a hundred and sixty
S0135	yeah that include lunch meals out all that
S0084	that include lunch yeah yeah so if i be to live on a budget of forty quid a week
S0135	okay yeah
S0084	and then spend money fifty quid a week
S0135	do you have a gym membership or anything like that
S0084	let it go
S0135	fifty quid a week it's quite high that but that will include clothe
S0084	and dvds and all kinds of
S0135	cinema and all that sort of stuff
S0084	yeah what i need to do be then take the money out at the end of the month and if it's not there not spend it rescue me the thing about listen to kiss be that it be literally the same four songs on repeat
S0135	i think you be gonna say it make you wanna go out i be like yeah it do whoop whoop
S0084	it do make me wanna go out that too
S0135	and be an old hab
S0084	right my salary minus my rent minus career development loan minus phone bill minus petrol minus spend money minus food leave two hundred pound
S0135	no i don't give me that i don't believe that
S0084	here you go i'll just cancel say i didn't spend money on petrol
S0135	five six seven eight sixty nine twenty you can't you can't even use a calculator
S0135	for fuck's sake what be you like you animal you've do something really wrong
S0084	really retard
S0135	yeah you've get at least four hundred
S0135	what do you do
S0084	mm what do i do man i don't know i be a bite special as you know
S0135	yeah clearly you've do something very wrong
S0084	maths be never my strong point you know that i've always be a an artiste
S0084	have you prove me right
S0135	yes well just while i'm here
S0084	oh what's that say four hundred and eighty nine what the hell
S0135	right
S0084	i must have press it er too many time
S0135	right four eight nine basically
S0084	so we could say four hundred
S0135	to take that up to to take no to round that up to five hundred pound shave off your
S0084	petrol
S0135	petrol to be forty
S0084	forty pound
S0135	forty nine i think yeah forty nine
S0084	yeah but just in case you can just say forty yeah forty five pound but that's fine because that mean i'd ask my dad to put in fifteen pound worth of petrol a month which be fine because that's all he actually use
S0135	now what the issue be here that's food be that this bite here the two hundred pound be literally that's go out
S0084	that's pretty meagre that be
S0135	that's clothe it's cinema it's trip
S0084	yeah
S0135	travel it's er hotels it's gift
S0084	yeah
S0135	and that be only fifty pound a week i mean that be be that quite yeah that be maybe that's quite a lot
S0084	i mean it sound pretty generous when you say it like that but in reality as we know like if you go to the cinema or if you go and like get a bite of food it's because i never check because i just find it so incredibly bore to be the person to be like i can't you know i'm only gonna give you two pound like with she's not good at think oh you pay so i'll do this
S0135	you get that so i'll get this or i'll yeah
S0084	you know like if we're at the bar she's like sort of cos she's on cloud cuckoo land
S0135	okay
S0084	she'll just be faffing around
S0135	oh like
S0084	yeah it's sort of like
S0135	not cos she's not get the money just cos she's a bitch
S0084	no she's just not there so i'm like well i'll get these because otherwise you could be stand there for hours
S0135	yeah
S0084	and it's not like she's tight
S0135	you need to be
S0084	she's not a she's not like i'm not gonna pay
S0135	yeah yeah she's
S0084	i just think right i'm i'm gonna i'm just gonna sort it because otherwise we'll be here forever
S0135	right well you need to
S0084	but i need to not do that
S0135	yeah
S0084	and just let her
S0135	and that i mean i be like that with i mean i've know and live with her so it's probably different a slightly different relationship with like i can
S0084	mm
S0135	scream and say why have you gotta be so fuck tight
S0135	but erm but but in the end like i'd be like that for fuck's sake you've gotta buy all this shop because i buy you that pizza i buy you that glass of wine and the bus fare
S0084	mm
S0135	oh yeah of course no worry
S0084	yeah
S0135	cos she's generous
S0084	yeah
S0135	she's generous but she'll just never
S0084	she's just a bite scatty
S0135	yeah
S0084	which be the same as you know money isn't an an issue she's not tight she just isn't engage on the on the same planet
S0135	yeah how much money would you wanna have if for example you do wanna go travel
S0084	say it's australia i would need to have so on entry into the country you need to have five thousand dollars
S0135	which be
S0084	which be three thousand five hundred pound
S0135	yeah
S0084	but you also wanna pay for your flight
S0135	which be what
S0084	about fifteen hundred pound when i fly out my flight be one thousand pound
S0135	okay
S0084	and that be christmas and i won't be fly at christmas so it'll be cheaper
S0135	okay
S0084	and i won't be fly to mental place but if i wanna fly if i wanna stop over somewhere then basically i need to have five thousand pound save
S0135	okay yeah
S0084	so if you think so if you think in may with my may which be the eighteenth of may i'll put five hundred pound in then
S0135	yeah
S0084	because that'll be the record
S0135	okay
S0084	i suppose i could put more in because it'll be the record plus the start of my i just don't know what my overdraft will be like then cos i've have my mum's birthday and all kinds of stuff go out recently so
S0135	yeah
S0084	say say in may we that's the point where we start may june july august september october november december by december that's eight months of five hundred pound eight fives be forty
S0135	yeah in only ten months
S0084	so i need to be so in march so yeah i could book things in march next year
S0135	er let me just double check your maths no offence
S0084	february maybe
S0135	erm in march i be gonna say march april no may june july august september october november december january feb
S0084	yeah
S0135	so you can technically
S0084	i'd book in march probably
S0135	yeah
S0084	that would give me five thousand pound
S0135	yeah
S0084	and i'd want to have at least that really so this be the point
S0135	it's a lot sooner than we think actually
S0084	yeah and plus if i do move home in september i mean this be base on me not have to move home which the be the be what what we're aim for i don't want to move home
S0135	do you not
S0084	no
S0135	how much would you save by move home though not that much
S0084	not that much because i'd have to give my mum
S0135	how much do she want a hundred and eighty
S0084	a hundred and fifty so i'd get
S0135	hundred
S0084	i'd save two hundred pound more every month for
S0135	um but actually if that if that be just for september october november jan feb and you know you be off in march for example
S0084	it would literally be six months and two sixes be twelve so that'd be an extra grand
S0135	yeah
S0084	it's worth do isn't it
S0135	so then technically you could almost leave earlier then you could almost leave in january
S0084	but then my plan be always to leave in march next year
S0135	oh oh be it
S0084	cos i decide in march right that's it i've gotta get out this time next year i've gotta be off
S0135	okay
S0084	so march be fine any later than march i would feel like i'm not stick to the plan
S0135	okay do
S0084	okay well that's er that's actually make me feel quite calm
S0135	the really hard thing though be
S0084	not spend any money
S0135	yeah but you're better than me cos i'm like that it's really it's completely different though because i have get a lot of money in the bank
S0084	yeah you have
S0135	that be why i'm just like that bah bah bah bah bah bah even if i know that i have to save up for something i don't know if i could be like that i'm go to make a sandwich and take in into work in cling film i'm not go to go to pret
S0084	but you've do really well like in berlin you could've just sack it off you could have book flight to thailand you could've do cos you've find it quite hard go you know be quite
S0135	yeah
S0084	you could have come home every weekend you be quite savvy with money to be able to save the money you've get because you think well you have the sense to do it
S0135	yeah but do you know what though i be say to the other day some days i i could go three days without spend a single cent because i say say like someone have like get food in the house and i would walk to work and i wouldn't go out i could literally go there days without spend money here day in day out i've get my train fare
S0084	mm
S0135	i give money to my mum
S0084	mm
S0135	and i'm in pret for at least breakfast at least lunch possibly breakfast as well
S0135	erm i might use my oyster to go on the tube might meet for a drink go out to the cinema with maybe something blah blah
S0084	mm
S0135	clothe
S0084	yeah
S0135	do you like my jeans
S0084	i love them they're really nice
S0135	i've get them in like a really nice coral colour as well from dorothy perkins
S0084	ah lush
S0135	cos once i find they fit i trawl all the dorothy perkins cos on line they only have a six i be like who's a size six
S0084	oh
S0135	yeah
S0084	maybe
S0135	yeah so i go round all the dorothy perkins shop so i find these ones in like beige or whatever like
S0084	no they're really nice
S0135	cos they're a really nice fit aren't they they're really nice
S0084	no but you also have be trawl the charity shop so it's not like you've be
S0135	yes
S0084	you know totally splash the cash
S0135	yeah no no that really nice kate moss dress be from the charity shop and hopefully i'll make a profit on it finger cross
S0084	exactly plus you know at this point you don't know what you're do in term of your abide like it's suit you right now to be in a room
S0135	yeah
S0084	erm
S0135	but at least i'm in a i'm in a sort of similarish position as you like i don't really know what's go on like i don't even know erm what job i'm gonna do after my olympics job
S0084	mm
S0135	but it's different because my when i be in berlin my next step be right come home
S0084	mm
S0135	and i'm home now and i'm just like yeah it's all just sort of tick along and what shall be shall be
S0084	but then so be this job just temporary then
S0135	yeah
S0084	you can't stay in the counter terrorism unit once the olympics be over
S0135	no it's an olympics desk officer
S0084	right i see but maybe would that lead on to a permanent position do you think
S0135	no at that grade unless i pass my fab in may
S0084	oh no be you actually gonna do that
S0135	ah i gotta do it i gotta do it
S0084	oh man
S0135	it's a two and a half hour exam
S0084	that's not the scary one where you be tell me where they have like the people come in and the actors and they're play like
S0135	oh no that's for the next level
S0084	oh fine
S0135	this one be just a write exam
S0084	oh right good cos that one sound intense i remember you say you weren't go to go to that
S0135	yeah right that's a no
S0084	that's a no from me
S0135	yeah so erm that's my plan but
S0084	mm
S0135	you should talk to
S0084	she be the best person to speak to about not spend any money
S0135	she's the ultimate ultimate yeah but she's not tight with it it's really funny but then she will she's also get a lot more strict with herself so so a lot of her friends wanna go for er er meals and dinners like two of them be one step away from be a partner in their law firm so they've get
S0084	fuck
S0135	a lot of money
S0084	yeah
S0135	whereas she'll be like that let's go for coffee she will sip that coffee till it be stone cold
S0084	mm
S0135	erm and she'll be like that no i can't come and do that because i haven't get any money
S0084	oh right
S0135	i've see her bank statements she's literally get no money cos i open it by accident i think it be send to me erm but she's like i really wanna go travel i've gotta get out i've gotta get away i'm gonna hammer it over the summer do
S0084	wow
S0135	whatever i do not know get the money bank it and then go
S0084	and she be determine though isn't she
S0135	she'll do it she'll go
S0084	what about
S0084	do you think it's on the card
S0084	off off the card on the rock
S0135	no i i don't know they're very much in love but his well his music be his first love like it really be so
S0084	yeah she'll always be second
S0135	yeah she will be so i don't know
S0084	i suppose then he's a bite funny isn't he like when he be like yeah i'm move to london
S0135	yeah
S0084	and you enjoy whatever it be that you're do to see her
S0135	yeah i know
S0084	ha
S0135	and then that be when she come to berlin and then
S0084	yeah
S0135	i be like alright and like actually no i'm gonna move into but at that point when she come to berlin it be like that no i'm not move into cos he need his own space and whatever blah blah
S0084	mm
S0135	and then erm
S0084	she move into
S0135	she move to yeah
S0084	yeah
S0135	but 's pretty cool i've gotta say
S0084	it's good isn't it i mean like live in the prison i find it quite intrigue that she's in the prison
S0135	have you visit her yet
S0084	yeah i've be a couple of time
S0135	yeah
S0084	and the doors do slam like she live in a prison it's pretty funny like she live in the house around the prison itself
S0135	yeah
S0084	on a hill and erm they're old warden's quarter so the doors
S0135	oh god
S0084	be make of lead and they do slam like light out
S0135	oh god
S0084	it's really funny but the flats be lovely like whoever own her flat they've do it up really well
S0135	really nice yeah
S0084	i mean she be live in a in a room i i really would say it's probably not bigger than the toblerone room when she first move in and it be probably like four hundred pound a month all in it be so cheap
S0135	yeah
S0084	and then one girl move out and she get bump up the list of good room and then they get somebody else in
S0135	okay and they'd start off in a shit room and then
S0084	yeah and then work your way up depend on how long you've be there like a peck order
S0135	do you know what's so funny though liz take for example who get marry at twenty two twenty three be it twenty four
S0084	i'll have a look mm i dunno it doesn't feel like that long ago but it probably be i think i be live in haywards heath so
S0135	yeah
S0084	it must have be
S0135	i mean her husband steve have now just quit his teacher train
S0084	cheat on her every leave right and centre
S0135	yeah but it it and he's quit his teacher train now so that's out the window he doesn't know what he's gonna do next but he inherit eighty grand from his grandparents evidently so he doesn't have to know what he's gonna do next
S0084	fuck that's be the point when you do quit your job i suppose but that'd be pretty foolhardy if you don't know what you're gonna do though
S0135	i mean it's not it's not a huge amount but oh
S0084	it's enough to buy a house
S0135	it yeah it depend well only if you've get an income you need
S0084	only if you've get an income yeah
S0135	yeah cos you need a mortgage
S0084	no one's gonna lend to you without
S0135	yeah
S0084	a fix income
S0135	yeah and income yeah or your partner who's get a fix income or something but i tell you say for example this happen you book all your flight i bet you bottom dollar six weeks before you go you will meet the man of your dream and you probably won't end up go or something
S0084	no i would definitely go
S0135	cos that be absolutely sod's law isn't it
S0084	well absolutely well they can come with me if er if it's the man of my dream he can come in my handbag
S0135	yeah
S0084	but erm i meet i might meet the man of my dream out there you never know i think what i need to do now that i've get this plan be now work out where i be go cos if if aus be the plan that's fine cos that's perfect cos that's when come back so my plan my my theory
S0135	mm
S0084	be my think that i couldn't actually go with cos one of us might die like i genuinely think i might
S0135	oh how
S0084	kill her
S0135	oh right
S0084	she's lovely she's a really nice girl but we would get on each other's nerve
S0135	okay
S0084	you know we we we'd really fall out
S0135	what cos she's a bite of a space cadet or
S0084	yeah we're just we be really really different and
S0135	right
S0084	over a long period of time we would really grate on each other i think even after like the first day like be on a plane with each other for twelve hours i think would be a bite tax whereas with some people you know you can just rub along with quite nicely
S0135	mm
S0084	erm but that might tie in cos her flight's book her return flight's book for february but she's gonna extend it if she need to
S0135	mm mm
S0084	cos she can extend it up to three time so maybe she'll still be out there if i book it if like if i book it in march to fly out in you know whenever
S0135	yeah
S0084	a couple of months after that erm then yeah or i could book it at the begin of the year couldn't i i suppose cos i'd have money and i i i'd leave in april
S0135	so you you'd need you need a a thousand five hundred to book the flight do you say
S0084	well i i'm only go on what recently pay for june flight
S0135	yeah
S0084	but when i fly at christmas
S0135	yeah
S0084	on box day they be one thousand pound return
S0135	okay
S0084	so i'm figure it would be less than that
S0135	cos what i'd be incline to do would be whenever you hit enough money for the flight
S0084	book the flight
S0135	be to book the flight
S0084	yeah that's true
S0135	because then that way
S0084	i've gotta go
S0135	you're go
S0084	yeah
S0135	because i know oh at one point you be talk about go this january
S0084	yeah but then i get the new job
S0135	yeah
S0084	which be why i didn't go
S0135	yeah
S0084	i be gonna go at the end of the year that be my original plan but in september when the job come up i be like well i'm gonna i'm gonna stay and take that
S0135	yeah
S0084	because actually it make more sense go with that skill set
S0135	yeah
S0084	behind me because then it it would open up more doors than the job that i be do before for chloe and i want to kill myself
S0135	yeah
S0084	erm and er really my plan be when we get back from croatia to stay at and to stay at my mum's and work my arse off
S0135	hammer it
S0084	and not spend any money but obviously i have to move out and all those cost that i incur
S0135	oh yeah
S0084	like i have to pay my deposit and
S0135	mm
S0084	we'd be on holiday so there be
S0135	mm
S0084	you know you're already
S0135	mm
S0084	you know have spend money there and it just wasn't very feasible
S0135	mm
S0084	but i think yeah you're right i'll probably book the flight for like yeah maybe start of the year
S0135	when at what at what point of of the year be they cheap cos you know like if you book them really far in advance you get an early bird deal or
S0084	mm well the winter would be cheap so
S0135	okay
S0084	this sort of time really
S0135	
S0084	yeah yeah
S0135	book for a winter flight do you mean
S0084	yeah
S0135	be that the cheapest way
S0084	i suppose from this point on
S0135	yeah
S0084	between april and september be the cheapest flight cos that's when it's winter sort of september round to march be peak season
S0135	okay
S0084	and obviously that hit a head at christmas cos it's the hottest part and it's christmas so
S0135	yeah yeah
S0084	if my flight on box day be a thousand pound
S0135	mm
S0084	but that be with erm budget china bucket airlines
S0084	which only have one tv set in each headrest
S0135	nice nice
S0084	but the thing be if you're if you're not that fuss when you go surely you can find a flight
S0135	a flexible one
S0084	and you know like if you if you there're like eight changeovers you can get really cheap flight or
S0135	yeah
S0084	you can go on standby
S0135	yeah
S0084	and live at the airport for a week
S0135	what about work for an airline quickly
S0084	very very quickly
S0135	qantas
S0084	ah
S0135	very quickly
S0084	very
S0084	there might be some sort of law about not get like perk for the first three months
S0135	oh i see yeah hmm
S0084	you might have to pass your probation and then you're fuck
S0135	yeah and i think also like i'm sure you've get all the guide book and that that kind of gumph and that already
S0084	mm
S0135	but like figure out what be it you fancy do when you get there or do you just literally wanna just touch down and take it from there do you wanna go across to asia and the start of you know put some meat on the bone of the plan
S0084	yeah
S0135	sort of make it a reality
S0084	i think when i start think about it i think well i'd fly into melbourne because that's where live and because that's the place that i like the most
S0135	ah so you can go
S0084	if it's it's quite i could stay with
S0135	ah
S0084	very temporarily
S0135	yeah
S0084	and just say to her look can i just sleep on your floor for a couple of weeks i'll take a sleep bag and i will actively look for job straight away
S0135	mm
S0084	i mean like have a nice time settle in and you know be with her but your money get use up so quickly when you're there that i'd wanna work straight away get a job straight away like in the first couple of weeks
S0135	yeah yeah
S0084	erm but it would take time so i'd like do a bite of sight see in that time and maybe fly over to sydney and see tasha and get a job start straight away and then i could move out
S0135	yeah
S0084	or it depend on her situation cos she's have a spare room for a while and it depend what she's do cos we could move out together and then at least you know you've get somebody and then use that as my base and then save money
S0135	mm
S0084	and then work there for maybe six months and then go travel i think because i'd wanna get my money come in straight away and then i can use that as a base and have long weekend and
S0135	yeah
S0084	and then keep money and then come home through asia and then maybe do a few tour in place that i didn't feel that safe
S0135	yeah
S0084	i'd like to go over to new zealand as well you know go and see some place that i like that i either that i miss on the first time or
S0135	yeah
S0084	like one of my colleagues she she be erm from new zealand she's a kiwi and we work together for about nine months and she's just move back there down the
S0135	nice
S0084	the south island in dunedin and er she's always like yeah come up come up cos last year obviously my plan be to be in australia for christmas you've gotta come and spend christmas with us and
S0135	ah how sweet
S0084	and she's really cute she's get two little kid and her husband matt who's a professor who teach at the university
S0135	ah
S0084	so they're both really clever she's get a phd and she be work as like like an office basically while to support him do his phd it's like love
S0135	that be love man
S0084	it take her ten years to do her phd because she decide to have kid in between
S0135	fool
S0084	hilarious
S0135	i pity the fool
S0084	she's really smart um so yeah there's definitely that would be the main plan i think because i'd want to work as quickly as possible
S0135	yeah
S0084	so that i don't use up all my fund
S0135	be there any way of do your company have a branch in australia
S0084	yeah it do but i think you have to you have to wait for them to have a job to apply
S0135	mm
S0084	and i've just i've never ever see a job advertise for the melbourne office but i'm gonna speak to my group director you know i use to do for
S0135	yeah yeah yeah
S0084	and erm see if a job ever come up cos it's a different business stream it's education as oppose to english language teach it's slightly different erm but my job would be the same erm i might talk to because she work in education she do my job at the senior level
S0135	yeah and you don't know also like even if they don't have a job maybe they know someone that look for temporary people to do mark of er some sort of thing like you do at ielts mark or something like that
S0084	yeah yeah
S0135	i mean you just don't really know
S0084	well i think i would definitely get in contact with people in the office there and just say well i'm plan to move over and i just wonder if you've get job or how you go about recruit people through the office and
S0135	yeah
S0084	just sort of branch out really cos you never really get you never really meet them you never really work with them
S0135	mm
S0084	even though we've speak we're work globally now we never really do so they're just so far away
S0135	yeah
S0084	so yeah oh so it's certainly um the the basis of a plan
S0135	yeah yeah 'tis a plan
S0084	'tis a plan thank mary
S0135	yes i'm glad i come cos otherwise you probably would have figure out you could save eight thousand pound an hour
S0135	or it would take you twenty years to save up five grand or something
S0084	yeah you you've erm you've certainly help me with the maths there
S0135	whoa
S0084	god what the hell's the matter with me
S0135	ha
S0084	i think from this point on i need to just start be more savvy with money
S0135	have you pay for all of your trip so far like the hotels and flight and everything
S0084	yeah basically i haven't obviously it's things like petrol that i have to just
S0135	keep an eye on
S0084	budget for before
S0135	yeah
S0084	so brighton i'm gonna drive down just just for the sake of convenience but i think i need to think be it actually worth drive when i could get national express and stuff like for the wed
S0135	yeah
S0084	it's first thing on saturday morning so i'm gonna drive down and
S0135	mm
S0084	it's much easier to do that and i don't have to worry and i can take whatever i need for the wed and that
S0135	where be you stay on the saturday night then
S0084	in the hotel
S0135	okay
S0084	in kemptown in the b and b
S0135	oh right you be
S0084	and then i'll just pop in and see her on sunday or something but erm
S0135	yeah
S0084	for for i'll probably be cos it's not far from here i'll probably just get the train
S0135	yep
S0084	i wonder if you could get quite a cheap train ticket versus spend like twenty five quid on petrol
S0135	mm
S0084	or thirty quid on petrol it doesn't really make much sense
S0135	god you're gonna have to be really dedicate
S0084	yeah
S0135	like you're gonna you need to prove how much you want it because
S0084	it's gonna be a real test
S0135	if it all boil down if it all boil down to money basically
S0084	which it do
S0135	then you have to make those sacrifice
S0084	mm
S0135	those short term sacrifice
S0084	well that's why i've say no to all the hen party well i think i might just do that from now on anyway
S0135	oh no but that be just so hard
S0084	it's really hard because i be so look forward to barcelona and i hadn't see for age and i know i just know they're gonna have a lovely lovely time
S0135	yeah
S0084	and barcelona's beautiful
S0135	yeah and you really like barcelona
S0084	and i mean it might even get to the point where i cancel belfast but we'll see cos that's july and i haven't get anything plan like may be gonna be expensive
S0135	yeah
S0084	april and may if i'm not careful erm and then want to go to or for her birthday in june like the jubilee weekend so that's the begin of june
S0135	i mean technically these things could all be do on the they don't necessarily have to be
S0084	yeah
S0135	costly
S0084	but like if it be in 's birthday like if we drive there'll be four of us in the car so we'll just all chip in for petrol
S0135	yeah
S0084	so that's go to be cheaper than get the train to then we'll stay at her dad's free and then so it'll just be drink money
S0135	yeah
S0084	and it's so presumably it's north therefore it's cheap
S0135	yeah should be about fifty p a pint
S0084	er at least if not i'm gonna be very annoy
S0135	otherwise you're on tap water
S0084	yes and plus i think i really can sort of drum up some crap in here and sell ebay all my life because
S0135	yeah do you ever sell anything on ebay
S0084	i try once and get really bore with it
S0135	i'm addict now
S0084	be you
S0135	yeah i think you just have to do your research though before you list anything
S0084	mm
S0135	have a look online see if there's anything else similar and then see if it shift
S0084	mm
S0135	cos sometimes people you know try and sell something there's no market if it doesn't go anywhere
S0084	mm
S0135	so like keep an eye on stuff that's actually sell and see see if you've get any like label clothe for example
S0084	mm
S0135	you know mm
S0084	yeah well not with my primani wardrobe but certainly i mean and i've get things like a digital camera that i don't use now because i've get my smart phone that
S0135	but you will wanna take that with you if you go travel though wouldn't you or you'd want a digital camera
S0084	well it's an eight mega pixel camera which be what my phone be
S0135	oh really
S0084	but i suppose i wouldn't be able to use my phone so that's actually quite a good point
S0135	i mean it i mean those sort of things though you could probably make all that money at the last stage of the plan
S0084	mm
S0135	like when you need to hike it up like you don't need to sell everything now
S0084	yeah true
S0135	i mean i suppose when you do move away you would try and sell the bed
S0084	sell the bed yeah
S0135	if even if you end up have to free cycle it it's i don't know if you could sell the tv or give it to your mum or whatever
S0084	yeah
S0135	or put it into storage you know sell whatever bits you know but that be all that's all stuff you'd do at the very end maybe
S0084	mm mm
S0135	erm
S0084	just see how you go
S0135	yeah see how you go
S0084	yeah cos basically all this stuff i mean you might find that you never come back
S0135	mm
S0084	or you might just be a constant hermit
S0135	a hobo
S0135	a nomad
S0084	a hobo actually ' friend be call for just this very reason it's just
S0135	wait oh as what a nickname or a real name
S0084	as a nickname yeah
S0135	okay
S0084	yeah but erm i dunno i can't remember what her real name be but she's emigrate to canada i think this weekend she's go to erm she's go to where be she go for some sort of leave emigrate party or something well that be her excuse
S0135	be she emigrate with work
S0084	erm no she doesn't work i don't know how she's emigrate i really don't
S0135	family
S0084	i think she's get a girlfriend out there or something i don't
S0135	okay
S0084	no i don't really know but but i think she try to emigrate there once before but then get bore so come back and now maybe have a change of heart i think this be i think this be at least the second emigrate party they've have for her
S0135	attempt okay
S0084	like seriously will you just leave now
S0135	bye bye yeah
S0084	stop come back
S0135	what do your mum make to everything
S0084	i think she know that restless
S0135	yeah
S0084	she know that i've get itchy feet and i think she worry that i think she probably it's a double edge sword she want me to go but she doesn't want me to go so i don't know
S0135	really
S0084	i think she want me to go because otherwise i'll always wonder why
S0135	yeah
S0084	and like feel like i've miss out but at the same time she doesn't want me to go because she know if i do go i'll be really far away and it'd be for quite a long time so
S0135	yeah
S0084	i think she feel a bite sad about that
S0135	yeah
S0084	and she like the fact that now that 's move have move back that we're all in the same city and it's all really easy and i could just like last week i just pop round for lunch
S0135	yeah
S0084	and we have to go and sit in the garden because it be so warm
S0135	oh and your mum have get a gorgeous garden as well
S0084	and mum's get a really nice garden and so she really like that that we can just see each other for a cup of tea or you know it's really easy
S0135	yeah without make sort of plan six months in advance to meet up or something
S0084	yeah exactly
S0135	yeah cos how long have you be in now
S0084	too long
S0135	i've
S0084	well if i finish my degree in september o nine
S0135	okay so
S0084	two and a half years cos i've be at the press just over two years now
S0135	where do you do your degree
S0135	oh yeah i forget about yeah
S0084	yeah
S0135	two and a half years i think my limit anywhere be two years like
S0084	yeah
S0135	limit for like do something or be somewhere or something like that
S0084	that's the point when you're like well what's next then
S0135	what's next yeah yeah exactly
S0084	yeah definitely
S0135	yeah
S0084	cos it might take you you know that's the problem where you think right i've get to change and it might take you another year or half a year to get yourself together
S0135	yeah
S0084	but it's that point where you think right well i've gotta do something about this
S0135	yeah but your mum could come and visit you
S0084	erm i'd never be able to afford a flight for her and she'd never be able to afford it
S0135	ah
S0084	i'd love her to i'd love them both to come out
S0135	ah
S0084	because you know they've never really travel themselves and like that's quite upset that think but they don't notice
S0135	but not everyone want to like i meet a guy not meet a guy obviously i don't meet guy any more
S0135	but i be talk to a guy someone's flatmate on saturday night and um he didn't use his passport until five years ago and he go to like tunisia or something for a holiday
S0084	mm
S0135	and he's be to egypt and something else since but he can take it or leave it he doesn't want to go to asia he's not interest in see machu picchu or whatever
S0084	mm mm
S0135	in peru or you know he's genuinely perfectly happy thank you very much in england
S0084	okay how old be he
S0135	our age
S0084	okay
S0135	yeah so i mean it's not for everyone
S0084	it's interest to know absolutely not everyone want to go backpack with lamas but erm
S0135	yeah
S0084	yeah i think both of them would love to see more of the world
S0135	do you think
S0084	but yeah and i know my dad would
S0135	would
S0084	yeah definitely i mean she's scar of fly so that's a bite of an issue but with my dad definitely he'd love there's certain part of america i know he'd love and he'd love canada and new zealand cos he's so like
S0135	yeah yeah
S0084	he'd love it he'd go absolutely wild erm
S0135	be he can he not afford it then or
S0084	no no he'd never be able to afford it
S0135	that he erm i would find that really frustrate if i work my whole life
S0084	yeah it's so depress to watch it
S0135	and i couldn't afford to do what i want to do ie go and
S0084	mm
S0135	go to new zealand australia whatever blah blah
S0084	and it it's what make you think well well in that case i've just get to do it cos i don't want to get into that position so
S0135	yeah definitely you don't you don't want life to well get in the way or whatever they say you know and erm get sweep up in all that
S0084	but that's not yeah i think you know they they have they do the norm you know
S0135	mm
S0084	they meet they get marry they buy a house they have kid you know they have the two point four family life and
S0135	mm
S0084	i think you know it still kill me that it's just not what how my dad think it be gonna be
S0135	yeah
S0084	but that's life you know you you pick yourself up and you carry on that's what he's do and
S0135	mm
S0084	it's the best of a bad situation like they're civil to each other and i think really that's all you can sort of hope for now but i think every so often he say something and i think i dunno how or where he be that that's not a possibility like he's like oh on you know finger cross we win the pool and then we can all have a lovely holiday and the five of us can have some money and er i think he's never really detach himself from that idea like it it's always go to be five of us you know be slightly different do i tell you 's pregnant 's gonna have a baby i'm gonna be an aunty i just realise i probably haven't tell you
S0135	your brother
S0084	yeah
S0135	he's pregnant
S0084	well he's not pregnant 's pregnant
S0135	i be like a pregnant man like that pregnant man thing
S0084	no no no no no no
S0135	fuck hell hasn't already get two kid
S0084	well no he hasn't get any kid 's get two girls from a previous relationship
S0135	's pregnant dweeb yeah fine
S0135	his wife be pregnant
S0084	his wife be pregnant and then
S0135	you're not allow to be an aunty cos you don't talk to your brother
S0084	i don't talk to him no erm my dad call me a few weeks ago and he be like i've just speak to it be like thursday afternoon
S0135	yeah
S0084	i've speak to you'll never guess they're pregnant it's so excite and he be so please and so chuff he sound so excite yeah
S0135	cos the oldest one must be what eight ten years old
S0084	ah no she's sixteen yeah
S0135	why do they decide to have a kid now then
S0084	i don't think they do i don't think it's the most plan of pregnancies
S0135	okay
S0084	well er 's forty one will be forty two in september
S0135	she's forty one i mean in the grand scheme of things that's probably quite old for kid
S0084	well she'll be forty one when the baby's bear yeah so they'll be sixties when the baby's eighteen so it's pretty old if they have have their three month scan everything's fine and cry and blah blah blah but i just think this be the point where we be not gonna be able to part ways because i'm gonna have to see that kid i'm gonna have to be involve er because my dad be so excite about it
S0135	when's it be bear
S0084	september which i mean 's birthday his birthday be the first of september and it's due about the same sort of time
S0135	but you're gonna have to reconcile with with erm
S0084	well i send him a text message the next day i think just say oh erm congratulations dad tell me your really excite news i'm really happy for you both i hope you're both okay and i'm sorry we haven't speak for age blah
S0135	that's good of you yeah
S0084	well i just think er you know now be the time and i think about do it at christmas
S0135	yeah
S0084	but i didn't and erm he didn't
S0135	he didn't oh he didn't yeah yeah
S0084	he didn't get in contact and then he reply almost straight away and say oh er you know we're really excite thank for your you know your kind word and yeah i'm sorry too um i'll definitely get in touch with dad and we should organise a a meet soon which be like a month ago so that hasn't happen
S0135	mm
S0084	er never mind the fact that he's only like an hour down the road and er he say he go for the scan and he be really emotional and it be you know they're really excite about it
S0135	it's his first baby
S0084	yeah his first baby
S0135	yeah okay yeah
S0084	so my dad's proper first grandchild so the girls be quite shock when they find out
S0084	but they're come around to the idea now cos they're sixteen and fourteen so they be a bite like mum what be you do you're like an old woman now you can't have a baby
S0135	ah ah yeah do do she actually want one though because she be quite career orientate isn't she
S0084	she be yeah yeah yeah she be erm i don't know if it's morally they would have never consider a an abortion or whether they just want to have a baby
S0135	right
S0084	i don't know but um i mean financially they can afford it i think it's just like health reason um
S0135	yeah cos that's the other thing that it's risky
S0084	it's really risky erm i think it's more risky if you haven't have a child
S0135	right if it's your first one
S0084	which she have
S0135	yeah
S0084	so it lower the risk but obviously you know you're in your forties so it do run a risk
S0135	mm
S0084	um but everything be healthy anna's healthy the baby's healthy so unfortunately as much as i would like not to ever have to see them again erm that isn't an option
S0135	what be it i know i always ask you this but what be the last thing and why do it end so on bad term
S0084	erm he it be the christmas before last and it have be er just over a year and i be message him to find out what his plan be and to see if he want to see dad and when and what
S0135	yeah okay yeah yeah
S0084	and i think the year before dad have see him on christmas day because they hadn't have the girls and we'd see mum because of course dad can go to 's mum doesn't have anybody to spend christmas with if we're not with her
S0135	yeah
S0084	so that's what they do the that year that i'd email him i be think would they have the girls or not and so i email them and say be you have the girls be you gonna invite dad over it might make more sense for you to invite dad for christmas day if you want to
S0135	yeah
S0084	um but just let me know and i'll try and organise stuff as well
S0135	yeah
S0084	and he write back just say well if you know we've not get the girls and of course we will invite dad because we love dad subtext you don't love dad um i'm just wonder why you always seem to put your own mother first and i'm just really confuse because we don't you know it seem very strange that dad's feel always come second blah de blah blah
S0135	he needn't have write that
S0084	so it be really cut it it er come back straight like that in an email he must have just fire it off and i don't i just think even if you now feel really guilty he never follow it up with anything he never he never write back and be like sorry that be off the cuff i didn't mean it
S0135	yeah i didn't even think it through or anything
S0084	i didn't reply and
S0135	yeah
S0084	i think be i be really selfish i speak to mum about it and i be obviously i be really upset and i just and fuck off because i think
S0135	it's not true
S0084	i'm the eldest it always fall to me to organise it
S0135	yeah
S0084	and it's not fuck true
S0135	yeah it's not true that's the most annoy thing it's unjustified
S0084	yeah and where have it come from it's come let out of leave centre
S0135	leave field yeah
S0084	leave field because all i ever do be try and make sure that his feel be take into consideration so you can fuck off and in fact how often do you see dad
S0135	mm
S0084	so even like last christmas my dad didn't see him for like two or three weeks after christmas he have the present for the girls er it wasn't till the end of january that actually get his fuck act together and come to see my dad he buy him a massive state of the art tv talk about guilt
S0135	guilty yeah
S0084	erm
S0135	but nice nice
S0084	my dad be like my dad call me and be like i've get a new tv
S0084	he be so excite erm

S0135	yeah in chelmsford still be he
S0084	there's absolutely no excuse yeah chelmsford
S0135	yeah
S0084	and he have the the ball to say to me that i don't love my dad so he can just fuck off
S0135	that's so weird
S0084	and this just come after a long list of you know the wed saga
S0135	mm
S0084	and and meet him in everyone cry but then you know when we go to that meal where everyone cry
S0135	yeah
S0084	and er me think like that be us turn a corner
S0135	yeah turn the corner yeah
S0084	but never then never hear from him and 's obviously be twenty one last year
S0135	yeah
S0084	and he didn't call her didn't text her didn't send a card for richard's twenty first whenever that be he give him two hundred and fifty pound worth of hmv vouchers or like a hundred pound or like a really decent amount
S0135	something substantial yeah
S0084	um
S0135	why do you think that
S0084	and come for a party and stuff but we have a do um we have a do and he just um

S0135	okay
S0084	erm so she's in charge of that she's just finish her phd she's like a linguist as well
S0135	okay
S0084	erm really really clever but really sort of down to earth with it which be nice and her boyfriend matt be just finish off his phd and he be scarily clever like he's really nice and doesn't make you feel stupid or anything
S0135	yeah oh that's good
S0084	but he's he's just up there he's on another level
S0135	okay
S0084	with his cleverness erm but they've invite me round for a bottle of wine so i might go round there and then they say oh we might go into town but i might say like let's just like keep it in the house
S0135	yeah
S0084	a bottle of wine or something
S0135	yeah
S0084	it's always a bite safer
S0135	yeah
S0084	or maybe we should just go for a pint
S0135	otherwise you'll get absolutely waste
S0084	absolutely waste but then that's that's the danger because then you're like yeah yeah have my card
S0135	oh god keep it behind the bar
S0084	yeah fifty quid on the card well no cos then they're like yeah that'll be a hundred pound
S0135	yeah oh shit it's not my card
S0084	it's not me
S0135	just run off yeah and then what be you do on saturday
S0084	i don't know i think probably see the fam at some point
S0135	which one which bite
S0084	which bite i think pop in and see mum briefly on saturday
S0135	what's she do with herself then sort of keep herself busy a and that be she just sort of like campaign keep abreast of all the and all that sort of stuff and
S0084	current affairs yeah
S0135	yeah okay
S0084	yeah just all of the usual really
S0135	yeah
S0084	she's um
S0135	garden and
S0084	she's get a friend who's get cancer and it's really yeah it's pretty um pretty serious get some sort of rare cancer
S0135	oh god
S0084	um and she's be help her out she's an author
S0135	mm
S0084	she's be help her out with a bite of like sort her life out basically
S0135	yeah
S0084	but i think it obviously it's massively drain on my mum my mum's already like
S0135	mm
S0084	obviously she's a a depressive so it's obviously quite um she's really quite volatile about stuff like that so
S0135	it's difficult yeah
S0084	er i think she's alright
S0135	good
S0084	the thing be she doesn't ever talk to me it's the complete opposite of you with your mum when she's you know she's not sort of like you know
S0135	i have that third hand though
S0084	you have that yeah
S0135	third hand though that wasn't to me that be to someone else who tell someone else who tell me within the so that be third hand
S0084	oh
S0135	yeah maybe from to to to me or something so
S0084	good
S0135	yeah
S0084	right
S0135	yeah
S0084	yeah um
S0135	but who do i i assume think that she will talk to her friends about it though or
S0084	i hope so
S0135	someone else
S0084	yeah and and in fact i'm pretty sure she do
S0135	yeah
S0084	and i think it's just that she feel like she doesn't want to burden me with it
S0135	yeah
S0084	yeah which be fine but i
S0135	yeah
S0084	also want her to to know that she can if she want to but
S0135	yeah
S0084	also selfishly i sort of don't want her to
S0135	yeah good and also don't forget she you know mother daughter relationship she should technically go to her friends or partner or somebody else
S0084	yeah
S0135	and it should be all upward it should be you go to her with all your problems
S0084	it should be all upward escalate up don't cascade down
S0135	that's it that's it that's it well we've already have it cascade down
S0084	we have
S0135	and now it's our turn to send it upwards and let them
S0084	yeah keep the crazy up there
S0135	yeah yeah um
S0084	yeah well i don't i really i think she's fine actually she like her little house erm
S0135	yeah
S0084	she like her garden and she's when i go round last weekend she'd be out in the garden dig which for her be a really good sign like last year she wasn't she didn't really feel motivate to get out
S0135	yeah
S0084	i think she have quite a difficult time of it whereas this year she feel like
S0135	mm
S0084	right let's get on it and that's why i try to go round like at least once a week
S0135	yeah
S0084	i mean obviously i don't want to worry about her that in extent
S0135	no
S0084	but it's nice to sort of check in and
S0135	yeah but um
S0135	but isn't be this something that come about relatively recently or do you think she's always be prone to be a bite
S0084	she's always be like that oh yeah she be really bad when we be grow up really bad i think because with richard's you know imagine if you know something be wrong with your kid but no one believe you and everyone think it be you be a bad mum
S0135	mm
S0084	like even if you won't a depressive
S0135	mm
S0084	that'd be fuck hard and
S0135	it wasn't sort of diagnose and it wasn't
S0084	it wasn't diagnose until he be a teenager and and also have your husband doubt you like that be the begin of the end i think
S0135	mm
S0084	it's to not feel support from her her husband and because my dad just be he would want to
S0135	mm
S0084	i think he be just incapable of do it because he didn't really want to believe that his son have this condition
S0135	yeah
S0084	and because it's so intangible
S0135	mm
S0084	and it be quite unknown at the time and
S0135	it's subjective as well yeah
S0084	he
S0135	you really you probably still find people today who would question
S0084	mm
S0135	that it that such a condition exist and wouldn't just put it down to
S0084	mm
S0135	badly behave
S0084	yeah
S0135	or unruly or blah blah blah
S0084	that's certainly what people be tell her um
S0135	yeah
S0084	so i think for those reason you know that be obviously a massive part of why she move out of so
S0135	yeah
S0084	um and ultimately what lead to the end of their marriage but yeah
S0135	mm
S0084	i think because she have a really crappy upbringing
S0135	mm
S0084	a really really rubbish time and um it's amaze like you know tell you about that book they fuck you up like it's true like your parent play as you as we all know you know
S0135	mm
S0084	it just start from such a young age and it's so scary that you know if you have a bad experience it could ruin you for the rest of your life if if you allow it to
S0135	mm
S0084	like with her she's work really hard not to
S0135	mm
S0084	like she could have be one of those parent on jeremy kyle that's horrible to their kid and you know
S0135	mm
S0084	she's deliberately go the other way and always make an effort and say
S0135	mm
S0084	you know i love you and i care about you and i'm proud of you and all that sort of like you know all that stuff that mums be suppose to say
S0135	mm
S0084	but i mean action speak louder than word as well
S0135	mm yeah
S0084	and um you know with you know with your family you do get a lot of support from your family even if there there's not like the vocal
S0135	yeah
S0084	follow up there
S0135	yeah yeah yeah
S0084	so yeah i think you know this be sort of the way it be now
S0135	mm
S0084	um keep texting me
S0135	huh
