S0535	that's alright
S0486	and erm i know you're a model engine here and you're here on a work party today and you give your time fifteen minutes to talk to me what would you like to talk about today
S0535	i don't know
S0486	you don't know
S0486	what about your job that the the thing you do before you be erm retire and erm you're an instrument technician now can you tell me what that entail
S0535	yes anything from pressure gauge to control systems mostly pneumatic but some of it electronic
S0486	what part of the job do you like the best
S0535	all of it
S0486	really can you stipulate you like absolutely all of it
S0535	i enjoy it all
S0486	yeah
S0535	to the point where i actually leave twenty four years almost to the day that i go in and it felt as though i'd literally be there a week
S0486	oh that's a wonderful experience isn't it
S0535	yeah
S0486	what about the people you work with
S0535	no i'd sooner not talk about them
S0535	i mean that
S0486	right okay
S0535	there be some i will talk about there be some i won't
S0486	yeah well if you can tell me about some of the character you work with that would be good
S0535	what like like the bare knuckle fighter that use to be there
S0486	really
S0535	fight with people like jack dempsey who be one of the world champion he be just a character but there be lot of people there be the biggest problem be the fact that i work day shift and there be people work what they call twelve hour shift and they literally be they use to do two days two nights so you use to see a whole range of different people all the time
S0486	right
S0535	and i think that's probably what help
S0486	yeah
S0535	but some of the people i actually work with i'd sooner not talk about because i didn't like them very much
S0486	no no
S0535	and i have to put up with them
S0486	yeah mm i well i when i be nurse i have people like that and it be a bite like you

S0535	yeah
S0486	and hopefully i'll get somebody nice
S0535	yeah
S0486	erm
S0535	well that's right well this be one particular character i work with for twenty years in the same room
S0486	yeah really
S0535	and i couldn't i i it still rankle with me the amount of the amount of
S0486	really
S0535	work i have to do
S0486	right
S0535	because of his inability to do the job properly
S0486	oh that's really hard isn't it
S0535	and i'm not racist in any way
S0486	no
S0535	but he be a west indian
S0486	be he
S0535	and he think he'd learn the job very quickly and he never really do learn the job
S0486	right right

S0486	no
S0535	in particular
S0486	no well we can
S0535	but
S0486	steer on to other subject while you be do this job that you enjoy so much for so many years what what what do you do in your leisure time

S0535	because they know the job would be do and it would be do properly
S0486	yeah
S0535	and
S0486	mm
S0535	i suppose the work ethic i get come out of what i do when i first leave school
S0486	oh
S0535	which be clinical pathology
S0486	oh right
S0535	you didn't know that do
S0486	no i didn't

S0535	clinical
S0486	clinical clinical
S0535	i work
S0486	pathology
S0535	in a hospital
S0486	ah right
S0535	count blood cells
S0486	right
S0535	collect blood about three years do bacteriology
S0486	right
S0535	so

S0535	down a microscope
S0486	oh lord
S0535	count chamber dilute to blood put in your count chamber put it under a microscope and count the cells that you could see at a give area
S0486	and have that affect you eyesight in later life do you think
S0535	no i don't think it have i've be i think i've be very lucky consider how long i be spend do that
S0486	right
S0535	and when you're do bacteriology there be time when you sit and look for an hour down the microscope at blank plank erm slide
