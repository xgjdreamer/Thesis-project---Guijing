S0144	yeah so i think the interview will be good practice anyway
S0024	yeah
S0144	won't they
S0024	yeah well cos i'm brush brush up on some of my theories and stuff and and we need to discuss all our dissertation work and stuff like that
S0144	yeah
S0024	ah
S0144	yeah
S0024	ah
S0144	well we need to think of all the things involve in write plus go over theories
S0024	there's quite a lot to to think about
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	like well you just don't don't know i mean be she go to talk about blend learn or be she gonna talk about i don't know the best way to prepare materials what you like all sort of things
S0144	yeah
S0024	or or the materials that we've do before the syllabus design
S0144	yeah
S0024	that i do with british council
S0144	yeah i suppose so yeah hmm
S0024	all all of that sort of stuff
S0144	yep i know
S0024	that ooh without talk about i'm gonna completely forget
S0144	okay well that website you be look at earlier
S0024	which one
S0144	moodle
S0024	moodle
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah but i don't really understand moodle
S0144	yeah i have a look on their website and it and the videos be shit
S0024	yeah what do i find out i mean right it give you like there's some do you log in as the trial person the demo
S0144	yeah
S0024	log in as the demo and it didn't really show me any
S0144	no it wasn't very clear be it
S0024	it's just this be how you set up er question but you want like a whole lesson
S0144	yeah
S0024	demonstrate on there
S0144	yeah
S0024	it it look pretty new
S0144	yeah
S0024	i'm not sure
S0144	but apparently it's similar to blackboard
S0024	mm
S0144	where you can
S0024	yeah
S0144	i don't know put different class up
S0024	but it look
S0144	and then put in the work that you're do in the class put it on there for them to do as extra study
S0024	yeah but do you know how many extra hours that take out of your time
S0144	what for the teacher
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah quite a lot
S0024	i mean i know it's better for the student definitely
S0144	yeah god
S0024	definitely definitely
S0144	yeah well as
S0024	but
S0144	as long as they figure this into the pay scale of these job
S0024	the teacher need to have some time to do that
S0144	yeah you need some down time
S0024	and you need to know the whole system so you can just type inn a question like de de de de de de do
S0144	yeah
S0024	pf like
S0144	well like at the british council like patrick and he have that be his job do stuff like that
S0024	yeah
S0144	so it could almost be the teacher and then these i don't think it's fair expect people to do both under the same job title although that's probably where it's gonna end up isn't it
S0024	well it's alright if you have less teach hours and then
S0144	yeah
S0024	you've get time to put it up but
S0144	yeah but you know things like this always
S0024	no yeah
S0144	get squish into your
S0024	yeah
S0144	thing don't they
S0024	ha
S0144	it's the same with anything
S0024	it can definitely be good but i er yeah
S0144	yeah
S0024	it's basically put a put the lesson up but it's get all these different slot you know like
S0144	mm
S0024	write a question here and it's all about positive feedback or or give not positive immediate feedback
S0144	mm
S0024	so like then for say like you've get a multiple choice question
S0144	mm
S0024	and then you like have four you have four multiple choice answer for each one you can give a feedback thing and whether that just be correct or
S0144	mm
S0024	incorrect
S0144	yeah
S0024	or some of them
S0144	and
S0024	this be incorrect because la la la la la
S0144	yeah and and it show as well um like each person like get a little avatar thing
S0024	oh do they i didn't see that bite
S0144	er well not an avatar but a you know just a picture a profile picture thing
S0024	yeah oh they don't get an avatar
S0144	but they're and then you can have like quiz where you can see you can make it public
S0024	ah
S0144	so you can see which students get what right and what wrong
S0024	mm that's really good that's really good
S0144	but you can also keep it anonymous as well
S0024	yeah
S0144	and then you can have like chat room for the students which be good as well
S0024	yeah
S0144	forums where they can just post question for anyone
S0024	yeah
S0144	so it's yeah i think it's a brilliant thing
S0024	it well it be it be but the all everybody need to be train in it to
S0144	yeah
S0024	be able to just quickly
S0144	yeah
S0024	be able to quickly put something up at the end of each class or something
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	any question that have come up in the class might type it in
S0144	yeah well if you're teach syllabus' like the same thing come up then it's easy
S0024	mm
S0144	innit once you've get your template then you know
S0024	yeah this be for this module this be for that
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah and you can improve it every time but then you need to be teach the same thing or have a group of teachers who you're teach the same modules with
S0144	yeah
S0024	well it's just collect all the it's like we collect materials now it's just
S0144	yeah
S0024	collect it from all the teachers
S0144	yeah
S0024	i be think they're gonna have a fantastic database afterwards
S0144	who
S0024	well moodle
S0144	moodle
S0024	they'll have a fantastic database of um cos they do all sort of subject and all sort of languages
S0144	oh yeah yeah
S0024	of all of this stuff that teachers create for them
S0144	mm mm no i think it's brilliant and the way it even the name and just the the first appearance of it seem quite you know quite fresh whereas when we be at uni and we use blackboard
S0024	oh i'm
S0144	that be so
S0024	yeah
S0144	drab and
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	it be just i dunno it be horrible wasn't it but this you know i think this be gonna be quite popular
S0024	yeah
S0144	i don't know how new it be hmm
S0024	well i think it look quite new because i don't they haven't really set up the demo or stuff
S0144	no hmm
S0024	mm
S0144	ah well i've for the benefit of the recorder i've look on the i look on the daily mail ha website cos they're always quite funny for news stories they just
S0024	they be daily mail
S0144	well they just i don't know it's just funny
S0024	mm mm
S0144	er let's have a look
S0024	what do you find
S0144	er there be a there be a guy who go to a garage sale
S0024	mm
S0144	and why don't we have garage sales here
S0024	well people have um yard sales don't they oh no
S0144	no they don't no
S0024	no
S0144	why don't they do it
S0024	you can make one but not many people come
S0144	they don't really do it though do they
S0024	in the suburbs not here in in the suburbs
S0144	no they don't
S0024	mm
S0144	well maybe i don't know it's either car boot isn't it
S0024	well we have jumble sales instead
S0144	car boot and jumble
S0024	yeah
S0144	but car boot have be shit now for a good ten years
S0024	it probably er it's probably not allow or something that you can sell load of stuff
S0144	yeah probably
S0024	outside your house or have people come into your house
S0144	yeah
S0024	there's all sort of you know if someone fall over what be you gonna do
S0144	but the last ten
S0024	you're gonna get sue
S0144	the last yeah ha but all the jumble sales i've be to since i've be back have be rubbish
S0024	mm they've be rubbish
S0144	and the car boot i've be to the last few years have all be rubbish
S0024	yeah we've either be go to the wrong ones or people have
S0144	because people get people get too savvy on
S0024	mm
S0144	like collect stuff and pick up good stuff
S0024	mm
S0144	and i remember like when i use to go you still get the collectors go in but not like now
S0024	no
S0144	now they just clean up everything in ten minutes like everything
S0024	yeah
S0144	like when we go what a few months ago we get ask about ten time didn't we have you get any gold or silver
S0024	yeah
S0144	like in the first five minutes so it's and then you've get well the last few i've be to have so many polish there as well
S0024	mm
S0144	it's kind of the whole demographic of it have change i think
S0024	a little bite yeah yeah
S0144	and
S0024	yeah
S0144	and jumble sales people aren't get rid of much stuff anymore
S0024	well people keep all their gold and silver or they take them to a dealer
S0144	mm
S0024	like they're they're not just gonna stick it on their car boot stall anymore they just
S0144	no
S0024	unless unless
S0144	well not with all this stuff i mean you go down the high street we buy gold we buy you know
S0024	yeah
S0144	people have get wise to it now
S0024	yeah
S0144	and it's not like the nineties
S0024	they look at it look at the hallmark type it in the internet
S0144	mm
S0024	find out what it be and go ooh
S0144	hmm mm
S0024	i'll take it to a dealer rather than stick it on their car boot sale and sell it for a couple of quid
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	so yeah
S0144	ha
S0024	anyway what's this guy who go to the garage sale
S0144	oh yeah um yeah he go to a garage sale and buy a couple of paint and then it turn out one of them he pay three dollars one of them be an andy warhol sketch
S0024	no way

S0024	what no way
S0144	but that's
S0024	that's see er that seem to happen a fair bite though
S0144	i don't understand it though cos it have you know it be obviously andy warhol it have like the you know the the background
S0024	mm
S0144	you know the kind of photo reverse it kind of effect
S0024	mm
S0144	yeah um ha and it have andy warhol in big like write in the bottom corner and it well i look at it it didn't look very good
S0024	it's legitimate
S0144	to my untrained eye
S0024	mm
S0144	i dunno it could be just be someone piss about and then write andy warhol and it be a joke in my opinion i mean it hasn't be er definitely
S0024	it hasn't
S0144	no
S0024	ah i doubt it's real
S0144	so i reckon there's a good chance it'll be a fake but
S0024	yeah
S0024	well who um who like look at it and try to verify it
S0144	well i dunno it didn't say that it's just one of the stories
S0144	and
S0024	that'd be so cool if you could buy i dunno you find something like that

S0024	i don't think they have any whale in zoos
S0144	they do
S0024	no they don't
S0144	they do cos then they jump they jump out of the water and everyone get splash

S0144	well no it wasn't in the same tank it be in a special one
S0024	but it must have be a massive tank

S0144	well no this be where the daily mail come in isn't it cos they take these things and turn them into er like a big i don't know i don't know but it's that it's that thing isn't it like how much violence
S0024	that weird mentality like where would you get the idea to get a hammer
S0144	yeah but would you have do it anyway or be it the effect of tv that influence your
S0024	well he must have have that violent tendency first and then
S0144	well i hope so yeah
S0024	just get the idea of the hammer
S0144	yeah
S0024	otherwise like i dunno he could have pick up anything you wouldn't have think a hammer straight away would you
S0144	yeah
S0024	you'd think kitchen knife or something
S0144	yeah it's like that um
S0024	oh dear
S0144	that story a few years ago wasn't it that um what be it call the chucky film
S0024	yeah
S0144	what be they call
S0024	chucky they're call chucky
S0144	be that what they're call
S0024	no no doll um

S0024	mm oh i dunno
S0144	and those kid
S0024	child play child's er mm
S0144	child play
S0024	child's play
S0144	yeah that's it yeah
S0024	mm
S0144	and those kid say they watch horror movies all the time and that be their favourite and then they go out and they kill that little kid you remember
S0024	yeah
S0144	be that the bulger
S0024	yeah
S0144	one or be that a different one
S0024	that be age ago
S0144	it might have be a different one
S0024	i wonder what happen to those kid
S0144	i don't know
S0024	now
S0144	probably release i think they be release actually
S0024	it's really sad those things
S0144	mm but do you think tv do though do you think it
S0024	yeah well i think
S0144	i think it desensitise people
S0024	yeah
S0144	like hugely
S0024	of cause it do
S0144	desensitise them to violence and and sex and language and i don't know
S0024	even hit people over the head
S0144	yeah right yeah
S0024	or punch people once and think that
S0144	well punch them repeatedly
S0024	they're just gonna bounce back up again
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah punch them twenty time and they'll still keep bounce back up again for more
S0144	yeah in the head
S0024	yeah i mean that's all of the film you can blame that on every nearly every single film
S0144	yeah go out in the street and do that and and someone doesn't get up again
S0024	yeah
S0144	which happen like every weekend
S0024	yeah
S0144	yeah er that's pf
S0024	and they just think that they will just bounce back up again and they don't realise that they can cause injury
S0144	yeah
S0024	because on all the film and that be that be film
S0144	yeah oh totally yeah yeah
S0024	because it's it's they perceive it as truth
S0144	mm
S0024	because it's in so many film
S0144	mm
S0024	it's like cluck him over the head
S0144	yeah
S0024	he get back up and they fight some more
S0144	although although you could say do tom and jerry not do that as well or be it different
S0024	it's different
S0144	why
S0024	it's a cartoon about a cat and a mouse it's not a
S0024	no the like in in
S0144	reality so a little doll walk around
S0024	no not the doll thing i'm still talk about the clunk on the head thing in all the film
S0144	so just like the average hollywood movie
S0024	yeah the hollywood movies where they're you know the action movies where the police be get the gangsters or whatever and everybody's punch each other out
S0144	mm mm
S0024	and they all just keep get up and get punch again and again and again
S0144	mm
S0024	now that because they're real actors
S0144	mm

S0024	eviction of a house
S0144	mm how much wood do that thing burn up be it suppose to be burn it that quickly
S0024	i might have get it up too high i don't know
S0144	be it cos too much air be get in it
S0024	i turn it down but er i don't know really
S0144	it's just eat those log
S0024	mm but i dunno just it should it could be hotter i just want enough hot water that's all
S0144	yeah
S0024	for the next two days
S0144	mm
S0024	two days it's or well tonight no tomorrow and the next day that should last all of that hot water
S0144	mm
S0024	if we keep the fire go all night tonight
S0144	hmm
S0024	what be you say about evictions
S0144	er oh yeah i think this be in bristol there be some squatters that move into this like mansion place
S0024	ooh do they get to keep it
S0144	this be a typical daily mail story and it have like before and after picture of these squatters and it like call them like dirty squatters
S0024	mm
S0144	trash this beautiful house you know it have before and after and it be all kind of dirty and mess up but uh i dunno i i sympathise with a lot of squatters
S0024	how do they manage to find a mansion to go and move into
S0144	i don't know i mean no one be live in it they didn't like kick any one out
S0024	no
S0144	it wasn't like an empty house
S0024	well they can't stay there too long otherwise they have right
S0144	yeah
S0024	won't they
S0144	well yeah
S0024	or do you
S0144	you do
S0024	you do
S0144	yeah i don't know how they get kick out but and it be say you know there be drug equipment around and i don't know typical like daily mail language but i don't know i don't know i think some squat be okay if people be like homeless and you know it's live on the sleep on the streets or go into an empty house that's be empty for three years
S0024	there's so many empty house
S0144	yeah but have you see what they do to them
S0024	the squatters
S0144	no the council
S0024	the council they just let them rot
S0144	no well first of all they rip out all of them plumb so they can't use the toilets or any of the tap
S0024	yeah
S0144	and the bath
S0024	what so that the squatters can't go in there
S0144	yeah so any one who do squat be force to like crap on the floor
S0024	mm
S0144	which be why they're call dirty squatters cos they cos they didn't have any toilets i'm sure they would have you know if you've get the choice of use a toilet and not use a toilet
S0024	yeah
S0144	any sane person would use a toilet
S0024	well cause you would but you can't say they they wouldn't have rip out all the bathrooms in a mansion
S0144	no that's what the council do when they're
S0024	oh
S0144	they've get these in cos it stop they wanna stop them er go in and that's use as a deterrent to stop them and then they board er all the window up and
S0024	mm
S0144	a lot of the place they even put security guard on them and they're use you know a lot of tax payers money
S0024	mm
S0144	and it's keep a guard out there with a dog all night hmm
S0024	that's crazy
S0144	but i remember there be a programme on tv that this bloke be try to get all these empty house use for
S0024	yeah he's famous now
S0144	be he
S0024	he's on there every day nearly
S0144	be he
S0024	yeah he's on there nearly every day
S0144	yeah he's i don't know if i like him
S0024	um
S0144	he's a bite of a
S0024	try to save yeah but at least he's do something good about
S0144	yeah
S0024	he's try to save all the house
S0144	i don't know for whose benefit really
S0024	well it doesn't matter for whose benefit if it's for er everybody's benefit in the end
S0144	yeah i suppose there be no altruistic act be there
S0024	no at least um cos they're they're be they do new build as well no they be just try to do up all of the council place
S0144	oh right
S0024	so even if he because he's get a television programme can do up like three house or
S0144	mm
S0024	get people onto those low rent plan or something like that then do it yeah
S0144	mm mm i dunno it's tricky innit
S0024	if i could not if i want to do a tv programme i don't but you know if you could do something good at the same time as do the programme um maybe you want to get famous by it or maybe you
S0144	mm
S0024	want to get money through it i don't know it doesn't matter though
S0144	mm
S0024	it doesn't matter
S0144	no
S0024	better than just do any old programme when it doesn't help anybody
S0144	yeah but what i do object to be i mean we've both work our arses off our whole life we've both get mas now and we can't buy a bloody house
S0024	well we could get a mortgage if we want
S0144	pf no thank
S0024	well exactly we don't want to go into the into the whole trap
S0144	yeah but we can't realistically if you look at the price we can't afford it i know we could if we borrow
S0024	well yeah it's all about borrow
S0144	well yeah but
S0024	but it always have be even in in the past it's always be borrow some money to get yourself start
S0144	yeah
S0024	to get yourself on the um ladder
S0144	but not right now i mean look at the comparison
S0024	yeah i i agree with you
S0144	like ten years ago to now
S0024	that's why we're not gonna buy
S0144	and even equate the inflation then it's it's just ridiculous
S0024	yeah i think so too
S0144	and it's the thing that annoy me be when people get give all this accommodation
S0024	who get give it oh what
S0144	well like really low income and
S0024	yeah oh yeah that annoy me that the they can sign up to the council
S0144	and then they have ten kid and get a massive house
S0024	yeah
S0144	i mean that's
S0024	well that's always be the case with the if you know how to play the system then you you play it and that's what they do
S0144	but that's not an argument be it say that's always be the case
S0024	no no
S0144	so therefore it's it's okay
S0024	mm
S0144	i mean
S0024	no i think it's wrong that they all get them but then what what can they do if there's a sixteen year old be kick out of her house pregnant
S0144	mm
S0024	then
S0144	but that's the biggest problem in this country well hang on i'm get on my pedestal now
S0024	the biggest
S0144	one of them no this be go to attitudes of people
S0024	oh yeah they're all claim from the system and want everything that they can get their hand on
S0144	yeah they're not strive
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	i mean if they be force if they if they weren't give all that stuff they would be force to strive to better themselves
S0024	oh yeah
S0144	and people be bear with this mentality where they don't need any of that
S0024	yeah
S0144	they don't need to strive
S0024	they just want everything give to them on a plate
S0144	yeah which be why we've get all these foreign workers come in who be strive because that's their work ethic
S0024	mm mm
S0144	i mean we know because we've see them
S0024	oh yeah
S0144	like work like mm where they live it's completely different
S0024	but you can't say that of everybody who's like in the country but
S0144	oh no of course not and no yeah but there's a lot of people
S0024	yeah oh i agree yeah there be a lot
S0144	and that mentality i think that mentality will be destroy when the economy collapse
S0024	mm
S0144	it's gonna have to be and it's gonna be very painful for a lot of people
S0024	it's gonna be painful for us if we stay in england
S0144	mm well i don't think mm i think it's go to be painful wherever you go really it would be painful here yeah
S0024	i know
S0144	anyway hmm
S0024	anyway er tell me tell me what you be say all this you keep say about the mail and the word that it use and its typical mail language what do you mean
S0144	the what

S0144	oh the daily mail
S0024	you say this be typical language for the mail
S0144	oh no they always take issue like this and
S0024	and this be
S0144	you know they take a very right wing kind of approach and just whinge about everything take a popular story and um mm you know whether it be about immigrants or terrorism or
S0024	what they whinge about it from an upper middle class
S0144	well they sensationalise it not not the same way like the sun do it always just kind of whinging

S0024	they might shout a few things or something but
S0144	but yeah
S0024	i don't know most of them be alright they're just they're just hang around
S0144	yeah
S0024	but i like when we be when we be travel and stuff i use to always say that oh the kid the teenagers or the kid um aren't so intimidate in other place
S0144	yeah
S0024	but it's just the same they're just still hang out do their own thing
S0144	bo it's different though
S0024	mm
S0144	it be different i mean you could feel it so much live in abroad
S0024	sometimes you can feel their eye burn into you or something
S0144	yeah but in a different way
S0024	oh
S0144	do you mean here or there
S0024	no here
S0144	here yeah
S0024	cos this be where i where i have always felt most intimidate by group of young people
S0144	yeah
S0024	be here
S0144	this be the most dangerous country we've ever be
S0024	i think it's cos we've have so many
S0144	well you've be to america so
S0144	maybe maybe not then
S0024	yeah i be intimidate there too
S0144	yeah
S0024	but
S0144	but i think countries with an aggressive foreign policy be often have a aggressive domestic um
S0024	mm
S0144	culture
S0024	yeah
S0144	cos i think it just filter down cos you have to grow them up aggressive in order to export the violence
S0024	mm i don't know about it you see i think that all boil down to tv and game and stuff as well
S0144	well my computer have just over heat
S0024	what just like that

S0144	but that's that's not from the heart that's just repeat funny you know they're they're
S0024	yeah yeah stuff that they're not suppose to say
S0144	yeah that be a bad er i think in vietnam it be it be more the older people because of the history they've have i think the kid i think the kid over there be fine
S0024	yeah well course they be they have the whole of the community tell them off
S0144	mm
S0024	if they do anything wrong
S0144	well yeah

S0144	no i don't agree with that
S0024	mm
S0144	but i do think like kid be get a shorter time to be kid
S0024	but why
S0144	they're get so much pressure
S0024	they don't work any more
S0144	to develop sexually more than anything
S0024	yeah but like you know i have i start babysitting when i be thirteen i have a job in a shop when i be fourteen
S0144	yeah but that's different that's develop in a work kind of way kid aren't even the ones that be a lot older
S0024	no cos they can't do that any more
S0144	no cos they can't do it
S0024	they can't even get job any more
S0144	no
S0024	well they find it harder i think they can do paper round and stuff still but
S0144	but they no but they're they're encourage to develop yeah their their sexual nature
S0024	mm
S0144	i mean look at um um go back when do it start i suppose like with um hmm well er it's a gradual process isn't it
S0024	yeah
S0144	but do you remember s club juniors or something
S0024	s club seven
S0144	no the the little ones
S0024	okay
S0144	they be about i don't know ten
S0024	oh
S0144	and they be all tarted up in short skirt and makeup
S0024	yeah the
S0144	do this sexy dance and all that
S0024	mm
S0144	and that kind of stuff filter down and get exaggerate over time
S0024	mm
S0144	you know what i mean and that's that's what these kid be they're their role model
S0024	mm
S0144	i mean when i grow up my kid my my role model be do you know what i mean cartoon character or
S0024	yeah but
S0144	football players or
S0024	you know
S0144	but now
S0024	all
S0144	look at this pop idol and all that stuff you know
S0024	i'm say it's be a long long a good many many many years that girls have hitch their skirt up at school
S0144	yeah
S0024	that girls have i don't know start experiment when they're very young
S0144	yeah
S0024	i mean i have kid in my high school that get pregnant there be kid like it's it's be go on years
S0144	mm yeah i'm not say it hasn't i'm say it's get worse
S0024	and i think we look at kid as be no but i think we look at kid as be very different to us or mum the generation before us or
S0144	yeah
S0024	but actually i don't think it's that different
S0144	yeah or that
S0024	you get older
S0144	yeah that's a sign of get old
S0024	yeah you get older and you think oh god look at look at them all tarted up
S0144	yeah that's true
S0024	tom i i remember get tarted up on a night out you know little mini skirt
S0144	mm mm
S0024	so
S0144	but you didn't have it shove down your throat every time the tv be on
S0024	no no and er i'd and we weren't allow to wear makeup at school
S0144	yeah
S0024	whereas they do now or not so much makeup nobody wear extreme amount of makeup at school
S0144	yeah and things like it i'm go back to facebook again it always seem to crop up doesn't it ha but even things like that where it's all about you and your image
S0024	yeah
S0144	and how you've gotta portray yourself to other people and
S0024	but why why do that make them grow up faster
S0144	well because they're more conscious about their image
S0024	and make them more aggressive
S0144	and they they have to create this identity for themselves
S0024	mm
S0144	and what what be a popular identity then they get that idea from things they see on tv
S0024	mm
S0144	popular culture
S0024	mm
S0144	and it's be as far as i can see have be target towards like younger and younger people
S0024	yeah
S0144	just the market of it
S0024	yeah but like the i mean we be start off on the profession
S0144	mm
S0024	of kid
S0144	mm i don't know what happen
S0024	like that's not like a typical role model thing be it like some aggressive kid mind you what do we see didn't we see one of those i'm embarrass to say we saw a big brother
S0144	what about it
S0024	and there be a boy on there you say um he be on there he be only seventeen or something he be on there because
S0144	well he get kick off that show for take drug or something didn't he
S0024	he yeah and he become like a massive role model
S0144	i think so cos yeah
S0024	and
S0144	yeah yeah but again that stuff have happen for years as well hasn't it
S0024	yeah yeah
S0144	but he be young i mean he look young
S0024	yeah he look very young
