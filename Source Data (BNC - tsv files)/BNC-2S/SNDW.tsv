S0644	oh there's a little river there as well look
S0607	so cute i like the woods type thing do you
S0644	yeah i do see if it have be snow or rain it would it would also have be quite nice this
S0607	yeah
S0644	i wouldn't have that but the fact that it be it's spring like innit and it's beautiful and those deers those little deers
S0607	ah so cute but sorry you be just say something and then i be like stop
S0644	that's okay i think all i be say be it come down to this i think it's probably be better educationally er cos there's no distraction and it's all very simple and that but i think you miss out on too much fun
S0607	yeah actually that be like you know really not necessarily the most fun it probably be the most fun part of my life and it be all about those boys
S0644	slut
S0607	i mean it be just like it be so great
S0644	yeah it be just fun weren't it
S0607	do you use to go to house party
S0644	yeah erm now i think of it i suppose they weren't really party they be just everyone sit around like there wasn't there wasn't always music and that but sit around and have a drink and yeah somebody be sick somewhere
S0644	yeah they be good they be good or other party do you know what we use to go club from quite early they be like special kids' club
S0607	oh really
S0644	yeah like if you have to be under it be up to sixteen and stuff but they be really good there be one in we use to go to like one there be once a month there be one in and everyone use to go on a saturday night and it be just brilliant
S0607	isn't that brilliant so hang what kind of thing erm be it how be it organise
S0644	well there be one in that be call
S0644	and it be just really cool everyone be about we be about fourteen i suppose you could be thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen
S0607	so it be for that age group who be start to get
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm it be for that age group
S0644	yeah the oldest people be probably about sixteen seventeen
S0607	that's so good
S0644	it be
S0607	i always use to think that whenever anything be put on for that age range it be far too nerdy for any of us to go
S0644	a bite sad yeah no these be like actual like proper good they be probably better than some of the ones i've be to recently actually
S0607	that's brilliant
S0607	and at and at what time what sort of time like what what time do you go home
S0644	it probably finish about eleven
S0607	that's so great
S0644	yeah it be it be really good
S0607	and probably your mum and dad could feel like it be ace as well
S0644	funny i don't remember get i don't remember all we use to just seem to be able to go it's funny that
S0607	who who be it organise by do you remember
S0644	erm i remember the little club where it be it's like a a community hall type thing that in the town and it be just an organise you know like you'd have a club night
S0607	yeah
S0644	it be just that sort of thing it be really good but there be this one in that be on i think almost every saturday night almost every saturday night friday nights be indie night and i wasn't into indie at the time
S0607	mm
S0644	saturday nights be reggae nights and that be good cos it have all like the up start of drum and base and start of hard core well hard core have already start but the commercial hard core like the prodigy and all that kind of stuff
S0607	oh i love the prodigy
S0644	and it be just brilliant it be so excite you could get drink in there like everyone be piss they be on
S0607	really
S0644	yeah you could get you could get booze in there somehow i think you have to be it be for eighteens but they have i think you could be sixteen to twenty one or something like that
S0607	yeah
S0644	sixteen to twenty one but it we be all about fourteen fifteen
S0644	and they'd let us in and i dunno how we get away with it actually but they be just really good nights
S0607	ah that's so great do you have to get a cab home
S0644	erm sometimes we use to stay at my house a bite for that and we use to stay at my friend my other friend's so i get away with quite a lot really when i think about it so sometimes my mum would pick us up sometimes we get a cab
S0607	yeah
S0644	yeah sometimes we get a cab back
S0607	i go through a stage where i be like between the age of fourteen and sixteen it be a constant battle against my dad to be allow to do things
S0644	yeah
S0607	and it be mainly these house party cos there be luckily there be a couple of parent say get on with it who would have these party so one be this girl call whose mum be divorce from her dad er cos she have this big house in the middle of nowhere in the countryside
S0644	yeah
S0607	and she would just let her have a massive party and erm er they're but then so she would just not supervise really she would be there somewhere but you never really saw her
S0607	you might see her at the begin erm she be never there and and that the party ones be brilliant because it's by the way i think this be really naughty and very erm
S0644	irresponsible
S0607	not right but my mum and dad use to ring whoever's parent be have this party and ask if
S0644	yeah
S0607	be they gonna be supervise
S0644	and they'd go yeah
S0607	and 's mum would say yes but she be never there
S0607	she be never there we just do whatever we want
S0644	oh
S0607	so i'm lucky i didn't have teenage pregnancy or something
S0644	oh
S0607	because basically we all sleep in the same room i remember erm this be get a bite like i can't tell you this now
S0607	but nothing you know really untoward happen
S0644	really untoward
S0607	erm but and then there be another there be a guy whose parent use to let him have a party
S0644	mm
S0607	but they be honest so my dad would call up in fact my dad know him
S0644	mm
S0607	cos he be their lawyer and he would say be it erm supervise and they would say no
S0607	and in fact
S0644	let them get on with it
S0607	that bloke's mother say to my mum if i be you i wouldn't let her come
S0607	so have i put it on too warm now or be it nice
S0644	it be a bite shall i put it back on
S0607	be it toasty
S0644	put it back on it's alright
S0607	i think i go too far the other way
S0607	yeah and i be like bloody thank a lot i couldn't believe it i be totally doom then
S0644	oh
S0607	so when it be that guy's house i be i start cos i make such a stink about it with my dad like the it be constant row about these party so at 's i be able to go but of course they only have one like twice a year
S0644	mm mm
S0607	and then this other guy he have them quite a lot so then my dad go for a compromise i be allow to go but of course no way be i allow to stay over
S0644	stay the night
S0607	but that mean my dad have to come and get me and then he would like decide on the time
S0644	yeah
S0607	it be so mortify
S0644	yeah
S0607	be like my dad's here to get me
S0644	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0607	and of course dad doesn't wanna stay up till like two
S0644	no
S0607	so he would probably come and get me at
S0644	no ten twelve
S0607	maybe like twelve
S0644	yeah
S0607	or in fact maybe even a bite earlier and that be just so nothing
S0607	it mean that nothing could really get go for me do you know what i mean cos it be like
S0644	yeah
S0607	it all have an end time
S0644	yeah yeah yeah
S0607	whereas at 's house
S0644	what age be that
S0607	well that be probably between fourteen and sixteen but cos i remember one time i remember that when i hit seventeen i be suddenly just allow to do it all when i be seventeen i be suddenly allow
S0644	yeah
S0607	to go club and everything whereas before i have be club but it wasn't allow very difficult to to to wangle it
S0644	yeah
S0607	erm but then it be wonderful
S0607	thank you dad for let me go one year before the legal age
S0607	erm and then we really do also though i be i be one of the youngest in my year so you can't so i be probably
S0644	yeah
S0607	probably so i be
S0644	eighteen when you be just seventeen
S0607	when i yeah so erm but at 's house though there be no such limitation so you would just stay up mainly stay up till dawn
S0644	brilliant
S0607	and erm and and then all the interest stuff start to happen all these conversations that you have like there would always be some boy who you hadn't speak to before and you'd suddenly be sit on the farm gate
S0644	mm
S0607	at dawn chat so really deep about something
S0607	do you know what i mean
S0644	yeah we have a few of it be more they weren't so much party they be at people's house where the parent either weren't there or have go out and
S0607	mm
S0644	and i do remember a couple of those i remember once there be me and another girl and we be stay at this other girl's house and her house be so horrible it be really dirty and disgust
S0607	oh
S0644	and er she wasn't from it be all a bite wrong all of it like she didn't come from a very good start and all the rest of it and erm once we be stay there and her mum come home with this bloke and i could remember he be call
S0644	and he be just hideous
S0607	oh no
S0644	and she say erm and she'd just pick him up i dunno they'd be out all be out somewhere we'd get home about eleven and then her mum come home even later like sometimes the mum would come home sometimes she wouldn't sort of thing like
S0607	yeah
S0644	we could just go and stay there whenever and it didn't really matter she'd come home and though you could tell they'd both be piss and we be all like these fifteen nearly sixteen year old girls still sit there and her and and she say i hope everyone's feel very open mind tonight because 's gonna stay here and we be just like what i couldn't believe it like i imagine
S0644	imagine if your mum come home and do that
S0607	yeah
S0644	say that in front of you and be nothing to shout about
S0644	you know what i mean and i just think oh right yeah and you couldn't say no you be stay at their house but
S0607	yeah
S0644	i just think how bizarre
S0607	actually erm i would like to go home
S0644	that that go on now
S0607	look at that one
S0644	be that a redwood there
S0607	we we can't see how tall they they're get
S0644	let's have some look at this
S0607	we're not at the tallest bite
S0644	be this the redwood forest
S0607	i think we're it's start it's not fully in but it's oh that's fantastic
S0644	tree be beautiful i'm gonna hug a tree today
S0607	yeah i think we've like erm start to forget the topics
S0644	yeah we're get distract but it start what we be talk about basically be the difference between go to a school where there's boys and and all the things that follow on from that like the go out
S0607	mm
S0644	and the fun and party and all of that sort of thing
S0607	but no i mean like our topics i'm try to think now what
S0644	oh
S0607	i'm actually start to feel like we're just now get into normal every day conversation and we've forget
S0644	i don't mind
S0607	things that i'm sure there be something things that i really want to tell you but i can't remember what they be now everything be a whole topic and now i'm like but what be
S0644	well
S0607	we haven't finish cover the theory of everything though have we
S0644	the theory of everything will never end erm the theory of everything will never end there be load of things before come away that i want to talk but now don't seem important like work
S0607	yeah
S0644	how much i dislike that job
S0607	now it's all just
S0644	yeah
S0607	yeah you be gonna tell me about that job
S0644	oh i know what i'll tell you about the it be more like it be start where it end yesterday
S0607	be it because you didn't finish tell me about the thing
S0644	i'm determine to tell you the project
S0607	yeah because i realise at one point yesterday i be like so hang on i still don't know about the project
S0644	well it's not really urgent and we there be far bigger fish to fry cos we come across that lovely scenery and all that stuff so it's fun like
S0607	yeah
S0644	it's not a it's just something that i want to eventually tell you about because it's it sort of lead onto make load and load and load of money
S0607	yeah
S0644	so i'll try and be as quick as possible i know i say that yesterday and wish i hadn't do it
S0644	but it be so that's how my idea come about it be from a place of genuinely try to do something good
S0607	yeah
S0644	which i think be good erm but also cos i think he's gonna make load of money because like zumba erm it's a new thing
S0607	mm
S0644	it's not really new but it be a new thing if you market it as a new thing and sell it as a new thing and i have i have everything do for it so basically what happen then be i spend
S0607	be be you gonna tell me a bite about how it would work cos i'm curious to imagine
S0644	well it's so simple it's so so so so simple so i write a manual on it because you have to write a manual for part of this bloody course erm exercise right you know squat
S0607	mm
S0644	squat but hold onto the baby so you squat and then you lift up the baby and that's your shoulder press and then you twist
S0607	no
S0644	either stand or not stand basically i get a girl to do this once i get a girl to do a class with her baby
S0607	yeah
S0644	and demonstrate so i could demonstrate and it be and she be properly in a sweat exercise class
S0607	i bet that be really helpful cos you can then really see what could actually do
S0644	well it be it be so so so so good i think it be so good and i think it's the sort of thing that girls when you've have a baby they wanna get into shape but they don't wanna go to a gym and they it would have be a sociable thing it would have be a
S0607	mm
S0644	there be so many good things to it so and i think and i keep think well why hasn't someone else do this then like
S0607	mm
S0644	it's such a good idea and then i go on youtube and load of people have do it
S0607	be there a be there any bits where she be lay down
S0644	yeah sit up crunch erm plank so many things you can do with a baby and they're more importantly they're things that you need to be able to do if you've get a baby you need to have be able to have good erm coordination and good core strength and good balance and
S0607	mm
S0644	good you know what i mean like there's all these things that to
S0607	and also
S0644	oh
S0607	be there some bits where the baby be just lay there
S0644	yeah but
S0607	but i be think part of
S0644	when you do a press up
S0607	be genius because you can just bring the baby
S0644	that's it
S0607	do you know what i mean why should she not
S0644	but it's actually a bond thing for baby you see because
S0607	mm
S0644	you're they like be pick up and hold and move and carry and sort of
S0607	mm
S0644	lift and they like all that and it be work it be really work but most importantly it be what people fail to realise or seem to have realise be that it start from the word go baby learn behaviour baby learn what's the thing to do so it's no good say well when they're five i'm gonna start go to class i mean you can do it like that but
S0607	yeah
S0644	baby as young as two there's a problem with obesity be baby as young as two cos they're not move enough they're not do this and in this exercise you can see the baby be kick and like all do the things that they should do
S0607	yeah
S0644	like move and it be such a genius genius idea and when i would tell people about it they'd all go oh yeah that's a really good idea i'd do that i dunno if they be just be polite
S0607	and what do that girl think the one who do it the one
S0644	she think it be a really good workout she she be sweat you could see she be out of breath
S0607	mm
S0644	and sweat and but the baby like it the baby would like oh not that i'm gonna send it to you cos i'm sure you but you would see if i show it to you
S0607	yeah
S0644	anyway so erm find out i think well look this be an idea and i think if i don't do it i'll never know i'll never it's all very well isn't it talk about i've get this brilliant idea and i'm gonna do this and it's gonna if you don't actually do anything about it you'll never know
S0607	mm
S0644	so i think to myself erm that's what i'll do so i know i'd also realise from this point you're never gonna make a lot of money do fitness stuff unless
S0607	mm
S0644	unless you come up with something original
S0607	a brand or something
S0644	or come up with some or unless you be just happy do all the class and all the rest of it and
S0607	mm
S0644	anyway so erm in short what you have to do there's a company call reps it's call register of exercise professionals and if you be a fitness instructor you have to belong to them and in order to belong to them you've gotta have insurance you've gotta have qualifications it's like corgi register you know what i mean
S0607	mm
S0644	like if you're an electrician electrician
S0607	mm
S0644	it's like be corgi register that say you be legit erm
S0607	yeah
S0644	you've get all the necessary things and you're fit to work in that industry
S0607	yeah
S0644	it's basically another money spin thing really erm so i phone them up and i say look so if i have an idea of a course how do i go about it and i say oh yeah yeah yeah we do all that in order to get your course endorse which be what they call it you've gotta do this you know you've gotta do all
S0607	yeah
S0644	follow this procedure you've gotta follow all this information so and it be not a straightforward thing you have to do a course to show that you're able to teach so a very like a basic teach your class so what
S0607	yeah
S0644	what you do be you you get the idea and you develop it into a course and then the idea
S0607	do you have to pay for all of this
S0644	yeah through the nose and the idea would be that i've get this idea you're a fitness instructor you come on my course pay me the money then you're allow to go and teach my course
S0607	oh i see yeah yeah yeah
S0644	that's how that's how zumba work
S0607	yeah yeah
S0644	that's how they make all their money cos they've get the zumba erm franchise or or brand you come and do the course then you can go and teach it
S0607	yeah
S0644	and that's how you make your money so for example like you can pay a hundred and fifty pound to do a day course up to a about a hundred and fifty pound to do a day course more sometimes but i think
S0607	yeah
S0644	a hundred and fifty be quite a good amount now if you get six people on your course obviously you've gotta pay your tax and all the rest of it and your room hire where you're gonna teach
S0607	yeah
S0644	but six people hang on what be that
S0607	sorry i'm just to unzip this thing seem to be shut no matter what i do
S0644	that's a grand a day
S0607	yeah and that's for when that's for when you're teach them how to teach it
S0644	yeah
S0607	oh sorry
S0644	so like you know if you go on a creative creative write course you pay your money
S0607	but be it like an and be it like erm they can't teach your thing without you teach them like be there like erm
S0644	yeah a qualification
S0607	but be it also a erm what d'you call it a erm approve course so that you have to have a but have you get like not copyright but do you know what i mean
S0644	yeah totally
S0607	yeah
S0644	so like for me if i want to be able to teach spin in order to teach the spin class you have to go to a place where they be erm authorise you it belong to that company basically and unless you've get the company approve course you you can't teach it
S0607	mm
S0644	erm so yeah that be the idea so i look into it i i write this manual and i take a job that be really rubbish money so that i could leave early in the day and have a day off a week erm to carry on do cos there be no time you know what i mean it's like anything else
S0607	yeah
S0644	so i be write this manual as it so happen i have january off last year because my dad have to have an operation on his leg
S0607	oh yeah i remember
S0644	do you remember so i be off for a month look after him and i'd do that in the even or in the day or whatever and do you want me to steer
S0607	sorry
S0644	i can steer i don't mind
S0607	that's so bad isn't it i've do i've finish now do it now
S0644	carry on hold your stop
S0607	it's alright it's alright
S0644	it's not really bad
S0644	people do eat don't they as they're go along oh look oh wow
S0607	where's the drive through coffee place
S0644	yeah i be get a bite like jittery
S0607	yeah lightheaded and you know
S0644	i could just do with a fix
S0607	i didn't know that we would have this i i don't i know that sound daft but i just
S0644	what the woods
S0607	i didn't know that we would have this road i think i i haven't be able to understand how it all be but now i think we be officially in
S0644	redwood territory
S0607	yeah so you have january off to
S0644	and it it literally take about at least that's when i get most of the work do but i do so much research like there be a there be a woman call i can't remember what her name be and she'd recently do this research she be from so i be gonna say i go to can i come and meet you to discuss your research and use it in my manual to prove that women should do exercise with baby
S0607	yeah
S0644	cos that's gonna go in my favour and all the rest of it blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so i do load of work on it now i have check before with these people i say i've get this idea can i do it they yeah yeah that sound fine all it mean all it be you've gotta do this you've gotta do this you've gotta do this a course in that write this manual a course in this
S0607	yeah
S0644	so i do have to do load of course on one of these course i meet this woman erm and she be really nice i really like her and erm actually i'm not even gonna bother with that cos it's all just negative rubbish
S0644	the bottom line be i do load of work i go on two course
S0607	yeah
S0644	ah that's it i have to do a course another course in erm exercise for pregnancy in postnatal women
S0607	yeah yeah
S0644	especially cos if you're do any some without get like too into it you can imagine how much work go into it
S0607	yeah
S0644	it take about a year longer really i take days off i get this girl to come and film the thing i have to get my friend to film it
S0607	yeah
S0644	i have to pay him to do that i have to ask the people that i use to work for do personal train if i could have that room to do the film in i have to do so much work then it get to this point erm where i be work through it's like a checklist and it say have you do this have you do this have you do this have you do this have you do this have you do this get to this point and it say explain why it's inappropriate to use baby as weight erm as part of a exercise thing and i think well that's that's the entire gist of my
S0607	yeah
S0644	thing so what do you mean erm now i'd already see another bite in the same fuck manual
S0607	yeah
S0644	that say you can exercise that involve baby and children can be do as long as you've do their prerequisite course which i've just be on
S0607	yeah yeah
S0644	so you can do it or what so
S0607	yeah
S0644	i call up this woman and this be when i realise that people don't know what the fuck they're do
S0607	yeah yeah
S0644	so i call up this woman i say hello erm
S0607	i can just imagine i can just imagine
S0644	this be in august right which be just after everything else that have go wrong that year not a very good year and i'd be work on it and work on it and work on it and do all these horrible job that i hat think well pretty soon
S0607	erm
S0644	i'll be teach this course and i'm gonna make about
S0607	oh
S0644	a thousand pound a per day
S0607	for this yeah
S0644	so i get it and i this i phone up this woman i say hello i just i've be work on this and i say i've just come across this bite that say you can't use baby for a weight and she say yeah not a good idea and i say have you do any exercise yourself i say have you get any history in exercise yourself she go all quiet
S0607	have anybody think about the fact that you know you're constantly pick up baby
S0644	well this be it right i'm not be funny even a person without any exercise or particular interest in exercise as you you be
S0644	have just say that it's it's what it's call functional exercise
S0607	exercise
S0644	yeah it's what be call functional exercise so it's the opposite of you know men go to the gym and they just work on that muscle cos they want that muscle so they'll do all these exercise just to build up this particular muscle
S0607	yeah
S0644	cos they wanna look like a certain way functional exercise be do things cos you need to do them
S0607	yeah
S0644	and they're the best exercise so
S0607	yeah
S0644	when we be all cave people we be all get exactly the right kind of exercise by run away from dinosaurs climb up tree swim
S0607	yeah
S0644	erm in all the things that you need to be able to do you've get just
S0644	cos you cos it be functional
S0607	yeah
S0644	in your everyday life
S0607	yeah
S0644	so that's exercise so if you be carry a baby round lift a baby up put a baby down carry shop go up the stairs you need to do stuff that emulate those move you
S0607	yeah
S0644	so it's all exercise it's just you don't call it exercise but this be
S0607	yeah exactly
S0644	this be call it exercise and be gonna be a new craze like
S0607	yeah
