S0540	yeah me too i be just
S0541	yeah up to about three four in the morning
S0540	yeah
S0541	watch it yeah i be er really wide awake then
S0540	yeah
S0541	you know it be kind of so horrible and it be frighten
S0540	i mean
S0541	it's frighten absolutely frighten
S0540	yes and so i ask you know what i should do with the fear and the speed of fear because it doesn't come from god so accord to psalm ninety one because if you feel frighten and scar you need to know this because this be really helpful mm so it say i mean i've be really frighten to take public transport or
S0541	what here
S0540	here even here i feel like i saw that erm that on on run that
S0541	what you
S0540	salah salah
S0541	yeah
S0540	i felt like a saw him on the tube
S0541	mm
S0540	anyway so psalm ninety one say it it you know he's god's word be the truth so if you know the character you wouldn't feel so scar because you'd be so assure by it anyway it say oh if you make the most high your dwell even the lord who be my refuge then no harm will befall you no disaster will come near your tent for he will command his entrance concern you to guard you in all your ways they will lift you up in your hand so that you will not strike your foot against a stone mm the interest thing be here you will not fear the terror of night nor the arrow that fly by day nor the pestilence that stalk in the darkness nor the plague that destroy at midday a thousand may fall at your side ten thousand at your right hand but it will not come near you you will only observe with your eye and see the punishment of the wicked obviously if i'm on the wicked side i would be i dunno but however if you really really really live the word by word the end result would be no fear i mean you know it's difficult i mean i'm absolutely frighten by the spiders in the kitchen but i have to because i cannot keep live in fear so it's a really stressful time you know
S0541	because of the paris thing
S0540	no just mm you know just in general mm i think i have mm my strange passport photos
S0541	mm

S0540	what be this
S0541	it's just basically it's just tagliatelle and i just sautéed the prawn in garlic and chilli chop
S0540	mm
S0541	with chilli that's it and er
S0541	just literally for like three minutes in a little bite of olive oil and then just put salt and pepper and a bite of parmesan and it be really good there be big tiger prawn and that be really yummy but i haven't cook for age
S0540	where do you get the tiger prawn from freeze
S0541	just m and s or waitrose or somewhere
S0540	yeah i need to i you know i i cook a lasagne without the pasta sheet
S0541	i wonder why they be stick
S0540	i don't know my lasagne sheet from waitrose be not very good quality ones
S0541	yeah maybe you should get the ones which be better
S0540	mm erm
S0541	do you put too many in the pan
S0540	well you need to though you need a sort of six sheet and they all have to go into the thing the pan
S0541	you get big big enough pan
S0540	maybe i don't have a big enough pan
S0541	maybe you need to do it in batch so you do some and you put them out and do some and put them out
S0540	oh no
S0541	that might be a better way of do it
S0540	anyway yeah i need to figure out how to
S0541	my mum use to do it all the time
S0540	how do she do it
S0541	she just put them in boil water and then put them out but i think she do it in batch i think you have to if you're do quite a lot i dunno i can't remember she use to make her own pasta as well which be all very elaborate
S0540	yeah
S0541	but er it can't be that complicate i mean there's no reason
S0540	no it can't be
S0541	why they should stick together unless you've get too many in maybe the water's not hot enough or something or
S0540	i don't know there must be
S0541	i mean be you not rinse
S0540	a way
S0541	them in
S0540	rinse do you rinse pasta
S0541	some no actually i don't rinse pasta
S0540	no
S0541	i dunno
S0540	that's the the only problem i have
S0541	well just google it
S0540	yeah i should do shouldn't i
S0541	yeah cos i'm sure you'd find about a million kind of similar it's it's amaze now i've just realise that nobody's have an original think ever because you can just put anything in there and the chance be someone's have the same problem
S0540	oh yeah
S0541	it's true
S0540	that's how i actually you know verify the originality of my research like
S0541	what google it
S0540	yeah i put
S0540	after print okay the digital print you don't see anything
S0541	no
S0540	just my work
S0541	yeah
S0541	well maybe you be the only one
S0540	yeah it's not that amaze i mean you know it's not that innovative well anyway it's er anyway it's just i'm just say it's innovative in a sense that no one else actually even bother to put it up on the website or something
S0541	yeah maybe someone's do it in some corner of the world in some
S0540	oh yeah
S0541	language that you don't understand you know
S0540	but i come across two people who actually contact me say that they have the idea as well but they didn't manage to do it or something
S0541	oh i see
S0540	but those ones be work in my field so they kind of tell me in person you know
S0541	yeah
S0540	oh i also have the idea and i check it a little but it never work or the other one be oh we be gonna do it but we just saw you do it or my publish work so they just decide not to do it sort of like that
S0541	you be in the world of
S0541	digital
S0540	it's so true i mean i mean imagine you know if you you know write you hear i don't know put up something erm online someone else do and that become in demand i don't know er oh i don't know so how do you find airbnb
S0541	erm it's be fine actually
S0540	oh yes
S0541	yeah i have two my first one be a guy who who's like an he be an english arab and so i saw his picture obviously he just look like a kind of he didn't have a beard or anything but his name be something or other
S0540	yeah oh
S0541	and er this obviously it's before paris so
S0540	oh okay
S0541	and i be a bite like oh and then but he seem fine and
S0540	yeah
S0541	and then his friend turn up
S0540	oh yes
S0541	rather than him like he be
S0540	oh yeah
S0541	you know cos i have to hand over the key
S0540	yeah oh right
S0541	and so kind of a woman in her forties so i be kind of reassure by that
S0540	oh good
S0541	and i come back and the flat be perfect
S0540	yeah
S0541	the only thing be they'd use a lot of towel for some strange reason and they'd leave behind a lot of erm beer bottle
S0540	oh yeah
S0541	like the you know the big ones
S0540	yeah
S0541	and there be like twelve of those and they'd

S0540	wow
S0541	so twelve of those and some tonic water so she must have have some vodka or gin or something
S0540	they must have have a party
S0541	well this be what i think and then when i open the recycle bin i saw an airbed erm box
S0540	oh
S0541	which if they'd get smuggle somebody and which would explain the towel
S0540	yeah
S0541	but if they'd smuggle someone in that's naughty because they have to pay extra

S0541	god
S0540	but i don't know
S0540	quite happy not to travel mm quite happy i get really stress out when i travel
S0541	really i love it
S0540	i never use to i think i'm these days i'm just stress out
S0541	but that's only cos of your phd you won't be you should relax now a little bite if you can
S0541	get into worry about
S0540	yeah i should
S0541	a job
S0540	yeah i should do it's just hard
S0541	you might feel better when you come back from japan and like sometimes it's good to have like a physical geographical
S0540	the yeah
S0541	displacement you know
S0540	the thing be i'm dread to go home every time i go home i have such a difficult time it's not that i don't get on with my family but it's always quite intense because i haven't see them for a long time
S0541	mm
S0540	so it's a lot of catch up to do or not catch up to do because i'm so exhaust
S0541	be you not in contact with them a lot on the phone
S0540	no but i of course you know i see my brother a lot
S0541	but your parent
S0540	no i don't really
S0541	really
S0540	no
S0541	you don't ring them
S0540	mm
S0541	why not
S0540	i never do
S0541	how strange
S0540	i never do
S0541	and they don't ring you
S0540	not necessarily
S0541	that's interest
S0540	but i see them when i go home
S0541	oh okay
S0540	i mean of course you know we talk occasionally about things very rare maybe you know every half a year three months
S0541	wow that's amaze
S0540	i don't talk to my father these days because you know he's he he work in ireland and usually i don't just you know i usually talk call my mother and then talk to my father mm i dunno but still you know they never change that much so i haven't and i'm old you know i'm not like a teenager i mean i think in japan we have this kind of culture where once you grow up you don't contact them that much
S0541	really
S0540	mm maybe that's not so strong here but in japan it's not that unknown
S0541	okay
S0540	mm and i think it's an age thing
S0541	mm
S0540	but i'm close to my you know brother in a way a family member and then you know and then my news get circulate through him in a way
S0541	mm
S0540	so there be kind of you know indirect
S0541	mm
S0540	contact with the rest of my family i just see my brother or i'm talk to my younger sister
S0541	mm
S0540	yeah i'm terrible i'm terrible in keep in touch that's the thing i'm terrible i never really call up call my parent on weekend i should do though i feel like time be short
S0541	mm
S0540	i'm really not very good with long distant kind of erm relationships
S0541	mm i'm amaze you don't use skype and all that stuff that be around now that make it so easy
S0540	no it's we no
S0541	video call
S0540	no
S0541	and stuff
S0540	it doesn't make it easy because you know my father doesn't use skype my mother use skype or we er a little bite er
S0541	mm
S0540	not that technically savvy so we just end up talk on the phone
S0541	mm
S0540	which be fine somehow because landline's cheap now these days to call landlines
S0541	oh be it
S0540	mm oh but i mean i do i do think that you know because i've be live you know abroad for so long this be the norm but it's not healthy i don't think could be better for sure it's it they're so difficult to change i mean it's be like this for a long time
S0541	i mean yeah i guess so if there's a pattern but you know well i mean it's fine if they don't mind
S0540	but i do feel a bite awkward you know and so i you know i feel like er just a bite tire when i go home i can't quite relax entirely there's a bite of catch up at the begin then relax after that but because i'm only there for two days i mean there's not much of be a couch potato and then completely relax
S0541	mm
S0540	and there's not much we can you know i mean i will probably have a couple of days with my mother cos he have to go back to this ireland and i will probably oh er you know
S0541	i'm sure it will be nice to go
S0540	it will be nice to go but i'm just yeah you know
S0541	you're probably just tire
S0540	just think of the journey to heathrow six o'clock in the morning i'm fly with finnair so go to helsinki

S0541	yeah
S0540	in ireland where he work
S0541	yeah
S0540	and and that be bizarre because just so cold
S0541	oh no
S0540	er oh anyway
S0541	oh well listen we should celebrate the end of your when you get back
S0540	yeah
S0541	we should celebrate the put to bed of the thesis the dawn of a new era
S0540	be you still record
S0541	i think so
S0540	oh good
S0541	i think so
S0540	fantastic
S0541	i haven't send anything in yet they be email me about it and i say i be gonna do it and then i and then i didn't i start prepare it all
S0540	oh yes
S0541	and then i get sidetrack by some other pointless activity of like apply apply for some pointless job which obviously i would never get
S0541	which be kind of how i spend weeks of my life these days
S0540	oh
S0541	and it's pointless applications but erm
S0540	you'll get somewhere
S0541	i don't think so i fail another thing you know i fail a erm i find another thing and i apply for it
S0540	oh yes
S0541	yeah it be like another editorial thing and i i apply for it you know the work from home thing
S0540	oh
S0541	and i apply for it and i get past the first test and then
S0540	mm
S0541	they be like we want you to do another test so the second test be two hours long and i do the second test and i wait to hear and then they say you fail it
S0540	wow
S0541	and erm they say you have too many errors and erm and it be quite funny like you have to kind of like edit these three piece and then and then you have to give erm some feedback to the writers and then you have to give some feedback to the client well that be a separate exercise
S0540	that sound like a really hard task
S0541	it be quite a lot to do in er like time be short so on the feedback to the writers obviously i have i just pick like a couple of point each i be like oh well you know cos obviously like i'm gonna run out of time right so i'm not gonna this be not the exercise the the exercise be do the edit and then they come back and they say oh i wasn't erm i be too abrupt with the writers in my feedback and like you you you know you didn't kind of or i didn't massage my comment enough for them they be kind of like too direct i be like for god's sake like what
S0540	oh my god
S0541	what world do we live in you know what world do we live in you know when you're give feedback to someone like you're straight and to the point you're not like oh oh oh ah oh oh oh
S0540	yeah
S0541	oh oh
S0541	it be so ridiculous but anyway they just say oh well so you fail that but we'd erm we'd be delight if you'd join our network of writers
S0540	wow well that's something
S0541	not really because i because it's gonna pay even worse than the editors which be quite bad but better than the last one erm it'll it'll pay really really badly and erm so then of course i i go to the website to kind of launch this this thing register and there's another test i'm like you know it's like i haven't do it yet because obviously i lose the will to live because that be like two days of my life you know do all this crap just another waste of time
S0540	i mean why don't you just forget about the online thing and
S0541	well what be i gonna do
S0540	you know
S0541	no i'm i've i've apply for all sort of stuff
S0540	mm
S0541	and it's you know why be we anyway whatever i dunno
S0540	mm oh i see
S0541	it's it's kind of you know it's quite difficult to get work that be not something you've do before
S0540	yeah of course yeah
S0541	cos that's what people recruit for
S0540	yeah
S0541	so even if it's like a low job i have a harder time with the low job
S0540	mm
S0541	because i you just look at my cv and like you've gotta be joke so it's a bite of a problem it really be
S0540	yeah okay
S0541	kind of find something that be just like a you know just something to do which will pay some kind of you know basic money but i don't know what you're gonna be look for but it's it's really difficult you know unless you go and work in a shop which i'm not gonna do sorry not because i feel i'm above it but i'm just like you know so it's really hard it's just really difficult
S0540	mm
S0541	it's just very difficult to find i've apply for for everything so it's really hard i i dunno i dunno i haven't get a solution and i can't seem to find one unfortunately no matter how hard i look and how hard i try
S0540	what about this thing cos that sound really good
S0541	yeah i i be gonna do that but
S0540	mm
S0541	the exams aren't till i've get to i need to redo my cv so i need to completely rework it
S0540	oh
S0541	in a new way and i want to find like a charity edit thing like
S0540	mm
S0541	to do as a project
S0540	mm
S0541	so so i want to kind of be engage on that
S0540	mm mm
S0541	when i be do my application
S0540	mm mm
S0541	cos i think it would give me like
S0540	yeah
S0541	some er additional kind of necessary
S0540	yeah experience
S0541	gravitas
S0540	gravitas
S0541	you know cos i'm come from a consumer background
S0540	yeah
S0541	recently anyway so and i haven't kind of like and i ask somebody about it who's run like a charity project but i haven't hear back from him and i don't think he want to share any of it with me so i kind of need to find something so that in itself be quite difficult because or obviously a lot of the kind of global organisations employ people
S0540	mm
S0541	or they have intern or they er so volunteer and something like that be quite i haven't find anything yet i need to keep look i be look today actually
S0540	mm
S0541	so i've have an issue with that so i really want to apply for that before christmas
S0540	mm
S0541	but then the exams aren't until july
S0540	yeah
S0541	so even if i pass the write exam in july there's then an aural an aural exam after that so then presumably september would be the earliest point if i pass all of those things which at the moment my track record be just i'm not pass anything which be quite worry
S0540	mm
S0541	so then if i pass all of those then i'd be eligible to apply for stuff from september
S0540	oh my
S0541	yeah so i've get to kind of get from here to there
S0540	yeah i know i have the same
S0541	so nine months ten months
S0540	yeah
S0541	and then i might not even and even if i fail it's not a disaster it just mean that i lose another year so anyway it's quite difficult you know it's quite difficult
S0540	especially if you be just you know er have to you know live the moment i mean you know survive the
S0541	it's just a nightmare
S0540	tomorrow yeah mm
S0541	it's just i dunno i feel like i'm kind of walk through treacle like i'm never get anywhere i keep you know
S0540	mm
S0541	everything everything fall through
S0540	mm
S0541	it's be the theme of the year it's just be the theme like everything have fall through
S0540	you will come out of it very strong
S0541	i don't know if i will
S0540	you will come out
S0541	i think
S0540	you will
S0541	i'll come out of it a break woman
S0540	no er you know when i saw you know go really mad i think oh my god that's really really sad cos she's i think come out strong yet she's say that
S0541	really
S0540	you will find out you know if you if you catch up with but i think she must have go through such hell she must have such hell
S0541	but what hell
S0540	you know
S0540	she have to give birth you know when wasn't around remember when we go to see her
S0541	but he turn up for the birth didn't he
S0540	in a in a extremely awkward kind of you know er it er er cos you know he didn't know er his sister find out about it on facebook etcetera etcetera you know it just go basically you know everything be fall apart and she be just really really you know off basically because of that and now i think it she's fine i mean i have really be have a very hard time you know besides you know my work and everything you know but i think we be here to just go through this and come out stronger
S0541	i dunno i'm look forward to kind of close the door on twenty fifteen
S0541	it's be like annus horribulis it really have
S0540	oh
S0541	it have like it's be a really bad year but anyway
S0540	you will survive because you already have
S0541	yeah it's just that kind of like really basic component of kind of make a live which be allude me at the moment
S0540	yes
S0541	it's kind of quite worry
S0540	oh but i think i mean i'm so you know the you're cos you're keep at it you just you're do so well
S0541	i didn't today i just couldn't do anything i'm so demoralise i just you know
