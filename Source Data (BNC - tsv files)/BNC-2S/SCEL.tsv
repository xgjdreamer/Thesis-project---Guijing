S0115	what be you make
S0037	well i be think about make a little hat
S0115	yeah
S0037	the problem with me be that
S0115	such as that one yeah it look very stripy and complicate
S0037	i don't really like the pointy bite on the end of that though i think it look a bite stupid do you know what i mean can
S0115	like like a like a pixie or something
S0037	yeah but um
S0115	yeah
S0037	but the problem be like i like cos i like knit on these needle these don't like when you when your knit needle i'll have like um an end on them like normal knit needle they tell you what size they be so like can see the needle in the jar like in the jar
S0115	uh yeah i can see some one with ones with a point and i can see some ones with obviously the flat bite at the end oh yeah and i see that one there be uh be double point at both end yeah
S0037	so like those ones so those ones tell you what size they be but these ones don't so i think you can get like er um
S0115	yeah yeah yes it's six six millimetres that one
S0037	so you can get like a gage but i haven't get one where you can put your needle in and it tell you what size you're knit on
S0115	that's the the diameter
S0037	but i haven't get one yet so i just try and find ones that look about right
S0115	yeah
S0037	like this one say use three and three quarter needle but i don't know what size that needle be i can't remember i've buy that many
S0115	well if this be six point six then so if this be six then that this one that one's probably like sort of half it's probably three isn't it
S0037	yeah i know but they go in like i i know but they go in like quarter like three and three and three quarter three and one quarter three and a half
S0115	oh you can't do the precise
S0037	it's like you can't tell anyway as a
S0115	you can actually but you'd have to get sort of measure it across with a
S0037	i need one of those what be they call me dad's get one like um
S0115	not not a not just a ruler a ruler wouldn't do it then
S0037	no it's like a pincer thing do you know what i mean
S0115	oh those things yeah
S0037	it's like for measure really small
S0115	but um you could sort of hold it above the ruler and look
S0037	um maybe
S0115	yeah
S0037	be pretty hard though
S0115	be a bite be a bite be a bite annoy
S0037	just to see like a quarter of a millimetre you know whatever it be
S0115	yeah you'd have to be very uh
S0037	three and a quarter millimetres versus three and a half anyway so
S0115	you'd have to hold it very yeah
S0037	and i just sort of tend to start and then just see like be it do it look right that's why the things always come out a tiny bite different to how they look in the picture
S0115	yeah and so you think that that one but
S0037	and i never buy the right wool like you're suppose to knit it in like really
S0115	yeah all different uh yeah
S0037	all different like thicknesses and stuff i just have what use what ever i've just whatever i've just get hang around
S0115	you so that's uh that's a baby's hat be it
S0037	so i be think about knit a little hat so i've do booties and a jumper
S0115	um yeah so you've do a you've do a hoodie
S0037	yeah and booties
S0115	you've do boot and you've get a hat
S0037	but there's load of really lovely pattern like hang on where's that one
S0115	then you need some trousers
S0037	there's a there's a really nice like like there's not that much stuff for little little baby so i might have to start knit bigger things but there's stuff where it's like um really nice but it's quite girly like them for example they're really pretty but
S0115	yeah
S0037	like if it's a boy they're not gonna like and like that as well like that's a lovely little cardigan can
S0115	yeah
S0037	but like you know what i mean
S0115	there's a pink uh
S0037	can you see like the detail it's all pink and like ribbons and like lacey bits like
S0115	yeah that's get a lot of lot of bits hasn't it
S0037	if it's a little boy he's not gonna be not gonna be dress him in that be they
S0115	um no they wouldn't unless unless they be short of
S0037	so i'm just stick to like bright colour for now anyway
S0115	unless they be short of clothe
S0037	well yeah but
S0037	and that's so like that's another thing i'm just knit in like bright colour or white really so it's um
S0115	yeah yeah
S0037	but it's alright but some of
S0115	work with both doesn't it yeah
S0037	there's some really good stuff like i look at some like websites and there's like um there's ones where it's like um like goth knit and like um really sort of weird uh like um how can i say like alternative baby knit like jumpers with spiders knit on the front and like
S0115	oh right
S0037	punk like little so like you know those little booties that i knit
S0115	yeah
S0037	i saw a pattern for like doctor marten like knit little
S0115	yeah like doctor marten imitation ones
S0037	so if you have like a punk baby yeah like punk baby i suppose
S0115	yeah yeah um
S0037	that would be pretty cool
S0115	so it's uh pretty popular then be be the knit uh for baby i mean do do do all baby have uh stuff knit for them what what happen if
S0037	i think i don't know about i dunno i'm not sure
S0115	yeah there's no one knit anything
S0037	i mean like my family knit a lot like that's why i knit
S0115	yeah
S0037	but i don't know about other people
S0115	cos it's popular
S0037	i mean some people think it's chavvy like i be tell you like
S0115	yeah
S0037	some people don't want knit fancy baby knit things cos they think it make their baby look like a baby chav
S0115	but but i would've think that that
S0037	like those lazy sock as well do you know those
S0115	wouldn't wouldn't a sort of peasant baby be less likely to have uh like clothe that its family have make i mean
S0037	i dunno but maybe it's just at home like maybe it's just like in sunderland like some of the baby like you know you see tiny baby with ears pierce for example or like um
S0115	alright
S0037	those sock on you know those sock those really frilly sock with load of lace
S0115	um
S0037	like that be really chavvy or like
S0115	really
S0037	yeah i mean just a bite over the top so and i sort of see the point like it can look a bite like rough but
S0115	uh no i don't think that knit clothe look in the slightest bite um either poor or garishly uh
S0037	maybe you need to if you saw them in the context no i don't think so either
S0115	or sort of uh um urban slum dwell baby i don't think to me uh knit doesn't look uh chavvy at all so
S0037	no well i don't think so but i think it depend
S0115	yeah
S0037	i think like anything could look chavvy though couldn't it really
S0115	not things that be sort of frumpy uh so much
S0037	well i don't know
S0115	not so it i mean it suppose it if you're if you're talk about poor
S0037	do you think boys wear
S0115	if you're talk chavvy be it talk chavvy mean poor or if you're talk chavvy mean um uh garish sort of wealthy but ignorant sort of different sense of the word
S0037	do you think boys wear hat i mean boys wear hat do you think boys wear purple i mean i like it but do you think there would
S0115	um it depend doesn't it i mean why because
S0037	do you think it's suitably like unisex
S0115	cos well the baby wear everything don't they cos they just get they just wear what they're give don't they
S0037	yeah i know but
S0115	i mean i mean they people aren't always that choosy about what they put on a baby be they or be or some of them might be i mean
S0037	i don't know be it not because like sometimes when baby be first bear they just look like like you can't tell what sex they be so like their mams and dads dress them in like blue so it doesn't go isn't he lovely and then they have to go it's a girl so
S0115	yeah well i think
S0037	but someone be tell me don't know if this be right but in the victorian time they be the other way around like boys wear pink
S0115	oh yeah be that sort of something like i think it be qi be it or be it
S0037	be it you tell me that
S0115	uh where they say that yeah it use to be men uh boy uh they consider pink more masculine perhaps cos it be red i don't know
S0037	yeah
S0115	and then blue uh more feminine in uh victorian time accord to think it be qi
S0037	uh huh
S0115	um which be surprise for a lot of people now that's the thing about qi it give you things that it sort of like to go against your expectations doesn't it
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh urban myths or uh commonly hold misconceptions or whatever that um that uh that's the point of qi but uh
S0037	it'd be good to be a researcher wouldn't it
S0115	yeah i mean i i don't really understand how they why they always have fix colour for for different you know things but
S0037	no
S0115	i i think everyone should wear every colour but that's just that's just me um
S0037	yeah but i mean
S0115	there's a lot of there's a lot of crazy possibilities i suppose you don't wanna be too too bright brightly colour
S0037	i like the brightly colour things like the jazzy stuff but i mean i don't know if i suppose baby just be sick and do poos all the time i mean i suppose i suppose people don't they'll just need lot of stuff won't they
S0115	yeah i guess they um they have load and load of they have multiple change per day
S0037	yeah
S0115	so um it's not like a sort of older um child maybe or not a teenager where they would only need like one thing to wear or uh plus plus the school school uniform and
S0037	i don't know everyone like a bite costume change lady gaga style
S0115	yeah i don't know much about lady gaga really
S0037	i don't
S0115	like she wear meat meat one time didn't she
S0037	just that she's weird meat dress
S0115	uh very strange sort of haircuts and things um
S0037	i think like
S0115	really sort of attention seek extremely
S0037	well she's obviously like get it right though she must've make a like a million billion pound
S0115	well it's a good sort of she sort of blend of uh madonna type image with um
S0037	oh there's definitely a lot of madonna in there you know
S0115	with a sort of marylin manson type image or something
S0037	oh yeah
S0115	or something strange uh that i don't really
S0037	i don't really follow her i don't really know i've only see her like on
S0115	don't understand that but yeah
S0037	if she's be on like jonathan ross or something

S0037	yeah he be really good he be the best i like him better than noel field i think like i wonder what's happen to him
S0115	they they definitely have a good they get they have a good sort of dynamic together that um obviously that that give them a sort of distinctive sort of style
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh but but also the one they have others there um cos in the mighty boosh they get there's sort of five of them aren't there i mean there's there's the brother there's also the

S0037	i suppose we'll have to see like this new one and see how much music's in it and stuff and like if it's all just like spangly one piece and like cake and that
S0115	yeah well there's definitely i've see clip and it's definitely get the the trademark um noel field strange costume strange makeup

S0115	some of the strange voice that he do the sort of uh strange scenes the surreal
S0037	yeah
S0115	events um surreal character
S0037	they have some good character like do you remember that one that be just a head and he be like
S0115	just a hedge

S0115	the brother uh noel fielding's brother be be a wizard or something call naboo or something
S0037	that's right yeah
S0115	and uh
S0037	do you think they'll make another series of that
S0115	um i'm not sure uh but i suppose julian
S0037	cos they do like a stage show
S0115	julian barratt's um julian barratt's obviously busy with something else maybe maybe he's get a family or something or he's just bore of uh just bore of noel field i don't know
S0037	uh they've get like a they have like a stage show didn't they they do it live
S0115	yeah that be that be really good um we have that dvd but it disappear uh
S0037	i wonder where it's go
S0115	um it's it's in it's in somewhere
S0037	uh huh think we know where
S0115	i don't know if you know
S0037	it's probably lose forever now
S0115	it's just misplace or
S0037	i'm not sure
S0115	i would've
S0037	i've get the box i find the box at christmas that wasn't even mine you know that be
S0115	we we always have we always have the box but it's just that we
S0037	that belong to that wasn't even mine
S0115	i think that that that the we get the cd b but we lose cd a i think cd a or dvd a uh be in your parents' house
S0037	maybe it be
S0115	um cos that's where the box be but then there sort of
S0037	i know but
S0115	there be a chance that it might've get lend to your brother
S0037	i don't know
S0115	but i don't know if it be ever take out of your parents' house so it should it should possibly be
S0037	yeah
S0115	in in um your parents' house but
S0037	oh i don't know
S0115	but but if we do get that that be that be a good video but uh i guess we'll get get that again actually
S0037	could probably download it from somewhere
S0115	um could get a copy of it of that there they the the live show be in some ways even better than the uh the series or something
S0037	the film one
S0115	yeah i think
S0037	although i like i like like tundra and um there be some really good episodes like that wild west one do you remember that one
S0115	yeah i think there be there be a beta max and that yeah
S0037	beta max
S0115	um yeah yeah some of the episodes be very good uh uh i think there be what be it there be the first series in a zoo and then there be a second series um they're sort of in a house and then there's
S0037	oh yeah where they they have like the emporium
S0115	the third series they have a shop uh the third i didn't like the third series as much but um
S0037	where be the second series
S0115	in a in a in their house in a flat
S0037	oh yeah yeah they have like a that's right
S0115	uh where they live with uh you know noel and julian live with the gorilla and the uh
S0037	his brother
S0115	brother and and they uh they just go on adventure um from that
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh
S0037	i'd totally forget about that until the other day that i have even have that cd i mean
S0115	yeah so i think the second one actually have the best uh my my favourite episodes i think then the second one
S0037	yeah
S0115	but yeah there be tundra i think be that the one with the sort of yeti things um
S0037	oh yeah and they like be that no that's a different one
S0115	and then there's
S0037	they sort of i'm terrible at remember episodes like they all kind of blur
S0115	some of them and then often they're good at good at music i think the most maybe maybe one of the most famous ones be the one with um with sort of they go out on to the lake and
S0037	oh black lake
S0115	and then they uh
S0037	when he's like have you ever drink baileys from a shoe
S0115	and they they go down the sort of they go fish in the lake in the middle of the night and the
S0115	there's a lot they be talk in a in a in a little inn with load of sort of drunken locals or something
S0037	the fishermen
S0115	yeah and then then they go out onto the lake to look for the um big black monster or something this big
S0115	yeah
S0115	sea that live under the uh sorry monster that live under the sea and then they uh they go out and they they sort of get catch don't they and then they get you
S0115	he get drag to its lair
S0037	and then she fall in love
S0115	what be the name of the i don't know
S0037	fall in love with
S0115	it fall in love with noel or the other way round
S0037	no no no the uh the other one
S0115	it fall in love with with uh julian
S0037	yeah
S0115	his name be what be their name uh vince noir and uh
S0037	oh yeah
S0115	he his julian's name be vince noir and then um
S0037	i don't know i haven't see it for so long
S0115	um so they they get drag to the yeah he have to get rescue uh um but that that do the that have that song um very famous song uh sort of about love game i think there's a song there's a song call love game
S0037	oh yeah
S0115	that's probably the best song that that they've
S0037	uh oh i forget about that
S0115	uh that that they do from that cos they they have a song in every episode but it be a good idea um uh
S0037	yeah there be a few i
S0115	but i like like that be one of my favourite comedy program and also i like peep show as well
S0037	yeah
S0115	but uh
S0037	do you think they'll do another series of that
S0115	yeah so peep show's be peep show's do about six or seven series or something like that
S0037	i know but do you think like be it finish now
S0115	what
S0037	like sorry be it finish though
S0115	peep show peep show
S0037	or do you think they'll like
S0115	peep show will probably probably keep go for a probably keep go for a few more wouldn't wouldn't it or
S0037	don't know
S0115	wouldn't they sort of cos i i imagine that um uh what's the name now can't remember uh mitchell and webb i imagine mitchell and webb have get a lot of spare sort of they would be eager to do it
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh they they they do
S0037	although he's in everything now isn't he that david mitchell
S0115	they've do
S0037	in fact when do that thing start
S0115	yeah but he's he's prolific isn't he i mean david mitchell
S0037	when do that new you know with lauren laverne when do that start again
S0115	he he he'd definitely he'd definitely say yes i think he just want to keep do stuff think he's uh
S0037	be he really go out with victoria coren
S0115	well that's just a a rumour isn't or or or be it not a rumour
S0037	be that a rumour
S0115	but well i no i think it be really really plausible because i think the two of them be so similar like to the point of
S0037	do you read that yeah
S0115	they almost like she's like the female version of him in some ways
S0037	well he's a bite funny like i mean he's not my cup of tea i like him but
S0115	he's a bite funny or you mean ha ha funny or
S0037	no not ha ha funny
S0115	or ooh funny
S0037	like ugh like he's a bite sort of like swotty and like smart arsey isn't he
S0115	yeah
S0037	like he would get on you nerve if you be like ooh do you want some
S0115	i dunno but he he uh isn't he more he's more in barrister territory he's more like clive anderson
S0037	but do you not think
S0115	an authoritative barrister
S0037	yeah but that's not what you want when you're like have a cup of tea and just like
S0037	you don't you don't want clive anderson
S0115	after a hard day at work come home and you'd be like ooh i'm really tire and he'd be like well actually you know like you don't want someone i mean maybe he's not like that maybe that's just his stage persona
S0115	ah well i think he do that you know for the for for a joke but i don't think he'd actually be do that
S0037	might be though
S0115	i think he perform really it's like a barrister i mean they they do they do the be a barrister wouldn't have to be a barrister but uh i suppose they're not always in that sort of defend the the client mode that or prosecution mode or like cross question
S0037	yeah
S0115	cross whatever the word be socratically cross question them
S0037	yeah yeah uh examine cross examine them
S0115	yeah cross uh yeah different word there um i don't know what socratic cross cross question mean
S0037	what
S0115	socratic cross question
S0037	what do that mean
S0115	i don't know i just i didn't know i just say it uh
S0037	oh have you just make that up
S0115	no uh i remember boris johnson say it say it once i think it's
S0037	oh well he probably just make it up then good old boris
S0115	uh it's just it's something it's the sort of expression you'd know if you if you've come go to the kind of school that boris johnson go to i'd imagine
S0037	yeah well
S0115	uh
S0037	do boris johnson go to eton then
S0115	um i think so cos there be a programme about him with at the bullingdon club wasn't there with um
S0037	so you can only be in the bullingdon club if you go to eton then
S0115	um actually that be at that be set at oxford wasn't it
S0037	no but i mean like you obviously have to
S0115	be the bullingdon club locate in where be it
S0037	it's at the university yeah but you must've have to have some pedigree to go to get in i don't think they just let like plebs in
S0115	in oxford exclusive bullingdon club so no i don't know for certain that um johnson be at eton he he may have be at one of the other ones but uh oh yeah i be say sorry cross question um and i be talk about uh uh like david mitchell be like a typical barrister and uh i suppose that
S0037	yeah
S0115	a lot of them those sort of comedians that actually may've be barristers if it wasn't for the opportunities these days there's a big market for comedians stand up comedians
S0037	yeah
S0115	um and general uh panel monkey or whatever the
S0037	tomfoolery
S0115	panel people people that go around do the panel
S0037	there's so many of them panely game on
S0115	many many ones i mean and you use to just have like you know in the eighties well it it be just have i get news for you
S0037	yeah i still like that though i still don't
S0115	then then there be shoot star
S0037	yeah
S0115	in the mid nineties
S0037	but they scrap that that's shock isn't it
S0115	well it have be go for a long time but uh
S0037	yeah but it be good like
S0115	i think no it have
S0037	think it be just the same stuff
S0115	it have do it have do enough of it like i'd rather see more from reeve and mortimer i'd rather see them do do something
S0037	like do sketch show or something or
S0115	well they've do a few different sketch show i mean my favourite thing that they ever do be the smell of reeve and mortimer
S0037	yeah yeah
S0115	uh the smell they start off with the the sort of stage show um vic reeve's big night out that be a long time ago
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh
S0037	me dad me dad really like that sort of thing
S0115	then they do a few things like randall and hopkirk decease and
S0037	oh yeah
S0115	that that one that be kind of like phoenix nights but before phoenix nights
S0037	oh baron's baron's nightclub
S0115	uh so um they could've accuse peter kaye of copy that
S0037	yeah you can't you can't like accuse one of just copy a nightclub of have a the idea of have a rubbish nightclub like
S0115	i think it be the format of it be sort of um it be a something
S0037	or like mockumentary yeah
S0115	it's not a mockumentary it's a mockudrama or something like uh spoof
S0037	yeah
S0115	spoof comedy but stag as a drama so that sort of sort of a bite like no i don't know it it wasn't it be kind of like a sort of a comedy or i don't know the technical term for what that be i mean
S0037	yeah
S0115	cos that whatever what's alan partridge that's sort of mock something isn't it that's like a spoof
S0037	oh it's awful it's so cringey i still haven't like
S0115	spoof
S0037	get you know i watch it but i still find it really hard to watch like still think it's really sort of um really cringey and even worse than that like beyond beyond like alan partridge be like borat oh
S0115	well yeah borat take take that sort of cringe to the to the furthest i've ever see go as far as borat
S0037	oh it be so bad
S0115	um but my favourite's probably alan partridge i think it's just it's just sort of um some of the scenes in it be just sort of the effortlessness of uh coogan to play such a unpleasant person but the in in a very effortless
S0037	think i've make a
S0115	have you make a mistake with your knit then
S0037	i think so i'm i'm suppose to be do two knit and but the but the like but it's ask
S0115	so be it hard to talk and knit at the same time
S0037	no not not really i'm just uh
S0115	because but you start it so you're do a technical procedure aren't you
S0037	i i just i just no i just knit two together there at the start like i just a few a few stitch ago
S0115	yeah so it's it's not a serious mistake then
S0037	no a few stitch ago i think like oh be they two stitch be they one and i just knit them together and think muh but that be the wrong thing i should've just check so more fool me really but the i'm only on like the first tiny bite so it's always hard start like at the start it normally just look like a lot of knot and then eventually out of the knot sort of come something that look a bite less like just knot
S0115	yeah
S0037	but you know it's alright sorry
S0115	accident yeah but so
S0037	sorry please carry on
S0115	so what you get cool knit for kid what be that but um
S0037	yeah
S0115	yeah so we be uh what be i say i be talk about we be talk about borat or something
S0037	you be say that alan partridge be your favourite and i say that i hat borat
S0115	well that's my that's that's my favourite of of the cringe of the cringe comedies that we've have a lot of recently or
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh but also the
S0037	oh it be so bad i honestly think like i would've just if i hadn't be there with you i think i would've just leave the cinema
S0115	for borat some of it's hard some of it's really i think it be really good but i think it go too far
S0037	about that bite when he like
S0115	i think it do go uh most people would probably say it it go too far in in place but some of it be stag wasn't it so
S0037	i think because it yeah some of it be but some of it wasn't and some of it be just like real people
S0115	you know yeah well he get people sack didn't he i mean
S0037	like people prosecute him and
S0115	yeah he
S0037	all kinds of things
S0115	there be there be people get sack for for have him um
S0037	yeah
S0115	uh for have him do i i could talk about comedy for uh a long time though
