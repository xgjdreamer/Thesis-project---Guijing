S0084	it's just silly isn't it you know
S0082	yeah um
S0084	you wouldn't do this time
S0082	i don't know what i could say really
S0084	yeah
S0082	um what it er strangely enough er what it need really um be somebody like er it's
S0084	mm
S0082	it's just unfortunate really now that 's step down from all er committee er responsibilities and he
S0084	yeah
S0082	he be the chairperson he be the treasurer for a while i take over from him as treasurer i think before i take over the publicity work he he he sort of keep an eye he didn't do it as such but he keep an eye on it
S0084	mm
S0082	um you know he be and er there's something call plan and countryside officer in other word you know if plan applications be make
S0084	mm
S0082	er and um particularly if they're out of town you know he he use to get involve in that to see whether there be any potential problems with footpaths and stuff
S0084	yeah
S0082	yeah you know he just use to do a huge er i just think he felt that you know he'd do everything he could and he need to step back from it all
S0084	yeah
S0082	when you come it hadn't turn itself on and it be just instead of twenty
S0084	it be just dip
S0082	it be nineteen point seven or something
S0082	it have just go below but it's kick er
S0084	yeah
S0082	it's kick in now
S0084	oh good
S0082	um
S0084	yeah it's feel warm
S0082	so he'd be the ideal person but of course he's not on the committee and i don't really
S0084	mm
S0082	feel i should give um this woman his number cos you know he he's tricky
S0084	she'll be forever call him
S0082	well he's another one who do a lot of voluntary work
S0084	mm
S0082	he do hospital run
S0084	oh right
S0082	and i mean he he's over seventy now but he take um older people or you know people who be less mobile than he be
S0084	mm
S0082	um to 's you know this this there's a
S0084	oh
S0082	scheme that er
S0084	what in his own car
S0082	yeah i mean there's a scheme i don't i think he get his expense in other word he get his petrol refund you
S0084	mhm
S0082	you know as expense but he you know physically put himself out
S0084	yeah
S0082	to take people um and doesn't earn anything from it just get his expense pay um and so he do that and he do lot of other things you know he he do lead a few walk but the shorter ones
S0084	mm
S0082	and um er i er you know he he would've be an ideal person cos
S0084	mm
S0082	it's not that doesn't know a lot about the countryside round here cos she's live in this area longer than have you know she move here in the nineteen sixties i think
S0084	mhm
S0082	but um have just spend a lot of time you know sort of er involve in er all sort of things and also 's on the area he's the area secretary and you've get you've get the group you've get all you know
S0084	mm
S0082	group south group east
S0084	mm
S0082	you've get group um er all these group report into an area
S0084	yeah
S0082	which be call well it's actually call and but it's basically so it's all the group in
S0084	mm
S0082	so he's stop be er on the committee of our group which be group
S0084	right
S0082	but he's on the committee of the er area group which be call and he's the secretary so so um i um you know i i believe he er would be the right person but i mean
S0084	yeah
S0082	might want to do it herself or she might suggest somebody else
S0084	yeah
S0082	the er the person who could do it very well be somebody call
S0084	mm
S0082	who use to work on the county council she be very senior
S0084	oh right
S0082	on the county council but um when she retire she's just i think she's just about sixty now when she retire you know a lot of the council work be farm out to um what do they call them um
S0082	yeah okay
S0084	alright
S0082	you alright yeah
S0084	see you in a bite
S0082	um and they er outsource you know when they
S0084	oh right
S0082	you know councils outsource so much work these days
S0084	mm
S0082	and when er and obviously she must've be involve in outsource when she be a member of the council because when um she get to retirement the one of the outsource company
S0084	mm
S0082	er presumably know her know about her offer her a job offer her basic er basically as far as i'm aware offer her her old job in other word she use to work for the council do these various things
S0084	mm
S0082	which be outsource because she be retire
S0084	mm
S0082	so the company to whom it be outsource get in touch with her and say would you be prepare to do your job but for us
S0084	oh
S0082	and that's what she's do and er i think she's probably earn a hell of a lot more money
S0084	nice
S0082	do it um
S0084	yeah
S0082	um so therefore she's another one she she's like very very knowledgeable you know be involve in all sort of um um matter with the because she be on the council she's a you know she's a member of she's also a member of something call cos there's a there's an in there's lot of ramble group in but the one that um you know people of my generation and older er er think about in addition to be which be a an independent
S0084	mm
S0082	one er she's president of that she's secretary of our group she use to be the secretary of area but she resign cos she just have too much to do
S0084	mm
S0082	and take that over um
S0084	oh right
S0082	so or would be good but for the reason i say i don't think either of them will be available tomorrow cos
S0084	yeah
S0082	will be work and i'm sure will be do his hospital run or something else
S0084	mm
S0082	you know
S0084	mm
S0082	and in fact i'm see him after wednesday cos we're go on a a reccy
S0084	you and
S0082	yeah
S0084	oh that'll be nice
S0082	he's do a walk er in about er monday morning walk you know sort of short walk
S0084	mhm
S0082	um so he's do that um in a couple of weeks time
S0084	mm
S0082	so um yeah it er yeah so i i have the my er sort of day in yesterday it be okay
S0084	and it go okay
S0082	yeah we
S0084	you get there alright
S0082	we hire a little i didn't know cos i don't i only know about the people who i er meet in the group i go to
S0084	mm
S0082	but there's a woman call she's describe as a pastoral assistant
S0084	oh right
S0082	which mean she actually work for the
S0084	mhm
S0082	and she get pay for what she do
S0084	oh right
S0082	um and in addition and she's a member of our group she's you know a helper like me so she's and she do that in her spare time like the rest of us do
S0084	mm
S0082	doesn't get pay for that but um in addition to that if people don't come to our group for whatever reason
S0084	mm
S0082	or they're young people you know they might be um sort of um er people in their teens
S0084	yeah
S0082	um they go to her
S0084	mm
S0082	so when i cycle over expect to be give a lift as i be last year cos you know er who run it all
S0084	mm
S0082	she you know if she want me to you know bring my car she ask me to do that but she didn't but she say could i come cos there be one of the um people er that i be in our group call who's um find out about the he need a sponsor
S0084	oh right
S0082	um and she like to match you know men with men and women with women sort of thing um so i say fine yeah i'm quite happy i and in the past when that's happen and she hasn't ask me to bring my car cos there's enough
S0084	mm
S0082	and she's always drive her own so i just assume we be go in her car
S0084	mm
S0082	but um when i get there they hire a coach have hire a coach
S0084	oh that's a good idea of do it
S0082	well
S0084	so who drive then
S0082	um well they
S0084	they get a driver or
S0082	yeah they hire it with the driver um
S0084	mm
S0082	um because in addition to the sort of i mean there's in term of the um helpers there's and me
S0084	mm
S0082	be the the other person
S0084	mm
S0082	but she couldn't go she she's full she's still full time teacher er
S0084	oh right
S0082	at school
S0084	oh yeah
S0082	so there's four of us er helpers um five er people er from our group go um but the ones that have be help along bring their families so there be sort of teenagers
S0084	oh
S0082	um with their families and who else be there oh yeah there's a woman er i would say in her forties who doesn't like group prefer to do it one to one
S0084	oh right
S0082	she's a bite intimidate by group which be which be fine you know
S0084	mm
S0082	i don't like group either but
S0084	no
S0082	um so she come along and who else there be somebody else come along as well
S0084	oh yeah um yeah and there be two um er sponsor for one of the women that come to our group um she well in fact i think there be one sponsor but i can't i don't know whether the just try to remember who it be now the thing be they both go what happen be the service be basically to show um er people think about the church what it's like as a diocese cos all they've see so far be a small group of people
S0082	mm
S0084	in their area
S0084	mm
S0082	in their parish church
S0084	yeah
S0082	you know be a fairly big parish but i mean some of them be very small parishes
S0084	mm
S0082	so it's to give them an idea of what happen in the diocese so er and there be two type of person er who be um er or the church divide them into two type there be lot of type but the church divide them into two type
S0084	mm
S0082	of person who be seek you know information about the church there's those that have be baptize in another christian church like me
S0084	mhm
S0082	as i be er when i um be receive and there be those who be not baptize
S0084	mhm
S0082	and the ones who be not baptize be call catechumens
S0084	mm
S0082	that's an old sort of technical word
S0084	mm
S0082	and the ones that already be baptize er be call candidates
S0084	mm okay
S0082	male or female um and what happen be that the two group separately go and meet what in the past would have be the bishop but but because the bishop die
S0084	mm
S0082	his deputy er er on official on the official level
S0084	mhm
S0082	you know on a sort of civic and pageantry level um er be it's quite strange actually his his office be call vicar general um but it's only he's only call vicar general when the bishop's alive so when the bishop can't go to something
S0084	right
S0082	he send the vicar general
S0084	he nominate him
S0082	okay but if a if a bishop die or for some reason can't continue
S0084	mhm
S0082	you know step down or whatever then the vicar general become the administrator i'm not sure why
S0084	so he's now an administrator
S0082	yeah
S0084	why vicar cos
S0082	anyway his
S0084	isn't vicar an anglican term
S0082	er
S0084	it's not a catholic term
S0082	yeah well i i think i think you they er i think it's interchangeable now i think
S0084	oh right
S0082	i think it be er most people think of vicars as er the um yeah the church of england rather than the
S0084	mm
S0082	catholic church you're right but this title of vicar general have pop up from somewhere i don't know where
S0084	mm
S0082	um
S0084	okay so he's the administrator
S0082	so um
S0084	so who be he sort of
S0082	so he
S0084	take the mass then
S0082	yeah and the reason i mention all that be
S0084	celebrate the mass
S0082	well it's the service rather than a mass there's no communion it's just a
S0084	oh right
S0082	church i mean there be hymn there be prayers
S0084	mm
S0082	and there's liturgy but there's no communion so it's not a mass
S0084	oh okay
S0082	um and um this particular guy the administrator his name's er he both work you know as a as a priest in
S0084	mm
S0082	at and i think he be ordain there as well i think he say that
S0084	oh okay
S0082	um but er the two er people that come with the woman who's think about join the church er when it come to go up er to see um they both go up so i'm i'm i'm not sure who's sponsor him
S0084	mm
S0082	anyway er sorry not sponsor him sponsor her um but the person i be er sponsor in fact i'm technically a godparent because isn't baptize so i go up with the first group with
S0084	mhm
S0082	and the catechumens er who be if he decide to er be receive at
S0084	mhm
S0082	easter
S0084	mm
S0082	he have the three sacraments baptism confirmation and eucharist
S0084	mhm
S0082	whereas the remainder have um er confirmation and eucharist
S0084	mhm
S0082	and sometimes in fact i think we've get one this year we've get a lapse catholic who you know have be er away if you like from
S0084	mm
S0082	um er er sacraments and things like that of the church for a long time and she um she in fact strangely enough she come on sunday but she didn't fall into either of those group because she's she's baptize and she be confirm
S0084	mhm
S0082	um and in the past when she be practise so to speak
S0084	yeah
S0082	she be receive er the eucharist
S0084	mm
S0082	um but they do er they say special prayers for her at um at the easter vigil
S0084	oh that's interest
S0082	so this year we'll have at least one person er who be um to be baptize
S0084	mm
S0082	in fact some of the i think one of the teenagers be a catechumen as well so we might have two
S0084	mm
S0082	to be baptize we'll certainly have three or four who be receive er confirmation er and um the eucharist
S0084	mm
S0082	and this woman who will um because she's receive that already don't you know the the baptism and confirmation only happen once mm
S0084	yeah absolutely do do you notice that when she come back she have a lot of question be that why she'd go back through
S0082	well strangely not
S0084	rather than just start up again
S0082	she seem quite well sort of inform really
S0084	oh
S0082	she's a nurse and
S0084	okay
S0082	she's a um i think she's a nurse i can't remember be she a nurse tut i can't remember things these days she's either a nurse in um a hospice
S0084	mhm
S0082	or she's a nurse in a er of for people who be mentally um disable in some way
S0084	mm
S0082	mentally impair in some way you know it's quite a tough she's get a really tough job um and i think the other thing be i think she want to join she's not marry i would say she's in her early forties as well she's another one
S0084	mm
S0082	um not she's not the one who doesn't like come in group
S0084	yeah
S0082	um um i don't er she she's the one who the one who doesn't like group be baptize but she
S0084	right
S0082	she's gonna get the other two
S0084	mm
S0082	this one be baptize and confirm in the catholic faith
S0084	mhm
S0082	and she just sort of a refresher really
S0084	mm
S0082	but she um she i mean she do ask a lot of question but she also know a lot you know she talk about things in a
S0084	yeah well she learn it once i suppose
S0082	yeah yeah
S0084	it's just i wonder if she have like a crisis of faith or
S0082	maybe
S0084	life get in the way or
S0082	i mean like people people leave the church for all sort of reason don't they
S0084	mm
S0082	but um
S0084	it's just interest if you be
S0082	yeah
S0084	to come back you know why would you go through
S0082	mm
S0084	the class if you
S0082	yeah
S0084	you know if you weren't sure i suppose
S0082	yeah it's very anyway
S0082	so we've get a bite of a er well we always have a
S0084	you've get a real mix bunch
S0082	mix bunch really i mean every year er er you know cos it's people from all sort of different background
S0084	yeah
S0082	i mean there be some that couldn't go um there's a chap who's on er on holiday it's often to do you know the people we see be often er come because of a relationship you know either they've marry a catholic and and they didn't wanna make a change when they get marry
S0084	mm
S0082	but after be marry for a while you know like me er they decide they would um or they're in a relationship lead to marriage we've get a couple er like that there's a hungarian guy and a um er an asian er woman who be get marry fairly soon and and er
S0084	mm
S0082	the they want so the they they've come to our group but they're also talk to one of the younger there's a younger priest who's a benedictine
S0084	oh yeah
S0082	er no he's actually not a benedictine what be i talk about
S0084	oh
S0082	his name's father
S0084	uh huh
S0082	but he's a dominican you know the ones with the black and white
S0084	mm
S0082	stuff
S0084	mm
S0082	um er road you know they've get the priory there haven't they or whatever they call it
S0084	oh and he he live there
S0082	yeah
S0084	do they not have a church there
S0082	well i think what it be they do but i think he's on loan because
S0084	he's on loan
S0082	in the sense that um we've get
S0084	you're down a priest
S0082	one full time priest
S0084	mm
S0082	well i don't think we're down a priest er
S0084	well who take over from father
S0082	er
S0084	um
S0082	er father
S0084	father
S0082	yeah
S0084	that's it
S0082	um but the the two who be full time with us cos we often have visit priests who be
S0084	mm
S0082	study in the university and they and they stay in the rectory and and they celebrate mass and things like that
S0084	oh okay
S0082	but they're only here whilst they're study
S0084	yeah
S0082	um but the two who be full time one father from the moment he arrive er i dunno about five years ago er he er should've be retire um
S0082	so i mean i dunno whether you've whether you can actually fully retire as a priest or not i don't i don't i suppose you can when you're really old
S0084	mm
S0082	um but he do a few things um and the other full time when father be here there be two full time priests in addition to father father who's be replace by father
S0084	mhm
S0082	and father
S0084	mm
S0082	now father be i don't know get on for seventy i would've think
S0084	be he
S0082	and he's have some he have a really strange well not strange really unpleasant thing he um he have i don't know how he manage to do it but he um he get gangrene in one of his feet
S0084	tut ff
S0082	and they have to cut away quite a lot of his foot
S0084	huh
S0082	he he wear a special sort of shoe now that's sort of build up so that
S0084	oh
S0082	er i wonder how he manage to do that
S0084	have he be on a pilgrimage somewhere
S0082	well er whether er whether
S0084	somewhere
S0082	that or he have bad circulation and you know it be much worse than he think i i dunno i dunno i dunno how he
S0084	how do you get in the in the western world how do you get
S0082	i dunno how he i dunno how you get that
S0084	gangrene
S0082	yeah i dunno but he do and he and er for a while er he didn't do anything at all you know he be rest up then when he celebrate mass he sit down the whole time
S0084	mm
S0082	he couldn't he couldn't stand and er and do the things that priests do when they stand up
S0084	mm
S0082	um and now he um he's back to you know celebrate mass in a in a in the normal way
S0084	mm
S0082	but i imagine he probably have to cut back on a lot of things
S0084	yeah
S0082	so we have this um father who just to make make things confuse be a be a dominican
S0084	oh right
S0082	his name's er
S0082	not a benedictine
S0082	um and er he's show as a resident priest but he's certainly associate with the dominicans in er er road
S0084	ah
S0082	mm
S0084	so um so what kind of font do have
S0082	um it's
S0084	be it a small one like the stand that they have at st
S0082	yeah
S0084	be it in the traditional sort of base and stand rather than like a hole in the grind
S0082	yeah it's it's basic i mean basically they don't they they what they tend to do be make it up on the sanctuary you know
S0084	oh right
S0082	so it's so that er they can tip water in it
S0084	mm
S0082	in front of everybody they they don't have one that they sort of wheel out anywhere
S0084	oh okay
S0082	um and but for children i think there be one and i think it's at the back of the church i think it's um as you come in you know when you come in er if you go on the side aisle the leave
S0084	mm
S0082	side aisle
S0084	mm
S0082	i think it's the first open
S0084	oh okay
S0082	it's the there's often a screen up
S0084	yeah
S0082	um but i think if you look beyond the screen you can see um the font in there and that's for baby but for adults they tend to um um because it's you know it's easter
S0084	mm
S0082	er vigil be a big thing they do it all at the front by the altar
S0084	oh right
S0082	um cos if they do it tuck away in a little in a little you know cubicle
S0084	mm
S0082	it wouldn't have the same effect really
S0084	yeah
S0082	cos it be a it be a community you know parish community thing
S0084	mm
S0082	you know you want everybody at at mass to see what's go on
S0084	yeah yeah it's introduce everybody to the new
S0082	yeah people
S0084	member of the parish
S0082	who be be receive into the church
S0084	yeah
S0082	you know whether they're be baptize or um confirmation um and er eucharist only whether you know in other word whether they're get three sacraments or two
S0084	mm
S0082	or or one or none
S0084	mm
S0082	you know er depend on their circumstances um you know it's good that um community see what's go on
S0084	yeah absolutely
S0082	so yeah so that'll be easter i mean easter's not that far away i mean the first sunday in lend um it's quite interest because i miss the for the i mean i can't remember the last time i go to an area agm for and i miss it this year because it be yesterday
S0084	oh
S0082	er initially um who i mention to
S0084	mm
S0082	the woman on the phone who's our chairperson say to me be i go this year cos she'd mention last year that i should've go
S0084	mm
S0082	and i say oh er think it be a saturday i say oh yeah i'm sure i can cos i haven't be walk much on er saturdays
S0084	mm
S0082	and i think she be just tell me because er i haven't be turn up much on saturdays and i think well yeah saturday yeah sure i can fit it in so i say oh yeah i'll be go and then
S0082	which be rather strange cos although she one of 's other job be to coordinate all the walk
S0084	yeah
S0082	you know she produce she put them all together
S0084	mm
S0082	um obviously what she do be e mail them to me so i can put them on the website so in a way i should know when the walk be but er obviously you can't keep them all in your head
S0084	mm
S0082	um and i should know when the agm be um so have tell her i dunno a month ago that i'd be go i suddenly look good job i do really um

S0084	mm
S0082	be just be just bolt in
S0084	mm
S0082	to the um area report so there's nothing
S0084	oh fine so do you just stand there
S0082	um the only person that actually have to do something be cos she's chairperson

S0082	she have to go and you know talk about what the group's do and you know what
S0084	mm
S0082	we've be do and what our plan be for the future and that sort of stuff um
S0084	be this the first year she's take over from david
S0082	no
S0084	or second year
S0082	no she's she want to step down
S0084	oh yeah you do say that
S0082	yeah
S0084	yeah
S0082	no she's agree to stay on cos nobody want to do it
S0084	mm
S0082	cos in the past
S0084	it's a commitment
S0082	they they want me to do it and i say no i didn't you know i have enough to do with it
S0084	you'll you'll be the entire board
S0082	well um it be before i be treasurer it be when i be publicity officer
S0084	mhm
S0082	they want me to do it and i say no i'm i'm quite happy be publicity officer but i've be do that now i dunno five years possibly
S0084	yeah
S0082	um you know i i don't know how many years you're suppose to do these things i suppose
S0082	for as many years as you want to but
S0084	yeah
S0082	you know you just get a bite feed up with it after a while
S0084	well yeah especially
S0082	um
S0084	with the website you know have to maintain that
S0082	yeah
S0084	it's a bite of a hassle
S0082	and i've be i've be treasurer for two years now
S0084	mm
S0082	cos i've do two agms
S0084	mm
S0082	so i think you it'll get to the stage where i'll just get feed up with it and er you know i'll go on the odd walk but
S0084	mm
S0082	i'll get feed up with do it all so i'll just step down let's you know either it'll get do by somebody else or it won't get do cos the thing be er what they what they work on be the basis that people will keep on do the job
S0084	yeah
S0082	if nobody else can be find to replace them
S0084	mm
S0082	well you know if you don't mind do it or if you like do it that's fine
S0084	mhm
S0082	but if you want to step down um it's it's like a type of blackmail isn't it really
S0084	yeah
S0082	or sort of
S0084	they rely on your good nature
S0082	yeah so er at the moment i'm okay until somebody upset me
S0082	then i won't be okay
S0082	um um
S0084	it be a big commitment though for something
S0082	yeah but it's
S0084	that you're do in your spare time
S0082	but i can see that sort of two years down down the line
S0084	mm
S0082	i'll probably have have enough
S0084	yeah
S0082	of treasurer and publicity er and i won't wanna take on the chairman
S0084	no
S0082	but you know i i shall just step down from everything
S0084	but you're probably one of the younger older ones aren't you really
S0082	well um
S0084	so
S0082	we've get a younger guy and a younger woman um the younger woman have be involve with for years and years and years but she start off when she be you know in her teens or something you know i mean she
S0084	oh right
S0082	she move into the area
S0084	mm
S0082	and um she quickly get involve in stuff she's be involve for a long long time and she's er she's do all sort of things but now she just prepare the minutes of our meet
S0084	mm
S0082	um her name's and she live over the back here she live in um at the back
S0084	mm that's a nice name t
S0082	er or or somewhere yeah er she's yeah she's she work for um in fact she use to
S0084	mm
S0082	work in insurance she use to work for an an insurance company like me but um she give that up and
S0084	mm
S0082	and go to the
S0084	do they pay mm it's not voluntary service
S0082	well it's it's they don't charge people for their advice
S0084	mm
S0082	um but they do er have both they have volunteer and they have pay members of staff
S0084	i think they be all volunteer there
S0082	but usually the pay members of staff
S0084	a few
S0082	be only pay as part timers
S0084	mm
S0082	you know they don't what they try and do be get as many volunteer as they can cos obviously
S0084	mm
S0082	the government's always cut back you know cos it's an it's a national thing
S0084	yeah
S0082	it's a state thing
S0084	yeah
S0082	it's not
S0084	yeah they're public servants yeah
S0082	it's not private um so um to actually do what they need to do
S0084	mm
S0082	they rely quite a lot now on volunteer
S0084	mm
S0082	which mean that people like um be in a slightly dicey position because
S0084	mm
S0082	either they lose their job or you know if they be work full time they're suddenly tell they they're only gonna be pay for three days a week or something like that
S0084	yeah
S0082	you know i mean it's a bite it's a bite unpleasant i think at the moment um so that's what she do but she's be involve for a long time um and the guy who's a bite younger than he's er he's come up to retirement so he's not that much younger than me he's probably
S0084	mm
S0082	i dunno fifty eight fifty nine something like that um i don't know what he do um er don't know much about him but he he come on a few walk i dunno a couple of years ago
S0084	mm
S0082	and er and somebody i don't or somebody or or speak to him and say you know we've get a vacancy on the committee if you're interest

S0082	people build block of flats and things if there's a footpath through the land
S0084	mm
S0082	they're not always shall we say interest in footpaths they're more interest in build as much as they can and charge as much as they can get away with
S0084	profit
S0082	mm
S0084	yep
S0082	yeah so er
S0084	mm
S0082	well it's five o'clock so er i can
S0084	mm
S0082	i can start put the food on when you're ready
S0084	oo yum
S0082	um do you fancy eat fairly soon
S0082	okay
S0084	be you feel confident about your homemade sauce
S0082	well it's er you know um it's really to see what it taste like
S0084	yeah
S0082	cos and i have have a conversation like the um ready make sauce as i do
S0084	mm
S0082	in term of the flavour
S0084	yeah
S0082	but they're full of lump and full of onions and stuff that
S0084	salt
S0082	and stuff that um well i don't think salt's a problem for but full of onions and stuff you know
S0084	mm
S0082	chunk of tomato um
S0082	which doesn't like so what i've try to do be find a sauce with all the flavour and none of the lump but i can't do it you know i've try them all
S0082	i've go i've go right through the card at er tescos i've i've try um you know the um er all the famous er
S0084	mm
S0082	ones i can't remember the name now but all the famous ones you you see on the shelve i've try every one of them
S0084	yeah
S0082	er but they all have big lump in them
S0084	yeah well you're better off make your own really but um it's a shame that he didn't even like onions or anything i mean i know i use to pick out the onions
S0084	but when you're when they're all dice up really really small
S0082	well the trouble
S0084	that help add to the
S0082	the trouble be they're not
S0084	no but what i mean be when you
S0082	yeah
S0084	when you make it yourself
S0084	no
S0082	so what
S0084	onions add to the taste that's
S0084	why the passata's gonna taste bore
S0082	all i've um all i've get
S0082	all i've get
S0084	trust me
S0082	all i've get be um
S0084	you don't hate onions
S0082	yeah well hang on a minute
S0084	onions
S0082	all i all i've get be um be the passata and um
S0084	herbs
S0082	the herbs
S0084	yeah
S0082	so there won't be any onions or
S0084	but that's what help make the taste
S0082	well
S0084	onions make it taste nice
S0082	that's why i say will it it would be rather experimental
S0084	mhm
S0082	to see what it taste like it
S0084	yeah
S0082	it might taste okay it might taste awful but i shall have a go
S0084	cos you can also get powder garlic and things like that
S0082	yeah well it's
S0084	that would help
S0082	it's just doesn't like the taste of that so
S0084	you don't like garlic
S0084	you don't like garlic bread
S0084	it's it's garlic
S0084	yeah
S0084	that's mental
S0084	you understand what you're say be mental right
S0084	no it doesn't
S0082	yeah
S0084	yes it do
S0082	no i i i i have the
S0084	it's garlic
S0082	i have the same problem because when i be grow up we didn't have er the um you know organic and stuff like that
S0084	mm
S0082	you either go to the greengrocers and buy stuff and make it yourself or if you didn't have time as most people didn't then or and don't now
S0084	mm
S0082	you buy stuff in can and you know nanny er use to have the same conversation with er uncle gary and me that you two be just have
S0082	um but the subject matter be tomatoes
S0084	mm
S0082	she would do a salad and put tomatoes down and basically gary and i didn't eat any green stuff at all
S0082	um and she put tomatoes down and she say right and and ham and or something or cheese or something like that
S0084	mm
S0082	and uncle and i just use to say well we'll just have the ham well we'll just have the cheese and she say well you you must have some tomatoes and we'd say no i can't stand horrible taste
S0082	and she say well you eat tomato soup and we we sort of we think about that for a while and we say well it taste different we don't like the taste of tomatoes
S0084	mm
S0082	so it be the same conversation you two be just have
S0082	cos if you
S0082	in those days you didn't have all these versions of tomato soup
S0084	mm
S0082	that you can get now
S0084	mm
S0082	you can actually get tomato soup that taste like tomatoes now
S0084	yeah
S0082	but in those days all you have be heinz
S0084	and then that just taste of sugar
S0082	so it's lot of sugar
S0084	mm
S0082	so what we like
S0084	kid love it
S0082	be the sweet taste of heinz tomato soup and when we taste tomatoes they taste foul
S0084	yeah
S0082	and that's the that's the conversation you two be just
S0082	have that you know you you can actually um have things like garlic bread there's obviously there's some sort of garlic flavour in but it's
S0082	but it
S0082	yeah
S0084	but it's but it's lessen you would think that if you didn't like garlic you would you would be able to tolerate the tomato sauce because it be lessen but you would hate garlic bread but you're say that you like the strong taste of garlic but you don't like
S0084	it as part of something else in a sauce
S0084	that's mental
S0084	the thing be with the tomato soup be that aren't any more tomatoes
S0082	mm
S0084	yeah but you like the taste of the tomato sauce that you've be buy you just don't like the bits
S0084	it have it have it's get it's get onions
S0082	no i don't think i don't
S0084	it's get tomatoes
S0084	it's get garlic
S0084	it's get basil it's get
S0084	oregano
S0082	well if it have get if it have get
S0084	it's get bay leave
S0082	garlic it's only get a very small amount cos i couldn't taste it either
S0084	well the idea be you don't taste one thing over another
S0082	yeah yeah
S0082	no
S0082	and er
S0082	when we go to carluccio's and we have
S0082	garlic bread it wasn't the garlic that be
S0082	it wasn't the garlic
S0084	that be salt wasn't it
S0082	that be the problem well it be the garlic cos there be
S0082	they actually put
S0082	they actually put sliver of garlic on the on the top of the bread
S0084	oh do they
S0082	which which i'd never which i'd never see before
S0084	i've never eat raw garlic before
S0082	um well it be cook garlic but it be on the top of the bread um but
S0084	urgh
S0082	it be you know the hundredweight of salt they'd empty on top of it

S0082	as well you could feel your arteries collapse

S0082	one i'm lead
S0082	and so it's rather strange cos um i think there be a pub half way round i've put bring a pack lunch but i it look rather there's certainly a pub there but it look rather as if it's only open in the even it's rather
S0084	mm
S0082	unpleasant i'm gonna phone i've get the number oh it's in the room i've get the number i must give them a ring tomorrow

S0084	i don't know if it's me
S0082	i search high and low
S0084	mm
S0082	mm
S0082	then they change it
S0084	mm
S0082	to make the idea be that you'll look at other things
S0084	yeah it's cheeky
S0082	in try to find what you're want and um they're hop for impulse buy aren't they
S0084	mm there's not a lot of think that go into it you know i often look at things like bouillon you know the stock and that's never where you would imagine it
S0082	no
S0084	to be
S0082	no
S0084	that's always difficult to hunt down
S0082	yeah
S0084	mm mm mm think i'm gonna go star gaze on wednesday
S0082	be you
S0084	there's a group that meet
S0084	in and they go wednesday even and if the er
S0082	hope it's a clear sky
S0084	sky be clear mm they tell they talk to you about it i mean they don't have it if it's not cos there's no point but they bring it's i think it's to do with one of the colleges
S0082	mm
S0084	because they bring actual telescope for you to have a look
S0082	yep
S0084	mm
S0082	that's good
S0084	i know i'm really excite it's really good because on my phone um you can get an app and you hold it against the night sky and it tell you what the constellation be
S0082	oh really
S0084	yeah
S0082	oh good
S0084	it's really clever
S0082	mm
S0084	mm
S0082	mm
S0084	that's the only one i know
S0082	orion or the plough
S0084	mm
S0082	the plough be an easy one to see
S0082	mm
S0082	um i keep think of cornucopia but it's not be it it's a name like that it's um
S0084	mm
S0082	now i'm think of onomatopoeia and it's not that one either
S0084	ursa minor
S0082	no it's it's it's get
S0084	ursa major
S0082	it's get an e e in it it's get it's get about five syllables and an e in it
S0084	hm
S0082	cassiopeia
S0084	oh okay
S0082	mm
S0082	that's the w i think you
S0084	ursa minor's a um constellation within a constellation isn't it
S0082	i don't know
S0084	or it's oh no it's one within orion's belt i think
S0082	yeah i don't i don't know i don't i only know a very little about astronomy
S0084	mm
S0084	mm
S0082	mm
S0084	no i don't know er anything really that's why i want to go along
S0082	yeah
S0082	they all be
S0084	aren't they all
S0082	they're all star
S0082	oh actually the the odds without actually know the odds must be very much in the favour
S0084	mm
S0082	cos there's just so many of them
S0084	it's like when you watch um anything with brian cox in he sort of blow your mind a little bite doesn't he
S0082	mm
S0084	because he sort of say
S0082	mm
S0084	all of these things be possible but it would just the the
S0084	likelihood of it happen be just
S0082	mm
S0084	so slim but you
S0082	mm
S0084	can't say for certain that it won't so therefore that make it
S0084	possible
S0084	mm
S0082	big
S0082	big bang theory
S0082	mm
S0084	it's the only bite of television that isn't rot your brain then
S0082	on on one of the channel i can't remember which one they've get um a ufo er series of program
S0084	mm
S0082	but they're about you know er creditable sight rather than the you know
S0084	crackpots
S0082	the ones yeah who may think be a bite odd
S0084	in roswell
S0082	um and um the one last week be about an american physicist who claim he be work on an alien craft which land er somewhere somewhere in
S0082	well it wasn't there
S0084	mm
S0082	it be er but it be somewhere in america it land and um and for apparently decades it's be i mean he's quite young so he hasn't be work on it for decades but it's be work on
S0084	right
S0082	um and a lot of the sight they believe er of fly saucers in the area they they they do move it to a desert area
S0084	mm
S0082	actually
S0082	area 51 yeah yeah
S0084	that be
S0082	oh be it
S0084	yeah
S0082	oh be it oh right okay
S0082	they do move it to a desert area to keep it out the way of everything but
S0084	mm
S0082	of course they want to you know if they could do anything to it to get it fly they want to test it
S0084	yeah
S0082	but of course you know even if you go to desert area somebody's gonna see it
S0084	yeah
S0082	so they've have sight so a lot of you know he think a lot of the sight be yes but then of course they bring somebody on who say oh this man's a complete fraud you know
S0084	yeah
S0082	so
S0082	mm mm
S0084	oh i really like that film
S0082	mm
S0082	yeah
S0082	yeah
S0082	mm
S0082	mm
S0084	mm
S0082	mm
S0082	mm
S0084	well the film be base on that um conspiracy theory isn't it
S0084	those spider baby
S0082	it be a bite gruesome though
S0084	mm
S0082	what happen you know what er the film depict happen

S0082	well there there might have be
S0082	mm
S0084	that's true
S0084	mm
S0082	or they might have just be scar that you know there's such a risk you know even even with american technology it's such a risk isn't it send people
S0084	mm
S0082	you know that
S0082	that er have get there and get back perhaps they didn't wanna chance do it
S0082	twice
S0084	yeah

S0082	mm
S0084	be they give you this shell
S0082	yeah
S0084	and then on the front they give you a sticker to put over the the
S0082	mm
S0084	the screen so it's scratch proof mm you get a few air bubble but you can't say
S0082	mm
S0084	once you
S0082	mm
S0084	actually
S0082	mm
S0084	turn it on
S0082	such a big thing isn't it
S0084	i know it's massive
S0082	mm
S0084	it's er seem if you put it to your ear like it seem so strange to
S0082	mm
S0084	to talk on it
S0082	it's i think say to me that um cos i you know my phone's still okay cos i mean i basically only use my phone for call and occasionally texts
S0084	mm
S0082	but um what's happen to mine be if i can get it back
S0084	it's get scratch
S0082	can't see it so well in here yeah it's all scratch cos obviously this be very cheap it's all scratch
S0084	yeah and you just put it in your pocket
S0082	so i be i be think of something like that but what say to me er when mum change her phone
S0084	mm
S0082	and her deal
S0084	yeah
S0082	er be that if if you go to i think i'm right i think he say if you go to virgin and you've already get virgin um provide other service
S0084	mhm
S0082	which i have you know television broadband and telephone that you get a much better deal out of virgin for a for a mobile do do mum say that to you
S0084	um i don't know that about package you know
S0082	hmm well
S0084	home package
S0082	i'll i'll have i'll be i'll
S0084	but it's it's worth speak to them about
S0082	i'll be speak to mum at some stage so i can have a word with her
S0084	or i could give you my phone not my new one my old one
S0082	yeah i didn't i wasn't think that well i i yeah i mean
S0084	i could wipe that one and give you that
S0082	mm mhm
S0084	well i mean i need to wipe it anyway
S0082	but it probably won't work because you have to get them unlock don't you like you cos your
S0084	tut oh you're with virgin
S0082	no i'm with um t mobile you see that's why i be think of virgin
S0084	oh
S0082	so what i might do next time i go into the city centre or in fact i could do it online couldn't i
S0084	mm
S0082	be just see whether there's any reference on their website to a deal
S0084	mm
S0082	have you find authorhouse
S0084	yeah it be american then american company base here
S0082	oh right
S0084	be it
S0082	don't know he didn't say it be american but it could be
S0084	authorhouse exist to help author achieve success we provide a broad array of tool and service to allow author to make their own choices throughout the publish process so essentially it's not a traditional publish house
S0082	yeah
S0084	probably just get some cheap you know product at the end of it that doesn't look very professional
S0082	mhm so it's probably one of the ones where you have to put money up front and they
S0084	yeah basically author retain all right maintain editorial control and choose exact selection of service that best suit their goals
S0082	yeah
S0084	sound dubious i'd be nervous
S0082	well i'd be nervous about
S0084	bookshop
S0082	put any money up i think
S0084	well
S0082	i mean if they want to um see what they could do tout it around well fine
S0084	mm
S0082	because presumably with your author i mean a lot of your author be probably dead but the ones that be still alive um the cup treat them in the in the traditional way don't they
S0084	mm
S0082	they you know they write the material and you sell it on their behalf
S0084	well er in because it's reference and because it's a specific market rather than accept submissions they commission
S0082	yeah
S0084	so they'll look at the market and speak to the school and
S0082	yeah
S0084	see what they what
S0082	mm
S0084	particular niche area they need do they need more grammar book do they need more exam materials
S0082	yeah
S0084	you know
S0082	yeah
S0084	and then base on
S0082	but when
S0084	that market research they'll commission the product
S0082	when they when they do a commission they don't say to somebody look you know we've get lot of school that want a book on you know syntax
S0084	mm
S0082	therefore you know er if you're prepare to um um pay us you know a thousand pound
S0084	yeah
S0082	er we'll we'll get them to publish you know
S0084	no
S0082	we'll publish it and sell um sell it so it's
S0084	it's the same contractual deal that you'd have
S0082	you you don't you you don't you don't do that do you
S0084	no no they get
S0082	what what
S0084	they get a fee and then they get royalties
S0082	yeah yeah
S0084	they certainly don't pay
S0082	yeah
S0084	i mean it's a very small world
S0082	whereas with this one i imagine you have to pay them
S0084	it's yeah it's a bite
S0082	do it say that
S0084	it doesn't it's a bite unclear package it doesn't actually say see this be this be what i mean like black and white publish start at four nine nine four like so yeah you have to pay
S0082	yeah you've gotta put money up front
S0084	yeah and i don't know what kind of product you end up with at the end
S0082	yeah
S0084	if you look at bookshop
S0082	so it's money up front and what sort of product so the thing to do really i would imagine be if he want to find out more his er whoever he's speak to there
S0084	mm
S0082	ask whether they've get any sample of what the
S0084	mm
S0082	finish product look like
S0084	yeah i mean it might be that what be these then
S0082	or be there anything they could be be that what that be there
S0084	yeah top sellers
S0082	have you hear of any of the top sellers
S0084	no because the first one be call reverse in ministry and missions africans in the dark continent of europe
S0082	oh right so that's er
S0084	mm what's that
S0082	that's go to er that's gonna equal j k rowling isn't it
S0084	mm blimey i mean just look at the front cover for that
S0082	that be very much a limit limit market but yeah
S0084	it's just cheesariffic
S0082	mm
S0084	it really be
S0082	mm
S0084	because there's no money you know you're not gonna
S0082	yeah
S0084	they're not gonna
S0082	yeah
S0084	pay money be they to get a professional
S0082	the they're not
S0084	cover designer
S0082	they're not gonna get they're not gonna get er a to design anything be they
S0084	tut no
S0082	not for four hundred quid
S0084	no
S0082	five hundred quid or whatever it be
S0084	huh author in the news huh
S0082	on lose
