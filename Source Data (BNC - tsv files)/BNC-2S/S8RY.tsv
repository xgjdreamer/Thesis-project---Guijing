S0202	that's the word
S0208	we have the exact same relationship with like very very similar personalities which be weird cos we don't have the same dad but whatever erm basically one thing that i've never be able to get over be the way that my mum would always call tea tea or dinner it's like what do you want for dinner what do you want for tea the more and more time she spend at 's bear in mind we'd already move from england to france
S0202	mm
S0208	so i dunno she would like see her what like every maybe like three time a year two time a year sometimes one time a year one time sorry all of a sudden from one day to the next after be at the 's she would start call it supper because call it supper because grow up she'd never call it tea or dinner in her life she's always call it supper because her parent call it supper like it be just supper
S0202	yeah
S0208	so would be like oh what do you want for supper be you happy with like spaghetti bolognese i would be like yeah yeah that's fine mum instantly would be like yeah yeah suppers in france be a lot different you know like for supper we have like a barbecue sometimes for supper and she's like proper just ah just really fuck irritate me
S0202	yeah it irritate me
S0208	it's something that get under my skin and then from then on she always call it supper and i bring it bring it up a few time and i be like why all of a sudden be you call it supper i never do it in front of her friends cos i'm not do it to piss her off
S0202	to embarrass her
S0208	or to embarrass her
S0202	you do it
S0208	so when we be alone i would be just like why be you all of a sudden call it supper she's like i've always call it supper supper its supper it's supper time like you've never fuck call it supper in your life i be like i've know you for about sixteen seventeen years why be you call it supper now it's like you don't call it supper and then erm 's mum oh dear oh my god the way she talk
S0202	get it out get it out
S0208	okay its its gonna have to happen because
S0202	just get it out
S0208	i haven't even
S0202	it's fine
S0208	be able to say it to dad because a few time i've bring it up there's never be a moment where my mum hasn't be there and me and my dad will have a quick chuckle but then you know what my mum's like she's like oh be i not in on the joke can i not know be it just something between you and your dad and i'm just like no like why would you even say that do you know what i mean
S0202	cos she's fuck
S0208	ah my god she's just like she like to feel i think that she like the drama and she like to feel sorry for herself and she like to like at the party she felt a little bite leave out so she purposefully make herself
S0202	put herself out of this situation
S0208	out so that she could bitch and moan and whine about
S0202	and that's your mum all over all over
S0208	and that's my mum so have this way of talk which isn't even weird because it's just it's be like that since i've know her and i've know her since i move to france be like one of the first friends i ever meet in in france so about ten years and erm she have this way of talk where she's quite posh but she's get she's get quite a like twang to her accent so when she say the word so for example and she get drink like basically every night so she's always piss and like
S0202	mm
S0208	when we go for when we use to go for barbecue you could see her and she would be like it be just so and she have that way of do it like exactly that mannerism like go so and like sort of like suck her lips in a bite as if she's suck them in
S0202	yeah
S0208	but that's just how i'd well she's just like that
S0202	yeah that's just who she be yeah
S0208	my mum all of a sudden a couple of years ago start do the exact same thing but like use the exact expressions the exact mannerisms as and i never mention it to my mum because i be like right cos because i be like the few time i have mention that thing with supper with it turn into a massive argument which be like for a simple
S0202	cos she get defensive cos she know exactly what she be do
S0208	exactly
S0202	and you be pick up on it
S0208	and it turn into a massive argument and then my dad be the peacekeeper that he be would always come to me and be like you're not handle the situation appropriately go apologise to your mum and i would just be like what the fuck be actually happen can i not actually have an opinion in this house it's like you always just gonna be there so that you can just keep the peace regardless of what i'm feel or whatever so i end up have arguments with my dad about it just for my mum's benefit
S0202	yeah
S0208	which doesn't happen any more that be back when i be a bite younger erm go through my like rebellious stage but erm i hadn't mention it to my mum cos i know what would happen and er i just go to england and it wasn't even me that bring it up it be my sister it be she be like you know that face that mum do that really fuck piss me off and she be like erm so
