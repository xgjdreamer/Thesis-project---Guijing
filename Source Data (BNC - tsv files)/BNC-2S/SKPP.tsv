S0202	why though cos er you're on the internet it's not
S0208	mm
S0202	you don't even have to put your face on it you can just like
S0208	i know it's
S0202	blur that part out sort of thing like
S0208	i know
S0202	you don't even need to you know
S0208	it's like i want to cos like i love i love sing it bring me so much joy like i really love sing and i'd love to share it but i'm i'm worry that like people will reject it it sound really lame
S0202	no i no i understand
S0208	cos what should i care but it's still it's it's put my face in the
S0202	you yeah it's a it's and you're scar of negativity there's nothing wrong about that or weird about that er like everyone fear that everyone fear get reject i mean
S0208	yeah
S0202	a a simple example what last time i go round i go out with all lads it be 's house warm party like it be the night before i come to your friend's actually
S0208	mm
S0202	and er we go out and we go to this bar the bar and erm we be there till like half one in the morning and like be we actually gonna leave yet we've be here all night we've not leave be we stay here all night why aren't we why aren't we leave so oh well there's some fit girls here right okay you gonna speak to them no well
S0208	scar of rejection
S0202	why the fuck be we here then
S0208	mm
S0202	like why aren't you speak to them it be like oh well they might they might not like me
S0208	and that's like me yeah
S0202	well how do you know until you speak to them like i don't get it i don't get that but that's because i've always be confident in myself that if i go and speak to a guy i can get lay but
S0202	i suppose i'm a girl guy will
S0208	yeah
S0202	sleep with anything it's harder for guy girls have higher standards
S0208	yeah and like erm when you er when be here the first time and we be say i need to just have to put that song online cos i say i'm gonna start up a youtube channel but i don't want my first video to be just by myself
S0202	you should do it because you be such
S0208	no
S0202	a good singer
S0208	think
S0202	like and you
S0208	i'm not
S0202	no like
S0208	say it for that
S0202	i'm no i know you're not but the the thing be like you you've never sing properly in front of me but i've hear you sing like in the shower and
S0202	like the stuff like that and you're such a beautiful singer and you've get such a beautiful face and a beautiful personality like people will love you people will be people be draw to you and that be a reason like that and and all them lot never fell out with you because they be draw to you because you be such a beautiful person like you don't have a negative bone in your body
S0208	mm
S0202	no i'm not say it for any
S0208	no i know but i
S0202	anything but i'm really
S0208	get really situation
S0202	genuinely mean it no but
S0202	i know you do i do but honestly you be genuinely a beautiful person and it make me happy in a way that you be you shy away from it cos that tell me that that make you even more of a beautiful person if that make sense like
S0208	mm
S0202	if you be the sort of person that be to turn around and say oh i know like i'm so amaze like
S0202	i love myself that'd make you so much that'd
S0208	that's not attractive
S0202	make you a dickhead it's not attractive but the fact that you don't know it and the fact that you're so insecure receive compliment make it more clear that you be a beautiful person
S0208	oh thank you
S0202	like so anyway let's just forget i say that because i don't want you to feel awkward
S0208	thank you
S0202	but like that's what i think about you
S0208	yeah
S0202	like i genuinely believe that you be a beautiful person and sometimes i wonder why you're my friend and
S0208	why
S0202	i genuinely think that cos yeah just
S0208	well you know what
S0202	insecurities
S0208	i see a lot of myself in you but mostly i see a lot of my personality in you but it's part of my part of my personality that i would never show
S0202	mm
S0208	i think that's what draw me to you at first be because i'd love to be outgo and i'm really outgo with the people that know me but with strangers i'm not like when you be so outgo with strangers and so come to my door and so easily make friends so this be the kind of person i need to be with because you'll you bring out like the better side of me
S0202	mm
S0208	if you know what i mean whereas if i be to hang out with another shy person it would be awkward like erm 's friend i have a absolutely fantastic night when i go out with them that be the first night i go out with black
S0202	yeah
S0208	and all of that lot and that be the night that erm and and invite me to live with them
S0208	because they be like oh we love you so much you have to live with us and i be like well thank you but i'm previously engage
S0208	i say that because i know i be gonna live with you
S0202	yeah
S0208	and because you didn't know then yet wasn't gonna be like okay but have to come cos they didn't know you
S0202	mm
S0208	so i just like yeah thank i'm previously engage
S0208	but erm that be the first night i go out with them but be basically very much socially awkward like i be but all the same things so and me and her i be already ready cos i'd come down for pre drink it be about nine o'clock in the even and i go down to her flat and i be in her room with her and i be get to know and like i saw the picture on her wall and i be like use to go to school with that girl cos she go to erm and i go to high school and they be two private school in the same town two girls' school but right next to each other
S0202	mm
S0208	like i almost go to i visit that school and everything the same year that she go and we use to get the same bus we live in the same area and we never meet each other like that's so weird
S0202	yeah
S0208	but she go on the morocco holiday that all of my friends from england go on and i remember talk to a girl call who i be really good friends with erm who'd go to the morocco holiday and i remember ask her this be i mean i be quite old i be about fifteen or sixteen at the time and i be still talk to her and like i be still friendly with her and erm i remember just chat to her and like oh what be you up to this summer and she be like i'm go to morocco on a girls' holiday with some girls from our school and from because you know and i be like oh wow that's such a small world you know that's amaze and she be like yeah you would have be here have to stay and all that kind of stuff
S0202	yeah
S0208	turn out be one of those girls
S0202	yeah it's such a small world innit
S0208	it's just so weird and i be look at all these picture like i use to go to school with all of these girls like they like be one of my closest friends it be just so weird but yeah basically erm go to the kitchen to sort some stuff out with and it be just me and and oh my god it be so awkward
S0208	l actually broach the awkwardness and i be like
S0202	like me with
S0208	i be like i'm sorry that i'm so awkward but i'm quite shy in these situations and she be like oh my god me too and as soon as we broach that subject
S0202	you bond over the yeah
S0208	we we bond over our mutual awkwardness
S0208	and then the whole night it be amaze because i didn't know very well at that point this be still very early this be in like first semester

S0208	it be hilarious er that's the only night that i genuinely kind of bond with and since it's be different
S0202	the thing be with
S0208	but not in a nasty way
S0202	no just that
S0208	it's just cos we're not very close
S0202	the thing be with have a lot of friends and she only consider a small group of them close
S0208	yeah
S0202	because she have so many cos be one of them girls she's the diplomat she doesn't get involve in shit she doesn't oh she doesn't want to upset anyone i mean
S0208	i guess kinda like me
S0202	yeah and she's so outgo and loud and not in a bad way loud but she's just loud and she's nice and all that sort of stuff like people be people gravitate towards her and she's the same with everyone so like over the summer holiday i've become really close to cos we spend like four days together and
S0208	mm
S0202	we really bond and stuff and i find out a lot about that i didn't know before
S0208	yeah

S0208	i be like don't take this the wrong way well there's nothing to take the wrong way but i be so so happy when you tell me that you'd be get closer to and get closer to because i be like i be sort of say to myself like she's finally get over that insecurity of make new friends

S0202	mm
S0208	in smaller number and when you start branch out i be like i be so happy for you i be like i'm so happy that you've get over that insecurity because of everything that happen with our flatmates

S0208	like from that first night we bond because when i say
S0202	and she'll get her arse out and stuff
S0208	yeah like from that first night when we bond over and the fact that she get naked in front of me

S0202	i mean i don't see it's weird cos like i really close relationship with er not black and but i don't have a close relationship with and
S0208	mm
S0202	i find it hard i do like don't get me wrong but i find it hard to like her
S0208	mm
S0202	because she's she's so dramatic and she lie a lot and
S0208	mm
S0202	i just find it hard to not feel awkward around her but that's the same as i i will always feel like awkward around even though after our library sessions and all our like be one of the first people i tell all that happen with them and they be call me a slag and all that even after that i still feel awkward around them but that's cos i've not spend enough time with them not to feel awkward
S0208	whereas mine's different i've get so close to straight away
S0202	yeah and you feel awkward around the rest it's it's the same
S0208	especially as awful as this sound cos i know that white be really nice like all the things that i've hear about her like rave on about her as if she be royalty
S0202	mm
S0208	like in a nice way not be bitchy
S0202	yeah i know what you mean
S0208	like i've never get
S0202	i don't get it either
S0208	and i've never get a a nice vibe from her
S0202	no me neither
S0208	and it's like i'm gonna give her time because obviously she's friends with my friends and like she seem like a really lovely person but when i go out with i can't remember why you couldn't come but the night out the night i go out with
S0202	out at the
S0208	yeah the night i go out with and we go to meet her cousin er with mm
S0202	well i've get a funny story for you before you finish that
S0208	yeah
S0202	rave on about but she say as as soon as she start see she change and maybe that's why you don't get that vibe from her because i don't get
S0208	maybe
S0202	a nice vibe from her either
S0208	because the first time i meet white she wasn't with that guy
S0202	yeah
S0208	she be with her ex boyfriend and erm we go to to a bar to meet her er 's cousin i go out with she didn't wanna go alone so i go with her and she promise me a great night out and she'd buy me a free drink so i be like yeah i'll come with you so we go up to meet with her cousin and her cousin be hilarious and all of his friends like they be older

S0208	and i feel so bad about that
S0202	yeah but she doesn't smoke normally
S0208	no no
S0202	it's only when she's drink so it's fine
S0208	even though she still doesn't smoke like she say she hat it mm
S0202	go on i'll have a drag
S0208	i still feel bad but anyway we meet up with white so she come into the bar with us to have a few drink like with everyone there be like a massive table of her cousin's friends they be all have dinner
S0208	we be at like a separate table
S0208	white and her boyfriend come round and we're like we be have a laugh and a drink and a joke and then they get into an argument and they go home and be like no i don't wanna come out with you guy i'm gonna go home so we be like okay we go out but that be the only time i properly bond with her like we have one on one conversations

S0208	and you weren't there yet and i be just like i just need someone that i can like make me feel comfortable

S0208	cos as soon as you're around it's like i find it very hard to instigate conversation
S0202	yeah
S0208	whereas when you're there and you start up a conversation i find it easy to slide in
S0202	yeah
S0208	but i need someone to make the first move so be bezzy mat with her i'm already a little bite awkward with but just because we've never have the bond experience so like it be fine but then come down with her boyfriend and i be chat to them and we be play never have i ever and me and her boyfriend drink at the same thing i can't remember what it be it be something funny and he be like oh you too and we start laugh and i could just see her sort of like eye me a bite weird
S0202	
S0208	yeah
S0202	white
S0208	yeah but because i know he be i know that he be her boyfriend so like it sound really stupid but as soon as i saw her eye me i be purposefully brush off any conversation he make with me and he be stand next to me and he keep make conversation and i be just like yeah and i be try to be purposefully a bite shut off so that she would see that i wasn't
S0202	interest
S0208	try to go anywhere
S0202	yeah
S0208	but it's it it turn out fine and then cos be there a really good friend of
S0202	yeah from your course yeah
S0208	yeah erm asian asian
S0202	yeah
S0208	and we start erm we just start talk about and he be like yeah i saw you be really good friends with and he tell me that he be really offend that i'd gravitate towards rather than him
S0208	cos we be all in in first semester for er a i think it be political theory
S0202	let's go inside it's cold
S0208	we be bring the wine
S0202	yeah i'm bring it don't worry
S0208	we be all in the same seminar which i don't know if i've ever tell you actually but the whole reason me and become friends be because erm we be in the same seminar for that on a friday morning but we have erm a next seminar together so i remember once she just thank you erm she as we be stand up to leave she be just like do anyone have to go to make of the modern world and i stand up and i be like me
S0208	and that's how we become friends but before that i be friends with erm like before i get friends with her like we'd sit next to each other and chat and then be really good friends with
S0202	the asian guy
S0208	yeah so it be me and and him and and then we become like a kind of foursome
S0208	which be completely coincidental because then we get put into group and our group because we be all sit together talk our group be me and this other guy
S0202	right
S0208	who i still don't like erm so
S0208	we only meet up we be suppose to meet up every week before our seminar to discuss the question which we do once and end up only talk about shit
S0208	so we decide let's just not do this again we'll just wing it the next time
S0202	yeah
S0208	cos no one want to meet up that early in the morning cos our seminar be already at ten and we have to meet up and nine and no one want to do that
S0202	yeah no one want to do that
S0208	so we meet up once but then i always just gravitate a bite more towards so like i'd sit by me sit next to there'd be a space next to me and would come
S0202	mm
S0208	and sit and like we would chat and stuff and then that night cos i'd never speak to really he be like yeah you be always so much more friendlier with and it make me feel really exclude and like he'd always talk about you and how nice you be
S0202	ah
S0208	and i be like oh but i love you
S0208	i be like you be so sweet and i love you so much
S0208	so we just become friends that's why that night at i be really happy to see them cos it be the first time i'd socialise with them outside
S0202	that's the first time you disappear as well
S0208	i'm sorry
S0202	no i disappear all the time
S0208	i have such a good
S0202	i disappear all the time like how many time do i disappear

S0208	your personality and i know that you go on adventure and i know that you get a bite more
S0202	aggressive when i'm drink
S0208	wouldn't say yeah aggressive when you're drink
S0202	yeah i do yeah
S0208	i've stop take it personal personally
S0208	cos it's like that night out that we go with and your new friend when you say you want to go home i know that you wouldn't take it bad that i say that and no matter what bad things you say to me i know that you wouldn't
S0202	no no

S0202	yeah
S0208	but it's like at first because you be like i know it back then that you be my only true friend and i be like i can't fuck this up
S0208	and that's why felt such an obligation to like
S0202	no i felt so bad as well
S0208	be
S0202	a lot of the time
S0208	like that with you but now on like even next year or anything if you go off on an adventure i hope you know

S0208	because that night be honestly i i be sick with worry
S0202	oh i'm so sorry
S0208	no no i be sick with worry because
S0202	i'm so sorry
S0208	i know how drink you be i be sick with worry because i think something would have happen to you that's the i mean
S0202	can you imagine me get rap that would never happen
S0208	no you'd rip off someone's penis before that happen but i just
S0202	i would bite it off
S0208	but i just i just i felt sick with worry but now that i know you because that be that be a month after we meet each other
S0202	mm
S0208	not even or a bite more
S0202	we be still like even then we be like mega close though weren't we like
S0208	yeah but it be still it be still new
S0202	yeah
S0208	and i still felt like
S0202	didn't really know each other
S0208	it sound
S0202	that deeply
S0208	really sad like i feel i can tell you now but i still felt like i have to impress you
S0202	yeah i felt
S0208	so
S0202	the same about you for up until like january
S0208	yeah it's like don't
S0202	even when i
S0208	don't
S0202	even though when i be at your house with your parent i felt like i have to impress
S0208	so
S0202	everyone
S0208	don't take this the wrong way because i don't feel like that now
S0202	mm
S0208	and honestly it's not a a problem but i felt like i have to agree with you on everything because you be so strong personality wise
S0202	mm
S0208	and like your rant and stuff i'm not gonna lie
S0208	at first fuck terrify me
S0208	cos i'd never see anyone apart from my mum use such profuse language and i'd be like yeah i agree
S0208	fuck fuck dickhead cunt yeah yeah cos i be scar about what you'd like turn on me if i say no don't agree
S0208	whereas now i'm just like no come no erm but yeah that's why i get so scar that night of halloween and i tell and i be like and we have to leave now i be like i have to make sure she's okay
S0208	i can't have her be mad at me
S0202	i'm such a dickhead
S0208	she's gonna yell at me tomorrow and all that kind of stuff
S0208	but he be like why do you care so much blah blah blah and i be like she's my only friend
S0208	but he be like you're out with all these people and i be like yes but i don't like them
S0208	so that's why at first i be so scar because i felt like i have to agree with like all of your opinions
S0202	opinions yeah
S0208	and it sound really stupid but now i know that i can i can say no and like you don't care
S0202	mm
S0208	like at first i felt like i be
S0202	i accept it
S0208	like i i have to agree with her because otherwise we won't be friends
S0208	and i can't lose her as a friend
S0202	i use to think the same about you it's really weird cos like
S0208	oh really
S0202	yeah cos like don't judge me on this okay
S0208	mm
S0202	you there's no judgement allow
S0208	listen
S0202	okay
S0208	all the nights i've be like don't take offence don't take offence
S0202	so before i meet you i would have be the sort of person to do that to and 's ipad and laptop i would have do that
S0208	right
S0202	i would not have think twice about it i would have before i meet you i would have do that to 's door before i meet you if
S0208	mm
S0202	if in september i didn't meet you and we weren't friends and all that happen i would have do that i would not have think twice about it and i felt guilty after i do it and my conscience would not let me rest like i wouldn't have be able to sleep blah blah but wouldn't have think any twice about do it but as soon as i meet you and as soon as we get to know each other and as soon as we become really good friends i always find myself think what would say what would think
S0208	really
S0202	wouldn't would not agree with this if cos cos i have so much anger inside me like that that night that i snap the reason i snap be cos i weren't with you if i be be with you i wouldn't have snap and like as soon as i do it i delete it because i know that you would have disapprove of it i know that that's not who i be and i know like as much as i want as much as i try to be that person who be aggressive and who be mouthy and who be all this or that i'm not that person and that's why i delete it instantly
S0208	but that
S0202	and like
S0208	i don't take offence by that i actually find that's quite a complement because i know that i have a very high tolerance and i know that i will always give people the benefit of the doubt or i'm always one for give second chance and all that kind of stuff i mean as an example
S0202	mm
S0208	like i just i don't
S0202	hold grudge
S0208	no i
S0202	you're not a bitter person
S0208	i i can't like i physically can't
S0202	it take too much energy
S0208	yeah
S0202	like
S0208	i just don't have time for it
S0202	and and the thing be you've teach me that like
S0208	and i've i've always tell you that as well it's like when you would always go off on a rant or stuff like with and all that kind of stuff i would always say i don't have time for that
S0202	mm
S0208	it's like i just don't care i nothing them
S0202	mm
S0208	and i find that quite a compliment that you say that because like don't take this nastily or anything but i'd never
S0202	no
S0208	i'd never meet anyone who be so like expressive
S0202	mm
S0208	with their feel i guess
S0202	but it help me because
S0208	so because i be also quite young i mean i be only eighteen like i'm nineteen now it's not a big difference but because i'd never live through all the stuff that
S0202	yeah
S0208	you'd live through you open my eye as well just the way i guess you open mine
S0202	in the opposite way yeah like
S0208	but i find that as a compliment rather than offensive because it feel nice to be able to know that i'm able to
S0202	make a positive impact
S0208	calm you in a certain way
S0202	yeah cos
S0208	just the way that you bring out the fire in me
S0202	cos the thing be like with me like before i go to university i go to see a psychic you know the story i've
S0208	mm
S0202	tell you and she's the whole the psychic be the only the whole reason that i have this relationship with my mum she's my own mum
S0208	yeah
S0202	didn't i didn't speak to her for four years i use to tell her how much i hat her
S0208	do you wanna go over this thing
S0202	yeah like
S0208	again
S0202	i use to tell her how much i hat her like i never use to get a birthday card off her i didn't get a birthday card off her from be fifteen
S0208	that's really sad though that's really
S0202	like
S0208	it's alight
S0202	and i go i go to see this psychic and she tell me all this stuff like i be carry on this take this around with me and have all these problems and
S0208	yeah
S0202	it be weird i don't know why
S0208	alight frodo frodo frodo come on
S0202	like and she be tell me like i be carry this bitterness around with me and i be such an angry person and like i think right i reckon if it be mum i'm gonna stop carry this bitterness around with me and i think that would be enough and then i meet you and like i hate admit this but i be such an angry person i be so angry at the world i be so angry at everyone like i be angry at or angry at my mum i be angry at my life i be angry at everyone and there be no reason for it
S0208	the thing be though
S0202	and
S0208	you say that you be a really angry person until you meet me but i be too calm a person till you meet me i be a pushover i'm not afraid of admit it i still be i'm work at
S0202	and you still be but
S0208	i'm work on it
S0202	the thing be i'm still an angry person but i'm work on it
S0208	and i think that's what
S0202	you know
S0208	that's what we bring each other we complement each other because i teach you how to calm down and maybe think a bite more rationally or whatever
S0202	and i teach you how to stand up for yourself a little bite more
S0208	you teach me how to stand up for myself because i mean there be things that people have do to me that i have let go because i haven't be bother or i've be too scar of confrontation and it's stuff that i regret now
S0202	yeah
S0208	whereas no have that argument with the other night i don't regret it at all the only thing i regret be that it didn't happen sooner but i'm always too afraid of what other people will think and i'm always afraid of repercussions
S0202	yeah
S0208	feel like even though i know that i like what i've say to you from the start even though i know that i would never be friends with any of those people regardless of what i say whether i be nice to them or not i know i be never go to be friends with them i still couldn't be angry towards them
S0202	yeah
S0208	but i'm work on it
S0202	but that really upset me as well and i'm so i'm say this now but it really upset me that they be do all these things to me and you couldn't stand up for me and then i take a step back and realise that you're not me you be a shy person you be not like me i'm fiery i be a loud person i will stand up for anyone anyone who i think be be hurt i will stand up for them and no question ask but
S0208	i know
S0202	you be not like that
S0208	but i
S0202	and you're that that's not a fault
S0208	no but i've
S0202	it's a fault of mine that i think that of you
S0208	i've always always felt every time something happen and i er i couldn't not that you be insinuate because i know you didn't mean it to put me down but when you'd say or when actually would say i hope like people would stick up or whatever it's when i realise i be like i i need to i need to stick up cos i be like i i love her so much and i can't even stick up for my friend who be in need of it and that's when i really realise that there be a problem and i try to make a difference like that
S0202	and you do though
S0208	that meet that you have
S0202	you make a difference by be my friend
S0208	that's that erm meet that you have
S0202	but do it even matter about the meet
S0208	with that guy at university that's i say i be gonna use my voice but like honestly you say that it's like it's not it's not news to me because i know every time that you want me to stick up for you and i didn't do it it's something that i regret
S0202	but you stick up for me in a different way
S0208	but
S0202	you stick up for me by still be my friend
S0208	well i'm
S0202	and stand by me by and
S0208	i'm glad you see it that way because
S0202	you know
S0208	even even
S0202	you didn't stand up with your gob you stand up by be my friend
S0208	that's
S0202	and you stand up in a different way
S0208	i i guess that's just kind of how i use myself it's like i will always show support where it's need but like i'm not the kind of person that will put myself out there and say stuff and as no matter how much i try and rectify that or try and stand up
S0202	no it's who you be
S0208	not not only for myself though it's just for you it's for myself i'm not even capable of say stuff for myself like when i hear say that stuff i still didn't say something it be for myself well i just can't do it but
S0202	no and i understand that and it's like i mean the hardest part for me well like i've say to this i've say this to you so many time i be twenty two i be go into an environment where i be gonna be surround by eighteen year olds
S0208	yeah
S0202	and everything be so perfect like you remember that little white board that we have
S0208	yeah
S0202	like erm so and so in this flat
S0208	put all our name on it
S0202	love so and so in four 0 seven and it be so nice and then as soon as and come into the situation everything change and it just
S0208	not just
S0202	no just not even
S0208	because i don't know if i tell you this but age ago i mean like it be a while after all of that shit happen a long time after that i mean it be just before it happen with just before exams and stuff i be go to uni and be obviously go up at the same time and we get into the elevator er elevator be i american
S0202	mm
S0208	get into the lift together and it be it be so awkward i mean i wasn't gonna say anything because well as much as i i don't have the gut to stick up for people that i love and stuff i have the gut to just remain silent so like i like i'm like my mum i'm very much like my mum i like to please people
S0202	yeah
S0208	whether i like them or not i like to be like and that's one of my fault i i i need to be like
S0202	mm
S0208	so that's probably one of the reason why i always stay silent but when we go into the lift i didn't say anything and i didn't look in her direction and i be like this be awkward but i'm i'm stay silent i be like i don't need to please this person i don't like this person and she start talk to me and she be like hi so i know it be obviously direct at me and i be like hi didn't wanna be rude erm but then when i be like in my head i be like why be i even speak to this person why be i give her the time of day it be like so what if i'm rude to her i be like she's be so rude to my friend but then instantly she be like i'm so sorry for everything that's happen like instantly and she wasn't with and i sort of that's when i sort of start to realise i be like you really be a lapdog i didn't say it but i be like i don't want your apology she be like no but i i feel genuinely bad about everything that's happen and i be like i don't care and she be like so i know i i haven't speak to you in a while but like how be everything how be you and she seem genuinely
S0202	interest
S0208	like no worry like genuinely worry
S0202	mm
S0208	and i be like things could be better thank like i be be short and i be
S0202	civil
S0208	i be proud of myself in that moment because usually i would be civil as fuck but to this person i just i felt like i owe her nothing and i feel really bad because we be walk to uni together we be in the lift together we be go up the step together and when we get to the top of the step she keep walk straight and i walk over the cross light but i always walk over that way anyway
S0202	yeah we both do it's a habit yeah
S0208	but she be i could tell she be try and i just wasn't interest and i be like this be my time to rectify all those time i didn't stick up for you like do you know what i mean because
S0202	but i don't need you to stick up for me
S0208	no i know
S0202	but like in my head
S0208	and you're say you're say this now
S0202	in my head it's like
S0208	but at the time
S0202	i want you to but then
S0208	no
S0202	i think to myself i don't need anyone to stick up for me because end of the day i do nothing wrong i do nothing to deserve that the thing be with she doesn't like other people be look at she doesn't like other people be pretty
S0208	no but
S0202	and that's all it be
S0208	hear me out like this isn't nasty at all you're say this now but at the time i know you want to stick up for me i could see it in your eye i could sense it in what you be say even i think the worst part be because he be the one that make me feel the worst i can't remember exactly what it be that he say or what would be say but he would make it know that he be disappoint in the fact that i wasn't stick up do you know what i mean
S0202	mm
S0208	and that's when i try to make a difference but i'm just i'm not that person no matter what someone do to me or as well as awful as it sound especially to someone else because if someone do something awful to someone else as awful as it sound they didn't do it to me
S0202	yeah
S0208	and i think in my head i have no right to be horrible to this person
S0202	mm
S0208	because of what they've do to someone else because no matter how close that person be to me or whatever i if unless they hurt me personally i physically can't muster that strength and that anger
S0202	yeah
S0208	to pull them up on it and i love you so much and i hope you know that
S0202	i know you do
S0208	i would do anything for you
S0202	of course i do of course i do
S0208	i hope you know that i just
S0202	er
S0208	i can't
S0202	i know
S0208	voice it
S0202	and i know that and i always know that and like that's why i always stick up for you not because of any other reason but i know that you couldn't do it yourself and that's why i always
S0208	i can't do it for myself
S0202	that's why i always put myself out there that's why i always make it know that i be not happy with how
S0208	no
S0202	they be treat you
S0208	i'm sorry because i realise that
S0202	and i didn't do it for anything else other than i want them to stop
S0208	no because i think you need
S0202	do what they be do to you as well
S0208	you need to hear this
S0202	what they be do to me
S0208	because half of the stuff that you've live through with all of those horrible people be because of me because you've be stick
S0202	it's not because of you
S0208	no listen it's because you've be stick up for me and you'd always put yourself out there for my sake and defend me and i wasn't able to do the same for you and i'm so sorry that you have to live through all of that with the people and i wasn't there to stick up for you
S0202	do you know what we've both live through it we both live through it you put up with as much shit as i do let's face it you put up with shit because you be my friend
S0208	but i would always choose you over anyone else
S0202	i know you would that be i'm not protest that at all
S0208	no i
S0202	but my point be
S0208	i know
S0202	you stick up for me by be my friend and not be friends with them and not entertain their bullshit
S0208	i'm just sorry that i couldn't
S0202	what
S0208	give you more
S0202	what be angry at them make yourself a victim
S0208	yeah but i
S0202	or a target like me
S0208	i didn't care what they think that's the thing be like
S0202	i know but that's the thing you show them that
S0208	i didn't care and i'm so sorry
S0202	don't don't seriously don't apologise
S0208	no because you live through so much shit
S0202	and so do you we both live through it together and let's face it i didn't fuck help myself when i put that facebook status like i be just as much to blame as they be when i put that and yet i apologise and yet it go too far after that but before that as soon as i put that status i be invite this shit i be invite the fact that i didn't like them and they didn't like me we make it know by me put that status you know and it doesn't matter what you say or it didn't say they be always gonna do what they be gonna do whether i put that status or not or whether you say something or if i say something
S0208	i just hope you know that
S0202	the fact be that i stand up to them and they're bully that's all they be that be all will ever be and she make her friends do that and the fact of the matter be when they leave university and when they have children and they look back they will realise and do you know what it doesn't even matter whether you say anything to them or not you're my friend you stick by me through all of it through all my rant through all my tear
S0202	through all this shit that i deserve
S0208	well of course
S0202	or didn't deserve you be there as my friend you're still my friend now you know and you didn't have to be the easy way out would have be do what do go and be friends with them and not be my friend
S0208	i wouldn't have do that ever
S0202	exactly and that's your way of stick up for me and be my friend
S0208	i'm sorry that i couldn't voice it be all i'm say but
S0202	it doesn't matter
S0208	through you help me and show me that it's okay to stick up for yourself and it's okay to get angry at people it's not the end of the world because i i guess that from where i come from it's it be it be quite an enclose environment like with my parent and my friends
S0202	eh up then ginger
S0208	so because i have have quite a close upbringing and be so different to your situation i just want you to know that you have help me to find the voice that i guess i've always want to have but i've be too scar to voice if you know what i mean it sound really weird but because what i live through with and all that like i do i do stick up for myself for six months we didn't talk i literally couldn't look at her the silence i get i think that silence be my worst weapon because people always accept me to be that sweet person that's always gonna be forgive or that i think the silence be the worse treatment i can give someone
S0202	it be because i'm not be funny or anything but i wish that i'd have just not give them any er recognition at all
S0208	but i think that's the worse i think that's the well i think that because i feel it's the worst treatment someone can give me when someone's mad at me and the silent treatment
S0202	it's the worst
S0208	it's the worst feel i can have because i'd rather someone shout at me and me explain my side or me shout back than silence and i think you and see how the way you handle things and learn about your upbringing and just a completely different side to what i've ever live through have help me find it and this summer with all the shit that's go through with when i be actually proud of myself for do this because when i stand up to her and tell her every single thing i have on my chest against her
S0202	and i be i'm proud of you as well
S0208	and it be fine and as soon as i realise and i saw 's reaction yes she be hurt but talk through it and then we go out together and it be fine like it be absolutely fine there be
S0202	yeah you work it out
S0208	not even an awkwardness because she want to hear it and i be ready to say it it make me realise that i've get nothing to be afraid of by stand up for myself and that's because of you so i want you to know that if anything happen if ever i run into any of those girls or if ever they say something to me i'll be ready to say something back and if ever you have any problem with anyone else i'm i'm ready to stick up for you it's like
S0202	do you know
S0208	i have to live through this year of be naïve and be the sweet little shy girl or whatever to actually realise that life doesn't work like that you can't be nice to everyone and not everyone's gonna like you and i have to learn that but i learn it from you because my parent have give me a shelter upbringing and i have have that all through my life because i've never have to live through it do you know what i mean
S0202	yeah
S0208	so like what i live through with like yeah fair enough it be awful but it be nothing compare to this last year that we've live
S0202	yeah
S0208	and i'm gonna say you've live because i know it be ten time worse for you than it be for me but i want you to know that i'm i'm ready to stick up for you
S0202	i know what you mean
S0208	in the way that you want me to
S0202	do you know what i hope you never have to
S0208	i
S0202	for my sake
S0208	i hope i never have to but
S0202	cos do you know what like i i
S0208	it's gonna happen all through life and it's gonna happen to me
S0202	of course it be
S0208	it's gonna happen to you it's gonna happen to everyone
S0202	the thing be like the thing that bother me the most about the whole situation be that they didn't know me they be make all this judgements judgements about me they and from this one status that i put on facebook that i delete straight away which should have tell them everything they should know i apologise to at the ball
S0208	yeah
S0202	and i make this effort and i've make this effort from september and blah blah like they didn't know me like they didn't know anything about me and they be make these judgements about me and i think that's what that be the hardest part and i didn't think until later well actually they don't know me and they're make these judgements so what do that make them like they don't know anything about me they don't know who i be they don't know what i've live through they don't know my life they don't know
S0208	no
S0202	anything they don't know me personally they don't know my like or dislike
S0208	but
S0202	all they know be what they see
S0208	have say that and all that you've live through and live through that and the way you deal with things be go on the defensive and defend yourself and show your side of the story my way of deal with stuff like that be very different
S0202	mm
S0208	rather than immediately defend myself what i do be i i mull it over it build deep inside of me and then one day i snap
S0202	yeah
S0208	and i fuck i mean i fuck snap like no one want to be there when that happen
S0202	mm
S0208	but because i be alone when it do happen i think that's why all this shit happen like to me personally because i inflict all of the things that i have on myself and i think that's that's i mean that be the worst way of deal with things but i'm very much like my dad
S0202	yeah
S0208	in that sense of things because
S0202	you just worry
S0208	he's
S0202	and it build up
S0208	he let it build up he he won't say anything he won't do anything he won't act but he'll let it build up and i'm very much like him in that sense not say that he's bulimic or depressive or anything
S0202	you're not bulimic
S0208	no i know i'm not but you know
S0202	i know what you mean
S0208	i invert it on myself
S0202	i worry about you so much
S0208	but now i
S0202	when you tell me that
S0208	feel like i'm i'm not gonna do that to myself anymore because it's not me that's the problem it be them the whole time
S0202	i'm so glad that you've you've tell me what you've tell me because like ever since you you open up to me and tell me that i've do nothing but worry about you
S0208	i'm sorry for do that to you
S0202	no mm babe don't be stupid like cos when you tell me i be i be in a state of shock and face that i say to you you shouldn't do that why be you do that like i reprimand you straight away and i felt bad for do that because that's not how you should deal with it you should do this and you should do that and blah blah but i didn't know what to say i didn't know what to do and i be just like look and all i could say to you be look whatever you do i'm here and like i felt bad for say that as well because i felt well no she shouldn't be do that and i should tell her that but i do tell her that and then i be think well i shouldn't have say this or should have say that and
S0208	no there's nothing
S0202	and then ever since then
S0208	you can say to anyone
S0202	i know
S0208	when they tell you something like that like
S0202	but
S0208	i shouldn't have put you in that even though you be
S0202	no you're my friend
S0208	no but
S0202	if anything like that ever happen i want you to tell me like
S0202	don't no listen to me
S0208	you be my closest friend
S0202	don't ever feel like you need to be drink to tell me shit like that ever
S0208	okay
S0202	because it just it i don't care whether you've get warts grow out of your fuck face whatever you problem you've get
S0208	i know it's just
S0202	you should come to me and tell me because
S0208	well
S0202	i might not be able to help but i can at least support you
S0208	i be so ashamed at it and the fact that it be happen and i be so ashamed that i'd go back to that after have it happen before i be so ashamed at myself that i felt like the only way i could genuinely get it out be if i be drink and i wouldn't have any inhibitions or anything but genuinely you be my closest closest friend and i would tell you anything but i felt bad at the way that i do it because i felt like i owe you more than tell you my deepest darkest secret when i be drink i felt like i owe it to you to tell you when i be sober
S0202	mm
S0208	and like i felt awful at the way i spring it on you when we be both drink we have no real way of deal with it and i felt awful at the fact that that's the way it come out and i be like you deserve
S0202	it
S0208	more as a as my closest friend than say that
S0202	it it doesn't matter how it come out as long as you tell me that's all i ask like i can't help you if i don't know and like you can't help me i you don't know my shit and it's
S0208	it's happen exactly three time since i've be home and all of that be in the month of june
S0202	i'm so glad that
S0208	so nothing since july or august or
S0202	i'm so glad that you're okay though
S0208	a bite of september
S0202	cos ever since you tell me all i've do be worry about it and worry about you and
S0208	well i feel like since i've be back in my home environment and i've be with cos i think as sad as it be he's he be the most important person in my life
S0202	of course he be
S0208	but in different ways so like you be a very very like you're more important to me than
S0202	i don't think i'd compare myself to at all
S0208	my friends in france like i need you to know that like your opinion of me count more than anything that or or anyone could tell me like i trust your judgement more than anyone but be different obviously it's a guy he's my boyfriend
S0202	it's different it's different completely different
S0208	but i guess since i've be back with him and it's actually be me with him and it's not a limit the amount of time it's not a week and it's a good three months and it's a good you know of time
S0202	it's not even the same it's a nice environment
S0208	i've calm
S0202	non stress environment
S0208	i've calm down and i haven't be stress and i haven't have worry or since i saw my sister and it's be fine but like honestly i think it's just cos i've be away from him like the only person whose opinion of myself and my body matter because like it do get away with yourself like when you be say when we go to the gym and we see those really skinny girls always do stuff
S0202	peacocks
S0208	and like we make joke about it but secretly i'd be die inside i'd look at all those people and i'm like what the fuck be i come here work my arse off for when i can't even look like them
S0202	excuse me hello
S0208	no i know you say that but people have different visions of their own body
S0202	yeah but do you think i'm put it on you you've see how many time when i get dress and i'm just like i don't wanna wear this and i don't wanna wear that cos i just i look at myself in like i might have i don't know but i look in the mirror at myself and i just like now i feel self conscious where i'm sit
S0208	no but
S0202	like my weight
S0208	no
S0202	bother me so much
S0208	shut up
S0202	and i can't
S0208	no
S0202	no but seriously
S0208	no
S0202	i can't even
S0208	shut up
S0202	begin to explain how much
S0208	no
S0202	how much it bother me
S0208	you need to be quiet now
S0202	but how much do you think it bother me
S0208	no i'm
S0202	go to the gym and see that see them girls like that
S0208	i'm talk now i'm talk now you put yourself down so much but the thing be you always compare yourself to me and i'm not say that in a nasty way
S0202	i don't compare myself to you i compare myself to fuck ridiculous things like celebrities and
S0208	i'm not put you down by say that but i know that you do it i see you do it when i come in wear an outfit for a night out and you're wear yours i see you look at me but the thing be no one's perfect everyone have their imperfections but i need you to stop look at me and make little joke that maybe make yourself feel better not in a nasty way to me but say oh yeah you're small it's cos you're small all that kind of stuff it doesn't hurt me like that's not why i'm say it but it put you down whether you do it on purpose or not because i look at you and you're everything i've ever want as a person you're outgo you're so smart and beautiful and naturally lovely but you have this bodacious curvy womanly look that i have always want that i'll never have because of my build and that's just the way it be but you look at me and you see everything that you're not i'm small and i have a completely different build to you but you always everyone always compare themself to something that they can never be and i just i just wish that you would see that and know how beautiful you be not only to me as a friend but to complete strangers who look at you and envy you and be jealous be literally jealous because of how beautiful you be and how perfect your body be like you have such right i'm gonna go for it you have perfect tits
S0208	okay your shoulder no matter how much you're like oh my shoulder be too big shut up because you're not
S0208	they be perfect in comparison to your body and your boob and your waist go in so much and you have perfect curve in an arse it's like it's like look at iggy azalea
S0208	but you have the tits that go with it
S0202	mm
S0208	and it's so irritate because
S0208	i've always want boob
S0202	tits
S0208	but a bum as well because i know that i'm petite but i'm a kind of curvy petite
S0202	well
S0208	that's really weird because
S0202	it's not weird
S0208	most petite people's i i think of petite and i think of small boob small body
S0202	you've not get small boob
S0208	but it's all in proportion whereas mine i'm average i'm not gonna lie i'm average
S0202	mm
S0208	i'm alright but i've get the curve that go with it but not the kind of arse that go with it
S0208	like everything's kind of just out of proportion with my body but that's the kind of thing that when you look at me you don't see my insecurities but it's the same with me i look at you and i don't see your insecurities because i don't know what the fuck you bang on about all the time
S0208	because i literally look at you and i'm just like what the fuck be you talk about now
S0202	and i feel the same when you fuck say the same shit
S0208	that's what i mean it's like we have to start understand each other rather than look at each other and we're like just block it out because i'm not gonna lie sometimes when about your body or you look yourself in the mirror i kind of block it out
S0202	same
S0208	i look at you
S0202	be you be serious like or whatever
S0208	and i'm just like i'm just gonna sing a song in my head cos i'm just gonna look at you and put wiggle wiggle wiggle next to it
S0208	and just watch you look at yourself and just be like yeah
S0208	that's fine and then you turn around and look at me and i'm like yeah yeah i agree i'm just like what's she talk about
S0208	have i agree to have a threesome what have i agree to
S0208	i just i need i'm make a joke out of it but this be dead serious
S0202	yeah
S0208	i need you to stop
S0202	i need you to stop
S0208	and hear this from me okay
S0202	i need you to stop
S0208	i've get over
S0202	about your shit
S0208	my problems but i've live through problems and i need you to stop before you get to where i be okay
S0202	do you know what a weird thing be do you know up until i be seventeen i think i be god's gift i think the most beautiful woman in the world i think i be gonna be famous i think i be gonna be a model i think i be amaze
S0202	and then this one girl don't even know her name and don't even remember her bebo name
S0202	she be on bebo
S0208	i use to love bebo
S0202	same yeah i don't even remember anything about her but all i remember be her say fuck hell look at your muffin top
S0208	oh bitch
S0202	and from that moment on i've be insecure but in a way i think it be a good thing because i be so sure of myself and think i be this amaze person i think i be so beautiful and i be so full of myself and so stick up my own arse like she do bring me down to earth but then she introduce all these insecurities as well and i don't even know who this girl be
S0208	yeah
S0202	i don't even remember her name like
S0208	but there's a difference between be confident in yourself and be arrogant and be confident in yourself and be insecure you just have to find that balance
S0202	mm
S0208	it's like well
S0202	everyone think i'm confident until i'm a friend
S0208	no
S0202	and then they realise that i'm not
S0208	that that's what i think about you and why i be so i don't so bad
S0202	thank you
S0208	but i think one of the reason be that i've always be pretty confident in myself like i have always just like not care well i say that apart from a few hiccup along the way i've always just sort of not care and i've be like this be who i be and no matter how much i diet and no matter how much i do sport my body just never change so like whatever but then when i come to leeds and like i find you and like how confident you be and how confident she be and stuff it just sort of make me think about little things that i'd never think about before it just make everything go into like overdrive which i'm sure be what's happen with you as well like you just look at other people and just
S0202	fake it until you make it
S0208	exactly
S0202	like you fake like you'd think he'd be the most confident guy in the world he be the most insecure person i've ever meet other than myself
S0208	the same i would never ever think that about him
S0202	but how confident do he come across
S0208	mm
S0202	because he fake it and he's always say to me fake it until you make it
S0208	that's
S0202	that be his catchphrase like if you be
S0208	i've hear that
S0202	gonna be a tv show presenter that would be him
S0208	and fuck cheesy
S0202	no but seriously
S0208	i can imagine him as a sport commentator
S0208	on like a news channel it's like remember guy fake it until you make it
S0208	i can actually see him do that
S0202	go like that and wink
S0208	yeah
S0202	like anchorman
S0202	except can't grow a beard or a moustache
S0208	yeah
S0202	cos he's not manly enough
S0208	neither be his beard grow here
S0202	hi five to boys
S0208	but no like i know we're all girls and we all live through it and everyone have their own problems and their own insecurities but as much as i'm such a hypocrite say this because i don't actually believe it in myself but i will always put it out there
S0208	like to when she's always like i always think that guy be gonna think of me as a child when they look at my body
S0202	she say that to me as well
S0208	and i'm not gonna be rude i think that when i look at her body
S0202	yeah me too
S0208	but
S0202	i would never say that to her
S0208	i will always promote to her be like if you're confident in yourself guy will feel that guy will think it's sexy it only become a problem when you show that it's a problem
S0202	mm and voice it
S0208	exactly so it's like if you tell people that you be happy with the way that you be if you like you're happy the way you be no one will give a shit like literally no one will even notice
S0202	we should like go to the
