S0615	so it say in here to only give them food at lunchtime to start off with a bottle at every other time
S0525	ah
S0615	morning breakfast tea and bedtime
S0525	yes i think that's what i do with you i think i just feed you at lunchtime and then erm probably and breakfast be your next one oh i can't really remember
S0615	well what do i do if he wake up in the middle of the night
S0525	well you don't don't give him
S0525	don't give him a meal
S0615	well obviously not
S0525	but yes he can still have some milk but why don't you try water and see how that's when i use to give you
S0615	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	erm those herbal juices instead
S0615	yeah
S0525	which be that like do they still do that it be like a powder that go in the water
S0615	i think so yeah
S0525	so it's really water so it's just the case of erm if they're not really hungry they'll go back to sleep on it
S0615	mm yeah yes okey doke we'll see yes i've get freeze in the ice cube trays there
S0525	oh have they well that's the easiest way to do it because erm you know once you've make an apple he's only gonna have a tiny bite of it
S0615	mm hm yeah yeah one to two teaspoons
S0525	do they tell you what to do with it there cos i i didn't add anything i just
S0615	one to two
S0525	i'd just add maybe a drop of water
S0615	yeah
S0525	when you mash it and when you boil it and obviously as it boil it go to a mush
S0615	yeah
S0525	just reduce it down in a pan that's all
S0615	fruit
S0525	and i don't
S0615	first the baby should have puree of fruit like apples and pears
S0525	do they puree it as well or do they just do they actually put it in the machine to to blend it or do they just leave it
S0615	erm i don't know after the first few weeks your baby can graduate to either raw mash or puree fruit da da da da da nope make the rice or puree fairly wet and soft at first
S0525	mm
S0615	yes mix the puree in a plastic removable top on a feed bottle which have be sterilise hold your baby comfortably on your lap or sit her in a baby chair it would be better if both of you be protect against spill choose a time when your baby's not frantically hungry maybe give her some milk first to particularly satisfy her she will then be more receptive to the new idea mm special wean spoon can be buy
S0525	crikey what's wrong with little plastic spoon we use to have
S0615	mm start by give just one solid fee during the day at lunchtime yes apple choose a sweet variety of eat apple put into a heavy saucepan with four to five tablespoons of water so yeah
S0525	mm hm
S0615	heat and then or steam for the same amount of time puree
S0525	oh they have puree it after that
S0615	if steam add some of the boil water from the bottom of the steamer to thin out the puree also apple and cinnamon as well i'll have some of that a bite for a bite for me
S0525	and graduate to apple crumble then can't you
S0615	yes he'll be on that in no time that's good
S0525	so you you've get the top of your magimix the small magimix
S0615	yeah i could just do it in there couldn't i
S0525	yes
S0615	i've get a handheld one as well like a blitzer thing
S0525	oh have you
S0615	yes but then i'll there's no need to sterilise those
S0525	just wash them really well i mean you this you're come to the point where
S0615	well yeah
S0525	they're eat now and and
S0615	mm
S0525	you know
S0615	he's get his hand in his mouth all the time his hand aren't sterilise
S0525	no no i mean you're you're get to the the point the stage now where you haven't get to sterilise
S0615	mm
S0525	er yeah you just need to be very clean so if you've wash something in the dishwasher
S0615	yeah
S0525	that's practically sterilise it anyway
S0615	mm
S0525	no i never sterilise anything cos i i have erm a baby blender but i didn't have anything else at the time i didn't have er the bamix or the
S0615	yeah okay
S0525	magimix and it be a it be only it be about that big
S0615	mm
S0525	but it be like with the magimix the blade's almost as big as the bowl
S0615	oh okay
S0525	so it really do cos i find i've get a handheld one a magimix but if i if i use that for soup i've get
S0615	yeah
S0525	load of lump in it but if i stick it in the magimix
S0615	it do it
S0525	it's completely smooth
S0615	okay
S0525	yeah so if if you're gonna be do them if you're gonna be bother to use it you know you may as well do two or three apples
S0615	yeah
S0525	and fill an ice cube tray do your pink ladies they're fine
S0615	okay yeah i think with the erm hand one i've get a yeah like the bamix i've get one of those

S0615	it's all a bite
S0615	it's all a bite like that maybe a few years maybe when she's actually marry to him she'll find that very beneficial but at the moment
S0525	well i'm get
S0615	no i think they need to still be work at a distance away from each other cos the more time they spend together the more they don't like each other
S0525	it's like that be it

S0525	really
S0615	flight accommodation and excursions he say obviously it's a three four star hotel it's not a five star hotel
S0525	well that's okay we should do that i haven't get a big budget these days either

S0615	okay
S0525	she have short on she must have be freeze and she be on crutches

S0525	she have short on so all her knee be be out and she come in and straightaway the teacher say well you shouldn't be here you you know you've get to go home
S0615	yeah
S0525	and her mum be with her and erm she say well i don't think our insurance cover you to be in the build
S0615	oh wow okay
S0525	well you know fair comment cos i i remember that happen when
S0615	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0525	you know break his leg at work erm and she say i don't think it it cover you and her mother come in and say well she's still gonna be on crutches for three months now
S0615	oh dear
S0525	so what so say okay well you can stay
S0615	yeah
S0525	i'm gonna leave er er but you're not to get up or move or leave this room
S0615	oh
S0525	so we all have our tea break we bring our tea in so we could all sit with her and
S0615	sit with her yeah
S0525	yeah but it be erm
S0615	oh dear
S0525	i don't know if she's gonna hobble in every time like that
S0615	mm
S0525	but she's she's very young to have a knee operation and she do tell me she be have it
S0615	well maybe it's fix while she's young
S0525	yeah
S0615	so it's take quicker to so it take less time to heal and
S0525	yeah
S0615	those sort
S0525	somebody else turn up half an hour late because of the traffic i didn't have to do my sign with who only get four out of fifteen so me and have get ten each
S0615	oh dear
S0525	we be much better so we're do fingerspell and then she be teach us the time she didn't then she say because like i say she sit in two row and one of us have our back to her
S0615	mm mm
S0525	so she sign to the person opposite and they sign back to us she say right i'm gonna do time now so i'm gonna give you some time and you have to sign it back and then she realise that we only know half past and hours
S0615	okay oh okay
S0525	so she be try to teach us she go there's so many different ways of do time so she say nobody like any of them
S0615	no
S0525	so we be do for one o'clock we bring it we be bring it from the cheek cos we be tell that age be from your nose
S0615	yeah yeah
S0525	money's from your chin
S0615	mm
S0525	time be from your cheek so we would go one o'clock like that
S0615	mm hm
S0525	two o'clock three o'clock she oh there's a rainbow out there she just do erm
S0615	oh
S0525	she just do one one o'clock to do it like that which be fine
S0615	yeah
S0525	and then we we do half past the same so that be
S0615	mm
S0525	half past one erm and that be all we do and then she she do that for quarter past
S0615	okay
S0525	and that's for quarter to
S0615	yeah
S0525	so you're just point to where the she go imagine that's an arrow and you're just point to where
S0615	yeah
S0525	she do it all sign so
S0615	but it's you it's
S0525	i understand
S0615	to you not to the person
S0525	yeah yeah she say so imagine you've get the clock in front of you
S0615	mm
S0525	and you're so your quarter past three and then quarter past five quarter past nine yeah
S0615	mm
S0525	or quarter to twelve
S0615	mm hm
S0525	so she say you know do it and then it's no it's just she move the hand away completely so it be just that one
S0615	oh
S0525	so i think erm and then she's do and then we do ten past so you've get the sign for ten which be that
S0615	okay
S0525	ten past two
S0615	okay
S0525	ten past five
S0615	okay
S0525	so so you you're do your ten and then you're move your hand in a past motion so that make sense
S0615	mm hm mm hm yeah
S0525	you know ten and she go hold it kind of where your ten would be
S0615	yeah
S0525	so ten past ten to be harder ten to one ten to two
S0615	okay
S0525	so you but ten to
S0615	yeah
S0525	nine be a bite it's harder to get the movement with your hand or
S0615	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	ten to twelve
S0615	yeah
S0525	but i could see where she be go with that and load of people couldn't get it so you're either move like that or you're do that
S0615	yeah yeah
S0525	which make sense then we be do twenty which be twenty past two er twenty so she's do two
S0615	yeah
S0525	and make a nought that way to past but then the twenty to be twenty to one
S0615	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0525	twenty to two
S0615	yeah
S0525	twenty to nine
S0615	yeah yeah yeah
S0525	she go you've just get to practise this now with this with this hand movement we didn't do twenty five so i wonder what that would be
S0615	mm well what's twenty five
S0525	for erm a two and then a five
S0615	okay
S0525	but then a five would probably be easy cos you'd go five past or you'd get five to i'm assume we didn't get that far
S0615	yeah mm you'd just go half past then
S0525	yeah yeah well you'd you'd say cos it'd be you'd go like well five twenty five wouldn't you
S0615	mm yeah yeah yeah
S0525	you'd do it like that
S0525	but she be she's tell us so many different ways to what tell us
S0615	mm
S0525	she doesn't she do that for week whereas we be make the w sign and she say no cos they class that as fingerspell and anything you do that's fingerspell mark you down like tv we'd have make
S0615	okay oh okay
S0525	t and v
S0615	yeah
S0525	she's no use that or use that aerial sign she go it's a sign
S0615	oh wow okay
S0525	she go bsl be more about structure cos she's just put some people go i think be that a quarter where they go like quarter past and they do that
S0615	okay yeah
S0525	she go that's english cos you're do quarter and you're do past
S0615	mm
S0525	whereas bsl be quarter past be one word or one movement
S0615	yeah yeah yeah which you think it should be for
S0525	yeah so she say but a lot of people will go you know past quarter past like that
S0615	cos otherwise you may as well be spell it all out with the alphabet
S0525	well this be yeah so it make sense what she's say
S0615	yeah
S0525	and then the other thing she's gonna do next week now we're gonna be time to do this
S0615	okay
S0525	on the alphabet cos she's fingerspell every week to us
S0615	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0525	still she say your fingerspelling's really poor which it be so now we've get to go through the alphabet in and under ten second and i've not try it yet
S0615	oh wow
S0525	so p o p q r s t u v v
S0615	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0525	b x y i'm probably not far off
S0615	probably about fifteen second
S0525	do you reckon we'll have to time it but
S0615	yeah
S0525	i think if you get you'd have to get she go your practice be at home because you know i'm gonna time you
S0615	yeah
S0525	so i think if you get it you know a b c d e f h i j k l m n o p q what be that q
S0615	yeah
S0525	r s t u v w x y i think if i break it down
S0615	yeah into like threes and get the hang of it follow us upstairs do his nappy
S0525	because yeah cos she just do yeah she just do that for s she doesn't link in
S0615	yeah i know you've say that last week
S0525	cos yeah and she just do that a lot for e and people be go for x cos have spell to me she she spell out week she go w but she do x x look at me and then but i know be sign an e cos i'd be there
S0615	oh oh okay
S0525	hadn't be there the week before so
S0615	right okay
S0525	she be amaze i'd get i'd get what she sign but she didn't know
S0615	yeah yeah
S0525	what she be sign to me how weird be that
S0525	so i get that
S0615	that's a bite odd isn't it
S0525	yeah that be cos i could see the look on her face but she do it depend on how she's hold her hand so if her hand's
S0615	mm yeah
S0525	palm up instead of palm down she'll just put
S0615	yeah that's what you say yeah
S0525	cos she's just do it it make sense she's just do it quicker
S0615	well especially for a word like week that well if you've get w and k you're obviously not gonna have
S0525	well she be that's cos she be there yeah we yeah
S0615	i'm gonna have to put him down
S0525	rather than put her hand move her hand right around it's just w and the e e k be all yeah
S0615	yeah see how your little jab be do
S0525	but i miss she's i miss tuesday and get it i spell today i spell
S0615	oh
S0525	erm i didn't i didn't see her do she be too
S0615	ah
S0525	t u e s she must have get a bite i don't know she be kinda link it
S0615	and you just go t o
S0525	yeah i go in the wasn't sure what she'd do and i spell today but i didn't think i'd get it right
S0615	ah
S0525	and that's the sign for no she spell no out as well that be quite simple
S0615	okay yeah mm
S0525	i get so have spell no to me
S0615	yeah
S0525	and then erm then what what she do then be she be she still stand behind us
S0615	yeah
S0525	but she do the sign so when she spell out a name
S0615	yeah
S0525	she then do the sign at the end so the they sign to me
S0615	okay
S0525	so you know if you've get your word right
S0615	oh yeah
S0525	cos when she do the fingerspell as well when sign to me she's not allow to mouth it it's get to be it's get to go
S0615	it's get to be
S0525	so obviously she's do n a m e and i've
S0615	mm
S0525	write it down so then do the sign
S0615	yeah
S0525	that and we can mime it so you can say like that so er so that's how we know we be do it but obviously then she be do no now i know i'd get no right we all know it's only n o
S0615	mm
S0525	so we all know we'd spell it right and when she's do the sign everybody in that side be like look what what
S0615	mm what's that yeah
S0525	and she's do this she's do this sign
S0615	okay mm
S0525	no and so she come around to all of us then and stand at the head of the line
S0615	yeah
S0525	what have you be learn
S0615	ah oh no
S0525	sign and she say she say you tell me what's the sign for no so we all shake our head
S0615	yeah
S0525	and she's yes that that be correct but in a lot of the context if you really wanna it's like if you say to me can i go home
S0615	mm
S0525	no
S0615	oh
S0525	it's not you know not no or not no it would be that she's like this be what i would use with my children all the time no
S0615	ah okay
S0525	no
S0615	yeah
S0525	she say erm yeah so she be and then she saw what we'd do on time and she go well why have you only learn as far as half past and that be that so
S0615	yeah
S0525	she say i'm gonna ask how she would do all this
S0615	okay
S0525	so we've get a bite of work to do on the old sign haven't we
S0615	mm
S0525	we've get a bite of work to do
S0615	gosh you might do it a bite more in in depth a little bite
S0525	but i understand her a lot more this week
S0615	oh that's good
S0525	she sign
S0615	go through the alphabet obviously she need she's realise that rather than just move on so maybe it's not that bad if your exams
S0525	yes it's it's because she's not go over new stuff she's just i mean we learn structure and she say and we learn let you know let me know
S0615	mm hm
S0525	that be a so she's not sign all the word out she's give us phrase
S0615	which be yeah that's
S0525	cos that's that i be get cos that's wolverhampton don't forget
S0615	yes yes that's
S0525	well that no that's wolverhampton
S0615	that's wol yeah
S0525	but this way she be make like an l
S0615	okay
S0525	and then she do let you know
S0615	mm
S0525	let me know
S0615	okay
S0525	so we be get phrase so they be quite good to to follow and what be nurse something like that i don't know do the hat cos she say she felt like a nurse when er walk in with her leg in yes she do
S0615	i see
S0525	so yeah i do her understand her more but she sign a lot differently her hand seem to be
S0615	mm
S0525	a lot looser and she'll you know she'll tell you this be quarter past but then she'll just sort of do that
S0615	yeah
S0525	you know she's just she say you've get to do that you've get to loosen up completely with it
S0615	yeah
S0525	and and lip read a lot more with her
S0615	yes mm hm
S0525	and get the context from lip read erm because she use this for prefer and i've put for well that's like so i suppose it would be the same
S0615	yeah
S0525	but she's mouth prefer so sometimes you're wonder what she's sign she's do but well yeah it would be the same
S0615	do erm well do do the lip read do she speak when she do it
S0525	yeah yeah yeah she yeah
S0615	she doesn't speak do she
S0525	she doesn't speak but do speak and even last night a couple of time she just start speak
S0615	oh really
S0525	yeah i think she be lose the will to live with us and then she say i'm gonna stop because you all look like you're ooh be we pull plaster off
S0615	yeah they need to come off now

S0615	no not yet
S0525	oh that's a shame
S0615	mm we'll see where that go
S0525	yes
S0615	surely there's more than one socket in this room
S0525	probably behind the cot have you look
S0615	i can't put it too close to the cot though can i
S0525	well no but yeah i'm just say where there might be a socket on this wall
S0615	mm
S0525	i can't see
S0615	where be the socket where be it
S0525	so that just come on and off in the night
S0615	well yeah so i'll set it and i turn it on when we go to bed cos the heating's on before we
S0525	oh it be safe it's not likely to burst into flame be it
S0615	no
S0525	be you sure i don't like things like that i like to be if i've get an electric heater i like to be in the room with it the same when we have them at work they're they be
S0615	that's fine
S0525	dangerous
S0615	that's absolutely it's not high enough to do any damage
S0525	alright
S0615	it's only thermostat one the lowest set it go up to six
S0525	alright then
S0615	if it's on thermostat one it keep it at about nineteen degrees which he need it at cos i walk in the other day
S0525	i might come and sleep in here as well
S0615	at sixteen degrees
S0525	then if it's nineteen degrees in here at night
S0615	sixteen degrees absolutely freeze when i come in here the other day
S0525	oh
S0615	in the middle of the night and they say oh yeah sixteen degrees be ideal for a baby's room and i think no it's not
S0525	it be if you're a little boy isn't it it get too hot
S0615	it's not it's not ideal we don't like to be
S0525	have mummy put all those nappies on you again
S0615	why be you take them off you need them you need them for nanny's house
S0525	not all at once now
S0615	yes you've gotta change me this many time nanny don't eat them be you put them over your face a boo little toy auntie buy you this
S0525	so you're think if he's only gonna have half his bottle now he may as well have a bite of food as well
S0615	well i'm gonna try him on these level three teats and hopefully he'll take it all again
S0525	yeah
S0615	and then once he start to take all of his all of his bottle in a day then he'll stop wake up at night but then if that still doesn't work then
S0525	be you listen to this this be the plan for you
S0615	i think i'm gonna try in about well
S0525	this be the plan
S0615	if i don't start before four and a half months i'm gonna start by then anyway four and a half five months because it'll take him a month to get use to food so i'm not gonna start at six months and then he's gonna be massive
S0525	you'll be massive
S0615	won't you we're not wait that long no way
S0525	right well i send a message to your dad to build the fire and we haven't hear back so i imagine we'll get there and it'll be cold but nanny will get it go so don't worry we won't have to be cold for long okay he doesn't answer his texts do he he can't work his phone
S0615	no
S0525	never mind we'll go and we'll go and sort him out
S0615	well if he's if he's receive them on the internet and he's get wi fi and it'll probably take him a year to cope
S0615	and he's finish i'm go to the toilet
