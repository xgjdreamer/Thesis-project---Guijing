S0262	yeah
S0372	shotgun cartridges
S0262	yeah
S0372	and that be
S0262	yeah that be it
S0372	about the only sign of civilisation you find and we get to the place where we couldn't go any further there be a big high bunch of thorny
S0262	oh right
S0372	or whatever
S0262	yeah
S0372	erm
S0262	yeah you're not go to try and go through there yeah
S0372	er not to go without the right car
S0262	yeah
S0372	and the erm and er i'm sort of a valley in front of us and we're stand there and it be er well it look like the end of the road
S0262	mm
S0372	just look at the valley i say there there's step go in the floor of that valley
S0262	wow
S0372	look oh yeah and we scramble down through this really prickly scrub
S0262	yeah
S0372	and on the way down there be all these hole er about eighty centimetres across
S0262	wow
S0372	that people have rob grave that be in the cliff side
S0262	right
S0372	there must have be a couple of hundred of these and they be all
S0262	wow
S0372	freshly dig up
S0262	no
S0372	er and they'd all be plunder and you look down these hole and you could see that they i mean basically a shaft
S0262	yeah
S0372	that go into a sideways
S0262	yeah
S0372	cave
S0262	yeah yeah okay yeah
S0372	in the cliff
S0262	yeah
S0372	and that's where they put the body and the
S0262	yeah
S0372	grave goods and stuff like that
S0262	yeah
S0372	and er we get down and you can see the floor plan of these house have be cut into the basic rock
S0262	yeah
S0372	and then obviously have have wall build up on the outside of the wall
S0262	yeah right yeah
S0372	long go i mean they're about three and half thousand years bc
S0262	oh wow
S0372	and er so we eventually find er a track that go around this and we walk down to the sea and we could see part of the old quayside
S0262	mm wow
S0372	and
S0262	great stuff
S0372	drive
S0262	yeah
S0372	across and find i don't have you ever be to the salamis tombs of the kings
S0262	the what the one up the way
S0372	no these ones be on by er by famagusta
S0262	no i haven't yet
S0372	at salamis around there
S0262	i haven't be there yet
S0372	well they've get a a whole series of grave there that they've dig up the sort of noble part of the local cemetery
S0262	uhu
S0372	well they're not kings' grave by any stretch of the imagination but they must have be pretty rich noblemen
S0262	uhu
S0372	or businessmen erm and some of the design be of a typical erm archaic period design where you have a a ramp that go down
S0262	mm
S0372	normally quite funnel shape there be large step go down
S0262	mm
S0372	and then a square portico
S0262	uhu
S0372	go into a hole in the grind where
S0262	mm
S0372	the burial chamber be
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	and we're go along and we're drive through the i mean this absolute wilderness
S0262	yeah
S0372	and there's these pile of stone like domes
S0262	right wow
S0372	and we're think what the hell be these things
S0262	yeah what be they do there yeah
S0372	and a few people have try pull them apart where you can see they'd be rip apart there's nothing inside them
S0262	oh right
S0372	they're just like
S0262	just domes
S0372	just domes of stone
S0262	yeah
S0372	they're not even hollow they're solid
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	probably people on the farm have just put them there to get them out of the field
S0262	right yeah
S0372	you know except there's no field
S0262	right okay yeah
S0372	and we're park have a look at these stone and i suddenly see right next to me hide in long grass be this cube of rock absolutely perfectly cube it's not weather
S0262	yeah
S0372	nothing
S0262	wow
S0372	erm don't know what rock it be
S0262	yeah
S0372	but it's not local
S0262	yeah
S0372	it's this cube about i don't know sixty centimetres sixty centimetres
S0262	right yeah
S0372	and i'm look at it and i think this be strange and then in the grind i see the top bar of the of a grave
S0262	wow
S0372	and you can see the side wall go in towards it
S0262	right
S0372	but it's fill in right up to the top
S0262	right okay yeah
S0372	i don't know whether it's be dig up or not
S0262	yeah or what
S0372	probably have
S0262	yeah
S0372	in the past but
S0262	yeah
S0372	erm the thing be where there's one there's load
S0262	right right okay yeah so you're probably stand on a whole sort of cemetery
S0372	yeah
S0262	of them yeah yeah
S0372	a fascinate trip
S0262	wow
S0372	but as i say the locals have get no idea
S0262	no
S0372	they go out for the walk
S0262	yeah
S0372	they go out for the barbeque
S0262	yeah
S0372	they'll leave all their rubbish behind
S0262	yeah
S0372	erm
S0262	but they're not interest in explore
S0372	no
S0262	it or try to
S0372	i mean i've hear
S0262	understand it
S0372	i've hear the argument from my neighbour that er yeah well you have to leave your rubbish behind
S0372	why
S0262	why have to
S0372	cos it give the council workers something to do
S0372	they've get nothing to do otherwise
S0372	i mean he's perfectly serious
S0262	well mm
S0372	i mean er what
S0262	yeah that be just wrong
S0372	yeah crazy
S0262	it's just beyond me bizarre isn't it
S0372	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0372	i mean some of the some of the mentality here be totally off the wall
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	and they think it's perfectly normal
S0262	yeah
S0372	well i suppose they think they're keep the economy go cos this council worker that pick up the rubbish have get a supervisor
S0262	yeah
S0372	who's get a boss
S0262	yeah
S0372	whose cousin's one of their family
S0262	yeah
S0372	and he's be pay to do it
S0262	yeah
S0372	but
S0262	yeah
S0372	to think that they could possibly just remotely be able to do something constructive
S0262	exactly
S0372	instead of pick up
S0262	yeah yeah in fact i'm even erm surprise to hear that they even go and send people to pick stuff up because when i've be out and about it look like litter's be you know there for for age
S0372	well i think one of the biggest or the the biggest sinner on the rubbish disposal front be the army the turkish army
S0262	mm mm mm
S0372	we go out with the dog up into the hill up the back here
S0262	mm mm
S0372	erm and it's full of rubbish
S0262	mm
S0372	and you look at it and it's ninth battalion
S0262	okay
S0372	armour mechanise division
S0262	right
S0372	er have fourth foot and mouth division and
S0262	yeah
S0372	whatever they be call
S0262	yeah exactly yeah
S0372	so it's some
S0262	yeah
S0372	but it's all up all up there in turkish i mean i wouldn't have know if if i hadn't have be with
S0262	yeah
S0372	and 's translate and say look at these bastards and erm i'd say one of the things that be quite indicative it be quite funny i find a general's hat up there
S0262	oh really
S0372	yeah
S0262	a general's hat
S0372	brand well almost brand new not a mark on it
S0262	oh how funny
S0372	it must have
S0262	it must have just
S0372	throw
S0262	blow off or something
S0372	a general's hat but not in the middle of the wilderness where you can't drive anywhere i mean they've go up there with truck and just stuff
S0262	oh okay
S0372	and this general's hat be amongst it
S0262	how strange that's a bite weird isn't it
S0372	it's in very good nick shall i get
S0262	yeah
S0372	shall shall i
S0262	yeah yeah that be
S0372	we'll have to we'll have to look it up on the internet to see what kind of
S0262	so
S0372	rank
S0262	oh right i see and then
S0372	erm
S0262	you've figure it out right
S0372	and it's a very high rank officer's hat
S0262	that be so weird
S0372	here well then it look like it's never be wear
S0262	oh but god you actually take it with you
S0372	yeah
S0262	you're right it doesn't even have a smell to it do it
S0372	well
S0262	cos normally if they've wear it a bite it have that smell
S0372	well it normally have a a sweat mark on it and
S0262	a sweat mark and a personal smell to it
S0372	yeah
S0262	yeah fifty six how bizarre that's a bite weird isn't it
S0372	mm
S0262	that's a bite weird isn't it
S0372	yeah we're look for the rest of him
S0262	yeah
S0262	exactly that's what i be think they must have do him off somewhere and scatter him around the island
S0372	i mean you could
S0372	he didn't wear didn't get a chance to wear his hat but we find these
S0262	yeah
S0372	bullets with the feet in it
S0262	well what a good start point for a story isn't it you know
S0262	a general's hat you've gotta wonder but how's it go with the rewrite
S0372	ah well the rewrite be take its time cos i mean i've i must admit i'm a bite frustrate with
S0262	okay yeah
S0372	pay her pay her a year at two hundred and fifty quid a month she's copywriting copyread and edit
S0262	who be
S0372	well she's a scottish lady who be an english literature teacher
S0262	right
S0372	er who be work in a university in and then she go to work for a a train college in
S0262	right
S0372	teach english
S0262	oh okay
S0372	and erm we've be go through we've do the first eleven chapters
S0262	right when do you start go through the the chapters
S0372	well it be first go we start go through it about a month ago
S0262	oh okay so it's relatively new then in term of go through
S0372	it's relatively new
S0262	the process
S0372	but we find
S0262	yeah
S0372	a thousand mistake a chapter punctuation space format chronology
S0262	oh god
S0372	have come back say oh i've alter the order of the chapters so it run better now like yeah yeah okay fine then of course we're go through it now read it
S0262	bite by bite yeah
S0372	bite by bite sentence by sentence and i'm think hang on this doesn't make sense i think there's a mistake here
S0262	yeah
S0372	there's a word miss there
S0262	yeah
S0372	it's this
S0262	so what do you think she just didn't do it
S0262	or just didn't
S0372	oh just didn't
S0262	really put her heart into it
S0372	i think she didn't put her heart in it
S0262	yeah
S0372	i mean she come and she have some very lively discussions on the subject
S0262	yeah
S0372	you know we have some great days er but er i must admit i'm sincerely disappoint at the result at the end of the day so now
S0262	mm
S0372	we're go through it we've put the first eleven chapters we've weed out we chop it from a hundred and eighty six thousand word to a hundred and sixty five thousand already
S0262	that's really good go that's amaze that's a huge cull of word

S0262	yeah
S0372	that i can find
S0262	yeah
S0372	but it's
S0262	but it's
S0372	very coincidental isn't it
S0262	very coincidental yeah yeah they never do find that do they
S0372	and the more i go down that line the more sort of strange coincidences i find
S0262	mm mm
S0372	er all connect with this same bunch of people really peculiar
S0262	how do you if it's research the coincidences how do you go about look for those connections
S0372	er difficult to say really it's it's partly intuitive
S0262	be it pattern that come out at you that you kind of jump out and you think a pattern there's a pattern there
S0372	there's pattern that you see and you think well hang on just a minute i've see this somewhere else you know i've read the history book and
S0262	yeah
S0372	you know there's all sort of things that i mean strange things i have a pakistani gardener here
S0262	right okay
S0372	er
S0372	lovely guy
S0262	yeah
S0372	er we use to spend most of the time talk about cricket and drink coffee
S0262	yeah
S0372	er he do a great er job in the garden
S0262	yeah
S0372	he lay all my terrace for me
S0262	yeah nice one
S0372	erm er he look after the place when i wasn't here when i be still travel backwards and forward to germany
S0262	mm
S0372	but we sit down and he be say you know he get out of pakistan because the secret police and
S0262	mm
S0372	they be terrible
S0262	mm mm mm
S0372	er his family have be harass and whatever er and he tell me the story of the ex president of pakistan zia ul haq
S0262	right yeah
S0372	and how he die
S0262	okay how do he die
S0372	erm zia ul haq be er one of these politicians in pakistan who wasn't totally in the american pocket
S0262	right
S0372	erm so the americans be very suspicious of him but because he be wag war against india er kashmir at the time
S0262	mm
S0372	the americans be quite keen
S0262	quite handy yeah
S0372	to supply him with
S0262	yes
S0372	hardware
S0262	yeah
S0372	and at the time they have a lot of surplus hardware
S0262	right okay
S0372	er in europe
S0262	uhu
S0372	er because of
S0262	mm
S0372	the fall of the cold war
S0262	uhu
S0372	the end of the cold war
S0262	mm
S0372	and
S0262	yeah
S0372	you know they could see it come and plus the fact they just have two oil crises where their m48 tank which be petrol drive
S0262	uhu uhu
S0372	erm
S0262	couldn't go anywhere yeah
S0372	well you know they'd take them
S0262	yeah
S0372	twenty miles and they'd have to refuel
S0262	yeah exactly
S0372	them you know
S0262	it's just
S0372	they
S0262	too expensive to run
S0372	couldn't get the logistics
S0262	yeah
S0372	so they think oh we'll palm these tank off on the pakistanis
S0262	uhu make sense
S0372	so er at the idea be to float the pakistani's eight hundred m48 battle tank plus all the ancillary equipment and
S0262	mm uhu
S0262	tonnes of equipment
S0372	it be
S0262	yeah
S0372	big deal of a couple of billion dollars
S0262	mm mm

S0262	worth it
S0372	the right thing
S0262	yes
S0372	they er organise a demonstration of the tank's capabilities in a place call bahawalpur
S0262	okay
S0372	and erm ul haq fly down from islamabad to bahawalpur in a c 130 hercules

S0372	and on the same day that it crash george bush be make nominate for presidential candidate
S0262	yeah
S0372	in america
S0262	yeah
S0372	on exactly the same day and i think this be
S0262	yeah that
S0372	a strange coincidence
S0262	very bizarre that
S0372	and er the successor to ul huq be a guy call bhutto
S0262	uhu
S0372	er benazir bhutto's husband
S0262	mm uhu
S0372	know as mr ten percent

S0262	there isn't any
S0372	there isn't
S0262	no
S0372	it's just the bank and business and rich families do it and i can't find any other motivation other than the fact that they can

S0262	well i'm not if you see who think about who run the british press
S0372	well exactly
S0262	i mean it's it's
S0372	i mean this be media manipulation
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	and it's one of the other things that i pick up in my research you know they're go through the rockefeller memoirs averell harriman's memoirs erm er autobiography erm there be some really scary things go on now
S0262	mm mm mm
S0372	really scary
S0262	mm
S0372	things the dutch royal family be involve
S0262	mm
S0372	erm and then you get er the secret societies the bilderberg group and i mean i don't place a lot of
S0262	mm
S0372	credit in that crap but er you know there be obviously manipulations go on behind the scenes erm one of the things another thing i can't prove but it seem a little bite er too coincidental to be funny be colin powell the first gulf war
S0262	right
S0372	erm he disappear overnight he be
S0262	yeah he do didn't he
S0372	world famous he be
S0262	yeah
S0372	the guy he be
S0262	yeah
S0372	the
S0262	yeah he be
S0372	american hero
S0262	he be like the face of everything
S0372	yeah
S0262	for america for a while yeah
S0372	and erm from one day to the next
S0262	yeah
S0372	he disappear
S0262	yeah that's true
S0372	disgrace almost
S0262	yeah
S0372	you know and almost like he be strip of his rank and
S0262	yeah
S0372	throw out
S0262	he be ostracise
S0372	and i find out that erm a container with eight hundred million dollars which be mean for erm rebuild iraq
S0262	mm
S0372	disappear in baghdad
S0262	uhu
S0372	and also another container contain eleven tonnes of pure heroin from afghanistan also disappear
S0262	right okay
S0372	under colin powell's
S0262	watch yeah
S0372	watch or yeah his
S0262	yeah his
S0372	his his management
S0262	yeah
S0372	and i be sure that that be one of the reason or those be the two reason why he be dismiss
S0262	right okay
S0372	it's very strange that this very powerful elite bilderberg group appoint colin powell as a member
S0262	yeah yeah in the
S0372	four days after
S0262	first place
S0372	he be dismiss
S0262	yeah yeah yeah that's true that's very true i remember think that's really really weird
S0372	eight hundred million
S0262	yeah
S0372	dollars i don't know how much
S0262	yeah
S0372	eleven tonnes of pure heroin be but
S0262	yeah well
S0372	it's gotta be a lot of money
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	erm you know he join a group of millionaires he's
S0262	yes he just
S0372	just in the club now
S0262	do didn't he yeah that's it that be
S0372	he's get enough
S0262	that be it
S0372	that be his
S0262	yeah
S0372	entry ticket
S0262	yeah yeah yeah yeah you let those two go and you'll be set for life
S0372	yeah
S0262	and you'll live the best lifestyle you can imagine yeah yeah
S0372	can't prove a thing can't find anything more about him
S0262	no
S0372	he's disappear he's off the face of the planet
S0262	but you know what i mean though like in term of the film that i've see i mean i watch a lot of film and what you do be that you find the you're you're dig for the truth you know you're search for the truth but when you see lot of film you can see that what the scriptwriters do be that they transplant the truth into their own version of reality you know so they're make a story up but people be watch it go yeah there's something in the back of my brain that's
S0372	yeah
S0262	buy that i mean even see jam bond movies the latest ones
S0372	yeah
S0262	you can see how they're connect
S0372	yeah
S0262	reality or multiple realities into a storyline that kind of would be viable and i would say viable and i would say very entertain so lot of your ideas and lot of how you look for things
S0372	yeah but i'm do i'm do this as a fiction
S0262	yeah exactly it be fiction
S0372	mm
S0262	that's right and and that's how you're transplant your truth your search
S0372	mm
S0262	for truth into the into fiction
S0372	yeah
S0262	erm so that's why i can understand who these people who you talk to who say that they want to change you know
S0372	mm
S0262	the whole the
S0372	but
S0262	whole idea the premise of it
S0372	they actually travel on a saturday morning
S0262	yeah
S0372	to make gatwick airport a half past seven to talk to me about the change
S0262	yeah the i
S0372	and i send them the change
S0262	say that just it's like they don't get it
S0372	and never hear another dickybird
S0262	maybe they just think it be too hot to handle
S0372	i don't know
S0262	that they personally couldn't
S0372	yeah well
S0262	see a way to
S0372	well they could have easily could have turn around and say well you know thank for nothing
S0262	yeah
S0372	but nothing
S0262	yeah
S0372	zilch
S0262	yeah yeah no that be very weird well i think you just sort of put that aside
S0372	yeah
S0262	and just forget about it
S0372	move away from it
S0262	but erm in term of well certainly you're rewrite at the moment and it's gonna be a lot shorter from what you're tell me
S0372	no it's gonna be about a hundred and fifty page shorter
S0262	okay
S0372	it's gonna be about four hundred and fifty page
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	er but it's a lot punchier it's a lot faster
S0262	yeah
S0372	erm it's a lot bloodier
S0262	yeah
S0372	there's like twenty five thousand dead
S0262	yeah
S0372	in the london blast alone
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0372	erm and then forty five thousand dead a month in england from the flu virus
S0262	mm mm that's a lot of cgi if you're think of translate that into you know but that's all doable these days i mean
S0372	yeah
S0262	but yeah so the i guess once you've finish that when you've finish the book or when i don't know how you're think of do it but what i would advise you to advise anyway if you want to you know proceed with the idea of make into something audio visual film erm would be to write a treatment for it
S0372	okay
S0262	yeah okay
S0372	what's that
S0262	so the three major document in film
S0372	mm
S0262	be you have a synopsis which be the shortest
S0372	mm
S0262	so that's for the busy you know hollywood exec who just go i can't be bother to read it
S0372	mm
S0262	it's like two paragraph then you
S0372	it's your your elevator pitch
S0262	yes exactly
S0372	the ten second you've get to
S0262	while you have your pitch line
S0372	get them interest
S0262	and then you have
S0372	mm
S0262	your synopsis and then
S0372	mm
S0262	your treatment might be three or four page which be the basic outline of the story and then after that you'll have your script so that will be your draft script and that's the that's the documentation that you need with producers
S0372	that's like the book
S0262	yes it's like the book but obviously
S0372	mm
S0262	mostly dialogue
S0372	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0372	well i mean
S0262	yeah
S0372	the book be mostly dialogue anyway
S0262	yeah yeah that's that's what i think
S0372	mm
S0262	which be really good so erm so the treatment be the thing that i suppose in a way be the the thing between the synopsis and the pitch the elevator pitch and the actual script and the treatment be probably the most important part because if you're a busy producer associate producer that's the document you would probably spend most time on
S0372	mm
S0262	because you're not yet commit to read the script cos you can imagine how many script they get
S0372	yeah
S0262	you're not commit to read it but you're interest enough to know how the story will come out you know you will read it to the end and find out what what the end be so
S0372	but do you think hollywood be gonna be interest in duplicitous american conspiracies
S0262	mm well this be what i be ask about your search for truth and your write for fiction but sometimes i guess what touch a nerve with some people be that it's a little bite too close to the bone so if you scale it back into something that be adaptable
S0372	well i mean the the the quiet way have get it's not the american duplicity
S0262	no it's not yeah
S0372	no this one
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	be gonna be
S0262	yeah but even or even if
S0372	mm
S0262	you're look at a british producer
S0372	mm
S0262	and an american producer directors would be interest in it because for them it could be quite political
S0372	mm
S0262	you know so directors have like a totally different er cap on their head but producers be the ones who be go to go out there and search for the director and for the money
S0372	mm
S0262	so unless you get to a very famous director first who can then go to the producer but the chance be you'll be deal with producers first
S0372	i mean we we've have a sort of skip through the internet look for actors and actresses to er that would be interest in take take the roles in this and i think the the lead role the heroine have get to be sienna sienna miller
S0262	right okay yeah she's very smart yeah
S0372	yeah
S0262	yeah she's very smart yeah yeah she's
S0372	attractive smart could be
S0262	she's attractive yeah
S0372	erm
S0262	yeah
S0372	she would fit that
S0262	yeah
S0372	down to the down to er yeah
S0262	yeah she'd
S0372	make make to measure for it
S0262	yeah yeah well this be also that's what help be that you can you know you can put that down as your kind of you know your wish list of people
S0372	and erm what's his name wambaugh
S0262	who sorry
S0372	steve wambaugh he be a in the oh i've bloody it's get him and his sister both actors or both actors erm they be in one of the batman film and they do er a couple of other film
S0262	one of the batman film
S0372	w a m b a u g h
S0262	okay yeah i can't picture his face right now yeah so you want you're as the lead
S0372	as well he be i'm think
S0262	yeah
S0372	take him as the as as the detective
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	erm he's a bite young erm find another guy i can't remember his name now craig something or other but er erm
S0262	well that certainly help
S0372	yeah
S0262	i think that certainly help
S0372	well i mean who do we pitch to that's my problem and i've get no
S0262	you have to pitch to producers
S0372	no contact at all
S0262	yeah
S0372	i mean i don't know any
S0262	well okay let me explain to you what i understand and you see how it fit in if there's a square if there's you know as a peg fit into a a circle or whatever a square peg if it well whatever the expression be but anyway you see if you can take something from it and erm
S0372	do you want another coffee
S0262	yeah that would be great thank so what generally happen be be that you get to a producer through contact erm they will either listen to you from the start or they will just say pass the inexperienced producers who wannabe wannabes will take everything and they will just sit on it and not do anything because they have get no influence in the film industry but the professional ones with either go thank but no thank it's not my bag or i'm already up to my eyebrows in project
S0372	mm
S0262	or some be hunt they be already look so you be obviously try to find the ones who be hunt
S0372	yeah
S0262	and then what you do be you basically get a whole erm bunch of now this be the the hard part you get because you know that money be very difficult to get to make film
S0372	mm
S0262	unless you're in the hollywood system and we're not so erm though it can sometimes end up there but if you be in europe you're mainly look to source money from lot of different countries so you know that ireland have shannon as a tax break they offer tax break to filmmakers wales have tax break
S0372	mm
S0262	for filmmakers there's all whole host of reason why certain producers will put their hand up and say i'm swedish you're british you're german and then somebody over there and we'll get together as a little kind of you know pot of er producers and then we'll try and get the money from our respective countries that's the co production route
S0372	mm
S0262	so it's almost unlikely for a film of this magnitude that you'd find one producer who could get even if he's the top producer in the world
S0372	mm
S0262	i mean in europe he'll never get that amount of money from one country the uk just doesn't have enough money
S0372	well the beauty of this be
S0262	put aside
S0372	that it can be such a simple film to make
S0262	right
S0372	because it's all office bind there's no big action scenes
S0262	yeah
S0372	where you've gotta
S0262	yeah
S0372	spend many a buck on blow cities off the
S0262	yeah
S0372	map
S0262	yeah
S0372	i mean the explosion in london can literally be glass rattle on a table in a bunker
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	two hundred metres underground
S0262	that's true and that could be very suspense you know there's a lot of suspense in that
S0372	and they can watch it
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	on television
S0262	yeah it's
S0372	the aftermath
S0262	yeah
S0372	be just this big fireball
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	erm
S0262	yeah so it's
S0372	yeah
S0262	it's a thriller in that sense
S0372	yeah and if
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	you then sort of wanna turn around and say okay we're gonna pan the camera over the ruin okay you get some fuck footage of a russia or a
S0262	yeah
S0372	er whatever and
S0262	yeah
S0372	tart it up with
S0262	yeah
S0372	photoshop or whatever you're gonna do
S0262	well you see that's the bite the treatment be really helpful because what you've just tell me i didn't know so that's good because i don't know what you can envisage
S0372	mm
S0262	about this film cos i might see it differently
S0372	mm
S0262	cos i would might have think oh crikey it's gonna be lot of money yeah it's gonna be this and that and the other but your treatment could explain that it could say this be not a high budget film this can be do
S0372	it doesn't need to be
S0262	it
S0372	it can be
S0262	yeah
S0372	you know you can go the whole
S0262	but if it's a thriller
S0372	mm
S0262	you you know what you can see be like most producers would go what genre be this thrillers they know that sometimes it can be high budget
S0372	mm
S0262	but i mean they also know it can be quite low budget the suspense that come from
S0372	mm
S0262	thrillers i mean i love you know or i'm the kind of person who can be easily sit and watch erm you know blunt and what's and all of that spy stuff
S0372	yeah
S0262	and you know i
S0372	well my favourite film of all time be the original bbc version or do i say film series smiley's people
S0262	the cambridge spy oh which one
S0372	smiley's people
S0262	smiley's people
S0372	with alec guinness
S0262	yeah okay alright cos i'm just yeah
S0372	wow it give me goosebumps
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	it be just so clever i mean
S0262	yeah
S0372	the book be hairy and that just
S0262	yeah
S0372	encapsulate it
S0262	i'll have to see that again actually i haven't see it for a while
S0372	alec guinness be just so good
S0262	i'll have to see that erm but er smiley's people and so we know that thrillers can be do in in that kind of more key down kind of you know the the budget can be key down and that's why the treatment would be useful
S0372	i mean action the action's in the dialogue the action's in the interaction between the players
S0262	yeah
S0372	erm okay you need to take a location shoot
S0262	thank you so this be actually what you would write
S0262	this film be set in tell me
S0372	yeah i mean it's it's
S0262	yeah
S0372	set in
S0262	in yeah
S0372	london

S0372	erm
S0262	somewhere that yeah mock up for it
S0372	and er you know really you don't have to go very far
S0262	yeah
S0372	i mean you do all your spaghetti westerns erm
S0262	yeah yeah oh no that's not
S0372	yeah
S0262	a problem
S0372	erm
S0262	yeah
S0372	film erm i dunno things like chester town hall and chester police station and the old scenic things in chester
S0262	yeah
S0372	god they could just go on the bloody internet and download the crap
S0262	yeah but these days
S0372	don't even have to go there
S0262	people place like chester be cry out for film to be make
S0372	yeah
S0262	in their in their town or cities
S0372	yeah
S0262	because it's good business for them
S0372	yeah
S0262	you know people go on these kind of mad trip
S0372	and mad trip
S0262	go er
S0372	go to where

S0262	yeah
S0372	be make
S0262	exactly like
S0372	and everything
S0262	withnail and i oh we'll go to
S0372	erm
S0262	every pub in london or whatever yeah
S0372	and erm er hemel hempstead buncefield terminal
S0262	yeah
S0372	you know it's world famous for the two thousand and five explosion
S0262	uhu uhu
S0372	erm i go there two weeks afterwards i just couldn't believe it
S0262	so there'll be footage of that as well
S0372	oh there's load
S0262	yeah be load of footage
S0372	there's load of documentaries
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	about it
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	but i mean
S0262	yeah
S0372	buncefield doesn't blow up in this one
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	er the litres or thirty tonnes of ether blow up in the middle of london
S0262	yes
S0372	bank underground station and
S0262	yeah
S0372	outside the bank of england and mansion house
S0262	yeah but somebody would that be portray in the treatment that you'd actually see those explosions or you'd see the aftermath
S0372	do you need it
S0262	yeah
S0372	one of the greatest film i ever saw and i can't remember the name of it be a japanese film black and white
S0262	oh i know the one you mean
S0372	where
S0262	yeah
S0372	they cut the girl's
S0262	yes
S0372	those tendons at the back of her
S0262	yeah
S0372	legs
S0262	yeah though
S0372	and you didn't see it
S0262	yeah
S0372	they didn't
S0262	no you
S0372	you hear her scream
S0262	yeah
S0372	and all you hear be this knife go
S0262	yeah just
S0372	and the scream
S0262	and you know you know
S0372	and you know what have happen
S0262	yeah
S0372	and this girl come out
S0262	yeah
S0372	bleed
S0262	yeah oh god
S0372	and she
S0262	it's just
S0372	the back of her legs like that
S0262	oh that's just so horrible
S0372	and you go
S0262	oh no i know it's just so horrible
S0372	you can still get her knees apart to shag but she can't bloody run away
S0262	yeah
S0372	ah
S0262	oh god no i know
S0372	wicked
S0262	just so horrible
S0372	evil
S0262	that's so horrible but a lot of audiences be get more erm i would i suppose their voracious appetite for visual side of storytelling you know it depend on your audience if you
S0372	yeah
S0262	a lot of the time you've sort of get to think about what be the age group me i'd love that kind of filler you're suggest a younger crowd might be interest in the story but they might say to themselves actually i want the big stuff i wanna see what london look like when it's be pretty much obliterate you know but that's the thing about the treatment
S0372	mm
S0262	you're give somebody an idea of how it can be do we all know that this will probably be change the process of filmmaking just pass hand from
S0372	be do anyway
S0262	from one yeah
S0372	yeah
S0262	it's it it it be
S0372	but i mean it's
S0262	it come when it come
S0372	the the issue of show the damage there's no fuck
S0262	mm uhu
S0372	the issue of show the damage i don't think's a big thing because there be enough colour footage of the devastation in germany in the second world war
S0262	uhu
S0372	that could be trim
S0262	mm
S0372	to show flatten build
S0262	mm
S0372	and
S0262	uhu
S0372	whatever
S0262	uhu
S0372	er and all you have to do be photoshop a couple of bloody
S0262	yeah
S0372	london
S0262	yeah
S0372	lamp post or
S0262	well i mean
S0372	street sign into it
S0262	what they can do now
S0372	it's unbelievable
S0262	i mean it it look like it would be london
S0372	yeah erm
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	you know i don't erm i don't have any erm issue with that er you can show i mean i pick up one on the internet there's a tank of butane gas thirty tonne tank of butane gas involve in a derailment in america
S0262	uhu
S0372	that blow up
S0262	okay
S0372	it blow the camera off its tripod a mile away
S0262	right that's pretty cool
S0372	erm
S0262	yeah that must look really amaze
S0372	that be
S0262	yeah
S0262	the the
S0372	yeah
S0262	the actual petrol tank it be weigh six tonnes be blow
S0262	shit
S0372	three quarter of a mile through the air
S0262	bloody hell
S0372	it be in the middle of the desert thank christ
S0262	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0372	but imagine that in a city
S0262	yeah and that happen
S0372	and you imagine half of that down a tube station
S0262	oh my god no yeah that
S0372	i mean
S0262	that that look that you see
S0372	mm
S0262	those kind of visuals do sound quite appeal at the same time
S0372	london london underground
S0262	yeah
S0372	yeah i mean flame go up tunnel
S0262	yeah
S0372	they've do it with jam bond a hundred time
S0262	yeah
S0372	you know
S0262	but it still add to it
S0372	yeah
S0262	you know the visual side of it be like you do if you imagine watch it in the cinema
S0372	mm
S0262	big screen with the whole sound you know go on you know that would get your heart go
S0372	yeah
S0262	and that would definitely make you feel quite pacey you know so the
S0372	i mean right at the last minute
S0262	it's excite
S0372	just before this thing go up this copper come up to the tanker driver and put his hand on his shoulder and say ello ello ello what's go on here then
S0262	yeah
S0262	and then they see the flame come out of the underground station
S0262	yeah right yeah
S0372	boom
S0262	yeah
S0372	it's go and you think
S0262	yeah
S0372	you've save the day
S0262	yeah
S0262	yeah and he bloody hasn't yeah
S0262	no chance yeah exactly
S0262	yeah i think i think that would look really interest and i think a lot of people would not like i think like's not the right word but i think there's a certain kind of perverse need to see things like the london underground that's completely obliterate or be you know it's gonna be bring to its knees it's gonna be fuck
S0262	well the financial centre of london
S0372	yeah
S0262	be gonna go down
S0372	yeah
S0262	the bank of england be gonna be blow off the map
S0372	yeah
S0262	mansion house be gonna be blow off the map
S0372	yeah
S0262	it's gonna be about a square kilometre of build that's demolish
S0262	yeah
S0372	but a blast like that
S0262	yeah yeah and this be very er this be er it's symbolic as well you know i think it be er it it help an audience to understand that this could be one's reality if you be unlucky enough to be in london at that particular time shit happen
S0372	mm
S0262	and if you somehow manage to survive you might get to the top and look around and go
S0372	and the other half of the tanker go bang and blow you off
S0372	the face of the planet
S0262	yeah that's right and you go sail off that way yeah exactly so you don't really have much time to
S0372	no
S0262	look around and be a survivor yeah yeah so i think i think your visual side of it be a big advantage i do think it's a big
S0372	mm
S0262	advantage and i think that
S0372	it doesn't have to
S0262	never be scar of money i always er be teach that
S0372	mm
S0262	money will come if if the visual be there and
S0372	mm
S0262	it's the right visual for a director and now what we can do with cgi be just incredible most people want to achieve excellence
S0372	mm
S0262	in their visuals erm so never be scar of that money you know it's not about get a low budget film it's about
S0372	no i mean
S0262	the right budget for the film
S0372	would you would you recommend erm dunno get some visuals make up
S0262	mm
S0372	for the pitch
S0262	like a storyboard or something
S0372	mm
S0262	yeah yeah but mm i think the write word the treatment
S0372	mm
S0262	be the actual king yeah i think the
S0372	mm
S0262	treatment still be the standard document i think some people would like the visuals but most producers have work with directors and they
S0372	get a picture in their head anyway
S0262	they've already get it if it's well write they're kind of like
S0372	mm
S0262	go okay this person know how to write a treatment it's jump off the page like most
S0372	mm
S0262	i guess visuals can and er they'll either go yes i can see it or no i can't or go back and ask the person
S0372	can you give me an example of a treatment can you send me one or
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0372	yeah
S0262	i've get i've get the whole package of
S0372	mm
S0262	what the the pitch the the
S0372	yeah
S0262	elevator pitch line the synopsis
S0372	mm
S0262	the treatment and then there be like you know er off the peg software applications that you can buy that will format your whole entire script for you you could even i've hear from people who be adapt book into script that they can actually well it's not copy and paste but basically it take the dialogue
S0372	mm
S0262	put it inside proper kind of script out
S0372	mm
S0262	format and then you
S0372	like like like a like a play
S0262	like a play yeah
S0372	yeah
S0262	exactly and it'll do everything for you
S0372	he say she say
S0262	that's it
S0372	she say he say
S0262	that's right and all you have to do be then go over it and make it into what you think be the visuals you know
S0372	mm
S0262	because dialogue be still visual cos there's all the idea about your facial gesture everything be still in in that you know
S0372	yeah i mean it's it's i mean it's basically how i write the book erm be to go through and say well you know you've get a column here events
S0262	uhu
S0372	you've get a column here describe what's go on
S0262	uhu uhu
S0372	and then you've get a column here erm albeit a mental column of the environment and what's happen in the environment
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	er i might have overdo it with adverbs say you know he say it sarcastically or whatever erm tiredly or
S0262	yes
S0372	these kind of things but they're the expressions that you've tag on to the sentence to give the impression because it doesn't always come over in the dialogue
S0262	yes that's and that's the key to erm a professional scriptwriter i
S0372	mm
S0262	mean as someone who's get
S0372	mm
S0262	go through those experience be that adverbs come up less and less and what you're see be somebody who's describe the facial gesture so there will be you know when someone's tire you would rather put in that kind of squint of the eye
S0372	yeah
S0262	the flick of the lid the tension in the jaw you know what you're describe be what you see when people be tire
S0372	mm
S0262	but you're not use adverbs like
S0372	mm
S0262	tire and or yeah so but anyway that's a just a small thing the the point be be that you could buy this software application get it in there from the book once the book's
S0372	mm
S0262	how you want it get it in there erm and then what you do be you start well i would advise that you write the treatment first because you write the script to your treatment
S0372	mm
S0262	rather than the other way round
S0372	yeah sure
S0262	yeah erm mainly because the treatment be the be the be the skeleton of the story and then what you be do be you be basically use the you're use your dialogue and when you look at a script i don't know if you've read a script before for a film script but mainly it go character at the top and then er what they say character then what they say and it go
S0372	mm
S0262	like this for most of the page about less than a third of that page of an a4 page be description
S0372	mm
S0262	and it's something like internal external day night
S0372	yeah
S0262	it's quite basic and then it's something like something about the face so you're not describe the erm er the the well you can sometimes you might wanna describe the clock on the wall or something but most of the time directors be go to fill that bite in
S0372	mm
S0262	if they wanna cut to that clock back to you they'll do it and
S0372	yeah
S0262	that's their
S0372	that's their bite
S0262	that's their bite
S0372	mm
S0262	but what you're try to to i think be place the emphasis on the character because the director until he's read that script a number of time doesn't know the character as well as the scriptwriter because the scriptwriter know the back story
S0372	mm
S0262	know be have internalise the character
S0372	yeah
S0262	stories
S0372	i think that's the difficulty in in get the back story into the character because you don't have a lot of time especially in film to put the back story in there
S0262	which be why the character arc and i think that
S0372	mm
S0262	might be what those people be talk about be so very useful for you if you can stick to that to begin with erm you can break some rule later
S0372	mm
S0262	but the point be be that if somebody want to know erm be this guy for real have he get a professional script for me to read he'll he or she the producer will look okay can they do their sum do two and two equal four give me the character arc without that character arc they might not believe that you've actually get the rest of it right
S0372	mm
S0262	so it's kind of like a tick to see if you can get into the next kind of you know
S0372	into the next box
S0262	the level the next box
S0372	yeah
S0262	yeah so character arc be very useful and then you can break the that's the point you know once you've learn how to do it properly you can then break it so i don't know if you have much familiarity with character arc but i can certainly show you some what's really great be if you study some of the film that you love and then you try to break them down yourself you analyse
S0372	mm
S0262	them so like most play you have in film anyway you have three major scenes er act sorry
S0372	yeah
S0262	erm sorry i'm get a bite tire so you have three major act and the character arc can i have a piece of paper
S0372	sure
S0262	just to yeah
S0372	sure sure sure
S0262	i'm sure this won't be anything new to you but erm
S0372	well it
S0262	just for the
S0372	it probably will cos erm
S0262	just for visuals sake it's it's
S0262	useful to look at something isn't it erm so you'll have your three your three act let's just see we'll mark them down like that because the second act tend to be a bite longer erm mainly because you can use montage at the begin you can use lot of montage to cut to your story to start very quickly and then you know an end can appear like in a flash like what it just end that's it so this bite be the bite that normally take for age be the second act and this be where people tend to this last bite here lot of filmmakers get this bite wrong i'll tell you i'll tell you why be because it's difficult to do so anyway the character arc will normally be your arc so it will be and this be their own personal trajectory so here let's just say this isn't anything to do with erm happiness or it's nothing to do with emotion it's just basically try to show that you need to have them do something quite amaze you know something need to happen to them that really be obvious to an audience and that's why i think they use an arc be to show something quite big have change
S0372	well i try that with my initial character
S0262	yeah
S0372	to do two amaze things that happen to him
S0262	yes okay so plot those for me what what what be those two things
S0372	the two things be one
S0262	you can plot them somewhere
S0372	he be start off erm have a brainwave
S0262	uhu
S0372	and call his guy in on a sunday and say listen i've just have this breakthrough idea
S0262	uhu
S0372	and we're gonna do this that and the other
S0262	uhu
S0372	and they're all go oh fuck off cos you know it's a sunday and
S0262	yeah
S0262	we're we're not gonna bother yeah
S0372	and er one of them say no this be what we what we need be some clever bastard who do something like the laundry thing in northern ireland
S0262	right okay yeah
S0372	and this the hero's sidekick turn round and say er shut your face
S0262	right
S0372	and look at him
S0262	right okay yeah
S0372	and he say the laundry thing where they go round with a laundry boat collect the wash from the house and test it for gunpowder and
S0262	oh okay
S0372	and explosives
S0262	that's the laundry thing right yeah yeah
S0372	and then go back and arrest a terrorist and the terrorists all think they be be inform by their own people
S0262	yeah okay
S0372	that's it i didn't know he say well it's not exactly something that they publish in the newspapers
S0262	yeah
S0372	be it
S0262	yeah
S0372	can we get on
S0262	yeah okay
S0372	that's the first thing
S0262	okay
S0372	the second thing be that he's lose his wife in a car bomb
S0262	okay
S0372	and he doesn't know who do it it could have be a police job
S0262	which happen first the laundry thing be an incite thing and the erm incite
S0372	and the
S0262	incident
S0372	yeah
S0262	and the car bomb
S0372	the car bomb be the same night you learn about the car bomb but it be in the past
S0262	yeah
S0372	and because he get remind about his wife
S0262	yeah
S0372	he go on a drink binge
S0262	okay so the drink binge be really where it start
S0372	yeah
S0262	because you see him unravel or you
S0372	well you see
S0262	you see
S0372	no you see it first of all in his very very constructive very drive role be totally innovative as a detective
S0262	yeah
S0372	and then he go out and he think well because i've do this er what he's do he's examine paye record
S0262	yes
S0372	er in the town
S0262	yeah
S0372	where they've get a very very low immigrant population
S0262	yeah
S0372	and say well we're gonna look at anything that look slightly tint
S0262	right
S0372	that's get a new we er a paye account
S0262	okay
S0372	and then we're gonna take these seventy or eighty people and we're gonna knock on some doors tomorrow
S0262	okay right
S0372	because our our boy that we're look for be one of these i'm sure of it
S0262	okay okay
S0372	so that's his laundry scam be the paye thing
S0262	okay
S0372	but he say on top of that he say i'm go to go out he say while you lot get your head round who's gonna knock on which door and which team you're gonna do it he say i'm gonna go and talk to a couple of guy who let out cheap accommodation to tint folk
S0262	right
S0372	or alien he call them
S0262	right yeah
S0372	erm
S0262	yeah
S0372	erm and they just happen to frequent my local boozer or one of my local boozers
S0262	right and then the drink binge
S0372	and then the drink binge and he get give from the landlord who's a great mate of his he get give a erm a cd of a bootleg lead zeppelin concert
S0262	right
S0372	that he go back and listen to and he have a brandy too many
S0262	yeah
S0372	and the next
S0262	okay
S0372	and in that night this virus institute get break into
S0262	okay
S0372	so he's totally hungover the next morning and he's up on the phone and samantha say boss you'd better get in here
S0262	yeah
S0372	chief superintendent's just give you two finger
S0262	yeah okay
S0372	which what the fuck i don't like that guy anyway
S0262	yeah
S0372	erm
S0262	okay
S0372	so that's the kick off
S0262	alright so so what you would do then be you would decide
S0372	but it's not only try to present this guy as a clever bollocks
S0262	no
S0372	but also as a
S0262	he's get problems
S0372	flaw human
S0262	oh yeah he's get issue as well yeah that's right so you've get the cause and effect it seem like you accelerate erm from let's say quite a normal situation
S0372	mm
S0262	at the begin i think the hunch be where it start to
S0372	mm
S0262	kick in and this be actually what propel him to start
S0372	yeah
S0262	and then you would mark out for example you know it's quite easy to do if you think about film be as be let's say a hundred and twenty minutes these days because a page of a4 script that's format
S0372	mm
S0262	be about a minute of film time
S0372	mm
S0262	it's a rule of thumb but it do help you to understand that anything longer than a hundred and twenty page for a script you'd need to have a good reason why it's longer you you know like you're do a tolkien or you know you're bloody well you know
S0372	well i must i must admit i find the treatment of the tolkien film the lord of the ring
S0262	yeah
S0372	i find it totally bore
S0262	yeah well treatments be quite bore
S0372	i mean it last for no i mean the film itself i find
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0372	the action
S0262	the film's yeah
S0372	brain deaden
S0262	yeah
S0372	it be just fight
S0262	yes
S0372	where be the plot
S0262	yeah
S0372	and it think hang on this be a film for morons
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	the book wasn't
S0262	yes i know
S0262	no i completely agree with you i completely agree with you but what can happen be that erm what you wanna do so you normally have what be in it so you've get time here and you've get act there okay or if you want to do you can do time here which i'll guess be a bite normal and then here you can have the escalation of and you have to choose if you want to use the character arc about this man as a as the protagonist then you have to choose what really be the kernel of this person what be the erm the reason why he keep move along this trajectory what's the common sense of why he's go here
S0372	justice justice justice justice
S0262	so the search for truth yeah
S0372	yeah search
S0262	yeah
S0372	for truth
S0262	okay and then you can do
S0372	and and get justice i mean he's piss off with
S0262	yeah
S0372	you know give sort of car bombers er asbos and erm electronic ankle bracelets
S0262	yeah
S0372	so you know that's not
S0262	yeah
S0372	his scene and he'd rather
S0262	yeah
S0372	put them up in a market square and give them a thousand lash
S0262	yeah
S0372	erm he's one of the old school
S0262	he's hard talk
S0262	yeah exactly yeah
S0372	erm but he's be discipline out of that he's have a mottle career with umpteen disciplinary
S0262	uhu
S0372	erm review he's always get out of them
S0262	uhu be that because
S0372	erm
S0262	he's an alcoholic
S0372	no erm he be er second to erm five section d in six counties er during the terrorist uprise in northern ireland
S0262	okay
S0372	and he step a couple of time the wrong side of the law and these be
S0262	okay
S0372	true anecdotes from a mate of mine
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	who's a retire
S0262	i can imagine that to be true
S0372	a retire
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	erm
S0262	yeah
S0372	army major in
S0262	yeah
S0372	bomb disposal there
S0262	yeah well my dad be a lieutenant colonel and serve twice in northern ireland
S0372	yeah
S0262	so that's one thing
S0372	erm
S0262	i can understand yeah
S0372	you know sort of like fill fill basements with butane gas
S0262	yeah
S0372	and wait for the mix to go down
S0262	yeah
S0372	and bare bum and light the first
S0262	yeah right
S0372	cigarette and
S0262	yeah
S0372	boom oh that's
S0262	yeah
S0372	six of them go up in an own goal
S0262	yeah
S0372	yeah
S0262	yeah
S0372	alright
S0262	well so
S0372	i mean
S0262	shit happen
S0372	involve in things like that
S0262	yeah exactly yeah
S0372	erm cos he know that he can't get them cos they're the wrong side of the border
S0262	yeah
S0372	they're not gonna extradite them and if they do extradite them
S0262	exactly
S0372	what be they gonna do
S0262	yeah
S0372	they're gonna cost the taxpayer money and
S0262	yeah
S0372	whatever
S0262	yeah
S0372	and he's be haul up in front of his seniors for be or his superiors for be over zealous
S0262	yeah
S0372	but he's much love on the frontline
S0262	yeah
S0372	erm
S0262	so he's out to prove a point
S0372	yeah
S0262	that actually he be er he be very good at his job and he's prove his point
S0372	yeah
S0262	to his superiors
S0372	yeah and he's
S0262	yeah
S0372	literally
S0262	to get his
S0372	this anti authoritarian thing and he's also
S0262	right
S0372	get a flea in his head because the er the car bomb of his wife erm didn't turn up with any clue
S0262	mm
S0372	erm because er some of his serious crimes er investigations
S0262	uhu
S0372	might have erm tangentially touch some of his superiors er he's
S0262	ah okay
S0372	get the suspicion that maybe
S0262	yeah
S0372	some of them be involve
S0262	yes
S0372	and they be try to blow him up but she
S0262	yeah
S0372	jump in his car to nip down the road to get a bottle of wine for dinner for a dinner party
S0262	right
S0372	and the car blow up
S0262	right okay
S0372	and it be aim at him
S0262	okay so there there be in a way erm
S0372	yes it's dinner time i know
S0262	so all of these things what you've just mention
S0372	mm
S0262	there i can already see that there's you know there's quite a lot of erm strand to his let's say to his backdrop and his story his motivations his erm inner kind of conflict that's go on
S0372	yeah
S0262	but to make it easy for a producer to understand you have to choose one and you have to make sure that that come through in the treatment the director will pick up with the actors
S0372	mm
S0262	and they will explore all of the things that you're talk about of course cos that's the stuff people wanna see on screen
S0372	mm
S0262	you know they wanna see all this difficult stuff that people have to go through but for the producer they're not creative like that they just need one main trajectory that they can say this guy know that this be the most propel one that be go to make it believable
S0372	mm
S0262	for an audience so that's the type of thing that you know i would say
S0372	do you do the twin one do you do the hero and the heroine
S0262	yeah yeah you would plot both
S0372	mm
S0262	you'd have you'd have your protagonist your
S0372	mm
S0262	antagonist hero heroine and sometimes what you'll find be that you have something inverse arc so you might start up over here and it's go down like that you know and so
S0372	mm
S0262	some people might say okay that mean that something negative be happen and then it pick up i don't really care which way you look at it
S0372	uhu
S0262	the point be that it need to show a range of movement you know
S0372	mm
S0262	it need to show that kind of arc and it's nice if you can plot it out say you know if you break it down and your favourite film just any film and go okay i think the first act finish about here and i wanna know what happen there i wanna know that
S0372	mm
S0262	plot normally there's a jump here and this be the bite where things get hard cos normally around about here you need to start erm get your denouement or the denouement
S0372	mm
S0262	you know the brown here you need to start erm scaffold it so that people believe the end and what people tend to do be because audiences tend to be a bite thick they don't mm understand this bite they don't understand what that be mean what what it be they're not film literate enough to
S0372	mm
S0262	get that bite so what they do be that they start have to i suppose
S0372	recap
S0262	recap or make it slower or try to explain it which be the wrong thing to do in my view
S0372	yeah
S0262	but because audiences don't understand it they need an explanation but as soon as you start try to explain something to audiences either
S0372	yeah
S0262	they fall into i'm actually i'm quite intelligent and i don't need
S0372	mm
S0262	it explain to me or i'm still too thick to understand this cos this film just be perhaps a little bite beyond me
S0372	well it's like a joke if you've to explain it it's no good
S0262	right exactly
S0372	mm
S0262	thank you that's
S0372	but
S0262	exactly it it's
S0372	the erm
S0262	don't explain it yeah so the trick be here really
S0372	the plotline
S0262	yeah
S0372	run in two parallel thread the virus and the al qaeda plot
S0262	uhu
S0372	the virus thing almost come to an end you think oh they've solve that problem the animal right nutters have all be bump it or lock away
S0262	uhu uhu
S0372	erm and then they discover that the virus be still a threat because it's get out of the labs through this raid
S0262	uhu uhu
S0372	it's have an antigenic shift and it's
S0262	uhu
S0372	develop into something that's quite nasty
S0262	uhu
S0372	but it only affect darkies
S0262	uhu
S0372	or
S0262	uhu
S0372	over expose people
S0262	uhu
S0372	erm and er the bomb plot they finally get a handle on twenty minutes before the bomb go on
S0262	uhu okay so that's when the it's this be when the countdown you know of the clock
S0372	yeah
S0262	start tick
S0372	well i mean the clock's
S0262	yeah
S0372	tick all the way
S0262	yeah but this be when the audience feel an uplift of
S0372	yeah
S0262	kind of you know right okay i've get to pay attention now
S0372	jeez i've get to sit on the edge of my seat now
S0262	yeah exactly
S0372	cos something's gonna happen
S0262	yes that's right yeah
S0372	and then the denouement
S0262	yeah
S0372	the bomb go off
S0262	yeah
S0372	everything's oh fuck
S0262	yeah
S0372	that's the end of it
S0262	yeah
S0372	but it's not
S0262	no
S0372	cos actually the lift up again and actually catch the two ringleaders
S0262	right okay yeah
S0372	the technology and the chase be
S0262	yes
S0372	quite sedentary i mean there's no car chase or helicopters or snipers or
S0262	yeah
S0372	whatever
S0262	yeah
S0372	it's all do with stationary cctv cameras around london
S0262	okay alright yeah i get you yeah
S0372	er and local knowledge of the local plod
S0262	yeah
S0372	and they manage to bag these two guy
S0262	uhu
S0372	at the end there's a bite of excitement with the heroine
S0262	uhu
S0372	erm who dress up as a prostitute to lure this guy
S0262	uhu
S0372	out into the open so that they can bag him
S0262	uhu uhu
S0372	and they do and in so do they infect this bugger with the virus
S0262	right okay
S0372	and then they allow him to see his brief
S0262	right
S0372	and these people from the embassy
S0262	right
S0372	and whatever
S0262	yeah yeah yeah so
S0372	erm
S0262	he's yeah transmit the virus
S0372	so he's
S0262	right okay
S0372	transmit the virus to the right people
S0262	yeah yes yeah
S0372	and then they take him into prison to keep him in custody erm they cure him
S0262	right
S0372	er give him the chemical interrogation
S0262	yeah
S0372	which be totally illegal but they're gonna do it anyway
S0262	yeah
S0372	to get name and whatever out of him
S0262	yeah
S0372	and er at the end of the book they turn around and say well see there's another and doesn't know
S0262	yeah
S0262	that's so true
S0262	but normally the denouement as well be when somebody be about to you're you're gonna get that uppance you have a sense of it's almost like you're go to trick the audience you're gonna go yeah that guy be gonna get his comeuppance and then you actually be show that no it's not that one it's this one
S0372	mm
S0262	yeah so there's that sense of
S0372	mm
S0262	maybe in a way the heighten bite be be the bomb
S0372	mm
S0262	it's about here i'm just pull it back
S0372	yeah
S0262	a bite and then the rest of it play out as
S0372	mm
S0262	you explain you know but i think this be where we we see erm there's a change of gear and the audience be mean to engage brain at this stage
S0372	mm
S0262	to start try to guess who's the bad guy who's the real bad guy who's really to blame
S0372	well they know that all along they know who the real bad guy be
S0262	right
S0372	but they don't know how he's gonna get catch
S0262	right okay so where do you present that part which part of it for you be they know the audience know be it in the first act
S0372	the audience know about here
S0262	who it be
S0372	who the bad guy be
S0262	okay so you've gotta clock that point
S0372	yeah
S0262	as that's the bad guy and people know
S0372	the villain
S0262	yeah it's the villain okay
S0372	er because you're you're you be follow as part of the one of the thread in the book the bomb plot from the villain's point of view
S0262	yeah okay yeah
S0372	you've get that run parallel
S0262	yeah
S0372	to the police activity
S0262	okay
S0372	you've get that run parallel to the virus activity
S0262	yeah
S0372	you've get that parallel to the love affair between the
S0262	so
S0372	heroine and
S0262	it's like their cars come to er ward each other you know
S0372	yeah
S0262	their cars be set on a trajectory
S0372	mm
S0262	you know what the game be
S0372	mm
S0262	it's gonna be chicken it's either you know yeah you're gonna miss each other
S0372	mm
S0262	and someone's gonna get away the villain's gonna get away or the other one's gonna get it or they're both gonna get it
S0372	mm
S0262	or both of them put the brake on because they just don't wanna die you know i guess it's that win lose
S0372	mm
S0262	you know prisoner game or whatever it be
S0372	mm
S0262	so yeah that that also go into the treatment so in a way erm the i'll show it i'll show you one but if you can start to at least in your own mind start to have a very i think you have get a very clear sense of the plot now what you're do be you're visually show someone something different
S0372	mm
S0262	you're actually show somebody this character arc or character
S0372	mm
S0262	because you'll have both erm
S0372	oh no you're hungry aren't you
S0262	and you can always know if you've put too much information in because you can say break it down into a two hour film here be one hour and here be two break it again into thirty minutes
S0372	mm
S0262	here again let's say
S0372	yeah
S0262	thirty minutes
S0372	yeah
S0262	so you can kind of know if you're over write on one bite
S0372	mm
S0262	you can say this be my thirty page this be really good to get you start what even just think about time cos that's so different from people read a book they can take as much time as they want
S0372	mm
S0262	to read that book but as soon as you're in the cinema this be how long this film be you're gonna sit down and watch the whole bloody thing yeah that's how it go and people be pay their money for that so in your first thirty page let's say you've get a first thirty minutes of the film i've mark it there
S0372	mm
S0262	each minute something bloody interest be happen but you know that this be the most interest minute
S0372	mm
S0262	and that's the next interest minute and these be the point you mark in your treatment in your script of course you have to write all the
S0372	but thing be that erm in this character arc of the hero
S0262	uhu
S0372	for example erm find out about the bad guy happen in america
S0262	uhu
S0372	one of their drone pick him up cos he's use a bloody sim card
S0262	right
S0372	in the pakistani mountains
S0262	right
S0372	erm
S0262	that's that's fine yeah
S0372	he get it beam back to him as an email
S0262	okay
S0372	and they turn round and say well we've just do facial recognition on this guy
S0262	right
S0372	er the cia's computers have come up and say he's so and so
S0262	yeah
S0372	last see at the nairobi bomb
S0262	right okay
S0372	and then aha
S0262	yeah alright
S0372	nice we'll put him on the on the
S0372	on the white board
S0262	yes yeah yeah
S0372	er the other guy we can't identify the picture wasn't clear enough
S0262	right okay
S0372	erm so they've now get a handle on it but they don't know at the moment who the main guy be in britain
S0262	okay
S0372	he come to light through a prostitutes' ring
S0262	right
S0372	which be run through the job centre
S0262	right okay yeah no on this this be all great and this be all make sense because what you're what you're tell me in a way be cause and effect seem like the way you talk about things be this be gonna be lead to this and then that we'll have that
S0372	mm
S0262	and it's all a knock on
S0372	mm
S0262	it's all a knock on so this be the sort of plot detail
S0372	mm
S0262	and then i think what you need to do be just as i say you need to like pick out those most important i guess it's the most important bits of information if you have to say look i'm gonna give you erm the character not the storyline but the storyline but the character's arc in about two minutes i'll tell you this point this point this point this point and i'm do
S0372	mm
S0262	that's what a treatment be a treatment deal with brevity
S0372	mm
S0262	and it be succinct i mean it but it mean the same thing but you know what i mean so these things be quite hard to pull out particularly when you have write a book you've in the process of rewrite your book you're think about write a film script from it you know these character so well that sometimes it's very hard to choose which part be the most important
S0372	yeah
S0262	part so that's why somebody like myself could when you're if you wanna go ahead with it could start to actually go okay you've give me shitloads of detail but the bite that i think if you agree
S0372	mm
S0262	and you discuss it with me let's put this in as the most important thing let's then move on to this bite but that take a little bite of discussion from the scriptwriter
S0372	mm
S0262	what be the most important thing for this thirty minutes what's the next thirty minutes and the next thirty minutes and the next thirty minutes
S0372	but there may be two important things happen in the first thirty minutes
S0262	yeah yeah and that's when you have to say i can argue at the begin there's something that's important
S0372	well there's two things drive this guy one be
S0262	yeah
S0372	the loss of his wife and the other one's his sense of justice
S0262	yeah
S0372	there's two things happen along this line the virus and the bomb threat
S0262	yeah yeah which be your plotline yeah
S0372	which be your plotline
S0262	yeah
S0372	erm there be two character involve
S0262	yeah
S0372	drive a lot of this plotline through totally different directions
S0262	yes yeah so you might have
S0372	a civilian and a and a policeman
S0262	right
S0372	erm and erm you've also get this thing about field craft spy craft
S0262	yeah
S0372	erm underground agents or whatever you like to call these things
S0262	yeah
S0372	terrorists that have be sneak into the country to do nasty things
S0262	yeah
S0372	erm yeah i have i have a problem structure that
S0262	mm mm it be not easy to do when you know the story inside and out
S0372	mm
S0262	and you know the character it's extract teeth really it's
S0372	mm
S0262	decide which teeth you know which tooth be that i need to take it
S0372	which one's get the gold in it
S0262	yeah
S0262	basically yeah
S0372	mm
S0262	that's that's exactly it extract the the tooth with gold in it yeah i like that i think that's a really good way of remember
S0372	mm
S0262	er so that's what i can help you with when you you know you're in a
S0372	mm
S0262	position to to do that but i would certainly say i can show you a treatment sometimes the treatment can help if you've see the film and you know the film really well
S0372	i mean the problem i have i don't think i've see a decent film in about two years
S0262	okay so
S0372	erm
S0262	a lot of things on the internet these days
S0372	yeah
S0262	have be put up there so you can have one of your favourite film that i bet you have get the treatment up there i bet you it's get the film script up there i'll bet you anything it have
S0372	well it
S0262	yeah
S0372	it's a bloody old film the one the one that i think be probably the most significant film i use to use it for management train
S0262	uhu which be that
S0372	er twelve o'clock high
S0262	no i haven't see it
S0372	black and white american war film
S0262	okay
S0372	about the fly fortresses fly over germany and
S0262	okay
S0372	discipline and
S0262	brilliant
S0372	it's great
S0262	yeah so could you try and
S0372	and you've get this
S0262	plot
S0372	you've get this
S0262	plot it
S0372	you've get this real evil bastard and an american air force general say you know
S0262	right
S0372	erm i'm just take over this squadron cos they're all tire and they're get shoot out of the sky every day and
S0262	yeah
S0372	er the outgo general's say well you know you've get to give them a break cos they're really you know out of it and they're tire
S0262	uhu
S0372	and he's go i'm not give them a fuck break they've get a bloody job to do
S0262	yeah
S0372	get up there and do it and i'm gonna train them to be able to do the best job possible
S0262	right okay
S0372	er
S0262	yeah
S0372	and you've get these two field of thoughts that be
S0262	right
S0372	either poor little boys you know
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	they're
S0262	no no they're bloody soldier you know
S0372	they're soldier get up there
S0262	yeah train to kill
S0372	they've be train to be kill
S0262	yeah
S0262	oh train to be kill yeah exactly yes
S0372	it's what we pay them for
S0262	yeah so that's still a great way to start because you're learn the er and you know the way to break it down
S0372	mm
S0262	you know so i would still say that you could watch a film again
S0372	mm
S0262	we could watch it together i might plot it
S0372	mm
S0262	differently from you
S0372	i mean i have erm
S0262	you know
S0372	i have er er a plethora of film i could name as be some of the worst film i've ever see and the worst film i've see in probably five years have be the monument men
S0262	i haven't see it so i'm not miss out then
S0372	er george clooney and i mean it look like a bunch of hollywood actors that be run out of money run out of erm job offer who sit down in a café one day and say well let's make a film
S0262	the monument men
S0372	let's make it out of erm let's make it all about nazi germany and treasure
S0262	oh okay
S0372	erm
S0262	so we've get monument versus what be it call twelve high noon what be your favourite film
S0372	twelve o'clock
S0262	twelve o'clock
S0372	twelve o'clock be it twelve no twelve o'clock high
S0262	twelve o'clock high okay so what we could do be if you get that i could watch that i'd like to watch that
S0372	well i'll get it on the internet it's it's on the
S0262	okay
S0372	internet it's a black and white it's it's
S0262	well we can download it yeah
S0372	donkey's old
S0262	yeah how what what nineteen fifties
S0372	nineteen fifty two something like that it's cary grant and erm rock hudson i think
S0262	oh i love the sound of that cary grant and rock hudson wonderful and then you do erm plot a shit film and then what you would do
S0372	mm
S0262	be you'd discuss it and go
S0372	i mean this film's film in the dark so they don't have to have any background no scenery no nothing
S0262	it sound rubbish yeah
S0372	they erm have take a couple of photograph out of the archive off the internet show an american soldier stand in a church full of crate of loot artwork erm and then they've set up this
S0262	how rubbish
S0372	totally spurious bloody committee of so call experts which justify have old men in uniform
S0262	right
S0372	erm to try and fathom out what the germans have do with their loot artwork and the history be wrong
S0262	yeah yeah as it often be
S0372	the history
S0262	yeah
S0372	be totally wrong
S0262	in hollywood they have no
S0372	i mean
S0262	care
S0372	they've turn round and say well yeah okay i mean i know the history i've be to the place

S0372	mauthausen er
S0262	yeah
S0372	where they build the v2 rocket
S0262	yeah
S0372	erm be where they store the german bundesbank
S0262	right
S0372	that's where be lift by the americans with ten tonnes of rocketry documentation before the region be hand over to the russians

S0372	case full of bullion
S0262	yeah
S0372	be all find there and yet they be say that this be spread out all over the country in different cave all over the place
S0262	cos it suit them
S0372	and they're go

S0262	it's rubbish
S0372	be bother
S0262	yeah
S0372	with this
S0262	yeah
S0372	and then they
S0262	so you didn't even watch the end then
S0372	no
S0262	no yeah exactly
S0372	and
S0262	that's what i'm like these days
S0372	just
S0262	life's too short if the film's shit i just won't watch it
S0372	just
S0262	yeah
S0372	turn it off about two thirds of the way through
S0262	yeah
S0372	be go well you know you've gotta watch it and see how it end i say look
S0262	don't wanna know
S0372	don't wanna know how it end
S0262	yeah
S0372	it's totally irrelevant
S0262	yeah exactly
S0372	i mean
S0262	yeah
S0372	they couldn't even get the erm scenes where they'd get erm sort of flashbacks to the german occupation of paris or the german occupation of
S0262	yeah
S0372	wherever amsterdam
S0262	and couldn't even get that right
S0372	erm wrong
S0262	yeah no it's it's it's it's just sometimes
S0372	yeah
S0262	it just it's just so shoddy
S0372	and you know and there's this
S0262	these people be mean to be professional filmmakers
S0372	absolute i mean i i
S0262	yeah
S0372	buy i actually buy the dvd i throw it away
S0262	yeah
S0372	i throw it away
S0262	yeah you be just
S0372	i i felt disgust
S0262	so angry with it
S0372	i be so angry with it
S0262	yeah yeah yeah
S0372	but the erm you know it be just like a a collection of film star who say well you know let's make a film cos you know we haven't get any money
S0262	yeah
S0372	or we'd like to make some more money
S0262	well probably more
S0372	or let's have some fun
S0262	like erm some
S0372	we're bore
S0262	some some producers
S0372	we haven't get any offer
S0262	get some money from
S0372	mm
S0262	somewhere and they say right we'll quickly make a film we don't really care if it's shit let's just spend it cos sometimes
S0372	mm
S0262	that's what they do
S0372	yeah
S0262	and that's why a lot
S0372	yeah i think that be it
S0262	of pant film anyway i've get to go
S0372	alright
S0262	but what we can do be we can work on this
S0372	mm
S0262	when you when you want to i mean i'm quite i'm quite intrigue about all of this now you've get me really hook in about you know of course the plot but i'm really interest in the character formation the arc you know i think it it could be a really interest process
S0372	yeah i mean if you can send me if you can send me an example of a treatment
S0262	yeah yeah okay yeah
S0372	mail it to me
S0262	yeah yeah yeah i will i'll definitely send you it er one thing i wanna just say when i
S0372	mm
S0262	send you the treatment don't be put off by it what i mean by that be if i send you a treatment well okay well let me say a treatment's a really bloody hard thing to write cos it's normally only about three or four page long
S0372	yeah but it's a it's the structure
S0262	it's the structure
S0372	i'm look at
S0262	yeah yeah but you might look at it and go how the hell be i mean to condense my whole entire film into three or four page and how you do it be by go through this type of process
S0372	uhu
S0262	that's how you break it down and that's why each paragraph be here you know the paragraph be dot along these trajectories paragraph be not actually plotlines er plot point
S0372	no but
S0262	in a treatment
S0372	that head be a plot
S0262	yes this be a different formation it's a different formation of information
S0372	i mean what i find what i find difficult i mean it's sort of run the things through my head now be i've get seventy chapters
S0262	yes yes
S0372	some of them be very short
S0262	yeah
S0372	but seventy chapters in two hours if i say there'll be two minutes a chapter
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	you know we're look at
S0262	yeah it's not gonna work yeah
S0372	no it's gonna be too long
S0262	yeah so that's why bits of
S0372	mm
S0262	chapters will not appear in the film
S0372	mm
S0262	but that's why you have to be clear in your mind and so that you can actually convince a producer
S0372	i mean this be the thing
S0262	that you know this
S0372	where you have to make a judgement be be
S0262	yeah
S0372	be something visually vital to capture the imagination er or be it plot vital
S0262	okay i know the answer to that always go visual you always because
S0372	mm
S0262	the medium of film
S0372	mm
S0262	be visual
S0372	yeah
S0262	and audio er audio
S0372	mm
S0262	you always go on the visual
S0372	mm
S0262	you err on the side of visual you never go with plotline the the the the audience if they be film literate enough will pick up what you're do
S0372	mm
S0262	very quickly you know that you know that people can follow things really very quickly
S0372	mm
S0262	why because actually they read the way that they look at the screen be that they can pick up so much information it normally
S0372	mm
S0262	the eye go in this kind of clockwise
S0372	mm
S0262	so your you you can actually put in one page the way that the eye work on the screen especially a bloody big screen on a cinema
S0372	mm
S0262	you can put in so much information on the visual side
S0372	yeah
S0262	that people can see depth of field they can see the actor they can see periphery
S0372	mm they can see what's go on in the background they can see what's
S0262	and you don't need to explain it
S0372	no
S0262	that's what i mean don't explain the plot
S0372	no
S0262	just put in the visual
S0372	well it's a bite like write the book itself
S0262	yeah
S0372	except show it don't don't tell it
S0262	exactly yeah
S0372	mm
S0262	and the dialogue be the force
S0372	mm
S0262	yeah that's really what keep the momentum go with obviously some you know kind of interest er things that
S0372	but you know it's
S0262	happen along the way
S0372	the thing's gotta be interest the character have gotta be interest there's gotta be friction there there's gotta be
S0262	yeah
S0372	electricity there
S0262	yeah yeah
S0372	the whole thing and you it it's a it take pick pick your team doesn't it because er
S0262	yeah
S0372	i've see film that be er
S0262	yeah
S0372	they could have be really good
S0262	yeah but they didn't really get this
S0372	but they didn't gel because
S0262	bite right
S0372	the actors just didn't interact
S0262	yeah
S0372	it be like they be be film
S0262	yeah like
S0372	in different studios or on different
S0262	two yeah that's right
S0372	side of the mountain
S0262	yeah you're on you're do one side
S0372	and then
S0262	over here
S0372	like
S0262	that's right and then do me
S0372	put them together
S0262	that's why and if you can get your protagonist antagonist
S0372	mm
S0262	lure each other in a really
S0372	mm
S0262	really tight knit way that make for a very harness
S0372	mm
S0262	bite of interaction
S0372	mm
S0262	between you know people so or transaction should i say
S0372	yeah
S0262	cos sometimes it be a transaction and it's the game people play a lot of the time script writers who be start out want to talk about motivation inner and external bollocks to that
S0372	mm
S0262	it's game play if you understand the game theory this be the big game that's be play in your world the world
S0372	yeah
S0262	that you create everyone want to play the game and everybody want to win
S0372	mm
S0262	and that's what you're show the audience
S0372	mm we've get two team play here
S0262	yeah
S0372	the goodies and the baddies
S0262	yeah
S0372	and then we've get this er sideline of these very bad bug that could get
S0262	yeah
S0372	get in and survive
S0262	yeah
S0372	erm which one's gonna get you first
S0262	yes exactly and that's what it be
S0372	and that's the race
S0262	and that could be your tagline
S0372	yeah
S0372	you see you just say it and i'm glad we're record this because often we can't write fast enough
S0372	mm
S0262	to get the creative
S0372	mm
S0262	line come out but that's your tagline
S0372	yeah
S0262	that would be your elevator pitch
S0372	yeah
S0262	cos what he'd say like what who what and then he'll ask you again because you say it so succinctly
S0372	mm
S0262	they actually then ask you question
S0372	mm
S0262	but if you're go on too long they start to phase off
S0262	yeah exactly so the shorter the better
S0372	have to stay on
S0262	yeah exactly
S0372	there
S0262	anyway i've gotta go haven't i mm do you mind fill in my consent form
S0372	erm be i old enough to sign this
S0372	what be i consent to
S0262	oh i don't know
S0372	er right
S0262	i'm just gonna pop to the toilet
S0372	second of march isn't it
S0262	yeah second of march
S0372	ah second of
