S0509	nice yeah oh naan

S0509	yes
S0510	or yeah i could do sort of like a curry type soup i've probably get some chickpeas
S0509	soup
S0510	and yeah soup soup soup okay
S0509	that rice be so nice have it for lunch today i be like this be amaze
S0510	be it ah
S0509	it taste really good that fish be spot on
S0510	oh good i'm glad
S0509	sometimes it's a bite dry but today it be not dry it be
S0510	yes yeah no i i didn't overpoach it sometimes i yeah if i've get the other stuff on the go i'm not always as attendant to the time on that haddock
S0509	yeah mm
S0510	but yeah it be it be melt in your mouth wasn't it it be lovely
S0509	it be great well do
S0510	thank you
S0509	cook achievement right there
S0509	daddy be say he want to make some more apple crumble but he doesn't have any sugar cos he's just put it all in the wine so
S0510	oh i know gosh he's do four gallons of apple wine today that's crazy and i've already get two gallons sort of you know four weeks in
S0509	oh my god
S0510	so i don't know what he's try to do to me cos i'm the only one drink it well unless
S0509	well he's go to give it away as christmas gift
S0510	oh oh alright thank goodness for that cos i'm think this be go to take me till next well next christmas to drink it all
S0510	yeah
S0509	i well i i think he be i think that's part of the plan
S0510	cool okay
S0509	give some away to people
S0510	well i'd quite like to keep some of the first batch that he have on cos i i have a taster three and a half weeks in and that be it's his best yet actually
S0509	really oh wow
S0510	yeah yeah it's definitely his best yet but he be like go crazy with the the the sugar so he's go to optimum level so it's go to be he's go to do me a volume later to tell me what the strength of this particular wine be
S0509	right
S0510	but the the four gallon one be about i think it be nought point nought point eight six or something erm and the the free week in wine that i've try be a nought point nine and that be that be almost like a spirit almost when i taste it
S0509	oh my god
S0510	you know i mean it won't be it won't be to that level but it will probably be about the right level you know it should be for wine cos the wine
S0509	oh
S0510	the previous win he's be do be i get the feel they've be quite weak they've probably only be about six seven percent whereas most standard bottle of wine would be about thirteen percent probably
S0509	oh blimey
S0510	so erm and he do say to me he admit today that the read for all the previous batch of wine be probably more like nought point five nought point six
S0509	right
S0510	so yeah so yeah it's go to be interest
S0509	yeah
S0510	but i say to him i'd really like a red wine cos we've get we've still get so many apples and i be wonder can we not put some apple fruit in with it you know
S0509	yeah
S0510	but he he's see some cranberries dry cranberries that you can buy online erm which would probably make a really good red wine
S0509	oh right be that how you make red wine with
S0510	well i mean you know red grapes or but erm yeah just cranberry juice if you taste cranberry juice it's so full the flavour it's so erm
S0509	oh
S0510	what's the word it's really rich you know
S0509	yeah it's yeah
S0510	and some red win you get you know they they have that richness that tanginess so
S0509	i'll take your word for it
S0510	oh right then
S0510	yeah you're never likely to
S0509	no
S0510	so anyway how do we get onto wine where be we
S0509	i don't know food
S0510	food hungry food fruit
S0509	well yeah
S0510	food yeah yeah so we be talk ah sorry be i squeak on there yeah yeah
S0509	squeak and it's it's grate on my nerve
S0510	okay erm yeah i'll do a curry soup i think the only thing be i don't know have we get many potatoes so
S0509	probably not
S0510	to just sort of flesh it out a bite so i'm go to have to think as well for vegetables to
S0509	yeah
S0510	flesh it out mm we will see

S0510	what sort of time be you you you go over there
S0509	er it start at six so it's

S0509	yeah
S0510	erm
S0509	how's it sell
S0510	well it's not be brilliant actually
S0509	right
S0510	er it's be half half full
S0509	mm
S0510	half house but i mean like the audience yesterday even though there be like sixty five about a hundred and twenty
S0509	yeah it's a hundred and something
S0510	yeah yeah erm they be really they be our best audience yet actually yesterday
S0509	yeah you be say it be good
S0510	they be really appreciative and they really get it i mean it's so funny the first play it kind of almost really warm them up cos it's a short
S0509	yeah
S0510	sort of thirty five minute comedy and it's really silly it it then warm them up for a game of speculation because that's a much longer play and you you know there's more sort of undercurrents and stuff go on
S0509	yeah
S0510	you have to pay a bite more attention er i won't give too much away obviously
S0509	no hush hush
S0510	yes but er yeah it's good cos it kind of prim them for that really
S0509	right
S0510	but it's a very different comedy
S0509	mm hm
S0510	very different yeah so they they be very appreciative and there's always one line in game of speculation not everybody it's funny it's surprise what people laugh at and what they don't laugh at
S0509	yeah
S0510	erm er but there's always one line in game of speculation that get everybody you know everyone laugh at it whereas others you can never be sure if they'll fully get the joke
S0509	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0510	how much be they pay attention or just you know have they connect
S0509	yeah we we have a bite of that in you know
S0510	do you yeah
S0509	yeah there's some in it it'd be like be they go to laugh at it tonight
S0510	right
S0509	and there be one audience think it might have be thursday and they laugh at everything
S0510	really gosh
S0509	or no be it the friday cos erm you know we have the rite of with the mad dance
S0510	yes yes
S0509	like you could probably gauge how funny an audience find it by how loud their reaction to that be on one night people be just really fall about laugh with it
S0510	fall about brilliant
S0509	but other time it's be like just like a titter
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	like this be funny we make this funny
S0509	you're suppose to laugh now don't give me the line because
S0510	no i'm not go to give you the line no no
S0509	yeah
S0510	see see what you think but it's lovely as well cos when they do the curtain call at the end er box and cox the two main character for the first play

S0510	which be lovely so we have one occasion where when they come onto stage cos they come in about half an hour in
S0509	yeah
S0510	the audience give them a little and a little because they recognise them and you know enjoy them
S0509	yeah
S0510	and they always get the biggest clap at the end
S0509	at the end
S0510	the last three people on be box and cox from the first one and mister hawk who he he's terrific
