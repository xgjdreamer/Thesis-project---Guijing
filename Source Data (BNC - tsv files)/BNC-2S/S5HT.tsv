S0618	mm
S0619	no definitely not

S0619	you're waste your money if whatever you're do outside of here isn't good you know isn't good for you
S0618	yeah
S0619	and expect more i'd expect the weight to be go up or whatever but it's not so you've get to really
S0618	be that sex go on
S0619	no i think they're watch a video
S0618	oh fair enough
S0619	you've get to be quite sort of analytical er so

S0619	mm mm mm mm yeah

S0618	mm
S0619	like sort my nose out sort this addiction
S0618	yeah
S0619	and it's just go on and on and it's get worse and worse and you've just or i've just get to go right enough be enough
S0618	mm mm
S0619	erm
S0618	and you've do that now hurray
S0619	what's next yeah so what's next
S0618	yeah
S0619	next eye
S0618	aha contact lenses
S0619	just go to have a whole new head by
S0618	i tell you you be not go to fall over at all when ski
S0618	you be just go to be an expert skier when you can actually see where you're go see the icy spot see the bump in the snow
S0619	se the ice breathe
S0618	yeah see the small children ahead of you
S0619	yeah with those super strong legs
S0618	yeah the super strong legs yeah
S0619	yeah so it's all come together
S0618	that's so cool
S0619	and i know a lot of these things that kind of i don't know whether they're necessarily erm not superficial's not artificial or you know things to do with appearance it's like beneath appearance but appearance base things
S0618	mm mm
S0619	and not like i don't know
S0618	i think appearance base things my personal take on it be where things be the last to manifest so anything that's be go on psychologically spiritually emotionally once you start sort it on the physical like for example go to the gym or for example not do your nasal thing that's because the change have already take place on the inner
S0619	yeah yeah that's
S0618	so this be like the outer representation of what's already occur on the inner
S0619	yeah
S0618	which be you know another great thing for you as well to think like with your nasal thing you've really kick this
S0619	yeah
S0618	because it be last to manifest in the physical
S0619	yeah that's true
S0618	woohoo
S0619	yeah and it's
S0618	lot to celebrate it's really good
S0619	skin skin'll be next
S0618	mm mm
S0619	but i've make to you know i'm make the effort internally which be drink water er when i be in england change medication again
S0618	mm
S0619	erm so hopefully it should sort itself out
S0618	mm
S0619	and i think you know not just
S0618	and the biggest thing be happy
S0619	yeah and yeah and not see sort of only positive think be gonna change this
S0618	mm
S0619	or you know go it's go to change it's go to change but it's all part of the same
S0618	yeah and it have change
S0619	yeah
S0618	so it's not it's no longer at a point in the future it's now at a point in the present woohoo
S0619	woohoo
S0618	i kind of feel like i need to have a big party for you it's like yay yay and yeah put up some balloon and some banners and
S0619	yeah i mean there's still you know work to do but it'll get there it'll all get there
S0618	yeah there's always work to do though i think that that's the point of life the universe and everything it's all a work in progress
S0619	yeah i know i'm i'm never go to sit down and go right i be do i be never go to get any better
S0618	no it's never go to happen and i think that's the key to it be to when you wake up to there be no destination
S0619	yeah
S0618	it's all about now
S0619	yes
S0618	yeah
S0619	and i think no me and my friend have be talk for a a couple of years and maybe even yeah a couple of years and we're both at turn twenty five within a few days of each other
S0618	mm
S0619	and we sort of say by twenty five we want to be at peak physical mental blah blah blah blah blah
S0619	and like time's tick
S0619	so you know it's not
S0618	yeah
S0619	it's it i'm not do it because of that but subconsciously somewhere in there be these decisions be make because we make this promise
S0618	yeah
S0619	that we would do these things
S0618	when be you twenty five
S0619	april
S0618	april cool
S0619	so it's just like a normal
S0618	what date will i still be here yeah probably will
S0619	the sixth
S0618	yeah yeah i'll be about cool
S0619	so it's just after easter hols or during the easter hols
S0618	oh actually yeah i might not be back by then yeah i might still be on the return leg it depend on how much time i spend in northern ireland in march
S0619	yeah oh well we'll see we'll see
S0618	yeah we'll see
S0619	we'll see and i don't know yet if i'm go to go to england for it i think i look at flight and they be dead expensive but i think i look a bite too prematurely so they're always higher
S0618	mm when's your school holiday
S0619	er i can't remember that i need to check
S0618	i think it be over by april be it not like the twenty third to the thirtieth or something that's off the top of my head probably out of my arse i'm not sure
S0619	erm er twenty fourth to the twenty ninth
S0618	twenty ninth yeah
S0619	but i don't know what days they be i think it's like
S0618	i think easter sunday be the twenty seventh or something like that
S0619	it be yeah so that's the tuesday so we'll start on the wednesday
S0618	okay
S0619	so that's the thirtieth so we finish on the thursday i don't know so thursday to wednesday
S0618	mm
S0619	so it's probably not enough time to get back cos the flight from be from wednesday to sunday
S0618	ah okay
S0619	so
S0618	flight from krakow
S0619	i'll have a look
S0618	mm
S0619	i hate fly from krakow though i just think again it's just a waste of my time
S0618	mm
S0618	you be hilarious
S0619	i don't know everything it's all tie in to what we be say about you know pay the money do it fast or pay the money do it comfortably er and with fly from krakow
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah erm you know pay i don't know anyway
S0618	mm
S0619	so we shall see anyway three minutes until should be here so
S0619	just keep
S0618	how incredibly english three minutes
S0619	no i'm not say if she's not here in three minutes i'm bar the door she can't come in just remind you
S0618	that be so funny
S0619	i don't know why i'm so into time it's sort of social condition i think
S0618	yeah very possibly i i get break off that live in northern ireland and in england and when i be part of the rat race i use to have breakfast meet at like seven o' clock or whatever ridiculous time of the morning it be yeah
S0619	oh yeah you say this before in ireland it doesn't work like that
S0618	no not at all you have a meet at ten and if you be there like an english person arrive at ten to ten because you don't want to be late and then at ten o' clock you're still the only person there at ten past ten you're still the only person there and by half past ten everybody's arrive
S0619	yeah
S0618	and you're have coffee and tea and scones cos you have to have scones and it be almost an unspoken rule that while you're drink tea and eat scones before a meet you don't talk about the meet
S0619	yeah only everything else
S0618	you talk about yeah everything about family or friendships or what you do at the weekend
S0619	yeah
S0618	and then the meet will start about eleven so for a ten o' clock meet don't expect to do anything before eleven but it's quite nice in a way it's a more relax lifestyle and if you think oh shit there's a bite of traffic i'm go to be five minutes late you don't need to bother ring anybody
S0619	mm mm
S0618	you don't need to drive like a dick to try and get there all the sooner
S0619	yeah
S0618	it doesn't matter
S0619	we be talk about that this morning er with and about er in spain and life in spain and you know everything be so slow and in the afternoon
S0618	mm that's so sensible
S0619	and people sort of cancel last minute cos they just they go oh whatever
S0619	ah and i just think that'd be awful
S0618	i think it's go to be kill or cure for you
S0619	i'd hate it i'd absolutely hate it but i think it's probably good for me
S0618	mm
S0619	erm
S0618	i use to be quite obsess with time until i live in northern ireland
S0619	yeah
S0618	and i still drive like an arsehole when i get there and can remember overtake everything it be possible to overtake on bendy country roads on my hour's journey to work every day and then after i probably take about two or three years and i completely chill out erm even now i don't drive fast and it's fine and i'm not look at the clock
S0619	mm mm
S0618	and it be definitely from northern ireland i think have i live and work in belfast or go down south and live and work in dublin it might have be different
S0619	mm mm
S0618	but live rurally work relatively rurally er all change
S0619	i don't know how i'm go to cope because i do yeah i never really consider myself to be a sort of control freak person or someone who like everything to be just so but i think i'm sort of learn that i be that person
S0619	erm especially with time er and especially with you know get things do and be quite not control but i like be in control and know what's happen
S0618	mm
S0619	know you know the plan or the situation
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah and have that sort of take away i don't know how i'll feel
S0618	so why be you go to spain why be you draw this experience to you
S0619	i need the sun
S0618	that i understand
S0619	really that's the only reason i just need sunshine
S0618	yeah yeah i think the thing be quite natural cos you're not go to be work during the hottest part of the day
S0619	yeah
S0618	and
S0619	i suppose in this job you wouldn't be work at that time anyway
S0618	mm yeah i guess
S0619	if it's i don't know what time it will be one till three or twelve till one or something like that it wouldn't be
S0618	it's a few hours though isn't it
S0619	mm
S0618	don't you work like seven be to seven pm and have four hours off or three hours off or something
S0619	i don't know
S0618	i don't know
S0619	but in this job anyway
S0618	oh there's so
