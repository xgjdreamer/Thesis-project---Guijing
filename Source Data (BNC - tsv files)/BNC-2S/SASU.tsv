S0252	which book do you have to read for your school exams
S0251	well the book we have to read the novel be great expectations by charles dickens we do the shakespeare play julius caesar and we do some poems a selection of poems quite a few of them be different poems about snow ah one be about a snake i think one of the best ones that i like the most be a poem call grantchester by
S0252	yes do you erm find that it be an inspire choice of erm book
S0251	ah i think great expectations be one of the great classics eh of english to read so i be quite glad that i read it although at the time i find that it be a very long book to get through in a year our teacher use to read us erm extract throughout the year so to make sure that it be all read erm we'd only just finish the book by the time it be a few weeks before the exam i find it quite heavy go in part a lot of detail description in it i think that stop the flow of the story a little bite perhaps for me
S0252	yes
S0251	i also find it to be quite complicate plot that doesn't unravel until right at the very end when you realise that you've be lead up a blind alley
S0252	do you erm find the eh poems interest as well
S0251	erm i wasn't so interest in the poems about snow but they be obviously there so that you could compare and contrast the way that different poets talk about snow to try to describe which he find the most effective i like the poem about grantchester because i can imagine somebody be away from home maybe in the first world war think about the lovely things that they use to do when they live in a nice village and it be lovely and quiet and wonder whether people be still do something very civilise like take tea on the lawn and have some nice honey and it be very quiet and that would contrast with the situation that they're in which be very noisy and violent and dirty and that kind of long that they would experience for get back home to that security
S0252	yes
S0251	which book do you read
S0252	erm for my ah gcse ah course i read erm
S0251	yeah
S0252	and of mice and men
S0251	yes
S0252	and erm inspector call really erm i think one of the key theme be to show the erm social erm situation in the victorian era
S0251	yes
S0252	by erm sort of have a complex chain of events between erm work and middle class factory owner
S0251	mm
S0252	i think it be try to indicate that erm social change ah be require
S0251	mm because people be treat in different ways
S0252	yes
S0251	yes
S0252	i don't think of mice and men particularly erm contrast it that wasn't really the aim
S0251	no
S0252	they be just separate publications
S0251	yes yes
S0252	obviously mice and men be an american base erm novel erm
S0251	yes
S0252	it's basically focus on the sort of the big dream attitude in america that be present in the i think it be the nineteen twenty thirties
S0251	mm yeah thirties yeah that's right
S0252	yeah and why two ranch workers who don't have much money
S0251	mm
S0252	erm have this vision of have a a plot and a sort of try to reach self sufficiency
S0251	yes
S0252	that be within that sort of basic tale you've get sort of other factor such as one character who be eh very large and strong but not very clever
S0251	mm yes
S0252	a slim weaker figure who you know some ways almost act like a father figure to the other character who be leonard
S0251	mm yes lenny
S0252	but yet they ah sort of have such close connections with one another i think they really have a strong friendship bond
S0251	yes yes
S0252	i also erm have a the moon over the tide poetry he which be oh yeah
S0251	yes he do didn't he most enjoyable wasn't it
S0252	collection of war poems that be intend to compare with one another
S0251	yes yes one good thing about the of mice and men book be that it be quite a slim volume wasn't it
S0252	yes yes
S0251	so i think it only have about six chapters
S0252	mm i think it's just over a hundred page
S0251	yeah so it be very readable wasn't it
S0252	yeah
S0251	and you know you could remember the whole story
S0252	mm
S0251	in one go another good thing be that there be a dvd to watch
S0252	yes
S0251	which be very close virtually word for word to the text wasn't it
S0252	yes
S0251	so that give a really good visual picture for you to follow as well didn't it
S0252	but also if you look at your case with great expectations you can only you'd struggle to read the book once and you've get something like mice and men you could read quite a number of time in the time
S0251	mm yes that's right yes yes even the film of a great expectations be quite long to watch all in one go
S0252	yes yes i think the poems be erm sort of relatively erm a challenge aspect i think there's quite a lot of opinion in some ways of whether the contrast or whether they erm sort of make these comparisons as well as try to dig out different literary techniques
S0251	mm yes
S0252	i think erm it's quite difficult to do when sort of poems have be write in different circumstances for different war even i think it's not such a straightforward comparison to make i suppose they might be think that it's a good way to get some originality
S0251	yes they be weren't they yes
S0252	but i do feel that do need to be some well more or less that be a correct analysis erm but i i don't think sort of english erm sort of work in that logical approach as much
S0251	mm what do you think the fact that have now say he's the education minister or be the education minister that american literature be no longer to be available to school to choose because i think about ninety percent or more than ninety percent of school be choose of mice and men erm probably because it's quite a short book
S0252	yes
S0251	and because i think a lot of people enjoy read it
S0252	i i think it's a bite disappoint really i don't think nationality especially come into a book really
S0251	no
S0252	but obviously i think he would be probably better if he consider a sort of add to the range of book rather than
S0251	yes
S0252	compete the same you can't read that one
S0251	no yes when i be at school my english teacher use today if a book's worth read it's worth read twice
S0252	yes
S0251	but i must say i've never read great expectations twice
S0252	no
S0251	i think it would take a long time
S0252	yes so do
S0251	have to be pretty keen i think
S0252	so do you think length be also a factor if a good good short book be worth read would that be read twice
S0251	yes
S0252	but a good long book
S0251	i have read a couple of book twice and it's surprise how when you read it the second time it feel quite different
S0252	yes
S0251	you seem to get a different
S0252	handle
S0251	yeah read of it when you go for the second read yes
S0252	yes erm be you intend to eh read any further material soon or
S0251	erm well i have read another dickens book which be a christmas carol which i do like as well and i've watch a couple of other dvds and about dickens and serialise dickens book on the television which be how he originally intend them to be read in instalments so i think there be quite erm a tradition on sunday afternoon teatimes of have serialise episodes like dickens what about you do you think you'll be read any more war poetry in the near future
S0252	i think it'll be more likely to be erm account journals and book rather than er
S0251	poetry
S0252	poetry
S0251	yeah
S0252	yes but obviously er i think there will be a certain amount of theory in it er er but obviously er i don't think it will have any comparisons to poetry
S0251	mm yes no
S0252	you might come across a a mnemonic to remember a certain theory or something but i don't think it any further than that
S0251	a mnemonic yes no yes i think erm it be quite a good choice really the book that you have and
S0252	yes
S0251	the dvd of an inspector call i think that be very atmospheric it's not very often now that we see a dvd or a film in black and white
S0252	no
S0251	but i think it work quite effectively
S0252	yes
S0251	for that story because it be set er quite far back and because it be a bite sort of spooky wasn't it
S0252	yeah
S0251	there's some ambiguity about who the inspector be whether he's some kind of ghost or whether it's somebody's conscience or so that give it a bite of atmosphere i think shoot it in black and white
S0252	i think it be interest that erm revisit the erm alabama theatre in
S0251	alhambra
S0252	to eh
S0251	yes
S0252	watch an inspector call
S0251	yes that bring it to life a bite more
S0252	yes
S0251	yes
S0252	yes
S0251	i haven't actually come across that play before you encounter it at school i think it be really worthwhile do it and i really enjoy the story
S0252	yes
S0251	but erm i think if i just see it on a television schedule i wouldn't have think to watch it perhaps really glad to be introduce to it i think it be really interest
S0252	no yes i think it's a good idea of erm when you're study a book if you can try and see the erm film or go to a theatre
S0251	yes the production
S0252	see a live production of it
S0251	yes i think it really do bring it to life doesn't it which be how it be intend to be present as a play
S0252	yes
S0251	rather than read in a classroom out of a book
S0252	yes i think one of the funniest things which erm wasn't really a set piece of the erm data production
S0251	mm
S0252	be that one of the people be walk down the step
S0251	yes
S0252	erm i think it be the erm the inspector
S0251	mm
S0252	be kind of like a a metal erm fence around the house but it it go over the step so you have to step over it and then he trip over and then he nearly fell flat in the face which make the audience laugh quite a bite
S0251	oh right i bet i bet some people think that be the best part but do he soon regain his balance and his composure
S0252	he do yes
S0251	my gosh poor chap i bet he won't do that again he'll be extra careful now
S0252	yes must have be slightly embarrass
S0251	it would wouldn't it yes and be the other people who be in the play laugh about it or be they keep in character
S0252	i think they just about manage not to laugh
S0251	some quiet snigger
S0252	yes
S0251	yeah oh dear
S0252	i suppose it add to that an element of originality
S0251	oh it do yeah it's very authentic isn't it
S0252	yes
S0251	yes
S0252	erm in some ways the theatre be not something that we sort of visit too much of
S0251	no i haven't be too frequently i must admit
S0252	yeah i think the last thing we all saw be the nutcracker
S0251	oh yes yes we do go to see the nutcracker the ballet didn't we one christmas
S0252	yes
S0251	that be nice though wasn't it
S0252	it be
S0251	yeah the disappointment for me be that there wasn't a real live orchestra that it be just pip music wasn't it
S0252	yeah i i think there be a small number hide under the stage i wasn't sure whether that be a real orchestra or not
S0251	be there oh right yes yes i think that's a lovely thing to see at christmas don't you
S0252	it be
S0251	yes be there anything else that you would like to see in the future
S0252	erm i think one thing that theatres do too much be that the sort of happy like more contemporary kind of like ah comedy show that type of thing
S0251	mm
S0252	i don't i'm not really interest in that sort of thing
S0251	what would you like to see
S0252	well sort of maybe i don't know a take on a a classic or just a classic itself
S0251	mm yes yes
S0252	you in that league as well or
S0251	yes i think i'd be more interest in that than something more contemporary
S0252	have you any ideas of what you would like to see or
S0251	no well i haven't really be follow what's on offer have we
S0252	no
S0251	i think maybe people watch the television more than go to the theatre now
S0252	yes
S0251	and it be probably quite expensive to get the ticket
S0252	yes i think sometimes they do some like bargain deal but
S0251	yes
S0252	not as frequently as you might want
S0251	no
S0252	but i think there be an element of thrill of go to the theatre
S0251	yes it be it do have a different atmosphere because it's more of an occasion isn't it
S0252	yeah it be
S0251	than just sit in front of the television
S0252	yes
S0251	or dvds
S0252	mm
S0251	so they're both probably have their place don't they
S0252	yeah i'm not sure whether erm theatres be as popular as they use to be or
S0251	no i don't think so
S0252	we be a little bite of a distance from our nearest theatre
S0251	yes it would be a half hour drive probably wouldn't it yes
S0252	yes yeah
S0251	i'd quite like to see more ballets i think
S0252	yes there's erm black be it swan
S0251	swan lake
S0252	swan lake be that a ballet
S0251	yes i've see that one i've see swan lake and i've see erm of romeo and juliet
S0252	yes
S0251	and the nutcracker when i take you
S0252	yes something nice to do near christmas
S0251	yes it would we'll have to keep an eye open
S0252	yes
S0251	see what's advertise
S0252	yes what do you think to the book and erm poems that erm be select for work yes
S0251	for you yes i think they be very good i think they be more accessible than the ones that i have and i be very please with the choice yes with both of them i think they be more interest to read
S0252	yes
S0251	and eh we'd more or less read them hadn't well you'd read them in the holiday didn't you so you make a good start
S0252	yes yeah
S0251	yes i be really please with the choice
S0252	i think ah in my a level course it's definitely be more sort of academic book
S0251	mm
S0252	like for example the french revolution element who be buy book that be write by academics
S0251	yes well that's more factual and textbooks isn't it
S0252	it be more factual
S0251	than something that you would read like a novel
S0252	yes
S0251	yes
S0252	i think that some of them be relatively densely eh write
S0251	mm certainly be
S0252	i think if you do get a quote from a well know academic i think it'd give it a little erm yes
S0251	bite more authenticity
S0252	yes
S0252	yes
S0252	i think it show impressive and make the erm sort of have to read
S0251	yes yes it's a very widely read candidate be this one
S0252	yes
S0251	yes give a bite of kudos doesn't it
S0252	it do i think it's interest that erm i do not have a read list to start my course and next september
S0251	no that's right so say that'll probably come in the second week so
S0252	yes
S0251	i'm quite glad in some ways because it give you a complete break over the summer holiday which i think be well deserve and well need and that you can start afresh in september
S0252	it do yes
S0251	and they'll be able to advise you better which book be necessary and which book you might like to get if you want a couple of extras
S0252	yes
S0251	so
S0252	i seem to get the impression that they erm want you to be very selective about which book you choose i think they're almost go to say which book they want you to get
S0251	yes yes well i think that's a good idea really and hopefully all the information that you need or the majority of the information will be at your fingertips then won't it
S0252	it will yes you have quite an extensive read list for your higher education
S0251	yes i do quite a lot of them be not very obtainable some of them be publish in nineteen thirty something when i be go round all the second hand book try to get them and then i read them and then when i get there they be never mention so
S0252	that must have be a disappointment
S0251	i i wonder why they bother do that just to tick the box that we've send out a read list
S0252	do any of your other colleagues read
S0251	i doubt it doubt it i doubt they could find them anyway very rare
S0252	that's one advantage now be that erm it's much easier to obtain book
S0251	it be yeah that's right
S0252	and usually at a better price
S0251	yes yes absolutely though you you can spend more time read the book and less time search the bookshops for them
S0252	yes which one be better
S0251	read the book i think yeah
