S0529	my my parent can't afford to like look after me for months or anything like that
S0530	mm
S0529	i mean neither of them can my mum can't afford to keep me at home i'd have to get a job and if i'm feel anxious i find that really difficult to do like
S0530	so it's not like you can just go and get a job it's not that straightforward
S0529	yeah it wouldn't be that simple cos i know it wouldn't cos that's what happen last year no i've have that experience and i dunno i think i might feel differently if i leave here because i feel like if i leave here it would be under my own circumstances and i'd feel a bite more like in control of it
S0530	mm
S0529	cos last year i wasn't in my in my right mind to make that decision i just do it as like a kind of
S0530	be it a rash decision when you drop out of uni last year
S0529	inspiration yeah it be a bite yeah i mean i saw like one person before i do it i saw like a kind of welfare type person who tell me to like think about get a deferral instead of drop out and that's what i do in the end
S0530	okay
S0529	but yeah i didn't really take much think on my part like i just do it
S0530	why do you erm not defer why do you come to do you just think new start kind of thing
S0529	erm yeah like i
S0530	yeah
S0529	kind of work it be really weird actually like work myself up all year kind of think oh it be like a really horrible time and i kind of work it up as this sort of not trauma but like this horrible past experience that i didn't want to
S0530	mm
S0529	relive and i felt like go back to would just be like like kind of tempt
S0530	mm mm
S0529	like another sort of similar experience to happen and i always felt like that i didn't really get on with the people in my flat and i be worry that i wouldn't get accommodation again because in the in the second year like no cos i i'd still be in first year but i wouldn't erm qualify for accommodation on campus so i would have to like
S0530	oh gosh
S0529	find somewhere to live and it would it would be really stressful and it just didn't seem
S0530	why wouldn't you qualify for accommodation
S0529	i don't know because apparently like
S0530	cos you'd be before
S0529	that last and yeah that count as like my first year and you only get one year at accommodation
S0530	do you have to pay for the whole tuition fee
S0529	erm
S0530	or only first term
S0529	no i think i'm pay that back when i'm older i think that's that's gonna just go along with the next
S0530	oh so oh oh so you're you didn't like get an exception like you have to pay back the nine grand and stuff
S0529	yeah yeah no i didn't get an exception
S0530	it's so unfair isn't it
S0529	yeah
S0530	cos you didn't actually get the tuition
S0529	i know i but at least i don't have to pay it back now like the other stuff i
S0530	no exactly
S0529	yeah that's that's that's save for later thankfully
S0530	mm
S0529	but it's still you know it's still there which be double to pay back
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	which be really shit but yeah that's so yeah erm stuff like that i just end up not go back i mean i kinda wish i have in some ways like like when i erm like a couple of weeks ago i get i be wish i'd go back to because like 's just like amaze it's such a good town mm
S0530	how far be away from
S0529	er it's about twenty minutes well it wasn't
S0530	mm
S0529	the uni
S0530	yeah
S0529	isn't actually in it's in a place call which be kind of like in between and cos be a county it's not like a town or anything so yeah it be like in a kinda town like ten minutes or fifteen minutes away from it be really cool
S0530	oh my god
S0529	mm
S0530	be there any people at that you like you miss
S0529	erm
S0530	like you just say like ah do you know what i mean
S0529	mm i dunno well like this boy that i've speak about a few time i suppose i miss him a bite
S0530	oh yeah
S0529	but that's about it really
S0530	yeah
S0529	i didn't have any friends
S0530	mm
S0529	other than him and my flatmates be like really quite standoffish like they didn't really talk to me that much
S0530	mm
S0529	and i didn't really make friends in my class like
S0530	yeah
S0529	yeah
S0530	yeah i mean it's like when you don't get on with your flatmates like i know like it's the worst possible thing because you're live with them and it's
S0529	it be it's it's such a big thing like it really contribute to whether i still like i i dunno how i'd feel really if i didn't have a good flat this year
S0530	mm
S0529	i would probably have leave already do this
S0530	yeah you would've leave
S0529	i really think that that i'm not just i really think i would've cos like i'm not enjoy my course
S0530	mm
S0529	and
S0530	yeah definitely
S0529	i don't feel like i could've do the work
S0530	i mean i i guess a good flat mean that like you've get something nice to come home to
S0529	yeah exactly
S0530	whereas if your course be kind of terrible
S0529	and your flat's not very nice
S0530	and your flat
S0529	you just don't have anything to
S0530	and you just don't have anything to
S0529	yeah
S0530	yeah
S0529	yeah that's how i felt at except i do have cos that be like the i do have like a really cool city to go to all the time
S0530	mm like the first few weeks i think that i get on with flatmates but now like look back i really didn't
S0529	mm
S0530	maybe it's do you know what i mean like i think that like
S0529	you just get on with them for the sake of it kinda thing
S0530	yeah like i think that oh yeah we we be really like cool and like we're we're we're a good team and like but no compare to this flat no we weren't we weren't really
S0529	oh that's nice to hear
S0530	cos like yeah i mean they be old for me and they be like yeah
S0529	maybe not for you but that's yeah
S0530	cos they weren't horrible horrible people it be just like we be completely different
S0529	they just weren't like yeah
S0530	i couldn't talk to them
S0529	yeah
S0530	they didn't seem to like talk about anything except like i dunno just really trivial stuff
S0529	i mean didn't you say they weren't very nice to you like when they find out about the stuff
S0530	yeah they find out about stuff and cos i tell them because i have like like breakdowns at uni
S0529	yeah
S0530	and i tell them about it cos i live with them and i be like just it happen and stuff
S0529	yeah
S0530	and then it be just like i dunno they just didn't deal with it very well like they kind of like cos we we be get on really well until that point and then they be just like oh god oh god and i be like nobody really like
S0529	that's so shitty of them
S0530	like they seem to be
S0529	yeah
S0530	mm
S0530	er they didn't seem to get it like they didn't
S0529	mm
S0530	understand and they be like
S0529	that's not good
S0530	yeah
S0529	's better here
S0530	it be better here it's a lot better here it be more homely here i have to say like
S0529	yeah yeah i think the only things keep me here be this flat
S0530	mm
S0529	and
S0529	the prospect of like what go home would mean
S0530	yeah
S0529	in term of my life in general
S0530	yeah mm cos i guess you've get factor like pull you here which basically what be keep you here be the fear of go home
S0529	yeah
S0530	kind of thing
S0529	mm
S0530	rather than
S0529	yeah
S0530	which be a bite of a shame really because
S0529	it be but
S0530	it should be attractive things keep you here not the fear of leave but yeah
S0529	yeah i know
S0530	because i guess with student yeah
S0529	but then again like my flat be keep me here cos i don't wanna leave this place cos i like it
S0530	yeah
S0529	but
S0530	i like this flat i mean how do you how do you think you'd feel if you go home to
S0529	really lonely and
S0530	really lonely okay
S0529	really angry at myself i expect at not you know try harder
S0530	i mean do you think if you go home for a short time do you think you'd feel better or not
S0529	erm
S0530	like for a few weeks
S0529	no not really
S0530	no
S0529	because to be honest i don't feel like really erm i don't feel really depress or anything like that like i do last year
S0530	okay
S0529	it's more of an anxiety thing now i think
S0530	yeah
S0529	yeah i dunno but but then again i do feel like that a couple of weeks ago so
S0530	no yeah yeah i be think
S0529	it be just now i'm feel like okay
S0530	mm
S0529	but it just come and go really doesn't it
S0530	no absolutely like
S0529	mm
S0530	it's gonna like fluctuate
S0529	yeah but i just worry about like go home and get a job and that's it and that's all i'd have to do for the rest of my life cos i wouldn't
S0530	mm no
S0529	ever come back i don't think
S0530	no yeah it'd be a very decision
S0529	and it would get a lot harder to come back the more i the longer i leave it i don't have the option to like go travel or go to another country for a bite
S0530	i envy people who can just go travel
S0529	er who have money yeah i know
S0530	i know some people work hard and they get it
S0529	and yeah no they deserve it but yeah
S0530	but some people just don't work for it they just be
S0529	yeah
S0530	they're able to go and it's you know
S0529	but i mean i wouldn't be able to though if if even if i do work to get money i would have to pay that money back
S0530	mm
S0529	to the uni and to last year's uni and stuff like that and i'd have to pay for you know live at home and i'd have to pay my mum and
S0530	yeah
S0529	have to pay my phone bill and just stuff like that like
S0530	yeah mm
S0529	yeah so it wouldn't be very easy to save up for anything if i do wanna go and i wouldn't want to cos i'm not very good at
S0530	mm
S0529	go to other countries on my own i've not do it before
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	don't want to erm yeah so i just have to get job and then i'd just have to get more job and that would just be my life
S0530	oh my gosh
S0529	and it's just scary to think about it like that
S0530	mm
S0529	cos you know the reason we're at uni be to avoid that
S0530	definitely
S0529	prospect like it's to get a degree and have that instead of just have to get job after job
S0530	mm
S0529	it's just yeah it's just really scary
S0530	it be
S0529	and that's why i'm stay here really like that's what's keep me here
S0530	scary thing
S0529	i mean that's i suppose it's something
S0530	it be something like
S0529	yeah
S0530	as shitty
S0529	doesn't have to be all
S0530	as it can seem
S0529	sunshine and rainbows like i don't have to enjoy it i just have to get through it
S0530	cos yeah do you think
S0529	cos i enjoy some part of it like well not i don't know
S0530	i don't yeah
S0529	i don't really enjoy much to be honest but i i i dunno i'm content with some part of it
S0530	mm
S0529	be a better word
S0530	because when you're live at home like you're not necessarily content with everything either
S0529	no well i
S0530	yeah
S0529	wouldn't be cos my family would like be be a nightmare like they be last year
S0530	yeah mm
S0529	i'd get such judgement from my family and they'd always be on my back say like why be you not get a job
S0530	mm
S0529	like you need to get yourself together and all of this crap and it just wouldn't be very fun
S0530	no no no yeah definitely
S0529	and then you look you look at my sister who's gonna be really successful when she leave cos she's she's gonna get a first i know she's gonna get a first and then she's gonna go and do a master and then she's gonna become a professor and then she's gonna
S0530	be that what she want
S0529	and then she's gonna
S0530	professor
S0529	and that's what she want to do and then she's gonna write article and journals and book and be successful and even if it that doesn't happen she'll still be fine you know like she'll still be the superior one
S0530	be that how you feel about it
S0529	it's always gonna be like that yeah always and it's always gonna be like that and i'm okay with it because i i don't mind her have the sort of spotlight because i i don't like it like i don't think i would work well with that sort of thing cos it be a lot of pressure like
S0530	mm i mean but you're still important
S0529	you know
S0530	you're still
S0529	mm
S0530	intelligent
S0529	well
S0530	you're you've still get many qualities just as much as she do you know
S0529	i don't really feel like that but i don't
S0530	like do you think your your sister know that she's like can your do your sister like be she aware that she's smart and that she's
S0529	yeah yeah i think she be
S0530	cos maybe difference with her be that she can kind of see her qualities maybe like she's learn or maybe she's just that type of person who's just quite aware of what she's good at and for some people they just can't see the good in themselves you know
S0529	mm
S0530	and then they learn to see the good in themselves rather than you know just be able to be confident and like who they be
S0529	yeah
S0530	like some people can just well they always have just be comfortable with themselves but some people find it more difficult and it doesn't mean that you've not get as many qualities as she do like far from it it just mean maybe you'd find it more difficult to see good things in yourself than she do which might make you
S0529	mm yeah
S0530	god i sound like my counsellor
S0530	she use to say that sort of thing to me
S0529	it's good practice for when you become a counsellor
S0530	her i would be quite er quite nice to be a counsellor actually
S0529	you'd be a very good one
S0530	i'd like to do i'd like to work with young people i think
S0529	mm
S0530	like people our age
S0529	what sort of counsel though surely not cbt cos everyone hat
S0530	oh i don't know the type that's how inexperienced i be like i know there's cbt and it's there's
S0529	well i know there be two like
S0530	there's cbt
S0529	yeah
S0530	there's
S0529	i know like three i know about three there's cbt and there's like trauma counsel
S0530	mm
S0529	and then there's just like talk therapy
S0530	yeah yeah i mean i
S0529	yeah
S0530	i don't know what like specifically i would like to help people with like i don't see i i don't mind just general problems like i know it's like you can't really generalise in mental health but it isn't like okay this person have just problems with this or
S0529	mm
S0530	this person just have problems with that it's very complex like most people
S0529	mm
S0530	that go to counsellors have a range of problems despite have like one a couple of disorder it's like a range of
S0529	yeah
S0530	problems isn't it so it's not just like untangle one or two it's like kind of unwind the whole thing which i think i think it'd be quite an interest job it might be
S0529	mm
S0530	quite sad and it might be quite hard
S0529	yeah it would
S0530	but i'd i'd enjoy do that
S0529	but you'd feel good about it though cos you feel like you
S0530	you'd be make a difference
S0529	yeah
S0530	like a good a good therapist or a good counsellor make a really really good
S0529	yeah
S0530	difference to you like and i think have ones that be quite like particularly when you're young young counsellors as well like
S0529	yeah
S0530	it's it's important
S0529	mm
S0530	the age be relevant like a lot of the counsellors that that i've have have be way too old
S0529	yeah i find that as well
S0530	like fifty and it's like i couldn't really relate to them like
S0529	i suppose how long do it actually take to get into that kind of job cos
S0530	yeah
S0529	i don't know
S0530	i don't think it take very long it's just the more reputable ones have be do it longer
S0529	yeah
S0530	so they're gonna yeah
S0529	and they usually have like sciencey degrees as well some of them
S0530	some of them do yeah
S0529	if they're really high up
S0530	mm which be unfair because
S0529	i know
S0530	your social skills don't necessarily reflect
S0529	yeah
S0530	here we go good old google
S0529	yeah
S0530	it's rain
S0529	there be no minimum level of qualification that need to be reach
S0530	mm
S0529	one year full time that's not very long
S0530	that isn't very long be it
S0530	i'd i'd maybe like to do that once i leave uni though
S0529	or do it part time if you've get busy things on
S0530	possibly which i won't
S0530	let's face it
S0529	who know you might get knock up you might have kid
S0530	oh ha ha i might have kid
S0529	you might
S0530	quite funny if that actually do happen
S0529	who know what's gonna happen this week with that boy
S0530	oh god me and will have many children
S0529	you and
S0530	what if what happen if you could you have if you get pregnant at university would you have the option to stay
S0529	yeah of course you can stay at uni if you've get kid they're gonna discriminate that
S0530	yeah
S0529	yeah
S0530	yeah but what if you're live in halls
S0529	load well not load of people but some people do yeah like they they probably would tend to offer you like erm like studio apartments have you see those
S0530	yeah mm
S0529	like they advertise them sometimes at unis they usually for like young families and stuff
S0530	must be really hard yeah
S0529	and then they usually have a play school on university campus and they do here
S0530	ah
S0529	and they've get a nursery
S0530	do they get free nursery then
S0529	i'm not sure if it's free i don't know it might be
S0530	if it be then like that'd be amaze
S0529	they they've get one next to the next to the management build
S0530	not that i'm plan on get pregnant while i'm that would not be a good idea
S0529	no but just see next year they do have a nursery
S0530	so if that happen
S0529	yeah
S0530	it doesn't actually have to be something we worry about
S0529	often have vigorous entry procedures
S0530	imagine do pet counsel
S0529	oh wow
S0530	it's gonna be okay mr rabbit
S0529	there may be a minimum age limit interview and write assessments oh so once you're qualify you may choose to work privately or voluntarily within the nhs wait so it can't just be a year that's ridiculous
S0530	well if you think about it what be you do with your counsel you're talk you're learn skills it's not like
S0529	it's not actually yeah i know but it's not
S0530	yeah and you probably usually with these things you have to work in the nhs before you go by yourself sometimes i'm not sure
S0529	and they don't earn very much bloody hell nineteen thousand that's not very much
S0530	that be not much but for a starter job
S0529	yeah
S0530	like i guess if you're private you could charge more but that's greedy
S0529	most employers prefer you to have
S0530	but the thing be look at a financial side a lot of people have mental health problems and a lot of parent who can afford it want to send their kid to good counsellors cos they think they can get the help quicker for one
S0529	yeah
S0530	and they can get better help so
S0529	well that's why you should go private really
S0530	yeah yeah
S0529	i'd wanna go private if i be a counsellor
S0530	yeah exactly cos some of the nhs ones be shite
S0529	but i wouldn't make it expensive
S0530	no yeah
S0529	only if it affordable cos i know how annoy it be to not be able to afford a good counsellor
S0530	definitely
S0529	mm yeah it's just a piss take
S0530	cos you could do a range because i know somebody like i i use to speak to one of my counsellors about the sort of stuff she do cos i be quite interest in it and she do like a range like i remember i i go in to her room in her house and she have like shelve of like squishy ball and toy and i ask what they be for and she be like oh some of the children that i like that i with trauma like trauma therapy and stuff with some of the kid like they kind of come in and play
S0529	mm mm yeah
S0530	and they use toy to kind of like get stuff out of the kid in art and stuff
S0529	yeah
S0530	which be nice isn't it like
S0529	yeah it's funny though i've never ask her actually cos we're not as close as me and my other auntie but one of my aunties be actually a counsellor now like
S0530	mm
S0529	a proper she study for like five years or something so she's
S0530	mm
S0529	like a good proper counsellor and she use to like ask me if i could borrow if she could borrow my like dolls and my playmobil things
S0530	oh wow
S0529	to take with her like for her for her train so that she could use them with the
S0530	yeah mm
S0529	with the clients to like explain things better cos sometimes it do work better like that yeah maybe i should ask her about it actually haven't really think about it before
S0530	you could be a good counsellor i think
S0529	she'd probably have a i don't think so i just need a job really i just don't
S0530	no but i think counsel cos you're you're like one of the best listeners i've ever like
S0529	oh thank
S0530	yeah you be though
S0529	that's a good compliment
S0530	it be i think it's an underestimate compliment
S0529	yeah
S0530	like you be a good listener
S0529	it's nice to listen
S0530	and a good talker and a good listener it's not like
S0529	well i'm not a good talker but
S0530	you're a good talker you're interest like i like the stuff that you say
S0529	well no i'm but i prefer listen
S0530	and you also listen to me so that's cool
S0529	mm
S0530	it's a nice balance
S0529	yeah
S0530	i've also learn like from actually experience counsel like the sort of weird trick they have like
S0529	yeah
S0530	if you they won't get anything out of you they kinda say it another way like
S0529	mm
S0530	they say okay but then like say if you're at the toilet hey do you want to talk about that
S0530	he go no it's okay so you draw that picture for me then that's that's nice
S0530	and it go so do you think why why do you think you've draw him like that it's like that that's exactly what they do
S0529	that's so funny
S0530	i would not be like a horrible counsellor like i'd talk to them like they be equal to me cos that's
S0529	well that's the train part isn't it that's what they teach you in train like how to deal with
S0530	that be important yeah exactly
S0529	but then you'd end up probably not use them they're so
S0530	they're so archaic and old like
S0529	stupid yeah
S0530	you don't want
S0529	yeah
S0530	cos like you know
S0529	and people can see right through you when you do those things
S0530	like if you're watch like the old way of counsel like you know girl interrupt and all that kind of stuff
S0529	yeah
S0530	like there's such like a superiority
S0529	yeah there really be
S0530	and that like you wouldn't want that i love we need to watch that film at some point
S0529	yes it's so depress i love it
S0530	it's so good like the whole thing be just depress but
S0529	mm
S0530	it's a good film
S0529	angelina jolie be so good in that film
S0530	she's she's so hot in that film as well
S0529	yeah i know the blonde it look so good
S0530	it's sad as well

S0529	er
S0530	mm
S0529	no that wouldn't really work
S0530	it's crazy we be do about in gender women's study today we be do about gender in class and we be talk about all the it really i i know quite a lot of them already like the statistics but like just hear again they just it put into perspective how big the gap be

S0530	it be like the top one percent of the population have
S0529	yeah
S0530	more income than sixty percent of the rest of everyone
S0529	well it's this stupid idea that the government have get that the wealth will trickle down from the rich to the poor
S0530	no
S0529	i mean as if like that's really the complete opposite of what be happen right now
S0530	of course that's not gonna happen
S0529	but that's what they're say with this austerity measure thing like we're just gonna cut everyone's pay erm but the rich don't lose any money pretty much
S0530	they don't
S0529	because they're expect their wealth to affect people on the lower level and it just doesn't
S0530	of course that's not gonna happen
S0529	because they avoid tax and all of this stuff and it's just yeah it's
S0530	gary barlow be a tax avoider
S0529	be he
S0530	mm
S0529	shit
S0530	well he be be find to

S0530	i've see him in the kitchen laugh
S0529	really
S0530	like just throw his head back and just laugh his head off it's so weird
S0530	but yeah it's very strange
S0529	gary

S0529	i've always think of him as of as have like a really slow northern voice
S0530	oh he do
S0529	and then he come from where you live
S0530	yeah
S0529	it's quite funny really
S0530	i forget all those voice like he's like
S0529	your your voice isn't as slow as his though
S0530	what's be his voice really slow
S0529	yeah
S0530	be my voice really slow
S0529	but i think it's no i just say it wasn't at all
S0530	oh not that slow
S0529	it's no it's not slow at all it's like a normal voice it's just northern

S0530	oh my god
S0529	yeah i think i don't know
S0530	that's like yorkshire that we're not we're not quite yorkshire
S0529	no
S0530	people round here speak really like if you hear people on bus and stuff
S0529	yeah speak really slowly
S0530	oh yeah
S0529	yeah i dunno how you'd get on with my friend she speak like so fast you just can't understand what she's say most of the time
S0530	be do she speak in like a southern er like
S0529	well it's not southern it's just like my accent it's like no
S0530	oh right okay
S0529	it's not really very accenty accent but she just speak way too fast it's hilarious
S0530	oh my
S0529	yeah
S0530	some people just speed like oh my god
S0529	i know it's i dunno how they can cos i always trip over my word like all the time
S0530	same i go fast god
S0529	i know i find speak really difficult sometimes
S0530	same i don't understand like
S0529	like it should be second nature cos it's like speak you know it's like breathe but it's not
S0530	i think cos of grammar and
S0529	yeah
S0530	like structure you're like
S0529	yeah
S0530	cos you start to say one more thing and then you change and you're like hang on my whole sentence do not make sense now
S0529	yeah i just don't have a very like extensive word bank like i haven't really
S0530	neither do i particularly
S0529	so no i don't really know very many big word
S0530	but who want to speak with word that nobody understand in real life
S0529	well
S0530	you you just imagine if you come in say it's most
S0529	no i don't
S0530	er today
S0529	when i be on holiday a few years ago i be like walk round in my hat say like i cannot abide this heat cos i i'd read load of like jane austen and that's what happen like when i read certain book it rub off on me like the language in the book so if i'm like read dickens i'll start speak like

S0529	like i'm from a dickens novel it's really funny
S0530	what just accidentally
S0529	yeah just like by accident
S0530	oh my god
S0529	and so i just say really archaic word
S0530	that's so funny i'll know when you start read again then because you'll start speak like a twat
S0529	yeah exactly yep exactly
S0530	that'll be yeah
S0529	you'll you'll definitely know oh it's so fun
S0530	oh
S0529	wish i could do some more art but i don't really

S0530	uni cos it's nice and it's well it's not like maybe i don't know about teach though like mm
S0529	yeah i always think about teach but it do feel a bite of a fallback to me
S0530	but then i like my write and i like yeah cos i like people but i also like my craft
S0529	yeah
S0530	if i can call it my craft
S0529	no it be yeah
S0530	i don't think i'd wanna be a lecturer though at all i feel like it it's a very lonely life
S0529	yeah
S0530	and i'm not that person i'm not that girl
S0529	the funny thing be like my sister and her boyfriend want to both want to be lechers lecturers
S0530	that's gonna be the best partnership
S0529	and they're like
S0530	partnership
S0529	and they're gonna be so rich if they get through all this
S0530	yeah
S0529	if they become like proper good lecturers they be gonna be so like load
S0530	what subject do your sister's boyfriend wanna do then
S0529	er he do philosophy and english light at the minute
S0530	oh okay
S0529	i know it's crazy i dunno how he do it and he's like
S0530	wow
S0529	really clever
S0530	do he enjoy it that and he's really into it
S0529	yeah he's so into it it's ridiculous i dunno how anyone can do philosophy it's like the hardest thing i've ever do in my life
S0530	the hardest subject yeah
S0529	and i only do it like at a level so for like a year as well i didn't even finish it and it be only like light philosophy as well and i be still like mind blow every time
S0530	oh my god
S0529	i would just come out of the out of the lecture just like oh just like cry like no i don't understand just stop
S0530	oh my god
S0529	fry my brain oh it would literally just be like be this table that i'm sit on actually a table or
S0530	really
S0529	be it just the illusion of a table that's
S0530	how do that work of course it's a table
S0529	it's doesn't work it's just fuck stupid
S0530	course it's a fuck table
S0529	it's really stupid
S0530	somebody make the fuck table
S0529	i know
S0530	which be why it be a table
S0529	yeah but how do they make the table out of what
S0530	wood
S0529	yeah but before that
S0530	marble
S0529	it's
S0530	what
S0529	it's all atoms it's all just nothing
S0530	no it be because atoms be something right
S0529	yeah but you can't see them
S0530	yeah but atoms be
S0529	and this be the really frustrate debate we're have
S0529	it be like that
S0530	but but they're a different kind of atom then
S0529	yeah but who who's to say that someone's not just like press button on a control panel and make us see this table that doesn't actually exist it's just a simulation of a table
S0530	okay
S0529	there we go
S0530	sorry to trash your room
S0529	and then we and then it come into we have no free will
S0530	so this this be
S0529	and that we're all just sims be control
S0530	that have be put there by somebody on a computer
S0529	who know you know they could've just control you to do that
S0530	so i rebel against that
S0529	no you didn't though cos it
S0529	oh it's just really fuck head fuck it really be
S0530	how can they sleep at night
S0529	yeah i know
S0530	like this bed be not real
S0529	that's why i would never ever wanna be a philosopher
S0530	i might not be comfy
S0529	yeah
S0530	but then again it might be quite satisfy like
S0529	i mean that's and that's just like the simple stuff like that be literally in our first lecture to get us introduce to it and then after that it be all just like theory
S0530	mm
S0529	and it be so confuse like you don't even know
S0530	my god
S0529	oh my god
S0530	i wouldn't enjoy study philosophy
S0529	i i really didn't wanna do it yeah cos i be study philosophy and ethics so it be supposedly like a little lighter than actual philosophy
S0530	mm
S0529	cos there be also a philosophy a level but i didn't do that and i think it would be a bite easier but it really wasn't
S0530	oh my god i can imagine
S0529	it be horrible but abortion week be fun
S0530	abortion week
S0529	yeah
S0530	what do you do about in that obviously abortion but
S0529	but i i'm obviously pro choice and most people weren't pro choice
S0530	oh yeah
S0529	and i be just like
S0530	they weren't
S0529	scream at them like why be you not pro choice
S0530	woman's body woman's right
S0529	woman's uterus woman's right
S0529	yeah exactly i know it be really fun to be
S0530	also you saw in my essay that i write for my thing the argument against abortion be unnatural be animals make their own abortions so
S0529	mm
S0530	so can humans
S0529	yeah
S0530	like it's not just it's not exclusive to humans like animals like monkey pull their nipples and make it make them like lose their baby if they don't want miscarriage yeah
S0529	really wow
S0530	like they do stuff with their nipples they play with their nipples
S0529	imagine if it be that easy for us
S0530	well it's not just like touch your nipple
S0529	just boop
S0530	bye it's it's not that
S0529	oh we're pregnant again
S0530	it's more like
S0529	boop
S0530	it's more it's like literally they probably have to torture themselves
S0529	oh
S0530	like do it but like
S0529	that's horrible
S0530	but like yeah
S0529	oh
S0530	but
S0529	how do that actually work
S0530	erm i don't know you haven't you might have to find it it's chimpanzees so
S0529	that's really it's really confuse
S0530	and yeah they they can like pull themselves open or and like take the baby out or suck the baby out depend on their body
S0529	oh my god
S0530	yeah it's horrible
S0529	that be horrible
S0530	but it just prove that like other animals do it for certain reason
S0529	ah
S0530	so should humans like i know we've get science that have help us
S0529	yeah i mean we have to use coat hangers you know it's just awful
S0530	do we
S0529	yeah do you not know about the coat hanger thing
S0530	no
S0529	have you never see an an abortion like demonstration against it obviously and there be like usually banners with coat hangers on and stuff that's why
S0530	yeah yeah i didn't know oh my god
S0529	cos women use to use coat hangers and just like claw it
S0530	well we don't use coat hangers any more so that's probably an invalid argument
S0529	no we don't well yeah but like i dunno it's just bring it back isn't it
S0529	but we have to watch a video on it and it be like why on earth be you show us this cos it's just gonna freak people out and make people like not wanna do it and it be just put it in such a bias kind of
S0530	mm
S0529	it be just so bias and it shouldn't've be it be a level you know we're all mature enough to understand like
S0530	mm
S0529	it be just so stupid it wasn't even a christian
S0530	would you i mean would you have an abortion
S0529	it be like a non religious college
S0530	mm
S0529	at all would i would i have an abortion
S0530	mm
S0529	yeah
S0530	i would if i want one definitely
S0529	yeah i mean i know it's not as easy as say that when when you're in the situation but i think i would yeah
S0530	mm yeah me too
S0529	i'm certainly not against it i don't believe in the whole bullshit of like oh it's a human life what if it cure cancer like oh fuck off
S0530	it yeah if i want to keep it'd be cos yeah
S0529	what if i don't know that ant you step could've cure cancer
S0529	you never know these things
S0529	and you're not gonna know them like
S0530	what if that little ant we step on be gonna grow up
S0529	and do you know the amount of egg we lose whenever we have periods like that's the exact same thing you're lose when you have an abortion like it's fuck stupid
S0530	yeah that egg could've cure cancer bye bye
S0529	yeah exactly just
S0529	just stop and you flush it down the toilet how do you feel about that
S0530	imagine like the sperms compete like
S0529	yeah
S0530	no i must get there and it's like i'm gonna be the cure for cancer i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it i'm gonna oh no
S0529	i know it's just the most ridiculous thing ever and they're so silly
S0530	yeah
S0530	it's weird think like do you think the government know the cure to cancer
S0529	yeah i think medical company aren't tell us that there's
S0530	i i believe they're not more honest in fact
S0529	well they make profit on our pain
S0530	it's prove it's prove that meat
S0529	don't they
S0530	eat cause cancer despite
S0529	yeah
S0530	say as long as meat be eat in moderation it doesn't like fuck that it do
S0529	yeah it do yeah it really do
S0530	so you know
S0529	no because medical
S0530	yeah
S0529	company make money off us when we're ill why
S0530	yeah
S0529	would they want to give us the cure for things so maybe we do who know
S0530	exactly
S0529	maybe they're just not try hard enough to find it like it isn't that easy to find
S0530	and why haven't have and why hasn't anyone in royal family have cancer
S0529	well yeah exactly like they're all pretty old and it doesn't discriminate do it like
S0530	no
S0529	well it kinda do with old people but they be old so they should get cancer and they don't
S0530	mm and they eat meat
S0529	do they eat meat
S0530	yeah
S0529	oh yeah they do don't they yeah mm
S0530	duck
S0529	i mean expect they have really stringent not stringent like really
S0530	they have the best quality meat they'll have like minimal hormones and shit
S0529	strict diet and er like really good yeah and like really good diet and really good doctor and whatever but yeah maybe they have
S0530	i suppose you could have cancer but keep it from everyone like
S0529	we don't have yeah that's true
S0530	but and they get the best treatment possible and they probably get regular check
S0529	yeah they always get the best treatment
S0530	like the old ones
S0529	oh absolutely i know they i know they don't have to wait in line for an nhs doctor
S0530	i feel like princess diana would've be like a good royal family representative if she'd live you know
S0529	i know she really be
S0530	cos she seem really cool and she
S0529	yeah
S0530	talk about like mental illness
S0529	do she
S0530	she do speeches about it and the royal family didn't like her because she be too human almost you know
S0529	yeah
S0530	she be too like down with everyone
S0529	yeah it wasn't very nice
S0530	yeah
S0529	what happen
S0530	i find her really interest actually like although
S0529	so do i i remember i use to like watch load of documentaries on her
S0530	about her crash and stuff yeah
S0529	yeah and like about the conspiracy behind it and stuff
S0530	mm i use to watch all sort like that
S0529	that apparently it be kind of like fix or something i use to watch load of royal things
S0530	mm
S0530	yeah same
S0529	i still kind of do i'm i'm quite fascinate by the royal family actually in a weird way
S0530	me too
S0529	although if there be a documentary on like harry and what's his face erm william i would watch it
S0530	they should do like the lion king but a royal family version
S0529	yeah they do though there be like a documentary about twenty years ago when they just let erm cameras into the royal family for like to just film them
S0530	what in their house
S0529	in their house yeah
S0530	like almost like a big brother thing
S0529	yeah like a reality tv show thing
S0530	that be crazy
S0529	i know it's ridiculous
S0530	they do that
S0529	they do that honestly
S0530	i i wanna watch this at some point
S0529	i don't think you can watch it any more cos it's be like take off cos they didn't want it to be show any more like now because that's become so like prevalent
S0530	oh my god someone should've record
S0529	erm in culture like that reality tv would've be like really quite
S0530	wow

S0530	charles
S0529	god
S0529	oh yeah but like cos at the time they do it because they think it would erm it would stop the cameras like be so erm like insistent like always outside the house and stuff by like give a few access
S0530	well that be a bite of a silly decision
S0529	i know it kind of backfire like give them access to their like private life would help that cos i think it would like satiate the press and like
S0530	mm
S0529	it just
S0530	no

S0529	yeah
S0530	so cute
S0529	i want a pretty baby
S0530	i want a pretty baby
S0529	i don't baby that be ugly this be why i need to marry someone who's good look cos i don't have much go for me so i need them to like
S0530	shut up
S0529	create most of the the genes for the child really
S0530	i think your combination would go well with
S0529	mm
S0530	like a dark person like a dark haired person
S0529	mm but see i can't marry a black person cos what if the kid be black and ginger
S0530	wow
S0529	like could that happen
S0530	i think
S0529	surely
S0530	i think most of the time it's like the black gene be dominant so
S0529	i know yeah well that's fine then i could marry a black man
S0530	and the black hair be usually dominant as well but also ginger be usually dominant so you know
S0529	yeah that's the problem
S0530	but you're not quite ginger be you
S0529	but i have the ginger gene
S0530	or be you
S0529	it just didn't quite win out
S0530	you're sort of
S0529	because
S0530	semi ginger
S0529	yeah
S0530	but not yeah
S0529	i don't really know how it work actually it must've be recessive i don't know but ginger isn't recessive be it
S0530	i think ginger wasn't
S0529	no it
S0530	yeah
S0529	can't be cos it be the stronger one so many i'm maybe i'm not actually ginger i just yeah it's weird
S0530	like be brown hair have i dunno
S0529	mm
S0530	cos i do i kind of don't wanna
S0530	our my child be gonna look so bore if i marry someone with brown hair and brown eye
S0529	do you always have brown hair
S0530	yeah
S0529	cos some people have blonde when they're younger don't they so
S0530	yeah i have brown hair
S0529	yeah
S0530	well it's just be brown
S0529	cos i have like white blonde hair when i be younger
S0530	mm
S0529	and now it's go darker it's still go darker it's gonna get darker than this i reckon cos when i be like about i don't know like early teens it be a lot lighter than this
S0530	mm
S0529	it's really get darker over the years which be sad
S0530	yeah it's a nice hair colour though
