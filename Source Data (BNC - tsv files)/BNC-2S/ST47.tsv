S0018	so what do your tutor say
S0125	i'm just go to this be the last page
S0018	oh okay
S0125	easier really
S0018	can i pop this on the floor just
S0125	yeah of course yep help yourself so my tutor send me some feedback about um the draft
S0018	uh huh
S0125	um and
S0018	oh be that what your status update be
S0125	errr
S0018	something about thank for tell me with like twenty four hours notice that
S0125	no
S0125	oh i don't know about that um yeah so my tutor send me err feedback on the draft and it's really helpful actually because i send it to the one who be not my course director and she be normally quite um restrictive with her comment she doesn't seem to like to help um people um out that much but this guy this tutor have give me some really constructive um feedback
S0125	um which have enable me to um make my final change to the document and go over the word count unfortunately quite a lot but um quite significantly but um hopefully with your help i can get it down
S0125	um
S0018	what kind of feedback do he give you be it
S0125	errm
S0018	what to add or what to take out or
S0125	he he suggest i actually change the title of the document which i don't i don't agree with but anyway that's fine
S0018	uh huh
S0125	he ask me to define whether there's a formal strategy document for a particular question that i'm try to answer erm and he my question to him be i'm concern that it's not critical enough
S0018	mm
S0125	in term of a review erm but erm he say that his observation be yes you can make it more critical by link the ideas that i have together erm and be err create a stronger argument either by link them through the report or raise clear question at the end
S0018	okay do they impose the the title on you
S0125	no no it's my title
S0018	oh right and what have you choose
S0125	um the title of the report be um how do design and cultural value within nordic design lead businesses influence digital and visual communications
S0018	oh wow
S0125	um so i'm look at a few different things there but i'm look at communications how they be influence by design and cultural value
S0018	mm mm
S0125	within a business which happen to be in the nordic region which happen to be design lead
S0018	mm mm
S0125	um and er use the case study of my time spend work at the placement in the in
S0018	oh okay so it's not just a report on what you learn and stuff it's actually put it into
S0018	an academic well a
S0125	yeah
S0018	practical context
S0125	yeah it's about um
S0018	critically analyse it
S0125	it's i've i've propose the piece of work myself so it's not it's not in answer to a explicit brief it's um it's of my own investigation and proposal so that's what i'm try to answer
S0018	and what do he suggest that you should change the title to
S0125	he suggest um how do the case study this this this business how do erm open bracket a design lead nordic business close bracket use cultural and design value to direct the communications strategy which i think i don't like because it's move away slightly from from my original
S0018	it be cos yours
S0125	proposal
S0018	yours isn't just about the design strategy it's about the digital and visual communications
S0125	yes yes
S0018	hmm
S0125	so i'm not i'm not oblige to change it that's fine
S0018	mm mm
S0125	and i can ignore it if i choose to but i think i'm fine with it i'm not go to start change the title of a document at the last minute just because i've get one piece of advice tell me to
S0018	yeah
S0125	when in the whole process of this project which be about six weeks now so far nobody have ask me to change the title and this tutor have see this document this proposal all the way through the project so why at the last minute tell me to change it i'm not quite sure
S0018	do do he say that it that the title best that this title best suit the content because if you change the title you would imagine that you'd have to rejuggle the content
S0125	his his first observation be the title need to be review to make it more concise without really change the mean or scope of the research
S0018	oh okay so it's not semantics
S0125	conciseness
S0018	it's just make the title shorter but the title that he's suggest be actually change the focus isn't it
S0125	to me it felt like that yep so that's why i'm ignore it
S0018	yep
S0125	yep
S0018	yep good idea
S0018	be there do you want to try and make the title a bite more concise
S0125	no i'm fine with it i i'm not bother what i'm more bother about be the conciseness to the to the content
S0018	yep
S0125	i think that's the more critical
S0018	mm mm
S0125	nature because it's a a three thousand word report it have to be really concise
S0018	mm mm yes that's sometimes the most difficult thing isn't it
S0125	yeah
S0018	keep within the word limit okay so what when i proofread it what kind of things do you want me to focus on
S0125	erm
S0018	in particular
S0125	erm like i say before um any instance of repetition um any um obvious um confuse arguments erm er anywhere you see that it's not concise
S0018	yeah have you get have you get somewhere i can
S0125	yeah of course
S0018	can write down
S0125	here you go hold on
S0018	ooh you've get post its oh look at ooh look at these post its
S0125	i know
S0018	that's amaze
S0125	that's my selection
S0018	where do you get that from
S0125	w h smith's
S0018	beautiful ooh i like it okay so sorry repeat conciseness
S0125	conciseness any repetition
S0018	uh huh
S0125	um and erm confuse argument
S0018	confuse argument
S0125	this be actually the diary that i keep when i be there
S0018	oh okay
S0125	reflective diary didn't go that well
S0018	mm mm
S0125	because normally on my reflective diaries i try to leave one page for the day's observation and leave the next page free for return to that observation but as you can see on that one it's blank
S0125	so i haven't really reflect on that day
S0125	erm yes but anyway it be a useful tool none the less
S0018	be that what your case study base on note observation note
S0125	erm yeah the methodology be um er a mixture of traditional case study do through erm a couple of interview erm er observation erm it's all qualitative erm and er then i've add into the mix a little bite of more erm which i've use the word holistic
S0018	mm mm
S0125	to describe um my approach because i want to do it ethnographically however the timescale be too short to do it it be a four week
S0125	what would that mean then
S0018	ethnographic erm be generally widely erm understand as be when a researcher go into a community or group of people and become a native to that group
S0018	mm mm
S0125	erm and
S0018	but you want to do
S0125	and behave as behave as one of them live with them eat with them work with them you know but erm er and i want to do that to do that visually by um take photographic and video evidence of er erm of of my time in that group but um i do do this i do take photographic evidence and i've use quite a bite of it in the report
S0018	mm mm
S0125	it's quite a visual report but um er i don't know erm there be some conflict and er it be slightly contentious um argument in er with my um not argument discussion with my um course tutor about use that particular methodology so i've change it to case study through um observation
S0018	mm mm
S0125	interview and participatory um observation
S0018	okay
S0125	because um i be one of them i be work for them rather than a pure um silent observer
S0018	yep
S0125	erm
S0018	cool okay so erm well shall i get down to read it and then we'll have a brainstorm session
S0125	if you like shall i give you a highlighter pen would that help
S0018	yep probably
S0125	erm it hasn't print out the um er annotations to the to the image but that's fine cos i'll go through that and sort that
S0018	okay
S0125	erm there you go
S0018	cool
S0125	um what else yeah thank you
S0018	you're welcome what you gonna do when while i'm do this
S0125	erm just go to work that bite out
S0018	okay i'll put my head down and start read then
S0125	so what do you think about read that work
S0018	yeah i think what what do you mean if it be easy to read or if it answer the question or
S0125	well i mean no um what what do you actually think of the subject things like that
S0018	really interest
S0125	yeah
S0018	yeah i think it be cos it kind of it do it it go into stuff that you don't really think about when you when you think about a when you haven't study stuff like this and you see a company and how they're communicate to the audience
S0125	yeah
S0018	you're the audience but you don't really realise that there be a strategy behind the communication
S0125	yeah i think sometimes it's um intrinsic
S0018	yeah
S0125	or um er sometimes recognise but i think um er what's interest for me be the comparisons you can draw between this which be talk about communication strategies and um strategies in design management because um when people talk about design in erm they um famous designers like um oh who's the guy that um er german designer that's really famous for design really simple things braun you know the manufacturer
S0018	mm mm
S0125	braun braun um talk about how design should be um effortless you don't even notice it's there
S0018	mm mm yeah
S0125	and um so when you realise that there's a strategy behind something for me it's like the um comparison that i'm draw be the same as when a designer talk about a a really well function um exquisite piece of design that you don't even realise it's be design and it's design to function in a certain way it's the same thing
S0018	mm yeah it's just there it work you just don't realise that it's have a lot of think put into it in a way it's like mad men you know when you see behind the scenes of what go into an advertise campaign
S0125	oh yeah yeah
S0018	it's like you know they they think about every single little visual bite of communication
S0125	have you read any of the blog that's on the guardian website about mad men
S0018	er no
S0125	you should read it because if you're a fan of it it every episode get um um dissect
S0018	oh yeah
S0125	through the blog and erm you can read about the nuances and the reference that you probably didn't realise why they be there
S0018	uh huh
S0125	um that signify things to do with um a political um occasion or a historical event
S0018	mm mm
S0125	like i thin kin the last episode he he talk about a murder or a murderer in texas that's where um a famous murderer and he like correct the pronunciation or the um one character er don draper correct who's the kind of weasly um character
S0018	oh yeah um
S0125	the really annoy one
S0018	pete campbell
S0125	pete campbell he correct him because he use the wrong umm name to describe this murderer and so it put it into the context of the history that's happen at the time
S0018	ah yeah
S0125	and that's why you know it sort of add but the blog article be really interest to read because he explain more about the script
S0018	mm mm
S0125	the scriptwriting and the the production the production value and things like that i think
S0018	yeah that's really interest
S0125	yeah
S0018	no i get into do you watch lose
S0125	no only the first series really
S0018	really no i get really into lose and i spend more time after watch it check out the different theories of each different episode and um online
S0125	oh do you
S0125	so people use to write on forums
S0018	yeah
S0125	or comment on blog and things about it
S0018	yeah yeah and it be all dissect cos there be a lot of cross reference i really like it because it didn't explicitly make everything very obvious
S0125	no
S0018	it it rely
S0125	no which be a criticism of american um drama or any kind of tv that come out of america that it's dumbed down
S0018	yes but it yeah i like the fact that it assume that its viewer be intelligent and kind of dangle little bits in front of you
S0125	titbits
S0018	to see if you could make the connections
S0018	and so it be it's like there be a lot of cross reference because they be jump backwards and forward in time a lot as well
S0125	mm
S0018	you kind of click on relationships between different people
S0125	yeah
S0018	that didn't really matter to the er you know the momentum of the plot but you think oh wow of course cos he know her from when he meet her mother on a plane
S0125	mm
S0018	go to blah blah blah and so they be oh he do know her it's not important to how the plot be
S0125	no but
S0018	be move along but like yeah the total geek squad pick up on little things that
S0125	but isn't it kind of like a common thread that draw all these um script writers together be their nerdiness sometimes isn't it
S0125	they're often accuse of be nerds
S0018	probably
S0125	and kind of obsessional about things and like that um film director kevin smith he's like this he he's a real sort of geek but produce some great film like like um dogma
S0018	uh huh yeah
S0125	and um oh chase amy
S0018	yeah
S0125	remember that film
S0018	yeah yeah
S0125	kind of cult status film
S0018	with ben affleck and
S0125	hmm
S0018	yeah that kind of crowd
S0125	yeah matt damon ooh pizza
S0018	pizza
S0018	so in your opinion would you say mad men be the most enjoyable american series of all time or what would be
S0125	no
S0018	which what would you say be then
S0125	better sex and the city
S0018	do you think so
S0125	yeah
S0018	really
S0125	longer run yeah
S0018	but in term of your enjoyment of it
S0125	sex and the city more enjoyable
S0018	that's really funny cos i find sex and the city quite entertain but i don't see it as be yes that's like oscar oscar quality whereas things like mad men and for me lose be
S0125	hmm well they do win lot of award didn't they
S0018	and friends of course friends be brilliant
S0125	hmm
S0018	although it's so date now i be watch a couple of episodes
S0125	i i mean i watch friends but i be never like a friends freak i didn't like really love it do you use to watch it a lot
S0018	mm mm yep and then rewatch it when i live in barcelona we do a month of friends dvds we watch all of the ten series in about a month
S0125	oh my god
S0018	in winter after work just get through about six episodes a night
S0125	be spanish tv that bad
S0018	mm mm yep spanish tv you probably end up for have two hours of tv you end up watch one hour of advert so it be
S0125	horrendous
S0018	do you watch um you be an expert in nordic things do you watch the kill
S0125	mm yeah i love that yeah do you watch it
S0018	yeah i rate it too
S0125	i think it be great then the second series as well be great as well
S0018	hmm
S0018	i think it be but the second series i didn't think be um i think sometimes they be just inject twist and turn into the plot that didn't really need to be there
S0125	hmm really
S0018	it felt maybe a bite contrive at time
S0125	oh okay well i like both
S0018	but
S0125	i think the act be brilliant
S0018	extremely entertain yeah
S0125	i be like wait every saturday oh there's a ne one start as well on bbc4 call the bridge

S0018	hmm that's right that annoy me as well
S0125	why
S0018	because i i prefer things to either be self contain in one episode or ongoing over a series
S0125	why
S0018	i don't know i don't know cos if if it's go to be self contain it's just better to get it all over and do in one sit

S0125	hmm
S0018	what's this sauce like be it oh garlicy
S0125	it's quite nice
S0018	it's alright it's not worth eat the crust for though
S0125	you don't eat crust
S0018	mm if i'm super hungry yeah
S0018	it depend on what the crust or what the what the base of the pizza's like as well if it's morish yes if it's just a base then no
S0125	mm this be a good combination of flavour though isn't it
S0018	mm mm
S0125	i think i'll get this do
S0018	what time's it get to be hand in
S0125	midday
S0018	well you can work on it tomorrow morning then as well
S0125	i don't really like work in it in the mornings
S0018	hm
S0125	cos no make me happy that it's do
S0018	hm
S0125	but it depend how late it go tonight i suppose
S0018	but then do you work better at night
S0125	i don't
S0018	really when do you work better
S0125	in the mornings
S0018	well it would stand to reason maybe you do a couple more hours tonight have a good night's sleep and get up early and do it then
S0125	yeah you're probably right i have to get it to the printers though as well
S0018	how come
S0125	cos it's get to be print
S0018	can you not just print it out here
S0125	i could but i like to get them bind
S0018	mm
S0125	and these here these be all like my previous ones
S0018	oh good
S0125	i've be like keep a copy of each
S0018	mm
S0125	everything i've hand in i've keep i've have a copy do so i'm build up like a bite of an archive of work really
S0018	mm mm
S0125	because because really you hand in this work you spend a great deal of your time study but then what have you get to show for it cos actually the work be
S0018	knowledge
S0125	yes but
S0125	it's good to have these point of reference to go back to isn't it
S0018	mm yeah
S0125	erm and learn from
S0018	yep definitely
S0125	or reflect upon maybe so when you get the feedback back the feedback back
S0125	from your course tutor you can look over what they've say in relation to the piece of work with the actual piece of work in front of you and make more sense of it
S0018	true where will you get it print
S0125	in town mailboxes it's um it's on colmer road
S0018	be it expensive to bind it and
S0125	it can be it's normally about twenty pound
S0018	really
S0125	yeah
S0125	yeah but i i just i feel like it's worth it because this course it it mean a lot to me
S0018	yeah and for the durability if you're go to keep on refer to it hm and do you think that once you finish the course and you're out there back again do the business side of it that you will that there'll be a lot of things that you think oh yes i remember read something about that what do it do you think it will be you'll come back and refer to things
S0125	hmm
S0018	things like that or
S0125	i think so i think also it's about expand my knowledge like you say and have more reference to call upon when you want to try and justify
S0018	mm
S0125	a belief that you have in in a business context it's always a stronger argument if you can back it up with some evidence
S0018	hm
S0125	so this be all evidence gather in a way
S0018	will you do that to the client or in your own in your own interest
S0125	in my own way of course it will be different because it won't be in an academic context and often it's about smaller piece of information that you can get across clearly and concisely and easily
S0018	mm mm
S0125	that anybody can understand but if i have the academic understand i can transpose it translate it
S0018	yeah
S0125	into whichever context it need to be in
S0018	mm
S0125	so i think that's good and it make me feel cleverer
S0125	cleverer
S0018	it give you more perception more
S0018	better grammar not
S0125	mm more clever
S0018	yeah i find that after do um the diploma
S0125	mm
S0018	in teach that er i actually felt it kind of mess with my head after i just compete it and that when i be teach i be just aware of all the different possible factor or effect and consequences involve in every single step of every single stage of a lesson that i find it quite overwhelm
S0125	because you have
S0018	because i'd study it so in depth but then after a couple of months i just start actually feel a lot more confident that oh no actually i don't have to think about every single little detail i just have to focus on certain areas and i felt a lot more confident
S0125	that's good
S0018	yeah
S0125	it's just choose what information to use isn't it
S0018	mm
S0125	and what to discard like my report
S0018	oh no but if you don't have to if it's not like of paramount importance
S0018	that you cut it down i mean how many word do you reckon you'll be able to get away with
S0125	it'd be nice to get to three thousand five hundred
S0018	and what be it at now
S0125	hmm
S0018	it be four thousand four hundred wasn't it
S0125	four thousand five hundred i still have to cut a thousand from it like yeah so it's that middle portion isn't it
S0018	yeah
S0125	hm
S0018	do you have any idea of any bits that you're just gonna cut out completely
S0125	hmm maybe once i've go through what you've suggest in term of like word order and conciseness potentially like this section on the um responsibility activities
S0018	mm mm
S0125	because that be that's a hundred and fifty almost so that's good
S0018	i reckon maybe cut out two hundred word just by go through and er reword things
S0125	hm ss okay so that take me to like three fifty and then i've get to find six fifty somewhere else

S0018	well they've say like even internet connections might be
S0125	internet
S0018	interrupt yeah because they've only get like
S0125	bandwidth
S0018	yeah it's finite
S0125	as long as i can watch eastenders on iplayer i don't care

S0018	mm oh it's gonna get crazy
S0125	you think
S0018	oh god it's already start have you not notice like all the advert have start
S0125	oh yeah but
S0018	everything's about britain and union jack everywhere its
S0125	do you want to split this
S0018	no thank i can't manage anymore
S0125	neither can i really
S0018	save it for you er late night
S0125	midnight snack

S0018	no
S0125	i'm gonna save it
S0018	how much be it in total
S0125	don't worry about it
S0018	be you sure
S0125	yeah
S0018	that's very kind of you i wasn't expect it
S0125	you weren't expect it it's a nice surprise
S0018	okay so the part i oh gosh be this alright on put on the table have you get a spare coaster
S0125	just
S0018	yeah
S0125	thank
S0018	sorry
S0125	that's alright
S0018	oh i've put my cup of tea down on the advert for ben and jerry's ice cream
S0018	once you start eat junk food it's very difficult to stop okay so i think i think the introduction be all pertinent maybe you could cut cut it down a little bite just by simplify your sentence
S0125	yeah
S0018	um then in part one errm i can't remember whether there be um yeah there be maybe part about i don't know that this two sentence paragraph here i think maybe be
S0018	no i think maybe this information be already kind of include cos it's say
S0125	yes i know
S0018	it's work across different expertise areas but be that part of the small interdisciplinary team be that mean the same thing
S0125	possibly
S0018	do it need to be
S0125	i'll check
S0018	uh huh erm then
S0125	relevance er you suggest move that
S0018	yeah to the previous page cos that's where it be give an example of oh oh it depend whether you want to mix the light review with the primary find
S0125	okay
S0018	but i just think it seem a bite weird there because you didn't really talk about the structure here whereas you do here
S0125	okay
S0018	do you see what i mean
S0125	yep
S0018	um oh and when i put develop this i just when you put here that the email newsletter be an illustration of this maybe it need another part of the sentence to qualify why so just develop that
S0125	there's data in here that's miss that you haven't see that explain it
S0018	oh okay
S0125	so i think that wil be okay i'll check
S0018	okay cool and then be there yeah cos that that that part refer to back to stuff that you've put in the light review before
S0125	but it's about
S0018	and the brand that you've discuss before
S0125	okay i can get rid of where's the pen
S0018	it depend if it's difficult for me to know what's superfluous cos i don't actually understand it
S0125	i think that might be there this be the actual data information about the company so that's fine that explain what they're do how they're do it in term of visual communications erm okay err what be that
S0018	oh yeah
S0125	you suggest put that down
S0018	just put those two sentence down with that one because
S0125	oh okay fine
S0018	it it wasn't logical to the reader how to
S0125	read better yep alright
S0018	where it follow on from oh yeah the reference um i tend to either put a reference at the end of the sentence in bracket as oppose to
S0125	yeah it should be there then shouldn't it
S0018	cos it
S0018	can be quite clunky and it add extra word to your word count as well
S0125	yeah yeah
S0018	so or you could say um it be argue that at the begin of the sentence and then in in er bracket at the end put who it be who state it and the year um also you don't need a full stop this be be really pernickety but you don't need a full stop at the end of the sentence before you open the bracket to put the reference
S0125	sure
S0018	so i've um scribble that out on quite a few occasion oh yeah i didn't that be more research that part be
S0125	that's to do with my methodology
S0018	yeah
S0125	it's a challenge um i'll look at whether i can
S0018	maybe cos you've do quite a lot of criticise your design method and suggest
S0125	yeah
S0018	find maybe that would be a bite you could target to take out oh these be just a few of the sentence that i think that by front
S0125	yeah
S0018	the most important bite of the sentence it would be clearer and it would also um take your word count down um yeah and i've just um make some of your sentence shorter
S0125	yep fine
S0018	by split them up although that's not go to help you with the word count but okay there's nothing else in there think you could take out
S0125	okay fine
S0018	or there
S0125	i might need to um tidy this bite up um okay fine
S0018	oh and check that thing that if you um if it's not actually quote as a direct reference as a direct quote with speech mark you don't need to put the
S0125	okay
S0018	the page number however if it be if it's in if you've paraphrase it i don't think you need the page that it's come from
S0125	okay
S0018	um um um um um um yeah and that be just the thing about if it's not a publish source you don't need to reference it
S0125	okay
S0018	and just the translate from finnish as well just stuff like that it's just add extra word
S0125	yeah
S0018	don't know if it's necessary er i think i'm
S0125	this bite i need to move cos that's kind of like a primary piece of evidence
S0018	ah so you put it after the
S0125	yeah and also i'm already i'm go to say about the approach i can get rid of that sentence
S0018	uh huh
S0125	right fine
S0018	okey dokey erm oh yeah that be a that be a paragraph we talk about though wasn't it
S0125	yep
S0018	um yeah how come you've get a title here at the top of this
S0125	i dunno i dunno it's fine don't worry
S0125	it's fine get rid of that
S0018	and then
S0125	i be thinkng this bite might be a bite big and maybe i can just reduce it
S0018	uh huh
S0125	either by put more of this into the
S0018	un huh
S0125	or um yeah okay fine
S0018	or just cut it out if it's not
S0125	yeah it demonstrate how that previous point have be apply but i'll just okay
S0018	be it part of the ongoing text or be it a caption
S0125	that's a caption quite a big caption though
S0018	that bit's ongoing text
S0125	yep
S0018	okay yeah with the research methodology there be how long be that suppose to be cos i think it fall more or less
S0125	four hundred
S0018	more or less fall into the word limit
S0125	yep
S0018	so i don't think there's a problem with that cut that bite down oh the conclusion i just think it be maybe a little structure in a bite of a willy nilly
S0125	yep
S0018	manner cos it um i think you need to summarise the key point so what be your question the question be how do design and cultural value influence communications so actually say it the first sentence through the study i have ascertain that um communications be influence to a certain extent by design and cultural value such as blah blah blah just summarise it
S0125	yep
S0018	and just make it really explicit cos then you've you've go basically you're say a lot about how what you do in he future
S0125	mm
S0018	whereas i think it the booklet it say summarise your main your key point first
S0125	yeah okay
S0018	um
S0125	shorter sentence
S0018	i didn't really understand that
S0125	that's because that's a piece i've i've just add and hadn't really look at
S0018	oh okay
S0125	that's it okay
S0018	oh and that be that last paragraph that we think maybe
S0125	yeah that's fine
S0018	wasn't necessary
S0125	okay cool
S0018	but kudos to you it's an amaze piece of work woman
S0125	really i don't know yet
S0125	yes
S0018	what you gonna do on it you gonna read it through again and edit it
S0125	i'm just go to start edit it now
S0018	cool
S0125	yeah
S0018	right i'll go downstairs for a bite
S0125	alright
S0018	i'll come back up if there's anything like if you want to give me any of the page and say can you keep all the mean but cut fifty word out of that paragraph i could probably i could probably juggle the sentence the word and sentence
S0125	well let me get let me get through it base on what you've do here and then i'll see what i'm down to and then see how we go from there
S0018	okay coolio coolio
S0125	okay
S0018	nice one
