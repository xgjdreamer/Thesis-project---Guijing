S0421	it be actually we almost didn't get a table
S0423	really
S0421	yeah because
S0423	why do you not book it
S0421	well no because eh we think it wouldn't be that busy we be go to go a little bite
S0423	yeah seven's quite busy
S0421	yeah we think it wouldn't be that busy erm and on the website it didn't really you know say like oh book you know cos some of them do they say like oh we're quite busy and whatever so you should book
S0423	mm
S0421	and it didn't say anything like that we go and they be like oh no we've get no room and we be like leave and the guy come after us and be like no no we've find you a table so
S0423	oh right
S0421	yeah
S0423	that would have be a bite of a shame what would you have do
S0421	i don't know
S0423	look for somewhere else
S0421	yeah probably but they probably think there's like four of them
S0423	yeah
S0421	we should try and get them in somewhere yeah it be really busy cos we be think like oh be grandma go to like it cos grandma and grandad don't really go out to eat anywhere
S0423	yeah
S0421	and we didn't know if they would like well we think grandad would like the indian but we weren't sure about grandma but she be like oh it's really nice
S0423	really
S0421	yeah
S0423	well i've i i've bring lot of vegetables for you
S0421	have you
S0423	to practise be a vegetarian i be think about well depend see what time they get there cos it's probably not much time to pop out and top up supply but do something like a vegetable curry for you but i don't know if you're go to be in the mood for that
S0421	mm i'm not really i don't know like i'm quite fussy about curry i don't really like
S0423	no i wasn't go to do it spicy
S0421	mm
S0423	chilli spicy you can add chilli to it if you want to but things like butternut squash aubergines pepper it's really nice one of those
S0421	ah yes do you know i love butternut squash
S0423	you know the actual vegetables that i'm i be go to use
S0421	yeah
S0423	i've do it a couple of time and i've get a in it as well
S0421	ah butternut squash butternut squash be like the best
S0423	so it's quite different
S0421	it's so nice but we never buy it cos i can't peel it and it's
S0423	well no you either put the thing in and what you have to help
S0423	cos the whole point of it be so you can
S0421	well i've actually find out a good way of peel butternut squash we just don't but it usually cos it's a bite expensive
S0423	well what i do be i i cut it into little smaller manageable chunk and peel it
S0421	but it's not like a well i've find a good way because usually
S0423	what's that
S0421	the skin's really hard and i just can't get my knife into it and i end up like cut my hand open
S0423	you need a small knife though to do it
S0421	but i can do it with a peeler now because what you do be i i find this on some cook website cos i be like i need some help i really like butternut squash but i can't cook it so i look it up online and it's like right what you have to do be you poke load of hole in it stick it in the microwave and it soften the skin and you can just peel it off cos it's like it's not it's not like cook
S0423	it just soften
S0421	yeah it's like it get quite soft so you can peel it
S0423	oh right how many how long do you have to put it in the microwave for
S0421	a few minutes
S0423	what the whole butternut squash
S0421	yeah you just sort of spin it round but erm cos i put mine in for quite long and it kind of start cook a bite but it's alright if you're just go to like cook it anyway it's like quite soft and squishy anyway isn't it
S0423	yeah but you don't want to the cook process in the microwave the best way be if you're cook something be to you know like butternut squash it
S0421	why
S0423	cos you get more of the flavour then don't you and the actual whole dish if you're put it in with other things
S0421	yeah
S0423	and it's like it's nice like in a curry slow cook on a low heat and you get it just go soft and there's more flavour if you do it that way
S0421	yeah but you're just go to put it in anyway
S0423	yeah but it's how you cook things and combine them that make the flavour if you microwave it you don't get that same
S0421	yeah but you don't microwave all of it
S0423	well i know yeah but you'll you'll microwave quite an important element possibly
S0421	what the bite under the skin
S0423	well that's the flesh yeah it's alright if the skin soften a bite but once it start cook it's the flesh it's you're change the cook process
S0423	it's an exact science to cook things properly
S0421	i know but it just
S0423	it's like mix chemicals in the wrong order but erm i use like a you know a par knife quite a sharp small one
S0421	i think people i can't peel with a knife i have to peel with an a peeler because i just end up cut my finger
S0423	but you can't peel everything with a peeler can you
S0421	well i've manage alright
S0423	yeah
S0421	yeah
S0423	i didn't bring the peeler
S0421	i'm just i either i either cut my finger or i like take off half of the vegetable
S0423	ah
S0421	cos i'm try not to cut my finger
S0423	well what kind of be it quite a sharp knife you use
S0421	yeah
S0423	you just have you're your hand you're hold with away from so you hold it there and peel that way
S0423	so how be you go to cut it if it's not in the vicinity of
S0421	it slip or like it jam into me and the i'm like nearly stab myself and
S0423	yeah but if it if it slip it's go to go that way
S0421	yeah up your arm
S0423	well you you have to learn some knife skills
S0421	or i could just use a safe peeler now don't they usually say cook be an art but bake be a science
S0421	because bake be like the weigh and the measure and that
S0423	yeah you have to
S0421	yeah and the the the cooking's a bite like
S0423	yeah you can have a bite more throw things together depend on what you want but like the serious chefs you know you're cook like these michelin star
S0421	well it look art doesn't it when they put it when they put it on the plate it look like a paint
S0423	well yeah exact on how they do things
S0421	look good
S0423	we can get away with whatever can't we
S0421	no but i think those michelin chefs would agree that cook be an art form
S0423	yeah maybe
S0421	they they they're all you know what i mean you see you see these like
S0423	there be a science to it you have to understand how ingredients go together
S0421	yeah well that well you could arguably you could say the same for paint because paint involve chemicals and things but you'd never call paint a science
S0423	erm no cos i mean they're not make the paint be they
S0421	no but like the like the when you like mix media
S0423	mm
S0421	mix form like you can't erm really like you can't paint over acrylics in watercolour can you
S0423	no i mean well i suppose when you get to the down to all the nitty gritty there's there's science in everything really isn't there really
S0421	well yeah
S0423	nothing work without science
S0421	yeah ah we stop already
S0423	yeah i've get to get fuel we won't get very far with the amount of fuel that i have
S0421	oh can i get some nectar point
S0423	yeah
S0421	oh do you not do nectar
S0423	no
S0421	think i've get a nectar card i don't know if i've bring it i'll check
S0423	i'll start fill it up you can just pass it out to me when i'm
S0421	okay yeah
S0423	or else can i do it at the pump here no
S0421	can't you
S0423	no
