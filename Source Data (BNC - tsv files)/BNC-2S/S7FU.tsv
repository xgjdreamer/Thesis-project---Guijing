S0144	mm
S0024	erm but i just kind of say hello in pass at the at the drink table
S0144	right
S0024	and that be it so yeah
S0144	ah
S0024	it pretty much be the the first time we've speak
S0144	oh jesus i didn't realize
S0024	yeah so you know why why would we invite round why would i invite round people who i don't know
S0144	no i think it be up to me cos every time i've see her she say oh when can i see the baby when can i see the baby
S0024	yeah when cos you're say hello to these girls well er i didn't know them
S0144	oh god sorry
S0024	didn't know them
S0144	sorry the girl in the white be the owner of the bar
S0024	yeah i realise cos she show me around later
S0144	yeah
S0024	after
S0144	and the other one be
S0024	she show me that place upstairs
S0144	yeah the other one be
S0024	yeah i didn't yeah cos i er i didn't i think it change ownership that place
S0144	mm
S0024	erm i think the person who be own it before summer a different person own it now but
S0144	no but i be i be ask her what do you wanna do with the space upstairs
S0024	when oh what today yeah
S0144	she show me upstairs as well and you know it's alright up there but it's not
S0024	oh i think it's alright i think it's a nice space
S0144	she say she be gonna cut if off build a wall
S0024	yeah because
S0144	and she her idea be to have like an open music thing where people can just go in and play music
S0024	mm
S0144	and she'd put some instrument up there
S0024	okay that's dangerous though
S0144	yeah which just sound she be talk about guitars and stuff i be like well no guitars need to be people need to bring their own guitars you can't just pick up a guitar cos it will just get fuck
S0024	yeah no point in her buy
S0144	you can't have a communal guitar it'll just get ruin
S0024	you'd have people
S0144	if people be serious about learn guitar they can bring their own guitar and play it yeah
S0024	yeah
S0144	and it's the same with any instrument really i say well yeah
S0024	well mind you what would you do without the
S0144	i say maybe you can get maybe you can get a piano in there if she want to pay for a piano but
S0024	well what would you do without the caj贸n at
S0144	well i'd use my caj贸n
S0024	but you didn't have one at the begin you never play a caj贸n before
S0144	no
S0024	well you wouldn't know how like
S0144	yeah
S0024	so
S0144	no no it's a brilliant idea but i don't know how it would work especially in the chinese market in that area
S0024	they yeah they do have a lot of chinese customers don't they
S0144	but do they wanna go and play music i don't think so
S0024	no i think she's better off say come and listen to a band
S0144	well that's what i be try to say i be say look we can play we're open to play place but i don't think she want to pay money for it
S0024	ah i see yeah
S0144	she want to attract people by have music but not pay for a band
S0024	yeah open mic nights
S0144	but i say open mic night and she say no not really just any time morning afternoon even anyone can go in and just jam and just play and pick up an instrument and play
S0024	well that's nice cos it's a practice place
S0144	which be a lovely idea yeah that's what it be as a practice place but she didn't really seem like she know
S0024	no and i be think
S0144	exactly what she want to do
S0024	she say she say she doesn't want the sound to go to disrupt downstairs
S0144	mm
S0024	because she's get singers come in downstairs
S0144	yeah that's where they're play the music
S0024	i be think play the caj贸n on the floor upstairs not disturb downstairs i don't know but er you'd still hear it wouldn't you
S0144	yeah no cos they pay these filipino guy to come in and play during the even
S0024	yeah
S0144	downstairs
S0024	i think i've put too much garlic in this look look at all that garlic

S0144	mm
S0024	i i only half hear what people be talk to me about

S0144	yeah
S0024	that turkey's mine
S0144	do you think do you think that's true
S0024	i don't think i be starve as a kid
S0144	not starve but neglect
S0024	i wasn't neglect i wasn't neglect at all
S0024	we er we didn't have much money so we didn't have as much food as some people

S0144	oh this person's gonna have to listen to us eat pasta that's gonna be nice
S0024	mm that's not very pretty be it where be we sit here at the table
S0144	yeah
S0024	there's too many bananas on this table there
S0144	be you just gonna shall i throw that away
S0024	yeah i'm not gonna eat it i can't believe the lady in the shop give her a lollipop i be like erm
S0144	who give a six month old baby a lollipop
S0024	she's six months old and then i can't remember the word for toy but then she say oh she can have it as a toy
S0144	mm
S0024	and there's hold this lollipop
S0024	and she didn't know what to do with it
S0024	but she appreciate it
S0024	and then i secretly steal it off her basically when we leave the shop
S0024	and she didn't even try to put it in her mouth
S0144	mm
S0024	which be good
S0144	mm
S0024	she's get use to this kind of if you look er i think it's because this be the same shape as the erm drumsticks
S0144	oh yeah okay do she try and hit the table with it
S0024	well she be just hold it wave her cos i be hold her
S0144	mm
S0024	so she wasn't near a table
S0144	maybe doesn't
S0024	well she put everything else in her mouth
S0144	yeah
S0024	and she's not allow to put the drumsticks in her mouth
S0144	yeah
S0024	and this with the little bobble on it
S0144	mm
S0024	it look like well be they call drumsticks or xylophone stick or what be they call
S0144	erm yeah i dunno
S0024	with the big round circle
S0144	mm
S0024	so she just hold it like this

S0144	well she put the
S0024	haven't get any other
S0144	drumsticks in her mouth as well
S0024	well no but she get tell off about that
S0144	mm mm

S0144	yes not tell off we don't abuse our daughter we just have to tell everyone this
S0024	why do you have to do you want another beer
S0144	i'm just no er what i mean be it's funny cos when you're record you you kind of adapt you run everything you're gonna say through a filter you wouldn't have say that in normal conversation
S0024	say what
S0144	what do you say
S0024	we tell her off
S0144	erm i can't remember what you say
S0024	tell her off if she try to eat the the drumsticks

S0024	no i'm forget that that's on aren't i
S0144	no you weren't you wouldn't have say that
S0024	no
S0144	if if that wasn't there
S0024	well that's that's a shame i'd like to just completely forget it's all unconscious
S0144	but do that er do that actually have an impact on the er on the corpus
S0024	well
S0144	it doesn't really cos we're just speak english right i mean that's the
S0024	it doesn't for the small collocations
S0144	no no and that's what it's all about really
S0024	that's what it's for
S0144	it's not really look at erm speaker turn really and and things like that as far as i can tell
S0024	and additonal comment to
S0144	no
S0024	clarify the mean
S0144	no
S0024	it's not about that
S0144	no no no no just collocations which be what
S0024	they you could never analyse speech for mean when people know that they're be record
S0144	no you you need to video them as well
S0024	mm
S0144	you need to video them as well you can't do such a massive study
S0024	but you can't anyway because like you say you do er adapt things
S0144	mm
S0024	you can't help it
S0144	mm
S0024	you can try and forget all you like but i think i think you speak naturally most of the time
S0144	yeah
S0024	you speak naturally but yeah maybe there's it's just a little part of your brain that
S0144	it's like a little switch in your brain i suppose i suppose you've get switch for everything though every situation you're in
S0024	yeah i use to have a swear switch
S0144	you've get a switch yeah you've get a switch for when you're with your parent
S0024	yeah
S0144	that you er you monitor the language that you use
S0024	or er not just the yeah
S0144	you've get a
S0024	oh yeah all language
S0144	you've get a switch at work
S0024	and and the topic content
S0144	mm yeah you know you've get a switch for your mat
S0024	what's happen to your switch lately
S0144	my switch be break
S0024	yeah it's
S0024	it seem a bite break lately
S0024	when you walk across the street and get angry at that driver
S0144	well yeah i i it's not normally i
S0024	no it's not normal for you
S0144	i shout you fuck cunt
S0024	no no it's not normal
S0144	no no but we be push a pram across a road when it be a green light for us
S0024	mm
S0144	and that person
S0144	drive up go in front of us
S0024	and
S0144	and beep his horn
S0024	and she be asleep yeah mm
S0144	when she be asleep as well sorry but i think that be quite er
S0024	yeah but if she's any older then you need a switch and you have to say
S0144	well
S0024	oh what a naughty man don't you
S0144	i dunno
S0024	or do she have to or should she learn swearing's part of language
S0144	i think what i do be actually quite mild from what i could've do that be out of order
S0024	i don't think cunt be a mild word
S0144	no
S0024	like it's the worst word you can say
S0144	but i could've go over there and thump his bonnet
S0024	thump his bonnet
S0024	smash his headlights in
S0024	pick up a baseball bat
S0144	yeah what kind of person do that really
S0024	mm
S0144	what what kinda head space would you do it
S0024	yeah but that happen a lot here so
S0144	yeah but
S0024	so you need to adapt to have a different threshold
S0144	i know it happen a lot but i don't care what culture you're from when the light be green for a pedestrian and there's other people walk across you don't drive right up to a pram
S0024	he he be on his phone you know that
S0144	be he
S0024	yeah
S0144	oh i didn't know that
S0024	he be on his phone so he must've actually be on his phone with one hand and beep the horn with the other
S0144	well
S0024	he must've take his hand off the wheel
S0144	i
S0024	to beep the horn otherwise how can you do that you can't can you no he be definitely
S0144	well that make it even worse
S0024	yes it do yes it do because he take his hand off the wheel so his
S0144	so who be you
S0024	car could've go anywhere
S0144	who be you try to defend here
S0024	nobody i'm not try to no no no i think you do the right thing but i'm say
S0144	well no because he wouldn't have
S0024	in a year's time
S0144	understand what that mean i need to learn how to say it in chinese
S0024	i be say in a year's time will understand what it be
S0144	mm
S0024	but because swear be part of language i don't think actually you should shield kid from that completely
S0144	i think
S0024	but i think
S0144	use in the correct situation
S0024	yeah and that
S0144	i don't see what the problem be in that that be extreme
S0024	mm
S0144	you don't put my kid at risk
S0024	mm
S0144	drive on the bloody phone when it's a green light for the pedestrian
S0024	yeah
S0144	drive right up to us beep their horn when she's er sleep what the hell
S0024	yeah it be quite obvious that she be asleep
S0144	yeah
S0024	why's that curtain move be the window open
S0144	and it wasn't just us it be as well so there be two prams
S0024	yeah door be open

S0144	speaker one have leave the room be you come back come on i can't talk to myself
S0024	all the bathroom no no no all the bathroom windows be open
S0144	mm
S0024	mosquitoes be all come in and all the bug and
S0144	yeah
S0024	everything with the light on sorry i just have to close them all like like mosquitoes all in the bedroom
S0144	mm
S0024	at night
S0144	mm
S0024	i bet there's hundreds i bet we've get hundreds can't see any in here
S0144	although well you know at the risk of sound racist the chinese don't have much manners
S0024	not all
S0144	civilise
S0024	you can't say
S0144	no well no i'm talk and this be what stereotype be it's generalisations
S0024	yeah but
S0144	but there's
S0024	some be very nice polite
S0144	yeah of course they be i've get some very good friends who be chinese
S0024	mm
S0144	no but it's true
S0144	the civilise part of the society be we can say these things we've travel a lot
S0024	mm
S0144	there's just something lack which be weird because you'd think for a suppose like socialist country where they're supposedly look out for each other and work together in harmony
S0024	mm
S0144	they'd have this kind of cohesiveness but they don't they're all a bunch of individuals just you know show disregard for everyone else
S0024	mm
S0144	as far as what i can see generally
S0024	well i see it as half and half anyway because look how they rally round with our key today
S0144	yeah yeah yeah well yeah yeah
S0024	and that security guard
S0144	mm
S0024	erm tut come in and open the door for us and he wasn't even come in
S0144	mm
S0024	with his keycard and he be try his hardest
S0144	mm
S0024	and we think he be try to get it in
S0144	mm
S0024	but actually no he'd
S0144	mm
S0024	well he walk off again
S0144	mm
