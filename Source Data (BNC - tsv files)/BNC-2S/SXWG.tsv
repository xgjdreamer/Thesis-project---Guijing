S0579	i i remember eid be a really big day for them there yes
S0454	well exactly it be a really big deal so yeah i wasn't very happy with that
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	yeah so we didn't get on off to a good start i think there that's why
S0579	oh well
S0454	yes and she wasn't popular with the staff because
S0579	oh well oh no
S0454	you know she just wouldn't adjust and she'd say things like well in singapore this work and you think yes but we're not in singapore so that's an irrelevant statement isn't it
S0579	oh not in singapore no no that be correct yeah
S0454	that's just pointless
S0579	i'm i'm in i'm in or something
S0454	yes
S0579	where's that oh yes
S0454	no so they be hopeless
S0579	yeah
S0454	yeah so i felt actually they be worse than the americans cos i suppose at least in america i don't know what the difference be but maybe they've get more immigration there so they're a bite more aware
S0579	no right
S0454	at least in the cities they must have
S0579	well i know from during those war years in early forties with the americans they be really generous to us
S0454	yes
S0579	cos their air cruisers be get pay about three time as much as we do
S0454	yeah oh right
S0579	over there and er well they always insist buy the first drink so they er
S0454	ah that's nice
S0579	they er they be always like that
S0454	yes
S0579	cos they use to be pretty ashamed of themselves they say they have all of this money where we live on a pittance compare to them
S0454	yeah
S0579	yeah we be pay a lot more than anyone else of course
S0454	yeah oh yes that's true
S0579	er yeah
S0454	but i suppose they be volunteer be they the americans at least at the begin of the war they'd choose to do it
S0579	yes
S0454	it wasn't conscription
S0579	no no well of course air crew like ourself all of that's voluntary
S0454	ah right
S0579	there be no you you you be you could have someone in the airport who be a mechanic
S0454	yes
S0579	and he would be there but all air crew have to be volunteer
S0454	yeah so i suppose that's sensible
S0579	oh no that's right and er yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	i remember yeah what's
S0454	that must've make a big difference to morale cos i mean if you've get people who have to be there
S0579	yeah
S0454	then there's always a risk that they're not go to pull their weight when push come to shove isn't it
S0579	mm yeah
S0454	but if they've choose to be there well hopefully
S0579	they're they're okay yeah
S0454	you're you're gonna stick together and help each other out
S0579	er yeah i think that's normally what happen
S0454	yes
S0579	oh i er er train in south africa that's right and then and i move off to egypt that's right
S0454	mm oh right
S0579	do a bite of train there
S0454	do you you sign up at the begin of the war
S0579	no i be too young at that stage actually
S0454	ah right yes you wait
S0579	yes yeah i do four years with the royal air force mind you
S0454	oh yes that's quite a long time
S0579	yeah i live years there
S0454	yes cos you be quite young then you be probably only about eighteen nineteen
S0579	cos i i be eighteen when i join
S0454	oh right yes
S0579	i volunteer when i be seventeen and a half
S0454	oh right
S0579	i remember we have to go up to read for big er test they be probably be he gonna be alright when he's fly in the sky sort of thing
S0454	oh right
S0579	and they say i be okay for that lot
S0454	yeah
S0579	i be only seventeen and a half then
S0454	yes
S0579	so i have to wait till i be eighteen yes
S0454	and why do you choose the air force not the
S0579	well i suppose it sound nice
S0454	yeah i suppose it's excite and you probably get to see a lot of the world didn't you compare to say an army where
S0579	yes yes well i suppose you see er that's right yeah
S0454	it's go to be a lot slower move about
S0579	yeah that's right that's right what what do we see a lot down there oh we of course i do see quite a lot er

S0579	then they then they use to have a some indian fighters from india like fight alongside them and you know
S0454	they're well they're renowned aren't they the indian fighters
S0579	oh they be they be they be very good fighters that's what my father use to say
S0454	although they get treat badly after the war didn't they
S0579	oh yes yeah they do yeah
S0454	they should've get all sort of things pension and
S0579	oh yeah
S0454	settle here and they didn't jamaicans get treat very badly as well it be
S0579	yeah oh yes yeah
S0454	after the second world war
S0579	yeah they be they they expect to move here but they didn't or at least some of them do but
S0454	they be treat badly when they get here
S0579	yeah very bad yeah
S0454	yes that be a shame although it wasn't the government's fault i don't think it be just sort of the people's mindsets wasn't it
S0579	well that's right and now there's if you be english you be top of the world like
S0454	yes but i remember see
S0579	it be yeah
S0454	but i remember see sign in about erm you know sort of b and b type place in the from the nineteen fifties and they'd say no black
S0579	do they say that
S0454	yeah nineteen fifties that would've be you know just after the war when you know the jamaicans be try to settle
S0579	yeah
S0454	and it's pretty amaze isn't it that that go on i mean you couldn't do it today obviously but
S0579	oh that's terrible thing that oh no yeah
S0454	yeah well it's not that long ago
S0579	no no no no
S0454	and you think of that as be a sort of south african problem with apartheid it be amaze that it go on here
S0579	yeah
S0454	in the nineteen fifties
S0579	i remember in south africa it be bad of course i remember when i be there
S0454	mm yes i expect so
S0579	if if you weren't a say a lady drop a basket of fruit and then you help pick them up you be stop by the police
S0454	oh that's terrible isn't it
S0579	yeah i i i be stop once
S0454	yeah yeah it's not right be it
S0579	and then we we then we i know we i know the er chap who be in charge of us he he'd tell us that er that you may see things you you don't like but you're in someone else's country you have to obey the rule he be say
S0454	yes well that's true to some extent i suppose
S0579	yeah i suppose yeah
S0454	you can't
S0579	otherwise you end up in jail
S0454	yes that's right no that's very difficult i always think that's difficult when you travel abroad but he's probably right that you be there for a reason and it
S0579	yeah
S0454	wasn't to interfere with their political situation at all so
S0579	not not no no yeah
S0454	it's best to not medal yes in the gulf saw people treat their house staff really badly i don't mean like you know hit them or anything although i suspect that go on but they would treat them very disrespectfully but you can't say anything you're a guest in someone's home it's not appropriate for you to tell them how to deal with their staff
S0579	no i can remember when i be in africa some years ago of course you would see the ladies use to be carry the stuff on their head still you know
S0454	well yes i expect they still do yes yes
S0579	the ladies i mean yes carry their parcel on their head
S0454	yes
S0579	oh we have a visit from someone actually who be it now come to the house years later from south africa can't remember if your mum might've know but i don't know cos she use to walk around here with her hat funny you know these funny hat they wear
S0454	oh right mm
S0579	yeah yeah she must've be the odd one out
S0454	yeah
S0579	oh no no she she be carry stuff on her head like
S0454	oh right
S0579	she be the food and that on the top
S0454	oh yeah that's different
S0579	yeah yeah but er walk around er london like that must've it be quite a a
S0454	yes no in portugal they do that the
S0579	do they
S0454	the women the farmers' wive out in the country they still carry stuff on their head and i wonder whether they'd pick that up cos the portuguese be great sailors
S0579	oh they be yes
S0454	but you know back in the sixteen hundreds seventeen hundreds they be in the middle east first weren't they they be they be you know really do a lot of trade
S0579	the sixteen yes yes yes that's right yes oh yes
S0454	erm as sailors so i wonder if they'd bring that back with them cos it's the only country in europe i've ever see that i've never see it anywhere else
S0579	yes do you go to portugal then
S0454	yes yeah because i live erm in the south of spain well sorry the north of spain in vigo
S0579	oh do you
S0454	and that be just about twenty miles from the border so i use to
S0579	oh yes
S0454	go over in the even sometimes and drive somewhere like porto have an even out
S0579	porto yeah
S0454	porto's a lovely city
S0579	yeah i remember porto yeah
S0454	yeah it's very run down and old fashion
S0579	yeah
S0454	yes
S0454	i'd like to go again actually
S0579	they be a different sort of world over there weren't they yeah
S0454	yeah er porto really do feel like a different world
S0579	yeah that's right yeah yeah
S0454	yeah
S0579	portuguese
S0454	and i walk from porto erm along the camino the the pilgrimage way to santiago de compostela take about ten days
S0579	oh that pilgrimage we would oh yes we would oh yes we watch that from a distance
S0454	ah yes it's quite something
S0579	yeah that's right well i seem to remember sit on a wall to watch in the distance
S0454	yeah
S0579	and the and the sort of people on that trail never end like it just go on and on and on and on seem to be go on all day like
S0454	that's right yeah it's amaze
S0454	yes the portuguese route's quite quiet in comparison
S0579	yes yeah
S0454	it be a lovely thing to do and it's just so rural you know that part of portugal be just
S0579	mm yeah
S0454	little villages mm
S0579	i remember in spain i think we be we saw one of those bull fight i remember with grandma
S0454	oh right
S0579	so we didn't like that
S0454	no i don't think i'd like that
S0579	no oh no yeah yet they the family love it
S0454	yes well it be a big thing isn't it
S0579	oh yeah they er
S0454	they don't all love it in spain but in part of spain it's hugely popular
S0579	they be it still be it still go be it
S0454	oh yes yeah madrid they love it
S0579	oh really oh do it
S0454	yes it depend where you be in barcelona they ban it
S0579	i don't think we
S0454	but there's always be a political rivalry between madrid and barcelona so
S0579	between er
S0454	a lot of commentators wonder be it really about animals' right or be this just a a way of get at madrid by say well fine we're go to ban your favourite sport
S0579	yes
S0454	bite like the fox hunt i suppose in the uk that people who don't like the rich
S0579	oh yes yeah
S0454	and be perhaps envious of them deliberately object to fox hunt because
S0579	yes
S0454	let's face it only the the rich aristocrats can afford to go hunt cos who can afford to have a horse
S0579	who can afford it
S0454	and a pack of hound except the the well off so
S0579	i remember when we come here i don't suppose it do now but from the bedroom window upstairs you can watch the hound
S0454	oh right
S0579	over the moor like
S0454	yes well that's stop now hasn't it well not completely stop but erm
S0579	er yes have it no have it stop have it
S0454	well it's stop in certain ways the the dog aren't er aren't allow to tear the fox apart any more they're suppose to shoot the fox dead
S0579	no no no no
S0454	i suppose in reality it's a bite difficult to police that isn't it but anyway there's kind of rule about it
S0579	yeah in fact they use to meet in the village there
S0454	oh right
S0579	yeah the horse and
S0454	yeah well it's quite a sight isn't it
S0579	yeah
S0454	whatever you feel about fox hunt it's a lovely sight
S0579	all their stuff and their gown and what be these jacket and
S0454	yes those red jacket oh yes it's a really lovely sight
S0579	yeah and all those oh yeah they be very much
S0454	you know i don't agree with fox hunt at all but
S0579	no no
S0454	it be quite a spectacle
S0579	it be yeah no
S0454	yes and it be traditional but i suppose the thing i question be you know farmers will say oh we have to keep fox number down but the reality be no one farm poultry
S0579	no
S0454	free range any more out here
S0579	no it's all under
S0454	so if they've get poultry and they're in shed
S0579	yeah
S0454	and it's all lock down and you couldn't get in without a key and get through several you know it's all lock down isn't it so a fox hasn't get a chance of get in
S0579	well yes no i know cos i use to well we use to have a company up in the near somewhere where they have row and row of house er you know for
S0454	oh yes for chickens
S0579	chickens and stuff
S0454	i find it quite unpleasant actually
S0579	oh it's dreadful all all they're in there but it look very much wrong
S0454	yes yes i feel bad actually
S0579	yeah yeah yeah
S0454	i'm i keep mean to stop eat chicken cos i i actually think morally that's not right
S0579	yeah
S0454	whereas you know beef that's in a field isn't it so
S0579	yeah
S0454	i don't have a problem with kill an animal but i mean its life shouldn't be miserable
S0579	no no
S0454	it should have a a reasonable life and chickens obviously don't or pig
S0579	yeah
S0454	so today actually when i be order i do choose beef and that do cross my mind that
S0579	yeah
S0454	i be toss up between chicken and beef but
S0579	of course it's better than it use to be because i remember in my younger days with with with these in the town they be i think at the time er there use to be blood float under the er the gate there
S0454	oh right
S0579	where they'd just be slaughter them
S0454	oh dear that's unpleasant
S0579	so you could see the blood float underneath
S0454	yes
S0579	yeah
S0454	in the supermarkets you can buy free range meat quite easily now in all the big supermarkets
S0579	can you
S0454	yeah it's expensive though it's about five time the price
S0579	oh
S0454	but i mean that's really what i should do just buy beef and lamb because that's always free range isn't it if they're always in the field that's fine so just buy normal beef and lamb
S0579	yeah yes mm mm
S0454	and then if i want chicken i should probably just buy the free range one once in a blue moon
S0579	oh yes
S0454	the other things be they fill those factory chickens with chemicals and antibiotics cos otherwise they'd all get sick cos they they're too close
S0579	yes yeah
S0454	so you're ingest all those chemicals which be not
S0579	oh dear
S0454	not particularly what you want to be do with your health be it
S0579	no i know also of course in farm days you know go back seventy years ago when we be some farmers the men would be out in the field do whatever they have to plough up or whatever and the ladies would always be look after the chickens and they keep the money
S0454	oh right yes
S0579	they yeah
S0454	yes that's interest isn't it
S0579	and so they look after and they use to look after them well
S0454	mm
S0579	and fee them pay for the food but then they keep the money
S0454	yes that's quite interest so that's the reverse of what we think happen
S0579	mm yeah mm yeah yeah that's right
S0454	that it be actually the woman who hold on to the purse string for in farm families
S0579	that that's right yeah
S0454	it probably only change with industrialisation where the men be give the wag directly by the factory owner
S0579	oh probably yes yeah
S0454	and then that money go down the pub and
S0579	yes
S0454	you know half of it never get home do it
S0579	no no no that's right
S0454	but that's not actually what traditionally happen
S0579	i know we use to have we use to have some farmers bite like that and er what happen er well the farmers use to work very hard
S0454	they do work i think they still work very hard
S0579	and then he get very cross cos one of his daughters think that he they work the mother too hard like
S0454	oh right
S0579	and so i think one of the daughters take his wife off to canada for about three months so
S0454	oh right
S0579	he didn't like that at all
S0454	no i can imagine
S0579	but er yes
S0454	but they do work very hard on farm
S0579	oh yes they
S0454	there's an enormous suicide rate as well among farmers
S0579	yeah
S0454	even today
S0579	that's right
S0454	although i don't know if that's because the job's really hard or if it's just because they're alone too much
S0579	yes right
S0454	and you see that's probably sadly
S0579	yeah
S0454	a result of industrialisation in farm isn't it
S0579	yes
S0454	before
S0579	yeah
S0454	most job on the farm would be in a team you know if you need to plough a field it wouldn't be one man on his own
S0579	no
S0454	but it'd be a team of farmers who might club together and you do
S0579	yeah
S0454	joe's farm one day and then next week you go to bob's farm and you all help there
S0579	yes
S0454	because you need a few people to to get job do whereas now it's one man on his own isn't it
S0579	well i meet one of the farmers forget who he be now erm er it be when we live in i suppose sort of farmer somewhere he have acres and acres of field to look after
S0454	mm
S0579	er and he be a very hard work bloke
S0454	they be very hard work
S0579	yeah yeah yeah
S0454	yes
S0579	but i speak to him i well i remember him once he give me a lift into i suppose be in the back cos in the boot he have a he have a sheep
S0454	oh right
S0579	still alive
S0454	i hear quite an interest comment about farm in the uk the other day
S0579	yeah
S0454	which i think be probably true it be in a book and i forget who write it
S0579	yeah
S0454	something begin with t truss i think but he be say the uk have never be interest in maximise yield they've be interest in er in maximise economic output which of course be not the same thing be it
S0579	that's it no no no
S0454	so you could grow something like
S0579	yeah
S0454	you know a high value crop
S0579	yeah
S0454	which doesn't produce very much and you can make a lot of money off that but it wouldn't actually fee very many people
S0454	i think well that's probably true because this country be different to most countries in europe
S0579	yes well yes
S0454	because a very small minority of people own the vast majority of land like
S0579	yeah
S0454	you know the royal family for example
S0579	yeah yeah
S0454	own huge swathe of the south west don't they i think prince er charles duchy of cornwall
S0579	yeah all down cornwall they don't they
S0454	er and it's enormous amount
S0579	yeah
S0454	whereas in other countries that just doesn't happen
S0579	do they still hold it do they
S0454	oh yes yeah it's own i mean it's tenant out but it the truth be that person's call the shots aren't they they're say right i want sheep on here
