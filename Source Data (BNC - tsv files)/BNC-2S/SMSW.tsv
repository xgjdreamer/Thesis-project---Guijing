S0202	okay so
S0203	i'm be hold at gunpoint
S0202	don't say that
S0203	help me
S0202	there's load of there's load of paperwork and stuff that you have to fill in like
S0203	you've get me trap
S0202	in a bar yeah right
S0203	i guess be you alright to sort that currently drink a lot of white wine
S0202	well i've technically have half a bottle when i've have these two cos handle it
S0203	might wanna play that back
S0202	it's horrible listen back to my voice cos i have to listen to like the first five minutes so when i'm fill form in erm i have to erm listen to the first five minutes to ascertain what it be
S0203	single word after
S0202	but nine grand a year fuck hell
S0203	i don't do an english degree know what the world have to say
S0202	yeah
S0203	take it down
S0202	yeah so nine grand just to explain a word that i already know but erm
S0203	i know some pretty big word too i can teach you them if you want
S0202	what right okay think of some big word that you know then
S0203	er you've get to use them in context though you can't just blurt out a word cos if you think of a big word
S0202	be your be your be be
S0203	the biggest word i know be antidisestablishmentarianism
S0202	that be actually the longest word in the english language
S0203	yeah it be erm
S0202	erm do you know what if i say this okay so your vocabulary be exponential
S0203	er it grow as i go along
S0202	mm mm
S0203	exponential grow so there you go i'm not an idiot
S0203	you're talk about fuck basic word like
S0202	to be fair my friend she do the erm er international baccalaureate so she do it's like the hardest thing ever it's like a level but you do nine so she didn't she do nine subject at a level for two years and erm she didn't know what exponential mean i have to explain it to her so it's not even down to your intelligence it just mean what word you come across
S0203	yeah but like you say well read so you read more word than i that be relevant as well
S0202	yeah i mean i have a list
S0202	if i come across a word like i put it down and then like look up look at it later like i have this app and it on my phone and it basically give me five new word a day to learn
S0203	oh right
S0202	so like every day five new words'll come up and if they're already in my vocabulary if i already know what they mean i click on them and say i know what these mean and give me some more
S0203	do you do what i do and when you say a big word you smirk
S0202	yeah
S0202	make it sound like he do not know what that mean i'm a genius
S0203	win conversations when i'm like a big word
S0202	yeah
S0203	and like
S0202	and then they're confuse
S0203	really be a lot of them in music as well because obviously it's like an extra subject to do something you've never really do
S0202	yeah
S0203	i could sit here say all sort of word to you and you won't have a clue what i'm on about
S0202	yeah
S0203	and really basic ones as well so for basic for me would be say like a you know the song don't look back in anger by oasis yeah
S0202	yeah
S0203	that song be in a key of c that's fairly understandable yeah
S0202	mm
S0203	and it use a chord progression on the one four five six with a with a minor two and you wouldn't have a clue if that be right and it wasn't right
S0202	i have no idea
S0203	i can fill you full of bullshit all day and you wouldn't know it's
S0202	oh my god
S0203	but it be pretty cool to know music because now i'm at a point where i can listen to a song and by the end of the song i've already learn it all apart from the word cos obviously i need to remember the word
S0202	yeah
S0203	but if it's something like a song any any pop song i can pretty much know by the end of it because they're all common
S0202	yeah they all use the same music note alright
S0203	chord progressive
S0202	yeah chord progressive
S0202	so
S0203	ah i haven't button this up in years
S0202	so do you know erm how to play any instrument or be it just guitar or drum or what
S0203	it apply so
S0202	cos it all the same right
S0203	it sort of yes i don't know how to play a trumpet or trombone cos they're all you have to have skill but what i do know be that erm on a trumpet it's not like a guitar where you can stroke like a six finger guitar you combine all the note together to make a chord to play trumpet you can play one note you can't play a chord
S0202	yeah
S0203	the way you get a chord it's like get three trumpet to play all at the same time you don't want a third a third of the fifth of chord on a different note
S0202	okay right
S0203	yeah the chord or whatever er and that's that's how er that's how you play a chord but i didn't know that when i play off but no if i ever play trumpet i'd know straight away you can't do this this and this you can do this this and this er i can play guitar and because i can play guitar i can play bass violin cello all that sort of stuff to a certain standard
S0202	same sort of instrument
S0203	yeah cymbal
S0202	yeah okay
S0203	i can play drum erm purely because one of my mat show me how to and then you start play like you do with anything you start play sequence and stuff so you realise that it's not it look like you can play on your arm like a
S0202	yeah
S0203	all you really do be count in there go one two three four da da da da do and it all start to become a sequence it all
S0202	right
S0203	it get really bore after this but
S0202	so i wouldn't be able to i probably wouldn't be able to do it then cos of my with sequence
S0203	possibly possibly yes cos like erm the the easier you do it the four four rock beat which be you use everything yeah it do you count four on your high hat which be the symbol yeah which be one two three four on the one you press your kick pedal
S0202	right
S0203	on three you press your dum da da da one two three four
S0202	oh yeah if they don't have any coordination i couldn't play drum
S0203	yeah so well it's all about just learn it the once it's not hard it's just put the time in to learn it and there's a thing call the ten thousand hours theory where if you put ten thousand hours into learn anything
S0202	yeah
S0203	you're good at it but you just have to put that ten thousand hours in
S0202	right okay keep do it for ten thousand hours
S0203	yeah
S0202	yeah
S0203	or there's a theory like if you do something for twenty seven days no matter what it be like erm if you go to the gym every day for twenty seven days it's then in your memory in your muscle memory and everything you want to go back again so if you can stick with something for twenty seven days chance be you can stick with it forever
S0202	really
S0203	so if you want to do your five challenge make sure you do it for a month
S0202	yeah
S0203	and after that month you'll want to do it because it's come if you know what i mean
S0202	yeah
S0203	that's an interest theory i know load all about the theories
S0202	do you know anything about erm the string theory see i have to concentrate then when i'm be serious
S0203	yeah
S0202	i have to concentrate
S0203	yeah
S0202	i'll just say theory not theory
S0203	i be only joke about that i'm not
S0202	i know but i'm try to like con my dentist into think that i need a brace for free because
S0203	so you've do a list
S0203	now i've get
S0202	that's what i'm try to

S0202	no but i do have a speech impediment i can't i physically can't there's some word that i can't say because i can say them but
S0202	well yeah thick thick
S0203	in the english degree
S0202	like i i actually have to concentrate like say things like thick or three or erm
S0203	yeah but if you want to say them correctly if you want to get your point across i can mumble for an hour and you can kinda get what i'm say
S0202	yeah
S0203	so you don't have to like express every
S0202	i know but like i'm try to get a free brace here so do you know people can't understand me when i'm talk even people from yorkshire if i talk at my proper speed

S0203	so well i'm think things too quick and my mouth can't keep up with the think i think
S0202	same with me yeah
S0203	but you'll say things and occasionally you'll see me go er da da da da da da da da da and then i'll get into the speech cos i'm try and my brain's that like fast and i can't keep up with that i'm try to say something but
S0202	it come out yeah it's the same with me though because sometimes say i'll be sit here and will not have say anything for five minutes just watch telly or whatever and i'll sit i'll oh yeah so you know this and blah blah blah and people be just like what the fuck be you talk about i'm like yeah this and i've not realise that i've not say it cos it's be go through my brain

S0202	he look like a paedophile to be fair
S0203	yeah but he obviously you can tell he's immature can't ya
S0202	yeah
S0203	and er yeah
S0202	fuck hell
S0203	at school
S0202	oh my god that's really bad
S0203	that that that's not that's when she be eighteen if you go back far enough it'll probably be there'll probably be a picture of her or summat i'm probably be able to tell you who she's with
S0202	shit
S0203	i think she move school in sixth form or summat which you would
S0202	of course of course she would if if like you know if everyone know what have go be go on cos they would wouldn't they cos like everyone's
S0203	oh there you go that's that's er that's from our her and that's the old music teacher who make me take up er play guitar and she vouch for him she say there's no way he could be a paedophile all this and when it come out she be like oh right
S0202	egg on her face
S0203	yeah
S0202	yeah but you think you know someone don't you then something like that come out and it's like
S0203	no one know about it no one know about it and i can honestly say
S0202	until
S0203	i be there when we find out yeah because er it be who get who get her phone she be like i'm just gonna send a text off it we be sit there look at her picture go like oh look at these like you would you be like what the fuck be like sixteen fifteen we would have be fourteen or fifteen at the time on this army trip
S0202	see i know this sound really bad and you can't judge me for it but when i be fifteen right when you're fifteen years old or sixteen or fourteen or thirteen as soon as you become a teenager soon as you like start your period and start notice boys and start have all that shit with your parent where you're a teenager you don't give a fuck what they think they're wrong you hate your parent like you think that you be old enough to make decisions you you become a teenager you hit puberty and then all of a sudden you be adult enough to make your own decisions and your parent tell you you're like fuck off you're wrong
S0203	yeah yeah
S0202	i'm right you know better right when i be fifteen if i'd have sleep with a guy who be twenty one twenty two whatever whatever
S0203	yeah be it
S0202	it wouldn't phase you you wouldn't think oh he's a paedophile he's take advantage of me but since
S0203	yeah but
S0202	since
S0203	get with teachers though you power of trust
S0202	it be it be a power of trust i get that i understand that and what he do be wrong but if you look at say like you go to i don't know erm pakistan and i hate be stereotypical because it's pretty racist but if you go to place like pakistan or any muslim country or any indian country so anyone who follow the sikh religion to them it's normal to get to get marry at thirteen fourteen
S0203	yes
S0202	and the men be always older
S0203	it's a different culture it's a different culture but i i think the
S0202	but why be that not wrong
S0203	i think the age of consent should er be especially in england should be about eighteen or
S0202	yeah it should
S0203	you don't you don't cos i'm older now and i've do all that i realise that when i be eighteen i weren't think i weren't think clearly at all
S0202	yeah but no one ever
S0203	at eighteen i'd of shag i'd of shag
S0202	no one ever i know but
S0203	nowadays it's not the same be it
S0202	nothing sake nothing take like i i've sleep with people who be older than me like my ex boyfriend be twenty four and i be eighteen
S0203	yeah
S0202	i know but er and he's twenty eight i'm twenty two
S0203	yeah
S0202	like you could turn round and say well he's older than you so he should know better he shouldn't be sleep with you but
S0203	when you be when you be ten he be sixteen
S0202	exactly but what difference do it make age it's just a number and but then you think well actually if it be my child my daughter my son whatever you wouldn't want them you wouldn't want them to do that and it's and the whole thing with jimmy savileand erm load of other people like that's come out in this yewtree enquiry and all that fuck bullshit like what where do you draw the line because there's fifteen year olds and there's nine year olds there's a big difference between nine and fifteen
S0203	it's a very grey area because
S0202	it's so weird
S0203	because some of it be hard to er prosecute and testify against because you have like these rock star like mick jagger yeah shag fourteen fifteen year old girls who be throw themselves at him and like on please fuck me sort of thing
S0202	yeah like it be consent it be consentful
S0203	and mick jagger these fifteen year olds be like when he be like twenty you'd be like oh yeah i'll shag her sort of thing as you would cos you wouldn't necessarily ask them their age
S0202	no
S0203	but these the the where it differ with the jimmy savilething and he be go up to seventeen year old girls
