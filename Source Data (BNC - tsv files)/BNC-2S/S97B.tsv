S0261	erm yeah so i don't see erm relevance in ones like investigative journalism moral enterprise experiment statistics factory finance gain economics or a job interview erm because they fit erm it's like evaluations be try it's be fit into a particular set or something erm
S0262	a context
S0261	yeah a context i i would argue that something like evaluation as engineer that make sense to me have be an engineer because erm er because engineer be be a a logical process where you go through something and you need to evaluate along way in some kind of experiment or observation so erm
S0262	so would that would experiment not be part of your
S0261	well the the evaluation be an an experiment in its own right though you you you're actually you're look at something and you're erm come up with particular arguments for why something be like it be yeah so you would have carry out the experiment before you evaluate something
S0262	oh right in engineer
S0262	yeah let's just er let's simply say erm you've get erm a bike and you've get erm a hill and you've get the same person rid up erm two different hill yeah and somebody's try to work out whether i don't know they're more puff at the top of one hill versus the other they they they they go the same distance it's just one's steeper than the other right so that's the experiment and then after that you would evaluate that and you would ask a question like which hill do you find harder to ride your bike up or which hill make you feel more exhaust or which one be easier to ride your bike up
S0262	okay so you see that as two separate things
S0261	yeah yeah mm
S0262	wow okay
S0261	it's just er and a statement like evaluation be a factory well it's not a factory a a a factory carry out a certain purpose erm but well i suppose if you put it in a context of of how evaluation be carry out in the context of career erm a a career type erm exercise or something then you could say evaluation be a factory because the the the the answer that come out of it be kind of churn
S0262	yeah that's exactly ideas be churn churn the word churn out
S0261	yeah yeah it's churn yeah so it come down to how you interpret
S0262	they're churn out students with degrees that's what it all mean it's connect to this one
S0261	churn yeah yeah okay
S0262	production line
S0261	so yeah
S0262	it's very systematic
S0261	and and and things like economics and
S0262	yeah
S0261	and that kind of thing you could look at in the same way erm and i've get a lot of things in the middle erm but i think it's because they're more generic erm to the whole exercise and i think that's what i refer to as the choose that evaluation as a thread and everything
S0262	okay so talk about the ones on the leave then the three on the leave
S0261	okay so i've get evaluation as a court this be in the context of a previous er profession which be engineer so i've get evaluation as as a as a court trial er as geography and as engineer so em i associate all of thing together erm in the context of engineer so erm er to evaluate something well i might yeah in support of my previous argument i don't know that call it say it's a court trial help well the context of why i put it there be erm that engineer be sometimes call into court to be expert witness et cetera and in order to do that they they have carry out some kind of evaluative work to to state their position or their opinion or something like that
S0262	absolutely yeah i mean that's very that's a very clever association i think
S0261	that's that's the way i see it
S0262	what you've just say there
S0261	oh okay erm geography be be erm again relate to engineer but that's obvious er an obvious point
S0262	but why for you in your word
S0261	erm well because engineer by nature be be be erm construction of something within a geography relate to that kind of thing
S0262	but what do geography mean to you
S0261	oh well in relate er well the role i have be as a as a highways engineer so geography be intrinsic to that
S0262	why why you're not say why you're just tell erm that it be but you're not say why
S0261	well er er well it be intrinsic to it because when you build a highway you have to change the geography
S0262	so how do you evaluate geography
S0261	in order to build a construction
S0262	how to use geography to in your evaluation
S0261	well erm it geography be one of the the kind of the foundations of of what might shape where you put a road to start with you know that that before er a design for a road be ever undertake people look at the the natural geography and they er say will it go here or will it go there or what make sense and what's easy and what's hard and all of that kind of thing
S0262	and there's the human and the human geography as well
S0261	and they come up with and and human geography and all that kind of thing so do we have to destroy house to build a road
S0262	move people
S0261	move people go wreck communities change water erm regimes rivers all that kind of stuff so erm
S0262	okay and then
S0261	that's specifically relate to my particular role in engineer which be highways
S0262	yeah well i mean even if it wasn't it might be
S0261	well you could say the same as rail or
S0262	oil gas
S0261	yeah yeah a whole a whole bunch of those type of
S0262	so be that
S0261	civil engineer typically
S0262	civil engineer yeah
S0261	yeah
S0262	and what and then you have evaluation as engineer so what be engineer for evaluation
S0261	erm well that's in term of erm evaluation as part of a process and engineer be that process so you you be try to engineer something you be an evaluation sit within that box so that's why that ring true to me if i disassociate it i've disassociate it with the from the profession and i've look at it in term of its alternative mean which be to engineer something to make something up
S0262	okay but somebody say today i think it be be that he he saw evaluation as engineer as somebody have already decide and make a decision and he saw engineer as a process by which to justify the decision have already be make so the idea be that something have be engineer to suit a certain purpose
S0261	oh well that's look at it from a a different point of view
S0262	yeah
S0261	yeah
S0262	but he saw it as erm i think you know cos he work in the aviation industry be that justify how much money to spend on engineer plan or whatever the decision be already take and the engineer be work backwards
S0261	yeah so he's talk about a kind of reverse engineer scenario which happen sometimes that budget be limit and hence the solution that's provide have to be engineer within that scope
S0262	and be that not the case in engineer a lot of the time
S0261	yeah but i wouldn't look at it at that that point of view come across as a negative point of view to me
S0262	right
S0261	erm rather than
S0262	and engineer in a positive way for you be process
S0261	yes because er it be a process erm if you go back to the point about budget et cetera erm my interpretation of of what you've put across be that erm there may not have be enough money to do something that one want to do and sometimes it's like that so a clever way of look at engineer be say well i've get these constraints what's the best i can get of out of what those constraints be
S0262	okay
S0261	and that might involve research and discovery and erm experiment and try to erm evolve something that provide the best solution in that engineer sense
S0262	mm
S0261	its creation
S0262	okay great you've already just mention three metaphors
S0261	okay that's fine do you write down creation
S0262	okay so the next ones then you've come up with a thread but then you've get all these overlap
S0261	research reflection risk argument learn architecture technology management critique and a map and i think they all kind of fit together pretty much there might be a couple of outliers but if you put them together in a in a in a network you'd say they all they all link together
S0262	okay try put them together into pair
S0261	into pair
S0262	associative pair or or you know whichever way but try and see if there be er pair connections for you maybe not with that one but
S0261	no mm do they have to be pair
S0262	no okay just erm i i ask you to do it as pair but just associative like relationships
S0261	mm group mm
S0262	yeah alright so let me just take a photograph of that so what what do you run through your mind when you're think of those ones
S0261	well i well i you know i couldn't say that it's it's complete but erm it's just a thirty second view point of something erm so i think it kind of put together some of the reason behind why i pick some things
S0262	mm
S0261	erm so say if we look at evaluation as research architecture and a map erm you could argue hat
S0262	do they run like on a
S0261	yeah they run horizontally
S0262	right
S0261	so erm you could say that erm from my point of view architecture and map be pretty much the same thing
S0262	why
S0261	because i see architecture as a as a structure of something the that that be the network of how things be join together erm and a map be kind of er similar that it it it provide guidance it show the way erm so you can say if something's get a structure you understand how it might work
S0262	sort of like a blueprint or something
S0261	yeah you could say erm a a blueprint or a or a foundation a erm a a skeleton that kind of thing erm and so when i say evaluation be research erm that be as it suggest that erm it be a part of research it be there's a research process and evaluation be just a part of that erm that be link to an architecture which be some kind of structure and context of that research and the map show the way so you know once you've get a structure how to work through that and out of that you might get erm this these bits that be at the bottom which be that erm you've get reflection critique and learn so you look at something you've carry out an experiment i know there be one in there that be experiment and i didn't pick it out but erm you reflect on what come out of it erm there's a critique of of some elements erm and you and of course evaluation and out of that erm er the result be learn
S0262	mm
S0261	erm so what's leave there be there be one which be management which be kind of leave on its own erm but i see it as erm er the pure form of management in the context of its its erm work through process erm and and er lead lead define erm take control of how it all fit together i suppose it's an overarch thing cos i'm think in term of experiment and erm that kind of thing
S0262	you be be very you're you see this be this be this be interest it's like that guy who do the er how how to be more creative yeah
S0261	mm
S0262	erm you have come up with i mean i know the other guy be at work and constraints of be at work but you know you've come up with quite a awesome thing
S0261	i have i haven't look at that one yet
S0262	okay but i'm just say but look how many metaphors you've come up with
S0261	mm thank discovery evolution blueprint constraint thread creation skeleton control mm
S0262	so you want to talk about the last one
S0261	yeah last one so that's get evaluation as a risk as technology and as an argument and they're all on a er a horizontal line erm so technology me quite often relate to erm things that have be create technology by by i suppose by definition be something that have come out of a process that have be quite risky
S0262	mm mm
S0261	yeah so to so to so to push boundaries and come up with new thing and that be what technology relate to erm that er that part of that process be go through a huge amount of risk erm experiment discovery evaluation erm learn so on and so on erm and i've get beside that evaluation as a argument and erm not too sure why i've associate them together but kind of just felt from the gut to be something that should fit together
S0262	it could be because you might have think of it as a defence
S0261	erm erm
S0262	you defend you know when you've take a risk you've process it you've create it
S0261	yes it be it be how it be it be how argument argument be associate with risk
S0262	yes yes
S0261	so it might better go erm i didn't know which way round to put these but it might better go risk argument technology that you take a risk at something you've define an approach you take a certain direction erm there'll be people erm and result that come out of take such a a direction in relation to technology that can be blind alleyways or they might be erm er challenge point of view from other people et cetera and so you have to you have to erm defend your argument you have to define why you've you be do this thing and erm present to people erm good a good basis for why they should believe in it to influence people convince them erm and then beyond that erm i'm put this in the context of technology so erm technology be risky and you have to go through quite a few difficult paths to produce anything that's relate to technology
S0262	mm absolutely
S0261	that's to create tool that be technology i suppose once you've create the tool that make things easier quite often
S0262	yeah yeah
