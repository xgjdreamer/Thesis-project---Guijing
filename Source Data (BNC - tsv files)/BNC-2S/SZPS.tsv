S0179	american society
S0058	yes no it be um
S0179	that be what the entire thing be so sort of massive inequality um
S0058	mm yeah the have and the have not
S0179	the countryside versus rich cities
S0058	yep
S0179	and the whole sort of the er the sort of state versus federal government
S0058	mhm
S0179	which be the central of the entire thing
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	um
S0058	and i quite like the idea of take sort of jerry springer like a step too far
S0179	oh yes it do it be
S0058	the idea of entertainment sort of yeah entertainment through watch other people's
S0179	suffer
S0058	suffer exactly yeah
S0179	well that i mean that's nothing new i mean
S0058	yep
S0179	they've do show er they've do film and television program base on take reality tv too far
S0058	oh yeah
S0179	before
S0058	i don't think that be the main point but it do sort of make me think of that actually that bite which be
S0179	yeah indeed
S0058	interest
S0179	oh police cars
S0179	wait for
S0058	unfortunate
S0179	that would be really funny if the just in front of them now
S0058	yeah
S0179	sorry can't get out
S0058	oh dear
S0179	um that be yes
S0058	yeah it be um so presumably it's call the hunger game because there's er very little food
S0179	well i think the idea
S0058	or
S0179	of be which be only mention very briefly that you can trade sort of increase odds for food
S0058	right right
S0179	um
S0058	which be presumably why that guy have so many
S0179	yes
S0058	i didn't know if it be a kind of punishment
S0179	no i think it be
S0058	yeah yeah i think it's suppose to be buy them but um yeah fascinate
S0179	yeah indeed yeah
S0058	and very kind of captivate i think like the it be really quite grip i think and the way they build it up as well be really nice so you have all the bits at the begin and sort of really interest costume and and stuff
S0179	mm
S0058	all that kind of idea and the sort of um play the media an image kind of idea about it the sort of miss congeniality question bite
S0179	er yes er of course miss congeniality would have probably do fairly well in that situation
S0058	yeah
S0179	um
S0058	she'd have be fine um follow by the quite you know the sort of horrible bite and i think it just work really you know really quite well so i i wonder what happen in the sequels cos presumably there's gonna be something with this love triangle go on
S0179	i've no idea and all the politics of it
S0058	yeah um
S0179	um but it
S0058	i i be just like as i be watch it i i wasn't sure whether it be gonna be kind of say three film for for the whole story or whether they be gonna stop halfway through the game um but i couldn't really see them
S0179	well no that would've
S0058	do that cos that would've be yeah
S0179	far too
S0058	exactly yeah um
S0179	um
S0058	er and then i didn't know if it be different people each time and just a sort of different storyline but i think well how different could you make it
S0179	yeah
S0058	so i assume it's gonna be the same people
S0179	the political upheaval follow
S0058	yeah and i mean i be wonder if they be gonna put the same two back in
S0179	yeah
S0058	as a sort of
S0179	mm
S0058	yeah
S0058	just a to keep to keep sort of milk that one i love the idea of it be like a a computerize thing they could put in little
S0179	yeah
S0058	you know sort of play with it quite creepy
S0179	what be i gonna say um um well i just find it fascinate as an exercise in tactics
S0058	mm but i just don't understand why you'd form an alliance with someone
S0179	well no but there's obvious reason for it i mean it keep you a it it give you if you're the strongest half
S0058	mm
S0179	then that mean you have good odds of survive the first half
S0058	and then you
S0179	which you then split split up again
S0058	mm yeah
S0179	um but
S0058	it rely on other people play fair though cos surely
S0179	well indeed you have to
S0058	someone could gather all the strong people to then kill them all
S0179	well it would be inherently quite difficult to kill them
S0058	but then that's the hard bite yeah
S0179	um light today
S0058	mm yeah there's that awkward er thing where like you say be that um little girl have save her the trouble of
S0179	kill her
S0058	kill her herself cos everyone else be do it
S0179	i think that's quite predictable
S0058	yeah exactly
S0179	but i assume that the friend be gonna be kill
S0058	yeah i do
S0179	it be a surprisingly yeah that be a very sort of yeah this be a book for sort of children as in this be that be a very positive end to it
S0058	yes exactly and i mean as it be a book for teenagers in that the love kind of idea and it be you be right it be very twighlight
S0179	um similar strong female lead
S0058	yeah
S0179	and um two potential male love interest yes
S0058	yeah
S0179	er
S0058	who look like they would actually murder each other
S0179	well no but who
S0058	one get a bite hairy at night
S0179	yeah
S0058	one's a bite pale i love twilight i think twilight be finish so that's why i be surprise when that trailer come on i didn't know whether it be gonna be a spoof but then i think well no it's actually them so
S0179	no she's finally a vampire now life be superb
S0058	i love that we're the same temperature great really chilly
S0058	know what i mean i know what you mean
S0179	yes we've get markedly different thermal capacities
S0179	so therefore we contain different amount of store energy
S0058	yeah
S0058	oh my goodness
S0179	it be a bite unfortunate um
S0058	i dunno twighlight's just funny oh it's such a good idea get in touch with and go and see it with him in oxford
S0058	oh hilarious you know not in a cinema
S0179	in a cinema yeah
S0058	yeah you no not in a cinema such a good experience
S0179	um what be i gonna say tut
S0058	yeah um apart from be quite twightlighty it be good or rather despite be quite quite twighlighty it be good
S0179	yeah indeed it be um
S0058	as in it wasn't all er while they have that element of it it wasn't all moony and kind of oh i love you
S0179	no it be very good
S0058	it be it be kind of and i mean be the interest thing be as well that she's be she play it be she do it to survive and what's gonna happen cos
S0179	no i don't think so because if she be do it to survive she would have kill him at the end
S0058	no but i mean she could
S0179	no but she there be two opportunities for her when she could
S0058	yeah oh no entirely but i mean
S0179	survivor that doesn't make sense
S0058	she she could've not want him to die but she i mean she might not be in love with him she might he she might be a very very close friend
S0179	well no but that's quite a step to yeah well she be will to kill herself to avoid him die i think that's sort of a serious er level of commitment
S0058	no i i mean i'm just wonder if it would be more interest if um
S0179	i think you might be overthinking this a bite
S0058	i dunno just cos that's what that be the point like that he tell her all the way along he she be be tell you've get if you play this you'll be you'll survive because that's what it's it's an angle and she do it which make me think that maybe she be do it for that reason because she do ultimately
S0179	yes but no but she know that she be go to survive even she know she have better odds of survival if she didn't do that that's the point that which so disprove that
S0058	i dunno i just never get the feel that she be that into him i think that's maybe gonna be the the sort of the interest thing for the next film that she's maybe not that into him but because they've get this
S0179	i think you're just
S0058	okay fair enough
S0179	completely take that the wrong way i think she's into both of them which be where the conflict interest come in
S0058	okay fair enough
S0179	it'd be far too bore if she wasn't no
S0058	fair enough maybe could always read the book cos presumably the book be finish
S0179	no as in just run better if she be just play and she want to survive she would've a shoot one or both of her men both have go off the edge or secondly she'd have just shoot him at the end
S0058	no but i'm say she maybe wasn't do it just to survive she might not be head over heal in love with him want to spend the rest of her life with him she might just not have want to kill him
S0179	well then
S0058	and think well i don't want this game to be like you know cos they say at the begin um that if they could do something
S0179	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0058	to make a stand
S0179	i know but that's a hell of a risk to take unless you've get a
S0058	no but i'm say maybe she wasn't will to die to not let the game win
S0179	yeah possibly
S0058	do it like that's the
S0179	probably not because she be very keen to get home to her sister that be the priority throughout so it would have to have be a much stronger reason than sort of general social
S0058	but i
S0179	that just doesn't fly i'm sorry
S0058	i just wasn't convince i didn't i
S0179	well that's probably the act
S0058	well yeah possibly
S0179	or the script
S0058	it be possibly just like yeah possibly slighty kinda
S0179	or the fact that you're not a teenager
S0058	maybe
S0179	in natality at least
S0058	yeah i know what you mean well it'll be interest to see what do happen slash wikipedia it when we get in no we can't look up what happen that's bad but yeah so i assume the be the book finish have there have there be three
S0179	no idea
S0058	mm
S0179	well i yeah cos i get that free sample of the first book in with the dvd award thing
S0058	oh yes you do how be it
S0179	first chapter it be good
S0058	be it quite well write
S0179	it seem to be it be interest
S0058	yeah mm cos of course now there's gonna be a massive spike in the er book sales
S0179	yes
S0058	but i mean there's i use to read stuff like not maybe not stuff quite as dark as that but i use to read sort of teen fantasy type stuff quite a lot but most of it
S0179	dark material to sort of give to children
S0058	but of course in a book you can you can er you can really either play it up make it quite graphic or you can play it down and just have them die you don't need to put so much detail about it but the
S0179	well that be really play down it be ridiculous you couldn't even
S0058	yep there be very little blood
S0179	tell who'd die
S0058	yeah i suppose i mean the book could be like that really quite clean um but just the idea's quite horrible but sort of suitable for for teenagers kind of kinda book um but
S0179	what cos teenagers be quite horrible
S0058	yeah no teenagers could handle that idea like that's not you know
S0179	i find it difficult handle that idea it's quite a disturb one
S0058	no but as in like
S0179	the people particularly it's particularly disturb in the open sequence as in people you be train you be
S0058	mm
S0179	sort of you know try to kill like it's it's a very different thing fight in a war where you're don't know your enemy
S0058	yeah
S0179	your enemy become a uniform target
S0058	yes
S0179	in this particular case you know you get to know people you be go to try to kill
S0058	yeah that be what i find i i wouldn't have talk to anyone cos that be kind of potentially decrease your
S0179	it would impair
S0058	yeah
S0179	your ability to kill them
S0058	exactly it's gonna decrease your exactly your um ability to see them as an enemy
S0179	target
S0058	yeah
S0179	yep
S0058	cos yeah i just wouldn't be talk to any of them if it have be me
S0179	ah that lead me
S0058	but
S0179	to the next question firstly so how do you think you would've cop
S0058	i think i would've be very quickly kill oh my phone just buzz oh it's it's that alarm i set aha flight sale there we be
S0058	oh yes um yeah i think a lie in tomorrow um
S0179	um
S0058	what be we say
S0179	the other thing you be say be
S0058	oh yeah how how would i cope
S0179	yeah
S0058	well i dunno i think i'd have do better than the very small children just from the perspective of be relatively physically fit but i think i'd have be quite dreadful at the sort of psychological element of it
S0179	mm you may have be clever enough not to light a fire
S0058	yeah i think i'd have maybe work it out not too badly but yeah when it come down to it i'm not sure i'd have be any good at it i would have take the hide and wait for it to end sort of approach
S0179	that may have actually work pretty well
S0058	yeah i would've literally like yeah dig a hole sit in it until everybody else have go home you know um which might have work i dunno
S0179	well it would be difficult to search an area that large
S0058	yeah
S0179	definitely yeah
S0058	but would they have
S0179	you'd last for a few days you could last for you know twenty four forty eight hours without water
S0058	exactly
S0179	over a week without food you know you realistically could wait it out
S0058	um but of course would they let you like for the whole point your your idea about run to the edge and just be the fastest she do but they stop her by the fire so that if like if you'd hide underground they'd be like oh well she's obviously gonna win let's sort of get her out and they'd have come up with something some way of get you out
S0179	this be true um
S0058	which be the problem with any strategy
S0179	but
S0058	though they can you can it
S0179	but i assume that they'd leave it in as fair and i be surprise that they interfere because they'd think that would be unpopular
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	mind you of course they're try to make it interest so it's just like reality tv yeah
S0058	yeah exactly yeah
S0058	sort of fiddle with it yeah um
S0179	er well i think it be definitely the right policy to run at the start um
S0058	yes would you grab the right kit
S0179	yes um but i think she should've more actively try to hunt them as in
S0058	mm
S0179	don't want to let your enemy come to you you want to come you want to find them on your term
S0058	well while she be up in the tree could she not have shoot them
S0179	yeah but she didn't have an arrow
S0058	oh she didn't have a bow and arrow at that point do she
S0179	no no that's right er but
S0058	yeah she really should've take more opportunities like when she be gonna destroy the um the what's it she could've surely shoot the guy with a spear
S0179	what guy this be
S0058	um so when the they leave the stuff all pile up and there be one guy leave on guard
S0179	yes well she should've kill him
S0058	she should've kill him yeah it's just you know and she should've kill the um the guy who let her live if possible you know when he sort of run off like that kinda thing like i think there's a point she wasn't really play like that which
S0179	oh er
S0058	she she obviously wouldn't really have work as a character and stuff
S0179	no
S0058	but yeah i agree
S0179	er to take it to another extreme all of that actually the character thing do kind of work because you want people who be watch to like you
S0058	mm
S0179	to help you
S0058	yeah
S0179	um so but leave that aside i mean basic things so er the girl who die
S0058	yeah
S0179	food
S0058	well yeah indeed horrible but true
S0179	yeah um
S0058	but again that gesture may be make unpopular
S0179	you well it wouldn't have occur to her but then that's why she's not
S0058	mm
S0179	quite a lot of things so yeah just sequence of small things like that
S0058	mm
S0179	you should be
S0058	yeah
S0179	prepare to take advantage as in i think the odd
S0058	in all fairness i mean the er if people be into that kind of like programme if you like that kind of entertainment then you'd think they'd be they'd be quite you know they wouldn't mind so much if you be kill people cos
S0179	no but no they wouldn't if you're too efficient if you're too good
S0058	mm
S0179	then that wouldn't that count in your favour er people fundamentally like an underdog it's it but it you know chance
S0058	yeah
S0179	because that make it entertain
S0058	yeah
S0179	and unpredictable
S0058	yeah
S0179	that's why out of the question always work well cos it's always not expect it to be
S0058	yeah
S0179	or at least if it be it's to the fact that
S0058	yeah
S0179	they be who you
S0058	so obvious
S0179	expect it to be
S0058	yeah
S0179	um you know
S0058	yeah
S0179	i speak sense
S0179	now i'm a little bite concern about go back on the bypass because it's that sort of time on a saturday night where you might get boy racers up there
S0058	oh okay
S0179	we'll see
S0058	mm we could always just stay out of the way
S0179	sorry
S0058	i guess
S0179	yes just a little bite of forward plan
S0058	yes indeed yeah i would never have think of that i'd have think great you know late night clear
S0179	yes that may be what they're think
S0058	yes
S0179	ah
S0058	ah
S0179	anyway
S0058	yeah anyway
S0179	so how do you think i would've do
S0058	i think you'd have win quite simply um yeah but you're good at that sort of it's exactly your kind of game
S0179	it's er yeah
S0058	of survival plus strength
S0179	hunt
S0058	plus hunt exactly
S0179	i'd have want a rifle
S0058	i don't think that's the idea i i don't think people be like i want a rifle okay there's one
S0179	there's a um
S0058	yeah true they'd wouldn't have fit in one of those little balloon things though a full dart rifle
S0179	a handgun would've do
S0058	yep
S0179	er
S0058	mm i dunno i like the kind of weird post apocalyptic old fashionedness of it the sort of really old fashion clothe and stuff
S0179	you never saw a gun out of the entire film
S0058	no
S0058	that's what i be just what i be think it be all bow and arrows and swords in this kind of
S0179	no but even the enforcers didn't seem to have firearms
S0058	no
S0179	which i find kind of funny
S0058	yeah i guess the the sort of the tone of it i wouldn't say that the tone clash anyway that be the point er that their kind of shiny multi colour weird world wasn't the same as the kind of
S0179	i mean again there be a few other factor so i wouldn't i'm just think about them show so
S0058	mm
S0179	i would've if i'd be her i'd have cut my hair off very quickly
S0058	yep
S0179	um potentially use it as a bow string um that would've be very suitable actually um i would have make damn sure that my fairly light skin be mud up as soon as possible
S0058	yeah you could see all of the the white skin in the the er surely first thing to do bite of camouflage
S0179	um
S0058	it be interest er i mean one thing that do irk me a little bite be that amazingly blend in rock thing er how do he do that do you know what i mean he's not magic
S0179	well if a rock be cover in a particular material it wouldn't be that difficult to
S0058	mm i dunno it be just a little bite too good
S0179	oh shush
S0058	but the idea be good
S0179	yes mm i mean i also think there's other things they could've do so particularly with the two of them it would have be a very effective lure and hunter combination
S0058	right
S0179	so even if he be wound that could've work quite well
S0058	yeah
S0179	headlights would make life easier
S0058	mm
S0179	anyway
S0058	yeah um no i agree that could've work quite well um
S0179	but needle to say
S0179	it wasn't me
S0058	no if it have be everything would've be alright
S0179	well no but i
S0179	wouldn't want to end up kill children
S0058	fair enough yeah you saw some of the little ones when they're sit on the plane go there and so their feet didn't the floor and you just think oh my god pff you know
S0179	but that's the thing i think it's a children's book cos children just read it and see it at face value but if they actually start to think about what it would actually involve if it i think it's that's why it's almost more disturb for someone who's actually a bite older and think
S0058	yeah
S0179	actually hold on a second
S0058	no i know what you mean
S0179	this be quite sick
S0058	that's that's the thing with children yeah i mean
S0179	and that's why there's i think that work with children who be young enough not to think about what it actually mean
S0058	but have say that though teenagers be quite capable of think about that kind of thing
S0179	no they're not they think they be but they're not um so you know but war be one thing and that's horrific but that's a whole new level of disturb because you be have to you be be put in a position where you be be force to kill in order to survive but you're not but no er yeah as a soldier in a war you be fight er yeah you be fight an an enemy for a purpose
S0058	yeah
S0179	you're fight to you know often for a country or to
S0058	yeah an ideology or
S0179	exactly
S0058	yeah
S0179	and there's something drive you
S0058	yeah
S0179	but here er you be kill in order to just to survive
S0058	yeah not
S0179	yep which be
S0058	i guess the i mean the idea be that it it kind of force you to become an animal
S0179	yeah exactly but that's why it's disturb
S0058	yeah
S0179	and
S0058	and i guess that's
S0179	no but but er i don't think unless you really make an active effort to put yourself in their shoe i don't i think it would be very easy to gloss over that film but you know there's sort of twelve year olds in there and they can't possibly understand and i think i think very few um to be fair almost no one could understand exactly what that be like but i think that there's level of understand isn't there because er i'm very i'd be very disturb frankly if a lot of the twelve year olds in there
S0058	mm
S0179	understand it
S0058	but
S0179	and think about it in
S0058	but i mean that's okay like
S0179	yeah but i'm not sure it's okay to i'm still not sure if it's an appropriate film for a appropriate film for that age range
S0058	really
S0179	yeah that's why i don't think it yeah it it's just
S0058	no but you could say that so you could say okay so pirate of the caribbean actually if you think about it piracy's really quite horrendous and
S0179	no but not like that's a sort of that's a set for a storyline which be fun and fantasy this be this be entire premise the entire er er there be no plot around it this be the plot
S0058	mm
S0179	um it's not just a set and it's yeah disturb
S0058	also a bite like noughts and cross
S0179	sorry
S0058	um have you do do you know noughts and cross by malorie blackman
S0179	no
S0058	um well it's a series of book the first one's noughts and cross and it's a kind of um the idea be it's a a universe where um black people be the cross i think and they're the they're the superior race they're the they're the have and the white be noughts um and they're they're nothing they're they're they're completely reject and second class citizens and slave basically
S0179	right
S0058	um and that's
S0179	oh i see what they do there with the noughts
S0058	yeah um and that's a similar kind of um it's quite disturb and people get kill and um
S0179	yes but it's one thing to have people be kill it's another thing to no i don't think that be different that be something and again it's very effective but i think it would've be far better you know huh in that film it wasn't the graphicness of the violence that be the disturb thing it be the concept
S0058	mm
S0179	and i think the fact that it be clean you know there wasn't any blood
S0058	yeah
S0179	ring
S0058	ah it's probably your mum no it's you um i mean i can
S0179	be you sure right well i'll wait till we get there
S0058	yeah yeah sure ah it's probably cos you didn't let your mum know till we get back
S0179	well we haven't get back
S0058	no exactly no but she will think we set off at half five and haven't get back to yet
S0179	that's entirely accurate
S0058	yes she wouldn't have know that we stop somewhere
S0179	as soon as we get up to speed you can um pass me the phone um right can you check the text probably delete it
S0058	it's probably a voicemail
S0179	well whatever delete it
S0058	yeah one new voice message yeah shall i just leave it or
S0179	no listen to it and then delete it tell her to stop leave me fuck voicemails
S0058	it say voice mailbox number be that nine o one
S0179	yeah should be
S0058	oh wow okay yeah it be um i think it must be liam it's very loud and i can't hear what's be say it's just kind of voice
S0179	okay
S0058	yeah it's it's not your mum it's um
S0179	okay
S0058	one miss call show liam yeah oh that's fine then
S0179	oh alright
S0058	do you wanna just leave it or
S0179	yeah just leave it
S0058	yeah well if he ring again i can um
S0179	yeah
S0058	i hear another voice and i think oh my god what's happen where's peter's mum oh hang on it might not be she do sort of when she when she be um mention it she do say oh yeah if you remember you know she didn't seem terribly concern so
S0179	um
S0058	ah
S0179	so yes er film
S0058	yeah um
S0179	yeah so
S0058	good
S0179	that be fine just fine yeah i think it be like that's why i think it be a little bite a waste opportunity for far more think provoke
S0058	mm
S0179	for far more sort of it be a brilliant concept for er could of be take a lot further
S0058	mm
S0179	but in some ways
S0058	but that would be an entirely different book
S0179	yeah but it wasn't as in
S0058	but
S0179	like i say fundamentally disturb thing be the concept and i think that be think about it like in every scene it's not like in every in in every scene where two of them be together like any two of them or two or more it's like well at any point you're just gonna start kill each other
S0058	yeah but
S0179	and the fact they choose not to go into that and to make it very simplistic didn't remove that threat or that menace
S0058	hm
S0179	the fact most people wouldn't be aware of certainly not a lot of the younger audience who wouldn't think of it like that
S0058	but yeah i mean you could've do that but then it's just a different story like
S0179	well no it's the same story it's just more
S0058	mm but it's not the same market
S0179	it's not
S0058	it's it's it's about market and it's not it wasn't for that it be for
S0179	but that's the point
S0058	the teenage market
S0179	it isn't like that
S0058	possibly
S0179	i know and i understand what you're say
S0058	actually
S0179	but it should i'm say it shouldn't have be
S0058	no
S0179	because in reality i think it be actually virtually
S0179	no less disturb like that
S0058	mm
S0179	but and therefore i don't know that it be really appropriate for that audience and it be rely on the audience's naivety to protect them from be disturb by it which i think
S0058	i think twelve year olds be fine like i think they're capable of not be too disturb they're they're capable of be disturb by things in in understand in a more
S0179	no er you see i you see the older like
S0058	i mean i say twelve year olds
S0179	but you see but
S0058	like fifteen year olds they could
S0179	yeah but okay so
S0058	er like sixteen year olds be see that as well
S0179	sh sh sh shut up for a minute so i find actually that film that i watch when i be younger i watch them again now and they disturb me far more
S0058	mm
S0179	as an adult who actually think about it in more depth than because when i be a child i just sort of gloss over but when you're sort of like oh it's er oh it's austin power who say you know it's just a um you know henchman's family sort of thing
S0058	yeah
S0179	you start think actually you know in this scene you know ten people just get kill
S0058	yeah
S0179	and actually that's really disturb and tragic um but as a child you just gloss over it oh people just die it's fine and you don't really understand what that mean or think about it in that way
S0058	mm
S0179	but certainly for me if i'd watch that film when i be fifteen or i dunno twelve i would've find it much less odd than i do now
S0058	mm yeah that's probably true
S0179	and hence yet again like i say to you um they rely on the naivety of the audience to protect them from be disturb which i think be a very odd thing to do um
S0058	well that's a bite odd but aren't you also just present young mind with a very difficult situation to think about which surely be the point of the book to to give you something to think about and i think that's quite a good thing to be think about um it's it's a very difficult story to um get your teeth into and to to think about even if you're not think about it necessarily in the same way you would or i would or you know somebody who's fight in a war would it it's kind of i don't think it's a er er wrong to
S0179	well i do
S0058	okay i mean i i i think so for example at the age of how old would i have be thirteen maybe i read a book about the death of god and that's inappropriate material for a child of that age they can't think about theology in that kind of way
S0179	i dunno
S0058	but that image strike with me and it i think about it and it i grow up and think about it and it it disturb me at the time and i you know and the er i get more out of it as i get older that that idea that story and i think i think it's good even if people aren't you know like i say i you know you get something from it at the time and then you revisit it as you get older and i think that's what the best kind of teenage young people's literature can do can mean something to you when you're that age and it can keep grow and it mean obviously literature mean different things to different people anyway i don't think there's a a twelve year old brain well well it would be nice if there be in in term of market things
S0179	yes and all of what you're say be completely true
S0058	mm
S0179	but isn't quite as disturb as that concept it be a very very warp
S0058	okay
S0179	very strange
S0058	okay well i mean think about the film matilda which be essentially about child abuse
S0179	again
S0058	so
S0179	it's a far less disturb concept
S0058	okay but do you enjoy it
S0179	yes i enjoy it
S0179	tremendously i think it be fuck good
S0058	good
S0179	just mar
S0179	i'd have say you shouldn't have it be brilliant it be well make it be a very good premise it just wasn't execute in either a way that either it be appropriate or that be fulfil its potential
S0058	mm but like i say an eighteen isn't good for money um cos a lot of the people who go to the cinema be quite young
S0179	yes well i think that's again a problem for rat um mm
S0058	well it's like borat um not borat um bruno so sacha baron cohen make two versions an eighteen and a fifteen so that all the adults would be like oh well i'm gonna go and see the eighteen it'll be rude and crude or whatever um but it also mean you could get another three years worth of yeah three years worth of cinema go public in there pay money for it which people do sort of say well they can't you know not great but
S0179	why not
S0058	yeah he be just be awkward about the fact that that's what people do except they only release the nicer one normally um so yeah that be a a tone down version cos it would've i think they what they probably do be give it a sort of rough rat and then they can
S0179	mm
S0058	yeah do things to it and soften things and do a little bite of tweak
S0179	well to be fair it be very formulatic formulaic as in there be probably very you know it be probably for the tight guidelines
S0058	yeah
S0179	and
S0058	and you can stick to it but i know that they do take things out that they'd shoot so maybe they shoot it watch it and go uh uh uh yeah this isn't gonna this be tick these box for a fifteen i mean there must be quite tight guidelines because otherwise how would you you know you you couldn't be subjective
S0179	mm some of it might be but yeah
S0058	mm to a certain extent it have to but it's like mark an exam an english exam because you know obviously it's gonna be a bite subjective but you
S0179	the box aren't subjective but the things that you be choose for the box be
S0058	mm
S0058	i think that's a really fascinate topic actually how film be rat um
S0179	yes i mean er
S0058	and you know
S0058	and you you notice at the begin they have the sort of fancy old fashion um sort of certificate
S0179	mm
S0058	to mark the hundred years of it which be interest in itself
S0179	well they be rat silent film
S0058	er nineteen twelve first talkie i believe be nineteen twelve so hit there be some maybe something about different people think about film in a different way and the oh i love the history of cinema or be it slightly earlier be it nineteen o seven anyway never mind um but yes oh i do find interest when we be buy ticket do you see the um sort of big sign behind the desk which er have the rat on it um it be one say you know um eighteen no change fifteen
S0179	fuck
S0058	so where's he go
S0179	mm
S0058	er yeah um what be i say um oh yeah that be it yeah so it have sort of all the rat and then and um in the middle it have the new twelve a rat and i be like oh that be how many years ago ten years ago
S0179	about that
S0058	about ten years ago
S0058	so it's a very old sign actually no i think it come out about the same time as the second lord of the ring film
S0179	mm
S0058	i'm i'm fairly certain that it do cos that be why they be think about it
S0179	no it's sensible except when you point out you know it make it very difficult for people with kid sort of between ten and twelve to go to the cinema because there be very little they could see
S0058	mm
S0179	they didn't want to see the pgs
S0058	yeah
S0179	but fifty i really should know that
S0058	possibly
S0179	oh well
S0058	er
S0179	take that non intuitive speed limit
S0058	yeah cos if it be all film like spiderman that which i think be a twelve a um
S0179	just kill the beam because as we go over the hill
S0058	yeah
S0179	if we approach that that's gonna really blind back up um
S0058	mhm um yeah so i mean spiderman yeah i think it be one of the ones where it be kind of well you know parent can have a say you know have a say in this because it's kind of disturb but not too much so
S0179	mm
S0058	so it's you know it's a bite violent but not horrendously so but i remember see um you know the the bad batman film
S0179	yeah
S0058	um with arnold schwarzenegger
S0179	well all film be a bite interest
S0058	well yeah true but i mean i can't remember what it's call but it have um uma thurman in it as poison ivy and arnold schwarzenegger as the ice man or something and he freeze things um and he have catchphrases like ice to meet you it be just dreadful um and i saw that when i be really young and it be just not nice it's cos that be a pg and we must've say yeah let's go and see that mum be like i dunno you might not like it and i didn't we didn't particularly mostly because it wasn't very good
S0179	yeah
S0058	i think even at the time we realize
S0179	you see the first lord of the ring i can't believe that's a pg
S0058	yeah yeah
S0179	that film disturb me i be about sixteen when i watch it
S0058	first lord of the ring i don't think you be that old cos i wasn't fifteen um
S0179	er in that ballpark anyway fifteen sixteen
S0058	well i saw all of them before sixth form so the and they come out three successive years so
S0179	i i don't actually care
S0058	okay fair enough i think we be a bite younger than that but yeah um no i mean the first film be um
S0179	but it it
S0058	presumably it stay
S0179	scar me i remember that
S0058	oh no it be very scary presumably it just stay just the right side of it to be give the pg whereas the second and third ones didn't they presumably skip over the line
S0179	the first one be by far the scariest
S0058	yeah i think so yeah the the threat
S0179	yeah
S0058	i think be so strong in the first one um whereas after that it be just more downright kind of evil rather than just yeah threat mm menace um
S0179	mm
S0058	but
S0179	sort of the idea er theme er split personality golem
S0058	yeah
S0179	very strange
S0058	but that's the second film though
S0179	er
S0058	you er
S0179	in the first film er
S0058	but you don't really see golem though cos they hadn't properly um kind of finish design him so you see his eye and his hand in the mine of moria but you don't actually see him you find out what happen but you don't see his final final form
S0179	yeah yeah
S0058	until the second film i'm yeah nerd um
S0058	yeah i mean that's that's pretty bad yeah um even that's not one of the obvious things either that be still quite yeah
S0179	what be we gonna do about food
S0058	um do you wanna go and i mean yeah gonna be eleven or twelve i think so do you wanna go and see if the chinese be open
S0179	three quarter of an hour that's probably
S0058	mm it's pretty close
S0179	sorry
S0058	it's pretty close it's not too far bite too far to you know just to pop along but er
S0179	what be you talk about oh the cinema
S0058	the yeah
S0179	it's only of the order of twice the time to get to
S0058	mm
S0179	slightly more but
S0058	yeah i mean
S0179	and of course there be no traffic at this time of night
S0058	no
S0179	but in all fair actually no for cinema i reckon we could get back in fifteen minutes at this time of night
S0058	yeah
S0179	particularly if one wasn't too bother about speed limit
S0179	um
S0058	um do you wanna go to the chinese see if it's open if it's not go to domino's
S0179	oh we could park on
S0058	oh
S0179	the double yellow line outside
S0179	live dangerously er
S0058	might be a policeman hide somewhere
S0179	er i be gonna say the police will have nothing better to do tonight
S0058	yeah
S0179	so let's not do that
S0058	no
S0179	um
S0058	do yeah do you wanna go and see if that's open
S0179	er
S0058	domino's be probably midnight
S0179	do you know we could just park outside domino's
S0058	yeah and walk up what do you think do you wanna do that
S0179	um i'm not hugely hungry
S0179	i might like a bite of something savoury
S0058	yeah
S0179	actually yeah
S0058	i i wouldn't mind something to eat and we could just go back and bung something in the microwave out of the freezer like
S0179	mm
S0058	if you want um
S0179	not very appetizing
S0179	i wouldn't er my personal favourite would probably be to share a cod and chip or something but um
S0058	pff i'm not mm i find fish and chip a little bite difficult to kind of stomach
S0179	could you possibly signal
S0058	wow
S0179	that's just
S0058	he signal once he turn which
S0179	it's just
S0058	be just insane
S0179	i wish when it be blatantly obvious what you be do
S0058	yeah
S0179	christ some people be ignorant
S0058	i mean yeah if if you don't fancy
S0179	yeah well i'd beat myself up if i realize that i'd miss a signal that would've be marginally beneficial to someone
S0058	yeah you be right behind him
S0179	well let's not make it sound like it be tailgate him but yes
S0058	no no but i mean er you be blatantly there he must have see you and know you be there he's he do bother to signal afterwards he clearly realize at some point along that process that you be there
S0179	but might not of
S0058	he might not yeah he maybe he be just signal out of habit at the point he normally signal wouldn't be surprise
S0179	there be literally zero point in that signal
S0058	no
S0179	er so what look open
S0058	okay let's have a look huh fish and chicken be shut
S0179	domino's
S0058	domino's look like it could well be open i'm not sure the light be on um so pizza or chinese i think be probably the best look like a domino's employee
S0179	i'd be surprise if they be shut
S0058	what fish and chicken
S0179	maximum stay four hours probably alright then
S0058	probably manage yeah
S0179	right
