S0426	both of those together
S0427	roughly four thousand pound
S0426	do you have to buy the materials
S0427	that's include
S0426	that's include materials
S0427	the the materials be about er they you know the bath the two toilets the two wash basins
S0426	mm mm
S0427	the tile and so on that be about nine hundred and ninety pound or something which i give him months ago so that he could go buy them
S0426	yeah he could just go and buy them
S0427	he even fit a new door between down the side of my house because we have another wooden gate have fall to piece erm er erm and that be include in the price and the door itself be a hundred and seventy pound with hinge
S0426	yeah yeah yeah
S0427	the last thing he do be downstairs i've get one of those light pull
S0426	yes
S0427	you know on a little piece of cord
S0426	yes yes
S0427	and i happen to notice that it be wear through
S0426	right
S0427	because they always
S0426	fray they fray that's right
S0427	they get fray he say oh all we get to do he say be take the unscrew it
S0426	yes
S0427	and then you can re wire it
S0426	that's right exactly
S0427	re tie it well he take it off himself he say you can't they they it's a switch you have get to buy a whole new thing
S0426	oh right
S0427	last day he turn up for work which be with my be monday he come in and he say i get you a new one and he say oh i say what do you need he say oh don't worry about it i'll fit it for you and he fit it for me and do it and he even put the the gungy stuff round the outside to make sure it be all nice and neat
S0426	yes yes yeah well that's a cooperative bloke and reliable and the rest of it
S0427	whether he whether he work up in or not but he'll give you free estimate and all the rest of it
S0426	it might just be worth his while for that kind of money cos otherwise it's you know two hour not kind of two hours
S0427	well he live in
S0426	well that be two hours then
S0427	yeah yeah i suppose so
S0426	well about an hour and
S0427	i don't know how far afield he work and he work more than i mean i it take me something like five months to get him because he be book up
S0426	ah yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0427	well so much so that i'm gonna have him back in about year's time to do my kitchen
S0426	book him now and then you have him in
S0427	yeah he's even tell me how to get it do cheaply like go to
S0426	well kitchens be necessarily go to be more expensive because of all the appliances all the gas and so on and so on
S0427	yeah exactly yeah so but he do it all
S0426	good for him
S0427	and he's he's a carpenter basically and he do and he well he do kitchens and bathrooms but anyway you're you're more than welcome to come around and
S0426	that's very good but why do he have to change your bath bath be usually pretty
S0427	well you see again it just annoy me
S0426	okay
S0427	because it's it's as old as the house now i've be there since two thousand and the house be about seven years old then so
S0426	mm mm be it a plastic one rather than a metal or ceramic one
S0427	well erm the bath be plastic
S0427	anyway but the thing be it be it be like a light blue colour and the one downstairs be like a a sort of a pale yellowy colour well i'd just put white in there
S0426	okay okay
S0427	erm and my brother bless him do the tile upstairs in the guest bathroom
S0426	that's very good of him
S0427	but unfortunately neither he nor i know that you can't put ceramic tile onto a wooden floor unless you
S0426	ah have a a some
S0427	cos what happen be all all the gunge between the tile start to crack
S0426	yes yeah yes yes yes yes
S0427	it look okay but you know to my eye
S0426	yeah yeah true
S0427	but to anyone else it's like to my eye though
S0426	mm but it's just not flat enough if it's a wooden floor
S0427	no that's right so erm
S0426	mm
S0427	i be very please with what he's do
S0426	mm
S0427	erm yeah
S0426	well i mean tradespeople like that you grab onto them because you otherwise it's you don't know
S0427	well as i say he he work for next door
S0426	yeah
S0427	and he work with my neighbour next door in their original house and when they move into this one they they have him back
S0426	yeah
S0427	and they show me what he'd do and i just think well i'm not gonna go run around now get
S0426	exactly yes that's
S0427	so i i grab hold of him sometime in may or june and we agree that we would do it in late september early october but
S0426	i imagine he use less upmarket materials because it can get very expensive furnish bathrooms
S0427	oh i could of spend four thousand pound on the bath
S0426	yes yes
S0427	and the tap and goodness know whatever else in fact i didn't choose them i just say just go and get me something functional and basic
S0426	yeah yeah yeah
S0427	but he's get me mixer tap everywhere
S0426	yeah
S0427	and i've get cut off valves whereas before
S0426	mm mm
S0427	i'd have to turn one off from the main thing but now i've get cut off valves on everything toilet bath because they weren't there you see as standard
S0426	be your bath as it be low so you can see and get underneath it
S0427	no it's get a it's get a slide it's get a
S0426	you can take it off easy
S0427	you can take that off easily it's just a couple of screw
S0426	right well that's already an improvement on on mine where i start to see a leak or not a leak i start to see water damage
S0427	yeah
S0426	at the base of the outside wall on the bathroom and i think what the hell's go on i just couldn't figure it out in my mind at all cos it be nowhere near the the shower end it be the
S0427	mm
S0426	if you like the the head end of the bath on the outside you know the corridor wall inside my inside the flat and i get it into my head that it be leak from the bottom of the bath
S0427	right
S0426	don't know how it could possibly do that there and i think well i'll just take off the side panel of the bath
S0427	yeah
S0426	but the side panel be a mirror or be a mirror
S0427	oh right
S0426	and behind the mirror there be a thin wooden sheet which be put on some extremely tight fit so i have to smash in some er some end of it and to pull it all out i look underneath the bath and it be completely dry
S0427	that be strange
S0426	very strange just
S0427	so you didn't find out why this
S0426	no i call a plumber in and he scratch his head and he say well in fact it's nothing to do with the under side of the bath the problem be in the tap the head of the bath
S0427	mm
S0426	and the water be somehow find its way all along the rim of the bath and go down and stain the bottom of the so
S0427	oh right
S0426	he have to put the er yeah he fix it easily enough he just change the the er tap and the head of the tap
S0427	yeah right
S0426	and then put the erm the wooden bite back on i i ask him kindly if he would put the mirror back on and he demur and he say well we don't really touch mirror and i say well look you know
S0427	mm
S0426	give me a hand and we'll be alright so he very kindly do put it
S0427	right okay
S0426	against the er the side of the bath
S0427	yeah
S0426	but then it be leave to me to
S0427	to to screw that on
S0426	to then screw it on but screw glass
S0427	mm that can shatter
S0426	yeah
S0427	well er with erm when he come he say to me he say my brother and his mate put the electric shower in and they run the cold water off the electric shower by a series of pip come off the cold water fee but it look neat but they they're expose
S0426	yeah yeah
S0427	so it be like the pompidou centre or
S0426	right
S0427	and erm just say er see i i if you want me to put in an electric shower i would bring in an electrician to check it
S0426	mm
S0427	but since it's in there i can do all of this do you want me to hide it all and so it's get dig into the wall and then he put the tile
S0426	much better
S0427	over it
S0426	much better
S0427	it isn't a problem he he he do
S0426	sure
S0427	all the electrics and all the rest of it erm and then at one point i say to him oh that lamp you know it's one of those awful sort of lamps and think oh with something more modern and he say go go to b and q you know i will put it in for you you know
S0426	yeah
S0427	erm i could of do it myself but erm you know why bother when you have get someone who really know his stuff
S0426	no no absolutely not
S0427	so he's change two light for me he have do electrical work the gate he buy for the thing erm it be a bite of a squeeze you know
S0426	mm
S0427	whereas he get his plane out and
S0426	yes yes yes yes yes
S0427	wonderful thing you know and he's just a little bite more just a little bite more
S0426	that's right that's right
S0427	and he even tell me about the best way to put the preservative on it he say half and half he say turpentine
S0426	mm
S0427	and you know things and let it soak into it cos you see so many gate cover in this beautiful brown thing and it start to peel you know
S0426	right yes yes yes right nothing behind it
S0427	hasn't be able to sink in whatever well if you think
S0426	right right right okay
S0427	bloody hell i didn't know about that you know
S0426	i know i know
S0427	so that's what i do over the weekend you know a sort of a a wash and then
S0426	yes it's the kind of thing which lay people could do
S0427	yes exactly yeah yeah
S0426	they get the brush out and dab some stuff all over a piece of wood we can do that we can't plane
S0427	yeah that's right yeah we could do that
S0426	at least i could not plane
S0427	well i don't know i don't even have a plane so
S0426	probably exactly and plan be probably much more subtle and difficult than it might be
S0427	yeah exactly so erm and he be say the tile you know suddenly he say can you come up and he say do you know it look like it's ninety degree angle but it's not
S0426	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0427	so you know i think it be better if we start here and when you come in the eye will see everything geometric and we can hide the the fact that
S0426	square yeah yes yes yes
S0427	it won't be go like that it'll be go like this down there yeah that's fine you know
S0426	yeah right again people like us will just start from the bottom
S0427	yeah that's right
S0426	work upwards and discover that it's completely skew whiff at the top
S0427	and the other thing too of course be he completely tile the whole floor and then the stand for the wash basin and the actual toilet itself
S0426	mm
S0427	sit on it he do not have to cut around it you see
S0426	oh right
S0427	it sit on the tile and then you get that clear view sealant all the way round the bottom of it
S0426	right because of course the pip don't go through the tile the pip go through the wall okay
S0427	yeah at the back yeah
S0426	okay yeah yeah yeah
S0427	they're at the back so i mean the the where the affront go out he have have to cut round that
S0426	yes that be right
S0427	but that's largely hide by the toilet anyway
S0426	that's good
S0427	mm
S0426	you could also apparently get these days get very thin erm what be it call the the actual tank of the toilet
S0427	yeah yeah er low flush or small
S0426	exactly someone who get
S0427	erm i think i have certainly downstairs because he be say that he have to baton on the wall because it would not fit on the wall cos it's different
S0426	mm
S0427	the one i have be so much
S0426	yeah
S0427	bulkier and of course you can't just stick it on the wall because it's get to fit over the toilet
S0426	right
S0427	you know so he's have to put a baton on it but that isn't a that be the problem so it stand about that far off the wall but by the time you've paint that baton the same colour as the wall it's just get
S0426	you won't see it no exactly absolutely that's right
S0427	i mean downstairs if you if i show you downstairs you'd see well you can see bare patch where the tiling's be alter and and some little case that have to be fracture to get things out which have not be repair that's up to me to do that right well all i've do be put a er you know build an ornament over it
S0426	oh right okay
S0427	but you go upstairs
S0426	yeah and that that's more fully do right
S0427	you go upstairs and you might even think the upstairs have be decorate
S0426	mm
S0427	although it hasn't just at that the tile
S0426	be put in mm
S0427	fit in more exactly with the old tile if you see what i mean erm but as i say you you're you're welcome to come along and if you want
S0426	very good
S0427	but erm
S0426	another er embellishment which i be offer which hadn't occur to me i do not know that things exist be a slow drop toilet seat
S0427	i've get two of those
S0426	you be live in the upmarket toilet world i can see
S0427	it be really bore though because
S0427	they don't just go
S0426	no
S0427	they just go
S0426	okay
S0427	and you think oh life's too short
S0426	life's too short
S0427	you come back five minute's later oh yeah it's down it's really that bad you know
S0426	erm can they be in emergencies override if you see what i mean
S0427	oh i see what i yes you can i think you can actually press the
S0426	okay right right
S0427	yes i take your point
S0426	very embarrass
S0427	that could that could be awkward yeah
S0427	you can press them down that be true yep
S0426	yes without fracture of
S0427	but i mean they be not expensive i mean as i say
S0426	okay
S0427	if you think of all the sanitary wear and size and everything it be nine hundred and something nine hundred and sixty nine hundred and seventy pound or something like that
S0426	well you could as i be say you could spend thousands of pound
S0427	yeah
S0426	in the kind of er bathrooms you see in country life you know and those sort of er
S0427	yeah yeah but you've gotta have the you need the space for that too you know i mean it's the same with the kitchens you know i be talk about do i say do you do kitchens you know and he say yeah you know so what i do be i go to b and q and he say oh no don't go to b and q he say go to houghton's i say well that be
S0426	yes that be right
S0427	and he say well you've never hear of houghton's probably he say because they don't deal with the public they only deal with people like me
S0426	that be right that's right that's right
S0427	and i say well how be i go to get it then and he say well you tell them that you're work through me and then they'll sell it to you so i think so they sell it to me at wholesale he say yes great
S0427	who get to design it he say they'll come and design it for free
S0426	oh
S0427	they'll come to your house and design for free cos they know that
S0426	oh that's interest yeah they will buy sell that stuff
S0427	he say don't worry i cos i deal with them all the time he say so i think great he say but but if you be think of do this next year get them to come over and design it to your satisfaction
S0426	yeah yeah
S0427	and get a price and show me the plan so that i can it you know it's feasible obviously and tell them you be not buy it until the sale and they have one sale a year and it's in october
S0426	very good very true
S0427	but it be like he say if you want marble worktops
S0426	yeah yeah sure sure sure sure
S0427	there's ten thousand pound already
S0426	yeah sure sure sure
S0427	so i shall be
S0426	i'm sure they're very nice
S0427	i'm sure they be but i have get ones that look like marble
S0426	well the thing about the ones that look like marble be they don't act like marble as i learn to my cost the other day
S0427	no no
S0426	when i put down a too hot pan
S0427	ah
S0426	and of course it blister so
S0427	well of course you chefs chefs du jour who do that kind of thing erm
S0426	but it wasn't a flambé with the flame rise out of it
S0427	ah no but in my case it's bring something out of the oven with oven gloves and you know yeah i see what you mean
S0426	there's there's
S0427	yeah i know what you mean about
S0426	exactly what what er the builder who we get for my mum who be very please with him say look don't go to b and q or wilks or whatever they're call er wicks wicks
S0427	wicks yeah
S0426	because a they're they're not very good and b they be expensive
S0427	that be right
S0426	so he take me to this place which of course in some out of the way industrial estate somewhere
S0427	that be right it be the same in it be tuck away down the off off the
S0426	it's not like b and q which have to be accessible and visible to the public
S0427	no no no but you can go and visit their store and they will come out to you
S0426	sure ah that's i hadn't know that that's interest
S0427	well they'll they'll come out and do the design apparently they'll come out and measure it because you you'd be mad to measure it yourself
S0426	oh god yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0427	you know because if you're out by that much you know
S0426	yeah by by a an inch the whole thing imagine fit an appliance in a space which be too small for it
S0427	yeah yeah but in but in his case you see i've say to him i want the floor to go i want all the tile do in in the kitchen and probably while i'm at it i might want a few sockets move around to make
S0426	sure while you're do it do everything
S0427	so he be go to do it all
S0426	absolutely that's right
S0427	and apparently they also supply the erm appliances er if you want to buy them from houghton's er erm
S0426	there's no need because appliances can be get anywhere they're all of a standard size
S0427	yeah that that well that's true you can but i mean what i'm say be he will fit it
S0426	yes sure he'll fit it that's right
S0427	nowadays with gas things it be just a case of uncouple the thing and
S0426	yes that's right
S0427	erm
S0426	but your my memory of your kitchen wasn't it be perfectly alright
S0427	no it be perfectly alright but again it's
S0426	of the er of the era yes alright
S0427	and i think it it's more modern i mean this kitchen's probably only about er ten or eleven years old but you see the appliances look sad and tire and i don't want one where i've gotta bend down to open the you know the oven anymore i want i want an oven at at eyesight level and i want a hob that's at the same level as the work space
S0426	what you're describe if i may say this be what you call
S0427	don't be too insult
S0426	these days a first world problem
S0427	well i mean think south wales be probably
S0427	one and half
S0427	we're not quite third world we we're certainly not third world
S0426	alright it's aspirational that's right
S0427	you know the the work class boy be still in there you know
S0426	oh yes oh i'd like a hot tap
S0427	yes well we never use to have one actually yeah actually that's er you've put me in my place now you you've sham me
S0426	that's right but there be such things apparently and allegedly which be boil water tap
S0427	i don't think i will have one of those no i i've get a dishwasher
S0426	it's mean for people who cannot be bother to wait for the kettle to boil
S0427	i can wait for the kettle to boil yeah
S0426	you can okay that be something you've learn over over the years
S0427	yeah i can i don't use my
S0426	you've get delay gratification
S0427	i don't use my kettle that often
S0427	except when i've get workman in and then i have to find the sugar as well you know
S0426	right okay yes yes that's right
S0427	in a tupperware box hide somewhere in the back of one of the one of the cupboards
S0426	yes that's exactly right yes non sugar households have only get cub usually
S0427	yeah yeah that's right yeah
S0426	and they're somewhere inaccessible you know you put them away somewhere
S0427	then you think can sugar go off do it go off no no it do not have a shelf life
S0426	be it green no it's probably alright
S0427	a bite yellow but it'll be fine
S0426	yellow be fine
S0427	yellow be fine well a green be dangerous
S0426	yeah yeah certainly
S0427	yes
S0426	okay well i shall very kindly
S0427	i be very please
S0426	i'll take up your very kind offer if i may at some point
S0427	not at all you're more than welcome more than welcome
S0426	good excellent
S0427	erm and of course i mean if you if you strip out some of his labour and some of the other cost i i i don't know if i could do that guest bathroom cost considerably less than four thousand pound
S0426	i mean what do you buy as the package i'm
S0427	yeah
S0426	i'm exactly in your position i don't want to engage with it all other than say i'd like it to look like this
S0427	mm
S0426	arrange it so let it be so
S0427	well i be shock when you show me cos you have that 3d view
S0426	yes yes
S0427	and i think your place be a similar size to mine and i think when you say it be eight thousand something or other and i be begin to wonder well yeah even if you have it tile from top to bottom that's not eight thousand pound
S0426	no it it's it's the price of the not the appliances the furniture
S0427	yeah
S0426	er and the materials out of which they're make
S0427	right okay
S0426	er the tile be extremely expensive they look lovely but then
S0427	yeah
S0426	that's because they be coroda marble or whatever it might be
S0427	well yeah yeah i know but it's like anything else i go to topps tile you know
S0427	cos i i you know to to choose something and i be bewilder by their choice
S0426	the choice
S0427	and in the end i just think black i just go for black with kind of an unevenness on it you know so
S0426	right er and you could have go up down leave right in term of price
S0427	oh i could still be there now
S0426	yeah yeah
S0427	and i i think this i'm not even gonna use this you know i mean i just want something presentable for guests
S0426	yes right okay yeah
S0427	it's black and then i think i could save myself some money it'll be black downstairs in the little toilet
S0426	as well that's right the same ones right
S0427	the stairs as well yeah
S0426	yes be only one piece of the jigsaw you could save a bite of money
S0427	mm
S0426	or you can not save a bite of money but if you
S0427	yeah
S0426	have it all at the cheapest rate it'll look cheap on the other hand if you have all at the expensive rate it will be astronomic
S0427	yeah yeah and i mean i i'd say what what he's do especially in the guest bathroom upstairs it just doesn't look it just look really very modern very functional i put up a few african things in there you know
S0426	fine that's all you want
S0427	you know erm it's the kind of thing where if somebody say yeah you can use that wall there you wouldn't worry about it
S0426	yes you wouldn't feel embarrass by yes that's right yes
S0427	and i'm think mm should of clean behind the tap or something like that
S0426	yes yes that's right yes
S0427	so yeah i'm very please with him what he's do anyway
S0426	good good good that's good to know

S0426	absolutely right if he get somebody to do the legwork he's very he's assiduous about update that
S0427	well no i agree but you know i be go to say differential equations but you know he he doesn't change very much you know er
S0426	no no er i think he's update
S0427	i think you come up with new examples possibly or
S0426	sure sure sure sure sure
S0427	or some new study show
S0426	yes
S0427	be good about it and this be a flaw in it but
S0426	true true true
S0427	but you know you know the various test square and all the rest of it they they stay the same you know i i
S0426	no but his if it if it's the one i'm think of of since have get a lot more substandard stuff in it so he need to update the research
S0427	yeah yeah i no i think that's one of the reason why it sell so much
S0426	yes
S0427	it's get not just the you know the statistical techniques but
S0426	yes sure
S0427	apply in the real world you know that's what make it such a good book i mean it seem to be on every methodologically read list i've ever come across you know lucky devil
S0426	well talk of differential equations there be a story in the guardian yesterday
S0427	yeah
S0426	er an obituary about a a mathematician
S0427	mm
S0426	who'd write the text book on calculus
S0427	oh
S0426	and you think well sell a few thousand i suppose he sell five hundred thousand a year
S0427	good god all round the world i take it
S0426	all round the world and he be a multi millionaire
