S0179	huh
S0058	so yeah so they're um put a new bus service the x4 um twenty five minutes from to and 's significantly further than yeah and they're gonna cut all the site stuff out of the normal um citi 4 route which be really good news cos that's gonna really speed up the morning
S0179	oh great so basically it's just gonna give you a lot more time in the day
S0058	yeah basically it's just
S0179	oh god
S0058	yeah look at him he's gonna put anyone off drug addiction isn't he surely
S0179	one would've assume
S0058	oh be it fair to compare yeah oh there's um some personal train there do a nice stretch slash personal personal trainer get cosy
S0179	yeah
S0058	it's a problem
S0179	okay so there's two interest article here one be that comparison
S0179	cup's
S0058	oo here we be ah yes indeed so the bookshop yeah it's the oldest bookselling site in britain we haven't be there all that time but it's be a bookshop since at least fifteen eighty one that's really cool mm no it's a it's a lovely shop
S0179	yeah
S0058	oh that's interest yeah there be a lot of um oh indeed another english er english fellow there be he an english student do it tell you
S0179	er i think he be yes
S0058	that would explain why there be so many english fellows come out
S0179	to be fair it wasn't the best thing to do in the world
S0058	no
S0179	it wasn't hugely appropriate
S0058	no no i don't think it be i don't think it be a very clever way of participate in a
S0179	well this be the thing that's fuck me off so it it's sort of punish for be thoughtful principled talented and brave also be a bite of an arse
S0058	well yeah i mean er
S0179	i think er i think he should
S0058	er i guess put your hand up and argue be a better
S0179	i think i i don't think it's entirely unreasonable that they be punish for that
S0058	yeah
S0179	um but
S0058	but that seem
S0179	possibly not to that degree
S0058	exactly i mean no pun intend that seem a bite extreme
S0179	well it depend er you know if you know someone have organize something and you turn up to it it's not then up to you to dictate how that go
S0058	no no entirely
S0179	hence the point um er
S0058	mm
S0179	the students of like slave in ancient greece probably not
S0058	what cos they're not allow to speak out be that the the idea
S0179	er yes except i don't think that's i mean the the university have do some interest things in its
S0179	sort of last year or two of history that's not the most and to be fair that wasn't actually the university that be an external er
S0058	it be what sorry
S0179	that be an external court proceed um er
S0058	mm
S0179	mm
S0058	yeah
S0179	dr the senior proctor who first report holland as the ring leader call defenders apologists
S0058	what apologists for the
S0179	yes they could not charge the other protestors cos they do not know enough name wreck seminars be wrong
S0058	yeah i mean to a certain extent yeah because then he didn't speak he didn't continue to speak which in stop someone from speak isn't the best way of
S0179	er er er well
S0058	kind of
S0179	he he say holland deny many people the right to engage with the minister yeah exactly if someone's be stupid
S0058	mm
S0179	you show them up for their stupidity through reason
S0058	yeah
S0179	intellectual discussion
S0058	that's what i mean like it's not the best way of prove that you're kind of yeah
S0179	i mean the problem be that's essentially what the government be do um be basically deny the students a forum but
S0058	yeah
S0179	er but locally in that instance
S0058	yes
S0179	that wasn't the problem huh um yeah anyway so where's this er fresh from be dub third best in the world third excuse me
S0058	mm what's third
S0179	apparently
S0058	what third best in the world well it depend on what
S0179	hm
S0058	league table you're look at because um 's sometimes top
S0179	er
S0058	and mit's sometimes top depend on what metric you're use
S0179	mit's virtually never top
S0058	be it not
S0179	it's often second but
S0058	so there's no there's normally three isn't there
S0179	fff
S0058	ah oxford how could i forget
S0179	well lse's above oxford
S0058	what what what er what league table be this
S0179	complete oh right i think it's the time one
S0058	yeah
S0179	they're say it's a bite like compare manchester unite to
S0058	well quite exactly there's nothing wrong with
S0179	fff
S0058	just don't put them play against each other because it's gonna be bore it's far more interest to go and watch play
S0179	mm
S0058	and watch man u play chelsea like don't you know they're good for different things
S0179	er yeah
S0058	you won't pay nine thousand
S0179	oh this be interest
S0058	pound for a season ticket for
S0179	hang on just er shh six thousand academic staff eighteen and a half thousand students
S0058	what at
S0179	er ah use to be the school of school of art
S0058	oh right interest
S0179	in eighteen fifty eight

S0179	it be a polytechnic in eighty nine didn't achieve university status in till ninety two
S0058	mm
S0179	thirty thousand students actually but
S0058	how many be
S0179	less than a thousand academic staff that's a contrast ratio
S0058	wow that be interest
S0179	so it's get six time fewer staff nearly twice the students
S0058	that's really interest actually yeah well they do say like that's the point of that you get really kind of what do you count as academic staff though do you not do you count sort of postdoc
S0179	yes
S0058	so research and
S0179	any any non degree
S0058	yeah any this be nearly ready actually um be you free to go in a minute
S0179	oh dear
S0179	the head of anglia ruskin
S0058	i'll turn this off
S0179	when ask to explain the difference in place i point out that the government research fund come to a hundredth of that of yeah cos you're shit
S0179	it's just not a comparison one be better than the other
S0058	well exactly that's that's why the football thing's true it's like yeah you i mean there's nothing wrong with anglia ruskin it do very different things yeah i mean even just student to staff ratio that's gonna be one of the things they use for the table
S0058	that's just a fact
S0179	yeah
S0058	and you can't that's not make a a judgement that's just say there's more staff like
S0179	mm
S0058	not fiddle the er
S0179	change come into play on the tenth of june
S0058	mm yeah it's really soon i be wonder if it be gonna be like two thousand and fifteen so that's quite excite er i mean i'm not in i haven't sort of thoroughly read it um like where er cos it depend where it's gonna stop of course because if er that would mean if it only basically
S0179	er no if people in walk to the centre and get the express then continue to get the citi 4 cos it go round the estates
S0058	i presume by that they mean walk to the centre of
S0179	mm
S0058	as in it's not gonna go round by estates i be assume it mean lower upper and
S0179	well or they might actually
S0058	but
S0179	extend the citi 4 round here
S0058	i don't think it'd do that until it's completely all this lot be finish because i don't know i mean it would be nice and if it be you know
