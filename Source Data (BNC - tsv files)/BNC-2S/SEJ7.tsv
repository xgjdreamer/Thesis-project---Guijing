S0324	so one time
S0325	one time erm she turn around and the same thing as normal laugh and and she's just i don't know what it be she just change and cry and us lie on the table and i be absolutely die i do that somewhere else as well one of the teachers
S0324	maybe it be mrs 's class
S0325	make me laugh always laugh
S0324	mrs be really funny
S0325	yeah she's really funny
S0324	in a good way funny though like laugh at her
S0325	laugh at other certain teachers
S0324	yes erm butter where's my be this my juice
S0325	uh huh
S0324	where do i put my juice
S0325	it's there
S0324	there it be
S0325	we're go to get so many different teachers next year cos
S0324	yeah
S0325	cos for science you never have three teachers it scar me how like twelve lessons of science
S0324	yeah
S0325	that's gonna be
S0324	ridiculous
S0325	that's more than maths or english
S0324	yeah but basically the whole timetable be just science but still want to do triple science
S0325	what if you don't do triple science you still have to do that much science
S0324	yeah you still have to
S0325	but with one teacher
S0324	oh yeah
S0325	nightmare
S0324	yeah
S0325	but what you go to choose do we do you know if we're get any triple science option then
S0324	no i don't think so it have to be one of your options i think but i'm not sure but i think so
S0325	i wish it wasn't
S0324	yeah but then in a way it's good because we get more time for science so we have more time to get a better grade
S0325	but i really want to take art
S0324	yeah well art be my number two option my first one be triple science
S0325	uh huh
S0324	then after then then
S0325	french
S0324	oh yeah french or spanish i'm think spanish
S0325	spanish
S0324	but
S0325	but because only general french be a bite more of a common language to
S0324	yeah but then when you think about it spanish be a more widely speak language as in countries
S0325	yeah
S0324	it's just that lot of people learn french so when you go to south america and stuff they will speak spanish
S0325	but
S0324	only france will some other place do as well but only france speak french and then there's just more people know how to speak french so i don't know
S0325	but you guess you have a job and they need you to do speak a language french would probably
S0324	yeah i guess
S0325	and what be you go to take last music or
S0324	well i'm go i do want to take music um yeah
S0325	be you go to take a
S0324	yeah i probably won't if i do i'd take geography
S0325	what would you take instead of music and if you didn't take humanities
S0324	then i would take music if i do take humanities cos there's nothing else i'd really want to do
S0325	compute
S0324	yep re
S0325	re
S0324	philosophy no philosophy and ethics
S0325	oh it's really awkward cos like what be you take and i be like i don't know and she be like be you take philosophy and ethics and i be like no i just like oh i be and i be like oh oh right okay
S0324	like how you've already finish your toast and i'm still spread
S0325	i think cos you be trace your
S0324	my little
S0325	good luck try to carve that one
S0324	yeah and this one like flush shock face pain
S0325	i think that i'm gonna take history but i'm not very good at history
S0324	yeah you be
S0325	i don't even like history
S0324	well then why do you want to take it
S0325	i don't like geography either i like history because i like mrs and i like miss
S0324	well if you take history you take someone else
S0325	well she's go to be go by the time we take our options anyway
S0324	yeah but then she'll come back
S0325	she's not come back
S0324	i think she say she be come back
S0325	i don't think so i think she's go to have the baby over christmas
S0324	yeah
S0325	she say she'd come back for like a day to show the new person around and then probably that be it so i think she's leave but i like miss
S0324	yeah i like miss as well
S0325	but i don't know i'm not i'm really not brilliant at history and i don't i don't really like history or geography i mean i like them but not really
S0324	do you want to take both of them
S0325	well i be go to but now i think i'll take music instead
S0324	instead of which one
S0325	one of them probably geography
S0324	well would music be higher in your preferences than art
S0325	not go to take art
S0324	oh okay
S0325	because i can't take a humanities if i take art if i take human science with language humanities music
S0324	oh yeah
S0325	art unless i take art instead of music but i think i'd prefer to take music
S0324	yeah well you can still do art like
S0325	yeah
S0324	go at lunch
S0325	after school and stuff
S0324	and you can do arts award if you ever get round to it
S0325	get round to it i start it before the summer holiday
S0324	yeah
S0325	do about three page and then give up
S0324	i keep mean to do it
S0325	mm mm
S0324	but i never get round to it
S0325	i'm really worry that the end of year nine i'm not go to be able to get the level you need to take top set take triple science
S0324	do you have to take a
S0325	oh yeah but it's
S0324	don't you remember miss and miss talk about it like a six b or something you'll pass that
S0325	some level if i do really bad in my test but this one i don't understand anything tell me it's really easy
S0324	you do understand that
S0325	apparently it's the same one maybe i'll just when be it thursday
S0324	uh huh
S0325	i'll get to help me tomorrow
S0324	get science and maths test on thursday
S0325	well at least you know what it's like now just remember on the last question you won't get unknown you'll probably be fine
S0324	what happen on the last question
S0325	last question i think i be an idiot cos it even have an angle that say forty degrees i think that it be i don't know radius meet
S0324	so it doesn't need a tangent thing
S0325	well it say why do it not need why do this not be a tangent and i write radius meet tangent ant ninety degrees actually the radius i have to prove that the radius doesn't mean a tangent at ninety degrees and then i cross it out i don't know i'm rubbish in test but um there be people talk and like and mr get really angry he be like how it's like test condition i'm not impress that people be talk
S0324	that be true though shouldn't be talk
S0325	i wasn't talk our table's like the good table apart from who get send out because well he didn't get send out but he hasn't be do his home work properly and so mr take him out and like have a word with him because his homework standard wasn't high enough i don't know he just have to redo it
S0324	what be you no what be you go to say
S0325	can't remember no i be go to say don't know what i be go to say
S0324	i be go to say what be you do in maths now
S0325	i don't know cos we do the test today
S0324	do he not tell you what you be go to do or something
S0325	no which be great we're probably do something really hard like algebra actually i don't mind algebra
S0324	i don't mind algebra
S0325	that's cos you're clever i don't like do the um well i like do the balance the equations in algebra i do them i remember i be so proud of myself miss give us one and i would be do before and you'd be like and then mr be like surprisingly and i be like okay thank you and then and then that elephants project
S0324	oh yeah
S0325	even though i try really hard on that and the level wasn't really and i be like yeah i get a level eight and be like oh it's not really everyone get a level eight and i be like oh right thank

S0324	yeah you be get really annoy i be try to give him another chance and you be like no we're play without him
S0325	otherwise you just go come on you have to be quiet before i go
S0324	because he be go
S0325	stop again or whatever he be say right start again and i be like right guy play without him
S0324	cos then he be like oh i won't worry about if you're quiet or not and you be like no too late too late
S0325	play a game yeah no say she really didn't like the hunger game
S0324	the what
S0325	the hunger game be like the book and the film worst things i've ever see in my whole life and i be like oh right and she be like divergent be so much better but divergent the film well in my opinion cos i don't think shailene woodley and theo jam weren't the right people especially as what's his name the guy that play augustus water
S0324	erm and
S0325	ansor elgort he's her brother in that
S0324	oh yeah
S0325	and that's just weird i don't know it's it wasn't the best film her act wasn't very good but the mockingjay be really really good
S0324	when do you see it
S0325	on saturday the guy that play gale i think he's the best actor he's really good actually they're all really good probably why they're all famous actors
S0324	yeah because they're good
S0325	it be like a well think out film i still need to find the last divergent book
S0324	oh yeah
S0325	that would be really really want to read but i haven't be able to get it so i'll order that on amazon
S0324	yeah divergent and the hunger game be very similar though think about it cos they're both like
S0325	especially like at the start the start of the hunger game her mum be do her hair
S0324	yeah that's true
S0325	and the start of divergent her mum be cut her hair in front of the mirror
S0324	and it's all just all very similar cos it's like a female hero who heroine and it's action and the first be like it's
S0325	like a sort ceremony from harry potter
S0324	yeah it's like
S0325	which house will you be place in
S0324	and it's like erm action but then as the book go on they get more bigger and more political and stuff
S0325	yeah
S0324	like the hunger game and like divergent as well
S0325	you will find out well i've read most of the first book but i need to finish it see if you know how it get bigger
S0324	it start like hunger game start with she's just a girl in the hunger game and then it get more to her be face of a revolution and stuff more political
S0325	really excite mockingjay part two be go to come out but that's go to be absolutely age
S0324	yeah that's go to be really annoy i i i yeah i have to say i'm annoy that they do it in two part
S0325	yeah
S0324	cos it's really annoy when people do film in two part
S0325	i know
S0324	the deathly hallow i can understand cos it be a big book and there's a lot of stuff that happen in deathly hallow but mockingbird they could have get that in one film i think
S0325	they would of but they think i just want more money so
S0324	yeah it really annoy me
S0325	like it be only about two hours but they could of cut out some of it and stuff it all in one i'm pretty sure the next one won't be so long
S0324	yeah
S0325	but it be really scary erm at the end like kat and st peter look really scary cos peter have this really hollow oh i didn't like it you have to see it have you see it
S0324	no probably go and see it once the dvd's out
S0325	yeah i'll have to get the dvd
S0324	i've get the second one i'm not sure
S0325	cos i get it for you erm so i need to get that
S0324	i think what we might do be wait for mockingjay part two to come out
S0325	oh yeah
S0324	then we can watch both of them
S0325	cos then you can enjoy and just move onto the next one
S0324	or like watch one one even and then the next one the next even and then don't get too annoy that it's two
S0325	i'm not sure i want to watch the next divergent film when it come up i'm gonna watch it but even though the first one wasn't that good
S0324	yeah
S0325	and like erm tris and erm what's his name four aren't like i don't know they're not how i picture them in the book
S0324	yeah especially four
S0325	yeah
S0324	like he's not right i know it say in the book that he have short shave hair but i'd expect it to like become a bite longer or something and to be like dark sort of browny the actor be just not
S0325	their relationship in the book and in the film be really different in the film they sort of act like they're best friends in the book they're not it's really different and tris in the book have blonde hair like really proper blonde hair and tris in the film have brown hair and christina she's not how i'd picture her have you see her
S0324	mm don't think so
S0325	she do not look anything like how i'd picture her or al or whip or none of them it's like erm must have i don't know
S0324	i be a film i'm really look forward to it pigtails
S0325	yeah
S0324	i can't wait for pigtails to come out
S0325	really excite for that
S0324	come out i think they'll do a good job of that cos john green go and make sure they're do a good job i mean the forty nine star be really good
S0325	it be good
S0324	and yeah
S0325	i can imagine
S0324	i actually prefer paper tail as a book to the forty nine star ish
S0325	well they be quite different
S0324	yeah
S0325	know but i like both but i don't really like the abundance of catherine
S0324	i'm read that
S0325	i've only read like two page but i can't get into that's why cos i don't i get up to the bite i can't remember where i get up to i haven't read it for such a long time i've run out of book to read
S0324	i um i do kind of like it i haven't finish it yet so i'm not sure if i'm but i kind of like it
S0325	sure if i will
S0324	but i kind of like it
S0325	okay
S0324	i yeah i like john green book
S0325	i really once i've finish divergent which i really need to finish
S0324	what
S0325	get them for christmas but then from myself
S0324	oh
S0325	i don't know but they be really expensive book shop so i want to get it off amazon
S0324	yeah
S0325	maybe i'll ask my dad to order it the last one but then i also want the second one cos i like the more paper copy
S0324	oh yeah
S0325	my nan's still get all my hunger game book
S0324	why
S0325	i lend them to her but she hasn't read them yet
S0324	so she just
