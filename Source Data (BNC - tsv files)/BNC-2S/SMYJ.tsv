S0326	er yeah i mean the one thing be that i've actually already submit what i be gonna do
S0329	oh
S0326	cos you have to and i think that be like there's no real way they can force me to do them i reckon
S0329	no of course not
S0326	erm
S0329	so you submit what
S0326	well that so well what i submit be
S0329	i can't believe you're in your final year next year
S0326	two literature paper erm
S0329	what do you do in those literature paper
S0326	well the options aren't that good that's the thing for the literature erm i choose the odyssey which be the it's just about the odyssey
S0329	how fantastic
S0326	er and the metamorphose
S0329	how fantastic
S0326	by ovid
S0329	what's sort what sort of write
S0326	cos they're very they're very sort of like they're things i already know vaguely a little bite about that's all
S0329	well you mean that's why you choose them or that's why they're bore
S0326	well they're i mean they're not bore obviously but they're not erm
S0329	i just think to do
S0326	yeah yeah
S0329	an in depth paper
S0326	and to read the whole thing in
S0329	will just be fantastic
S0326	and then the other thing i pick be a be a thesis
S0329	so that you select your own
S0326	yeah
S0329	and just write a long paper how long be it
S0326	ten thousand
S0329	really as many as ten thousand
S0326	yeah
S0329	i well i think you'll definitely get a lot out of that
S0326	yeah so do i but i don't know what the fuck to do one on
S0329	why don't you do
S0326	see that's the problem er but
S0329	why don't you do
S0326	but
S0329	jam why don't you do ulysses and ulysses or be that always be that a common one
S0326	no but but that's too much overlap of my other paper if you see what i'm say
S0329	yeah
S0326	erm
S0329	but presumably somebody tutor you for that
S0326	yeah
S0329	you know
S0329	so you
S0326	yeah you do
S0329	you
S0326	and you've get
S0329	discuss with
S0326	before you get a tutor
S0329	with goldilocks
S0326	though you pick something anyway but the problem be that those options i mean i don't do any philosophy
S0329	those what
S0326	if i do those options
S0329	yeah
S0326	mean i don't do philosophy
S0329	what oh how do you feel about that
S0326	well i would i think i would like to do it so they're not what i think be that i would do a dissertation about plato but that's really fuck hard on the one hand
S0329	what and dissertation be not the same as thesis
S0326	i mean it er yeah it's the same thing but then i think i would do one
S0329	oh that be quite a good idea
S0326	then i think i would do one about mm sort of plato but take it from a literature
S0329	well if you've get
S0326	point of view
S0329	ten thousand word you have get quite a lot of
S0326	so i could so something like erm
S0329	i think you should do that i think it's a
S0326	well i have this one idea about katabasis which be go into the underworld and er in literature in greek literature and philosophy
S0329	so glad you do this subject isn't it so fantastic
S0326	yeah but but then what i be think the other day be that i'll just do the plato module and and do a and drop either the odyssey or the metamorphose
S0329	right
S0326	and do a do do a thesis about the more about literature er
S0329	oh i see that be quite fine tune of
S0326	cos the thing about
S0329	i think well look er but it's it's individual and you probably you're just gonna have to live with think it through for for the summer
S0326	but the but the problem be
S0329	but
S0326	i need to start work now
S0329	yeah but it doesn't it it doesn't what you're decide what you're think about be all interconnect so you'll be do the work anyway and do the work will help you do the read will help you erm reach a decision will help you develop your ideas you can't you won't have any ideas just you know star into space it come from things fire off each other erm i do a thesis for my finals and i do it on a philosophical subject and erm and i really i think that if you're go to do a long essay like that it's actually a philosophical subject be better than a pure literary subject i couldn't have write ten thousand word on a
S0326	yeah but the one
S0329	pure literary subject
S0326	the thing be i have an ideas for literature be about quite about sort of you know that poet cavafy
S0326	cavafy
S0326	cavafy or that's the
S0329	yeah
S0326	yeah and like his of greek literature i don't i really don't know that much about him i just think he sound cool
S0329	erm yeah and i saw you've be read mendelsohn's translations new translations you need to go to america and you need to meet my friend i think you have meet him briefly and you need to get him to introduce you to daniel mendelsohn erm
S0326	so then that's the thing so if i do a philosophy paper i would i don't really wanna drop the metamorphose cos then i wouldn't do any latin
S0329	no i think you're too literary i think you'd have to do
S0326	and also my teacher who i really like be the course director of that at and i he's think he's i think he's really good
S0329	yeah so okay so those decisions be firm and the it's just a you be just work i don't understand
S0326	so basically what i'm definitely go to do be the metamorphose the the be human and then
S0329	be human as in
S0326	that's the x paper
S0329	right
S0326	and then either either a thesis and odyssey
S0329	thesis
S0326	and odyssey or a thesis and plato
S0329	thesis and odyssey well you can't make your you're not gonna make your mind up by the time you come back today it's just those this be what you're think about over the summer that's the way it that's what you have to look and how you have to think about it and what have you say that you're do
S0326	erm metamorphose odyssey be human and thesis with you have a backup cos apparent quite often people will set out to do a thesis and there's no argument there so they have to do an exam so well my fifth option be plato what be your thesis
S0329	on the imagination so i do erm i've still get it somewhere
S0326	let's have a look at that
S0329	i look at it not that long ago well you know in the last ten years couldn't understand a word
S0329	erm yeah so i do it i do how far back do i go erm it be plotinus that's how far back i go theories of the sublime it be plotinus
S0326	i don't really know him you didn't do anyone call pseudo longinus
S0329	er yeah i do i do
S0326	that's as far back i know about the sublime
S0329	yeah i do him plotinus and i don't know about the pseudo
S0326	well that's probably because since you do it he's become dispute
S0329	oh right
S0329	longinus i use to call him longinus plotinus er and i go then i start do er i do a bite of eighteenth century edmund burke theories of the sublime and picturesque and then what be be we do at fifty erm and then the nineteenth century wordsworth and coleridge cos i be just obsess with wordsworth and coleridge that be my big obsession when i be
S0326	yeah
S0329	i can't remember anything about them now erm
S0326	i don't i go through an entire er school without read any wordsworth
S0329	yeah i can i can believe that you know i didn't read any wordsworth at school and it's not very palatable for younger people coleridge and shelley however
S0326	do coleridge
S0329	be excite
S0326	oh man i just er really er be really er indecided undecided
S0329	you really be undecided yeah but the thing be you don't actually have to make up your mind and at the moment and you and you're not in a position to so just do lot of read in the summer
S0326	i know but i mean part of the thing be like if you do the odyssey you're suppose to have read the odyssey by the time you get there
S0329	well you're go read it
S0326	be you no if i i oh i might read some of it but
S0329	read it i'm gonna read i'll read it with you
S0326	in greek
S0329	i've never read it
S0326	well in greek
S0329	well obviously i'm not gonna read it in greek but
S0326	yeah but do you know slow do you know how long it take to read something in greek in
S0329	we should listen to the news actually i wonder what's be happen it be fascinate what's happen in greece
S0326	yeah
S0329	i buy the daily express just because it i dunno the headline about diabetes that's really all think about er wait i'm go where be i go
S0326	you're go to babes
S0329	be it up here oh eleven totally be just dream
S0326	yeah what be i gonna do when i finish
S0329	erm i think you be gonna go to america and do some study there
S0326	i dunno
S0329	have you have any you must be or a
S0326	i think i'd take a gap year
S0329	yeah take a gap year
S0326	what would i do during that
S0329	yeah you're gonna have to earn some money that's for sure i mean that's the real thing what the fuck do you do for money how be you gonna get any
S0326	i don't need very much though
S0329	erm
S0326	tutor latin or something like that
S0329	well
S0326	i dunno really
S0329	tutor latin well yeah you definitely would be able to do that erm must be this one
S0326	cos i could like i don't know really
S0329	what be you gonna say
S0326	you can do lot of little job and get a bite of money and tutor latin erm make coffee and work in a bar and then do a useful internship somewhere
S0329	yeah
S0326	i don't know about where
S0329	well you could definitely go the be gag for you
S0326	what would that actually involve do
S0329	fuck all
S0329	erm well they have proper pay intern erm you know you would in it's a a very serious it's not like at the where you just write in like and say i work in you know as a cocktail waitress
S0326	yeah
S0329	erm the take it very serious but be well every time i see her she say send to me i want i want to interview him but i mean she would she's a
S0326	what would do they ask you like what what book do you like
S0329	erm they're really really stiff interviewers erm and intern there be i think it's like a year long job or something and erm you know probably get people who er have do more education than you you might be too young you might be not educate enough but it's hard to believe give erm but you know it wouldn't be it it wouldn't be something where you do make coffee in the mornings
S0326	yes
S0329	erm you'd be generally involve in the run of the paper and erm not coffee make you know
S0326	see i a thing i think about do it and that would be to do a do a tefl thing
S0329	oh yeah
S0326	and then actually i can't really speak any other languages
S0329	you can hardly speak english
S0326	and do like three months try to learn sort of three months in germany a few months in france a few months in spain or something
S0329	yeah erm you mean and fund it with your tefl
S0326	yeah
S0329	be you be your relationship with form your thoughts as well be you
S0326	well erm not at not at the moment but 's quite up for not live in like england though
S0329	be she erm well
S0326	maybe i'll see what course they have for that er erm at the sort of
S0329	at the
S0326	er no at the british school of athens or american school of athens and then we could look
S0329	i definitely think you should see what your options be academically and you know you can get all sort of scholarships like a fulbright and that kind of thing er all the all the really clever people i be at with get fulbright scholarships to go and study at yale and
S0326	i'm not that clever though
S0329	well neither be they i think you're perfectly clever enough and anyway you know there be all these scholarships and it would be worth investigate what what sort of what there be erm cos that would be
S0326	but part of the reason part of the reason for erm wait to a year to to apply for this school be that i'll have a long piece of write to send them and i will erm have my result cos i don't think i i'd i'm pretty sure i didn't get a first this year
S0329	well you can this be the kind of thing that you must discuss with your supervisors
S0326	well that's what my supervisor say when i suggest that
S0329	oh
S0326	i want to do that he say that would be a good idea
S0329	oh really
S0326	because of this and this and this
S0329	really
S0326	but he do say to me that i should definitely be think about do the
S0329	yeah i
S0326	and when i mention america he say there's only two good place
S0329	yeah you tell me yeah but remind me
S0326	princeton and south california university of south california
S0329	oh really that would be a laugh princeton you'd have to live in new york
S0326	yeah
S0329	my friend be just go off to take up a job at the history department at princeton university and i've get lunch with her on monday and she's get a flat in
S0326	at new jersey
S0329	in no in
S0329	erm tompkins square new york
S0326	how do she get that
S0329	er she get it through some some academic swap thing
S0326	oh yeah yeah
S0329	er where hang on where be i go hang on darling erm yeah you're fuck well position in term of connections for further education with your your dad be you know a proper academic and your mother be just super plug in
S0329	i do actually have a chat with a classicist at with the main classics guy at princeton
S0326	yeah it's 's erm
S0329	yeah yeah it's yeah something to do with her
S0329	's nephew
S0326	he tell me to go to
S0329	yeah i think it's clear that you want to use your you know study provide you with an opportunity and an excuse to erm expand your life and your and your world you can go into southern california you can go to sao paulo you can go wherever you want to study when you get out of the world of study it become a little bite more it's a good place to be in the your twenties i think i wouldn't be in a hurry to provide it can be fund
S0326	yeah
S0329	well
S0326	but that's why he like my teacher say like fund be a lot less competitive in america because there be so much more money
S0329	yeah there's a lot more money yeah erm yeah i mean one of the things that 's really piss with it would be good if come to i think you two have get lot in common erm but look er he just look at have a you know a burgeon career as a academic as an academic he be teach philosophy at erm he be make great progress with his thesis he be all set to have that kind of life and he give it up and he just well just totally lose interest think everybody who be do academic philosophy be very third rate i think it's partly because
S0326	but that's what i but that's what i er it seem like that to me something the people who who just er continue with it study cos they couldn't think of er anything else to do
S0329	well it's like i don't think it's like that in your subject i do think it's like that in other subject in that erm and also i i think it's like that in this country and i don't particular think it's like that
S0326	i but i think it's like that at but especially because
S0329	oh yeah of course
S0326	no but because it
S0329	be utterly parochial
S0326	but also it it's just because people be this be what the people who be actually more interest be someone who go to a less cool university but then become a really good cos they've discover that they actually really like their thing
S0329	who's the they
S0326	this hypothetical person the thing about people at be that they that's always be what they're good at in school
S0329	yeah
S0326	i mean what i'm say be people who go on whose thing hasn't always be be good at school who have actually discover a subject be more will always be much more interest people
S0329	erm when i go i haven't tell you about when i go to get a from have i
S0326	no
S0329	it be a sunny day and i hadn't really be round and spend the day there and we go and have lunch in hugh fearnley whittingstall's er restaurant there and it's a really proper city full of and it's get a proper vibe and i really suddenly saw how difficult it be for you at to go to a place where there be just like some some a high street there's just high street shop and there's no kind of vibe and like any vibe there be be lock away in your college

S0326	er i i go er like you know that greek one erm near near or where use to be up the towards
S0329	oh my god
S0326	like or something
S0326	yeah
S0329	that's like one of the world's most expensive restaurants

S0326	yes yeah
S0329	but that it's still rubbish be it still rubbish
S0326	well it's still a fuck bombsite
S0329	so it's impossible to tell
S0326	yeah well if they have er load of money cos haven't they didn't buy a house at which be retard
S0329	say that again
S0326	i guess they have money so they didn't buy a house in
S0329	i don't understand why they didn't if they have money
S0326	i think the whole plan be they would sell their house and buy one in in that's where dad's like i can can't i can gonna get a little flat
S0329	and they haven't buy a house
S0326	that at some point they decide not to buy a house in and just get spend all their money in london
S0329	and how often be they go to be in
S0326	erm most of the year
S0329	and what happen to their house when they're not there
S0326	i suppose they just do some of those academic swap things with someone in or somewhere somewhere else
S0329	well can you really not stay in dad's house you and why if you be you know if i rent out my house could you would he make would he let you two be homeless
S0326	i dunno
S0329	what do you feel about that
S0326	i don't wanna stay in that house i would rather find somewhere else to live
S0326	what
S0329	why don't you want to stay in there they're not there
S0326	i don't know i just don't i just don't want to
S0329	that's what say but i mean what happen if i say i really need to rent the house out i really need i've get to do it sorry
S0326	right you you know what you could why don't you rent your house out to me and two of my friends
S0329	what two of your friends
S0326	need somewhere to live need somewhere to live
S0329	you think i'm gonna fuck rent my house to and
S0326	be grow up now
S0329	no i'm
S0326	but that way you wouldn't have to move all your shit you know cos where would you put everything if you rent that out to a family and you think you think the damage and be gonna do compare to have like a family in there it's children
S0329	and
S0326	i mean er just for an example
S0329	no it would be like rent my house out to students they wouldn't they would
S0326	they're not it's
S0329	it would be trash
S0326	live with grow up people 's learn to live with grow up people
S0329	where be live at the moment
S0326	i'm not actually sure she's be she's be in miami a lot
S0329	what's she be do in miami
S0326	i think she have a boyfriend there
S0329	how be she earn any money
S0326	she's er a host there at a hotel
S0329	what
S0326	she work as a host at a hotel
S0329	what hotel
S0329	erm it's an idea how much do you think i could charge
S0326	erm
S0329	what if it be just one of them
S0326	i reckon you could charge six hundred and seven hundred for the big one for for for them to be able to afford it charge more otherwise but
S0329	so for example next if i rent out one room yours or 's i dunno
S0326	it's hard to rent out one room though cos there would there's empty room
S0329	well they're not empty be they because you and be come back all the time although i don't know how much will come back erm
S0326	i mean the problem with me be i don't actually rent my room all year round
S0329	i know well look the truth be that i be probably go to go and live in france next year and that be that be the plan from the autumn i
S0326	what about your job
S0329	and i'll give my job up i it's i haven't say anything because it be there's quite a lot of fine tune to do i've be in discussions with work i erm i
S0326	won't you be totally bore though
S0329	no i won't be at all bore for a second because i'll be develop my it would be other string to my bow i'm slightly you know if i stay at the that's all it be that's all my life that's all my professional life for me and i've explain that to you i really need to earn money to have a salary and a job when you and be grow up because have to to provide a roof over your head and look after you but that you're grow up now or you're get grow up you don't need parent in the same way and so my need for a kind of salaried job be erm be lessen and i don't really find yes that's it's not erm you know i'd like to
S0326	yeah yeah
S0329	expand my life the it seem pointless to me just go in every day into the office when you and and when i don't need to come home and cook for your and that life be over i know that both you and want me to
S0326	no i don't mind you go
S0329	erm and i think that actually this year be quite a good year because will be very much in let's just say i
S0326	yeah
S0329	do it for a year
S0326	yeah yeah that's like
S0329	will be very much in we can meet in the holiday either in france or in london the house will still be go erm but it will be where and i come back to so it wouldn't really be
S0326	well what's happen to 's house it's sell
S0329	he's i think he's go i the idea be that he's go to sell it but this be what i mean about the fine tune we don't we have both our house value the other day guess what our house be worth
S0326	what
S0329	just have a little guess at what the estate agent say i could put it on the market for
S0326	eight hundred thousand
S0329	have another guess
S0326	a million
S0329	have another guess
S0326	one point two million
S0329	one point two five million
S0326	that's totally insane i don't
S0329	totally insane
S0326	make me feel sick
S0329	erm it make me feel really rich except that i can't access that money erm you know it's meaningless unless somebody give me one point two five million obviously i've get a mortgage and the rest of it so er so we're you know we've get to work out ways of release some of the money so that i don't need my salary from work to keep me go through the next couple of years while i find other ways of earn money yeah then oh fuck hell there might be a bite of a lean period erm but i think this be the time to do it but yeah like i say the fine the fine tune the actual practicalities not just the fine tune the practicalities how it be possible how it be manageable it's all very very much in the air so it's not it's not really we're not able to have a proper discussion about it
S0326	so you're think what you could get somewhere and if you then rent out to
S0329	well i've get to i've actually get to write down the options and it might be that i need to to to talk to someone who can you know a proper financial advisor because one option would be that i would sell like say ten percent of my house to erm he pay for everything in france and support me in france but he own ten percent of my house and i've get money that's one i quite like that idea but er some people that i've speak to
S0326	but his house must be worth like fuck forty five mill then
S0329	his house be worth two two point one
S0326	i don't think that you could sell that house for that much money
S0329	well i must admit i don't really think so either but that's
S0326	and they say i saw this article and it's just like it be really sad actually they be say it be and they an interview with an estate agent and then another interview with someone who live like sort of like have grow up and live and be poor in east london and the estate agents be like their like teeth be like drip with like money and greed and they're like the way they're talk be so repulsive and you have these people talk about their like try to struggle here the estate agents
S0329	i know
S0326	just here it's like party time man
S0329	no i know but the poor person i mean i'm a poor person in in it's just that my house suddenly be worth an incredible
S0326	yeah
S0329	amount of money
S0326	but it hasn't hasn't but they haven't be able to sell their house have they
S0329	no they've sell it
S0326	they've sell it
S0329	they have now sell it so she'll be and that be one point two five erm it cos so that be another option that i would be think you know if if there be just a possibility that if and i didn't if it ever become too difficult for us to pool our resources in some way that i might strike out on my own but i don't think that's gonna happen but if i do you know i've get options i could sell the house
S0326	's be quite funny about people who come to look at her house she just say they be so rich and they be all sort of quite quite like shock because her 's house be a bite like you know live in
S0329	i know live in yeah
S0326	they'd come in in like suit and in snakeskin shoe and like turn their nose up
S0329	i know
S0326	it's gonna be so horrible to live there in five years in that area don't you think it already be a bite
S0329	i don't know it's hard to tell i quite you know i like what's be happen in our street for example or next to the two house next to be like
S0326	no but it's the kind of people around
S0329	yeah well the thing be i also don't need to have a house in because you're not at school there you know that i it be an option to erm sell up buy a three bedroom flat in you know er there be there be total options er but i think it's i think it's a good er it's a good year to start explore them anyway don't say anything to well not that you will see but don't say anything to don't say anything to your friends cos it's not you know it's all un un up in the air but and i be say last night when we go and live in france we're gonna get a dog i'm so excite
S0326	what's gonna happen to the tortoises
S0329	i've get a home for the but the next our next door neighbour really really they it be like all their christmases have come at once when they get to
S0329	look after our tortoises and i i can definitely offer them next door
S0326	well won't have that
S0329	or i'm gonna take them to his house in in
S0326	they won't survive that it's a student house

S0329	scotland
S0326	yeah it's true
S0329	erm doesn't particularly like be in france in in august but it's just too hot it's just can't do anything you can't do anything cos he want to do like garden he just say you flop by the pool but it's not like
S0326	why don't you get a house in scotland
S0329	well we might do that too
S0326	that would be good you should do that
S0329	i think the the idea be really to just throw throw everything up in the air and see where it land i need a wee god it do not take long to get to do it whereas just take forever

S0326	i don't really use facebook
S0329	well you might have to get on it in order to be in touch with him or he's go to switzerland so i don't particularly want to text him for his number
S0326	can't wait for the day when people be not on facebook and you don't have to go on it
S0329	well obviously that's my every day
S0329	but there will come
S0326	yeah
S0329	a time won't there
S0326	yeah
S0329	i mean it's just but won't it be replace by something else
S0326	yeah but something not so sort of something more like instagram or twitter
S0329	so you think you be well lols when you put that on my picture
S0326	no that not i must say a little bite lols
S0329	i love the way that and always like my instagram picture they
S0326	where be you then anyway
S0329	at the
S0326	what's the
S0329	the club it's a club in but i be the only person that have lunch with and and and 's a member of the club in fact so be i really want to be a member i be think of buy a membership for his birthday so i could get in there but then i think it's a bite mean to buy someone who can't eat and drink a a membership to a club where that's the only point of go
S0326	when's he go to be able to eat again
S0329	i think he'll never be able to eat erm i think pasta and bread that's it never again but i don't miss pasta and oh i do miss pasta a bite but and rice no no more risottos
S0326	or maybe you've get to go to that place in tuscany and have the goose pasta
S0329	oh you she be fuck last thing that will he'll
S0329	probably spontaneously combust
S0329	he can't even
S0326	i mean we get me and and i have be invite back there
S0329	have you
S0326	yeah
S0329	what do you mean invite what do that mean
S0326	come and stay and eat for free cos they're the the woman love and she have this really funny son who's obviously gay who's who love more than anything in the world when we get back send him like a box of cookbooks and tool and ingredients
S0329	ah she's so nice how if i'd order that cake normal price how much would it have be
S0326	i don't know don't know how big it be or anything
S0329	it be fuck big i couldn't carry it it need two people to carry it to the car everything's full i can oh no i don't need to
S0326	yeah
S0329	worry about that cos i go to your special little park place
S0326	but yeah today be definitely the day that people get pick up
S0329	so what be the outcome be go to send to
S0326	i think a state school
S0329	a state school oh how how old be
S0326	oh i dunno twenty six maybe i have no idea
S0329	that's amaze amaze and she's live all by herself in
S0326	yeah
S0329	that's pretty impressive i mean it's true that it's quite astonish that choose that moment to sell why couldn't he just wait a few years
S0326	well i think that's what he be wait for but it be
S0329	it look like she be never gonna pop her clog how long do he have to wait yeah i agree that be another reason why i kind of think this year be a good year to go away cos granny doesn't need me to push her around in a bath chair now
S0326	be there any water here
S0329	no it be mistake to not buy some in the petrol station but i be so bamboozle by pay first i couldn't kind of it be confuse if i'd stay in that's what i would have turn into erm why do i feel very confuse
