S0324	yeah everyone's a rival
S0325	yeah and i'm really proud of myself when i beat my rival like when i beat in that english
S0324	you always beat someone
S0325	i never beat she always do better than me in humanities
S0324	yeah well who care about
S0325	and she's amaze at pe and but she's not very good at art that's one thing i be better than her at her at at than
S0324	than her at
S0325	yeah
S0324	oh that be that's what it be i wasn't sure what it be
S0325	but i i really like art i just erm what a mist doesn't really come over it i oh
S0324	what
S0325	really go to go to art on wednesday aren't we oh no you're not
S0324	oh yeah i'm not sure if it's this wednesday or next wednesday that i have my hygienist but what be you gonna say about
S0325	mist never come over to me anymore
S0324	yeah
S0325	probably because i'm do really badly
S0324	that's not true
S0325	we have we have to do this we have to do erm certain people stand up and it's so annoy because she be like i'm sure none of you have get it accurate enough that you'll be like do the crease and i be do the crease and she swap the people and he be wear completely different trousers and i be so annoy
S0324	you obviously you weren't do it accurate enough
S0325	what do you mean you obviously weren't do it accurate enough
S0324	well she say you're not do it accurate enough cos you're already do the crease
S0325	no because no no she say i'm sure most of you aren't do it aren't do it that accurately and you haven't go onto the crease
S0324	oh right
S0325	so it doesn't matter if we switch them and i be like no please no then yeah we switch them but my figure don't really look realistic
S0324	they do
S0325	they don't
S0324	yes they do stop lie
S0325	i don't i like the but i can't really do any type of art and i'm not very creative
S0324	that's not true
S0325	and the reason i don't think i'm very good at art cos i'm a perfectionist if something go wrong i just give up i don't think that's very good in artist to be not try
S0324	like that's not really true though you don't always give up
S0325	i do always give up
S0324	no you don't not really
S0325	yeah i do i always give up unless i don't have to give up unless i i mean unless i have to keep go like you should have see how many like draw i do at art because i just give up on the ones that i'm not happy with i don't keep work at them or redo them try to give up like no can't be bother with that one i'm so jealous that erm be go to see ed sheeran
S0324	yeah
S0325	i want to see ed sheeran
S0324	well maybe you should go see him get the chance to
S0325	but i really like ed sheeran i've never actually go to see anyone live in like a concert or something have you

S0324	i wanna go see she's come soon
S0325	she's do a world tour isn't she
S0324	yeah
S0325	and she's start in japan
S0324	yeah
S0325	i'm not even go back to japan this summer
S0324	oh
S0325	i think i be and my mum say actually it's next winter and i be like oh great

S0325	nothing
S0324	so you're just go to stay at home
S0325	yeah
S0324	oh
S0325	so i could of go to lanzarote actually i couldn't of because they wouldn't of let me go in the winter but
S0324	oh yeah cos she say if you go to lanzarote you won't be able to go back to japan this summer
S0325	but it's not though
S0324	it's not even this summer
S0325	i really want to go to erm where be it
S0324	dunno
S0325	erm the place that you've be actually that doesn't narrow it down much erm in greece
S0324	erm
S0324	yeah
S0325	i really wanna go there that's where zoella go
S0324	yeah
S0325	i also wanna go to dubai actually i don't want to go to dubai that much
S0324	i do but then i don't really because

S0324	yeah it the school but school it's good that school jumpers aren't
S0325	comfortable
S0324	yeah
S0325	and they're not
S0324	and they're not woolly and itchy or
S0325	yeah yeah we're like the only school that have to wear blazers
S0324	yeah
S0325	everyone else just wear jumpers and so i when turn up to
S0324	or a tie or something
S0325	gcse everyone look at me and all my friends be like oh you're wear a blazer oh that's fancy oh yeah ah if we wear tie that would just be the end of my life
S0324	yeah we can't wear tie
S0325	no
S0324	and blazers
S0325	i feel sorry for
S0324	yeah
S0325	their uniform their blazers
S0324	like red and black stripy
S0325	oh my gosh that's ridiculous i feel so sorry for them
S0324	yeah so do i
S0325	because
S0324	cos they have tie and blazers and it's like
S0325	blazers and they're both ridiculous
S0324	like bright colour
S0325	yeah
S0324	and it's like really but just stand out
S0325	i'd actually way prefer i actually prefer school uniform to wear normal clothe
S0324	so do i because it's really hard to find something to wear
S0325	yeah
S0324	and then you don't wanna wear the same thing so many time cos i basically just wear my jeans the whole time
S0325	yeah
S0324	and that's basically it and then yeah
S0325	and then i never know what to wear on a non uniform day so how be i mean to figure out what to wear every day
S0324	yeah exactly i i be actually glad we have a school uniform
S0325	yeah but i don't i don't like the skirt and stuff i don't like
S0324	mm
S0325	because i don't like how we have to or i don't mind i i don't like how we're not allow to have sort of stretchy material skirt like i'd like the sort of stretchier ones not like the really tight fit ones but you know like my black and white one
S0324	oh yeah
S0325	like that
S0324	you i think you can like use to have one like that
S0325	yeah but you're not allow them
S0324	oh
S0325	technically i don't think
S0324	well have stretchy material skirt
S0325	yeah well
S0324	but it's like a belt
S0325	a belt like a big belt
S0324	yeah
S0325	in fact it's probably not even a belt it's like
S0324	well it's very reveal
S0325	it's an extension of her top
S0325	exactly i really like i actually really like the wind band top i like them because it's the size that
S0324	i don't like the colour it's grey
S0325	mm but i like the size the size be good
S0324	i mean it's okay
S0325	you and be like oh god sleeves cos they be down to our and like yeah i like it because it's exactly the same size as i'm wear now
S0324	hopefully in the summer they won't be as big
S0325	hopefully they will i like them big and i like them with the collar do up and like really massive and baggy that's how i like it that's how i like everything really cover up and massive even though my christmas jumper actually isn't that massive
S0324	i like fit jumpers like more not yeah kind of like tighter
S0325	ah just like really baggy and like so i can put my hand in like this and
S0324	yeah i like do that but i can do that with tighter jumpers
S0325	i think they i haven't plan around vandalise book but my science book be a little bite vandalise
