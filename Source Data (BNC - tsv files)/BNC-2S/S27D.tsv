S0144	that kind of thing
S0024	yeah okay
S0144	um yeah
S0024	i be talk today with about the nhs and everything and we be lucky to have the nhs
S0144	mm
S0024	i mean they do
S0144	yeah when
S0024	they be good
S0144	when's she gotta have her mri mri be it what do that stand for
S0024	who's have an mri scan
S0024	no she's have a oh i don't know
S0144	yeah that's after but i think she's gotta have a maybe it wasn't an mri
S0024	what be mri
S0144	well i dunno
S0024	i've forget
S0144	hm
S0024	i don't know
S0144	but i don't know if that be something to determine the extent to which it's spread basically
S0024	i don't know what that be
S0144	no nor do i
S0024	yeah
S0144	but that's in two weeks
S0024	huh
S0144	that's in two weeks' time
S0024	mm mm
S0144	which i don't know how critical it be in get something i mean two weeks sound like quite a long time to me
S0024	yeah
S0024	yeah
S0144	i mean i'd hate to be sit around for two weeks if i'd just be diagnose with that wait for another test
S0024	well wait what else can you do that's what you've get to do
S0144	well yeah but
S0024	you've get to wait
S0144	if it be private you'd get it do the next day wouldn't you
S0024	yeah i be talk to about private as well cos cos she work at the hospital she say you know they've only get a certain amount of things they can do with private healthcare and they can do all the diagnosis and stuff but when it come to actual an operation or something else then they they ship them to the nhs hospital anyway
S0144	yeah
S0024	so you literally just have to get um you have to get the the check do and that can be do like within a couple of days all of the check do and then you go to the nhs with your consultant thing and you pass the piece of paper with the consultant thing on and they give you the treatment that you have to have so
S0144	yeah hm
S0024	yeah
S0144	er
S0024	so i be think that for some other people as well whether they should go do the private healthcare
S0144	mm
S0024	just to get the check out
S0144	mm
S0024	and then get your consultancy paper and everything
S0144	mm
S0024	every diagnosis that you've get and then go back onto the nhs
S0144	mm mm
S0024	there's no point in do everything through private healthcare because they just
S0144	no
S0024	send you through the nhs anyway
S0144	yeah that's true it's the wait isn't it
S0024	you just have to pay
S0144	that's the biggest thing
S0024	yeah
S0144	it's get something do the next week or get something do in three years' time
S0024	i be wonder as well you say that they've spend all their money
S0144	who what my dad
S0024	mm
S0144	well no they've spend a big part of it
S0024	whereas
S0024	now i bet they wish they have the money
S0144	well yeah
S0024	well i'm sure they've get some leave
S0144	well he's always be a bite foolish with money really he's not gonna start learn now
S0024	well i think it it should be alright now they've get they've get some
S0144	yeah
S0024	to spend should be alright
S0144	yeah should be er
S0024	oh well
S0144	yeah um we're i be talk earlier with your mum and dad about the you know that um inoculation they give the thirteen year old girls
S0024	mm i'm not sure about that at all
S0144	that's
S0024	what's that all about
S0144	i think that be about cervical
S0024	it be cervical cancer
S0144	yeah
S0024	yeah
S0144	but then your mum say it be something to do with chlamydia or do
S0024	no it's not
S0144	can chlamydia
S0024	it's not to do with
S0144	contribute
S0024	chlamydia
S0144	to have cervical cancer
S0024	i don't know but i i'm pretty sure it's the cervical cancer jab
S0144	right
S0024	that's i don't know what it do i don't even know how they can stop the mutation of cells from happen
S0144	well no
S0024	i don't get it
S0144	that's a load of bollocks isn't it really
S0024	i don't understand it at all
S0144	it's just a multi billion pound pharmaceutical
S0024	mm
S0144	er push i reckon they've put something in it dumb down everyone or
S0024	infertility hm
S0144	infertility hm wouldn't surprise me
S0024	but that's what scar me about
S0144	evil bastards
S0024	go get any test
S0144	mm
S0024	do i don't want them
S0144	mm
S0024	mess about with anything
S0144	yeah well i be read that thing about all the heavy metal they put in the injections
S0024	mm
S0144	and i'm sure that be link to autism
S0024	well they say er well
S0144	cos that's just go through the roof
S0024	on the tv the other day they be say about the asthma and the eczema rat
S0144	yeah
S0024	skyrocket
S0144	mm
S0024	and then they be try to find all these different excuse as to why but nobody really say anything about these multiple jab they're give the baby
S0144	yeah
S0024	they're give them the flu jab and that um um oh the that trio what's that trio mumps rubella that's the mmr
S0144	that's mmr not mri
S0024	oh m er mmr yeah
S0144	yeah
S0024	give it to the little baby i don't think that's very i don't think that's good
S0144	no
S0024	i just hope we don't get to the condition like america be and we all get put in prison for neglect if we don't have our baby have jab
S0144	yeah yeah cos they've do that haven't they
S0024	that woman in america get
S0144	well they've
S0024	do
S0144	yeah
S0024	i don't know
S0144	they've literally take kid off their parent
S0024	yeah i know i mean that's just not fair cos it should be your choice
S0144	well it should be yeah yeah
S0024	they can't say i mean there's no
S0144	i dunno
S0024	no proof that it's it's definitely the right thing to do
S0144	no i think to an extent these injections be good i mean they have cure a lot of
S0024	yeah
S0144	things
S0024	yeah
S0144	there's no debate that but er it's so wide open for abuse
S0024	yeah
S0144	by these company who be you know these company be so powerful they've get no interest really other than their shareholders' price
S0024	mm
S0144	and just generate as much money as they can i mean
S0024	mm
S0144	ethics take a backseat really doesn't it
S0024	mm
S0144	and the amount of um i dunno experiment they've do through the history i mean you have to go into like a library and pick up some book
S0024	yeah
S0144	and find the amount of time that they've experiment
S0024	they've
S0144	on us
S0024	yeah they experiment with hiv test didn't they or there's rumour that they do
S0144	well that's yeah that's rumour but i mean these be like
S0024	mm
S0144	clinically test
S0024	but you never know
S0144	and prove where people have get millions in compensation and stuff
S0024	mm
S0144	but they're just all hide and then anyone who talk about it be a conspiracy theorist or
S0024	yeah
S0144	you know it's and to think that that kind of stuff isn't happen now be just it's foolish i think of course they're do it
S0024	yeah but it's just difficult to know what they're do it on or what what ones be safe i don't know it's hard isn't it
S0144	yeah well i'd rather not pump any of that crap into my blood to be honest
S0024	yeah but like you say there be the good ones that stop you get ill
S0144	yeah
S0024	i mean still talk tell me to get my rubella do every time i see her and i'm like
S0144	yeah
S0024	um but i have german measles when i be a kid and she say oh well you can have them again and what about unborn baby can if you're not inoculized then there's a danger but i don't know it's it's very very rare that you get german measles twice it be german measles isn't it the other measles you
S0144	i don't know
S0024	can get lot of time
S0144	hm
S0024	er you have to research it really so that you know what you're so you know what you're look at you know what you're talk about but
S0144	yeah
S0024	that's as far as i know you can only get it once
S0144	mm
S0024	and if i have it when i be a kid then i can't get it again i i i immun
S0144	mm
S0024	immunize myself
S0144	mm

S0144	well it's like with these flu jab as well they push on the old people
S0024	mm
S0144	every christmas

S0144	i'm sure that kill quite a lot of people
S0024	well it give them a little bite of flu before they
S0144	yeah
S0024	um
S0144	do you know what i dunno er i suppose it's personal choice isn't it
S0024	well as long as it stay a personal choice
S0144	yeah
S0024	then you can
S0144	exactly i mean we go round
S0144	india without have a single jab
S0024	yeah and i be surprise at go straight away she go to the doctor and get all her jab do
S0144	yeah
S0024	again her um tetanus
S0144	yeah
S0024	now that that doctor in thailand always
S0144	he
S0024	tell me
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	cos that that be when i wasn't sure about injections and i
S0144	mm
S0024	just go to get them he say what be you have that tetanus jab for
S0144	mm
S0024	i say well what's
S0144	well that's it it's just consider
S0024	cos we do
S0144	normal isn't it
S0024	yeah
S0024	just in case i
S0144	it's like what people do
S0024	i'm outside and i cut myself
S0144	yeah
S0024	with a stick
S0144	a rusty nail
S0024	yeah and he say he say do you know the likelihood of get
S0144	yeah
S0024	tetanus and i think no
S0144	i mean sorry
S0024	and then
S0144	then you just go along with the the social norm with
S0024	i can't remember the percentage he say but it be really low
S0144	yeah yeah
S0024	and and then he say and then like if you do cut yourself with your rusty nail outside or something then you can go and get your tetanus jab
S0144	mm
S0024	just as a precaution
S0144	yeah
S0024	but what's the point of have it if you haven't
S0144	yeah exactly
S0024	get any infection to begin with
S0144	yeah hm
S0024	i don't know
S0144	hm
S0024	but i kind of i like that different side of a doctor give me a different opinion like someone actually say hang on a minute you don't need this all the other doctor and dentists and opticians
S0144	no
S0024	they just go you need this you need more you need
S0144	well i mean
S0024	stronger
S0144	they're all drug peddlers
S0024	mm
S0144	i'm sure they be
S0024	i know it feel like that
S0144	i think you know more
S0024	even the opticians
S0144	yeah the opticians as well
S0024	like they
S0144	yeah
S0024	they be they be say to me i i say you know i be try to describe to her my eyesight and i be say you know my weakest my eyesight's my eye be weakest on the top right hand side cos that's where it's blurriest and she like look at me as if i be crazy and say what this be your prescription and that's that but it's not
S0144	mm
S0024	and then i don't trust them
S0144	mm
S0024	it's like you're not listen to what i'm say you should know everything about eye
S0144	mm
S0024	i'm tell you that my eyesight be worse in one part than the other part you should at least understand that that's a possibility
S0144	or you should at least be interest
S0024	yes
S0144	in that you're say that
S0024	yeah
S0144	not just go through her
S0024	like oh i've never hear that before and then go home
S0144	yeah
S0024	and look it up and
S0144	yeah
S0024	and yeah they should be interest yeah that's true
S0144	yeah i think a lot of people learn their routine of how things be do
S0024	they just
S0144	they do that and then that's they've get no
S0024	they just wanna give me stronger and stronger glass it's like
S0144	complete yeah yeah
S0024	i say what if i do my eye exercise oh no no
S0144	they don't work
S0024	can't improve your
S0144	no
S0024	eyesight and then there's 's dad who have his stroke wear glass for thirty years have a stroke and they take that blood clot from outside of his neck
S0144	yeah
S0024	and he can see almost twenty twenty vision
S0024	and they say that it's a an effect because
S0144	not enough
S0024	he never have enough oxygen
S0144	yeah
S0024	go in
S0144	hm
S0024	to his brain and like his blood have be clot up for age
S0144	hm
S0024	and age and then when they take it away and he's be feel better
S0144	mm
S0024	and his eyesight i mean they say he be like spiderman
S0024	he put on his glass and he couldn't see
S0024	it be all blurry he take his glass off and he could see and then he put them on again and like take them off and be like
S0024	be like spiderman suddenly get his special power and
S0144	do he start climb the wall
S0024	i bet he wish he could
S0024	but that go to show that there be something that you can do to improve your
S0144	well yeah there's a lot
S0024	health and your you know
S0144	beneath the surface
S0024	that the doctor don't know about
S0144	that the doctor can't see or we don't know about yet
S0024	yeah
S0144	i dunno i just don't like blindly follow people
S0024	mm
S0144	i think that's dangerous really
S0024	i know but it take a lot to research it
S0144	yeah it do but
S0024	that's like these cure
S0144	that's what people should do i think
S0024	with trish like i'd love to say to her oh i've research this and this how about you try like live off organic fruit or how about you try this
S0144	yeah
S0024	um but i don't think people listen to be honest you know
S0144	no no they don't to be honest
S0024	i but you should tell them
S0144	because they don't like it put them in a position where they they they lose power they've get their
S0024	their beliefs
S0144	they've get a world view they've get their world belief
S0024	mm
S0144	if they start question that then they they lose their empowerment and they have to put a lot of work in to do the research
S0024	yeah
S0144	um to which there usually there isn't an answer anyway
S0024	yeah
S0144	but i dunno er it's difficult hm
S0024	yeah
S0144	hm
S0024	yeah
S0144	hm i be gonna say something then i've forget what it be hm
S0024	you know what i believe in all of these acupressure things and stuff and i really believe in it
S0144	mm
S0024	but not many other people
S0144	mm
S0024	there be i've get some friends who do as well but not to the extent that i do
S0144	yeah mm
S0024	and the meditation thing you see i can't imagine sit there do meditation
S0144	no
S0024	or any
S0144	no but if you don't think it's gonna do you any good it won't do you any good
S0024	no exactly so you have to have
S0144	so there's no point push it on people
S0024	a self belief yeah no mm
S0144	ah critical think that's what i be gonna say
S0024	what
S0144	um i dunno like go out there and do the research be the same as like critical think it's it's part of our education that just isn't um enforce
S0024	mm
S0144	people don't want to go out and learn how to criticize things to get a a different perspective
S0024	no they
S0144	in fact they're actively encourage not to do that and encourage to just go along with the
S0024	they yeah they just want
S0144	whatever
S0024	somebody who's who's specialize in that area to tell them what's best
S0144	yeah
S0024	for them
S0144	yeah
S0024	not to like
S0144	but the trouble be
S0024	not to think for themselves
S0144	when these experts um
S0024	if they get it right
S0144	get in position of extreme power like
S0024	mm
S0144	er what's happen now i mean you're you're trust people who haven't really get your best interest at heart and if you haven't
S0024	well you can't say that about all of them
S0144	no no i'm make sweep generalizations here
S0024	mm
S0144	but that's i think one of the fundamental problems in our society at the moment be that people they don't question they don't know how to that's the problem
S0024	well you um baby she have jab i be i be shock
S0144	mm
S0024	like
S0144	yeah well if a doctor tell you your baby need a jab
S0024	it's almost like they sell it
S0144	you do it don't you
S0024	i don't think they just tell you i think they put the sales pitch on
S0144	mm no if you don't your baby might get this this this
S0024	yeah and then it's what everybody else be do so
S0144	hm
S0024	and then people say well you know it's it's free treatment and everybody else say that it's good so we should do it
S0144	yeah
S0024	it would be very different if you have to pay for it i'm sure
S0144	hm yeah i be watch this programme the other night um i think it be last night actually it have martin clunes he be go round the islands in er
S0024	i saw a bite of that

S0144	and to remove themselves from society themselves show their kinda contempt to society
S0024	or they just need to try and hide away cos otherwise everybody would just get them
S0144	dunno i i just find the whole thing really sinister
S0024	mm
S0144	evil bastards
S0024	that thing that be on the tv this morning that be a bite weird about barclays have to it's not just barclays have to pay back all of those insurance things
S0144	right
S0024	but i don't really understand that because surely if somebody buy insurance and if they're stupid enough to sign the contract then
S0024	why be they why be the bank i mean i know it's kind of good that the bank will
S0144	yeah
S0024	pay back ordinary people who get trick into things

S0144	yeah i
S0024	a real trick maybe
S0144	i don't know about this either
S0024	if it be a good trick
S0144	i haven't really read about that
S0024	i mean that's it be good they're give money back they've get they've get i don't know room and room and room of paperwork
S0144	yeah
S0024	and they're gonna go through it one by one
S0144	yeah
S0024	they've be tell to go through it one by one and pay people back money
S0144	yeah well the cynical my cynical brain would say that it's just a way of put confidence back into the people
S0144	like
S0024	yeah
S0144	because of the financial er what's the word climate
S0024	mm
S0144	they use don't they because of that
S0024	yeah look what we're do
S0144	oh okay well we're give back to the people

S0144	yeah
S0024	side step of like then they be like under their breaths like
S0144	i mean the part will make in
S0024	like cough
S0144	china but usually the assembly be do in the er to do
S0024	but they
S0144	assembly would be expensive in england so it would make sense to outsource it really

S0024	but it's not oo it's it's
S0144	well it's not it make me feel sick and i have to look away from the tv like even watch the the highlight for the goals the other day like between each like goal there be this big flash like you know i reckon they be set off load of epileptic fit around the country
S0024	mm it's horrible isn't it
S0144	it's it be horrible
S0024	mm
S0144	and even like these chat show they've get these graphics behind their presenters
S0024	yeah
S0144	they're just move
S0024	they always seem to be blue
S0144	and they're all slowly move and morph and change shape
S0024	i wonder if it's like some sort of hypnosis thing
S0024	no seriously
S0144	maybe it be
S0024	well there be there be this one programme they really oh tut actually that be on rt that like max keiser
S0144	yeah
S0024	er the banker he's get the graphics
S0144	yeah he's get it as well
S0024	but he's get
S0144	everyone's get it
S0024	a round like a a round and it really be like a hypnosis thing
S0144	yeah
S0024	and you're think oh dear max you're resort to hypnosis for people to
S0024	listen to you or something i don't know
S0144	yeah
S0024	so i well
S0144	but tv doesn't even have to do that because
S0024	but it be hypnotic
S0144	because tv um it be it alpha alpha ray be it
S0024	mm
S0144	alpha
S0024	oh
S0144	it put your brain into a state
S0024	er
S0144	that you're in
S0024	beta i think
S0144	when you're sleep
S0024	yeah
S0144	be it beta
S0024	or theta theta
S0144	i can't remember but it make you
S0024	alpha be awake beta be
S0144	right i can't remember which one it be but it put you in the
S0024	it's either beta or theta
S0144	same when you be dream
S0024	yeah
S0144	which make you more suggestible
S0024	mhm
S0144	mm
S0024	yeah and that's what i think all these light be try to do
S0144	be just try to enhance it
S0024	they're just try to enhance it yeah
S0144	i dunno
S0024	yeah why not
S0144	i'm not sure about that i think it might just be like a trend
S0024	well i wish they'd get rid of it it's do my head in like
S0144	mm
S0024	mind you i shouldn't be watch tv anyway but like you know
S0144	yeah well huh you know we're stay round someone else's house effectively and you fit into
S0024	well i know but
S0144	their routines don't you
