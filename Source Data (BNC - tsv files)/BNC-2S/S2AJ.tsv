S0441	for god sake why don't they tell people this
S0439	she ring the hospital and be like yeah be my dad here and they're like who's your dad and she say erm and she go oh no he only have one daughter

S0439	yup and then no one have tell my mum hadn't tell my mum
S0441	they should speak to the home about this
S0439	mm mm
S0441	be they go to
S0439	yeah
S0441	because
S0439	my mum's like give them all like her her detail my dad's detail
S0441	she need to say that they need to be inform
S0439	yeah because that's horrendous
S0441	that's horrendous
S0439	for the hospital to not even know that you've have two children
S0441	what a dick she be
S0439	i know and then they try to get hold of and they couldn't and then they message me and be like could you message so she can get hold of her mum so she can fuck talk to us they're lucky he only have well not lucky but he only have gastroenteritis so it wasn't like he be die or anything
S0441	yeah
S0439	he just have a very horrible stomach but it's just ridiculous how they ring like every day and they couldn't get through to her and then she send them one text message on sunday be like oh he's fine he's moan again
S0441	great
S0439	yeah
S0441	thank for the head up dick
S0439	yeah and my mum be just like what the fuck you didn't even know that that you didn't even tell them i exist how
S0441	that's awful
S0439	it's a complete joke
S0441	what a dick
S0439	and then they're argue because grandad want to leave us money when he die and doesn't want him to because she want any money that not that there's go to be any money leave over to be honest but you know
S0441	why do she want it all i don't understand
S0439	because apparently she's poor or
S0441	i don't know why she want it all but sure that's doesn't
S0439	it's because he want to leave us five thousand pound each which for me and obviously isn't as much as her because she's get three children
S0441	yeah
S0439	and also she's get all these great grandchildren so she feel like she have to like distribute the money further
S0441	yeah
S0439	but that's her choice you know like that's not grandad's choice grandad's doesn't want to support his great grandchildren he doesn't really care that much about them
S0441	no
S0439	sound horrible but he doesn't care enough but she's like you know it's just not fair i think all the money should go to us and my mum's like but he doesn't want that and she basically just be really dicky about it
S0441	moron
S0439	you know when you just look at your your own siblings and you just think i can't ever imagine be in a
S0441	i know
S0439	state with them as what they be
S0441	i never want to be like that with my brother
S0439	no
S0441	it's just so sad
S0439	yeah i can't imagine ever argue with over money
S0441	no
S0439	because we both just be like if mum and dad die just split it
S0441	yeah
S0439	there'd be no question on well you know you didn't live in the country for how many years and so i've do more therefore i deserve more money like
S0441	it doesn't work like that
S0439	yeah it doesn't like that's not how it work you just everything you just half it it be like there's just no respect from the other person
S0441	no what a dick
S0439	yeah
S0441	i hate that it's really sad when it get like that that's what happen when my grandma's mum die they get really funny about money
S0439	yeah
S0441	i mean to be fair my nanny do leave more money to others than she do to
S0439	but then i guess it's their decision or who to be executive
S0441	yeah exactly er
S0439	and there be this case in the news the other week that really annoy me actually this woman go to court because her mum didn't leave her any money in her will because she run off she get marry and she run off with somebody her mum didn't like so her mum basically cut her off and they never speak they do not speak from the time the woman run off with her husband until the time her mum die
S0441	yeah
S0439	so her mum be just like basically disown her she's like you're not my daughter i don't really want anything to do with you i don't want to leave you my estate and it be like a lot of money and the daughter go to court to get it and you're just like mm i think that's really unfair
S0441	yes
S0439	because the daughter didn't deserve like she just didn't deserve the money you know it's the mum's money
S0441	yeah
S0439	she didn't like her mum she just want the money and you're just like
S0441	it be not good
S0439	yeah it's like her will the will should have be i think should have be final and it wasn't which i think be really bad
S0441	what so it get over run
S0439	yeah the will get overturn and the daughter get something like two hundred and fifty thousand pound or something like that well it might even be more either way though it be a lot of money and you're just like that isn't what the mum want she want her money to go to charity
S0441	yeah
