S0058	yeah
S0179	well i think er starters
S0058	it
S0179	may have be predetermine
S0058	yeah i i think that's for one person though so we might be able to get it for two um
S0179	oh yeah we should definitely do that
S0058	so that's it's stuff stuff vine leave hummus um fry aubergine yoghurt dip and yoghurt sound good
S0179	oh yeah that's that's that's what
S0058	two of those
S0179	sell me the experience anyway
S0058	i don't really know what to where to go nice er short menu
S0179	obviously that place near you know opposite um er near clock
S0058	oh it i just it freak me out the entire experience
S0179	yeah
S0179	but be very keen on it cos it's get good review
S0058	well er i can see it er like in all fairness i good food but it be just mental like do you know what i mean it be just not my kind of thing at all
S0179	indeed
S0058	if you're do that many things you can't do any of them well i'd far rather people just actually
S0179	well no there's nothing wrong with it there be just not a lot
S0058	well yeah but er the chip be really not very nice and the rice be just rice and it be like well and it be fine there be nothing there be nothing wrong with it it be just food though
S0179	this to be good
S0058	if i want just food i'll go home
S0179	if you if you be local this'd be fascinate to try for lunch
S0058	hmm
S0179	this'd be fascinate to try for lunch if you be
S0058	do you reckon
S0179	mm speak of nice short menus have a look at the win
S0058	we
S0179	i hope
S0058	i'm not even sure if wine we could just have beer
S0179	sorry
S0179	do you want to break your thing and have some persian tea
S0058	oh huh that sound good huh in all fairness it's probably not um it might not be caffeinated different type of tea be and aren't
S0179	be
S0058	as er as in rooibos tea be
S0179	one of the two persians
S0058	just tea leave but it's not
S0179	have get a typo cos er i assume they mean
S0058	between where and where
S0179	five and thirteen
S0058	um the bottom one
S0179	oh
S0179	i've gotta stop proofread things
S0058	yeah you wanna get out of that habit oh it's really bad someone put a sign on the bike shed door and it's be correct by so many people not for proof stuff just like um er well someone correct a tense in one of them and then somebody else somebody er they've put hold your card in front of of the reader and it will open and they've put no no you put your your card in front of the reader and then push it won't open by itself huh just don't work in a don't put up notice in a publish house
S0179	no it will open when push it's still correct it's just not
S0058	yeah but it's didn't specify you need to push it so people be apparently wave their card in front of it and then just stand and wait
S0058	which be maybe their problem
S0179	er no that's the problem with
S0058	yeah
S0179	work in publishers
S0179	ooh that look good

S0179	hmm
S0058	hmm
S0179	er er er you've er sink
S0058	yes um
S0179	it look huge
S0058	er um
S0179	also frame by your coat
S0179	mm er we should possibly explain that
S0058	yeah i'm mm i'm also wonder if i can actually use any of that first cos it's not might have to just leave it as that's alright special instructions
S0179	yes indeed well that's reasonable
S0058	we we can we er you can only transcribe that as a we'll be fine
S0179	yeah
S0179	oh
S0058	huh
S0179	yes but we
S0058	yeah fair enough
S0179	see as it's get er a little blink light
S0058	it's not blink it's just star
S0179	yeah
S0058	mm maybe
S0179	oh huh
S0058	wonder if i can be bother to get change or whether just to stay
S0179	i wouldn't bother
S0058	look alright like this i can put my administrator cardigan on if i get cold
S0179	and er you can administrate
S0179	this be fun for a change
S0058	yeah it's really nice actually it's nice to have well just yeah er walk past and think mm
S0179	yeah
S0179	cruise
S0058	hmm
S0179	cruise
S0058	cruise if you will i love all the carpet
S0179	yes indeed
S0058	we should put carpet on our wall
S0179	well you say that we still need something for the other wall
S0179	and i want one of those national trust tapestries
S0058	i think that would really look weird with er the way we've get the room it's very modern and clean and fresh and strip back and
S0179	there's nothing wrong with a good tapestry
S0058	there's nothing wrong with a good tapestry i just think it might look weird in the room i love a good tapestry as much as the next person you know i love tapestries i'm a medievalist
S0179	exactly mm
S0058	but i just think it might look odd
S0058	do you not agree
S0179	no
S0058	you can't you can't just put nice things together and they don't sometimes they're less than the sum of their part just cos it's nice it doesn't mean it'll work with all the other nice things
S0179	i'm i'm dislike this
S0058	what you can't just put nice things together
S0179	mm
S0058	wasn't there a time when er i be discuss what to have for dinner and you be like i say do you want risotto or sausages do you want chicken you be like can we have chicken risotto with sausages
S0179	oh yes
S0058	i be like yes yes we can
S0179	ooh i'm buzz
S0179	i like this new er text tone
S0058	mm it's quite please
S0179	one new message hmm
S0058	i'm wonder whether i should text back or
S0179	do i even
S0058	um oh er speak of which we need to text back and ask what he mean
S0179	about what
S0058	by say be you be you listen when er i be talk to him as we be get in the taxi
S0058	say something like he couldn't get there on saturday night so um you know he'd kind of sunday morning um
S0179	right that's a bite of er that's a bite wrong consider that we sort of he'd er accept this invitation
S0058	mm
S0179	from quite a while ago
S0058	well i think he'd er he'd texted and assume i'd get it but i didn't get it so i think he assume it be fine whenever he send the text so er yeah shall i give him a text now and just see cos i do say when i be just get into the taxi text me this because er
S0179	cos for instance there's no way gonna get the first train in the morning cos we'll want to be
S0058	he can't get the bus to us cos there isn't a bus until ten o'clock
S0058	it's a sunday so
S0179	exactly so unless he's will to get a taxi at the crack of dawn
S0058	i mean
S0179	and let's face it he's not gonna be on time it's gonna take us
S0058	in all fairness if he doesn't want to come round for dinner he can come to ours in the early hours of the morning and crash like er
S0179	well when what do he mean you can't get
S0058	well er he he say he be do i i didn't really er hear he be he be do this race and then he's see some friends in london
S0179	go to see friends in london
S0058	and he's not gonna get back
S0179	he's already agree to
S0058	i don't know how long he's have this arrange like
S0058	i think he's just try to sort of
S0179	well if he can get to i can pick him up from there
S0058	when on
S0179	or we can get er er but to be fair er he's gotta be able to get well the last train's not until about you know midnight
S0058	mm that's what i be gonna say like if he doesn't have to come for dinner if he just want to come and literally go to bed when he get here we can get up open the door for him like
S0179	well we'll probably still be up but
S0058	well exactly yeah that's what i mean like i'll maybe text him and just see what he mean and then
S0179	say oi
S0058	yeah
S0179	mm mm mm
S0058	thank you very much
S0179	thank you
S0058	mm smell nice things yeah in all fairness like if if he's somewhere en route where we could get him er it'd be easier than him come into potentially but as in if he could get to unless there's a park and ride that no they'd be go the wrong way aren't we for the park and ride um
S0179	what the follow morning
S0058	yeah sunday morning like
S0179	i'm still not no that's not the arrangement
S0058	so er what he so he would get a taxi to us very early would be the only alternative
S0179	as far as i'm concern yeah
S0058	will he have see what time be we leave i mean what time be we have you sort of have a think about
S0179	um no i be gonna do that tomorrow
S0058	mm
S0179	i mean it's gonna take sort of two and a half two two and a half hours to drive
S0058	yeah
S0179	so i be think leave maybe seven thirty
S0058	yeah
S0179	you know we can get up at like six thirty it won't take us that long to get up
S0058	mm
S0179	definitely need to leave time though just to make some lunch
S0058	oh right we need to buy that then we can we can do all the shop tomorrow we've get nothing to do tomorrow so we can shop and
S0179	yeah
S0058	sort of chill
S0179	someone can make lunch while someone cook dinner
S0058	yeah
S0179	well you can do both while dan and i watch tv
S0058	that's it
S0179	how do that sound i believe the correct answer to that be
S0058	that sound excellent
S0179	hmm oh i like that
S0058	hmm it's nice ain't it
S0179	yeah anyway um
S0058	mm er hang on hate it when you put it on number mode and then you press the space but it's a zero
S0179	yes okay i'm er not er terribly sure that hmm
S0058	hmm
S0179	we seem to have lose
S0058	lose who
S0179	you
S0058	i'm just write this text may as well get it do yeah
S0179	er not er not at the same time antisocial
S0058	i'm er i'm nearly do right
S0179	okay fine
S0058	see i wasn't long anyway cheer
S0179	do that a while ago
S0179	you miss it
S0058	well i er obviously wasn't look when you're look smell lovely cheer

S0179	okay
S0058	oh okay
S0058	yeah
S0058	brilliant
S0179	yeah great thank you
S0179	ooh er incidentally er we we should've possibly explain earlier um
S0179	not to disconcert you of the er record
S0179	um we're do a well you should explain
S0058	hmm yeah we're do a linguistics project record conversations
S0058	so
S0179	mm
S0179	mm
S0058	just in case you be wonder
S0058	yeah sure
S0058	we're not secret diners honestly
S0179	yeah we have be ask that before
S0058	yeah
S0058	okay
S0058	awesome
S0179	okay thank you
S0058	thank very much
S0179	mm
S0179	actually the the
S0058	hmm
S0179	actually be as quiet as possible
S0179	mm sign a consent form
S0058	i have get a form
S0179	no
S0058	no
S0179	you can't get random people to sign your
S0058	no i know we can't
S0179	consent form well shouldn't
S0058	shouldn't yeah hmm
S0179	mm
S0058	how bizarre that's really interest i didn't realize the cross over
S0179	there's huge cross over
S0058	mm
S0179	mm
S0058	there's a big bite of aubergine mm garlicky
S0179	mm i think we may need a little bite more pitta bread in a bite but
S0058	mm
S0179	mm mm er that's delicious
S0058	be it good
S0058	i'm not surprise seem to make sense be that you
S0179	no it wasn't me cos that's what saffron mm er ginger
S0058	it's fry something maybe it's just sort of bread crumb
S0179	hmm
S0058	how's this one
S0179	mm yeah it's good there's not much add to it it's fairly sort of in its basic form i think
S0058	hm mm tasty
S0179	hmm
S0058	yeah it's just er yoghurt and garlic good
S0179	mm and an awful lot of sort of flavour through this
S0058	mm
S0179	mm
S0058	mm that's really good
S0179	which one
S0058	the aubergine one
S0179	mm gentle
S0058	mm yeah it be yeah it's nice
S0179	be those two the same
S0058	yeah
S0179	mm
S0058	tzatziki
S0179	mm
S0179	i just wonder why you be go for the one closer to me
S0058	yeah not really sure maybe it look particularly appetizing
S0179	hmm
S0058	you can turn it round mm oh yes er hummus mm wow that's er that's garlicky that one mm
S0179	mm that's different
S0058	that be different taste like it's be homemade rather than
S0179	yeah
S0058	sort of but not like your dad's homemade hummus which be not good i'm not sure exactly what he put in it but it's not um
S0179	no that very nearly put me off hummus for life
S0058	oh right so be that the first
S0179	mm
S0058	huh oh dear i just think maybe he hasn't put um maybe he hasn't put enough garlic and stuff in and it's just chop chickpeas which be fine but not maybe the most
S0179	er to be fair i don't think he put enough sedative into it
S0179	can i have the er half a one of those
S0058	do you wanna whole one
S0179	be you sure
S0058	mhm i might regret that once i've try it
S0179	too late now
S0058	yeah
S0179	mm
S0058	i'll try mine now oh
S0179	from the point of view of actually sort of have it before i eat it yeah that's very wise
S0058	yeah
S0179	mm
S0058	mm
S0179	can i have a couple of pitta bread
S0179	oh it's lovely
S0058	really good
S0179	thank you
S0179	er could we have another couple of pitta bread please
S0058	thank you they be ninety pence each so i think that's perfectly er
S0058	hmm
S0179	mm we may have a little bite leave though i think that's better than have
S0058	yeah well it's just bread
S0179	mm
S0058	but um no i'm glad we order it i i think it would be kind of strange eat it without pitta bread i guess that's the idea you're mean to order some of them
S0179	mm
S0058	mm
S0179	er
S0058	you wouldn't really be able to eat it without pitta bread
S0179	well you just eat it off a fork
S0058	kind of weird though do you not think
S0179	i think you're weird how's the vine leaf
S0058	very nice oh
S0179	yes that be different isn't it
S0058	mm
S0179	mm mm
S0179	it's actually a perfect starter it's not
S0058	mm
S0179	particularly fill
S0058	yeah no it's good i think two would've be stupid we do have a tendency to go for the massive sharey things as in in the past we've do that and then be like oh
S0179	yes i mean be the classic one
S0058	yeah
S0179	the problem be a platter of joy
S0058	it's a problem cos er
S0179	be essentially a meal in itself
S0058	mm it's a problem because if you just have that you sort of feel like you've just be nibble all night
S0179	mm
S0058	but you also really don't wanna main course after it
S0179	mm these be almost too good
S0058	mm
S0179	the problem be with put load of things like potatoes
S0058	yeah exactly it's really stodgy stuff it's not kind of yeah it's potatoes and fry things and
S0179	mm
S0058	wrap you need something
S0179	mm sorry er that's yours
S0058	that's fine
S0179	yeah okay
S0058	eat half of it
S0179	ah dear
S0058	mm
S0179	perfect time
S0058	perfect time yeah
S0058	thank you
S0179	excellent mm
S0058	oh this one's get more herbs in mm
S0179	so have you ring wimpey back about anything recently
S0058	oh damn it i forget to do that today
S0179	no it's just
S0058	mm
S0179	that rubbish be still there
S0058	well she do say
S0179	i'm not sure it's go anywhere
S0058	no well it's not cos i mean the bin men aren't gonna take that
S0179	hmm well they probably don't even know it's there i mean
S0058	i be talk to about this today actually we be moan about neighbour she have noise issue and i be tell her about our bin issue
S0179	sorry well in all fairness they're quite inoffensive it's just sort of
S0058	well yeah i mean as er i
S0179	passively annoy
S0058	that's what i be say like a lot of the you know they're really good to live next to cos they don't make any noise
S0179	mm
S0058	they're quite pleasant when you say hello to them
S0179	seem friendly
S0058	seem friendly enough
S0179	yep
S0058	and they're not really any you know have tiny kid or a big dog or anything you know but it's just this visitor space cause all the issue
S0179	mm
S0058	apparently her she live next to these three massive guy um they're all like into judo and stuff
S0179	right
S0058	apparently they're all massive and then they come in and there's some shout
S0179	yeah
S0058	then there's some sort of thump and then the shout again and then some more thump and she reckon they're wrestle so you can't really go round and be like to three massive wrestlers hi can you keep it down and apparently they're just not sleep which be dreadful
S0179	who aren't sleep sorry
S0058	and her partner from the noise
S0179	how noisy can it be
S0058	well
S0179	and where do she live
S0058	um trumpington
S0179	er right in a flat or a house or what
S0058	i'm not sure um i think a house
S0179	as in do noise come from above below from side to side
S0058	side i think but yeah i'm just it just do make me a bite thankful that we fundamentally have do quite well
S0179	that's why we're detach
S0058	yeah it's very nice
S0179	ah so apparently er you know the garage
S0058	mm
S0179	you know that they've get er two quad bike
S0058	your dad say
S0179	yeah
S0058	that's why they're not use it
S0179	yeah hmm
S0058	mm exactly so they buy a house know they have three cars and that they weren't plan on use their
S0179	plus two quad bike
S0058	one garage pretty bad
S0179	mm
S0058	think they just don't have room for them that's just the fundamental fact of it i dunno what they would've do if there hadn't be that space there
S0179	probably just park on the ooh
S0058	well yeah the
S0179	damn it that almost a good plan um
S0058	mm it's just not good
S0179	i be half tempt to buy a really shit car for about fifty quid
S0058	mhm
S0179	like er a couple of hundred quid and just stick it there
S0058	that's what they've do
S0179	mm well er
S0058	i mean they have we have as much right to it as they do
S0179	well it do move occasionally
S0058	in all fairness i don't think we're allow to put a real car there
S0179	yeah we be provide it's road legal
S0058	oh fair enough
S0179	just declare it statutory off the road
S0058	yeah
S0179	so we don't need to insure it
S0058	mhm sorn as i believe it's call
S0179	yes how the hell do you know that
S0058	theory test
S0179	oh right yeah
S0179	that wasn't in my theory test
S0058	hmm
S0179	they clearly update it
S0058	yeah
S0058	it's all kind of little things like that and you know nothing terribly useful
S0179	nothing to er actually do with drive
S0058	no stuff like um if you be plan a journey where would you go to look for your route online route finder a road atlas the chemist
S0179	yeah i actually get that in my test
S0058	your local mp it's like oh my god the dvla so bad
S0179	hmm i do love that i get his card if you have a problem contact
S0058	yeah oh i've get this persistent rash
S0058	you've get tzatziki in your beard
S0058	get this trail of it
S0179	go
S0058	go
S0179	mm ah this be lovely
S0058	it be really nice
S0179	mm
S0058	mm but yeah so um like i say
S0179	huh
S0058	with me um quite thankful we do have some nice people as in we've make friends
S0179	yes
S0058	which be nice er we don't it's not it's not even that they're fine we've make friends with neighbour
S0179	mm
S0058	so yeah
S0179	mm
S0058	all in all it could be worse
S0179	i think next week like on monday or tuesday we could have a poker night
S0058	mm that'd be nice
S0179	with some drink and card
S0058	sound very pleasant and it's sort of more of a focus as well
S0179	yes
S0058	and then if it dissolve it doesn't matter we'll sit and chat but if it if we need something to kind of get things go
S0179	mm
S0058	it's an excuse isn't it
S0179	and it mean we don't have to do dinner
S0058	yes i don't it's not our turn for dinner be the thing in all fairness we haven't have and
S0179	mm
S0058	but
S0179	no i think it work really good well as a six
S0058	mm it do it do
S0179	rather than er you know
S0058	rather than pair
S0179	mm
S0058	yeah
S0179	just now we feel like we're exclude whoever didn't come
S0058	yeah exactly yeah i think it's interest that we pick out the same er us and and pick out the same kind of group of six
S0179	mm
S0058	they we both like and
S0179	mm
S0058	independently really
S0179	mm
S0058	have say that we first meet them really at and 's
S0179	mm
S0058	as in we speak to them briefly
S0179	mm mm
S0058	but yeah um
S0179	they do solve the cleaner problem beautifully
S0058	oh so good
S0179	i'm so glad
S0058	be it nice
S0179	yes lovely tonight
S0058	good
S0179	bed's make again
S0058	oh
S0179	pillow's be the wrong way up
S0058	she wasn't to know
S0179	it's fairly obvious
S0058	that's the way they're mean to go isn't it
S0179	no it's not
S0058	okay do you want some pitta bread
S0179	no i'm good
S0058	i don't wanna overdo it
S0058	yeah
S0179	i think that's not unreasonable the single most mark up item in any restaurant
S0058	i dunno christmas dinner's pretty er pretty mark up
S0179	yeah but only by a couple of hundred percent as a couple of thousand percent
S0058	mm true yeah i dunno christmas dinner's not expensive to make though that's the point it's all veg
S0179	well turkey be plus you your staff charge a lot
S0058	but it's economies of scale though if you get in er load of massive not terribly expensive turkeys
S0179	mm er true
S0058	the staff be the expensive bite i think probably oh i've get yoghurt on my
S0179	where
S0058	wine glass hmm
S0179	mm
S0058	the music somehow doesn't seem to fit the set
S0179	oh i i think it do it's nice
S0058	pretty relax my parent use to have a a carpet like these ones
S0179	mm
S0058	but it be massive it be basically the size of er well it felt like the size of the live room it be probably much smaller um
S0179	mm
S0058	cos we use to have sort of reddy brown leather settees
S0179	yes you tell me
S0058	and
S0179	that put you off leather
S0058	yeah
S0179	wasn't our settee the perfect choice
S0058	it's a very good choice it's really soften as well
S0179	i know i be so
S0058	there's a bite of a dent where i lean on
S0058	with my elbow though i'm try to smooth it out
S0179	and i be so right wasn't i
S0058	mhm it's a very good sofa i like the fact we can both lie on it
S0179	yeah
S0058	and we can sit independently as in we can be you know don't have to look at each other and talk to each other
S0179	and we can quite comfortably get three people on it
S0058	mm yeah it's not a squeeze at all you can get four on it and that would be a squeeze but you as in for a lot of sofas like get three on would be
S0179	a squeeze
S0179	yeah
S0058	it's quite nice to have that option
S0179	yeah
S0058	i don't think we need a chair
S0058	but yes er
S0058	the answer's in that yeah
S0179	that be er er that be sort of really try to think of a good description
S0179	like perfect as a starter as in it be really tasty but not very er not too heavy it's er
S0058	not too fill yeah
S0179	mm
S0058	really good
S0058	true
S0058	mm
S0058	ooh
S0179	i think we're probably ready
S0058	yeah
S0179	um
S0058	i think we can go for that
S0179	and er wine
S0058	yes what one
S0179	er could we have a bottle of the shiraz please
S0058	thank you
S0058	i'm glad you look
S0179	i'm sorry
S0058	i'm glad you look cos i would've just be like house i do a quick look
S0179	well it be house er in term of red it be house red shiraz or italian red
S0058	so you go for the middle one yeah always the best way
S0058	that's the only way to buy wine
S0179	i think
S0058	yeah i be too mm
S0179	mm um
S0058	there's a little there's a little fire go there
S0179	hmm
S0058	have you see the little fire
S0179	i know it's
S0058	it's really cool isn't it we should get a fire in our kitchen
S0179	sorry
S0058	we should get a fire in our kitchen
S0179	i'm all for it
S0058	an intentional fire little fire
S0179	although i do have a fire extinguisher and a fire blanket i love how the
S0179	my list of things from when we move in
S0058	yeah
S0179	be so comprehensive
S0058	fire blanket in all fairness i'd if there be actually a fire i'd have completely forget about those
S0058	cos they're just in there i forget about them
S0179	mm
S0058	we should mount the fire extinguisher on the wall
S0179	mm
S0058	this be a safe household
S0179	i love how
S0058	we comply with eu regulations
S0179	yes
S0179	i love how when we be before we move in i be really concern about get a safe which be bolt down i've er completely forget it's there actually er it might not still be there
S0179	i probably should check that
S0058	yeah
S0058	that'd be quite funny texts yeah i'm in barbados oh she would never do that
S0179	mm well it's mainly that it's a
S0058	mm yeah
S0179	as in it's er
S0058	i think if yeah it's not you know
S0179	as in what
S0058	it's not the biggest concern i don't think
S0179	passport i suppose
S0058	mm
S0179	it's not anything er that's of much value to anyone but i suppose who be try to nick your identity
S0058	mm
S0179	but
S0058	but if you know someone be try to nick your identity which you would cos the safe would be go it wouldn't be so bad
S0179	exactly
S0058	it'd be the problem be when you don't know someone's nick your identity
S0179	yes
S0179	very clever
S0058	and obviously that's the problem with it but um yeah no i um i'd i'd think it's fine
S0179	mm
S0058	i er yeah i think if they'd get that far we've get bigger problems
S0179	yes
S0058	like er the tv the guitar
S0179	no one would take the guitar
S0058	they probably would it's very portable
S0179	how much be it worth
S0058	five hundred pound case probably another fifty
S0179	fifty for that case really oh
S0058	i get it in with the guitar but it's a nice case it's a hard case so and it's not the top notch one as in you can get ones which be sort of it's a proper proper seal so the the temperature doesn't change and a thermos for your guitar cos it's er the temperature change affect the string and stuff but i didn't need anything like that so it's just um
S0179	well surely that way you'd just get it actively temperature control you could put in a
S0058	mm
S0179	heat pump
S0058	mm
S0179	which would
S0058	you you can probably get them
S0179	mm
S0058	um you can get some really nice kit but yeah
S0179	you can probably get a humidity control as well
S0058	mm well that's the other thing it do it keep the humidity out which be obviously isn't good for the wood
S0179	no i mean like active humidity control as in
S0058	mm
S0179	it won't be good if it's too dry
S0058	wouldn't dry it out but yeah um that'd be um that'd be really you probably can get them that do things like that
S0179	if not
S0058	if you really care
S0179	if not could make one
S0058	if not gap in the market you've get all these good ideas
S0058	ooh
S0179	um
S0058	oh i've still get some gin so do you want to
S0179	er
S0179	er but
S0179	that's very nice
S0058	oh yes thank you
S0179	glad my father's not here i can keep a straight face while do so
S0058	thank you
S0179	mm er well actually um he last night he be on a wine taste course but er
S0179	prior to this he's
S0179	generally er er mercilessly mock anyone who do this um
S0058	if he taste wine he's always like oh
S0058	knock it back it's fine
S0058	yeah
S0058	thank you
S0179	that wine be very very reminiscent of the starter and it's a delicate flavour
S0058	oh right i think you mean garlicky and dippy
S0179	no no just
S0058	dip pitta bread in it no it's good perfect
S0058	as in perfect i really should er i should start write down ones i like cos i always forget like the one i have in alimentum the er one order in alimentum it be really good and i've get no idea what it be but it be so different to any red wine i've have before um
S0179	interest
S0058	but yeah we should ooh sorry be i on your foot then
S0179	yeah
S0058	sorry i think it be the table oh
S0179	no that be just me
S0058	oh it's just you sorry um but yeah let's go for their um their fix menu
S0179	mm
S0058	oh right so i be watch my
S0179	no you have to have the flute of wine to
S0058	the
S0179	the er er the wine that you
S0058	it's not a call a flute of
S0179	flight of win
S0058	flight of win that's it i know it be something like that
S0179	you have to have that
S0058	no no er not if you're get the fix price there's two course for however three course for however much
S0179	oh no no no but you it's gotta be the taste menu
S0058	oh that's a bite different
S0179	mm
S0058	i haven't do that without you that would've be wrong and not exactly the sort of thing for a work christmas do
S0179	what be the taste menu sorry what be the er other one like
S0058	it be very pleasant um they weren't massive portion as in when i when i go to a restaurant i like to feel like i've have a good fee
S0179	yeah
S0058	and i didn't particularly but it be really
S0179	i really can't take you anywhere can i
S0058	you can't but it be
S0179	you just just like a trough
S0058	yeah just fill a bucket with something um no but it be really nice food er it it be you know they could tell they'd do it really well and put a lot of think into it and it be really nice taste and stuff um so i have like belly pork um which be very nice um so yeah it be um very good and it wasn't overprice while there wasn't a lot of food it be very nice
S0179	per unit mass
S0058	per unit mass it be wasn't the cheapest meal um but it be quite good value for what it be you know but yeah if we go let's do the um the ridiculous menu a flight of win sixty pound a head no actually no the the meal be something like sixty five or seventy pound a head and the flight of win be another
S0179	thirty or forty
S0058	thirty or forty on top of that
S0179	and that be a wine with each course
S0058	um yes and they they pair them with the course that's the whole point of it so er cos you might not want one wine to go with your starter and your main course
S0179	yeah
S0058	so the proper people do it like that but i watch er no that's er i be watch masterchef at lunch time and it's really bad it's like you know the episode of the likely lads where they're try to find out not not to try and find out the score
S0179	yes
S0058	cos masterchef's finish and the finalist's be er sorry the winner's be announce but i don't wanna find out until i've er have a chance to watch all the episodes next week so i need to avoid the bbc website um but they basically they be cook in michelin star restaurants and um and then one of them sort of like gordon ramsay's restaurant in london so i think i'd go on and have a look
S0179	mm
S0058	and it's like properly pricey like er they have different level so they have like fix price menu which be however much for three course you know expensive
S0179	
S0058	pff i'm try to remember the price now actually it be something like er forty five pound for three course
S0179	that's not too bad
S0058	which wasn't too for what it be it be quite reasonable and sort of thirty pound for two which er you know very expensive but not horrendous
S0179	no you can
S0058	for the it be really good look stuff you know and then the that be the fix price then they have the la carte
S0179	right
S0058	and then they have like premier and then they have seasonal specials well these be like yeah sort of ninety pound a head for the food look amaze like six yeah seven course probably you could get to around with it it just look incredible
S0179	surely that that's not that expensive
S0058	gordon ramsay
S0179	yeah
S0058	do you fancy have to do that instead of go on holiday instead of a may ball
S0179	yeah
S0058	well that's what always use to say like i'd rather have you can have fun in er in a different way and i think
S0179	which
S0179	oh right
S0058	that's why he always use to go to cos he be like well i'm not pay any more than that because i'll be you you can't have that a hundred pound worth of fun at a may ball so yeah we could um could do that
S0179	i really do want to go to um at a pinch and er at some point
S0058	
S0179	no
S0058	no

S0058	no they'd send it over so it must be some kind of courier and they'd send it over he say do you want it send to your desk and i i think yeah well it'll be here by next week won't it he say oh yeah yeah yep very impressive he'd obviously just go and do it straightaway which be i think that's just the skin from the previous bite sorry
S0179	right
S0058	i haven't try the chili sauce yet
S0179	no neither have i
S0058	fine
S0179	um right
S0058	this might be the worst mistake i ever
S0179	ah
S0058	make i'm not gonna have that much tiny little bite do you think that's too much
S0179	i've literally no idea
S0058	oh that's different

S0058	be you sure that's load have you have enough
S0179	yeah there's some more
S0058	sure you've have enough cos that's like
S0179	mm
S0058	a chicken breast
S0179	i'll take that
S0058	that's very odd
S0179	what
S0058	the chili sauce it's very hot but kind of in a fresh sort of cool way you get the freshness and the coolness and then you get the the heat
S0179	and
S0058	i only have a tiny little bite that's really different it's almost sort of cucumbery mm it's lovely
S0179	mm i think most of the rest of that's yours
S0058	mm do you wanna spoonful
S0179	um yeah okay
S0058	i can't decide which one i like best they're very different
S0179	they work very well in combination this be how we should do a meal like this
S0058	mm yeah i think especially cos we've never have it before
S0179	i like this
S0058	it be much nicer than go oh what's yours like oh it's nice what's yours like
S0179	mm that's how my dad like do indian
S0058	yeah mainly cos he want a try of everyone else's

S0058	it's a different flavour that's the only that's the only information you're get

S0058	ooh um he say um he doesn't mind an early morning just not so keen on the night trek i assume you don't wanna come round mine in the morning instead so we could have a very he couldn't have an early morning because he couldn't
S0179	unless he's gonna get a taxi there's no way
S0058	mm
S0179	we could do it
S0058	yeah i'll i'll
S0179	well do you point out to him that he actually
S0058	or he could cycle there long way from his though before a walk
S0179	do you point out to him that he have actually agree to come to ours
S0058	well i'll i'll say that we're not gonna go and pick him up cos it's just completely the wrong way and if we're gonna have to spend that long drive anyway you don't wanna add half an hour on
S0179	have you point out to him that he have agree to come ours
S0058	no not in so many word but i'm
S0179	well do you want to
S0058	er okay
S0179	as in he do kind of need a firm hand sometimes and i think you know the whole the plan be that it be an integrate er thing
S0058	mm well i mean
S0179	and er i think it er would in some a lot of ways it would be better with four on saturday night than three
S0058	mm but
S0179	well er it's not acceptable just to ditch
S0058	mm
S0058	ooh i don't have much space leave
S0058	but i'm gonna go for a persian tea
S0058	mm do you recommend it with both or
S0058	just as it's
S0058	cos i do like cinnamon

S0058	um
S0058	er
S0058	mm
S0058	okay so with just
S0058	persian tea with cinnamon

S0179	so yeah er that so that doesn't annoy you or
S0058	yeah
S0179	well what be you plan on do about it
S0058	it just seem to me that maybe have a chat to him when he's here there everywhere wherever
S0179	er a chat to him er say what
S0058	might be nice not to just assume that we'll do whatever at that we'll always be there kind of wait you know might be nice to be a bite more of a priority in term of keep us in the loop the fact i didn't reply to the text should've be enough
S0179	should've be enough
S0058	as in that he send a text to me which i didn't get the fact i didn't reply should've be enough for him to send it again or or bring that up he just clearly wasn't too bother about that
S0179	er when be this
S0058	i don't know it must've be after last sunday but before thursday so oh er maybe it be thursday afternoon or something
S0179	mm
S0058	but i it be a bite er it'd be a bite yeah be nicer not to feel that like yeah sort of we'll just fit in with whatever he's do
S0179	well why didn't you tell him that in the text
S0058	cos i don't really like do that by text it's er i find it far easier to have that kind of conversation if you can get body language and read it properly and
S0179	oh well then make sure it happen
S0058	yeah
S0179	well er er in your role as
S0058	mm
S0179	i don't think you're do very well
S0058	and next time
S0179	what
S0058	and next time who else might like a walk um be a fan of the walk
S0179	who
S0058	from work he look like he might be a man who's a fan of the walk as a mode of transport he look like a man who'd be fond of the disused railway as a form of transport
S0179	um i don't think he's actively in favour of it
S0058	oh okay
S0179	nor indeed against it
S0058	i just feel the need to get to know better after the that's the badger incident
S0179	what huh
S0058	after the that's the badger incident when you're next give him a lift i'll have to record him again
