S0509	yeah
S0510	what about
S0509	er i've get one on a room with a view and

S0510	so when do they have to be in
S0509	erm one of them have to be in on thursday but the rest the don't have to be in till next week
S0510	right
S0509	but i want to get start on my english literature one cos it's go to be long
S0510	the the one about room with a view
S0509	it's like a thousand word yeah
S0510	well what's the premise of the essay then
S0509	i've get to talk about the main character lucy
S0510	oh right okay
S0509	yeah
S0510	didn't you do an essay on room with a view before
S0509	no
S0510	what be the one you have to do in the holiday before you actually start the course
S0509	oh yeah well that wasn't it be a little bite on the first chapter but it wasn't much of an essay
S0510	oh right just a little taster
S0509	yeah
S0510	yeah mm well you kind of enjoy all of that analysis stuff once you get into it don't you
S0509	yeah yeah yeah yeah
S0510	i guess it's a
S0509	it'll just be a bite of a long slog
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	but erm what be i go to say oh yeah i get my erm my drama grade back for my induction task so i get erm bs and cs which be fine and like i do this
S0510	great
S0509	the the essay that i do i get a b in and she say that she have like she have no concern about get my write work up to an a and she say she think
S0510	terrific
S0509	we can get my cos obviously my target grade be an a
S0510	mm
S0509	she say that she think she we can get my practical work up to an a as well but i will need to really work for that and i be like oh i'm will to do that yeah
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	but erm yeah she be talk about a thing call to heighten naturalism which she think i'm suit to and which i think i'm suit to which be
S0510	
S0509	it's a style of act isn't worth explain it
S0510	alright so what naturalistic but sort of a bite caricature
S0509	no
S0510	the heighten bite or not
S0509	no not really cos caricature be the opposite of naturalism so
S0510	well i guess so yeah
S0509	yeah
S0509	heighten naturalism
S0510	that be a bite of a dichotomy there
S0509	yeah
S0510	yeah
S0509	you know naturalism would just be like act how you would naturally respond to a situation
S0510	mm hm yeah
S0509	heighten naturalism you kind of take erm certain eh naturalistic aspects of your character
S0510	mm
S0509	and you kind of instead of try to portray a more a a character with load of depth you take the kind of important bits of them and portray those naturalistically
S0510	right
S0509	and like the rebecca that we go to see that be kind of heighten naturalism
S0510	ah okay
S0509	cos it it be kind of naturalistic in it in the way that it serve the story and it be a naturalistic story and sort of it it wasn't always sort of oh pantomime or whatever obviously there be bits with like physical theatre and that which aren't naturalistic
S0510	yeah
S0509	but their voice and that wasn't unnaturalistic
S0510	mm hm
S0509	but it wasn't really naturalism cos it didn't really like feel empathy for the character that make sense
S0510	mm
S0509	it's it's yeah i i get the feel you maybe don't quite get it but
S0510	no i'm just think further really and deeper i suppose just you know think about most things that you see you know be in in term of a stage play or you know a tv series or whatever aren't they all go for a naturalistic approach because they're try to erm convey something naturally rather than you know any other way really so it it it it kind of
S0510	i mean be i wrong or what
S0509	naturalism be the predominant style but you you probably in in tv it definitely be
S0510	yeah aha
S0509	but then you've get melodrama and things which you have on tv and you have comedy things which aren't do naturalistically cos it's overplay and eh archetypal
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	and then lot of theatre be non naturalistic and there's lot of theatre style that you probably don't see very often but they do exist and might have be bigger in their time
S0510	right okay
S0509	but yeah
S0510	in yeah i i guess what i'm say be be that not like the baseline anyway naturalistic okay i get what you're say about different style like comedy you know where you're go to
S0509	no yeah no but do you remember me tell you about berkoff
S0510	yeah
S0509	yeah and that's like there's stuff like that that's just completely different from naturalism
S0510	mm mm
S0509	it's just yeah cos it's all about the way you in which you choose to portray a message and at the moment naturalism be how they normally do it probably cos it's the easiest as well
S0510	mm yeah cos it's what you we all relate to it's it's our everyday isn't it
S0509	yeah yeah but some of the other ones be more interest erm yeah
S0510	mm
S0509	cos i have to write an essay compare stanislavsky who sort of erm create the most rigorous er act system for naturalism and berkoff who do total theatre which be all the very different one
S0510	mm
S0509	and i have to kind of cos berkoff be try to portray a message by just erm i can't explain it but by unseat you and and cos the thing with naturalism it's
S0510	yeah
S0509	it be the stuff you see everyday
S0510	yeah
S0509	whereas berkoff be like so different from what you see day
S0510	mm
S0509	but not necessarily then untrue
S0510	right
S0509	it's not untrue it's just
S0510	right mm
S0509	it can be more representative of within yourself
S0510	right
S0509	and how and like how
S0510	hm yeah
S0509	you can combine kind of the mean of what you're say
S0510	mm
S0509	not just through what you're say but how you say it
S0510	mm
S0509	it like the tone and the pitch and all these other things
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	and that because that's kind of unseat and be more within
S0510	yeah yeah
S0509	it it can portray a message even better sometimes
S0510	sure yeah i guess that's the thing as well think about it with with naturalism you know our everyday whatever we only put on the face that we want other people to see and what be sort of like the socially construct sort of norms of the day and how you should behave and all the rest of it and we kind of almost put it through a filter if you like before it come out of our head you know whereas
S0509	aha
S0510	it in i don't know whether berkoff focus on this or whether i'm completely off the mark but you know in order for me to be have this conversation with you in the in between bits i will have be think certain things
S0509	yeah
S0510	that you may never hear but they may be completely crazy and off the wall and
S0509	yeah
S0510	or i might be suppress stuff that you don't actually get to hear or or see
S0509	yeah berkoff isn't quite like that although there probably be a style like that
S0510	mm
S0509	cos there's other style and there's another type of theatre i think it's brecht
S0510	oh yeah that name ring a bell yeah
S0509	oh really erm and that be all about erm highlight the of the theatre and reveal to you you know the disillusion you and just you will see er prop and erm costume change will take place onstage in your full view
S0510	oh okay
S0509	and er the light will just be harsh and brighten up into distraction and that all the way through
S0510	mm
S0509	scene change will happen with like full light on
S0510	so more reveal of the inner yeah
S0509	yeah of theatre and kind of disconnect you then
S0510	mm mm
S0509	and sort of show you that it's all an illusion which be another interest one
S0510	get you yeah yeah
S0509	mm
S0510	oh so that's brecht be it
S0509	yeah brecht
S0510	mm
S0509	i want to say that that's total theatre but it's not can't think what that's call
S0510	mm mm anyway i've forget how we get here oh yes about your drama teacher say that you're more suit erm
S0509	to heighten naturalism
S0510	right okay
S0509	which be good so yeah and er they kind of they've move a few people from class to class now to kind of get cos there's a couple of different a level class
S0510	right
S0509	to sort of get better group dynamics or whatever or make sure people who be go to be work in a certain way be all kind of together
S0510	oh okay
S0509	so they're do that a bite even though there's quite like there's quite a few people in our class who don't like do naturalism
S0510	mm
S0509	like there's a few girls who like play the comedy part and like the men and that
S0510	right
S0509	er yeah and do all that
S0510	what so girls that like play men sort of in the shakespearian sort of mould
S0509	yeah cos like
S0510	victorian mould as well
S0509	just just er in in a more comedy way they like to play character that be completely remove from themselves
S0510	oh okay yeah
S0509	sort of thing
S0510	yeah
S0509	erm use to be like that she'd be like i feel more comfortable play a man
S0510	right
S0509	cos it's just cos it's separate from yourself i guess
S0510	mm
S0509	you don't feel
S0510	mm
S0509	like you're put yourself out there too much i don't mind i don't care
S0510	right yeah
S0509	oh the other thing be erm there's they're go to have a poetry by heart competition at the college where you have to recite one or two poems
S0510	mm
S0509	erm in mid november from this list i need to look it up and then they choose one winner to go on to perform at like a i don't know whether it's a regional or national competition then
S0510	mm
S0509	which be cool so i'm go to do that
S0510	oh great
S0509	but i need to get in contact with my teacher but i just think of that that's another performance thing
S0510	performance thing sorry i must have miss
S0509	recite poetry
S0510	oh the recital aspect right
S0509	yeah
S0510	ah great oh well
S0509	and you know you've get to do it from memory
S0510	yeah well you love that aspect of it don't you
S0509	yeah
S0510	the performance side
S0509	oh yeah
S0510	yeah
S0509	mm
S0510	oh that'll be good
S0509	yeah it will
S0510	be there much opportunity in in your class at the moment for within the course framework for poetry be that
S0509	which which course
S0510	erm english literature
S0509	we do a whole unit on poetry
S0510	so so there be then yeah
S0509	we're do ted hughes yeah
S0510	right okay
S0509	you don't you don't write you don't write
S0510	you don't write that's kind of what i mean really you know you're
S0509	yeah you there's no write in english literature and you don't you don't write anything creatively for yourself or
S0510	be that all in the language
S0509	you just commentate on things
S0510	right
S0509	just yeah it's not even that much in language i think there might be one bite in there
S0510	really yeah
S0509	of coursework in the second year and then you have to do a commentary of your own work
S0510	right
S0509	yeah you've get to do ah i don't know if it's a a descriptive piece of write or something and then you have to commentate on your own choices of language in your own work
S0510	mm
S0509	which sound horrible
S0509	but no english literature be only analyse a text it's nothing more than that only ever analyse
S0510	mm hm mm so in your free time you might do a bite of ah of poetry a of a write then
S0509	yeah there's a creative write enrichment but i can't go to it cos it's when my drama my drama enrichment yeah
S0509	i know only one person go to it at the moment
S0510	oh goodness me
S0509	yeah i be like ah that's sad
S0510	oh maybe they have to run another you know another time day for it
S0509	no they won't cos nearly all the enrichments be at the same time
S0510	oh be they
S0509	yeah
S0510	right mm
S0509	yeah might be able to next year
S0510	so what have you get what have you get go on with enrichments
S0509	i have to do drama enrichment
S0510	that be it's just that
S0509	that's ah yeah i have to it's compulsory if i'm do drama i have to do drama enrichment because it's such a practical course
S0510	mm
S0509	and it's harder for you you know you've get to do your hours of independent study in each subject a week
S0510	yeah
S0509	well those two hours count as two hours of drama independent study and it mean that we can do our practical then
S0510	ah right yeah cos otherwise that could get tricky couldn't it mm mm
S0509	yeah
S0510	but how about the gift and talented erm stuff that you be look into over the summer be that the enrichment stuff or be that something completely different
S0509	i don't know that there be a gift and talented thing apart from i think it's just do you mean the drama gift and talented
S0510	no no i do just mean any gift and talented start
S0509	i think it's just
S0510	be it yeah
S0509	from when i've look at their website it's just really
S0510	mm but you're also look at other enrichments as well weren't you you weren't just look well i know you you're have to do drama but you be look at what their enrichment program be so
S0509	yeah and they be all at the same time
S0510	be there no way out of that
S0509	no you see you only get one
S0510	i think you get you know choice
S0509	you can do more than one but they have to be at different time
S0510	and and there aren't any on at different time
S0509	well there be some but none that i'm interest in to be honest
S0510	oh okay there we be
S0509	yeah
S0510	mm
S0509	or i think even if they be at different time they all go and have other lessons anyway
S0510	mm lovely
S0509	yeah
S0510	that's a shame but there we go
S0509	mm
