S0619	but he's nice he say it be okay he high fived me
S0618	it be difficult though isn't if you're gonna have a workout i'm remember this from dim and distant memory
S0618	but if you're gonna have a workout and you haven't eat enough but you know that before you go so you want to eat but then you end up want to boke while you're exercise
S0619	yeah yeah so it's you know er try to eat erm

S0619	mm
S0618	so i mix up some oats in my smoothie and oh my god i nearly throw up quite a few time it be really hard go
S0619	yeah

S0619	road fairy
S0618	road fairies be pretty cool i like that
S0619	er yes

S0618	there might be some slippery bits or skiddy bits or bits where lorries need to go a bite slower
S0619	yeah i don't know if it be or if it be just er oh i don't know
S0618	well there's one just back there which i imagine be every time someone pull in or out of the car park
S0619	yeah possibly
S0618	as we've just do that's bind to hold traffic up a little bite cos it only take one car to brake and come to a stop to let somebody in and
S0619	yeah or turn leave
S0618	uhu and then there's a massive queue behind so
S0619	yeah
S0618	anyway erm simon say we'll be there at ten to three so another forty minutes

S0618	oh okay
S0619	sorry
S0618	that's alright
S0619	er you know i'm so use to it now that i've forget that it's there
S0618	i know
S0619	i feel like i don't need to talk because it's i just forget about it
S0618	yeah pros and con you know it's it's we're probably get much more natural conversation cos we forget it's there
S0619	yes
S0618	but at the same time

S0619	no i've not
S0618	it's a polish thing
S0619	it's an interest car to have
S0618	mm i think it's chrysler anyway a similar logo if not
S0619	yeah
S0618	that's an american make i think
S0619	big car big wheel
S0618	not that big
S0618	what have you be drive
S0619	er toyota yaris
S0618	oh say no more
S0619	yes
S0618	yeah
S0619	but i haven't drive for five years six years
S0618	oh my god you need to do that thing
S0619	er
S0618	do you not do it when you go on holiday hire a car
S0619	no
S0619	don't do it when i go to england erm should but i don't know i'd have to have drive lessons again i've get such bad anxiety now about drive myself
S0618	ah
S0619	and this be exactly what my mum do she learn to drive when she be in her twenties and then didn't drive until she be forty something
S0618	mm
S0619	and she have to have lessons
S0618	same with my dad
S0619	and i imagine that's what's gonna happen to me er it doesn't help that i'm never in the country erm or never you know
S0618	yeah
S0619	er i mean i wouldn't wanna drive abroad anyway
S0618	so actually you could just forget about that now forget about the anxiety and just say
S0619	start again
S0618	i be not a driver
S0619	yes i can't drive
S0618	and then if at some point where your life situation circumstances make you think oh i'd like to drive again
S0619	yeah
S0618	get some lessons then
S0619	it be you know i really want to do it last summer
S0618	mm
S0619	but i just simply wasn't
S0618	what to drive to go place
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	or just to sort of drive myself around the town
S0618	yeah
S0619	see my friends or whatever erm
S0618	i've gotta say poland isn't easy
S0619	no yeah
S0618	erm it be if you think erm if you kind of get in your head nobody's think anything about me nobody's judge me and once you get that in your head you're fine you can get on and drive but but there be like i be say to you before you expect it on motorways you pull out to overtake at the last possible minute and you get in again at the
S0619	yeah
S0618	at the the first available opportunity so you're kind of cut vehicles up as you're pull in and you're almost sometimes pull out in front of people but that be expect
S0619	mm
S0618	so you know i kind of feel sometimes i'm drive like a dickhead but that's
S0619	yeah it's normal
S0618	it's expect that's the culture that's the custom so really in just be in rome and do as the romans do but it be pretty anxiety induce sometimes
S0619	mm
S0618	so no probably not the best country
S0619	no
S0618	i don't think the spanish be much better be they little crazy drive a little fast
S0619	i wouldn't yeah i wouldn't drive abroad erm anywhere er but i really want to
S0618	i recommend ireland ireland's really chill
S0619	yeah i
S0618	north and south
S0619	really just need to start drive in england but you know last summer when i be at home i be like right this be the year
S0618	mm
S0619	and i just wasn't there enough to
S0618	mm
S0619	warrant get lessons or pay for insurance
S0618	yeah
S0618	and there's not much point if you're gonna leave the country again
S0619	yeah exactly so but i really want to do it just for me more than anything else
S0618	yeah
S0619	but be not to be
S0618	it will come back it's a bite like the ski there's a big degree of muscle memory i think er
S0619	yeah
S0618	once you start make your body perform those manoeuvre as it be it erm
S0619	uhu
S0618	become unconscious again pretty quickly
S0619	yeah
S0619	i be say that to this morning
S0618	mm
S0619	things i just need to learn how to how to do it
S0618	mm
S0619	or my body need to understand what it's suppose to do
S0618	yeah
S0619	mm and it's not that something's particularly heavy or particularly difficult it's just i'm not use to do it so
S0618	yeah so yeah it feel a little alien to your body perhaps
S0619	mm yeah i just need some practice
S0618	hang on a minute this look like my turn off
S0619	uhu
S0618	this look like the junction where i would normally turn right
S0619	ah so you've be here before
S0618	mm erm isn't it funny i don't remember ever see that restaurant we've just be to
S0619	ah
S0618	probably because it's not
S0619	yeah it's i guess
S0618	in my expectations or anything
S0619	yeah
S0618	this be really pretty oh light's green now i be gonna take a photograph out of my window
S0619	yeah i think there would be traffic light
S0618	see father christmas there
S0619	oh bless
S0618	oh erm my neighbour in have one of those and when i first move there it be just so lovely cos you'd look out of the the bedroom window or the front window and there's just this father christmas blow out in the gales
S0618	wave at you it's just really nice and they have a wooden rudolph and his sleigh as well that be about ten feet from leave to right and er yeah that be all light up it be really nice
S0619	right now we're through those light we might
S0618	which be why we have before
S0619	yeah we might cos it be so sort of consistently stop and start wasn't it
S0618	yeah
S0619	erm claw back some time
S0618	you're hilarious
S0619	i'm just obsess
S0618	your obsession with time it doesn't exist there's nothing to claw back
S0619	no i know
S0618	ah
S0619	i can't help it
S0618	i'm kind of at the stage in life now as well where if i'm run late and i say to someone oh i'm sorry run late if i think i'm gonna be there at five past i'll message and say oh i'll see you about quarter past and then i just really relax and don't drive like a dickhead
S0619	mm
S0618	and the person the other end isn't anxiously look out of the window or whatever if people do that sort of thing i don't know
S0619	mm
S0618	erm yeah and it and i kind of think well late be late so whether it's five minutes or fifteen minutes it's still late so
S0619	mm
S0618	you might as well just be late in a relax kind of a way
S0619	i can't er i hate be late
S0618	but would you rather
S0619	yeah i'd rather
S0618	rush around like an idiot and get there at five past or three minutes past and still be late
S0619	mm
S0618	but be all anxious and stress
S0619	it depend who er or what i'm do
S0618	mm
S0619	what who i'm meet i suppose but you know in the mornings i hate rush
S0618	yeah me too
S0619	er and in the mornings before work i would much rather wake up at i don't know six fifteen to start work at eight fifteen
S0618	yeah
S0619	and just really casually have a shower
S0618	yeah
S0619	eat something
S0618	yeah
S0619	and do a bite of preparation er
S0618	drink tea
S0619	drink tea maybe watch something or listen to something
S0618	read a book yeah
S0619	er rather than
S0618	yeah
S0619	see this be me wake up at six fifteen and do whatever
S0618	last minute clean teeth wash dress out
S0619	whereas yeah whereas if we he he be start at eight he wouldn't leave his bedroom until sort of twenty five to
S0619	er er er have a shower
S0618	and he's still get a ten minute walk wow
S0619	yeah have a shower get dress
S0618	that's impressive
S0619	and go
S0618	mm
S0619	but i just can't not eat in the mornings still wake up hungry every morning
S0618	you wow
S0619	yeah so that's
S0618	that's good yeah i think you're do magnificently you really seem to be feel on a buzz and
S0618	what
S0619	that's where we're go oh no it's not
S0618	where be we go
S0619	there's a swim pool there
S0618	oh go there then
S0619	look like a nice hotel
S0618	oh shit i forget my swim goggle ah
S0619	yeah i i've not get any here i couldn't find any when i be leave england
S0618	oh well
S0619	never mind
S0618	oh what's the limit here i'm just go extra slow cos of that speed camera everyone else go extra slow okay erm
S0618	yeah no i have get some here
S0619	mm
S0618	but actually no i don't really like swim that much i use to go i use to go a lot it's funny in different phase that you have in life when my partner be really sick with cancer and i be still go to work every day rather than come home faff about and go to the gym of an even
S0619	mm
S0618	i use to bunk off work quite a bite actually i use to say i'm go to this shop in this part of the country and maybe i would go but maybe i'd leave an hour before i be really mean to or they think i be
S0619	mm
S0618	and then i'd go to the gym in on the way home and go for a swim erm or go and run cos i be run at that point before my knees completely give up
S0619	mm
S0618	and yeah i find it really necessary to have that time and that space and when i be in england with my mum and her cancer and go between her flat and the hospice a lot i be forever get groupon deal for local gyms to go and run
S0619	yeah
S0618	and it just seem so necessary to have that outlet for myself and that time that be selfish time
S0619	mm mm mm
S0618	for me and nobody else
S0619	yep
S0618	really really necessary
S0619	and you know it's so good for you too
S0618	mm it's all them dolphins innit
S0619	yeah
S0619	endorphins and i know people sort of say oh it's so cathartic it's therapeutic you know you get out all of your anger and stress and you think well i don't really know if i agree with that but
S0618	mm
S0619	i agree with you're do something on a regular basis in which you be try to improve you know
S0618	mm
S0619	and over time you will because that's how that's how the the human body work
S0618	mm
S0619	you know you'll be able to go faster or lift something else up and that be i think good for your mind
S0618	yeah that's interest
S0619	set goals and meet them
S0618	i don't do that
S0619	mm
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah well that's
S0618	different personality type i suppose
S0619	yeah that's how i sort of er see it i don't really like erm competition necessarily with other people cos i'm not very good and i don't usually win anything
S0619	but with myself i'm excellent
S0618	yeah
S0619	yes
S0618	no i just like to go because it feel good
S0619	mm
S0618	and i like i use to get to that point with run where i felt i could run forever
S0619	mm
S0618	and it just felt so good
S0619	what sort of distance
S0618	i use to only do i use to do five k
S0619	mm
S0618	so three miles in about thirty eight minutes
S0619	mm
S0618	or forty minutes
S0619	mm
S0618	erm which be incredibly slow but i didn't care
S0619	yeah if you like
S0618	yeah i i think oh shit i think i be gonna stall then erm yeah i think i'm just generally a slow lay back take it easy kind of a person
S0619	mm
S0618	and even in my movement and my doeyness i'm it's very unusual i just don't get that
S0619	mm
S0618	rush that some people get with their exercise oh what's for sale here it look like my fire extinguisher man oh no it's sock
S0619	oh it's regional sock and cheese
S0618	oh and where's the cheese
S0619	in that little cabin
S0618	oh cool yeah
S0619	sock and cheese
S0619	a win combination get a lot of pass trade
S0618	yeah what more do you need yeah
S0619	erm
S0618	so yeah i just it's all i don't get that with a workout i i get a buzz and i get high from it but in a still in a chill out kind of a way
S0619	mm
S0618	just in a almost a floaty kind of a way yeah yeah spin class i love spin bike class
S0619	mm
S0618	but i mean in my arse end of nowhere gym there be two type of instructor it's usually the young men erm who every track whether it's a hill track or a sprint track be bloody fast
S0619	mm
S0618	and it be always a faster faster faster and i use to think fuck off fuck off fuck off
S0618	i'll go at my own speed and i use to get a bite stubborn then and
S0619	yeah
S0618	go really slow and not enjoy it and then it be usually women erm not always older women but often older women run the spin class that lull you into a false sense of security with make sure you warm through properly at the begin you might have a run track erm rather than sprint
S0619	mm
S0618	and you just kind of warm into it gradually and within about twenty minutes i'd be work incredibly hard and i'd be knackered
S0619	mm
S0618	how do you get me to do that without you know scream and shout and do all of that
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah
S0619	with spin
S0618	business
S0619	i use to sort of i use to go spin erm when i be at uni and i'd look at the clock and it'd be like quarter past i'd be like fuck i've get to do this for another thirty minutes i'm gonna die
S0618	yeah
S0619	i'm not gonna make it and we yeah when i use to go to the gym and do erm you know all these condition class or whatever
S0618	mm
S0619	and there be this trainer call this be in last year and she be brutal she be the fittest strongest woman i've ever see
S0618	mm
S0619	you know huge muscle and really kind of great body erm and i've speak to her about her body once and she say that she hat it and she hat that she she always want to wear a jacket or cover her arm or
S0618	oh my goodness
S0619	er and people
S0618	yeah
S0619	star at her
S0618	well they probably do in poland
S0619	yeah
S0618	maybe less so in england
S0619	cos it's just a different type of body
S0618	yeah
S0619	cos people be so slim erm but no good for her it's like well i'd do anything to sort of well i be do some things to get that sort of body
S0618	mm yeah
S0619	erm i want to ideally i want to look like someone who could beat you up in a fight
S0619	i'll never be able to beat anyone up in a fight i'd be crap but if i look oh i'm not gonna mess with her she look like she
S0618	you strike me more a lover than a fighter
S0619	i be absolutely yeah
S0619	but i really want to give the impression of
S0618	why
S0619	i just think that's the sort of ideal body that i want someone who's you know sort of not tough look
S0618	who could potentially get violent
S0619	no that's not i'm not really phrase this very well
S0619	just to look fit and to look strong erm
S0618	yeah i understand that yeah
S0619	and a body that look like it can handle you know handle itself or handle
S0618	the rigours of life
S0619	handle
S0618	the rigours of teach english as a foreign language
S0619	yeah
S0618	ah dear yeah
S0619	mm
S0619	i think that's rather a male thing that men wouldn't actually sort of articulate which be you know you're look you wanna look big so no one mess with you
S0618	mm
S0619	er but i don't think
S0619	i'm really say that
S0618	meatheads
S0619	i wanna be a meathead
S0618	you want to be a meathead
S0619	i say to i'm so bore of men in the gym and he be like i be a man in the gym
S0619	i be like i know but
S0618	yeah use to get a lot of those at
S0619	hate them
S0618	the i know the type that you mean look like they're possibly not so articulate be probably
S0619	that's very kind
S0618	i know possibly a fair bite of grunt go on
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah but yeah i know what you mean
S0619	mm and they're just in the way
S0618	yeah
S0619	have get no manners it's really funny in gyms here a man'll come in and before he do anything he go round to every other man in the gym and shake their hand
S0618	yeah
S0619	yeah
S0618	oh my goodness
S0619	it's not you know before it before he can start
S0618	wow
S0619	erm yeah so sometimes they do like a full loop you know before they begin properly whereas with girls they just ignore them they don't even look at me it's like i don't exist er
S0618	i'm just tempt to join your gym just so i can come and shake your hand
S0619	yeah in
S0618	yo sister
S0619	in i get so sick of it i'd always just be like shall i stick my hand out when someone be come past
S0618	do you and make them shake your hand
S0619	and see if they'd shake it
S0618	do they
S0619	yeah
S0619	they er look like alarm

S0619	oh
S0618	metal where it's not really a seat it's just metal
S0619	yeah in really sort of shitty public toilets so you
S0618	yeah
S0619	make yeah
S0618	so want to take a guess as to what the speed limit might be i just haven't a clue
S0619	i don't know
S0618	there's a picture of silhouette build with a cross through it
S0619	so maybe it's a
S0618	so it's either seventy or ninety yeah i think it's seventy or ninety i'll do seventy where'd all the traffic go
S0619	i don't know it's rather suspicious isn't it
S0618	that's weird but this be gorgeous i like this it's so pretty
S0619	yeah it look a little bite brighter here doesn't it
S0618	mm yeah i just suppose it's cos of all of the snow as much as anything oh sixty thank you
S0619	be a good guess
S0618	no that's just for round the bend i think
S0619	sorry do do do do
S0618	oh have we gotta turn leave up here what's erm simon say oh
S0619	no no it's just say follow the bend
S0618	go round the bend
S0619	yep
S0618	and then another seventeen k before we think about do anything
S0619	yes so it's all come together
S0618	yeah
S0619	i just keep read about my nose and what's happen now be the capillaries or whatever be really swell so that's why i'm so congest but hopefully soon soon soon soon
S0618	can you build a picture in your mind as to what your nasal passages will look like in six months time when
S0619	i'm not really sure what what nasal passages look like
S0618	or a week or whatever
S0619	but if i just keep visualize i don't know i think like a waterfall be what i'm think of and just like this sort of gush water that be clear everything out
S0618	okay so that's what you're want in the interim then i can join you in this creative visualisation if you like
S0619	just think about
S0618	we'll just imagine your nose gush but then
S0619	no not actually gush but just this sort of clear out
S0618	okay
S0619	it's very symbolic in my life at the moment clear out
S0618	like a sort of like a well exactly it be and i always say this
S0619	like nose like love life clear out
S0618	be where things er always last manifest
S0619	yeah
S0618	so yeah your nose will be perfectly clear when you've have a good clear out on the emotional and spiritual level
S0619	yep
S0618	yeah and because it's to do with the breath erm and it come back to lungs again it's lung chi and spleen chi
S0619	what do the spleen do
S0618	i think that be all incorporate in the lung thing do you remember
S0619	yeah yeah yeah
S0618	the photocopy or photograph
S0619	yeah
S0618	yeah it's cool so it's all about your boundaries erm
S0619	yes
S0618	and the give and take in life so at the moment you've still get all of this in so if you're want to be visualise this stream nose then that's get everything out get all of the toxic substances out
S0619	yeah
S0618	the toxic emotions the toxic whatever so i imagine your nose will piss like niagara fall for a day or two and then it'll be clear as the swiss alps
S0619	air
S0618	or something
S0618	yeah
S0619	good good good
S0618	yay oh we're get high
S0619	get high get more
S0618	er that's cos it's on there oh yes it be on
S0619	do do do do careful slippy
S0618	so what
S0618	be that
S0619	slippy
S0618	slippiness okay

S0618	yeah
S0619	and sort of look out the window
S0618	no i i've just get this steam idea in my head i haven't have a steam since probably july or august probably july realistically speak
S0619	i think this'll be really good for me in term of get stuff out toxins and that
S0618	oh yeah yeah definitely and steam's incredibly good for that i be good friends with the a woman who use to work in one of the gyms that my northern ireland card erm work for and and so actually i think i have a cold that wasn't shift or something like that so i be want to steam it out and so i'd just send her a text and she would ring the gym and get them to change the menthol thing that they put through the pipe
S0619	oh nice
S0618	so it's all nice and really strong and i'd say i'll be down about three and then by the time i get there it's really pump out the menthol eucalyptus that be perfect
S0619	nice
S0618	really perfect no i miss her she's a really nice woman she have a campervan as well erm but she's funny because we're we're both quite similar in a way we've be on campervan adventure but we've both take our own vans and follow each other
S0618	it's like she like her space and i like my space
S0619	yeah
S0618	and i suppose things can get a little bite intimate in a campervan
S0619	uhu
S0618	and er you know i know her well enough to share a small bed with her it wouldn't be a problem erm but yeah i suppose you just yeah also i like my van

S0618	no no there be no signpost so i it be easter i think it might even've be easter sunday drive in rural and just i stop and ask somebody do you know where these stand stone be and they point me to the correct field but look a bite confuse and it be only afterwards that say you know it's easter sunday and they'd just come out of chapel have have you know one of the most holy mass of the year
S0619	yeah
S0618	and you you pagan be ask where the stone be the stand stone
S0619	that's lovely
S0618	so but i could get away with a lot be english that she couldn't be irish so
S0619	i wouldn't you know be english i wouldn't want to be from anywhere else
S0618	i think it open doors
S0619	yeah
S0618	and it can close them a bite as well sometimes
S0619	yes
S0618	yeah i have a guy i work with in northern ireland erm part of my role be to help a charitable organisation be more profitable and i'd only just arrive and say hi how be you to everybody and this older guy come up to me and say and you can just fuck off because i be english
S0619	oh my god
S0619	yeah in when i live in scotland and work in scotland do say stuff to me
S0618	mm
S0619	say someone once call me a wee english tart
S0618	that's fantastic
S0619	well you be correct on all count
S0618	what be you do later

S0618	that's brilliant ah dear
S0619	i don't really mind
S0618	no i use to get a lot of friendly abuse from my friends in northern ireland
S0619	yeah yeah friendly abuse as well
S0618	you know from the
S0619	get back over your own side
S0618	the trouble and yeah and i work for a catholic organisation and live in a catholic community
S0619	mm
S0618	so even not be a christian i be still the prod
S0619	mm mm
S0618	and then at work they use to joke sometimes to say right cultural diversity oi prod girl what do you think to this and then ask me a question and get my view on whatever so
S0619	mm
S0618	yeah i suppose i could of perceive it as workplace bully but
S0618	instead i'd quite often tell them to fuck off so it be fine
S0618	be you really hot still
S0619	i'm no my temperature's fine i'm just
S0618	okay
S0619	this window's go a bite steamy
S0618	steamy you've get your own erm yellow and blue thing down there
S0618	in fact you've get the clean one and i've get the dirty one so you can have my dirty one if you wanna
S0619	yeah
S0618	give it a wipe in fact poor she's filthy so she be she really need a bloody good clean erm i dunno there's just something about the design of this particular model of volkswagen where and actually i have a honda accord that be just the same that you get shite on the outside of the windows so you can't see out your mirror
S0619	yeah
S0618	you'd think well you'd think they'd've test that in the aerodynamic tunnel thing at the testy place to
S0619	yeah
S0618	i don't know put some mud through it on occasion to see where it end up
S0619	mm
S0618	it's like a little winter wonderland here i think the difference between here and be there be a lot more snow stick to the tree
S0619	yeah it look great doesn't it
S0618	mm
S0619	what time be leave as erm after she'd be to yours
S0618	yeah i think she'd call at mine a little bite before nine
S0619	uhu okay
S0618	pick up her helmet and goggle and come away
S0619	oh good she's just lovely
S0618	she's so lovely isn't she
S0619	she's just perfect
S0618	yeah
S0619	at everything
S0618	i wonder though i see a lot of this with polish women in particular and i suppose i be quite like that myself and i do wonder if it's a female thing be have to be ten time better than anybody else to get the same recognition that an average man get
S0619	mm
S0618	and whether there's any truth in that or whether that's just a perception
S0619	mm
S0618	i don't know and it be weird be magnificent and be the best in england
S0619	mm
S0618	you know business things and make shed load of money and take unprofitable shop and make them profitable and blah blah blah and do really great and then
S0618	go over to northern ireland i'm back in a
S0619	mm
S0618	back in a i dunno you think england's a patriarchy move to northern ireland mate bloody hell
S0619	mm
S0618	i be work with committees of sort of sixty to ninety year old catholic men who didn't have a fuck clue about business and be try to tell me what they want
S0619	mm
S0618	erm
S0619	i think with teach though it's slightly different in that it be erm a female dominate industry
S0618	mm
S0619	and directors of school and headmistresses and english er not english er be women
S0618	yeah
S0619	er i use to hate and and give me sort of advice on how to teach
S0618	what
S0619	i'd be like no really shut up really don't have any any need
S0618	and don't you have more experience than and
S0619	yeah
S0619	yeah by by far
S0618	mm
S0619	so
S0618	curious
S0619	it be curious curious
S0618	yeah i suppose teach have tend to be a profession that's pretty piss poor pay as well
S0619	mm
S0618	apart from in a lot of northern european countries
S0619	yes
S0618	i think denmark in particular teachers be very well respect and germany to some extent have a female erm friend who teach in a school in germany erm i actually have a male friend who also teach in a school in germany and they're treat like civil servants
S0619	mm
S0618	and once they have so many years in the role they get extra tax break and big pension and things like that it's very well respect i think they get a lot more shit from the students than
S0619	oh for sure
S0618	erm you know perhaps further northern countries
S0619	there's nothing in front of this van oh yeah there be there's er some cars go very slowly
S0618	that yeah
S0619	black car what's it do
S0618	i wonder if that's just an english person keep a good brake distance between it and the slower vehicle in front
S0619	but there isn't a vehicle in front be there
S0618	i don't know yet we might find out when we're round this corner yeah there be i can see cars be snake down slowly
S0619	ah
S0618	so yeah see what i mean about this be the culture here do you see the blue punto
S0619	mm how close that car be yeah yeah yeah
S0618	behind it be get in the boot and that be exactly the culture but the punto as far as i'm aware be think nothing bad or you know
S0619	yeah
S0618	nasty about the car that it's try to get into the boot of so as a driver you just kind of need to accept that people be gonna drive right up your arse and that it's nothing personal it's like be in a car with with with erm
S0619	mm
S0618	with erm
S0619	mm
S0618	and they all drive like that and they're
S0618	they're not swear at the car in front they're just go about their business
S0619	yeah it's just normal uhu
S0618	it's just what they do erm but as a driver that's more accustom to have much more space
S0619	uhu
S0618	between vehicles erm you can take it a bite personally if you don't know that's what i mean about if you do decide to do some drive lessons
S0619	mm
S0618	here it's
S0619	yes
S0618	yeah
S0619	mm goodness me didn't sleep well at all last night i be just kind of fret
S0618	about
S0619	oh load of things but i think in a couple of days i'll be right
S0618	mm you probably have a bite of purge to do
S0619	mm
S0618	after
S0619	yeah
S0618	the conversation of yesterday
S0619	sweat it out i yeah i think i need a little bite of time to sort of process i'm not really that bother

S0619	yes i'm
S0618	detox and therapia
S0619	oh i be look at the pregnant one

S0618	no
S0618	no the sign to the right of that one
S0618	oh well
S0619	you
S0618	see this be what i mean about the subjective nature of reality
S0618	we could both look in the same direction and have completely different perceptions
S0619	i just look at the first one
S0619	ah that's so funny
S0618	ah
S0619	but yes let's ring that number and see what happen
