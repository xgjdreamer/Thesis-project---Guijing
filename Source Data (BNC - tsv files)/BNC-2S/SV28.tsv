S0198	yeah
S0192	change every year
S0198	there's no sense of permanence for it
S0192	it make you realise how quick a year be as well
S0198	yeah
S0192	there's enough time to get set up and get go and like to do something but
S0198	it's necessary to set up and get a sense so you have like you've get a routine as quick as possible
S0192	you be here for a year be there anything else we need i guess as we think of things we can add it to the list
S0198	we can add it onto the list yeah
S0192	we need a dustpan and brush but we have a hoover at the minute and who know what's come up with my stuff
S0198	dad father yeah
S0192	yeah
S0198	erm
S0192	i hope my speakers work those speakers need a clean everything need a clean
S0198	yeah most things need a clean
S0192	mm
S0198	do we need to contact the agency or go in there at all and ask them if any question
S0192	probably but maybe on monday or something like that
S0198	yeah okay fine just about simple like rubbish day and i guess you could perhaps ask your neighbour
S0192	i mean there's no harm go in there with or send them an email with a bunch of photos or something
S0198	mm
S0192	or go in there and talk them and then send them an email with a bunch of photos afterwards just say i've take a few photos of some things that i might need look at or just at least so you understand that come the end of the semester if i leave in similar condition then that's okay
S0198	yeah that's fine
S0192	erm
S0198	because yeah i'm not be charge to clean windows when when i move in no one be charge to clean them
S0192	no yeah and they hadn't be clean these windows be quite filthy actually those ones at the front
S0198	mm
S0192	erm
S0198	why don't they just get someone around to clean them
S0192	yeah i don't know
S0198	well it's not a very good impression our landlord leave
S0192	no i think it's fair to erm probably give the weekend what's the date today thursday i guess i could go in tomorrow or the two of us could go in tomorrow
S0198	mm
S0192	a couple of days would have pass it might be good to know when the rubbish go out but i don't think we're produce well we do have rubbish
S0198	yeah we have yeah we
S0192	we're go to build up with rubbish
S0198	it seem like the stuff go out this morning which be like have we know
S0192	it might be more frequent
S0198	yeah
S0192	there's quite a few people that live down this road
S0198	mm
S0192	with some small bin by the look of things
S0198	i bet it's not more frequent
S0192	but i mean
S0198	i bet it's still just as
S0192	surely this house alone with the different people produce quite a bite of waste
S0198	as always yeah
S0192	more than my family my mum and
S0198	because well it's because there's so many adults in one space isn't there
S0192	yeah exactly but there's only quite small
S0198	be that be that the argument
S0192	small dustbins so i can't see they come once a week
S0198	yeah
S0192	didn't look like it be that overflow
S0198	there be like three big round black ones per house though isn't there
S0192	yeah there be
S0198	that's i think they maybe once a week still
S0192	well
S0198	but people recycle as well so you're recycle get make your rubbish smaller
S0192	that go on a different day as well doesn't it
S0198	typically yeah
S0192	i put the rubbish out the wrong day
S0198	yeah
S0192	that wasn't good
S0198	yeah do your do you do you realise what happen
S0192	well i just nobody else put their rubbish bin out and then the next day nobody else still do but the next night people do
S0198	oh yeah
S0192	or maybe the night after that i'm not sure
S0198	so do your mum just tell you the wrong day or do you mishear her
S0192	oh no i don't know maybe i misheard
S0198	be it thursday and not tuesday or something
S0192	yeah maybe that's what it be
S0198	that's understandable
S0192	be it time for brunch
S0198	yeah we should cook put the george foreman on
S0192	be that what we're cook with
S0198	probably good for sausages isn't it
S0192	it will get the fat out of them it's leaner meaner fat grill machine
S0198	then you don't have to turn the oven on
S0192	yeah
S0198	and then we just heat up the bean and fry some egg

S0192	no oh i can see a woman there
S0198	unless they unless they be a very accommodate nursery
S0192	there's a couple of women in there
S0198	in which case yeah whatever though we don't need to sleep during the day we won't even be here on some days
S0192	no no
S0198	so
S0192	it might be a bite annoy if you're try to study which might be why we need to study in that room
S0198	mm
S0192	or just put some gentle music on or something
S0198	that's true no i'm not
S0192	a bite of music here it wouldn't have to be very loud
S0198	no
S0192	just have some chill out music while you're study can you study to music it need to be instrumental for me
S0198	yeah it need to be fairly chill
S0192	but i could pretty much just leave it run on instrumental and always have instrumental music run in the house
S0198	yeah it be why not
S0192	oh that's a good crack
S0198	sorry i didn't consider the answer hook that speaker system up

S0192	i think it's the material
S0198	oh it's not actually
S0192	like sticky or something maybe there's a bite of stickiness these windows need clean as well you can see they've replace these lock be you alright there
S0198	yeah i just
S0192	i'll do that
S0198	don't worry i've get it replace what lock the lock to the window
S0192	yeah
S0198	oh
S0192	some of them be new
S0198	oh be they
S0192	well relatively new
S0198	those little attachments
S0192	i mean it's still clearly quite old but they're not as old as the windows back there
S0198	how old be sash windows do we know
S0192	no erm even my house have sash windows and the house be over a hundred years old now do you know how to actually work this thing five minutes a hundred and forty degrees
S0198	how high do it go jesus
S0192	right you can choose the temperature
S0198	yeah it's the proper one it's two hundred be that too high
S0192	what temperature be you put it up to
S0198	i don't know
S0192	be it come on i don't want to forget that that's do you get me
S0198	yeah and we're go to cook so we shouldn't forget about it
S0192	no but
S0198	oh no yeah sorry sorry sorry i do forget yeah
S0192	science
S0198	i think you mean i i think you mean we shouldn't forget about the george foreman
S0192	no any periods longer than about ten second they seem to cut out
S0198	yeah that's fair enough
S0192	bite of a pain in the arse
S0198	when's the last time you i mean you've be cook sausages for a while
S0192	do you think a hundred and seventy's high enough
S0198	no they should go higher
S0192	normally cook it in the oven at about two hundred
S0198	no it go up to two fifteen
S0192	two hundred should be fine one eight five should definitely cook them well why don't you can you make cake
S0198	how many sausages do you want
S0192	erm
S0198	there's five
S0192	oh there's five you're go to have two right

S0198	don't know
S0192	you have more than one one egg shouldn't you
S0198	be you go to have three
S0192	i mean if you're have two then it would make sense to have three cos otherwise there's just one leave over and that just seem a bite pointless
S0198	and then er they be in the freezer as well so they thaw yesterday so we should probably
S0192	ah eat them quicker then
S0198	eat them quicker

S0192	be you go to use these little scissor do you think they'll work
S0198	i've think about it that's the only kind of sharp knife

S0198	be they just sprinkle in chocolate
S0192	yeah
S0198	there you go sprinkle in chocolate
S0192	smell like burn but this shit that's on the top of this thing be come off on the pan and maybe oh be that just tell you it's half way
S0198	mm mm
S0192	it's quite noisy
S0198	that's if i put it up to ten minute erm i don't think i put it up maybe i do
S0192	be it actually cook be it heat it's pretty slow if we have to turn this thing on about ten minutes before
S0198	i mean it's melt so it's definitely
S0192	yeah unless there's just
S0198	it's not that hot
S0192	the temperature of the room
S0198	sow your bean
S0192	yeah be that all you've get
S0198	yeah
S0192	out of bean
S0198	well we've get some plastic ones as well so
S0192	well it's definitely start to steam so
S0198	we've you only have three egg there three egg
S0192	i know i don't know
S0198	i think that's okay
S0192	i eat it the other day
S0198	just cos you have all day you want all that yoke don't you like gravy we do have bean though that's my save grace
S0192	yeah i'll just do two egg i guess be you just have one
S0198	yeah but you can have two i mean don't let don't let that be a judge of anything i'm tempt not to wash up until we have put hot water on to shower
S0192	yeah that's not a terrible idea
S0198	to run our little sink with
S0192	it's good that we've get a nice size side here for food preparation
S0198	yeah er
S0192	we do have george foreman's what's wrong
S0198	it go
S0192	fat
S0198	fat that come of of it
S0192	christ there's three egg in there how do be those
S0198	erm they're not that do i don't know if we should be cook the egg yet actually
S0192	okay where's the bin
S0198	under the sink in a bag in a that bag
S0192	this one
S0198	yeah
S0192	i mean if we'd have fry the sausages they'd be alright like that we could have all for five six minutes it doesn't take to fry sausages ten minutes
S0198	it's true once it's at temperature though i don't know how hot it be originally
S0192	but look at look how slow this one be
S0198	er the fat's start to come out yeah
S0192	look how slow this be shall i shut this window well no do i
S0198	no cos the
S0192	this isn't go to cook very well at all
S0198	i guess three erm thing be it will get really hot and then it will be too
S0192	it's just smoke
S0198	it will be too hot and then you won't be able to turn it down again
S0192	they're just smoke
S0198	i reckon it's where they've be bleach though it smell like you've scrub the oven after you've put
S0192	do you think it will erm clear out
S0198	well i hope so it's really
S0192	cook a few time it's not good
S0198	yeah cos the stuff that come off straight away
S0192	yeah
S0198	that oven's
S0192	so it just need a good scrub or something
S0198	terrible no cos the actual part come off of it though i think you just need to er i don't want that smell every time we cook something
S0192	no we need to tell her that it's smoke do you want to check on sausages make sure they're okay
S0198	ah i'm stick still think they've get a little longer
S0192	oh they definitely do
S0198	they're big sausages i guess
S0192	we should turn this down i guess it's go to get really hot isn't it we won't be able to change yeah they be quite big sausages even try and push it down yeah turn the temperature up maybe we'll whack it up two hundred and fifteen that will cook them
S0198	you can smell it oh we haven't shower yet have we that's good
S0192	no no of course we haven't shower
S0198	i don't like smell like fry or grill food for the rest of the day
S0192	no i don't either you see now it's go
S0198	really stick to your hair yeah now you're probably won't go to cool it down
S0192	no
S0198	i guess you can take it off let it cook itself
S0192	yeah
S0198	so
S0192	cos they're not do yet be they
S0198	no
S0192	where's the spatula
S0198	i mean if you put them in ah yeah it's not an oven though be it
S0192	i mean yeah
S0198	yeah have you have many bean since you've be home
S0192	yeah i have yeah
S0198	eat bean i've only have it once or twice
S0192	have you
S0198	i've have a few slice of marmite toast
S0192	you can definitely smell that stuff
S0198	oh sorry
S0192	these egg be get really stick on here
S0198	yeah hopefully your dad have a few piece of stuff
S0192	i'm not sure oh right no it just look like a cheap pot and pan set it's just about the same
S0198	oh right
S0192	we need like a decent wok or something i mean you've get a wok there
S0198	yeah that's what i think like
S0192	a decent fry pan we get everything for free again in korea
S0198	yeah we do didn't we
S0192	yeah
S0198	that massive pan of that he give us
S0192	yeah
S0198	i bet he hardly use that
S0192	yeah i bet he hardly use that
S0198	for a start he be you know very and secondly i don't think he do any cook in his apartment ever
S0192	no i don't think he do too well the fat's really come off of that now
S0198	yeah i know it's really ooze
S0192	how be it look it's cook but it's still not do
S0198	no four more minutes
S0192	damn we're gonna have to get use to these cook
S0198	get some cutlery ready none the less
S0192	you like your egg to be cook dry
S0198	do you bring back chopsticks with you
S0192	yeah i do yeah yeah
S0198	you grab some didn't you i grab one set which mean in the end but erm i wasn't sure if you do you take some or not
S0192	i think this one you probably want to boil this up to six immediately and then turn it down after like three minutes
S0198	yeah yeah just to get it up to really hot
S0192	do english people leave their butter out
S0198	yeah mainly especially in like a butter butter bowl
S0192	butter thing
S0198	er butter dish
S0192	yeah
S0198	yeah it's to keep it soft because butter never use to be spreadable
S0192	no
S0198	they put something in it do they though
S0192	do they
S0198	how do they make it spreadable
S0192	isn't that like margarine though cos butter isn't spreadable though until you
S0198	you can get spreadable butter
S0192	until it's warmer
S0198	yeah
S0192	until it's warmer
S0198	my oh be utterly butterly butter i swear you can get spreadable butter now
S0192	i mean then a spreadable butter would have something add to it
S0198	like olive oil or something
S0192	i have no idea probably some
S0198	oh man the sausages smell good i literally have sausages once but it we do it properly we have a sausage
S0192	what be the pork percentage on these be it in this bin
S0198	yeah i think so i don't know though i think they're or maybe no
S0192	it should say on it thick outdoor grade pork sausages oh that look alright eighty five percent pork they're pretty high
S0198	mm
S0192	i don't think i've have higher than seventy since i've be here
S0198	oh really i wouldn't i don't think that my mum buy anything less than eighty five now
S0192	yeah good
S0198	but they don't eat sausages ever actually which be why she give them to me she's like my dad doesn't eat them anymore because the skin's too tough for his teeth
S0192	oh i bet
S0198	yeah
S0192	i mean toad in the hole make for a good dish
S0198	yeah we have it with jacket potato and with gravy and everything
S0192	yeah that's nice or with bean and cheese
S0198	bean and something it be good yeah it be really good but that's the only time i have sausages
S0192	that's good old british cook that be
S0198	we do use to cut them open at uni and sear them didn't we
S0192	i know
S0198	be that to make it quicker oh that's cos we always have sandwich though
S0192	no
S0198	be it
S0192	not a lean mean grill machine
S0198	yeah
S0192	this be do now okay
S0198	do we need to do that erm
S0192	how do be this
S0198	i don't know
S0192	sausages erm surely that's just open them up and have a look
S0198	do you think they're cook yet
S0192	yeah maybe yeah get a knife and fork and quickly just do we have a knife and fork each that we can there's not there's not another knife be there
S0198	there's only this
S0192	do you want me to do it really quickly you turn them over
S0198	i think they're cook
S0192	it do look pretty cook
S0198	come on
S0192	let's just quickly do that as quickly as possible
S0198	i think they're cook but they be sausage
S0192	i ask if it's alright to pause this thing
S0198	yes
S0192	and they seem to think so
S0198	yeah
S0192	so i've be like if i need to pause it or somebody have a phone call or something happen then erm oh do you want to check on the bean and the egg just make sure that be silent
S0198	yeah
S0192	and the same people be talk when you come back and it's not just cut in half way through a conversation
S0198	no
S0192	so you'd get it at the begin of a conversation do this thing turn off now
S0198	yeah that's the best thing to do isn't it no i don't well i don't know i've never use it before so it could do that will be exactly like
S0192	yeah
S0198	but erm maybe it's just to let you that ten minutes be up because it will be annoy for it to start cool down
S0192	just give give it another yeah
S0198	it's think it's probably turn of
S0192	i think it's still on
S0198	yeah it's just on now
S0192	where's the spatula
S0198	i think there might be a better thing for it to register as isn't it
S0192	have this stop cook or have you just put it back on
S0198	no i just put it back on i haven't touch any of the dial the tin be still hot
S0192	should be yeah i do see it bubble
S0198	where be we go to eat this just on the how can we eat oh we eat on the couch didn't we
S0192	be we gonna keep this go or pause it
S0198	there's no table or chair be there
S0192	there be no table or chair
S0198	erm i don't know it depend i suppose
S0192	erm i'll eat it in here
S0198	what just stand up
S0192	yeah
S0198	no i'd rather sit down and eat dinner wouldn't you
S0192	yeah i guess so but i've get nothing to eat it off so here i can stand up and eat but
S0198	oh i'll just sit it on the floor i think and just
S0192	oh i'm not very good at that
S0198	i'll sit it on my lap
S0192	yeah i guess so i'll try the floor
S0198	i think these sausages be probably cook
S0192	i think they be but i'm just make sure these be hot all the way through cos i take them off the heat a little bite
S0198	yeah
S0192	yeah they look good enough
S0198	yeah they're cook all the way through aren't they
S0192	yeah i'll just leave it back on
S0198	i guess once we go down we'll just
S0192	be we eat there
S0198	it's on forty so we can really
S0192	or just keep it on i mean can you talk while you're eat
S0198	yeah that's true yeah
S0192	if you can that will carry it on
S0198	okay
S0192	okay
S0198	shall i just dish out these sausages

S0198	yeah
S0192	rather than just a fry pan

S0192	mm banana
S0198	mm bananas oh the egg be
S0192	the sausage be good
S0198	yeah
S0192	they taste like they're a high pork percentage i guess whenever we get sausages just don't do it very often and get nicer ones
S0198	get meatier ones
S0192	yeah
S0198	well like i say there be
S0192	less crap in it
S0198	that be a pack of erm
S0192	how much be they
S0198	i think they be a pack of ten i guess maybe
S0192	mm
S0198	and you get those and you can get two other type of meat or just three pack of those for ten pound in morrisons
S0192	oh that's not bad
S0198	you can get like chicken breast erm other stuff as well i can't remember what like but for a weeks worth of meat it be easily enough but then erm
S0192	we're definitely go to need to go to a few different supermarkets
S0198	yeah waitrose be not convenient i mean it's convenient it's not
S0192	be farmers' market here cheaper or just more expensive
S0198	or more expensive i don't know er i think they're probably they can be better value if you be like be at the farm like if you drive past farm sometimes they're erm
S0192	they'll have deal they will just put out
S0198	well they sell out they'll their egg cheap and they sell potatoes really like for a better value
S0192	mm
S0198	and much better potatoes too
S0192	cos there's no middle man
S0198	yeah but actually they be grow in israel and then freeze and then ship over or whatever
S0192	do you think a lot of the produce be freeze then
S0198	i don't know how do well it go in the refrigerator lorry things that be i don't know maybe maybe not freeze just keep at this happy cool temperature that's quite quite cool
S0192	mm
S0198	just so er it preserve the food for as long as possible until it reach your destination or still i think really
S0192	i don't really like apples
S0198	i think we be the last time we be in england it be earlier in the summer and there be more english fruit like strawberries and stuff cheaper i remember around the market and things
S0192	yeah

S0192	have you be to the market since you be back

S0198	if we can get on to the erm aldi and whatnot once a week that's really it we're pretty good at
S0192	certainly for like onions and stuff
S0198	it might take a few few weeks to get into a routine and there's like an here
S0192	mm
S0198	and then before we know it will be in christmas holiday
S0192	a real shame we can't record them

S0198	yeah but kind of want some years to last a little bite longer i'm happy for the work years to go as quick as possible
S0192	yeah
S0198	but the travel and study years i'd quite like for them to last a little bite longer
S0192	mm definitely it's certainly not go to feel as long as our first time we go to uni
S0198	no ah three years er yeah three years
S0192	how's yours go down
S0198	mm it's go down well yours
S0192	mm

S0198	i'm still only on my second sausage something to yeah gonna be a one too many
S0192	mm
S0198	mm i do like bean
S0192	i wonder if they ever will make a yolk sauce
S0198	well no i'm clearly surprise they haven't i feel like they'd be a market for it but then maybe not
S0192	i don't know how you would do it
S0198	some people quite a few people be kind of i suppose not actually in england but egg can be a funny food so
S0192	oh people be a bite uncertain about them
S0198	yeah
S0192	i be for age i didn't like the white
S0198	no someone else didn't as well that i speak to recently i can't remember who it be
S0192	mm
S0198	maybe one of my brothers maybe
S0192	it be quite common to be a bite weirded out by egg
S0198	apparently be terrible at eat
S0192	and by bean
S0198	mm
S0192	god what be that it's not skin be it it's it's like
S0198	no don't
S0192	some
S0198	get to eat it
S0192	rubbery skin
S0198	yeah what be this fake skin they use for sausages
S0192	i don't know
S0198	be it bad for you do you reckon
S0192	no i don't know
S0198	it's probably not good for you be it
S0192	i really don't know i have no idea what it be it use to be pig intestines
S0198	yeah sometimes it still be in a high quality end sausages i think i bet they still use it
S0192	i mean i imagine if it be like pig intestines i imagine it to be more like that
S0198	mm
S0192	thicker
S0198	mm
S0192	it's better we just stuff the animal back in it's own arse
S0198	yeah i know really harsh
S0192	basically and then eat it
S0198	bend you up yeah
S0192	stick your back in your own gut
S0198	mm
S0192	and eat your sausages excuse me it doesn't seem like a very friendly thing to do
S0198	it doesn't but it taste good
S0192	mm
S0198	whoever decide to do that that one time and make a sausage who make the world's first sausage
S0192	do you think he be a bite weirded out the first time he do it like people don't like this i don't know surely at the time everyone just eat whatever part they have though
S0198	maybe it come out of just the necessity like you have all this leave over meat that be bits and bob
S0192	mm
S0198	and you couldn't cook it in bits and bob so you stuff in inside something you could cook it
S0192	yeah
S0198	i bet we've be do it for years like haggis
S0192	stick it in the organs of the other animal
S0198	mm
S0192	yeah i don't see why not
S0198	my go down slowly
S0192	be you gonna smoke a cigarette
S0198	i'm gonna pour this coffee and then smoke a cigarette
S0192	we're go to stop again

S0192	we need to stop at least a couple of weeks before our course we don't want to be like
S0198	yeah of course not i mean as of monday just we're just i mean we're not go over the top with anything have we we have one cider last night and smoke a cigarette so
S0192	no yeah
S0198	as long as we're conscious of that
S0192	i just feel bad that we be try not to smoke cigarettes and we just smoke them
S0198	no
S0192	i smoke a few cigarettes with
S0198	yeah i do when i go out drink i do in the when i be at home
S0192	and cigars
S0198	if i have a free house i think i'd be have be worse for it
S0192	mm
S0198	but i do really try not to smoke around my parent they must have smelt it i know but i never go out more just for a reason just to keep me from smoke too
S0192	i get a little bite addict to cigarettes again on that last day i have to smoke out my dad's window
S0198	oh do you in his house
S0192	in the bedroom yeah he probably could smell it
S0198	mm before you meet er when do you do that what of an even
S0192	yeah he didn't come back in again but
S0198	mm
S0192	do you want one then
S0198	yeah
S0192	where be the cigarettes
S0198	er that's your department i think
S0192	it's drum
S0198	yeah what how many grams be it
S0192	it's not the best tobacco
S0198	how many grams be it
S0192	it's a fifty gram pouch
S0198	oh
S0192	so it's go to last a while
S0198	oh how much be that oh it's our pouch
S0192	yeah of course
S0198	oh fuck yeah awesome
S0192	yeah
S0198	it's three pound something for just have you see it the three in one old auburn or whatever everyone's buy at least round my way
S0192	no
S0198	and you get a very small pouch of tobacco it's like seven six point five grams
S0192	oh yeah i do know that one
S0198	you just get one though and not two before you use to get two of them in the box know you get one of those a pack of rizla and some filter tip and it's call the three in one
S0192	how much be it
S0198	and it's like three pound forty nine or something
S0192	wow that's well expensive for half the
S0198	but i'm like i'd rather spend yeah i'd rather spend the less or more and get i don't need to get the three in one rubbish
S0192	no
S0198	but for people like and who don't smoke all the time they also only smoke when they drink then they just get that buy that like once a week and that's not plenty enough for the week
S0192	yeah
S0198	erm stuff like that so
S0192	i mean you still get quite a few rollies out of it i'm sure
S0198	yeah yeah yeah it still last like erm even when we've drink between
S0192	probably get
S0198	we share between three of us one of them that's fine
S0192	i wonder what the tobacco company think of erm all these vapo cigarettes
S0198	yeah i know if they've
S0192	unless they're behind it
S0198	unless they've already get their investments into it yeah
S0192	yeah
S0198	they may either be behind or if they're not
S0192	cos really that's i mean it would have be within their interest maybe even like forty years ago to start invest to start produce stuff that smokers people these you know fine to smoke something else that they could do that wouldn't be so harmful to them
S0198	yeah definitely but you continue to make money from it
S0192	but vaping isn't it i don't think it's like completely unregulated
S0198	no
S0192	whenever we've try it i think it be horrible
S0198	yeah it taste it feel like a you know that like liquid stuff you burn around the house or something
S0192	yeah it doesn't taste healthy at all
S0198	i don't think it's mean to be inhale
S0192	i mean cigarettes don't either but at least it's a plant of some sort
S0198	yeah
S0192	i mean it's just a chemical
